Creek Turnpike

The Creek Turnpike, also designated State Highway 364 (SH-364), is a <a href="freeway">freeway</a>-standard <a href="toll%20road">toll road</a> that lies entirely in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>. The turnpike forms a partial <a href="beltway">beltway</a> around the south and east sides of <a href="Tulsa%2C%20Oklahoma">Tulsa</a>, Oklahoma's second largest city. The Creek Turnpike's western terminus is at the <a href="Turner%20Turnpike">Turner Turnpike</a> in <a href="Sapulpa%2C%20Oklahoma">Sapulpa</a>, while its northeastern terminus is at the <a href="Will%20Rogers%20Turnpike">Will Rogers Turnpike</a> in <a href="Fair%20Oaks%2C%20Oklahoma">Fair Oaks</a>; both ends of the Creek Turnpike connect with <a href="Interstate%2044">Interstate 44</a> (I-44). Along the way, the highway passes through the cities of Sapulpa, <a href="Jenks%2C%20Oklahoma">Jenks</a>, Tulsa, and <a href="Broken%20Arrow%2C%20Oklahoma">Broken Arrow</a>, and the counties of <a href="Creek%20County%2C%20Oklahoma">Creek</a>, <a href="Tulsa%20County%2C%20Oklahoma">Tulsa</a>, <a href="Wagoner%20County%2C%20Oklahoma">Wagoner</a> and <a href="Rogers%20County%2C%20Oklahoma">Rogers</a>. The road is maintained by the <a href="Oklahoma%20Turnpike%20Authority">Oklahoma Turnpike Authority</a> (OTA), except for a brief free section shared with <a href="US-64%20%28OK%29">U.S. Route 64</a> (US-64) and <a href="US-169%20%28OK%29">US-169</a>. This free section is maintained by the <a href="Oklahoma%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Oklahoma Department of Transportation</a> (ODOT).

The first section of the Creek Turnpike, from <a href="US-75%20%28OK%29">US-75</a> in Jenks to US-64/US-169 in Tulsa, was first authorized in 1987, with construction beginning in 1989. The turnpike's construction was controversial; homeowners along the route of the highway formed a group called Tulsans Against Turnpikes to fight the highway in both the courtroom and the media. The highway was also challenged on environmental grounds, with impacts upon wetlands and endangered species being the chief concerns. Nevertheless, the highway opened to traffic in three sections, starting from the easternmost, over the course of the first half of 1992.

Further extensions to both the east and the west followed in later years after several years of false starts under the administrations of two different governors. Expansion of the highway was finally approved in 1998. The extension to the west, linking the Creek Turnpike to the Turner Turnpike in Sapulpa, opened December 15, 2000. The extension to the east opened in three parts over the course of 2001 and 2002.

The Creek Turnpike begins at I-44 (<a href="Turner%20Turnpike">Turner Turnpike</a>) exit 217 in the city of <a href="Sapulpa%2C%20Oklahoma">Sapulpa</a>. This interchange only provides access from eastbound I-44 to the Creek Turnpike and from the Creek Turnpike to westbound I-44. The turnpike runs in a general southeast direction from this terminus towards the <a href="Creek%20County%2C%20Oklahoma">Creek</a>–<a href="Tulsa%20County%2C%20Oklahoma">Tulsa</a> county line, crossing over <a href="Polecat%20Creek%20%28stream%29">Polecat Creek</a>. Upon crossing into Tulsa County, the toll road turns to a more easterly course. The highway enters <a href="Jenks%2C%20Oklahoma">Jenks</a> less than one mile (approximately 1.6 km) east of the county line. In Jenks, the highway has a modified <a href="cloverleaf%20interchange">cloverleaf interchange</a> at <a href="US-75%20%28OK%29">US-75</a>; the westbound Turnpike to southbound US-75 ramp is a directional ramp rather than a loop ramp. The Creek Turnpike then passes through the first of three barrier toll plazas. Near the interchange with Elm Street (signed as "Peoria–Elm"; Elm Street is named Peoria Avenue outside of Jenks), the highway bridges Polecat Creek again, before crossing the <a href="Arkansas%20River">Arkansas River</a> into <a href="Tulsa">Tulsa</a>.

In Tulsa, the Creek Turnpike has an interchange at Memorial Drive, which carries <a href="US-64%20%28OK%29">US-64</a> south of the toll road. At this interchange, Creek Turnpike traffic merges with northbound US-64 onto a free road, forming the <a href="Mingo%20Valley%20Expressway">Mingo Valley Expressway</a>. <a href="US-169%20%28OK%29">US-169</a> also begins at this interchange, heading north from here toward its other end in <a href="Virginia%2C%20Minnesota">Virginia, Minnesota</a>. As the Mingo Valley Expressway (carrying US-64/US-169) turns north, the Creek Turnpike exits to continue southeast. The highway leaves Tulsa, entering <a href="Broken%20Arrow%2C%20Oklahoma">Broken Arrow</a>, where it crosses over <a href="Haikey%20Creek">Haikey Creek</a>. The turnpike passes through the second toll plaza, then turns back east.

In southeast Broken Arrow, the Creek Turnpike crosses the county line into <a href="Wagoner%20County%2C%20Oklahoma">Wagoner County</a> and swings towards the north-northeast. It then meets <a href="State%20Highway%2051%20%28Oklahoma%29">SH-51</a>, followed by the <a href="Muskogee%20Turnpike">Muskogee Turnpike</a> (<a href="SH-351%20%28OK%29">SH-351</a>) near that highway's western terminus. The Creek Turnpike passes through the third and final barrier toll after re-entering Tulsa. From the toll plaza, the turnpike proceeds north to end at the I-44/US-412 interchange, which straddles the Wagoner–<a href="Rogers%20County%2C%20Oklahoma">Rogers County</a> county line. The portion of the interchange that sits in Rogers County also lies in the town of <a href="Fair%20Oaks%2C%20Oklahoma">Fair Oaks</a>. The mainline Creek Turnpike becomes the <a href="Will%20Rogers%20Turnpike">Will Rogers Turnpike</a> as eastbound I-44 merges onto the roadway.

<a href="Exit%20number">Exit number</a>s are absent along the Creek Turnpike until the 51st Street South interchange, which is numbered as exit 28. Exit numbers are posted north of this interchange, continuing until the highway's terminus (exits 33A–B). The Creek Turnpike's exit numbering is used for the final two exits on the westbound Will Rogers Turnpike—the westbound-only Pine Street exit (exit 35) and the westbound I-44 ramp (exit 34).

The entirety of the Creek Turnpike has been recognized as important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by its inclusion in the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>. In 2011, the highest <a href="average%20annual%20daily%20traffic">average annual daily traffic</a> (AADT) count was 26,900 vehicles eastbound and 26,476 vehicles westbound between the Yale Avenue and Memorial Drive interchanges. The lowest AADT counts, 4,426 vehicles eastbound and 4,463 vehicles westbound, were recorded between the 11th Street interchange and the northeastern terminus. Law enforcement along the Creek Turnpike is provided by <a href="Oklahoma%20Highway%20Patrol">Oklahoma Highway Patrol</a> Troop XE, a special troop assigned to the turnpike.

As early as the late 1950s, plans for a Tulsa freeway system included a route along 96th Street South. The 96th Street corridor was accessible to more motorists than other corridors further south (farther away from the urban core), while still having low <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a> costs, comparable to more southerly corridors. This made it the ideal route for a south Tulsa freeway. In 1986, ODOT had plans to build a toll-free facility called the Creek Freeway in the corridor as part of <a href="SH-117%20%28OK%29">SH-117</a>.

A south Tulsa turnpike was first authorized by OTA in 1987, the same time as three other turnpikes that would ultimately become the <a href="Cherokee%20Turnpike">Cherokee</a>, <a href="Chickasaw%20Turnpike">Chickasaw</a>, and <a href="John%20Kilpatrick%20Turnpike">John Kilpatrick</a> turnpikes. Eleven possible routings were researched before OTA settled on the 96th Street corridor as the site of the proposed turnpike. On February 16, 1989, OTA sold $558.4 million in revenue bonds (about $ in dollars) to cover the cost of all four proposed turnpikes.

As originally planned, the Creek Turnpike was to begin at US-75 and end at Memorial Drive, for a total length of . ODOT would then build a $26 million (approximately $ in dollars) freeway connection from the eastern terminus of the turnpike at Memorial Drive to tie in with the south end of the Mingo Valley Expressway. OTA intended the turnpike to be built on a "fast track", with construction to be complete by the close of 1991. The estimated cost to construct this first segment of the Creek Turnpike was $85 million (about $ in dollars). Initially, the highway was planned to have an median with a <a href="Jersey%20barrier">Jersey barrier</a>, which would meet minimum AASHTO requirements of . Later plans expanded this to a grass median. Four toll plazas were planned, with one mainline plaza collecting a fifty-cent toll no matter what distance was traveled.

Tulsa mayor <a href="Rodger%20Randle">Rodger Randle</a>'s committee on the Creek Turnpike submitted a report to OTA on April 13, 1989, requesting that the agency make 47 changes to the turnpike. Among the changes proposed by the city was a shift in the route of to the north between Yale Avenue and Sheridan Road to accommodate a <a href="greenway%20%28landscape%29">greenway</a> along both sides of the turnpike. The committee also recommended wider overpasses to accommodate future expansion of surface streets such as Delaware Avenue, moving the mainline toll plaza farther east to minimize impact on the surrounding area, and better compliance with local flood prevention ordinances. In addition, the report suggested better pedestrian access, including pedestrian bridges on both sides of the Arkansas River and near Hunter Park, and various sidewalks and pedestrian tunnels.

OTA immediately agreed that some of the more minor changes to the turnpike's plans could be made, but expressed doubt that more major alterations would be made. Several of the proposed changes, including the greenway, were highlighted as major expenses. Nonetheless, OTA agreed to evaluate the city's proposals. Board member (and future Tulsa mayor) <a href="Dewey%20F.%20Bartlett%2C%20Jr.">Dewey F. Bartlett, Jr.</a>, said "We are not set in stone, but it's a matter of economics." Mayor Randle stated his desire for a written agreement regarding the changes to be drawn up and signed by the city and OTA before ground was broken on the turnpike.

On June 18, 1989, OTA officials announced that the majority of the city's proposed amendments to the Creek Turnpike would be incorporated into the design. The alterations added $6 million (about $ in dollars) to the cost of the project. However, the revised plan required the demolition of only 41 houses, six fewer than originally planned. Further alterations were negotiated throughout the latter half of 1989, with OTA and Tulsa reaching an agreement on December 29. The plans were adapted to include flood and noise control provisions. To meet these requirements, the highway would be lowered, with some sections below-grade. In exchange, the City of Tulsa agreed to pay $1.3 million in annual maintenance costs until 2020. The deal also included a land swap, with the city giving OTA land from Hunter Park and receiving land along the right-of-way to construct recreational trails.

OTA began filing condemnation suits for homes within the Creek Turnpike's proposed right-of-way on June 30, 1989. Condemnation, the process by which a government exercises its powers of <a href="eminent%20domain">eminent domain</a>, was required for OTA to seize properties necessary for the project when owners refused OTA buyout offers. Bids were opened for Creek Turnpike construction projects that November. Contracts for utility relocation, grading, and drainage work were awarded at OTA's November 16 meeting. Meanwhile, work began on the condemned properties, with contractors moving or demolishing houses on the affected lots from December 1989 to January 1990.

Drainage work was in progress by late February 1990. Construction was underway on turnpike bridges by March 1990. While federal environmental permits were being secured, the construction process was delayed; by October 1990, the bridge construction was only at the point that had been planned to have been completed in May, and grading and paving work had yet to begin. In December 1990, contractors on the Creek Turnpike project were given "notice to proceed", as the permits had been granted. By that time, construction had only progressed to the point that it was supposed to have been at in late July. Nevertheless, by April 1991, OTA's chief executive officer, <a href="Richard%20Ridings%20%28politician%29">Richard Ridings</a>, described the project as "moving very well" and said "My own personal opinion is it's up to the contractors. If they want to produce, it can be open by the end of the year."

The first section of the Creek Turnpike to open was a segment from Delaware Avenue to its eastern terminus at Memorial Drive, which opened to traffic at 7 p.m. on March 13, 1992. Tolls were waived until 12:01 a.m. on March 16. The next section to the west, from Elm Street in Jenks to Delaware Avenue, including the Arkansas River bridge, opened the afternoon of April 15. The final leg of the first segment of the turnpike, from US-75 to Elm Street, opened at noon on July 30. The Creek Turnpike was initially posted with a speed limit, due to the <a href="National%20Maximum%20Speed%20Limit">National Maximum Speed Limit</a> law then in effect. Traffic levels on the new highway were about double what was expected, with an average of 9,000 vehicles per day using the turnpike in August 1992; a 1988 estimate predicted only 3,000 to 5,000 vehicles would use the road each day.

The Creek Turnpike was opposed by area residents from its conception. Forming a group called "Tulsans Against Turnpikes", around 220 citizens gathered at a meeting on February 16, 1989, to discuss the proposed toll road. Opponents to the turnpike cited detrimental effects to their community and to the environment as their concerns. "What I am concerned about is that it changes the complexion of south Tulsa. It would no longer be a residential area," said Tom Taylor, an area resident. Some residents also complained that the proposed turnpike would mainly serve through traffic, despite OTA estimates that south Tulsa residents would make up 90% of the road's userbase.

On March 22, 1989, three Will Rogers Turnpike tollbooth attendants made a surprise appearance at a Tulsans Against Turnpikes press conference to offer support to the opposition movement, expressing dissatisfaction with working conditions while manning the turnpike. The three attendants also gave examples of firsthand experience with turnpike customers that had convinced them that motorists were not as supportive of turnpikes as OTA executives believed. OTA responded to their employees' remarks by highlighting an <a href="Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Administration">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> study that found that the toll gate that the three attendants worked at met all safety standards.

In late June 1989, opponents of the turnpike <a href="boycott">boycott</a>ed local businesses that were members of the Metropolitan Tulsa Chamber of Commerce, which was in favor of the turnpike. Some turnpike protesters removed their names from the customer list at <a href="Mazzio%27s%20Italian%20Eatery">Mazzio's Italian Eatery</a> on June 23. On June 24, about forty protesters picketed the <a href="Bank%20of%20Oklahoma">Bank of Oklahoma</a>, and around six closed their accounts. The chief executives of both businesses were on the board of the Chamber of Commerce. In response to the boycott, Mayor Randle issued a statement accusing Tulsans Against Turnpikes of "seeking to wage economic coercion against businesses" and described their tactics as "[working] as a kind of economic blackmail to silence debate", as well as "allowing differences of opinion to degenerate into intimidation against those who have taken public stands unpopular with [Tulsans Against Turnpikes]". Randle also canceled a planned meeting with the group, refusing to meet with them until they ceased the boycott. A Tulsans Against Turnpikes board member publicly replied to the mayor's statement by denying that a boycott was taking place, stating that the group only recommended that members not do business with Mazzio's and Bank of Oklahoma because of their support for the Creek Turnpike project via their activity with the Chamber of Commerce. He also suggested that Randle was simply looking for an excuse to avoid the meeting.

The environmental group <a href="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> became involved with the opposition movement in October 1989. Holding a joint rally with Tulsans Against Turnpikes and several environmental groups at Hunter Park, a Greenpeace spokeswoman said on October 20 that the Creek Turnpike's construction "will be setting up Oklahoma as a hazardous waste dumping ground". Greenpeace's regional coordinator was scheduled to speak at an area library on the same day, but his appearance was canceled when the organization's bus ran out of fuel. A local resident at the Hunter Park forum was quoted as being concerned that the turnpike may allow eastern states such as <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> to ship <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a>-contaminated freight through the area.

In November 1989, Jenks resident Gary Medlin and two Jenks city councilmen drafted a letter to OTA requesting that the agency cease all work on the Creek Turnpike. The letter was approved by the Jenks City Council on November 20. The letter also included a <a href="petition">petition</a> in opposition to the turnpike with over 1,000 signatures.

A <a href="Grand%20juries%20in%20the%20United%20States">grand jury</a> petition, bearing over 1,400 signatures across 134 pages, was filed with the Tulsa County election board by Medlin on November 6, 1989. The petition alleged that local and state officials violated the state's open meetings, conspiracy, and conflict of interest laws while planning the turnpike. The election board certified the petition as meeting the required threshold of 1,000 signatures on December 15. Work on the turnpike continued despite the investigation. After meeting for seven days, on January 19, 1990, the grand jury determined that there was no evidence to support the allegations and no need for further investigation.

Some protesters resorted to illegal means to demonstrate their opposition to the project. In December 1989, trees and shrubbery on condemned lots were destroyed in an attempt to prevent them from being transplanted by landscapers. A field office belonging to M. J. Lee Construction Co., a contractor working on the project, was burglarized on March 4, 1990. The perpetrators stole or destroyed tools and poured oil on planning documents. A week later, the fuel lines on heavy equipment were slashed. On the night of April 26, several vehicles at a Creek Turnpike worksite belonging to M. J. Lee were vandalized; the vandals smashed windshields and headlights, stole fuel caps, and dumped mud into the fuel tanks. Messages reading "Death to OTA", "Death to [Governor Henry] <a href="Henry%20Bellmon">Bellmon</a>" and "Death to Bartlett" (who had recently also become a Tulsa city councilman) were written in mud on the side of a water truck at the site. The vice president of the firm emphasized that the company alone bore the brunt of the estimated $10,000 (equivalent to $ in ) financial loss, not OTA, and offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to the prosecution of the responsible party. Construction signage was also removed or covered up with Tulsans Against Turnpikes signs, and survey markers were relocated. Tulsans Against Turnpikes publicly condemned the vandalism, offering an additional $500 reward for information. A member of the group's board stated "We deplore this kind of cowardly, illegal action. There is no reason for some sick person to take out frustrations on the contractor[...]." In response to the vandalism, Tulsa police launched an investigation, and OTA stated that Oklahoma Highway Patrol officers would be on patrol in the construction areas. On August 11, 1990, a contractor arriving for work discovered a vandal attempting to break the window of a crane. As the employee approached the crane, four people fled the scene. The employee was able to detain two of them, both aged eighteen, until police arrived and cited them for misdemeanor malicious mischief.

The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority was exempt from requirements to have a federal <a href="environmental%20impact%20study">environmental impact study</a> (EIS) conducted on the Creek Turnpike project. As part of their opposition to the turnpike, Tulsans Against Turnpikes challenged this right. The group announced in April 1989 that if the <a href="Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA), <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Transportation">U.S. Department of Transportation</a> (USDOT), and <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Defense">U.S. Department of Defense</a> (DOD) did not force OTA to conduct an EIS within 60 days they would sue the three federal agencies. Tulsans Against Turnpikes, joined by an area <a href="homeowners%27%20association">homeowners' association</a>, John Reidel (a homeowner whose property was condemned by OTA and had filed previous suits as early as the 1950s to stop the turnpike's construction), and several other affected individuals, filed the suit in the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20Oklahoma">U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma</a> on August 10. Defendants in the suit included the federal agencies, state transportation and environmental agencies, and the city of Tulsa. That November, Tulsans Against Turnpikes filed a motion requesting an injunction against further work on the turnpike.

On January 27, 1990, U.S. District Judge <a href="Thomas%20Rutherford%20Brett">Thomas Rutherford Brett</a> dismissed seven of the nine claims before him, and on March 24, the plaintiffs filed a motion to drop the two remaining claims in hopes that the judge would reconsider the claims already dismissed. The plaintiffs also filed for a restraining order to halt construction activities. In support of their filings, the turnpike opponents alleged that OTA was illegally dumping material into waterways. OTA responded by producing <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> (USACE) documentation showing that no illegal discharge had taken place, and that USACE had not issued any <a href="cease%20and%20desist">cease and desist</a> orders due to unlawful activity. OTA argued that the plaintiffs' requests for a restraining order and reconsideration of the dismissed claims were invalid because there was no change in their legal authority or the facts surrounding the case to warrant such a reconsideration.

At a hearing on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett announced his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue at the heart of the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.

Initial turnpike plans included <a href="environmental%20mitigation">environmental mitigation</a> features to reduce the amount of disruption the finished road would cause to the local environment. In the Jenks area, OTA planned to replace destroyed <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s with new wetlands of equal or greater size. Landscapers were expected to plant two trees for every one removed to build the road. In March 1990, these plans were augmented to provide wetlands mitigation at a rate of three to one, for a total of of new wetlands. Additionally, of pasture would be allowed to revert to its natural state to create "dedicated natural succession areas."

On July 21, 1989, OTA approved a contract to transplant approximately 290 live trees in the path of the turnpike to locations along the edge of the right-of-way. There, the trees would serve as a barrier between the road and the surrounding properties, masking the road from view and muffling the sounds of traffic. A <a href="Norman%2C%20Oklahoma">Norman</a> landscaping firm performed the work, which included thirty months of maintenance, for a total cost of $288.50 per tree (equivalent to $ in dollars).

The <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) objected to the construction of the Creek Turnpike in a letter dated January 30, 1990. FEMA felt that documentation on how the project would affect the <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>s in the area was lacking, preventing local authorities from requesting updates to floodplain maps, which were necessary to keep their communities enrolled in <a href="flood%20insurance">flood insurance</a> programs. OTA's attorney stated that the requisite information had been provided to local officials, and it was not OTA's responsibility to ensure that they forwarded the information on to FEMA.

A Tulsa-area supervisor with the <a href="U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> (FWS) commented upon environmental issues pertaining to the Creek Turnpike in a 19-page letter to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dated February 9, 1990. USACE was responsible for issuing three essential permits (which OTA had applied for on November 6, 1989) that would allow construction to continue, and was required to consider input from the service. In the letter, supervisor Stephen Forsythe recommended that the permits be denied and further studies conducted into alternate routes for the turnpike and the environmental impact on roads that connected to the turnpike. However, USACE only had the authority to review the impacts the Creek Turnpike itself made on wetland areas. Governor Bellmon publicly criticized Forsythe for focusing on concerns beyond USACE's jurisdiction. Bellmon's Transportation Secretary, <a href="Neal%20McCaleb">Neal McCaleb</a>, publicly stated "I think [Forsythe] is out of line[...] and would say so to Mr. Forsythe." Bellmon and McCaleb discussed the letter in a private meeting with the <a href="U.S.%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Secretary of the Interior</a>, <a href="Manuel%20Lujan">Manuel Lujan</a>, although Lujan neither commented nor committed to any action regarding the letter. In response to Bellmon's criticism of the letter, Tulsans Against Turnpikes issued a public statement, saying "Running behind closed political doors like that demonstrates the governor is an environmental hypocrite," contrasting his statements with a letter he wrote assuring a constituent in Jenks that the project would be "the most aesthetically pleasing and environmentally sound facility that can be constructed".

In a letter sent to OTA in March 1990, USACE identified issues with the Creek Turnpike project, such as modifications to Polecat Creek's channel, impacts on the Arkansas River floodplain and levee system near Jenks, and loss of of wetlands. In two other letters sent in May 1990, USACE requested alterations to the project, detailing further concerns about destruction of a unique type of wetland near the turnpike's planned intersection with Yale Avenue, OTA's plan to temporarily drain Mill Creek Bridge Pond, and emergency access to homes only accessible by crossing the pond on a wooden bridge. USACE warned that, should the changes the corps requested not be made, the turnpike plans may violate federal law, which would result in USACE withholding the necessary permits. The corps also required "absolute assurance" that new wetlands constructed as part of the project's mitigation efforts would not be built on land that was formerly the site of a <a href="landfill">landfill</a>. On March 29, USACE held a public hearing as part of the permit process. The hearing had around 500 attendees, with over fifty of them giving five-minute speeches against the turnpike. One speaker compared the highway's environmental impact to that of the wreck of the oil tanker "<a href="Exxon%20Valdez">Exxon Valdez</a>". No citizens spoke out in favor of the project.

OTA announced plans to include sound barriers at three points along the turnpike in April 1990. The locations were recommended by a report commissioned by OTA, using guidelines published by the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> (FHWA). While another thirteen locations were likely to have similar noise levels as the three sites selected to receive barriers, abatement was not considered at those locations because they did not meet other criteria, including minimum population density. Although OTA was not required to follow FHWA guidelines on the Creek Turnpike because it was not a federally funded project, it opted to do so anyway.

Another letter, dated June 21, 1990, was sent by FWS to USACE, reporting that at least eight <a href="interior%20least%20tern">interior least tern</a>s, an endangered species, had been found on a small island in the Arkansas River approximately south of the site of the proposed turnpike bridge. Although the bridge was not yet under construction at the time, the anticipated eighteen-month period of bridge construction had the possibility of interfering with the terns' nesting period, which runs from mid-May to mid-August. FWS was also in favor of requiring OTA to prepare a full EIS, a process that could have taken up to three years.

Further delays on the Creek Turnpike project appeared inevitable in October 1990, as a new area meeting the federal definition of a wetland was discovered in the path of the turnpike. OTA officials did not bring the area to USACE's attention because they did not believe it met the criteria to be considered a wetland. Frustration mounted after the find; rumors surfaced that OTA was considering canceling the Creek Turnpike and shifting the remaining funds to turnpike projects in the <a href="Oklahoma%20City%2C%20Oklahoma">Oklahoma City</a> area. In an interview after an OTA meeting, chairman <a href="John%20Kilpatrick%20%28politician%29">John Kilpatrick</a> was quoted as saying "God only knows when [the Creek Turnpike will] be completed," describing the project as a "total disaster" and commenting "If we had it all to do over again, we wouldn't do that project." OTA was concerned about the financial impact of USACE's delay in issuing the required permits; each day after the planned opening date that the project ran late added $20,000 (approximately $ in dollars) to the total cost of the project. USACE finally issued the permit on November 15, over a year after OTA applied for it.

One stipulation the USACE placed on the permit, however, was that no work in the Arkansas riverbed could take place after May 1 if it would interfere with the interior least tern nesting period, which was possible if the birds selected nesting sites around the bridge site. As a result, OTA worked to complete the bridge as quickly as possible to avoid the possibility of having to suspend the construction. By April 1991, work in the riverbed was mostly complete, with the remaining work on the bridge posing no threat to the terns.

The possibility of extending the Creek Turnpike beyond its original termini at US-75 and Memorial Drive was raised as early as 1993. On May 28, 1993, Governor <a href="David%20Walters">David Walters</a> announced a proposed $3.1 billion (around $ in dollars) turnpike package, one part of which was the extension of the Creek Turnpike to the Turner Turnpike to the west and the Will Rogers Turnpike in the east. As a result of negotiations between Walters, other lawmakers, and OTA, the package was ultimately pared down to $675 million (about $ in dollars); among the cuts was the eastern extension of the Creek Turnpike. This version of the package was approved by OTA on August 18, 1994. The package was ultimately killed almost two months later, when the Legislative Bond Oversight Commission voted 4–2 to stop the sale of the bonds associated with the project on October 3. Reasons for opposition to the package were varied, including concerns over OTA's debt level, toll increases necessary to fund the package, the state of the bond market, a federal investigation examining previous OTA bond sales, lack of details given about the package, the size of the package, and the proposed method by which the bonds would be sold.

Another Creek Turnpike expansion proposal, connecting it again to the Turner Turnpike in the west, but only extending it as far as the Muskogee Turnpike in the east, was put forward by Walters's successor, Governor <a href="Frank%20Keating">Frank Keating</a>, in 1996. This proposal, accompanied by a proposed extension to the Kilpatrick Turnpike in Oklahoma City, was to be funded by increasing tolls by 10 percent statewide in 1999. Keating's turnpike package, too, encountered trouble from the Legislative Bond Oversight Commission. The body unanimously voted on July 25, 1996, to postpone an up-or-down vote on the projects, which together carried a price tag of $525 million (approximately $ in dollars), until more information was made available to its members. Keating declared the package dead in response to the commission's action.

The Creek Turnpike extensions resurfaced in a 1998 turnpike expansion plan. OTA approved a $724 million (about $ in dollars) bond package at its meeting on January 9, 1998. This package, which carried the support of both Governor Keating and legislative leaders, included a extension of the Creek Turnpike to the Turner and Will Rogers turnpikes, extension of the Kilpatrick Turnpike, and a new toll road which would become the <a href="H.E.%20Bailey%20Turnpike%20Norman%20Spur">H.E. Bailey Turnpike Norman Spur</a>. The plan, which was to be funded by a 15% systemwide toll increase, was approved by both the Legislative Bond Oversight Commission and Executive Bond Oversight Commission on January 29, 1998.

Construction of the portion of the highway between the eastern terminus and the Muskogee Turnpike, known as the Broken Arrow south loop, was scheduled to begin in May 1999 and be completed in January 2001. The section from the Muskogee Turnpike north to the Will Rogers Turnpike was to begin construction in September 1999 and be completed in January 2002. Unlike the section of the turnpike built in the early 1990s, this section was expected to displace few residents; the city of Broken Arrow had purchased much of the right-of-way ahead of time to preserve the corridor for the expected turnpike.

While construction of the other two sections of the turnpike ran according to schedule, progress on the Broken Arrow south loop lagged behind. <a href="Cost%20overrun">Cost overrun</a>s due to higher-than-estimated land acquisition costs caused delays as the project was revised to save money. The project was stalled further by the <a href="1999%20Oklahoma%20tornado%20outbreak">May 3, 1999, tornado outbreak</a>, as utility contractors were pulled off the project to contribute to service restoration efforts in the Oklahoma City area. By August 1999, the south loop was six months behind schedule. Despite the cost-saving measures, the south loop remained over budget by $16 million (around $ in dollars) in July 2000. The western extension was also over budget; OTA discovered over 100 abandoned oil wells that needed to be capped and leftover piping in the turnpike corridor. Budget overruns on the western leg of the turnpike were $5 million (about $ in dollars) in July 2000.

The western extension was the first to open to traffic. Following a brief dedication ceremony attended by Governor Keating, Transportation Secretary McCaleb, and OTA board member Bartlett, the highway opened on December 15, 2000. As with the first section of the turnpike, tolls were waived for the weekend; the road was free until noon on December 18. The south loop was opened in two segments. The first, from US-64/US-169 to South Elm Place in Broken Arrow, opened at 3 p.m. August 15, 2001. The new segment remained toll-free until 7 a.m. August 20. A rainy September pushed back the opening of the other half of the south loop by two months. The second half of the south loop, from Elm Place to New Orleans Street, opened at 2 p.m. April 15, 2002. The final segment of the extension, connecting New Orleans Street and the Muskogee Turnpike to the Will Rogers Turnpike, was scheduled to open on August 16 of that year.

A new interchange at Aspen Avenue in Broken Arrow opened on May 18, 2012. The project was completed three weeks ahead of schedule at a cost of $6.137 million, of which $1.75 million was paid by OTA, with the rest coming from the City of Broken Arrow. The new interchange was expected to attract retail, dining, and entertainment development to the area around the interchange.

A construction project that started in May 2012 expanded the turnpike to six lanes total, or three lanes in each direction, between US-75 and Memorial Drive. Throughout the project, speed limits along the turnpike were reduced to . The project was completed in October 2013.

The Creek Turnpike originally bore no numbered designation. On March 10, 2014, the Oklahoma Transportation Commission unanimously approved a motion to apply the SH-364 designation to the turnpike.

, motorists driving two-axle vehicles, such as cars and motorcycles, pay tolls of $2.80 in cash, or $2.60 if <a href="Pikepass">Pikepass</a> electronic tolling is used, to drive the entire length of the Creek Turnpike. Drivers of vehicles with more than two axles, such as truckers, pay higher tolls; six-axle vehicles are charged rates of $11.50 ($10.65 with Pikepass). Tolls are collected at three mainline toll plazas along the road, one between the US-75 and Peoria–Elm interchanges, one west of the Olive Avenue interchange, and one (labeled as the Creek East plaza) south of the 31st Street South interchange. Additional fares for traveling beyond the barrier tolls are collected at toll gates located at each exit; as at the mainline plazas, Pikepass customers receive a discounted rate at these gates.

The Creek Turnpike is equipped with <a href="open-road%20tolling">open-road tolling</a> for Pikepass customers. The turnpike has been completely automated since early 1996; no human toll collectors are present. Cash customers pull to the right and deposit coins into toll baskets. <a href="Change%20machine">Change machine</a>s capable of changing <a href="United%20States%20one-dollar%20bill">$1</a> and <a href="United%20States%20five-dollar%20bill">$5</a> bills are available, as well as machines that produce receipts for customers requiring them.

Eyes of the Insane

"Eyes of the Insane" is a 2006 song by the American <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a> band <a href="Slayer">Slayer</a>, taken from their 2006 album "<a href="Christ%20Illusion">Christ Illusion</a>". The lyrics explore an American soldier's mental anguish following his return home from <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">the second Gulf War</a>, and are based on an article entitled "Casualty of War" in "<a href="Texas%20Monthly">Texas Monthly</a>" magazine. "Eyes of the Insane" was written by vocalist <a href="Tom%20Araya">Tom Araya</a> during pre-production for the album. The song was generally well received by critics, and also peaked #15 on the Danish singles charts.

The accompanying <a href="music%20video">music video</a> by the <a href="Iran">Iran</a>ian director Tony Petrossian was recorded in the <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> area in August 2006. The film is presented as a close-up of the soldier's <a href="pupil">pupil</a> and <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a>, which reflect disconcerting images of war-themed horrors, flashbacks of his home, wife and children, and ultimately images of his death. "Eyes of the Insane" was used on the <a href="Saw%20III%20soundtrack">soundtrack</a> to "<a href="Saw%20III">Saw III</a>", and won an award for the Best Metal Performance at the <a href="49th%20Grammy%20Awards">49th Grammy Awards</a>.

While walking through an airport, vocalist Tom Araya picked up a March 2006 issue of "Texas Monthly" with a soldier's helmet on the front cover. Seeing the article "Casualty of War", he was interested enough to purchase a copy. The issue explored the involvement of military personnel from Texas in the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a>, and included a list of Texan soldiers who had died in the conflict. The feature was accompanied by photographs of some of the dead, while a further article dealt with the anguish of surviving soldiers on their return home. Araya later said that the article "blew his mind".

Araya read the article during his flight back to Los Angeles. Pre-production for Slayer's ninth studio album "<a href="Christ%20Illusion">Christ Illusion</a>" had just begun, and the band was about to undertake a three-day rehearsal with producer <a href="Josh%20Abraham">Josh Abraham</a>. Araya left his baggage at the hotel to attend the rehearsals, then returned to re-read the article. Finding it to be "very profound", he woke up in the middle of the night and wrote down the lyrics. He said that his treatment of the topic is "sincere", and that he believes it to be "one that the military doesn't want you to know. They sweep it under the rug, but it's a story that needs to be told." The band's guitarist, <a href="Kerry%20King">Kerry King</a>, has said that "these new songs [from the "Christ Illusion" album] aren't political at all: '<a href="Jihad%20%28song%29">Jihad</a>', 'Eyes of the Insane' — it's what's spewing out at us from the TV."

"Eyes of the Insane" is 3 minutes 23 seconds long. A slow drum pattern played by <a href="Dave%20Lombardo">Dave Lombardo</a> opens the track, over which Hanneman and King play angular and descending <a href="Musical%20scale">scale</a>s on guitar. These guitar riffs evolve from verse to verse, and have been described by <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> as "intensely harrowing". The song gradually builds over the course of the <a href="Verse%20%28popular%20music%29">verse</a>s, refrain and <a href="Bridge%20%28music%29">bridge</a>, before <a href="Resolution%20%28music%29">resolving</a> with a "towering" chorus.

Some reviewers paid particular attention to Araya's vocal contribution. Zach Hothorn of "Prefix" magazine said the song "allows Araya to show his vocal range, deepening to build up tension and creating a wonderfully chilling 3 and a half minutes", while Ian Robinson of <a href="musicOMH">musicOMH</a> felt the track "is a distinct but welcome change of pace, Dave Lombardo's machine-gun rhythms forming the backbone for Tom Araya's impressively intact scream."

By the time Slayer decided that a music video should be filmed, touring commitments prevented their involvement in the actual shoot. Instead, others were contacted to produce the film. Director <a href="Tony%20Petrossian">Tony Petrossian</a> presented Slayer with the first draft, and the group made a few suggestions for improvement. Never having met him, King recalled Petrossian "had a treatment, and we all dug the treatment so we just turned him loose." "Eyes of the Insane"'s war-themed music video was filmed on August 13, 2006, in the Los Angeles area. Casting company Tolley Casparis Casting sought a male Caucasian between the ages of 18 and 26 to appear in the clip, with auditions held on August 10, 2006. The official project notes deemed that "This guy must be a serious actor, capable of emoting everything through his eyes. He was innocent a few months ago, now he is scarred by seeing so much fighting. Strong eyebrows that do not overpower the face. Scars or large veins actually a plus."
The video was shot as a "first-person narrative about the horrors leading up to the final moments of a soldier at war", and was described as "a single, long and tight <a href="close-up">close-up</a> of the soldier's eye with images clearly reflected within his pupil and iris and perfectly choreographed with the rhythm of the music. Reflected are disconcerting images of para trooping into enemy territory, gunfire, helicopters and tanks, explosions, poignant flashbacks of his wife and child and home, and the images of his death." Two endings were shot; one in which the soldier is killed as the result of sustained combat wounds, and another in which the soldier commits <a href="suicide">suicide</a> by <a href="hanging">hanging</a> - the latter one was used. <a href="Jeff%20Hanneman">Jeff Hanneman</a> confirmed that the band "loved" the eye concept, and personally felt that the video was "pretty amazing" when he first viewed it. King admitted that the film is "pretty cool — I thought it was neat idea — very different, especially for us, because we usually do performance based videos." The video was exclusively posted on <a href="mp3.com">mp3.com</a> late in October 2006. In 2007, the video earned a <a href="Metal%20Hammer%20Golden%20Gods%20Awards">Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards</a> nomination for Best Video, but eventually lost to <a href="Avenged%20Sevenfold">Avenged Sevenfold</a>'s "Seize The Day."

Critics were generally positive when reviewing "Eyes of the Insane". "<a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus</a>" magazine's Cosmo Lee described the track as "a dark, midpaced exploration of a soldier's psyche", and remarked that "it's memorable and would be a good breather between the usual barnburners". Peter Atkinson of "<a href="KNAC">KNAC.com</a>" felt that "'Eyes of the Insane' offers a post-traumatic sequel to 'Mandatory Suicide', again with a soundtrack that recalls the original, but boasting a couple truly mammoth hooks that do shake things up." Don Kaye of "<a href="Blabbermouth">Blabbermouth</a>" made a comparison to a different Slayer track than Atkinson, and commented that "'Eyes of the Insane' and 'Catatonic' both have that slow, grinding feeling of doom that the band has done so well before on classics like '<a href="Dead%20Skin%20Mask">Dead Skin Mask</a>'."

The song was nominated for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Metal%20Performance">Best Metal Performance</a> at the <a href="49th%20Grammy%20Awards">49th annual Grammy Awards</a>. When asked for his thoughts on the nomination, King revealed that he did not "even care", and noted that Slayer fans "don't give a shit and that's the most important thing to me". The interviewer expressed his surprise at the nomination given Slayer's "inflammatory" lyrics, to which King replied, "That would be the coolest thing, you know? To win with the shit we write about." The ceremony was held on February 11, 2007, at the <a href="Staples%20Center">Staples Center</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, with Slayer competing against <a href="Mastodon%20%28band%29">Mastodon</a>, <a href="Lamb%20of%20God%20%28band%29">Lamb of God</a>, <a href="Ministry%20%28band%29">Ministry</a> and <a href="Stone%20Sour">Stone Sour</a>. Slayer won the <a href="Best%20Metal%20Performance">Best Metal Performance</a> Grammy award, although the band was unable to attend because of a conflicting North American headlining tour. Araya commented about the win from a hotel room in <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>: "Jeff [Hanneman] and I put a lot into 'Eyes of the Insane' so we're thrilled that the Grammy voters took the time to listen to it, and then vote for it. We're out here on the road and we're all really, really happy." King disagreed, deeming the song "one of the poorest representations of us [Slayer] on the record ["Christ Illusion"]". He further said that, if given the decision, he would have chosen the controversial track "<a href="Jihad%20%28song%29">Jihad</a>" to represent Slayer from their ninth album "Christ Illusion". Critical of the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Recording%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Recording Academy</a>, King said, "Realistically, I think people on the academy who vote pick the household name ... And that's what we are."

The <a href="Saw%20III%20soundtrack">soundtrack</a> to the 2006 horror film "<a href="Saw%20III">Saw III</a>" included "Eyes of the Insane", and was released on October 24, 2006, by <a href="Warcon%20Enterprises">Warcon Enterprises</a>. The track was one of six songs performed by Slayer during their first US network television appearance on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC-TV</a>'s "<a href="Jimmy%20Kimmel%20Live%21">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a>" (January 19, 2007), and was the only song broadcast in its entirety.
However, King dislikes playing "Eyes of the Insane" live, commenting, "It's just dull to play, good song just dull to play on guitar."

History of Arsenal F.C. (1886–1966)

The history of Arsenal Football Club between 1886 and 1966 covers the time from the club's foundation, through the first two major periods of success (the 1930s, and the late 1940s and early 1950s, respectively) and the club's subsequent decline to mid-table status in the 1960s.

<a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal Football Club</a> was founded in 1886 as a munition workers' team from <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a>, then in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, now southeast <a href="London">London</a>. They turned professional in 1891 and joined <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> two years later. They were promoted to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> in 1904 but financial problems meant they were liquidated and reformed. They were bought out by Sir <a href="Henry%20Norris%20%28businessman%29">Henry Norris</a> that year and to improve the club's financial standing, he moved the team to <a href="Arsenal%20Stadium">Arsenal Stadium</a>, <a href="Highbury">Highbury</a>, north London in 1913. After the First World War he arranged for the club's promotion back to the First Division, in controversial circumstances.

It was not until the appointment of <a href="Herbert%20Chapman">Herbert Chapman</a> in 1925 that Arsenal had their first period of major success; Chapman modernised and reformed the club's practices and tactics, and under him and his successor <a href="George%20Allison">George Allison</a> (who took over after Chapman's death in January 1934), Arsenal won five First Division titles and two <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>s in the 1930s. After the Second World War, <a href="Tom%20Whittaker%20%28footballer%29">Tom Whittaker</a> continued the success, leading the club to two First Division titles and an FA Cup. After Whittaker's death Arsenal's fortunes gradually declined; by 1966, they were in mid-table obscurity and had not won a trophy in thirteen years. This led to the dismissal of <a href="Billy%20Wright%20%28footballer%20born%201924%29">Billy Wright</a> as manager in 1966, and with it the appointment of <a href="Bertie%20Mee">Bertie Mee</a>, who would go on to turn around the club's fortunes.

Arsenal were founded as Dial Square in 1886 by a group of workers employed by the Dial Square workshop at the <a href="Royal%20Arsenal">Royal Arsenal</a>, an <a href="arsenal">armaments factory</a> in <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a> (formally part of the new County of London from 1889). They were led by a Scotsman, <a href="David%20Danskin">David Danskin</a>, who purchased the club's first <a href="Football%20%28association%20football%29">football</a>, and <a href="Jack%20Humble">Jack Humble</a>. Among their number was the former <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a> <a href="Fred%20Beardsley">Fred Beardsley</a>, who would later along with <a href="Morris%20Bates">Morris Bates</a> obtain a set of red kits from his old club, thus giving Arsenal the colours they still wear today.

Dial Square played their first match on 11 December 1886 against Eastern Wanderers on an open field on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Dogs">Isle of Dogs</a>, which they won 6–0. The club were renamed "Royal Arsenal" soon after, reportedly on Christmas Day. Initially the club played on <a href="Plumstead%20Common">Plumstead Common</a>, but soon sought alternative homes, firstly the Sportsman Ground in <a href="Plumstead">Plumstead</a> before moving to the adjacent <a href="Manor%20Ground%20%28Plumstead%29">Manor Ground</a> in 1888. Unhappy with the Manor Ground's poor facilities, the club moved to the nearby <a href="Invicta%20Ground">Invicta Ground</a> in 1890, before returning to the Manor Ground three years later as the Invicta Ground's rent proved too expensive.

During this period, Royal Arsenal started to win local trophies, winning both the <a href="Kent%20Senior%20Cup">Kent Senior Cup</a> and <a href="London%20Charity%20Cup">London Charity Cup</a> in <a href="1889%E2%80%9390%20in%20English%20football">1889–90</a> and the <a href="London%20Senior%20Cup">London Senior Cup</a> in <a href="1890%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football">1890–91</a>; they also entered the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for the first time in 1889–90. However, the gulf between Arsenal and the professional sides from <a href="Northern%20England">the North</a> soon became apparent, and Arsenal faced the threat of their amateur players being lured away by the money professional sides could offer; after <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> had played Arsenal in an FA Cup tie in 1891, they attempted to sign two of Arsenal's amateur players on professional contracts.
Royal Arsenal's move to professionalism in 1891 was frowned upon by many of the amateur southern clubs, and they were banned from participating in local competitions by the <a href="London%20Football%20Association">London Football Association</a>. With friendlies and the FA Cup the only matches available for Royal Arsenal, they attempted to set up a southern equivalent of <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a>, but the move failed. The club changed its name to Woolwich Arsenal in 1893 when it formed a limited liability company to raise capital to purchase the Manor Ground. Woolwich Arsenal's future looked bleak until the Football League came to their rescue by inviting them to join in 1893. Arsenal were the first Southern club to enter the League, initially joining the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>; in response, some of the club's amateur players who rejected professionalism and wanted a workers' team to represent just the Royal Arsenal, broke away to form a short-lived alternative side, <a href="Royal%20Ordnance%20Factories%20F.C.">Royal Ordnance Factories</a>.
Woolwich Arsenal played in the Second Division for eleven seasons, and generally occupied mid-table before the appointment of <a href="Harry%20Bradshaw%20%28football%20manager%29">Harry Bradshaw</a> as manager in 1899; Bradshaw and his star signings, including goalkeeper <a href="Jimmy%20Ashcroft">Jimmy Ashcroft</a> (Arsenal's first <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> international) and captain <a href="Jimmy%20Jackson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201875%29">Jimmy Jackson</a>, won promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> in <a href="1903%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">1903–04</a>. However, Bradshaw moved on to <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> in May 1904, before the Gunners had kicked a ball in the top flight. Despite some strong performances in the FA Cup – the club reached the semi-finals in <a href="1905%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">1905–06</a> and <a href="1906%E2%80%9307%20in%20English%20football">1906–07</a> – Arsenal were never able to challenge for the League title, only twice finishing above tenth place in the First Division between 1904 and 1913.

The cause of this decline was the club's ongoing financial problems; despite the boom in football during the early 20th century, the club's geographic isolation, in the relatively underpopulated area of Plumstead (then on the outskirts of urban London), meant attendances and thus income were low. To stay afloat, Woolwich Arsenal were forced to sell their star players (including Ashcroft, as well as <a href="Tim%20Coleman">Tim Coleman</a> and <a href="Bert%20Freeman">Bert Freeman</a>), and slowly started to slip down the table, which compounded their financial situation as crowds fell. By the end of the decade the average attendance at Manor Ground was 11,000, a little over half of what it had been in 1904. The club were close to bankruptcy, and in 1910 went into voluntary liquidation before being bought out by a consortium of businessmen; the largest shareholder amongst the new owners was the property magnate <a href="Henry%20Norris%20%28businessman%29">Sir Henry Norris</a>, who was also the chairman of <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>.

Norris was acutely aware of the problems associated with Woolwich Arsenal's location, and was desperate to improve the club's income. First, Norris tried to merge Woolwich Arsenal with his other club, Fulham. When that was blocked by the Football League, Norris abandoned the merger and looked to move the club elsewhere, eventually picking a site in <a href="Highbury">Highbury</a>, north London. Despite objections both from Woolwich-based fans and residents of Highbury, Norris tenaciously saw the move through. He reportedly spent £125,000 ( Historic Opportunity cost of that project is £12,530,000,
Labour cost of that project is £42,450,000,
Economic cost of that project is £88,070,000) on building the new stadium, designed by <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a>, on a <a href="divinity%20%28academic%20discipline%29">divinity</a> college's playing fields. Woolwich Arsenal moved there in the 1913 <a href="close%20season">close season</a>, having finished bottom and relegated to the Second Division in <a href="1912%E2%80%9313%20in%20English%20football">1912–13</a>. They replaced the "Woolwich" in their name with "The" in April 1914, finally becoming plain "Arsenal" in November 1919, although the press at the time continued to refer to them as "The Arsenal" and some still do. The move to Highbury brought about much larger crowds; the average attendance in Arsenal's first season at the new ground was 23,000 (compared to 11,000 at the Manor Ground) and rose further after promotion in 1919, finally warding off the spectre of financial ruin.

The club controversially rejoined the First Division in 1919, despite only finishing sixth in <a href="1914%E2%80%9315%20in%20English%20football">1914–15</a>, the last season of competitive football before the First World War had intervened — although an error in the calculation of <a href="goal%20average">goal average</a> meant Arsenal had actually finished fifth, an error which was corrected by the Football League in 1975. The First Division was being expanded from 20 teams to 22, and the two new entrants were elected at an <a href="annual%20general%20meeting">AGM</a> of the Football League. On past precedent the two places would be given to the two clubs that would otherwise have been relegated, namely <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> and <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>. Instead one of the extra places was awarded to Chelsea - who had been the victims of a betting controversy - and a ballot was called for the remaining place. The candidates included 20th-placed <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> and, from the second division, <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a> (who had finished third); <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolves</a>, (fourth); Birmingham (fifth later amended to sixth); Hull City (seventh); and Nottingham Forest (eighteenth).

The League voted to promote sixth-placed Arsenal, for reasons of history over merit; Norris argued that Arsenal be promoted for their "long service to league football", having been the first League club from the South. The League board agreed; Arsenal received 18 votes, Tottenham 8. Barnsley 5, Wolves 4 with a further 6 votes shared between the other clubs.

According to Soar and Tyler, the announcement of the vote seemed to catch all the clubs, except Arsenal, unawares and the affair is a major contributing factor to the rivalry which has fuelled the long-standing enmity between the two North London clubs. There is also an inconsistency in the argument - if "long service to league football" was the criterion for promoting Arsenal instead of Tottenham then <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolves</a>, who finished two points ahead of Arsenal and were founder members of the Football League, would appear to have a stronger claim. It has been alleged that this was due to backroom deals or even outright bribery by Sir Henry Norris, colluding with his friend <a href="John%20McKenna">John McKenna</a>, the chairman of <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> and the Football League, who recommended Arsenal's promotion at the AGM.

No conclusive proof of wrongdoing has come to light, though other aspects of Norris's financial dealings unrelated to the promotion controversy have fuelled speculation on the matter; Norris resigned as chairman and left the club in 1929, having been found guilty by the Football Association of financial irregularities; he was found to have misused his expenses account, and to have pocketed the proceeds of the sale of the Arsenal team bus. Regardless of the circumstances of their promotion in 1919, Arsenal have remained in the top division since then, and as a result hold the English record for the longest unbroken stretch of top-flight football.

There appear to be no extant records of the meetings which elected Arsenal to the First Division in 1919, however the book "Making the Arsenal" proposes a different reason for their election in that year. The site argues that the match fixing issues of the final year of football before the war (1914–15) were used by Norris as a weapon in his battle to get Arsenal promoted. He demanded that Liverpool and Manchester United (some of whose players had been found guilty of match fixing) be punished by relegation or expulsion, and threatened to organise a breakaway from the league by Midlands and southern clubs if nothing was done. To placate him the League offered Arsenal a place in the First Division.

The club's return to the First Division was not immediately successful. Under <a href="Leslie%20Knighton">Leslie Knighton</a>, the club never finished better than ninth, and in <a href="1923%E2%80%9324%20in%20English%20football">1923–24</a> came close to returning to the Second Division, finishing 19th and only a point clear of the relegation zone. Arsenal did no better <a href="1924%E2%80%9325%20in%20English%20football">the following season</a>, finishing 20th (although paradoxically the club were a lot safer this time, being seven points clear of the relegation places), which was the last straw for Norris; he fired Knighton in May 1925, and appointed the <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> manager, <a href="Herbert%20Chapman">Herbert Chapman</a> in his place.

Chapman reformed many of the club's practices, including modernising the training and physiotherapy regimes, adding numbers to the players' shirts in August 1928, and changing the team's colours, adding white sleeves to the red shirt in March 1933. Chapman also insisted on journalists dropping the <a href="definite%20article">definite article</a> from the club's name, becoming just "Arsenal", and he successfully campaigned for the renaming of the local <a href="London%20Underground">Tube</a> station, <a href="Gillespie%20Road">Gillespie Road</a>, to <a href="Arsenal%20tube%20station">Arsenal</a>. At the same time, Chapman had a large transfer budget by virtue of Arsenal's improved revenue from their new stadium and a change of heart from Henry Norris; previously a highly prudent chairman, Norris now dictated that there was to be heavy spending on new players. This led to Arsenal becoming known as the <a href="Bank%20of%20England%20club">Bank of England club</a>.

Chapman's first signing was veteran <a href="Charlie%20Buchan">Charlie Buchan</a> from <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>; as well as his contributions on the pitch, Buchan would play an important part off it. After Arsenal were beaten 7–0 by <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> in October 1925, Buchan suggested a change to the formation to adapt to a relaxation of the <a href="Offside%20%28association%20football%29">offside law</a>, adjusting Arsenal's <a href="formation%20%28association%20football%29">formation</a> to the "<a href="Formation%20%28association%20football%29%23WM">WM</a>", strengthening the defence by pushing the <a href="centre%20half">centre half</a> back into defence and the <a href="full-back%20%28association%20football%29">full-back</a>s out to the wings. Over time, Chapman developed the formation further, putting an emphasis on a pacey forward line, <a href="winger%20%28sports%29">winger</a>s cutting inside, and the role of a creative ball-playing <a href="midfield">midfield</a>er.

Arsenal came second in Chapman's <a href="1925%E2%80%9326%20in%20English%20football">first season</a>, their best finish at that time, but this proved to be a false dawn; for the next few seasons they stayed in mid-table as Chapman took his time to assemble his side, slotting new signings such as winger <a href="Joe%20Hulme">Joe Hulme</a>, forward <a href="Jack%20Lambert%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201902%29">Jack Lambert</a> and defenders <a href="Tom%20Parker%20%28footballer%29">Tom Parker</a> and <a href="Herbie%20Roberts">Herbie Roberts</a> into his new formation. In <a href="1926%E2%80%9327%20in%20English%20football">1926–27</a>, Arsenal reached their first FA Cup final, only to <a href="1927%20FA%20Cup%20Final">lose 1–0</a> to <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a>, after Arsenal's goalkeeper <a href="Dan%20Lewis%20%28footballer%29">Dan Lewis</a> let a harmless-looking shot slip through his arms and into the net; it was the only occasion in history that the FA Cup has been won by a club from outside England.

Chapman was not deterred, and continued to build his side, signing future captain <a href="Eddie%20Hapgood">Eddie Hapgood</a>, as well as three of the club's great attacking players, <a href="David%20Jack">David Jack</a>, <a href="Alex%20James%20%28footballer%29">Alex James</a> and <a href="Cliff%20Bastin">Cliff Bastin</a>; it was especially Alex James, Arsenal's playmaker in midfield, supplying the forward line and wingers, who became celebrated as the engine of the team. Three years after their first Cup final, in <a href="1929%E2%80%9330%20in%20English%20football">1929–30</a>, Arsenal reached Wembley again, this time up against Chapman's old club Huddersfield Town. <a href="1930%20FA%20Cup%20Final">The match</a> was notable for being "buzzed" by the enormous German airship "<a href="LZ%20127%20Graf%20Zeppelin">Graf Zeppelin</a>". Arsenal were not distracted from their task; they won 2–0 with goals from James and Lambert to bring home the club's first major trophy.

On 30 August 1930, Arsenal helped create a new attendance record of 28,723 at Blackpool's <a href="Bloomfield%20Road">Bloomfield Road</a> ground. They helped set it again over the next two seasons with crowds of 29,576 and 30,218.

Their FA Cup success was the first in a decade in which Arsenal were the dominant club in England. They won the First Division for the first time in <a href="1930%E2%80%9331%20in%20English%20football">1930–31</a>; Arsenal performed strongly in a free-scoring title race with <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, recording several heavy wins (including 7–1 against <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a>, 7–2 v <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a>, and 9–1 v <a href="Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.">Grimsby Town</a>, which remains a club record for the top flight). Arsenal won the title with two games to spare, and finished the season having scored 127 league goals (another club record), though Aston Villa managed to score 128, which is still a record for the most goals in an English top flight season.
The following season, <a href="1931%E2%80%9332%20in%20English%20football">1931–32</a>, Arsenal reached the FA Cup final again, <a href="1932%20FA%20Cup%20Final">losing controversially</a> to <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>. Arsenal had led 1–0 with a <a href="Bob%20John">Bob John</a> goal, but Newcastle's equaliser came after a long ball had gone over the goal line, and out for a goal kick; Newcastle winger <a href="Jimmy%20Richardson">Jimmy Richardson</a> nevertheless crossed the ball back into play and <a href="Jack%20Allen%20%28footballer%20born%201903%29">Jack Allen</a> levelled the match for the Magpies; Allen scored again in the second half to win the match 2–1. Arsenal's pain was compounded by the fact that <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> had pipped them to the League title; a poor start to the <a href="1931%E2%80%9332%20in%20English%20football">1931–32</a> campaign meant Arsenal played catch-up for most of the season, finishing two points adrift.

Arsenal bounced back <a href="1932%E2%80%9333%20in%20English%20football">the following season</a>, winning their second League title. Arsenal had started the season weakly, but then went on a long winning run to catch up and then overtake fellow title challengers Aston Villa, whom they beat 5–0 at Highbury in April to clinch the title. By this time Chapman's first set of signings had started to show their age so with an eye to the future Chapman promoted <a href="George%20Male">George Male</a> to the first team to replace Tom Parker, and signed <a href="Ray%20Bowden">Ray Bowden</a> to take over from David Jack. The only blot on the club's record was an infamous loss to <a href="Walsall%20F.C.">Walsall</a> of the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North">Third Division North</a> in the FA Cup; five of the first team were out with injury or flu and had their place taken by reserves, and without them Arsenal lost 2–0 in one of the greatest FA Cup upsets of all time. One of the stand-ins, <a href="Tommy%20Black%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201908%29">Tommy Black</a>, was particularly to blame (conceding a <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty</a> for Walsall's second), and was sold by an enraged Chapman to <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a> within a week of the result; another, striker <a href="Charlie%20Walsh%20%28footballer%29">Charlie Walsh</a>, was transferred to <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a> a week later.

Arsenal had started the <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20in%20English%20football">1933–34</a> season solidly, but in January 1934 Herbert Chapman died suddenly from <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. Despite this, under <a href="caretaker%20manager">caretaker manager</a> <a href="Joe%20Shaw%20%28footballer%20born%201883%29">Joe Shaw</a> Arsenal retained the title that season; Hulme and James were both out with injury for a large portion, and so Arsenal were not the attacking side they had been the previous season, scoring only 75 in the League, compared with 118 in 1932–33.

<a href="George%20Allison">George Allison</a> (who had formerly been a director of the club) took over the job of team manager in summer 1934 and soon signed new blood for the side, including wing halves <a href="Jack%20Crayston">Jack Crayston</a> and <a href="Wilf%20Copping">Wilf Copping</a> (whose signings had been initiated by Chapman), and striker <a href="Ted%20Drake">Ted Drake</a>. With these new signings, Allison oversaw the completion of a <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> of League titles in <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20in%20English%20football">1934–35</a>, and Arsenal were back to their attacking best; Drake scored a club record 42 league goals that season and Arsenal racked up a series of heavily one-sided scorelines reminiscent of the 1930–31 season (including 7–0 "v." <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolves</a>, 8–1 "v." <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, and 8–0 twice, "v." <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> and "v." <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a>). Such was Arsenal's strength that in November 1934, seven players that started for the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> side that beat <a href="Football%20World%20Cup">World Champions</a> <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italy</a> 3–2 (in the so-called "<a href="Battle%20of%20Highbury">Battle of Highbury</a>") were on Arsenal's books, a record number of players from a single club, which still stands today.

Arsenal's ongoing success attracted larger and larger crowds. Arsenal's home, Highbury, was completely redeveloped, with Leitch's stands from 1913 demolished and replaced with modern <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> stands, parts of which remain to this day — the façade of the East Stand is now a Grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>, and both façades have been retained as part of the modern-day redevelopment of Highbury into an <a href="apartment%20complex">apartment complex</a>. Meanwhile, the North Bank and Clock End terraces had roofs installed. The new stadium saw its largest attendance, 73,295, on 9 March 1935 for a match against <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>.

Arsenal's dominance of the decade was sealed with a second FA Cup in <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20in%20English%20football">1935–36</a>, <a href="1936%20FA%20Cup%20Final">winning 1–0</a> against <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> with a goal from Drake. Arsenal faded in the League somewhat after the 1934–35 title, and were weakened by the retirement of Alex James and the club's inability to replace him, as well as long-term injuries to several other key players such as Herbie Roberts and Joe Hulme. Nevertheless, they won a fifth League title in <a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20in%20English%20football">1937–38</a>, pipping <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolves</a> on the final day of the season, to cap off a highly successful decade.

Soon after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, all first-class football in Britain was suspended, and the <a href="1939%E2%80%9340%20in%20English%20football">1939–40</a> Football League season annulled. Highbury was requisitioned as an <a href="Air%20Raid%20Precautions">ARP</a> station, with a <a href="barrage%20balloon">barrage balloon</a> operating behind the Clock End. During <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a>, a bomb fell on the North Bank, destroying the roof and setting fire to the scrap that was being stored on the terrace. With Highbury closed, Arsenal instead played their home matches at <a href="White%20Hart%20Lane">White Hart Lane</a>, home of their rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Wartime matches do not count in official statistics; competitions were played on a regional basis and teams often did not complete a full season; many footballers served in the armed forces as trainers or instructors and were away from their clubs for long periods of time, so they would often star as "guests" at other clubs. Arsenal won the <a href="Football%20League%20War%20Cup">Football League War Cup South</a> in <a href="1942%E2%80%9343%20in%20English%20football">1942–43</a> and the London or Southern league titles in <a href="1939%E2%80%9340%20in%20English%20football">1939–40</a>, <a href="1941%E2%80%9342%20in%20English%20football">1941–42</a> and <a href="1942%E2%80%9343%20in%20English%20football">1942–43</a>. Participation in the London League led to their expulsion from The Football League in 1941 along with 14 other clubs; it was not until April 1942 when they were readmitted after expressing regret and paying a £10 fine.

In November 1945, with league competition still suspended, Arsenal were one of the teams that played a <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Moscow">Dynamo Moscow</a> side touring the UK. With many players still serving abroad in the armed forces, Arsenal were severely depleted and used six guest players, including <a href="Stanley%20Matthews">Stanley Matthews</a> and <a href="Stan%20Mortensen">Stan Mortensen</a>, which led Dynamo to declare they were playing an <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> XI, although three of the side were actually Welsh. In any case, Dynamo themselves had <a href="Vsevolod%20Bobrov">Vsevolod Bobrov</a> on loan from <a href="PFC%20CSKA%20Moscow">CDKA Moscow</a>. The match, at White Hart Lane, kicked off in thick fog and the slick and technically proficient Dynamo won 4–3, after Arsenal had led 3–1 at half-time.

Though the score is generally agreed upon, after that accounts of the match diverge; even the identity of the goalscorers is disputed. English reports alleged Dynamo fielded twelve players at one point, and tried to pressurise the referee into abandoning the match when they had been behind; in turn, the Soviets accused Arsenal of persistent foul play and even alleged George Allison had bet money on the result (a claim that was later retracted). The acrimony after the match was such that it inspired <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a> to write his 1945 essay "The Sporting Spirit", in which he famously opined on the <a href="sportsmanship">nature of sport</a>, namely that in his view "it is war minus the shooting". With the fog obscuring much of the action, not to mention the language barriers and the early-<a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> mutual suspicion between both sides, it is unlikely any reliable account of the match will emerge.

The war had claimed the lives of nine Arsenal first team players, the most of any top flight club, and the intervening time had cut short the careers of several others, including Bastin and Drake. Additionally, the debts from the construction of Highbury and the costs of repairing war damage were a heavy financial burden, and Arsenal struggled at first when competitive football resumed in 1946. They lost 6–1 on <a href="aggregate%20score">aggregate</a> to <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> in the third round of the <a href="1945%E2%80%9346%20in%20English%20football">1945–46</a> FA Cup, and upon the league's resumption in <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20in%20English%20football">1946–47</a> the club finished 13th, their worst in 17 years. George Allison decided to retire from football at the end of that season, and was replaced by his assistant <a href="Tom%20Whittaker%20%28footballer%29">Tom Whittaker</a>, a long-time servant of the club who had been trainer under Chapman.

Whittaker enjoyed immediate success, winning the League title in <a href="1947%E2%80%9348%20in%20English%20football">1947–48</a>; led by captain <a href="Joe%20Mercer">Joe Mercer</a>'s strong defence and with goals from attacking front two of <a href="Reg%20Lewis">Reg Lewis</a> and <a href="Ronnie%20Rooke">Ronnie Rooke</a>, Arsenal were top of the table from October until the season's climax, winning by a seven-point margin. However, given the age of the Arsenal side at the time (Rooke and Mercer were both over thirty, as were <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis</a> and <a href="Leslie%20Compton">Leslie Compton</a>), long-term success was not possible. In response, Whittaker had brought in younger players such as <a href="Doug%20Lishman">Doug Lishman</a>, <a href="Alex%20Forbes">Alex Forbes</a> and <a href="Cliff%20Holton">Cliff Holton</a>. Although Arsenal were unable to sustain any challenges for the League title, with the new blood they won the FA Cup in <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20in%20English%20football">1949–50</a>, with Reg Lewis scoring both goals in <a href="1950%20FA%20Cup%20Final">a 2–0 win</a> over Liverpool.

The <a href="1951%E2%80%9352%20in%20English%20football">1951–52</a> season saw the club nearly win the Double, but ultimately end up empty-handed; a series of injuries and a fixture pile-up at the end of the season saw Arsenal lose their last two matches, including the title decider against eventual champions <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28football%29">Old Trafford</a> on the last day of the season; after losing 6–1, the Gunners finished third, equal on points with Tottenham. A week later, Arsenal played Newcastle United in the <a href="1952%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1952 FA Cup Final</a>, with several recovering players rushed back into the first team; <a href="Walley%20Barnes">Walley Barnes</a> was taken off injured with a twisted knee after 35 minutes (no <a href="substitute%20%28soccer%29">substitute</a>s were allowed then), and ten-man Arsenal suffered further injuries to Holton, <a href="Don%20Roper">Roper</a> and <a href="Ray%20Daniel%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29">Daniel</a>, so that by the end of the match they had only seven fit players on the pitch; with the numerical advantage in their favour, Newcastle won 1–0 with a goal from <a href="George%20Robledo">George Robledo</a>.

Despite the disappointment of the previous season, Arsenal won their seventh League title in <a href="1952%E2%80%9353%20in%20English%20football">1952–53</a>; in one of the closest title races, they beat <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> to the title on <a href="goal%20average">goal average</a> after finishing level on points. The title looked to be Preston's after Arsenal lost to them 2–0 at <a href="Deepdale">Deepdale</a> in the penultimate game of the season, but Arsenal came from behind to beat <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> 3–2, to take the title on 0.099 of a goal. That proved to be Arsenal's last trophy for seventeen years, as Arsenal's fortunes began to wane, particularly after the unexpected death of Tom Whittaker in October 1956.

As the club's fortunes declined, they found themselves unable to attract many stars (Welsh international goalkeeper <a href="Jack%20Kelsey">Jack Kelsey</a> being a notable exception), while up and coming players such as <a href="David%20Herd%20%28footballer%29">David Herd</a> left for more successful clubs. <a href="Jack%20Crayston">Jack Crayston</a> and <a href="George%20Swindin">George Swindin</a>, both former players, followed Whittaker but could not replicate his success. Apart from finishing third in <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football">1958–59</a> and fifth in both <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20in%20English%20football">1955–56</a> and <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20in%20English%20football">1956–57</a>, Arsenal usually finished in mid-table. Nor did the club have much luck in the FA Cup — after reaching the final in 1951–52, Arsenal would not get beyond the quarter-finals again until <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20in%20English%20football">1970–71</a>. To make matters worse for the club, Tottenham Hotspur won the Double in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20in%20English%20football">1960–61</a>.

In 1962, Arsenal made the bold but ultimately unsuccessful step of appointing former England and Wolves captain <a href="Billy%20Wright%20%28footballer%20born%201924%29">Billy Wright</a> as manager, despite his lack of managerial experience and the fact he had no prior experience with the club. Like his two immediate predecessors, Wright was not very successful, although it was under his leadership that the club made their debut in <a href="UEFA">European</a> competition, in the <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1963–64 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a> after finishing seventh in <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20in%20English%20football">1962–63</a>. In <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20in%20English%20football">his final season</a>, Arsenal finished 14th, their lowest position in 36 years, and recorded the lowest attendance at Highbury — 4,554 in a match against <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> on 5 May 1966. The only Arsenal player to figure in England's <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966 FIFA World Cup</a>-winning squad was <a href="George%20Eastham">George Eastham</a>, who did not play at all during the tournament. Wright was dismissed by the Arsenal board in the summer of 1966, and was replaced by club <a href="physiotherapist">physiotherapist</a> <a href="Bertie%20Mee">Bertie Mee</a>. Though the club's directors did not know it at the time, Mee would turn around the club and lead them to success both in Europe and at home within the next five years.

Pope Paul III and His Grandsons

Pope Paul III and His Grandsons () is a painting in oil on canvas by <a href="Titian">Titian</a>, housed in the <a href="Museo%20di%20Capodimonte">Museo di Capodimonte</a>, <a href="Naples">Naples</a>. It was commissioned by the <a href="House%20of%20Farnese">Farnese</a> family and painted during Titian's visit to Rome between autumn 1545 and June 1546. It depicts the scabrous relationship between <a href="Pope%20Paul%20III">Pope Paul III</a> and his grandsons, <a href="Ottavio%20Farnese%2C%20Duke%20of%20Parma">Ottavio</a> and <a href="Alessandro%20Farnese%20%28cardinal%29">Alessandro</a> Farnese. Ottavio is shown in the act of kneeling, to his left; Alessandro, wearing a cardinal's dress, stands behind him to his right. The painting explores the effects of ageing and the manoeuvring behind succession; Paul was at the time in his late seventies and ruling in an uncertain political climate as <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor</a> came into ascendancy.

Paul was not a religious man; he viewed the papacy as a means to consolidate his family's position. He appointed Alessandro as cardinal against accusations of <a href="nepotism">nepotism</a>, fathered a number of illegitimate children, and spent large sums of church money collecting art and antiquities. Around 1545 Charles took the political and military advantage, weakening Paul's hold on the papacy. Aware of the changing tides of influence, Titian abandoned the commission before completion, and for the next 100 years the painting languished unframed in a Farnese cellar.

"Pope Paul III and His Grandsons" ranks as one of Titian's finest and most penetrating works. Although unfinished and less technically accomplished than his "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Pope%20Paul%20III%20%28Titian%29">Portrait of Pope Paul III</a>" of a few years earlier, it is renowned for its rich colouring; the deep reds of the tablecloth and the almost spectral whites of Paul's gown. The panel contains subtle indications of the contradictions in the character of the Pope, and captures the complex psychological dynamic between the three men.

<a href="Pope%20Paul%20III">Alessandro Farnese</a>, as Paul III, was the last of the popes appointed by the ruling <a href="House%20of%20Medici">Medici family</a> of Florence. He was socially ambitious, a careerist and not particularly pious. He kept a concubine, fathered four children out of wedlock and viewed the throne as an opportunity to fill his coffers while he placed his relatives in high positions. A talented and cunning political operator, Paul was precisely the sort of man the Florentines needed to assist them in their defence against French and Spanish threats.

He became pope in 1534 when he was 66 years old, and immediately appointed members of his family to key positions. He anointed his eldest grandson <a href="Alessandro%20Farnese%20%28cardinal%29">Alessandro</a>, the eldest child of his illegitimate son <a href="Pier%20Luigi%20Farnese%2C%20Duke%20of%20Parma">Pier Luigi</a>, cardinal at the age of 14, marking a break with the Farnese tradition of marrying off the first-born to carry on the family name. This move was considered necessary because the next oldest grandson, <a href="Ottavio%20Farnese%2C%20Duke%20of%20Parma">Ottavio</a>, was then just 10 years old; such a young cardinal would have been politically unacceptable. Paul's advanced years meant that the family could ill afford to wait until the younger brother was of age. Thus Alessandro became a <a href="cardinal%20deacon">cardinal deacon</a>; this appointment did not necessitate taking <a href="major%20orders">major orders</a>, but it compelled him to celibacy and to forgo the rights of <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a>, which instead went to Ottavio. Alessandro was to bitterly regret the obligations. Paul appointed Ottavio as <a href="Duke%20of%20Camerino">Duke of Camerino</a> in 1538, and in the same year married him to <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a>'s daughter, Margaret, later <a href="Margaret%20of%20Parma">Margaret of Parma</a>. Both of Paul's grandsons' advancements were widely criticised as evidence of nepotism.
Ottavio's marriage troubled Alessandro; he struggled with the burden of chastity and entertained fantasies of marrying a princess. He resented his younger brother's arrangement; during the wedding ceremony he "became more deathly pale than death itself, and, so they say, is unable to bear this thing, that he, the first-born, should see himself deprived of such splendid status and of the daughter of an Emperor." In 1546 Paul gave Pier Luigi the duchies of <a href="Parma">Parma</a> and <a href="Piacenza">Piacenza</a> as papal fiefs, a highly political move by the pope: in doing so he gave titles and wealth to Pier and appointed a lord who was subservient and owed a debt of gratitude, guaranteeing that the duchies would remain under papal control. At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to <a href="Margaret%20of%20Parma">Margaret of Austria</a> and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.

Titian was a personal friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death. Ottavio excelled as a military commander and was awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Golden%20Fleece">Golden Fleece</a> by the emperor. While the post had been given as a means to strengthen the family position, it did not come without cost. His success bred resentment amongst his family, as he began to see himself unaccountable to Rome.

At the time of the portrait Paul had convinced Alessandro to retain the post, hinting that he would later succeed him as pope – an aspiration that was ultimately frustrated. As Alessandro realised the emptiness of the promise he lost confidence in both his grandfather's word and political credibility.

The painting was commissioned in 1546 after Titian had made a number of portraits of Paul. He had already depicted <a href="Pier%20Luigi%20Farnese%2C%20Duke%20of%20Parma">Pier Luigi</a> and three of his children – Vittoria, Alessandro and <a href="Ranuccio%20Farnese%20%28cardinal%29">Ranuccio</a>. Ottavio was perhaps again portrayed by him in 1552, and most likely commissioned the original Naples panel in Titian's <a href="Dana%C3%AB%20%28Titian%20series%29">Danaë series</a>, although <a href="Lodovico%20Dolce">Lodovico Dolce</a> believed it was Alessandro who had approached Titian.

The artist's reputation was such that he had already been called to Rome a number of times in the early 1540s; first by Cardinal <a href="Pietro%20Bembo">Pietro Bembo</a> and then by the Farnese family. By the mid-1540s Titian was the preferred portraitist for the Farnese. Following a number of earlier portraits of Pier Luigi and Paul, they commissioned a set to mark their ascendancy after Paul's papacy, all of which were – given their political awareness and ambition – clearly intended as public statements on their social elevation. Paul was aware of Titian's influence in Venice, and after 1538 allowed only Titian to portray him.
Titian disliked travelling and refused the offers. When Paul travelled to northern Italy for negotiations with Charles in 1543 he met Titian for the first time and sat for "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Pope%20Paul%20III%20%28Titian%29">Portrait of Paul III without a Cap</a>". Around this time, Titian's son Pomponio decided to enter the clergy, and the painter sought to use his contacts with the papacy to gain a church and lands for him. Working through his contacts with Cardinal Alessandro, he asked that in return for the Farnese portraits Pomponio be granted the abbey of San Pietro in <a href="Colle%20Umberto">Colle Umberto</a>, in grounds bordering Titian's own in <a href="Ceneda%2C%20Italy">Ceneda</a>. Charles respected Titian and so the painter had influence in negotiating with the Farnese. When he received their offers of a commission and invitation to Rome, he made it clear he would only undertake the patronage in return for the grant of the benefice. This was at first rejected, but on 20 September 1544 Titian seemed assured enough to send a message to Cardinal Alessandro that he would visit to "paint Your Honor's illustrious household down to the last cat". Even so, Titian made no move until October of the following year. When he did finally arrive in Rome, he was treated as the most important guest to the city and given an apartment at the Belvedere. In the end the portrait was not completed. Probably once the benefice was granted, he no longer felt there was any reason to remain in Rome and abandoned the composition.

The portrait depicts the tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an anxious and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy relationship between the Pope and his suitors. The pope is old, ill and tired and, to some critics' eyes, glares at Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or "<a href="camauro">camauro</a>" cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his long nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the <a href="Portrait%20of%20Pope%20Paul%20III%20%28Titian%29">second Naples portrait</a> of 1543. This fact is reinforced by the clock placed on the table beside him, which serves both as a "<a href="memento%20mori">memento mori</a>" and a reminder that time is running out. Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.

Nevertheless, Paul retains elements of a powerful and alert patriarch. The painting is set at a curious angle, so that although Paul is positioned low in the pictorial space, the viewer still looks upwards towards him as if in respect. He is dressed in full pomp, wearing wide fur-lined sleeves (a typical Venetian device to convey status), and his cape is laid across his upper body to suggest physical presence.

The work is often compared to <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>'s "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Leo%20X%20%28Raphael%29">Pope Leo X with Cardinals</a>" of 1518–19 and the 1511–12 portrait of <a href="Portrait%20of%20Pope%20Julius%20II%20%28Raphael%29">Julius II</a> for its colouring and psychological dynamic. Titian follows the older master in some respects, emphasising the pope's age and showing him in a naturalistic, rather than reverential, setting, but Titian goes further: while Raphael's portraits show a high-minded and introspective pope, Titian presents his subject glaring outwards, caught in a moment of fearful but ruthless calculation. His piercing glare has been described by art historian Jill Dunkerton as having captured his "small bright eyes, but ... missed his genius".

The canvas is dramatically divided in two by a diagonal line separated by colour and tone. The lower two-thirds are dominated by heavy red and white pigments; browns and whites are prominent in the upper right-hand section. This division is delineated by a diagonal reaching from the upper edge of the curtain down to Ottavio's leggings in the right mid-ground. Other echoes of the colours and patterns include the red of Paul's robes against the velvet of his chair and the overhanging curtain. This dramatic colour and luminosity can be in part attributed to this design, and to the manner in which Titian reverses the usual painterly technique in building tone: he began with a dark background, then layered the lighter hues before the darker passages. The effect has been described as a ""tour de force" of symphonic colourism", and a high point of his blending of red and ochre pigments. Titian uses a variety of brushstrokes. While the pope's robes are painted with very broad strokes, his cape ("<a href="mozzetta">mozzetta</a>"), ageing face and visible hand were captured in minute detail with thin brushes, with his hairs rendered at the level of individual strands.
Ottavio, shown as tall and muscular, is about to kneel to kiss the Pope's feet, a contemporary manner of greeting a pope: a guest would make three short bows followed by the kissing of the papal feet. Titian indicates this step in the ceremony by showing Paul's shoe decorated with a cross, poking from underneath his gown. Ottavio's head is bowed, but his stern facial expression conveys that he is acting as protocol dictates, rather than with genuine diffidence. <a href="Nicholas%20Penny">Nicholas Penny</a> notes that "... at a Renaissance court bowing and scraping were usual. This affects modern attitudes to [the portrait], making the cordial respect of youth seem like the obsequiousness of a crafty courtier."

The grandsons are depicted in very different styles: Alessandro acts in a formal manner and wears clothes of similar colour and tones to Paul. Ottavio, by contrast, wears the browns of the upper right-hand passage, an area of the painting that cuts him physically from the pope. His pose is awkward and difficult to interpret, but he is rendered in a more naturalistic manner than his brother. Alessandro has a distracted, brooding expression. He holds the knob of Paul's backrest, in an echo of Raphael's portrait where <a href="Clement%20VII">Clement VII</a> holds the chair of <a href="Leo%20X">Leo X</a> as an indicator of his ambitions of succession. Thus Alessandro seems better placed politically, standing to Paul's right in a pose that recalls traditional depictions of <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul the Apostle</a>, and his hand is raised as if in blessing. In the end, Paul was unable to influence his succession after Charles V weakened the Medici hold on the office.

The work is unfinished; a number of details, most noticeably the pope's right hand, are missing. Other passages are bland and uniform, with some key areas still blocked by the underdrawing. Many of Titian's characteristic finishing touches are missing; Paul's fur-lined sleeves do not contain the polishing white strokes of the 1543 portrait, or his usual final overglaze or glossing.

Although the work is often thought of as an unflattering and cold look at an ageing pope besieged by cunning and opportunistic relatives, the reality is more complex and the artist's intention more subtle. It is certainly a very unguarded portrait of one of the most powerful men of his day, and in stark contrast to Titian's two earlier portraits of Paul, both of which were deferential. It is widely accepted as one of the most politically difficult portrait commissions in art history, requiring an understanding of the interplay of relationships with a depth "worthy of Shakespeare", in the opinion of art historians Rodolfo Pallucchini and <a href="Harold%20Wethey">Harold Wethey</a>. However, it was one Titian seems to have resolved; while the complexity of the relationships is all on the canvas, it may have been intended as an indicator to Charles that Paul retained his position as the dominant patriarch – old and frail but still a man of vitality, and in control of his squabbling descendants.

Moreover, working under commission from the Farnese family, Titian would not have sought to portray the sitters in an obviously unsympathetic manner. While Paul is shown as old and frail, he is given a broad chest and cunning eyes that indicate his intelligence and guile. Ottavio is presented as cold and impervious, but this was probably a device to show his strength of character and conviction. Alessandro is favoured by his positioning closest to the Pope, yet x-ray analysis reveals he had originally stood to the left of the pope and was moved, probably on request by Alessandro himself, to a position where his hand was resting on the papal throne, indicating his claim on the papacy.

Titian abandoned the painting before completion and for the next hundred years it was kept unframed and unhung in a Farnese cellar. Alessandro's large collection of art and antiques, which included the Titian portraits commissioned by Paul, was eventually inherited by <a href="Elisabetta%20Farnese">Elisabetta Farnese</a> (1692–1766). Elisabetta, who married <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Spain">Philip V of Spain</a> in 1714, passed on the collection to her son <a href="Charles%20III%20of%20Spain">Carlos</a>, who became <a href="Duke%20of%20Parma">Duke of Parma</a> and later King of Spain. In 1734, he <a href="War%20of%20the%20Polish%20Succession">conquered the kingdoms</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sicily">Sicily</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Naples">Naples</a>, and the collection was transferred to Naples. In 1738 Carlos built the <a href="Palace%20of%20Capodimonte">Palace of Capodimonte</a>, which includes the <a href="Museo%20di%20Capodimonte">Museo di Capodimonte</a>, in part to house the Farnese art collection. The painting remains there today, hanging in the Farnese Gallery section. The Museo di Capodimonte was designated a national museum in 1950.

Rodrigues starling

The Rodrigues starling ("Necropsar rodericanus") is an <a href="extinct">extinct</a> <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="starling">starling</a> that was <a href="endemic">endemic</a> to the <a href="Mascarene">Mascarene</a> island of <a href="Rodrigues">Rodrigues</a>. Its closest relatives were the <a href="Mauritius%20starling">Mauritius starling</a> and the <a href="hoopoe%20starling">hoopoe starling</a> from nearby islands; all three appear to be of Southeast Asian origin. The bird was only reported by French sailor <a href="Julien%20Tafforet">Julien Tafforet</a>, who was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. Tafforet observed it on the offshore <a href="islet">islet</a> of <a href="%C3%8Ele%20Gombrani">Île Gombrani</a>. <a href="Subfossil">Subfossil</a> remains found on the mainland were described in 1879, and were suggested to belong to the bird mentioned by Tafforet. There was much confusion about the bird and its taxonomic relations throughout the 20th century.

The Rodrigues starling was long, and had a stout beak. It was described as having a white body, partially black wings and tail, and a yellow bill and legs. Little is known about its behaviour. Its diet included eggs and dead tortoises, which it processed with its strong bill. Predation by rats introduced to the area was probably responsible for the bird's extinction some time in the 18th century. It first became extinct on mainland Rodrigues, then on Île Gombrani, its last refuge.

In 1725, the French sailor <a href="Julien%20Tafforet">Julien Tafforet</a> was marooned on the <a href="Mascarene">Mascarene</a> island of <a href="Rodrigues">Rodrigues</a> for nine months, and his report of his time there was later published as "Relation d'île Rodrigue". In the report, he described encounters with various indigenous species, including a white and black bird which fed on eggs and dead tortoises. He stated that it was confined to the offshore islet of <a href="%C3%8Ele%20Gombrani">Île Gombrani</a>, which was then called au Mât. <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Leguat">François Leguat</a>, a Frenchman who was also marooned on Rodrigues from 1691 to 1693 and had written about several species there (his account was published in 1708), did not have a boat, and therefore could not explore the various islets as Tafforet did. No people who later traveled to the island mentioned the bird. In an article written in 1875, the British ornithologist <a href="Alfred%20Newton">Alfred Newton</a> attempted to identify the bird from Tafforet's description, and hypothesised that it was related to the extinct <a href="hoopoe%20starling">hoopoe starling</a> ("Fregilupus varius"), which formerly inhabited nearby <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a>.

<a href="Subfossil">Subfossil</a> bones of a starling-like bird were first discovered on Rodrigues by the <a href="police%20magistrate">police magistrate</a> <a href="George%20Jenner">George Jenner</a> In 1866 and 1871, and by the reverend <a href="Henry%20Horrocks%20Slater">Henry Horrocks Slater</a> in 1874. They were found in caves on the Plaine Coral, a <a href="limestone">limestone</a> plain in south-west Rodrigues. These bones included the <a href="cranium">cranium</a>, <a href="mandible">mandible</a>, <a href="sternum">sternum</a>, <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a>, <a href="humerus">humerus</a>, <a href="metacarpus">metacarpus</a>, <a href="ulna">ulna</a>, <a href="femur">femur</a>, <a href="tibia">tibia</a>, and <a href="metatarsus">metatarsus</a> of several birds; the bones were deposited in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> and the <a href="Cambridge%20Museum">Cambridge Museum</a>. In 1879, the bones became the basis of a scientific description of the bird by ornithologists <a href="Albert%20G%C3%BCnther">Albert Günther</a> and <a href="Edward%20Newton">Edward Newton</a> (the brother of Alfred). They named the bird "Necropsar rodericanus"; "Nekros" and "psar" are Greek for "dead" and "starling", while "rodericanus" refers to the island of Rodrigues. This <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial</a> was originally proposed by Slater in an 1874 manuscript he sent to Günther and Newton. Slater had prepared the manuscript for an 1879 publication, which was never released, but Günther and Newton quoted Slater's unpublished notes in their own 1879 article, and credited him for the name. <a href="BirdLife%20International">BirdLife International</a> credits Slater rather than Günther and Newton for the name. Günther and Newton determined that the Rodrigues starling was closely related to the hoopoe starling, and they only kept it in a separate genus due to what they termed "present ornithological practice". Due to the strongly built bill, they considered the new species likely the same as the bird mentioned in Tafforet's account.

In 1900, the English scientist <a href="George%20Ernest%20Shelley">George Ernest Shelley</a> used the spelling "Necrospa" in a book, thereby creating a <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a>; however, he attributed the name to zoologist <a href="Philip%20Sclater">Philip Sclater</a>. In 1967, the American ornithologist <a href="James%20Greenway">James Greenway</a> suggested that the Rodrigues starling should belong in the same genus as the hoopoe starling, "Fregilupus", due to the similarity of the species. More subfossils found in 1974 added support to the claim that the Rodrigues bird was a distinct genus of starling. The stouter bill is mainly what warrants <a href="generic%20separation">generic separation</a> from "Fregilupus". In 2014, the British palaeontologist <a href="Julian%20P.%20Hume">Julian P. Hume</a> described a new extinct species, the <a href="Mauritius%20starling">Mauritius starling</a> ("Cryptopsar ischyrhynchus"), based on subfossils from Mauritius. It was shown to be closer to the Rodrigues starling than to the hoopoe starling, due to the features of its skull, sternum and humerus. Until then, the Rodrigues starling was the only Mascarene <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird named from fossil material.

In 1898, the British naturalist <a href="Henry%20Ogg%20Forbes">Henry Ogg Forbes</a> described a second species of "Necropsar", "N. leguati", based on a skin in the <a href="World%20Museum%20Liverpool">World Museum Liverpool</a>, specimen D.1792, which was labelled as coming from <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. He suggested that this was actually the bird mentioned by Tafforet, instead of "N. rodericanus" from mainland Rodrigues. <a href="Walter%20Rothschild">Walter Rothschild</a>, however, believed the Liverpool specimen to be an <a href="albinistic">albinistic</a> specimen of a "Necropsar" species supposedly from Mauritius. In 1953, Japanese writer <a href="Masauji%20Hachisuka">Masauji Hachisuka</a> suggested that "N. leguati" was distinct enough to warrant its own genus, "Orphanopsar". In a 2005 DNA analysis, the specimen was eventually identified as an albinistic specimen of the <a href="grey%20trembler">grey trembler</a> ("Cinclocerthia gutturalis") from <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a>.

Hachisuka believed the <a href="carnivorous">carnivorous</a> habits described by Tafforet to be unlikely for a starling, and thought the lack of a crest suggested that it was not closely related to "Fregilupus". He was reminded of <a href="corvid">corvid</a>s because of the black-and-white plumage, and assumed the bird seen by Tafforet was a sort of <a href="chough">chough</a>. In 1937, he named it "Testudophaga bicolor", with Testudophaga meaning "tortoise eater", and coined the common name "bi-coloured chough". Hachisuka's assumptions are disregarded today, and modern ornithologists find Tafforet's bird to be identical to the one described from subfossil remains.

In 1987, the British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles prepared a manuscript that described a new species of <a href="Old%20World%20babbler">Old World babbler</a>, "Rodriguites microcarina", based on an incomplete sternum found in a cave on Rodrigues. In 1989, the name was mistakenly published before the description, making it a <a href="nomen%20nudum">nomen nudum</a>. Later examination of the sternum by Hume showed that "Rodriguites microcarina" was identical to the Rodrigues starling.

In 1943, the American ornithologist <a href="Dean%20Amadon">Dean Amadon</a> suggested that "<a href="Sturnus">Sturnus</a>"-like species could have arrived in Africa, and given rise to the <a href="wattled%20starling">wattled starling</a> ("Creatophora cinerea") and the Mascarene starlings. According to Amadon, the Rodrigues and hoopoe starlings were related to Asiatic starlings, such as some species of "Sturnus", rather than the <a href="glossy%20starlings">glossy starlings</a> ("Lamprotornis") of Africa and the <a href="Madagascan%20starling">Madagascan starling</a> ("Saroglossa aurata"); he concluded this based on the colouration of the birds. A 2008 study, which analysed the DNA of various starlings, confirmed that the hoopoe starling was a starling, but with no close relatives among the sampled species.

Extant East Asian starlings, such as the <a href="Bali%20myna">Bali myna</a> ("Leucopsar rothschildi") and the <a href="white-headed%20starling">white-headed starling</a> ("Sturnia erythropygia"), have similarities with these extinct species in colouration and other features. As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem to be more closely related to each other than to the hoopoe starling, which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian starlings, there may have been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings. This is probably due to the isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands.

The Rodrigues starling was large for a starling, being in length. Its body was white or greyish white, with blackish-brown wings, and a yellow bill and legs. Tafforet's complete description of the bird reads as follows:

Tafforet was familiar with the fauna of Réunion, where the related hoopoe starling lived. He made several comparisons between the faunas of different locations, so the fact that he did not mention a crest on the Rodrigues starling indicates that it was absent. His description of their colouration is similar.

Hume notes that the skull of the Rodrigues starling was about the same size as that of the hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible. Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was <a href="sexually%20dimorphic">sexually dimorphic</a>. Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but this may be due to individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.

Günther and Newton noted that the <a href="skull">skull</a> of the Rodrigues starling was shaped somewhat differently and longer than that of the hoopoe starling, being about long from the <a href="occipital%20condyle">occipital condyle</a>; it was also narrower, being wide. The eyes were set slightly lower, and the upper rims of the <a href="eye%20socket">eye socket</a>s were about apart. The <a href="interorbital%20septum">interorbital septum</a> was more delicate, with a larger hole in its centre. The bill was about long, less curved and proportionally a little deeper than in the hoopoe starling. It also seems to have had larger <a href="nostril">nostril</a>s, with the nostril openings in the bone being in length. The mandible was about long and deep <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Proximal%20and%20distal">proximally</a>. The skull had an attachment scar above the <a href="temporal%20fossa">temporal fossa</a>. The <a href="supraoccipital%20ridge">supraoccipital ridge</a> on the skull was quite strongly developed, and a <a href="biventer">biventer</a> muscle attachment in the <a href="Parietal%20bone">parietal</a> region below it was conspicuous. This indicates that the starling had strong neck and jaw muscles.

According to Günther and Newton, the ulna of the Rodrigues starling was somewhat shorter than that of the hoopoe starling, measuring ; the humerus measured , and the keel on its sternum was a bit lower. It had strong <a href="quill%20knob">quill knob</a>s on the ulna, indicating that the secondary <a href="remiges">remiges</a> were well developed. One coracoid measured in length, and one <a href="carpometacarpus">carpometacarpus</a> was long. The leg and feet had the same proportions. The femur measured around , the <a href="tibiotarsus">tibiotarsus</a> , and the <a href="tarsometatarsus">tarsometatarsus</a> .

Little is known about the behaviour of the Rodrigues starling, apart from Tafforet's description, from which various inferences can be made. The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability to gape indicates that it foraged on the ground. Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items. Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct "<a href="Cylindraspis">Cylindraspis</a>" land tortoises, as well as marine turtles, which would have provided a large amount of food for the starling, particularly during the breeding seasons. Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the starling may have also done this. Originally, the Rodrigues starling may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. Tafforet's description also indicates that it had a complex song.

The stouter build and more bent shape of the mandible shows that the Rodrigues starling used greater force than the hoopoe starling when searching and perhaps digging for food. It probably also had the ability to remove objects and forcefully open entrances when searching for food; it did this by inserting its wedge-shaped bill and opening its mandibles, as other starlings and crows do. This ability supports Tafforet's claim that the bird fed on eggs and dead tortoises. It could have torn dead, presumably juvenile, turtles and tortoises out of their shells. Tafforet did not see any Rodrigues starlings on the mainland, but he stated that they could easily be reared by feeding them meat, which indicates that he brought young birds from a breeding population on Île Gombrani. Tafforet was marooned on Rodrigues during the summer and was apparently able to procure juvenile individuals; some other Rodrigues birds are known to breed at this time, so it is likely that the starling did the same.

Many other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem is heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests completely covered the island, but very little remains today. The Rodrigues starling lived alongside other recently extinct birds, such as the <a href="Rodrigues%20solitaire">Rodrigues solitaire</a>, the <a href="Rodrigues%20parrot">Rodrigues parrot</a>, <a href="Newton%27s%20parakeet">Newton's parakeet</a>, the <a href="Rodrigues%20rail">Rodrigues rail</a>, the <a href="Rodrigues%20owl">Rodrigues owl</a>, the <a href="Rodrigues%20night%20heron">Rodrigues night heron</a>, and the <a href="Rodrigues%20pigeon">Rodrigues pigeon</a>. Extinct reptiles include the <a href="domed%20Rodrigues%20giant%20tortoise">domed Rodrigues giant tortoise</a>, the <a href="saddle-backed%20Rodrigues%20giant%20tortoise">saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise</a>, and the <a href="Rodrigues%20day%20gecko">Rodrigues day gecko</a>.

Leguat mentioned that pigeons only bred on islets off Rodrigues, due to predation from rats on the mainland. This may be the reason why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have either been absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. Rats could have arrived in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. The islets would have been the last refuge for the bird, until the rats colonised them, too. The Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist <a href="Alexandre%20Guy%20Pingr%C3%A9">Alexandre Guy Pingré</a> visited Rodrigues during the French <a href="Transit%20of%20Venus%231761%20and%201769">1761 Transit of Venus expedition</a>.

The large populations of tortoises and marine turtles on Rodrigues resulted in the export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are adept at crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. At least five species of "<a href="Aplonis">Aplonis</a>" starlings have become extinct in islands of the Pacific Ocean, and rats also contributed to their demise.

Harry McNish

Henry McNish (11 September 187424 September 1930), often referred to as Harry McNeish or by the nickname Chippy, was the carpenter on Sir <a href="Ernest%20Shackleton">Ernest Shackleton</a>'s <a href="Imperial%20Trans-Antarctic%20Expedition">Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition</a> of 1914–1917. He was responsible for much of the work that ensured the crew's survival after their ship, the "<a href="Endurance%20%281912%20ship%29">Endurance</a>", was destroyed when it became trapped in pack ice in the <a href="Weddell%20Sea">Weddell Sea</a>. He modified the small boat, "<a href="Voyage%20of%20the%20James%20Caird">James Caird</a>", that allowed Shackleton and five men (including McNish) to make a voyage of hundreds of miles to fetch help for the rest of the crew.

After the expedition he returned to work in the <a href="Merchant%20Navy%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Merchant Navy</a> and eventually emigrated to <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, where he worked on the docks in <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a> until poor health forced his retirement. He died destitute in the Ohiro Benevolent Home in Wellington.

Harry "Chippy" McNish was born in 1874 in the former Lyons Lane near the present site of the library in <a href="Port%20Glasgow">Port Glasgow</a>, <a href="Renfrewshire">Renfrewshire</a>, Scotland. He was part of a large family, being the third of eleven children born to John and Mary Jane (née Wade) McNish. His father was a <a href="journeyman">journeyman</a> <a href="shoemaker">shoemaker</a>. McNish held strong socialist views, was a member of the <a href="United%20Free%20Church%20of%20Scotland">United Free Church of Scotland</a> and detested bad language. He married three times: in 1895 to Jessie Smith, who died in February 1898; in 1898 to Ellen Timothy, who died in December 1904; and finally to Lizzie Littlejohn in 1907.

There is some confusion as to the correct spelling of his name. He is variously referred to as McNish, McNeish, and in <a href="Alexander%20Macklin">Alexander Macklin</a>'s diary of the expedition, MacNish. The McNeish spelling is common, notably in Shackleton's and <a href="Frank%20Worsley">Frank Worsley</a>'s accounts of the expedition and on McNish's headstone, but McNish is also widely used, and appears to be the correct version. On a signed copy of the expedition photo his signature appears as "H. MacNish", but his spelling is in general idiosyncratic, as revealed in the diary he kept throughout the expedition. There also is a question regarding McNish's nickname. "Chippy" was a traditional nickname for a <a href="Shipbuilding">shipwright</a>; both this and the shorter "Chips" (as in wood chips from carpentry) seem to have been used.

The aim of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition was to be the first to cross the <a href="Antarctic">Antarctic</a> <a href="continent">continent</a> from one side to the other. McNish was apparently attracted by Shackleton's advertisement for the expedition (although there are doubts as to whether the advertisement ever appeared):

McNish, at 40, was one of the oldest members of the crew of the "Endurance" (Shackleton though was seven months older). He suffered from <a href="Hemorrhoid">piles</a> and <a href="rheumatism">rheumatism</a> in his legs. He was regarded as somewhat odd and unrefined, but also highly respected as a carpenter—<a href="Frank%20Worsley">Frank Worsley</a>, the captain of the "Endurance", refers to him as a "splendid shipwright". The pipe-smoking Scot was, however, the only man of the crew that Shackleton was "not dead certain of". His Scots accent was described as rasping like "frayed cable wire".

During the initial stage of the voyage to Antarctica from <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, he was kept busy with a number of routine tasks. He worked on the pram dinghy "Nancy Endurance"; made a small chest of drawers for Shackleton; specimen shelves for the biologist, <a href="Robert%20Clark%20%28zoologist%29">Robert Clark</a>; instrument cases for <a href="Leonard%20Hussey">Leonard Hussey</a>, the meteorologist; and put up wind screens to protect the helmsman. He constructed a false deck, extending from the poop-deck to the chart-room to cover the extra coal that the ship had taken on board. He also acted as the ship's barber. As the ship pushed into the pack ice in the <a href="Weddell%20Sea">Weddell Sea</a> it became increasingly difficult to navigate. McNish constructed a six-foot wooden semaphore on the bridge to enable the navigating officer to give the helmsman directions, and built a small stage over the stern to allow the propeller to be watched in order to keep it clear of the heavy ice.

When the ship became trapped in pack ice his duties expanded to constructing makeshift housing, and, once it became clear that the ship was doomed, to altering the sledges for the journey over the ice to open water. He built the quarters where the crew took their meals (nicknamed "The Ritz") and cubicles where the men could sleep. These were all christened as well; McNish shared "The Sailors' Rest" with <a href="Alfred%20Cheetham">Alfred Cheetham</a>, the Third Officer. Assisted by the crew, he constructed kennels for the dogs on the upper deck. Once "Endurance" became trapped, and the crew were spending the days on the ice, McNish erected goalposts and <a href="football%20%28soccer%29">football</a> became a daily fixture for the men. To pass the time in the evening, McNish joined <a href="Frank%20Wild">Frank Wild</a>, <a href="Tom%20Crean%20%28explorer%29">Tom Crean</a>, <a href="James%20McIlroy%20%28surgeon%29">James McIlroy</a>, Worsley and Shackleton playing poker in the <a href="wardroom">wardroom</a>.

The pressure from the ice caused "Endurance" to start to take on water. To prevent the ship from flooding McNish built a <a href="cofferdam">cofferdam</a>, <a href="caulking">caulking</a> it with strips of blankets and nailing strips over the seams, standing for hours up to his waist in freezing water as he worked. He could not prevent the pressure from the ice crushing the ship though and was experienced enough to know when to stop trying. Once the ship had been destroyed he was put in charge of rescuing the stores from what had been "The Ritz". With McNish in charge it took only a couple of hours to open the deck far enough to retrieve a good quantity of provisions.

During his watch one night while the crew were camped on the ice, a small part of the <a href="Drift%20ice">ice floe</a> broke away and he was only rescued due to the quick intervention of the men of the next watch who threw him a line allowing him to jump back to safety. Shackleton reported that McNish calmly mentioned his narrow escape the next day after further cracks appeared in the ice. <a href="Mrs%20Chippy">Mrs Chippy</a>, the cat McNish had brought on board, had to be shot after the loss of the "Endurance", as it was obvious he would not survive the harsh conditions. McNish apparently never forgave Shackleton for giving the order.

McNish proposed building a smaller craft from the wreckage of the ship, but was overruled, with Shackleton instead deciding to head across the ice to open water pulling the ship's three lifeboats. McNish had been suffering with piles and homesickness from almost before the voyage had begun, and once the ship was lost his frustration began to grow. He vented his feelings in his diary, targeting his tent-mates' language:
In great pain while pulling sledges across the ice, McNish briefly rebelled, refusing to take his turn in the harness and protesting to Frank Worsley that since the "Endurance" had been destroyed the crew was no longer under any obligation to follow orders. Accounts vary as to how Shackleton handled this: some report that he threatened to shoot McNish; others that he read him the ship's articles, making it clear that the crew were still under obligation until they reached port. McNish's assertion would have normally been correct: duty to the master (and pay) normally stopped when a ship was lost, but the articles the crew had signed for the "Endurance" had a special clause inserted in which the crew agreed "to perform any duty on board, in the boats, or on the shore as directed by the master and owner". Aside from this, McNish really had no choice but to comply: he could not survive alone and could not continue with the rest of the party unless he obeyed orders. Eventually, Shackleton decided that the attempt to pull the boats had been a mistake, and decided that the only solution was to wait for the movement of the ice to bring the party to open water.

As supplies began to dwindle the party grew hungry. McNish records that he smoked himself sick trying to alleviate the pangs of hunger and although he thought the shooting of the dogs terribly sad, he was happy to eat the meat they provided stating "Their flesh tastes a treat. It is a big treat for us after being so long on <a href="seal%20meat">seal meat</a>."

When the ice finally brought the camp to the edge of the pack ice, Shackleton decided that the three boats, the "James Caird", "Stancomb Wills", and "Dudley Docker", should make initially for <a href="Elephant%20Island">Elephant Island</a>. McNish had prepared the boats as best he could for a long journey in the open ocean, building up their sides to give them a higher <a href="Freeboard%20%28nautical%29">clearance</a> from the water.

On the sea journey to <a href="Elephant%20Island">Elephant Island</a>, McNish was in the "<a href="James%20Caird%20%28boat%29">James Caird</a>" with Shackleton and <a href="Frank%20Wild">Frank Wild</a>. As they approached the island, Wild, who had been at the tiller for 24 hours straight, was close to collapse, so Shackleton ordered McNish to relieve him. McNish was not in a much better state himself and, despite the terrible conditions, he fell asleep after half an hour. The boat swung around and a huge wave drenched him. This was enough to wake him, but Shackleton, seeing McNish too was exhausted, ordered him to be relieved.

After the crew had made it to Elephant Island, Shackleton decided to take a small crew and make for <a href="South%20Georgia%20Island">South Georgia</a>, where there was a possibility that they would find crews from the whaling ships to help effect a rescue for the rest of the men. McNish was called upon by Shackleton to make the "James Caird" seaworthy for the long voyage and was selected as part of the crew, possibly because Shackleton was afraid of the effect he would have on morale if left behind with the other men. For his part, McNish seemed happy to go; he was unimpressed by the island and the chances of survival for the men overwintering there:
McNish used the mast of another of the boats, the "Stancomb Wills", to strengthen the keel and build up the small 22 foot (6.7 m) long boat, so it would withstand the seas during the 800 mile (1480 km) trip. He caulked it using a mixture of seal blood and flour, and, using wood and nails taken from packing cases and the runners of the sledges, he built a makeshift frame which was then covered with canvas. Shackleton was worried the boat "bore a strong likeness to stage scenery", only giving the appearance of sturdiness. He later admitted that the crew could not have lived through the voyage without it.
When launching the boat McNish and <a href="John%20Vincent%20%28sailor%29">John Vincent</a> were thrown from the deck into the sea. Although soaked, both were unharmed, and managed to exchange some clothes with the Elephant Island party before the "James Caird" set off. The mood on board was buoyant and McNish recorded in his diary on 24 April 1916:
The mood did not last though: conditions aboard the small craft during the trip were terrible, with the crew constantly soaked and cold. McNish impressed Shackleton with his ability to bear up under the strain (more so than the younger Vincent, who collapsed from exhaustion and cold). The six men split into two watches of four hours: three of the men would handle the boat while the other three lay beneath the canvas decking attempting to sleep. McNish shared a watch with Shackleton and Crean. All the men complained of pains in their legs and, on the fourth day out from Elephant Island, McNish suddenly sat down and removed his boots, revealing his legs and feet were white and puffy with the early signs of <a href="trench%20foot">trench foot</a>. On seeing the state of McNish's feet Shackleton ordered all the men to remove their boots.

The crew of the "James Caird" reached South Georgia on 10 May 1916, 15 days after setting out from Elephant Island. They landed in <a href="Cave%20Cove">Cave Cove</a> on <a href="King%20Haakon%20Bay">King Haakon Bay</a>; it was on the wrong side of the island, but it was a relief for all of them to make land; McNish wrote in his diary:

They found <a href="albatross">albatross</a> chicks and seals to eat, but despite the relative comfort of the island compared to the small boat, they still urgently needed to reach the whaling station at <a href="Husvik">Husvik</a> on the other side of the island to fetch help for the men on Elephant Island. It was clear that McNish and Vincent could not continue, so Shackleton left them in the care of <a href="Timothy%20McCarthy%20%28sailor%29">Timothy McCarthy</a> camped in the upturned "James Caird", and with Worsley and Crean made the hazardous trip over the mountains. McNish took screws from the "James Caird" and attached them to the boots of the men making the journey to help them grip the ice. He also fashioned a crude sledge from driftwood he found on the beach, but it proved too clumsy to be practical. When Shackleton's party set off on 18 May 1916, McNish accompanied them for a few hundred yards but he was unable to go any further. He shook hands with each of the men, wished them good luck and then Shackleton sent him back. Putting McNish in command of the remaining men, Shackleton charged him to wait for relief and if none had come by the end of winter to attempt to sail to the east coast. Once Shackleton's party had crossed the mountains and arrived in Husvik, he sent Worsley with one of the whaler's ships, "Samson", to pick up McNish and the other men. After seeing the emaciated and drawn McNish on his arrival at the whaling station, Shackleton recorded that he felt that the rescue had come just in time for him.

Whatever the true story of the rebellion on the ice, neither Worsley nor McNish ever mentioned the incident in writing. Shackleton omitted it entirely from "South", his account of the expedition, and referred to it only tangentially in his diary: "Everyone working well except the carpenter. I shall never forget him in this time of strain and stress". The event was recorded in the ship's log, but the log entry was struck during the sea voyage in the "James Caird", Shackleton being impressed by the carpenter's show of "grit and spirit". Nevertheless, McNish's name appeared on the list of the four men not recommended for the Polar Medal in the letter sent by Shackleton on his return. Macklin thought the denial of the medal unjustified:

Macklin believed that Shackleton may have been influenced in his decision by Worsley who shared a mutual enmity with McNish, and had accompanied Shackleton back from Antarctica. Members of the <a href="Scott%20Polar%20Research%20Institute">Scott Polar Research Institute</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand%20Antarctic%20Society">New Zealand Antarctic Society</a> and Caroline Alexander, the author of "Endurance", have criticised Shackleton's denial of the award to McNish, and there is an ongoing campaign to have him awarded the medal posthumously.

After the expedition McNish returned to the Merchant Navy, working on various ships. He often complained that his bones permanently ached due to the conditions during the journey in the "James Caird"; he would reportedly sometimes refuse to shake hands because of the pain. He divorced Lizzie Littlejohn on 2 March 1918, by which time he had already met his new partner, Agnes Martindale. McNish had a son named Tom and Martindale had a daughter named Nancy. Although she is mentioned frequently in his diary, it appears McNish was not Nancy's father.

He spent 23 years in the Navy in total during his life, but eventually secured a job with the New Zealand Shipping Company. After making five trips to New Zealand he moved there in 1925, leaving behind his wife and all of his carpentry tools. He worked on the waterfront in <a href="Wellington%2C%20New%20Zealand">Wellington</a> until his career was ended by an injury. Destitute, he would sleep in the wharf sheds under a tarpaulin and relied on monthly collections from the dockworkers. He was found a place in the Ohiro Benevolent Home, but his health continued to deteriorate.

He died on 24 September 1930 in <a href="Wellington%20Hospital%2C%20New%20Zealand">Wellington Hospital</a>. He was buried in <a href="Karori%20Cemetery">Karori Cemetery</a>, Wellington, on 26 September 1930, with full naval honours; "<a href="HMS%20Dunedin">HMS Dunedin</a>" (which happened to be in port at the time) provided twelve men for the firing party and eight bearers. However, his grave remained unmarked for almost thirty years; the New Zealand Antarctic Society (NZAC) erected a headstone on 10 May 1959. In 2001, it was reported that the grave was untended and surrounded by weeds, but in 2004, the grave was tidied and a life size bronze sculpture of McNish's beloved cat, Mrs Chippy, was placed on his grave by NZAC. His grandson, Tom, believes this tribute would have meant more to him than receiving the Polar Medal.

In 1958, the <a href="British%20Antarctic%20Survey">British Antarctic Survey</a> named a small island in his honour, McNeish Island, which lies in the approaches to King Haakon Bay, South Georgia. The island was renamed <a href="McNish%20Island">McNish Island</a> in 1998 after his birth certificate was presented to the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Antarctic%20Place-Names%20Committee">United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee</a>.

On 18 October 2006, a small, oval wall plaque commemorating his achievements was unveiled at the Port Glasgow Library in his home town, and earlier in the same year he was the subject of an exhibition at the <a href="McLean%20Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery">McLean Museum and Art Gallery</a>, <a href="Greenock">Greenock</a>. His journals are held in the <a href="Alexander%20Turnbull%20Library">Alexander Turnbull Library</a> in Wellington, New Zealand.

b. There was little doubt as to his skill as a shipwright even before he was called upon for the modifications to the boats. He was never seen to take measurements, producing perfect work by eye. Macklin commented that all the work he did was first class, and even <a href="Thomas%20Orde-Lees">Thomas Orde-Lees</a>, who disliked him, grudgingly admitted he was an "expert wooden ship's man".

c. "Mrs" Chippy was discovered to be a male a month after the voyage started, but by that time the name had stuck.

d. "Wife" in this source probably refers to Agnes Martindale, who was his partner but not his wife. McNish was already divorced by this time.

USS Siboney (ID-2999)

USS "Siboney" (ID-2999) was a <a href="ship%20transport">ship transport</a> for the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. She was the sister ship of but neither was part of a ship class. <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">Launched</a> as SS "Oriente, she was soon renamed after <a href="Siboney%2C%20Cuba">Siboney</a>, <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, a landing site of <a href="United%20States">United States</a> forces during the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>. After her navy service ended, she was SS "Siboney for the <a href="New%20York%20%26amp%3B%20Cuba%20Mail%20Steamship%20Co.">New York & Cuba Mail Steamship Co.</a> (commonly called the Ward Line). The ship was operated under charter by <a href="American%20Export-Isbrandtsen%20Lines">American Export Lines</a> beginning in late 1940. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> she served the <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> as transport USAT "Siboney and as <a href="hospital%20ship">hospital ship</a> USAHS "Charles A. Stafford.

As a transport during World War I, "Siboney" made 17 <a href="transatlantic%20crossing">transatlantic</a> voyages for the navy carrying troops to and from <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, and had the shortest average in-port turnaround time of all navy transports. During her maiden voyage, her steering gear malfunctioned which resulted in a collision between two other troopships in the convoy.

After her World War I service ended, "Siboney" was returned to the Ward Line and placed in New York–Cuba–Spain transatlantic service; the liner ran aground at <a href="Vigo">Vigo</a>, Spain in September 1920. Despite considerable damage, she was repaired and placed back in service. In late 1921, "Siboney" was switched to New York–Cuba–Mexico routes, which were a popular and inexpensive way for Americans to escape <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a>. In late 1940, she was <a href="charter">charter</a>ed to American Export Lines to return Americans fleeing Europe at the outset of World War II, making seven roundtrips from <a href="Jersey%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Jersey City</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, to <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>.
During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, "Siboney" was requisitioned by the <a href="War%20Shipping%20Administration">War Shipping Administration</a> (WSA) and assigned to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> as a U.S. Army transport. She made several transatlantic trips and called at ports in <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. During a 1944 overhaul, the ship was selected for conversion to a hospital ship. Renamed USAHS "Charles A. Stafford" after a U.S. Army doctor killed in action in Australia, the ship served in both the <a href="European%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">European</a> and the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific Theatre</a>s. After the end of her army service, the ship was laid up in the <a href="National%20Defense%20Reserve%20Fleet">National Defense Reserve Fleet</a> in February 1948, and sold for scrapping in 1957.

SS "Oriente" was a combination cargo and passenger vessel built by <a href="William%20Cramp%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">William Cramp & Sons</a>, <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, for the Ward Line. In mid-1917 the <a href="United%20States%20Shipping%20Board">United States Shipping Board</a> (USSB) commandeered and received title to all private shipbuilding projects in progress, including the still-incomplete "Oriente" and her sister ship "Orizaba". Plans for both ships were modified for troop carrying duties. "Oriente" was launched on 15 August 1917, renamed "Siboney" on 28 February 1918, delivered to the navy on 8 April, and commissioned the same day, <a href="Commander%20%28United%20States%29%23Naval%20rank">Commander</a> A.T. Graham in command.
"Siboney" sailed from Philadelphia on 16 April as a unit of the <a href="Cruiser%20and%20Transport%20Force">Cruiser and Transport Force</a>, and arrived at <a href="Newport%20News%2C%20Virginia">Newport News</a> two days later to embark her first contingent of troops. She departed <a href="Hampton%20Roads%2C%20Virginia">Hampton Roads</a> on 23 April and joined her first convoy the following day. On 25 April, her rudder jammed; and, in the ensuing confusion, transports and collided and had to return to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>. On 4 May, the convoy was joined by the war zone escort of eight destroyers and, on 6 May, "Siboney" arrived at <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a>. Debarking her troops, she sailed the following day and arrived at <a href="Hoboken%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hoboken, New Jersey</a>, on 15 May.

"Siboney" embarked her second contingent of troops at <a href="Lambert%27s%20Point">Lambert's Point</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, on 25 May and sailed the following day. The New York section of the convoy joined two days later and the ships entered the war zone on 6 June. In French waters, they were met by , a squadron of <a href="minesweeper%20%28ship%29">minesweepers</a>, an American <a href="dirigible">dirigible</a>, and two <a href="French%20Navy">French</a> <a href="seaplane">hydroplane</a>s. "Siboney" arrived in <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> on 8 June and departed the following day but remained anchored in the mouth of the <a href="Gironde%20estuary">Gironde</a> until 13 June, awaiting the tanker "Woonsocket". On 15 June, the convoy passed six empty lifeboats from the torpedoed transport . "Siboney" entered the American war zone on 20 June, and the next day rescued survivors of the British vessel, , which had been torpedoed three days previously. The transport arrived at New York on 22 June and anchored in the North River.

"Siboney" sailed for France on 30 June; after delivering her troops at Brest on 12 July, she returned to New York on 25 July. She sailed again on 31 July. Before arriving at Brest on 12 August, she had to maneuver several times to evade possible submarine contacts. She arrived at New York on 22 August and was given a two-week repair period.

On 4 September, "Siboney" sailed from New York on her fifth crossing and arrived at <a href="Saint-Nazaire">Saint-Nazaire</a> nine days later. On 15 September, she embarked a number of wounded troops and left Saint-Nazaire the same day, but, due to heavy submarine activity, swung at anchor for several days before her convoy sailed. She arrived on 29 September at New York. On her sixth eastward crossing, between 6 and 15 October, an <a href="Spanish%20flu">influenza epidemic</a> broke out among the troops, killing a number of soldiers. Sailing from Brest on 16 October, the transport returned to New York on 24 October.

"Siboney" had already embarked troops for her next voyage when, on 3 November, she was ordered to disembark them. She sailed the following day with an army <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a> and his staff, and a naval draft of 500 men. She arrived at Saint-Nazaire on the 12 November, shortly after the announcement of the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany%20%28Compi%C3%A8gne%29">Armistice</a>, and was met by a cheering crowd.
"Siboney" then began her peacetime mission of returning American veterans from Europe to the United States. After embarking 513 wounded men at Saint-Nazaire, she moved to Brest on the 15th and took on 600 more passengers. She sailed the same day under escort and reached New York on 24 November. During the next ten months, "Siboney" made ten more round trips between the United States and France, returning over 3,000 troops per trip when fully loaded. On one such return trip in August 1919, "Siboney" carried Admiral <a href="Henry%20T.%20Mayo">Henry T. Mayo</a> and Congressman <a href="Thomas%20S.%20Butler">Thomas S. Butler</a> home from France.

"Siboney" returned to New York on 2 September at the conclusion of her 17th trip, having traveled over and transported approximately 55,000 military passengers to and from French ports. According to the Statistical Department of the U.S. Navy, "Siboney" had the shortest average in-port turnaround time out of 37 U.S. Navy transports used during World War I. The ship completed 17 round trips and had an average turn-around time of just under 30 days per trip, almost ten days shorter than the average of 39.8 days.

On 10 September at Hoboken, "Siboney" was decommissioned and turned over to the War Department, who returned the ship to the Ward Line, her original owners.

After her reacquisition, the Ward Line placed SS "Siboney" in transatlantic service on a New York to <a href="Havana">Havana</a>, <a href="Tenerife">Tenerife</a>, <a href="Bilbao">Bilbao</a>, <a href="Santander%2C%20Cantabria">Santander</a>, and <a href="Vigo">Vigo</a> route. On 9 September 1920, the ship ran aground in the harbor at Vigo. Initial efforts to re-float her were unsuccessful, but by late October, "Siboney" had been repaired enough to make it to <a href="South%20Shields">Shields</a>. Despite considerable damage, "Siboney" was refitted and placed in service again and, by March 1921, the Ward Line was advertising passage to Spain via Havana aboard her. The Ward Line, however, abandoned the New York–Cuba–Spain service later in 1921 due to a lack of passengers.

By November 1921, "Siboney" was placed in New York–Cuba–Mexico service, where business thrived, in part because of <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition in the United States</a>. Ward Line cruises to Havana were one of the quickest and least expensive ways to what one author called "alcohol-enriched vacations". A typical route from this time period would sail from New York and call at <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a>, Havana, <a href="Progreso%2C%20Yucat%C3%A1n">Progreso</a>, <a href="Veracruz%2C%20Veracruz">Veracruz</a>, and <a href="Tampico%2C%20Tamaulipas">Tampico</a>, skipping Nassau on the return. Prohibition also had a more direct effect on "Siboney" and her crew. On 27 June 1922, "Siboney" — freshly returned from Havana with a load of pineapples — was raided by <a href="United%20States%20Customs%20Service">United States Customs Service</a> inspectors who seized 300 bottles of smuggled liquor on board. In December 1923, four <a href="Boiler%20room%20%28ship%29">boiler room</a> workers were arrested when police became suspicious of a man who had apparently just delivered a supply of alcohol to the docked ship.

"Siboney" underwent a major refit in 1924 during which time she was replaced on her routes by SS "Yucatán", formerly the <a href="North%20German%20Lloyd">North German Lloyd</a> ship "Prinz Waldemar". After returning to service for the Ward Line, "Siboney" was the first to relay messages from <a href="Miami%2C%20Florida">Miami</a> about the severity of the <a href="1926%20Miami%20hurricane">Great Miami Hurricane</a> when she passed there shortly after the storm hit in September 1926.

On 18 February 1928, "Siboney" rammed and sank the coal barge "Seneca" off <a href="Lightship%20Ambrose">Ambrose Light</a> during a snowstorm; the barge had been cut down in 1915 from SS "Seneca", coincidentally, a former Ward Line ship. Bad luck continued for "Siboney" on 5 January 1929, when she rammed and sank the Bauer Towing Company <a href="tug">tug</a> "Phillip Hoffman" off <a href="Battery%20Park">the Battery</a>, killing the tug's engineer.

"Siboney" continued her same routes into the 1930s, and by 1933 typical runs for "Siboney" were from New York to Havana, Progreso, and Veracruz and back, omitting Progreso on the return. On one such return trip from Veracruz and Havana in April 1935, a passenger had $5,000 worth of diamond and platinum jewelry stolen while on board. By 1935, multiple <a href="public%20relations">public relations</a> disasters for the Ward Line — the fire and sinking of off <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> in 1934 and the grounding of and the sinking of "Mohawk" in the months that followed — caused the "Ward Line" name to be dropped in favor of the "Cuba Mail Line" moniker. By 1939, "Siboney", still on the New York–Cuba–Mexico route, sported a new paint scheme of "dove grey" hull and black funnels with white markings to reflect this change in name. In late 1940, however, the struggling Cuba Mail Line chartered "Siboney" to <a href="American%20Export%20Lines">American Export Lines</a> which employed her on <a href="Jersey%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Jersey City</a>–Lisbon service. During her American Export service, one of her passengers to the U.S. was French aviator and writer <a href="Antoine%20de%20Saint%20Exup%C3%A9ry">Antoine de Saint Exupéry</a>, when he immigrated in January 1941 to <a href="Asharoken%2C%20New%20York">Asharoken, New York</a> after <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a>’s <a href="Armistice%20with%20France%20%28Second%20Compi%C3%A8gne%29">armistice with France</a>.

On 12 April 1941 at 13:30, out of Lisbon, the ship — painted with a large American flag and "American Export" lettering on each side — was accosted by "two <a href="submarine%20chaser">submarine chaser</a>s flying <a href="White%20Ensign">British ensigns</a>" that fired shots over "Siboney"s bow, one of which landed less than away from the ship. According to "Siboney"s captain, Wenzel Habel, the two ships were British corvette types marked "K-25" and "K-125" — which may have been s and . After answering questions from "K-25" shouted via loudspeaker, "Siboney" was allowed to resume her course. Habel filed a protest with British officials when "Siboney" docked at <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>.

At the conclusion of her seventh and final journey for American Export, "Siboney" was placed under time charter for duty as an Army transport. After a hasty outfitting, the redesignated USAT "Siboney" was put to work transporting troops. Based in New York, she made trips up and down the Atlantic and into the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean</a>, and, by the end of 1941, had called at Bermuda, <a href="San%20Juan%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">San Juan</a>, <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, <a href="St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">St. John's</a>, <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a>, <a href="Newport%20News%2C%20Virginia">Newport News</a>, <a href="Crist%C3%B3bal%2C%20Col%C3%B3n">Cristóbal</a>, <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, and <a href="Panama">Panama</a>.

December 1941 saw "Siboney" depart from New York to Trinidad and on to <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, then sailing up the east coast of <a href="Africa">Africa</a> to <a href="Basra">Basra</a>, <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, and <a href="Bandar%20Shahpur">Bandar Shahpur</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>. The ship returned to Cape Town via <a href="Aden">Aden</a> and underwent routine boiler repairs there, before returning to New York in April 1942. After undergoing six weeks of repairs at <a href="Bethlehem%20Shipbuilding%20Corporation">Bethlehem Steel Company</a>, the transport sailed for <a href="City%20of%20Halifax">Halifax</a>, <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>, and the <a href="River%20Clyde">Clyde</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, in late May, returning to New York in July. Another trip to <a href="England">England</a> and back followed in September 1942.

On 1 July 1942 the ship had been acquired by the War Shipping Administration (WSA) under a bareboat charter converting the Army's time charter to a sub bareboat charter. On 9 August 1943 WSA purchased the ship with the Army's bareboat charter continued. 

In early December 1942 "Siboney" departed for <a href="Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Newfoundland</a> but put into Halifax for two months of <a href="drydock">drydock</a>ing and repairs after she collided with SS "City of Kimberly". After returning to New York in February 1943, she made several transatlantic runs, calling at <a href="Casablanca">Casablanca</a>, <a href="Oran">Oran</a>, <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, Clyde, <a href="Durban">Durban</a>, <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, Trinidad, and Cuba over the next 11 months. "Siboney" returned to New York for major repairs and reboilering at Bethlehem Steel Co. In January 1944, while undergoing this work, the ship was selected for conversion to a hospital ship.
The ship was renamed USAHS "Charles A. Stafford" after <a href="Captain%20%28OF-2%29">Captain</a> <a href="Charles%20A.%20Stafford">Charles A. Stafford</a> of the <a href="Army%20Medical%20Department%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. Army Medical Corps</a>, who was killed during the <a href="Attack%20on%20Broome">air raid on Broome, Western Australia</a>, while participating in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Java%20%281942%29">evacuation of Java</a> on 3 March 1942. With her conversion complete in September 1944, the "Stafford", equipped with new boilers, a single stack in place of her original two, and other improvements, moved to her new homeport of Charleston. From that port the ship made monthly runs to the United Kingdom and back until May 1945, interrupting the pattern only once for a trip to Gibraltar and <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a>s. Steaming to New York at the conclusion of her last transatlantic run, "Charles A. Stafford" was overhauled for duty in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20theater%20of%20World%20War%20II">South Pacific</a>.

With the alterations complete, the veteran ship — now homeported at <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles</a> — sailed in August 1945 for Cristobál and on to <a href="Honolulu%2C%20Hawaii">Honolulu</a>, <a href="Manila">Manila</a>, <a href="Biak">Biak</a>, <a href="Leyte">Leyte</a>, and <a href="Mindoro">Mindoro</a>. After returning to Los Angeles in October, the "Stafford" sailed for Honolulu, Manila, and <a href="Enewetak">Eniwetok</a> and back.

After sailing to her new homeport of New York via the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> during February 1946, "Charles A. Stafford" resumed her North Atlantic runs to the UK.

On 30 August 1946 the Army transferred the ship to the <a href="United%20States%20Maritime%20Commission">Maritime Commission</a>. On 16 February 1948 the ship was placed in the <a href="James%20River%20Reserve%20Fleet">James River Reserve Fleet</a>. Kept on reserve under her original name of "Siboney", the ship was sold by the Maritime Administration on 2 January 1957 for $286,125 to Bethlehem Steel for scrapping.

Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca

Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca, commonly known as the false chanterelle, is a species of <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the family <a href="Hygrophoropsidaceae">Hygrophoropsidaceae</a>.
It is found across several continents, growing in woodland and <a href="heathland">heathland</a>, and sometimes on <a href="woodchips">woodchips</a> used in gardening and landscaping. <a href="Basidiocarp">Fruit bodies</a> (<a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s) are yellow–orange with a funnel-shaped <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> up to across that has a felt-like surface. The thin, often forked <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> on the underside of the cap run partway down the length of the otherwise smooth <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>. Reports on the mushroom's <a href="edible%20mushroom">edibility</a> vary – it can serve as food, though not a particularly flavorful one, or it can be mildly <a href="poisonous%20mushroom">poisonous</a>.

Austrian naturalist <a href="Franz%20Xaver%20von%20Wulfen">Franz Xaver von Wulfen</a> described the false chanterelle in 1781, noting both its resemblance with the true <a href="Cantharellus">chanterelles</a> and people's propensity to confuse them. The false chanterelle was then placed in the genus "<a href="Clitocybe">Clitocybe</a>", but it was later observed that its forked gills and <a href="dextrinoid">dextrinoid</a> spores indicated a relationship to "<a href="Paxillus">Paxillus</a>". Genetic analysis has confirmed that it belongs to the order <a href="Boletales">Boletales</a> and is more closely related to <a href="bolete">bolete</a>s.

Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen described the false chanterelle as "Agaricus aurantiacus" in 1781, reporting that it appeared in the <a href="Abies">fir</a> tree forests around <a href="Klagenfurt">Klagenfurt</a> in October. He added that it could be confused with the chanterelle by the inexperienced, but that its true nature was very different; in contrast to its edible lookalike, he described it as "kind of pernicious". The <a href="botanical%20name">specific epithet</a> is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "aurantiacus", meaning "orange". <a href="James%20Sowerby">James Sowerby</a> illustrated it and gave it the name "Agaricus subcantharellus", describing it as a "perhaps unfavourable" variety of "A. cantharellus" (chanterelle). The fungus was placed in the genus "<a href="Merulius">Merulius</a>" by <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a> in 1792, and then "<a href="Cantharellus">Cantharellus</a>" by <a href="Elias%20Fries">Elias Fries</a> in 1821. <a href="Bernhard%20Studer-Steinh%C3%A4uslin">Bernhard Studer-Steinhäuslin</a> concluded it could only be classified in the genus "<a href="Clitocybe">Clitocybe</a>" in 1900, based on its white spores, <a href="decurrent">decurrent</a> gills and lack of a <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a>. It was elevated to the status of genus in Emile Martin-Sans' 1929 publication "L'Empoisonnement par les champignons et particulièrement les intoxications dues aux Agaricacées du groupe des Clitocybe et du groupe des Cortinarius", with authorship attributed to <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Maire">René Maire</a>. Martin-Sans concurred with Maire's assessment of "Hygrophoropsis", suggesting that it represented a form intermediate between "Cantharellus" and "Clitocybe", and was thus worthy of generic ranking. The genus name refers to a resemblance to the genus "<a href="Hygrophorus">Hygrophorus</a>". It is commonly known as the false chanterelle.
Two <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a> described by <a href="Derek%20Reid">Derek Reid</a> in 1972, "H. aurantiaca" var. "macrospora" and "H. aurantiaca" var. "rufa", have since been promoted to distinct species status as "<a href="Hygrophoropsis%20macrospora">H. macrospora</a>" (1996) and "<a href="Hygrophoropsis%20rufa">H. rufa</a>" (2008). Two other varieties of the fungus have been described, but they are not considered to have independent <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> significance by <a href="Index%20Fungorum">Index Fungorum</a>: var. "nana" (Singer 1946), characterized by a small fruit body; and var. "robusta" (Antonín 2000), characterized by a robust fruit body and an odour similar to <a href="Maggi">Maggi</a> seasoning sauce. Pale forms of the fungus are sometimes referred to as var. "pallida". This <a href="taxon">taxon</a> was first published by <a href="Robert%20K%C3%BChner">Robert Kühner</a> and <a href="Henri%20Romagnesi">Henri Romagnesi</a> in 1953, but later considered <a href="validly%20published%20name">invalid</a> as it did not conform to <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Nomenclature%20for%20algae%2C%20fungi%2C%20and%20plants">nomenclatural rules</a>. Variety "nigripes", a taxon with a black-brown <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>, is invalid for similar reasons. "H. aurantiaca" var. "pallida" was published validly in 1995.

In 1979, <a href="Egon%20Horak">Egon Horak</a> suggested that "H. aurantiaca" and the New Zealand taxon "<a href="Hygrophoropsis%20coacta">H. coacta</a>" were the same species, but neither Index Fungorum nor <a href="MycoBank">MycoBank</a> accept this synonymy. According to MycoBank, "H. aurantiaca" has several heterotypic synonyms, that is, they have different <a href="type%20%28biology%29">types</a>, but are considered the same species:

"Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca" has been confused with the true chanterelles (genus "Cantharellus") because of overall similarities in appearance. However, the forked gills, frequently off-centre stipe placement, and <a href="dextrinoid">dextrinoid</a> spores of "H. aurantiaca" suggested a relationship with "<a href="Paxillus">Paxillus</a>", prompting <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a> to classify the genus "Hygrophoropsis" in the family <a href="Paxillaceae">Paxillaceae</a> in 1946. Several <a href="biological%20pigment">pigments</a> have been identified from the fungus, including the orange <a href="variegatic%20acid">variegatic acid</a>, <a href="methyl%20variegate">methyl variegate</a>, the red <a href="variegatorubin">variegatorubin</a>, and several <a href="derivative%20%28chemistry%29">derivatives</a> of <a href="pulvinic%20acid">pulvinic acid</a>. The presence of these pigments suggests a <a href="chemotaxonomy">chemotaxic</a> relationship with the <a href="Boletaceae">Boletaceae</a>, <a href="Coniophoraceae">Coniophoraceae</a>, and Paxillaceae—families of Boletales with members that have similar compounds. <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetic">Molecular phylogenetic</a> analysis confirmed its affinity lay in the order <a href="Boletales">Boletales</a> in 1997, though later research showed it is not closely related to "Paxillus" or other gilled members of the order.

The false chanterelle has a golden-orange <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> up to across, initially convex but becoming funnel-shaped as the mushroom matures. The cap margin, which remains rolled in a little, becomes wavy or lobed in age. The cap surface is covered with a fine down. The <a href="decurrent">decurrent</a> gill-like structures are narrow and forked, which is a distinctive and distinguishing feature. They are generally a more intense shade of orange than the cap. Along the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>, the gills may be slightly crimped. The orange stipe is high and thick, and lacks a <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a>. It often has a darker, brownish, base. The ability to form <a href="sclerotia">sclerotia</a> (compact masses of hardened fungal <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a>) has been documented for "H. aurantiaca" in laboratory studies. These structures contain <a href="glycogen">glycogen</a> and <a href="protein">protein</a> that may be used as food reserves during spore <a href="germination">germination</a>.

The soft, thin <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> ranges from white to yellowish to golden-orange. It has an odour and taste described variously as indistinct, or unpleasant and earthy. The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is white to <a href="cream%20%28colour%29">cream</a>. The oval <a href="basidiospore">spores</a> are 5.5–7 by 4–4.5 <a href="micrometre">micrometre</a>s (µm), with walls that tend to thicken in age. The spores are <a href="cyanophilous">cyanophilous</a>, meaning that they will readily <a href="staining">stain</a> dark blue in <a href="methyl%20blue">methyl blue</a> solution. Staining with <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a> often produces a <a href="dextrinoid">dextrinoid</a> (reddish-brown) colour reaction. <a href="Basidia">Basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells) measure 25–40 by 5–8 µm, and can be two-, three-, or four-spored. <a href="Cystidia">Cystidia</a> (large sterile cells on the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>) are absent. The <a href="cap%20cuticle">cap cuticle</a> is in the form of a trichoderm, where the outermost <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e are roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. These hyphae are 4–15 µm in diameter, and contain intracellular pigments that impart an orange-brown to yellow-brown colouring to the cells. <a href="Clamp%20connection">Clamp connection</a>s are present in the hyphae.

<a href="Teratology">Teratological</a> (developmentally abnormal) forms of "H. aurantiaca" were reported to occur in the United Kingdom. The fruit bodies of these specimens were club-shaped with a wrinkled upper surface of convoluted gill tissue. The overall <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> of these forms somewhat resembles species of "<a href="Clavariadelphus">Clavariadelphus</a>". Although the cause of this abnormal development is not known with certainty, environmental pollutants or <a href="mycovirus">virus</a> infection have been suggested as contributing factors.

Characteristics typically used in the field to distinguish "Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca" from lookalike species include: the soft, dry consistency of its cap; the crowded, decurrent, and forked gills that are <a href="saffron%20%28color%29">saffron</a> to orange coloured; and the lack of any distinctive taste or odour. The false chanterelle can be distinguished from the true chanterelle ("Cantharellus cibarius") by its deeper orange colour, brown base to the stipe, velvety cap surface, forked gills rather than gill-like ridges, softer (and thinner) flesh, and lack of the characteristic apricot-smell. The cap surface of "<a href="Hygrophoropsis%20fuscosquamula">Hygrophoropsis fuscosquamula</a>", found in Britain, has fine brown scales overlaying a dull orange background. "H. rufa" has velvety brown fur covering its cap, while "H. macrospora" has cream gills and stipe. Microscopically, these three species have larger spores than "H. aurantiaca". "<a href="Hygrophoropsis%20tapinia">H. tapinia</a>", found in a range extending from southern <a href="Florida">Florida</a> to Central America, is set apart from "H. aurantiaca" by its growth on or under deciduous trees (never conifers), and smaller spores, which measure 3.3–4.8 by 2.5–3.3 µm.

Formerly a member of "Hygrophoropsis", "<a href="Aphroditeola%20olida">Aphroditeola olida</a>" is also similar in appearance to "H. aurantiaca" but can be distinguished from the false chanterelle by its smaller, pinkish fruit bodies and candy-like odour. It also has smaller spores. "<a href="Chrysomphalina%20chrysophylla">Chrysomphalina chrysophylla</a>" has a yellowish brown cap and unforked yellow gills. "<a href="Cortinarius%20hesleri">Cortinarius hesleri</a>", an eastern North American species that associates with oaks, has a rusty brown spore print and a <a href="partial%20veil">cortina</a> in young specimens. The poisonous <a href="Omphalotus">jack-o'-lantern mushroom</a>s (genus "Omphalotus") comprise another group of lookalikes; however, they have straight, non-forked true gills. The European wood-rotting species "<a href="Haasiella%20splendidissima">Haasiella splendidissima</a>", sometimes confused with "H. aurantiaca", is most readily distinguished from the latter by its pink spore print and gills that do not fork.

"Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca" is a widely distributed species. In Europe and North America, it is found in both <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a> and <a href="conifer">conifer</a> forests, as well as heathland, in summer and autumn. In Mexico, it is common in coniferous forests. It fruits from the ground or from decaying wood, on burned areas in forests, and is often found near fallen trees and tree stumps. The fungus can also grow on <a href="woodchips">woodchips</a> used in gardening and landscaping, and so it also appears on roadsides and other locations where this material is used. Fruit bodies occur singly to scattered, or in clusters, and can be very abundant. Generally considered a dry weather mushroom, it can be plentiful when other mushrooms are scarce. Other locations where the false chanterelle has been recorded include Africa, Central and South America, northern Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Populations in <a href="California">California</a> represent a <a href="species%20complex">complex</a> of undescribed species that are collectively referred to as "Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca" "<a href="sensu%20lato">sensu lato</a>".

A <a href="saprophytic">saprophytic</a> fungus, "H. aurantiaca" obtains nutrients from <a href="forest%20floor">forest litter</a> and decomposing wood, causing a <a href="Wood-decay%20fungus%23Brown%20rot">brown rot</a> on the wood upon which it grows. A Finnish field study on tree stumps in a forest near Helsinki found that the species colonised them after 6–7 years.

"H. aurantiaca" secretes large amounts of <a href="oxalic%20acid">oxalic acid</a>, a <a href="reducing%20agent">reducing agent</a> and relatively <a href="strong%20acid">strong acid</a>. This stimulates <a href="weathering">weathering</a> of the <a href="humus">humus</a> layer of forest soil, and influences the solubility and turnover of nutrients (particularly <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a> and <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>), which in turn affects their availability for use by forest trees.

The false chanterelle has been described as <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> (though not tasty) by some experts, but other authors report it as potentially <a href="poisonous%20mushroom">poisonous</a>. Indeed, Fries described it as "venenatus", meaning "poisonous", in 1821. <a href="David%20Arora">David Arora</a> speculates that the confusion about edibility may be a result of misidentification with the similar-looking but definitely poisonous "<a href="Omphalotus">Omphalotus</a>" species.

U.S. Route 30 in Iowa

U.S. Highway 30 (US 30) is a major east–west <a href="U.S.%20Highway">U.S. Highway</a> which spans across the state of <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a>. It is the longest <a href="state%20highway%20%28Iowa%29">primary highway</a> in the state and is maintained by the <a href="Iowa%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Iowa Department of Transportation</a> (Iowa DOT). The route in Iowa begins at the Missouri River crossing at Blair, Nebraska, and ends at the Mississippi River crossing at Clinton. Along the way, it serves Denison and Carroll in western Iowa, <a href="Boone%2C%20Iowa">Boone</a>, Ames, and <a href="Marshalltown%2C%20Iowa">Marshalltown</a> in central Iowa, and <a href="Tama%2C%20Iowa">Tama</a>, Cedar Rapids, and <a href="DeWitt%2C%20Iowa">DeWitt</a> in eastern Iowa. Cutting across the central portion of the state, US 30 runs within close proximity of the <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railroad">Union Pacific Railroad's</a> <a href="Overland%20Route%20%28Union%20Pacific%20Railroad%29">Overland Route</a> for its entire length.

US 30 was originally conceived as a part of the <a href="Lincoln%20Highway">Lincoln Highway</a>, the first transcontinental highway in the United States. A route through Iowa was chosen because of the important link between <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, and <a href="Chicago">Chicago, Illinois</a>. As the <a href="U.S.%20Highway%20System">U.S. Highway System</a> came into being in the 1920s, and the Lincoln Highway became US 30, <a href="Federal-Aid%20Highway%20Act">federal money</a> started to pay for paving Iowa's dirt roads. By 1931, it had been paved across the entire state.

The route of the Lincoln Highway and US 30 has accommodated the changing needs of the traveling public. Early Lincoln Highway travelers were directed into many small towns as the route traveled across the state. Towards the middle of the 20th century, the route was straightened, bypassing most downtown areas and several towns altogether. More recently, long sections of US 30 have been upgraded to a four-lane expressway to meet the needs of increasing traffic. Since 2006, the highway has been designated an Iowa Heritage Byway by Iowa DOT, the first highway in the state with that distinction.

US 30 extends from west to east across the central portion of Iowa, with much of the highway traveling through rolling farmland. Small towns dot the entire route, which connects the larger cities of Denison, Ames, Cedar Rapids, and Clinton. Between Ogden and <a href="Mount%20Vernon%2C%20Iowa">Mount Vernon</a>, significant portions of the highway have been upgraded to a four-lane freeway.

US 30 enters the western end of Iowa by crossing the Missouri River on the Blair Bridge, located east of the Nebraska town of the same name. Adjacent to the highway bridge is the Union Pacific Railroad's river crossing for the Overland Route. The highway runs roughly parallel to the rail line for its entire run across Iowa. For , traffic moves through the flat Missouri River bottoms, passing <a href="DeSoto%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge</a> on the way to Missouri Valley. At Missouri Valley, it intersects <a href="Interstate%2029%20%28Iowa%29">Interstate 29</a> (I-29) at a <a href="partial%20cloverleaf%20interchange">partial cloverleaf interchange</a>. It enters the <a href="Boyer%20River">Boyer River</a> valley through the <a href="Loess%20Hills">Loess Hills</a>, a region of <a href="loess">wind-deposited silt</a> extending from north of <a href="Sioux%20City%2C%20Iowa">Sioux City</a> to extreme northwestern <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>. The rolling Loess Hills rise above the roadway while the land in the valley stays relatively flat. US 30 enters <a href="Logan%2C%20Iowa">Logan</a> and intersects the eastern end of <a href="Iowa%20Highway%20127">Iowa Highway 127</a> (Iowa 127). The highway runs parallel to the Boyer River as well as the Overland Route in a general northeast direction from Logan. east of Logan is the western end of <a href="Iowa%20Highway%2044">Iowa 44</a>, which extends east to Des Moines.

The highway enters Crawford County north of <a href="Dunlap%2C%20Iowa">Dunlap</a> in Harrison County. For , US 30 passes through farmland and the small communities of <a href="Dow%20City%2C%20Iowa">Dow City</a> and <a href="Arion%2C%20Iowa">Arion</a>. For through Denison, it overlaps <a href="U.S.%20Route%2059">US 59</a> and <a href="Iowa%20Highway%20141">Iowa 141</a>, which <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">run concurrently</a> through the town. The Iowa DOT refers to routes which overlap other routes as duplicate routes. It follows the East Boyer River through Denison as the Boyer River forks west of the northern intersection with US 59 / Iowa 141. US 30 travels north-northeasterly towards <a href="Vail%2C%20Iowa">Vail</a>. Between Vail and <a href="Westside%2C%20Iowa">Westside</a>, the highway ceases following the East Boyer River and heads due east towards <a href="Arcadia%2C%20Iowa">Arcadia</a> and Carroll in Carroll County.

At Carroll it intersects <a href="U.S.%20Route%2071%20%28Iowa%29">US 71</a> on the western side of the city. Continuing east, the highway goes through the town of <a href="Glidden%2C%20Iowa">Glidden</a> and passes to the north of <a href="Ralston%2C%20Iowa">Ralston</a>, west of the Greene County line. North of <a href="Scranton%2C%20Iowa">Scranton</a> it meets the northern end of <a href="Iowa%20Highway%2025">Iowa 25</a>. Between Scranton and <a href="Jefferson%2C%20Iowa">Jefferson</a>, US 30 crosses the <a href="Raccoon%20River">Raccoon River</a>. US 30 crosses <a href="Iowa%20Highway%204">Iowa 4</a> and <a href="Iowa%20Highway%20144">Iowa 144</a> on the northern edge of Jefferson and <a href="Grand%20Junction%2C%20Iowa">Grand Junction</a>, the latter of the cities named for its location at the junction of the historic <a href="Chicago%20%26amp%3B%20Northwestern">Chicago & Northwestern</a> and <a href="Chicago%2C%20Rock%20Island%20and%20Pacific%20Railroad">Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad</a>s, now both owned by <a href="Union%20Pacific">Union Pacific</a>, respectively. East of Grand Junction, the highway passes over the Overland Route where it stays south of the railroad until <a href="Le%20Grand%2C%20Iowa">Le Grand</a>.

 west of Ogden, US 30 is joined by <a href="U.S.%20Route%20169%20%28Iowa%29">US 169</a> from the north. The two highways run concurrently until reaching Ogden, where the road becomes a four-lane expressway. US 169 exits to the south at a partial cloverleaf interchange, while US 30 continues east through Boone County and descends into the <a href="Des%20Moines%20River">Des Moines River</a> valley. It ascends from the valley and travels another to a <a href="four-way%20stop">four-way stop</a> in Boone, which is the last stop along the route until Iowa 1 in Mt. Vernon, though this is now a roundabout. east of Boone, it meets <a href="Iowa%20Highway%2017">Iowa 17</a> at a diamond interchange. east of that interchange is a shortcut to northbound Iowa 17.

Traffic is filtered into Ames and Iowa State University (ISU) from US 30 through five interchanges. On the outskirts of Ames are the Lincoln Way interchanges, access to and from Lincoln Way is handled by two half interchanges apart. From the interchanges to the Story County line away, Lincoln Way is designated as Iowa 930, but is never signed as such. The South Dakota Avenue interchange primarily serves the southwestern part of Ames. The University Boulevard (formerly Elwood Drive) exit provides access to the Iowa State University campus and <a href="Iowa%20State%20Center">Iowa State Center</a>, ISU's cultural and athletics complex. The Duff Avenue interchange provides access to Ames's east side. <a href="U.S.%20Route%2069%20%28Iowa%29">US 69</a> and <a href="Interstate%2035%20Business%20%28Ames%2C%20Iowa%29">Interstate 35 Business Loop</a> are designated along Duff Avenue. From Duff to <a href="Interstate%2035%20%28Iowa%29">I-35</a>, US 30 is overlapped by the I-35 Business Loop. Between the Duff and Dayton Avenue interchanges, it crosses the <a href="Skunk%20River">South Skunk River</a>. The Dayton Avenue interchange serves hotels and restaurants and is a travel stop for I-35 travelers.

East of the Dayton Avenue interchange is I-35, which connects US 30 to <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis, Minnesota</a>, to the north, and <a href="Des%20Moines%2C%20Iowa">Des Moines</a> to the south. Continuing east, the expressway travels to Nevada, more to the <a href="U.S.%20Route%2065%20%28Iowa%29">US 65</a> interchange at Colo, and to where the four-lane expressway ends at <a href="State%20Center%2C%20Iowa">State Center</a>. Just before the Iowa 330 interchange later, the road becomes a four-lane expressway again. to the east are two half-interchanges with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2030%20Business%20%28Marshalltown%2C%20Iowa%29">U.S. Route 30 Business</a> (US 30 Business).

US 30 bypasses Marshalltown approximately south of its business loop. Near <a href="Marshalltown%20Community%20College">Marshalltown Community College</a>, it intersects <a href="Iowa%20Highway%2014">Iowa 14</a> at a diamond interchange. The 18th Avenue interchange on the southeastern side of Marhsalltown is the eastern end of the business loop. From Marshalltown, it travels to Le Grand, crossing over the Overland Route rail corridor on the west side. It bypasses Le Grand to the north, where it intersects the northern end of <a href="Iowa%20Highway%20146">Iowa 146</a> at a diamond interchange. Continuing east, the highway enters Tama County. It rises over a large hill north of <a href="Montour%2C%20Iowa">Montour</a> and then descends into the <a href="Iowa%20River">Iowa River</a> valley.

East of the Iowa River is the <a href="Meskwaki%20Settlement%2C%20Iowa">Meskwaki Settlement</a>, which is home to about 800 <a href="Meskwaki">Meskwaki</a> Indians and the Meskwaki Casino and Resort. As it heads into the Tama–Toledo area, the expressway bisects the two communities. Between the two cities, it meets <a href="U.S.%20Route%2063%20%28Iowa%29">US 63</a> at a partial cloverleaf interchange. From US 63 it turns to the southeast to skirt Tama's east side. It rejoins the former alignment of the highway east of Tama and heads due east, along section lines in Tama and Benton Counties, and does not enter another town for .

US 30 enters Benton County north of <a href="Belle%20Plaine%2C%20Iowa">Belle Plaine</a> at an intersection with <a href="Iowa%20Highway%2021">Iowa 21</a>. It continues east along a <a href="section%20line">section line</a>, passing the communities of <a href="Keystone%2C%20Iowa">Keystone</a>, <a href="Van%20Horne%2C%20Iowa">Van Horne</a>, and <a href="Blairstown%2C%20Iowa">Blairstown</a>. southwest of <a href="Newhall%2C%20Iowa">Newhall</a>, or southeast of Van Horne, it meets <a href="U.S.%20Route%20218">US 218</a> and becomes a four-lane road. US 30 and US 218 travel together due east towards Cedar Rapids, passing <a href="Norway%2C%20Iowa">Norway</a> and <a href="Atkins%2C%20Iowa">Atkins</a>.

On the west end of Cedar Rapids, US 30 / US 218 turn to the southeast at the 16th Avenue SW interchange. to the southeast is the <a href="Williams%20Boulevard%20%28Cedar%20Rapids%29">Williams Boulevard</a> interchange, where <a href="U.S.%20Route%20151">US 151</a> joins US 30 and US 218. For , US 30 / US 151 / US 218 is a <a href="wrong-way%20concurrency">wrong-way concurrency</a>; that is, where two or more routes heading in opposite directions share the same highway. In this instance, US 30 is the main east–west road while US 151 and US 218 are duplicate routes, nominally heading north and south, respectively. At the <a href="Interstate%20380%20%28Iowa%29">I-380</a> interchange, US 218 leaves US 30 / US 151 and joins the <a href="Avenue%20of%20the%20Saints">Avenue of the Saints</a> highway. East of I-380, US 30 / US 151 serve as a divider between the Lincolnway Village neighborhood to the south and a light industrial district to the north.

South of <a href="Bertram%2C%20Iowa">Bertram</a>, the two routes cross the <a href="Cedar%20River%20%28Iowa%20River%29">Cedar River</a> before US 151 splits away from US 30 to the north at a <a href="trumpet%20interchange">trumpet interchange</a>. This interchange is the southern end of <a href="Iowa%20Highway%2013">Iowa 13</a>. It continues east towards Mount Vernon, west of which, the four-lane highway becomes a two-lane road. In Mount Vernon, it intersects <a href="Iowa%20Highway%201">Iowa 1</a> at a roundabout. from Iowa 1, it enters <a href="Lisbon%2C%20Iowa">Lisbon</a>.

Over the next , US 30 passes through a small town every . In Cedar County it passes through <a href="Mechanicsville%2C%20Iowa">Mechanicsville</a>, <a href="Stanwood%2C%20Iowa">Stanwood</a>, <a href="Clarence%2C%20Iowa">Clarence</a> and <a href="Lowden%2C%20Iowa">Lowden</a>. In Stanwood, it is overlapped by <a href="Iowa%20Highway%2038">Iowa 38</a> for . In Clinton County, it passes through <a href="Wheatland%2C%20Iowa">Wheatland</a>, <a href="Calamus%2C%20Iowa">Calamus</a>, and <a href="Grand%20Mound%2C%20Iowa">Grand Mound</a> before reaching a full <a href="cloverleaf%20interchange">cloverleaf interchange</a> with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2061%20%28Iowa%29">US 61</a> at DeWitt. US 30 overlaps US 61 for , crossing the Union Pacific Overland Route in the process, and leaves US 61 via a trumpet interchange.

US 30 continues east as an expressway, passing DeWitt to the south. east of DeWitt, it crosses back over to the north side of the Overland Route. West of the Clinton city limits is an interchange with Clinton County Road Z36 (CR Z36), which serves <a href="Low%20Moor%2C%20Iowa">Low Moor</a> and as a shortcut to southbound <a href="U.S.%20Route%2067%20%28Iowa%29">US 67</a>. East of CR Z36, it passes the <a href="Clinton%20Municipal%20Airport%20%28Iowa%29">Clinton Municipal Airport</a> and a large chemical plant. As it approaches Mill Creek Parkway, it descends over in elevation into the flat Mississippi River valley, where it meets US 67.

US 30 / US 67 head east along Lincoln Way and ascend onto a plateau, atop which reside stores and restaurants. As they continue east, the two routes split into one-way streets, eastbound Liberty Avenue and westbound Camanche Avenue. The one-way street alignment ends at 11th Avenue South, but quickly begins again as US 30 / US 67 turn to the north onto northbound South Third Street and southbound South Fourth Street. At Eighth Avenue South, US 30 splits away from US 67 and onto the <a href="Gateway%20Bridge%20%28Clinton%29">Gateway Bridge</a> and crosses into <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>.

The path which US 30 follows has changed since it was originally planned as the Lincoln Highway in the early 1910s. The first path connected as many downtown areas as possible, in order to create awareness about the <a href="Good%20Roads%20Movement">Good Roads Movement</a> and the Lincoln Highway. As the primary highway system of Iowa matured, and the Lincoln Highway yielded to US 30, the highway was gradually straightened, leaving many towns off the route. More recently, new construction has routed traffic away from the straighter roads and onto sections of freeway and expressway.

US 30 was created with the U.S. Highway System in 1926, but the route it takes dates back to 1913, when the <a href="Lincoln%20Highway%20Association">Lincoln Highway Association</a> (LHA) designated the route across the country. The brainchild of <a href="Carl%20Fisher">Carl Fisher</a>, the Lincoln Highway was the first highway to cross the United States, connecting <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. In Iowa, it was uncertain exactly where the Lincoln Highway would run. As of August 1913, no definite route had been planned; the only certainty was the route would pass through Iowa. Iowans raised over $5 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) for the construction of the road. On September 14, 1913, the Lincoln Highway Association announced the route. It was of dirt roads, connecting Clinton, DeWitt, Cedar Rapids, Tama, Marshalltown, Ames, Jefferson, Denison, Logan, and Council Bluffs. The route was marked by a red, white, and blue tricolor emblazoned with an L. The route markers were painted upon telephone poles, bridges, and nearby buildings to show travelers the way.

While not ideal for transcontinental travel, Iowa's dirt roads were of high quality. Foreigners even compared them to the best roads in France. However, the same could not be said when they were wet. The mud was so thick and viscous it was nicknamed "<a href="%3Awikt%3Agumbo">gumbo</a>". To show travelers the obvious benefits of paved roads, the Lincoln Highway Association began the process of creating "seedling miles" of paved roads. The idea, according to <a href="Henry%20B.%20Joy">Henry B. Joy</a>, then-president of the Lincoln Highway Association, was to show travelers, for , how fast and smooth their trip could be, only to bring them back to reality at the end of the mile. Seedling miles were placed at least from the nearest town and in areas where the terrain was rough. Between August 1918 and June 1919, Iowa's first seedling mile was built in Linn County, west of Mount Vernon. The ribbon of concrete, which was wide, thick, and crowned for drainage , cost nearly $35,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars) to build.

Despite the success of the seedling miles across the country, Iowa lagged behind other states in improving its roads. Before 1924, Iowa's 99 counties, not the state highway commission, were responsible for the construction and maintenance of the state's roads. In the 1920s, road paving cost , equivalent to in dollars; a major obstacle for county boards of supervisors that wanted to pave its roads. When counties could afford to build roads, the <a href="Iowa%20State%20Highway%20Commission">Iowa State Highway Commission</a> required extensive grading to be done before paving. In 1922, only five percent of Iowa's roads, , were paved. By 1924, twenty percent of the Lincoln Highway in Iowa had been paved, and by 1931, it was paved continuously from New York City to Missouri Valley, Iowa.

When the Lincoln Highway became U.S. Highway 30 in 1926, the route was long and passed through every town along the way. Starting in the 1930s, the route's alignment began to be straightened. By the mid-1930s, it was routed west of Missouri Valley on old Iowa 130. The US 30 alignment south of Missouri Valley became U.S. Highway 30 Alternate. By 1952, it had moved south of Marshalltown and was replaced by <a href="Iowa%20Highway%20330">Iowa 330</a> and a southern jaunt through Belle Plaine had been replaced by a straight road. In 1955, a couple of routing changes occurred. In Cedar Rapids, it began its move to the south, avoiding the downtown area, and in Clinton, it was rerouted over the <a href="Gateway%20Bridge%20%28Illinois-Iowa%29">Gateway Bridge</a>, allowing <a href="Iowa%20Highway%20136">Iowa 136</a> to cross the <a href="Lyons-Fulton%20Bridge">Lyons-Fulton Bridge</a>. However, by 1957, the old alignment through Clinton and across the Lyons-Fulton Bridge was numbered U.S. Highway 30 Alternate.

In the 1960–1970s, Iowa DOT started to build freeway segments along US 30. In 1965, it was straightened and rerouted to the south of Ogden and Boone along an , four-lane stretch of road. By the end of the 1960s, both of the alternate routes had been turned over to local jurisdictions. The western route became <a href="Iowa%20Highway%20183">Iowa 183</a>, and the eastern route reverted to Iowa 136. By 1973, that new stretch of road had been extended along a four-lane bypass around Ames. The old alignment became Iowa 930. In eastern Iowa, a new, freeway connected DeWitt and Clinton by 1976. By 1985, the bypass of Cedar Rapids had been completed from 16th Avenue SW to Iowa 13 near Bertram. The bypass was extended further west in 1989. Between 1996 and 2000, an $8.2-million extension (equivalent to $ in dollars) was built to connect the bypass to the western intersection of US 218.

Since the Cedar Rapids bypass was completed in 1985, on occasion, traffic has had to be rerouted off of US 30. The bypass's proximity to the Union Pacific Railroad mainline resulted in an elevated roadway between Edgewood Road and Sixth Street SW. When strong winds come from the south, fog produced by an <a href="Archer%20Daniels%20Midland">Archer Daniels Midland</a> plant adjacent to the highway billows over the road making driving dangerous. The Iowa DOT set up an emergency detour from Edgewood Road SW north to 16th Avenue SW east to 6th Street SW back to US 30. The frequency of fog-related detours has decreased in recent years due to improved technology and the plant's expansion and relocation of cooling towers away from the highway.

The 1990s saw more construction of four-lane roads along US 30. Stretches of four-lane roads that had already been constructed were extended towards other communities. In Story County, it was widened to four lanes from the I-35 interchange to US 65 at Colo. The original 1950s-era bypass of Marshalltown was itself bypassed in 1997 by a freeway south of the original bypass. That road, Iowa Avenue in Marshalltown, was designated as <a href="U.S.%20Route%2030%20Business%20%28Marshalltown%2C%20Iowa%29">U.S. Route 30 Business</a>, the first business route along US 30 in Iowa. The four-lane stretch southeast of Cedar Rapids was extended another to a point west of Mount Vernon, costing $5.6 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) to build.

Since the beginning of the 21st century, Iowa DOT has continued to widen US 30 to four lanes. In 2004, an $18.6-million (equivalent to $ in dollars), four-lane section opened from east of Marshalltown to the Meskwaki Settlement west of Tama, bypassing Le Grand. In 2010, two sections of expressway were completed. A section from Colo to State Center opened to westbound travelers on November 29, while the eastbound lanes opened a week later. The section, which bypasses the Tama/Toledo area, opened in two segments. The first of which opened on November 1, and the second on November 25. On July 7, 2011, a section from State Center to Iowa 330 opened in Marshall County. This created a four-lane expressway from Ogden to Tama, covering .

While the Lincoln Highway has not been an official route for 93 years, it is still a source of pride in the communities and regions through which it passed. Nearly 85 percent of the original Lincoln Highway is still drivable, although much is <a href="gravel%20road">gravel</a>. Most of what is drivable is either along US 30 or within . The Lincoln Highway bridge in Tama was built in 1915. It was restored in the 1980s after local officials feared losing the then-deteriorating bridge. Preston's Service Station, a landmark of Belle Plaine, has become a Lincoln Highway museum. Monuments were built along the route to honor not only <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, but to honor Iowans who were influential for planning its route.

In 1992, the Lincoln Highway Association was reformed with a chapter in each state through which the highway passed. The new LHA is a historical preservation group that wants to preserve the remaining sections of the highway. The Iowa chapter of the LHA has, since 2008, sponsored a tour of the Lincoln Highway. To keep friendly to classic cars, the tour does not travel upon the sections of the road which are gravel. After years of lobbying by the LHA, the Iowa Department of Transportation, in 2006, designated the Lincoln Highway the first Iowa Heritage Byway. The 2010 Transportation Map of Iowa showed the path designated as the Iowa Heritage Byway for the first time.

Today, giant tortoises exist on only two remote archipelagos: the <a href="Gal%C3%A1pagos%20Islands">Galápagos Islands</a> 1000 km due west of mainland <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>; and <a href="Aldabra">Aldabra</a> in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, 700 km east of <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>.

The Galápagos tortoises are native to seven of the <a href="Gal%C3%A1pagos%20Islands">Galápagos Islands</a>, a volcanic <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a> about west of the Ecuadorian mainland. With lifespans in the wild of over 100 years, it is one of the longest-lived <a href="vertebrates">vertebrates</a>. A captive individual lived at least 170 years. Spanish explorers, who discovered the islands in the 16th century, named them after the Spanish "galápago", meaning "tortoise".

<a href="Turtle%20shell">Shell</a> size and shape vary between populations. On islands with humid highlands, the tortoises are larger, with domed shells and short necks; on islands with dry lowlands, the tortoises are smaller, with "saddleback" shells and long necks. <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin's</a> observations of these differences on the <a href="second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle">second voyage of the "Beagle"</a> in 1835, contributed to the <a href="Evolution">development of his theory of evolution</a>.

Tortoise numbers declined from over 250,000 in the 16th century to a low of around 3,000 in the 1970s. This decline was caused by <a href="overexploitation">overexploitation</a> of the species for meat and oil, <a href="Habitat%20destruction">habitat clearance</a> for agriculture, and introduction of non-native animals to the islands, such as rats, goats, and pigs. The extinction of most giant tortoise lineages is thought to have also been caused by predation by humans or human ancestors, as the tortoises themselves have no natural predators. Tortoise populations on at least three islands have become extinct in historical times due to human activities. Specimens of these extinct taxa exist in several museums and also are being subjected to DNA analysis. Ten species of the original 15 survive in the wild; an 11th species ("<a href="Chelonoidis%20abingdonii">Chelonoidis abingdonii</a>") had only a single known living individual, kept in captivity and nicknamed <a href="Lonesome%20George">Lonesome George</a> until his death in June 2012. Conservation efforts, beginning in the 20th century, have resulted in thousands of <a href="Captive%20breeding">captive-bred</a> juveniles being released onto their ancestral home islands, and the total number of the species is estimated to have exceeded 19,000 at the start of the 21st century. Despite this rebound, the species as a whole is classified as "vulnerable" by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>.

The Galápagos Islands were discovered in 1535, but first appeared on the maps, of <a href="Gerardus%20Mercator">Gerardus Mercator</a> and <a href="Abraham%20Ortelius">Abraham Ortelius</a>, around 1570. The islands were named "Insulae de los Galopegos" (Islands of the Tortoises) in reference to the giant tortoises found there.

Initially, the giant tortoises of the Indian Ocean and those from the Galápagos were considered to be the same species. Naturalists thought that sailors had transported the tortoises there. In 1676, the pre-Linnaean authority <a href="Claude%20Perrault">Claude Perrault</a> referred to both species as "Tortue des Indes". In 1783, <a href="Johann%20Gottlob%20Schneider">Johann Gottlob Schneider</a> classified all giant tortoises as "Testudo indica" ("Indian tortoise"). In 1812, <a href="August%20Friedrich%20Schweigger">August Friedrich Schweigger</a> named them "Testudo gigantea" ("gigantic tortoise"). In 1834, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Marie%20Constant%20Dum%C3%A9ril">André Marie Constant Duméril</a> and <a href="Gabriel%20Bibron">Gabriel Bibron</a> classified the Galápagos tortoises as a separate species, which they named "Testudo nigrita" ("black tortoise").

The first systematic survey of giant tortoises was by the zoologist <a href="Albert%20G%C3%BCnther">Albert Günther</a> of the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, in 1875. Günther identified at least five distinct populations from the Galápagos, and three from the Indian Ocean islands. He expanded the list in 1877 to six from the Galápagos, four from the <a href="Seychelles">Seychelles</a>, and four from the <a href="Mascarene%20Islands">Mascarenes</a>. Günther hypothesized that all the giant tortoises descended from a single ancestral population which spread by sunken <a href="land%20bridge">land bridge</a>s. This hypothesis was later disproven by the understanding that the Galápagos, Seychelles, and Mascarene islands are all of recent volcanic origin and have never been linked to a continent by land bridges. Galápagos tortoises are now thought to have descended from a South American ancestor, while the Indian Ocean tortoises derived from ancestral populations on Madagascar.

At the end of the 19th century, <a href="Georg%20Baur">Georg Baur</a> and <a href="Walter%20Rothschild%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Rothschild">Walter Rothschild</a> recognised five more populations of Galápagos tortoise. In 1905–06, an expedition by the <a href="California%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">California Academy of Sciences</a>, with <a href="Joseph%20R.%20Slevin">Joseph R. Slevin</a> in charge of reptiles, collected specimens which were studied by Academy herpetologist <a href="John%20Van%20Denburgh">John Van Denburgh</a>. He identified four additional populations, and proposed the existence of 15 species. Van Denburgh's list still guides the <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> of the Galápagos tortoise, though now 10 populations are thought to have existed.

The current specific designation of "nigra" ("black" – <a href="Jean%20Ren%C3%A9%20Constant%20Quoy">Quoy</a> & <a href="Joseph%20Paul%20Gaimard">Gaimard</a>, 1824b) was resurrected in 1984 after it was discovered to be the senior <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonym</a> (an older taxonomic synonym taking historical precedence) for the then commonly used species name of "elephantopus" ("elephant-footed" – <a href="Richard%20Harlan">Harlan</a>, 1827). Quoy and Gaimard's Latin description explains the use of "nigra: "Testudo toto corpore nigro"" means "tortoise with completely black body". Quoy and Gairmard described "nigra" from a living specimen, but no evidence indicates they knew of its accurate provenance within the Galápagos – the locality was in fact given as California. Garman proposed the linking of "nigra" with the extinct <a href="Floreana%20Island%20tortoise">Floreana</a> species. Later, Pritchard deemed it convenient to accept this designation, despite its tenuousness, for minimal disruption to the already confused nomenclature of the species. The even more senior species synonym of "californiana" ("californian" – <a href="Jean%20Ren%C3%A9%20Constant%20Quoy">Quoy</a> & <a href="Joseph%20Paul%20Gaimard">Gaimard</a>, 1824a) is considered a "<a href="nomen%20oblitum">nomen oblitum</a>" ("forgotten name").

Previously, the Galápagos tortoise was considered to belong to the genus "<a href="Geochelone">Geochelone</a>", known as 'typical tortoises' or 'terrestrial turtles'. In the 1990s, subgenus "<a href="Chelonoidis">Chelonoidis</a>" was elevated to generic status based on <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> evidence which grouped the South American members of "Geochelone" into an independent <a href="clade">clade</a> (branch of the <a href="tree%20of%20life%20%28biology%29">tree of life</a>). This nomenclature has been adopted by several authorities.

Within the archipelago, up to 15 species of Galápagos tortoises have been identified, although only 11 survive to this day. Six are found on separate islands; five of them on the volcanoes of <a href="Isabela%20Island%20%28Gal%C3%A1pagos%29">Isabela Island</a>. Several of the surviving species are seriously endangered. One of the species, "<a href="Chelonoidis%20nigra%20abingdonii">C. abingdonii</a>" from <a href="Pinta%20Island">Pinta Island</a>, is considered <a href="extinct">extinct</a>. The last known specimen, named <a href="Lonesome%20George">Lonesome George</a>, died in captivity on 24 June 2012; George had been mated with female tortoises of several other species, but none of the eggs from these pairings hatched. The species inhabiting <a href="Floreana%20Island">Floreana Island</a> ("G. nigra") is thought to have been hunted to extinction by 1850, only 15 years after <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>'s landmark visit of 1835, when he saw shells, but no live tortoises there. However, recent DNA testing shows that an intermixed, non-native population currently existing on the island of Isabela is of genetic resemblance to the species native to Floreana, suggesting that "G. nigra" has not gone entirely extinct. The existence of the "C. phantastica" species of <a href="Fernandina%20Island">Fernandina Island</a> is disputed, as it was described from a single specimen that may have been an artificial introduction to the island; however, a live female was found in 2019, likely confirming the species' validity. 

Prior to widespread knowledge of the differences between the populations (sometimes called <a href="Race%20%28biology%29">races</a>) from different islands and volcanoes, captive collections in zoos were indiscriminately mixed. Fertile offspring resulted from pairings of animals from different races. However, captive crosses between tortoises from different races have lower fertility and higher mortality than those between tortoises of the same race, and captives in mixed herds normally direct courtship only toward members of the same race.

The valid scientific names of each of the individual populations are not universally accepted, and some researchers still consider each species to be a subspecies. The taxonomic status of the various races is not fully resolved.

All <a href="species%20of%20Gal%C3%A1pagos%20tortoise">species of Galápagos tortoise</a>s evolved from common ancestors that arrived from mainland South America by overwater <a href="biological%20dispersal">dispersal</a>. Genetic studies have shown that the <a href="Chaco%20tortoise">Chaco tortoise</a> of Argentina and Paraguay is their closest living relative. The minimal founding population was a pregnant female or a breeding pair. Survival on the 1000-km oceanic journey is accounted for because the tortoises are buoyant, can breathe by extending their necks above the water, and are able to survive months without food or fresh water. As they are poor swimmers, the journey was probably a passive one facilitated by the <a href="Humboldt%20Current">Humboldt Current</a>, which diverts westwards towards the Galápagos Islands from the mainland. The ancestors of the genus "<a href="Chelonoidis">Chelonoidis</a>" are believed to have similarly dispersed from Africa to South America during the <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a>.

The closest living relative (though not a direct ancestor) of the Galápagos giant tortoise is the <a href="Chaco%20tortoise">Chaco tortoise</a> ("Chelonoidis chilensis"), a much smaller species from South America. The divergence between "C. chilensis" and "C. nigra" probably occurred 6–12 million years ago, an evolutionary event preceding the volcanic formation of the oldest modern Galápagos Islands 5 million years ago. <a href="Mitochondrial%20DNA">Mitochondrial DNA</a> analysis indicates that the oldest existing islands (Española and San Cristóbal) were colonised first, and that these populations seeded the younger islands via dispersal in a "stepping stone" fashion via local currents. Restricted <a href="gene%20flow">gene flow</a> between isolated islands then resulted in the independent evolution of the populations into the divergent forms observed in the modern species. The evolutionary relationships between the species thus echo the volcanic history of the islands.

Modern <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">DNA methods</a> have revealed new information on the relationships between the species:

The five populations living on the largest island, Isabela, are the ones that are the subject of the most debate as to whether they are true species or just distinct populations or subspecies. It is widely accepted that the population living on the northernmost volcano, Volcan Wolf, is genetically independent from the four populations to the south and is therefore a separate species. It is thought to be derived from a different colonization event than the others. A colonization from the island of Santiago apparently gave rise to the Volcan Wolf species ("C. becki") while the four southern populations are believed to be descended from a second colonization from the more southerly island of Santa Cruz. Tortoises from Santa Cruz are thought to have first colonized the Sierra Negra volcano, which was the first of the island's volcanoes to form. The tortoises then spread north to each newly created volcano, resulting in the populations living on Volcan Alcedo and then Volcan Darwin. Recent genetic evidence shows that these two populations are genetically distinct from each other and from the population living on Sierra Negra ("C. guentheri") and therefore form the species "C. vandenburghi" (Alcedo) and "C. microphyes" (Darwin). The fifth population living on the southernmost volcano ("C. vicina") is thought to have split off from the Sierra Negra population more recently and is therefore not as genetically different as the other two. Isabela is the most recently formed island tortoises inhabit, so its populations have had less time to evolve independently than populations on other islands, but according to some researchers, they are all genetically different and should each be considered as separate species.

Phylogenetic analysis may help to "resurrect" the extinct species of Floreana ("C. nigra") – a species known only from <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> remains. Some tortoises from Isabela were found to be a partial match for the genetic profile of Floreana specimens from museum collections, possibly indicating the presence of <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrids</a> from a population transported by humans from Floreana to Isabela, resulting either from individuals deliberately transported between the islands, or from individuals thrown overboard from ships to lighten the load. Nine Floreana descendants have been identified in the captive population of the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center on Santa Cruz; the genetic footprint was identified in the genomes of hybrid offspring. This allows the possibility of re-establishing a <a href="Breeding%20back">reconstructed species</a> from <a href="selective%20breeding">selective breeding</a> of the hybrid animals. Furthermore, individuals from the species possibly are still extant. Genetic analysis from a sample of tortoises from Volcan Wolf found 84 first-generation "C. nigra" hybrids, some less than 15 years old. The genetic diversity of these individuals is estimated to have required 38 "C. nigra" parents, many of which could still be alive on Isabela Island.

The Pinta Island species ("C. abingdonii", now extinct) has been found to be most closely related to the species on the islands of San Cristóbal ("C. chathamensis") and Española ("C. hoodensis") which lie over 300 km (190 mi) away, rather than that on the neighbouring island of Isabela as previously assumed. This relationship is attributable to dispersal by the strong local current from San Cristóbal towards Pinta. This discovery informed further attempts to preserve the "C. abingdonii" lineage and the search for an appropriate mate for <a href="Lonesome%20George">Lonesome George</a>, which had been penned with females from Isabela. Hope was bolstered by the discovery of a "C. abingdonii" hybrid male in the Volcán Wolf population on northern Isabela, raising the possibility that more undiscovered living Pinta descendants exist.

Mitochondrial DNA studies of tortoises on Santa Cruz show up to three genetically distinct lineages found in nonoverlapping population distributions around the regions of Cerro Montura, Cerro Fatal, and La Caseta. Although traditionally grouped into a single species ("C. porteri"), the lineages are all more closely related to tortoises on other islands than to each other: Cerro Montura tortoises are most closely related to "G. duncanensis" from Pinzón, Cerro Fatal to "G. chathamensis" from San Cristóbal, and La Caseta to the four southern races of Isabela as well as Floreana tortoises.

In 2015, the Cerro Fatal tortoises were described as a distinct taxon, "<a href="Chelonoidis%20donfaustoi">donfaustoi</a>". Prior to the identification of this species through genetic analysis, it was noted that there existed differences in shells between the Cerro Fatal tortoises and other tortoises on Santa Cruz. By classifying the Cerro Fatal tortoises into a new taxon, greater attention can be paid to protecting its habitat, according to Adalgisa Caccone, who is a member of the team making this classification.

When it was discovered that the central, small island of Pinzón had only 100–200 very old adults and no young tortoises had survived into adulthood for perhaps more than 70 years, the resident scientists initiated what would eventually become the Giant Tortoise Breeding and Rearing Program. Over the next 50 years, this program resulted in major successes in the recovery of giant tortoise populations throughout the archipelago.

In 1965, the first tortoise eggs collected from natural nests on Pinzón Island were brought to the Charles Darwin Research Station, where they would complete the period of incubation and then hatch, becoming the first young tortoises to be reared in captivity. The introduction of black rats onto Pinzón sometime in the latter half of the 19th century had resulted in the complete eradication of all young tortoises. Black rats had been eating both tortoise eggs and hatchlings, effectively destroying the future of the tortoise population. Only the longevity of giant tortoises allowed them to survive until The Galápagos National Park, <a href="Island%20Conservation">Island Conservation</a>, Charles Darwin Foundation, The Raptor Center, and Bell Laboratories removed invasive rats in 2012. In 2013, heralding an important step in Pinzón tortoise recovery, hatchlings emerged from native Pinzón tortoise nests on the island and the Galápagos National Park successfully returned 118 hatchlings to their native island home. Partners returned to Pinzón Island in late 2014 and continued to observe hatchling tortoises (now older), indicating that natural recruitment is occurring on the island unimpeded. They also discovered a snail species new to science. These exciting results highlight the conservation value of this important management action. In early 2015, after extensive monitoring, partners confirmed that Pinzón and Plaza Sur Islands are now both rodent-free.


On the southern island of Española, only 14 adult tortoises were found, two males and 12 females. The tortoises apparently were not encountering one another, so no reproduction was occurring. Between 1963 and 1974, all 14 adult tortoises discovered on the island were brought to the tortoise center on Santa Cruz and a tortoise breeding program was initiated. In 1977, a third Española male tortoise was returned to Galapagos from the San Diego Zoo and joined the breeding group. After 40 years' work reintroducing captive animals, a detailed study of the island's ecosystem has confirmed it has a stable, breeding population. Where once 15 were known, now more than 1,000 giant tortoises inhabit the island of Española. One research team has found that more than half the tortoises released since the first reintroductions are still alive, and they are breeding well enough for the population to progress onward, unaided.

Fernandina

The "C. phantastica" species from <a href="Fernandina%20Island">Fernandina</a> was originally known from a single specimen — an old male from the voyage of 1905–06. No other tortoises or remains were found on the island for a long time after its sighting, leading to suggestions that the specimen was an artificial introduction from elsewhere. Fernandina has neither human settlements nor <a href="feral">feral</a> mammals, so if this species ever did exist, its extinction would have been by natural means, such as volcanic activity. Nevertheless there have occasionally been reports from Fernandina. In 2019, an elderly female specimen was finally discovered on Fernandina and transferred to a breeding center, and trace evidence found on the expedition indicates that more individuals likely exist in the wild. It has been theorized that the rarity of the species may be due to the harsh habitat it survives in, such as the <a href="Lava">lava flows</a> that are known to frequently cover the island.


Species were described from two other islands, but their existence is based on scant evidence. The purported <a href="R%C3%A1bida%20Island">Rábida Island</a> species ("C. wallacei") was described from a single specimen collected by the <a href="California%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">California Academy of Sciences</a> in December 1905, which has since been lost. This individual was probably an artificial introduction from another island that was originally penned on Rábida next to a good anchorage, as no contemporary whaling or sealing logs mention removing tortoises from this island. The Santa Fe species has no <a href="binomial%20name">binomial name</a>, having been described from the limited evidence of bone fragments (but no shells, the most durable part) of 14 individuals, old eggs, and old dung found on the island in 1905–06. The island has never been inhabited by man nor had any introduced predators. The remains are considered artificial introductions, possibly from camping at the good anchorage on the island.

The tortoises have a large bony shell of a dull brown or gray colour. The plates of the shell are fused with the ribs in a rigid protective structure that is integral to the skeleton. <a href="Lichen">Lichen</a>s can grow on the shells of these slow-moving animals. Tortoises keep a characteristic <a href="scute">scute</a> (shell segment) pattern on their shells throughout life, though the annual growth bands are not useful for determining age because the outer layers are worn off with time. A tortoise can withdraw its head, neck, and fore limbs into its shell for protection. The legs are large and stumpy, with dry, scaly skin and hard <a href="Scale%20%28zoology%29">scales</a>. The front legs have five claws, the back legs four.

The discoverer of the Galápagos Islands, Fray Tomás de Berlanga, Bishop of Panama, wrote in 1535 of "such big tortoises that each could carry a man on top of himself." Naturalist Charles Darwin remarked after his trip three centuries later in 1835, "These animals grow to an immense size ... several so large that it required six or eight men to lift them from the ground". The largest recorded individuals have reached weights of over and lengths of . Size overlap is extensive with the <a href="Aldabra%20giant%20tortoise">Aldabra giant tortoise</a>, however taken as a species, the Galápagos tortoise seems to average slightly larger, with weights in excess of being slightly more commonplace. Weights in the larger bodied species range from in mature males and from in adult females. However, the size is variable across the islands and species; those from <a href="Pinz%C3%B3n%20Island">Pinzón Island</a> are relatively small with a maximum known weight of and carapace length of approximately compared to range in tortoises from <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20Island%20%28Gal%C3%A1pagos%29">Santa Cruz Island</a>. The tortoises' gigantism was probably a trait useful on continents that was fortuitously helpful for successful colonisation of these remote oceanic islands rather than an example of evolved <a href="Island%20gigantism">insular gigantism</a>. Large tortoises would have a greater chance of surviving the journey over water from the mainland as they can hold their heads a greater height above the water level and have a smaller <a href="Surface-area-to-volume%20ratio">surface area/volume ratio</a>, which reduces <a href="Osmosis">osmotic</a> water loss. Their significant water and fat reserves would allow the tortoises to survive long ocean crossings without food or fresh water, and to endure the drought-prone climate of the islands. A larger size allowed them to better tolerate extremes of temperature due to <a href="gigantothermy">gigantothermy</a>. Fossil giant tortoises from mainland South America have been described that support this hypothesis of gigantism that pre-existed the colonization of islands.

Galápagos tortoises possess two main shell forms that correlate with the biogeographic history of the species group. They exhibit a spectrum of carapace morphology ranging from "saddleback" (denoting upward arching of the front edge of the shell resembling a saddle) to "domed" (denoting a rounded convex surface resembling a dome). When a saddleback tortoise withdraws its head and forelimbs into its shell, a large unprotected gap remains over the neck, evidence of the lack of predation during the evolution of this structure. Larger islands with humid highlands over in elevation, such as Santa Cruz, have abundant vegetation near the ground. Tortoises native to these environments tend to have domed shells and are larger, with shorter necks and limbs. Saddleback tortoises originate from small islands less than in elevation with dry habitats (e.g. Española and Pinzón) that are more limited in food and other resources. Two lineages of Galápagos tortoises possess the Island of Santa Cruz and when observed it is concluded that despite the shared similarities of growth patterns and morphological changes observed during growth, the two lineages and two sexes can be distinguished on the basis of distinct carapace features. Lineages differ by the shape of the vertebral and pleural scutes. Females have a more elongated and wider carapace shape than males. Carapace shape changes with growth, with vertebral scutes becoming narrower and pleural scutes becoming larger during late <a href="ontogeny">ontogeny</a>.

In combination with proportionally longer necks and limbs, the unusual saddleback carapace structure is thought to be an adaptation to increase vertical reach, which enables the tortoise to browse tall vegetation such as the "<a href="Opuntia">Opuntia</a>" (prickly pear) cactus that grows in arid environments. Saddlebacks are more territorial and smaller than domed varieties, possibly adaptations to limited resources. Alternatively, larger tortoises may be better-suited to high elevations because they can resist the cooler temperatures that occur with cloud cover or fog.

A competing hypothesis is that, rather than being principally a feeding adaptation, the distinctive saddle shape and longer extremities might have been a <a href="Secondary%20sex%20characteristics">secondary sexual characteristic</a> of saddleback males. Male competition over mates is settled by <a href="dominance%20%28ethology%29">dominance</a> displays on the basis of vertical neck height rather than body size (<a href="%23Reproduction">see below</a>). This correlates with the observation that saddleback males are more aggressive than domed males. The shell distortion and elongation of the limbs and neck in saddlebacks is probably an evolutionary compromise between the need for a small body size in dry conditions and a high vertical reach for dominance displays.

The saddleback carapace probably evolved independently several times in dry habitats, since genetic similarity between populations does not correspond to carapace shape. Saddleback tortoises are, therefore, not necessarily more closely related to each other than to their domed counterparts, as shape is not determined by a similar genetic background, but by a similar ecological one.


<a href="Sexual%20dimorphism">Sexual dimorphism</a> is most pronounced in saddleback populations in which males have more angled and higher front openings, giving a more extreme saddled appearance. Males of all varieties generally have longer tails and shorter, concave <a href="Turtle%20shell%23Plastron">plastrons</a> with thickened knobs at the back edge to facilitate mating. Males are larger than females — adult males weigh around while females are .

The tortoises are <a href="ectotherm">ectotherm</a>ic (cold-blooded), so bask for 1–2 hours after dawn to absorb the sun's heat through their dark shells before actively foraging for 8–9 hours a day. They travel mostly in the early morning or late afternoon between resting and grazing areas. They have been observed to walk at a speed of .

On the larger and more humid islands, the tortoises seasonally migrate between low elevations, which become grassy plains in the wet season, and meadowed areas of higher elevation (up to ) in the dry season. The same routes have been used for many generations, creating well-defined paths through the undergrowth known as "tortoise highways". On these wetter islands, the domed tortoises are gregarious and often found in large herds, in contrast to the more solitary and territorial disposition of the saddleback tortoises.

Tortoises sometimes rest in mud wallows or rain-formed pools, which may be both a <a href="Thermoregulation">thermoregulatory</a> response during cool nights, and a protection from <a href="Parasitism">parasites</a> such as mosquitoes and ticks. Parasites are countered by taking dust baths in loose soil. Some tortoises have been noted to shelter at night under overhanging rocks.  - others have been observed sleeping in a snug depression in the earth or brush called a "pallet". Local tortoises using the same pallet sites, such as on Volcán Alcedo, results in the formation of small, sandy pits.

The tortoises are <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>s that consume a diet of cacti, grasses, leaves, lichens, berries, melons, oranges, and milkweed. They have been documented feeding on "<a href="Manchineel%20tree">Hippomane mancinella</a>" ('poison apple'), the endemic <a href="guava">guava</a> "Psidium galapageium", the <a href="Mosquito%20fern">water fern</a> "Azolla microphylla", and the <a href="Tillandsia">bromeliad</a> "Tillandsia insularis". Juvenile tortoises eat an average of 16.7% of their own body weight in dry matter per day, with a digestive efficiency roughly equal to that of hindgut-fermenting herbivorous mammals such as horses and rhinos.

Tortoises acquire most of their moisture from the dew and sap in vegetation (particularly the "<a href="Opuntia">Opuntia</a>" cactus); therefore, they can survive longer than 6 months without water. They can endure up to a year when deprived of all food and water, surviving by breaking down their body fat to produce water as a byproduct. Tortoises also have very slow metabolisms. When thirsty, they may drink large quantities of water very quickly, storing it in their bladders and the "root of the neck" (the <a href="pericardium">pericardium</a>), both of which served to make them useful water sources on ships. On arid islands, tortoises lick morning dew from boulders, and the repeated action over many generations has formed half-sphere depressions in the rock.

Regarding their senses, Charles Darwin observed, "The inhabitants believe that these animals are absolutely deaf; certainly they do not overhear a person walking near behind them. I was always amused, when overtaking one of these great monsters as it was quietly pacing along, to see how suddenly, the instant I passed, it would draw in its head and legs, and uttering a deep hiss fall to the ground with a heavy sound, as if struck dead." Although they are not deaf, tortoises depend far more on vision and smell as stimuli than hearing.

Tortoises share a <a href="Mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualistic</a> relationship with some species of <a href="Darwin%27s%20finches">Galápagos finch</a> and mockingbirds. Small groups of finches initiate the process by hopping on the ground in an exaggerated fashion facing the tortoise. The tortoise signals it is ready by rising up and extending its neck and legs, enabling the birds to reach otherwise inaccessible spots on the tortoise's body such as the neck, rear legs, <a href="cloaca">cloaca</a>l opening, and skin between plastron and carapace. The birds benefit from the food source and the tortoises get rid of irritating <a href="ectoparasite">ectoparasite</a>s.

Some tortoises have been observed to insidiously exploit this mutualistic relationship. After rising and extending its limbs, the bird may go beneath the tortoise to investigate, whereupon suddenly the tortoise withdraws its limbs to drop flat and kill the bird. It then steps back to eat the bird, presumably to supplement its diet with protein.

<a href="Mating">Mating</a> occurs at any time of the year, although it does have seasonal peaks between February and June in the humid uplands during the rainy season. When mature males meet in the mating season, they face each other in a ritualised dominance display, rise up on their legs, and stretch up their necks with their mouths gaping open. Occasionally, head-biting occurs, but usually the shorter tortoise backs off, conceding mating rights to the victor. The behaviour is most pronounced in saddleback species, which are more aggressive and have longer necks.

The prelude to mating can be very aggressive, as the male forcefully rams the female's shell with his own and nips her legs. Mounting is an awkward process and the male must stretch and tense to maintain equilibrium in a slanting position. The concave underside of the male's shell helps him to balance when straddled over the female's shell, and brings his cloacal vent (which houses the penis) closer to the female's dilated cloaca. During mating, the male vocalises with hoarse bellows and grunts, described as "rhythmic groans". This is one of the few vocalisations the tortoise makes; other noises are made during aggressive encounters, when struggling to right themselves, and hissing as they withdraw into their shells due to the forceful expulsion of air.

Females journey up to several kilometres in July to November to reach nesting areas of dry, sandy coast. Nest digging is a tiring and elaborate task which may take the female several hours a day over many days to complete. It is carried out blindly using only the hind legs to dig a -deep cylindrical hole, in which the tortoise then lays up to 16 spherical, hard-shelled eggs ranging from in mass, and the size of a billiard ball. Some observations suggest that the average <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> size for domed populations (9.6 per clutch for "C. porteri" on Santa Cruz) is larger than that of saddlebacks (4.6 per clutch for "C. duncanensis" on Pinzón). The female makes a muddy plug for the nest hole out of soil mixed with urine, seals the nest by pressing down firmly with her plastron, and leaves them to be incubated by the sun. Females may lay one to four clutches per season. <a href="Temperature-dependent%20sex%20determination">Temperature plays a role in the sex of the hatchlings</a>, with lower-temperature nests producing more males and higher-temperature nests producing more females. This is related closely to incubation time, since clutches laid early incubate during the cool season and have longer incubation periods (producing more males), while eggs laid later incubate for a shorter period in the hot season (producing more females).

Young animals emerge from the nest after four to eight months and may weigh only and measure . When the young tortoises emerge from their shells, they must dig their way to the surface, which can take several weeks, though their yolk sac can sustain them up to seven months. In particularly dry conditions, the hatchlings may die underground if they are encased by hardened soil, while flooding of the nest area can drown them. Species are initially indistinguishable as they all have domed carapaces. The young stay in warmer lowland areas for their first 10–15 years, encountering hazards such as falling into cracks, being crushed by falling rocks, or excessive heat stress. The <a href="Gal%C3%A1pagos%20hawk">Galápagos hawk</a> was formerly the sole native predator of the tortoise hatchlings; Darwin wrote: "The young tortoises, as soon as they are hatched, fall prey in great numbers to the buzzard". The hawk is now much rarer, but introduced feral pigs, dogs, cats, and black rats have become predators of eggs and young tortoises. The adult tortoises have no natural predators apart from humans; Darwin noted: "The old ones seem generally to die from accidents, as from falling down precipices. At least several of the inhabitants told me, they had never found one dead without some such apparent cause".

<a href="Sexual%20maturity">Sexual maturity</a> is reached at around 20–25 years in captivity, possibly 40 years in the wild. Life expectancy in the wild is thought to be over 100 years, making it one of the <a href="List%20of%20long-living%20organisms">longest-lived</a> species in the animal kingdom. <a href="Harriet%20%28turtle%29">Harriet</a>, a specimen kept in <a href="Australia%20Zoo">Australia Zoo</a>, was the oldest known Galápagos tortoise, having reached an estimated age of more than 170 years before her death in 2006. Chambers notes that Harriet was probably 169 years old in 2004, although media outlets claimed the greater age of 175 at death based on a less reliable timeline.

Charles Darwin visited the Galápagos for five weeks on the <a href="second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle">second voyage of HMS "Beagle"</a> in 1835 and saw Galápagos tortoises on San Cristobal (Chatham) and Santiago (James) Islands. They appeared several times in his writings and journals, and played a role in the development of the theory of evolution.

Darwin wrote in his account of the voyage:
"I have not as yet noticed by far the most remarkable feature in the natural history of this archipelago; it is, that the different islands to a considerable extent are inhabited by a different set of beings. My attention was first called to this fact by the Vice-Governor, <a href="Nicholas%20Lawson">Mr. Lawson</a>, declaring that the tortoises differed from the different islands, and that he could with certainty tell from which island any one was brought ... The inhabitants, as I have said, state that they can distinguish the tortoises from the different islands; and that they differ not only in size, but in other characters. Captain Porter has described* those from Charles and from the nearest island to it, namely, Hood Island, as having their shells in front thick and turned up like a Spanish saddle, while the tortoises from James Island are rounder, blacker, and have a better taste when cooked." 

The significance of the differences in tortoises between islands did not strike him as important until it was too late, as he continued,
"I did not for some time pay sufficient attention to this statement, and I had already partially mingled together the collections from two of the islands. I never dreamed that islands, about fifty or sixty miles apart, and most of them in sight of each other, formed of precisely the same rocks, placed under a quite similar climate, rising to a nearly equal height, would have been differently tenanted".

Though the "Beagle" departed from the Galápagos with over 30 adult tortoises on deck, these were not for scientific study, but a source of fresh meat for the Pacific crossing. Their shells and bones were thrown overboard, leaving no remains with which to test any hypotheses. It has been suggested that this oversight was made because Darwin only reported seeing tortoises on San Cristóbal ("C. chathamensis") and Santiago ("C. darwini"), both of which have an intermediate type of shell shape and are not particularly morphologically distinct from each other. Though he did visit Floreana, the "C. nigra" species found there was already nearly extinct and he was unlikely to have seen any mature animals.
However, Darwin did have four live juvenile specimens to compare from different islands. These were pet tortoises taken by himself (from San Salvador), his captain <a href="Robert%20FitzRoy">FitzRoy</a> (two from Española) and his servant <a href="Syms%20Covington">Syms Covington</a> (from Floreana). Unfortunately, they could not help to determine whether each island had its own variety because the specimens were not mature enough to exhibit morphological differences. Although the British Museum had a few specimens, their provenance within the Galápagos was unknown. However, conversations with the naturalist <a href="Gabriel%20Bibron">Gabriel Bibron</a>, who had seen the mature tortoises of the Paris Natural History Museum confirmed to Darwin that distinct varieties occurred.

Darwin later compared the different tortoise forms with those of <a href="mockingbird">mockingbird</a>s, in the first tentative statement linking his observations from the Galapagos with the possibility of species transmuting:
"When I recollect the fact that [from] the form of the body, shape of scales and general size, the Spaniards can at once pronounce from which island any tortoise may have been brought; when I see these islands in sight of each other and possessed of but a scanty stock of animals, tenanted by these birds, but slightly differing in structure and filling the same place in nature; I must suspect they are only varieties ... If there is the slightest foundation for these remarks, the zoology of archipelagos will be well worth examining; for such facts would undermine the stability of species."

His views on the mutability of species were restated in his notebooks: "animals on separate islands ought to become different if kept long enough apart with slightly differing circumstances. – Now Galapagos Tortoises, Mocking birds, Falkland Fox, Chiloe fox, – Inglish and Irish Hare." These observations served as counterexamples to the prevailing contemporary view that species were individually created.

Darwin also found these "antediluvian animals" to be a source of diversion: "I frequently got on their backs, and then giving a few raps on the hinder part of their shells, they would rise up and walk away;—but I found it very difficult to keep my balance".

Several waves of human exploitation of the tortoises as a food source caused a decline in the total wild population from around 250,000 when first discovered in the 16th century to a low of 3,060 individuals in a 1974 census. Modern conservation efforts have subsequently brought tortoise numbers up to 19,317 (estimate for 1995–2009).

The species "C. nigra" became extinct by human exploitation in the 19th century. Another species, "C. abingdonii", became extinct on 24 June 2012 with the death in captivity of the last remaining specimen, a male named Lonesome George, the world's "rarest living creature". All the other surviving species are listed by the IUCN as at least "Vulnerable" in conservation status, if not worse.

An estimated 200,000 animals were taken before the 20th century. The relatively immobile and defenceless tortoises were collected and stored live on board ships, where they could survive for at least a year without food or water (some anecdotal reports suggest individuals surviving two years), providing valuable fresh meat, while their diluted urine and the water stored in their neck bags could be used as drinking water. The 17th-century British pirate, explorer, and naturalist <a href="William%20Dampier">William Dampier</a> wrote, "They are so extraordinarily large and fat, and so sweet, that no pullet eats more pleasantly," while Captain <a href="James%20Colnett">James Colnett</a> of the British Navy wrote of "the land tortoise which in whatever way it was dressed, was considered by all of us as the most delicious food we had ever tasted." US Navy captain <a href="David%20Porter%20%28naval%20officer%29">David Porter</a> declared, "after once tasting the Galapagos tortoises, every other animal food fell off greatly in our estimation ... The meat of this animal is the easiest of digestion, and a quantity of it, exceeding that of any other food, can be eaten without experiencing the slightest of inconvenience." Darwin was less enthusiastic about the meat, writing "the breast-plate roasted (as the Gauchos do "carne con cuero"), with the flesh on it, is very good; and the young tortoises make excellent soup; but otherwise the meat to my taste is indifferent."

In the 17th century, <a href="pirate">pirate</a>s started to use the Galápagos Islands as a base for resupply, restocking on food and water, and repairing vessels before attacking <a href="Spanish%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">Spanish colonies</a> on the South American mainland. However, the Galápagos tortoises did not struggle for survival at this point because the islands were distant from busy shipping routes and harboured few valuable natural resources. As such, they remained unclaimed by any nation, uninhabited and uncharted. In comparison, the tortoises of the islands in the Indian Ocean were already facing extinction by the late 17th century. Between the 1790s and the 1860s, <a href="whaling">whaling</a> ships and <a href="Fur%20seal%23Exploitation">fur sealers</a> systematically collected tortoises in far greater numbers than the buccaneers preceding them. Some were used for food and many more were killed for high-grade "turtle oil" from the late 19th century onward for lucrative sale to continental Ecuador. A total of over 13,000 tortoises is recorded in the logs of whaling ships between 1831 and 1868, and an estimated 100,000 were taken before 1830. Since it was easiest to collect tortoises around coastal zones, females were most vulnerable to depletion during the nesting season. The collection by whalers came to a halt eventually through a combination of the scarcity of tortoises that they had created and the competition from crude oil as a cheaper energy source.

Galápagos tortoise exploitation dramatically increased with the onset of the California Gold Rush in 1849. Tortoises and sea turtles were imported into San Francisco, Sacramento and various other Gold Rush towns throughout Alta California to feed the gold mining population. Galápagos tortoise and sea turtle bones were also recovered from the Gold Rush-era archaeological site, Thompson's Cove (CA-SFR-186H), in San Francisco, California.

Population decline accelerated with the early settlement of the islands in the early 19th century, leading to unregulated hunting for meat, habitat clearance for agriculture, and the introduction of alien mammal species. Feral pigs, dogs, cats, and black rats have become predators of eggs and young tortoises, whilst goats, donkeys, and cattle compete for grazing and trample nest sites. The extinction of the Floreana species in the mid-19th century has been attributed to the combined pressures of hunting for the penal colony on the relatively small island, the conversion of the grazing highlands into land for farming and fruit plantations, and the introduction of feral mammals.

Scientific collection expeditions took 661 tortoises between 1888 and 1930, and more than 120 tortoises have been taken by poachers since 1990. Threats continue today with the rapid expansion of the tourist industry and increasing size of human settlements on the islands. The tortoises are down from 15 different types of species when Darwin first arrived down to 11.

Threats
Collection

The tortoises of the Galápagos’ island were not only hunted for the oil that they held for fuel but also once they were becoming more and more extinct people began to pay to have them in their collections, as well as being put into museums.

The remaining species of tortoise range in IUCN classification from <a href="extinct%20in%20the%20wild">extinct in the wild</a> to <a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a>. Slow growth rate, late sexual maturity, and island endemism make the tortoises particularly prone to extinction without help from conservationists. The Galápagos giant tortoise has become a <a href="flagship%20species">flagship species</a> for conservation efforts throughout the Galápagos.
The Galápagos giant tortoise is now strictly protected and is listed on Appendix I of the <a href="CITES">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a>. The listing requires that trade in the <a href="taxon">taxon</a> and its products is subject to strict regulation by ratifying states, and international trade for primarily commercial purposes is prohibited. In 1936, the Ecuadorian government listed the giant tortoise as a protected species. In 1959, it declared all uninhabited areas in the Galápagos to be a <a href="national%20park">national park</a> and established the <a href="Charles%20Darwin%20Foundation">Charles Darwin Foundation</a>. In 1970, capturing or removing many species from the islands (including tortoises and their eggs) was banned. To halt trade in the tortoises altogether, it became illegal to export the tortoises from Ecuador, captive or wild, continental, or insular in provenance. The banning of their exportation resulted in automatic prohibition of importation to the United States under Public Law 91-135 (1969). A 1971 Ecuadorian decree made it illegal to damage, remove, alter, or disturb any organism, rock, or other natural object in the National Park.


With the establishment of the Galapagos National Park and the CDF in 1959, a review of the status of the tortoise populations began. Only 11 of the 14 original populations remained and most of these were endangered if not already on the brink of extinction. The breeding and rearing program for giant tortoises began in response to the condition of the population on Pinzón, where fewer than 200 old adults were found. All of the hatchlings had been killed by introduced black rats, for perhaps more than a century. Without help, this population would eventually disappear. The only thing preserving it was the longevity of the tortoise. Its genetic resistance to the negative effects of <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a> would be another.

Breeding and release programs began in 1965 and have successfully brought seven of the eight endangered species up to less perilous population levels. Young tortoises are raised at several breeding centres across the islands to improve their survival during their vulnerable early development. Eggs are collected from threatened nesting sites, and the hatched young are given a head start by being kept in captivity for four to five years to reach a size with a much better chance of survival to adulthood, before release onto their native ranges.

The most significant population recovery was that of the Española tortoise ("C. hoodensis"), which was saved from near-certain extinction. The population had been depleted to three males and 12 females that had been so widely dispersed that no <a href="mating%20in%20the%20wild">mating in the wild</a> had occurred. Fruitless attempts to breed one of the tortoises, Lonesome George for example, is speculated to be attributed to a lack of postnatal cues, and confusion over which would be the most appropriate genetic species would be the most appropriate to mate him with on the islands. The 15 remaining tortoises were brought to the <a href="Charles%20Darwin%20Research%20Station">Charles Darwin Research Station</a> in 1971 for a captive breeding program and, in the following 33 years, they gave rise to over 1,200 progeny which were released onto their home island and have since begun to reproduce naturally. One of the tortoises, Diego, is one of the main drivers of a remarkable recovery of the "hoodensis" species having fathered between 350 and 800 progeny.

The Galápagos National Park Service systematically <a href="culling">culls</a> feral predators and competitors. Goat eradication on islands, including Pinta, was achieved by the technique of using "Judas" goats with radio location collars to find the herds. Marksmen then shot all the goats except the Judas, and then returned weeks later to find the "Judas" and shoot the herd to which it had relocated. Goats were removed from Pinta Island after a 30-year eradication campaign, the largest removal of an insular goat population using ground-based methods. Over 41,000 goats were removed during the initial hunting effort (1971–82). This process was repeated until only the "Judas" goat remained, which was then killed. Other measures have included dog eradication from San Cristóbal, and fencing off nests to protect them from feral pigs.

Efforts are now underway to repopulate islands formerly inhabited by tortoises to restore their ecosystems (<a href="island%20restoration">island restoration</a>) to their condition before humans arrived. The tortoises are a <a href="keystone%20species">keystone species</a>, acting as <a href="ecosystem%20engineer">ecosystem engineer</a>s which help in plant <a href="seed%20dispersal">seed dispersal</a> and trampling down brush and thinning the understory of vegetation (allowing light to penetrate and germination to occur). Birds such as <a href="Galapagos%20flycatcher">flycatcher</a>s perch on and fly around tortoises to hunt the insects they displace from the brush. In May 2010, 39 sterilised tortoises of hybrid origin were introduced to Pinta Island, the first tortoises there since the evacuation of Lonesome George 38 years before. Sterile tortoises were released so the problem of interbreeding between species would be avoided if any fertile tortoises were to be released in the future. It is hoped that with the recent identification of a hybrid "C. abingdonii" tortoise, the approximate genetic constitution of the original inhabitants of Pinta may eventually be restored with the identification and relocation of appropriate specimens to this island. This approach may be used to "retortoise" Floreana in the future, since captive individuals have been found to be descended from the extinct original stock.


The Galapagos Tortoise Movement Ecology Programme is a collaborative project coordinated by Dr Stephen Blake of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology. Its goal is to assist the Galapagos National Park to effectively conserve giant tortoises by conducting cutting-edge applied science, and developing an inspirational tortoise-based outreach and education programme. Since 2009, the project team have been analysing the movements of giant tortoises by tracking them via satellite tags. As of November 2014, the team have tagged 83 tortoises from four species on three islands. They have established that giant tortoises conduct migrations up and down volcanoes, primarily in response to seasonal changes in the availability and quality of vegetation. In 2015 they will start to track the movements of hatchling and juvenile tortoises, supported by the UK's <a href="Galapagos%20Conservation%20Trust">Galapagos Conservation Trust</a>.

Structural history of the Roman military

The structural history of the Roman military concerns the major transformations in the organization and constitution of <a href="Ancient%20Rome">ancient Rome's</a> <a href="Military%20of%20ancient%20Rome">armed forces</a>, "the most effective and long-lived military institution known to history." From its origins around 800 BC to its final dissolution in AD 476 with the demise of the <a href="Western%20Roman%20Empire">Western Roman Empire</a>, Rome's military organization underwent substantial structural change. At the highest level of structure, the forces were split into the <a href="Roman%20army">Roman army</a> and the <a href="Roman%20navy">Roman navy</a>, although these two branches were less distinct than in many modern national defense forces. Within the top levels of both army and navy, structural changes occurred as a result of both positive military reform and organic structural evolution. These changes can be divided into four distinct phases.





According to the historians <a href="Livy">Livy</a> and <a href="Dionysius%20of%20Halicarnassus">Dionysius of Halicarnassus</a>, writing at a far later date, the earliest Roman army existed in the 8th century BC. During this period Rome itself was probably little more than a fortified hilltop settlement and its army a relatively small force, whose activities were limited "mainly [to] raiding and cattle rustling with the occasional skirmish-like battle". Historian <a href="Theodor%20Mommsen">Theodor Mommsen</a> referred to it as Rome's "curiate" army, named for its presumed subdivision along the boundaries of Rome's three founding tribes (Latin: "<a href="curia">curia</a>e"), the <a href="Ramnians">Ramnians</a>, <a href="Tities%20%28roman%20tribe%29">Tities</a> and <a href="Luceres">Luceres</a>. This army's exact structure is not known, but it is probable that it loosely resembled a warrior band or group of bodyguards led by a chieftain or king. Mommsen believes that Roman military organization of this period was regimented by the "Laws of [the apocryphal] King [V]Italus" but these laws, though referred to by <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, have been lost.

The army (Latin: "legio") consisted, according to Livy, of exactly 3,000 infantry and 300 horsemen, one third from each of Rome's three founding tribes. Warriors served under six "leaders of division" (Latin: "tribuni") who in turn served under a general, usually in the person of the reigning King. Mommsen uses <a href="philological">philological</a> arguments and references from Livy and others to suggest that the greater mass of foot-soldiers probably consisted of "<a href="pilumni">pilumni</a>" (javelin-throwers), with a smaller number possibly serving as "<a href="arquites">arquites</a>" (archers). The cavalry was far smaller in number and probably consisted solely of the town's richest citizens. The army may also have contained the earliest form of chariots, hinted at by references to the "flexuntes" ("the wheelers").

By the beginning of the 7th century BC, the <a href="Iron-Age">Iron-Age</a> <a href="Etruscans">Etruscan civilization</a> (Latin: "Etrusci") was dominant in the region. Like most of the other peoples in the region, the Romans warred against the Etruscans. By the close of the century, the Romans had lost their struggle for independence, and the Etruscans had conquered Rome, establishing a military dictatorship, or kingdom, in the city.

Although several Roman sources including <a href="Livy">Livy</a> and <a href="Polybius">Polybius</a> talk extensively about the Roman army of the <a href="Roman%20Kingdom">Roman Kingdom</a> period that followed the Etruscan capture of the city, no contemporary accounts survive. Polybius, for example, was writing some 300 years after the events in question, and Livy some 500 years later. Additionally, what records were kept by the Romans at this time were later destroyed when the city was sacked. The sources for this period cannot therefore be seen as reliable, as they can be for later military history, e.g. from the <a href="First%20Punic%20War">First Punic War</a> onwards.

According to our surviving narratives, the three kings of Rome during the Etruscan occupation were <a href="Tarquinius%20Priscus">Tarquinius Priscus</a>, <a href="Servius%20Tullius">Servius Tullius</a>, and <a href="Tarquinius%20Superbus">Tarquinius Superbus</a>. During this period the army underwent a reformation into a "centurial" army based on socio-economic class. <a href="Servian%20constitution">This reformation</a> is traditionally attributed to Servius Tullius, the second of the <a href="Roman%20Kingdom">Etruscan kings</a>. Tullius had earlier carried out the first Roman census of all citizens. Livy tells us that Tullius reformed the army by transplanting onto it the structure derived originally for civil life as a result of this census. At all levels, military service was, at this time, considered to be a civic responsibility and a way of advancing one's status within society.

However, Rome's social classes were qualified rather than created by the census. It is perhaps more accurate to say therefore that the army's structure was slightly refined during this period rather than radically reformed. Prior to these reforms, the infantry was divided into the "classis" of rich citizens and the "infra classem" of poorer citizens. The latter were excluded from the regular line of battle on the basis that their equipment was of poor quality. During the reforms, this crude division of poorer and richer citizens was further stratified. The army thereafter consisted of a number of troop types based upon the social class of propertied citizens, collectively known as "<a href="adsidui">adsidui</a>". From the poorest in the "fifth class" to the richest in the "first class" and the <a href="Roman%20equestrian%20order">equestrians</a> above them, military service was compulsory for all. However, Roman citizens at this time generally viewed military service as a proper undertaking of duty to the state, in contrast to later views of military service as an unwelcome and unpleasant burden. Whereas there are accounts of Romans in the late empire mutilating their own bodies in order to exempt themselves from military service, there seems to have been no such reluctance to serve in the military of early Rome. This may in part be due to the generally lower intensity of conflict in this era; to the fact that men were fighting close to and often in protection of their own homes, or due to—as posited by later Roman writers—a greater martial spirit in antiquity.

The equestrians, the highest social class of all, served in mounted units known as "<a href="equites">equites</a>". The <a href="Servius%20Tullius%23Classes">first class</a> of the richest citizens served as heavy infantry with swords and long spears (resembling <a href="hoplite">hoplite</a>s), and provided the first line of the battle formation. The <a href="Servius%20Tullius%23Classes">second class</a> were armed similarly to the first class, but without a <a href="breastplate">breastplate</a> for protection, and with an oblong rather than a round shield. The second class stood immediately behind the first class when the army was drawn up in battle formation. The <a href="Servius%20Tullius%23Classes">third and fourth classes</a> were more lightly armed and carried a thrusting-spear and javelins. The third class stood behind the second class in battle formation, normally providing javelin support. The poorest of the propertied men of the city comprised the <a href="Servius%20Tullius%23Classes">fifth class</a>. They were generally too poor to afford much equipment at all and were armed as skirmishers with <a href="Sling%20%28weapon%29">slings</a> and stones. They were deployed in a screen in front of the main army, covering its approach and masking its manoeuvres.

Men without property, who were thereby excluded from the qualifying social classes of the "<a href="adsidui">adsidui</a>", were exempted from military service on the grounds that they were too poor to provide themselves with any arms whatsoever. However, in the most pressing circumstances, even these "<a href="proletarii">proletarii</a>" were pressed into service, though their military worth was probably questionable. Troops in all of these classes would fight together on the battlefield, with the exception of the most senior troops, who were expected to guard the city.

The army is said to have increased from 3,000 to 4,000 men in the 5th century BC, and then again from 4,000 to 6,000 men sometime before 400 BC. This later army of 6,000 men were then divided into 60 "centuries" of 100 men each.

The army of the early Republic continued to evolve, and although there was a tendency among Romans to attribute such changes to great reformers, it is more likely that changes were the product of slow evolution rather than singular and deliberate policy of reform. The manipular formation was probably copied from Rome's <a href="Samnium">Samnite</a> enemies to the south, perhaps as a result of Roman defeats in the <a href="Second%20Samnite%20War">Second Samnite War</a>.

During this period, a military formation of around 5,000 men was known as a legion (Latin: "legio"). However, in contrast to later legionary formations of exclusively heavy infantry, the legions of the early and middle Republic consisted of both light and heavy infantry. The term "manipular legion", a legion based on units called <a href="Maniple%20%28military%20unit%29">maniples</a>, is therefore used to contrast the later "cohortal" legion of the Empire that was based around a system of "cohort" units. The manipular legion was based partially upon social class and partially upon age and military experience. It therefore represents a theoretical compromise between the earlier class-based army and the class-free armies of later years. In practice, even slaves were at one time pressed into the army of the Republic out of necessity. Normally a single legion was raised each year, but in 366 BC two legions were raised in a single year for the first time.

"Maniples" were units of 120 men each drawn from a single infantry class. The maniples were small enough to permit tactical movement of individual infantry units on the battlefield within the framework of the greater army. The maniples were typically deployed into three discrete lines (Latin: "triplex acies") based on the three heavy infantry types of "<a href="hastati">hastati</a>", "<a href="principes">principes</a>" and "<a href="triarii">triarii</a>". The first type, the "hastati", typically formed the first rank in battle formation. They typically wore a brass chest plate (though some could afford mail), a helmet called a galea, and occasionally, greaves (shin guards). They carried an iron bossed wooden shield, 120 cm (4 ft) tall and rectangular in shape with a curved front to partially protect the sides. Traditionally they were armed with a sword known as a "<a href="gladius">gladius</a>" and two <a href="throwing%20spear">throwing spear</a>s known as "<a href="pilum">pila</a>": one the heavy "pilum" of popular imagination and one a slender javelin. However the exact introduction of the Gladius and the replacement of the spear with the sword as the primary weapon of the Roman Legions is uncertain, and it's possible that the early manipular legions still fought with the Hastati and Principes wielding the Hasta or Spear.
The second type, the "principes", typically formed the second rank of soldiers back from the front of a battle line. They were heavy infantry soldiers armed and armoured as per the hastati. The "triarii", who typically formed the third rank when the army was arrayed for battle, were the last remnant of hoplite-style troops in the Roman army. They were armed and armoured as per the "principes", with the exception that they carried a <a href="pike%20%28weapon%29">pike</a> rather than two "pila". A 600-man triarii maniple was divided into two formations each six men across by 10 men deep. A manipular legion typically contained between 1,200-2400 "hastati", 1,200-2400 "principes" and 600-1200 "triarii". The three classes of unit may have retained some slight parallel to social divisions within Roman society, but at least officially the three lines were based upon age and experience rather than social class. Young, unproven men would serve as "hastati", older men with some military experience as "principes", and veteran troops of advanced age and experience as "triarii".

The heavy infantry of the maniples were supported by a number of light infantry (Latin: "<a href="velites">velites</a>") and cavalry (Latin: "<a href="equites">equites</a>") troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion. The cavalry was drawn primarily from the richest class of equestrians, but additional cavalry and light infantry were drawn at times from the <a href="socii">socii</a> and <a href="Latins%20%28Italic%20tribe%29">Latini</a> of the Italian mainland. The "equites" were still drawn from the <a href="Equestrian%20%28Roman%29">wealthier</a> classes in Roman society. There was an additional class of troops (Latin: "<a href="accensi">accensi</a>", also "adscripticii" and later "supernumerarii") who followed the army without specific martial roles and were deployed to the rear of the "triarii". Their role in accompanying the army was primarily to supply any vacancies that might occur in the maniples, but they also seem to have acted occasionally as orderlies to the officers.

The light infantry of 1,200 "velites" consisted of unarmoured skirmishing troops drawn from the youngest and lower social classes. They were armed with a sword and <a href="shield">shield</a> (90 cm (3 ft) diameter), as well as several light javelins, each with a 90 cm (3 ft) wooden shaft the diameter of a finger, with a c. 25 cm (10 in) narrow metal point. Their numbers were swollen by the addition of allied light infantry and irregular "<a href="rorarii">rorarii</a>".

The Roman levy of 403 BC was the first to be requested to campaign for longer than a single season, and from this point on such a practice became gradually more common, if still not typical.

A small navy had operated at a fairly low level after the <a href="Second%20Samnite%20War">Second Samnite War</a>, but it was massively upgraded during this period, expanding from a few primarily river- and coastal-based patrol craft to a full maritime unit. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the <a href="Carthage">Carthaginian</a> pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size. This was partially because a pacified Roman Mediterranean called for little naval policing, and partially because the Romans chose to rely during this period on ships provided by Greek cities, whose peoples had greater maritime experience.

The extraordinary demands of the <a href="Punic%20Wars">Punic Wars</a>, in addition to a shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, at least in the short term. In 217 BC, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners when slaves were pressed into naval service; around 213 BC, the property requirement was reduced from 11,000 to 4,000 <a href="As%20%28coin%29">asses</a>. Since the Romans are unlikely to have preferred to employ slaves over poor citizens in their armies, it must be assumed that, at this point, the "proletarii" of the poorest citizens must also have been pressed into service despite their lack of legal qualification. By 123 BC, the financial requirement for military service was slashed again from 4,000 asses to just 1,500 asses. By this time, therefore, it is clear that many of the property-less former "proletarii" had been nominally admitted into the "<a href="adsidui">adsidui</a>".

During the 2nd century BC, Roman territory saw an overall decline in population, partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes into lower classes of the census and the "proletarii". As a result, both the Roman society and its military became increasingly proletarianised. The Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers at the expense of the state, since many of the soldiers who made up its lower classes were now impoverished "proletarii" in all but name, and were too poor to afford their own equipment.

The distinction between the heavy infantry types of "hastati", "principes" and "triarii" began to blur, perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment to all but the first class of troops, who alone were able to afford their own equipment. By the time of Polybius, the "triarii" or their successors still represented a distinct heavy infantry type armed with a unique style of cuirass, but the "hastati" and "principes" had become indistinguishable.

In addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon its allies ("socii") for the provision of allied troops. Where accepted allies could not provide the required force types, the Romans were not averse during this period to hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.

In a process known as the <a href="Marian%20reforms">Marian reforms</a>, <a href="Roman%20consul">Roman consul</a> <a href="Gaius%20Marius">Gaius Marius</a> carried out a programme of reform of the Roman military. In 107 BC, all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for entry into the Roman army. This move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries, of removing property requirements for military service. The distinction between "hastati", "principes" and "triarii", which had already become blurred, was officially removed, and the <a href="Roman%20legion">legionary infantry</a> of popular imagination was created. Legionary infantry formed a homogeneous force of <a href="heavy%20infantry">heavy infantry</a>. These legionaries were drawn from citizen stock; by this time, Roman or Latin citizenship had been regionally expanded over much of ancient Italy and <a href="Cisalpine%20Gaul">Cisalpine Gaul</a>. Lighter citizen infantry, such as the "velites" and "equites", were replaced by non-citizen "<a href="Auxiliaries%20%28Roman%20military%29">auxilia</a>" that could consist of foreign <a href="mercenaries">mercenaries</a>. Due to the concentration of the citizen legions into a force of heavy infantry Rome's armies depended on auxiliary cavalry attachments for support. As a tactical necessity, legions were almost always accompanied by an equal or greater number of lighter auxiliary troops, which were drawn from the non-citizens of the Empire's territories. One known exception of legions being formed from non-citizen provinces during this period was the legion that was raised in the province of <a href="Galatia">Galatia</a>.

After Marius, the legions were drawn largely from volunteer citizens rather than citizens conscripted for duty. Volunteers came forward and were accepted not from citizens of the city of Rome itself but from the surrounding countryside and smaller towns falling under Roman control. Whereas some long-term military professionals were classed as <a href="veteran">veteran</a>s, they were outnumbered by civilians with limited military experience who were in active service perhaps only for a few campaigns. The legions of the late Republic remained, unlike the legions of the later Empire, predominantly Roman in origin, although some small number of ex-auxiliary troops were probably incorporated. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy.

Unlike earlier in the Republic, legionaries were no longer fighting on a seasonal basis to protect their land. Instead, they received standard pay, and were employed by the state on a fixed-term basis. As a consequence, military duty began to appeal most to the poorest sections of society, to whom a guaranteed salary was attractive. The army therefore consisted of a far higher proportion of the poor—particularly the rural poor—than it had previously. A destabilising consequence of this development was that the proletariat "acquired a stronger and more elevated position" within the state. This professionalisation of the military was necessary to provide permanent garrisons for newly acquired and distant territories such as <a href="Hispania">Hispania</a>, something not possible under an army of seasonal citizen militia.

Historian R. E. Smith notes that there was a need to raise additional legions in an emergency to repel specific strategic threats. He argues that this may have resulted in two types of legion. Long-standing legions deployed overseas were probably professional troops forming a standing army. Quickly-formed new legions, in contrast, consisted of younger men, perhaps with little or no military experience, who hoped for adventure and plunder. However, no distinction in basic pay, discipline or armour is known of between the two types of legion. The practice of veteran troops signing up again voluntarily into newly raised legions must have meant that no one army conformed exactly to one or other of these theoretical archetypes.

The legions of the late Republic were, structurally, almost entirely heavy infantry. The legion's main sub-unit was called a "<a href="Cohort%20%28military%20unit%29">cohort</a>" and consisted of approximately 480 infantrymen. The cohort was therefore a much larger unit than the earlier "maniple" sub-unit, and was divided into six <a href="Centuria%23Military">centuriae</a> of 80 men each. Each centuria was separated further into 10 "tent groups" (Latin: "<a href="contubernia">contubernia</a>") of 8 men each. Legions additionally consisted of a small body, typically 120 men, of Roman legionary cavalry (Latin: "<a href="equites%20legionis">equites legionis</a>"). The "equites" were used as scouts and dispatch riders rather than battlefield cavalry. Legions also contained a dedicated artillery crew of perhaps 60 men, who would operate devices such as "<a href="ballistae">ballistae</a>".

Each legion was normally partnered with an approximately equal number of allied (non-Roman) "auxiliae" troops. The addition of allied troops to the Roman army was a formalisation of the earlier arrangement of using light troops from the <a href="Socii">Socii</a> and <a href="Latins%20%28Italic%20tribe%29">Latini</a>, who had received Roman citizenship after the <a href="Social%20War%20%2891%E2%80%9388%20BC%29">Social War</a>. Auxiliary troops could be formed from either auxiliary light cavalry known as "<a href="Ala%20%28Roman%20military%29">alae</a>", auxiliary light infantry known as "cohors auxiliae", or a flexible mixture of the two known as "cohors equitata". Cavalry types included mounted archers (Latin: "<a href="Horse%20archer">sagittarii</a>") and heavy shock cavalry (Latin: "<a href="cataphracti">cataphracti</a>" or "<a href="clibanarii">clibanarii</a>"). Infantry could be armed with bows, slings, throwing spears, long swords, or thrusting spears. Auxiliary units were originally led by their own chiefs, and, in this period, their internal organisation was left to their commanders.

However, "the most obvious deficiency" of the Roman army remained its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry; even auxiliary troops were predominantly infantry. Luttwak argues that auxiliary forces largely consisted of <a href="Crete">Cretan</a> archers, <a href="Balearics">Balearic</a> slingers and <a href="Numidia">Numidia</a>n infantry, all of whom fought on foot. As Rome's borders expanded and its adversaries changed from largely infantry-based to largely cavalry-based troops, the infantry-based Roman army began to find itself at a tactical disadvantage, particularly in the East.

After having declined in size following the subjugation of the Mediterranean, the Roman navy underwent short-term upgrading and revitalisation in the late Republic to meet several new demands. Under <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Caesar</a>, an invasion fleet was assembled in the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> to allow the invasion of <a href="Roman%20Britain">Britain</a>; under <a href="Pompey">Pompey</a>, a large fleet was raised in the Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea of <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>n pirates. During the civil war that followed, as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or pressed into service from Greek cities.

By the time of <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> in 54 BC, regular legionary units were supplemented by "<a href="exploratores">exploratores</a>", a body of scouts, and "<a href="speculatores">speculatores</a>", spies who infiltrated enemy camps. Due to the demands of the civil war, the extraordinary measure of recruiting legions from non-citizens was taken by Caesar in <a href="Transalpine%20Gaul">Transalpine Gaul</a> (Latin: "Gallia Transalpina"), by <a href="Marcus%20Junius%20Brutus%20the%20Younger">Brutus</a> in <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedonia</a>, and by <a href="Pompey">Pompey</a> in <a href="Pharsalus">Pharsalus</a>. This irregular and extraordinary recruitment was not, however, typical of recruitment during this period, and Roman law still officially required that legions were recruited from Roman citizens only.

By the turn of the millennium, Emperor <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>' primary military concern was to prevent Roman generals from further usurping the imperial throne. The experience of Caesar and, earlier, Marius and <a href="Lucius%20Cornelius%20Sulla">Sulla</a>, had demonstrated the willingness of "emergency" (re-activated previously decommissioned) legions containing troops keen for plunder to follow their generals against the state. Augustus therefore removed the need for such emergency armies by increasing the size of the standing armies to a size sufficient to provide territorial defence on their own. Perhaps due to similar concerns, the legions and auxiliaries of the army were supplemented under the Emperor Augustus by an elite formation of guards dedicated to the protection of the Emperor. The first such unit was based in Rome and were known as the <a href="Praetorian%20Guard">Praetorian Guard</a>, and a second similar formation were known as the <a href="Cohortes%20urbanae">Cohortes urbanae</a>.

The legions, which had been a mix of life professionals and civilian campaigners, was altered into a standing army of professionals only. The actual structure of the cohort army remained much the same as in the late Republic, although around the 1st century AD the first cohort of each legion was increased in size to a total of 800 soldiers. However, while the structure of the legions remained much the same, their make-up gradually changed. Whereas early Republican legions had been raised by a draft from eligible Roman citizens, imperial legions were recruited solely on a voluntary basis and from a much wider base of manpower. Likewise, whereas Republican legions had been recruited almost exclusively in Italy, early Imperial legions drew most of their recruits from Roman colonies in the provinces from 68 AD onwards. One estimate places the proportion of Italian troops at 65% under Augustus in c. 1 AD, falling to around 49% by the end of Nero's reign.

Since the legions were officially open only to Roman citizens, Max Cary and <a href="Howard%20Hayes%20Scullard">Howard Hayes Scullard</a> argue that at least in some provinces at this time "many provincials must have been recruited who lacked any genuine claim to Roman citizenship but received it unofficially on enlistment," a practice that was to increase in the 2nd century. This is most likely in those provinces where the pool of Roman citizens was not large enough to fulfill the provincial army's recruitment needs. One possible example is <a href="Roman%20Britain">Britain</a>, where one estimate puts the citizen pool in the 1st century at only 50,000 out of a total provincial population of around two million.

At the same time as the legions underwent these transformations, the "auxilia" were reorganized and a number of allied troops were formalised into standing units similar to legions. Rather than being raised re-actively when required, the process of raising auxiliary troops was carried out in advance of conflicts according to annual targets. Whereas the internal organisation of the "auxilia" had previously been left up to their commanders, in the early empire they were organised into standardised units known as "turmae" (for cavalry "alae") and "centuriae" (for infantry "cohortes"). Although never becoming as standardised in their equipment as the legions, and often retaining some national flavour, the size of the units at least was standardised to some degree. Cavalry were formed into either an "ala quingenaria" of 512 horsemen, or an "ala millaria" of 1,000 horsemen. Likewise, infantry auxilia could be formed into a "cohors quingenaria" of 500 men or a "cohors millaria" of 1,000 men. Mixed cavalry/infantry auxiliaries were typically formed with a larger proportion of foot than horse troops: the "cohors equitata quingenaria" consisted of 380 foot and 120 horsemen, and the "cohors equitata millaria" consisted of 760 foot and 240 horsemen.

The vitality of the empire at this point was such that the use of native "auxilia" in the Roman army did not apparently barbarise the military as some scholars claim was to happen in the late empire. On the contrary, those serving in the "auxilia" during this period frequently strove to Romanise themselves. They were granted Roman citizenship on retirement, granting them several social advantages, and their sons became eligible for service in the legions.

As with the army, many non-Italians were recruited into the Roman Navy, partly because the Romans had never readily taken to the sea. It appears that the navy was considered to be slightly less prestigious than the "auxilia" but, like the "auxilia", troops could gain citizenship on discharge upon retirement. In terms of structure, each ship was staffed by a group of men approximately equivalent to a century, with ten ships forming a naval squadron.

Through the final years of the 1st century AD, the legions remained the backbone of the Roman army, although the "auxilia" in fact outnumbered them by up to half as much again. Within the legions, the proportion of troops recruited from within Italy fell gradually after 70 AD. By the close of the 1st century, this proportion had fallen to as low as 22 percent, with the remainder drawn from conquered provinces. Since technically only citizens were allowed to enlist in the legions, where recruits did not possess citizenship then, at least in some instances, citizenship "was simply given [to] them on enlistment". During this time, the borders of the Empire had remained relatively fixed to the extent originally reached under the Emperor <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a>. Because of this, the army was increasingly responsible for protecting existing frontiers rather than expanding into foreign territory, the latter of which had characterised the army's earlier existence. As a result, legions became stationed in largely fixed locations. Although entire legions were occasionally transferred into theatres of war, they remained largely rooted in one or more legionary bases in a province, detaching into smaller bodies of troops (Latin: "<a href="vexillationes">vexillationes</a>") on demand. This policy eventually led to a split of the military's land-based forces into mobile and fixed troops in the later Empire. In general, the best troops were dispatched as "vexillationes", and the remainder left to guard border defences were of lower quality, perhaps those with injuries or near retirement.

By the time of the emperor <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a> the proportion of Italians in the legions had fallen to just ten percent and provincial citizens now dominated. This low figure is probably a direct result of the changing needs of military staffing: a system of fixed border defences (Latin: "<a href="limes">limes</a>") were established around the Empire's periphery under Hadrian, consolidating Trajan's territorial gains. These called for troops to be stationed permanently in the provinces, a prospect more attractive to locally raised rather than Italian troops. The higher prestige and pay to be found in the Italian dominated <a href="Praetorian%20Guard">Praetorian Guard</a> must also have played a role. The majority of the troops in the legions at the start of the 3rd century AD were from the more Romanised (though non-Italian) provinces, especially <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>. As the century progressed, more and more barbarians (Latin: "<a href="barbarian">barbari</a>") were permitted to settle inside of, and tasked with aiding in the defence of, Rome's borders. As a result, greater numbers of barbarous and semi-barbarous peoples were gradually admitted to the army.
However, whether this regionalisation of the legions was partnered by a drop in the professionalism of the troops is contested. <a href="Antonio%20Santosuosso">Antonio Santosuosso</a> argues that the strict discipline and high motivation of the days of Marius had lapsed, but Andrew Alfoldi states that the Illyrian troops were both valiant and warlike, and <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> described <a href="Germanic%20peoples">German</a> recruits as being natural mercenaries (Latin: "vivi ad arma nati"). It seems that discipline in the legions did slacken, with soldiers granted permission to live with wives outside of military lodgings and permitted to adopt a more lavish and comfortable lifestyle, in contrast to the strict military regimen of earlier years. However, it is by no means certain that this led to any reduction in the effectiveness of the legions, due to the greater ferocity and stature of the "barbari" recruits. The flavour of the Roman military, however, was now dictated by the increasing number of regional recruits, leading to a partial barbarisation of Rome's military forces beginning in this period. The barbarisation of the lower ranks was paralleled by a concurrent barbarisation of its command structure, with the Roman senators who had traditionally provided its commanders becoming entirely excluded from the army. By 235 AD the <a href="Maximinus%20Thrax">Emperor himself</a>, the figurehead of the entire military, was a man born outside of Italy to non-Italian parents.

The gradual inclusion of greater numbers of non-citizen troops into the military was taken a further step by the creation under Hadrian of a new type of force in addition to the legions and "auxilia", known as "<a href="Numeri%20%28Roman%20troops%29">numeri</a>". Formed in bodies of around 300 irregular troops, the "numeri" were drawn from subjugate provinces and peoples of client-states or even from beyond the borders of the empire. They were both less regimented and less Romanised than auxiliary troops, with a "pronounced national character," including native dress and native war cries. The introduction of the "numeri" was a response to the need for cheap troops, who were nevertheless fierce and provided a force balance of light infantry and cavalry. They were therefore largely less well armed and less well trained than "auxilia" or legions, although more prestigious elite irregular native troops were also utilised. However, the legions still made up around one half of the Roman army at this point.

By the late Empire, enemy forces in both the East and West were "sufficiently mobile and sufficiently strong to pierce [the Roman] defensive perimeter on any selected axis of penetration"; from the 3rd century onwards, both Germanic tribes and Persian armies pierced the frontiers of the Roman Empire. In response, the Roman army underwent a series of changes, more organic and evolutionary than the deliberate military reforms of the Republic and early Empire. A stronger emphasis was placed upon ranged combat ability of all types, such as field artillery, hand-held "<a href="ballistae">ballistae</a>", archery and darts. Roman forces also gradually became more mobile, with one cavalryman for every three infantryman, compared to one in forty in the early Empire. Additionally, the Emperor <a href="Gallienus">Gallienus</a> took the revolutionary step of forming an entirely cavalry field army, which was kept as a mobile reserve at the city of <a href="Milan">Milan</a> in northern Italy. It is believed that Gallienus facilitated this concentration of cavalry by stripping the legions of their integral mounted element. A diverse range of cavalry regiments existed, including "<a href="Equites%20cataphractarii">catafractarii</a>" or "clibanarii", "<a href="scutarii">scutarii</a>", and legionary cavalry known as "<a href="promoti">promoti</a>". Collectively, these regiments were known as "equites". Around 275 AD, the proportion of "catafractarii" was also increased. There is some disagreement over exactly when the relative proportion of cavalry increased, whether Gallienus' reforms occurred contemporaneously with an increased reliance on cavalry, or whether these are two distinct events. Alfoldi appears to believe that Gallienus' reforms were contemporaneous with an increase in cavalry numbers. He argues that, by 258, Gallienus had made cavalry the predominant troop type in the Roman army in place of heavy infantry, which dominated earlier armies. According to <a href="Warren%20Treadgold">Warren Treadgold</a>, however, the proportion of cavalry did not change between the early 3rd and early 4th centuries.

Larger groups of "barbari" began to settle in Rome's territories around this time, and the troops they were contracted to provide to the Roman army were no longer organised as "numeri" but rather were the forerunners of the later rented native armies known as federated troops (Latin: "<a href="foederati">foederati</a>"). Though they served under Roman officers, the troops of these units were far more barbarised than the "numeri", lacked Romanisation of either military structure or personal ideology, and were ineligible for Roman citizenship upon discharge. These native troops were not permitted to fight in native war bands under their own leaders, unlike the later "foederati"; instead, these troops were split into small groups attached to other Roman units. They existed therefore as a halfway house between "numeri", who were encouraged to be Romanised, and the "foederati", who raised officers from their own ranks and were almost entirely self-dependent.

A distinction between frontier guard troops and more mobile reserve forces had emerged with the use of certain troops to permanently man frontiers such as Hadrian's Wall in "Britannia" in the 2nd century AD. The competing demands of manned frontiers and strategic reserve forces had led to the division of the military into four types of troops by the early 4th century:


The permanent field armies of the "palatini" and "comitatenses" ultimately derived from the temporary field armies of the earlier "sacer comitatus".

Created and expanded from the core troops of the Emperor's personal bodyguards, the central field armies by 295 AD seem to have been too large to be accounted for as simple bodyguard forces, but were still too small to be able to campaign independently of legionary or vexillation support.

Of the four troop types, the "limitanei" (border guards) were once considered to have been of the lowest quality, consisting largely of peasant-soldiers that were both "grossly inferior" to the earlier legions and inferior also to their counterparts in the mobile field armies. However, more recent work establishes that the "limitanei" were regular soldiers.

While the "limitanei" were supposed to deal with policing actions and low-intensity incursions, the duty of responding to more serious incidents fell upon the provincial troops. The countering of the very largest scale incursions on a strategic scale was the task of the "comitatenses" and "palatini" or mobile field troops, possibly accompanied by the emperor's "scholae". Both border and field armies consisted of a mix of infantry and cavalry units although the weight of cavalry was, according to some authorities, greater in the mobile field armies. Overall, approximately one quarter of the army consisted of cavalry troops but their importance is uncertain. Older works such as the Eleventh Edition of the "Encyclopædia Britannica" (1911) state that the Roman military of the late Empire was "marked by that predominance of the horseman which characterised the earlier centuries of the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>," but many more recent authors believe that the infantry remained predominant.

There is some dispute about whether this new military structure was put into place under the Emperor <a href="Diocletian">Diocletian</a> or Constantine since both reorganised the Roman Army in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries to some degree. Both Diocletian and even his predecessor of thirty years Gallienus may already have controlled mobile strategic reserves to assist the empire's border forces; either Diocletian or Constantine expanded this nascent force into permanent field armies.

Recruitment from amongst Roman citizens had become greatly curtailed as a consequence of a declining population, "cripplingly numerous" categories of those exempted from military service and the spread of Christianity with its pacifist message. Together, these factors culminated in "the withdrawal of the urban class from all forms of military activity." In their place, much of Rome's military were now recruited from non-Italian peoples living within the empire's borders. Many of these people were barbarians or semi-barbarians recently settled from lands beyond the empire, including several colonies of "<a href="Carpians">Carpi</a>", "<a href="Bastarnae">Bastarnae</a>" and "<a href="Sarmatians">Sarmatians</a>".

Although units described as "legiones" existed as late as the 5th century in both the border and field armies, the legionary system was very different from that of the principate and early empire. Since the term legion continued to be used, it is unclear exactly when the structure and role of the legions changed. In the 3rd or 4th century, however, the legions' role as elite heavy infantry was substantially reduced and may have evaporated entirely. Instead, those "legions" that remained were no longer drawn exclusively (and perhaps hardly at all) from Roman citizens. Either Diocletian or Constantine reorganised the legions into smaller infantry units who, according to some sources, were more lightly armoured than their forebears. Their lighter armament may have been either because they "would not consent to wear the same weight of body armour as the legionaries of old" or, as in at least one documented instance, because they were prohibited from wearing heavy armour by their general in order to increase their mobility. 4th-century legions were at times only one sixth the size of early imperial legions, and they were armed with some combination of spears, bows, slings, darts and swords, reflecting a greater contemporary emphasis on ranged fighting. The "auxilia" and "numeri" had also largely disappeared. Constantine further increased the proportion of German troops in the regular army; their cultural impact was so great that even legionaries began wearing German dress. At the start of Diocletian's reign, the Roman army numbered about 390,000 men, but by the end of his reign he successfully increased the number to 581,000 men.

By the late 4th century, the Empire had become chronically deficient in raising sufficient troops from amongst its own population. As an alternative, taxation raised internally was increasingly used to subsidise growing numbers of barbarian recruits. The Romans had, for some time, recruited individual non-Roman soldiers into regular military units. In 358 AD, this practice was accelerated by the wholescale adoption of the entire <a href="Salian%20Franks">Salian Franks</a> people into the Empire, providing a ready pool of such recruits. In return for being allowed to settle as "<a href="foederatii">foederatii</a>" in northern "<a href="Gaul">Gallia</a>" on the near side of the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a>, the Franks were expected to defend the Empire's borders in their territory and provide troops to serve in Roman units.

In 376, a large band of <a href="Goths">Goths</a> asked Emperor <a href="Valens">Valens</a> for permission to settle on the southern bank of the <a href="Danube%20River">Danube River</a> on terms similar to the Franks. The Goths were also accepted into the empire as "foederati"; however, they rebelled later that year and defeated the Romans at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Adrianople">Battle of Adrianople</a>. The heavy losses that the Roman military suffered during this defeat ironically forced the Roman Empire to rely still further on such "foederati" troops to supplement its forces. In 382, the practice was radically extended when federated troops were signed up "<a href="en%20masse">en masse</a>" as allied contingents of "laeti" and "foederatii" troops separate from existing Roman units. Near-constant civil wars during the period 408 and 433 between various Roman usurpers, emperors and their supposed deputies such as <a href="Constantine%20III%20%28Western%20Roman%20Emperor%29">Constantine III</a>, <a href="Constantius%20III">Constantius III</a>, <a href="Flavius%20Aetius">Aetius</a> and <a href="Bonifacius">Bonifacius</a> resulted in further losses, necessitating the handing over of more taxable land to foederati.

The size and composition of these allied forces remains in dispute. Santosuosso argues that "foederati" regiments consisted mostly of cavalry that were raised both as a temporary levy for a specific campaign need and, in some cases, as a permanent addition to the army. Hugh Elton believes that the importance of "foederati" has been overstated in traditional accounts by historians such as A.H.M. Jones. Elton argues that the majority of soldiers were probably non-Italian Roman citizens, while Santosuosso believes that the majority of troops were almost certainly non-citizen "barbari".

The non-federated mobile field army, known as the "comitatenses", was eventually split into a number of smaller field armies: a central field army under the emperor's direct control, known as the "comitatensis palatina" or "praesentalis", and several regional field armies. Historians Santosuosso and Vogt agree that the latter gradually degraded into low-quality garrison units similar to the "limitanei" that they either supplemented or replaced. By the 5th century, a significant portion of Western Rome's main military strength lay in rented barbarian mercenaries known as "foederati".

As the 5th century progressed, many of the Empire's original borders had been either wholly or partially denuded of troops to support the central field army. In 395, the Western Roman Empire had several regional field armies in Italy, <a href="Illyricum%20%28Roman%20province%29">Illyricum</a>, Gallia, Britannia and <a href="Africa%20Province">Africa</a>, and about twelve border armies. By about 430, two more field armies were established in <a href="Hispania">Hispania</a> and <a href="Tingitania">Tingitania</a> but the central government had lost control of Britannia as well as much of Gaul, Hispania, and Africa. In the same period, the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a> had two palatine field armies (at Constantinople), three regional field armies (in the East, in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, and in Illyricum) and fifteen frontier armies.
As Roman troops were spread increasingly thin over its long border, the Empire's territory continued to dwindle in size as the population of the empire declined. Barbarian war bands increasingly began to penetrate the Empire's vulnerable borders, both as settlers and invaders. In 451, the Romans defeated <a href="Attila%20the%20Hun">Attila the Hun</a>, but only with assistance from a confederation of "foederatii" troops, which included <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a>, <a href="Franks">Franks</a> and <a href="Alans">Alans</a>. As barbarian incursions continued, some advancing as far as the heart of Italy, Rome's borders began to collapse, with frontier forces swiftly finding themselves cut off deep in the enemy's rear.

Simultaneously, barbarian troops in Rome's pay came to be "in a condition of almost perpetual turbulence and revolt" from 409 onwards. In 476 these troops finally unseated the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire. The <a href="Byzantine%20army">Eastern Roman forces</a> continued to defend the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire until its <a href="Fall%20of%20Constantinople">fall in 1453</a>.

The former Oxford University historian <a href="Adrian%20Goldsworthy">Adrian Goldsworthy</a> has argued that the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire in the West should not be blamed on barbarization of the late Roman Army, but on its recurrent civil wars, which led to its inability to repel or defeat invasions from outside its frontiers. The East Roman or <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> empire on the other hand had fewer civil wars to contend with in the late fourth and early fifth centuries, or in the years from 383-432 A.D.

Burger's Daughter

Burger's Daughter is a <a href="Political%20fiction">political</a> and <a href="Historical%20fiction%23Historical%20novels">historical novel</a> by the South African <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a>-winner <a href="Nadine%20Gordimer">Nadine Gordimer</a>, first published in the United Kingdom in June 1979 by <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a>. The book was expected to be banned in South Africa, and a month after publication in London the import and sale of the book in South Africa was prohibited by the Publications Control Board. Three months later, the Publications Appeal Board overturned the banning and the restrictions were lifted.

"Burger's Daughter" details a group of white <a href="Internal%20resistance%20to%20apartheid">anti-apartheid</a> activists in South Africa seeking to overthrow the South African government. It is set in the mid-1970s, and follows the life of Rosa, the title character, as she comes to terms with her father Lionel Burger's legacy as an activist in the <a href="South%20African%20Communist%20Party">South African Communist Party</a> (SACP). The perspective shifts between Rosa's <a href="internal%20monologue">internal monologue</a> (often directed towards her father or her lover Conrad), and the omniscient narrator. The novel is rooted in the history of the anti-apartheid struggle and references to actual events and people from that period, including <a href="Nelson%20Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> and the 1976 <a href="Soweto%20uprising">Soweto uprising</a>.

Gordimer herself was involved in South African struggle politics, and she knew many of the activists, including <a href="Bram%20Fischer">Bram Fischer</a>, Mandela's treason trial defence lawyer. She modelled the Burger family in the novel loosely on Fischer's family, and described "Burger's Daughter" as "a coded homage" to Fischer. While banned in South Africa, a copy of the book was smuggled into Mandela's prison cell on <a href="Robben%20Island">Robben Island</a>, and he reported that he "thought well of it".

The novel was generally well-received by critics. A reviewer for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" said that "Burger's Daughter" is Gordimer's "most political and most moving novel", and a review in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Review%20of%20Books">The New York Review of Books</a>" described the style of writing as "elegant", "fastidious" and belonging to a "cultivated upper class". A critic in "<a href="The%20Hudson%20Review">The Hudson Review</a>" had mixed feelings about the book, saying that it "gives scarcely any pleasure in the reading but which one is pleased to have read nonetheless". "Burger's Daughter" won the <a href="Central%20News%20Agency%20Literary%20Award">Central News Agency Literary Award</a> in 1980.

The novel begins in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1974 during <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a>. Rosa is 26, and her father, Lionel Burger, a white <a href="Afrikaners">Afrikaner</a> <a href="Internal%20resistance%20to%20apartheid">anti-apartheid</a> activist, has died in prison after serving three years of a life sentence for treason. When she was 14, her mother, Cathy Burger, also died in prison. Rosa had grown up in a family that actively supported the overthrow of the apartheid government, and the house they lived in opened its doors to anyone supporting the struggle, regardless of colour. Living with them was "Baasie" (little boss), a black boy Rosa's age the Burgers had "adopted" when his father had died in prison. Baasie and Rosa grew up as brother and sister. Rosa's parents were members of the outlawed <a href="South%20African%20Communist%20Party">South African Communist Party</a> (SACP), and had been arrested several times when she was a child. When Rosa was nine, she was sent to stay with her father's family; Baasie was sent elsewhere, and she lost contact with him.

With the Burger's house now empty, Rosa sells it and moves in with Conrad, a student who had befriended her during her father's trial. Conrad questions her about her role in the Burger family and asks why she always did what she was told. Later Rosa leaves Conrad and moves into a <a href="apartment">flat</a> on her own and works as a <a href="Physical%20therapy">physiotherapist</a>. In 1975 Rosa attends a party of a friend in <a href="Soweto">Soweto</a>, and it is there that she hears a black university student dismissing all whites' help as irrelevant, saying that whites cannot know what blacks want, and that blacks will liberate themselves. Despite being labelled a Communist and under surveillance by the authorities, Rosa manages to get a passport, and flies to <a href="Nice">Nice</a> in France to spend several months with Katya, her father's first wife. There she meets Bernard Chabalier, a visiting academic from Paris. They become lovers and he persuades her to return with him to Paris.

Before joining Bernard in Paris, Rosa stays in a flat in London for several weeks. Now that she has no intention of honouring the agreement of her passport, which was to return to South Africa within a year, she openly introduces herself as Burger's daughter. This attracts the attention of the media and she attends several political events. At one such event, Rosa sees Baasie, but when she tries to talk to him, he starts criticising her for not knowing his real name (Zwelinzima Vulindlela). He says that there is nothing special about her father having died in prison as many black fathers have also died there, and adds that he does not need her help. Rosa is devastated by her childhood friend's hurtful remarks, and overcome with guilt, she abandons her plans of going into exile in France and returns to South Africa.

Back home she resumes her job as a physiotherapist in Soweto. Then in <a href="1976%20in%20South%20Africa%23June">June 1976</a> Soweto school children start protesting about their inferior education and being taught in <a href="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a>. They go on a rampage, which includes killing white welfare workers. The police brutally put down the <a href="Soweto%20uprising">uprising</a>, resulting in hundreds of deaths. In October 1977, many organisations and people critical of the white government are banned, and in November 1977 Rosa Burger is detained. Her lawyer, who also represented her father, expects charges to be brought against her of furthering the aims of the banned SACP and <a href="African%20National%20Congress">African National Congress</a> (ANC), and of aiding and abetting the students' revolt.

In a 1980 interview, Gordimer stated that she was fascinated by the role of "white hard-core Leftists" in South Africa, and that she had long envisaged the idea for "Burger's Daughter". Inspired by the work of <a href="Bram%20Fischer">Bram Fischer</a>, she published an essay about him in 1961 entitled "Why Did Bram Fischer Choose to Go to Jail?" Fischer was the Afrikaner <a href="advocate">advocate</a> and Communist who was <a href="Nelson%20Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>'s defence lawyer during his 1956 <a href="1956%20Treason%20Trial">Treason Trial</a> and his 1965 <a href="Rivonia%20Trial">Rivonia Trial</a>. As a friend of many of the activist families, including Fischer's, Gordimer knew these families' children were "politically groomed" for the struggle, and were taught that "the struggle came first" and they came second. She modelled the Burger family in the novel loosely on Fischer's family, and Lionel Burger on Fischer himself. While Gordimer never said the book was about Fischer, she did describe it as "a coded homage" to him. Before submitting the manuscript to her publisher, Gordimer gave it to Fischer's daughter, Ilse Wilson ("<a href="n%C3%A9e">née</a>" Fischer) to read, saying that, because of connections people might make to her family, she wanted her to see it first. When Wilson returned the manuscript to Gordimer, she told the writer, "You have captured the life that was ours." After Gordimer's death in July 2014, Wilson wrote that Gordimer "had the extraordinary ability to describe a situation and capture the lives of people she was not necessarily a part of."
Gordimer's homage to Fischer extends to using excerpts from his writings and public statements in the book. Lionel Burger's treason trial speech from the dock is taken from the speech Fischer gave at his own trial in 1966. Fischer was the leader of the banned SACP who was given a life sentence for furthering the aims of communism and conspiracy to overthrow the government. Quoting people like Fischer was not permitted in South Africa. All Gordimer's quotes from banned sources in "Burger's Daughter" are unattributed, and also include writings of <a href="Joe%20Slovo">Joe Slovo</a>, a member of the SACP and the outlawed ANC, and a pamphlet written and distributed by the Soweto Students Representative Council during the Soweto uprising.

Gordimer herself became involved in South African struggle politics after the arrest of a friend, Bettie du Toit, in 1960 for trade unionist activities and being a member of the SACP. Just as Rosa Burger in the novel visits family in prison, so Gordimer visited her friend. Later in 1986, Gordimer gave evidence at the <a href="Delmas%20Treason%20Trial">Delmas Treason Trial</a> in support of 22 ANC members accused of treason. She was a member of the ANC while it was still an illegal organization in South Africa, and hid several ANC leaders in her own home to help them evade arrest by the security forces.

The inspiration for "Burger's Daughter" came when Gordimer was waiting to visit a political detainee in prison, and amongst the other visitors she saw a school girl, the daughter of an activist she knew. She wondered what this child was thinking and what family obligations were making her stand there. The novel opens with the same scene: a 14-year-old Rosa Burger waiting outside a prison to visit her detained mother. Gordimer said that children like these, whose activist parents were frequently arrested and detained, periodically had to manage entire households on their own, and it must have changed their lives completely. She stated that it was these children who encouraged her to write the book.

"Burger's Daughter" took Gordimer four years to write, starting from a handful of what she called "very scrappy notes", "half sentences" and "little snatches of dialogue". Collecting information for the novel was difficult because at the time little was known about South African communists. Gordimer relied on clandestine books and documents given to her by confidants, and her own experiences of living in South Africa. Once she got going, she said, writing the book became an "organic process". The Soweto riots in 1976 happened while she was working on the book, and she changed the plot to incorporate the uprising. Gordimer explained that "Rosa would have come back to South Africa; that was inevitable", but "[t]here would have been a different ending". During those four years she also wrote two non-fiction articles to take breaks from working on the novel.

Gordimer remarked that, more than just a story about white communists in South Africa, "Burger's Daughter" is about "commitment" and what she as a writer does to "make sense of life". After Mandela and Fischer were sentenced in the mid-1960s, Gordimer considered going into exile, but she changed her mind and later recalled "I wouldn't be accepted as I was here, even in the worst times and even though I'm white". Just as Rosa struggles to find her place as a white in the anti-apartheid liberation movement, so did Gordimer. In an interview in 1980, she said that "when we have got beyond the apartheid situation—there's a tremendous problem for whites, unless whites are allowed in by blacks, and unless we can make out a case for our being accepted and we can forge a common culture together, whites are going to be marginal".

Gordimer knew that "Burger's Daughter" would be banned in South Africa. After the book was published in London by <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a> in June 1979, copies were dispatched to South Africa, and on 5 July 1979 the book "was" banned from import and sale in South Africa. The reasons given by the Publications Control Board included "propagating Communist opinions", "creating a psychosis of revolution and rebellion", and "making several unbridled attacks against the authority entrusted with the maintenance of law and order and the safety of the state".
In October 1979 the Publications Appeal Board, on the recommendation of a panel of literary experts and a state security specialist, overruled the banning of "Burger's Daughter". The state security specialist reported the book posed no threat to the security of South Africa, and the literary experts had accused the censorship board "of bias, prejudice, and literary incompetence", and that "[i]t has not read accurately, it has severely distorted by quoting extensively out of context, it has not considered the work as a literary work deserves to be considered, and it has directly, and by implication, smeared the authoress [sic]." Notwithstanding the unbanning, the chairman of the Appeal Board told a press reporter, "Don't buy [the book]—it is not worth buying. Very badly written ... This is also why we eventually passed it." The Appeal Board described the book as "one-sided" in its attack on whites and the South African Government, and concluded, "As a result ... the effect of the book will be counterproductive rather than subversive."

Gordimer's response to the novel's unbanning was, "I was indifferent to the opinions of the original censorship committee who neither read nor understood the book properly in the first place, and to those of the committee of literary experts who made this discovery, since both are part of the censorship system." She attributed the unbanning to her international stature and the "serious attention" the book had received abroad. A number of prominent authors and literary organisations had protested the banning, including <a href="Iris%20Murdoch">Iris Murdoch</a>, <a href="Heinrich%20B%C3%B6ll">Heinrich Böll</a>, <a href="Paul%20Theroux">Paul Theroux</a>, <a href="John%20Fowles">John Fowles</a>, <a href="Frank%20Kermode">Frank Kermode</a>, <a href="Association%20of%20American%20Publishers">The Association of American Publishers</a> and <a href="PEN%20International">International PEN</a>. Gordimer objected to the unbanning of the book because she felt the government was trying placate her with "special treatment", and said that the same thing would not have happened had she been black. But she did describe the action as "something of a precedent for other writers" because in the book she had published a copy of an actual pamphlet written and distributed by students in the 1976 Soweto uprising, which the authorities had banned. She said that similar "transgressions" in the future would be difficult for the censors to clamp down on.
While "Burger's Daughter" was still banned in South Africa, a copy was smuggled into Nelson Mandela's prison cell on <a href="Robben%20Island">Robben Island</a>, and later a message was sent out saying that he had "thought well of it". Gordimer said, "That means more to me than any other opinion it could have gained." Mandela also requested a meeting with her, and she applied several times to visit him on the Island, but was declined each time. She was, however, at the prison gates waiting for him when he was released in 1990, and she was amongst the first he wanted to talk to. In 2007 Gordimer sent Mandela an inscribed copy of "Burger's Daughter" to "replace the 'imprisoned' copy", and in it she thanked him for his opinion of the book, and for "untiringly leading the struggle".

To voice her disapproval of the banning and unbanning of the book, Gordimer published "<a href="What%20Happened%20to%20Burger%27s%20Daughter%20or%20How%20South%20African%20Censorship%20Works">What Happened to Burger's Daughter or How South African Censorship Works</a>", a book of essays written by her and others. It was published in Johannesburg in 1980 by Taurus, a small <a href="Underground%20press">underground</a> publishing house established in the late-1970s to print anti-apartheid literature and other material South African publishers would avoid for fear of censorship. Its publications were generally distributed privately or sent to bookshops to be given to customers free to avoid attracting the attention of the South African authorities.

"What Happened to Burger's Daughter" has two essays by Gordimer and one by <a href="University%20of%20the%20Witwatersrand">University of the Witwatersrand</a> law professor <a href="John%20Dugard">John Dugard</a>. Gordimer's essays document the publication history and fate of "Burger's Daughter", and respond to the Publications Control Board's reasons for banning the book. Dugard's essay examines censorship in South Africa within the country's legal framework. Also included in the book is the Director of Publications's communiqué stating its reasons for banning the book, and the reasons for lifting the ban three months later by the Publications Appeal Board.

"Burger's Daughter" was first published in the United Kingdom, in hardcover, in June 1979 by <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a>, and October that year in the United States, also in hardcover, by <a href="Viking%20Press">Viking Press</a>. The first paperback edition was published in the United Kingdom in November 1980 by <a href="Penguin%20Books">Penguin Books</a>. A unabridged 12-hour-51-minute audio cassette edition, narrated by Nadia May, was released in the United States in July 1993 by <a href="Blackstone%20Audio">Blackstone Audio</a>.

"Burger's Daughter" has been translated into several other languages since its first publication in English in 1979:

The <a href="narrative%20mode">narrative mode</a> of "Burger's Daughter" alternates between Rosa Burger's <a href="internal%20monologue">internal monologue</a>s and the anonymous narrator, whom Gordimer calls "Rosa's conscious analysis, her reasoning approach to her life and to this country, and ... my exploration as a writer of what she doesn't know even when she "thinks" she's finding out". Abdul R. JanMohamed, professor of English and African American Literature at <a href="Emory%20University">Emory University</a>, calls this change of perspective a "stylistic bifurcation", which allows the reader to see Rosa from different points of view, rendering her a complex character who is full of contradictions. The two narratives, the subjective and the objective viewpoints, complement each other. JanMohamed explains that while the objective, <a href="third-person%20narrative">third-person narrative</a> is factual and neutral, the subjective <a href="first-person%20narrative">first-person narrative</a>, Rosa's voice, is intense and personal. Rosa's monologues are directed towards Conrad, her lover, in the first part of the story, her father's former wife, Katya, while Rosa is in France, and her father after she returns to South Africa. Because her imagined audience is always sympathetic and never questions her, Rosa's confessions are honest and open.

According to academic Robin Ellen Visel, Rosa is a complicated person, with roles thrust on her by her parents, which suppresses her own goals and desires. Gordimer explained how she constructed the book's narrative structure to convey this struggle and explain Rosa: "[T]he idea came to me of Rosa questioning herself as others see her and whether what they see is what she really is. And that developed into another stylistic question—if you're going to tell the book in the first person, to whom are you talking?" This led to Gordimer creating Conrad and Katya for Rosa to use as <a href="sounding%20board">sounding board</a>s to question and explain herself.

Irene Kacandes, professor of German Studies and Comparative Literature at <a href="Dartmouth%20College">Dartmouth College</a>, calls Rosa's internal monologues <a href="apostrophe%20%28figure%20of%20speech%29">apostrophe</a>s, or "intrapsychic witnessing", in which "a character witnesses to the self about the character's own experience". Kacandes points out that Rosa believes she would not be able to internalise anything if she knew someone was listening. In an apostrophe addressed to Conrad, Rosa remarks, "If you knew I was talking to you I wouldn't be able to talk". But because Rosa is not vocalising her monologues, no one can hear her, and she is able to proceed with her self-analysis unhindered. Kacandes says "Rosa imagines an interlocutor and then occupies that place herself."

Gordimer uses <a href="Non-English%20usage%20of%20quotation%20marks%23Quotation%20dash">quotation dashes</a> to punctuate her dialogue in "Burger's Daughter" instead of traditional <a href="quotation%20mark">quotation mark</a>s. She told an interviewer in 1980 that readers have complained that this sometimes makes it difficult to identify the speaker, but she added "I don't care. I simply cannot stand he-said/she-said anymore. And if I can't make readers "know" who’s speaking from the tone of voice, the turns of phrase, well, then I've failed."

<poem>
Sometimes he was not asleep when he appeared to be. —What was your song?——Song?— Squatting on the floor cleaning up crumbs of bark and broken leaf.—You were singing.——What? Was I?— She had filled a dented Benares brass pot with loquat branches.—For the joy of living.—She looked to see if he were making fun of her. —I didn't know.——But you never doubted it for a moment. Your family.—She did not turn to him that profile of privacy with which he was used to meeting. —Suppose not.—
</poem>

Visel says that the use of dashes for dialogue "conveys the sense of conversation set within the flow of memory" and "is congruent with the sense of Rosa speaking essentially to herself, speakers and listeners in her conversations being dead or unreachable."

Some commentators have classified "Burger's Daughter" as a <a href="Political%20fiction">political</a> and <a href="Historical%20fiction%23Historical%20novels">historical novel</a>. In their book "Socialist Cultures East and West: A Post-Cold War Reassessment", M. Keith Booker and Dubravka Juraga call Gordimer's work one of the "representative examples of African historical novels", saying that it is an "intense engagement with the history of apartheid in South Africa". Academic Robert Boyers calls it "one of the best political novels of our period", and an historical novel because of its "retrospective homage to generations past". Gordimer herself described "Burger's Daughter" as "an historical critique", and a political novel, which she defines as a work that "explicates the effects of politics on human lives and, unlike a political tract, does not propagate an ideology".

Visel calls the novel "fictionalised history" that shadows the history of anti-apartheid activism in South Africa, from 1946 and the <a href="1946%20African%20Mine%20Workers%27%20Union%20strike">African Mine Workers' Strike</a> (Lionel and Cathy's marriage), to 1977 and the clampdown on dissidents (Rosa's detention). Other notable events include the coming to power of the <a href="National%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29">National Party</a> in 1948 (Rosa's year of birth), the Treason Trial of Nelson Mandela and others in 1956, the <a href="Sharpeville%20massacre">Sharpeville massacre</a> in 1960, and the Soweto uprising in 1976 (Rosa's return to South Africa). Dominic Head writes in his book "Nadine Gordimer" that in "Burger's Daughter" "the life of ... Rosa ... runs in parallel with the history of modern South Africa".

Several critics have called "Burger's Daughter" a "<a href="Bildungsroman">Bildungsroman</a>", or <a href="coming-of-age%20story">coming-of-age story</a>, although not the traditional ones which, according to Susan Gardner in her essay "Still Waiting for the Great Feminist Novel", are dominated by male protagonists. While Gordimer was not a feminist author and "Burger's Daughter" is not a feminist novel, Gardner suggests that the book has "a discernible woman-concerned subtext", making it "impossible for feminists to dismiss or ignore". She says it has "a potential feminist awareness" that is "obscured by more conventional patriarchal writing codes". Yelin writes that after the death of Rosa's mother, the statement "Already she had taken on her mother's role in the household, giving loving support to her father" illustrates "the continuing hegemony of bourgeois-patriarchal ideology" in the novel. Yelin suggests that this inconsistency is responsible for Rosa's struggle, the "contradiction between feminism (Rosa's liberation as a woman) and the struggle for justice in South Africa".

Gordimer says Rosa's role in society is imprinted on her from a young age by her activist parents, and she grows up in the shadow of her father's political legacy. Scholar Carol P. Marsh-Lockett writes that everyone sees Rosa as Lionel Burger's daughter with duties and responsibilities to her father, and not Rosa the individual. In fulfilling these expectations, she denies herself an identity of her own. JanMohamed says it is only when Conrad encourages her to look beyond her self-sacrifices that Rosa starts examining the conflicts in her life, namely her commitment to help others versus her desire for a private life. In an attempt to resolve these conflicts, Rosa contemplates turning to blacks, but she is wary of this because, according to the book's anonymous narrator, white South Africans tend to use blacks as a way "of perceiving sensual redemption, as romantics do, or of perceiving fears, as racialists do". JanMohamed notes that Rosa's father was a romantic who established genuine friendships with blacks to overcome his "sensual redemption", but she is unsure of where she stands. Visel says that Rosa's only way to free herself from these commitments to her family and the revolution is to "defect" and go to France. John Cooke, in his essay "Leaving the Mother's House", notes that "By putting her defection in such stark terms, Gordimer makes her strongest statement of the need, whatever the consequence, of a child to claim a life of her own".

Many of Gordimer's works have explored the impact of apartheid on individuals in South Africa. Journalist and novelist <a href="George%20Packer">George Packer</a> writes that, as in several of her novels, a theme in "Burger's Daughter" is of racially divided societies in which well-meaning whites unexpectedly encounter a side of black life they did not know about. Literary critic Carolyn Turgeon says that while Lionel was able to work with black activists in the ANC, Rosa discovers that with the rise of the <a href="Black%20Consciousness%20Movement">Black Consciousness Movement</a>, many young blacks tend to view white liberals as irrelevant in their struggle for liberation. Rosa witnesses this first hand listening to the black university student in Soweto (Duma Dhladhla) and, later, in London, her childhood friend "Baasie" (Zwelinzima Vulindlela), who both dismiss her father as unimportant.

Author and academic Louise Yelin says that Gordimer's novels often feature white South Africans opposed to apartheid and racism who try to find their place in a multiracial society. Gordimer suggested options for whites in a 1959 essay "Where Do Whites Fit In?", but the rise of Black Consciousness in the 1970s questioned whites' involvement in the liberation struggle. Stephen Clingman has suggested in "The Novels of Nadine Gordimer: History from the Inside" that "Burger's Daughter" is Gordimer's response to the Black Consciousness Movement and an investigation into a "role for whites in the context of Soweto and after".

Gordimer wrote in an essay in "What Happened to Burger's Daughter" that "The theme of my novel is human conflict between the desire to live a personal, private life, and the rival claim of social responsibility to one's fellow men". Dominic Head says that Gordimer's novels often experiment with the relation of "public and private realms", and that "Burger's Daughter" "represents one of the peaks in this experimentation". Boyers notes that the theme of "public and private", and the relation between them, is balanced in the book "so as to privilege neither one not the other".

According to Packer, another common theme in Gordimer's novels is the choices ordinary people who live in oppressive regimes are forced to make. Literary critics Turgeon and Carli Coetzee explain that when she realises that whites are not always welcome in the anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's struggle and leaves the country. Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity, and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: to have a life of her own while still remaining politically committed.

"Burger's Daughter" was generally well-received by critics. <a href="Anthony%20Sampson">Anthony Sampson</a>, a British writer, journalist and former editor of "<a href="Drum%20%28South%20African%20magazine%29">Drum</a>", a magazine in Johannesburg in the 1950s, wrote in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" that this is Gordimer's "most political and most moving novel". He said that its "political authenticity" set in the "historical background of real people" makes it "harshly realistic", and added that the blending of people, landscapes and politics remind one of the great Russian pre-revolutionary novels. In "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Review%20of%20Books">The New York Review of Books</a>", Irish politician, writer and historian <a href="Conor%20Cruise%20O%27Brien">Conor Cruise O'Brien</a> compared Gordimer's writing to that of Russian novelist <a href="Ivan%20Turgenev">Ivan Turgenev</a>, and described "Burger's Daughter" as "elegant" and "fastidious" and belonging to a "cultivated upper class". He said this style is not at odds with the subject matter of the story because Rosa Burger, daughter of a revolutionary, believes herself to be an "aristocrat of the revolution".

Tess Lemmon writing in the "<a href="New%20Internationalist">New Internationalist</a>" magazine called "Burger's Daughter" "arguably [Gordimer's] best novel", and complimented her on her <a href="Characterization">characterisation</a>, attention to detail, and ability to blend "the personal and the political". Lemmon noted that the book's "subtle, lyrical writing" brings the reader into the characters' minds, which "is an enlivening but uncomfortable place to be". In a review of Gordimer's 1980 story collection, "A Soldier's Embrace" in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Book%20Review">The New York Times Book Review</a>", American novelist and critic A. G. Mojtabai stated that despite the troubled times Gordimer lived through at the time she wrote "Burger's Daughter", she remained "subdued" and "sober", and even though she "scarcely raise[d] her voice", it still "reverberate[d] over a full range of emotion".

In a review of the book in "<a href="World%20Literature%20Today">World Literature Today</a>", Sheila Roberts said that Gordimer's mixture of first- and third-person narrative is "an interesting device" which is "superbly handled" by the author. She commented that it allows the reader to get inside Rosa, and then step back and observe her from a distance. Roberts described Gordimer's handling of Rosa's predicament, continuing the role her father had given her versus abandoning the struggle and finding herself, as "extremely moving and memorable". In "<a href="The%20Sewanee%20Review">The Sewanee Review</a>" Bruce King wrote that "Burger's Daughter" is a "large, richly complex, densely textured novel". He said that it "fill[s] with unresolvable ironies and complications" as Gordimer explores the dilemmas faced by her characters in the South African political landscape.

American writer <a href="Joseph%20Epstein%20%28writer%29">Joseph Epstein</a> had mixed feelings about the book. He wrote in "<a href="The%20Hudson%20Review">The Hudson Review</a>" that it is a novel that "gives scarcely any pleasure in the reading but which one is pleased to have read nonetheless". Epstein complained about it being "a mighty slow read" with "off the mark" descriptions and "stylistic infelicities". He felt that big subjects sometimes "relieve a novelist of the burdens of nicety of style". Epstein said that reading the book is like "looking at a mosaic very close up, tile by tile", and that the big picture only emerges near the end. But he complimented Gordimer on the way in which she unravels Rosa's fate, saying that it is "a tribute to her art".

Despite being banned in South Africa, "Burger's Daughter" won the 1980 <a href="Central%20News%20Agency%20Literary%20Award">Central News Agency (CNA) Literary Award</a>, a prominent literary award in that country. In 1991 Gordimer was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> for her works of "intense immediacy" and "extremely complicated personal and social relationships in her environment". During the award ceremony speech by <a href="Sture%20All%C3%A9n">Sture Allén</a>, Permanent Secretary of the <a href="Swedish%20Academy">Swedish Academy</a>, "Burger's Daughter" was cited as one of Gordimer's novels in which "artistry and morality fuse".

In 2001 the novel was named one of South Africa's top 10 books in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" in the United Kingdom by author <a href="Gillian%20Slovo">Gillian Slovo</a>, daughter of South African anti-apartheid activists <a href="Joe%20Slovo">Joe Slovo</a> and <a href="Ruth%20First">Ruth First</a>. Following Gordimer's death in 2014, "The Guardian" and "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine put "Burger's Daughter" in their list of the top five Gordimer books. Indian writer <a href="Neel%20Mukherjee%20%28writer%29">Neel Mukherjee</a> included "Burger's Daughter" in his 2015 "top 10 books about revolutionaries", also published in "The Guardian".

Plutonium

Plutonium is a <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive</a> <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Pu and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 94. It is an <a href="actinide">actinide</a> <a href="metal">metal</a> of silvery-gray appearance that <a href="tarnish">tarnish</a>es when exposed to air, and forms a dull coating when <a href="plutonium%28IV%29%20oxide">oxidized</a>. The element normally exhibits six <a href="allotrope">allotrope</a>s and four <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a>s. It reacts with <a href="carbon">carbon</a>, <a href="halogen">halogen</a>s, <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, <a href="silicon">silicon</a>, and <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>. When exposed to moist air, it forms <a href="oxide">oxide</a>s and <a href="hydride">hydride</a>s that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake off as a powder that is <a href="pyrophoricity">pyrophoric</a>. It is radioactive and can accumulate in <a href="bone">bone</a>s, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.

Plutonium was first produced and isolated on December 14, 1940, by a deuteron bombardment of <a href="uranium-238">uranium-238</a> in the 1.5 metre (60 in) <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>. First <a href="neptunium-238">neptunium-238</a> (<a href="half-life">half-life</a> 2.1 days) was synthesized which subsequently beta-decayed to form this new element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238 (half-life 87.7 years). Since <a href="uranium">uranium</a> had been named after the planet <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a> and <a href="neptunium">neptunium</a> after the planet <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a>, element 94 was named after <a href="Pluto">Pluto</a>, which at the time was considered to be a planet as well. Wartime secrecy prevented its discovery being announced until 1948. Plutonium is the element with the highest atomic number to occur in nature. Trace quantities arise in natural uranium-238 deposits when U-238 captures neutrons emitted by decay of other U-238 atoms. Plutonium is much more common on Earth since 1945 as a product of <a href="neutron%20capture">neutron capture</a> and <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a>, where some of the <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s released by the <a href="nuclear%20fission">fission</a> process convert uranium-238 nuclei into plutonium-239.

Both <a href="plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a> and <a href="plutonium-241">plutonium-241</a> are <a href="fissile">fissile</a>, meaning that they can sustain a <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a>, leading to applications in <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s and <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s. <a href="Plutonium-240">Plutonium-240</a> exhibits a high rate of <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a>, raising the <a href="neutron%20flux">neutron flux</a> of any sample containing it. The presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium sample's usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel, and the percentage of plutonium-240 determines its <a href="reactor-grade%20plutonium">grade</a> (<a href="weapons-grade">weapons-grade</a>, fuel-grade, or reactor-grade). <a href="Plutonium-238">Plutonium-238</a> has a half-life of 88 years and emits <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s. It is a heat source in <a href="radioisotope%20thermoelectric%20generator">radioisotope thermoelectric generator</a>s, which are used to power some <a href="spacecraft">spacecraft</a>. Plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate, so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors.

Producing plutonium in useful quantities for the first time was a major part of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> that developed the first atomic bombs. The <a href="Fat%20Man">Fat Man</a> bombs used in the <a href="Trinity%20%28nuclear%20test%29">Trinity</a> <a href="nuclear%20test">nuclear test</a> in July 1945, and in the <a href="bombing%20of%20Nagasaki">bombing of Nagasaki</a> in August 1945, had plutonium <a href="pit%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">cores</a>. <a href="Human%20radiation%20experiments">Human radiation experiments</a> studying plutonium were conducted without <a href="informed%20consent">informed consent</a>, and several <a href="criticality%20accident">criticality accident</a>s, some lethal, occurred after the war. Disposal of <a href="nuclear%20waste">plutonium waste</a> from <a href="nuclear%20power%20plant">nuclear power plant</a>s and <a href="nuclear%20disarmament">dismantled nuclear weapons</a> built during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> is a <a href="nuclear%20proliferation">nuclear-proliferation</a> and environmental concern. Other sources of <a href="plutonium%20in%20the%20environment">plutonium in the environment</a> are <a href="nuclear%20fallout">fallout</a> from numerous above-ground nuclear tests, now <a href="Partial%20Test%20Ban%20Treaty">banned</a>.

Plutonium, like most metals, has a bright silvery appearance at first, much like <a href="nickel">nickel</a>, but it <a href="plutonium%28IV%29%20oxide">oxidizes</a> very quickly to a dull gray, although yellow and olive green are also reported. At room temperature plutonium is in its <a href="allotropes%20of%20plutonium">α ("alpha") form</a>. This, the most common structural form of the element (<a href="allotrope">allotrope</a>), is about as hard and brittle as <a href="cast%20iron%23Grey%20cast%20iron">gray cast iron</a> unless it is <a href="alloy">alloy</a>ed with other metals to make it soft and ductile. Unlike most metals, it is not a good conductor of <a href="thermal%20conductivity">heat</a> or <a href="electrical%20conductivity">electricity</a>. It has a low <a href="melting%20point">melting point</a> (640 °C) and an unusually high <a href="boiling%20point">boiling point</a> (3,228 °C).

<a href="Alpha%20decay">Alpha decay</a>, the release of a high-energy <a href="helium">helium</a> nucleus, is the most common form of <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive decay</a> for plutonium. A 5 kg mass of Pu contains about atoms. With a half-life of 24,100 years, about of its atoms decay each second by emitting a 5.157 <a href="MeV">MeV</a> alpha particle. This amounts to 9.68 watts of power. Heat produced by the deceleration of these alpha particles makes it warm to the touch.

<a href="Resistivity">Resistivity</a> is a measure of how strongly a material opposes the flow of <a href="electric%20current">electric current</a>. The resistivity of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal, and it gets even higher with lower temperatures, which is unusual for metals. This trend continues down to 100 <a href="Kelvin">K</a>, below which resistivity rapidly decreases for fresh samples. Resistivity then begins to increase with time at around 20 K due to radiation damage, with the rate dictated by the isotopic composition of the sample.

Because of self-irradiation, a sample of plutonium fatigues throughout its crystal structure, meaning the ordered arrangement of its atoms becomes disrupted by radiation with time. Self-irradiation can also lead to <a href="annealing%20%28metallurgy%29">annealing</a> which counteracts some of the fatigue effects as temperature increases above 100 K.

Unlike most materials, plutonium increases in density when it melts, by 2.5%, but the liquid metal exhibits a linear decrease in density with temperature. Near the melting point, the liquid plutonium has very high <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a> and <a href="surface%20tension">surface tension</a> compared to other metals.

Plutonium normally has six allotropes and forms a seventh (zeta, ζ) at high temperature within a limited pressure range. These allotropes, which are different structural modifications or forms of an element, have very similar <a href="internal%20energy">internal energies</a> but significantly varying <a href="density">densities</a> and <a href="crystal%20structure">crystal structure</a>s. This makes plutonium very sensitive to changes in temperature, pressure, or chemistry, and allows for dramatic volume changes following <a href="phase%20transition">phase transition</a>s from one allotropic form to another. The densities of the different allotropes vary from 16.00 g/cm to 19.86 g/cm.

The presence of these many allotropes makes machining plutonium very difficult, as it changes state very readily. For example, the α form exists at room temperature in unalloyed plutonium. It has machining characteristics similar to <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a> but changes to the plastic and malleable β ("beta") form at slightly higher temperatures. The reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood. The α form has a low-symmetry <a href="monoclinic%20crystal%20system">monoclinic</a> structure, hence its brittleness, strength, compressibility, and poor thermal conductivity.

Plutonium in the δ ("delta") form normally exists in the 310 °C to 452 °C range but is stable at room temperature when alloyed with a small percentage of <a href="gallium">gallium</a>, <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, or <a href="cerium">cerium</a>, enhancing workability and allowing it to be <a href="welding">welded</a>. The δ form has more typical metallic character, and is roughly as strong and malleable as aluminium. In fission weapons, the explosive <a href="shock%20wave">shock wave</a>s used to compress a plutonium core will also cause a transition from the usual δ phase plutonium to the denser α form, significantly helping to achieve <a href="supercriticality">supercriticality</a>. The ε phase, the highest temperature solid allotrope, exhibits anomalously high atomic <a href="self-diffusion">self-diffusion</a> compared to other elements.

Plutonium is a radioactive <a href="actinide">actinide</a> metal whose <a href="isotope">isotope</a>, <a href="plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a>, is one of the three primary <a href="fissile">fissile</a> isotopes (<a href="uranium-233">uranium-233</a> and <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a> are the other two); <a href="plutonium-241">plutonium-241</a> is also highly fissile. To be considered fissile, an isotope's <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nucleus</a> must be able to break apart or <a href="nuclear%20fission">fission</a> when struck by a <a href="neutron%20temperature">slow moving neutron</a> and to release enough additional neutrons to sustain the <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a> by splitting further nuclei.

Pure plutonium-239 may have a <a href="four%20factor%20formula">multiplication factor</a> (k) larger than one, which means that if the metal is present in sufficient quantity and with an appropriate geometry (e.g., a sphere of sufficient size), it can form a <a href="critical%20mass">critical mass</a>. During fission, a fraction of the <a href="nuclear%20binding%20energy">nuclear binding energy</a>, which holds a nucleus together, is released as a large amount of electromagnetic and kinetic energy (much of the latter being quickly converted to thermal energy). Fission of a kilogram of plutonium-239 can produce an explosion equivalent to . It is this energy that makes plutonium-239 useful in <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s and <a href="nuclear%20reactor">reactors</a>.

The presence of the isotope <a href="plutonium-240">plutonium-240</a> in a sample limits its nuclear bomb potential, as plutonium-240 has a relatively high <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a> rate (~440 fissions per second per gram—over 1,000 neutrons per second per gram), raising the background neutron levels and thus increasing the risk of <a href="fizzle%20%28nuclear%20test%29">predetonation</a>. Plutonium is identified as either <a href="weapons-grade">weapons-grade</a>, fuel-grade, or reactor-grade based on the percentage of plutonium-240 that it contains. Weapons-grade plutonium contains less than 7% plutonium-240. <a href="reactor-grade%20plutonium">Fuel-grade plutonium</a> contains from 7% to less than 19%, and power reactor-grade contains 19% or more plutonium-240. <a href="plutonium-239%23Supergrade%20plutonium">Supergrade plutonium</a>, with less than 4% of plutonium-240, is used in <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> weapons stored in proximity to ship and submarine crews, due to its lower radioactivity. The isotope <a href="plutonium-238">plutonium-238</a> is not <a href="fissile%23Fissile%20vs%20fissionable">fissile but can undergo nuclear fission</a> easily with <a href="fast%20neutrons">fast neutrons</a> as well as alpha decay.

Twenty <a href="radioisotope">radioactive isotopes</a> of plutonium have been characterized. The longest-lived are plutonium-244, with a half-life of 80.8 million years, plutonium-242, with a half-life of 373,300 years, and plutonium-239, with a half-life of 24,110 years. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 7,000 years. This element also has eight <a href="meta%20state">metastable states</a>, though all have half-lives less than one second.

The known isotopes of plutonium range in <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a> from 228 to 247. The primary decay modes of isotopes with mass numbers lower than the most stable isotope, plutonium-244, are spontaneous fission and <a href="alpha%20emission">alpha emission</a>, mostly forming uranium (92 <a href="proton">proton</a>s) and <a href="neptunium">neptunium</a> (93 protons) isotopes as <a href="decay%20product">decay product</a>s (neglecting the wide range of daughter nuclei created by fission processes). The primary decay mode for isotopes with mass numbers higher than plutonium-244 is <a href="beta%20emission">beta emission</a>, mostly forming <a href="americium">americium</a> (95 protons) isotopes as decay products. Plutonium-241 is the <a href="parent%20isotope">parent isotope</a> of the <a href="neptunium%20decay%20series">neptunium decay series</a>, decaying to americium-241 via beta emission.

Plutonium-238 and 239 are the most widely synthesized isotopes. Plutonium-239 is synthesized via the following reaction using uranium (U) and neutrons (n) via beta decay (β) with neptunium (Np) as an intermediate:

</chem>

Neutrons from the fission of uranium-235 are <a href="neutron%20capture">captured</a> by uranium-238 nuclei to form uranium-239; a <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> converts a neutron into a proton to form neptunium-239 (half-life 2.36 days) and another beta decay forms plutonium-239. <a href="Egon%20Bretscher">Egon Bretscher</a> working on the British <a href="Tube%20Alloys">Tube Alloys</a> project predicted this reaction theoretically in 1940.

Plutonium-238 is synthesized by bombarding uranium-238 with <a href="deuteron">deuteron</a>s (D, the nuclei of heavy <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>) in the following reaction:

War against Nabis

The War against Nabis, or the Laconian War, of 195 BC was fought between the Greek city-state of <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a> and a coalition composed of <a href="Roman%20Republic">Rome</a>, the <a href="Achaean%20League">Achaean League</a>, <a href="Pergamum">Pergamum</a>, <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>, and <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>.

During the <a href="Second%20Macedonian%20War">Second Macedonian War</a> (200–196 BC), Macedon had given Sparta control over <a href="Argos">Argos</a>, an important city on the Aegean coast of <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>. Sparta's continued occupation of Argos at the end of war was used as a pretext for Rome and its allies to declare war. The anti-Spartan coalition laid siege to Argos, captured the Spartan naval base at <a href="Gythium">Gythium</a>, and soon <a href="investment%20%28military%29">invested</a> and besieged Sparta itself. Eventually, negotiations led to peace on Rome's terms, under which Argos and the coastal towns of Laconia were separated from Sparta and the Spartans were compelled to pay a war indemnity to Rome over the next eight years. Argos joined the Achaean League, and the Laconian towns were placed under Achaean protection.

As a result of the war, Sparta lost its position as a major power in Greece. Subsequent Spartan attempts to recover the losses failed and <a href="Nabis">Nabis</a>, the last sovereign ruler, was eventually murdered. Soon after, Sparta was forcibly made a member of its former rival, the Achaean League, ending several centuries of fierce political independence.

After the death of the Spartan regent <a href="Machanidas">Machanidas</a> in 207 BC in battle against the Achaean League, <a href="Nabis">Nabis</a> overthrew the reigning king <a href="Pelops%20%28Sparta%29">Pelops</a> 
with the backing of a <a href="mercenary">mercenary</a> army and placed himself on the throne, claiming descent from the <a href="Eurypontid">Eurypontid</a> king <a href="Demaratus">Demaratus</a>. By then, the traditional constitution of <a href="Lycurgus%20%28Sparta%29">Lycurgus</a> had already lost its meaning and Sparta was dominated by a group of its former mercenaries. <a href="Polybius">Polybius</a> described Nabis' force as ""a crowd of murderers, burglars, cutpurses and highwaymen"". In 205 BC, Nabis signed a peace treaty with Rome, but in 201 BC he attacked the territory of <a href="Messene">Messene</a>, at that time an ally of both parties, which Sparta had ruled until the mid 4th century BC. The Spartans captured Messene but were soon forced to abandon it when the army of <a href="Megalopolis%2C%20Greece">Megalopolis</a> arrived under the command of <a href="Philopoemen">Philopoemen</a>. Later, they were decisively defeated at <a href="Battle%20of%20Tegea">Tegea</a> and Nabis was forced to check his expansionist ambitions for the time.

During the <a href="Second%20Macedonian%20War">Second Macedonian War</a>, Nabis had another possibility for expansion. <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Macedon">Philip of Macedon</a> offered him the <a href="polis">polis</a> of <a href="Argos">Argos</a> in exchange for Sparta defecting from the Roman coalition and joining the Macedonian alliance. Nabis accepted and received control over Argos. When the war turned against Macedon, however, he rejoined the Roman coalition and sent 600 Cretan mercenaries to support the Roman army. Philip was later decisively defeated by the Romans at the <a href="battle%20of%20Cynoscephalae">battle of Cynoscephalae</a>, but Sparta remained in control of Argos. After the war, the Roman army did not withdraw from Greece, but instead sent garrisons to various strategic locations across Greece to secure its interests.

In return for his assistance in the war, Rome accepted Nabis' possession of the "<a href="polis">polis</a>" of Argos. While Nabis was already King of Sparta, he made his wife <a href="Apia%20%28queen%20of%20Argos%20and%20Sparta%29">Apia</a> ruler of her hometown Argos. Afterwards, Apia and Nabis staged a financial coup by confiscating large amounts of property from the wealthy families of these cities, and torturing those who resisted them; much of the confiscated land was redistributed to liberated <a href="helot">helot</a>s loyal to Nabis. After increasing his territory and wealth by the aforementioned method, Nabis started to turn the port of <a href="Gytheio">Gythium</a> into a major naval arsenal and fortified the city of Sparta. His Cretan allies were already allowed to have naval bases on Spartan territory, and from these they ventured on acts of piracy. His naval buildup offered a chance even for the very poor to participate, as rowers, in the profitable employment. However, the extension of the naval capacities at Gythium greatly displeased the abutting states of the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> and the Roman Republic.

Nabis' rule was largely based on his social reforms and the rebuilding of Sparta's armed forces. The military of <a href="Sparta">Lacedaemonia</a>, Sparta, had traditionally been based on levies of full citizens and <a href="perioeci">perioeci</a> (one of the free non-citizen groups of Lacedaemonia) supported by lightly armed helots. From several thousands in the times of the <a href="Greco-Persian%20Wars">Greco-Persian Wars</a>, the numbers of full citizen Spartans had declined to a few hundred in the times of <a href="Cleomenes%20III">Cleomenes III</a>. There were possibly several reasons for the decline of numbers, one of which was that every Spartan who wasn't able to pay his share in the "<a href="syssitia">syssitia</a>" (common meal for men in Doric societies) lost his full citizenship, although this didn't exclude his offspring from partaking in the "<a href="agoge">agoge</a>" (traditional Spartan education and training regime).

As a result, the fielding of a respectable hoplite army without mercenaries or freed helots was difficult. Cleomenes increased the number of full citizens again and made the Spartan army operate with an increased reliance on more lightly armored phalangites of the Macedonian style. However, many of these restored citizens were killed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sellasia">Battle of Sellasia</a> and Nabis' politics drove the remainder of them into exile. In consequence, the heavy troops were no longer available in sufficient numbers. This led to a serious decline in Sparta's military power, and the aim of Nabis reforms was to reestablish a class of loyal subjects capable of serving as well-equipped <a href="phalangites">phalangites</a> (operating in a close and deep formation, with a longer spear than the hoplites'). Nabis' liberation of the enslaved helots was one of the most outstanding deeds in Spartan history. With this action, Nabis eliminated a central ideological pillar of the old Spartan social system and the chief reason for objection to Spartan expansion by the surrounding "<a href="poleis">poleis</a>" (city-states). Guarding against helot revolt had been, until this time, the central concern of Spartan foreign policy, and the need to protect against internal revolt had limited adventurism abroad; Nabis' action abolished this concern with a single stroke. His freed helots received land from him and were wedded to wealthy wives of the exiled Spartan <a href="Glossary%20of%20rhetorical%20terms%23Demos">demos</a> (all former full citizens) and widows of the rich elite, whose husbands had been killed at his orders.

The Achaean League was upset that one of its members had remained under Spartan occupation and persuaded the Romans to revisit their decision to leave Sparta's territorial gains intact. The Romans agreed with the Achaeans, as they did not want a strong and re-organized Sparta causing trouble after the Romans left Greece.

In 195 BC, Titus Quinctius Flamininus, the Roman commander in Greece, called a council of the Greek states at <a href="Corinth">Corinth</a> to discuss whether or not to declare war on Nabis. Among the states whose delegates participated were the <a href="Aetolian%20League">Aetolian League</a>, <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>, <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="Pergamum">Pergamum</a>, <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>, <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> and the <a href="Achaean%20League">Achaean League</a>. All the states represented favored war, except for the Aetolian League and Thessaly, both of which wanted the Romans to leave Greece immediately. These two states offered to deal with Nabis themselves, but they met opposition from the Achaean League, which objected to any possible growth in the Aetolian League's power. The modern historian Erich Gruen has suggested that the Romans may have used the war as an excuse to station a few legions in Greece in order to prevent the Spartans and the <a href="Aetolian%20League">Aetolian League</a> from joining the <a href="Seleucid">Seleucid</a> King <a href="Antiochus%20III">Antiochus III</a> if he invaded Greece.

Flamininus first sent an envoy to Sparta, demanding that Nabis either surrender Argos to the Achaean League or face war with Rome and her Greek allies. Nabis refused to comply with Flamininus' ultimatum, so 40,000 Roman soldiers and their Greek allies advanced towards the Peloponnese. Entering the Peloponnese, Flamininus joined his force with that of the Achaean commander, Aristaenos, who had 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry in Cleonae. Together, they advanced towards Argos.

Nabis had appointed his brother-in-law, the <a href="Argive">Argive</a> Pythagoras, as commander of his garrison of 15,000 men in Argos. As the Romans and the Achaean League were advancing towards the city, a young Argive named Damocles attempted to stir up a revolution against the Spartan garrison. With a few followers, he stood in the city's <a href="agora">agora</a> and shouted to his fellow Argives, exhorting them to rise in revolt. However, no mass uprising materialized and Damocles and most of his followers were surrounded and killed by the Spartan garrison.

A few survivors from Damocles' group escaped from the city and went to Flamininus' camp. They suggested to Flamininus that, if he moved his camp closer to the city gates, the Argives would revolt against the Spartans.

The Roman commander sent his light infantry and cavalry to find a position for the new camp. Upon spotting the small group of Roman soldiers, a group of Spartan troops sallied forth from the gates and skirmished with the Romans about 300 paces from the city walls. The Romans forced the Spartans to retreat back into the city.

Flamininus moved his camp to the position where the skirmish had occurred. For a day he waited for the Spartans to attack him but, when no attack came, he called a war council to discuss whether or not to press the siege. All the Greek leaders except Aristaenos thought that they should attack the city, as capturing it was their primary objective in going to war. Aristaenos, on the other hand, argued that they should instead strike directly at Sparta and Laconia. Flamininus agreed with Aristaenos and the army marched to Tegea in <a href="Arcadia">Arcadia</a>. The next day, Flamininus advanced to Caryae, where he waited for allied auxiliaries to reinforce him. These forces soon arrived and joined the Romans; they consisted of a contingent of Spartan exiles led by Agesipolis, the legitimate King of Sparta, who had been overthrown by the first Tyrant of Sparta, Lycurgus, twenty years earlier, and 1,500 <a href="Ancient%20Macedonians">Macedonians</a> with 400 <a href="Thessalian">Thessalian</a> cavalry sent by Philip. News also reached the allies that several fleets had arrived off the Laconian shore: a Roman fleet under <a href="Lucius%20Quinctius%20Flamininus">Lucius Quinctius</a> with forty ships; a Rhodian fleet with eighteen ships, led by Sosilas, hoping that the defeat of Nabis would stop the pirates that plagued their ships; and a <a href="Pergamum">Pergamene</a> fleet of forty ships under <a href="King%20Eumenes%20II%20of%20Pergamum">King Eumenes II of Pergamum</a>, who hoped to gain more favor with Rome and Roman support if Antiochus invaded.

Nabis drafted 10,000 citizens into his army and hired 3,000 additional mercenaries. Nabis' <a href="Cretan">Cretan</a> <a href="allies">allies</a>, who profited from the naval bases on his territory, dispatched 1,000 specially selected warriors to augment the 1,000 they had already sent to Sparta's aid. Nabis, fearing that the Roman approach might encourage his subjects to revolt, decided to terrorize them by ordering the execution of eighty prominent citizens. Flamininus left his base and descended upon <a href="Sellasia">Sellasia</a>; while the Romans were making camp, Nabis' auxiliaries attacked them. The sudden surprise attack briefly threw the allies into a state of confusion, but the Spartans retreated back to the city when the main body of legionary <a href="Cohort%20%28military%20unit%29">cohorts</a> arrived. As the Romans marched past Sparta on their way to <a href="Mount%20Menelaus">Mount Menelaus</a>, Nabis' <a href="mercenaries">mercenaries</a> attacked the allies' rear. Appius Claudius, commander of the rearguard, rallied his troops and forced the mercenaries to retreat behind the city's walls, inflicting heavy casualties on them in the process.

The coalition army then proceeded to <a href="Amyclae">Amyclae</a>, from whence they plundered the surrounding countryside. Lucius Quinctius, meanwhile, received the voluntary surrender of several coastal towns in Laconia. The allies then advanced on the largest city in the area, Sparta's port and naval arsenal at <a href="Gythium">Gythium</a>. As the land forces began to invest the city, the allied navy arrived. The sailors from the three fleets set to construct <a href="siege%20engines">siege engines</a> within a few days. Though these machines had a devastating effect on the city walls, the garrison successfully held out.

Eventually, Dexagoridas, one of the two garrison commanders, sent word to the Roman <a href="legatus">legate</a> that he was willing to surrender the city. This plan fell through when Gorgopas, the other commander, learned of it and slew Dexagoridas with his own hands. Gorgopas continued to resist fiercely until Flamininus arrived with 4,000 additional troops that he had recently recruited. The Romans renewed their assault and Gorgopas was forced to surrender, though he did secure the condition that he and his garrison could leave unharmed and return to Sparta.

During the siege at Gythium, Pythagoras had joined Nabis at Sparta, bringing with him 3,000 men from Argos. When Nabis discovered that Gythium had surrendered he decided to send an envoy to Flamininus to open negotiations on the terms of a peace. Nabis offered to withdraw the rest of his garrison from Argos and to hand over to the Romans any <a href="deserters">deserters</a> and <a href="prison">prison</a>ers. Flamininus called another war council. Most of the council felt that they should capture Sparta and unseat Nabis.

Flamininus replied to Nabis by proposing his own terms, under which Sparta and Rome would conclude a six-month truce if Nabis would surrender Argos with all his garrisons from the <a href="Argolid">Argolid</a>; give the coastal Laconian cities autonomy and give them his fleet; pay a war indemnity over the next eight years and not enter into alliances with any Cretan cities. Nabis rejected this offer, claiming that he had enough supplies to withstand a siege. Flamininus therefore led his force of 50,000 men to Sparta and, after defeating the Spartans in a battle outside the city, began investing the city. Flamininus resolved not to lay a regular siege to the city but to instead try and storm it. The Spartans initially held out against the allies, but their resistance was hampered by the fact that the Romans' large <a href="scutum%20%28shield%29">shields</a> made missile attacks futile.

The Romans launched an assault on Sparta and took the walls, but their advance was initially impeded by the narrowness of the roads in the city's outskirts. However, the streets grew wider as they advanced into the city's center, and the Spartans were forced further and further back. Nabis, seeing his defenses collapsing, tried to flee, but Pythagoras rallied the soldiers and ordered them to set fire to the buildings closest to the walls. Burning debris was thrown on the coalition's soldiers entering the city, causing many casualties. Observing this, Flamininus ordered his forces to withdraw to their base. When the attack was renewed later, the Spartans managed to hold off the Roman assaults for three days before Nabis, seeing that the situation was hopeless, decided to send Pythagoras with an offer of surrender. At first, Flaminius refused to see him, but when Pythagoras came to the Roman camp a second time Flamininus accepted the surrender, with the conditions of the treaty being the same as Flamininus had previously proposed. The treaty was later ratified by the Senate.

The Argives revolted when they heard that Sparta was under siege. Under the Argive Archippas, they attacked the garrison commanded by Timocrates of Pellene. Timocrates surrendered the <a href="citadel">citadel</a> on condition that he and his men could leave unharmed. In return all the Argives serving in Nabis' army were allowed to return home.

After the war Flamininus visited the <a href="Nemean%20Games">Nemean Games</a> in Argos and proclaimed the polis free. The Argives immediately decided to rejoin the Achaean League.
Flamininus also separated all coastal cities of Laconia from Spartan rule and placed them under Achean protection. The remains of Sparta's fleet were put under custody of these coastal cities. Nabis also had to withdraw his garrisons from Cretan cities and revoke several social and economic reforms that had strengthened Sparta's military capabilities.
The Romans did not, however, remove Nabis from the Spartan throne. Even though Sparta was a landlocked and effectively powerless state, the Romans wanted an independent Sparta to act as a counterweight against the growing Achaean League. Nabis' allegiance was secured by the fact that he had to surrender five hostages, amongst them his son, <a href="Armenas">Armenas</a>. The Romans did not restore the exiles, wishing to avoid internal strife in Sparta. They did, however, allow any woman who was married to an ex-helot but whose husband was in exile to join him.

After the legions under Flamininus had returned to <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, the Greek states were once again on their own. The dominant powers in the region at this time were the kingdom of <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>, which had recently lost a war against Rome, the <a href="Aetolian">Aetolian</a>s, the strengthened Achaean League and a reduced Sparta. The Aetolians, who had opposed the Roman intervention in Greek affairs, incited Nabis to retake his former territories and position among the Greek powers. By 192, Nabis who had built a new fleet and strengthened his army, besieged Gythium. The Achaeans responded by sending an envoy to Rome with a request for help. In response the Senate sent the <a href="praetor">praetor</a> <a href="Aulus%20Atilius%20Serranus">Atilius</a> with a navy to defeat Nabis' navy as well as an embassy headed by Flamininus. Instead of waiting for the Roman fleet to arrive, the Achaean army and navy headed towards Gythium under the command of Philopoemen. The Achaean fleet was defeated by the recently constructed Spartan fleet, with the Achean flagship falling to pieces in the first ramming attack. On land as well the Achaeans could not defeat the Spartan forces outside Gythium and Philopoemen retreated to Tegea. When Philopoemen reentered Laconia for a second attempt his forces were ambushed by Nabis' but nevertheless he managed to gain a victory. The Achaeans now could ravage Laconia for thirty days unopposed while the Spartan troops remained in their fortified city. Plans for capturing Sparta itself had been laid by the time the Roman envoy Flamininus arrived and convinced the Achaean <a href="strategus">strategus</a> Philopoemen to spare it. For the time being Nabis decided to accept the <a href="status%20quo">status quo</a> in return and surrender under the same conditions as the last treaty.

Since Sparta's army was now weakened, Nabis appealed to the Aetolians for help. They sent to Sparta 1,000 cavalry under the command of <a href="Alexamenus%20of%20Aetolia">Alexamenus</a>. The story goes that while Nabis was observing his army's drills, the Aetolian commander Alexamenus charged at him and killed him with his lance. Afterwards the Aetolian troops seized the palace and set about looting the city but its Sparta were able to rally and drive them from Sparta. As Sparta was in turmoil Philopoemen entered the city with the Achaean army and made Sparta a member state of the League. The polis of Sparta was allowed to keep its laws and territory, but the exiles, and their <a href="Sparta%23State%20organization">rule of the Spartan warrior demos</a> were not restored.

In 189 BC, the hostages taken by Rome, excluding Nabis' son, who fell ill and died, were allowed to return to Sparta. Still deprived of any port and suffering from political and economic problems from having the hostile exiles close by and not having access to the sea, the Spartans captured the city of <a href="Passavas">Las</a>, which was the home of many exiles and a member of the Union of free Laconians. The Acheans officially adopted this as the reason to finish Spartan independence once and for all. They demanded the surrender of the people responsible for the attack. The culprits responded by murdering thirty pro-Achaean citizens, seceding from the League and requesting Roman tutelage. The Romans, who wanted to see division in the League, did nothing about the situation. In 188, Philopoemen entered northern Laconia with an army and the Spartan exiles who insisted on returning to Sparta. He first massacred eighty anti-Achaeans at Compasium, and then had the wall that Nabis built around Sparta demolished. Philopoemen then restored the exiles and abolished Spartan law, introducing Achaean law in its place. Thus ended Sparta's role as a major power in Greece, while Achaea became dominant throughout the Peloponnese.

Lactarius torminosus

Lactarius torminosus, commonly known as the woolly milkcap or the bearded milkcap, is a large <a href="agaric">agaric</a> <a href="fungus">fungus</a>. A common and widely distributed species, it is found in North Africa, northern Asia, Europe, and North America. It was first described scientifically by <a href="Jacob%20Christian%20Sch%C3%A4ffer">Jacob Christian Schäffer</a> in 1774 as an "<a href="Agaricus">Agaricus</a>", and later transferred to the genus "<a href="Lactarius">Lactarius</a>" in 1821 by <a href="Samuel%20Frederick%20Gray">Samuel Frederick Gray</a>. A <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a>, "L. torminosus" var. "nordmanensis", is known from the United States, Canada, and Switzerland. "L. torminosus" officially became the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of "Lactarius" in 2011 after <a href="molecular%20phylogenetic">molecular</a> studies prompted the <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> reshuffling of species between several <a href="Russulaceae">Russulaceae</a> genera.

A <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l species, "L. torminosus" associates with various trees, most commonly <a href="birch">birch</a>, and its <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> (<a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s) grow on the ground singly or in groups in <a href="mixed%20forest">mixed forest</a>s. The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> of "L. torminosus" mushrooms are convex with a central depression, and attain a diameter of up to . A blend of pink and <a href="ochre">ochre</a> hues, the cap sometimes has concentric zones of alternating lighter and darker shades. The edge of the cap is rolled inward, and shaggy when young. On the underside of the cap are narrow flesh-colored <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> that are crowded closely together. The cylindrical <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> is a pale flesh color with a delicately downy surface and brittle <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a>; it is up to long and thick. When cut or injured, the fruit bodies ooze a bitter white <a href="latex">latex</a> that does not change color upon exposure to air. The variety "nordmanensis", in contrast, has latex that changes from white to yellow. "Lactarius torminosus" can be distinguished from similar species like "<a href="Lactarius%20pubescens">L. pubescens</a>" or "<a href="Lactarius%20villosus">L. villosus</a>" by differences in <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> and coloration, or by microscopic characteristics like <a href="spore">spore</a> shape and size.

Although it is valued for its peppery flavor and eaten after suitable preparation in Russia and Finland, the species is highly irritating to the digestive system when eaten raw. The toxins, also responsible for the strongly bitter or acrid taste, are destroyed by cooking. Studies have identified several chemicals present in the mushrooms, including <a href="ergosterol">ergosterol</a> and <a href="Derivative%20%28chemistry%29">derivatives</a> thereof, and the pungent-tasting <a href="velleral">velleral</a>.

German naturalist <a href="Jacob%20Christian%20Sch%C3%A4ffer">Jacob Christian Schäffer</a> was the first to describe the species, placing it in "Agaricus" in 1774. Seven years later in 1781, <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pierre%20Bulliard">Jean Bulliard</a> described a species he called "Agaricus necator" and illustrated it in the first volume of his "Herbier de la France"; this name and the synonym "Lactarius necator", resulting from <a href="Christian%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christian Hendrik Persoon</a>'s 1800 transfer to "Lactarius", are both considered to refer to "L. torminosus". <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a>, for his part chose to put it in "Lactifluus", while <a href="Paul%20Kummer">Paul Kummer</a> thought "Galorrheus" was the appropriate placement; until the recent resurrection of "Lactifluus", both genera had been long considered to be unnecessary segregates of "Lactarius". According to <a href="Index%20Fungorum">Index Fungorum</a>, another synonym is <a href="Samuel%20Frederick%20Gray">Samuel Frederick Gray</a>'s "Lactarius necans". Gray also gave the species its modern name when he transferred it to "Lactarius" in his 1821 "Natural Arrangement of British Plants".

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "torminosus" means "tormenting" or "causing colic", in reference to the gastrointestinal distress associated with consuming the raw mushroom. Early English <a href="common%20name">vernacular</a> names were Gray's "bellyach milk-stool" (1821), and <a href="James%20Edward%20Smith">James Edward Smith</a>'s "bearded pepper agaric" (1824). More recent common names include "shaggy milkcap", "powderpuff milkcap", "pink-fringed milkcap", "bearded milkcap", and the <a href="British%20Mycological%20Society">British Mycological Society</a>-recommended "woolly milkcap".

According to <a href="Lexemuel%20Ray%20Hesler">Hesler</a> and <a href="Alexander%20H.%20Smith">Smith</a>'s 1979 <a href="biological%20classification">classification</a> of the genus "<a href="Lactarius">Lactarius</a>", "L. torminosus" belongs to <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "Piperites", <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> "Piperites" (in which it is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a>), subsection "Piperites". Species in this subsection are characterized by having latex that does not turn yellow after exposure to air, and/or that does not stain the cut surface of the mushroom surface yellow. A 2004 <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> analysis of European "Lactarius" species concluded that "L. torminosus" falls into a <a href="clade">group</a> that includes "<a href="lactarius%20torminosulus">L. torminosulus</a>", and that these two species are <a href="sister%20group">closely related</a> to a group that includes "<a href="Lactarius%20tesquorum">L. tesquorum</a>", "<a href="Lactarius%20scoticus">L. scoticus</a>", and "<a href="Lactarius%20pubescens">L. pubescens</a>".

A multi-gene <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> analysis published in 2008 demonstrated that species then distributed in the genera "Lactarius" and "<a href="Russula">Russula</a>" actually consisted of four distinct <a href="lineage%20%28evolution%29">lineages</a>. The subsequent reorganization of <a href="Russulaceae">Russulaceae</a> species—a <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> change needed to make "Russula" and "Lactarius" <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a>—required that a new type species be defined for "Lactarius", since the previous type, "<a href="Lactarius%20piperatus">L. piperatus</a>", belonged to the clade that will be transferred to genus "<a href="Lactifluus">Lactifluus</a>". A proposal to <a href="conserved%20name">conserve</a> "Lactarius" with "L. torminosus" as the type was accepted by the Nomenclatural Committee for Fungi and passed at the 2011 <a href="International%20Botanical%20Congress">International Botanical Congress</a>. The change minimizes "taxonomic disruption", allowing most of the common and well-known "Lactarius" species to retain their names.

The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is initially convex, but as it matures the center forms a depression and the outer edges rise until it assumes the shape of a shallow funnel; its final width is typically between . The cap margin is strongly curled inward; when young, it is <a href="Trichome%23Plant%20trichomes">tomentose</a> (covered with a thick matting of hairs), forming a <a href="veil%20%28botany%29">veil</a>-like structure that partly covers up the gills. This tomentum diminishes with age. The cap surface is at first similarly tomentose, but eventually the hairs wear off, leaving the surface more or less smooth. The surface starts off somewhat sticky with clear concentric rings of darker shade (a "<a href="zonate">zonate</a>" pattern); these rings, especially the outer ones, usually fade in maturity. The cap color is pinkish-orange to pale dull pink, becoming orange to whitish toward the margin as the pink gradually fades. The white to flesh-colored <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is firm and brittle, but becomes flaccid in age. The <a href="latex">latex</a> that is produced when the mushroom tissue is cut or injured is white to cream, and does not change color with prolonged exposure to air, nor does it stain the gills. It has an acrid taste, with a slight to pungent odor.

The <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are <a href="decurrent">subdecurrent</a> (running only a small way down the length of the stem), close to crowded together, narrow, and sometimes forked near the stem. Their color is whitish, becoming pink-tinged, turning pale tan with age. The adult <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> is long, thick, fragile, more or less equal in width throughout, and cylindrical or narrowed at the base. Its surface is dry, and either smooth to <a href="Pruinescence">pruinose</a> (covered with a very fine whitish powder on the surface). The color ranges from pale light pink to yellowish-tinged or slightly pinkish orange to orange white, sometimes spotted. The interior of the stem is firm, beige white, and filled with a soft pith, but it eventually becomes hollow. Occasionally, white <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a> is visible at the base of the stem where it meets the ground.

The fruit body <a href="Morphogenesis">formation</a> of "L. torminosus" is pileostipitocarpic. In this type of development, the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a> forms early on the underside of the cap and upper stem of the mushroom <a href="primordium">primordium</a>. As the cap enlarges, the margin, made of flaring filamentous <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e that grow outward and downward, tends to curve inward, eventually forming a flap of tissue roughly parallel to the stem surface. As further development takes place, these hyphae make contact with and adhere to the hymenial surface of the stem, covering <a href="basidia">basidia</a> and macrocystidia (very long <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a>) already present. The junction between the two tissues produces a cavity that provides some temporary protection to the basidia, although they are already fertile when the cap margin starts to grow.

The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> of "L. torminosus" is cream to pale yellow, and the spores 8–10.2 by 5.8–6.6 <a href="micrometre">μm</a>, roughly spherical to broadly elliptical in side view, and <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent). Only the ornamentation on their surface is <a href="amyloid%20%28mycology%29">amyloid</a>; it is partially reticulate (network-like) with interrupted ridges roughly 0.5–0.7 μm high, and a few isolated warts. Spores have a conspicuous <a href="wikt%3Aapiculus">apiculus</a>, demarcating where it was once attached to the basidia via the <a href="sterigma">sterigma</a>. The basidia are four-spored, hyaline and club-shaped to cylindrical, measuring 30–47.7 by 7.3–8.2 μm.

<a href="cystidium">Pleurocystidia</a> are only present in the form of macrocystidia embedded and originating in the hymenium and just below it, they reach 40.3–80.0 by 5.1–9.5 μm. Macrocystidia are abundant in the hymenium. Characterized by their spindle-shaped to <a href="wikt%3Aventricose">ventricose</a> (swollen on one side) form that gradually tapers in width, they have <a href="granule%20%28cell%20biology%29">granular</a> hyaline contents. Gill edge cystidia (cheilocystidia) are smaller: 30–52 by 4.5–8.0 μm. The <a href="cap%20cuticle">cap cuticle</a> is made of gelatinized, interwoven hyphae arranged more or less parallel to the cap surface (a form known as "ixocutis"); the thin-walled, threadlike hyphae of this layer are 2.5–7.3 μm wide.

"Lactarius nordmanensis" was described by Alexander Smith in 1960 to account for a North American species closely resembling "L. torminosus" in appearance, but with a slightly larger range of spore sizes (9–11 by 6.5–8 μm). In contrast to the unchanging latex of "L. torminosus", "L. nordmanensis" has whitish latex that slowly changes to pale yellow upon exposure to air; the latex also stains mushroom tissues and paper yellow. Hesler and Smith reduced "L. nordmanensis" to the status of a <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> under "L. torminosus" in 1979. "Lactarius torminosus" var. "nordmanensis" has been recorded from <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>, <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, and <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> in the United States, <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a> in Canada, and Switzerland. The variety resembles "<a href="Lactarius%20pubescens">Lactarius pubescens</a>" var. "betulae", but differs in its longer pleurocystidia, larger spores with slightly different spore ornamentation, and strongly burning acrid taste. The <a href="holotype">holotype</a> specimen of "L. torminosus" var. "nordmanensis" was collected by Smith in 1956 near <a href="Nordman%2C%20Idaho">Nordman, Idaho</a>.

The woolly cap margin, pinkish tones in the cap, acrid latex, and association with birch are reliable field characteristics to help identify "L. torminosus". However, there are several hairy "Lactarius" species with which it is often confused, and sometimes examination of microscopic characteristics is necessary to distinguish between them. The closely related "<a href="Lactarius%20torminosulus">L. torminosulus</a>" is a dwarf version of "L. torminosus", an <a href="arctic">arctic</a> species associated with the birches "<a href="Betula%20nana">Betula nana</a>" or "<a href="Betula%20glandulosa">B. glandulosa</a>". Immature fruit bodies of "<a href="Lactarius%20scrobiculatus">L. scrobiculatus</a>" resemble "L. torminosus", but they have a white latex that soon turns yellow upon exposure to air, and their stems have shiny depressed spots. The caps of the poorly known species "<a href="Lactarius%20cilicioides">L. cilicioides</a>" are not zonate, and its spores are smaller. "L. pubescens" is physically quite similar, but can be distinguished by its paler color and smaller spores (6.0–7.5 by 5.0–6.5 μm). "<a href="Lactarius%20controversus">L. controversus</a>" has a cap margin that is not as hairy, whitish to cream-colored gills, and larger spores measuring 7.5–10 by 6–7.5 μm. "<a href="Lactarius%20mairei">L. mairei</a>" has a coloration similar to "L. torminosus", but is rarer and typically found associated with oak trees on <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a> soil. Known only from <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> and western Canada, "<a href="Lactarius%20subtorminosus">L. subtorminosus</a>" was named for its similarity to "L. torminosus". It can be distinguished by its mild-tasting latex and smaller, roughly spherical spores measuring 5.5–7 by 5.5–6.5 μm.

The intensely peppery taste of the raw mushroom can blister the tongue if sampled in excess. Some authors have reported the species as outright poisonous, or causing "mild to fatal <a href="gastroenteritis">gastroenteritis</a>". In a 1930 publication, Hans Steidle reported that although the mushroom was not toxic to "unicellular and cold-blooded organisms" when ingested, the liquid extract and the pressed juice of the fruit bodies, when injected under the skin of a frog, resulted in disturbed breathing, <a href="paralysis">paralysis</a>, and eventually death. Symptoms that are typically experienced after consuming raw mushrooms include <a href="nausea">nausea</a>, <a href="vomiting">vomiting</a>, and severe <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a> that starts about one hour after ingestion. This combination can lead to <a href="dehydration">dehydration</a>, <a href="muscle%20spasm">muscle spasm</a>s, and <a href="circulatory%20collapse">circulatory collapse</a>. The gastroenteritis will usually resolve without treatment in a couple of days.

Despite these reports of toxicity, "L. torminosus" mushrooms are prepared in Finland, Russia, and other northern and eastern European countries by <a href="parboiling">parboiling</a>, soaking in brine for several days, or pickling, after which it is valued for its peppery taste. In Norway, it is roasted and added to coffee. Mushrooms are harvested for commercial sale in Finland. The nutrient composition of Finnish specimens has been analyzed and found to contain the following components (as a percentage of <a href="dry%20matter">dry weight</a>): <a href="protein">protein</a>, 17.2%; <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, 0.46%; <a href="calcium">calcium</a>, 0.12%; <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, 0.088%; <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, 2.97%; <a href="sodium">sodium</a> 0.011%.

The compound thought to be responsible for the toxicity of raw "L. torminosus" is the pungent-tasting <a href="velleral">velleral</a> present at a concentration of 0.16 mg/g mushroom. Velleral is a <a href="chemical%20decomposition">breakdown</a> product of <a href="Stearic%20acid">stearyl</a>-velutinal. Broken lactifers—specialized hyphal cells that produce the mushroom's latex—leak the precursor chemicals whose breakdown products act as the defensive agents toxic to humans, effectively deterring certain vertebrates that might consume the mushroom. The lactarane-type <a href="sesquiterpene">sesquiterpene</a> <a href="lactone">lactone</a> 15-hydroxyblennin A is one of several sesquiterpenes produced by the species. Other lactaranes are found in various "Lactarius" species, such as blennin A in "<a href="Lactarius%20deliciosus">L. deliciosus</a>" and "<a href="Lactarius%20blennius">L. blennius</a>", and lactarorufin N in "<a href="Lactarius%20rufus">Lactarius rufus</a>". Fungal sesquiterpenes are commonly produced as toxins to <a href="host%20plant%20resistance">defend against predation</a>, and as a result some have chemical properties that may have applications in <a href="medicinal%20chemistry">medicinal chemistry</a>.

Fruit bodies of "Lactarius torminosus" contain a number of <a href="sterol">sterol</a>s, of which <a href="ergosterol">ergosterol</a> (a component of fungal cell walls) is the most predominant at 60.5% of all sterols, followed by its <a href="Derivative%20%28chemistry%29">derivatives</a> and ergosta-5/7-dien-3-ol (17.0%), ergost-7-en-3-ol (13.7%) and ergosta-7-22-dien-3-ol (8.3%). Researchers have identified 28 <a href="volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatile</a> compounds that contribute to the odor of the mushroom. Many of these are <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a>s and <a href="carbonyl">carbonyl</a> compounds with eight carbon atoms; the predominant volatile compound (about 90%) is <a href="1-octen-3-one">1-octen-3-one</a>, an <a href="aroma%20compound">odorant</a> common in mushrooms.

"Lactarius torminosus" is a <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l species, and as such plays an important role in facilitating nutrient and water uptake by trees. It grows in association with birch ("<a href="Betula">Betula</a>") and hemlock ("<a href="Tsuga">Tsuga</a>") in <a href="mixed%20forest">mixed forest</a>s. It is also known to grow in urban settings when birch trees are nearby. A field study in Scotland concluded that the species is more likely to be present in older than in younger birch woodlands. Fruit bodies grow on the ground, scattered or grouped together. They are a component of the diet of the <a href="red%20squirrel">red squirrel</a>, and serve as breeding sites for some fungus-feeding flies in the <a href="Drosophilidae">Drosophilidae</a> and <a href="Mycetophilidae">Mycetophilidae</a> families. "Lactarius torminosus" mushrooms may be <a href="parasitism">parasitized</a> by the <a href="mold">mold</a> "<a href="Hypomyces%20lithuanicus">Hypomyces lithuanicus</a>", which produces a cream-ochre to cinnamon-colored granular or velvety growth of mycelium on the surfaces of the gills and causes them to be deformed.

The species is found in northern <a href="temperate">temperate</a> and <a href="boreal%20ecosystem">boreal</a> climates, penetrating sometimes into <a href="subarctic">subarctic</a> regions. It has been recorded from North Africa, northern Asia, Europe, and is common in North America, where it sometimes grows with <a href="aspen">aspen</a> ("Populus" species). The North American distribution extends north into the <a href="Yukon">Yukon</a> and <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and south to Mexico.

Battle of Arawe

The Battle of Arawe (also known as Operation "Director") was fought between <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> and <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> forces during the <a href="New%20Britain%20Campaign">New Britain Campaign</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The battle formed part of the Allied <a href="Operation%20Cartwheel">Operation Cartwheel</a>, and had the objective of serving as a diversion before a larger landing at <a href="Cape%20Gloucester">Cape Gloucester</a> in late December 1943. The Japanese military was expecting an Allied offensive in western <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>, and was reinforcing the region at the time of the Allied landing in the <a href="Arawe">Arawe</a> area on 15 December 1943. The Allies secured Arawe after about a month of intermittent fighting with the outnumbered Japanese force.

Initial Allied goals for the landing at Arawe included securing a base for American <a href="PT%20boats">PT boats</a> and diverting Japanese forces away from Cape Gloucester. The PT boat base was subsequently deemed unnecessary and was never built. Only a small Japanese force was stationed at Arawe at the time, although reinforcements were en route. The main Allied landing on 15 December was successful, despite a failed subsidiary landing and problems coordinating the landing craft. American forces quickly secured a <a href="beachhead">beachhead</a> and dug in. Japanese air units made large-scale raids against the Arawe area in the days after the landing, and in late December <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> (IJA) troops unsuccessfully counterattacked the American force. In mid-January 1944 the American force, reinforced with additional <a href="infantry">infantry</a> and <a href="tank">tank</a>s, launched a brief offensive that pushed the Japanese back. The Japanese units at Arawe withdrew from the area towards the end of February as part of a general retreat from western New Britain.

There is no consensus among historians on whether the Allied offensive at Arawe was necessary. While some have argued that the landing served as a useful diversion ahead of the Cape Gloucester operation, others believe that the entire campaign in western New Britain was unnecessary, and that the force employed at Arawe could have been better used elsewhere.

In July 1942, the U.S. <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> directed that the main objective of the Allied forces in the <a href="South%20Pacific%20Area">South Pacific</a> and <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Southwest Pacific</a> area commands was to capture the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> on the eastern tip of <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>. From August 1942, U.S. and Australian forces conducted a series of offensives in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> and the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>, with the goals of eliminating Japanese positions in the region and establishing air bases close to Rabaul. The Japanese forces in the area mounted a strong resistance, but were unable to stop the Allied advance.

In June 1943, the Allies launched a major offensive—designated Operation Cartwheel—to capture Rabaul. During the next five months, Australian and U.S. forces under the overall command of General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> advanced along the north coast of eastern New Guinea, capturing the town of <a href="Lae">Lae</a> and the <a href="Huon%20Peninsula">Huon Peninsula</a>. U.S. forces under the command of Admiral <a href="William%20Halsey%2C%20Jr.">William Halsey, Jr.</a> simultaneously advanced through the Solomon Islands from <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a>, and established an air base at <a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville</a> in November. In June, the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided that it was unnecessary to capture Rabaul as the Japanese base there could be neutralized by <a href="blockade">blockade</a> and aerial bombardment. MacArthur initially opposed this change in plans, but it was endorsed by the British and United States <a href="Combined%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Combined Chiefs of Staff</a> during the <a href="Quebec%20Conference%2C%201943">Quebec Conference</a> in August.
The Japanese <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a> assessed the strategic situation in the Southwest Pacific in late September 1943, and concluded that the Allies would attempt to break through the northern Solomon Islands and <a href="Bismarck%20Archipelago">Bismarck Archipelago</a> in the coming months en route to Japan's inner perimeter in the western and central Pacific. Accordingly, reinforcements were dispatched to strategic locations in the area in an attempt to slow the Allied advance. Strong forces were retained at Rabaul, however, as it was believed that the Allies would attempt to capture the town. At the time, Japanese positions in western New Britain were limited to airfields at <a href="Cape%20Gloucester">Cape Gloucester</a> on the island's western tip and several small <a href="Layover">way stations</a> which provided small boats travelling between Rabaul and New Guinea with shelter from Allied aerial attacks.

On 22 September 1943, MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) directed Lieutenant General <a href="Walter%20Krueger">Walter Krueger</a>'s <a href="Sixth%20United%20States%20Army">Alamo Force</a> to secure western New Britain and the surrounding islands. This operation had two goals, the first of which was to establish air and <a href="PT%20boat">PT boat</a> bases to attack the Japanese forces at Rabaul. The second objective was to secure the <a href="Vitiaz%20Strait">Vitiaz</a> and <a href="Dampier%20Strait%20%28Papua%20New%20Guinea%29">Dampier Straits</a> between New Guinea and New Britain so that convoys could safely pass through them en route to conduct further landings along New Guinea's north coast and beyond. To this end, GHQ directed that both Cape Gloucester and <a href="Gasmata">Gasmata</a> on New Britain's south coast be captured. This offensive was code-named <a href="Operation%20Dexterity">Operation Dexterity</a>. The <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Marine Division</a> was selected for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Gloucester">Cape Gloucester operation</a>, and the heavily reinforced <a href="126th%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">126th Regimental Combat Team</a> from the <a href="32nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">32nd Infantry Division</a> was to attack Gasmata.

Senior Allied commanders disagreed over whether it was necessary to land forces in western New Britain. Lieutenant General <a href="George%20Kenney">George Kenney</a>—commander of the Allied Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific—opposed the landings, arguing that his forces did not need air fields at Cape Gloucester as the existing bases in New Guinea and surrounding islands were adequate to support the planned landings in the region. Vice Admiral <a href="Arthur%20S.%20Carpender">Arthur S. Carpender</a>—commander of both the <a href="United%20States%20Seventh%20Fleet">7th Fleet</a> and the Allied Naval Forces, Southwest Pacific Area—as well as Rear Admiral <a href="Daniel%20E.%20Barbey">Daniel E. Barbey</a>—commander of <a href="Task%20Force%2076">Task Force 76</a> (TF 76)—supported occupying Cape Gloucester to secure both sides of the straits, but opposed the landing at Gasmata as it was too close to the Japanese air bases at Rabaul. The Gasmata operation was cancelled in early November in response to the concerns raised by Kenney and the Navy as well as intelligence reports that the Japanese had reinforced their garrison there.

On 21 November, a conference between GHQ, Kenney, Carpender and Barbey was held in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> at which it was decided to land a small force in the Arawe area. This operation had three goals: to divert Japanese attention from Cape Gloucester, to provide a base for PT boats, and to establish a defensive perimeter and make contact with the Marines once they landed. It was intended that PT boats operating from Arawe would disrupt Japanese <a href="barge">barge</a> traffic along the southern shore of New Britain and protect the Allied naval forces at Cape Gloucester from attack.

The Arawe area lies on the south coast of New Britain about from the island's western tip. Its main geographical feature is Cape Merkus, which ends in the "L"-shaped Arawe Peninsula. Several small islands called the Arawe Islands lie to the southwest of the Cape.

In late 1943, the Arawe Peninsula was covered by coconut trees which formed part of the Amalut Plantation; the terrain inland from the peninsula and on its offshore islands was swampy. Most of the shoreline in the area has limestone cliffs. There was a small unused airfield east of the neck of the Arawe Peninsula, and a coastal trail leading east from Cape Merkus to the Pulie River where it split into tracks running inland and along the coast. The terrain to the west of the peninsula was a trackless region of swamp and jungle, which was very difficult for troops to move through. Several of the beaches in the Arawe area were suitable for landing craft; the best were House Fireman, on the peninsula's west coast, and one near the village of Umtingalu to the east of the peninsula's base.

Alamo Force was responsible for coordinating plans for the invasion of western New Britain. The Arawe landing was scheduled for 15 December as this was the earliest date by which the air bases around <a href="Nadzab">Nadzab</a> in New Guinea, which were needed to support the landing, could be made operational. This date also gave the landing force time to conduct essential training and rehearsals. As Arawe was believed to be only weakly defended, Krueger decided to use a smaller force than the one which had been intended for the landing at Gasmata. This force, designated the Director Task Force, was concentrated at <a href="Goodenough%20Island">Goodenough Island</a> where it was stripped of all equipment not needed for combat operations. Logistical plans called for the assault echelon to carry 30 days worth of general supplies and enough ammunition for three days of intensive combat. After the landing, holdings would be expanded to 60 days worth of general supplies and six days worth of all categories of ammunition other than anti-aircraft ammunition, for which a 10-day supply was thought necessary. The assault force and its supplies were to be carried in fast ships which could rapidly unload their cargo.

The commander of the PT boat force in the Southwest Pacific, Commander <a href="Morton%20C.%20Mumma">Morton C. Mumma</a>, opposed building extensive PT boat facilities at Arawe as he had sufficient bases and Japanese barges normally sailed along the north coast of New Britain. Mumma took his concerns to Carpender and Barbey, who eventually agreed that he would not be required to establish a base there if he thought it unnecessary. Instead, he assigned six boats stationed at <a href="Dreger%20Harbor">Dreger Harbor</a> in New Guinea and <a href="Kiriwina">Kiriwina Island</a> to operate along the south coast of New Britain east of Arawe each night, and asked only for emergency refuelling facilities at Arawe.

The Director Task Force's commander—Brigadier General <a href="Julian%20W.%20Cunningham">Julian W. Cunningham</a>—issued orders for the landing on 4 December. He directed that the Task Force would initially capture the Arawe Peninsula and its surrounding islands and establish an <a href="Outpost%20%28military%29">outpost</a> on the trail leading to the Pulie River. The main body of the Director Task Force was to land at House Fireman Beach on the Arawe Peninsula at about dawn. Two <a href="troop">troop</a>-sized forces would conduct separate operations about an hour before the main landing. One troop was to capture Pitoe Island to the peninsula's south, as it was believed that the Japanese had established a radio station and a defensive position there which commanded the entrance to Arawe Harbor. The other troop was to land at Umtingalu and establish a blocking position on the coastal trail east of the peninsula. Once the beachhead was secure, amphibious patrols would be conducted to the west of the peninsula in an attempt to make contact with the Marines at Cape Gloucester. U.S. Navy personnel on the planning staff were concerned about these subsidiary landings, as a night-time landing <a href="Landing%20at%20Lae">conducted at Lae</a> in September had proven difficult.

The Director Task Force was centered around the U.S. Army's <a href="112th%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">112th Cavalry Regimental Combat Team</a> (112th RCT). This <a href="regiment">regiment</a> had arrived in the Pacific in August 1942 but had not seen combat. It was dismounted and converted to an infantry unit in May 1943, and undertook an unopposed landing at <a href="Woodlark%20Island">Woodlark Island</a> (designated <a href="Operation%20Chronicle">Operation Chronicle</a>) on 23 June. The 112th Cavalry Regiment was smaller and more lightly armed than U.S. infantry regiments as it had only two <a href="battalion">battalion</a>-sized <a href="Squadron%20%28army%29">squadron</a>s compared to the three battalions in infantry regiments. Moreover, the squadrons were smaller and more lightly equipped than their infantry equivalents. The 112th RCT's combat support units were the <a href="M101%20howitzer">M2A1 howitzer</a>-equipped 148th Field Artillery Battalion and the 59th Engineer Company. The other combat units of the Director Task Force were two batteries of the 470th Anti-aircraft Artillery Battalion (Automatic Weapons), most of the 236th Anti-aircraft Artillery Battalion (Searchlight), "A" Company of the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> (USMC) <a href="Combat%20Assault%20Battalion">1st Amphibious Tractor Battalion</a> and a detachment from the 26th Quartermaster War Dog Platoon. The 2nd Battalion of the <a href="158th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">158th Infantry Regiment</a> was held in reserve to reinforce the Director Task Force if required. Several engineer, medical, ordnance and other support units were scheduled to arrive at Arawe after the landing was completed. Cunningham requested a battery equipped with <a href="90%20mm%20Gun%20M1/M2/M3"></a> anti-aircraft guns, but none were available. The U.S. Navy's Beach Party Number 1 would also be landed with the Director Task Force and remain at Arawe until the beachhead was secured.
The Director Task Force was supported by Allied naval and air units. The naval force was drawn from TF 76 and comprised U.S. Navy <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s (Barbey's flagship), , , , , , , and and a transport group with destroyer transports and , the Australian <a href="Landing%20ship%2C%20infantry">landing ship infantry</a> , <a href="Dock%20landing%20ship">landing ship dock</a> , two patrol craft and two submarine chasers. The naval force also included a service group with three <a href="Landing%20Ship%2C%20Tank">LSTs</a>, three <a href="tugboat">tugboat</a>s and the <a href="destroyer%20tender">destroyer tender</a> . <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF) and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) units operating under the <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a> would support the landing, but only limited air support was to be available after 15 December as the available aircraft were needed for strategic missions against Japanese bases.

Australian <a href="coastwatchers">coastwatchers</a> stationed on New Britain were reinforced during September and October 1943 to provide warning of air attacks from Rabaul bound for the Allied landing sites and to report on Japanese barge and troop movements. In addition to a coastwatching team already in place at Cape Orford near <a href="Wide%20Bay%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Wide Bay</a>, five other parties were sent to <a href="Cape%20Hoskins">Cape Hoskins</a>, Gasmata, Open Bay (on the north coast at the base of the <a href="Gazelle%20Peninsula">Gazelle Peninsula</a>), the area south of Wide Bay, and the neck between Wide Bay and Open Bay. The Gasmata party was discovered by the Japanese while en route to its destination and eliminated, but the other teams were in place by the end of October.

At the time of the Allied landing, the Arawe area was defended by only a small force, though reinforcements were en route. The Japanese force at Arawe comprised 120 soldiers and sailors organized in two temporary <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">companies</a> drawn from the <a href="51st%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">51st Division</a>. The reinforcing units were elements of the <a href="17th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">17th Division</a>, which had been shipped from China to Rabaul during October 1943 to reinforce western New Britain ahead of the expected Allied invasion. The <a href="convoy">convoy</a>s carrying the division were attacked by U.S. Navy submarines and USAAF bombers and suffered 1,173 casualties. The 1st Battalion, 81st Infantry Regiment was assigned to defend Cape Merkus. However, it did not depart Rabaul until December as it needed to be reorganized after suffering casualties when the ship transporting it from China was sunk. In addition, two of its rifle companies, most of its heavy machine guns and all its howitzers were retained by the 8th Area Army at Rabaul, leaving the battalion with just its headquarters, two rifle companies and a machine gun <a href="platoon">platoon</a>. This battalion—which came under the command of Major Masamitsu Komori—was a four-day march from Arawe when the Allies landed. A company of soldiers from the 54th Infantry Regiment, some engineers and detachments from other units were also assigned to the Arawe area. The ground forces at Arawe came under the overall command of General Matsuda, whose headquarters were located near Cape Gloucester. The Japanese air units at Rabaul had been greatly weakened in the months prior to the landing at Arawe by prolonged Allied attacks and the transfer of the <a href="7th%20Air%20Division%20%28Japan%29">7th Air Division</a> to western New Guinea. Nevertheless, the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>'s (IJN) <a href="11th%20Air%20Fleet">11th Air Fleet</a> had 100 fighters and 50 bombers based at Rabaul at the time of the landing at Arawe.

The Allies possessed little intelligence on western New Britain's terrain and the exact location of Japanese forces, so they flew extensive <a href="Aerial%20photography">air photography</a> sorties over the region, and small ground patrols were landed from PT boats. A team from <a href="Special%20Service%20Unit%20No.%201">Special Service Unit No. 1</a> reconnoitered Arawe on the night of 9/10 December and concluded that there were few Japanese troops in the area. The Japanese detected this party near the village of Umtingalu and strengthened their defenses there.

Operation Dexterity was preceded by a major Allied air offensive which sought to neutralize the Japanese air units stationed at Rabaul. From 12 October until early November, the Fifth Air Force frequently <a href="Bombing%20of%20Rabaul%20%28November%201943%29">attacked the airfields</a> around the town as well as ships in its harbor. Aircraft flying from U.S. Navy aircraft carriers also attacked Rabaul on 5 and 11 November in support of the USMC's <a href="Bougainville%20Campaign">landing at Bougainville</a>.

The Allied air forces began pre-invasion raids on western New Britain on 13 November. Few attacks were made on the Arawe area, however, as the Allies hoped to achieve tactical surprise for the landing and did not want to alert the Japanese to their intentions. Instead, heavy attacks were made against Gasmata, Ring Ring Plantation and Lindenhafen Plantation on New Britain's south coast. The Arawe area was struck for the first time on 6 December and again on 8 December; little opposition was encountered on either occasion. It was not until 14 December—the day before the landing—that heavy air attacks on Arawe were conducted; Allied aircraft flew 273 sorties against targets on New Britain's south coast that day. In addition to these air raids, a force comprising two Australian and two American destroyers (designated Task Force 74.2) bombarded the Gasmata area during the night of 29/30 November.

The Director Task Force was concentrated at Goodenough Island in early December 1943. The 112th Cavalry was notified that it had been selected for the Arawe operation on 24 November, and departed Woodlark for the short voyage to Goodenough Island in two convoys that sailed on 30 and 31 November. All elements of the regiment were ashore at Goodenough by 2 December. A full-scale rehearsal of the landing was held at the island on 8 December; this revealed problems with coordinating the waves of boats and demonstrated that some of the force's officers were insufficiently trained in <a href="amphibious%20warfare">amphibious warfare</a>. There was insufficient time for further training to rectify these problems, however. At Goodenough, the troopers of the 112th Cavalry were issued with several types of infantry weapons with which they had not previously been equipped. Each of the regiment's rifle <a href="squad">squad</a>s received a <a href="M1918%20Browning%20Automatic%20Rifle">Browning Automatic rifle</a> and a <a href="Thompson%20submachine%20gun">Thompson submachine gun</a>, and a number of <a href="bazooka">bazooka</a>s, <a href="rifle%20grenade">rifle grenade</a>s and <a href="flame%20thrower">flame thrower</a>s were also issued. The cavalrymen received little training on the use of these weapons however, and did not know how to make the best use of them in combat.

The invasion force boarded transport ships during the afternoon of 13 December, and the convoy sailed at midnight. It proceeded to <a href="Buna%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Buna</a> in New Guinea to rendezvous with most of the escorting destroyers and made a feint north toward <a href="Finschhafen">Finschhafen</a> before turning toward Arawe after dusk on 14 December. The convoy was detected by a Japanese aircraft shortly before it anchored off Arawe at 3:30 am on 15 December, and the 11th Air Fleet at Rabaul began to prepare aircraft to attack it.

Shortly after the assault convoy arrived off Arawe, "Carter Hall" launched <a href="Landing%20Vehicle%20Tracked">LVT</a> amphibious tractors and "Westralia" lowered landing craft, both operated by specialized Marine and U.S. Army units. The two large transports departed for New Guinea at 5:00 am. The <a href="high%20speed%20transport">high speed transport</a>s carrying "A" and "B" Troops of the 112th Cavalry Regiment's 1st Squadron closed to within of Umtingalu and Pilelo Island respectively, and unloaded the soldiers into rubber boats.

"A" Troop's attempt to land at Umtingalu ended in failure. At about 5:25 am, the troop came under fire from machine guns, rifles and a cannon as it was nearing the shore, and all but three of its 15 rubber boats were sunk. "Shaw"—the destroyer assigned to support the landing—was unable to fire upon the Japanese positions until 5:42 am as her crew initially could not determine if the soldiers in the water were in the ship's line of fire. Once she had a clear shot, "Shaw" silenced the Japanese force with two salvos from her guns. The surviving cavalrymen were rescued by small boats and later landed at House Fireman beach; casualties in this operation were 12 killed, four missing and 17 wounded.

The landing conducted by "B" Troop at Pilelo Island was successful. The goal of this operation was to destroy a Japanese radio station believed to be at the village of Paligmete on the island's east coast. The troop was originally intended to come ashore near Paligmete, but the landing site was switched to the island's west coast after "A" Troop came under attack. After disembarking from their boats, the cavalrymen advanced east and came under fire from a small Japanese force stationed in two caves near the village of Winguru on the island's north coast. Ten cavalrymen were detached to contain the Japanese while the remainder of the troop continued to Paligmete. The village proved to be unoccupied, and did not contain the suspected radio station. The majority of "B" Troop then attacked Winguru, using bazookas and flamethrowers to destroy the Japanese positions. One American and seven Japanese soldiers were killed in the fighting. Personnel from the RAAF's <a href="No.%20335%20Radar%20Station%20RAAF">No. 335 Radar Station</a> also landed on Pilelo Island on 15 December, and established a <a href="radar">radar</a> station there in 48 hours.

The 2nd Squadron, 112th Cavalry Regiment made the main landing at House Fireman Beach. The landing was delayed by a strong current and difficulties forming the LVTs into an assault formation, and the first wave went ashore at 7:28 am rather than 6:30 am as planned. Destroyers bombarded the beach with 1,800 rounds of 5 inch ammunition between 6:10 and 6:25 am, and <a href="North%20American%20B-25%20Mitchell">B-25 Mitchell</a>s strafed the area once the bombardment concluded, but the landing area was not under fire as the troops approached the beach. This allowed Japanese machine gunners to fire on the LVTs, but these guns were rapidly silenced by rockets fired from and two <a href="DUKW">DUKW</a>s. The first wave of cavalrymen were fortunate to meet little opposition as there were further delays in landing the follow-up waves owing to differences in the speeds of the two types of LVTs used. While the four follow-up waves were scheduled to land at five-minute intervals after the first wave, the second landed 25 minutes after the initial force and the succeeding three waves landed simultaneously 15 minutes later. Within two hours of the landing, all the large Allied ships other than Barbey's flagship had departed from Arawe. "Conyngham" remained in the area to rescue the survivors of the landing at Umtingalu, and withdrew later that day.

Once ashore, the cavalrymen rapidly secured the Arawe Peninsula. An American patrol sent to the peninsula's toe met only scattered resistance from Japanese rear guards. More than 20 Japanese located in a cave on the east side of the peninsula were killed by members of "E" Troop and personnel from the squadron headquarters; the remaining Japanese units in the area retreated to the east. The 2nd Squadron reached the peninsula's base at 2:30 pm, where it began to prepare its <a href="main%20line%20of%20resistance">main line of resistance</a> (MLR). By the end of 15 December, more than 1,600 Allied troops were ashore. The two Japanese Army companies that had been stationed at Arawe withdrew to the northeast, and took up positions at Didmop on the Pulie River about from the MLR; the naval unit defending Umtingalu retreated inland in a state of disarray.

The Allied naval force off Arawe was subjected to a heavy air raid shortly after the landing. At 9:00 am, eight <a href="Aichi%20D3A">Aichi D3A</a> "Val" dive bombers escorted by 56 <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">A6M5 "Zero"</a> fighters evaded the USAAF <a href="combat%20air%20patrol">combat air patrol</a> (CAP) of 16 <a href="Lockheed%20P-38%20Lightning">P-38 Lightning</a>s. The Japanese force attacked the recently arrived first supply echelon, which comprised five <a href="Landing%20Craft%20Tank">Landing Craft Tank</a> (LCT) and 14 <a href="Landing%20Craft%20Medium">Landing Craft Medium</a> (LCM), but these ships managed to evade the bombs dropped on them. The first wave of attackers suffered no losses, but at 11:15 am four P-38s shot down a Zero, and at 6:00 pm a force of 30 Zeros and 12 <a href="Mitsubishi%20G4M">Mitsubishi G4M</a>3 "Betty" and <a href="Mitsubishi%20Ki-21">Mitsubishi Ki-21</a>-II "Sally" bombers was driven off by four P-38s. The Japanese lost two Zeros in the day's air actions, but both pilots survived.

Although the U.S. ground troops faced no opposition in the days immediately after the landing, naval convoys carrying reinforcements to the Arawe area were repeatedly attacked. The second supply echelon came under continuous air attack on 16 December, resulting in the loss of as well as damage to , and four LCTs. About 42 men on board these ships were killed or seriously wounded. Another reinforcement convoy was attacked three times by dive bombers on 21 December as it unloaded at Arawe. Overall, at least 150 Japanese aircraft attacked Arawe that day. Further air attacks took place on 26, 27 and 31 December. However, the Allied air forces were able to mount a successful defense of the Arawe area as the coastwatcher parties in New Britain provided 30 to 60 minutes warning of most incoming raids. Between 15 and 31 December, at least 24 Japanese bombers and 32 fighters were shot down near Arawe. During the same time period, Allied air units also raided airfields at Rabaul and <a href="Madang">Madang</a> in New Guinea which were believed to be the bases of the aircraft which had attacked Arawe. In aerial combat over Rabaul on 17, 19, and 23 December, 14 Zeros were shot down by Allied aircraft. The process of unloading ships at Arawe was hampered by air attacks and congestion on House Fireman Beach. The beach party contributed to these delays as it was inexperienced and too small. The resultant problems with unloading LCTs caused some to leave the area before discharging all their cargo.
Air attacks on Arawe dropped off after 1 January. As a result of the heavy losses they suffered during attacks on Arawe and Cape Gloucester, and the damage caused by Allied raids on Rabaul, Japanese air units conducted only small-scale raids at night after this date. The IJN fighter units based at Rabaul and nearby <a href="Kavieng">Kavieng</a> were also kept busy throughout January and February 1944 defending their bases from continuous Allied air attacks. Few raids were made against the Arawe area after 90 mm anti-aircraft guns were established there on 1 February. These weak attacks did not disrupt the Allied convoys. In the three weeks after the landing, of supplies as well as 541 artillery guns and vehicles were transported to Arawe. On 20 February, the Japanese air units at Rabaul and Kavieng were permanently withdrawn to <a href="Chuuk%20State">Truk</a>, ending any significant aerial threat to Allied forces in New Britain from the IJN.

Following the landing, the 59th Engineer Company constructed logistics facilities in the Arawe area. Due to the Japanese air raids, priority was given to the construction of a partially underground evacuation hospital, which was completed in January 1944. The underground hospital was replaced with a 120-bed above-ground facility in April 1944. Pilelo Island was selected for the site of the PT boat facilities, and a pier for refueling the boats and dispersed fuel storage bays were built there. A pier was constructed at House Fireman Beach between 26 February and 22 April 1944 to accommodate small ships; three LCT jetties were also built north of the beach. A by airstrip was hurriedly built for artillery observation aircraft on 13 January, and this was later upgraded and surfaced with coral. The engineer company also constructed of all-weather roads in the Arawe region and provided the Director Task Force with water via salt water distillation units on Pilelo Island and wells dug on the mainland. These projects were continuously hampered by shortages of construction materials, but the engineers were able to complete them by improvising and making use of salvaged material.

The 112th Cavalry RCT strengthened its defensive positions during the week following the invasion. As "A" Troop had lost all of its weapons and other equipment during the landing attempt at Umtingalu, supplies were air-dropped into the beachhead during the afternoon of 16 December to re-equip the unit. The troop was also assigned 50 replacement personnel. Most of "B" Troop was also transferred from Pilelo Island to the mainland in the days after the landing. The regiment improved its MLR by removing vegetation in order to create clear <a href="Field%20of%20fire%20%28weaponry%29">fields of fire</a>, establishing <a href="Land%20mine">minefields</a> and wire entanglements and laying down a <a href="field%20telephone">field telephone</a> network. A reserve defensive line was also established closer to Cape Merkus, and patrols were conducted each day along the shores of the peninsula in search of Japanese personnel attempting to infiltrate the Task Force's rear area. These patrols located and killed between ten and twenty Japanese near Cape Merkus. In addition, the regiment established a network of <a href="observation%20post">observation post</a>s throughout the Arawe area; these included positions in villages, key positions on the peninsula and on several offshore islands. "G" Troop was assigned to secure Umtingalu, and after doing so the troop established a patrol base at the village as well as two observation posts along the track which connected it to the MLR.

The commander of the Japanese 17th Division—Lieutenant General Yasushi Sakai—ordered that Arawe be urgently reinforced when he was informed of the landing there. He did not believe that this would be the main Allied effort in western New Britain, however. The force under Komori was ordered to make haste. The 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry Regiment, stationed at Cape Bushing on the south coast of New Britain about east of Arawe was also directed to move by sea to counter the Allied invasion. One of this battalion's infantry companies remained at Cape Bushing, however. Komori was appointed the commander of all Japanese forces in the Arawe area, which were subsequently designated the Komori Force. The 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry Regiment landed at the village of Omoi on the night of 18 December, and started overland the next day to link up with Komori at Didmop. The battalion took eight days to cover the between Omoi and Didmop as it became lost on several occasions while travelling through trackless jungle and paused whenever contact with American forces seemed likely. Komori reached Didmop on 19 December, and gathered the units that had retreated from Umtingalu into his command. On the basis of discussions with personnel who had witnessed the landing at Arawe, Komori mistakenly concluded that they had greatly overestimated the size of the Allied force. As a result, on 20 December he decided to launch a counteroffensive against the American positions.
After establishing its beachhead, the Director Task Force conducted a series of reconnaissance patrols. Cunningham had been ordered to gather intelligence on Japanese forces in western New Britain, and on 17 December he dispatched a patrol of cavalrymen in two <a href="LCVP%20%28United%20States%29">LCVPs</a> (Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel) to the west of Arawe to investigate the <a href="Itni%20River">Itni River</a> area. These landing craft encountered seven Japanese barges carrying part of the 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry Regiment near <a href="Cape%20Peiho">Cape Peiho</a>, west of Arawe, on 18 December. After an exchange of gunfire the U.S. soldiers abandoned their landing craft and returned to Arawe along the coast. Another patrol travelling in LCVPs was fired on by Japanese barges near Umtingalu on 18 December but was able to return to Cape Merkus. Japanese barges were also sighted near Arawe on 23 December. Cunningham believed that a large Japanese force was heading for the beachhead, and contacted Krueger on 24 December to request that the 2nd Battalion of the 158th Infantry Regiment be dispatched to reinforce his command. Krueger agreed to this request, and ordered that three of the battalion's four infantry companies be sent to Arawe. "G" Company of the 2nd Battalion, 158th Infantry arrived on 27 December and the other two companies reached Arawe in early January.

After organizing his force while waiting for the 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry Regiment, Komori began his advance on Arawe on 24 December. He arrived at the airstrip to the north of Arawe during the early hours of Christmas Day. During that morning, elements of the Komori Force ambushed two platoon-sized American patrols traveling in trucks northeast of Umtingalu. The American units withdrew to the village and reinforced "G" Troop's defensive position there. The American force defeated several Japanese attempts to move around Umtingalu during the day, and killed at least three enemy soldiers. Cunningham believed that the force encountered around Umtingalu was the advance guard of a much larger body of Japanese soldiers advancing from Gasmata, and withdrew the troopers stationed around the village to positions behind the MLR. At 10:30 pm that night, 50 Japanese soldiers made a poorly coordinated attack on the MLR. While they succeeded in overrunning some American positions, the Japanese were repulsed by fire from the 112th Cavalry's mortars. The Americans lost one man killed and eight wounded, and estimated that the Japanese had suffered twelve casualties.

The Japanese offensive continued after the Christmas Day attack. Two small attacks, each involving 15 soldiers, were made against the eastern edge of the MLR on the nights of 26 and 27 December. These were also repulsed by the 112th Cavalry's light mortars, and inflicted only a small number of casualties on the American force. On 28 December part of the 112th Cavalry Regiment's "B" Troop set out from the MLR in an attempt to reach Umtingalu, but withdrew after encountering snipers and some light mortar fire. A platoon from "C" Troop also made an unsuccessful patrol from the western end of the MLR during which it suffered six casualties from Japanese machine gun and rifle fire. The same day, Komori dispatched a force of between 20 and 30 soldiers to destroy the American mortar positions. The Japanese soldiers infiltrated the American positions by wading through swamps at the western end of the MLR, but were detected before they could reach dry land. The Director Task Force mounted a strong response, which included a counterattack by elements of three cavalry troops and a platoon from the 158th Infantry Regiment supported by mortars. The Japanese force suffered 17 casualties.

The 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry Regiment arrived in the Arawe area on the afternoon of 29 December, and conducted several small and unsuccessful attacks in early January 1944 before taking up positions about north of the American MLR. These positions comprised shallow trenches and foxholes which were difficult to see. While there were only about 100 Japanese soldiers in the area, they moved their six machine guns frequently, making them difficult targets for American mortars and artillery.

An American patrol located the Japanese defensive position on 1 January 1944. "B" Troop of the 112th Cavalry Regiment launched an attack later that morning, but was beaten off by heavy fire; the Americans suffered three killed and 15 wounded in this action. On 4 January, "G" Troop incurred three killed and 21 wounded in an unsuccessful attack on well-built Japanese positions. This operation had been conducted without artillery support in an attempt to surprise the Japanese, and also included a feint against Umtingalu involving several LCMs. Further attacks on 6, 7 and 11 January failed to make any headway, but gave the cavalrymen experience in maneuvering through the Japanese defensive positions. These American operations were conducted on a limited scale as Cunningham and the 112th Cavalry Regiment's other senior officers believed that the unit had already achieved the goals of the landing at Arawe and did not want to incur unnecessary casualties.
On 6 January, Cunningham requested further reinforcements, including tanks, to tackle the Japanese defenses. Krueger approved this request and ordered "F" Company, 158th Infantry Regiment and "B" Company of the USMC <a href="1st%20Tank%20Battalion">1st Tank Battalion</a> to Arawe; the two units arrived on 10 and 12 January respectively. The Marine tanks and two companies of the 158th Infantry Regiment subsequently practiced tank-infantry cooperation from 13 to 15 January; during this period the 112th Cavalry continued to conduct patrols into Japanese-held areas. By this time, the Komori Force had incurred casualties of at least 65 killed, 75 wounded and 14 missing in action as a result of its offensive actions as well as the attacks on it conducted by the Director Task Force. The Japanese were also suffering from severe supply shortages and an outbreak of <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>.

The Director Task Force launched its attack on 16 January. That morning, a <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadron</a> of <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a> heavy bombers dropped one hundred and thirty-six bombs on the Japanese defenses, and 20 B-25s strafed the area. Following an intensive artillery and mortar barrage the Marine tank company, two companies of the 158th Infantry and C Troop, 112th Cavalry Regiment attacked. The tanks led the advance, with each being followed by a group of infantrymen. The cavalry troop and three tanks were initially held in reserve, but were sent into action at 12:00 pm to mop up a Japanese position. The attack was successful, and reached its objectives by 4:00 pm. Cunningham then directed the force to withdraw to the MLR; during this part of the operation two Marine tanks—which had become immobile—were destroyed to prevent the Japanese from using them as <a href="Bunker">pillboxes</a>. American engineers destroyed the Japanese defensive position the next day. The Director Task Force suffered 22 killed and 64 wounded in this operation and estimated that 139 Japanese had been killed.

Following the American attack, Komori pulled his remaining force back to defend the airstrip. As this was not an Allied objective, the Japanese were not subjected to further attacks by ground troops other than occasional patrol clashes and ambushes. As a result of the supply shortages, many of the Japanese soldiers fell sick. Attempts to bring supplies in by sea from Gasmata were disrupted by U.S. Navy PT boats and the force lacked enough porters to supply itself through overland trails. Komori concluded that his force was serving no purpose, and on 8 February informed his superiors that it faced destruction due to supply shortages. They responded by ordering Komori to hold his positions, though his force was awarded two Imperial citations in recognition of its supposed success in defending the airstrip.

The 1st Marine Division's landing at Cape Gloucester on 26 December 1943 was successful. The Marines secured the airfields that were the main objective of the operation on 29 December against only light Japanese opposition. Heavy fighting took place during the first two weeks of 1944 when the Marines advanced south to the east of their initial beachhead to secure Borgen Bay. Little fighting took place once this area had been captured and the Marines patrolled extensively in an attempt to locate the Japanese. On 16 February, a Marine patrol from Cape Gloucester made contact with an Army patrol from Arawe at the village of Gilnit. On 23 February, the remnants of the Japanese force at Cape Gloucester were ordered to withdraw to Rabaul.
The Komori Force was also directed to withdraw on 24 February as part of the general Japanese retreat from western New Britain. The Japanese immediately began to leave their positions, and headed north along inland trails to join other units. The Americans did not detect this withdrawal until 27 February, when an attack conducted by the 2nd Squadron, 112th Cavalry and the Marine tank company to clear the Arawe area of Japanese encountered no opposition. The Director Task Force subsequently established a number of observation posts along the southern coast of New Britain and increased the distances covered by its reconnaissance patrols. Komori fell behind his unit, and was killed on 9 April near San Remo on New Britain's north coast when he, his executive officer and two enlisted men they were travelling with were ambushed by a patrol from the <a href="2nd%20Battalion%205th%20Marines">2nd Battalion, 5th Marines</a>, which had <a href="Battle%20of%20Talasea">landed around Volupai and captured Talasea</a>, on the <a href="Willaumez%20Peninsula">Willaumez Peninsula</a>, in early March.

The Japanese force at Arawe suffered much heavier casualties than the Allies. The Director Task Force's total casualties between 15 December 1943 and the end of major fighting in the area were 118 dead, 352 wounded, and four missing. Most of these casualties were members of the 112th Cavalry Regiment, which suffered 72 killed, 142 wounded and four missing. Japanese casualties over this period were 304 men killed and three captured.

In the period immediately after the Japanese withdrawal, the Director Task Force remained at Arawe. In line with standard practice, the 112th Cavalry continued to improve the defensive positions in the area. The regiment also undertook training, and some men were granted leave in Australia and the United States. Combat patrols continued to be conducted in the Arawe region in search of Japanese stragglers. Elements of the <a href="40th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">40th Infantry Division</a> began to arrive at Arawe in April 1944 to assume responsibility for garrisoning the area. The 112th Cavalry Regiment was informed that it was to be deployed in New Guinea in early June, and the Director Task Force was dissolved at this time. The regiment sailed for the Aitape area of New Guinea on 8 June and next saw combat there during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Driniumor%20River">Battle of Driniumor River</a>. The 40th Infantry Division maintained a garrison at Arawe until the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a>'s <a href="5th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">5th Division</a> assumed responsibility for New Britain in late November 1944.

Historians disagree over whether the Arawe operation was worthwhile for the Allies. The <a href="official%20history">official history</a> of the USMC in World War II stated that the presence of two experienced Japanese battalions at Arawe made the 1st Marine Division's task at Cape Gloucester easier. However, <a href="Samuel%20Eliot%20Morison">Samuel Eliot Morison</a> wrote in his "<a href="History%20of%20United%20States%20Naval%20Operations%20in%20World%20War%20II">History of United States Naval Operations in World War II</a>" that "Arawe was of small value" as the Allies never used it as a naval base and the garrison stationed in the area after the landings would have been better employed elsewhere. The U.S. Army's official history concluded that in retrospect the landings at Arawe and Cape Gloucester "were probably not essential to the reduction of Rabaul or the approach to the Philippines", though the offensive in western New Britain had some benefits and was not "excessively high in casualties".

Christmas 1994 nor'easter

The Christmas 1994 nor'easter was an intense <a href="cyclone">cyclone</a> along the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast of the United States</a> and <a href="Atlantic%20Canada">Atlantic Canada</a>. It developed from an area of <a href="low-pressure%20area">low pressure</a> in the southeast <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> near the <a href="Florida%20Keys">Florida Keys</a>, and moved across the state of <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. As it entered the warm waters of the <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a> in the Atlantic Ocean, it began to rapidly intensify, exhibiting traits of a <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical system</a>, including the formation of an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a>. It attained a pressure of 970 <a href="Bar%20%28unit%29">millibars</a> on December 23 and 24, and after moving northward, it came ashore near New York City on Christmas Eve. Because of the uncertain nature of the storm, the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> (NHC) did not classify it as a tropical cyclone.

Heavy rain from the developing storm contributed to significant flooding in <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>. Much of the rest of the East Coast was affected by high winds, coastal flooding, and <a href="beach%20erosion">beach erosion</a>. <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> State and <a href="New%20England">New England</a> bore the brunt of the storm; damage was extensive on <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>, and in <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, 130,000 households lost electric power during the storm. Widespread damage and power outages also occurred throughout <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a> and <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, where the storm generated waves along the coast. Because of the warm weather pattern that contributed to the storm's development, precipitation was limited to rain. Two people were killed, and damage amounted to at least $21 million.

The storm originated in an upper-level <a href="low-pressure%20area">low pressure system</a> that moved southeastward from the central <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a> into the <a href="Deep%20South">Deep South</a> of the United States. After reaching the southeast Gulf of Mexico, the disturbance underwent <a href="cyclogenesis">cyclogenesis</a>, and the resultant system moved through Florida on December 22 in response to an approaching <a href="Trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a>. <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> forecaster Jack Beven noted that "as it moved out into the Bahamas, it appeared to take on the characteristics of a tropical storm." The uncertain nature of the storm prevented the NHC from issuing advisories on it, and forecasters lacked sufficient data to fully assess the cyclone for potential <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical characteristics</a>. The same trough that pushed the storm across Florida had moved to the north, allowing for <a href="high-pressure%20area">high pressure</a> to develop in the upper levels of the atmosphere.

Deemed a "hybrid storm", the cyclone rapidly intensified in warm waters of up to from the Gulf Stream combined with a cold air mass over the United States. The system continued to rapidly intensify while moving within the Gulf Stream; it developed central <a href="atmospheric%20convection">convection</a>, an unusual trait for an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a>, and at one point exhibited an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a>. Despite these indications of tropical characteristics, "There was no front associated with it and it had a warm core, but the radius of maximum winds was more than , so under the standard NHC criteria it didn't qualify as a tropical storm." On December 23 and 24, the <a href="nor%27easter">nor'easter</a> intensified to attain a barometric pressure of . An upper-level low pressure system that developed behind the storm began to intensify and grew to be larger in size than the original disturbance. In an interaction known as the <a href="Fujiwhara%20effect">Fujiwhara effect</a>, the broad circulation of the secondary low swung the primary nor'easter northwestward towards southern New York and New England. The original low passed along the south shore of <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>, and made landfall near New York City on December 24. Subsequently, it moved over southeastern <a href="New%20York%20State">New York State</a>. On December 25, the system began to rapidly weaken as it moved towards <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, before the pair of low pressure systems moved out to sea in tandem in the early hours of December 26.

In South Carolina, flooding associated with the cyclone was considered to be the worst since 1943. Over of rainfall was reported, while winds brought down trees and ripped awnings. In addition, the coast suffered the effects of <a href="beach%20erosion">beach erosion</a>. Thousands of electric customers in the state lost power. As a result of the heavy rainfall, several dams became overwhelmed by rising waters. Extensive flooding of roads and highways was reported, many of which were closed as a result. Up to of water flooded some homes in the region.

Good Girl Gone Bad

Good Girl Gone Bad is the third <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by singer <a href="Rihanna">Rihanna</a>. It was released on May 31, 2007, by <a href="Def%20Jam%20Recordings">Def Jam Recordings</a> and SRP Records. Rihanna worked with various producers on the album, including <a href="Tricky%20Stewart">Christopher "Tricky" Stewart</a>, <a href="Terius%20Nash">Terius "Dream" Nash</a>, <a href="Neo%20da%20Matrix">Neo da Matrix</a>, <a href="Timbaland">Timbaland</a>, <a href="Carl%20Sturken">Carl Sturken</a>, <a href="Evan%20Rogers">Evan Rogers</a> and <a href="Stargate%20%28production%20team%29">StarGate</a>. Inspired by <a href="Brandy%20Norwood">Brandy Norwood</a>'s fourth studio album "<a href="Afrodisiac%20%28Brandy%20album%29">Afrodisiac</a>" (2004), "Good Girl Gone Bad" is a <a href="Pop%20music">pop</a>, <a href="dance-pop">dance-pop</a> and <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> album with 1980s music influences. Described as a turning point in Rihanna's career, it represents a departure from the Caribbean sound of her previous releases, "<a href="Music%20of%20the%20Sun">Music of the Sun</a>" (2005) and "<a href="A%20Girl%20like%20Me%20%28Rihanna%20album%29">A Girl like Me</a>" (2006). Apart from the sound, she also endorsed a new image for the release going from an innocent girl to an edgier and more sexual look.

Critics gave generally positive reviews of the album, praising its composition and Rihanna's new musical direction, though some criticized the album's lyrics and inconsistency. The album received seven <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> nominations and one win in the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Rap/Sung%20Collaboration">Best Rap/Sung Collaboration</a> category for "<a href="Umbrella%20%28song%29">Umbrella</a>" at the <a href="2008%20Grammy%20Awards">2008 ceremony</a>. The album debuted at number two on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart and sold 162,000 copies in its first week. Certified six-times platinum by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA), it sold more than 2.8 million copies in the United States. The album reached number one in Canada, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. As of 2017, the album had sold over 9 million copies worldwide.

"Good Girl Gone Bad" spawned five singles, including the international hits "Umbrella" and "<a href="Don%27t%20Stop%20the%20Music%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">Don't Stop the Music</a>"; "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" placed the former at number 412 on the magazine's <a href="500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a> list. To promote the album, Rihanna embarked on her first worldwide concert tour and third overall, the <a href="Good%20Girl%20Gone%20Bad%20Tour">Good Girl Gone Bad Tour</a>. The album was reissued as "" in June 2008 with three new songs, including the "Billboard" Hot 100 number-one hits "<a href="Take%20a%20Bow%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">Take a Bow</a>" and "<a href="Disturbia%20%28song%29">Disturbia</a>". It was followed by Rihanna's first remix album, "", in January 2009, which featured remixes from <a href="Moto%20Blanco">Moto Blanco</a>, <a href="Tony%20Moran">Tony Moran</a>, the <a href="Soul%20Seekerz">Soul Seekerz</a> and the <a href="Wideboys">Wideboys</a>.

<a href="Rihanna">Rihanna</a>'s second studio album, "<a href="A%20Girl%20like%20Me%20%28Rihanna%20album%29">A Girl like Me</a>", was released in April 2006. It is a <a href="pop%20music">pop</a>-oriented record with <a href="dancehall">dancehall</a> and <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> influences. It had a mixed critical reception: some critics praised Rihanna's new musical direction, while others criticized some of the album's songs. Around its time of release, many critics felt that Rihanna's style, sound, and musical material were too similar to those of American singer <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a>. The album sold over 587,308 copies in the United Kingdom and more than 1,330,000 copies in the United States.

In early 2007, Rihanna began work on her third studio album. In an interview with <a href="MTV%20News">MTV News</a>, she announced that "the new music is going in a different direction. Not on purpose, but I just want to hear something fresh and mostly uptempo. I think that's where I want to go on this one. You feel different every album, and [at] this stage I feel like I want to do a lot of uptempo [songs]." The same year, Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by actress <a href="Charlize%20Theron">Charlize Theron</a>'s bob cut in the 2005 science fiction thriller "<a href="%C3%86on%20Flux%20%28film%29">Æon Flux</a>".

Rihanna explained that she wanted to keep the audience dancing and be soulful at the same time. She sought to make an album that people would listen to without skipping tracks. She cited "<a href="Afrodisiac%20%28Brandy%20album%29">Afrodisiac</a>" (2004), the fourth studio album by American singer <a href="Brandy%20Norwood">Brandy Norwood</a>, as her main inspiration for the album. In May 2007, Rihanna revealed that she called the album "Good Girl Gone Bad" because it represents her bolder and more independent image: "I'm not the innocent Rihanna anymore. I'm taking a lot more risks and chances. I felt when I cut my hair, it shows people I'm not trying to look or be anybody else. The album is very edgy."

"Good Girl Gone Bad" was recorded in <a href="Westlake%20Recording%20Studios">Westlake Recording Studios</a> and Conway Studios in Los Angeles, Battery Studios and Roc the Mic Studios in New York City, Chicago Recording Company and Pressure Studios in Chicago, Phase One Audio Group in Toronto, Lethal Studios in <a href="Bridgetown%2C%20Barbados">Bridgetown, Barbados</a>, Espionage Studios in <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a> and Parr Street Studios in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>. Rihanna spent the week of the <a href="2007%20Grammy%20Awards">2007 Grammy Awards</a> working with American R&B singer-songwriter <a href="Ne-Yo">Ne-Yo</a>, who gave her vocal lessons. They wrote and sang "<a href="Hate%20That%20I%20Love%20You">Hate That I Love You</a>", which was co-written and produced by Norwegian duo <a href="Stargate%20%28production%20team%29">StarGate</a>. Ne-Yo told "<a href="Vibe%20%28magazine%29">Vibe</a>" magazine, "The best way to express an emotion like love is through storytelling. It makes it more 'I can relate to this character in this song, because I've been through something similar.' You hear that kind of storytelling in the song that I wrote for Rihanna called 'Hate That I Love You'."

American producers <a href="Tricky%20Stewart">Tricky Stewart</a> and <a href="Terius%20Nash">Dream</a> had written the track "<a href="Umbrella%20%28song%29">Umbrella</a>" in 2007 with pop singer <a href="Britney%20Spears">Britney Spears</a> in mind. Her label rejected the song before she could hear it, stating they had enough songs for her to record; at the time, Spears was working on her fifth studio album "<a href="Blackout%20%28Britney%20Spears%20album%29">Blackout</a>". The producers then reached out to <a href="Mary%20J.%20Blige">Mary J. Blige</a>, who did not have time to consider the song for her next album. Finally, <a href="Antonio%20%26quot%3BL.A.%26quot%3B%20Reid">L.A. Reid</a>, then-CEO of <a href="Def%20Jam%20Recordings">Def Jam Recordings</a>, bought the record and forwarded it to Rihanna. Initially, Stewart was unsure whether Rihanna was the right artist for the song, but after they had recorded the "ella, ella" <a href="catch%20phrase">catch phrase</a> for the track, he felt optimistic. Rapper <a href="Jay%20Z">Jay Z</a> added <a href="rapping">rap</a> vocals. Stewart also co-wrote and produced "Breakin' Dishes" with Nash.

"<a href="Rehab%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">Rehab</a>", "Sell Me Candy", and "Lemme Get That" were composed and produced by <a href="Timbaland">Timbaland</a> for the album. He was on the <a href="FutureSex/LoveShow">FutureSex/LoveShow</a> concert tour with <a href="Justin%20Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a> to promote Timberlake's 2006 album "<a href="FutureSex/LoveSounds">FutureSex/LoveSounds</a>". After a show in Chicago, they joined Rihanna in the studio, where Timberlake experimented with beats and melodies. Weeks later, the three met in New York City, where Timberlake had conceptualized a song for Rihanna. Timbaland, who penned a song for Rihanna under the title "Rehab", was producing a beat, over which Timberlake improvised his lyrics. Hannon Lane also co-wrote and co-produced the song. Timberlake told "Entertainment Weekly" that he believed "Rehab" to be "the bridge for [Rihanna] to be accepted as an adult in the music industry". Rihanna told Robert Copsey of "<a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>" that she enjoyed working with Timberlake, and learned much from the sessions.

A <a href="dance-pop">dance-pop</a> and pop/R&B album influenced by <a href="1980s%20music">1980s music</a>, "Good Girl Gone Bad" is a departure from the Caribbean sound of Rihanna's previous two records. Lyrically, the album is close to some <a href="teen%20pop">teen pop</a> records, "where sexual-ism and consumerism supersede personal connection."
The LP opens with the lead single "Umbrella", an R&B song performed with <a href="Drum%20kit">drums</a> and thundercloud <a href="synths">synths</a>. Dorian Lynskey of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" compared the singer's vocals to the voices of <a href="Ciara">Ciara</a> and <a href="Cassie%20Ventura">Cassie</a>. The second track, "Push Up On Me", features echo <a href="Electro%20%28music%29">electro</a> claps and surging synths. "<a href="Don%27t%20Stop%20the%20Music%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">Don't Stop the Music</a>" is a dance-pop and <a href="techno">techno</a> song that contains rhythmic devices used mainly in <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop music</a>. The song samples the line "Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa" from Michael Jackson's 1983 single "<a href="Wanna%20Be%20Startin%27%20Somethin">Wanna Be Startin' Somethin</a>'". The fourth song is "Breakin' Dishes"; Peter Robinson of "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" called it a "wronged-woman bonanza, packed with hooks, chants and flashes of lyrical brilliance." "<a href="Shut%20Up%20and%20Drive">Shut Up and Drive</a>" is a <a href="New%20wave%20music">new wave</a> and <a href="pop%20rock">pop rock</a> song, influenced by 1970s and 1980s musical styles, sampling <a href="New%20Order%20%28band%29">New Order</a>'s 1983 single "<a href="Blue%20Monday%20%28New%20Order%20song%29">Blue Monday</a>". The collaboration with Ne-Yo, "Hate That I Love You", is a <a href="Folk%20music">folky</a> R&B song; Nick Levine of "Digital Spy" compared it to Ne-Yo's singles "<a href="Sexy%20Love">Sexy Love</a>" and "<a href="Because%20of%20You%20%28Ne-Yo%20song%29">Because of You</a>".

The seventh track on the album, "Say It", samples the 1990s song "Flex" by <a href="Mad%20Cobra">Mad Cobra</a>; it consists of silky and warm <a href="Groove%20%28music%29">groove</a> and features island-oriented music characteristics. "Sell Me Candy" features jumbled and noisy production with chaotic beats. The ninth song, "Lemme Get That", has boom-bap beats and is produced by Timbaland. "Rehab" is an old-styled R&B track with a groove that is built around tambourine shakes, <a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic guitar</a> swirls and a subtle backbeat. Doug Rule of "<a href="Metro%20Weekly">Metro Weekly</a>" noted similarities among the structures of "Rehab" and Timberlake's 2002 single "<a href="Cry%20Me%20a%20River%20%28Justin%20Timberlake%20song%29">Cry Me a River</a>". "Question Existing" is an "eerie, smoky, destitute, emotional, and a sonic sidestep." Tom Breihan of <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a> described the opening lyrics of the song as inspired by "puerile psuedoporn". The album concludes with the title track "Good Girl Gone Bad", which is played with an acoustic guitar and <a href="click%20track">click track</a>s.

"Good Girl Gone Bad" received generally favorable reviews from music critics. At <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a <a href="standard%20score">normalized</a> rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an <a href="weighted%20mean">average</a> score of 72 based on 17 reviews. "<a href="Uncut%20%28magazine%29">Uncut</a>" called it a "shiny, trans-atlantic blend of Europop vim, R&B grit and Caribbean bounce." Andy Kellman of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> deemed it quintessential pop music and said each of its tracks was a potential hit. Quentin B. Huff of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> praised the album, describing it as "more raw, perhaps edgier and more risqué" than Rihanna's previous material. Kelefa Sanneh of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that the album "sounds as if it were scientifically engineered to deliver hits". <a href="Peter%20Robinson%20%28journalist%29">Peter Robinson</a> of "The Observer" commended her collaborators for "masking her own shortcomings" and commented that, "While Rihanna lacks her peers' charisma, she's a great vessel for exhilarating mainstream pop." Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan found the album varied and satisfying. Neil Drumming of "Entertainment Weekly" felt that, although it "goes bad when Rihanna tries her hand at treacly ballads and glum sentiment", at times "Good Girl Gone Bad" is a "thrilling throwback to more than a decade ago, when upstart producers haphazardly mashed R&B with hip-hop to create chunky jeep anthems such as Mary J. Blige's '<a href="Real%20Love%20%28Mary%20J.%20Blige%20song%29">Real Love</a>'."

In a mixed review, Rodney Dugue of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" felt that the album "never settles on a sound" and only cited its three Timbaland-produced songs as highlights. Although he found the ballads to be improvements from Rihanna's previous albums, "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>"'s Sal Cinquemani criticized the lyrics, particularly those written by Justin Timberlake, as an "Achilles' high heel for Rihanna". Alex Macpherson of "The Guardian" found Rihanna to be "ill-suited" for its dance-pop songs and stated, "The gimmicky samples and pounding beats bury her personality, and the summery reggae of her first two albums is sorely missed." <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> of <a href="MSN%20Music">MSN Music</a> cited "Umbrella" as a "choice cut", indicating "a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money".

At the <a href="2008%20Grammy%20Awards">2008 Grammy Awards</a> ceremony, "Good Girl Gone Bad" received seven <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s nominations, including <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Record%20of%20the%20Year">Record of the Year</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Song%20of%20the%20Year">Song of the Year</a> for "Umbrella", Best Dance Recording for "Don't Stop the Music", <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20R%26amp%3BB%20Performance%20by%20a%20Duo%20or%20Group%20with%20Vocals">Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20R%26amp%3BB%20Song">Best R&B Song</a> for "Hate That I Love You".

It became Rihanna's then-best start album entry. The next week, it fell to number seven with 81,000 copies sold. The re-issue sold 63,000 copies in the first week and helped "Good Girl Gone Bad" jump from number 124 to number seven on the US "Billboard" 200 in its 55th week.

Before its physical release, "Umbrella" achieved the biggest debut in the six-year history of the iTunes Store in the United States, breaking a record previously held by <a href="Shakira">Shakira</a>'s 2006 single "<a href="Hips%20Don%27t%20Lie">Hips Don't Lie</a>". Following its digital release, the song debuted atop the <a href="Hot%20Digital%20Songs">Hot Digital Songs</a> chart, with first-week sales of more than 277,000 units. The single became the highest digital debut in the United States since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking downloads in 2003, surpassing Timberlake's "<a href="SexyBack">SexyBack</a>" 250,000 sales record in 2006.

According to <a href="Biography.com">Biography.com</a>, "Good Girl Gone Bad" inspired Rihanna to transform her image from a "teen pop princess" persona into a "fully fledged superstar and sex symbol". "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" magazine noted that Rihanna follows the likes of recording artists <a href="Janet%20Jackson">Janet Jackson</a> and <a href="Christina%20Aguilera">Christina Aguilera</a> "when she sheds her innocent image for an edgier look and sound". Jay-Z also spoke about "Umbrella" and stated that the song represents an artistic grow for Rihanna, "If you listen to the lyrics to that song, you know the depth and how far she's come." Da'Shan Smith of "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" commented on "Good Girl Gone Bad"'s impact for Rihanna's career on the tenth anniversary of the album's release: "The "Good Girl" era became a universally recognized moment where RiRi solidified her position as an international superstar, her signature bob haircut and newly seductive stage persona captivating fans and press." 

Regarding the commercial impact of the album, "Entertainment Weekly"'s Margeaux Watson wrote, "For a pop star who was once dismissed as being incapable of yielding more than one hit song per album, Rihanna's newfound staying power is nothing short of remarkable–and proof that there's room for more than one diva in this game." Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic concluded that it was "Good Girl Gone Bad" that made Rihanna a "full-fledged international pop star with a regular presence atop the charts". Nick Levine of "Digital Spy" described the album, as the closest thing to a "<a href="Thriller%20%28Michael%20Jackson%20album%29">Thriller</a>" that 2007/08 is likely to produce.

Avery Coonley School

The Avery Coonley School (ACS), commonly called Avery Coonley, is an <a href="independent%20school">independent</a>, <a href="Mixed-sex%20education">coeducational</a> <a href="day%20school">day school</a> serving academically <a href="Intellectual%20giftedness">gifted</a> students in <a href="Preschool%20education">preschool</a> through <a href="eighth%20grade">eighth grade</a> (approximately ages 3 to 14), and is located in <a href="Downers%20Grove%2C%20Illinois">Downers Grove, Illinois</a>. The school was founded in 1906 to promote the <a href="progressive%20education">progressive education</a>al theories developed by <a href="John%20Dewey">John Dewey</a> and other turn-of-the-20th-century philosophers, and was a nationally recognized model for progressive education well into the 1940s. From 1943 to 1965, Avery Coonley was part of the National College of Education (now <a href="National-Louis%20University">National-Louis University</a>), serving as a living laboratory for teacher training and educational research. In the 1960s, ACS became a regional research center and a leadership hub for independent schools, and began to focus on the education of the gifted.

The school has occupied several structures in its history, including a small cottage on the <a href="Coonley%20House">Coonley Estate</a> in <a href="Riverside%2C%20Illinois">Riverside, Illinois</a>, and another building designed by <a href="Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>. It moved to Downers Grove in 1916 and became the Avery Coonley School in 1929, with a new campus designed in the <a href="Prairie%20School">Prairie</a> and <a href="Arts%20and%20Crafts%20Movement">Arts and Crafts</a> styles, landscaped by <a href="Jens%20Jensen%20%28landscape%20architect%29">Jens Jensen</a>, who was known as "dean of the world's landscape architects". The campus has been expanded several times since the 1980s to create more space for arts, technology, and classrooms. Avery Coonley was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 2007, citing the "long-lasting influence on schools throughout the country" of the educational program and the design of the building and grounds.

The progressive legacy is still evident in the modern curriculum, which retains many traditions and educational activities dating back to the beginning of the school. Students work a minimum of one year above their current grade level, and explore broad themes allowing them to learn across subjects and engage in creative and collaborative projects, using instructional technology extensively. Opportunities to build on classroom studies are offered through a range of extracurricular activities. Admission is competitive and an <a href="Intelligence%20quotient">IQ</a> score of at least 124 is required. ACS is notable for its record of success in academic competitions at the state and national levels in mathematics, science, geography, and other subjects. ACS was recognized as a <a href="Blue%20Ribbon%20Schools%20Program">Blue Ribbon School</a> by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Education">United States Department of Education</a> in 1988. Avery Coonley attracted national media attention in 1994 when the school was banned from competition in the Illinois State Science Fair after winning for the fourth year in a row. Although the decision was later reversed, the controversy was decried by the press as an example of the "dumbing down" of education and the victory of self-esteem over excellence in schools.

In 1906, Queene Ferry Coonley, wife of wealthy <a href="Riverside%2C%20Illinois">Riverside</a> industrialist and publisher Avery Coonley, decided to start a <a href="kindergarten">kindergarten</a> program to allow children younger than five years old to attend. Queene Coonley was trained as a social worker and kindergarten teacher at the Detroit Normal School (now <a href="Wayne%20State%20University">Wayne State University</a>) and was impressed by the theories of <a href="Friedrich%20Fr%C3%B6bel">Friedrich Fröbel</a>, who believed children's early education should be an extension of their lives at home. Fröbel's theories captured the three main principles of what <a href="John%20Dewey">John Dewey</a> would later call the "kindergarten attitude", which applied not just to kindergartners but to children of all ages. Dewey wrote that the primary role of the school is to train children in cooperative living, the root of all learning is the activity of the child and not external material, and directing children's spontaneous impulses towards maintaining the collective life of the school is how they become prepared for adult life. Convinced of these principles, Coonley sought to enroll her four-year-old daughter in the Riverside School, one of the few public kindergartens in the area, but was disappointed when the child was not eligible because she had not yet turned five.

Coonley persuaded the director of the Riverside program, Lucia Burton Morse, and her assistant, Charlotte Krum, to help launch a new school. Morse and Krum had attended Elizabeth Harrison's Kindergarten College, which "championed the concept of kindergarten teaching in America and was one of the first teacher's colleges in the country to offer a four-year program culminating in the bachelor of education degree". There they had studied the educational theories of John Dewey and others, who stood opposed to the more traditional pedagogical practices of the day, which saw education as the business of transmitting long-standing bodies of information to new generations and inculcating moral training based on rules and standards of conduct. Their new progressive views of education emphasized an individualized approach to education and an integrated curriculum where children learned from experience and social interaction. According to Dewey, "it is a cardinal precept of the newer school of education that the beginning of instruction shall be made with the experience learners already have; that this experience and the capacities that have been developed during its course provide the starting point for all further learning." These ideas laid the foundations of what would become the "progressive movement" in education. Coonley, Morse, and Krum brought these ideas with them to the new school, which Coonley described as "a Children's Community. Its purpose was not so much to teach what others had thought or grown-ups had done, but for the children themselves to do something."

A small cottage on the Coonley estate served as the first school building, reflected by its original name, the Cottage School. The designer was <a href="Charles%20Whittlesey%20%28architect%29">Charles Whittlesey</a>, who had apprenticed under <a href="Louis%20Sullivan">Louis Sullivan</a>. The estate's main building, the Avery <a href="Coonley%20House">Coonley House</a>, designed by <a href="Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>, is now a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>. Over the years, many of the estate's buildings would be pressed into use as classrooms and residences for teachers. As new grades were added the school grew, and in 1911 Coonley commissioned Wright to design a larger space for the students. The new building was completed in 1912 and became known as the Coonley Playhouse, and featured dozens of brightly colored art glass windows, evoking flags, balloons, and confetti in what Wright referred to as a "kinder-symphony". "Their bright primary colors and lively geometric designs make them some of Wright's most famous windows."

Two years of kindergarten were offered, beginning at age four, and students progressed through to first grade with other students their age. The Cottage School was free to all students, and was supported both by Coonley's own resources and funds raised by the Kindergarten Education Association. The Association, of which Coonley was president, promoted new educational ideas and raised money to help support them. In 1915, John Dewey and his daughter Evelyn featured the Cottage School in their book, "The Schools of To-Morrow", which examined how progressive schools around the country put new educational ideas into action. They were especially struck by how prominently nature featured in school life, noting that they have, for example, a rare bird that is as much a personality in school life as any of the children, and the children, having cared for him and watched his growth and habits, have become much more interested in wild birds. In the backyard is a goat, the best liked thing on the place, where the children have raised him from a little kid; and they still do all the work of caring for him. The Deweys held the Cottage School as an example of training in good citizenship, commenting on its mock elections, self-government, and public service: "The school organized by the pupils into a civic league has made itself responsible for the conditions of the streets in certain portions of town, and is not only cleaning up but trying to get the rest of the town interested in the problem." The teaching of English was also noted, as it was not taught as a separate subject but as part of history lessons, journal-keeping, and other exercises. Dewey wrote, "The emphasis is put on helping the child to express his ideas; but such work provides ample opportunity for the required drill in the mechanics of writing."

At the same time the Playhouse was built, Coonley agreed to build a kindergarten in the nearby town of <a href="Downers%20Grove%2C%20Illinois">Downers Grove</a>, which did not have a public school. Coonley purchased land on Grove Street and commissioned the architectural firm of Perkins, Fellows & Hamilton to design the building. The school, led by Lucia Morse, was launched as the Kindergarten Extension Association School in 1912. In 1916, the Cottage School was closed and a first grade program was launched at the Downers Grove kindergarten, which was renamed the Junior Elementary School. To accommodate older students, a <a href="second%20grade">second grade</a> class was added in 1920 for students around seven years old, a <a href="third%20grade">third grade</a> in 1926 for eight-year-olds, and a <a href="fourth%20grade">fourth grade</a> for nine-year-old students shortly thereafter.

The Coonleys moved to Washington, D.C. in 1916, and while Queene continued to devote her time and money, she left the day-to-day direction of the school to Morse. Under her direction, the Junior Elementary School built upon the educational foundations established at the Cottage School, with its focus on the active participation of the students. Drama, music, and dance were important parts of the curriculum, and nature study remained an integral component of students' activities. These ideas, and nature study in particular, were largely the creation of Colonel <a href="Francis%20Wayland%20Parker">Francis Wayland Parker</a>, whom John Dewey once referred to as "the father of progressive education". The Junior Elementary School was a proving ground for these principles, which called for a new way of relating to students, allowing them to freely experience their lessons on their own terms. No distinction was made between boys' and girls' activities, which included gardening, carpentry, and cooking. Coonley recalled that "[w]e had boys and girls. We made no distinction, boys and girls cooked, boys and girls did carpenter work, boys and girls took an equal part in all matters of government." Students re-enacted history and literature, composed their own music, and spent much of their time outdoors. In 1924, Coonley and Morse helped found a journal entitled "Progressive Education", in which they published their own practical experiences at the school, accompanied by articles written by leading educational theorists, including John Dewey. It became the leading professional journal of the progressive education movement and was published until 1957.

Enrollment continued to grow, and a second building was added to the Junior Elementary School campus in the late 1920s, but still larger facilities were deemed necessary to accommodate future growth and additional grade levels. Coonley chose a wooded tract in Downers Grove, adjacent to the Maple Grove Forest Preserve, as the site for the new building, and her son-in-law, Waldron Faulkner, became the architect of the new building project. Over one hundred students attended school in the opened building on September 30, 1929, and it was renamed The Avery Coonley School, in honor of Coonley's late husband, who had died in 1920. Coonley chose an unusual mascot to represent the ideals of the school. She felt a <a href="seahorse">seahorse</a> was an example of a unique creature who was also a member of a larger community—an analogy for her vision for Avery Coonley. The seahorse swims upright, from which derives the school motto: "Onward and Upward", and representations of seahorses are reflected in decorative ironwork and the <a href="weather%20vane">weather vane</a> on the 1929 building.

<a href="Progressive%20education">Progressive education</a>, a pedagogy promoting learning through real-life experiences, was at its zenith in the United States in the 1920s and 30s, and the Avery Coonley School was a widely known model of these theories in action. Avery Coonley was featured regularly in "Progressive Education" and other professional journals, and in 1938, the editor of "Progressive Education," Gertrude Hartman, published a profile of the Avery Coonley School in her book "Finding Wisdom: Chronicles of a School of Today". She noted, "[v]isitors from all parts of the United States and from foreign countries [came] to see the school—sometimes as many as thirty in a day." Hartman described in great detail the curriculum and daily life of the school, which had by then added a seventh and eighth grade, commenting that the most noticeable thing about it is the spirit of earnestness and joy which pervades it ... There is a fundamental philosophy of life and education underlying the work of the school, which gives clear direction to all its activities. Broad areas are planned, which form the framework of the curriculum. These however are flexible and subject to modification depending upon conditions. The book described the progress of the students from their first year of kindergarten through their ten years of study, capturing in photos, stories, and examples of students' work their encounters with nature, history, art and other subjects through creative play and collaborative projects. She concluded with observations about the importance of the daily life of the school in developing social responsibility: It is the belief of those concerned with the school that out of the kind of education described here will emerge more socially enlightened members of society than the education of our generation has produced ... The method in which those in the school place their faith is the building into the very nature of growing boys and girls, through their growing years, those qualities of mind and spirit from which alone a new attitude towards human relations can evolve. "Finding Wisdom" became a classic in the education field and solidified the Avery Coonley School's national reputation as a model of progressive education.

Morse died in 1940, after 34 years as director, and several years went by without a strong local leadership. To ensure a sounder footing for the future, Coonley merged Avery Coonley with the National College of Education (NCE, formerly the Chicago Kindergarten College and now <a href="National-Louis%20University">National-Louis University</a>) in <a href="Evanston%2C%20Illinois">Evanston, Illinois</a>, in 1943. The two institutions had close ties dating back to Morse's Kindergarten College days, and the arrangement took advantage of the NCE's financial and teaching resources while Avery Coonley provided a living laboratory for teacher training and educational research. Under NCE management, ACS continued to offer a curriculum that emphasized practical learning, outdoor education—including farming—and hands-on activities like automobile repair. German and French were added in 1949, with students beginning conversational French in first grade.

Coonley died in 1958; ACS had looked to Coonley for her leadership over the years but even more so for her philanthropy. ACS began charging tuition in 1929, but still relied on Coonley's financial support, and her death caused serious financial hardship. Under the direction of newly appointed <a href="Head%20teacher">headmaster</a> John Malach, a summer program was launched in 1960, open to all children from the surrounding area, to increase revenues and visibility. A swimming pool was added in 1961 to bolster the program. Enrollment had declined over the years and Malach marketed the program aggressively, personally interviewing prospective students. In 1964 enrollment again reached 200 students, which brought in additional tuition and much needed financial stability.

In 1965, the benefits of the National College of Education partnership were less evident and the Administrative Board purchased Avery Coonley from the NCE. Under Malach's leadership, ACS continued to experiment and innovate. Despite widespread skepticism among contemporary educators that kindergartners were ready to read, ACS launched an early reading program in the early 1960s. Malach's stance was that "we don't believe a child should be taught because he or she is now 6 years old or in 1st grade. Our children begin to learn to read when the teacher determines the child is ready. Then the teacher works individually with the child at his or her own pace." By this time, however, the once-radical ideas of progressive education had become "conventional wisdom" and kindergarten was a ubiquitous feature of American public schools. As part of Malach's "bid to reforge the leadership role that Avery Coonley School had played during its early years", ACS joined the Independent Schools Association of the Central States (ISACS) in 1961. ISACS was founded in 1908 to promote <a href="best%20practices">best practices</a> in independent schools, and instituted a mandatory accreditation program for member schools in 1961. Avery Coonley served as the headquarters of ISACS from 1970 until the central office was dissolved in 2000.

Malach also established the Institute for Educational Research (IER) in 1964 as a center for educational experimentation. The Institute, headquartered at ACS, was a joint venture with more than thirty public school districts, which collaborated on research projects and shared in the findings. The large number of schools involved ensured that statistically significant research samples were available and multiple projects could be pursued at one time. In one of the first projects of the Institute, 36 history teachers wrote over 2,000 test questions to help demonstrate that "many teachers want assistance in writing better evaluation items based on behavioral objectives". Examples of other projects include kindergarten speech programs, elementary science programs, and <a href="speed%20reading">speed reading</a> in <a href="middle%20school">junior high school</a>.

The kindergarten reading program was the first step in the Avery Coonley School's transition to a new focus on the education of the <a href="Intellectual%20giftedness">gifted</a>, which coincided with a growing public awareness of the needs of gifted children in the late 1960s. The increasing focus on gifted education was symbolized by the 1972 <a href="Marland%20report">Marland Report</a> to the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a>, which was the first acknowledgment of the characteristics of gifted children and their specific educational needs. The report found that "gifted children are, in fact, deprived and can suffer psychological damage and permanent impairment of their abilities to function well which is equal to or greater than the similar deprivation suffered by any other population with special needs". The report highlighted the necessity for educational services for the gifted, and the near total lack of such programs in the public schools at the time. Malach believed that the educational philosophy of Avery Coonley was well aligned with the most important objectives of a gifted program, namely, "the stimulation of individual interests ... the development of student initiative, the development of self-acceptance, concept development, and recognition of the early ability to undertake complex learning tasks."

In 1960, ACS began screening applicants for high intellectual potential, requiring a tested <a href="Intelligence%20quotient">IQ</a> above 120, achievement test results one and a half grade levels above national norms in reading and math, and intensive in-person evaluations. At the same time, the teachers began adapting the curriculum to meet the goals of a gifted program, allowing even more <a href="differentiated%20instruction">differentiation</a> for each student, accommodating different learning styles, and incorporating enough flexibility for all students to progress at their own pace.

More accelerated classes were added, but the core of the gifted curriculum remained the individualized approaches and learning by doing that had long been central to the Avery Coonley curriculum. Nature study was still prominent in the student's activities, with music, art, and drama. The traditional learning themes and school projects involving maple trees, Native Americans, ancient Egypt and other topics were preserved but adapted to serve the gifted curriculum. In early 1980, an early childhood (EC) program for three-year-olds was launched, designed to cater to the needs of gifted preschool children and prepare them to transition from home to kindergarten. Again departing from the prevailing educational theory, Avery Coonley introduced academics in the EC program, with the same focus on nature, music, movement, and practical skills as the higher grades.

The campus occupies off of Maple Avenue in Downers Grove. It borders the Maple Grove Forest Preserve, created in 1919, one of the oldest forest preserves in the <a href="Forest%20Preserve%20District%20of%20DuPage%20County">Forest Preserve District of DuPage County</a> system. The preserve protects "the largest remaining remnant of the vast maple forest that became Downers Grove", and has been categorized a globally endangered <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>. Its <a href="black%20maple">black maple</a> and upland <a href="sugar%20maple">sugar maple</a> communities are host to many threatened and endangered plant species, and bloom with <a href="trillium">trillium</a>, <a href="Erythronium">trout lilies</a>, <a href="viola">violets</a>, <a href="Ranunculus">buttercups</a>, and <a href="Pelargonium">wild geraniums</a> in the spring. The forest is a refuge for a wide range of birds, including <a href="Bubo%20virginianus">Great Horned Owls</a> and several species of <a href="Accipitridae">hawks</a>, as well as a stopover for several species of migratory birds, including the <a href="Passerina%20cyanea">Indigo Bunting</a>, which nests there during the warm breeding season and migrates south by night in the winter. A hiking trail winds through the preserve, crossing a small creek and passing a nearby pond. The preserve is used by students in their science and nature activities.

The designer of the grounds, <a href="Jens%20Jensen%20%28landscape%20architect%29">Jens Jensen</a>, was known as the "dean of the world's landscape architects", and "the father of the Chicago park system", for his creation of <a href="Humboldt%20Park%20%28Chicago%20park%29">Humboldt Park</a>, <a href="Garfield%20Park%20%28Chicago%20park%29">Garfield Park</a>, the <a href="Cook%20County%20Forest%20Preserves">Cook County Forest Preserves</a>, and his masterpiece, <a href="Columbus%20Park%20%28Chicago%29">Columbus Park</a>, in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. Jensen's work became famous for his exclusive use of plants and materials native to the local region, and was characterized by his use of open spaces, flowing water, gently curving lines, and "council rings", or low circular benches where people can gather. All of these features are evident on the Avery Coonley campus, which makes use of wholly natural settings in lieu of formal gardens. The original landscaping was largely forgotten over the years and poorly maintained. A complete restoration of Jensen's landscape design was completed in 2006 as part of the ACS centennial celebration.

The building was designed by Coonley's son-in-law Waldron Faulkner, who, with his son (also an architect) Avery Coonley Faulkner, later became significant contributors to the design of <a href="George%20Washington%20University">George Washington University</a> and <a href="American%20University">American University</a> in Washington, D.C. The design ties the building to the land in the style of the Prairie School, at the same time employing the handcrafted features and human scale typical of the American <a href="Arts%20and%20Crafts%20Movement">Arts and Crafts</a> (or <a href="American%20Craftsman">American Craftsman</a>) style. The easy access to the outdoors, ground floor classrooms, separate science laboratories, and planned outdoor play area are among the features of the design that would later be adopted by schools throughout the US after World War II.

The building surrounds a courtyard with a large reflecting pool. The classrooms are oriented outward, to provide views of the surrounding forest. There are no interior passages in this part of the building; each class area has an exit to the outside, and students pass between rooms via the covered cloister, even in inclement weather. The design is meant to reinforce the "home and school" atmosphere that dates back to the Cottage School, with child-sized classrooms, ten working fireplaces, draperies, and other home-like details.

Decorative tiles designed by <a href="Henry%20Chapman%20Mercer">Henry Chapman Mercer</a>—one of the leading figures of the Arts and Crafts Movement in the U.S.—are placed throughout the building. These tiles (known as Moravian tiles after Mercer's <a href="Moravian%20Pottery%20and%20Tile%20Works">Moravian Pottery and Tile Works</a>) feature deep colors and a handmade appearance that complement the simple brick buildings. The tiles on the fireplaces and entry floors boast patterns in literary and educational themes, such as "<a href="The%20Canterbury%20Tales">The Canterbury Tales</a>" in the old library. A large, tripartite tile mural on the north wall of the courtyard, also by Mercer, depicts the eastern and western hemispheres united by a ship on an allegorical journey of education.

In 1970, exploring new designs in school furniture, the Institute for Educational Research worked with the Design Department of <a href="Southern%20Illinois%20University">Southern Illinois University</a> to create a series of interconnected <a href="truncated%20octahedron">truncated octahedron</a>s known as "learning spaces", which resembled an oversized beehive. Each child had his or her own semi-private space with a fold-down seat, reading light, and bookshelf. The goal was to provide private spaces where third grade (eight-year-old) children could develop good study habits, and the school found that the children spent 90 percent of their work time in their learning spaces. The structures were featured in local news stories and in "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine. ACS patented the invention and sold models to several local schools. The original structures are still in use in the third grade classroom in 2014.

The Avery Coonley School was designated a historical site by the Downers Grove Historical Society in 2006, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007, which cited the educational program along with the building and grounds for their "unique design and features that have exerted a long-lasting influence on schools throughout the country".

A new wing was added in early 1980 to provide additional space for the arts, with a large room for orchestra and music and another for studio art. Filling in the previously open east side of the courtyard, the design is nearly identical in design to the original school, built of red and white-washed brick with a cloister on the courtyard side. The Gatehouse, which was built in 1929 and had served as the headmaster's residence, was remodeled to house the early childhood program in 1988.

Increased enrollment in the late 1980s and the need for more space led to another addition in 1992. This addition included a new 17,500-volume library, a 16-station computer lab, and a 236-seat Performing Arts Center (PAC). Moravian tiles around the new foyer fireplace and library doors pay homage to the original building. The PAC "is known for its excellent acoustics", and hosts student productions and outside artistic groups, including the Beck Institute for the Arts, which stages musical recitals there.

Avery Coonley added a full-day kindergarten program in 2005, again requiring more space, and a $4 million, middle school wing was constructed, financed through tax-exempt bonds from the Village of Downers Grove. Its cream and red bricks, hipped roof, deep eaves, and detailed brickwork harmonize with the style of the earlier building. The project added modernized math and science labs, two computer labs, and seven <a href="Wi-Fi">wireless</a> classrooms using <a href="tablet%20computer">tablet computer</a> technology, videoconferencing, and computer controlled overhead projectors.

The founding educational philosophy is still evident in the modern day curriculum in the focus on learning by doing, teaching based on broad themes that cross subjects, an emphasis on collaborative projects, and a de-emphasis of textbooks. There remains a close integration of art and nature in daily activities and a focus on the development of social skills and education for social responsibility. These principles, adapted in the 1970s for gifted students, have been further extended to accommodate new developments in technology and educational research.

ACS refers to grade levels as groups, a practice rooted in progressive education that dates back at least to the Junior Elementary School. There are three divisions of students: the early school, which includes the early childhood Program (EC) for three-year-olds and junior kindergarten (JK) for four-year-olds; the lower school for kindergarten through group four, and middle school for groups five through eight. Each class in kindergarten through group eight has 32 students. Each lower school class is team taught by two teachers. The student-to-teacher ratio in the lower and middle school is 16 to 1, 11 to 1 in kindergarten, 8 to 1 in junior kindergarten, and 7 to 1 in the early childhood program.

As of 2009, the curriculum is <a href="Academic%20acceleration">accelerated</a> for each group, which is separated by grade and age; students are instructed a minimum of one year above their current grade level. (For example, the first group is taught at a second grade level.) Students are grouped within their class to allow each of them work at the level of their ability, and they may work several years beyond their current level if they can do so. Students may join older groups to study subjects, which they are exceptionally advanced; however, age groups are usually kept together "for social and emotional values". All middle school students complete a high school level <a href="honors%20course">honors course</a> in mathematics in either algebra or geometry.

Students explore broad learning themes at each level that allow them to learn across subjects and engage them in creative and collaborative projects. The second group, for example, spends much of their year on the study of trees, using trees as a focus for biology, mathematics, art, and creative writing. Students adopt and study a personal space in the nearby forest preserve. The year culminates with the tapping of maple trees to make syrup, which they share with the rest of the school. Each group engages different themes and group projects. Lower school students simulate an airplane flight to Paris and host a Japanese luncheon. The fourth group holds a Native American Fair, the fifth group creates an original Egyptian style <a href="mastaba">mastaba</a>, the sixth group presents a World's Fair, and the eighth group organizes an Immigration and Ethnic Fair.

Science studies are enhanced by nature and outdoor experiences. Students participate in nature programs sponsored by the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County and the <a href="Illinois%20Department%20of%20Natural%20Resources">Illinois Department of Natural Resources</a>, such as adopting a "Bass in the Class", and monitoring the growth of <a href="invertebrate">macroinvertebrates</a> in the <a href="DuPage%20River">DuPage River</a>. Competition in regional and state science fairs and <a href="Science%20Olympiad">Science Olympiad</a> is considered an integral part of the science program. All students are strongly encouraged to participate, and the seventh group students are required to do so.

All students study French, which is taught by <a href="language%20immersion">language immersion</a>, a technique in which they only speak French during language study. All signs in the building are written in both French and English. Students begin French instruction in junior kindergarten, and continue on to study French four times a week in groups one through eight. They culminate their study with a week-long experience in <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a> in group eight, during which they only speak French.

Visual art study begins with drawing and painting and then advances to more complex techniques such as sculpture, stained glass, architecture, photography, and pottery. Students learn in a variety of media, including watercolor, oil pastels, charcoal, and clay. Music study begins in the early childhood program. As they progress, Avery Coonley students participate in vocal music, playing <a href="Orff%20Schulwerk%23Instruments%20and%20tools">Orff instruments</a> and recorders, dancing, and public performance. In middle school, students develop music literacy by reading and writing music, playing choir chimes, and choral singing. The study of music in culture and the history of jazz and opera are taught alongside theory and performance.

The drama program begins in acting and dramatic writing, directing, and the technical arts in the fourth group. Students practice both rehearsed and improvised performances to create pantomimes, monologues, films, and short plays. Their theatrical work culminates in the eighth group with the performance of one-act plays the students write and direct themselves and the production of a professionally scripted full-length play. Artistically inclined students can extend their arts studies outside of class in optional activities including Art Club, Chorus, Orchestra, Tech Club, Drama Club, and the Variety Show.

Avery Coonley began using computers for instruction in 1971 and offering computer programming to students as young as the fourth group in 1976. Desktop computers were brought into the classrooms to teach math, language arts, music, art, and computer programming, in 1978. Students begin learning basic keyboard and mouse skills in kindergarten and progress to multimedia presentations, data management, and software coding in the eighth group.

In what ACS calls "one-to-one computing", every student in the fifth group through the eighth group receives a tablet computer, which they use to manage their daily schedules, work on class assignments, and prepare special projects. Students in early childhood and junior kindergarten have shared tablets available, and each kindergarten through the fourth group class has at least four. Students study in classrooms equipped with wireless overhead projectors, manipulate programs and presentations on <a href="touchscreen">touchscreen</a>-equipped <a href="Smart%20Board">SMART board systems</a>, and engage in self-paced classroom learning using ActiveExpression wireless response systems. Students, teachers, and parents communicate and interact online via a school-wide <a href="intranet">intranet</a> and an <a href="extranet">extranet</a> for parents. Sixteen dual platform <a href="iMac">iMac</a>s were added in 2009 for computer lab work.
A hallmark of the curriculum in the earliest days was study organized around major themes—trees, Shakespeare, Egypt and other subjects—that built over the school year into major class projects, performances, and all-school gatherings. Many of these themes and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple trees to make syrup, began with the move to the new building in 1929. The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and perform their own dance, has been held annually since the 1930s—the <a href="Maypole">Maypole</a> dance by the fifth group dates back to the beginning of the Cottage School.

The annual third group overnight nature trip to <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, dates back to 1974, and the eighth group French immersion trip began in the 1970s with trips to Paris and since the mid-1990s to Quebec. Other lower school traditions, such as the Native American Fair and class visit to the Coonley Estate, also have a long history at Avery Coonley. Middle school traditions include the alternating annual Greek and <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> Fests, the sixth group World's Fair, and a seventh group trip to <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington, DC</a>.

In the annual <a href="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> Program, the students, in identical brown capes, silently construct a large <a href="cornucopia">cornucopia</a> of fruits and vegetables in a ceremony choreographed to music prepared by each class. The food is later donated to the <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a>. It is the most treasured of the school traditions, and has been performed every year, virtually unchanged, since 1929.

Many of the extracurricular activities offered at ACS offer an extension of classroom subjects and an opportunity for students to pursue those studies in additional depth. Within the arts program, chorus, creative writing, drama, art, and three levels of orchestra are offered as optional activities. Students in these groups have opportunities to perform and exhibit their work throughout the year. The Book Club is available to students in groups six and above to extend the reading program. Computer Club, Creative Writing Club, Art Club, French Film Club, and Drama Club also offer opportunities to build on classroom activities.

Student Council is primarily a service organization, which organizes charitable fund raising and community service opportunities in which all students can participate. Two representatives are elected from each group, one through eight, for each school year. Students may also volunteer for the Annual staff, which edits and produces the yearbook, "Reflections".

<a href="Intramural%20sports">Intramural sports</a> are offered to students in group five and interscholastic sports are available in groups five through eight. ACS competes in the West DuPage Elementary School Association (WDESA) Conference. Team sports include co-ed <a href="soccer">soccer</a> and girls' <a href="volleyball">volleyball</a> in the fall, boys' and girls' <a href="basketball">basketball</a> in the winter, and co-ed <a href="track%20and%20field%20athletics">track</a> in the spring. There are no team tryouts and all students are free to participate.

ACS students participate actively in academic competitions at the state and national level, including <a href="MATHCOUNTS">MATHCOUNTS</a>, Science Olympiad, and other math and science competitions, as well spelling bees, geography bees, and contests in other subjects. The Chess Club competes locally, and won the first-place trophy in the Naperville Chess Tournament in 2009.

Admission is competitive and decisions are based on evaluations of applicants' intellectual ability, social and emotional maturity, and readiness for the accelerated program of study. Applicants for kindergarten through eighth group must submit IQ test results at or above the 95th percentile (at or above 124 on the <a href="Wechsler%20Preschool%20and%20Primary%20Scale%20of%20Intelligence">Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence</a> (WPPSI) or <a href="Wechsler%20Intelligence%20Scale%20for%20Children">Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children</a> (WISC)), with consistent subtest scores, to qualify for consideration. Evaluations are based on report cards, parent questionnaires, teacher recommendations, and in-person assessments by the faculty. Early childhood through kindergarten applicants are screened in one-hour play sessions. Applicants for groups one and two are invited for a half-day school visit, and older applicants for an entire day, where they are assessed by teachers in the actual classroom setting.

Avery Coonley serves 378 students aged 3 through 14 as of 2010, with a nearly even ratio of males to females in each grade. ACS seeks to achieve ethnic diversity in every group, and offers limited need-based aid to families of children who would otherwise be unable to attend. The student body is "primarily middle- and upper-class white suburban children", and students "come from some of the most affluent families" in Chicago's western suburbs, but thirty percent of the students are non-white.

Tuition for kindergarten through group eight was $23,950, junior kindergarten was $11,700, and early childhood $6,200 in 2018. The Annual Giving Fund makes up 3.5 percent and the Annual Auction another 5 percent of the operating budget ($5.9 million in 2008–2009).

"Avery Coonley reports that scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, an exam given in schools across the United States, are in the top 1 percent in the nation", with average scores of 99 in all eight grades and all four test sections (vocabulary, comprehension, language arts, and mathematics). Avery Coonley was one of seventeen Illinois schools recognized as a <a href="Blue%20Ribbon%20Schools%20Program">Blue Ribbon School</a> by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Education">United States Department of Education</a> in 1987–88 for "excellence in student success, school philosophy, curriculum, leadership, and climate". Over five percent of Avery Coonley graduates since 1989 have been admitted to the nationally recognized <a href="Illinois%20Math%20and%20Science%20Academy">Illinois Math and Science Academy</a> (IMSA), Illinois' public, competitive-entry, boarding school for top math and science students.

Avery Coonley students have a record of top honors at the state and national level in science, math, geography and other subjects stretching back as far as 1989. In recent competitions, students won 24 Gold Medals at the 2009 Illinois Junior Academy of Science (IJAS) Science Fair, and won the Science Olympiad Jr. High State Championship. Avery Coonley won the 2009 IMSA Junior High Mathematics Competition (with four out of five first place awards) and placed second in the 2009 Illinois State MATHCOUNTS competition. In 2008, a seventh group student placed in the top 0.2 percent of competitors from around the world with a perfect score in the 24th annual <a href="American%20Mathematics%20Competitions">American Mathematics Contest</a>.

In 2009, the seventh and eighth group Social Studies teams both placed third in the nation at the National Social Studies League contest and an ACS student won the Illinois Geography Bee, The same year, two eighth group students received perfect scores on "Le Grand Concours"—the National French Contest of the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20Teachers%20of%20French">American Association of Teachers of French</a>. Of the 40 Avery Coonley students who took "Le Grand Concours", 32 placed in the top ten in the nation at their grade level. Avery Coonley third group students "won highest honors in the WordMasters Challenge, a national language arts competition" in 2007, placing eighth in the nation out of more than 200 teams.

Controversy erupted in 1994, when ACS won the Illinois State Science Fair team competition for the fourth year in a row, prompting the IJAS "to banish the school from team competition for [the] next year, on the grounds that their students were 'just too good. The incident attracted national attention and was decried as an example of the "dumbing down" of education and the victory of self-esteem over excellence in schools. The IJAS relented under pressure from the media, but eliminated the team competition altogether in future years. Avery Coonley students won 24 top individual awards the following year.

Norton Priory

Norton Priory is a historic site in <a href="Norton%2C%20Runcorn">Norton</a>, <a href="Runcorn">Runcorn</a>, <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, England, comprising the remains of an <a href="abbey">abbey</a> complex dating from the 12th to 16th centuries, and an 18th-century country house; it is now a museum. The remains are a <a href="scheduled%20ancient%20monument">scheduled ancient monument</a> and are recorded in the <a href="National%20Heritage%20List%20for%20England">National Heritage List for England</a> as a designated Grade I <a href="Listed%20building%23England%20and%20Wales">listed building</a>. They are considered to be the most important monastic remains in Cheshire.

The <a href="priory">priory</a> was established as an <a href="Augustinian">Augustinian</a> foundation in the 12th century, and was raised to the status of an abbey in 1391. The abbey was closed in 1536, as part of the <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20monasteries">dissolution of the monasteries</a>. Nine years later the surviving structures, together with the <a href="Manorialism">manor</a> of Norton, were purchased by Sir <a href="Richard%20Brooke%20%28Norton%29">Richard Brooke</a>, who built a <a href="Tudor%20style%20architecture">Tudor</a> house on the site, incorporating part of the abbey. This was replaced in the 18th century by a <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> house. The Brooke family left the house in 1921, and it was partially demolished in 1928. In 1966 the site was given in trust for the use of the general public.

Excavation of the site began in 1971, and became the largest to be carried out by modern methods on any European monastic site. It revealed the foundations and lower parts of the walls of the monastery buildings and the abbey church. Important finds included: a <a href="Norman%20architecture">Norman</a> doorway; a finely carved <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcade</a>; a floor of <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a> tiles, the largest floor area of this type to be found in any modern excavation; the remains of the <a href="kiln">kiln</a> where the tiles were fired; a <a href="Bellfounding">bell casting pit</a> used for casting the bell; and a large medieval <a href="Statue%20of%20St%20Christopher%20%28Norton%20Priory%29">statue of Saint Christopher</a>.

The site was opened to the public in the 1970s. It includes a museum, the excavated ruins, and the surrounding garden and woodland. In 1984 the separate <a href="walled%20garden">walled garden</a> was redesigned and opened to the public. Norton Priory is now a visitor attraction, and the museum trust organises a programme of events, exhibitions, educational courses, and outreach projects. In August 2016, a larger and much extended museum opened.

In 1115 a community of <a href="Augustinian">Augustinian</a> <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canons</a> was founded in the <a href="burh">burh</a> of <a href="Runcorn">Runcorn</a> by <a href="William%20fitz%20Nigel%20%28d.%201134%29">William fitz Nigel</a>, the second <a href="List%20of%20Barons%20of%20Halton">Baron of Halton</a> and <a href="Constable">Constable</a> of <a href="Chester">Chester</a>, on the south bank of the <a href="River%20Mersey">River Mersey</a> where it narrows to form the <a href="River%20Mersey%23Runcorn%20Gap">Runcorn Gap</a>. This was the only practical site where the Mersey could be crossed between <a href="Warrington">Warrington</a> and <a href="Birkenhead">Birkenhead</a>, and the archaeologists Fraser Brown and Christine Howard-Davis consider it likely that the canons cared for travellers and pilgrims crossing the river. They also speculate that William may have sought to profit from the tolls paid by these travellers.

The <a href="priory">priory</a> was the second religious house to be founded in the <a href="Earl%20of%20Chester">Earldom of Chester</a>; the first was the <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> <a href="Chester%20Cathedral%23History">St Werburgh's Abbey</a> at <a href="Chester">Chester</a>, founded in 1093 by <a href="Hugh%20d%27Avranches%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Chester">Hugh Lupus</a>, the first <a href="Earl%20of%20Chester">Earl of Chester</a>. The priory at Runcorn had a double dedication, to <a href="St%20Bertelin">Saint Bertelin</a> and to <a href="Mother%20of%20Jesus">Saint Mary</a>. The authors of the "<a href="Victoria%20County%20History">Victoria County History</a>" suggest that the dedication to St Bertelin was taken from a <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20architecture">Saxon</a> church already existing on the site. In 1134 <a href="List%20of%20Barons%20of%20Halton%233%20William%20FitzWilliam">William fitz William</a>, the third Baron of Halton, moved the priory to a site in <a href="Norton%2C%20Runcorn">Norton</a>, a village to the east of Runcorn. The reasons for the move are uncertain. It may have been that fitz William wanted greater control of the strategic crossing of the Mersey at Runcorn Gap, or it may have been because the canons wanted a more secluded site. Nothing remains of the site of the original priory in Runcorn.
The site for the new priory was in damp, scrubby woodland. There is no evidence that it was agricultural land, or that it contained any earlier buildings. The first priority was to clear and drain the land. There were freshwater springs near the site, and these would have provided fresh running water for latrines and domestic purposes. They would also have been used to create watercourses and <a href="moat">moat</a>ed enclosures, some of which might have been used for orchards and herb gardens. <a href="Sandstone">Sandstone</a> for building the priory was available at an outcrop nearby, sand for mortar could be obtained from the shores of the River Mersey, and <a href="boulder%20clay">boulder clay</a> on the site provided material for floor and roof tiles.

Excavation has revealed remnants of oak, some of it from trees hundreds of years old. It is likely that this came from various sources; some from nearby, and some donated from the forests at <a href="Forests%20of%20Mara%20and%20Mondrem">Delamere</a> and <a href="Macclesfield%20Forest">Macclesfield</a>. The church and monastic buildings were constructed in <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> style.

The priory was endowed by William fitz Nigel with properties in <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, <a href="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a>, <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a> and <a href="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>, including the churches of <a href="St%20Mary%20and%20All%20Saints%20Church%2C%20Great%20Budworth">St Mary, Great Budworth</a> and <a href="St%20Michael%27s%20Church%2C%20Chester">St Michael, Chester</a>. By 1195 the priory owned eight churches, five houses, the <a href="Tithe%23Tithing%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">tithe</a> of at least eight mills, the rights of <a href="Common%20land">common</a> in four townships, and one-tenth of the profits from the Runcorn ferry. The prior supplied the chaplain to the hereditary Constables of Chester and to the Barons of Halton.

During the 12th century, the main benefactors of the priory were the Barons of Halton, but after 1200 their gifts reduced, mainly because they transferred their interests to the <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a> <a href="Stanlow%20Abbey">abbey at Stanlow</a>, which had been founded in 1178 by <a href="List%20of%20Barons%20of%20Halton%236%20John%20FitzRichard">John fitz Richard</a>, the sixth baron. Archaeologist <a href="J.%20Patrick%20Greene">J. Patrick Greene</a> states that it is unlikely that any of the Barons of Halton were buried in Norton Priory. The only members of the family known to be buried there are Richard, brother of <a href="List%20of%20Barons%20of%20Halton%237%20Roger%20de%20Lacy">Roger de Lacy</a>, the seventh baron, and a female named Alice. The identity of Alice has not been confirmed, but Greene considers that she was the niece of <a href="William%20de%20Warenne%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Surrey">William, Earl Warenne, the 5th Earl of Surrey</a> and therefore a relative of the Delacy family, who were at that time the Barons of Halton. The earl made a grant to the priory of 30 <a href="Shilling%20%28English%20coin%29">shillings</a> a year in order to "maintain a <a href="pittance">pittance</a> for her soul". As the role played by the Barons of Halton declined, so the importance of members of the Dutton family increased. The Duttons had been benefactors since the priory's foundation, and from the 13th century they became the principal benefactors. There were two main branches of the family, one in <a href="Dutton%2C%20Cheshire">Dutton</a> and the other in <a href="Sutton%20Weaver">Sutton Weaver</a>. The Dutton family had their own burial chapel in the priory, and burial in the chapel is specified in three wills made by members of the family. The Aston family of <a href="Aston-by-Sutton">Aston</a> were also important benefactors.

The priory buildings, including the church, were extended during the late 12th and early 13th centuries. It has been estimated that the original community would have consisted of 12 canons and the prior; this increased to around 26 members in the later part of the 12th century, making it one of the largest houses in the Augustinian order. By the end of the century the church had been lengthened, a new and larger <a href="chapter%20house">chapter house</a> had been built (I* on the plan), and a large chapel had been added to the east end of the church (N). In about 1200 the west front of the church was enlarged (M), a bell tower was built and guest quarters were constructed. It is possible that the chapel at the east end was built to accommodate the holy cross of Norton, a <a href="relic">relic</a> which was reputed to have miraculous healing powers. A fire in 1236 destroyed the timber-built kitchen (Q) and damaged the west range of the monastic buildings and the roof of the church. The kitchen was rebuilt and the other damage was rapidly repaired.

During the first half of the 14th century, the priory suffered from financial mismanagement and disputes with the Dutton family, exacerbated by a severe flood in 1331 that reduced the income from the priory's lands. The direct effects of the <a href="Black%20Death%20in%20England">Black Death</a> are not known, but during the 1350s financial problems continued. These were party mitigated with the selling of the <a href="advowson">advowson</a> of the church at <a href="Ratcliffe-on-Soar">Ratcliffe-on-Soar</a>. Matters further improved from 1366 with the appointment of Richard Wyche as prior. He was active in the governance of the wider Augustinian order and in political affairs, and in 1391 was involved in raising the priory's status to that of a mitred abbey. A mitred abbey was one in which the abbot was given permission to use <a href="Pontifical%20vestments">pontifical insignia</a>, including the <a href="mitre">mitre</a>, <a href="Ecclesiastical%20ring%23Episcopal%20rings">ring</a> and <a href="Crosier">pontifical staff</a>, and to give the solemn <a href="benediction">benediction</a> provided a <a href="bishop">bishop</a> was not present. It was rare for an Augustinian house to be elevated to this status. Out of about 200 Augustinian houses in England and Wales, 28 were abbeys and only seven of these became mitred. The only other mitred abbey in Cheshire was that of St Werburgh in Chester. In 1379 and in 1381 there were 15 canons at Norton and in 1401 there were 16, making it the largest Augustinian community in the northwest of England. By this time the barony of Halton had passed by a series of marriages to the <a href="duchy%20of%20Lancaster">duchy of Lancaster</a>. <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster">John of Gaunt</a>, the 1st Duke of Lancaster and 14th Baron of Halton, agreed to be the patron of the newly formed abbey. At this date the church was long; it was the second longest Augustinian church in northwest England, exceeded only by the long church at <a href="Carlisle%2C%20Cumbria">Carlisle</a>. Towards the end of the 14th century, the abbey acquired a "giant" <a href="St%20Christopher%2C%20Norton%20Priory">statue of Saint Christopher</a>. Three wills from members of the Dutton family from this period survive; they are dated 1392, 1442 and 1527, and in each will money was bequeathed to the foundation.

The abbey's fortunes went into decline after the death of Richard Wyche in 1400. Wyche was succeeded by his <a href="prior">prior</a>, John Shrewsbury, who "does not seem to have done more than keep the house in order". Frequent floods had reduced its income, and in 1429 the church and other abbey buildings were described as being "ruinous". Problems continued through the rest of the 15th century, resulting in the sale of more advowsons. By 1496 the number of canons had been reduced to nine, and to seven in 1524. In 1522 there were reports of disputes between the abbot and the prior. The abbot was accused of "wasting the house's resources, nepotism, relations with women" and other matters, while the prior admitted to "fornication and lapses in the observation of the <a href="Augustinians%23The%20Augustinian%20Rule">Rule</a>". The prior threatened the abbot with a knife, but then left the abbey. The physical state of the buildings continued to deteriorate.

The records of the priory and abbey have not survived, but the excavations and the study of other documents have produced evidence of how the monastic lands were managed. The principal source of income came from farming. This income was required not only for the building and upkeep of the property, but also for feeding the canons, their guests, and visiting pilgrims. The priory also had an obligation from its foundation to house travellers fording the Mersey. It has been estimated that nearly half of the <a href="demesne">demesne</a> lands were used for <a href="Agronomy">arable farming</a>. The grain grown on priory lands was ground by a local windmill and by a watermill outside the priory lands. Excavations revealed part of a stone handmill in the area used in the monastic kitchen. In addition to orchards and herb gardens in the moated enclosures, it is likely that beehives were maintained for the production of honey. There is evidence from bone fragments that cattle, sheep, pigs, geese and chickens were reared and consumed, but few bone fragments from deer, rabbits or hares have been discovered. Horseflesh was not eaten. Although few fish bones have been discovered, it is known from documentary evidence that the canons owned a number of local fisheries. The fuel used consisted of wood and <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a>, and <a href="Peat">turf</a> from marshes over which the priory had rights of <a href="turbary">turbary</a> (to cut turf).

The events in 1536 surrounding the fate of the abbey at the <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20monasteries">dissolution of the monasteries</a> are complicated, and included a dispute between Sir <a href="Piers%20Dutton">Piers Dutton</a>, who was in a powerful position as the <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Cheshire">Sheriff of Cheshire</a>, and Sir William Brereton, the deputy-chamberlain of Chester. Dutton's estate was next to that of the abbey, and Dutton plotted to gain some of its land from the Crown after the dissolution; while Brereton supported the abbot against Dutton and held the lucrative position of steward of the abbey. A campaign of vilification was directed at the canons, asserting that they were guilty of "debauched conduct". Then, in 1535, Dutton falsely accused the abbot and Brereton of issuing counterfeit coins. This charge was dismissed mainly because one of Dutton's witnesses was considered to be "unconvincing". Playing into Duttons' hands was the gross undervaluation of the abbey's assets as reported to the royal commissioners of the <a href="Valor%20Ecclesiasticus">Valor Ecclesiasticus</a> of 1535; as a result of which the net annual income of the abbey was recorded, falsely, as falling below the £200 () threshold that would subsequently be chosen for the first round of dissolutions in 1536, although whether this subterfuge was due to the machinations of Dutton or the abbot (or both) remains unclear. Brereton and the abbot appear to have attempted to have the dissolution cancelled subject to the payment of a fine, as was the case in large numbers of other houses in similar circumstances; but in the abbot's absence dissolution commissioners arrived unananounced at the abbey in early October 1536. There was considerable opposition, the commissioners being menaced by around 300 local people; for whom the abbot, rushing back, threw an impromptu feast complete with roasted ox. According to Dutton's account, after barricading themselves in a tower the commissioners managed to send a letter to Dutton, who arrived with a force of men in the middle of the night. Most of the rioters fled, but Dutton arrested the abbot and four of the canons, who were sent to <a href="Halton%20Castle">Halton Castle</a> and then to prison in Chester. Dutton sent a report of the events to <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a>; who demanded that if the abbot and canons had behaved as Dutton reported, they should be immediately executed as traitors. However, because the kings instructions had been conveyed by the Lord Chancellor in the form of letters to both Dutton and Brereton, the two faction leaders would be required to act together to effect them; with the consequence that Brereton was temporarily able to stall any such action by refusing to meet with Dutton. Events elsewhere in the country further delayed the execution and, following an intercession to <a href="Thomas%20Cromwell%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Essex">Thomas Cromwell</a> (whose own informal contacts had cast doubt on the reliability of Dutton's reports), the abbot and canons were discharged and awarded pensions. The abbey was made uninhabitable, the lead from the roof, the bell metal, and other valuable materials were confiscated for the king, and the building lay empty for nine years. The estate came into the ownership of the Crown, and it was managed by Brereton. From the evidence of damage to the tiled floor of the church, Brown and Howard-Davis conclude it is likely that the church was demolished at an early stage, but otherwise the archaeological evidence for this period is sparse and largely negative.

In 1545 the abbey and the manor of Norton were sold to Sir <a href="Richard%20Brooke%20%28Norton%29">Richard Brooke</a> for a little over £1,512 (). Brooke built a house in <a href="Tudor%20style%20architecture">Tudor</a> style, which became known as Norton Hall, using as its core the former abbot's lodgings and the west range of the monastic buildings. It is not certain which other monastic buildings remained when the abbey was bought by the Brookes; excavations suggest that the <a href="cloister">cloister</a>s were still present. A 17th-century sketch plan by one of the <a href="Randle%20Holme">Randle Holme</a> family shows that the gatehouse remained at that time, although almost all the church had been demolished. An engraving by the <a href="Samuel%20and%20Nathaniel%20Buck">Buck brothers</a> dated 1727 shows that little changed by the next century.

During the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> the house was attacked by a force of <a href="Cavalier">Royalists</a>. The Brookes were the first family in north Cheshire to declare allegiance to the <a href="Roundhead">Parliamentary</a> side. <a href="Halton%20Castle">Halton Castle</a> was a short distance away, and was held by <a href="John%20Savage%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Rivers">Earl Rivers</a> for the Royalists. In February 1643 a large force from the castle armed with cannon attacked the house, which was defended by only 80 men. Henry Brooke successfully defended the house, with only one man wounded, while the Royalists lost 16 men including their cannonier (gunner). They burnt two barns and plundered Brooke's tenants, but "returned home with shame and the hatred of the country".

At some time between 1727 and 1757 the Tudor house was demolished and replaced by a new house in <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> style. The house had an L-plan, the main wing facing west standing on the footprint of the Tudor house, with a south wing at right-angles to it. The ground floor of the west wing retained the former <a href="Vault%20%28architecture%29">vaulted</a> <a href="undercroft">undercroft</a> of the west range of the medieval abbey, and contained the kitchens and areas for the storage of wines and beers. The first floor was the <a href="piano%20nobile">piano nobile</a>, containing the main reception rooms. The west front was symmetrical, in three storeys, with a double flight of stairs leading up to the main entrance. Clearance of the other surviving remnants of the monastic buildings had started but the moated enclosures were still in existence at that time. A drawing dated 1770 shows that by then all these buildings and the moats had been cleared away, and the former fishponds were being used for pleasure boating. Between 1757 and the early 1770s modifications were made to the house, the main one being the addition of a north wing. According to the authors of the "<a href="Pevsner%20Architectural%20Guides">Buildings of England</a>" series, the architect responsible for this was <a href="James%20Wyatt">James Wyatt</a>. Also between 1757 and 1770, the Brooke family built a <a href="walled%20garden">walled garden</a> at a distance from the house to provide fruit, vegetables and flowers. The family also developed the woodland around the house, creating pathways, a stream-glade and a rock garden. Brick-built wine bins were added to the undercroft, developing it into a wine cellar, and <a href="barrel%20vault">barrel vault</a>ing was added to the former entrance hall to the abbey (which was known as the outer parlour), obscuring its <a href="arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcade</a>.

During the mid-18th century, Sir Richard Brooke was involved in a campaign to prevent the <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a> from being built through his estate. The Bridgewater Canal Extension Act had been passed in 1762, and it made allowances for limited disturbance to the Norton estate. However Sir Richard did not see the necessity for the canal and opposed its passing through his estate. In 1773 the canal was opened from <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> to Runcorn, except for across the estate, which meant that goods had to be unloaded and carted around it. Eventually Sir Richard capitulated, and the canal was completed throughout its length by March 1776.

By 1853 a service range had been added to the south wing of the house. In 1868 the external flight of stairs was removed from the west front and a new porch entrance was added to its ground floor. The entrance featured a <a href="Norman%20architecture">Norman</a> doorway that had been moved from elsewhere in the monastery; Greene believes that it probably formed the entrance from the west cloister walk into the <a href="nave">nave</a> of the church. An exact replica of this doorway was built and placed to the north of the Norman doorway, making a double entrance. The whole of the undercroft was radically restored, giving it a <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> theme, adding stained glass windows and a medieval-style fireplace. The ground to the south of the house was levelled and formal gardens were established.

During the 19th century the estate was again affected by transport projects. In 1804 the <a href="Runcorn%20to%20Latchford%20Canal">Runcorn to Latchford Canal</a> was opened, replacing the <a href="Mersey%20and%20Irwell%20Navigation">Mersey and Irwell Navigation</a>; this cut off the northern part of the estate, making it only accessible by a bridge. The <a href="Grand%20Junction%20Railway">Grand Junction Railway</a> was built across the estate in 1837, followed by the <a href="Chester-Manchester%20Line">Warrington and Chester Railway</a>, which opened in 1850; both of these lines affected the southeast part of the estate. In 1894, the Runcorn to Latchford Canal was replaced by the <a href="Manchester%20Ship%20Canal">Manchester Ship Canal</a>, and the northern part of the estate could only be accessed by a <a href="swing%20bridge">swing bridge</a>. The Brooke family left the house in 1921, and it was almost completely demolished in 1928. Rubble from the house was used in the foundations of a new chemical works. During the demolition, the undercroft was retained and roofed with a cap of concrete. In 1966 the current Sir Richard Brooke gave Norton Priory in trust for the benefit of the public.

In 1971 J. Patrick Greene was given a contract to carry out a six-month <a href="Excavation%20%28archaeology%29">excavation</a> for Runcorn Development Corporation as part of a plan to develop a park in the centre of Runcorn New Town. The site consisted of a area of fields and woods to the north of the <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a>. Greene's initial findings led to his being employed for a further 12 years to supervise a major excavation of the site. The buildings found included the Norman doorway with its <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> addition and three medieval rooms. Specialists were employed and local volunteers were recruited to assist with the excavation, while teams of supervised prisoners were used to perform some of the heavier work. The area excavated exceeded that at any European monastic site that used modern methods. The Development Corporation decided to create a museum on the site, and in 1975 Norton Priory Museum Trust was established.

In 1989 Greene published his book about the excavations entitled "Norton Priory: The Archaeology of a Medieval Religious House". Further work has been carried out, recording and analysing the archaeological findings. In 2008 Fraser Brown and Christine Howard-Davis published "Norton Priory: Monastery to Museum", in which the findings are described in more detail. Howard-Davis was largely responsible for the post-excavation assessment and for compiling a database for the artefacts and, with Brown, for their analysis.

The excavations have revealed information about the original priory buildings and grounds, and how they were subsequently modified. A series of ditches was found that would have provided a supply of fresh water and also a means for drainage of a relatively wet site. Evidence of the earliest temporary timber buildings in which the canons were originally housed was found in the form of 12th-century <a href="Posthole">post pits</a>. Norton Priory is one of few monastic sites to have produced evidence of temporary quarters. The remains of at least seven temporary buildings have been discovered. It is considered that the largest of these, because it had more substantial foundations than the others, was probably the <a href="timber%20framing">timber-framed</a> church; another was most likely the <a href="gatehouse">gatehouse</a>, and the other buildings provided accommodation for the canons and the senior <a href="Secularity">secular</a> craftsmen.

The earliest masonry building was the church, which was constructed on shallow foundations of <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> rubble and pebbles on <a href="boulder%20clay">boulder clay</a>. The walls were built in local red sandstone with <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a> faces and a rubble and <a href="Mortar%20%28masonry%29">mortar</a> core. The ground plan of the original church was <a href="cruciform">cruciform</a>, and consisted of a <a href="nave">nave</a> without <a href="aisle">aisle</a>s, a <a href="Choir%20%28architecture%29">choir</a> at the <a href="Crossing%20%28architecture%29">crossing</a> with a tower above it, a square-ended <a href="chancel">chancel</a>, and north and south <a href="transept">transept</a>s, each with an eastern chapel. The total length of the church was and the total length across the transepts was , giving a ratio of 2:1. The walls of the church were wide at the base, and the crossing tower was supported on four <a href="Pier%20%28architecture%29">piers</a>.

The other early buildings were built surrounding a <a href="cloister">cloister</a> to the south of the church. The east range incorporated the <a href="chapter%20house">chapter house</a> and also contained the <a href="sacristy">sacristy</a>, the canons' dormitory and the <a href="reredorter">reredorter</a>. The upper storey of the west range provided living accommodation for the prior and an area where secular visitors could be received. In the lower storey was the undercroft where food and fuel were stored. The south range contained the <a href="refectory">refectory</a>, and at a distance from the south range stood the kitchen. Evidence of a <a href="Church%20bell">bell</a> <a href="foundry">foundry</a> dating from this period was found to the north of the church. It is likely that this was used for <a href="casting">casting</a> a tenor bell. A few moulded stones from this early period were found. These included nine blocks that probably formed part of a <a href="Corbel%23Corbel%20tables">corbel table</a>. There were also two beak-head <a href="voussoir">voussoir</a>s; this type of voussoir is rare in Cheshire, and has been found in only one other church in the county.

Considerable expansion occurred during the last two decades of the 12th century and the first two or three decades of the 13th century. The south and west ranges were demolished and rebuilt, enlarging the cloister from about by to about by . This meant that a door in the south wall of the church had to be blocked off and a new highly decorated doorway was built at the northeast corner of the cloister; this doorway has survived. The lower storey of the west range, the other standing remains of the priory, also dates from this period; it comprises the <a href="Obedientiaries">cellarer's</a> undercroft and a passage to its north, known as the outer parlour. The outer parlour had been the entrance to the priory from the outside world, and was "sumptuously decorated" so that "the power and wealth of the priory could be displayed in tangible fashion to those coming from the secular world". The undercroft, used for storage, was divided into two chambers, and its decoration was much plainer. The upper floor has been lost; it is considered that this contained the prior's living quarters and, possibly, a chapel over the outer parlour. A new and larger reredorter was built at the end of the east range, and it is believed that work might have started on a new chapter house. A system of stone drains was constructed to replace the previous open ditches. The west wall of the church was demolished and replaced by a more massive structure, thick at the base. The east wall was also demolished and the chancel was extended, forming an additional area measuring approximately by .

The excavation revealed evidence of the fire of 1236, including ash, charcoal, burnt planks and a burnt wooden bowl. It is thought that the fire probably started in the timber-built kitchens at the junction of the west and south ranges, and then spread to the monastic buildings and church. Most of the wood in the buildings, including the furnishings and roofs, would have been destroyed, although the masonry walls remained largely intact. The major repairs required gave an opportunity for the extension of the church by the addition of new chapels to both of the transepts, and its refurbishment in a manner even grander than previously. The cloister had been badly damaged in the fire and its arcade was rebuilt on the previous foundations. The new arcade was of "very high quality and finely wrought construction". Brown and Howard-Davis state that the kitchens were rebuilt on the same site and it appears that they were rebuilt in timber yet again. Excavations have found evidence of a second bell foundry in the northwest of the priory grounds. The date of this is uncertain but Greene suggests that it was built to cast a new bell to replace the original one that was damaged in the fire. Later in the 13th century another chapel was added to the north transept. Accommodation for guests was constructed to the southwest of the monastic buildings.

In the later part of the 13th century and during the following century the chapel in the south transept was replaced by a grander two-chambered chapel. This balanced the enlarged chapels in the north transept, restoring the church's cruciform plan. Around this time the east end of the church was further extended when a <a href="reliquary">reliquary</a> chapel was added measuring about by . A guest hall was built to the west of the earlier guest quarters. After the status of the foundation was elevated from a priory to an abbey, a <a href="tower%20house">tower house</a> was added to the west range. This is shown on the engraving by the Buck brothers, but it has left little in the way of archaeological remains. The church was extended by the addition of a north <a href="aisle">aisle</a>. There is little evidence of later major alterations before the dissolution. There is evidence to suggest that the cloister was rebuilt, and that alterations were made to the east range.

The excavations revealed information about the burials carried out within the church and the monastic buildings, and in the surrounding grounds. They are considered to be "either those of Augustinian canons, privileged members of their lay household, or of important members of the Dutton family". Most burials were in stone coffins or in wooden coffins with stone lids, and had been carried out from the late 12th century up to the time of the dissolution. The site of the burial depended on the status of the individual, whether they were clerical or lay, and their degree of importance. Priors, abbots, and high-ranking canons were buried within the church, with those towards the east end of the church being the most important. Other canons were buried in a graveyard outside the church, in an area to the south and east of the chancel. Members of the laity were buried either in the church, towards the west end of the nave or in the north aisle, or outside the church around its west end. It is possible that there was a lay cemetery to the north and west of the church. The addition of the chapels to the north transept, and their expansion, was carried out for the Dutton family, making it their burial chapel, or family <a href="mausoleum">mausoleum</a>, and the highest concentration of burials was found in this part of the church. It is considered that the north aisle, built after the priory became an abbey, was added to provide a burial place for members of the laity.

The excavations revealed 49 stone coffins, 30 coffin lids, and five headstones. Twelve of the lids were carved in <a href="Relief">high relief</a>, with designs including flowers or foliage. One lid depicts an oak tree issuing from a human head in the style of a <a href="green%20man">green man</a>, another has a cross, a dragon and a female <a href="effigy">effigy</a>, while others have shield and sword motifs. Two contain inscriptions in Norman-French, identifying the deceased. The remaining lids have simpler incised patterns, mainly decorated crosses. The headstones contain crosses. Most of the coffins were sunk into the ground, with the lid at the level of the floor, although a few were found within the walls. Only three stone coffins for children were discovered. These lay in a group, together with a coffin containing a male skeleton, in the vestibule leading to the enlarged chapter house. The most prestigious type of coffin was tapered towards the feet, with the head end carved externally to a hemi-hexagonal shape. Another sign of higher status was the provision of an internal "pillow" for the head.

A total of 144 graves was excavated; they contained 130 articulated skeletons in a suitable condition for examination. Of these, 36 were well-preserved, 48 were in a fair condition and 46 were poorly preserved. Males out-numbered females by a ratio of three to one, an expected ratio in a monastic site. Most of the males had survived into middle age (36–45 years) to old age (46 years or older), while equal numbers of females died before and after the age of about 45 years. One female death was presumably due to a complication of pregnancy as she had been carrying a 34-week <a href="Fetus">foetus</a>. The average height of the adult males was and that of the adult females was .

The bones show a variety of diseases and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of <a href="Paget%27s%20disease%20of%20bone">Paget's disease of bone</a> ("osteitis deformans"). The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a <a href="knight">knight</a>. One skeleton showed signs of <a href="leprosy">leprosy</a> affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major <a href="congenital%20abnormality">congenital abnormality</a> found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of <a href="Down%20syndrome">Down's syndrome</a>. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19 skeletons, ten of which were cases of "<a href="Spina%20bifida%23Spina%20bifida%20occulta">spina bifida occulta</a>". Other spinal abnormalities included fused <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e, <a href="spondylolysis">spondylolysis</a> and <a href="Congenital%20vertebral%20anomaly%23Transitional%20vertebrae">transitional vertebrae</a>. Definite evidence of <a href="Bone%20fracture">fractured bones</a> was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases. One cranium contained a large circular lesion which may have been the consequence of <a href="trepanning">trepanning</a>. Other diseases specific to bones and joints were <a href="osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</a>, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of <a href="spondyloarthropathy">spondyloarthropathy</a>. Three skeletons showed possible evidence of <a href="rickets">rickets</a>, two had changes of <a href="osteoporosis">osteoporosis</a>, and three crania had features of "hyperostosis frontalis interna", a <a href="Metabolism">metabolic</a> condition affecting post-<a href="Menopause">menopausal</a> women. <a href="Osteoma">Osteoma</a>ta (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.

Examination of the jaws and teeth gave information about the dental health of those buried in the priory. The degree of wear of teeth was greater than it is at present, while the incidence of <a href="dental%20caries">dental caries</a> was much lower than it is now, as was the incidence of <a href="periodontal%20disease">periodontal disease</a>. A consequence of the wear of the teeth was "compensatory eruption" of the teeth in order to keep contact with the opposing teeth. It was concluded that the people buried in the priory had few problems with their teeth or jaws. Loss of teeth was due to wear of the teeth, rather than from caries or periodontal disease.

Little archaeological evidence relates to the period immediately after the dissolution, or to the Tudor house built on part of the site. A <a href="Saw%20pit">sawpit</a> was found in the outer courtyard. It is considered that this might date from the early period of the Brookes' house, or it may have been constructed during the later years of the abbey. The kitchens to the south of the Tudor house and their drainage systems appear to have been used by the Brookes, and according to Brown and Howard-Davis, were possibly rebuilt by the family. The areas previously occupied by the cloisters and the guest quarters were probably used as <a href="midden">midden</a>s. Few archaeological findings remain from the Georgian house, apart from a fragment of a wall from the south front, and the foundations of the north wing. The much-altered medieval undercroft still stands, with its Norman doorway and Victorian replica, barrel vaulting, wine bins, and blind arcading in the former outer parlour.

A large number of tiles and tile fragments that had lined the floor of the church and some of the monastic buildings were found in the excavations. The oldest tiles date from the early 14th century. The total area of tiles discovered was about , and is "the largest area of a floor of this type to be found in any modern excavation". The site has "the largest, and most varied, excavated collection of medieval tiles in the North West" and "the greatest variety of individual mosaic shapes found anywhere in Britain". The tiles found made a <a href="Pavement%20%28architecture%29">pavement</a> forming the floor of the choir of the church and the transepts. The chancel floor was probably also tiled; these tiles have not survived because the chancel was at a higher level than the rest of the church, and the tiles would have been removed during subsequent gardening. A dump of tiles to the south of the site of the chapter house suggests that this was also tiled. In the 15th century a second tile floor was laid on top of the original floor in the choir where it had become worn. The tiles on the original floor were of various shapes, forming a <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a>. The tiles were all <a href="Ceramic%20glaze">glazed</a> and coloured, the main colours being black, green and yellow. Many of them had been decorated by impressing a wooden stamp into the moist clay before it was fired; these are known as line-impressed tiles. The line-impressed designs included masks of lions or other animals, rosettes, and <a href="trefoil">trefoil</a>s. Other tiles or tile fragments showed portions of trees, foliage, birds and inscriptions. In the chapels of the north transept, the burial place of the Dutton family, were tiles depicting <a href="Mail%20%28armour%29">mail</a>, thought to be part of a military <a href="effigy">effigy</a>, and tiles bearing fragments of <a href="Heraldry">heraldic</a> designs. The tiles from the upper (later) pavement were all square, and again were line-inscribed with patterns forming parts of larger designs. A related discovery at the excavation was the <a href="kiln">kiln</a> in which most of the tiles on the site were fired.

The excavations also revealed stones or fragments of carved stone dating from the 12th to the 16th centuries. The earliest are in <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> style and include two <a href="voussoir">voussoir</a>s decorated with beakheads (grotesque animal heads with long pointed bird-like beaks). Other stones dating from the 12th century are in <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> style; they include a <a href="Capital%20%28architecture%29">capital</a> decorated with leaves and a portion of the <a href="tracery">tracery</a> from a <a href="rose%20window">rose window</a>. Many of the stones from the 13th century were originally part of the cloister arcade, and had been re-used to form the core of a later cloister arcade. They include stones sculpted with depictions of humans and animals. The best preserved of these are the heads of two canons, each wearing a <a href="cowl">cowl</a> with the <a href="tonsure">tonsure</a> visible, the head of a woman with shoulder-length hair, parts of a seated figure holding an open book, and a creature that might represent a <a href="Serpent%20%28symbolism%29">serpent</a> or an <a href="otter">otter</a>. There are numerous fragments dating from the 14th and 15th centuries. These include portions of <a href="Course%20%28architecture%29%23String%20course">string courses</a>, tracery, <a href="corbel">corbel</a>s, window jambs, and arch heads. At least three of the corbels were carved in the form of human heads. Over 1,500 fragments of painted medieval glass were found, most of it in a poor condition. These show that the glazing scheme used in the priory was mainly in <a href="grisaille">grisaille</a> (<a href="monochrome">monochrome</a>) style. Almost 1,300 fragments of glass from later periods, and nearly 1,150 <a href="sherd">sherd</a>s of <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a> roof tiles were also found.

Some 500 fragments of pottery were found dating from the medieval period. Most of these were parts of jars, jugs or <a href="pipkin">pipkin</a>s and were found in the area of the kitchen range. Most of it was produced locally, although 13 sherds of <a href="Stamford%20Ware">Stamford Ware</a>, fragments of two jugs from North France, and two small pieces of <a href="Saintonge%23Pottery">Saintonge pottery</a> have been identified. Only a few wooden bowls were recovered. Much more pottery was found dating from the post-medieval period and later. Again most of this had been manufactured in England, especially in <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>. Fragments of pottery from abroad included pieces from a <a href="Westerwald">Westerwald</a> mug, a jug from <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> and items of Chinese <a href="porcelain">porcelain</a>. The excavations produced over 4,000 sherds of glass, dating from the 12th to the 20th centuries, but only 16 of these came from the period before the dissolution. A total of 1,170 fragments from <a href="Smoking%20pipe%20%28tobacco%29%23Clay">clay tobacco pipes</a> were found, dating from about 1580 to the early 20th century.

Six medieval coins were recovered, the earliest of which was a silver <a href="penny">penny</a> of <a href="John%20of%20England">John</a> from the early 13th century. Coins from later periods were a silver <a href="Threepence%20%28British%20coin%29">threepence</a> from the reign of <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a> and a silver penny from <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>. Only low-denomination coins were found from the 18th century and later, including a 10-<a href="pfennig">pfennig</a> piece from Germany dated 1901. Two silver spoons were recovered, one of which was dated 1846 from the <a href="hallmark">hallmark</a>. Objects made from <a href="copper%20alloy">copper alloy</a> were found, many of which were associated with personal adornment and dress including brooches, buckles, and buttons. Also found from this period was a small simple chape (<a href="scabbard">scabbard</a> tip), and part of a <a href="Skimmer%20%28machine%29">skimmer</a> that had been used in the kitchen. Artefacts made from iron, other than nails, were again mainly items of personal adornment and dress. Other identifiable iron items from this period included keys, two possible rowel <a href="spur">spur</a>s (spurs with revolving pointed wheels), and about 12 <a href="horseshoe">horseshoe</a>s.

Nearly 2,000 fragments of lead were found, 940 of which were droplets of melted metal, some of these being a consequence of the fire in 1236. One of the earliest artefacts was a <a href="papal%20bull">papal bull</a>a dating from the rule of <a href="Pope%20Clement%20III">Pope Clement III</a> (1187–91). Two other possible <a href="Seal%20%28emblem%29">seals</a> were discovered. A total of 15 lead discs were recovered, some of which were inscribed with crosses. Two of these were found in graves, but the purpose of the discs has not been reliably explained. The other lead artefacts from this period were associated with the structure of the buildings and include fragments of kame (the lead used in <a href="Leadlight">leaded windows</a>), ventilator grills, and water pipes. Leather fragments almost all came from shoes, and included an almost complete child's shoe dating from the late 16th or the 17th century. Another find was a small <a href="gemstone">gemstone</a>, a <a href="cabochon">cabochon</a> (polished) <a href="onyx">sardonyx</a>.

Norton Priory is considered to be "a monastic site of international importance" and is "the most extensively excavated monastic site in Britain, if not Western Europe". It is open to the public and run by a <a href="charitable%20trust">charitable trust</a>, the Norton Priory Museum Trust. The Trust was founded in 1975 and the first museum was opened in 1982; a much enlarged museum was built and opened in 2016. The Trust owns and maintains many of the artefacts found during the excavations, and has created an electronic database to record all the acquisitions. In addition, it holds records relating to the excavations, including site notebooks and photographs. The area open to the public consists of a museum, the standing archaeological remains, 42 acres of garden and woodland, and the walled garden of the former house.

The museum contains information relating to the history of the site and some of the artefacts discovered during the excavations. These include carved coffin lids, medieval mosaic tiles, pottery, scribe's writing equipment and domestic items from the various buildings on the site such as buttons, combs and wig curlers. Two medieval skeletons recovered in the excavations are on display, including one showing signs of <a href="Paget%27s%20disease%20of%20bone">Paget's disease of bone</a>. Standing in the museum is a reconstruction of the cloister arcade as it had been built following the fire of 1236. It consists of <a href="molding%20%28decorative%29">moulded</a> pointed arches with <a href="Springer%20%28architecture%29">springer</a> blocks, <a href="voussoir">voussoir</a>s and apex stones, supported on triple shafts with foliate <a href="Capital%20%28architecture%29">capitals</a> and moulded bases. Above the capitals, at the bases of the arches, are sculptures that include depictions of human and animal heads. The human heads consist of two canons with hoods and protruding tonsures, other males, and females with shoulder-length hair. In one <a href="spandrel">spandrel</a> is a seated figure with an outstretched arm holding a book. Other carvings depict such subjects as fabulous beasts, and an otter or a snake.

The museum contains the medieval sandstone statue of <a href="Saint%20Christopher">Saint Christopher</a>, which is considered to be "a work of national and even international importance". <a href="Saint%20Christopher">Saint Christopher</a> was associated with the abbey because of its proximity to the River Mersey and the dangers associated with crossing the river. The statue shows the saint wading through fish-filled water carrying the Christ-child on his shoulder. It has been dated to about 1390, it is tall, and was once painted in bright colours. The gallery also contains a three-dimensional representation of the statue as it is believed it would have originally appeared.

The archaeological remains are recognised as a Grade I <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> and a <a href="scheduled%20ancient%20monument">scheduled ancient monument</a>, and are considered to be the most important monastic remains in Cheshire. They consist of the former undercroft and the foundations of the church and monastic buildings that were exposed during the excavations. The undercroft stands outside the museum building. It is a single-storey structure consisting of seven pairs of <a href="bay%20%28architecture%29">bays</a> divided into two compartments, one of four and the other of three bays. It is entered through the <a href="portico">portico</a> added to the west front of the country house in 1886 by way of a pair of arched doorways in <a href="Norman%20architecture">Norman</a> style. The doorway to the right (south) is original, dating from the late 12th century, while the other doorway is a replica dated 1886. The older doorway has been described as "the finest decorated Norman doorway in Cheshire". It is in good condition with little evidence of erosion and Greene considers that this is because it has always been protected from the weather. The portico leads into the four-bay compartment. This has a tiled floor and contains a medieval-style fireplace. The roof is <a href="rib%20vault">ribbed vaulted</a>. On the east wall is a two-arched doorway leading to the former cloisters. To the north another archway leads to the three-bay compartment. This also has a tile floor and contains the brick wine bins added in the 1780s. The roof of this compartment has <a href="Groin%20vault">groined vaults</a>. The undercroft also contains a bell mould, reconstructed from the fragments of the original mould found in the excavations.

At the northern end of the undercroft is the passage known as the outer parlour. This has stone benches on each side and elaborately carved blind <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcades</a> above them. The arcades each consist of two groups of four round-headed arches with <a href="Capital%20%28architecture%29">capitals</a>, free-standing <a href="column">column</a>s and bases that are set on the benches. The capitals and <a href="Molding%20%28decorative%29">mouldings</a> of the arches are decorated with a variety of carvings, the capitals being predominantly late <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> in style and the arches early <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a>. The carvings include depictions of human heads, stiff-leaf foliage and animals.

The of grounds surrounding the house have been largely restored to include the 18th-century pathways, the stream-glade and the 19th-century rock garden. The foundations exposed in the excavations show the plan of the former church and monastic buildings. In the grounds is a Grade II listed garden <a href="loggia">loggia</a> in yellow sandstone, possibly designed by <a href="James%20Wyatt">James Wyatt</a>. At its front are two <a href="Doric%20order">Doric</a> columns and two <a href="Anta%20%28architecture%29">antae</a>, and above these is a <a href="cornice">cornice</a> with a fluted <a href="frieze">frieze</a>. The side walls are built in stone, and the back wall is constructed internally of stone and externally of brickwork. Also in the grounds are several modern sculptures, and a sculpture trail has been designed in conjunction with these. In the 1970s the fragments of the mould found in the bell pit were re-assembled and used to create a replica of the bell, which was cast in <a href="Widnes">Widnes</a> and now stands in a frame in the grounds. This was opened at a ceremony performed by Sir <a href="Bernard%20Lovell">Bernard Lovell</a> in 1977. A <a href="Kitchen%20garden%23Herb%20garden">herb garden</a> was developed as part of the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s "Hidden Garden" programme. This seeks to re-create a herb garden as it would have been during the medieval period, and its plan is based on herb gardens in other monastic sites. The plants grown are those reputed to be of value in treating the diseases revealed in the excavated skeletons.

The gardens also include a woodland gardens with summer house, a stream glade, a wild-flower meadow and an orchard. The gardens are promoted by the <a href="Campaign%20to%20Protect%20Rural%20England">Campaign to Protect Rural England</a>.

The 3.5 acre (1 ha) <a href="walled%20garden">walled garden</a> was restored in the 1980s. It includes an orchard, fruit and vegetable gardens, ornamental borders and a rose walk, as well as the <a href="NCCPG%20National%20Plant%20Collection">national collection</a> of tree <a href="quince">quince</a> ("Cydonia oblonga"), with 20 different varieties. Close to the walled garden is a Grade II listed <a href="Icehouse%20%28building%29">ice house</a>, probably dating from the 18th century, which is constructed in brick covered with a mound of earth. The entrance is surrounded by stone walls, from which a tunnel leads to a circular domed chamber.

The museum is a visitor attraction. It arranges a series of events for the general public throughout the year, including guided tours, family fun days and concerts. Its educational programme is aimed at all ages; it includes workshops for the general public, and courses focusing on formal and informal aspects of children's education. An outreach programme is intended for individuals and groups in the community. Since its opening, the museum has won awards for its work in tourism, education, outreach and gardening. In 2004 the museum's "Positive Partnerships" project, in which people with learning disabilities worked alongside museum staff, was a finalist in the <a href="Gulbenkian%20Prize">Gulbenkian Prize</a> for museums and galleries. In August 2016 the newly rebuilt and expanded museum opened to the public. This cost £4.5m, of which £3.9m was contributed by the <a href="Heritage%20Lottery%20Fund">Heritage Lottery Fund</a>.

Thomas Playford IV

Sir Thomas Playford (5 July 1896 – 16 June 1981) was an <a href="Australia">Australia</a>n politician from the state of <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>. He served continuously as <a href="Premier%20of%20South%20Australia">Premier of South Australia</a> and leader of the <a href="Liberal%20and%20Country%20League">Liberal and Country League</a> from 5 November 1938 to 10 March 1965. Though controversial, it was the longest term of any elected government leader in the history of Australia. His tenure as premier was marked by a period of population and economic growth unmatched by any other <a href="States%20and%20territories%20of%20Australia">Australian state</a>. He was known for his parochial style in pushing South Australia's interests, and was known for his ability to secure a disproportionate share of federal funding for the state as well as his shameless haranguing of federal leaders. His string of election wins was enabled by a system of a <a href="Apportionment%20%28politics%29">malapportionment</a> <a href="gerrymander">gerrymander</a> that bore his name, the '<a href="Playmander">Playmander</a>' − which saw the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28South%20Australian%20Branch%29">Labor Party</a> win clear majorities of the statewide <a href="Two-party-preferred%20vote">two-party</a> vote whilst failing to form government in <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201944">1944</a>, <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201953">1953</a>, <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201962">1962</a> and <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201968">1968</a>.

Born into an old <a href="Playford%20family">political family</a>, Playford was the fifth Thomas Playford and the fourth to have lived in South Australia; his grandfather <a href="Thomas%20Playford%20II">Thomas Playford II</a> had served as premier in the 19th century. He grew up on the family farm in <a href="Norton%20Summit%2C%20South%20Australia">Norton Summit</a> before enlisting in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, fighting in <a href="Battle%20of%20Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a> and <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Europe</a>. After serving, he continued farming until his election as a <a href="Liberal%20and%20Country%20League">Liberal and Country League</a> (LCL) representative for <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Murray%20%28South%20Australia%29">Murray</a> at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201933">1933 state election</a>. In his early years in politics, Playford was an outspoken backbencher who often lambasted LCL colleagues and ministers and their policies, and had a maverick strategy, often defying party norms and advocating unadulterated <a href="laissez%20faire">laissez faire</a> economics and opposing <a href="protectionism">protectionism</a> and government investment, in stark contrast to his later actions as premier. With the resignation of the LCL's leader, <a href="Richard%20Layton%20Butler">Richard Layton Butler</a>, Playford ascended to the premiership in 1938, having been made a minister just months earlier in an attempt to dampen his insubordination. Playford inherited a <a href="minority%20government">minority government</a> and many independents to deal with, and instability was expected; Playford was seen as a transitional leader. However, Playford dealt with the independents adroitly and went on to secure a one-seat majority at the next election.

In office, Playford turned his back on laissez faire economics and used his negotiating skills to encourage industry to relocate to South Australia during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, as the state was far from the battlefield. He built upon this in the post-war boom years, particular in automotive manufacturing; although a <a href="liberal%20conservatism">liberal conservative</a>, his approach to economics was pragmatic, and he was derided by his colleagues for his "<a href="socialism">socialism</a>" as he nationalised electricity companies and used state enterprises to drive economic growth. Generally, Playford had more dissent from within his own party than the opposition centre-left <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28South%20Australian%20Branch%29">Labor Party</a>; the main obstructions to his initiatives came from the <a href="Legislative%20Council%20of%20South%20Australia">upper house</a>, where the restriction of suffrage to landowners resulted in a chamber dominated by the conservative landed gentry. The Labor leader <a href="Mick%20O%27Halloran">Mick O'Halloran</a> worked cooperatively with Playford and was known to be happy being out of power, quipping that Playford could better serve his left-wing constituents. Playford's policies allowed for the supply of cheap electricity to factories, minimal business taxes, and low wages to make the state more attractive to industrial investment. Playford kept salaries low by using the <a href="South%20Australian%20Housing%20Trust">South Australian Housing Trust</a> to building vast amounts of public housing and using government price controls to keep housing and other costs of living low to attract workers and migrants, angering the landlord class. Implemented in the 1940s, these policies were seen as dangerous to Playford's control of his party, but they proved successful and he cemented his position within the LCL.

During the 1950s, Playford and the LCL's share of the vote declined continually despite the economic growth, and they clung to power mainly due to the <a href="Playmander">Playmander</a>. Playford became less assured in parliament as Labor became more aggressive, their leading debater <a href="Don%20Dunstan">Don Dunstan</a> combatively disrupting the previously collaborative style of politics, targeting the injustice of the Playmander in particular. Playford's successful economic policies had fuelled a rapid expansion of the middle class, which wanted more government attention to education, public healthcare, the arts, the environment and heritage protection. However, Playford was an unrelenting utilitarian, and was unmoved by calls to broaden policy focus beyond economic development. This was exacerbated by Playford and his party's failure to adapt to changing social mores, remaining adamantly committed to restrictive laws on alcohol, gambling and police powers. A turning point in Playford's tenure was the <a href="Max%20Stuart">Max Stuart</a> case in the 1950s, when Playford came under heavy scrutiny for his hesitation to grant clemency to a murderer on death row amid claims of judicial wrongdoing. Although Playford eventually commuted the sentence under heavy criticism of the judicial review process, the controversy was seen as responsible for his government losing its assurance, and he eventually lost office in the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201965">1965 election</a>. He relinquished the party leadership to <a href="Steele%20Hall">Steele Hall</a> and retired at the next election, serving on various South Australian company boards until his death in 1981.

The Playford family heritage can be traced back to 1759, when a baby boy was left at the door of a house in <a href="Barnby%20Dun">Barnby Dun</a>, <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, England, with a note to christen the child 'Thomas Playford'. The occupants of the house, who were to raise the child, were given instructions to receive money from a bank account for the deed. The child grew up to be a simple farmer in the village, and had a son in 1795 whom he christened 'Thomas Playford'. The tradition of naming the firstborn son in the family in this way has continued since.

The second Playford was something of a loner, but at the age of 15 he developed a relationship with a girl five years his senior with whom he fathered a child. In order to avoid the social stigma of the situation, and on the advice of his parents, Playford enlisted in the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> in 1810. While three years under the acceptable age, Playford's height (6 ft 2 in) enabled him to pass as eighteen. He spent 24 years in the service of the <a href="Life%20Guards%20%28British%20Army%29">Life Guards</a>, fighting all over Europe in Portugal, Spain and France, including the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a> at the age of 20.

While a soldier, Playford became a devout Christian, and journeyed and listened to many different churches and sermons. He was sceptical of many pastors and church men, dismissing their "high sounding barren words". He left the Life Guards in 1834, received a land grant in Canada for his service, and journeyed there with his wife and family. His wife and a child died in the country, so he and his remaining kin returned to England. He worked as a historian for the Life Guards until 1844 when he migrated to the then-province of <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>. Playford became a pastor there, built a property at <a href="Mitcham%2C%20South%20Australia">Mitcham</a>, and preached regularly for his own 'Christian Church', which was essentially <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> in character.

The third Playford, <a href="Thomas%20Playford%20II">Thomas Playford II</a>, was born at <a href="Bethnal%20Green">Bethnal Green</a>, <a href="London">London</a> in 1837 to the second wife of Pastor Playford. He was raised on the Mitcham property in South Australia, was intellectual and bookish, and wished to go the prestigious <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20College%2C%20Adelaide">St Peter's College</a> to study law. He was rebuked by his father and subsequently became a farmer like his predecessors, buying property at <a href="Norton%20Summit%2C%20South%20Australia">Norton Summit</a> and growing vegetables, plums and apples. He was elected to the local <a href="Adelaide%20Hills%20Council">East Torrens Council</a> in 1863 at the age of 27; and then to the <a href="South%20Australian%20House%20of%20Assembly">State Parliament</a> in 1868 as a 'liberal' (parties had not yet formed), representing the constituency of <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Onkaparinga">Onkaparinga</a>. He became known as 'Honest Tom' for his straightforward and blunt ways. He lost his seat in 1871 and regained it in 1875 only to lose it again until he was re-elected in 1887, upon which he became Premier of South Australia. He subsequently lost the premiership in 1889, regained it in 1890, and then spent a great deal of his term absent in India. After losing an election, he relocated to London to represent South Australia as <a href="Agent%20General">Agent General</a> to the United Kingdom. While in England, Playford was thrice offered a knighthood, but declined it each time.

He returned to <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> to assist <a href="Charles%20Kingston">Charles Kingston</a> in his government, but ultimately crossed the floor to bring down Kingston over his plans to lessen the power of the <a href="South%20Australian%20Legislative%20Council">Legislative Council</a>. With the advent of <a href="Federation%20of%20Australia">Australian Federation</a>, Playford became a Senator for South Australia. He was leader of the Senate and the 7th Minister for Defence. After one term as a Senator, Playford was defeated. He ran again in 1910, was unsuccessful, and retired to <a href="Kent%20Town%2C%20South%20Australia">Kent Town</a>, where he died in 1915 at the age of 78.

The fourth Playford, father of Sir Thomas, was born in 1861. Unlike his own father and grandfather, who had led lives as soldiers, churchmen and politicians, he became a simple farmer at the Norton Summit property and was dominated by his wife, Elizabeth. He was, like his forebears, a regular churchgoer, and only once was involved in politics with a short stint on the East Torrens District Council. In comparison, Elizabeth was the local correspondent of "<a href="The%20Advertiser%20%28Australia%29">The Advertiser</a>", treasurer and chief member of the local Baptist Church, and a teacher. Four children were born to the couple; three daughters and one son, Sir Thomas.

Thomas Playford was the third child born to the family, with two sisters before him and one following. He started school at the age of six, going to the local Norton Summit School. The school had one room, one teacher, two assistants and 60 students, and taught children aged six to twelve. Playford, while an adept learner, frequently argued with his teacher, and was the first child to have been <a href="caning">caned</a> there. While learning, he accompanied his father down to the East End Markets with their farming produce.

It was the influence of Playford's mother Elizabeth that contributed to his relative Puritanism and social habits. She was a devout Baptist Christian, and it was primarily because of her that he publicly abstained from alcohol, smoking, and gambling throughout his lifetime. However, despite her influence on his social habits, he did not regularly attend church like his family. His father suffered a fall and a broken leg when Playford was thirteen. He requested permission to leave school and take over the family farm; this was granted, and the boy, even after his father had recovered, dominated the management of the farm. While out of school, Playford continued to learn; he joined the local Norton Summit Society, and took part in classes and debates in <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>. He won a public speaking award for a speech he made to an Adelaide literary society.

<a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> broke out in 1914, and Playford wished to join the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a>. His parents persuaded him to assist them on the farm until close to his 19th birthday. He entered <a href="Keswick%2C%20South%20Australia">Keswick Barracks</a> on 17 May 1915, was enlisted as a <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a> and placed in the <a href="27th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">27th Battalion</a>, <a href="2nd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">2nd Division</a>. The news of the bloody landings at <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli</a> on 25 April had not reached Adelaide by the time Playford left on HMAT "Geelong" on 31 May. The "Geelong" picked up more soldiers at <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth</a>, and then sailed to <a href="Suez">Suez</a>, Egypt. The Australian soldiers received training in Egypt, but during the evenings left their camps to indulge themselves in the Egyptian towns and cities. Frequent fights broke out between the Australian troops and the locals, with responsible soldiers left to take the rest back to camp. Playford assisted in this and dragged Australian soldiers from the beds of Egyptian prostitutes. Training was completed after two months and Playford landed at <a href="Anzac%20Cove">Anzac Cove</a> on 12 September 1915.

After taking part in the Gallipoli Campaign, Playford and his battalion left for France on 15 March 1916. He fought on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> and was shot and wounded on 20 October, evacuated to London, and kept out of action for a year. Playford endured many operations during this time to remove the <a href="Shrapnel%20shell">shrapnel</a> that had penetrated his body, although some of it remained within him, and his hearing was permanently damaged. Turning down an offer for a staff job in <a href="British%20Raj">India</a>, Playford returned to his battalion in October 1917 and continued fighting in Belgium and France.

With the end of the Great War, Playford returned to South Australia with his battalion, disembarking at <a href="Outer%20Harbor%2C%20South%20Australia">Outer Harbor, Adelaide</a> on 2 July 1919. He had received no decorations, but had been commissioned from the ranks as an <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officer</a> and was honourably discharged in October with the rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">lieutenant</a>. Despite Playford's intellectual capability, he shunned the Government's offer of free university education for soldiers and returned to his orchard. He continued growing cherries on the property, and engaged in his hobby of <a href="horticulture">horticulture</a>. His involvement in various organisations and clubs was renewed.

Through relatives Playford met his future wife Lorna Clark, who lived with her family in <a href="Nailsworth%2C%20South%20Australia">Nailsworth</a>. Although both families were religiously devout, the Clarks were even more so than the Playfords, and a long courtship ensued. Taking her out on his Harley Davidson motorcycle at night, the two were forced to leave the theatre halfway through performances so as to not raise the ire of the Clarks. Before their wedding on 1 January 1928, they were engaged for three years. During their engagement, Playford built their new house on his property, mostly by his own hands and indented in the hills themselves; it remained their home throughout their lives.

Two years later, on <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> Day, 1930, the family's first daughter was born, Margaret. Two more children were born to the family; Patricia in 1936, and Thomas Playford V in 1945. All three of them attended private schools: Patricia attended the <a href="Seymour%20College">Presbyterian Girls' College</a>, becoming a teacher; and Margaret attended <a href="Annesley%20College">Methodist Ladies' College</a>, later training as a child psychiatrist. The sixth Thomas wanted to attend university, but, like his forebears, was rebuked and worked on the orchard. Like a Playford before him, he became a minister of religion in his later life.

Among the organisations that Playford belonged to was the local branch of the <a href="Liberal%20Federation">Liberal Federation</a>, yet until the months preceding his eventual election, he never talked of holding political office. The Liberal Federation was considering a merger with the <a href="Country%20Party%20%28South%20Australia%29">Country Party</a> to avoid <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28South%20Australian%20Branch%29">Labor</a> retaining office during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. <a href="Archie%20Cameron">Archie Cameron</a>, an old wartime friend of Playford's and a federal Coalition MP, influenced Playford to run for office when he heard of the merger. In 1932 the <a href="Liberal%20and%20Country%20League">Liberal and Country League</a> (LCL) was created, and Playford ran for the multi-member constituency of <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Murray%20%28South%20Australia%29">Murray</a> at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201933">1933 election</a>.
Along with the other LCL hopefuls, Playford journeyed around the electorate advocating his platform. The constituency had a considerable German element, descendants of refugees who had escaped persecution in the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>. Grateful for the past help of Playford's grandfather, they swung their strong support behind him and he was comfortably elected to the <a href="South%20Australian%20House%20of%20Assembly">South Australian House of Assembly</a>. With a split in the Labor vote, the first LCL government was formed with <a href="Richard%20Layton%20Butler">Richard Layton Butler</a> as <a href="Premier%20of%20South%20Australia">Premier</a>.

For the next five years Playford was to remain a backbencher, and to involve himself relatively little in government matters. His speeches were short, but to the point, and, running against the norm, he often attacked the government itself when he saw fit. The historian <a href="Peter%20Howell%20%28historian%29">Peter Howell</a> said that Playford was "an unusually insolent and disloyal backbencher, always concerned to cut a figure and ridicule his party's leader". A new member's maiden speech is traditionally heard politely without the interruption and heckling prevalent in Australian politics, but Playford's aggressive debut in parliament was not accorded this privilege as "a casual visitor could have mistaken him" for an opposition member. At one point, a visibly angry Premier Butler interjected after Playford attacked the members of the Employment Promotion Council. In his opening address, Playford individually mocked the bureaucrats who comprised various government bodies, and then condemned public transport monopolies, as well as declaring "It is not our business to worry whether people go broke or not". This comment provoked interjections from both government and opposition members—in the midst of the Great Depression, Playford's unashamed and aggressive promotion of his unbridled <a href="laissez%20faire">laissez faire</a> philosophy stood out amidst the increasing prevalence of government intervention.

During his first term in parliament, Playford also gained attention for his unconvincing command of the English language; he developed a reputation for pronouncing common words incorrectly, bad syntax and speaking in a monotone. He continued to attack his ministers, and complaints from the likes of Public Works Minister <a href="Herbert%20Hudd">Herbert Hudd</a> only encouraged Playford to further mock him. Playford also consistently opposed the liberalisation of liquor trading, having been unimpressed by the drunken behaviour he had witnessed while in the military. He continued to stridently support <a href="economic%20rationalism">economic rationalism</a>, something he would later renege on as premier. He opposed government investment in capital works as a means of generating employment and stimulating the economy during the Depression, and called for a decrease in dairy production within the state on the basis that it was more efficient to import from interstate, where rainfall was higher and grazing was more effective. Playford further criticised government subsidies to work farms designed to alleviate unemployment among <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australians</a>, claiming that the cost exceeded that of the standard jobless payment. He also endorsed the privatisation of unprofitable state railways and denounced <a href="tariff%20protection">tariff protection</a> as rewarding inefficiency and non-innovation. In 1936, Playford defied his party by voting against the formation of the <a href="South%20Australian%20Housing%20Trust">South Australian Housing Trust</a>. Nevertheless, despite his refusal to toe the party line, Playford was well regarded for his studious attitude to research and his preparation of his speeches.

Around Playford, much activity was occurring. Legislation provided for the tools that he was to inherit later as Premier: aggressive economic initiatives, a malapportioned electoral system and a staid internal party organisation. The state had been persistently in deficit in recent times, and as an agriculture-dominant state, had been at the mercy of commodity prices, so a strategy of industrialisation was initiated under the guidance of senior politicians, public servants and industrialists. The creation of the LCL was dependent on the implementation of various policies to ensure the strength of the party's country faction. There had been an electoral bias in favour of rural areas since the Constitution Act of 1857, but it was now to dramatically increase. In 1936, legislation was brought in that stipulated that electoral districts were to be malapportioned to a ratio of at least 2:1 in favour of country areas. In addition, the 46 multimember districts were replaced with 39 single-member districts—13 in Adelaide and 26 in the country. Over the next three decades, Adelaide's population grew until it had triple the population of the country, but the distribution of seats in the legislature gave rural voters a disproportionate influence by a factor of six. The desired long-term effect was to lock the opposition Labor Party out of power; the unexpected short-term effect was a large number of dissatisfied rural independents in the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201938">1938 election</a>. Although he played no part in its development or implementation, the electoral system <a href="gerrymander">gerrymander</a> was later christened the '<a href="Playmander">Playmander</a>', as a result of its benefit to Playford, and his failure to take action towards reforming it.

After the Liberals won the 1938 election, with Playford having transferred to <a href="electoral%20district%20of%20Gumeracha">Gumeracha</a>, Butler sought to tame Playford's aggressive oratory approach towards the LCL cabinet by offering him a ministry. Playford entered the cabinet in March 1938 as the Commissioner of Crown Lands, and held portfolios in Irrigation and Repatriation. The new frontbencher subsequently adopted a more moderate style of parliamentary conduct. Butler abandoned the Premiership in November to seek election for the federal seat of <a href="Division%20of%20Wakefield">Wakefield</a>, a Liberal stronghold that had been vacated by the death of sitting member <a href="Charles%20Hawker">Charles Hawker</a> in an aviation accident. Despite having been in cabinet for only a few months, Playford was unanimously elected as the new leader of the LCL by his peers, and thus became the 33rd Premier of South Australia. Like Butler, he also served as <a href="Treasurer%20of%20South%20Australia">Treasurer of South Australia</a>. Regarded as a compromise candidate who was able to appeal to both urban and rural voters, it was thought that Playford would only be a transitional leader before someone else took over the Liberal leadership, but he was to remain for almost 27 years.

Upon his ascension, Playford headed a minority government; the LCL only held 15 of the 39 seats in the lower house. The <a href="Balance%20of%20power%20%28parliament%29">balance of power</a> was held by 13 mostly conservative independents. Many had gained from discontent over Butler's relatively liberal social stances, so Playford sought to assuage them by having his LCL colleagues refrain from upsetting social conservatives. He also used the threat of an early election to deter the independents from stalling his initiatives—with their lack of party infrastructure and funding, they would be the most vulnerable to election campaigns.

Playford became a wartime Premier in 1939 when Australia, as part of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>, <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">entered</a> <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Later in the war, cut off from traditional suppliers of manufactures, the country was forced to create its own. Armaments and munitions factories needed to be created to supply the war effort, and Playford was vociferous in advocating South Australia as the perfect location for these. It was far from the battlegrounds and had the most efficient labour force in the nation. British Tube Mills opened a mill in the inner-northern suburbs. Ammunition factories were built in the northern and western suburbs of <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, as well as in some smaller installations in regional centres, and construction on a shipyard began in <a href="Whyalla%2C%20South%20Australia">Whyalla</a>. Having strenuously opposed a construction of a pipeline to pump water from <a href="Morgan%2C%20South%20Australia">Morgan</a> in the <a href="River%20Murray">River Murray</a> to Whyalla for the steelworks and blast furnace there before his ascension to the premiership, Playford oversaw approval of the <a href="Morgan-Whyalla%20pipeline">Morgan-Whyalla pipeline</a> in 1940 and its completion in 1944. He also reversed his previous opposition to Butler's pine plantation and sawmill program, authorising an expansion of the program in the state's southeast.

<a href="Salisbury%2C%20South%20Australia">Salisbury</a>, then a <a href="dormitory%20town">dormitory town</a> to the north of Adelaide, became a defence centre; the shipyards at Whyalla began launching <a href="corvette">corvette</a>s in 1941 just as <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japan</a> entered the war. All of these developments were done under Playford's watch, with most of the factories being built by the Department of Manpower and the <a href="South%20Australian%20Housing%20Trust">South Australian Housing Trust</a>. In <a href="Woodville%2C%20South%20Australia">Woodville</a> in western Adelaide, a large plant for Actil cotton was built. The explosives factory at Salisbury was converted into an aerospace research facility after the war, as various companies worked on matters related to rocket testing at <a href="Woomera%20Test%20Range">Woomera</a> in the state's far north; the Salisbury complex became the second largest employer of South Australians for a period after the war. The munitions factory in the western suburb of <a href="Hendon%2C%20South%20Australia">Hendon</a> was later converted into a plant for the electrical appliance firm <a href="Philips">Philips</a> and at its peak employed more than three thousand people.
In order for these developments to occur, Playford personally had to attend to the bureaucracy that stood in the way. He confronted public service workers, and successfully negotiated with the heads of private companies. But it was negotiations with the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Federal Government</a> that were to prove the hardest. In his time as Premier, Playford was to confront seven different Prime Ministers: <a href="Joseph%20Lyons">Lyons</a>, <a href="Earle%20Page">Page</a>, <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Menzies</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Fadden">Fadden</a>, <a href="John%20Curtin">Curtin</a>, <a href="Frank%20Forde">Forde</a> and <a href="Ben%20Chifley">Chifley</a>. Strangely, he enjoyed best relations with the Laborite Chifley, and had a poor rapport with his fellow conservative, Menzies. During the wartime years, Menzies' reluctance to meet with Playford initially hampered industrial efforts, but Playford's other federal colleagues made sure that deals could be made.

To Playford's advantage there was usually a disproportionate number of South Australians in federal cabinets, both Liberal and Labor. This clout, combined with his own intensive and unconventional negotiating tactics, made sure that South Australia regularly received more federal funds than it would have been allocated otherwise. This was to Robert Menzies' chagrin, who said: "Tom [Playford] wouldn't know intellectual honesty if he met it on the end of a pitch fork but he does it all for South Australia, not for himself, so I forgive him." By the time of his departure from power, Playford gained the reputation of being "a good South Australian but a very bad Australian", and for using "threats to bully recalcitrant Prime Ministers". For his part, Playford remained unrepentant, claiming that federal authorities had infringed the <a href="constitution%20of%20Australia">constitution of Australia</a> and had consistent exercised powers over the states that were not rightfully theirs. Playford accused the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court of Australia</a> of helping the federal parliament under Curtin to legislate to give itself a monopoly on the acquisition of income tax, which he claimed was contrary to the intention of the constitution to prevent excessive centralisation of power in the federal government. In 1958, he threatened to take the federal government to the High Court, which led to South Australia being given more compensation under the River Murray Waters Agreement for the loss of water from the <a href="Snowy%20River">Snowy River</a>. Three years later he went to the High Court in an attempt to have Canberra pay for the standardisation of the gauge on the <a href="Broken%20Hill">Broken Hill</a>-<a href="Port%20Pirie">Port Pirie</a> railway.

During the war, two state elections were held, in 1941 and 1944. In the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201941">1941 election</a>, there was a significant decrease in the <a href="Independent%20politician">independent</a> vote, and both the Labor Party and the LCL made gains, with Playford forming the LCL's first majority government. This was in large part due to the LCL's shift to the right on social issues to usurp the independents' appeal. In 1942, compulsory voting (but not enrolment) was introduced, and first took effect at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201944">1944 election</a>, with an increase in voter turnout from 51% to 89%. Again Playford won with a one-seat LCL majority, hanging on with the help of the malapportioned electoral system.

Power and water schemes were expanded to be able to cope with the industrial development occurring. The state was at a disadvantage in that it was completely reliant on imports for its fuel supply. South Australia's near-monopoly electricity supplier, the Adelaide Electricity Supply Company (AESC), was reluctant to build up coal reserves in case of a transportation problem. They ran on coal that was shipped over from <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> (NSW), where the mines were inefficient and plagued by <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Australia">communist</a>-agitated industrial strife. Playford demanded that supplies be built up so the factories could keep producing; he managed to secure eight months worth of coal reserves from NSW, but even that began to dwindle due to the continued industrial action. Coal supplies were ordered from South Africa in desperation, at Playford's behest. The frustration he experienced while dealing with the AESC would later prove disastrous to the company as the Premier took action against them.

The AESC continued to snub the government. Playford advocated the use of <a href="Lignite">brown coal</a> from the South Australian <a href="Leigh%20Creek%2C%20South%20Australia">Leigh Creek</a> mine to avoid supply complications, and even made into law a bill encouraging its use. He also championed the development of the town and the expansion of the mine, which had been dormant for several decades, to ease the state's dependency on imported coal. Much state and federal government money was invested in the scheme, the town infrastructure was built, and the production started in February 1944. Shortly afterwards, the AESC responded by buying new boilers which would only be able to the more productive <a href="coal">black coal</a>. With more conflicts ensuing, and even with the company slowly relenting, Playford did not stop his struggle. A <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> in March 1945 was appointed to ascertain a solution between the two parties, and presented its report in August with a recommendation that the AESC be <a href="nationalisation">nationalised</a>. A few months later, Playford's stance received a boost when heavy strikes in New South Wales forced shutdowns in South Australia that saw thousands of labourers out of work. By then at the head of the only conservative government in the nation, when Playford requested commonwealth funds to assist in the nationalisation of the AESC Prime Minister Chifley responded with glee and enthusiasm. On 11 October, he presented a bill to <a href="Parliament%20of%20South%20Australia">Parliament</a> to nationalise the AESC and create the <a href="Electricity%20Trust%20of%20South%20Australia">Electricity Trust of South Australia</a>.
Labor, astonished that such an action was to come from a Liberal Premier, resolutely supported the bill, guaranteeing it passage through the House of Assembly 29–6, the only dissenters being LCL members. However, the Legislative Council was dominated by economic conservatives, fierce adherents of free enterprise and opponents of what they considered to be undue government intervention in the economy. The LCL councillors tried to have the bill watered down to allow merely for government control of AESC for a brief period. In the Council, where suffrage was reliant upon wage and property requirements, the ALP only held four seats out of twenty, and only five LCL members supported the nationalisation. Thus, on 7 November, the bill failed to pass and it was not put to the Parliament again until 1946. On 6 April, after months of campaigning on Playford's part, he managed to change the mind of MLC <a href="Jack%20Bice">Jack Bice</a>, and the bill passed. The Electricity Trust of South Australia was formed, and was to become a major aid to post-war industrialisation.

The decision to nationalise AESC and develop Leigh Creek proved to be prescient. In early 1947, mines in New South Wales were again crippled by strikes. The worst strike came in 1949, forcing Chifley to send in the armed forces to extract coal. While the other states had to suffer industrial power rationing and thus reduced manufacturing output and more unemployment, South Australia managed to escape as the miners at Leigh Creek worked around the clock. Within four years the mine was operating at a surplus and the town was further rewarded with federal funding. From 1947 until the end of Playford's leadership in 1965, the output of the mine increased tenfold to almost two million tons a year. Transport infrastructure was improved, European immigrant workers were recruited, and twin power plants at <a href="Port%20Augusta%2C%20South%20Australia">Port Augusta</a> were completed in 1960 and named after the premier. The new plants exclusively used Leigh Creek coal and by 1970, the whole state was self-sufficient for electricity. ETSA and the mine were generating enough revenue to maintain the town—sometimes dubbed Uncle Tom's Baby—and mine of Leigh Creek and making a profit as well. From 1946 to 1965, the proportion of South Australians connected to electricity increased from 70 to 96%.

The nationalisation of the AESC was the most prominent manifestation of Playford's economic pragmatism; although ideologically a supporter of free enterprise like his colleagues, he saw ideology as secondary if in the way of his objectives. He had little time for those who objected to plans that were for the betterment of South Australia, despite these plans being contrary to particular interpretations of party ideology. The struggle for Leigh Creek was seen as a critical point in Playford's premiership; a second legislative failure was seen as being potentially fatal for Playford's leadership of his party, but the successful passage of the bill enhanced his image and gave himi enduring control over his party for the rest of his career, although it angered some of the staunch LCL conservatives in the upper house for some time; a significant number of them refused to talk to Playford for a substantial period of time thereafter.

During the post-war boom, the methods used to set up business in South Australia were unique. Playford's government would charge little to no business tax, supply cheap electricity, land and water, and have the Housing Trust build the factories and workers' homes. Consumer goods and automotive factories were created in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide; mining, steel and shipbuilding industries appeared in the 'Iron Triangle' towns of <a href="Whyalla%2C%20South%20Australia">Whyalla</a>, <a href="Port%20Pirie%2C%20South%20Australia">Port Pirie</a> and <a href="Port%20Augusta%2C%20South%20Australia">Port Augusta</a>. Prices and wages were kept relatively low to enable continued investment, and South Australia was slower than the other states to abolish these wartime measures to increase its industrial competitiveness. The government initiatives managed to overcome the large logistic burden, as Adelaide and South Australia were far from the markets where the goods would be sold.

The Housing Trust was a key plank in Playford's campaign to keep costs low and promote investment. By providing cheap housing, workers could also be persuaded to accept lower salaries, therefore keeping production costs down. In 1940, Playford introduced the Housing Improvement Act to parliament, having seen the benefits of the Housing Trust's activities. The main aims of the legislation were "to improve the adverse housing conditions" by replacing "insanitary, old, crowded, or obsolete dwelling houses" with better-quality buildings—at the time many older residences in the city centre were made of corrugated iron and many areas were slum-like. The law forced landlords to provide a minimum standard of housing and enacted rent controls, setting a maximum rent for various houses; at the time many landlords bought large numbers of low-quality dwellings and charged tenants exorbitant prices. It also expanded the role of the Housing Trust, potentially undercutting the rentier class. Labor were taken aback by Playford's move, as this was the start of a trend whereby the nominally conservative government pursued policies that were more left-wing than other Labor governments across the country. After expressing shock at Playford's "loving kindness to the poor and distressed", Labor helped to get the legislation—which threatened the interests of the landlord class that traditionally supported the LCL—passed into law. During one 15-year period, Housing Trust rents were not increased once despite steady inflation.

Many of the methods that Playford used were described by economic conservatives as 'socialism', drawing opposition from within his own party, especially in the Legislative Council. It is even said that the Liberal leader in that chamber—Sir <a href="Collier%20Cudmore">Collier Cudmore</a>—once referred to Playford as a '<a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>'. The unique economic intervention earned Playford scorn from his own colleagues, but the Labor movement was much more receptive. Indeed, Labor leader <a href="Mick%20O%27Halloran">Mick O'Halloran</a> would dine with Playford on a weekly basis to discuss the development of the state, and the pair were on close personal terms. At a dinner party, O'Halloran remarked that "I wouldn't want to be Premier even if I could be. Tom Playford can often do more for my own voters than I could if I were in his shoes." O'Halloran's lack of ambition was mocked in a political cartoon, but the Labor leader took the piece as a compliment and had it framed and put on display. As Playford had more opposition from his LCL colleagues in the upper house than Labor, O'Halloran was often described as the premier's 'junior partner". Playford called Labor "our Opposition", in comparison to opponents in his party, which he decried as being "critical without being helpful". This cooperative nature of party politics would not change until <a href="Don%20Dunstan">Don Dunstan</a>'s prominence in the late 1950s, when Playford would be assailed not for his economics, but for his government's comparatively low expenditure on public services such as education and healthcare.

Large projects were commenced. The city of <a href="Elizabeth%2C%20South%20Australia">Elizabeth</a> was built by the Housing Trust in Adelaide's north, for the production of <a href="General%20Motors">GM</a> <a href="Holden">Holden</a> motor vehicles. Populated mainly by working-class <a href="English%20people">English</a> migrants, it was, before its eventual economic and social decline, a showcase of successful city planning.

Playford also successfully coaxed <a href="Chrysler">Chrysler</a> to stay in Adelaide and expand its operations. The Housing Trust sold the <a href="Tonsley%20Park">Tonsley Park</a> where the car manufacturing plant was set up, and helped to install railyards, electricity and water infrastructure there, as it had done at Elizabeth. By the time Playford left office, Holden and Chrysler employed around 11,000 workers, 11% of the state's manufacturing employees. After earlier failed attempts to bring a tyre factory to Adelaide, the plans to build the <a href="Port%20Stanvac%2C%20South%20Australia">Port Stanvac</a> oil refinery—which would produce hydrocarbons used in synthetic rubber—in the early 1960s were enough to convince both a Dunlop Rubber-Olympic joint venture and SA Rubber Mills (later Bridgestone Australia) to start manufacturing operations.

Playford also sought to involve South Australia in <a href="uranium%20mining">uranium mining</a>, which he saw as both a means of providing electricity for powering industrial development, and as a means of ensconcing the state in the anti-communist alliance in the midst of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. He was supported his venture by federal subsidies and concessions. After the deposits at <a href="Mount%20Painter">Mount Painter</a> were deemed to be unsuitable, the focus turned to <a href="Radium%20Hill">Radium Hill</a> and significant state government money was invested into research. State and federal laws were changed to allow for mining at Radium Hill and exportation of uranium; Playford also publicly advocated for <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear power</a>. Rewards were offered for the discovery of uranium deposits, but no suitable reserves were found, so Radium Hill was the only project to proceed. The <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> had just erupted, and the American government was anxious to secure uranium for nuclear weapons. Playford was able to exploit this to secure "the easiest and most generous [deal] in the history of uranium negotiations". It was the highest purchase of uranium the Americans made during the Cold War and they contributed £4m for infrastructure development. Mining started in November 1954, and lasted for the seven-year-period of the contract with the Americans. Almost a million tonnes of ore had been mined, amounting to nearly £16m in contracts. Radium Hill had made a profit but was closed as higher-grade alternatives were discovered elsewhere and a new buyer could not be found. Playford also attempted to have the <a href="Australian%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Australian Atomic Energy Commission</a> based in the state, but failed; the nation's only nuclear reactor was built at <a href="Lucas%20Heights%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Lucas Heights</a> on the outskirts of <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>.

When Playford left office in 1965, South Australia's population had doubled from 600,000 in the late 1930s to 1.1 million, the highest proportionate rate among the <a href="States%20and%20territories%20of%20Australia">states</a>. The economy had done likewise, and personal wealth had increased at the same rate, second only to <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>. During Playford's 27 years in power, employment in manufacturing in South Australia had increased by 173%; <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> was in second place with 155% growth, while the national average was during the period was 129%. The state's share of Australia's manufacturing sector increased from 7.7 to 9.2%. However, there was criticism that Playford had diversified secondary industries enough, that industrial growth was beginning to lag the other states in the last decade of his leadership, and that the reliance on automotive production—Holden and Chrysler were 15% of the economy—made the economy more vulnerable to shocks in the future. Playford was also criticised for his informal style and tendency to rely on a small circle of public servants, sidelining much of his cabinet and not leaving a legacy of industrial infrastructure. Blewett and Jaensch said that Playford's ""ad hoc" methods and personalised administration" had worked well but said he needed a "more sophisticated" approach in later years, and was unable to adapt.

At the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201953">1953 election</a>, the young lawyer <a href="Don%20Dunstan">Don Dunstan</a> was elected to the House of Assembly as the Labor member for <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Norwood">Norwood</a>, ousting the LCL incumbent. Playford had landed unexpectedly in his role as the undisputed leader of his party, while Dunstan was, from the start of his parliamentary career, a stand-out among his own ranks and an excellent orator in parliament. Dunstan and Playford were each other's principal antagonists.
Playford, used to cooperating with Labor leaders more than attacking them, sensed Dunstan's promise and, predicting that one day Dunstan would be at the helm, attempted to establish bonds. So, after a late session of parliament at night, Playford would give Dunstan a lift home in his car. As Dunstan's home was situated on George Street, <a href="Norwood%2C%20South%20Australia">Norwood</a>, it was only a small deviance from Playford's normal route to his home in Norton Summit. The topics that the two discussed were not ever completely revealed, yet Playford, according to Dunstan, would talk to him in a paternalistic manner. The two built up somewhat of a relationship and developed a respect for each other, but due to the strength of their respective views (Playford was a <a href="Liberal%20conservatism">liberal conservative</a>, Dunstan a <a href="Libertarian%20socialism">libertarian socialist</a>), did not establish the same type of bond that Playford had with earlier Laborites.

To face an opposition that was becoming uncooperative was not what Playford has expected, or could satisfactorily handle. Before the effect Dunstan had on Parliament, Playford would meet with Labor leaders to discuss bills, and ensure bipartisan support in the House of Assembly for them; there was little discordance on matters. The belligerents were previously only rural independent members.

Even while the economic boom continued, the LCL vote gradually declined after <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201941">1941</a>. The LCL never held more than 23 seats during Playford's tenure due to being almost nonexistent in Adelaide. With few exceptions, its support in the capital was limited to the eastern crescent and the <a href="Holdfast%20Bay">Holdfast Bay</a> area even at the height of Playford's power. It relied on favourable preferences from minor parties and independents and the malapportioned electoral system in order to stay in office. It did, however, win a majority of actual votes, barring <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201944">1944</a> and <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201953">1953</a>, on a two-party-preferred basis until <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201962">1962</a>. Knowing that the Playmander made a statewide campaign fruitless, Labor had begun to combat the Playmander by directing its efforts at individual seats. Slowly, seats were whittled away—the loss of Norwood in 1953 was followed by the losses of Murray, Millicent and Frome in 1956, and Mt Gambier and Wallaroo in 1957–8 by-elections. Playford's dominance over the party and his ignorance of the wishes of its broad membership base brought about a degree of disillusionment, and the party machine began to decay. The dominance stopped the emergence of a new generation of political talent, and had a "stultifying" effect. Although the Playmander ensured his ongoing electoral success, and Playford was credited with South Australia's economic success, the LCL polled a lower percentage than the corresponding Liberal government at federal level.

During this period, Prime Minister Menzies recommended that Playford be bestowed with a form of <a href="British%20honours%20system">honours</a>. Playford's wish was to be made a <a href="privy%20council">privy council</a>lor, yet, while entirely possible, if granted it would lead to demands from other state Premiers. Playford's grandfather had declined a <a href="Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">KCMG</a>, and Playford himself did initially, but under the influence of Menzies he eventually accepted the honour and was knighted in 1957, but this time a class above the KCMG; the GCMG.

In December 1958, an event that initially had nothing to do with Playford, occurred, and eventually intensified into a debacle that was regarded as a turning point in his premiership and marked the beginning of the end of his rule.

A young girl was found raped and murdered, and <a href="Max%20Stuart">Max Stuart</a>, an <a href="Indigenous%20Australian">Aborigine</a>, was convicted and sentenced to be executed only a month later, on the basis of a confession gained during interrogation, although he had protested his innocence in pidgin English. Stuart's lawyer claimed that the confession was forced, and appeals to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20South%20Australia">Supreme</a> and <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Courts</a> were dismissed. A linguist who investigated the case thought that the style of English in the confession was inconsistent with Stuart's background and speech. This aroused disquiet and objections against the fairness of the trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, and "The News" brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign. Soon, the case attracted international attention, some on the assumption that the legal system was racist. The former High Court Justice Sir <a href="John%20Latham%20%28judge%29">John Latham</a> also spoke out.

During this time, Stuart's execution had been delayed on multiple occasions. On 6 July, Playford and the Executive Council decided not to reprieve Stuart, and he was due to be executed the next day, but an appeal to the <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a> in London stalled proceedings again. However, this also failed. Labor then tried to introduce legislation to stall the hanging.

Amid loud outcry, Playford started a Royal Commission to review the case. However, two of the Commissioners appointed, Chief Justice <a href="Mellis%20Napier">Mellis Napier</a> and Justice <a href="Geoffrey%20Reed%20%28judge%29">Geoffrey Reed</a>, had already been involved, Napier as presiding judge in the Full Court appeal and Reed as the trial judge. This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias from the likes of the President of the <a href="Bar%20Council%20of%20India">Indian Bar Council</a>, the esteemed British judge <a href="Norman%20Birkett">Norman Birkett</a>, the leader of the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">United Kingdom Liberal Party</a> <a href="Jo%20Grimond">Jo Grimond</a> and former British Prime Minister <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>. Years later, Playford admitted that he erred in his appointments of Reed and Napier and that it could have shaken public confidence on the fairness of the hearing.

The Royal Commission began its work and the proceedings were followed closely and eagerly debated by the public. As Playford had not shown an inclination to commute Stuart's sentence, Dunstan introduced a bill to abolish <a href="capital%20punishment">capital punishment</a>. The vote was split along party lines and was thus defeated, but Dunstan used the opportunity to attack the Playmander with much effect in the media, portraying the failed legislation as an unjust triumph of a malapportioned minority who had a vengeance mentality over an electorally repressed majority who wanted a humane outcome.

Amid the continuing uproar, Playford decided to grant clemency. He gave no reason for his decision. The Royal Commission continued its work and concluded that the guilty verdict was sound. Although a majority of those who spoke out against the handling of the matter thought that Stuart was probably guilty, the events provoked heated and bitter debate in South Australian society and destabilised Playford's administration. According to <a href="Ken%20Inglis">Ken Inglis</a>, "most of the responsibility for letting the ... general controversy ... [lies with] Sir Thomas Playford and his ministers ... [Theirs] was the response of men who were convinced that the affairs of the society were in good hands, and that only the naive and the mischievous would either doubt this general truth or challenge any particular application of it." Blewett and Jaensch said that the "clumsy handling" of the case was a manifestation of "the inevitable hubris of men too long in power".

Playford was confronted with an economic recession when he went into the election of 1962. Earlier, in late 1961, the federal <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal</a>-<a href="National%20Party%20of%20Australia">Country</a> coalition suffered a 13-seat swing and barely held onto government. Menzies' majority was slashed from 32 to 2. In the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201962">1962 election</a>, the Labor Party gained 54.3% of the two-party-preferred vote to the LCL's 45.7 percent. However, due to the Playmander, this was only enough to net Labor 19 seats to the LCL's 18. The balance of power rested with two independents, <a href="Tom%20Stott">Tom Stott</a> and <a href="Percy%20Quirke">Percy Quirke</a>. On election night, it was thought that Playford's long tenure was over, but he did not concede. There was speculation that Playford would let an inexperienced Labor form a minority government as the economic difficulties might make it a <a href="poisoned%20chalice">poisoned chalice</a>. After a week of silence he said he would not resign, and would see how the independents lined up when parliament reconvened. Labor needed the support of only one of the independents to make its leader, <a href="Frank%20Walsh">Frank Walsh</a>, premier, while the LCL needed them both for a 10th term in government They swung their support behind Playford and allowed his government to continue for another term; in return Quirke joined the LCL and was appointed to cabinet, while Stott was appointed speaker. Nonetheless, much media fanfare was made of the result, and of the detrimental effects of the 'Playmander'. Walsh declared the result "a travesty of electoral injustice" and lobbied the governor to not invite Playford to form government, to no avail. The election showed just how distorted the Playmander had become. Adelaide now accounted for two-thirds of the state's population, but a country vote was effectively worth two to 10 times a vote in Adelaide.

Electoral legislation remained unchanged. Labor introduced bills for reform, but these were defeated in both houses of Parliament. The premier introduced electoral legislation that would have entrenched his government further than under the Playmander. As electoral legislation was part of the South Australian constitution, it required an absolute parliamentary majority (20 seats, under the current system) to be changed. The LCL relied on Stott in the house, so Labor could obstruct changes by keeping members away and forcing a <a href="pair%20%28parliamentary%20convention%29">pair</a>.

While the political situation was becoming increasingly untenable, Playford himself continued with his job of building the state. Plans for Adelaide's future development, including a road transport plan, were commissioned. Playford saw a modern road transport system as crucial to continuing the industrialisation of the state, and motor vehicle registrations, which had increased by a factor of 50 since the end of the war, required road expansion. The Metropolitan Plan, a 1962 publication of the Town Planning Committee called for the construction of 56 km of freeways and speculated that three times as much would be needed in future. However, most of this never materialised; only the <a href="South%20Eastern%20Freeway">South Eastern Freeway</a> was approved during Playford's term, and construction just after he left office. A more <a href="Metropolitan%20Adelaide%20Transport%20Study">ambitious plan for a freeway system was commissioned</a>, but the study was not completed until after Playford's departure and was scrapped by later governments due to widespread public objections to the proposed demolition of entire suburbs for interchanges. Playford was criticised for seeing roads only from an engineering and utilitarian standpoint and neglecting the social and community effects of such building. The state's population hit in the one million mark in 1963 and the <a href="Port%20Stanvac%2C%20South%20Australia">Port Stanvac</a> <a href="oil%20refinery">oil refinery</a> was completed. Adelaide's water supply was increased and the pipeline from Morgan to Whyalla was duplicated.

The economic success of Playford's administration also fuelled the rapid growth of an immigrant, working and middle-class whose social expectations differed markedly from his traditionalist stance, loosening his grip on power. The demographic changes brought on by Playford's successful economic policies increased the number of people who had rather different views to his on matters such as education, health, arts, the environment, gambling and alcohol. Blewett and Jaensch said "it can be argued that the development he fostered ultimately brought about his own political demise." The state's social fabric became more complex, but Playford was unable or unwilling to adapt to their more complicated policital desires.

Playford was known for his lack of funding for education, regarding it as a distraction from the industrialisation of the state. During this period, only the financial elite could afford a university education, and less than one percent of the population had a degree by the time Playford left office. Despite this, university attendance more than tripled, and secondary and technical school enrolments more than quintupled, far outstripping the 77% population growth during his time in office, as incomes—and hence access to education—rose steadily as the need for teenagers to find a job to help support the family declined. Although the government expenditure on education increased from 10 to 17% from 1945 to 1959, the number of teachers had only doubled by the time he left office, so class sizes increased. The premier's education policy was criticised for being too conservative and lacking in innovation. Playford also did not allow the teaching of <a href="languages%20other%20than%20English">languages other than English</a> in schools on the grounds that "English is good enough". Howell said that Playford's "prejudices...served to limit the capacity of many able South Australians to participate in trade negotiations or diplomatic work." University academics and Public Examinations Board called for the inclusion of biology and the broadening of senior high school curriculum to better prepare students for tertiary education, but were rebuffed. In 1963 the minimum school leaving age was raised to 15, but this was still lower than most states in Australia.

The premier was also known for his suspicious attitude towards the <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a> and tertiary education in general; many of their graduates moved interstate and he thought that scientific research done within the state was not sufficiently focussed on practical applications. The antipathy was mutual and originated from Playford's days as a backbencher, when he formally complained to the university about a lecture given by a political science professor about <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>. Playford saw the discussion of such a topic as misuse of public funds for promotion of socialism, and his continued outspokenness about political curricula angered academics, who saw it as an attempt to curtail intellectual freedom. One <a href="chancellor%20%28education%29">vice-chancellor</a> was angered to the point of telling a senior public servant that Playford "an uneducated country colonial". Playford also opposed the establishment of a second university in the state as the population increased. While academics thought that another institution would bring more academic diversity, Playford thought this would increase competition for resources, so he allowed only a new campus of the University of Adelaide, which became <a href="Flinders%20University">Flinders University</a> after his departure from power. In his defence, Playford pointed that he had never rejected a funding request since the state took responsibility for universities in 1951, and that his proportional expenditure on tertiary education matched that of other states.

During Playford's rule, hospitals were overcrowded and the <a href="Royal%20Adelaide%20Hospital">Royal Adelaide Hospital</a>'s beds were crammed together with a density twice higher than developed world standards. After a media exposé and criticism from health sector professionals, two more hospitals were built in the western and northern suburbs of Adelaide respectively. Playford's attitude to social welfare was also criticised. He said that it was up to charity, not the government, to support orphans and disadvantaged sectors of the community so that they could enjoy a better standard of living. Spending on social welfare lagged behind that in other states, and legislative reforms on this front were non-existent.

Arts, which Playford showed no personal interest in, and regarded as "frills not fundamentals" and "non-productive", became a more prominent issue among the emerging middle-class. For his attitude, Playford was often mocked by his opponents and critics for his "philistinism". The "Nation" derisorily quipped that "It is axiomatic that the Premier draws his orchard spray gun at the mention of the word 'culture'". Sir <a href="Arthur%20Rymill">Arthur Rymill</a>, an LCL member of the upper house, criticised the demolition of the Theatre Royal, lobbied Playford for increased funding without success, pointing out that world-class performing arts venues were generally subsidised by the government. <a href="Hurtle%20Morphett">Hurtle Morphett</a>, a former State President of the LCL, quipped that if Playford "had wanted to convert the Art Gallery on North Terrace into a power house he would have done it without hesitation". In the 1960s, the <a href="Adelaide%20Festival">Adelaide Festival</a> started, while the <a href="Australian%20Dance%20Theatre">Australian Dance Theatre</a> and the <a href="State%20Theatre%20Company%20of%20South%20Australia">State Theatre Company of South Australia</a> was founded in the capital, with minimal assistance from Playford's government. The festival was well-received despite the effect of censorship in a state well known for social conservatism. With the success of the festival, public interest in arts increased, and with increasing calls for government funding, particularly from Dunstan, Playford finally agreed to fund the "non-productive area" in 1963 by allocating funding for the eventual building of the <a href="Festival%20Centre">Festival Centre</a>.

Playford's focus on development above all also led to controversy over heritage preservation. In 1955, the <a href="City%20of%20Adelaide">City of Adelaide</a> legislated to rezone much of the city centre from residential to commercial land for office blocks. Many older houses, as well as the Exhibition Building were demolished, sparking calls by many parliamentarians, Dunstan prominent among them, for Playford to intercede to preserve the historic character of the city. The premier was unmoved, backing the redevelopment and claiming that many of the demolished structures were "substandard".

While Playford was known for his use of price controls to restrain the price of living and therefore attract blue-collar workers to settle in the state and fuel industrialisation, South Australia was slow to introduce consumer protection laws in regards to quality control. It was believed that he was opposed to compulsory <a href="pasteurisation">pasteurisation</a> and other quality standards on milk to avoid offending his rural support base. Playford's reluctance to introduce regulations for tradesmen such as builders, electricians and plumbers were often seen to have resulted from his being a keen do-it-yourself handyman.

The conservatism of the Liberal and Country League did not keep up with the expectations of a modern-day society. There was dissatisfaction with the restrictive drinking laws; environmentalists campaigned for more natural parks and more 'green' practices; police powers stood strong, 'no loitering' legislation remained in place; gambling was almost completely restricted. The constituents who loudly demanded changes were mostly immigrants and their offspring, used to more <a href="libertine">libertine</a> conditions in their countries of origin. Their homes, usually built by the Housing Trust, sprawled into 'rural' electoral districts that were controlled by the League. Labor pledged to introduce social legislation to meet their demands; Playford, who did not drink, smoke or gamble, had no interest in doing so. His own candidates knew that the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201965">1965 election</a> would be unwinnable if Playford did not budge. The economy was still going strong and incomes were still increasing, so the Premier did not change his position on social reform.

Playford went into the 1965 election confident that he would build upon his previous result. Labor was continuing its practice of concentrating on individual seats: this time the effort was invested in the electorates of Barossa and Glenelg. In Barossa, northern Adelaide urban sprawl was overflowing into an otherwise rural and conservative electorate; in Glenelg, a younger generation of professionals and their families were settling. On election day, 6 March, both seats fell to Labor with substantial swings. The LCL lost power for the first time in 35 years. In seats that were contested by both parties, Labor led on the primary vote with 52.7 to 43.3%. Playford stayed up on the night to see the result, and conceded defeat at midnight. He appeared calm when announcing the loss to the public, but wept when he told his family of it. Playford had been premier for 26 years and 126 days.

After the loss, there were calls for Playford to be offered the post of Governor of South Australia or Governor-General of Australia, but nothing came of that. Playford continued to lead the LCL opposition for a further one and a half years until he relinquished the leadership. In the subsequent ballot, <a href="Steele%20Hall">Steele Hall</a>, a small farmer like Playford, won and led the LCL to victory at the following election with the <a href="Playmander">Playmander</a> still in place. Contrary to perceptions, Playford was loath to favour or groom a successor, and he did not publicly hint at whom he voted for in the leadership ballot; there was speculation that the former premier may have been one of those who abstained from the vote. Playford retired from politics at the same time, presumably for reasons of age, but stated that "I couldn't cope with the change in the attitudes of some MPs, even some in the highest places... I found I could no longer cope with the change... I can't handle a liar who doesn't turn a hair while he's lying... I decided I couldn't take it any longer".

Playford retired from Parliament with a pension of $72 a week; he had resisted giving higher pensions to Ministers or longer-serving MPs throughout his tenure. Regardless of what people thought of the <a href="Playmander">Playmander</a>, Playford was held in high regard for his integrity; during his premiership, there were no complaints of corruption or government largesse. Playford also prohibited his ministers from sitting on the board of directors of public companies or owning shares, lest they became conflicted in their decision-making. He returned to his orchard at Norton Summit, and took a continued interest in South Australian politics, but did not typically raise his opinions publicly; he was still consulted in private by Liberals up until his death, however. His closeness to Labor figures did not end either, offering advice to their new South Australian ministers, and assisting in a memorial to the former Labor Prime Minister <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a>. In line with his reputation for promoting his state, Playford also privately lobbied the Liberal government in Canberra on behalf of the state Labor administration for more infrastructure funding. In 1977, when Don Dunstan celebrated his 50th birthday party, Playford was the only Liberal invited. There he socialised with former and future Labor Prime Ministers <a href="Gough%20Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a> and <a href="Bob%20Hawke">Bob Hawke</a>, Dunstan, and other Laborites.

He served on the boards of the <a href="Electricity%20Trust%20of%20South%20Australia">Electricity Trust</a> and the <a href="South%20Australian%20Housing%20Trust">Housing Trust</a>, among others. Here, unused to not being in absolute control, and having little specific scientific knowledge, he occasionally stumbled in his decisions. This also created difficulties with the other board members, who were reluctant to disagree with their former boss, regardless of their expertise. But his thrift, a theme throughout his Premiership, did not abate; he was constantly forcing the trusts to use cost-saving methods and old vehicles for their work. This extended to his family property; he vigorously opposed his son's desire to install a new irrigation system in the orchard.

Playford had begun experiencing serious health problems since his first heart attack in June 1971, and underwent treatment and procedures for ten years. On 16 June 1981, he experienced a massive heart attack and died. Two days later his memorial service was held at the <a href="Flinders%20Street%20Baptist%20Church">Flinders Street Baptist Church</a>. The funeral procession carried his coffin from the city, along Magill and Old Norton Summit Roads where thousands turned out to pay their respects, to the Norton Summit cemetery where his forebears had been buried. There his gravestone was emblazoned with the phrase: 'a good man who did good things'.

She Shoulda Said No!

She Shoulda Said No! (also known as Wild Weed; The Devil's Weed; Marijuana, the Devil's Weed; and The Story of Lila Leeds and Her Exposé of the Marijuana Racket) is a 1949 <a href="exploitation%20film">exploitation film</a> that follows in the spirit of <a href="morality%20play">morality tales</a> such as the 1936 films "<a href="Reefer%20Madness">Reefer Madness</a>" and "<a href="Marihuana%20%28film%29">Marihuana</a>". Directed by <a href="Sam%20Newfield">Sam Newfield</a> (using the pseudonym "Sherman Scott") and starring <a href="Lila%20Leeds">Lila Leeds</a>, it was originally produced to capitalize on the arrest of Leeds and <a href="Robert%20Mitchum">Robert Mitchum</a> on a charge of <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">marijuana</a> conspiracy.

The film was issued under many titles; it struggled to find a <a href="film%20distribution">distributor</a> until film presenter <a href="Kroger%20Babb">Kroger Babb</a> picked up the rights, reissuing it as "The Story of Lila Leeds and Her Exposé of the Marijuana Racket". Its relative success came only after the promotional <a href="film%20poster">posters</a> were redone and a story fabricated that the film was being presented in conjunction with the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">United States Treasury</a>.

Leeds' character is "Anne Lester", a young orphan trying to pay for her brother's college education. After meeting Markey, a drug dealer, Anne begins to believe that she must smoke marijuana to fit in with her friends. She then goes to a "tea party", where she tries the drug for the first time. She is unaffected by the initial experiment, and loses her fear of drugs as she continues to use it willingly.

Anne's drug use results in the loss of many of her inhibitions, and the film shows her actions under the influence, including scenes implying sexual promiscuity. As the film progresses, she is fired from her job and begins selling drugs for Markey. Her brother hangs himself when he learns of her new job, and she is arrested and given a tour of the various <a href="psychiatric%20hospital">psychiatric wards</a> and jails in which drug users end up. Finally, after 50 days in jail, she is released, <a href="drug%20rehabilitation">cleaned up</a> and ready to cooperate with the authorities regarding Markey.

The film itself is semi-<a href="biographical%20film">biographical</a>, its story following what Leeds herself experienced. The film was inspired by the highly publicized arrest of movie stars <a href="Robert%20Mitchum">Robert Mitchum</a> and Leeds for marijuana possession. On September 1, 1948, the actors, along with two others, were arrested after being caught smoking marijuana at the home of Leeds in the early morning, and were charged with the felony of narcotics possession. Leeds was sentenced to sixty days in prison and placed on probation for five years.

Upon her release, Leeds struggled to find work in <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a>, and signed on to star in "Wild Weed". During publicity for the film in 1949, Leeds, who had been 20 at the time of the arrest, said that appearing in the picture would keep other people her age from trying drugs, but in 1952 she confided in "<a href="Collier%27s%20Weekly">Collier's</a>" that she "only had one offer… which was an obvious attempt to capitalize on the Mitchum case notoriety. I took it. I was broke." The film gained approval from the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Narcotics">Federal Bureau of Narcotics</a> to use the drug references, a standard practice at the time even though the Bureau had no power to <a href="Film%20censorship%20in%20the%20United%20States">censor</a> the films. The film used its plot to push many of the beliefs of the time: that drug-using youth would turn to crime and the theory of "marijuana as a <a href="gateway%20drug">gateway drug</a>". The latter was a leading argument for <a href="prohibition%20%28drugs%29">drug prohibition</a> during the era, and an argument that Leeds herself made, based on her own history with marijuana and <a href="heroin">heroin</a>.
Via Franklin Productions, Kay filmed the production in six days, a common occurrence given that most films of the era were shot with a quick turnaround. Eureka Productions initially distributed the film, but it struggled to find an audience until Kroger Babb's Hallmark Productions acquired the rights for distribution. Babb initially marketed the film under the title "The Story of Lila Leeds and Her Exposé of the Marijuana Racket", but failed to achieve success with that title and eventually changed it to ""She Shoulda Said 'No'!"". He pushed the sensuality of Leeds with new promotional photographs and a new <a href="tagline">tagline</a>: "How Bad Can a Good Girl Get... without losing her virtue or respect???", while sending letters to local communities falsely claiming that the United States Treasury Department implored Hallmark to release the film "in as many towns and cities as possible in the shortest possible length of time" as a public service. The <a href="square-up">square-up</a> misleadingly stated that the producers wished to "publicly acknowledge the splendid cooperation of the Nation's narcotic experts and Government departments, who aided in various ways the success of this production…. If its presentation saves but one young girl or boy from becoming a 'dope fiend' – then its story has been well told."

Babb, who gained notoriety for his various marketing gimmicks, occasionally had Leeds make appearances and give lectures at showings of the film. Babb often booked the movie as a midnight presentation twice a week in the same town; <a href="David%20F.%20Friedman">David F. Friedman</a>, who would later use the film in his own double-billings, attributed the distribution plan to a film that was so low in quality that Babb wanted to cash in and move to his next stop as fast as possible.

According to Friedman, Babb's presentations of the film made more money than any other film the same theater would showcase over a typical film's full booking. While actual dollar figures are not available because of the nature of the genre (which was known for poor record keeping and unconventional distribution practices), the general financial success of ""She Shoulda Said 'No'!"" prompted producers, in 1951, to import a similar film from Argentina titled "<a href="The%20Marihuana%20Story">The Marihuana Story</a>". That film, about a doctor who goes undercover into the world of drug addicts to learn about his wife's death only to become addicted to marijuana himself, was not as successful as other exploitation-style efforts as the public was more concerned about drug use by younger people.

""She Shoulda Said 'No'!"" was not well-received critically upon its initial release, with "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" saying, "Never did vice seem so devoid of enchantment." Production and distribution of drug films slowed considerably following the film's run until <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>'s "<a href="The%20Man%20with%20the%20Golden%20Arm">The Man with the Golden Arm</a>" forced changes to the <a href="Production%20Code">Production Code</a>, which was a <a href="film%20studio">studio</a>-based system which regulated various aspects of objectionable content in films.

The film achieved some attention due to its <a href="B%20movie">B movie</a> status over the years, being featured in a number of film compilations while continuing to focus on the salacious material as a selling point. In 1993, a <a href="VHS">VHS</a> version was released as part of "David Friedman's Roadshow Rarities", the twenty-ninth volume in the <a href="Something%20Weird%20Video">Something Weird</a> video series. Alpha Video Distributors released the film on DVD in 2006.

Charles Darwin

Charles Robert Darwin, (; 12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English <a href="natural%20history%23Before%201900">naturalist</a>, <a href="geologist">geologist</a> and <a href="biologist">biologist</a>, best known for his contributions to the science of <a href="evolution">evolution</a>. His proposition that all species of life have descended over time from <a href="common%20ancestors">common ancestors</a> is now widely accepted, and considered a foundational concept in science. In a joint publication with <a href="Alfred%20Russel%20Wallace">Alfred Russel Wallace</a>, he introduced his scientific theory that this <a href="Phylogenetics">branching pattern</a> of <a href="evolution">evolution</a> resulted from a process that he called <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>, in which the <a href="struggle%20for%20existence">struggle for existence</a> has a similar effect to the <a href="artificial%20selection">artificial selection</a> involved in <a href="selective%20breeding">selective breeding</a>.

Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>", overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of <a href="transmutation%20of%20species">transmutation of species</a>. By the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted <a href="evolution%20as%20theory%20and%20fact">evolution as a fact</a>. However, many favoured <a href="The%20eclipse%20of%20Darwinism">competing explanations</a> and it was not until the emergence of the <a href="modern%20synthesis%20%2820th%20century%29">modern evolutionary synthesis</a> from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the <a href="life%20sciences">life sciences</a>, explaining the <a href="diversity%20of%20life">diversity of life</a>.

Darwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh%20Medical%20School">University of Edinburgh</a>; instead, he helped to investigate <a href="marine%20invertebrates">marine invertebrates</a>. Studies at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> (<a href="Christ%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Christ's College</a>) encouraged his passion for <a href="natural%20science">natural science</a>. His <a href="Second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle">five-year voyage</a> on established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a>'s <a href="uniformitarian">uniformitarian</a> ideas, and publication of his <a href="The%20Voyage%20of%20the%20Beagle">journal of the voyage</a> made him famous as a popular author.

Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations, and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of <a href="On%20the%20Tendency%20of%20Species%20to%20form%20Varieties%3B%20and%20on%20the%20Perpetuation%20of%20Varieties%20and%20Species%20by%20Natural%20Means%20of%20Selection">both of their theories</a>. Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature. In 1871 he examined <a href="human%20evolution">human evolution</a> and <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a> in "<a href="The%20Descent%20of%20Man%2C%20and%20Selection%20in%20Relation%20to%20Sex">The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</a>", followed by "<a href="The%20Expression%20of%20the%20Emotions%20in%20Man%20and%20Animals">The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</a>" (1872). His research on plants was published in a series of books, and in his final book, <a href="The%20Formation%20of%20Vegetable%20Mould%20through%20the%20Action%20of%20Worms">"The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Actions of Worms"</a> (1881), he examined <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s and their effect on soil.

Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and he was honoured by <a href="Burials%20and%20memorials%20in%20Westminster%20Abbey">burial in Westminster Abbey</a>.

Since 2008, a statue of Charles Darwin occupies the place of honour at <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">London's Natural History Museum</a>.

Charles Robert Darwin was born in <a href="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a>, Shropshire, on 12 February 1809, at his family's home, <a href="The%20Mount%2C%20Shrewsbury">The Mount</a>. He was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier <a href="Robert%20Darwin">Robert Darwin</a> and <a href="Susannah%20Darwin">Susannah Darwin</a> ("née" Wedgwood). He was the grandson of two prominent <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">abolitionists</a>: <a href="Erasmus%20Darwin">Erasmus Darwin</a> on his father's side, and <a href="Josiah%20Wedgwood">Josiah Wedgwood</a> on his mother's side.
Both families were largely <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a>, though the Wedgwoods were adopting <a href="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a>. Robert Darwin, himself quietly a <a href="Freethought%23England%20and%20France">freethinker</a>, had baby Charles <a href="baptism">baptised</a> in November 1809 in the Anglican <a href="St%20Chad%27s%20Church%2C%20Shrewsbury">St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury</a>, but Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles already had a taste for natural history and collecting when he joined the day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother <a href="Erasmus%20Alvey%20Darwin">Erasmus</a> attending the nearby Anglican <a href="Shrewsbury%20School">Shrewsbury School</a> as a <a href="boarding%20school">boarder</a>.

Darwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire, before going to the <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh%20Medical%20School">University of Edinburgh Medical School</a> (at the time the best medical school in the UK) with his brother Erasmus in October 1825. Darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies. He learned <a href="taxidermy">taxidermy</a> in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from <a href="John%20Edmonstone">John Edmonstone</a>, a freed black slave who had accompanied <a href="Charles%20Waterton">Charles Waterton</a> in the South American <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>.

In Darwin's second year at the university he joined the <a href="Plinian%20Society">Plinian Society</a>, a student <a href="natural%20history">natural-history</a> group featuring lively debates in which <a href="radicalism%20%28historical%29%23Popular%20agitation">radical democratic</a> students with <a href="materialism">materialistic</a> views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science. He assisted <a href="Robert%20Edmond%20Grant">Robert Edmond Grant</a>'s investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of <a href="marine%20invertebrates">marine invertebrates</a> in the <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a>, and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in <a href="oyster">oyster</a> shells were the eggs of a skate <a href="leech">leech</a>. One day, Grant praised <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lamarck">Lamarck</a>'s <a href="Lamarckism">evolutionary ideas</a>. Darwin was astonished by Grant's audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus' journals. Darwin was rather bored by <a href="Robert%20Jameson">Robert Jameson</a>'s natural-history course, which covered geology—including the debate between <a href="Neptunism">Neptunism</a> and <a href="Plutonism">Plutonism</a>. He learned the <a href="alpha%20taxonomy">classification</a> of plants, and assisted with work on the collections of the <a href="Royal%20Museum">University Museum</a>, one of the largest museums in Europe at the time.

Darwin's neglect of medical studies annoyed his father, who shrewdly sent him to <a href="Christ%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Christ's College, Cambridge</a>, to study for a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican country <a href="parson">parson</a>. As Darwin was unqualified for the "<a href="Tripos">Tripos</a>", he joined the "ordinary" degree course in January 1828. He preferred <a href="equestrianism">riding</a> and <a href="shooting%20sports">shooting</a> to studying. His cousin <a href="William%20Darwin%20Fox">William Darwin Fox</a> introduced him to the popular craze for <a href="beetle">beetle</a> collecting; Darwin pursued this zealously, getting some of his finds published in <a href="James%20Francis%20Stephens">James Francis Stephens</a>' "Illustrations of British entomology". He became a close friend and follower of botany professor <a href="John%20Stevens%20Henslow">John Stevens Henslow</a> and met other leading <a href="parson-naturalist">parson-naturalist</a>s who saw scientific work as religious <a href="natural%20theology">natural theology</a>, becoming known to these <a href="University%20don">dons</a> as "the man who walks with Henslow". When his own exams drew near, Darwin applied himself to his studies and was delighted by the language and logic of <a href="William%20Paley">William Paley</a>'s "Evidences of Christianity" (1794). In his final examination in January 1831 Darwin did well, coming tenth out of 178 candidates for the "ordinary" degree.

Darwin had to stay at Cambridge until June 1831. He studied Paley's "<a href="Natural%20Theology%20or%20Evidences%20of%20the%20Existence%20and%20Attributes%20of%20the%20Deity">Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity</a>" (first published in 1802), which made an <a href="teleological%20argument">argument for divine design in nature</a>, explaining <a href="adaptation">adaptation</a> as God acting through <a href="Physical%20law">laws of nature</a>. He read <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a>'s new book, "Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy" (1831), which described the highest aim of <a href="natural%20philosophy">natural philosophy</a> as understanding such laws through <a href="inductive%20reasoning">inductive reasoning</a> based on observation, and <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Alexander von Humboldt</a>'s "Personal Narrative" of scientific travels in 1799–1804. Inspired with "a burning zeal" to contribute, Darwin planned to visit <a href="Tenerife">Tenerife</a> with some classmates after graduation to study natural history in the <a href="tropics">tropics</a>. In preparation, he joined <a href="Adam%20Sedgwick">Adam Sedgwick</a>'s <a href="geology">geology</a> course, then on 4 August travelled with him to spend a fortnight mapping <a href="strata">strata</a> in <a href="Wales">Wales</a>.

After leaving Sedgwick in Wales, Darwin spent a week with student friends at <a href="Barmouth">Barmouth</a>, then returned home on 29 August to find a letter from Henslow proposing him as a suitable (if unfinished) <a href="natural%20history">naturalist</a> for a self-funded <a href="wikt%3Asupernumerary">supernumerary</a> place on with captain <a href="Robert%20FitzRoy">Robert FitzRoy</a>, emphasising that this was a position for a <a href="gentleman">gentleman</a> rather than "a mere collector". The ship was to leave in four weeks on an expedition to chart the coastline of South America. <a href="Robert%20Darwin">Robert Darwin</a> objected to his son's planned two-year voyage, regarding it as a waste of time, but was persuaded by his brother-in-law, <a href="Josiah%20Wedgwood%20II">Josiah Wedgwood II</a>, to agree to (and fund) his son's participation. Darwin took care to remain in a private capacity to retain control over his collection, intending it for a major scientific institution.

After delays, the voyage began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin spent most of that time on land investigating geology and making natural history collections, while HMS "Beagle" <a href="hydrography">surveyed and charted</a> coasts. He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and at intervals during the voyage his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of <a href="The%20Voyage%20of%20the%20Beagle">his journal</a> for his family. He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting <a href="marine%20invertebrates">marine invertebrates</a>, but in all other areas was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal. Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with <a href="plankton">plankton</a> collected in a calm spell.

On their first stop ashore at <a href="Santiago%2C%20Cape%20Verde">St Jago</a> in <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a>, Darwin found that a white band high in the <a href="volcanic%20rock">volcanic rock</a> cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy had given him the first volume of <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a>'s "Principles of Geology", which set out <a href="uniformitarian">uniformitarian</a> concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods, and Darwin saw things Lyell's way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology.
When they reached <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, Darwin was delighted by the <a href="Bahia%20coastal%20forests">tropical forest</a>, but detested the sight of <a href="slavery">slavery</a>, and disputed this issue with Fitzroy.

The survey continued to the south in <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a>. They stopped at <a href="Bah%C3%ADa%20Blanca">Bahía Blanca</a>, and in cliffs near <a href="Punta%20Alta">Punta Alta</a> Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s beside modern seashells, indicating recent <a href="extinction">extinction</a> with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He identified the little-known "<a href="Megatherium">Megatherium</a>" by a tooth and its association with bony armour, which had at first seemed to him to be like a giant version of the armour on local <a href="armadillo">armadillo</a>s. The finds brought great interest when they reached England.

On rides with <a href="gaucho">gaucho</a>s into the interior to explore geology and collect more fossils, Darwin gained social, political and <a href="anthropology">anthropological</a> insights into both native and colonial people at a time of revolution, and learnt that two types of <a href="rhea%20%28bird%29">rhea</a> had separate but overlapping territories. Further south, he saw stepped plains of shingle and seashells as <a href="raised%20beach">raised beach</a>es showing a series of elevations. He read Lyell's second volume and accepted its view of "centres of creation" of species, but his discoveries and theorising challenged Lyell's ideas of smooth continuity and of extinction of species.
Three Fuegians on board had been seized during the <a href="HMS%20Beagle%23First%20voyage">first "Beagle" voyage</a>, then during a year in England were educated as missionaries. Darwin found them friendly and civilised, yet at <a href="Tierra%20del%20Fuego">Tierra del Fuego</a> he met "miserable, degraded savages", as different as wild from domesticated animals. He remained convinced that, despite this diversity, all humans were interrelated with <a href="Monogenism">a shared origin</a> and potential for improvement towards civilisation. Unlike his scientist friends, he now thought there was no unbridgeable gap between humans and animals. A year on, the mission had been abandoned. The Fuegian they had named <a href="Jemmy%20Button">Jemmy Button</a> lived like the other natives, had a wife, and had no wish to return to England.

Darwin experienced <a href="1835%20Concepci%C3%B3n%20earthquake">an earthquake in Chile</a> and saw signs that the land had just been raised, including <a href="mussel">mussel</a>-beds stranded above high tide. High in the <a href="Andes">Andes</a> he saw seashells, and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach. He theorised that as the land rose, <a href="island">oceanic islands</a> sank, and <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a>s round them grew to form <a href="atoll">atoll</a>s.

On the geologically new <a href="Gal%C3%A1pagos%20Islands">Galápagos Islands</a>, Darwin looked for evidence attaching wildlife to an older "centre of creation", and found <a href="mockingbird">mockingbird</a>s allied to those in Chile but differing from island to island. He heard that slight variations in the shape of <a href="tortoise">tortoise</a> shells showed which island they came from, but failed to collect them, even after eating tortoises taken on board as food. In Australia, the <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a> <a href="Potoridae">rat-kangaroo</a> and the <a href="platypus">platypus</a> seemed so unusual that Darwin thought it was almost as though two distinct Creators had been at work. He found the <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Aborigines</a> "good-humoured & pleasant", and noted their depletion by European settlement.

FitzRoy investigated how the atolls of the <a href="Cocos%20%28Keeling%29%20Islands">Cocos (Keeling) Islands</a> had formed, and the survey supported Darwin's theorising. FitzRoy began writing the official "Narrative" of the "Beagle" voyages, and after reading Darwin's diary he proposed incorporating it into the account. Darwin's "<a href="The%20Voyage%20of%20the%20Beagle">Journal</a>" was eventually rewritten as a separate third volume, on natural history.

In <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, Darwin and FitzRoy met <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a>, who had recently written to Lyell praising his <a href="uniformitarianism">uniformitarianism</a> as opening bold speculation on "that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others" as "a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process".
When organising his notes as the ship sailed home, Darwin wrote that, if his growing suspicions about the mockingbirds, the tortoises and the <a href="Falkland%20Islands%20wolf">Falkland Islands fox</a> were correct, "such facts undermine the stability of Species", then cautiously added "would" before "undermine". He later wrote that such facts "seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species".

When the ship reached <a href="Falmouth%2C%20Cornwall">Falmouth, Cornwall</a>, on 2 October 1836, Darwin was already a celebrity in scientific circles as in December 1835 <a href="John%20Stevens%20Henslow">Henslow</a> had fostered his former pupil's reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of Darwin's geological letters. Darwin visited his home in Shrewsbury and saw relatives, then hurried to <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> to see Henslow, who advised him on finding naturalists available to catalogue the collections and agreed to take on the botanical specimens. Darwin's father organised investments, enabling his son to be a self-funded <a href="gentleman%20scientist">gentleman scientist</a>, and an excited Darwin went round the London institutions being fêted and seeking experts to describe the collections. Zoologists had a huge backlog of work, and there was a danger of specimens just being left in storage.

<a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a> eagerly met Darwin for the first time on 29 October and soon introduced him to the up-and-coming anatomist <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a>, who had the facilities of the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Surgeons%20of%20England">Royal College of Surgeons</a> to work on the fossil bones collected by Darwin. Owen's surprising results included other gigantic extinct <a href="ground%20sloth">ground sloth</a>s as well as the "<a href="Megatherium">Megatherium</a>", a near complete skeleton of the unknown "<a href="Scelidotherium">Scelidotherium</a>" and a <a href="hippopotamus">hippopotamus</a>-sized <a href="rodent">rodent</a>-like skull named "<a href="Toxodon">Toxodon</a>" resembling a giant <a href="capybara">capybara</a>. The armour fragments were actually from "<a href="Glyptodon">Glyptodon</a>", a huge armadillo-like creature as Darwin had initially thought. These extinct creatures were related to living species in South America.

In mid-December, Darwin took lodgings in Cambridge to organise work on his collections and rewrite his "Journal". He wrote his first paper, showing that the South American landmass was slowly rising, and with Lyell's enthusiastic backing read it to the <a href="Geological%20Society%20of%20London">Geological Society of London</a> on 4 January 1837. On the same day, he presented his mammal and bird specimens to the <a href="Zoological%20Society%20of%20London">Zoological Society</a>. The ornithologist <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> soon announced that the Galapagos birds that Darwin had thought a mixture of <a href="Common%20blackbird">blackbirds</a>, "<a href="Grosbeak">gros-beaks</a>" and <a href="finch">finch</a>es, were, in fact, twelve <a href="Darwin%27s%20finches">separate species of finches</a>. On 17 February, Darwin was elected to the Council of the Geological Society, and Lyell's presidential address presented Owen's findings on Darwin's fossils, stressing geographical continuity of species as supporting his uniformitarian ideas.

Early in March, Darwin moved to London to be near this work, joining Lyell's social circle of scientists and <a href="expert">expert</a>s such as <a href="Charles%20Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>, who described God as a programmer of laws. Darwin stayed with his <a href="freethought">freethinking</a> brother <a href="Erasmus%20Alvey%20Darwin">Erasmus</a>, part of this <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whig</a> circle and a close friend of the writer <a href="Harriet%20Martineau">Harriet Martineau</a>, who promoted <a href="Malthusianism">Malthusianism</a> underlying the controversial Whig <a href="Poor%20Law%20Amendment%20Act%201834">Poor Law reforms</a> to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty. As a Unitarian, she welcomed the <a href="radicalism%20%28historical%29">radical</a> implications of <a href="transmutation%20of%20species">transmutation of species</a>, promoted by <a href="Robert%20Edmond%20Grant">Grant</a> and younger surgeons influenced by <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Geoffroy%20Saint-Hilaire">Geoffroy</a>. Transmutation was anathema to Anglicans defending social order, but reputable scientists openly discussed the subject and there was wide interest in <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a>'s letter praising Lyell's approach as a way to find a <a href="Physical%20law">natural cause</a> of the origin of new species.

Gould met Darwin and told him that the Galápagos <a href="mockingbird">mockingbird</a>s from different islands were separate species, not just varieties, and what Darwin had thought was a "<a href="wren">wren</a>" was also <a href="Warbler-finch">in the finch group</a>. Darwin had not labelled the finches by island, but from the notes of others on the ship, including FitzRoy, he allocated species to islands. The two <a href="rhea%20%28bird%29">rheas</a> were also distinct species, and on 14 March Darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards.
By mid-March, Darwin was speculating in his "Red Notebook" on the possibility that "one species does change into another" to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as the rheas, and extinct ones such as the strange "<a href="Macrauchenia">Macrauchenia</a>", which resembled a giant <a href="guanaco">guanaco</a>. His thoughts on lifespan, <a href="asexual%20reproduction">asexual reproduction</a> and <a href="sexual%20reproduction">sexual reproduction</a> developed in his "B" notebook around mid-July on to variation in offspring "to adapt & alter the race to "changing" world" explaining the <a href="Gal%C3%A1pagos%20tortoise">Galápagos tortoise</a>s, mockingbirds and rheas. He sketched branching descent, then a <a href="genealogy">genealogical</a> branching of a single <a href="tree%20of%20life%20%28science%29">evolutionary tree</a>, in which "It is absurd to talk of one animal being higher than another", discarding Lamarck's independent <a href="lineage%20%28evolution%29">lineages</a> progressing to higher forms.

While developing this intensive study of <a href="transmutation%20of%20species">transmutation</a>, Darwin became mired in more work. Still rewriting his "Journal", he took on editing and publishing the expert reports on his collections, and with Henslow's help obtained a Treasury grant of <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>1,000 to sponsor this multi-volume "<a href="Zoology%20of%20the%20Voyage%20of%20H.M.S.%20Beagle">Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle</a>", a sum equivalent to about £ in 2017. He stretched the funding to include his planned books on geology, and agreed to unrealistic dates with the publisher. As the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a> began, Darwin pressed on with writing his "Journal", and in August 1837 began correcting <a href="Galley%20proof">printer's proofs</a>.

Darwin's health suffered under the pressure. On 20 September he had "an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart", so his doctors urged him to "knock off all work" and live in the country for a few weeks. After visiting Shrewsbury he joined his Wedgwood relatives at <a href="Maer%20Hall">Maer Hall</a>, Staffordshire, but found them too eager for tales of his travels to give him much rest. His charming, intelligent, and cultured cousin <a href="Emma%20Darwin">Emma Wedgwood</a>, nine months older than Darwin, was nursing his invalid aunt. His uncle <a href="Josiah%20Wedgwood%20II">Josiah</a> pointed out an area of ground where cinders had disappeared under <a href="loam">loam</a> and suggested that this might have been the work of <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s, inspiring "a new & important theory" on their role in <a href="pedogenesis">soil formation</a>, which Darwin presented at the Geological Society on 1 November.

<a href="William%20Whewell">William Whewell</a> pushed Darwin to take on the duties of Secretary of the Geological Society. After initially declining the work, he accepted the post in March 1838. Despite the grind of writing and editing the "Beagle" reports, Darwin made remarkable progress on transmutation, taking every opportunity to question expert naturalists and, unconventionally, people with practical experience such as farmers and <a href="pigeon%20keeping">pigeon fanciers</a>. Over time, his research drew on information from his relatives and children, the family butler, neighbours, colonists and former shipmates. He included mankind in his speculations from the outset, and on seeing an <a href="orangutan">orangutan</a> in the zoo on 28 March 1838 noted its childlike behaviour.
The strain took a toll, and by June he was being laid up for days on end with stomach problems, headaches and heart symptoms. For the rest of his life, he was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe <a href="boil">boil</a>s, palpitations, trembling and other symptoms, particularly during times of stress, such as attending meetings or making social visits. The cause of <a href="Charles%20Darwin%27s%20illness">Darwin's illness</a> remained unknown, and attempts at treatment had little success.

On 23 June, he took a break and went "geologising" in Scotland. He visited <a href="Glen%20Roy">Glen Roy</a> in glorious weather to see the parallel "roads" cut into the hillsides at three heights. He later published his view that these were marine <a href="raised%20beach">raised beach</a>es, but then had to accept that they were shorelines of a <a href="proglacial%20lake">proglacial lake</a>.

Fully recuperated, he returned to Shrewsbury in July. Used to jotting down daily notes on animal breeding, he scrawled rambling thoughts about career and prospects on two scraps of paper, one with columns headed ""Marry"" and ""Not Marry"". Advantages included "constant companion and a friend in old age ... better than a dog anyhow", against points such as "less money for books" and "terrible loss of time." Having decided in favour, he discussed it with his father, then went to visit Emma on 29 July. He did not get around to proposing, but against his father's advice he mentioned his ideas on transmutation.

Continuing his research in London, Darwin's wide reading now included the sixth edition of <a href="Thomas%20Malthus">Malthus</a>'s "<a href="An%20Essay%20on%20the%20Principle%20of%20Population">An Essay on the Principle of Population</a>", and on 28 September 1838 he noted its assertion that human "population, when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every twenty five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio", a <a href="geometric%20progression">geometric progression</a> so that population soon exceeds food supply in what is known as a <a href="Malthusian%20catastrophe">Malthusian catastrophe</a>. Darwin was well prepared to compare this to <a href="A.%20P.%20de%20Candolle">de Candolle</a>'s "warring of the species" of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost. He wrote that the "final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, & adapt it to changes", so that "One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying force into every kind of adapted structure into the gaps of in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones." This would result in the formation of new species. As he later wrote in his "<a href="The%20Autobiography%20of%20Charles%20Darwin">Autobiography</a>":

By mid December, Darwin saw a similarity between farmers picking the best stock in <a href="selective%20breeding">selective breeding</a>, and a Malthusian Nature selecting from chance variants so that "every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical and perfected", thinking this comparison "a beautiful part of my theory". He later called his theory <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>, an analogy with what he termed the <a href="artificial%20selection">artificial selection</a> of selective breeding.

On 11 November, he returned to Maer and proposed to Emma, once more telling her his ideas. She accepted, then in exchanges of loving letters she showed how she valued his openness in sharing their differences, also expressing her strong Unitarian beliefs and concerns that his honest doubts might separate them in the afterlife. While he was house-hunting in London, bouts of illness continued and Emma wrote urging him to get some rest, almost prophetically remarking "So don't be ill any more my dear Charley till I can be with you to nurse you." He found what they called "Macaw Cottage" (because of its gaudy interiors) in <a href="Gower%20Street%20%28London%29">Gower Street</a>, then moved his "museum" in over Christmas. On 24 January 1839, Darwin was <a href="List%20of%20Fellows%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society%20elected%20in%201839">elected a Fellow of the Royal Society</a> (FRS).

On 29 January, Darwin and Emma Wedgwood were married at Maer in an Anglican ceremony arranged to suit the Unitarians, then immediately caught the train to London and their new home.

Darwin now had the framework of his theory of natural selection "by which to work", as his "prime hobby". His research included extensive experimental selective breeding of plants and animals, finding evidence that species were not fixed and investigating many detailed ideas to refine and substantiate his theory. For fifteen years this work was in the background to his main occupation of writing on geology and publishing expert reports on the "Beagle" collections.

When FitzRoy's "Narrative" was published in May 1839, Darwin's "<a href="The%20Voyage%20of%20the%20Beagle">Journal and Remarks</a>" was such a success as the third volume that later that year it was published on its own. Early in 1842, Darwin wrote about his ideas to <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a>, who noted that his ally "denies seeing a beginning to each crop of species".

Darwin's book "<a href="The%20Structure%20and%20Distribution%20of%20Coral%20Reefs">The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs</a>" on his theory of <a href="atoll">atoll</a> formation was published in May 1842 after more than three years of work, and he then wrote his first "pencil sketch" of his theory of natural selection. To escape the pressures of London, the family moved to rural <a href="Down%20House">Down House</a> in September. On 11 January 1844, Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist <a href="Joseph%20Dalton%20Hooker">Joseph Dalton Hooker</a>, writing with melodramatic humour "it is like confessing a murder". Hooker replied "There may in my opinion have been a series of productions on different spots, & also a gradual change of species. I shall be delighted to hear how you think that this change may have taken place, as no presently conceived opinions satisfy me on the subject."

By July, Darwin had expanded his "sketch" into a 230-page "Essay", to be expanded with his research results if he died prematurely. In November, the anonymously published sensational best-seller "<a href="Vestiges%20of%20the%20Natural%20History%20of%20Creation">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</a>" brought wide interest in transmutation. Darwin scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but carefully reviewed his own arguments. Controversy erupted, and it continued to sell well despite contemptuous dismissal by scientists.

Darwin completed his third geological book in 1846. He now renewed a fascination and expertise in <a href="marine%20invertebrates">marine invertebrates</a>, dating back to his student days with <a href="Robert%20Edmond%20Grant">Grant</a>, by dissecting and classifying the <a href="barnacle">barnacle</a>s he had collected on the voyage, enjoying observing beautiful structures and thinking about comparisons with allied structures. In 1847, Hooker read the "Essay" and sent notes that provided Darwin with the calm critical feedback that he needed, but would not commit himself and questioned Darwin's opposition to continuing acts of <a href="creation%20myth">creation</a>.

In an attempt to improve his chronic ill health, Darwin went in 1849 to Dr. <a href="James%20Manby%20Gully">James Gully</a>'s <a href="Great%20Malvern">Malvern</a> spa and was surprised to find some benefit from <a href="hydrotherapy">hydrotherapy</a>. Then, in 1851, his treasured daughter <a href="Anne%20Darwin">Annie</a> fell ill, reawakening his fears that his illness might be hereditary, and after a long series of crises she died.

In eight years of work on <a href="barnacle">barnacle</a>s (Cirripedia), Darwin's theory helped him to find "<a href="homology%20%28biology%29">homologies</a>" showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and in some <a href="genus">genera</a> he found minute males <a href="parasitism">parasitic</a> on <a href="hermaphrodite">hermaphrodite</a>s, showing an <a href="Androdioecy">intermediate stage</a> in evolution of <a href="Gonochorism">distinct sexes</a>. In 1853, it earned him the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>'s Royal Medal, and it made his reputation as a <a href="biology">biologist</a>. In 1854 he became a Fellow of the <a href="Linnean%20Society%20of%20London">Linnean Society of London</a>, gaining postal access to its library. He began a major reassessment of his theory of species, and in November realised that divergence in the character of descendants could be explained by them becoming adapted to "diversified places in the economy of nature".

By the start of 1856, Darwin was investigating whether eggs and <a href="seed">seed</a>s could survive travel across seawater to spread species across oceans. <a href="Joseph%20Dalton%20Hooker">Hooker</a> increasingly doubted the traditional view that species were fixed, but their young friend <a href="Thomas%20Henry%20Huxley">Thomas Henry Huxley</a> was firmly against the transmutation of species. <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Lyell</a> was intrigued by Darwin's speculations without realising their extent. When he read a paper by <a href="Alfred%20Russel%20Wallace">Alfred Russel Wallace</a>, "On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species", he saw similarities with Darwin's thoughts and urged him to publish to establish precedence. Though Darwin saw no threat, on 14 May 1856 he began writing a short paper. Finding answers to difficult questions held him up repeatedly, and he expanded his plans to a "big book on species" titled "<a href="Natural%20Selection%20%28manuscript%29">Natural Selection</a>", which was to include his "note on Man". He continued his researches, <a href="Correspondence%20of%20Charles%20Darwin">obtaining information</a> and specimens from naturalists worldwide including Wallace who was working in <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>. In mid-1857 he added a section heading; "Theory applied to Races of Man", but did not add text on this topic. On 5 September 1857, Darwin sent the American botanist <a href="Asa%20Gray">Asa Gray</a> a detailed outline of his ideas, including an abstract of "Natural Selection", which omitted <a href="human%20evolution">human origins</a> and <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a>. In December, Darwin received a letter from Wallace asking if the book would examine human origins. He responded that he would avoid that subject, "so surrounded with prejudices", while encouraging Wallace's theorising and adding that "I go much further than you."

Darwin's book was only partly written when, on 18 June 1858, he received a paper from Wallace describing natural selection. Shocked that he had been "forestalled", Darwin sent it on that day to Lyell, as requested by Wallace, and although Wallace had not asked for publication, Darwin suggested he would send it to any journal that Wallace chose. His family was in crisis with children in the village dying of <a href="scarlet%20fever">scarlet fever</a>, and he put matters in the hands of his friends. After some discussion, Lyell and Hooker decided on a joint presentation at the <a href="Linnean%20Society%20of%20London">Linnean Society</a> on 1 July of "<a href="On%20the%20Tendency%20of%20Species%20to%20form%20Varieties%3B%20and%20on%20the%20Perpetuation%20of%20Varieties%20and%20Species%20by%20Natural%20Means%20of%20Selection">On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection</a>". On the evening of 28 June, Darwin's baby son died of scarlet fever after almost a week of severe illness, and he was too distraught to attend.

There was little immediate attention to this announcement of the theory; the president of the Linnean Society remarked in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any revolutionary discoveries. Only one review rankled enough for Darwin to recall it later; Professor <a href="Samuel%20Haughton">Samuel Haughton</a> of Dublin claimed that "all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old". Darwin struggled for thirteen months to produce an abstract of his "big book", suffering from ill health but getting constant encouragement from his scientific friends. Lyell arranged to have it published by <a href="John%20Murray%20%28publisher%29">John Murray</a>.

"<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>" proved unexpectedly popular, with the entire stock of 1,250 copies oversubscribed when it went on sale to booksellers on 22 November 1859. In the book, Darwin set out "one long argument" of detailed observations, inferences and consideration of anticipated objections. In making the case for <a href="common%20descent">common descent</a>, he included evidence of <a href="Homology%20%28biology%29">homologies</a> between humans and other mammals. Having outlined <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a>, he hinted that it could explain differences between <a href="Race%20%28human%20categorization%29">human races</a>. He avoided explicit discussion of human origins, but implied the significance of his work with the sentence; "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history." His theory is simply stated in the introduction:
At the end of the book he concluded that:
The last word was the only variant of "evolved" in the first five editions of the book. "<a href="Evolutionism">Evolutionism</a>" at that time was associated with other concepts, most commonly with <a href="Prenatal%20development%20%28biology%29">embryological development</a>, and Darwin first used the word <a href="evolution">evolution</a> in "<a href="The%20Descent%20of%20Man%2C%20and%20Selection%20in%20Relation%20to%20Sex">The Descent of Man</a>" in 1871, before adding it in 1872 to the 6th edition of "The Origin of Species".

The book aroused international interest, with less controversy than had greeted the popular "<a href="Vestiges%20of%20the%20Natural%20History%20of%20Creation">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</a>". Though Darwin's illness kept him away from the public debates, he eagerly scrutinised the scientific response, commenting on press cuttings, reviews, articles, satires and caricatures, and <a href="Correspondence%20of%20Charles%20Darwin">corresponded on it</a> with colleagues worldwide. The book did not explicitly discuss human origins, but included a number of hints about the animal ancestry of humans from which the inference could be made. The first review asked, "If a monkey has become a man–what may not a man become?" and said it should be left to theologians as it was too dangerous for ordinary readers. Amongst early favourable responses, Huxley's reviews swiped at <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a>, leader of the scientific establishment Huxley was trying to overthrow. In April, Owen's review attacked Darwin's friends and condescendingly dismissed his ideas, angering Darwin, but Owen and others began to promote ideas of supernaturally guided evolution. <a href="Patrick%20Matthew">Patrick Matthew</a> drew attention to his 1831 book which had a brief appendix suggesting a concept of natural selection leading to new species, but he had not developed the idea.

The <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>'s response was mixed. Darwin's old Cambridge tutors <a href="Adam%20Sedgwick">Sedgwick</a> and <a href="John%20Stevens%20Henslow">Henslow</a> dismissed the ideas, but <a href="liberal%20Christianity">liberal clergymen</a> interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric <a href="Charles%20Kingsley">Charles Kingsley</a> seeing it as "just as noble a conception of Deity". In 1860, the publication of "<a href="Essays%20and%20Reviews">Essays and Reviews</a>" by seven liberal Anglican theologians diverted <a href="clergy">clerical</a> attention from Darwin, with its ideas including <a href="higher%20criticism">higher criticism</a> attacked by church authorities as <a href="heresy">heresy</a>. In it, <a href="Baden%20Powell%20%28mathematician%29">Baden Powell</a> argued that <a href="miracle">miracle</a>s broke God's laws, so belief in them was <a href="atheism">atheistic</a>, and praised "Mr Darwin's masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature". <a href="Asa%20Gray">Asa Gray</a> discussed <a href="teleology">teleology</a> with Darwin, who imported and distributed Gray's pamphlet on <a href="theistic%20evolution">theistic evolution</a>, "Natural Selection is not inconsistent with <a href="natural%20theology">natural theology</a>". The most famous confrontation was at the public <a href="1860%20Oxford%20evolution%20debate">1860 Oxford evolution debate</a> during a meeting of the <a href="British%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Science">British Association for the Advancement of Science</a>, where the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Oxford">Bishop of Oxford</a> <a href="Samuel%20Wilberforce">Samuel Wilberforce</a>, though not opposed to <a href="transmutation%20of%20species">transmutation of species</a>, argued against Darwin's explanation and human descent from apes. <a href="Joseph%20Dalton%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a> argued strongly for Darwin, and <a href="Thomas%20Henry%20Huxley">Thomas Huxley</a>'s legendary retort, that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his gifts, came to symbolise a triumph of science over religion.

Even Darwin's close friends Gray, Hooker, Huxley and Lyell still expressed various reservations but gave strong support, as did many others, particularly younger naturalists. Gray and Lyell sought reconciliation with faith, while Huxley portrayed a polarisation between religion and science. He campaigned pugnaciously against the authority of the clergy in education, aiming to overturn the dominance of clergymen and aristocratic amateurs under Owen in favour of a new generation of professional scientists. Owen's claim that brain anatomy proved humans to be a separate <a href="order%20%28biology%29">biological order</a> from apes was shown to be false by Huxley in a long running dispute parodied by Kingsley as the "<a href="Great%20Hippocampus%20Question">Great Hippocampus Question</a>", and discredited Owen.

<a href="Darwinism">Darwinism</a> became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas. In 1863 <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Lyell</a>'s "<a href="Geological%20Evidences%20of%20the%20Antiquity%20of%20Man">Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man</a>" popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin. Weeks later Huxley's "<a href="Evidence%20as%20to%20Man%27s%20Place%20in%20Nature">Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature</a>" showed that anatomically, humans are apes, then "<a href="The%20Naturalist%20on%20the%20River%20Amazons">The Naturalist on the River Amazons</a>" by <a href="Henry%20Walter%20Bates">Henry Walter Bates</a> provided empirical evidence of natural selection. Lobbying brought Darwin Britain's highest scientific honour, the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>'s <a href="Copley%20Medal">Copley Medal</a>, awarded on 3 November 1864. That day, Huxley held the first meeting of what became the influential "<a href="X%20Club">X Club</a>" devoted to "science, pure and free, untrammelled by religious dogmas". By the end of the decade most scientists agreed that evolution occurred, but only a minority supported Darwin's view that the chief mechanism was natural selection.

The "Origin of Species" was translated into many languages, becoming a staple scientific text attracting thoughtful attention from all walks of life, including the "working men" who flocked to Huxley's lectures. Darwin's theory also resonated with various movements at the time and became a key fixture of popular culture. Cartoonists parodied animal ancestry in an old tradition of showing humans with animal traits, and in Britain these droll images served to popularise Darwin's theory in an unthreatening way. While ill in 1862 Darwin began growing a beard, and when he reappeared in public in 1866 caricatures of him as an <a href="ape">ape</a> helped to identify all forms of <a href="evolutionism">evolutionism</a> with Darwinism.

Despite repeated bouts of illness during the last twenty-two years of his life, Darwin's work continued. Having published "On the Origin of Species" as an <a href="abstract%20%28summary%29">abstract</a> of his theory, he pressed on with experiments, research, and writing of his "big book". He covered <a href="human%20evolution">human descent</a> from earlier animals including evolution of society and of mental abilities, as well as explaining decorative beauty in wildlife and diversifying into innovative plant studies.

Enquiries about insect <a href="pollination">pollination</a> led in 1861 to novel studies of wild <a href="orchid">orchid</a>s, showing adaptation of their flowers to <a href="Pollination%20syndrome">attract specific moths</a> to each species and ensure <a href="heterosis">cross fertilisation</a>. In 1862 "<a href="Fertilisation%20of%20Orchids">Fertilisation of Orchids</a>" gave his first detailed demonstration of the power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of <a href="vine">climbing plants</a>. Admiring visitors included <a href="Ernst%20Haeckel">Ernst Haeckel</a>, a zealous proponent of "Darwinismus" incorporating <a href="Lamarckism">Lamarckism</a> and <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Goethe</a>'s idealism. Wallace remained supportive, though he increasingly turned to <a href="Spiritualism%20%28religious%20movement%29">Spiritualism</a>.

Darwin's book "<a href="The%20Variation%20of%20Animals%20and%20Plants%20under%20Domestication">The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication</a>" (1868) was the first part of his planned "big book", and included his unsuccessful hypothesis of <a href="pangenesis">pangenesis</a> attempting to explain <a href="heredity">heredity</a>. It sold briskly at first, despite its size, and was translated into many languages. He wrote most of a second part, on natural selection, but it remained unpublished in his lifetime.
<a href="Charles%20Lyell">Lyell</a> had already popularised human prehistory, and <a href="Thomas%20Henry%20Huxley">Huxley</a> had shown that anatomically humans are apes. With "The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex" published in 1871, Darwin set out evidence from numerous sources that humans are animals, showing continuity of physical and mental attributes, and presented <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a> to explain impractical animal features such as the <a href="peacock">peacock</a>'s plumage as well as human evolution of culture, differences between sexes, and physical and cultural <a href="Race%20%28human%20categorization%29">racial classification</a>, while emphasising that humans are all one species. His research using images was expanded in his 1872 book "<a href="The%20Expression%20of%20the%20Emotions%20in%20Man%20and%20Animals">The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</a>", one of the first books to feature printed photographs, which discussed the <a href="evolutionary%20psychology">evolution of human psychology</a> and its continuity with the <a href="ethology">behaviour of animals</a>. Both books proved very popular, and Darwin was impressed by the general assent with which his views had been received, remarking that "everybody is talking about it without being shocked." His conclusion was "that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system—with all these exalted powers—Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."

His evolution-related experiments and investigations led to books on Orchids, "<a href="Insectivorous%20Plants%20%28book%29">Insectivorous Plants</a>, <a href="The%20Effects%20of%20Cross%20and%20Self%20Fertilisation%20in%20the%20Vegetable%20Kingdom">The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom</a>", different forms of flowers on plants of the same species, and "<a href="The%20Power%20of%20Movement%20in%20Plants">The Power of Movement in Plants</a>". His botanical work was interpreted and popularised by various writers including <a href="Grant%20Allen">Grant Allen</a> and <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>, and <a href="http%3A//journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26amp%3Baid%3D10359900%26amp%3BfulltextType%3DRA%26amp%3BfileId%3DS0007087416000352">helped transform plant science</a> in the late 19th century and early 20th century. In his last book he returned to "<a href="The%20Formation%20of%20Vegetable%20Mould%20through%20the%20Action%20of%20Worms">The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms</a>".

In 1882 he was diagnosed with what was called "<a href="angina%20pectoris">angina pectoris</a>" which then meant <a href="coronary%20thrombosis">coronary thrombosis</a> and disease of the heart. At the time of his death, the physicians diagnosed "anginal attacks", and "heart-failure". Today it is speculated that Darwin was suffering from chronic <a href="Chagas%20disease">Chagas disease</a>. This speculation is based on a journal entry written by Darwin, describing he was bitten by the "<a href="Triatominae">Kissing Bug</a>" in Mendoza, Argentina, in 1835; and based on the constellation of clinical symptoms he exhibited, including cardiac disease which is a hallmark of chronic Chagas disease. Exhuming Darwin's body is likely necessary to definitively determine his state of infection by detecting DNA of infecting parasite, <a href="Trypanosoma%20cruzi">T. cruzi</a>, that causes Chagas disease.

He died at <a href="Down%20House">Down House</a> on 19 April 1882. His last words were to his family, telling Emma "I am not the least afraid of death—Remember what a good wife you have been to me—Tell all my children to remember how good they have been to me", then while she rested, he repeatedly told Henrietta and Francis "It's almost worth while to be sick to be nursed by you". He had expected to be buried in St Mary's churchyard at <a href="Downe">Downe</a>, but at the request of Darwin's colleagues, after public and parliamentary petitioning, <a href="William%20Spottiswoode">William Spottiswoode</a> (President of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>) arranged for Darwin to be honoured by <a href="Burials%20and%20memorials%20in%20Westminster%20Abbey">burial in Westminster Abbey</a>, close to <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a> and <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a>. The funeral was held on Wednesday 26 April and was attended by thousands of people, including family, friends, scientists, philosophers and dignitaries.

By the time of his death, Darwin had convinced most scientists that <a href="evolution">evolution</a> as <a href="common%20descent">descent with modification</a> was correct, and he was regarded as a great scientist who had revolutionised ideas. In June 1909, though few at that time agreed with his view that "natural selection has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification", he was honoured by more than 400 officials and scientists from across the world who met in <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> to <a href="Darwin%20Day">commemorate his centenary</a> and the fiftieth anniversary of "On the Origin of Species". Around the beginning of the 20th century, a period that has been called "<a href="the%20eclipse%20of%20Darwinism">the eclipse of Darwinism</a>", scientists proposed various alternative evolutionary mechanisms, which eventually proved untenable. <a href="Ronald%20Fisher">Ronald Fisher</a>, an English <a href="statistics">statistician</a>, finally united <a href="Mendelian%20genetics">Mendelian genetics</a> with natural selection, in the period between 1918 and his 1930 book "<a href="The%20Genetical%20Theory%20of%20Natural%20Selection">The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection</a>". He gave the theory a <a href="mathematics">mathematical</a> footing and brought broad scientific consensus that natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution, thus founding the basis for <a href="population%20genetics">population genetics</a> and the <a href="modern%20synthesis%20%2820th%20century%29">modern evolutionary synthesis</a>, with <a href="J.B.S.%20Haldane">J.B.S. Haldane</a> and <a href="Sewall%20Wright">Sewall Wright</a>, which set the frame of reference for modern debates and refinements of the theory.

During Darwin's lifetime, many geographical features were given his name. An expanse of water adjoining the <a href="Beagle%20Channel">Beagle Channel</a> was named "<a href="Darwin%20Sound">Darwin Sound</a>" by <a href="Robert%20FitzRoy">Robert FitzRoy</a> after Darwin's prompt action, along with two or three of the men, saved them from being marooned on a nearby shore when a collapsing <a href="glacier">glacier</a> caused a large wave that would have swept away their boats, and the nearby <a href="Mount%20Darwin%20%28Andes%29">Mount Darwin</a> in the Andes was named in celebration of Darwin's 25th birthday. When the "<a href="HMS%20Beagle">Beagle</a>" was surveying Australia in 1839, Darwin's friend <a href="John%20Lort%20Stokes">John Lort Stokes</a> sighted a natural harbour which the ship's captain <a href="John%20Clements%20Wickham">Wickham</a> named "<a href="Port%20Darwin">Port Darwin</a>": a nearby settlement was renamed <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a> in 1911, and it became the capital city of Australia's <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a>.
More than 120 <a href="species">species</a> and nine <a href="genus">genera</a> have been named after Darwin. In one example, the group of <a href="tanager">tanager</a>s related to those Darwin found in the <a href="Gal%C3%A1pagos%20Islands">Galápagos Islands</a> became popularly known as "<a href="Darwin%27s%20finches">Darwin's finches</a>" in 1947, fostering inaccurate legends about their significance to his work.

Darwin's work has continued to be celebrated by numerous publications and events. The <a href="Linnean%20Society%20of%20London">Linnean Society of London</a> has commemorated Darwin's achievements by the award of the <a href="Darwin%E2%80%93Wallace%20Medal">Darwin–Wallace Medal</a> since 1908. <a href="Darwin%20Day">Darwin Day</a> has become an annual celebration, and in 2009 worldwide events were arranged for the bicentenary of Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of "On the Origin of Species".

Darwin has been commemorated in the UK, with his portrait printed on the reverse of £10 banknotes printed along with a <a href="hummingbird">hummingbird</a> and <a href="HMS%20Beagle">HMS "Beagle"</a>, issued by the <a href="Bank%20of%20England%20note%20issues">Bank of England</a>.

A life-size seated statue of Darwin can be seen in the main hall of the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a> in London.

A seated statue of Darwin, unveiled 1897, stands in front of <a href="Shrewsbury%20Library">Shrewsbury Library</a>, the building that used to house <a href="Shrewsbury%20School">Shrewsbury School</a>, which Darwin attended as a boy. Another statue of Darwin as a young man is situated in the grounds of <a href="Christ%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Christ's College, Cambridge</a>.

<a href="Darwin%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Darwin College</a>, a postgraduate college at <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a>, is named after the Darwin family.

2008-09 the Swedish band <a href="The%20Knife">The Knife</a>, in collaboration with Danish performance group Hotel Pro Forma and other musicians from Denmark, Sweden and the USA, created an opera about the life of Darwin, and The Origin of Species, titled <a href="Tomorrow%2C%20in%20a%20Year">Tomorrow, in a Year</a>. The show toured European theatres in 2010.

The Darwins had ten children: two died in infancy, and <a href="Anne%20Darwin">Annie</a>'s death at the age of ten had a devastating effect on her parents. Charles was a devoted father and uncommonly attentive to his children. Whenever they fell ill, he feared that they might have inherited weaknesses from <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a> due to the close family ties he shared with his <a href="cousin%20marriage">wife and cousin</a>, Emma Wedgwood.

He examined inbreeding in his writings, contrasting it with the advantages of <a href="outcrossing">outcrossing</a> in many species. Despite his fears, most of the surviving children and many of their descendants went on to have distinguished careers.

Of his surviving children, <a href="George%20Darwin">George</a>, <a href="Francis%20Darwin">Francis</a> and <a href="Horace%20Darwin">Horace</a> became <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">Fellows of the Royal Society</a>, distinguished as astronomer, botanist and civil engineer, respectively. All three were knighted. Another son, <a href="Leonard%20Darwin">Leonard</a>, went on to be a soldier, politician, economist, <a href="eugenics">eugenicist</a> and mentor of the statistician and evolutionary biologist <a href="Ronald%20Fisher">Ronald Fisher</a>.

Darwin's family tradition was <a href="nonconformist">nonconformist</a> <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarianism</a>, while his father and grandfather were <a href="freethought">freethinkers</a>, and his <a href="baptism">baptism</a> and <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a> were <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>. When going to Cambridge to become an <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> clergyman, he did not doubt the <a href="Biblical%20inerrancy">literal truth</a> of the Bible. He learned <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a>'s science which, like <a href="William%20Paley">William Paley</a>'s <a href="natural%20theology">natural theology</a>, sought explanations in laws of nature rather than miracles and saw <a href="adaptation">adaptation</a> of species as <a href="teleological%20argument">evidence of design</a>. On board HMS "Beagle", Darwin was quite <a href="orthodoxy">orthodox</a> and would quote the Bible as an authority on <a href="morality">morality</a>. He looked for "centres of creation" to explain distribution, and suggested that the very similar <a href="antlion">antlion</a>s found in Australia and England were evidence of a divine hand.

By his return, he was <a href="Historical%20criticism">critical of the Bible as history</a>, and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid. In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the <a href="transmutation%20of%20species">transmutation of species</a>, he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife <a href="Emma%20Darwin">Emma</a>, whose beliefs also came from intensive study and questioning. The <a href="theodicy">theodicy</a> of Paley and <a href="Thomas%20Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a> vindicated evils such as starvation as a result of a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design, and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the <a href="ichneumon%20wasp">ichneumon wasp</a> paralysing <a href="caterpillar">caterpillar</a>s as live food for its eggs. Though he thought of religion as a <a href="tribe">tribal</a> survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of <a href="deism">God as an ultimate lawgiver</a>. He was increasingly troubled by the <a href="problem%20of%20evil">problem of evil</a>.

Darwin remained close friends with the <a href="Vicar%20%28Anglicanism%29">vicar</a> of Downe, <a href="John%20Brodie%20Innes">John Brodie Innes</a>, and continued to play a leading part in the parish work of the church, but from around 1849 would go for a walk on Sundays while his family attended church. He considered it "absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist" and, though reticent about his religious views, in 1879 he wrote that "I have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God. – I think that generally ... an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind".

The "<a href="Elizabeth%20Cotton%2C%20Lady%20Hope">Lady Hope Story</a>", published in 1915, claimed that Darwin had reverted to Christianity on his sickbed. The claims were repudiated by Darwin's children and have been dismissed as false by historians.

Darwin's views on social and political issues reflected his time and social position. He grew up in a family of <a href="Whigs%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whig</a> reformers who, like his uncle Josiah Wedgwood, supported <a href="Reform%20Act%201832">electoral reform</a> and the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">emancipation of slaves</a>. Darwin was passionately opposed to slavery, while seeing no problem with the working conditions of English factory workers or servants. His taxidermy lessons in 1826 from the freed slave <a href="John%20Edmonstone">John Edmonstone</a>, who he long recalled as "a very pleasant and intelligent man", reinforced his belief that black people shared the same feelings, and could be as intelligent as people of other races. He took the same attitude to native people he met on the "Beagle" voyage. These attitudes were not unusual in Britain in the 1820s, much as it shocked visiting Americans. British society became more racist in mid century, but Darwin remained strongly against slavery, against "ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species", and against ill-treatment of native people. Darwins interaction with <a href="Yaghan">Yaghan</a>s (Fuegians) such as <a href="Jemmy%20Button">Jemmy Button</a> during the <a href="second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle">second voyage of HMS Beagle</a> had a profound impact on his view of primitive peoples. At his arrival to <a href="Tierra%20del%20Fuego">Tierra del Fuego</a> he made a colorful description of "<a href="Fuegian">Fuegian</a> savages". This view changed as he came to know Yaghan people more in detail. By studying the Yaghans Darwin concluded that a number of basic emotions by different human groups were the same and that mental capabilities were roughly the same as for Europeans. While interested in Yaghan culture Darwin failed to appreciate their deep ecological knowledge and elaborate cosmology until the 1850s when he inspected a dictionary of <a href="Yaghan%20language">Yaghan</a> detailing 32-thousand words.

He valued European civilisation and saw colonisation as spreading its benefits, with the sad but inevitable effect that savage peoples who did not become civilised faced extinction. Darwin's theories presented this as natural, and were cited to promote policies that went against his humanitarian principles.

He thought men's eminence over women was the outcome of sexual selection, a view disputed by <a href="Antoinette%20Brown%20Blackwell">Antoinette Brown Blackwell</a> in her 1875 book "<a href="The%20Sexes%20Throughout%20Nature">The Sexes Throughout Nature</a>".

Darwin was intrigued by his <a href="half-cousin">half-cousin</a> <a href="Francis%20Galton">Francis Galton</a>'s argument, introduced in 1865, that <a href="Historiometry">statistical analysis</a> of <a href="heredity">heredity</a> showed that moral and mental human traits could be inherited, and principles of animal breeding could apply to humans. In "The Descent of Man", Darwin noted that aiding the weak to survive and have families could lose the benefits of natural selection, but cautioned that withholding such aid would endanger the instinct of sympathy, "the noblest part of our nature", and factors such as education could be more important. When Galton suggested that publishing research could encourage intermarriage within a "caste" of "those who are naturally gifted", Darwin foresaw practical difficulties, and thought it "the sole feasible, yet I fear <a href="utopian">utopian</a>, plan of procedure in improving the human race", preferring to simply publicise the importance of inheritance and leave decisions to individuals. Francis Galton named this field of study "<a href="eugenics">eugenics</a>" in 1883.

Darwin's fame and popularity led to his name being associated with ideas and movements that, at times, had only an indirect relation to his writings, and sometimes went directly against his express comments.

<a href="Thomas%20Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a> had argued that <a href="Malthusian%20catastrophe">population growth beyond resources</a> was ordained by God to get humans to <a href="Protestant%20work%20ethic">work productively</a> and show restraint in getting families, this was used in the 1830s to justify <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a>s and <a href="laissez-faire%20economics">laissez-faire economics</a>. Evolution was by then seen as having social implications, and <a href="Herbert%20Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a>'s 1851 book "Social Statics" based ideas of human freedom and individual liberties on his Lamarckian evolutionary theory.

Soon after the "Origin" was published in 1859, critics derided his description of a struggle for existence as a <a href="Malthusianism">Malthusian</a> justification for the English industrial capitalism of the time. The term "<a href="Darwinism">Darwinism</a>" was used for the evolutionary ideas of others, including Spencer's "<a href="survival%20of%20the%20fittest">survival of the fittest</a>" as free-market progress, and <a href="Ernst%20Haeckel">Ernst Haeckel</a>'s <a href="polygenism">polygenistic</a> ideas of <a href="Ernst%20Haeckel%23Polygenism%20and%20racial%20theory">human development</a>. Writers used natural selection to argue for various, often contradictory, ideologies such as laissez-faire dog-eat dog capitalism, <a href="colonialism">colonialism</a> and <a href="New%20Imperialism">imperialism</a>. However, Darwin's holistic view of nature included "dependence of one being on another"; thus <a href="pacifism">pacifists</a>, socialists, liberal social reformers and anarchists such as <a href="Peter%20Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a> stressed the value of co-operation over struggle within a species. Darwin himself insisted that social policy should not simply be guided by concepts of struggle and selection in nature.

After the 1880s, a eugenics movement developed on ideas of biological inheritance, and for scientific justification of their ideas appealed to some concepts of Darwinism. In Britain, most shared Darwin's cautious views on voluntary improvement and sought to encourage those with good traits in "positive eugenics". During the "<a href="Eclipse%20of%20Darwinism">Eclipse of Darwinism</a>", a scientific foundation for eugenics was provided by <a href="Mendelian%20inheritance">Mendelian</a> <a href="genetics">genetics</a>. Negative eugenics to remove the "feebleminded" were popular in America, Canada and Australia, and <a href="eugenics%20in%20the%20United%20States">eugenics in the United States</a> introduced <a href="compulsory%20sterilization">compulsory sterilization</a> laws, followed by several other countries. Subsequently, <a href="Nazi%20eugenics">Nazi eugenics</a> brought the field into disrepute.

The term "<a href="Social%20Darwinism">Social Darwinism</a>" was used infrequently from around the 1890s, but became popular as a derogatory term in the 1940s when used by <a href="Richard%20Hofstadter">Richard Hofstadter</a> to attack the <a href="laissez-faire%20conservatism">laissez-faire conservatism</a> of those like <a href="William%20Graham%20Sumner">William Graham Sumner</a> who opposed reform and socialism. Since then, it has been used as a term of abuse by those opposed to what they think are the moral consequences of evolution.

The Chinese translator of the Origin of Species synthesized Herbert Spencer’s idea into Darwin’s Origin in order to legitimize China’s political revolution and social evolution.

Darwin was a prolific writer. Even without publication of his works on evolution, he would have had a considerable reputation as the author of "<a href="The%20Voyage%20of%20the%20Beagle">The Voyage of the Beagle</a>", as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of <a href="coral%20atoll">coral atoll</a>s, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on <a href="barnacle">barnacle</a>s. While "On the Origin of Species" dominates perceptions of his work, "The Descent of Man" and "<a href="The%20Expression%20of%20the%20Emotions%20in%20Man%20and%20Animals">The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</a>" had considerable impact, and his books on plants including "<a href="The%20Power%20of%20Movement%20in%20Plants">The Power of Movement in Plants</a>" were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on "<a href="The%20Formation%20of%20Vegetable%20Mould%20through%20the%20Action%20of%20Worms">The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms</a>".

. Darwin was eminent as a <a href="naturalist">naturalist</a>, geologist, <a href="biologist">biologist</a>, and author. After working as a physician's assistant and two years as a <a href="medical%20student">medical student</a>, he was educated as a clergyman; he was also trained in <a href="taxidermy">taxidermy</a>.

. <a href="Robert%20FitzRoy">Robert FitzRoy</a> was to become known after the voyage for <a href="biblical%20literalism">biblical literalism</a>, but at this time he had considerable interest in Lyell's ideas, and they met before the voyage when Lyell asked for observations to be made in South America. FitzRoy's diary during the ascent of the River Santa Cruz in <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a> recorded his opinion that the plains were <a href="raised%20beach">raised beach</a>es, but on return, newly married to a very religious lady, he recanted these ideas.

. In the section <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">"Morphology"</a> of Chapter XIII of "On the Origin of Species", Darwin commented on <a href="Homology%20%28biology%29">homologous</a> bone patterns between humans and other mammals, writing: "What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?" and in the concluding chapter: "The framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse … at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive modifications."
In "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>" Darwin mentioned <a href="human%20evolution">human origins</a> in his concluding remark that "In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."

In "Chapter VI: Difficulties on Theory" he referred to <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a>: "I might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous."

In "<a href="The%20Descent%20of%20Man%2C%20and%20Selection%20in%20Relation%20to%20Sex">The Descent of Man</a>" of 1871, Darwin discussed the first passage:
"During many years I collected notes on the origin or descent of man, without any intention of publishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to publish, as I thought that I should thus only add to the prejudices against my views. It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in the first edition of my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth." In a preface to the 1874 second edition, he added a reference to the second point: "it has been said by several critics, that when I found that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man."

. See, for example, WILLA volume 4, "<a href="http%3A//scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/old-WILLA/fall95/DeSimone.html">Charlotte Perkins Gilman and the Feminization of Education</a>" by Deborah M. De Simone: "Gilman shared many basic educational ideas with the generation of thinkers who matured during the period of "intellectual chaos" caused by Darwin's Origin of the Species. Marked by the belief that individuals can direct human and social evolution, many progressives came to view education as the panacea for advancing social progress and for solving such problems as urbanisation, poverty, or immigration."

. See, for example, the song "A lady fair of lineage high" from <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>'s "<a href="Princess%20Ida">Princess Ida</a>", which describes the descent of man (but not woman!) from apes.

. Darwin's belief that black people had the same essential humanity as Europeans, and had many mental similarities, was reinforced by the lessons he had from <a href="John%20Edmonstone">John Edmonstone</a> in 1826. Early in the "Beagle" voyage, Darwin nearly lost his position on the ship when he criticised FitzRoy's defence and praise of slavery. He wrote home about "how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration I am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro character." Regarding <a href="Fuegians">Fuegians</a>, he "could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement", but he knew and liked civilised Fuegians like <a href="Jemmy%20Button">Jemmy Button</a>: "It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here."

In the "Descent of Man", he mentioned the similarity of Fuegians' and Edmonstone's minds to Europeans' when arguing against "ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species".

Red warbler

The red warbler ("Cardellina rubra") is a small <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird of the <a href="New%20World%20warbler">New World warbler</a> family Parulidae <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to the highlands of Mexico, north of the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Tehuantepec">Isthmus of Tehuantepec</a>. It is closely related to, and forms a <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a> with, the <a href="pink-headed%20warbler">pink-headed warbler</a> of southern Mexico and Guatemala. There are three <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, found in disjunct populations, which differ primarily in the color of their ear patch and in the brightness and tone of their body plumage. The adult is bright red, with a white or gray ear patch, depending on the subspecies; young birds are pinkish-brown, with a whitish ear patch and two pale wingbars.

Breeding typically occurs between February and May. The female lays three or four eggs in a domed nest, which she builds on the ground. Though she alone <a href="Egg%20incubation">incubates</a> the eggs, both sexes feed the young and remove <a href="fecal%20sac">fecal sac</a>s from the nest. The young <a href="fledge">fledge</a> within 10–11 days of hatching. The red warbler is an <a href="insectivore">insectivore</a>, <a href="Gleaning%20%28birds%29">gleaning</a> primarily in <a href="understory">understory</a> shrubs. Although this bird is considered to be a <a href="least-concern%20species">least-concern species</a> according to the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), its numbers are thought to be declining due to habitat destruction.

English jeweller and naturalist <a href="William%20Bullock%20%28collector%29">William Bullock</a> and his son travelled to Mexico soon after its <a href="Mexican%20War%20of%20Independence">independence</a>, spending six months in 1823 collecting archeological artifacts and many bird and fish species new to science. The bird specimens were given to naturalist <a href="William%20John%20Swainson">William John Swainson</a>, their countryman, to formally <a href="species%20description">describe</a>, which he did in 1827. Among these was the red warbler, which was assigned to the genus "<a href="Setophaga">Setophaga</a>", as "Setophaga rubra". Over the next half century, other authorities moved it to "<a href="Cardellina">Cardellina</a>", with the <a href="red-faced%20warbler">red-faced warbler</a>, and to the widespread tropical warbler genus "<a href="Basileuterus">Basileuterus</a>", as well as to the <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a> warbler genus "<a href="Typical%20warbler">Sylvia</a>" and the Old World tit genus "<a href="Parus">Parus</a>". In 1873, English naturalists <a href="Philip%20Lutley%20Sclater">Philip Lutley Sclater</a> and <a href="Osbert%20Salvin">Osbert Salvin</a> moved the species to the genus "<a href="Ergaticus">Ergaticus</a>", where it remained for more than a century. 

The red warbler forms a <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a> with the pink-headed warbler of <a href="Chiapas">Chiapas</a> and Guatemala. Despite their disjunct ranges and considerably different plumages, the two have sometimes been considered <a href="conspecific">conspecific</a>. Conversely, it has also been suggested that the red warbler should be split into a northern gray-eared species ("C. melanauris") and a southern white-eared species ("C. rubra"). A comprehensive 2010 paper by Irby Lovette and colleagues analysing <a href="Mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial</a> and <a href="Nuclear%20DNA">nuclear DNA</a> of the <a href="New%20World%20warbler">New World warbler</a>s found that the red and <a href="pink-headed%20warbler">pink-headed warbler</a>s are each others' closest relative and that their common ancestor diverged from a lineage that gave rise to the red-faced warbler. The authors recommended moving the red and pink-headed warblers to the genus "Cardellina", a suggestion which has been adopted by the <a href="International%20Ornithologists%27%20Union">International Ornithologists' Union</a> (IOC).

There are three subspecies, which differ slightly in appearance:

"Red warbler" has been designated the official name by the IOC. It is a straightforward reference to its color. The <a href="genus">genus</a> name "Cardellina" is the diminutive of the Italian "cardella", a regional name for the <a href="European%20goldfinch">European goldfinch</a>, while its <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a>, "rubra", is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "red".

The red warbler is a small passerine, measuring in length, and weighing from . As an adult, it is red overall, with either a white or dark gray (depending on the subspecies) auricular patch on each side of its head. Its wings and tail are slightly darker, dusky red, and edged in pinkish-red. Its legs are a dull red-brown, and its thin <a href="Beak">bill</a> is pinkish-gray with a dark tip. The <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> is dark brown to blackish. Plumage varies little between the sexes, although the female tends to be a little duller or more orange-tinged. Adult pairs separate and moult fully from August, after the breeding season. 

The adult red warbler is hard to confuse with any other bird species in its range; the <a href="scarlet%20tanager">scarlet tanager</a> and <a href="summer%20tanager">summer tanager</a> have similar mostly-red plumage but are larger with thick conical bills. 

As a juvenile, the red warbler is pinkish-brown with a whitish auricular patch. Its darker wings and tail show pinkish-cinnamon edges, with two paler wingbars on the former. 

The red warbler has several common calls, including a high, thin "tsii" and a stronger "pseet". Its <a href="bird%20vocalization">song</a> is a mix of short trills and richer warbles, interspersed with high-pitched chips. Unlike other species in the same <a href="habitat">habitat</a> zone, it tends to sing only during bright morning hours during the <a href="breeding%20season">breeding season</a>. It does not sing – and even its calling frequency decreases – in <a href="cloud">cloud</a>y weather, regardless of season.

Endemic to the highlands of Mexico north of the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Tehuantepec">Isthmus of Tehuantepec</a>, the red warbler has three <a href="disjunct%20distribution">disjunct populations</a> that correspond to the three subspecies: from southwestern Chihuahua to northern Nayarit, from southern Jalisco and southern Hidalgo to Oaxaca, and from <a href="Guerrero">Guerrero</a> into southern Oaxaca in the <a href="Sierra%20Madre%20del%20Sur">Sierra Madre del Sur</a>. It is fairly common to common in the country's interior and on adjacent slopes, where it occurs at elevations ranging from above sea level; it does not occur along either coast. It is an altitudinal migrant, moving from higher humid or semi-humid <a href="pine">pine</a>, pine-<a href="oak">oak</a> and <a href="fir">fir</a> forests in the breeding season to lower elevations, often in oak forests, in the winter. It is among the most common of the small birds in its woodland habitat, second only to the <a href="golden-crowned%20kinglet">golden-crowned kinglet</a> in fir forests in one study and the third most common warbler in oak-conifer woodlands in another.

Though the species was reported to have been <a href="bird%20collections">collected</a> in <a href="Texas">Texas</a> in the late 19th century, the record's location was not widely believed, and there is no strong evidence that it ever occurred there. It has strayed as far north as southeastern Arizona, where a bird was found on <a href="Mount%20Lemmon">Mount Lemmon</a> in 2018.

Though it occasionally joins <a href="mixed-species%20flock">mixed-species flock</a>s, the red warbler is more typically found alone or in pairs. Youngsters probably choose mates in the autumn of their first year, and pairs remain together year-round, except during severe weather and during post-breeding <a href="molt">molt</a>.

The red warbler breeds primarily in early spring, from February until May, though at least one <a href="bird%20nest">nest</a> containing young has been found as late as the end of June. By late February, the male establishes a territory that averages about 40 square metres, defending it with song. Other males may intrude by silently flying in at a height of around 3 m (10 ft) and back to their own territory. Deep incursions result in combat, after which the interloper usually leaves. Beginning in mid-March, the male courts the female by chasing her through the undergrowth. The pair then perch together while the male sings and the female calls softly. The female alone builds the nest, a task which typically takes 4–6 days. She chooses a sunlit area, such as an area of windfall, the brushy edge of a trail or water course, or a small clearing, for its location. Tightly woven of plant material, the nest is hidden in ground vegetation and anchored to the stalks of surrounding vegetation. The nest, which is usually <a href="beehive%20oven">oven</a>-shaped with a side or upward-facing entrance, measures roughly wide by long by high. Bulky and untidy on the outside, it is typically constructed primarily of dead pine needles and dead grass, though gray <a href="lichen">lichen</a>s, green moss, dead leaves, shreds of bark and tips of fern fronds are also used; most of these materials are gathered from the ground close to the nest, though some is picked from low branches or further away. A few nests are only cups, lacking the roof of the more typical structures. Inside, the nest is tidy and compact, lined with fine grasses and plant fluff, which is generally gathered some distance from the nest.

Early in the breeding season, there may be a gap of as many as 11 days between the completion of the nest and the laying of the first <a href="egg%20%28biology%29">egg</a>. Later in the season, this time decreases so that the first egg is laid as soon as the nest is ready. The female normally lays three eggs, though <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutches</a> of up to four have been recorded. The eggs, which are variously described as pale pink with evenly distributed brown spots or white with cinnamon and rust spots densely ringing the larger end of the egg, measure by and weigh . The female alone <a href="avian%20incubation">incubates</a> the eggs for 16 days; the male does not even approach the nest until several days after the eggs hatch. She sits facing the back wall of the nest, with her head and body sheltered by its roof and her tail sticking out the opening. She sits tight at the approach of danger, typically not flying until a potential predator actually makes contact with the nest.

Both adults feed the <a href="nestling">nestling</a>s and remove <a href="fecal%20sac">fecal sac</a>s, though the female removes far more than the male does. The parents move deceptively when approaching the nest, foraging – or pretending to forage – in nearby vegetation. They stay only a few seconds in any one spot, including at the nest, making it more difficult for a predator to locate the young. Nestlings make a rapid, high-pitched peeping call as an adult approaches carrying food. They <a href="fledge">fledge</a> within 10–11 days of hatching. Young birds are fully grown three weeks after fledging, upon which time they are driven off by their parents.

The red warbler is an <a href="insectivore">insectivore</a>. It <a href="gleaning%20%28birds%29">gleans</a> primarily in <a href="understory">understory</a> shrubs at low to middle levels, moving slowly and deliberately through more open areas of the vegetation, and feeding with quick jabs into cracks in <a href="Bark%20%28botany%29">bark</a> and <a href="pine%20needle">pine needle</a> clusters. It sometimes hovers briefly to feed at pine needle clusters, a foraging technique known as "hover gleaning". Though it lacks any obvious adaptations for climbing, it regularly does so in its search for prey items on bark and <a href="epiphyte">epiphyte</a>s on branches, often hanging head-down as it probes. In areas of <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> growth, it typically flycatches, making brief aerial sorties from a perch in pursuit of flying insects. While it seldom associates with mixed-species flocks, it often feeds alongside other birds with no signs of conflict, displaying no hostility towards other species—such as the <a href="slate-throated%20whitestart">slate-throated whitestart</a> ("Myioborus miniatus")—with which it competes. It has been observed chasing off a flycatcher of the genus "<a href="Empidonax">Empidonax</a>". Its foraging area is quite small, often amounting to only a few dozen square meters (several hundred square feet) per day. Late in the afternoon, its rate of foraging declines, and it rests, often taking brief naps, in the forest understory. Though it does not generally feed after sunset, it may do so to take advantage of transient food sources, such as hatching <a href="Neuroptera">Neuroptera</a>.

The red warbler is presumably hunted by small hawks such as the <a href="sharp-shinned%20hawk">sharp-shinned hawk</a>, and its nest raided by wrens, rodents, raccoons, feral cats and snakes. "<a href="Isospora%20cardellinae">Isospora cardellinae</a>" is a <a href="protozoan">protozoan</a> species that has been isolated from a red warbler from <a href="Nevado%20de%20Toluca%20National%20Park">Nevado de Toluca National Park</a>, Mexico. It is a parasite that lives in cells in the <a href="intestinal%20villus">villi</a> of the bird's small intestine.

In the 16th century, Friar <a href="Bernardino%20de%20Sahag%C3%BAn">Bernardino de Sahagún</a> had reported that a red bird matching the description of the red warbler was regarded as inedible by the Aztecs. Researchers Patricia Escalante and John W. Daly isolated two alkaloids in preliminary investigations of the feathers. The presence of these alkaloids render the bird unpalatable; humans find it inedible.

The red warbler is currently rated as a species of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a>. Though there is evidence that its numbers are decreasing, the decline has not been precipitous (that is, under a 30% decline over ten years or three generations), and the population remains quite large, estimates ranging from 50,000 to 499,999 birds. The forested areas in which it occurs include some of the most threatened habitats in Mexico; logging, agricultural expansion, <a href="firewood">firewood</a> gathering, road building, tourist development, <a href="overgrazing">overgrazing</a> and intensive urbanization are among the many things contributing to the destruction of the forests. There is some evidence that <a href="selective%20logging">selective logging</a> in pine forests may actually favor this species, which prefers more open, sunlit areas in which to breed.

SMS "Posen" was one of four <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s in the , the first <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s built for the <a href="German%20Imperial%20Navy">German Imperial Navy</a> ("Kaiserliche Marine"). The ship was <a href="laid%20down">laid down</a> at the <a href="Germaniawerft">Germaniawerft</a> shipyard in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> on 11 June 1907, launched on 13 December 1908, and commissioned into the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> on 31 May 1910. She was equipped with a main battery of twelve guns in six twin <a href="Gun%20turret">turrets</a> in an unusual hexagonal arrangement.

The ship served with her three sister ships for the majority of World War I. She saw extensive service in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, where she took part in several fleet sorties. These culminated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> on 31 May – 1 June 1916, where "Posen" was heavily engaged in night-fighting against British light forces. In the confusion, the ship accidentally rammed the light cruiser , which suffered serious damage and was <a href="scuttling">scuttled</a> later in the night.

The ship also conducted several deployments to the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> against the <a href="Russian%20Navy">Russian Navy</a>. In the first of these, "Posen" supported a German naval assault in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Riga">Battle of the Gulf of Riga</a>. The ship was sent back to the Baltic in 1918 to support the <a href="White%20Guard%20%28Finland%29">White Finns</a> in the <a href="Finnish%20Civil%20War">Finnish Civil War</a>. At the end of the war, "Posen" remained in Germany while the majority of the fleet was interned in <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>. In 1919, following the <a href="scuttling%20of%20the%20German%20fleet%20in%20Scapa%20Flow">scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow</a>, she was ceded to the British as a replacement for the ships that had been sunk. She was then sent to <a href="ship%20breaking">ship-breakers</a> in the Netherlands and scrapped in 1922.

"Posen" was long, wide, and had a draft of . She <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> with a standard load, and fully laden. The ship had a crew of 40 officers and 968 enlisted men. "Posen" retained three-shafted <a href="Steam%20engine%23Multiple%20expansion%20engines">triple expansion engines</a> with coal-fired boilers instead of more advanced <a href="turbine">turbine</a> engines. Her propulsion system was rated at and provided a top speed of . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . This type of machinery was chosen at the request of both Admiral <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a> and the Navy's construction department; the latter stated in 1905 that the "use of turbines in heavy warships does not recommend itself." This decision was based solely on cost: at the time, <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> held a monopoly on steam turbines and required a 1 million <a href="gold%20mark">gold mark</a> royalty fee for every turbine engine. German firms were not ready to begin production of turbines on a large scale until 1910.

"Posen" carried twelve <a href="28%20cm%20SK%20L/45%20gun">SK L/45</a> guns in an unusual hexagonal configuration. Her secondary armament consisted of twelve <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20L/45">SK L/45 guns</a> and sixteen <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/45%20naval%20gun">SK L/45 guns</a>, all of which were mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s. Later in her career, two of the 8.8 cm guns were replaced with high-angle Flak mountings of the same caliber for defense against aircraft. The ship was also armed with six submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s. One tube was mounted in the bow, another in the stern, and two on each broadside, on either ends of the <a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a>. The ship's <a href="belt%20armor">belt armor</a> was thick in the central portion of the hull, and the armored deck was thick. The main battery turrets had thick sides, and the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> was protected with of armor plating.

"Posen" was ordered under the provisional name "Ersatz Baden", as a replacement for the , one of the elderly s. She was laid down on 11 June 1907 at the <a href="Germaniawerft">Germaniawerft</a> shipyard in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>. As with her sister , construction proceeded under absolute secrecy; detachments of soldiers guarded the shipyard and also guarded contractors that supplied building materials, such as <a href="Krupp">Krupp</a>. The ship was launched a year and a half later, on 12 December 1908. Wilhelm August Hans von Waldow-Reitzenstein gave a speech at her launching, and "Posen" was christened by Johanna von Radolin, the wife of Hugo Fürst von Radolin, a German diplomat who hailed from the ship's namesake province. Initial trials were conducted through April 1910, followed by final <a href="fitting-out">fitting-out</a> in May. The ship was commissioned into the fleet on 31 May. <a href="Sea%20trial">Sea trial</a>s were conducted afterward and completed by 27 August. In total, her construction cost the German government 36,920,000 <a href="German%20gold%20mark">marks</a>.

After completing her trials in August 1910, "Posen" left Kiel for <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a>, where she arrived on 7 September. As the German Imperial Navy had chronic shortages of trained sailors, many of the crew were then assigned to other ships. These crewmembers were replaced with personnel from the old <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> , which was decommissioned on 20 September. After their commissioning, all four "Nassau"-class ships served as a unit, the II Division of I Battle Squadron, with "Posen" as the <a href="flagship">flagship</a>.

"Posen" participated in several training exercises with the rest of the fleet before the outbreak of war. In late 1910 the fleet conducted a training cruise into the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>. The following year the fleet conducted maneuvers in May; the annual summer cruise to Norway followed in July. The fleet participated in another round of fleet exercises in the Baltic in September, followed by another set at the end of the year. The next year followed a similar pattern, though the summer cruise to Norway was interrupted by the <a href="Agadir%20crisis">Agadir crisis</a>; as a result, the summer cruise only went into the Baltic. The September exercises were conducted off <a href="Helgoland">Helgoland</a> in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>; another winter cruise into the Baltic followed at the end of the year. The training schedule returned to normal for 1913 and 1914, and the summer cruises again went to Norway. For the 1914 cruise, the fleet departed for Norwegian waters on 14 July, some two weeks after the <a href="assassination%20of%20Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand">assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> in <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>. The probability of war cut the cruise short; "Posen" and the rest of the fleet were back in Wilhelmshaven by 29 July.

At midnight on 4 August, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. "Posen" and the rest of the fleet conducted several advances into the North Sea to support Rear Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s <a href="I%20Scouting%20Group">I Scouting Group</a> <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s. The battlecruisers raided British coastal towns in an attempt to lure out portions of the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet. The first such operation was the <a href="raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby</a> on 15–16 December 1914. On the evening of 15 December, the German battle fleet of 12 dreadnoughts—including "Posen" and her three sisters—and eight pre-dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. Skirmishes between the rival <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> screens in the darkness convinced the German fleet commander, Admiral <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Ingenohl">Friedrich von Ingenohl</a>, that he was faced with the Grand Fleet, now deployed in its battle formation. Under orders from <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battlefleet back toward Germany.

In August, a special unit from the German fleet attempted to clear the Russian-held <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a> in order to assist the German Army, which was planning an assault on <a href="Riga">Riga</a>. To do so, the German planners intended to drive off or destroy the Russian naval forces in the Gulf, which included the pre-dreadnought battleship and some smaller <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a>s and destroyers. The German battle fleet was accompanied by several mine-warfare vessels. These ships were tasked with clearing Russian minefields and laying a series of their own minefields in the northern entrance to the gulf, to prevent Russian naval reinforcements from reaching the area. The assembled German flotilla included "Posen" and her three sister ships, the four s, the battlecruisers , , and , and several pre-dreadnoughts, operating under the command of von Hipper, now a Vice Admiral. The eight battleships were to provide cover for the forces engaging the Russian flotilla. The first attempt on 8 August was unsuccessful, as it had taken too long to clear the Russian minefields to allow the minelayer to lay a minefield of her own.

On 16 August 1915, "Posen" and "Nassau" led a second attempt to breach the defenses of the gulf, with "Posen" as Admiral Schmidt's flagship. The two dreadnoughts were accompanied by 4 light cruisers and 31 torpedo boats. On the first day of the assault the Germans broke through the Russian forces, but two German light craft—the minesweeper and the destroyer —were sunk. "Posen" and "Nassau" engaged a pair of Russian gunboats, and . "Sivuch" was sunk that day and "Korietz" was severely damaged; the ship managed to limp away but had to be scuttled the following day. On the 17th, "Posen" and "Nassau" engaged "Slava" at long range; they scored three hits on the Russian ship and forced her to return to port. By 19 August, the Russian minefields had been cleared and the flotilla entered the Gulf. Reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted the Germans to call off the operation the following day. Admiral Hipper later remarked, "To keep valuable ships for a considerable time in a limited area in which enemy submarines were increasingly active, with the corresponding risk of damage and loss, was to indulge in a gamble out of all proportion to the advantage to be derived from the occupation of the Gulf "before" the capture of Riga from the land side." In fact, the battlecruiser "Moltke" had been torpedoed that morning. On 21 August, Schmidt had his flag hauled down from "Posen" and disbanded the special unit.

By the end of August "Posen" and the rest of the High Seas Fleet had returned to their anchorages in the North Sea. The next operation conducted was a sweep into the North Sea on 11–12 September, though it ended without any action. Another fleet sortie followed on 23–24 October without encountering any British forces. On 4 March 1916, "Posen", "Nassau", "Westfalen", and "Von der Tann" steamed out to the Amrumbank to receive the <a href="auxiliary%20cruiser">auxiliary cruiser</a> , which was returning from a raiding mission.

Another uneventful advance into the North Sea took place on 21–22 April. A bombardment mission followed two days later; "Posen" joined the battleship support for Hipper's battlecruisers while they <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Yarmouth%20and%20Lowestoft">attacked Yarmouth and Lowestoft</a> on 24–25 April. During this operation, the battlecruiser "Seydlitz" was damaged by a British mine and had to return to port prematurely. Due to the poor visibility, the operation was soon called off, leaving the British fleet no time to intercept the raiders.

Admiral <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a>, who had succeeded Admirals von Ingenohl and <a href="Hugo%20von%20Pohl">Hugo von Pohl</a> as the fleet commander, immediately planned another attack on the British coast. The damage to "Seydlitz" and <a href="Condenser%20%28heat%20transfer%29">condenser</a> trouble on several of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts delayed the plan until the end of May. The German battlefleet departed the <a href="Jade%20Bight">Jade</a> at 03:30 on 31 May. "Posen" was assigned to the II Division of the I Battle Squadron as the flagship of Rear Admiral W. Engelhardt. "Posen" was the first ship in the division, ahead of her three sisters. The II Division was the last unit of dreadnoughts in the fleet; they were followed by only the elderly pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron.

Between 17:48 and 17:52, "Posen" and ten other German battleships engaged the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, though the range and poor visibility prevented effective fire. Shortly thereafter, two British destroyers— and —came under intense fire from the German line. "Posen" fired at "Nestor" with both her main battery and secondary guns. At 18:35, "Nestor" exploded and sank under the combined fire of eight battleships. By 20:15, the German fleet had faced the Grand Fleet for a second time and was forced to turn away; in doing so, the order of the German line was reversed. "Posen" was now the fourth ship in the line, astern of her three sisters.

At around 21:20, "Posen" and her sister ships were engaged by the battlecruisers of the <a href="3rd%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">3rd Battlecruiser Squadron</a>. "Posen" was the only ship on the I Battle Squadron to be able to make out a target, which turned out to be the battlecruisers and . "Posen" opened fire at 21:28 at a range of ; she scored one hit on "Princess Royal" at 21:32 and straddled "Indomitable" several times, surrounding her with a salvo of shells, before ceasing fire at 21:35.

At about 00:30, the leading units of the German line encountered British destroyers and cruisers. A violent firefight at close range ensued; the leading German battleships, including "Posen", opened fire on several British warships. In the confusion, the light cruiser passed through the German line directly in front of "Posen" and was rammed. "Posen" was undamaged, but both of "Elbing"s engine rooms were flooded and the ship came to a halt. Two and a half hours later, "Elbing" spotted several approaching British destroyers, and her captain gave the order to scuttle the ship.

Shortly before 01:00, the German line engaged a flotilla of British destroyers. "Posen" spotted the destroyers , , and at very close range; she opened fire on the first two ships at ranges between , seriously damaging "Porpoise". "Fortune" quickly sank under fire from "Posen" and several other battleships, but not before firing two torpedoes which "Posen" had to evade. At 01:25, "Westfalen" illuminated the destroyer and opened fire; "Posen" joined her shortly thereafter and reported several hits at ranges of .

Despite the ferocity of the night fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached <a href="Horns%20Reef">Horns Reef</a> by 04:00 on 1 June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later, where "Posen" and several other battleships from the I Battle Squadron took up defensive positions in the outer <a href="roadstead">roadstead</a>. Over the course of the battle, the ship had fired fifty-three 28 cm shells, sixty-four 15 cm rounds, and thirty-two 8.8 cm shells. The ship and her crew emerged from the battle completely unscathed by enemy fire.

Beginning in June 1917, <a href="Wilhelm%20von%20Krosigk">Wilhelm von Krosigk</a> served as the ship's commanding officer; he held this position until the end of the war in November 1918.

In February 1918, the German navy decided to send an expedition to Finland to support German army units to be deployed there. The Finns were engaged in a civil war; the <a href="White%20Guard%20%28Finland%29">White Finns</a> sought a conservative government free from the influence of the newly created <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, while the <a href="Red%20Guards%20%28Finland%29">Red Guards</a> preferred Soviet-style communism. On 23 February, two of "Posen"s sister ships—"Westfalen" and "Rheinland"—were assigned as the core of the "Sonderverband Ostsee" (Special Unit Baltic Sea). The two ships embarked the 14th <a href="J%C3%A4ger%20%28military%29">Jäger</a> Battalion. They departed for the <a href="%C3%85land%20Islands">Åland Islands</a> on the following morning. Åland was to be a forward operating base, from which the port of <a href="Hanko">Hanko</a> would be secured. From Hanko, the German expedition would assault the capital of <a href="Helsingfors">Helsingfors</a>. The task force reached the Åland Islands on 5 March, where they encountered the Swedish <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a>s , , and . Negotiations ensued, which resulted in the landing of the German troops on Åland on 7 March; "Westfalen" then returned to <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a>, where "Posen" was stationed.

On 31 March "Posen" and "Westfalen" left Danzig; the ships arrived at <a href="Russar%C3%B6">Russarö</a>, which was the outer defense for Hanko, by 3 April. The German army quickly took the port. The task force then proceeded to Helsingfors; on 11 April the ship passed into the harbor at Helsingfors and landed the soldiers. This included a detachment from the ship which was landed two days later on 13 April. During the operation, "Posen"s crew suffered four men killed and twelve wounded. From 18 to 20 April, "Posen" assisted with the efforts to free "Rheinland", which had been grounded. Two days later, "Posen" struck a sunken wreck in Helsingfors harbor, which caused minor damage. On 30 April the ship was detached from the "Sonderverband Ostsee". The ship returned to Germany, reaching Kiel by 3 May, where she entered drydock. Repair work lasted until 5 May.

On 11 August 1918, "Posen", "Westfalen", , and sortied from Wilhelmshaven to support torpedo boats on patrol off <a href="Terschelling">Terschelling</a>. On 2 October, "Posen" moved out into the outer roadsteads of the Jade to provide cover for the returning <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s of the <a href="Flanders%20Flotilla">Flanders Flotilla</a>. "Posen" was to have taken part in the <a href="Naval%20order%20of%2024%20October%201918">last fleet operation</a> of the war, planned for 30 October. The operation was intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, whatever the cost to the fleet. War-weary sailors <a href="Wilhelmshaven%20mutiny">mutinied</a>, which led to the operation being canceled. In an attempt to suppress the spread of mutinous sentiments, Admiral Hipper ordered the fleet dispersed. "Posen" and the other ships of the I Battle Squadron were sent out into the roadstead on 3 November, then returned to Wilhelmshaven on 6 November.

On 11 November 1918, the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a> took effect; according to its terms, eleven battleships and five battlecruisers were to be interned in <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> for the duration of negotiations for the peace treaty. "Posen" was not among the ships interned, and she was instead decommissioned on 16 December. The ships in Scapa Flow were <a href="scuttling%20of%20the%20German%20fleet%20in%20Scapa%20Flow">scuttled by their crews on 21 June 1919</a> to prevent them from being seized by the Allies. As a result, "Posen" and the other battleships that remained in Germany were seized as replacements for the ships that had been lost. On 5 November, "Posen" was stricken from the German navy list to be handed over to Great Britain. The ship was transferred on 13 May 1920; on 1 November 1920, she was driven ashore at <a href="Hawkcraig">Hawkcraig</a>, <a href="Fife">Fife</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The British subsequently sold "Posen" to ship-breakers in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. She was broken up in <a href="Dordrecht">Dordrecht</a> in 1922.

Clement of Dunblane

Clement (died 1258) was a 13th-century <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican</a> <a href="friar">friar</a> who was the first member of the Dominican Order in <a href="Great%20Britain">Britain</a> and <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> to become a <a href="Bishop%23Churches">bishop</a>. In 1233, he was selected to lead the ailing <a href="diocese%20of%20Dunblane">diocese of Dunblane</a> in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, and faced a struggle to bring the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Dunblane">bishopric of Dunblane</a> (or "bishopric of <a href="Strathearn">Strathearn</a>") to financial viability. This involved many negotiations with the powerful religious institutions and secular authorities which had acquired control of the revenue that would normally have been the entitlement of Clement's bishopric. The negotiations proved difficult, forcing Clement to visit the <a href="pope">papal</a> <a href="Roman%20curia">court</a> in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. While not achieving all of his aims, Clement succeeded in saving the bishopric from relocation to <a href="Inchaffray%20Abbey">Inchaffray Abbey</a>. He also regained enough revenue to begin work on the new <a href="Dunblane%20Cathedral">Dunblane Cathedral</a>.

He faced a similar challenge with the impoverished <a href="Bishop%20of%20Argyll">bishopric of Argyll</a> in the 1240s. He was given the job of restoring the viability of the <a href="diocese">diocese</a> and installing a new bishop; this involved forming a close relationship with King <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Scotland">Alexander II of Scotland</a>. Clement was with the king during his campaign in <a href="Argyll">Argyll</a> in 1249 and was at his side when he died during this campaign. In 1250 Clement had been able to install a new bishop in Argyll and had become one of the Guardians appointed to govern Scotland during the <a href="regent">minority</a> of King <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Scotland">Alexander III</a>. By 1250 he had established a reputation as one of the most active Dominican reformers in <a href="Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20Great%20Britain">Britain</a>. Clement helped to elevate <a href="Edmund%20Rich">Edmund of Abingdon</a> and <a href="Saint%20Margaret%20of%20Scotland">Queen Margaret</a> to sainthood. After his death, he received <a href="veneration">veneration</a> as a <a href="Saint%23Roman%20Catholicism">saint</a> himself, although he was never formally <a href="canonization">canonised</a>.

The "Analecta Ordinis Fratrum Praedicatorum" claims that he was "a Scot by birth", and that he was admitted into the Dominican Order of <a href="Paris">Paris</a> in 1219. The latter source, however, is often highly unreliable, and cannot be fully trusted. The historian <a href="Archie%20Duncan%20%28historian%29">Archie Duncan</a> was cautious about a date as firm and early as 1221, and wrote that Clement "had entered the Dominican order by the later 1220s". Although "Clement" is neither a <a href="Gaels">Scottish</a> nor an <a href="Anglo-Saxons">English</a> name, the large number of <a href="French%20language">French</a>-speakers in both Scotland and <a href="England">England</a> during this period means that this consideration carries limited weight; indeed "Clement" need not even have been his birth-name. The diocese of Dunblane was entirely <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Gaelic</a>-speaking in Clement's day, and in this era it was often frowned upon for a bishop to be ignorant of the language of his diocese. If this had been a consideration in Clement's later appointment, then this would strongly suggest that Clement was in fact a Scot. It is worth adding that Clement was later noted for his skill in languages. Clement received his university education at either the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> or the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">University of Paris</a>, perhaps at both of these institutions. There is a possibility that he can be identified more fully as "Clement Rocha". A "Father Clement Rocha" was the owner of a <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a> from the period now held in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. This, however, says nothing more about his background.

The Dominican Order had its origins in the reformist ideology of Dominic de Guzmán, later <a href="Saint%20Dominic">Saint Dominic</a>. By 1219, Dominic had established houses as far apart as Paris, <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> and <a href="Segovia">Segovia</a>; at his death in 1221, there were 21 houses. Expansion of the order continued into England as houses were established at Oxford in 1221 and London in 1224. There were five houses in England by 1230, by which time the Order was poised to enter Scotland. Later tradition had it that the Dominican Order entered Scotland in 1230, encouraged by King Alexander II and <a href="William%20de%20Malveisin">William de Malveisin</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20St%20Andrews">Bishop of St Andrews</a>. However, the earliest certain date for the foundation of a Dominican house in Scotland is 1234.

These details form the context for Clement's appearance in Scotland and his selection as the new <a href="Bishop%20of%20Dunblane">Bishop of Dunblane</a>. Three years had passed since the death of the last bishop, <a href="Osbert%20of%20Dunblane">Osbert</a>. Since there was no <a href="electoral%20college">electoral college</a> for the diocese, <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20IX">Pope Gregory IX</a> charged the bishops of St Andrews, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Brechin">Brechin</a> and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Dunkeld">Dunkeld</a>, to find and nominate a suitable replacement. There can only be informed speculation regarding the choice of Clement. Importantly, perhaps, King Alexander was later noted for "his concern for building churches for the Friars Preacher ["Fratrum precipue Predicatorum"]". The status of the Dominicans at the cutting edge of religious reform, together with Clement's background, may have been the decisive factors. At any rate, Clement was consecrated as bishop at <a href="Wedale">Wedale</a> on 4 September 1233, by William de Malveisin, Bishop of St Andrews. His consecration meant that he was the first Dominican in the British Isles to obtain a bishopric. This has prompted the historian Archie Duncan to comment that "the choice of the first friar-bishop ... can only be called daring".

The bishopric of Dunblane was a small <a href="diocese">diocese</a>, essentially confined to the <a href="earl">earl</a>doms of <a href="Strathearn">Strathearn</a> and <a href="Menteith">Menteith</a>. Size was a problem for providing the bishopric with adequate income, a problem compounded by the fact that <a href="Gille%20Brigte%2C%20Earl%20of%20Strathearn">Gille Brígte</a>, <a href="Mormaer%20of%20Strathearn">Mormaer of Strathearn</a>, had established <a href="Inchaffray%20Abbey">Inchaffray Priory</a> in 1200 (promoted to Abbey in 1221). In the 1440s, Bower wrote that Gille Brígte: Divided his earldom into three equal portions. One he gave to the church and bishop of Dunblane, the second to St John the Evangelist and the canons of Inchaffray, the third he kept for himself and his own needs. If this were not enough, much of the income not granted to Inchaffray had since been given to other religious institutions; some revenue was even controlled by the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Dunkeld">Bishop of Dunkeld</a>. Dunblane had its origins in an older Gaelic monastic establishment, that is, in an institution with an <a href="abbot">abbot</a>-bishop heading a relatively informal establishment of smaller cells with little geographical compactness. Dunblane emerged as a bishopric in 1155, probably, like bishoprics with a similar history (e.g. <a href="Bishop%20of%20Brechin">Brechin</a>), having changed in little more than name. There was a community of "<a href="Culdee">Céli Dé</a>" at <a href="Muthill">Muthill</a> until at least the end of the 13th century, and the base for the archdeaconry of the diocese appears to have varied between there and Dunblane until the time of Bishop Clement. The bishopric itself appears to have been without a single base, although it was probably associated with both locations.

Clement visited the papal court to present his difficult situation. In spring 1237, the Pope wrote to the Bishop of Dunkeld that: Bishop Clement ... found the Church so desolated that there was no place in the Cathedral Church where he could lay his head; it had no college of clergy; the divine offices were celebrated in a roofless church and by a rural chaplain only; and the <a href="Episcopal%20polity">episcopal</a> revenues were so slender, and had been alienated to such a degree, that they scarcely sufficed to support him for half a year.

In response to Clement's visit, moreover, the Pope had empowered the Bishops of Dunkeld, Brechin and St Andrews to take action to rescue the bishopric. He told these bishops that, Since the continual care of all the churches is our daily burden, we grant to the said Church [Dunblane], so far as we personally can, and authorise you, if you find the situation to be as described, to assign to the said Bishop, if it can be done without scandal, a quarter of the <a href="teinds">teinds</a> of all the parish churches of the Diocese of Dunblane, so that under your guidance and that of upright men, he may set aside a suitable portion of them for his own maintenance, and thereafter assign revenues for a dean and canons whom we wish and authorise you to institute there. Failing this, the Pope wrote, The quarter teinds of all the churches of the Diocese assigned to the Bishop, which are held by <a href="laity">laymen</a>, you shall transfer with the episcopal seat to the <a href="Canons%20regular">Canons Regular</a> of St. John in the Diocese [i.e. to Inchaffray Abbey], who shall have power to elect a Bishop in any vacancy.

So the Pope's help was two-sided. It made Clement's task vis-à-vis these institutions easier, but on the other hand the possibility had emerged that Dunblane could disappear as an episcopal centre.

In the three or four years after his visit to the papacy, agreements were made with the various institutions who were drawing income from Clement's diocese – namely <a href="Coupar%20Angus%20Abbey">Coupar Angus Abbey</a>, <a href="Lindores%20Abbey">Lindores Abbey</a>, <a href="Cambuskenneth%20Abbey">Cambuskenneth Abbey</a>, <a href="Arbroath%20Abbey">Arbroath Abbey</a>, the <a href="nunnery%20of%20North%20Berwick">nunnery of North Berwick</a> and the <a href="Hospital%23Medieval%20Europe">Hospital</a> of <a href="Brackley">Brackley</a>, <a href="Northamptonshire">Northamptonshire</a>. These agreements did not constitute complete success. Clement was able to recover some revenue, but in fixed payments liable to real decline by way of inflation. Moreover, he had to concede permanent canonries to several of the abbots, concessions which would give them a role in the election of his successors. Another partial set-back took place. <a href="Walter%20Comyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Badenoch%2C%20jure%20uxoris%20Earl%20of%20Menteith">Walter Comyn, Earl of Menteith</a>, had decided to found a <a href="monastery">monastery</a> in his earldom and take up the income of Menteith's churches to do it; the whole of Menteith constituted nearly half of the diocese. Despite the Pope's previously helpful behaviour towards Clement's cause, he granted the earl permission to found the new monastery. The earl established <a href="Inchmahome%20Priory">Inchmahome Priory</a> in the <a href="Lake%20of%20Menteith">Lake of Menteith</a> in 1238. Walter and Clement came to conflict over the new priory's rights, but in the same year an agreement was drawn up in a meeting of churchmen at <a href="Perth%2C%20Scotland">Perth</a>. The agreement placed most of Menteith's churches under the control of the earl; however, Clement obtained several concessions, including the right to receive episcopal dues from the new priory. Overall, Clement's successes were considerable considering the opposition which he faced, but even after his death, only 12 of the 26 parish churches in the diocese were under the bishop's direct control.

Although his successor <a href="Robert%20de%20Prebenda">Robert de Prebenda</a> claimed that the income of the <a href="episcopal%20see">see</a> was still inadequate, it was nevertheless enough for Clement to begin building a new cathedral. This was despite the virtual hostility of the earl of Menteith and what <a href="Cynthia%20Neville">Cynthia Neville</a> has noted as the lack of interest by the earls of Strathearn, evidenced by their reluctance to bestow patronage on the bishopric. Neville's explanation for this is that "the bishops' ambition represented a challenge to their proprietary interests". It has been suggested that Clement dismantled the small church building which had served Dunblane previously, before beginning work. The cathedral was constructed in the <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic manner</a>, beginning with the "Lady Chapel"; the Lady Chapel was used while the rest of the cathedral was being built. It is possible that the cathedral of Dunblane was completed during Clement's episcopate, and it is almost certain that most of it was.

Clement's position as Bishop of Dunblane provided the opportunity to participate on the larger national and international stage. In 1241, the <a href="Cistercians">Cistercian</a> general chapter began postulating the Pope about the saintliness of <a href="Edmund%20Rich">Edmund of Abingdon</a>, formerly <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. In the following year, various clerics wrote pieces and compiled evidence supporting this Edmund's claim to sainthood. Clement was one of these clerics. Edmund's saintliness was endorsed by <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20IV">Pope Innocent IV</a> in 1246. Clement took part in a similar campaign in 1249. He was part of the movement to canonise <a href="Saint%20Margaret%20of%20Scotland">Queen Margaret</a>, one of the ancestors of the contemporary Scottish kings. Clement was appointed to investigate her saintliness, and in the following year Margaret too was canonised. Meanwhile, in 1247, Pope Innocent IV gave Clement the more onerous and demanding appointment of papal tax collector. Clement was charged with collecting one twentieth of all ecclesiastical revenues within the Kingdom of the Scots. The purpose was to finance a <a href="Seventh%20Crusade">new crusade</a>, and Clement's appointment was part of a money-raising initiative carried out throughout <a href="Western%20Christendom">Western Christendom</a>.

Perhaps Clement's most significant activities were, however, in relation to the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Argyll">bishopric of Argyll</a>. In 1241, Argyll's last bishop, William, had been drowned while at sea. Argyll was the poorest bishopric in Scotland, and the area lacked strong royal authority, and hence good royal protection. In the following six years, no one had taken up the vacant bishopric. From at least 1247, then, Clement was given charge of the diocese. He was essentially being asked to do for Argyll what he had previously done for Strathearn. The sources are quite thin on this ground, but by 1249 he had brought at least one more church into the control of the bishopric. On 23 December 1248, he was also authorised by the Pope to appoint, with the agreement of the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Glasgow">Bishop of Glasgow</a>, a new bishop for Argyll. In January 1249, Clement was given permission to move the cathedral of Argyll, based on <a href="Lismore%2C%20Scotland">Lismore</a>, to the mainland. Clement's problem seems to have been with the ruler of Argyll, <a href="Ewen%20MacDougall">Eóghan</a>. The lack of royal authority in Argyll made it difficult for the national and international church to exercise control in the province; at the same time, establishing a strong bishopric in the area was vital to integrating the area fully into the kingdom, an aim cherished by the contemporary king, <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Scotland">Alexander II</a>. Thus Alexander's goal and Clement's goal were essentially one and the same. It is impossible to be more specific, but in 1249, King Alexander II launched an expedition against Eóghan. The king was attempting to force Eóghan, whose lands lay within both the overlordship of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</a> and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Norway">Kingdom of Norway</a>, to renounce his allegiance to the King of Norway. Eóghan told Alexander that he was unable to do this. The contemporary historian <a href="Matthew%20Paris">Matthew Paris</a> wrote that: The king therefore declared Eóghan unfaithful and pursued him hostilely by ship near Argyll; urged, as is said, by the vehement promptings of a certain indiscreet bishop of Strathearn, a friar to wit of the order of the Preachers. This "indiscreet bishop ... friar" was, of course, Clement. Alexander died from ill-health on this expedition, with Clement by his side at his deathbed. Alexander's last act was to make a grant to the bishopric of Argyll. Despite the king's death, the expedition was a success for Clement. There was a new Bishop of Argyll by 27 September 1250; in the longer term, the see continued to be ruled by bishops with no long vacancies until the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a>. Moreover, by 1255 Eóghan had given his full allegiance to the Scottish crown, albeit because of lack of favour given to him by the King of Norway.

Clement's close association with the late King Alexander II and his reputation as a successful bishop made him a key political figure during the minority of <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Scotland">Alexander III</a>. Clement was on the Council of Guardians, the small group of nobles and clerics who were to "govern" Scotland until the end of Alexander III's boyhood. The governing Council broke down around two rival factions, one centred on Walter Comyn and the other around <a href="Alan%20Durward">Alan Durward</a>. There is little evidence about Clement's activities in regard to the Council, but he was associated with the Comyn faction, who enjoyed the ascendency after Walter gained control of government in 1251. In 1255, the Durwards staged a coup at <a href="Roxburgh">Roxburgh</a> and ousted the "Comyn faction" from effective power. Unfortunately for Alan Durward, Comyn's supporter <a href="Gamelin%20%28bishop%29">Gamelin</a>, who had been placed in the bishopric of St Andrews and excluded from his diocese by Durward, had fled to the papal court and convinced the Pope to excommunicate Alan. The sentence was delivered by Bishop Clement and the abbots of <a href="Abbot%20of%20Melrose">Melrose</a> and <a href="Abbot%20of%20Jedburgh">Jedburgh</a>. This is Clement's last known act.

The "<a href="Chronicle%20of%20Melrose">Chronicle of Melrose</a>" reports Clement's death under the year 1258. Clement's legacy was to be remembered as the restorer of the diocese of Dunblane and the builder of its cathedral. Thus for future generations, Clement became the father-figure of the see. Clement was later commemorated as a saint, though there is no record of formal canonisation. He was commemorated on 19 March, meaning that was almost certainly believed to have been the date of his death. Clement's death was also noted by <a href="Walter%20Bower">Walter Bower</a>, a Lowland Scottish historian writing in the 1440s, who included the following obituary: Clement bishop of Dunblane died, that outstanding member of the Order of Preachers, a man most eloquent in translating various tongues, powerful in speech and action in the sight of God and of men. He found the cathedral church of his diocese reduced by the neglect of his predecessors to such a state of decay that the divine offices were celebrated in it scarcely three times a week, as if it were some rural chapel. He built it up to be a hallowed sanctuary, enriched it with lands and possessions, and increased its prestige by adding <a href="prebendary">prebends</a> and <a href="canonry">canonries</a>. Such flattering sentiments had even been expressed during Clement's lifetime. In 1250, the General Chapter of the Dominican Order met in London, and decreed that: we grant to Friar Clement of our Order, a bishop of Scotland, after his death, one mass throughout the Order by every friar whomsoever is a priest. Although there survives a sermon almost certainly written by him, Clement was also credited with being a prolific translator and writing four books (including a <a href="hagiography">hagiography</a> of St Dominic), all of which are now lost.

Some historians have been ambiguous about Clement's episcopate. For instance, Cynthia Neville, despite acknowledging that "the successful reform of the see was, in fact, accomplished almost exclusively as a consequence of the efforts of Clement and his successors", nevertheless expresses some scepticism about his achievements and notices his failure to gain the patronage of the <a href="Mormaer%20of%20Strathearn">native rulers of Strathearn</a>. Others have been more enthusiastic. The ecclesiastical historian and former minister of Dunblane Cathedral, James Hutchison Cockburn, agreed with Bower's eulogy and declared that the "title" of sainthood "would have been worthily bestowed". Archie Duncan, more recently, stated that Clement "clearly enjoyed a reputation far wider than his domestic accomplishments alone would explain" and concluded that Clement "represents the occasional triumph of the ideal of reform of church life over the careerism which generally motivated thirteenth-century clergy".

Original Stories from Real Life; with Conversations Calculated to Regulate the Affections, and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness is the only complete work of <a href="children%27s%20literature">children's literature</a> by the 18th-century English <a href="Feminism">feminist</a> author <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>. "Original Stories" begins with a <a href="frame%20story">frame story</a> that sketches out the education of two young girls by their maternal teacher Mrs. Mason, followed by a series of <a href="didacticism">didactic</a> tales. The book was first published by <a href="Joseph%20Johnson%20%28publisher%29">Joseph Johnson</a> in <a href="1788%20in%20literature">1788</a>; a second, illustrated edition, with engravings by <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>, was released in 1791 and remained in print for around a quarter of a century.

In "Original Stories", Wollstonecraft employed the then-burgeoning genre of children's literature to promote the education of women and an emerging middle-class ideology. She argued that women would be able to become rational adults if they were educated properly as children, which was not a widely held belief in the 18th century, and contended that the nascent middle-class ethos was superior to the court culture represented by <a href="fairy%20tales">fairy tales</a> and to the values of chance and luck found in <a href="chapbook">chapbook</a> stories for the poor. Wollstonecraft, in developing her own pedagogy, also responded to the works of the two most important educational theorists of the 18th century: <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a> and <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>.

Wollstonecraft's "<a href="wikt%3Aoeuvre">oeuvre</a>" shows "a keen and vital concern with education, especially the education of girls and women". One year before she published "Original Stories", she wrote a <a href="conduct%20book">conduct book</a> (a popular 18th-century genre, akin to the modern self-help book) entitled "<a href="Thoughts%20on%20the%20Education%20of%20Daughters">Thoughts on the Education of Daughters</a>" (1787), which describes how to raise the ideal middle-class woman. In 1789, she assembled "The Female Speaker", a text meant to edify the minds of young women by exposing them to literature; she modelled it after <a href="William%20Enfield">William Enfield's</a> anthology "The Speaker", which was designed specifically for men. Just one year later, she translated <a href="Christian%20Gotthilf%20Salzmann">Christian Gotthilf Salzmann's</a> "Elements of Morality", a popular German pedagogical text. Wollstonecraft continued writing on educational issues in her most famous work, "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1792), which is largely a defence of <a href="female%20education">female education</a>. She also devotes an entire chapter to outlining a national education plan—she envisioned a half-public, half-private, co-educational system. She also directly challenged <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Rousseau</a>'s "" (1762), which claimed that women should not be taught to reason since they were formed for men's pleasure and that their abilities lay in observation rather than reason. When Wollstonecraft died in 1797, she was working on two more educational works: "Management of Infants", a parenting manual; and "Lessons", a reading primer inspired by <a href="Anna%20Laetitia%20Barbauld">Anna Laetitia Barbauld</a>'s "<a href="Lessons%20for%20Children">Lessons for Children</a>" (1778–79).

Wollstonecraft was not alone in focusing her revolutionary writings on education; as Alan Richardson, a scholar of the period, points out, "most liberal and radical intellectuals of the time viewed education as the cornerstone of any movement for social reform". One reason these thinkers emphasized the training of the young mind was the pervasive acceptance during the 18th century of <a href="John%20Locke">Locke's</a> <a href="philosophy%20of%20mind">theory of mind</a>. He posited that the mind is a "blank slate" or "<a href="tabula%20rasa">tabula rasa</a>", free from innate ideas, and that because children enter the world without preconceived notions; whatever ideas they absorb early in life will fundamentally affect their later development. Locke explained this process through a theory he labelled the "<a href="Association%20of%20Ideas">association of ideas</a>"; the ideas that children connect, such as fear and darkness, are stronger than those ideas adults associate, therefore instructors, according to Locke, must carefully consider what they expose children to early in life.

Modelled on <a href="Madame%20de%20Genlis">Madame de Genlis's</a> "<a href="Ad%C3%A8le%20et%20Th%C3%A9odore">Adèle et Théodore</a>" (1782) and "<a href="Tales%20of%20the%20Castle">Tales of the Castle</a>" (1785), both of which have frame stories and a series of inset moral tales, "Original Stories" narrates the re-education of two young girls, fourteen-year-old Mary and twelve-year-old Caroline, by a wise and benevolent maternal figure, Mrs. Mason. (Wollstonecraft probably named these characters after people in her own life. She became acquainted with a Miss Mason while teaching in <a href="Newington%20Green">Newington Green</a>, whom she greatly respected, and she taught two girls named Mary and Caroline while she was a governess for the Kingsborough family in Ireland. <a href="Margaret%20King">Margaret King</a>, who was greatly affected by her governess, saying she "had freed her mind from all superstitions, later adopted "Mrs Mason" as a pseudonym.) After the death of their mother, the girls are sent to live with Mrs. Mason in the country. They are full of faults, such as greediness and vanity, and Mrs. Mason, through stories, real-world demonstrations, and her own example, cures the girls of most of their moral failings and imbues them with a desire to be virtuous.

Mrs. Mason's amalgam of tales and teaching excursions dominates the text; although the text emphasizes the girls' moral progress, the reader learns very little about the girls themselves. The work consists largely of personal histories of people known to Mrs. Mason and of moral tales for the edification of Mary and Caroline and the reader. For example, "The History of Charles Townley" illustrates the fatal consequences of procrastination. Mrs. Mason takes the girls to Charles Townley's ruined mansion to tell them the <a href="cautionary%20tale">cautionary tale</a> of a "boy of uncommon abilities, and strong feelings"; unfortunately, "he ever permitted those feelings to direct his conduct, without submitting to the direction of reason; I mean, the present emotion governed him ... He always indeed intended to act right in every particular "to-morrow"; but "to-day" he followed the prevailing whim" (emphasis Wollstonecraft's). Charles wants to help those in need, but he is easily distracted by novels and plays. He eventually loses all of his money but his one remaining friend helps him regain his fortune in India. Yet even when this friend needs assistance, Charles cannot act quickly enough and, tragically, his friend is imprisoned and dies and his friend's daughter is forced to marry a <a href="rake%20%28character%29">rake</a>. When Charles returns to England, he is overcome with guilt. He rescues the daughter from her unhappy marriage, but both she and he have gone slightly insane by the end of the story, she from her marriage and he from guilt.

"Original Stories" is primarily about leaving the imperfections of childhood behind and becoming a rational and charitable adult; it does not romanticise childhood as an innocent and ideal state of being. The inset stories themselves emphasise the balance of reason and emotion required for the girls to become mature, a theme that permeates Wollstonecraft's works, particularly "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>".

"Original Stories" gained a reputation in the 20th century as an oppressively didactic book and was derided by early scholars of children's literature such as Geoffrey Summerfield. Recent scholars, particularly Mitzi Myers, have re-evaluated Wollstonecraft's book and 18th-century children's literature in general, assessing it within its historical context rather than judging it according to modern tastes. Myers suggests, in her series of seminal articles, that women writers of children's literature such as Mary Wollstonecraft and <a href="Maria%20Edgeworth">Maria Edgeworth</a> were not only using the genre of children's literature to teach but also to promote visions of society distinct from those of the <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a>s. These authors believed that they could effect great change by exposing young children to their ideas of a better society, even though they were "only" writing stories about seemingly insignificant topics such as small animals or little girls. Myers argues that because scholars have traditionally paid more attention to Romantic poetry and prose (the works of <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a> and <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>, for example) than to children's literature, they have missed the social critique that these women writers of children's literature were offering.

The two most influential pedagogical works in 18th-century Europe were <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke's</a> "<a href="Some%20Thoughts%20Concerning%20Education">Some Thoughts Concerning Education</a>" (1693) and <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau's</a> "". In "Original Stories" and her other works on education, Wollstonecraft responds to these two works and counters with her own pedagogical theory.

Wollstonecraft follows Locke in emphasising the role of the senses in learning; for her, as Myers writes, "ideally, children should learn not from direct teaching but from living examples apprehended through the senses." Wollstonecraft's Mrs. Mason takes Mary and Caroline out into the world in order to instruct them—their very first lesson is a nature walk that teaches them not to torture but rather to respect animals as part of God's creation. Mrs. Mason uses the experiences of everyday life as a teaching tool because they are grounded in concrete realities and easily absorbed through the senses; she will seize on "a bad habit, a passerby, a visit, a natural scene, a holiday festivity" and then apply them to a moral lesson that she wants to inculcate into her pupils. Mrs. Mason also tells Mary and Caroline the unfortunate or tragic histories of people she has known, such as that of Jane Fretful, who died because of her bad behaviour; Jane was an angry and selfish little girl and eventually her anger affected her health and killed her. Her misbehaviour "broke her mother's heart" and "hastened her death"; Jane's guilt over this event and:

her peevish temper, preyed on her impaired constitution. She had not, by doing good, prepared her soul for another state, or cherished any hopes that could disarm death of its terrors, or render that last sleep sweet—its approach was dreadful!—and she hastened her end, scolding the physician for not curing her. Her lifeless countenance displayed the marks of convulsive anger; and she left an ample fortune behind her to those who did not regret her loss. They followed her to the grave on which no one shed a tear. She was soon forgotten; and I [says Mrs. Mason] only remember her, to warn you to shun her errors.

Mrs. Mason also takes her charges to visit models of virtue, such as Mrs. Trueman, who, though poor, still manages to be charitable and a comfort to her family. At the end of one visit, Mrs. Mason reminds the girls that Mrs. Trueman "loves truth, and she is ever exercising benevolence and love—from the insect, that she avoids treading on, her affection may be traced to that Being who lives for ever.—And it is from her goodness her agreeable qualities spring." Wollstonecraft also adheres to the Lockean conception of the mind as a "blank slate": in "Original Stories", Mrs. Mason describes her own mind using these same terms.

Wollstonecraft was not as receptive to Rousseau's ideas as she was to Locke's; she appropriated the aesthetic of the <a href="sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime</a> to challenge Rousseau's ideas regarding the education of women (discussed in more detail below). During the 18th century, "the sublime" was associated with awe, fear, strength and masculinity. As Myers writes, "to convey her message for female readers that achievement comes from within, Wollstonecraft substitutes the strength, force, and mental expansion associated with heroic sublime for the littleness, delicacy, and beauty that Rousseau and aestheticians such as Edmund Burke equate with womanhood". Unlike writers such as Rousseau and <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Burke</a>, who portray women as innately weak and silly, Wollstonecraft argues that women can indeed achieve the intellectual heights associated with the sublime.

Although Wollstonecraft disagreed with much of Rousseau's fundamental philosophy, she did agree with many of his educational methods, including his emphasis on teaching through example and experience rather than through <a href="wikt%3Aprecept">precept</a>. In this, she was following children's writers such as <a href="Thomas%20Day">Thomas Day</a> who, in his popular "<a href="The%20History%20of%20Sandford%20and%20Merton">The History of Sandford and Merton</a>" (1783–89), also emphasised learning by experience rather than by rote and rules. Gary Kelly, in his book on Wollstonecraft's thought, explains how this idea and others important to Wollstonecraft are reflected in the title to her work—"Original Stories from Real Life; with Conversations Calculated to Regulate the Affections, and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness":

The first part of the title indicates that the ‘stories’ are not merely fictitious but have a factual basis in domestic, quotidian life, though readers would understand ‘from real life’ to mean ‘based on’ or ‘adapted from real ‘life’, and not necessarily ‘representation of actual events’. The ‘stories’ are ‘original’ because narratives for children should start afresh in order to avoid continued ideological contamination from vulgar chapbooks or courtly ‘fairy tales’. The phrase ‘real life’ strengthens ‘original’, excluding both the artificial and the fictional or imaginary. ‘Conversations’ suggests familiar, familial discourse rather than formal moralising. ‘Calculated’ suggests a programme rationally determined. These ‘conversations’ and ‘stories’ are also to construct the youthful self in a particular way, by regulating ‘the affections’ or emotional self and forming ‘the mind’ or rational and moral self ‘to truth and goodness’—understood in terms of professional middle-class culture.
As Richardson explains, in "Original Stories" adulthood is defined by the ability to discipline oneself by "constructing moral tales" out of one's life. Wollstonecraft's extensive use of inset tales encourages her readers to construct a moral narrative out of their own lives, with a predetermined ending. At the end of the book, Mary and Caroline no longer require a teacher because they have learnt the storylines which Mrs. Mason has taught them—they know the stories that they are supposed to enact.

As in the "<a href="Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>", Wollstonecraft does not highlight the differences between men and women as much as she emphasizes the importance of virtue in "Original Stories". Moreover, she defines virtue in such a way that it applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, virtue was tied to femininity and chastity, but Wollstonecraft's text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should be characterized by reason and self-control. Myers has also pointed out that Mrs. Mason's desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by <a href="conduct%20book">conduct book</a> writers such as <a href="James%20Fordyce">James Fordyce</a> and <a href="John%20Gregory%20%28moralist%29">John Gregory</a> and philosophers such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary status of their gender.

But it was against Rousseau's depiction of femininity and female education that Wollstonecraft was most vigorously reacting in "Original Stories". Rousseau argued in "Emile" that women were naturally cunning and manipulative, but he viewed these traits positively:

[G]uile is a natural talent with the fair sex, and since I am persuaded that all the natural inclinations are good and right in themselves, I am of the opinion that this one should be cultivated like the others... This peculiar cleverness given to the fair sex is a very equitable compensation for their lesser share of strength, a compensation without which women would be not man’s companion but his slave. It is by means of this superiority in talent that she keeps herself his equal and that she governs him while obeying him... She has in her favor only her art and her beauty.

For Rousseau, women possessed "guile" and "beauty" that allowed them to control men while men possessed "strength" and "reason" that allowed them to control women. In contrast to Rousseau's presentation of Sophie, the fictional figure he employs in Book V of "Emile" to represent the ideal woman, who is enamoured of her own image in a mirror and who falls in love with a character in a novel, Wollstonecraft depicts Mrs. Mason as a rational and sincere teacher who attempts to pass those traits on to Mary and Caroline.

"Original Stories" encourages its readers to develop what were at the time coming to be labelled middle-class values: industry, self-discipline, economy, and charity. As Andrew O’Malley points out in his analysis of 18th-century children's books, "middle-class writers wanted children to associate happiness with morality and social utility instead" of "the trappings of wealth and status". The end of the 18th century saw the development of what is now referred to as the "middle-class ethos", and "children’s literature became one of the crucial mechanisms for disseminating and consolidating middle-class ideology" throughout British and American society. Works by children's writers such as <a href="Anna%20Laetitia%20Barbauld">Anna Laetitia Barbauld</a>, <a href="Ellenor%20Fenn">Ellenor Fenn</a>, <a href="Sarah%20Trimmer">Sarah Trimmer</a>, and <a href="Dorothy%20Kilner">Dorothy Kilner</a> all embrace this ethos, although they differ radically in their opinions on other political issues, such as the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>.

One way that writers such as Wollstonecraft helped to shape the new genre of children's literature at the end of the 18th century was by attempting to remove its <a href="chapbook">chapbook</a> and <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a> associations and replace them with a middle-class ideology. Many of these writers considered chapbooks and fairy tales to be associated with the poor and the rich, respectively. As Kelly explains, "traditional chapbook literature embodies a lottery mentality of carpe diem, belief in fortune, wish for lucky gifts (such as great strength, cleverness or beauty), a view of time as cyclical or repetitive and an avid interest in predicting the future." In contrast, 18th-century children's literature "embodies an investment mentality. This meant saving for the future, ‘proper’ distribution of personal resources, avoiding extravagance, conceiving of time and one's own life as cumulative and progressive, and valuing self-discipline and personal development for a better future under one's own control." Sarah Trimmer, for example, contends in her "<a href="The%20Guardian%20of%20Education">Guardian of Education</a>", the first successful periodical dedicated to reviewing children’s books, that children should not read fairy tales precisely because they will lead to slothfulness and superstition.

<a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>, who often did illustrative work for Wollstonecraft's publisher <a href="Joseph%20Johnson%20%28publisher%29">Joseph Johnson</a>, was engaged to design and engrave six plates for the second edition of "Original Stories". Blake scholars tend to read these plates as challenges to Wollstonecraft’s text. For example, Orm Mitchell, basing his interpretation on <a href="William%20Blake%27s%20mythology">Blake's personal mythology</a> (which is elaborated in his other works) argues that in the frontispiece to the work:

The two girls gaze out wistfully from beneath the outstretched arms of Mrs. Mason. The hats that the children wear are drawn in such a way that they form halos around their heads, a touch Blake also uses in "<a href="Songs%20of%20Innocence%20and%20of%20Experience">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</a>" to indicate the innate and divine visionary capacity of the child (see for example "The Ecchoing Green" and "The Little [B]oy Found"). The children’s eyes are open—"they" are looking at what a fine morning it is and longing to take part in it. They cannot participate, however, for they are under the suffocating influence of Mrs. Mason. In contrast to the children’s halo-like hats Mrs. Mason wears a large cumbrous bonnet. Her eyes are downcast to such an extent that they appear to be shut. Blake often draws <a href="Urizen">Urizen's</a> eyes in this way to signify the blindness of his rational and materialist ‘Single vision.’ See for example plates 1, 9 and 22 of "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20Urizen">The Book of Urizen</a>" and plate 11 of "For Children: The Gates of Paradise" where Urizenic 'Aged Ignorance,’ wearing large spectacles, blindly clips the wings of a child thus preventing its imaginative flight in the morning sunrise. Ironically then, Mrs. Mason is the only individual in the illustration who is "not" seeing what a fine morning it is. She looks down at the hard factual earth, ignoring the infinite and holy life around her. (emphasis Mitchell's)

Myers, in contrast, relying on a more traditional <a href="art%20history">art historical</a> interpretation of the image, reads it more positively. She agrees that the children's hats resemble halos but she identifies Mrs. Mason's position as one of a "protective cruciform", evoking a "heroic, even Christlike ... female mentorial tradition". Myers views Mrs. Mason as a sacrificial hero rather than as an oppressive adult who cannot see the glories of nature.

"Original Stories" was first published anonymously in 1788, the same year as Wollstonecraft's first novel "", and cost two <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s. When the second edition came out in 1791, Wollstonecraft's name was printed on the title page; after the publication in 1790 of her "<a href="Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Men">Vindication of the Rights of Men</a>", she had become well known and her name would have boosted sales. <a href="Joseph%20Johnson%20%28publisher%29">Joseph Johnson</a>, the publisher of "Original Stories" and all of Wollstonecraft's other works, commissioned <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a> to design six illustrations for the second edition, which cost two shillings and six <a href="pence">pence</a>. It is not entirely clear how long the book remained continuously in print. According to Gary Kelly, a prominent Wollstonecraft scholar, the last edition of "Original Stories" was published in 1820, but without Wollstonecraft's name on the title page; by that time she had become a reviled figure in Britain because her husband, <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a>, had revealed her unorthodox lifestyle in his "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20the%20Author%20of%20A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1798). According to Alan Richardson and the editors of the "Masterworks of Children's Literature" series, "Original Stories" was published until 1835. It was also printed in Dublin in 1791 and 1799 and translated into German in 1795.

By the time <a href="Caroline%20Hewins">C. M. Hewins</a>, a librarian for the Hartford Library Association who wrote children's books herself, wrote a "History of Children's Books" in "The Atlantic Monthly" in 1888, "Original Stories" was more famous for its plates by Blake than it was for its text by Wollstonecraft. The bulk of the article's discussion is dedicated to Blake, although, strangely enough, not to his work on "Original Stories". Hewins does mention that the book was "new and in demand in the autumn of that year [1791], [but is] now unknown to the bookstalls". "Original Stories" is now primarily reprinted for scholars, students, and those interested in the history of children's literature.

Suillus bovinus

Suillus bovinus, also known as the Jersey cow mushroom or bovine bolete, is a <a href="Boletales">pored mushroom</a> of the genus "<a href="Suillus">Suillus</a>" in the family <a href="Suillaceae">Suillaceae</a>. A common fungus native to Europe and Asia, it has been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> to North America and Australia. It was initially described as "Boletus bovinus" by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in 1753, and given its current binomial name by <a href="Henri%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Anne%20de%20Roussel">Henri François Anne de Roussel</a> in 1806. It is an <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible mushroom</a>, though not highly regarded.

The fungus grows in <a href="coniferous%20forest">coniferous forest</a>s in its native range, and pine <a href="plantation">plantation</a>s in countries where it has become <a href="Naturalisation%20%28biology%29">naturalised</a>. It forms <a href="symbiotic">symbiotic</a> <a href="ectomycorrhiza">ectomycorrhiza</a>l associations with living trees by enveloping the tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue, and is sometimes parasitised by the related mushroom "<a href="Gomphidius%20roseus">Gomphidius roseus</a>". "Suillus bovinus" produces <a href="spore">spore</a>-bearing <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a>, often in large numbers, above ground. The mushroom has a convex grey-yellow or ochre <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> reaching up to in diameter, which flattens with age. Like other boletes, it has tubes extending downward from the underside of the cap, rather than <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a>; spores escape at maturity through the tube openings, or pores. The pore surface is yellow. The <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>, more slender than those of other "Suillus" boletes, lacks a <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a>.

"Suillus bovinus" was one of the many species first <a href="species%20description">described</a> in 1753 by the "father of taxonomy" <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>, who, in the second volume of his "<a href="Species%20Plantarum">Species Plantarum</a>", gave it the name "Boletus bovinus". The <a href="botanical%20name">specific epithet</a> is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "bos", meaning "cattle". The fungus was reclassified in (and became the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of) the genus "<a href="Suillus">Suillus</a>" by French naturalist <a href="Henri%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Anne%20de%20Roussel">Henri François Anne de Roussel</a> in 1796. "Suillus" is an ancient term for fungi, and is derived from the word "swine". <a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Quélet</a> classified it as "Viscipellis bovina" in 1886.

In works published before 1987, the species was written fully as "Suillus bovinus" (L.:<a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Fr.</a>) <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Kuntze</a>, as the description by Linnaeus had been <a href="sanctioned%20name">name sanctioned</a> in 1821 by the "father of mycology", Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries. The starting date for all the <a href="mycota">mycota</a> had been set by general agreement as 1 January 1821, the date of Fries's work. Furthermore, as Roussel's description of "Suillus" predated this as well, the authority for the genus was assigned to Otto Kuntze. The 1987 edition of the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Botanical%20Nomenclature">International Code of Botanical Nomenclature</a> changed the rules on the starting date and primary work for names of fungi, and names can now be considered <a href="Validly%20published%20name%20%28botany%29">valid</a> as far back as 1 May 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus's work.

<a href="Common%20name">Common name</a>s include Jersey cow mushroom, bovine bolete, and euro cow bolete. One proposed origin for the scientific name is that medieval knights—who revered "<a href="Tricholoma%20equestre">Tricholoma equestre</a>"—considered this mushroom fit only for cattle-drovers as it was not highly valued.

A limited genetic sampling of species in a 1996 study by Annette Kretzer and colleagues showed "Suillus bovinus" was related to a <a href="lineage%20%28evolution%29">lineage</a> that diverged to "<a href="Suillus%20punctipes">S. punctipes</a>", "<a href="Suillus%20variegatus">S. variegatus</a>" and "<a href="Suillus%20tomentosus">S. tomentosus</a>". A 2001 study found it was not closely related to other European species, and that all populations tested were more closer to each other than any other and hence it was a cohesive species.

Czech mycologist Josef Šutara <a href="circumscription%20%28taxonomy%29">circumscribed</a> the genus "Mariaella" in 1987, assigning "Mariaella bovina" as the type species. "Mariaella" contained "Suillus" species in <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> "Fungosi". Molecular studies do not support the existence of "Mariaella", and so it is considered <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonymous</a> with "Suillus". Older synonyms for "S. bovinus" include those resulting from generic transfers to "<a href="Agaricus">Agaricus</a>" by <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lamarck">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a> in 1783, and the now-obsolete "Ixocomus" by <a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Quélet</a> in 1888.

In 1951, <a href="Arthur%20Anselm%20Pearson">Arthur Anselm Pearson</a> described the <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> " Boletus bovinus" var. "viridocaerulescens", which was later transferred to "Suillus" by <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a> in 1961. This variant, collected in <a href="Western%20Cape%20Province">Western Cape Province</a>, South Africa, differs from the main form by the staining reaction of the cap flesh, which turns dark or light greenish-blue upon injury. <a href="Index%20Fungorum">Index Fungorum</a> does not, however, recognise the variety as having independent <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> significance.

Chemical analysis of <a href="biological%20pigment">pigments</a> and <a href="wikt%3Achromogen">chromogens</a> showed that "Suillus" was more closely related to "<a href="Gomphidius">Gomphidius</a>" and "<a href="Rhizopogon">Rhizopogon</a>" than to other boletes, and hence "Suillus bovinus" and its allies were transferred from the <a href="Boletaceae">Boletaceae</a> to the newly circumscribed family <a href="Suillaceae">Suillaceae</a> in 1997. <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular</a> studies have reinforced how distantly related these fungi are from "<a href="Boletus%20edulis">Boletus edulis</a>" and its allies.

The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit body</a>—colloquially called a mushroom—of "Suillus bovinus" is smaller and daintier than most other boletes. The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is initially convex, then flat with a wavy margin and a grey-yellow or ochre with pink tinge in some specimens. It ranges from in diameter and has a sticky <a href="pileipellis">skin</a>. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is whitish, yellowish or clay-coloured and has a fruity smell. Sometimes turning a pink tinge when bruised, the flesh is spongy and rubbery. Like other boletes, it has pores instead of <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> that make up the <a href="hymenophore">hymenophore</a> on the underside of the cap. "Suillus bovinus" has a characteristic compound pore layer, consisting of an outer layer of coarse, angular pores overlaying an inner layer of finer pores. The pores are grey- to olive-yellow and generally <a href="decurrent">decurrent</a>, comprising yellow to olive-yellow tubes that measure long. The tall stipe, similar in colour to the cap, tends to be narrower towards the base. With a diameter of , it is more slender than those of other boletes.

The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is an olive-brown colour. The oval to spindle-shaped <a href="basidiospore">spores</a> have dimensions of 8–10 by 3.5–4.5 <a href="micrometre">μm</a>. <a href="Basidia">Basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to narrowly club-shaped, measuring 22.4–33.4 by 5.8–8.0 μm. They bear four <a href="sterigmata">sterigmata</a> (each holding a single spore), which are up to 6.8 μm long. <a href="Cystidia">Cystidia</a> are present on both the tube ends (cheilocystidia) and tube faces (pleurocystidia). There are no <a href="clamp%20connection">clamp connection</a>s in the <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e of "Suillus bovinus". The <a href="pileipellis">cap cuticle</a> comprises filamentous, gelatinized hyphae with a diameter of 2.6–5.0 μm. The <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a> has a pink tinge.

The distinctive colour of the cap and pores make it hard to confuse with other species. Often found in similar habitats is "S. variegatus", though this species has a granular cap and dark olive pores, which are smaller and not decurrent. It can also bruise blue.

"Suillus bovinus" is found in <a href="conifer">conifer</a> woods and plantations across Europe, including <a href="subalpine">subalpine</a> regions in the Alps, up to altitudes of 800 m (2500 ft). It is common in Lithuania, where it associates with <a href="Scots%20pine">Scots pine</a> ("Pinus sylvestris"), the only naturally occurring pine in that country. Preferred soils of "S. bovinus" are often <a href="soil%20pH">acidic</a>, sand-based, or sometimes calcareous (chalky) and <a href="moraine">moraine</a>. In Asia, it has been recorded in Taiwan, and in Japan, where it associates with <a href="Japanese%20red%20pine">Japanese red pine</a> ("Pinus densiflora"). In China, it has been recorded from provinces <a href="Anhui">Anhui</a>, <a href="Fujian">Fujian</a>, <a href="Guangdong">Guangdong</a>, <a href="Hunan">Hunan</a>, <a href="Jiangxi">Jiangxi</a>, and <a href="Zhejiang">Zhejiang</a>.

"Suillus bovinus" has been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> into other areas. In North America, where it is thought to have been introduced with Scots pine, it is found in the eastern United States, including <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a>, and the <a href="Adirondack%20Mountains">Adirondack Mountains</a> of <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. It has been recorded infrequently under Scots pine in Australia, where it has been found as far north as southern Queensland, and in more southerly locations including <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and <a href="Kuitpo%20Forest">Kuitpo Forest</a>. It has been recorded in New Zealand. In South Africa, it grows with "<a href="Pinus%20radiata">Pinus radiata</a>".

"Suillus bovinus" is <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l, forming symbiotic associations with living trees by enveloping the tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue. Field work in pine forests in Sweden analysing the population structure of "Suillus bovinus" found that mushrooms were more abundant in younger forests and forests with disturbed areas, which contained a higher number of genets (<a href="Clonal%20colony">colonies</a>)—700 to 5700 per <a href="hectare">hectare</a>—compared with 30 to 120 genets per hectare in mature stands. Older colonies in mature forests could be in diameter against diameter in young forests. Spore-bearing mushrooms (sporocarps) produce a huge number of spores (estimated in a Finnish study at 240 million to 1.2 billion per mushroom), of which only a small number grow successfully; this large number is thought to explain the larger numbers of colonies in disturbed and young forests, while the fungus' vegetative spread becomes more important in established forests. Colonies of "S. bovinus" do not overlap, which indicates they suppress each other's growth. The <a href="median">median</a> lifespan of a colony was estimated to be 36 years. Field work conducted in Swedish pine forests suggested that "S. variegatus" suppressed the growth of "S. bovinus", as there was a negative correlation in occurrence.

A Finnish study published in 1997 found that bacterial communities under "P. sylvestris" without mycorrhizae metabolised <a href="organic%20acid">organic</a> and <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s, while communities among "S. bovinus" metabolised <a href="mannitol">mannitol</a>, a <a href="sugar%20alcohol">sugar alcohol</a>. The mycelia also extended the environment in the soil that the bacteria were able to grow in. An experimental study in Portugal showed that "<a href="Pinus%20pinaster">Pinus pinaster</a>" trees grew better after being inoculated with mycelium from "S. bovinus", "<a href="Laccaria%20laccata">Laccaria laccata</a>" and "<a href="Lactarius%20deterrimus">Lactarius deterrimus</a>" and spores of "<a href="Pisolithus%20tinctorius">Pisolithus tinctorius</a>" and "<a href="Scleroderma%20citrinum">Scleroderma citrinum</a>". These fungi were proposed as an alternative for chemical fertiliser in <a href="arboriculture">arboriculture</a> of pine trees. "Suillus bovinus" has been shown to improve the tolerance of its host "Pinus sylvestris" to metal pollutants such as <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a> and <a href="zinc">zinc</a>, though not to hazardous organic compounds such as <a href="m-Toluic%20acid">"m"-toluate</a>.

Experimental work in 1986 showed that "Suillus bovinus" could metabolise proteins and <a href="peptide">peptide</a>s directly, causing a drop in nitrogen in <a href="growth%20media">growth media</a>, which suggested the species has some <a href="saprophytic">saprophytic</a> activity.

The related rosy spike-cap ("<a href="Gomphidius%20roseus">Gomphidius roseus</a>") is found exclusively with this species, and is now thought to be <a href="parasitism">parasitic</a> upon the <a href="mycelia">mycelium</a> of "Suillus bovinus". This is evidenced by microscopic examination, which shows that "G. roseus" inserts <a href="Haustorium">haustoria</a> in plant root cells and does not produce significant mycelium itself. Furthermore, "G. roseus" is never found growing in isolation, only with "S. bovinus" though the latter species is found without the former. "<a href="Dicranophora%20fulva">Dicranophora fulva</a>" is a yellow <a href="mould">mould</a> that has been found growing on decaying "S. bovinus" fruit bodies in Europe and the United States.

"Suillus bovinus" tastes mild and is <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, although it is not highly regarded. When cooked, it releases a lot of fluid, which can be collected and reduced or strained to make a sauce. Its flavour is made more intense by drying. The soft and rubbery consistency of older specimens—as well as their proneness to maggot infestation—renders them almost inedible. Fruit bodies are part of the later summer diet of the <a href="red%20squirrel">red squirrel</a> in Eurasia, which collect the mushrooms and store them in <a href="tree%20fork">tree fork</a>s for a ready food supply after the onset of frost. There are several <a href="fly">fly</a> species that often use "S. bovinus" fruit bodies to rear their young, including "<a href="Bolitophila%20rossica">Bolitophila rossica</a>", "<a href="Exechia%20separata">Exechia separata</a>", "<a href="Exechiopsis%20indecisa">Exechiopsis indecisa</a>", "<a href="Pegomya%20deprimata">Pegomya deprimata</a>", and "<a href="Pegohylemyia%20silvatica">Pegohylemyia silvatica</a>".

Hoysala literature

Hoysala literature is the large body of literature in the <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> and <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> languages produced by the <a href="Hoysala%20Empire">Hoysala Empire</a> (1025–1343) in what is now <a href="southern%20India">southern India</a>. The empire was established by <a href="Nripa%20Kama%20II">Nripa Kama II</a>, came into political prominence during the rule of King <a href="Vishnuvardhana">Vishnuvardhana</a> (1108–1152), and declined gradually after its defeat by the <a href="Khalji%20dynasty">Khalji dynasty</a> invaders in 1311.

<a href="Kannada%20literature">Kannada literature</a> during this period consisted of writings relating to the socio-religious developments of the <a href="Jain">Jain</a> and <a href="Veerashaiva">Veerashaiva</a> faiths, and to a lesser extent that of the <a href="Vaishnavism">Vaishnava</a> faith. The earliest well-known <a href="brahmin">brahmin</a> writers in Kannada were from the Hoysala court. While most of the courtly textual production was in Kannada, an important corpus of <a href="monastery">monastic</a> <a href="Vaishnava">Vaishnava</a> literature relating to "<a href="Dvaita">Dvaita</a>" (dualistic) philosophy was written by the renowned philosopher <a href="Madhvacharya">Madhvacharya</a> in Sanskrit.

Writing Kannada literature in native <a href="Meter%20%28poetry%29">metres</a> was first popularised by the court poets. These metres were the "sangatya", compositions sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument; "shatpadi", six-line verses; "ragale", lyrical compositions in blank verse; and "<a href="tripadi">tripadi</a>", three-line verses. However, Jain writers continued to use the traditional "<a href="champu">champu</a>", composed of prose and verse. Important literary contributions in Kannada were made not only by court poets but also by noblemen, commanders, ministers, ascetics and saints associated with monasteries.

Beginning with the 12th century, important socio-political changes took place in the <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan</a>, south of the <a href="Krishna%20river">Krishna river</a>. During this period, the Hoysalas, native <a href="Kannadiga">Kannadiga</a>s from the <a href="Malnad">Malnad</a> region (hill country in modern Karnataka) were on the ascendant as a political power. They are known to have existed as chieftains from the mid-10th century when they distinguished themselves as subordinates of the <a href="Western%20Chalukyas">Western Chalukyas</a> of Kalyani. In 1116, Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana defeated the <a href="Chola%20dynasty">Cholas</a> of <a href="Tanjore">Tanjore</a> and annexed Gangavadi (parts of modern southern Karnataka), thus bringing the region back under native rule. In the following decades, with the waning of the Chalukya power, the Hoysalas proclaimed independence and grew into one of the most powerful ruling families of southern India. Consequently, literature in Kannada, the local language, flourished in the Hoysala empire. This literature can be broadly subdivided as follows: works dominated by the themes of Jain writings, contrasting works by Veerashaiva writers not belonging to the <a href="vachana">vachana</a> poetic tradition, rebuttals to Shaiva writings from Jain writers, early brahminical works (Vaishnava), works from the birth of the <a href="Bhakti">Bhakti</a> (devotional) movement in the Kannada-speaking region, writings on secular topics, and the first writings in native metres ("ragale", "sangatya" and "shatpadi").

As in earlier centuries, Jain authors wrote about <a href="tirthankar">tirthankar</a>s (saints), princes and other personages important to the Jain religion. Jain versions of the Hindu epics such as the <a href="Ramayana">Ramayana</a> and <a href="Bhagavata%20Purana">Bhagavata</a> (tales of Hindu god Krishna) were also written. According to R. Narasimhacharya, a noted scholar on Kannada literature, more Jain writers wrote in Kannada than in any other Dravidian language during the "Augustan age" of Kannada literature, from the earliest known works to the 12th century. The Veerashaiva writers, devotees of the <a href="Hinduism">Hindu</a> god <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a>, wrote about his 25 forms in their <a href="Expository%20preaching">expositions</a> of <a href="Shaivism">Shaivism</a>. Vaishnava authors wrote treatments of the Hindu epics, the Ramayana, the <a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> and the Bhagavata. Breaking away from the old Jain tradition of using the "champu" form for writing Kannada literature, <a href="Harihara%20%28poet%29">Harihara</a> penned poems in the "ragale" metre in "Siva-ganada-ragalegalu" (1160). His nephew Raghavanka established the "shatpadi" tradition by writing a unique version of the story of King <a href="Harishchandra">Harishchandra</a> in "Harishchandra Kavya" (1200). Sisumayana introduced the "sangatya" metre in his "Anjanacharita" and "Tripuradahana" (1235). However, some scholars continued to employ Sanskritic genres such as "champu" ("Ramachandra Charitapurana"), "shataka" (100 verse compositions, "Pampa sataka") and "ashtaka" (eight line verse compositions, "Mudige ashtaka").

The exact beginnings of the <a href="haridasa">haridasa</a> movement in the Kannada-speaking region have been disputed. Belur Keshavadasa, a noted "<a href="Harikatha">Harikatha</a>" scholar, claimed in his book "Karnataka Bhaktavijaya" that the movement was inspired by saint Achalananda Dasa of Turvekere (in the modern <a href="Tumkur%20district">Tumkur district</a>) in the 9th century. However, neither the language used in Achalananda Dasa's compositions nor the discovery of a composition with the pen name "Achalanada Vitthala", which mentions the 13th-century philosopher Madhvacharya, lends support to the 9th-century theory. <a href="Naraharitirtha">Naraharitirtha</a> (1281), one of earliest disciples of Madhvacharya, is therefore considered the earliest haridasa to write Vaishnava compositions in Kannada. Secular topics were popular and included treatises on poetry ("Sringararatnakara") and writings on natural sciences ("Rattasutra"), mathematics ("Vyavaharaganita"), fiction ("Lilavati"), grammar ("<a href="Shabdamanidarpana">Shabdamanidarpana</a>"), rhetoric ("Udayadityalankara") and others.

Important contributions were made by some prominent literary families. One Jain family produced several authors, including Mallikarjuna, the noted anthologist (1245); his brother-in-law Janna (1209), the court poet of King <a href="Veera%20Ballala%20II">Veera Ballala II</a>; Mallikarjuna's son <a href="Keshiraja">Keshiraja</a> (1260), considered by D. R. Nagaraj, a scholar on literary cultures in history, to be the greatest theorist of Kannada grammar; and Sumanobana, who was in the court of King <a href="Narasimha%20I">Narasimha I</a> and was the maternal grandfather of Keshiraja. Harihara (1160) and his nephew Raghavanka (1200), poets who set the trend for using native metres, came from a Shaiva family (devotees of the god Shiva).

The support of the Hoysala rulers for the Kannada language was strong, and this is seen even in their <a href="Epigraphy">epigraph</a>s, often written in polished and poetic language, rather than prose, with illustrations of floral designs in the margins. In addition to the Hoysala patronage, royal support was enjoyed by Kannada poets and writers during this period in the courts of neighbouring kingdoms of the western <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan</a>. The Western Chalukyas, the <a href="Kalachuris%20of%20Kalyani">Southern Kalachuris</a>, the <a href="Seuna%20Yadavas%20of%20Devagiri">Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri</a> and the <a href="Shilaharas%20of%20Southern%20Maharashtra">Silharas</a> of <a href="Kolhapur">Kolhapur</a> are some of the ruling families who enthusiastically used Kannada in inscriptions and promoted its literature.

Writers bilingual in Kannada and <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a> gained popularity which caused interaction between the two languages, a trend that continued into modern times. The Veerashiva canon of the Kannada language was translated or adapted into Telugu from this time period. Palkuriki Somanatha (1195), a devotee of social reformer <a href="Basavanna">Basavanna</a>, is the most well-known of these bilingual poets. The Chola chieftain Nannechoda (c. 1150) used many Kannada words in his Telugu writings. After the decline of the Hoysala empire, the <a href="Vijayanagara%20empire">Vijayanagara empire</a> kings further supported writers in both languages. In 1369, inspired by Palkuriki Somanatha, Bhima Kavi translated the Telugu "Basavapurana" to Kannada, and King <a href="Deva%20Raya%20II">Deva Raya II</a> (c. 1425) had <a href="Chamarasa">Chamarasa</a>'s landmark writing "Prabhulingalile" translated into Telugu and <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a>. Many Veerashaiva writers in the court of the 17th century <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Mysore">Kingdom of Mysore</a> were multilingual in Kannada, Telugu and Sanskrit while the <a href="Srivaishnava">Srivaishnava</a> (a sect of Vaishnavism) Kannada writers of the court were in competition with the Telugu and Sanskrit writers. 
Information from contemporary records regarding several writers from this period whose works are considered lost include: Maghanandi (probable author of "Rama Kathe" and guru of Kamalabhava of 1235), Srutakirti (guru of Aggala, and author of "Raghava Pandaviya" and possibly a "Jina-stuti", 1170), Sambha Varma (mentioned by Nagavarma of 1145), Vira Nandi ("Chandraprabha Kavyamala", 1175), Dharani Pandita ("Bijjala raya Charita" and "Varangana Charita"), Amrita Nandi ("Dhanvantari Nighantu"), Vidyanatha ("Prataparudriya"), Ganeshvara ("Sahitya Sanjivana"), Harabhakta, a Veerashaiva mendicant ("Vedabhashya", 1300), and Siva Kavi (author of "Basava Purana" in 1330).

During the early 12th-century ascendancy of the Hoysalas, the kings of the dynasty entertained imperial ambitions. King Vishnuvardhana wanted to perform <a href="Veda">Vedic</a> sacrifices befitting an emperor, and surpass his overlords, the Western Chalukyas, in military and architectural achievements. This led to his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism. Around the same time, the well-known philosopher <a href="Ramanujacharya">Ramanujacharya</a> sought refuge from the Cholas in Hoysala territory and popularised the <a href="Sri%20Vaishnava">Sri Vaishnava</a> faith, a sect of Hindu Vaishnavism. Although Jains continued to dominate culturally in what is now the southern Karnataka region for a while, these social changes would later contribute to the decline of Jain literary output. The growing political clout of the Hoysalas attracted many bards and scholars to their court, who in turn wrote panegyrics on their patrons.

Nagachandra, a scholar and the builder of the Mallinatha Jinalaya (a Jain temple in honour of the 19th Jain <a href="tirthankar">tirthankar</a>, Mallinatha, in <a href="Bijapur%2C%20Karnataka">Bijapur, Karnataka</a>), wrote "Mallinathapurana" (1105), an account of the evolution of the soul of the Jain saint. According to some historians, King <a href="Veera%20Ballala%20I">Veera Ballala I</a> was his patron. Later, he wrote his "magnum opus", a Jain version of the Hindu epic <a href="Ramayana">Ramayana</a> called "Ramachandra Charitapurana" (or "Pampa Ramayana"). Written in the traditional "champu" metre and in the "Pauma charia" tradition of Vimalasuri, it is the earliest extant version of the epic in the Kannada language. The work contains 16 sections and deviates significantly from the original epic by <a href="Valmiki">Valmiki</a>. Nagachandra represents King <a href="Ravana">Ravana</a>, the villain of the Hindu epic, as a tragic hero, who in a moment of weakness commits the sin of abducting <a href="Sita">Sita</a> (wife of the Hindu god Rama) but is eventually purified by her devotion to <a href="Rama">Rama</a>. In a further deviation, Rama's loyal brother <a href="Lakshmana">Lakshmana</a> (instead of Rama) kills Ravana in the final battle. Eventually, Rama takes "jaina-diksha" (converts to "<a href="Digambara%20monk">Digambara monk</a>"), becomes an ascetic and attains "<a href="nirvana">nirvana</a>" (enlightenment). Considered a complementary work to the "Pampa Bharatha" of <a href="Adikavi%20Pampa">Adikavi Pampa</a> (941, a Jain version of the epic Mahabharata), the work earned Nagachandra the honorific "Abhinava Pampa" ("new Pampa"). Only in the Kannada language do Jain versions exist of the Hindu epics, the <a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> and Ramayana, in addition to their brahminical version.

Kanti (1108), known for her wit and humour, was one of the earliest female poets of the Kannada language and a contemporary of Nagachandra, with whom she indulged in debates and repartees. Rajaditya, a native of either Puvinabage or Raibhag (the modern <a href="Belgaum%20district">Belgaum district</a>), was in the Hoysala court during the days of King Veera Ballala I and King Vishnuvardhana. He wrote in easy verse on arithmetic and other mathematical topics and is credited with three of the earliest writings on mathematics in the Kannada language: "Vyavaharaganita", "Kshetraganita" and "Lilavati". Udayaditya, a Chola prince, authored a piece on rhetoric called "Udayadityalankara" (1150). It was based on Dandin's Sanskrit "Kavyadarsa".

<a href="Harihara%20%28poet%29">Harihara</a> (or Harisvara, 1160), who came from a family of "karnikas" (accountants) in <a href="Hampi">Hampi</a>, was one of the earliest Veerashaiva writers who was not part of the "Vachana" poetic tradition. He is considered one of the most influential Kannada poets of the Hoysala era. A non-traditionalist, he has been called "poet of poets" and a "poet for the masses". Kannada poetry changed course because of his efforts, and he was an inspiration for generations of poets to follow. Impressed by his early writings, Kereya Padmarasa, the court poet of King <a href="Narasimha%20I">Narasimha I</a>, introduced him to the king, who became Harihara's patron. A master of many metres, he authored the "Girijakalyana" ("Marriage of the mountain born goddess – Parvati") in the <a href="Kalidasa">Kalidasa</a> tradition, employing the "champu" style to tell a 10-part story leading to the marriage of the god <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a> and <a href="Parvati">Parvati</a>. According to an anecdote, Harihara was so against eulogising earthly mortals that he struck his protégé Raghavanka for writing about King Harishchandra in the landmark work "Harishchandra Kavya" (c. 1200). Harihara is credited with developing the native "ragale" metre. The earliest poetic biographer in the Kannada language, he wrote a biography of Basavanna called "Basavarajadevara ragale", which gives interesting details about the protagonist while not always conforming to popular beliefs of the time. Ascribed to him is a group of 100 poems called the "Nambiyanana ragale" (also called "Shivaganada ragale" or "Saranacharitamanasa" – "The holy lake of the lives of the devotees") after the saint Nambiyana. In the "sataka" metre he wrote the "Pampa sataka", and in the "ashtaka" metre, the "Mudige ashtaka" in about 1200.

Famous among Vaishnava writers and the first brahmin writer (of the <a href="Smartha">Smartha</a> sect) of repute, <a href="Rudrabhatta">Rudrabhatta</a> wrote "Jagannatha Vijaya" (1180) in a style considered a transition between ancient and medieval Kannada. Chandramouli, a minister in the court of King Veera Ballala II, was his patron. The writing, in "champu" metre, is about the life of the god <a href="Krishna">Krishna</a>. Leading to the god's fight with Banasura, it is based on an earlier writing, "<a href="Vishnu%20Purana">Vishnupurana</a>".

Nemichandra, court poet of King Veera Ballala II and the Silhara King Lakshmana of <a href="Kholapur">Kholapur</a>, wrote "Lilavati Prabandham" (1170), the earliest available true fiction (and hence a novel) in Kannada, with an erotic bent. Written in the "champu" metre, with the ancient town <a href="Banavasi">Banavasi</a> as the background, it narrates the love story of a Kadamba prince and a princess who eventually marry after facing many obstacles. The story is based on a c. 610 Sanskrit original called "Vasavadatta" by Subhandu. His other work, "Neminathapurana", unfinished on account of his death (and hence called "Ardhanemi" or "incomplete Nemi"), details the life of the 22nd Jain tirthankar <a href="Neminatha">Neminatha</a> while treating the life of the god Krishna from a Jain angle.

<a href="Palkuriki%20Somanatha">Palkuriki Somanatha</a>, a native of modern Karnataka or Andhra Pradesh, is considered one of the foremost multi-lingual Shaiva (or Shiva-following) poets of the 12th and 13th centuries. Historians are divided about the time and place of his birth and death and his original faith. He was adept in the Sanskrit, Telugu and Kannada languages. He was a devotee of Basavanna (the founder of the Veerashaiva movement), and all his writings propagate that faith. It is generally accepted that he was born a brahmin and later adopted the Shaiva faith, although according to the scholar Bandaru Tammayya he was born a "Jangama" (follower of the Shaiva faith). His time of birth has been identified as either the 12th century or late 13th century. In Kannada, his most important writings are "Silasampadane", "Sahasragananama" and "Pancharatna". His well-known poems, written in the "ragale" metre, are "Basava ragale", "Basavadhya ragale" and "Sadguru ragale". He is known to have humbled many Vaishnava poets in debates.

Other well-known personalities from the 12th century included several Jain writers. These include Aggala, who authored "Chandraprabhapurana" (1189), an account of the life of the eighth Jain tirthankar Chandraprabha; Sujanottamsa, who wrote a <a href="panegyric">panegyric</a> on <a href="Gomateshwara">Gomateshwara</a> of Shravanabelagola; and Vritta Vilasa, who authored "Sastra sara" and "Dharmaparikshe" (1160). The latter was Vilasa's version of the Sanskrit original of the same name written by Amitagati c. 1014. In this "champu" writing, the author narrates the story of two <a href="Kshatriya">Kshatriya</a> princess who went to <a href="Benares">Benares</a> and exposed the vices of the gods after discussions with the brahmins there. The author questions the credibility of <a href="Hanuman">Hanuman</a> (the Hindu monkey god) and the <a href="Vanara">Vanara</a>s (monkey-like humanoids in the Hindu epic Ramayana). Although controversial, the work sheds useful information on contemporary religious beliefs. Kereya Padmarasa, a Veerashaiva poet patronised by King Narasimha I, wrote "Dikshabodhe" in the "ragale" metre in 1165. He would later become the protagonist of a biographical work called "Padmarajapurana" written by his descendant Padmanaka in c. 1400. The brahmin poet Deva Kavi authored a romance piece called "Kusumavali" (1200), and brahmin poet Kavi Kama (12th century) authored a treatise called "Sringara-ratnakara" on the "rasa" (flavor) of poetical sentiment. Sumanobana (1170) was a poet-grammarian and the "Katakacharya" ("military teacher") under King Narasimha I. He was also a priest in Devagiri, the Seuna Yadava capital.

Harihara's nephew and protégé, the dramatic poet <a href="Raghavanka">Raghavanka</a> of <a href="Hampi">Hampi</a>, whose style is compared to that of 10th-century poet <a href="Ranna%20%28Kannada%20poet%29">Ranna</a>, was the first to establish the "shatpadi" metre in Kannada literature in the epic "Harishchandra Kavya" (1200). According to L. S. Seshagiri Rao, it is believed that in no other language has the story of King Harishchandra been interpreted in this way. The writing is an original in tradition and inspiration that fully develops the potential of the "shatpadi" metre. The narration has many noteworthy <a href="elegy">elegiac</a> verses such as the mourning of Chandramati over the death of her young son Lohitashva from snake bite. The very writing that made Raghavanka famous was rejected by his guru, Harihara. His other well-known writings, adhering to strict Shaiva principles and written to appease his guru, are the "Siddharama charitra" (or "Siddharama Purana"), a larger than life stylistic eulogy of the compassionate 12th-century Veerashaiva saint, Siddharama of Sonnalige; the "Somanatha charitra", a propagandist work that describes the life of saint Somayya (or Adaiah) of Puligere (modern <a href="Lakshmeshwar">Lakshmeshwar</a>), his humiliation by a Jain girl and his revenge; the "Viresvara charita", a dramatic story of the blind wrath of a Shaiva warrior, Virabhadra; the "Hariharamahatva", an account of the life of Harisvara of Hampi; and "Sarabha charitra". The last two classics are considered lost.

In 1209, the Jain scholar, minister, builder of temples and army commander <a href="Janna">Janna</a> wrote, among other classics, "Yashodhara Charite", a unique set of stories in 310 verses dealing with <a href="sadomasochism">sadomasochism</a>, <a href="transmigration%20of%20the%20soul">transmigration of the soul</a>, passion gone awry and cautionary morals for human conduct. The writing, although inspired by Vadiraja's Sanskrit classic of the same name, is noted for its original interpretation, imagery and style. In one story, the poet tells of the infatuation of a man for his friend's wife. Having killed his friend, the man abducts the wife, who dies of grief. Overcome by repentance, he burns himself on the funeral pyre of the woman. The stories of infatuation reach a peak when Janna writes about the attraction of Amrutamati, the queen, to the ugly <a href="mahout">mahout</a> Ashtavakra, who pleases the queen with kicks and whip lashes. This story has piqued the interest of modern researchers. In honour of this work, Janna received the title "Kavichakravarthi" ("Emperor among poets") from his patron, King Veera Ballala II. His other classic, "Anathanatha Purana" (1230), is an account of the life of the 14th tirthankar Ananthanatha.

<a href="Andayya">Andayya</a>, taking a non-conformist path that was never repeated in Kannada literature, wrote "Madana Vijaya" ("Triumph of cupid", 1217–1235) using only pure Kannada words ("desya") and naturalised Sanskrit words ("tadbhava") and totally avoiding assimilated Sanskrit words ("tatsamas"). This is seen by some as a rebuttal meant to prove that writing Kannada literature without borrowed Sanskrit words was possible. The poem narrates the story of the moon being imprisoned by the god Shiva in his abode in the <a href="Himalaya">Himalaya</a>s. In his anger, <a href="Kamadeva">Kama</a> (Cupid, the god of love, also called Manmata) assailed Shiva with his arrows only to be cursed by Shiva and separated from his beloved. Kama then contrived to rid himself of Shiva's curse. The work also goes by other names such as "Sobagina Suggi" ("Harvest of Beauty"), "Kavane Gella" ("Cupid's Conquest") and "Kabbigara-kava" ("Poets defender"). Kama has an important place in Jain writings even before Andayya. The possibility that this writing was yet another subtle weapon in the intensifying conflict between the dominant Jains and the <a href="Veerashaiva">Veerashaiva</a>s, whose popularity was on the rise, is not lost on historians.

Mallikarjuna, a Jain ascetic, compiled an anthology of poems called "Suktisudharnava" ("Gems from the poets") in 1245 in the court of King <a href="Vira%20Someshwara">Vira Someshwara</a>. Some interesting observations have been made by scholars about this important undertaking. While the anthology itself provides insight into poetic tastes of that period (and hence qualifies as a "history of Kannada literature"), it also performs the function of a "guide for poets", an assertive method of bridging the gap between courtly literary intelligentsia and folk poetry. Being a guide for "professional intellectuals", the work, true to its nature, often includes poems eulogising kings and royalty but completely ignoring poems of the 12th-century vachana canon (Veerashaiva folk literature). However, the selection of poems includes contributions from Harihara, the non-conformist Veerashaiva writer. This suggests a compromise by which the author attempts to include the "rebels".

Other notable writers of the early 13th century were Bhanduvarma, author of "Harivamsabhyudaya" and "Jiva sambhodana" (1200), the latter bearing on morals and renunciation, and written addressing the soul; Balachandra Kavi Kandarpa, the author of the Belgaum fort inscription who claimed to be "master of four languages"; Maghanandycharya, the author of an extinct commentary on the Jain theological work "Sastrasara Samuccaya-tiku" (1209) for which there are references, and the available commentary called "padarthasara" giving a complete explanation of Sanskrit and Prakrit authoritative citations; Hastimalla, who wrote "Purvapurana"; Chandrama, author of "Karkala Gomateshvara charite", and Sisumayana, who introduced a new form of composition called "sangatya" in 1232. He wrote an allegorical poem called "Tripuradahana" ("Burning of the triple fortress") and "Anjanacharita". The latter work was inspired by Ravisena's Sanskrit "Padma charitra". Somaraja, a Veerashaiva scholar, wrote a eulogy of Udbhata, the ruler of Gersoppa, and called it "Sringarasara" (or "Udbhatakavya", 1222). Other Jain writers were Parsva Pandita, author of "Paravanathapurana", and Gunavarma II, the author of the story of the ninth Jain tirthankar Pushpadanta called "Pushpadanta purana" (both were patronised by the Ratta kings of <a href="Saundatti">Saundatti</a>). Polalva Dandanatha, a commander, minister, and the builder of the <a href="Harihareshwara%20temple">Harihareshwara temple</a> in Harihar, wrote "Haricharitra" in 1224. He was patronised by King Veera Ballala II and his successor, King <a href="Vira%20Narasimha%20II">Vira Narasimha II</a>. Puligere Somanatha authored a book on morals called "Somesvarasataka".

<a href="Keshiraja">Keshiraja</a> was a notable writer and grammarian of the 13th century. He came from a family of famous poet-writers. Although five of Keshiraja's writings are not traceable, his most enduring work on Kannada grammar, "<a href="Shabdamanidarpana">Shabdamanidarpana</a>" ("Mirror of Word Jewels", 1260), is available and testifies to his scholarly acumen and literary taste. True to his wish that his writing on grammar should "last as long as the sun, the moon, the oceans and the <a href="Mount%20Meru%20%28mythology%29">Meru</a> mountain lasted", "Shabdamanidarpana" is popular even today and is considered a standard authority on old Kannada grammar. It is prescribed as a textbook for students of graduate and post-graduate studies in the Kannada language. Although Keshiraja followed the model of Sanskrit grammar (of the Katantra school) and that of earlier writings on Kannada grammar (by King <a href="Amoghavarsha%20I">Amoghavarsha I</a> of the 9th century and grammarian <a href="Nagavarma%20II">Nagavarma II</a> of 1145), his work has originality. Keshiraja's lost writings are "Cholapalaka Charitam", "Sri Chitramale", "Shubhadraharana", "Prabodhachandra" and "Kiratam" (or "Kiratarjuniyam").

A major development of this period that would have a profound impact on Kannada literature even into the modern age was the birth of the <a href="Haridasa">Haridasa</a> ("servants of <a href="Hari">Hari</a> or <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>") movement. This devotional movement, although reminiscent in some ways of the Veerashaiva movement of the 12th century (which produced Vachana poetry and taught devotion to the god Shiva), was in contrast intimately devoted to the Hindu god Vishnu as the supreme God. The inspiration behind this movement was the philosophy of <a href="Madhvacharya">Madhvacharya</a> of <a href="Udupi">Udupi</a>. <a href="Naraharitirtha">Naraharitirtha</a> (1281) is considered the first well-known haridasa and composer of <a href="Vaishnava">Vaishnava</a> devotional songs in Kannada. Before his induction into the Madhva order, he had served as a minister in the court of Kalinga (modern Orissa). The Vaishnava poetry however disappeared for about two centuries after Naraharitirtha's death before resurfacing as a popular form of folk literature during the rule of the <a href="Vijayanagara%20Empire">Vijayanagara Empire</a>. Only three of Naraharitirtha's compositions are available today.

Other writers worthy of mention are Mahabala Kavi, the author of "Neminathapurana" (1254), an account of the 22nd Jain tirthankar Neminatha, and Kumudendu, author of a Jain version of the epic Ramayana in "shatpadi" metre called "Kumudendu Ramayana" in 1275. The effort was influenced by "Pampa Ramayana" of Nagachandra. Kumara Padmarasa, son of Kereya Padmarasa, wrote the "Sananda Charitre" in "shatpadi" metre. Ratta Kavi, a Jain noble, wrote a quasi-scientific piece called "Rattasutra" (or "Rattamala") in 1300. The writing bears on natural phenomena such rain, earthquakes, lightning, planets and omens. A commentary on the "Amara Khosa", considered useful to students of the language, called "Amara Khosa Vyakhyana" was written by the Jain writer Nachiraja (1300). Towards the end of the Hoysala rule, Nagaraja wrote "Punyasrava" in 1331 in "champu" style, a work that narrates the stories of <a href="puranic">puranic</a> heroes in 52 tales and is said to be a translation from Sanskrit.

The Vaishnava movement in the Kannada-speaking regions found momentum after the arrival of the philosopher <a href="Ramanujacharya">Ramanujacharya</a> (1017–1137). Fleeing possible persecution from the Chola King (who was a Shaiva), Ramanujacharya sought refuge initially in Tondanur and later moved to <a href="Melkote">Melkote</a>. But this event had no impact on Vaishnava literature in Hoysala lands at that time. However, the teachings of Madhvacharya (1238–1317), propounder of the "Dvaita" philosophy, did have a direct impact on Vaishnava literature, in both the Sanskrit and Kannada languages. This body of writings is known as "haridasa sahitya" (haridasa literature).

Born as Vasudeva in <a href="Pajaka">Pajaka</a> village near Udupi in 1238, he learnt the <a href="Veda">Veda</a>s and <a href="Upanishad">Upanishad</a>s under his guru Achyutapreksha. He was initiated into "<a href="sanyasa">sanyasa</a>" (asceticism) after which he earned the name Madhvacharya (or Anandatirtha). Later, he disagreed with the views of his guru and began to travel India. He successfully debated with many scholars and philosophers during this time and won over Naraharitirtha, a minister in Kalinga, who would later become Madhvacharya's first notable disciple. Unlike <a href="Adi%20Shankaracharya">Adi Shankaracharya</a> (788–820) who preached <a href="Advaita">Advaita</a> philosophy (monism) and Ramanujacharya who propounded <a href="Vishishtadvaita">Vishishtadvaita</a> philosophy (qualified monism), Madhvacharya taught the Dvaita philosophy (dualism).

Madhvacharya taught complete devotion to the Hindu god Vishnu, emphasising "Jnanamarga" or the "path of knowledge", and insisted that the path of devotion "can help a soul to attain elevation" ("Athmonathi"). He was however willing to accept devotion to other Hindu deities as well. He wrote 37 works in Sanskrit including "Dwadasha Sutra" (in which his devotion to the god Vishnu found full expression), "Gita Bhashya", "Gita Tatparya Nirnaya", "Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya", "Bhagavata Tatparya Nirnaya", "Mayavada Khandana" and "Vishnu Tattwa Nirnaya". To propagate his teachings he established eight monasteries near <a href="Udupi">Udupi</a>, the Uttaradhi monastery, and the Raghavendra monastery in <a href="Mantralayam">Mantralayam</a> (in modern <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>) and <a href="Nanjanagud">Nanjanagud</a> (near modern <a href="Mysore">Mysore</a>).

The writings of Madhvacharya and Vidyatirtha (author of "Rudraprshnabhashya") may have been absorbed by Sayanacharya, brother of <a href="Vidyaranya">Vidyaranya</a>, the patron saint of the founders of the Vijayanagara empire in the 14th century. Bharatasvamin (who was patronised by Hoysala King Ramanatha) wrote a commentary on "Samaveda", Shadgurusishya wrote commentary on "Aitareya Brahmana" and "Aranyaka", and Katyayana wrote "Sarvanukramani". A family of hereditary poets whose names have not been identified held the title "Vidyachakravarti" (poet laureate) in the Hoysala court. One of them wrote "Gadyakarnamrita", a description of the war between Hoysala king Vira Narasimha II and the <a href="Pandya">Pandya</a>s, in the early 13th century. His grandson with the same title, in the court of king Veera Ballala III, composed a poem called "Rukminikalyana" in 16 "kandas" (chapters) and wrote commentaries (on poetics) on the "Alankarasarvasva" and "Kavyaprakasa". Kalyani Devi, a sister of Madhvacharya, and Trivikrama, his disciple, wrote commentaries on the Dvaita philosophy. To Trivikrama is ascribed a poem narrating the story of Usha and Aniruddha called "Ushaharana". Narayana Pandita composed "Madhwavijaya", "Manimanjari" and a poem called "Parijataharana". The Jain writer Ramachandra Maladhari authored "Gurupanchasmriti".

Literary developments during the Hoysala period had a marked influence on Kannada literature in the centuries to follow. These developments popularised folk metres which shifted the emphasis towards "desi" (native or folk) forms of literature. With the waning of Jain literary output, competition between the Veerashaiva and Vaishnava writers came to the fore. The Veerashaiva writer <a href="Chamarasa">Chamarasa</a> (author of "Prabhulingalile", 1425) and his Vaishnava competitor <a href="Kumaravyasa">Kumaravyasa</a> ("Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari", 1450) popularised the "shatpadi" metric tradition initiated by Hoysala poet Raghavanka, in the court of Vijayanagara King <a href="Deva%20Raya%20II">Deva Raya II</a>. <a href="Lakshmisa">Lakshmisa</a>, the 16th–17th century writer of epic poems, continued the tradition in the "Jaimini Bharata", a work that has remained popular even in the modern period. The "tripadi" metre, one of the oldest in the Kannada language (<a href="Kappe%20Arabhatta">Kappe Arabhatta</a> inscription of 700), which was used by <a href="Akka%20Mahadevi">Akka Mahadevi</a> ("Yoganna trividhi", 1160), was popularised in the 16th century by the mendicant poet <a href="Sarvajna">Sarvajna</a>. Even Jain writers, who had dominated courtly literature throughout the classical period with their Sanskritic "champu" style, began to use native metres. Among them, <a href="Ratnakaravarni">Ratnakaravarni</a> is famous for successfully integrating an element of worldly pleasure into asceticism and for treating the topic of <a href="eroticism">eroticism</a> with discretion in a religious epic written in the native "sangatya" metre (a metre initiated by Hoysala poet Sisumayana), his "magnum opus", the "Bharatadesa Vaibhava" (c. 1557).

Though the Vaishnava courtly writings in Kannada began with the Hoysala poet Rudrabhatta and the devotional song genre was initiated by Naraharitirtha, the Vaishnava movement began to exert a strong influence on Kannada literature only from the 15th century on. The Vaishnava writers consisted of two groups who seemed to have no interaction with each other: the <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a> commentators who typically wrote under the patronage of royalty, and the <a href="Bhakti">Bhakti</a> (devotion) writers (also known as haridasas) who played no role in courtly matters. The Bhakti writers took the message of God to the people in the form of melodious songs composed using folk genres such as the "kirthane" (a musical composition with refrain, based on tune and rhythm), the "suladi" (a composition based on rhythm) and the "ugabhoga" (a composition based on melody). <a href="Kumara%20Vyasa">Kumara Vyasa</a> and Timmanna Kavi were well-known among the Brahmin commentators, while <a href="Purandara%20Dasa">Purandara Dasa</a> and <a href="Kanaka%20Dasa">Kanaka Dasa</a> were the most notable of the Bhakti writers. The philosophy of <a href="Madhvacharya">Madhvacharya</a>, which originated in the Kannada-speaking region in the 13th century, spread beyond its borders over the next two centuries. The itinerant haridasas, best described as mystic saint-poets, spread the philosophy of Madhvacharya in simple Kannada, winning mass appeal by preaching devotion to God and extolling the virtues of "jnana" (enlightenment), "bhakti" (devotion) and "vairagya" (detachment).

Vachana poetry, developed in reaction to the rigid caste-based Hindu society, attained its peak in popularity among the under-privileged during the 12th century. Though these poems did not employ any regular metre or rhyme scheme, they are known to have originated from the earlier "tripadi" metrical form. The Veerashaivas, who wrote this poetry, had risen to influential positions by the Vijayanagara period (14th century). Court ministers and nobility belonging to the faith, such as Lakkanna Dandesa and Jakkanarya, not only wrote literature but also patronised talented writers and poets. Veerashaiva anthologists of the 15th and 16th centuries began to collect Shaiva writings and vachana poems, originally written on palm leaf manuscripts. Because of the cryptic nature of the poems, the anthologists added commentaries to them, thereby providing their hidden meaning and esoteric significance. An interesting aspect of this anthological work was the translation of the Shaiva canon into Sanskrit, bringing it into the sphere of the Sanskritic ("marga" or mainstream as opposed to "desi" or folk) cultural order.

Western Chalukya literature in Kannada

A large body of Western Chalukya literature in the <a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada language</a> was produced during the reign of the <a href="Western%20Chalukya%20Empire">Western Chalukya Empire</a> (973–1200 CE) in what is now <a href="South%20India">southern India</a>. This dynasty, which ruled most of the <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">western Deccan</a> in South India is sometimes called the Kalyani Chalukya Dynasty after its royal capital at Kalyani (now <a href="Basavakalyan">Basavakalyan</a>) and sometimes called the Later Chalukya Dynasty for its theoretical relationship to the 6th-century <a href="Chalukya%20dynasty">Chalukya dynasty</a> of <a href="Badami">Badami</a>. For a brief period (1162–1183), the <a href="Kalachuris%20of%20Kalyani">Kalachuris of Kalyani</a>, a dynasty of kings who had earlier migrated to the <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> region from central India and served as <a href="vassal">vassal</a>s for several generations, exploited the growing weakness of their overlords and annexed the Kalyani. Around 1183, the last Chalukya scion, <a href="Someshvara%20IV">Someshvara IV</a>, overthrew the Kalachuris to regain control of the royal city. But his efforts were in vain, as other prominent Chalukya vassals in the Deccan, the <a href="Hoysalas">Hoysalas</a>, the <a href="Kakatiya%20dynasty">Kakatiyas</a> and the <a href="Seuna%20Yadavas%20of%20Devagiri">Seunas</a> destroyed the remnants of the Chalukya power.

<a href="Kannada%20literature">Kannada literature</a> from this period is usually categorised into the linguistic phase called Old-Kannada. It constituted the bulk of the Chalukya court's textual production and pertained mostly to writings relating to the socio-religious development of the <a href="Jain">Jain</a> faith. The earliest well-known writers belonging to the <a href="Shaiva">Shaiva</a> faith are also from this period. Under the patronage of Kalachuri <a href="Bijjala%20II">King Bijjala II</a>, whose prime minister was the well-known Kannada poet and <a href="reform%20movement">social reformer</a> <a href="Basavanna">Basavanna</a>, a native form of poetic literature called "<a href="Vachana">Vachana</a>" literature ("lit" "utterance", "saying" or "sentence") proliferated. The beginnings of the "Vachana" poetic tradition in the Kannada-speaking region trace back to the early 11th century. Kannada literature written in the "<a href="champu">champu</a>" <a href="Meter%20%28poetry%29">metre</a>, composed of prose and verse, was popularised by the Chalukyan court poets. However, with the advent of the <a href="Veerashaiva">Veerashaiva</a> ("lit", "brave devotees of the god Shiva") religious movement in the mid-12th century, poets favoured the native "<a href="tripadi">tripadi</a>" (three-line verse composed of eleven "ganas" or prosodic units), "hadugabba" (song-poem) and <a href="free%20verse">free verse</a> metres for their poems.

Important literary contributions in Kannada were made not only by court poets, noblemen, royalty, ascetics and saints who wrote in the "marga" (mainstream) style, but also by commoners and artisans, including cobblers, weavers, cowherds and shepherds who wrote in the "desi" (folk) style. These "Vachana" poets (called "Vachanakaras") revolutionised Kannada literature, rejecting traditional themes that eulogised kings and noblemen, and writing didactic poems that were closer to the spoken and sung form of the language. In addition to hundreds of male poets, over thirty female poets have been recorded, some of whom wrote along with their husbands.

Towards the end of the 10th century, a new <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> dynasty, called the Western Chalukyas, had come to power by overthrowing the <a href="Rashtrakuta%20Empire">Rashtrakuta Empire</a> of <a href="Manyakheta">Manyakheta</a> (modern Malkhed in the <a href="Gulbarga%20district">Gulbarga district</a>, <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>). Their earliest inscription is dated to c. 957 and is ascribed to a subordinate ruler, <a href="Tailapa%20II">Tailapa II</a> of Tardavadi, later to become the founding king of the empire, in the <a href="Bijapur%20district%2C%20Chhattisgarh">Bijapur district</a>, Karnataka. An inscription from c. 967 suggests that an unsuccessful rebellion was staged by Chattideva, a local king belonging to the Chalukya family, with the help of the Kadamba chief from the temple town <a href="Banavasi">Banavasi</a>. These events, however, paved the way for Tailapa II to launch a successful rebellion against the Rashtrakuta <a href="Karka%20II">King Karka II</a> with the help of the Kadamba chief of <a href="Hangal">Hangal</a>.

A century before these political developments, the age of great Sanskrit and <a href="Prakrit">Prakrit</a> epics and classics had come to an end. This productive period had made available a vast corpus of literature that could be expressed in the local language of Kannada. Kannada, which had flourished both as a language of political discourse and literature in the <a href="Rashtrakuta%20literature">Rashtrakuta court</a>, found enthusiastic support from the Chalukya kings. The influential Jains, who according to historian A.S. Altekar may have comprised 30 percent of the population, not only dominated the cultural landscape of 9th and 10th century Karnataka, but were also eager to encourage literature in the local language. According to Professor S.N. Sen, a research fellow at the Indian council of historical research, Kannada literature under the Chalukyas reached a "perfection of form". Scholars <a href="Sheldon%20Pollock">Sheldon Pollock</a> and Jan Houben have claimed that 90 percent of the Chalukyan royal inscriptions are in Kannada, a virtual displacement of Sanskrit as the language of courtly discourse.

For a few centuries after "<a href="Kavirajamarga">Kavirajamarga</a>" ("Royal path for poets", c. 850), the earliest available Kannada literary work, Jain writings had adhered to Sanskritic models that had been recognised by the state as the path for future Kannada writers, while relegating native poetic forms (compositions such as "Chattana" and "Bedande") to subordinate status. The stranglehold that the Sanskritic models had over Kannada literature is best exemplified by Ranna's lexicon "Rannakanda" (990), where native day-to-day Kannada words had been translated into Sanskrit. This implied that the pure form of the local language was not viewed as equal to Sanskrit, from the cosmopolitan viewpoint. Kannada writings by Jain authors thus used impressive Sanskrit-derived verses interspersed with prose to extol the virtues of their patron kings, who were often compared to heroes from the Hindu epics. While <a href="Adikavi%20Pampa">Adikavi Pampa</a> ("Pampa Bharata", 941) compared his patron, the feudatory <a href="Chalukyas%20of%20Vemulavada">Chalukya</a> King Arikesari, to <a href="Pandava">Pandava</a> prince <a href="Arjuna">Arjuna</a>, in "<a href="Vikramarjuna%20Vijaya">Vikramarjuna Vijaya</a>", his version of the Hindu epic <a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>, <a href="Ranna%20%28Kannada%20poet%29">Ranna</a> (983) found it suitable to compare his patron, <a href="Satyashraya">King Satyashraya</a>, to Pandava prince <a href="Bhima">Bhima</a>.

The mainstream literary style was to lose popularity during the mid-12th century Kalachuri rule, due to the rise of revolutionary notions about the social and cultural order. The Veerashaivas, acting in protest, used the pure form of Kannada language in their poems; moreover, they encouraged writers from lower castes to participate and completely eliminated themes that had been considered formal by the king and the monastery. Thus, written in native metres, in a language close to the spoken form of Kannada, the "Vachana" poems gained mass appeal. A new religious faith was thereby propagated by the Veerashaivas whose ascendancy is called the "Veerashaiva movement" and their communicative genre, the "Vachana". While the "Vachana" poetry is generally categorised as a part of the pan-Indian "<a href="Bhakti">Bhakti</a>" (devotional) literature, such generalisations tend to disguise the very esoteric and anti-"bhakti" positions taken by many "Vachanakaras". The origin of the Veerashaiva ideology and the beginnings of their poetry is unclear. According to D.R. Nagaraj, a scholar on literary cultures in history, modern scholars tend to favour two broad views: integrationist and indigenist. The integrationists, such as L. Basavaraju, trace the source of "Vachana" poetic tradition to the Sanskrit <a href="Upanishad">Upanishad</a> scriptures and the <a href="%C4%80gama%20%28Hinduism%29">Agama</a> doctrine, though this does not explain why the movement did not blossom earlier or in the neighbouring <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a>-speaking region where radical Shaiva sects were known to be active. The indigenists, such as Chidananda Murthy, M.M. Kalaburgi and <a href="G.S.%20Shivarudrappa">G.S. Shivarudrappa</a>, propose a native Karnataka origin of the poetry, though they are yet to fully explain its unique nature. 

At about this time, adding to pressure from the popularity of the "Vachana" canon in the northern Kannada-speaking region, the noted Hoysala king <a href="Vishnuvardhana">Vishnuvardhana</a> (1108–1152) of the southern Kannada-speaking region converted from Jainism to the Hindu sect of <a href="Vaishnavism">Vaishnavism</a>. The popularity of <a href="Ramanujacharya">Ramanujacharya</a>'s philosophy had spread in the Hoysala lands and <a href="Srivaishnavism">Srivaishnavism</a>, a sub-sect of Vaishnavism, was in the ascendant. By the late 13th century, the Veerashaiva writers, who were by now writing allegorical inscriptions and biographies of famous "Vachanakaras" of the 12th century, were in stiff competition with the Jains. The earliest attempts by the Jains to veer away from traditional "<a href="purana">puranic</a>" (philosophical) themes of renunciation are seen in the writings of Hoysala writers Nemichandra and <a href="Andayya">Andayya</a>. "Lilavati Prabhandam", a novel written by Nemichandra (1170) on the topic of love, erotica, and of the victory of <a href="Kamadeva">Kamadeva</a> (god of love) over his arch-rival Shiva, is the first among such writings. It was followed by "Kabbigara Kava" ("Poets defender", 1215–1237) by Andayya, also a work depicting a war between Kamadeva and the god Shiva. Despite these efforts, the Jain literary influence was to recede in the coming decades and centuries, being relegated mostly to the coastal Kannada-speaking region. Works of enduring quality were still produced by maverick authors such as <a href="Ratnakaravarni">Ratnakaravarni</a> (1557), though their numbers were fewer.

Contemporaneous to these developments, <a href="Nagavarma%20II">Nagavarma II</a> wrote his Kannada grammar "Karnataka bhashabhushana" ("Ornament of Karnataka language", 1042 or 1145). A milestone in the history of Kannada literature, it helped consolidate the language as competitor to established languages such as <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> and <a href="Prakrit">Prakrit</a>, bringing the local language within the realm of literary cosmopolitanism. Writing a Kannada grammar in Sanskrit language was essential to Nagavarma II, a subtle rebuttal to Sanskritic scholars of the day who may have considered Kannada a language of the common man and its grammar as underdeveloped. In addition to the Chalukya patronage, Kannada poets and writers of this period were popular in the courts of neighbouring kingdoms of the western <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan</a>. The Hoysalas, the southern Kalachuris, the Seunas, the <a href="Western%20Ganga%20Dynasty">Gangas</a> and the <a href="Shilaharas%20of%20Southern%20Maharashtra">Silharas</a> are some of the ruling families who enthusiastically used Kannada in inscriptions and promoted its literature.

The late 10th century was a period of consolidation for the fledgling empire. Founding <a href="Tailapa%20II">King Tailapa II</a> and his successor, King Satyashraya, warred against their neighbours: the Shilharas of south <a href="Konkan">Konkan</a>, the Chaulukyas of <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>, the <a href="Paramara">Paramara</a> of central India and the <a href="Chola%20Dynasty">Chola Dynasty</a> of <a href="Tanjore">Tanjore</a>. Unaffected by these political developments, Kannada literature continued to flourish in the royal court. The foremost writer of this period was Ranna, who was born to a family of bangle sellers in the town of <a href="Mudhol">Mudhol</a>. Ranna is considered by historians K.A. Nilakanta Sastri and Sailendra Nath Sen as one of the "three gems of Kannada literature" along with his seniors, <a href="Adikavi%20Pampa">Adikavi Pampa</a> and <a href="Sri%20Ponna">Sri Ponna</a>. Ranna became the court poet of King Tailapa II and King Satyashraya. In his early days, he was also patronised by the well-known <a href="Western%20Ganga%20Dynasty">Ganga</a> minister <a href="Chavundaraya">Chavundaraya</a>. Ranna is famous for writing "<a href="Ajitha%20purana">Ajitha purana</a>" (993), which recounts the life of the second Jain <a href="tirthankar">tirthankar</a> Ajitanatha. However, it is in his "magnum opus", the work "Sahasa Bhima Vijaya" ("Victory of bold Bhima", also called "Gada Yudda" or "Conflict of Clubs'", 982) that he reaches his zenith of poetic grace while describing the conflict between <a href="Pandava">Pandava</a> <a href="Bhima">Bhima</a> and Kaurava prince <a href="Duryodhana">Duryodhana</a> in his Jain version of the Hindu epic <a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>.

Unlike Pampa who glorifies <a href="Arjuna">Arjuna</a> and <a href="Karna">Karna</a> in his writing, Ranna eulogises his patron King Satyashraya and favourably compares him to Bhima, whom he crowns at the end of the Mahabharata war. He calls Bhima's adversary Duryodhana "mahanubhava" ("a great person"). The work contains some of the earliest examples of <a href="elegy">elegiac</a> verses (called "shoka gita" or "charama gita") in the Kannada language, noted among which is one piece that describes the heart-rending lamentation (called "karuna rasa" or "sentiment of pathos") of Duryodhana on seeing the slain bodies of his brother Duhshasana, his inseparable friend in joy and sorrow, Karna, and Arjuna's valorous son <a href="Abhimanyu">Abhimanyu</a>. The effect given to the writing, the language, the diction and the style maintained throughout the narration has earned Ranna a place among the most notable authors of Kannada literature. Ascribed also to Ranna is the earliest available dictionary in Kannada language called the "Rannakanda" (990), of which only eleven verses still exist. His other notable writings were the "Chakeresvaracharita" and the "Parashuramacharitha". According to historian Suryanath Kamath, the latter work, which is now lost, may have been a eulogy of Chavundaraya, whom the poet admired. For his literary contributions, the title "Kavi Chakravathi" ("Emperor among poets") was bestowed upon Ranna by his patron king.

Another notable writer from the close of the 10th century, Nemichandra, wrote the "Kaviraja kunjara" and "Lilavati" (c. 990) with Prince Kavdarpa Deva of Jayantipura (modern <a href="Banavasi">Banavasi</a>, Karnataka) and Princess Lilavati as the protagonists of the latter poem. Other writers from the close of the 10th century whose works are now lost but have been praised by the Chalukya minister Durgasimha (1031) are Kavitavilasa (patronised by King Jayasimha II), Madiraja, Chadrabhatta, Kannamayya and Manasija. Inscriptions such as the Kuppatur and Haveri records eulogize popular writers such as Harivarma (1070) and Narayana Deva respectively.

According to Kannada scholar R. Narasimhacharya, despite the production of some important secular writings, repeated <a href="Chola">Chola</a> invasions into Kannada lands in the 11th century may have adversely affected literary production. This situation was brought about by intense competition between the Western Chalukyas and their arch-rivals, the <a href="Cholas">Cholas</a> of <a href="Tanjore">Tanjore</a>. Among notable writings, Chandraraja's "Madanatilaka" ("Forehead ornament of passion", 1025), written in the "champu" metre, is the earliest available work on erotica in the Kannada language and an adaptation of the Sanskrit "<a href="Kamasutra">Kamasutra</a>" by <a href="Vatsyayana">Vatsyayana</a>. The narration is a dialogue between the patron and his wife in "posakannada", the most modern Kannada in usage at the time. He was under the patronage of Machiraja, feudatory of King Jayasimha II (also called Jagadekamalla I). Shridharacharya, a Jain <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a> patronised by King <a href="Someshvara%20I">Someshvara I</a> (also called Ahvamalla or Trailokyamalla) showed his ability to write on scientific subjects in "Jatakatilaka" (1049), the earliest available writing on <a href="astrology">astrology</a> in Kannada, citing the Sanskrit <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a> <a href="Aryabhata">Aryabhata</a>. His other work is the lost "Chandraprabha Charite", on <a href="belles-lettres">belles-lettres</a>.

Chavundaraya II, a <a href="Shaiva">Shaiva</a> Brahmin (Brahmin devotee of the god Shiva) by faith and a protege of King Jayasimha II, wrote "Lokopakara" (c. 1025) in the "champu" metre. It is the earliest available <a href="encyclopaedia">encyclopaedia</a> in the Kannada language, written at times with a poetic touch. It comprises twelve chapters and has found popularity in later references as well. The work is on various topics such as daily life, astronomy, astrology and forecasting of events based on the Indian calendar ("panchanga phala"), sculpture, construction of buildings ("vastu vichara") and reservoirs ("udakargala"), omens, divination of water, preparation of medicine from herbs and plants ("vrikshayurveda"), general medicine ("vaidya"), perfumery, cookery and toxicology ("vishavaidya"). Mentioned in this book is the popular South Indian dish <a href="Idli">Idli</a> and its preparation by soaking <a href="Urad%20dal">Urad dal</a> (black gram) in butter milk, grinding it to a fine paste, and mixing with spices and the clear water of <a href="curd">curd</a>.

<a href="Durgasimha">Durgasimha</a>, the "Sandhi Vigrahi" (minister of war and peace) of King Jayasimha II wrote the well-known "<a href="Panchatantra">Panchatantra</a>" ("The five stratagems", 1031) in "champu" style, basing it on Gunadhya's Paishachi language original "Brihatkatha". This <a href="fable">fable</a> is the first adaptation of the original into a vernacular language of India. Containing sixty fables in all, thirteen of which are original, each is summarised by an ethical moral based on a Jain tenet. Durgasimha also authored the "Karnataka Banachatantra", the earliest available commentary in the Kannada language, giving a brief commentary on all the Sanskrit verses he quoted in the "Panchatantra". Around this time, Jayakirti (c. 1000–1050), a Kannada language theorist, who considered the rules of <a href="Prosody%20%28poetry%29">prosody</a> to be the same for Sanskrit and Kannada, wrote the "Chandonusasana" 

There were other notable writers from the latter part of the 11th century. Shantinatha, patronised by King Someshvara II, wrote the poem "Sukumaracharita" in c. 1068. Nagavarmacharya, a <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a> <a href="Advaita">Advaita</a> saint of <a href="Balligavi">Balligavi</a>, who was patronised by King Udayatidya, a vassal of Chalukya King Someshvara II, wrote "Chandrachudamani sataka" (c. 1070) in the "sataka" (hundred-line verse) metre. In this centum of verses, where each ends with the term "Chandrachudamani" as another name of the god Shiva, the author treats on "viragya" (ethics of renunciation). Other writers whose works are considered lost but have been referenced in contemporary writings are Gunachandra and Gunavarma. Gunachandra, who was admired by King Someshvara II (also called Bhuvanaika Malla), wrote "Parsvabhyudaya" and "Maghanadisvara". Gunavarma, who earned the honorific "Bhuvanaika Vira", a title befitting a warrior rather than a poet, is mentioned by grammarian <a href="Keshiraja">Keshiraja</a> (c. 1260) as the author of "Harivamsa". His title identifies him with a Ganga prince called Udayaditya who was a minister and general under Chalukya King Someshvara II. Other writings ascribed to the author are "Pushpadanta Purana" and "Devachandra Prabha Stotra".

The 12th century heralded an age of peace and prosperity. Cultural and literary developments received impetus during the rule of <a href="Vikramaditya%20VI">King Vikramaditya VI</a>, a patron of the fine arts. The king, who ascended the throne in 1076 and ruled for fifty years occupies a pride of place in the <a href="Political%20history%20of%20medieval%20Karnataka">history of Karnataka</a>. His reign marks the end of the use of "Saka Varsha" (Indian calendar, the "<a href="Saka%20era">Saka era</a>") in Chalukya inscriptions and the start of "Vikrama Varsha" ("Vikrama era"). His court was adorned with some of the most well-known writers of Kannada and Sanskrit literature. Nayasena, whose writings are dated by the scholars D.R. Nagaraj and Sheldon Pollock to the 10th century, and by E.P. Rice and R. Narasimhacharya to c. 1112, wrote the "Dharmamritha", a book containing fifteen stories that belong to the genre of fable and <a href="parable">parable</a>. Well known among these stories teaching about Jain tenets are "Yajnadatta and the mongoose", "Kapalika and the young elephant" and "Serpent, tiger, monkey and the goldsmith who had fallen in the old well". The writing is one of intense self-interrogation where the author criticises the beliefs of all contemporaneous religions while decrying the contamination in the original Jain beliefs due to external cultural influences, such as the practice of violent and bloody rituals and the caste system.

Brahmashiva, the court poet of King Vikramaditya VI, earned the title "Kavichakravarti" ("Emperor among poets") from his patron for his writing "Samayaparikshe" ("Analysis of the doctrine", c. 1125). In this philosophical writing, containing touches of propagandist satire and humor, the author seeks to prove the virtues of Jainism superior to all other contemporary religions. Brahmashiva portrays contemporary life and beliefs of the people of the Kannada-speaking region. He criticises <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and the conversion of a Jain temple originally dedicated to the <a href="Tirthankar">Tirthankar</a> Chandrapraba in <a href="Kholapur">Kholapur</a> into a Hindu temple deifying the goddess <a href="Lakshmi">Mahalakshmi</a>. He expresses reservation regarding the existence of religious cosmopolitanism within a household where family members followed multiple faiths. The author is concerned about the eroding popularity of Jainism in southern India due to the rising popularity of the Veerashaiva movement. Prince Kirtivarma, a younger brother of King Vikramaditya VI, wrote "Govaidya" ("Cattle Medicine"), the earliest available writing in Kannada on <a href="veterinary%20science">veterinary science</a>, which mixes medicine and magic.

After the death of Vikramaditya VI, his successors, Someshvara III and Jagadhekamalla II continued to support poets and writers. Karnaparya's account of the life of the 22nd tirthankar <a href="Neminatha">Neminatha</a>, the "Neminathapurana" (c. 1145) in "champu" metre, includes details of the Hindu epic Mahabharata and of the god Krishna from a Jain outlook. Jagaddala Somanatha's "Karnataka Kalyanakaraka" (1150), a translation of the Sanskrit writing "Kalyanakaraka" by Pujyapada, is the earliest writing on medicine in Kannada. It prescribes an entirely vegetarian and non-alcoholic diet.

Among available works on Kannada grammar, a part of "Kavirajamarga" (850) forms the earliest framework. The occurrence of the term "purvacharyar" in some contexts of the writing may be a reference to previous grammarians or rhetoricians. Though <a href="Nagavarma%20II">Nagavarma-II</a> is credited to be the author of the earliest exhaustive Kannada grammar, the author mentions his predecessors, Sankavarma and <a href="Nagavarma%20I">Nagavarma-I</a> (the extant "Chhandombudhi", "Ocean of Prosody", c. 984) as path-makers of Kannada grammar. The exact time when grammarian Nagavarma-II lived is debated by historians. Until the discovery of "Vardhamana Puranam" ("Life of Varadhama", c. 1042) written in Kannada by an author who goes by the same name, it was broadly accepted by scholars including E.P. Rice, R. Narasimhacharya and K.A. Nilakanta Sastri that Nagavarma II lived in the mid-12th century (1145) and was also the "Katakacharya" ("poet laureate") of Chalukya King <a href="Jagadhekamalla%20II">Jagadhekamalla II</a>. However, of late, the Encyclopaedia of Indian literature, published by the <a href="Sahitya%20Akademi">Sahitya Akademi</a> (1988), and scholars D.R. Nagaraj and Sheldon Pollock concur that Nagavarma II lived in the mid-11th century and was the poet laureate of Chalukya King Jayasimha II, who had the epithet "Jagadekamalla" ("Lord of the world").

Irrespective of when Nagavarma II lived, it is accepted that few scholars in the history of Kannada literature made important contributions in as many subjects as he did. His writings on grammar, poetry, <a href="Prosody%20%28poetry%29">prosody</a>, and vocabulary are standard authorities and their importance to the study of the Kannada language is well-acknowledged. Among his available writings, the historically important "Kavyavalokana" ("Treatise on the art of poetry") on grammar, poetics and rhetoric is considered path-breaking and contains all the essentials of Kannada grammar. The first section of the book is called "Sabdasmriti" and contains five chapters dealing with euphonic combinations, nouns, compounds, nominal derivatives and verbs respectively. It is based on earlier works by the Sanskrit grammarians Dandin and Bhamaha. The "Karnataka Bhashabhushana", a consolidated and exhaustive Kannada grammar written by Nagavarma II in the Sanskrit language, follows the fundamental framework of the Katantra school of Sanskrit grammar. For his contribution to Kannada grammar, Nagavarma II earned the honorific "Sarvavarma" – the name of the noted Sanskrit grammarian of the <a href="Satavahana">Satavahana</a> era. His "Abhidana Vastukosa" ("Treasury of significations"), a lexicon, gives Kannada equivalents of nearly eight thousand Sanskrit words and is considered an achievement which gave Kannada language considerable footing in the world of Sanskrit literary dominance. Modern Kannada poet <a href="Govinda%20Pai">Govinda Pai</a> proposed that the author of "Karnataka Bhashabhushana" was a different Nagavarma who belonged to the mid-12th century.

The meteoric rise of <a href="Veerashaivism">Veerashaivism</a> (a religious sect which preaches devotion to the god Shiva, also called "Lingayatism") in caste-ridden 12th-century Karnataka has historic significance because it involved commoners from the lower strata of society, people who had hitherto been denied access to even basic education. The essence of the movement, also seen in the resulting "Vachana" poems, was the rejection of temple-based ritual worship and the hegemony of mainstream Sanskritic texts and scriptures. The movement encouraged a monotheistic belief in the god Shiva which, according to Kannada scholar <a href="H.S.%20Shivaprakash">H.S. Shiva Prakash</a>, is a possible influence of the 63 <a href="Nayanmar">Nayanmar</a>s (poets devoted to the god Shiva, 5th–10th century) of the Tamil-speaking region. The followers of the faith prayed not to a conventional image of a God but rather wore a "<a href="linga">linga</a>" (symbol of the god Shiva) on their body. The beginnings of the "Vachana" poetry (called "Vachana Sahitya" – "Vachana literature", or "Anubhava Sahitya" – "mystic literature" and sometimes "Sharana Sahitya" – "literature of the devotees"), a unique form of expression in the Kannada language, can however be traced back to the 11th century.

Names of three poets from the 11th century and some of their poems are available. Madara Chennaiah, a cobbler turned saint, is considered by H.S. Shiva Prakash as the first "Vachana poet", and was held in high esteem by latter day poets of the 12th century, including Basavanna. Only ten of Chennaiah's poems, expressing his resentment of the <a href="caste%20system">caste system</a> in metaphors taken from the cobblers' trade, are <a href="extant%20literature">extant</a> today. Dohara Kakkaiah is the second poet. A <a href="dalit">dalit</a> by birth, his six available poems are confessional in nature, a theme seen in the later poems of Basavanna. Devara Dasimaiah (or Jedara Dasimaiah, 1040) is better known because a hundred and fifty of his poems are available. Written in a deft and concise language of proverbs and metaphors, his poems encourage monotheistic belief in the god Shiva. Dasimaiah's wife Duggale qualifies as Kannada's first women poet, though only a few of her poems are available.

In the mid-12th century, the <a href="Kalachuri">Kalachuri</a>s successfully warred against their overlords, the Western Chalukyas, and annexed their capital <a href="Basavakalyan">Kalyani</a>. During this turbulent period lasting three decades (1153–1183), Veerashaivism gained popularity. According to H.S. Shiva Prakash, the Kalachuri period is one of the high points of medieval Kannada literature. Basavanna (or Basava), a social reformer and the prime minister of Kalachuri King <a href="Bijjala%20II">Bijjala II</a>, is generally regarded as the inspiration behind this movement. <a href="Allama%20Prabhu">Allama Prabhu</a>, <a href="Channabasavanna">Chennabasava</a>, Siddharama, <a href="Akka%20Mahadevi">Akka Mahadevi</a>, and Kondugoli Keshiraja are other well-known poets among several hundred in this cadre.

A centre of religious discussions called "Anubhava Mantapa" ("Hall of experience") in Kalyani became the conclave where devotees gathered to discuss their mystic experiences. Here, they expressed their devotion to Shiva in simple poems called "Vachanas". These were spontaneous utterances of rhythmic, epigrammatical and <a href="satire">satirical</a> prose emphasising the worthlessness of riches, rituals and book learning. Many of these poems are anonymous, but the authors are identifiable by the unique divine name of the god Shiva that is invoked in the poem.


Born to Brahmin parents in the town of <a href="Basavana%20Bagewadi">Basavana Bagewadi</a>, Basavanna (1106–1167) rejected the "<a href="upanayanam">upanayanam</a>" ("ritual thread ceremony") and left home for <a href="Kudalasangama">Kudalasangama</a>, a holy place at the confluence of the <a href="Krishna%20River">Krishna</a> and <a href="Ghataprabha">Ghataprabha</a> rivers in Bagalkot district, Karnataka. According to historian P.B. Desai, it was here, during his tutelage under the saint Ishanyaguru, that Basavanna had visions of his life's purpose. The life of Basavanna marks a milestone in the history of Karnataka state, India. A towering personality, his zeal and socio-cultural achievements in the realm of peace and equality of mankind have brought about enduring changes in society.

Information about his life and achievements come from the many Kannada writings, the earliest of which were written just after his death. Hoysala poet <a href="Harihara">Harihara</a>'s "Basavarajadevara ragale" is the first known biography on Basavanna. Vijayanagara poet-writer Bhima Kavi's "Basavapurana" (1369), Singiraja's "Amala Basavacharite" (1500), Vijayanagara minister Lakkanna Dandesa's "Shiva Tatwachintamani" (1425–1450) are some of the important sources. The cornerstone of Basavanna's philosophy was "work-worship is heaven", the rejection of mere worship of God and the acceptance of one's own body as a temple of God. Basavanna strongly advocated a life of complete commitment to work. As a poet, he finds a pride of place in Kannada literature. His deftly written poems end with the word "Kudalasangama" which literally means "God of the confluence of two rivers", the poet's version of the god Shiva. About 1,300 such poems have survived, and have been described by H.S. Shiva Prakash as lyrical, satirical, deeply contemplative and self-critical.

In one satirical poem, Basavanna decries the hypocrisy of a snake charmer and his wife, who on their way to find a bride for their son cancel the journey when they come across a bad omen – another snake charmer and his wife. Though Basavanna himself was a minister under the patronage of the king, some of his poems betray his contempt towards kingship and deep devotion to the god Shiva.
A poem by Basavanna: 

Allama, also known as Allama Prabhu ("lit", "Allama the master") was a mendicant saint-poet who took to the path of asceticism after the untimely death of his wife Kamalate. He was born into a family of hereditary temple performers and was himself an expert on the drum (called "maddale") in <a href="Balligavi">Balligavi</a>, a town of great antiquity in the <a href="Shivamogga%20district">Shivamogga district</a>, Karnataka. Wandering around grief-stricken by his wife's death, he came across a saint called Animisayya who initiated him into asceticism.

Ascribed to Allama are 1,321 extant poems, each of which end with the word "Guhesvara" ("lit", "Lord of the Cave", a form of the god Shiva), for it is said Allama found enlightenment in a cave. Allama's cryptic poems, though full of kindness, are known for their satire, mockery, invective and rejection of "siddhis" (occult powers). H.S. Shiva Prakash compares Allama's poems to the "<a href="K%C5%8Dan">Koans</a>" in Japanese Zen poetry. According to D.R. Nagaraj, Allama's mystic poems are in a category all of their own and do not qualify as "bhakti" poems, which are typically characterised by transparent devotion.

While Basavanna's zeal and influence led to the formation and popularity of the Veerashaiva movement in Kalyani, it was Allama who was the undisputed spiritual authority presiding over the gatherings of the devotees. Chamarasa, a well-known 15th-century Kannada writer in the court of <a href="Vijayanagara">Vijayanagara</a> <a href="Deva%20Raya%20II">King Deva Raya II</a> wrote "Prabhulinga Lile" (1430), an account of the preachings and achievements of Allama; it was translated into the Telugu and <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil language</a>s at the behest of his patron king, and later into the Sanskrit and <a href="Marathi%20language">Marathi language</a>s. In the story, Allama is considered an incarnation of the Hindu god <a href="Ganapathi">Ganapathi</a> while Ganapathi's mother, <a href="Parvati">Parvati</a> (Shiva's consort), takes the form of a princess of Banavasi. A notable anthology called the "Sunyasampadane" ("The achievement of nothingness", 1400) was compiled on the life of Allama and gives details about his interaction with contemporary saints. A poem by Allama Prabhu:

Prominent among the more than thirty women poets was <a href="Akka%20Mahadevi">Akka Mahadevi</a>. Born to a merchant family in the town Udatadi (or Udugani) in the <a href="Shivamogga%20district">Shivamogga district</a>, and possibly married against her wishes to a feudal chief called Kausika, she renounced worldly pleasures, opting for a life of devotion and asceticism. She is often compared to other such notable female saint-poets of Hinduism as <a href="Andal">Andal</a>, Lalleswari and <a href="Meera%20Bai">Meera Bai</a>, and is considered one of the prominent female poets of the Kannada language.

The 430 short poems written by her, in a language that depicts her love for her divine lover "Channa Mallikarjuna" ("lit", "Beautiful Mallikarjuna", a name for the god Shiva), and the 15th-century anthology, the "Sunyasampadane", are the main sources of information about her life. Her poetry is characterised by scorn for physical possessions and detachment from worldly affairs. A popular poem written by her describes the life of a silk worm which spins a cocoon, becomes entangled in the threads, and eventually dies because it cannot extricate itself – the silk worm is compared to a person and the silk threads, to worldly desires. In a poem of puns, the poet prays that her god, whom she describes as the "Lord of fragrant Jasmines", may cut through the cocoon of desires so she may become free like a butterfly.

In addition to poetry, she is credited with two short writings, "Mantrogopya" and "Yogangatrividhi", the latter written in the native "tripadi" metre, describing the various stages of spiritual enlightenment. Tradition has it that Akka Mahadevi preferred to wear no clothes, a form of renunciation which in her own words was the "most exalted spiritual state". She died while still in her twenties in a plantain grove in the holy city of <a href="Srisailam">Srisailam</a>. A poem by Akka Mahadevi:
Basavanna's nephew, Chennabasava, is more popular as a strategist and a theologian. Apart from authoring some notable and lengthy "Vachana" poems, he wrote on <a href="yoga">yogic</a> experiences in a book called "Mantragopya". He is known to have been the manager of the gatherings and the "Mahamane" ("great house") of Basavanna. Credited to Siddharama, another influential devotee and a native of Sonnalige (modern <a href="Sholapur">Sholapur</a>, <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>), are writings in "tripadi" metre and 1,379 extant poems (though he has claimed authorship of 68,000 poems). His poems were influenced by Basavanna's ideology and convey rejection of blind beliefs, the caste system, and sexual discrimination.

Artisan poets included Molige Maraiah, a wood cutter; Madivala Machayya, a washerman; Ambigere Chowdiah, a ferryman; Madara Dhooliah, a cobbler; Hendada Mariah, a toddy tapper; Turugahi Ramanna, a cowherd; Kannadi Remmitande, a mirror maker; and Revanna Siddha, a shepherd, as but a few in a long list of poets. Poets Dakkeya Bommaiah, Bahuroopi Chowdaiah, Kalaketaiah and Nageya Maritande were ritual street performers and their poems reflect images from their trade.

Several women poets made important contributions including: Basavanna's sister Nagalambike and his two wives, Gangambike and Neelambike, though Neelambike seems to have been the more prolific. Some female poets were wives of male poets in the Veerashaiva congregation. Notable among them are Satyakka, whose poems compare in quality to those of Akka Mahadevi, Kelavve (a <a href="dalit">dalit</a> poet), whose poems scorn at the upper caste people, Mahadevi and Lingamma, who wrote poems in a mystic language, Amuge Rayamma and Akkamma, who penned poems on the hypocrisy of religious pretences, Kadire Remavva (a spinner), who employed a cryptic language called "bedagu" in her poems, and Muktayakka, who is known for her debates with the patron saint Allama himself. Other names worthy of mention are Lakkamma, Ketaladevi, Guddavve and a princess called Bontadevi.

Challenging the very core of the caste-based society, the Veerashaivas conducted a marriage between an upper caste Brahmin bride and a lower caste Shudra groom. The resulting confrontation between rebellious Veerashaivas and the conservative upper classes lead to the assassination of King Bijjala II and the eviction of most devotees, including Basavanna, from Kalyani. The successors of King Bijjala II were weak, prompting Chalukya Someshvara IV, ruling from Annigeri, to attempt rebuilding his empire by invading Kalyani in 1183. Though his invasion was successful, his overall efforts failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Someshvara IV into exile in Banavasi in 1189. Though these turbulent events caused a setback to the Veerashaiva gatherings and creation of poems, the movement had set roots in the Kannada soil and regained popularity in the 15th century under the patronage of the rulers of the <a href="Vijayanagara%20Empire">Vijayanagara Empire</a>.

The post-Chalukya period is characterised by the popularity of Shaiva and Vaishnava devotional writings, though secular and courtly topics written in native metres continued to flourish. Native metres in vogue were the "shatpadi" (six-line verse), the "tripadi", the "ragle" (rhymed couplets) and the "sangatya" (compositions meant to be sung to the accompaniment a musical instrument). Overall, Kannada writings began to change from "marga" ("formal", due to Sanskritic influence) to "desi" ("vernacular") and become more accessible to the common man.

This change is apparent in the writings of the Hoysala court poets, some of whom are noted for pioneering works in native metres. The Veerashiava poet <a href="Harihara%20%28poet%29">Harihara</a>, one of the most prominent poets of the medieval era, established the "ragale" tradition with his biography of Basavanna ("Basavaraja Devara ragale", 1160), the earliest available biography of the social reformer and of the Kannada language as well. His nephew <a href="Raghavanka">Raghavanka</a> established the "shatpadi" metre in his unique and original narration of the story of <a href="Harishchandra">King Harishchandra</a> called "Harishchandra Kavya" (1200). Sisumayana is credited with introducing a new composition called "sangatya" (1232) in his allegorical poems "Tripuradahana" ("Burning of the triple fortress") and "Anjanacharita". Some Jain authors continued the "champu" tradition, such as <a href="Janna">Janna</a>, immortalised by his writing "Yashodhara Charite" (1207), a unique set of stories in 310 verses dealing with <a href="sadomasochism">sadomasochism</a> and <a href="transmigration%20of%20the%20soul">transmigration of the soul</a>. The earliest well-known Brahmin writers also emerged during the late 12th century and wrote on themes ranging from Vaishnava faith (<a href="Rudrabhatta">Rudrabhatta</a>'s "Jagannatha Vijaya", 1185) to secular treatises on poetics (Kavi Kama's "Sringara Ratnakara", on poetic sentiment and flavor).

After the fall of the Kalachuri empire, the "Vachana" poetic tradition halted temporarily. However, by the 14th century, the Veerashaivas who held influential positions in the <a href="Vijayanagara%20Empire">Vijayanagara Empire</a> were exerting their influence, especially during the reign of <a href="Deva%20Raya%20II">King Deva Raya II</a> (or Prouda Deva Raya). Although this period is not as famous for the proliferation of the "Vachana" poems as the 12th century was, contemporary writers adopted the preachings of the saints and devotees of the bygone era and made them the protagonists of their writings. Having found a rallying point to spread their faith, they began an era of commentaries, anthologies and biographies. Famous among biographies were Bhimakavi's "Basavapurana" (1369), Singiraja's "Mala-Basavapurana" (or "Singirajapurana", 1500) on the life of Basavanna, <a href="Chamarasa">Chamarasa</a>'s "Prabhulingalile" (1425) on the life of Allama Prabhu and Virupaksha Pandita's "Chenna Basavapurana" (1584), an account of Chennabasava. Among a long list of anthologies, four versions of the "Shunyasampadane" are the most well-known. The first version, completed in 1400 by Shivaganaprasadi Mahadevaiah, was written in the form of a dialogue between the protagonist, saint Allama Prabhu, and other well-known Veerashaiva devotees. Later versions were compiled by Halage Arya (1500), Gummalapura Siddhalingayati (1560) and Gulur Siddhaveeranodaya (1570). Writing "Vachana" poems was popularised again from the mid-16th century, though Kannada language had to wait till the 17th century to discover its greatest modern poet in this genre. <a href="Sarvajna">Sarvajna</a> ("lit." "The all knowing", 16th or 17th century), a <a href="mendicant">mendicant</a> poet-moralist and social reformer, left an indelible imprint on Kannada literature with his didactic poems, numbering about 2,100 in all. Written using the simple native "tripadi" metre to instruct the country folk, these poems cover a vast range of topics, from caste and religion to economics and administration, from arts and crafts to family life and health. Sarvajna's poems constitute some of Kannada's most popular works.

Four noted Brahmin writers of the Vijayanagara empire, <a href="Kumara%20Vyasa">Kumara Vyasa</a>, Timmanna Kavi, Kumara Valmiki and Chatu Vitthalanata proliferated the "shatpadi" metre in their versions of the Hindu epics. Inspired by the "Vachana" writers who used the song-prose medium to write their poems, the <a href="Haridasa">Haridasa</a> poets used genres such as the "kirthane" (musical compositions with two refrains – composition based on "<a href="raga">raga</a>", or tune and "<a href="Tala%20%28music%29">tala</a>", or rhythm), the "Suladi" (rhythm-based) and the "Ugabhoga" (melody-based) to convey their devotion to God. Their contributions to the south Indian classical music (<a href="Carnatic%20music">Carnatic music</a>) is well acclaimed, <a href="Purandaradasa">Purandaradasa</a> and <a href="Kanakadasa">Kanakadasa</a> being the most popular poets of this cadre. Purandaradasa was the most prolific Haridasa poet who wrote in the "ragale" metre and also earned the honorific "Karnataka Sangeeta Pitamaha" ("Father of Carnatic music"). Kanakadasa was versatile in many native metres. His "Mohana tarangini" is in the "sangatya" metre, "Nalacharita" and a book of morals for children called "Haribhakti-sara" are in the "shatpadi" metre.

Bob Marshall (wilderness activist)

Robert "Bob" Marshall (January 2, 1901November 11, 1939) was an American <a href="forester">forester</a>, writer and wilderness <a href="activist">activist</a> who is best remembered as the person who spearheaded the 1935 founding of the <a href="The%20Wilderness%20Society%20%28United%20States%29">Wilderness Society</a> in the United States. Marshall developed a love for the outdoors as a young child. He was an avid hiker and climber who visited the <a href="Adirondack%20Mountains">Adirondack Mountains</a> frequently during his youth, ultimately becoming one of the first <a href="Adirondack%20Forty-Sixers">Adirondack Forty-Sixers</a>. He also traveled to the <a href="Brooks%20Range">Brooks Range</a> of the far northern <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>n wilderness. He wrote numerous articles and books about his travels, including the bestselling 1933 book "<a href="Arctic%20Village%20%28book%29">Arctic Village</a>."

A scientist with a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">PhD</a> in <a href="plant%20physiology">plant physiology</a>, Marshall became independently wealthy after the death of his father in 1929. He had started his outdoor career in 1925 as forester with the U.S. Forest Service. He used his financial independence for expeditions to Alaska and other wilderness areas. Later he held two significant public appointed posts: chief of <a href="forestry">forestry</a> in the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs">Bureau of Indian Affairs</a>, from 1933 to 1937, and head of recreation management in the <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">Forest Service</a>, from 1937 to 1939, both during the administration of President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>. During this period, he directed the promulgation of regulations to preserve large areas of roadless land that were under federal management. Many years after his death, some of those areas were permanently protected from development, exploitation, and mechanization with the passage of the <a href="Wilderness%20Act">Wilderness Act</a> of 1964.

Defining wilderness as a social as well as an environmental ideal, Marshall promoted organization of a national group dedicated to the preservation of primeval land. In 1935, he was one of the principal founders of The Wilderness Society and personally provided most of the Society's funding in its first years. He also supported <a href="socialism">socialism</a> and <a href="civil%20liberties">civil liberties</a> throughout his life.

Marshall died of heart failure at the age of 38 in 1939. Twenty-five years later, partly as a result of his efforts, The Wilderness Society helped gain passage of the Wilderness Act. The Act was passed by Congress in 1964 and legally defined wilderness areas of the United States and protected some nine million acres (36,000 km) of federal land from development, road building and motorized transportation. Today, Marshall is considered largely responsible for the wilderness preservation movement. Several areas and landmarks, including The <a href="Bob%20Marshall%20Wilderness">Bob Marshall Wilderness</a> in <a href="Montana">Montana</a> and <a href="Mount%20Marshall%20%28New%20York%29">Mount Marshall</a> in the Adirondacks, have been named in his honor.

Born in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, Bob Marshall was the third of four children of <a href="Louis%20Marshall">Louis Marshall</a> (1856–1929) and Florence (née Lowenstein) Marshall (1873–1916).

His father, the son of Jewish immigrants from <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, was a noted wealthy constitutional lawyer, conservationist, and a champion of minority rights. The family moved to <a href="Syracuse%2C%20New%20York">Syracuse, New York</a>, where Louis Marshall was active in the Jewish community and a co-founder of the <a href="American%20Jewish%20Committee">American Jewish Committee</a>. In 1891, he was part of a national delegation that sought federal intervention on behalf of persecuted <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Russia%20and%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Russian Jews</a>. An amateur naturalist and active conservationist, Louis Marshall was instrumental in securing "forever wild" protection for the <a href="Adirondack%20Forest%20Preserve">Adirondack and Catskill Forest Preserves</a> in New York State. He helped found the <a href="New%20York%20State%20College%20of%20Forestry">New York State College of Forestry</a> at <a href="Syracuse%20University">Syracuse University</a>, now <a href="State%20University%20of%20New%20York%20College%20of%20Environmental%20Science%20and%20Forestry">State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry</a> (SUNY-ESF). Florence Marshall, meanwhile, devoted herself to her family, the education of young Jewish women, and the work of several Jewish welfare organizations.

Bob Marshall attended <a href="Felix%20Adler%20%28Society%20for%20Ethical%20Culture%29">Felix Adler</a>'s private <a href="Ethical%20Culture%20Fieldston%20School">Ethical Culture School</a> in New York City until 1919. The school nurtured independent thinking and commitment to social justice. Marshall became involved in nature from a young age; two of his childhood heroes were <a href="Meriwether%20Lewis">Meriwether Lewis</a> and <a href="William%20Clark%20%28explorer%29">William Clark</a>, who explored the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> in the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a>. His family took him to the Adirondack Mountains when he was six months old; they returned every summer for the next 25 years. After that, Marshall returned often on his own. His younger brother <a href="George%20Marshall%20%28conservationist%29">George</a> (1904–2000) later described the family's visits to <a href="Knollwood%20Club">Knollwood</a>, their summer camp on <a href="Lower%20Saranac%20Lake">Lower Saranac Lake</a> in the <a href="Adirondack%20State%20Park">Adirondack State Park</a>, as a time when they "entered a world of freedom and informality, of living plants and spaces, of fresh greens and exhilarating blues, of giant, slender pines and delicate pink twinflowers, of deer and mosquitoes, of fishing and guide boats and tramps through the woods".

Marshall was drawn to the outdoors. He discovered his passion for exploring, charting, and a love of climbing mountains, in part through the writings of <a href="Verplanck%20Colvin">Verplanck Colvin</a>, who during the post-<a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> decade surveyed the woods of northern New York. Throughout his life, Marshall kept a series of hiking notebooks, which he illustrated with photographs and filled with statistics. In 1915, Marshall climbed his first Adirondack peak, the <a href="Ampersand%20Mountain">Ampersand Mountain</a>, alongside his brother George and family friend Herb Clark, a <a href="Saranac%20Lake%2C%20New%20York">Saranac Lake</a> guide. The two brothers learned the arts of woodcraft and boating through Clark, who accompanied them on most of their longer trips during adolescence and early adulthood. By 1921, they became the first climbers to scale all 42 Adirondack Mountains believed to exceed , some of which had never been climbed. In 1924, the three became the first <a href="Adirondack%20Forty-Sixers">Adirondack Forty-Sixers</a>, hikers who have climbed to the summits of all 46 <a href="Adirondack%20High%20Peaks">High Peaks</a> of the Adirondacks.

After graduating from the Ethical Culture School, Marshall spent a year at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>. In 1920, he transferred to the <a href="New%20York%20State%20College%20of%20Forestry">New York State College of Forestry</a> at <a href="Syracuse%20University">Syracuse University</a>. Marshall had decided in his teens that he wanted to be a forester, writing then about his love of "the woods and solitude;" he wrote that he "should hate to spend the greater part of my lifetime in a stuffy office or in a crowded city". For a while he was unhappy and withdrawn at Syracuse. But, he succeeded academically and was known for his individuality. As one classmate put it, Marshall was "always doing something no one else would ever think of doing. He was constantly rating things—the Adirondack peaks, his best days with George, and dozens of others." Marshall became a member of Alpha Xi Sigma, the forestry college's honor society. He ran on the Syracuse University freshman track team and participated in both junior varsity <a href="lacrosse">lacrosse</a> and <a href="cross%20country%20running">cross country running</a>. Halfway through school, Marshall had become a class leader; he was elected as class secretary and appointed an associate editor of the "Empire Forester," the College's <a href="yearbook">yearbook</a>.

During the early 1920s, Marshall grew interested in promoting Adirondack recreation. In 1922, he became one of the charter members of the <a href="Adirondack%20Mountain%20Club">Adirondack Mountain Club</a> (ADK), an organization devoted to the building and maintenance of trails and the teaching of hiking in the park. In 1922, he prepared a 38-page guidebook, entitled "The High Peaks of the Adirondacks." Based on his pioneering experiences on the peaks, the guide recommends that "it's a great thing these days to leave civilization for a while and return to nature." Marshall provided a brief description of each peak and arranged them in order of "niceness of view and all around pleasure in view and climb."

In 1924, Marshall graduated "magna cum laude" with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science">Bachelor of Science</a> degree in forestry, finishing 4th of 59 at the College of Forestry. The senior yearbook described him as "the Champion Pond Hound of all time, a lad with a mania for statistics and shinnying mountain peaks, the boy who will go five miles [8 km] around to find something to wade thru. And the man who is <a href="Gunter%27s%20chain">rear chainman</a> for Bob will have to hump or get wet, and probably both." By 1925, he earned a <a href="Master%27s%20degree">Master's degree</a> in forestry from <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>.

Marshall started work in 1925 with the <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">Forest Service</a>, where he worked until 1928. Although he had hoped to go to Alaska, he was assigned that year to the Northern <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountain</a> Experiment Station at <a href="Missoula%2C%20Montana">Missoula, Montana</a>. Marshall's research at the experimental station focused on the dynamics of forest regeneration after <a href="wildfire">fires</a>. He had to fight a widespread fire after a July storm started more than 150 fires in <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>'s <a href="Kaniksu%20National%20Forest">Kaniksu National Forest</a>. He was put in charge of supporting and provisioning one of the crews led by the Forest Service. As he later recalled, Marshall worked "18 to 20 hours a day as time-keeper, Chief of Commissary, Camp Boss, and Inspector of the fire line". Spending time with loggers and fire fighters, and seeing the conditions under which they worked, Marshall learned vital lessons about labor issues and natural resource use. At the experimental station, Marshall became interested in the unsafe conditions for many working Americans. He began to develop <a href="Liberalism">liberal</a> and socialist philosophies.

After leaving the Forest Service in 1928, Marshall worked to complete his studies for a PhD in plant physiology at <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a> in Baltimore, Maryland. The following year he made his first trip to Alaska, visiting the upper <a href="Koyukuk%20River">Koyukuk River</a> and the central Brooks Range, and preparing for an extended stay for study. The scientific objective of the trip was to study tree growth at the northern <a href="tree%20line">timberline</a> near the <a href="Continental%20divide">Arctic Divide</a>. For his 15-month sojourn in the small town of <a href="Wiseman%2C%20Alaska">Wiseman, Alaska</a>, Marshall rented a one-room cabin next to the only <a href="Roadhouse%20%28facility%29">roadhouse</a> in the village. He furnished it with books, records, a phonograph player, and a writing desk. He placed the desk so that he could sit by the cabin's single window and admire the view of the Koyukuk River and the range of steep, snow-covered mountains in the background. His travels engendered in him a great love for the central Brooks Range in the Alaskan wilderness. Marshall was one of the first to explore much of the range, especially the headwaters of the North fork of the Koyukuk River, where he bestowed the name "<a href="Gates%20of%20the%20Arctic">Gates of the Arctic</a>" on a pair of mountains, Boreal Mtn. (6,375 ft) and Frigid Crags (5,501 ft.).

Bob Marshall's mother died of cancer in 1916. In 1929, his father Louis died in <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>, Switzerland at the age of 72. The four children inherited most of their father's estate, which was worth several million dollars. Although Marshall became financially independent, he continued to work throughout his life. He used his wealth to support causes, such as The Wilderness Society, which he essentially supported in its early years, and to pursue his interests.

In 1930, Marshall received his Ph.D. under the supervision of <a href="Burton%20Edward%20Livingston">Dr. Burton E. Livingston</a> at the Johns Hopkins Laboratory of Plant Physiology. Marshall's doctoral dissertation was titled "An Experimental Study of the Water Relations of Seedling Conifers with Special Reference to Wilting."

In February 1930, Marshall published an essay, after it was rejected by four magazines. This is now celebrated as a defense of wilderness preservation, and the essay expanded themes developed in his earlier article, "The Wilderness as a Minority Right." Published in "<a href="The%20Scientific%20Monthly">The Scientific Monthly</a>," the essay is considered one of Marshall's most important works. He argued that wilderness was worth saving not only because of its unique aesthetic qualities, but because it could provide visitors with a chance for adventure. Marshall stated: "There is just one hope of repulsing the tyrannical ambition of civilization to conquer every niche on the whole earth. That hope is the organization of spirited people who will fight for the freedom of the wilderness." The article became a much-quoted call to action and by the late 20th century was considered seminal by wilderness historians.

In July 1930, Marshall and his brother George climbed nine Adirondack High Peaks in one day, setting a new record.

In August of that year, Marshall returned to Alaska. He planned to explore the Brooks Range to pursue more tree research, and he also wanted to study the Arctic frontier society of Wiseman. He described the village, which was 200 miles north of <a href="Fairbanks">Fairbanks</a>, as "the happiest civilization of which I have knowledge." Befriending a number of the area's inhabitants, he meticulously recorded thousands of hours of conversation with them. Marshall persuaded a number of villagers, most of whom were single males, to take intelligence tests. He also recorded statistics on all aspects of the villagers' lives, from their financial resources to their diets to their sexual habits. He spent 12-1/2 months—from late August 1930 to early September 1931—exploring and collecting data. From this work (and his previous trip to Alaska), he wrote "<a href="Arctic%20Village%20%28book%29">Arctic Village</a>," a sociological study of life in the wilderness. Published in 1933 the book was selected by the <a href="Literary%20Guild">Literary Guild</a> and became a bestseller. Marshall shared the royalties from the book with the residents of Wiseman.

Marshall returned to the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a> in late September 1931. Although he was writing "Arctic Village," he also wrote prolifically on other topics and published several articles about American forestry. In particular, he was concerned that few articles of this time addressed the issue of <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>, and he wrote a letter to the president of the <a href="American%20Forestry%20Association">American Forestry Association</a>, George D. Pratt, on the matter. He also pursued a variety of other activities: he accepted an invitation to serve on a committee to dedicate a memorial (Louis Marshall Memorial Hall) to his father at the forestry college in Syracuse. He lectured in various cities, delivering speeches about his travels and wilderness preservation.

Shortly after his return, Marshall was asked by Earle Clapp, head of the Forest Service's Branch of Research, to help initiate badly needed reforms in the forest-products industry and to create a broader vision of national forest management. Marshall moved to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> in September 1932 to assume the appointed position, which entailed writing initiatives for forest recreation. He immediately began compiling a list of the remaining roadless areas in the United States. He sent this data to regional foresters, urging them to set aside areas for wilderness; all of them responded negatively. Marshall's contributions to what became known as the <a href="Copeland%20Report">Copeland Report</a> amounted to three extensive chapters of a two-volume, 1,677-page work. He considered it "the best piece of forestry work I have yet done."

During the depths of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> in 1932–1933, Marshall had defined himself as a <a href="socialist">socialist</a>. He told a correspondent: "I wish very sincerely that Socialism would be put into effect right away and the profit system eliminated." He became active in the Tenants Unemployed League of the District of Columbia, a group that helped unemployed people with housing problems; later he joined the fight against federal aid cuts to scientific research. Having learned of the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a> from his father, he served as chairman of the Washington, DC chapter. Marshall was arrested and briefly held for participating in a March 1933 <a href="United%20Front">United Front</a> demonstration.

Marshall did not forget his conservation causes, and soon was pondering the question of wilderness and <a href="national%20park">national park</a>s. In the early 1930s, he joined the <a href="National%20Parks%20Conservation%20Association">National Parks Association</a>, eventually becoming a member of its board.

In 1933, Marshall published "The People's Forests" [On Forestry in America], in which he "made a forceful case for socializing the nation's industrial timberlands." He believed that public ownership was the "best way to ensure both the sustainability of the forest industry and the preservation of wilderness."

In August 1933, Marshall was appointed as director of the Forestry Division of the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs">Bureau of Indian Affairs</a> (BIA), a position he held for four years. The BIA managed the resources of many Indian reservation lands, deciding on logging and other leases for resource extraction. This was before many tribes asserted their sovereignty and took over their own management of their lands. Marshall besieged government personnel with letters, telephone calls, and personal visits in the cause of wilderness, rapidly gaining recognition in Washington as a champion of preservation. One of his last initiatives as chief forester of the BIA was to recommend designation of of Indian reservation lands for federal management as either "roadless" or "wild" areas. The administrative order, which created 16 wilderness areas, received approval shortly after Marshall left the BIA to join the Forest Service again. He was appointed to a political position there as well.

Marshall became increasingly concerned with civilization's encroachment upon the wild lands, writing:
The sounds of the forest are entirely obliterated by the roar of the motor. The smell of pine needles and flowers and herbs and freshly turned dirt and all the other delicate odors of the forest are drowned in the stench of gasoline. The feeling of wind blowing in the face and of soft ground under foot are all lost.

In 1934, Marshall visited <a href="Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee">Knoxville, Tennessee</a> and met with <a href="Benton%20MacKaye">Benton MacKaye</a>, a regional planner who gained support to designate and lay out the <a href="Appalachian%20Trail">Appalachian Trail</a>. Together with <a href="Harvey%20Broome">Harvey Broome</a>, a Knoxville lawyer, they discussed Marshall's 1930 proposal for an organization dedicated to wilderness preservation. <a href="Bernard%20Frank%20%28wilderness%20activist%29">Bernard Frank</a>, a fellow forester, joined them later in the year; the men mailed an "Invitation to Help Organize a Group to Preserve the American Wilderness" to like-minded individuals. The invitation expressed their desire "to integrate the growing sentiment which we believe exists in this country for holding wild areas sound-proof as well as sight-proof from our increasingly mechanized life," and their conviction that such wildernesses were "a serious human need rather than a luxury and plaything".

On January 21, 1935, the organizing committee published a folder stating that "for the purpose of fighting off invasion of the wilderness and of stimulating ... an appreciation of its multiform emotional, intellectual, and scientific values, we are forming an organization to be known as <a href="The%20Wilderness%20Society%20%28United%20States%29">the WILDERNESS SOCIETY</a>". They invited <a href="Aldo%20Leopold">Aldo Leopold</a> to act as the society's first president, but the position ultimately went to <a href="Robert%20Sterling%20Yard">Robert Sterling Yard</a>. Marshall provided the bulk of the society's funding in its early years, beginning with an anonymous donation of $1,000. His brother George was also deeply involved in the society.

T. H. Watkins, who later edited the society's magazine, "Wilderness," contended that before Marshall and the Society there was "no true movement" for the preservation of the nation's roadless and primitive areas. "One could comfortably argue," Watkins wrote in 1985 on the occasion of the society's 50th anniversary, "that Robert Marshall was personally responsible for the preservation of more wilderness than any individual in history".

Marshall's last years were productive. By May 1937, he was appointed as director of the Forest Service's Division of Recreation and Lands. Over the next two years, Marshall worked on two major initiatives: an effort to extend national forest recreational opportunities to people with lower incomes (as well as dismantling discriminatory barriers against ethnic minorities), and a program to preserve more wilderness within the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Forest">national forest</a>s. His biographer James Glover asserts that Marshall was probably the first high-level official to seriously fight ethnic discrimination in Forest Service recreational policies, at a time when racial segregation of public facilities was law throughout the Southern states and in some other states. During this time, Marshall continued to financially support The Wilderness Society, as well as various civil rights, labor, and socialist organizations.

In August 1938, Marshall began his last trip to Alaska, which included further exploration of the Brooks Range. He became a subject of interest of the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a>, a <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> committee investigating "un-American" activities. Known as the Dies Committee for its chairman, <a href="Martin%20Dies%2C%20Jr.">Martin Dies</a>, the committee announced in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" that eight federal officials (including Marshall) were contributing to <a href="communism">communism</a> because of their connections to such organizations as the Workers Alliance and the <a href="American%20League%20for%20Peace%20and%20Democracy">American League for Peace and Democracy</a>. Marshall was too busy traveling to respond to the allegations: after leaving Alaska he spent time in <a href="Washington%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Washington State</a>, Montana, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>, <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>, <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> and <a href="California">California</a>. He visited Alaska for one last time the following year and made a tour of western national forests, addressing aspects of forest recreation.

While Marshall was in Washington State that September, two regulations (U-1 and U2) developed by his Forest Service committee were signed by Secretary of Agriculture <a href="Henry%20A.%20Wallace">Henry A. Wallace</a>; these "U-Regulations" protected wilderness and wild areas from road building, logging, hotels, and similarly destructive activities. It made their protected status more secure.

While on a midnight train from Washington, D.C. to New York City on November 11, 1939, Marshall died of apparent heart failure at the age of 38. His sudden death came as a shock because of his relatively young age and high level of physical activity. He was greatly mourned by friends and relatives. His brother George (who lived to be 96) said: "Bob's death shattered me and was the most traumatic event in my life." Marshall was interred at <a href="Salem%20Fields%20Cemetery">Salem Fields Cemetery</a>, a Jewish burial ground in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, New York City, beside his parents and sister Ruth (Putey) Marshall, who had died of Congestive heart failure at age 38 in 1936.

A bachelor, Marshall left virtually all of his $1.5 million estate (equivalent to $ million today) to three causes dear to him: wilderness preservation, socialism, civil liberties. Three trusts were established in his will. The first, focused on education related to "the theory of production for use and not for profit", received half of his estate; the second, aimed at "safeguarding and advancement of the cause of civil liberties", received one-quarter of his estate; and the third supported "preservation of the wilderness conditions in outdoor America," establishing what became the Robert Marshall Wilderness Fund. Trustees of the latter trust included Robert Sterling Yard, Bob Marshall's brother George, Irving Clark, <a href="Olaus%20Murie">Olaus Murie</a> and Bill Zimmerman, early leaders of The Wilderness Society. Marshall left money to only one individual: $10,000 (equivalent to $ today) to his old friend and guide, Herb Clark.

Marshall's posthumously published book "Alaska Wilderness, Exploring the Central Brooks Range" (1956), edited by his brother George, became a seminal work. It inspired the establishment of the <a href="Gates%20of%20the%20Arctic%20National%20Park">Gates of the Arctic National Park</a>. His Adirondack writings were published by Lost Pond Press in 2006, as an anthology titled "Bob Marshall in the Adirondacks: Writings of a Pioneering Peak-Bagger, Pond-Hopper and Wilderness Preservationist." It was edited by Phil Brown, editor of the "Adirondack Explorer" news magazine. According to the publisher, the book includes "numerous accounts of his hikes in the High Peaks and the vast wild region south of <a href="Cranberry%20Lake">Cranberry Lake</a>, spirited defenses of the state's forever-wild <a href="Forest%20Preserve%20%28New%20York%29">Forest Preserve</a>, a charming portrait of Herb Clark, and excerpts from an unpublished novel set partly in the Adirondacks".

Since its founding, The Wilderness Society has helped pass many bills for preservation and conservation of public lands. It has also purchased lands for preservation, contributing a total of 109 million acres (421,000 km) to the National Wilderness Preservation System. Marshall's dream of permanent wilderness protection became a reality 25 years after his death when President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> signed the <a href="Wilderness%20Act">Wilderness Act</a> into law on September 3, 1964 in the Rose Garden of the White House. The ceremony was attended by Alice Zahniser and Mardy Murie, the widows of two prominent members of The Wilderness Society.

Written by <a href="Howard%20Zahniser">Howard Zahniser</a>—who died of a heart attack at age 58 four months before the bill was signed into law— the legislation authorized the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> to set aside a total of 9 million acres in selected areas in the national forests, national parks, national wildlife refuges, and other federal lands as units to be kept permanently unchanged by humans. It also provided for more acreage to be designated as wilderness for preservation. In defining wilderness, Zahniser invoked Marshall and his contemporaries, stating that "in contrast with those areas where man and his own works dominate the landscape, [wilderness] is hereby recognized as an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain." The act's signing was the most important event in the history of The Wilderness Society; members <a href="Mardy%20Murie">Mardy Murie</a> and <a href="Alice%20Zahniser">Alice Zahniser</a> stood beside Johnson as he signed the legislation. With the Wilderness Act, the United States guaranteed permanent protection of wild and scenic natural areas for future generations. The Society's most prestigious honor, the Robert Marshall Award, is named in Marshall's honor; its first recipient was <a href="Sigurd%20F.%20Olson">Sigurd F. Olson</a> in 1981.

The <a href="Bob%20Marshall%20Wilderness">Bob Marshall Wilderness</a>, an area located in <a href="Flathead%20National%20Forest">Flathead</a> and <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20National%20Forest">Lewis and Clark</a> national forests in Montana, was created In the same year (1964) that the Wilderness Act became law. It had previously been set aside in 1941 as the South Fork, Pentagon, and Sun River Primitive Areas. The area encompasses a million acres (4,000 km) and is one of the best-preserved ecosystems in the world. Known as "The Bob," it is the fifth-largest wilderness in the contiguous 48 states (<a href="Death%20Valley%20National%20Park">Death Valley</a> is the largest). In compliance with the 1964 Wilderness Act, no <a href="motor%20vehicle">motorized</a> or <a href="machine">mechanical</a> equipment (including bicycles or <a href="hang%20gliding">hang gliders</a>) is permitted. Although camping and fishing are allowed with proper permit, the area is roadless, and logging and mining are prohibited. There are numerous U.S. Forest Service cabins in The Bob for use by Forest Service personnel. The Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex (which encompasses Bob Marshall, Scapegoat, and <a href="Great%20Bear%20Wilderness">Great Bear Wilderness</a>es) is a habitat for the <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a>, <a href="lynx">lynx</a>, <a href="cougar">cougar</a>, <a href="wolf">wolf</a>, <a href="American%20Black%20Bear">black bear</a>, <a href="moose">moose</a>, <a href="elk">elk</a> and a variety of other birds, mammals, and plants.

<a href="Mount%20Marshall%20%28New%20York%29">Mount Marshall</a> (previously called Mount Herbert), which stands high in the Adirondack Mountains, Camp Bob Marshall in the <a href="Black%20Hills">Black Hills</a>, and in the Brooks Range of Alaska, north of the Arctic Circle, are also named for him. In 2008, the Adirondack Council was encouraging the state of New York to create the Bob Marshall Great Wilderness near <a href="Cranberry%20Lake">Cranberry Lake</a> in the western Adirondacks; if successful, it would be the largest wilderness area in the Adirondack Park at .

At the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-ESF), Bob Marshall Fellowships in wilderness management and policy studies are offered to graduate students and faculty engaged in research in recreation resource management; the fellowships are supported by the college's Bob Marshall Endowed Fund. Also at SUNY-ESF, a student "<a href="outing%20club">outing club</a>" named after Marshall honors his love of the outdoors and the Adirondack mountains. A bronze plaque commemorating Bob Marshall's contributions to wilderness conservation was installed in the entrance of Marshall Hall, the hub of campus events and activities, which was named after his father.

Greek battleship Salamis

Salamis () was a partially constructed <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>, referred to as either a <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a> or <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>, that was ordered for the <a href="Greek%20Navy">Greek Navy</a> from the <a href="AG%20Vulcan">AG Vulcan</a> shipyard in <a href="Hamburg%2C%20Germany">Hamburg, Germany</a>, in 1912. She was ordered as part of a Greek naval rearmament program meant to modernize the fleet, in response to <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> naval expansion after the <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281897%29">Greco-Turkish War</a> of 1897. "Salamis" and several other battleships—none of which were delivered to either navy—represented the culmination of a naval <a href="arms%20race">arms race</a> between the two countries that had significant effects on the <a href="First%20Balkan%20War">First Balkan War</a> and <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. 

The design for "Salamis" was revised several times during the construction process, in part due to Ottoman acquisitions. Early drafts of the vessel called for a displacement of , with an armament of six guns in three <a href="gun%20turret">twin-gun turret</a>s. The final version of the design was significantly larger, at , with an armament of eight 14-inch guns in four turrets. The ship was to have had a top speed of , higher than that of other battleships of the period.

Work began on the <a href="keel">keel</a> on 23 July 1913, and the hull was launched on 11 November 1914. Construction stopped in December 1914, following the outbreak of World War I in July of that year. The German navy employed the unfinished ship as a floating barracks in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>. The armament for this ship was ordered from <a href="Bethlehem%20Steel">Bethlehem Steel</a> in the United States and could not be delivered due to the British <a href="blockade">blockade</a> of Germany. Bethlehem sold the guns to Britain instead and they were used to arm the four <a href="monitor%20%28warship%29">monitors</a>. The hull of the ship remained intact after the war and became the subject of a protracted legal dispute. "Salamis" was finally awarded to the builders and the hull was scrapped in 1932.

Following the <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281897%29">Greco-Turkish War</a> of 1897, during which the Ottoman fleet had proved incapable of challenging Greece's navy for control of the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>, the Ottomans began a naval expansion program, initially rebuilding several old <a href="ironclad%20warship">ironclad warship</a>s into more modern vessels. In response, the Greek government decided in 1905 to rebuild its fleet, which at that time was centered on the three s of 1880s vintage. Beginning in 1908, the Greek Navy sought design proposals from foreign shipyards. Tenders from <a href="Vickers">Vickers</a>, of Britain, for small, battleships were not taken up.

In 1911, a constitutional change in Greece allowed the government to hire naval experts from other countries, which led to the invitation of a <a href="British%20naval%20mission%20to%20Greece%20%281911%E2%80%931912%29">British naval mission</a> to advise the navy on its rearmament program. The British officers recommended a program of two battleships and a large <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>; offers from Vickers and <a href="Armstrong-Whitworth">Armstrong-Whitworth</a> were submitted for the proposed battleships. The Vickers design was for a smaller ship armed with nine guns, while Armstrong-Whitworth proposed a larger ship armed with guns. The Greek government did not pursue these proposals. Later in the year, Vickers issued several proposals for smaller vessels like those it had designed in 1908. 

The initial step in the Greek rearmament program was completed with the purchase of the Italian-built armored cruiser in October 1909. The Ottomans, in turn, purchased two German <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s, and , amplifying the naval <a href="arms%20race">arms race</a> between the two countries. The Greek Navy attempted to buy two older French battleships, and when that purchase failed to materialize, they tried unsuccessfully to buy a pair of British battleships. They then tried to buy ships from the United States, but were rebuffed due to concerns that such a sale would alienate the Ottomans, with whom the Americans had significant industrial and commercial interests. The Ottomans ordered the dreadnought in August 1911, threatening Greek control of the Aegean. The Greeks were faced with a choice of conceding the arms race, or ordering new <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s of their own. 

<a href="Rear%20Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Lionel%20Grant%20Tufnell">Lionel Grant Tufnell</a>, the head of a British naval mission to Greece, advocated purchasing another armored cruiser like "Gerogios Averof", along with several smaller vessels, and allocating funds to modernizing the Greek naval base at <a href="Salamis%20Naval%20Base">Salamis</a>; this proposal was supported by Prime Minister <a href="Eleftherios%20Venizelos">Eleftherios Venizelos</a>, who sought to control naval spending in the tight Greek budget projected for 1912. The plan came to nothing, as the Greek government waited for the arrival of British advisers for the Salamis project. In early 1912, the Greek Navy convened a committee that would be in charge of acquiring a new capital ship to counter "Reşadiye", initially conceived as a <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>. The new ship would be limited to a <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displacement</a> of , since that was the largest vessel the floating dry dock in <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> could accommodate. The program was finalized in March, and along with the new battlecruiser, the Greeks <a href="Request%20for%20tender">invited tenders</a> for <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s, <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s, and a <a href="depot%20ship">depot ship</a> to support them.

Ten British, four French, three German, three American, one Austrian, and two Italian shipyards all submitted proposals for these contracts, with Britain's Vickers and Armstrong-Whitworth submitting the same designs proposed in 1911. Tufnell was part of the committee overseeing the process, but found that the Greeks strongly opposed the British designs. Vickers eventually withdrew from the competition, and the cost of Armstrong's proposal was higher than other proposals. Still, the British had hopes of obtaining the contract due to the relationship between the Greek and British navies, reflected by the number of British officers that had been seconded to the Greek Navy in recent years. French yards, on the other hand, complained that the British were unfairly benefiting from the presence of their naval mission. During the competition, the Greek Navy decided that Vickers' hull design was best, but American guns, ammunition, and armor were superior to any of the British designs. In the end, neither got the contracts, as negotiations between Venizelos and the German Minister to Greece eventually secured the contracts for Germany. 

In June 1912, the Greek Navy selected tenders from Germany's <a href="AG%20Vulcan%20Stettin">AG Vulcan</a> for two destroyers and six torpedo boats, to be completed in just three to four months. This exceptionally short timeframe was accomplished through the help of the German Navy, which allowed the Greeks to take over German ships then being constructed. The contract price was evidently low, as one British firm complained that they could not understand how Vulcan would make a profit. Then, one month later, the Greeks selected Vulcan again for the construction of their battlecruiser, with its armor and armament coming from <a href="Bethlehem%20Steel">Bethlehem Steel</a> in the United States. British firms were furious, again alleging that it would be impossible for Vulcan to make a profit on the contract, and surmising that the German government was subsidizing the purchase to get a foothold in the shipbuilding market. The Greeks, for their part, countered that the British manufacturers were colluding to keep armor plate prices high, and so they were able to significantly decrease their costs by ordering the ship's armor in the United States.

The initial design called for a ship long with a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , a <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of , and a displacement of . The ship was designed with 2-shaft turbines rated at 26,000 shp for a top speed of . The armament was to be six guns in twin turrets all on the centerline with one <a href="amidships">amidships</a>, eight , eight , and four guns, and two <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s. 

The design was revised several times. In mid-1912, as tensions were developing that led to the <a href="First%20Balkan%20War">First Balkan War</a>, the Greek Navy began serious efforts to increase its strength. In August, they were seeking only minor alterations in the ship design, but early naval operations during the war convinced the naval command of the advantages a larger ship would provide. Tufnell suggested a different reason for the design changes, accusing the Germans of offering a cheap but unseaworthy design, obtaining the contract, then making a push for a more expensive but also more practical design. 

Hovering over all of these was the possibility that the dreadnoughts of the <a href="South%20American%20dreadnought%20race">South American dreadnought race</a> could be put up for sale, a prospect both countries pursued. Two, from Brazil, were already completed, and a third was under construction in Britain. Another two, for Argentina, were being built in the United States. Naval historian Paul G. Halpern wrote of this situation that "the sudden acquisition by a single power of all or even some of these ships might have been enough to tip a delicate balance of power such as that which prevailed in the Mediterranean." Both the Greeks and Ottomans were reportedly interested in the Argentine ships, and Venizelos attempted to buy one of the s then being built in the United States for the <a href="Argentine%20Navy">Argentine Navy</a> as an alternative to redesigning "Salamis", in the process delaying her completion.

When the Argentine government refused to sell the ship, he agreed to redesigning "Salamis", and a committee that included Greek and British naval officers was created to revise the design. The committee favored a design, but <a href="Hubert%20Searle%20Cardale">Hubert Searle Cardale</a>, the only member of the British mission drawn from the Royal Navy's active list, proposed an increase to , since the increase would allow for a substantially more powerful vessel. Venizelos initially approved an increase in displacement to 16,500 LT, but he opposed any further increases. The Foreign Minister, <a href="Lambros%20Koromilas">Lambros Koromilas</a>, and the Speaker of the Parliament, <a href="Nikolaos%20Stratos">Nikolaos Stratos</a>, conspired to have the larger proposal adopted while Venizelos was attending the peace conference that resulted in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20London%20%281913%29">Treaty of London</a>. Koromilas and Stratos misrepresented Venizelos' position to the rest of the <a href="Cabinet%20%28government%29">cabinet</a> and secured their approval for the new contract.

Koromilas' and Stratos' deception proved effective, and the enlarged proposal was adopted on 23 December 1912. The most significant changes were a 50% increase in displacement, the addition of a fourth twin-gun turret, and the arrangement of the main battery in <a href="Superfire">superfiring</a> pairs. The ship was to be delivered to the Greek Navy by March 1915, at a cost of <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>1,693,000. M. K. Barnett, writing for "Scientific American", remarked that the ship would "not mark any particular advance in warship design, being, rather, an effort to combine the greatest defensive and offensive qualities with the least cost." The "Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers", however, believed that the ship was designed for speed and firepower at the expensive of heavy defensive armor. Upon his return, Venizelos attempted to have the new contract cancelled, but Vulcan refused, noting that "Prime Ministers rise and fall from power and the influence of Venizelos will not be enduring." The order for "Salamis", which has been referred to alternatively as a battleship or battlecruiser, made Greece the fourteenth and final country to order a dreadnought-type ship.

The modifications to the design came over the objections of the British, including <a href="Prince%20Louis%20of%20Battenberg">Prince Louis of Battenberg</a> and the new head of the British naval mission in Greece, Rear Admiral <a href="Mark%20Kerr%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Mark Kerr</a>. Battenberg wrote that a Greek purchase of modern capital ships would be "undesirable from every point of view", as the country's finances could not support them and the increasing power of <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es were making smaller ships more dangerous. Along much the same lines, Kerr suggested to Venizelos that a fleet built around smaller warships would be better suited for the constricted Aegean Sea. Strongly opposing these views were the Greek Navy and King <a href="Constantine%20I%20of%20Greece">Constantine I of Greece</a>, both of whom desired a regular battle fleet, as they believed that it was the only way of assuring Greek naval superiority over the Ottomans.

"Salamis" was long <a href="length%20at%20the%20waterline">at the waterline</a> with a full <a href="flush%20deck">flush deck</a>, and had a beam of and a draft of . The ship was designed to displace . She would have been fitted with two tripod masts. Had the battleship been completed, she was to have been powered by three <a href="AEG">AEG</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each of which drove a <a href="propeller">propeller</a> shaft. The turbines were supplied with steam by eighteen coal-fired <a href="Water-tube%20boiler%23Yarrow">Yarrow boilers</a>. The boilers would have been ducted into two widely-spaced <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnels</a>. This would have provided "Salamis" with and a top speed of . This speed was significantly faster than the top speed of most contemporary battleships, , which contributed to her classification as a battlecruiser. A large crane was to be installed between the funnels to handle the ship's boats.

The primary armament of the ship was to be eight <a href="14%26quot%3B/45%20caliber%20gun">/45 caliber guns</a> mounted in four twin-gun turrets, all of which were built by Bethlehem Steel. Two turrets were to be mounted in a superfiring arrangement forward of the main <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>, with the other two mounted similarly aft of the funnels. These guns were capable of firing armor-piercing or high-explosive shells. The shells were fired at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of . The guns proved to be highly resistant to wear in British service, though they suffered from significant barrel droop after around 250 shells had been fired through them, which contributed to poor accuracy after extended use. The turrets that housed the guns allowed for depression to −5° and elevation to 15°, and they were electrically operated.

There is some disagreement over the nature of the ship's intended secondary battery. According to Gardiner and Gray, the battery was to consist of twelve /50 <a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a> guns, also manufactured by Bethlehem, mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s amidships, six on either side. These guns fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2,800 f/s (853 m/s). According to <a href="Norman%20Friedman">Norman Friedman</a>, these twelve guns were sold to Britain after the war broke out, where they were used to fortify the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>'s main base at <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>. But <a href="Antony%20Preston">Antony Preston</a> disagrees, stating that the guns were to have been <a href="BL%205.5%20inch%20Mark%20I%20naval%20gun">guns</a> ordered from the <a href="Coventry%20Ordnance%20Works">Coventry Ordnance Works</a>. "Salamis"s armament was rounded out by twelve quick-firing guns, also mounted in casemates, and five submerged torpedo tubes.

"Salamis" had an <a href="armored%20belt">armored belt</a> that was thick in the central section of the ship, where it protected critical areas, such as the ammunition <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and machinery spaces. On either end of the ship, past the main battery gun turrets, the belt was decreased to thick; the height of the belt was also decreased in these areas. The main armored deck was in the central portion of the ship, and as with the belt armor, in less important areas the thickness was decreased to . The main battery gun turrets were protected by 9.875-inch armor plate on the sides and face, and the <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s in which they were placed were protected by the same thickness of armor. The <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> was lightly armored, with only worth of protection.

The <a href="keel">keel</a> for "Salamis" was <a href="laid%20down">laid down</a> on 23 July 1913. The naval balance of power in the Aegean, however, was soon to change. The Brazilian Navy put their third dreadnought () up for sale in October 1913, and they found no shortage of countries interested in acquiring it, including Russia, Italy, Greece, and the Ottoman Empire. The British and French were also highly involved, given their interests in the Mediterranean; in November, the French agreed to back Greece with a large loan as a way of preventing Italy from acquiring the ship. Moreover, the Greek consul general in Britain claimed that the <a href="Bank%20of%20England">Bank of England</a> was prepared to advance all of the money needed to purchase the ship as soon as a French loan was guaranteed. Arrangements for all this took quite some time, however, and at the end of December, the Ottomans were able to secure "Rio de Janeiro" with a private loan from a French bank.

The purchase caused a panic in Greece, as the balance of naval power would shift to the Ottomans in the near future. The Greek government pressed AG Vulcan to finish "Salamis" as quickly as possible, but she could not be completed before mid-1915, by which time both of the new Ottoman battleships would have been delivered. The Greeks ordered two dreadnoughts from French yards, slightly modified versions of the French ; the first, "<a href="List%20of%20battleships%20of%20Greece%23Vasilefs%20Konstantinos">Vasilefs Konstantinos</a>", was laid down on 12 June 1914. As a stopgap measure, they purchased a pair of pre-dreadnought battleships from the United States: and , which became and , respectively. Kerr criticized this purchase as "<a href="wikt%3Apenny%20wise%20and%20pound%20foolish">penny-wise and pound-foolish</a>" for ships that were "entirely useless for war", carrying a price that could have paid for a brand-new dreadnought.

The outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in July 1914 drastically altered the situation; the British Government declared a naval blockade of Germany in August after it entered the war. The blockade meant that the guns could not be delivered, but the ship was nevertheless <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> on 11 November 1914. With no possibility of arming the ship, work was halted on 31 December 1914. In addition, manpower shortages created by the war, along with the redirection of steel production to the needs of the Army, meant that less critical projects could not be completed, especially since other warships were nearing completion and could be finished much more quickly. By this time Greece had only paid AG Vulcan £450,000. Bethlehem refused to send the main battery guns to Greece. The 14-inch guns were instead sold to the British, who used them to arm the four s. 

The wartime activities of the ship are unclear. According to a postwar report written for the <a href="Proceedings%20%28magazine%29">"Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute"</a>, the incomplete vessel was towed to <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>, where she was used as a barracks ship. The modern naval historian René Greger states that the incomplete hull never left Hamburg. Some contemporary observers believed the ship had been completed for service with the German Navy, and British Admiral <a href="John%20Jellicoe">John Jellicoe</a>, the commander of the Grand Fleet, received intelligence that the ship might have been in service by 1916. Other observers, such as Barnett, pointed to the difficulty the German Navy would have had in rearming the ship with German guns, given the fact that Germany possessed no designs for naval guns of that caliber or mountings suitable for use aboard "Salamis". He regarded the claim that she had been put into service "doubtful". Barnett's assessment was correct; a substantial rebuilding of the ship's barbette structures would have been required to accommodate German guns, and since guns available for naval use were not easily available owing to the needs of the <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German Army</a>, work was directed toward German vessels under construction like the battlecruiser . The British realized the rumor was false when the ship did not appear at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> on 31 May – 1 June 1916.

Regardless of the ship's wartime disposition, however, "Proceedings" noted in 1920 that it was "improbable" that construction would resume upon the ship. Indeed, the Greek navy refused to accept the incomplete hull, and as a result AG Vulcan sued the Greek government in 1923. A lengthy arbitration ensued. The Greek navy argued that the ship, which was designed in 1912, was now obsolete and that under the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> it could not be armed by the German shipyard anyway. The Greeks requested that Vulcan return advance payments made before work had stopped. The dispute went before the Greco-German Mixed Arbitral Tribunal (established under Article 304 of the Treaty of Versailles), which dragged on throughout the 1920s. In 1924, a Dutch admiral was appointed by the tribunal to evaluate the Greek complaints, and he ultimately sided with Vulcan, probably in part due to Greek inquiries to Vulcan earlier that year as to the possibility of modernizing the design. Vulcan's response did not satisfy Greek requirements, so the proposal was dropped.

In 1928, with the impending recommissioning of the Turkish battlecruiser "Yavuz" (ex-), Greece considered responding positively to an offer from Vulcan to reach a compromise, one option being to complete and modernize "Salamis". The cost of the ship would be absorbed by the war reparations Germany owed Greece for the years 1928 through 1930 and part of 1931. Admiral <a href="Periklis%20Argyropoulos">Periklis Argyropoulos</a>, the Minister of Marine, wanted to accept the offer, pointing to a study by the General Staff that demonstrated that a modernized "Salamis" would be capable of defeating "Yavuz" owing to the heavier armor and more powerful main battery of the Greek ship. The British naval architect <a href="Eustace%20Tennyson%20d%27Eyncourt">Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt</a> issued a study in support of Argyropoulos, pointing out that "Salamis" would likely also be faster than "Yavuz" and would have a stronger anti-aircraft battery. Commander Andreas Kolialexis opposed acquiring "Salamis", and he wrote a memorandum in mid-1929 to Venizelos, who was again the Prime Minister, where he argued that completing "Salamis" would take too long and that a fleet of torpedo-armed vessels, including submarines, would be preferable. 

Venizelos determined that the cost of completing "Salamis" would be too high, since it would preclude the acquisition of destroyers or a powerful naval air arm. Instead, the two old pre-dreadnoughts "Kilkis" and "Lemnos" would be retained for coastal defense against "Yavuz". This decision was reinforced by the onset of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> that year, which weakened Greece's already limited finances. On 23 April 1932 the arbitrators determined that the Greek government owed AG Vulcan £30,000, and that AG Vulcan would be awarded the hull. The ship was broken up for scrap in <a href="Bremen">Bremen</a> that year. The second Greek dreadnought, "Vasilefs Konstantinos", met a similar fate. As with "Salamis", work on the ship was halted by the outbreak of the war in July 1914, and in the aftermath the Greek government refused to pay for the unfinished ship as well.

Mary: A Fiction

Mary: A Fiction is the only complete <a href="novel">novel</a> by 18th-century British <a href="feminist">feminist</a> <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>. It tells the tragic story of a female's successive "<a href="romantic%20friendship">romantic friendship</a>s" with a woman and a man. Composed while Wollstonecraft was a <a href="governess">governess</a> in Ireland, the novel was published in <a href="1788%20in%20literature">1788</a> shortly after her summary dismissal and her decision to embark on a writing career, a precarious and disreputable profession for women in 18th-century Britain.

Inspired by <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau's</a> idea that geniuses teach themselves, Wollstonecraft chose a rational, self-taught heroine, Mary, as the protagonist. Helping to redefine "<a href="genius%20%28literature%29">genius</a>", a word which at the end of the 18th century was only beginning to take on its modern meaning of exceptional or brilliant, Wollstonecraft describes Mary as independent and capable of defining femininity and marriage for herself. According to Wollstonecraft, it is Mary's "strong, original opinions" and her resistance to "conventional wisdom" that mark her as a genius. Making her heroine a genius allowed Wollstonecraft to criticize marriage as well, as she felt geniuses were "enchained" rather than enriched by marriage.

Through this heroine Wollstonecraft also critiques 18th-century <a href="sensibility">sensibility</a> and its effects on women. "Mary" rewrites the traditional romance plot through its reimagination of gender relations and female sexuality. Yet, because Wollstonecraft employs the genre of <a href="sentimentalism%20%28literature%29">sentimentalism</a> to critique sentimentalism itself, her "fiction", as she labels it, sometimes reflects the same flaws of sentimentalism that she is attempting to expose.

Wollstonecraft later repudiated "Mary", writing that it was laughable. However, scholars have argued that, despite its faults, the novel's representation of an energetic, unconventional, opinionated, rational, female genius (the first of its kind in English literature) within a new kind of romance is an important development in the history of the novel because it helped shape an emerging feminist discourse.

"Mary" begins with a description of the conventional and loveless marriage between the heroine's mother and father. Eliza, Mary's mother, is obsessed with novels, rarely considers anyone but herself, and favours Mary's brother. She neglects her daughter, who educates herself using only books and the natural world. Ignored by her family, Mary devotes much of her time to charity. When her brother suddenly dies, leaving Mary heir to the family's fortune, her mother finally takes an interest in her; she is taught "accomplishments", such as dancing, that will attract suitors. However, Mary's mother soon sickens and requests on her deathbed that Mary wed Charles, a wealthy man she has never met. Stunned and unable to refuse, Mary agrees. Immediately after the ceremony, Charles departs for <a href="Europe">the Continent</a>.

To escape a family who does not share her values, Mary befriends Ann, a local girl who educates her further. Mary becomes quite attached to Ann, who is in the grip of an unrequited love and does not reciprocate Mary's feelings. Ann's family falls into poverty and is on the brink of losing their home, but Mary is able to repay their debts after her marriage to Charles gives her limited control over her money.

Ann becomes <a href="tuberculosis">consumptive</a> and Mary travels with her to Lisbon in hopes of nursing her back to health. There they are introduced to Henry, who is also trying to regain his health. Ann dies and Mary is grief-stricken. Henry and Mary fall in love but are forced to return to England separately. Mary, depressed by her marriage to Charles and bereft of both Ann and Henry, remains unsettled, until she hears that Henry's consumption has worsened. She rushes to his side and cares for him until he dies.

At the end of the novel, Charles returns from Europe; he and Mary establish something of a life together, but Mary is unhealthy and can barely stand to be in the same room with her husband; the last few lines of the novel imply that she will die young.

Wollstonecraft wrote "Mary" at the town of <a href="Hotwells">Hotwells</a> in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> while a <a href="governess">governess</a> for the <a href="Anglo-Irish">Anglo-Irish</a> Kingsborough family. Her relationships with the family provided fodder for the novel, a work that Wollstonecraft herself admitted was "drawn from Nature". Eliza, for example, is partially based on Lady Kingsborough, who Wollstonecraft believed cared more for her dogs than for her children. More importantly, the friendship between Mary and Ann closely resembles the relationship between Wollstonecraft and her intimate companion <a href="Fanny%20Blood">Fanny Blood</a>, who meant "all the world" to her and, as Wollstonecraft's husband <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a> later put it, "for whom she contracted a friendship so fervent, as for years to have constituted the ruling passion of her mind". Wollstonecraft's representation of Fanny as Ann has been called "condescending"; critics have speculated that because Wollstonecraft felt betrayed by Fanny's decision to marry, she depicted Ann as a friend who could never satisfy the heroine.

<a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau's</a> philosophical treatise on education, "" (1762), is one of the major literary influences on "Mary". A few months before starting the work, Wollstonecraft wrote to her sister Everina: "I am now reading Rousseau's Emile, and love his paradoxes ... however he rambles into that "chimerical" world in which I have too often wandered ... He was a strange inconsistent unhappy clever creature—yet he possessed an uncommon portion of sensibility and penetration" (emphasis Wollstonecraft's). Rousseau, she notes, "chuses a "common" capacity to educate—and gives, as a reason, that a genius will educate itself" (emphasis Wollstonecraft's). When "Mary" was published, the title page included a quotation from Rousseau: "L'exercice des plus sublimes vertus éleve et nourrit le génie" ("the exercise of the most sublime virtues raises and nourishes genius"). The novel is therefore, in many ways, an early "<a href="bildungsroman">bildungsroman</a>", or novel of education.

Wollstonecraft's epigrammatic allusion to Rousseau's "<a href="Julie%2C%20or%20the%20New%20Heloise">Julie</a>" (1761) signifies her debt to the novel of sensibility, one of the most popular genres during the last half of the 18th century. Along with other female writers, such as <a href="Mary%20Hays">Mary Hays</a>, <a href="Helen%20Maria%20Williams">Helen Maria Williams</a>, <a href="Charlotte%20Turner%20Smith">Charlotte Turner Smith</a>, <a href="Mary%20Robinson">Mary Robinson</a>, <a href="Maria%20Edgeworth">Maria Edgeworth</a>, and <a href="Hannah%20More">Hannah More</a>, Wollstonecraft felt compelled to respond to the Rousseauvean ideological aesthetic that had come to dominate British fiction. Romantic heroines, Wollstonecraft scholar Gary Kelly writes, "represent woman constructed for man: the heroic feminine victim of the courtly rake and gallant, the virtuous feminine companion of the ideal professionalized gentleman, and the intellectually and erotically subservient companion of the ideal bourgeois man". Wollstonecraft would also attack Rousseau in her best-known work, "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>", because of his sexism in the second part of "Emile". She announces in the "Advertisement" (a section similar to a preface) of "Mary" that she is offering her heroine, who is a "genius", as a contrast to characters such as <a href="Samuel%20Richardson">Samuel Richardson's</a> <a href="Clarissa">Clarissa</a> and Rousseau's . In addition the text is peppered with allusions to popular sentimental novels such as "The History of Eliza Warwick" (1778) and "The Platonic Marriage" (1787), which critique their presentation of the heroine of feminine sensibility. Mary is more akin to the charitable and industrious heroines of <a href="Blue%20Stockings%20Society%20%28England%29">Bluestocking</a> <a href="Sarah%20Scott">Sarah Scott's</a> "<a href="Millenium%26lt%3B%21--%20PLEASE%20NOTE%20that%20%26quot%3BMillenium%26quot%3B%20is%20the%20correct%20spelling%20here.%20--%26gt%3B%20Hall">Millenium Hall</a>" (1762) than to the passive, weepy heroines found in most sentimental novels. Debate concerning the relationship between gender and sensibility continued into the early 19th century; <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a>, for example, made it the explicit focus of her novel "<a href="Sense%20and%20Sensibility">Sense and Sensibility</a>" (1811).

As Wollstonecraft scholar <a href="Virginia%20Sapiro">Virginia Sapiro</a> points out in her description of "Mary", the novel anticipates many of the themes that would come to dominate Wollstonecraft's later writings, such as her concern with the "slavery of marriage" and the absence of any respectable occupations for women. From the beginning of her career, Wollstonecraft was concerned with how <a href="sensibility">sensibility</a> affected women as well as the perception of women in society. All of her works address these topics from one vantage point or another. Connected to this is her analysis of the legitimate and illegitimate foundations for relationships between men and women. Wollstonecraft's "<a href="wikt%3Aoeuvre">oeuvre</a>" is filled with continual reassessments of the definition of femininity and masculinity and the role that sensibility should fill in those definitions. In order to explore these ideas, Wollstonecraft continually turns to herself as an example (all of her works are highly autobiographical, particularly her two novels and the "<a href="Letters%20Written%20in%20Sweden%2C%20Norway%2C%20and%20Denmark">Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</a>" (1796)). As one of Wollstonecraft's first attempts to explore these questions, "Mary" is at times awkward and it occasionally falls short of what Gary Kelly calls the "Revolutionary feminism" of "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" (1792) and "" (1798).

<a href="Claudia%20L.%20Johnson%20%28scholar%29">Claudia Johnson</a> argues that "Mary" is "a bold and dangerous novel", because it presents a new kind of heroine, a "woman who has thinking powers" (in Wollstonecraft's words) who is also capable of having intimate relationships with both men and women. Wollstonecraft attempts to show how a gifted woman can learn to think for herself: through solitary nature walks; by reading philosophical and medical texts; by travelling; and through close friendships. Juxtaposing her new heroine with the traditional <a href="sentimental%20novel">sentimental heroine</a>, Wollstonecraft criticizes the "fatuous" and "insipid" romantic heroine. Eliza, Mary's mother, with her fondness for vacuous novels and lapdogs, embodies this type. Wollstonecraft even pokes fun at readers who expect the book to conform to their romantic expectations and desires:

If my readers would excuse the sportiveness of fancy, and give me credit for genius, I would go on and tell them such tales as would force sweet tears of sensibility to flow in copious showers down beautiful cheeks, to the discomposure of rouge, &c. &c. Nay, I would make it so interesting, that the fair peruser should beg the hair-dresser to settle the curls himself, and not interrupt her.

Mary, however, is depicted as authentic rather than artificial, detesting fashionable life rather than yearning after it. Mary's charitable works, for example, are not a passing fad: they are a heartfelt reaction to social injustice. Even though she is older and intellectual instead of young and pretty, Mary asserts her right to sexual desire rather than sublimating it.

Mary's erotic relationships with both Ann and Henry challenge traditional conceptions of the marriage plot. Most of Mary's positive attributes, such as her rationality, her ability to reject convention, and her sexuality, would have been read in the 18th century as masculine traits. Eliza, Ann, and Henry embody the feminine weakness and passivity, often associated with sentimentality, that Wollstonecraft was criticizing. Although the novel critiques sentimentality, the text appears, in the end, to be unable to resist those very conventions as Mary begins to pine for Henry. Furthermore, the book does not present an alternative way of life for women—it offers only death. Yet, at the same time, the last few lines of the novel hold out the promise of a better world ""where there is neither marrying", nor giving in marriage" (emphasis Wollstonecraft's).

As literary scholar Diane Long Hoeveler has demonstrated, "Mary" is not only a sentimental novel, but, with its emphasis on death, hyperbolic emotion, and persecution, also a <a href="gothic%20novel">gothic novel</a>. Hoeveler identifies in the text what she calls "Gothic feminism", an ideology that values the persecuted heroine above all: it "is not about being equal to men" but rather "about being morally superior to men. It is about being a victim". In other words, Hoeveler argues that the position of victim grants women <a href="moral%20authority">moral authority</a>. In a <a href="Psychoanalytic%20theory">Freudian</a> reading, she focuses on how Mary "displaces and projects her own anger and disappointment" onto other characters, such as Ann and Henry. In this interpretation, Ann and Henry become surrogate parents to Mary; she is "unable to move out of her childish identifications with parental figures, and so she just keeps constructing one parent-substitute after another, never being able to accept the demands and realities required for marriage".

Wollstonecraft's subtitle—"A Fiction"—explicitly rejects a number of popular 18th-century genres, such as the longer "history" or novel ("Mary" is substantially shorter than Richardson's "<a href="Clarissa">Clarissa</a>", for example). In the advertisement, she defends writing a reality-based "fiction" about a female genius:

Without arguing physically about "possibilities"—in a fiction, such a being may be allowed to exist; whose grandeur is drawn from the operations of its own faculties, not subjugated to opinion; but drawn by the individual from the original source. (emphasis Wollstonecraft's)

Through her choice of the subtitle "fiction", Wollstonecraft implies that other genres, such as the novel, restrict the plots available for women; she therefore attempts to invent a new genre, one that offers choice and self-confidence to female characters.

One of the key differences between Wollstonecraft's novels and her philosophical treatises, as <a href="feminist%20literary%20criticism">feminist critic</a> Cora Kaplan has argued, is that her fiction celebrates female emotion and argues for its value while her treatises present emotion as "reactionary and regressive, almost counter-revolutionary". Johnson has extended this argument and contends that Wollstonecraft is interested in presenting the benefits of <a href="romantic%20friendship">romantic friendship</a> over marriage: "whereas Wollstonecraft shrinks from <a href="homosocial">homosocial</a> 'familiarity' and advocates the ennobling properties of domestic heterosexuality in "Rights of Woman", her novels not only resist the heterosexual plot, but displace it with protolesbian narratives wrested from sentimentality itself." While many critics have argued that Mary "capitulates to" or "matures into" both sentimentality and heterosexuality, Johnson's interpretation has become the standard.
Mary's relationship with Ann challenges the definition of friendship; as Johnson explains, it "is no ordinary friendship". Mary looks to Ann, in Wollstonecraft's words, "to experience the pleasure of being beloved". Mary is "coded as masculine (agentive, sublime) while Ann is stereotypically feminine in [her] 'die-away' delicacy". This gendered divide is even reflected in Mary's choice of reading material; she reads books associated with the masculine <a href="sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime</a> such as <a href="Edward%20Young">Edward Young's</a> "<a href="Night%20Thoughts%20%28poem%29">Night Thoughts</a>" (1742–45) and <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton's</a> "<a href="Paradise%20Lost">Paradise Lost</a>" (1667). Although Ann does not feel the love for Mary that Mary does for her, Mary devotedly nurses Ann and is distraught by her death. The unusual intensity of this relationship is revealed in Wollstonecraft's description of Mary's sorrow:

The ladies . . . began to administer some common–place comfort, as, that it was our duty to submit to the will of Heaven, and the like trite consolations, which Mary did not answer; but waving her hand, with an air of impatience, she exclaimed, "I cannot live without her! — I have no other friend; if I lose her, what a desart will the world be to me." "No other friend," re–echoed they, "have you not a husband?"

Mary shrunk back, and was alternately pale and red. A delicate sense of propriety prevented her from replying; and recalled her bewildered reason.
Johnson cautions against labelling Mary and Ann's relationship <a href="lesbian">lesbian</a>, since the identity-defining concepts of heterosexuality and homosexuality did not exist during the 18th century; she maintains, rather, that their relationship is a bond which cannot be articulated through language. This bond is perhaps best described as erotic rather than overtly sexual. Further evidence to support such an interpretation comes from Wollstonecraft's life. Wollstonecraft based her portrait of Ann on her close friend, Fanny Blood, and when her husband, <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a>, came to write his "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20the%20Author%20of%20A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1798), he described Fanny and Wollstonecraft's first meeting as similar to the one between the tortured lovers Charlotte and Werther in <a href="Goethe">Goethe's</a> sentimental novel "<a href="The%20Sorrows%20of%20Young%20Werther">The Sorrows of Young Werther</a>" (1774). One biographer of Wollstonecraft notes that <a href="Hester%20Chapone">Hester Chapone's</a> "<a href="Letters%20on%20the%20Improvement%20of%20the%20Mind">Letters on the Improvement of the Mind</a>", which influenced Wollstonecraft's earlier "<a href="Thoughts%20on%20the%20Education%20of%20Daughters">Thoughts on the Education of Daughters</a>" (1787), dedicates several chapters to these "friends of the heart"; such friendships would not have seemed unusual to 18th-century readers.

After Ann's death, Mary replaces her with Henry; as Johnson writes, "this tale of forbidden and unnarratable passionate friendship becomes a tale of forbidden but narratable adulterous love". Like Ann, Henry is a feminine counterpart to Mary's masculine persona. Mary's relationship with Henry is both erotic and paternal:

[S]he thought of him till she began to chide herself for defrauding the dead, and, determining to grieve for Ann, she dwelt on Henry's misfortune and ill health . . . she thought with rapture that there was one person in the world who had an affection for her, and that person she admired — had a friendship for. He had called her his dear girl . . . My child! His child, what an association of ideas! If I had a father, such a father! — She could not dwell on the thoughts, the wishes which obtruded themselves. Her mind was unhinged, and passion unperceived filled her whole soul.

In Johnson's interpretation, Mary does not replace Ann with a masculine lover as one might expect in a sentimental novel but rather with a "feminine", yet still acceptably male, lover.

In describing her heroine, Wollstonecraft drew on the emerging 18th-century conception of the "<a href="genius%20%28literature%29">genius</a>", a word that was slowly changing meaning from "a peculiar, distinctive, or identifying character or spirit" to "extraordinary intellectual power especially as manifested in creative activity". She offered readers the first representation of a female genius. The masculinity, particularly the "energy and decisiveness", that characterizes Mary is therefore portrayed positively and contrasted with the "passivity and sickliness" of the feminized Ann and Henry. According to Wollstonecraft, it is Mary's "strong, original opinions" and her resistance to "conventional wisdom" that mark her as a genius. Making her heroine a genius allowed Wollstonecraft to criticize marriage as well, as she felt geniuses were "enchained" rather than enriched by marriage.

Strength of mind, by which Wollstonecraft meant "the degree to which [the mind] can "independently" reach its own conclusions" (emphasis in original), is central to her idea of the female genius. Merely imitating others is not enough, even if one imitates the "correct" actions and thoughts. Reason, for Wollstonecraft, is what controls the emotions; without reason, she contends, people would fail to understand their own feelings. Moreover, reason allows for the distinction between a useful <a href="sensibility">sensibility</a> and a harmful sensualism. She writes: "sensibility is indeed the foundation of all our happiness; but these raptures are unknown to the depraved sensualist, who is only moved by what strikes his gross senses." Useful sensibility allows Mary to embark upon charity projects. Yet, this highly attuned sensibility separates the classes along emotional lines: only the middle-class Mary is able to understand what the poor around her require.

Wollstonecraft modelled Mary after herself, even to the point of giving the heroine her own name. Using <a href="free%20indirect%20discourse">free indirect discourse</a>, which blurs the line between the <a href="third-person%20narrative">third-person</a> narrator and the <a href="first-person%20narrative">first-person</a> dialogue of a text, she ties the narrator's voice, which resembles the "Wollstonecraft" of the advertisement, to the heroine. This rhetorical device highlights the autobiographical elements in the story and emphasizes the reality of "the fiction".

Although Wollstonecraft initially felt proud of "Mary", a decade after its publication she no longer believed that the work aptly demonstrated her talents as an author; she wrote to Everina in 1797: "as for my Mary, I consider it as a crude production, and do not very willingly put it in the way of people whose good opinion, as a writer, I wish for; but you may have it to make up the sum of laughter". Wollstonecraft's husband, <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a>, disagreed, however, in his "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20the%20Author%20of%20A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>":

This little work, if Mary had never produced any thing else, would serve, with persons of true taste and sensibility, to establish the eminence of her genius. The story is nothing. He that looks into the book only for incident, will probably lay it down with disgust. But the feelings are of the truest and most exquisite class; every circumstance is adorned with that species of imagination, which enlists itself under the banners of delicacy and sentiment.

Most scholars agree with Wollstonecraft's assessment of her writing. Nevertheless, they still believe that the novel is important because it attempts to depict a liberated and reasoning female genius. As feminist scholar Mitzi Myers argues, "in her focus on the subjective vision and internal life of her heroine, in her reliance on emotional nuance rather than plot, Wollstonecraft both transforms the traditions of late eighteenth-century sentimental fiction for feminist purposes and anticipates twentieth-century trends in the novel of feminine consciousness." "Mary" helped initiate a tradition that would blossom in novels such as <a href="Charlotte%20Bront%C3%AB">Charlotte Brontë's</a> "<a href="Jane%20Eyre">Jane Eyre</a>" (1847) and "<a href="Villette%20%28novel%29">Villette</a>" (1853).

Published by <a href="Joseph%20Johnson%20%28publisher%29">Joseph Johnson</a>, "Mary" itself was moderately successful, and sections of it were included in several collections of sentimental extracts that were popular at the time, such as "The Young Gentleman and Lady's Instructor" (1809). However, Johnson was still trying to sell copies of it in the 1790s and consistently listed it in the advertisements for her other works. It was not reprinted until the 1970s, when scholars became interested in Wollstonecraft and women's writing more generally.
