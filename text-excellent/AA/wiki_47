Fighting in ice hockey

Fighting in ice hockey is an established tradition of <a href="Ice%20hockey">the sport</a> in North America, with a long history that involves many levels of <a href="amateur%20sports">amateur</a> and <a href="Professional%20sports">professional</a> play and includes some notable individual fights. Fighting is usually performed by <a href="Enforcer%20%28ice%20hockey%29">enforcers</a>, or "goons"—players whose role is to fight and intimidate—on a given team, and is governed by a complex system of unwritten rules that players, <a href="Coach%20%28ice%20hockey%29">coaches</a>, <a href="Official%20%28ice%20hockey%29">officials</a>, and the media refer to as "the code". Some fights are spontaneous, while others are premeditated by the participants. While officials tolerate fighting during hockey games, they impose a variety of <a href="Penalty%20%28ice%20hockey%29">penalties</a> on players who engage in fights.

Unique among North American professional team sports, the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) and most minor professional leagues in North America do not <a href="ejection%20%28sports%29">eject</a> players outright for fighting (although they may do so for more flagrant violations as part of a fight) but major European and <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">collegiate hockey leagues</a> do, and multi-game suspensions may be added on top of the ejection. Therefore, the vast majority of fights occur in the NHL and other North American professional leagues.

Physical play in hockey, consisting of allowed techniques such as <a href="Checking%20%28ice%20hockey%29">checking</a> and prohibited techniques such as <a href="elbowing">elbowing</a>, <a href="high-sticking">high-sticking</a>, and <a href="Cross-checking%20%28hockey%29">cross-checking</a>, is linked to fighting. Although often a target of criticism, it is a considerable draw for the sport, and some fans attend games primarily to see fights. Those who defend fighting in hockey say that it helps deter other types of rough play, allows teams to protect their star players, and creates a sense of solidarity among teammates. The debate over allowing fighting in ice hockey games is ongoing. Despite its potentially negative consequences, such as heavier enforcers (or "heavyweights") knocking each other out, administrators at the professional level have no plans to eliminate fighting from the game, as most players consider it essential. Most fans and players oppose eliminating fights from professional hockey games, but considerable opposition to fighting exists and efforts to eliminate it continue.

Fighting has been a part of ice hockey since the sport's rise in popularity in 19th century Canada. There are a number of theories behind the integration of fighting into the game; the most common is that the relative lack of rules in the early history of hockey encouraged physical intimidation and control. Other theories include the poverty and high crime rates of local Canada in the 19th century. The implementation of some features, such as the <a href="Hockey%20rink">blue lines</a> in 1918, actually encouraged fighting due to the increased level of physical play. Creation of the blue lines allowed forward passing, but only in the neutral zone. Therefore, puck handlers played at close quarters and were subject to a great deal of physical play. The emergence of enforcers, who protected the puck handlers and fought when necessary, followed shortly thereafter.

In 1922, the NHL introduced Rule 56, which formally regulated fighting, or "<a href="Bare-knuckle%20boxing">fisticuffs</a>" as it was called in the official NHL rulebook. Rather than ejecting players from the game, as was the practice in amateur and collegiate hockey, players would be given a <a href="Penalty%20%28ice%20hockey%29%23Types%20of%20penalties">five-minute major penalty</a>. Rule 56 and its language also filtered down to the minor professional and junior leagues in North America. Promoters such as <a href="Tex%20Rickard">Tex Rickard</a> of <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden%20%281925%29">Madison Square Garden</a>, who also promoted <a href="boxing">boxing</a> events, saw financial opportunities in hockey fights and devised marketing campaigns around the rivalries between various team enforcers.

In the current NHL rulebook, the archaic reference to "fisticuffs" has been removed; fighting is now governed under Rule 46 in the NHL rulebook. Referees are given considerable latitude in determining what exactly constitutes a fight and what penalties are applicable to the participants. Significant modifications from the original rule involve penalties which can be assessed to a fight participant deemed to have instigated the fight and additional penalties resulting from instigating a fight while wearing a face-shield.

Although fighting was rarer from the 1920s through the 1960s, it was often brutal in nature; author Ross Bernstein said of the game's early years that it "was probably more like <a href="Rugby%20football">rugby</a> on skates than it was modern hockey." Star players were also known to fight for themselves during the <a href="Original%20Six">Original Six</a> era, when fewer teams existed than in later years. However, as the <a href="1967%20NHL%20expansion">NHL's expansion</a> in the late 1960s created more roster spots and spread star players more widely throughout the league, enforcers (who usually possess limited overall skill sets) became more common. Multiple fights during the era received significant media attention. In an NHL preseason game between the <a href="Boston%20Bruin">Boston Bruin</a>s and <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a> in 1969, Bruins defenceman <a href="Ted%20Green">Ted Green</a> and Blues left wing <a href="Wayne%20Maki">Wayne Maki</a>, attacking Green, engaged in a bloody stick-swinging fight that resulted in Green sustaining a skull fracture. In 1978, <a href="World%20Hockey%20Association">World Hockey Association</a> <a href="Birmingham%20Bulls">Birmingham Bulls</a> enforcer <a href="Dave%20Hanson%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Dave Hanson</a>, known for his 11-year professional career, fought <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Famer</a> <a href="Bobby%20Hull">Bobby Hull</a> and in the process got Hull's wig caught in his knuckles. The incident landed Hanson in the news, and irate Winnipeg fans attempted to assault him on his way out of the arena. Hanson appeared in the 1977 movie "<a href="Slap%20Shot%20%28film%29">Slap Shot</a>", a comedy about hockey violence.

The rise of the "" in the <a href="1973-74%20NHL%20season">1973–74</a> and <a href="1974-75%20NHL%20season">1974–75</a> <a href="Philadelphia%20Flyers">Philadelphia Flyers</a> served as an example for future NHL enforcers. The average number of fights per game rose above 1.0 during the 1980s, peaking at 1.17 in 1983–84. That season, a bench-clearing brawl broke out at the end of the second period of a second-round playoff matchup between the <a href="Quebec%20Nordiques">Quebec Nordiques</a> and the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>. A second bench-clearing brawl erupted before the third period began, provoked by the announcement of penalties; a total of 252 penalty minutes were incurred and 11 players were ejected. This game is commonly referred to as the "<a href="Good%20Friday%20Massacre">Good Friday Massacre</a>".

Many teams signed enforcers to protect and fight for smaller offensive stars. Fights in the 1990s included the <a href="Red%20Wings%20%E2%80%93%20Avalanche%20brawl">Brawl in Hockeytown</a> in 1997, in which the <a href="Colorado%20Avalanche">Colorado Avalanche</a> and <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a> engaged in nine fights, including bouts between Darren McCarty and <a href="Claude%20Lemieux">Claude Lemieux</a> and <a href="Goaltender">goalies</a> <a href="Patrick%20Roy">Patrick Roy</a> and <a href="Mike%20Vernon%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Mike Vernon</a>. The following year, a game between the Avalanche and Red Wings involved a fight between goaltenders <a href="Chris%20Osgood">Chris Osgood</a> and Roy after which they received minor, major, and game misconduct penalties. In 2004, a Philadelphia Flyers – <a href="Ottawa%20Senators">Ottawa Senators</a> <a href="Flyers%E2%80%93Senators%20brawl">game</a> resulted in five consecutive brawls in the closing minutes of the game, including fights between many players who are not known as enforcers and a fight between Flyers goalie <a href="Robert%20Esche">Robert Esche</a> and Senators goalie <a href="Patrick%20Lalime">Patrick Lalime</a>. The game ended with an NHL record 419 penalty minutes, and an NHL record 20 players were ejected, leaving five players on the team benches. The officials took 90 minutes to sort out the penalties that each team had received.

By 2009–10, the number of fights in the NHL declined to .58 per game. A further decrease in the frequency of fighting happened over the next five seasons. The 2014–15 season had 0.32 fights per game, as teams placed a greater emphasis on skating ability and fewer young players became enforcers.

Since the 1970s, three rules have curtailed the number and scope of fights in the NHL. In 1971, the league created the "Third Man In" rule which attempts to eliminate the <a href="bench-clearing%20brawl">bench-clearing brawl</a> by providing for the ejection of the first player who joins a fight already in progress, unless a match penalty is being assessed to a player already engaged in that fight. Another rule automatically suspends the first player from each team that leaves the bench to join a fight when it is not their shift. In 1992, the "Instigator" rule, which adds an additional two-minute minor penalty to the player who starts a fight, was introduced.

Rules of the NHL, the North American junior leagues, and other North American professional minor leagues punish fighting with a five-minute major penalty. What separates these leagues from other major North American sports leagues is that they do not eject players simply for participating in a fight. However, fighting is frequently punishable by ejection in European leagues and in Olympic competition.

The rulebooks of the NHL and other professional leagues contain specific rules for fighting. These rules state that at the initiation of a fight, both players must definitely drop their sticks so as not to use them as a weapon. Players must also "drop" or shake off their protective gloves to fight bare-knuckled, as the hard leather and plastic of hockey gloves would increase the effect of landed blows. Players should not remove their own helmet before engaging in a fight due to risk of head injury or else both of the opposing players get an extra two penalty minutes. Players must also heed a referee warning to end a fight once the opponents have been separated. Failure to adhere to any of these rules results in an immediate game misconduct penalty and the possibility of fines and suspension from future games. In the NHL, when a player is fined, his lost pay goes towards the NHL emergency assistance fund. A fined coach's lost pay goes to the NHL Foundation.

In the NHL, <a href="American%20Hockey%20League">American Hockey League</a> (AHL), <a href="ECHL">ECHL</a>, <a href="Southern%20Professional%20Hockey%20League">Southern Professional Hockey League</a>, and other notable minor leagues, officials punish combatants with five-minute major penalties for fighting (hence the phrase "five for fighting"). A player is automatically ejected and suspended if the player tries to leave the bench to join a fight, or for using weapons of any kind (such as using a skate to kick an opponent, using a stick to hit an opponent, wrapping tape around one's hands, or spitting), as they can cause serious injury. A player who receives two instigator penalties or participates in three fights in a single game is also ejected automatically. Furthermore, his coach can be suspended up to ten games for allowing players to leave the bench to join a fight.

A player who commits three major penalties (including fighting) during a game is automatically ejected, suspended, and fined. A player ejected for three major penalties in a game, or for use of weapons, cannot be replaced for five minutes. In 2003, the ECHL added an ejection, fine, and suspension of an additional game for any player charged as an instigator of a fight during the final five minutes of the third period or any overtime. The NHL and AHL adopted the rule in 2005–06, and the NHL includes a fine against the ejected player's head coach.

In Division I and Division III <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA) hockey, the fighters are given a Game Disqualification, which is an ejection from the game and a suspension for as many games as the player has accrued Game Disqualifications during the course of a season. For example, if a player engages in a fight having already received a Game Disqualification earlier in the season, he is ejected from that game and suspended for his team's next two games. This automatic suspension has made fighting in college hockey relatively rare.

Fighting is strictly prohibited in European professional hockey leagues and in <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%20Olympic%20Games">Olympic ice hockey</a>. The international rules (by the <a href="International%20Ice%20Hockey%20Federation">International Ice Hockey Federation</a> (IIHF)) specify in rule 141 – "Fighting" the following penalties (among others):

Despite the bans, there have been fights in European leagues. In 2001, a game between the <a href="Nottingham%20Panthers">Nottingham Panthers</a> and the <a href="Sheffield%20Steelers">Sheffield Steelers</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> <a href="Ice%20Hockey%20Superleague">Superleague</a> saw "some of the worst scenes of violence seen at a British ice hockey rink". When Sheffield enforcer <a href="Dennis%20Vial">Dennis Vial</a> crosschecked Nottingham forward Greg Hadden, Panthers enforcer <a href="Barry%20Nieckar">Barry Nieckar</a> subsequently fought with Vial, which eventually escalated into a 36-man <a href="Bench-clearing%20brawl">bench-clearing brawl</a>. Referee Moray Hanson sent both teams to their locker rooms and delayed the game for 45 minutes while tempers cooled and the officials sorted out the penalties. Eight players and both coaches were ejected, and a British record total of 404 penalty minutes were incurred during the second period. The league handed out 30 games in suspensions to four players and Steelers' coach Mike Blaisdell and a total of £8,400 in fines. Russia's <a href="Kontinental%20Hockey%20League">Kontinental Hockey League</a> (KHL) had a bench-clearing brawl between <a href="Vityaz%20Chekhov">Vityaz Chekhov</a> and <a href="Avangard%20Omsk">Avangard Omsk</a> in 2010. Officials were forced to abandon the game as there were only four players left. Thirty-three players and both teams' coaches were ejected, and a world record total of 707 penalty minutes were incurred during the game. The KHL imposed fines totaling 5.7 million rubles ($191,000), suspended seven players, and counted the game as a 5–0 defeat for both teams, with no points being awarded.

The <a href="Punch-up%20in%20Piestany">Punch-up in Piestany</a> was a notable instance of fighting in international play. A 1987 <a href="World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">World Junior Ice Hockey Championships</a> game between Canada and the Soviet Union was the scene of a bench-clearing brawl that lasted 20 minutes and prompted officials to turn off the arena lights in an attempt to stop it, forcing the IIHF to declare the game null and void. The fighting was particularly dangerous as fighting was a surprise and a custom unknown to the Soviet players, some of whom escalated the fighting beyond what was considered acceptable in North America. Both teams were ejected from the tournament, costing Canada an assured medal, and the Soviet team was barred from the end-of-tournament dinner.

The role of "enforcer" on a hockey team is unofficial. Enforcers occasionally play regular shifts like other players, but their primary role is deterring opposing players from rough play. Coaches often send enforcers out when opposing enforcers are on the ice or any time when it is necessary to check excessively physical play by the opposing team. Enforcers, particularly those with questionable playing skills, can be colloquially referred to as goons (a term also occasionally used for a related position, the <a href="pest%20%28ice%20hockey%29">pest</a>, who may not fight but will agitate an opponent with rough play and goad the opponent into a fight).

There are many reasons for fights during a hockey game. Some reasons are related to game play, such as retaliation, momentum-building, intimidation, deterrence, attempting to draw "reaction penalties", and protecting star players. There are also some personal reasons such as retribution for past incidents, bad blood between players, and simple job security for enforcers. Fights often start in response to an opponent's rough play.

Of the many reasons for fighting, the foremost is retaliation. When players engage in play that members of the opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between the assailant and the victim, between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim's team, or between opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games. Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a <a href="Power%20play%20%28sporting%20term%29">power play</a> due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.

Enforcers sometimes start fights to build game momentum and provide a psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition. This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd. For that reason, it can also be a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.

Intimidation is an important element of a hockey game and some enforcers start fights just to intimidate opposing players in hopes that they will refrain from agitating skilled players. For example, in the late 1950s, <a href="Gordie%20Howe">Gordie Howe</a> helped establish himself as an enforcer by defeating <a href="Lou%20Fontinato">Lou Fontinato</a>, a notable tough guy who tallied over 1,200 penalty minutes in his career. Fontinato suffered a broken nose from the fight. After that incident, Howe got a lot more space on the ice and was able to score many goals over the span of his career because he intimidated other players. Conversely, games in European professional leagues are known to be less violent than North American games because fighting is discouraged in Europe by ejection and heavy fines. Since the penalties for fighting are so severe, the enforcers are less able to intimidate opposing players with fighting and said players take more liberties on the ice.

For teams that face each other frequently, players may fight just to send the message to the opposing players that they will be the target of agitation or aggression in future games. Teams that are losing by a considerable margin often start these fights near the end of the game when they have nothing to lose. Enforcers may start fights with more skilled players to draw what is called a "reaction penalty", an undisciplined reaction to aggressive play on the part of the enforcer. This practice is also known to be difficult due to the Instigator rule.

Another reason is the protection of star players. Fighting within the game can also send a message to players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players will not be tolerated and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is sometimes seen as a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by <a href="Dave%20Semenko">Dave Semenko</a>, <a href="Marty%20McSorley">Marty McSorley</a>, and others, and <a href="Brett%20Hull">Brett Hull</a>, who was protected by <a href="Kelly%20Chase">Kelly Chase</a> and others. Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.

Many young enforcers need to establish their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs. Due to the <a href="Farm%20team">farm systems</a> that most professional hockey leagues use, enforcers who get a chance to play at the level above their current one (for example, an AHL player getting a chance to play in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and fans that they are worthy of the enforcer role on the team. Players and coaches enjoy being with enforcers who fight for their teams, not for themselves.

There are also times when players and even entire teams carry on personal rivalries that have little to do with individual games; fights frequently occur for no other reason. A rivalry that produced many fights was between the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League%20rivalries%23Colorado%20Avalanche%20vs.%20Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings and the Colorado Avalanche during the 1990s</a>.

Statistics indicate that fights are detrimental to teams' play, or have inconsequential benefits. Since the 1979–80 season, teams in the bottom three of fighting-related major penalties have finished at the top of the regular-season standings 10 times and have won the Stanley Cup 11 times, while teams in the top three have won the regular season and Stanley Cup only twice each. One statistical analysis calculated that winning a fight benefited a team by about 1/80th of a win in the standings. Two others showed that fights increase scoring, but do so evenly for both teams so do not significantly affect wins.

The Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine announced in "Position Statement" in 1988 that "Fighting does cause injuries, which range from fractures of the hands and face to lacerations and eye injuries. At present, it is an endemic and ritualized blot on the reputation of the North American game."

Criticism often arises after single acts of violence committed during fights. For example, on March 21, 2007, <a href="Colton%20Orr">Colton Orr</a> of the <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a> fought with <a href="Todd%20Fedoruk">Todd Fedoruk</a> of the Philadelphia Flyers and ended up knocking Fedoruk <a href="Unconsciousness">unconscious</a>. Fedoruk already had titanium plates in his face from a fight earlier in the season with <a href="Derek%20Boogaard">Derek Boogaard</a>. The resulting media coverage of the incident renewed calls for a fighting ban. Some players acknowledge that there is no harm in discussing the issue; however, most players and administrators continue to insist that fighting stay as a permanent element of organized ice hockey. Some league administrators, such as former NHL senior vice-president and director of hockey operations <a href="Colin%20Campbell%20%28ice%20hockey%20executive%29">Colin Campbell</a>, have been circulating the idea of banning fighting in response to incidents such as the Fedoruk–Orr fight.

Sports journalists have articulated the idea with increasing frequency that fighting adds nothing to the sport and should be banned. Among the reasons they cite are that it is unsportsmanlike, is a "knee-jerk" reaction that detracts from the skillful aspects of the game, and that it is simply a waste of time. The "Journal of Sport and Social Issues"' Ryan T. Lewinson and Oscar E. Palma believe that fighting shows a lack of discipline on the part of participants, as well as a lack of fairness in certain cases, including when fighters have a size disparity. However, supporters of fighting say it provides a means of security for players, that fighting is a tool players use to keep opposing players in check; essentially allowing players to police which hits and dirty plays are unacceptable.

Various politicians and hockey figures have expressed opposition to fighting. In 2012, <a href="David%20Johnston">David Johnston</a>, the <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General of Canada</a>, said that fighting should not be part of the sport. IIHF president <a href="Rene%20Fasel">Rene Fasel</a> has protested against fighting, deeming it "<a href="Neanderthal">Neanderthal</a> behavior." <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a>, considered by many to be the greatest hockey player of all time, has often spoken out against fisticuffs, although he expressed support for fighting in 2004.

NHL Commissioner <a href="Gary%20Bettman">Gary Bettman</a>, at a 2007 press conference broadcast on CBC Sports, said, "Fighting has always had a role in the game ... from a player safety standpoint, what happens in fighting is something we need to look at just as we need to look at hits to the head. But we're not looking to have a debate on whether fighting is good or bad or should be part of the game."

Community members often become involved in the debate over banning fighting. In December 2006, a <a href="school%20board">school board</a> trustee in <a href="London%2C%20Ontario">London, Ontario</a> attended a <a href="London%20Knights">London Knights</a> game and was shocked by the fighting and by the crowd's positive reaction to it. This experience led him to organize an ongoing effort to ban fighting in the <a href="Ontario%20Hockey%20League">Ontario Hockey League</a>, where the Knights compete, by attempting to gain the support of other school boards and by writing letters to OHL administrators. On the advice of its <a href="Medical%20Health%20Officer">Medical Health Officer</a>, the Middlesex-London Health board has supported recommendations to ban fighting across amateur hockey and to increase disciplinary measures to ensure deterrence.

The first known death directly related to a hockey fight occurred when Don Sanderson of the <a href="Whitby%20Dunlops">Whitby Dunlops</a>, a top-tier senior amateur team in Ontario's <a href="Major%20League%20Hockey">Major League Hockey</a>, died in January 2009, a month after sustaining a head injury during a fight: Sanderson's helmet came off during the fight, and when he fell to the ice, he hit his head. His death renewed calls to ban fighting among critics. In reaction, the league has stated that they are reviewing the players' use of helmets.

Fighters such as <a href="Bob%20Probert">Bob Probert</a> and Boogaard have been posthumously diagnosed with <a href="chronic%20traumatic%20encephalopathy">chronic traumatic encephalopathy</a>, a <a href="degenerative%20disease">degenerative disease</a> of the brain caused by repeated brain trauma. While the NHL took steps to limit head trauma from blindslide hits, it was criticized for doing nothing to reduce fighting, which consists of repeated deliberate blows to the head. It is unknown if Boogaard's death was mainly attributed from his repeated head trauma from fighting and hits or from a possible addiction to painkillers while simultaneously abusing alcohol. His brain has been sent to Boston University for further testing.

Beginning in the 2016–17 season, the American Hockey League imposed a fighting major counter, similar to the <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a>'s unsportsmanlike technical foul counter and soccer's accumulated cards. A player who collects ten major penalties for fighting during the season will be suspended one game, and will be suspended one game for each fighting major for the next three penalties (the 11th, 12th, and 13th fighting majors). A player is suspended two games for his 14th and subsequent major penalty for fighting. If one player involved in the fight is charged with an instigator penalty, the opponent will not have the fighting major count towards suspension.

There are several informal rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously. The most important aspect of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must agree to a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.

Enforcers typically only fight each other, with only the occasional spontaneous fight breaking out between one or two opponents who do not usually fight. There is a high degree of respect among enforcers as well; they will respect a rival who declines a fight because he is playing with injuries, a frequent occurrence, because enforcers consider winning a fight with an injured opponent to be an empty victory. This is also known as granting a "free pass". Enforcer <a href="Darren%20McCarty">Darren McCarty</a> described fighters as being divided into "heavyweights" and "light heavyweights", and said that players in the former category "end up dancing with some guys who could end (their) career with a single punch."

Long-standing rivalries result in numerous rematches, especially if one of the enforcers has to decline an invitation to fight during a given game. This is one of the reasons that enforcers may fight at the beginning of a game, when nothing obvious has happened to agitate the opponents. On the other hand, it is bad etiquette to try to initiate a fight with an enforcer who is near the end of his shift, since the more rested player will have an obvious advantage.

Another important aspect of etiquette is simply fighting fairly and cleanly. Fairness is maintained by not wearing equipment that could injure the opposing fighter, such as face shields, gloves, or masks, and not assaulting referees or linesmen. Finally, whatever the outcome of the fight, etiquette dictates that players who choose to fight win and lose those fights gracefully. Otherwise, they risk losing the respect of their teammates and fans.

Sportsmanship is also an important aspect when it comes to fights. While an enforcer may start a fight in response to foul play, it is generally not acceptable to start a fight to retaliate against an opponent who scored fairly.

Fighting tactics are governed by several actual rules and enforcers will also adopt informal tactics particular to their style and personality. One tactic adopted by players is known as "going for it", in which the player puts his head down and just throws as many punches as he can, as fast as he can. In the process, that player takes as many punches as he delivers, although some of them are to the hard forehead. Fighters usually must keep one hand on their opponent's jersey since the ice surface makes maintaining balance very difficult. For this reason, the majority of a hockey fight consists of the players holding on with one hand and punching with the other.

Other examples include Gordie Howe's tactic of holding the sweater of his opponent right around the armpit of his preferred punching arm so as to impede his movement. Probert, of the <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a> and <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a>, was known to allow his opponents to punch until they showed signs of tiring, at which time he would take over and usually dominate the fight. Some consider long-time <a href="Buffalo%20Sabres">Buffalo Sabres</a> enforcer <a href="Rob%20Ray">Rob Ray</a> to be the reason that hockey jerseys are now equipped with tie-down straps ("fight straps") that prevent their removal; he would always remove his jersey during fights so his opponents would have nothing to grab on to. This is commonly referred to as the "Rob Ray Rule".

Throughout a game, the referee and linesmen have a role in preventing fights through the way they are managing the game—calling penalties, breaking up scuffles before they escalate, etc. Despite an official's best efforts, though, fights do occur and once they do, the referee and linesmen have a certain set of responsibilities to follow in order to safely break up the fight. None of these responsibilities are written in the NHL's rule book, but often are guided by "common sense", according to officials.
In a single fight situation the linesmen will communicate with each other as to which player they will take during the fight, clear out any sticks, gloves, or other equipment that has been dropped and wait for a safe time to enter the fight, which they will do together. If both players are still standing while the linesmen enter, the linesmen will approach from each side (never from behind), bring their arms over the combatants' arms and wrap them around, pushing downwards and breaking the players apart. If the players have fallen, the linesmen will approach from the side (never over the skates), getting in between the two players. One linesman will use his body to shield the player on the bottom from the other player while his partner will remove the top player from the fight. Most linesmen will allow a fight to run its course for their own safety, but will enter a fight regardless if one player has gained a significant advantage over his opponent. Once the players have been broken up, the linesmen then escort the players off the ice. During this time the referee will keep other players from entering the fight by sending them to a neutral area on the ice and then watching the fight and assessing any other penalties that occur.

In a multiple fight situation the linesmen will normally break up fights together, one fight at a time using the same procedures for a single fight. The linesmen will communicate with each other which fight to break up. In a multiple fight situation the referee will stand in an area of the ice where he/she can have a full view of all the players and will write down—on a pad of paper commonly known as a "riot pad"—the numbers of the players that are involved in the fights, watching for situations that warrant additional penalties, such as players removing opponents' helmets, players participating in a second fight, players leaving a bench to participate in a fight, or third players into a fight. The referee will not normally break up a fight unless the linesmen need assistance, or a fight is occurring where a player has gained a significant advantage over the other player, leading to concerns of significant injury.

Are You Experienced

Are You Experienced is the debut studio album by English-American <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="the%20Jimi%20Hendrix%20Experience">the Jimi Hendrix Experience</a>. Released in 1967, the LP was an immediate critical and commercial success, and it is widely regarded as one of the greatest debuts in the history of rock music. The album features <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>'s innovative approach to songwriting and electric guitar playing which soon established a new direction in <a href="Psychedelic%20music">psychedelic</a> and <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> music.

By mid-1966, Hendrix was struggling to earn a living playing the <a href="Rhythm%20and%20blues">R&B</a> circuit as a backing guitarist. After being referred to <a href="Chas%20Chandler">Chas Chandler</a>, who was leaving <a href="the%20Animals">the Animals</a> and interested in managing and producing artists, Hendrix was signed to a management and production contract with Chandler and ex-Animals manager <a href="Michael%20Jeffery%20%28manager%29">Michael Jeffery</a>. Chandler brought Hendrix to London and began recruiting members for a band, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, designed to showcase the guitarist's talents. In late October, after having been rejected by <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca Records</a>, the Experience signed with <a href="Track%20Records">Track</a>, a new label formed by <a href="the%20Who">the Who</a>'s managers <a href="Kit%20Lambert">Kit Lambert</a> and <a href="Chris%20Stamp">Chris Stamp</a>.

"Are You Experienced" and its preceding singles were recorded over a five-month period from late October 1966 through early April 1967. The album was completed in 16 recording sessions at three London locations, including <a href="De%20Lane%20Lea%20Studios">De Lane Lea Studios</a>, CBS Studios, and <a href="Olympic%20Studios">Olympic Studios</a>. Released in the UK on May 12, 1967, "Are You Experienced" spent 33 weeks on the charts, peaking at number two. The album was issued in the US on August 23 by <a href="Reprise%20Records">Reprise Records</a>, where it reached number five on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" Top LPs</a>, remaining on the chart for 106 weeks, 27 of those in the Top 40. The album also spent 70 weeks on the US <a href="Top%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Albums">"Billboard" Hot R&B LPs</a> chart, where it peaked at number 10. The US version contained some of Hendrix's best known songs, including the Experience's first three singles, which, though omitted from the British edition of the LP, were top ten hits in the UK: "<a href="Purple%20Haze">Purple Haze</a>", "<a href="Hey%20Joe">Hey Joe</a>", and "<a href="The%20Wind%20Cries%20Mary">The Wind Cries Mary</a>".

In 2005, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" ranked "Are You Experienced" 15th on its list of the <a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>. The magazine placed four songs from the album on their list of the <a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a>: "Purple Haze" (17), "<a href="Foxy%20Lady">Foxy Lady</a>" (153), "Hey Joe" (201), and "The Wind Cries Mary" (379). That same year, the record was one of 50 recordings chosen by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> in recognition of its cultural significance to be added to the <a href="National%20Recording%20Registry">National Recording Registry</a>. Writer and archivist Reuben Jackson of the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> wrote: "it's still a landmark recording because it is of the rock, R&B, <a href="blues">blues</a> ... musical tradition. It altered the syntax of the music ... in a way I compare to <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>'s "<a href="Ulysses%20%28novel%29">Ulysses</a>"."

By May 1966, <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> was struggling to earn a living playing the <a href="Rhythm%20and%20blues">R&B</a> circuit as a back-up guitarist. During a performance at one of New York City's most popular nightspots, the Cheetah Club, he was noticed by <a href="Linda%20Keith%20%28model%29">Linda Keith</a>, the girlfriend of <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">Rolling Stones</a> guitarist <a href="Keith%20Richards">Keith Richards</a>. Shortly after, Hendrix relocated to the city's <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a> and began a residency at the <a href="Cafe%20Wha%3F">Cafe Wha?</a> fronting his own band, <a href="Jimmy%20James%20and%20the%20Blue%20Flames">Jimmy James and the Blue Flames</a>. Keith recommended Hendrix to Stones manager <a href="Andrew%20Loog%20Oldham">Andrew Loog Oldham</a> and producer <a href="Seymour%20Stein">Seymour Stein</a>. They failed to see Hendrix's musical potential, and rejected him. She then referred him to <a href="Chas%20Chandler">Chas Chandler</a>, who was leaving <a href="The%20Animals">The Animals</a> and interested in managing and producing artists. Chandler liked the <a href="Billy%20Roberts">Billy Roberts</a> song "Hey Joe", and was convinced he could create a hit single with the right artist. Impressed with Hendrix's live version of the song with his band, he brought him to London on September 24, 1966, and signed him to a management and production contract with himself and ex-Animals manager <a href="Michael%20Jeffery%20%28manager%29">Michael Jeffery</a>.

Immediately following Hendrix's arrival in London, Chandler began recruiting members for a band, <a href="the%20Jimi%20Hendrix%20Experience">the Jimi Hendrix Experience</a>, designed to showcase the guitarist's talents. Hendrix met the guitarist <a href="Noel%20Redding">Noel Redding</a> at an audition for the New Animals, where Redding's knowledge of <a href="blues">blues</a> <a href="Chord%20progression">progressions</a> impressed Hendrix. Chandler asked Redding if he wanted to play bass guitar in Hendrix's band; Redding agreed. Chandler then began looking for a drummer and soon after, he contacted <a href="Mitch%20Mitchell">Mitch Mitchell</a> through a mutual friend. Mitchell, who had recently been fired from <a href="Georgie%20Fame%20and%20the%20Blue%20Flames">Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames</a>, participated in a rehearsal with Redding and Hendrix where they bonded over their shared interest in rhythm and blues. When Chandler phoned Mitchell later that day to offer him the position, he readily accepted. In late October, after having been rejected by <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca Records</a>, the Experience signed with <a href="Track%20Records">Track</a>, a new label formed by <a href="the%20Who">the Who</a>'s managers <a href="Kit%20Lambert">Kit Lambert</a> and <a href="Chris%20Stamp">Chris Stamp</a>.

"Are You Experienced" and its preceding singles were recorded over a five-month period from late October 1966 through early April 1967. The album was completed in 16 recording sessions at three London locations, including <a href="De%20Lane%20Lea%20Studios">De Lane Lea Studios</a>, CBS, and <a href="Olympic%20Studios">Olympic</a>. Chandler booked many of the sessions at Olympic because the facility was acoustically superior and equipped with most of the latest technology, though it was still using <a href="Multitrack%20recording">four-track</a> recorders, whereas American studios were using eight-track.

Chandler's budget was limited, so in an effort to reduce expenditures he and Hendrix completed much of the album's pre-production work at their shared apartment. From the start, Chandler intentionally minimized the creative input of Mitchell and Redding. He later explained: "I wasn't concerned that Mitch or Noel might feel that they weren't having enough—or any—say ... I had been touring and recording in a band for years, and I'd seen everything end as a compromise. Nobody ended up doing what they really wanted to do. I was not going to let that happen with Jimi." When the Experience began studio rehearsals, Hendrix already had the chord sequences and tempos worked out for Mitchell, and Chandler would direct Redding's bass parts.
Chandler and the Experience found time to record between performances in Europe. They began on October 23, recording "Hey Joe" at De Lane Lea Studios, with Chandler as producer and Dave Siddle as engineer. The song featured backing vocals by <a href="the%20Breakaways">the Breakaways</a>. Soon after the session began, Chandler asked Hendrix to turn his guitar amplifier down, and an argument ensued. Chandler commented: "Jimi threw a tantrum because I wouldn't let him play guitar loud enough ... He was playing a <a href="Marshall%20Amplification%23Birth%20of%20the%20Bluesbreaker%2C%20the%20Plexi%2C%20and%20the%20Marshall%20stack">Marshall twin stack</a>, and it was so loud in the studio that we were picking up various rattles and noises." According to Chandler, Hendrix then threatened to leave England, stating: "If I can't play as loud as I want, I might as well go back to New York." Chandler, who had Hendrix's immigration papers and passport in his back pocket, laid the documents on the mixing console and told Hendrix to "piss off". Hendrix laughed and said: "All right, you called my bluff", and they got back to work. Redding wrote in his diary that they completed two songs during the October 23 session, but the second one has never been positively identified. Author Sean Egan speculated that it might have been <a href="Howlin%27%20Wolf">Howlin' Wolf</a>'s "<a href="Killing%20Floor%20%28Howlin%27%20Wolf%20song%29">Killing Floor</a>" or <a href="Wilson%20Pickett">Wilson Pickett</a>'s "<a href="Land%20of%20a%20Thousand%20Dances">Land of a Thousand Dances</a>". Chandler decided that they should use an Experience original for the <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">B-side</a> of the single, so he encouraged Hendrix to start writing; he composed his first Experience song, "<a href="Stone%20Free">Stone Free</a>", the following day. Chandler, in an effort to minimize studio expenses, purchased rehearsal time at the Aberbach House in London. He abandoned this practice after realizing how quickly the group could learn songs while warming up in the studio. On November 2, 1966, the Experience returned to De Lane Lea to continue work on their first single. During the session, they recorded "Stone Free" and a <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demo version</a> of "Can You See Me". This marked the first time that the Experience recorded a song that was eventually included on the original UK release of the album.

Chandler had been dissatisfied with the sound quality at De Lane Lea, so he took the advice of Kit Lambert and booked time at CBS Studios. On December 13, 1966, after taking a five-week break from recording while they performed in Europe, the Experience reconvened at CBS. Assisted by engineer Mike Ross, the band were especially productive during the session, recording instrumentation and vocals for "<a href="Foxy%20Lady">Foxy Lady</a>" and basic instrumental tracks for "Love or Confusion", "Can You See Me", and "<a href="Third%20Stone%20from%20the%20Sun">Third Stone from the Sun</a>". Ross recalled the impact of Hendrix's Marshall stacks: "It was so loud you couldn't stand in the studio ... I'd never heard anything like it in my life." When Ross asked Hendrix where he would like the microphone placed Hendrix replied: "Oh, man, just put a mic about twelve feet away on the other side of the studio. It'll sound great." Ross agreed, and with a Neumann U87 tube mic he recorded Hendrix's guitar playing in a large room that, according to Ross, "was absolutely vital to the uniquely powerful Experience sound." Ross noted that input from Mitchell and Redding was minimized, and he asserted that Chandler was clearly "the one in charge" of the sessions. The band played together live at CBS; the lead and backup vocals were overdubbed. Despite his dwindling finances, Chandler encouraged the Experience to record numerous takes of a song, affording them the luxury of repeated attempts at a satisfactory recording. With a live instrument track as the foundation of the recordings, they eschewed the common practice of piecing together parts of several takes to make one continuous piece. After the December 13 recording session, the band made their television debut, on Britain's "<a href="Ready%20Steady%20Go%21">Ready Steady Go!</a>"

On December 15, 1966, finishing touches were made on the four rhythm tracks that were recorded the previous session. Although Chandler enjoyed working at CBS and he appreciated the high quality of the recordings they made there, he ended his professional connection with the studio after a disagreement between him and owner Jake Levy over his failure to make payment. Chandler had planned to pay Levy for the sessions after the album was completed, but Levy demanded payment upfront. Chandler viewed this as an unreasonable expectation, and he vowed that he would never again do business with CBS. The fifth and final song recorded there was "<a href="Red%20House%20%28song%29">Red House</a>". As <a href="stereophonic%20sound">stereophonic sound</a> was not yet popular among music fans, these recordings were all <a href="monaural">monaural</a> mixes; Ross explained: "back then ... mono was "king". All the effort went into the mono." He estimated that they spent no more than 30 minutes mixing any one track.

The first Experience single, with "Hey Joe" as the A-side and "Stone Free" as the B-side, was released in the UK on December 16, 1966. Track Records was not yet operational, so their distributor, <a href="Polydor%20Records">Polydor Records</a>, issued the single with their logo. It reached number six on the UK chart in early 1967. On December 21, 1966, Chandler and the Experience returned to De Lane Lea with Dave Siddle as engineer. They recorded two alternate versions of "Red House" and began work on "Remember"; both tracks were significantly re-worked in April 1967 at Olympic Studios.

After a three-week break from recording while they played gigs in England, including a December 29 appearance on "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Pops">Top of the Pops</a>", the Experience reconvened at De Lane Lea on January 11, 1967. As "Hey Joe" was gaining chart momentum in the UK, they began working on their second single, which featured Hendrix's second songwriting effort, "Purple Haze", as its A-side. The track presented a more complex arrangement than the band's previous recordings, and required four hours of studio time to complete, which Chandler considered extravagant. The session was the first time that he and the group had experimented with guitar effects. Acoustic engineer <a href="Roger%20Mayer%20%28engineer%29">Roger Mayer</a> introduced Hendrix to the <a href="Octavia%20%28effects%20pedal%29">Octavia</a>, an octave-doubling effect pedal, in December 1966, and he first recorded with the effect during the guitar solo of "Purple Haze". When Track Records sent the master tapes for "Purple Haze" to Reprise for remastering, they wrote on the tape box: "Deliberate distortion. Do not correct."

On January 11, 1967, the Experience worked on their third A-side, "The Wind Cries Mary", a song that marked their first use of <a href="overdubbing">overdubbing</a> in lieu of retakes as a method of achieving a satisfactory track. Chandler explained: "There were five guitar overdubs all linking in together to sound like one guitar." The song, which Redding and Mitchell had not yet heard before that day, was completed during the session. Chandler had decided that they should discard the rough version of "Third Stone from the Sun" from December 13 and re-record the song; they completed a basic track for the piece, but were unable to achieve a finished master. The group managed to produce an acceptable live recording of the basic track for "<a href="Fire%20%28The%20Jimi%20Hendrix%20Experience%20song%29">Fire</a>" after seven takes. Next, they attempted Hendrix's newly written ballad, "<a href="The%20Wind%20Cries%20Mary">The Wind Cries Mary</a>". Without the benefit of rehearsals, the band recorded the song in one take, to which Hendrix added several guitar overdubs; Chandler estimated that they spent approximately 20 minutes on the completed rhythm track. According to Chandler, by this time Redding and Mitchell had begun to complain about their limited input. Chandler explained that financial considerations influenced the creative dynamic: "[They] were sort of fighting the fact that they had no say during recording sessions ... they were starting to come up with suggestions, but ... We didn't need to be arguing with Noel for ten minutes and Mitch for five ... We just couldn't afford the time."

Between January 12 and February 2, 1967, the Experience took a break from recording while they played 20 dates in England, including a second appearance on "Top of the Pops", on January 18. Chandler was dissatisfied with the sound quality of the January 11 recordings and frustrated by the large number of noise complaints that they had received from people living and working near De Lane Lea. He explained: "There was a bank above the studio ... and it was at the time when computers were just coming in ... we would play so loud that it would foul up the computers upstairs." <a href="Brian%20Jones">Brian Jones</a> and <a href="Bill%20Wyman">Bill Wyman</a> of the Rolling Stones encouraged Chandler to try Olympic Studios, which was considered the top independent London studio. Despite the growing chart success of their first single, Chandler's money problems persisted. Olympic required advance payment for studio time, but Polydor had not yet released any funds to Track for disbursement. When Chandler went to Polydor asking for relief they responded by guaranteeing him a line of credit at Olympic.

With his budget concerns alleviated, Chandler booked time at Olympic, where on February 3, 1967, he and the Experience met sound engineer <a href="Eddie%20Kramer">Eddie Kramer</a>. During Kramer's first session with the group, he deviated from the standard recording method that they had been using at CBS and De Lane Lea, which was to record bass and drums in mono on two tracks. He instead recorded Mitchell's drums on two tracks in stereo, leaving the remaining two tracks available for Redding's bass and rhythm guitar parts played by Hendrix. Kramer's unorthodox approach, which was inspired by Hendrix's complaints regarding the limitations of four-track recordings, captured the live sound of the band using all four available tracks. Kramer and Chandler then <a href="Ping-pong%20recording">pre-mixed and reduced</a> the first four tracks down to two, making two more tracks available for lead guitar overdubs and vocals. This method satisfied both Hendrix's perfectionism and Chandler's desire to reduce the number of takes required for a satisfactory rhythm track, thus minimizing their expenses. Another change instigated by Kramer was the use of a mixture of close and distant microphone placements when recording Hendrix's guitar parts whereas, during previous sessions, the microphones had been placed about twelve feet away from Hendrix's amplifiers. In addition to the usual choices, Kramer used Beyer M1 60 <a href="ribbon%20microphone">ribbon microphone</a>s, which were typically not used to record loud music.

During the February 3, 1967, session at Olympic, the Experience improved the January 11 master tape of "Purple Haze" by re-recording the vocal and lead guitar parts, and adding another Octavia guitar overdub, which was sped-up and <a href="Panning%20%28audio%29">panned</a> at the end of the song. The group reconvened at Olympic on February 7, continuing their work on "Purple Haze" by recording Hendrix's rhythm guitar and vocal parts, as well as Redding's <a href="Backing%20vocalist">background vocals</a>. They spent time overdubbing ambient background sounds by playing tapes through a set of headphones that were held near a microphone, creating an echo effect as the headphones were moved closer; they completed a final mix of "Purple Haze" the following day. During the session, they worked on the De Lane Lea master tape of "Fire", replacing everything except Redding's bass line, which he <a href="Double%20tracking">double-tracked</a> in an effort to accentuate the recording's lower frequencies. Kramer placed the second bass line on a dedicated track and blended Redding's original bass line with Mitchell's newly recorded drum part. They also recorded Mitchell and Redding's backing vocals. "Foxy Lady" was also reworked on February 8; Redding recorded a new bass line and Hendrix and Mitchell added overdubs to their existing parts. After recording backing vocals by Redding and lead vocals from Hendrix, Kramer prepared the song's final mix.

Hendrix was not as confident a singer as he was a guitarist, and because he strongly disliked anyone watching him sing he asked the engineers at Olympic to construct a privacy barrier between him and the control room. This created problems when the studio lights were low, and the engineers were unable to see him, making his visual cues and prompts difficult to communicate. As was the case at De Lane Lea, Hendrix's penchant for using multiple amplifiers at extreme volume drew criticism and complaints from the people living and working near to the studio. Olympic tape operator George Chkiantz recalled: "Sometimes, it got so loud we'd turn the [control booth] monitors off and there was really very little difference." Chkiantz noted that reactions to Hendrix's music were not always positive: "I seem to recall a lot of musicians, a lot of people, saying, 'I can't see what all the fuss is about myself', or 'I don't know how you listen to all that noise; I'd be scared to work with him' ... Chas was convinced that he was on to something. Not everyone was convinced that Chas was right." Another issue that complicated the sessions were the large number of female fans who would show up at the studio wanting to watch the Experience record. As a habit, Hendrix would indiscriminately tell people where they would be on any given day, which led to large groups of fans following him everywhere. Olympic employees were tasked with keeping them under control and at a safe distance so as to not unduly burden the recording process. Chkiantz commented: "It was extraordinary. I worked with <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">the Stones</a>. I worked with <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>. I worked with <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>. I was not as jumpy; it was not as difficult as with Hendrix. It was something of an open house. Hendrix was not difficult at all, but I personally would have preferred not to have loads of girls lurking in the woodwork."

On February 20, 1967, the Experience continued working on "Are You Experienced", but scheduling conflicts at Olympic led Chandler to book time at De Lane Lea. During the session they recorded "<a href="I%20Don%27t%20Live%20Today">I Don't Live Today</a>", which featured a manual <a href="wah%20wah%20pedal">wah effect</a> that predated the pedal unit. They managed to complete a working master by the end of the day, though Hendrix eventually recorded a new lead vocal at Olympic.

The Experience took a week break from recording while playing gigs in England, and returned to De Lane Lea on March 1, 1967, to attempt a studio recording of <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>'s "<a href="Like%20a%20Rolling%20Stone">Like a Rolling Stone</a>". Although the song had long been a staple of the group's live show, they failed to achieve an acceptable basic track, owing mostly to Mitchell's inability to keep consistent time during the session.

The second Experience single, "Purple Haze"/"51st Anniversary", was released on March 1. It entered the UK singles chart on the 23rd, peaking at number three. During that month, the band took another long break from recording while they played gigs in Belgium, Germany, and the UK, including appearances on the UK television show "<a href="Simon%20Dee%23BBC">Dee Time</a>" and the <a href="BBC%20radio">BBC radio</a> show "<a href="Saturday%20Club%20%28BBC%20radio%29">Saturday Club</a>". Scheduling conflicts at Olympic led Chandler to book a March 29 session at De Lane Lea. On this date the band worked on another newly written Hendrix composition, "<a href="Manic%20Depression%20%28song%29">Manic Depression</a>"; they finished a rough mix by the end of the session that was later rejected in favor of a re-mix completed at Olympic. On April 3, the Experience returned to Olympic, adding overdubs and completing final mixes on several unfinished masters. During the eight-hour session, the band recorded three new songs, including "Highway Chile", "<a href="May%20This%20Be%20Love">May This Be Love</a>", and "<a href="Are%20You%20Experienced%20%28song%29">Are You Experienced?</a>". As the album's title track featured <a href="Backmasking">backwards</a> rhythm guitar, bass, and drums, replication of the beat caused Mitchell some consternation when attempting the song live. Chandler completed final mixes for "I Don't Live Today", "Are You Experienced?", and "May This Be Love" before the end of a session that Kramer described as "very organized."

In an effort to free up space for Hendrix's lead vocals, further reduction mixing was completed for "Are You Experienced?" during a session at Olympic on April 4, 1967. With the title track complete, the Experience shifted their focus to the January 11 rough demo of "Third Stone from the Sun". Chandler decided that they should discard the original De Lane Lea tape and record a new version of the song. During the session, Kramer prepared a reduction mix of "Highway Chile", which made two tracks available for Hendrix's lead guitar and vocal overdubs. Though stereo and mono mixes were completed for the song, Chandler preferred the mono version, which he paired with "The Wind Cries Mary" for release as the group's third UK single. A reduction mix was prepared for "Love or Confusion", and Hendrix took advantage of the newly vacant tracks by adding lead guitar and vocals. A final mix was completed before the end of the session. On April 5, Chandler participated in a <a href="Audio%20mastering">mastering session</a> at Rye Muse Studios for "Highway Chile" and "The Wind Cries Mary", during which preparations were made so that Track could begin manufacturing <a href="Gramophone%20record">vinyls</a>. On the 10th, he and the Experience returned to Olympic, spending the bulk of the session on editing dialogue segments for "Third Stone from the Sun", which were then slowed down and mixed into the song. Kramer concentrated his efforts on the song's complicated mix: "The song was like a watercolor painting ... each track was composed of four, fairly dense composite images."

After the April 10, 1967, recording session, the Experience spent the next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program "<a href="Monday%20Monday%20%28TV%20series%29">Monday Monday</a>" and <a href="BBC2">BBC2</a>'s "<a href="Late%20Night%20Line-Up">Late Night Line-Up</a>". Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of "Are You Experienced" at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor's head of <a href="Artists%20and%20repertoire">A&R</a>, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after a few hours of sleep he prepared a suitable vinyl demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a cold sweat, thinking ... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats to take me away ... Horst played the first side through and didn't say a word. Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about how I was going to talk my way out of this. At the end of the second side, he just sat there. Finally, he said, 'This is brilliant. This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.'" Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.

According to Hendrix biographer <a href="Harry%20Shapiro%20%28author%29">Harry Shapiro</a>, the music on "Are You Experienced" incorporates a variety of <a href="music%20genre">music genre</a>s from <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">rhythm and blues</a> to <a href="free%20jazz">free jazz</a>; author Peter Doggett noted its "wide variety of styles", while journalist <a href="Chris%20Welch">Chris Welch</a> said "each track has a different personality". Musicologist <a href="Gilbert%20Chase">Gilbert Chase</a> asserted that the album "marked a high peak in <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a>", and music critic <a href="Jim%20DeRogatis">Jim DeRogatis</a> characterized the LP and its preceding singles as "raw, focused <a href="psychedelic%20rock">psychedelic rock</a>". A contemporary review published in "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" in October 1967 identified the influence of <a href="soul%20music">soul music</a> on the Experience and the album. In 1989, "<a href="Hit%20Parader">Hit Parader</a>" magazine ranked it number 35 in a list of the top 100 heavy metal albums. In 2006, writer and archivist Reuben Jackson of the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> wrote: "it's still a landmark recording because it is of the <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a>, R&B, blues ... musical tradition. It altered the syntax of the music ... in a way I compare to, say, <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>'s "<a href="Ulysses%20%28novel%29">Ulysses</a>"."

Included on the UK edition of "Are You Experienced" were two tracks that represented the music Hendrix had played in the US before the formation of the Experience: the blues track "Red House" and the rhythm and blues song "Remember". The album's <a href="Psychedelia">psychedelic</a> title track, which author Sean Egan described as <a href="Impressionism%20in%20music">impressionistic</a>, featured the post-modern soundscapes of backwards guitar and drums that pre-date <a href="scratching">scratching</a> by 10 years. Musicologist Ritchie Unterberger considers the lyrics to "I Don't Live Today" to be more at home in a <a href="gothic%20rock">gothic rock</a> setting than in psychedelia, however; he describes the music as being "played and sung with an ebullience that belies the darkness of the lyrics." The song's tribal rhythms served as a platform for Hendrix's innovative <a href="guitar%20feedback">guitar feedback</a> improvisations. Whereas "Fire" is a <a href="funk">funk</a> and soul hybrid driven by Mitchell's drumming, "May This Be Love" and "The Wind Cries Mary" are soft ballads that demonstrate Hendrix's ability to write thoughtful lyrics and subtle melodies. The influence of <a href="raga%20rock">raga rock</a> can be heard in his <a href="sitar">sitar</a>-like guitar solo on "Love or Confusion". "Can You See Me" is an uptempo rocker that features Hendrix's double tracked vocals and his use of a one-note bend in the style of <a href="Hank%20Marvin">Hank Marvin</a>. Although "Hey Joe" is a <a href="Folk%20music">folk song</a>, and the only <a href="Cover%20version">cover</a> on the album, it would become one of Hendrix's most requested tracks.

The UK edition of "Are You Experienced" opened with "Foxy Lady", a track that, with the exception of a few overdubs, was recorded in one session at CBS. Hendrix wrote the song about Heather Taylor, a London socialite who later married the Who's <a href="Roger%20Daltrey">Roger Daltrey</a>. It begins with the <a href="Fade%20%28audio%20engineering%29">fade-in</a> of an <a href="F%20%28musical%20note%29">F note</a> that Hendrix is <a href="Bent%20note">bending-up</a> to <a href="F%E2%99%AF%20%28musical%20note%29">F</a> while applying generous <a href="finger%20vibrato">finger vibrato</a>. Using his guitar's control knob, he slowly increases volume until an <a href="audio%20feedback">audio feedback</a> loop develops and he <a href="Slide%20%28guitar%20technique%29">slides</a> into the song's dominant Fm7 chord. Hendrix used a combination of natural amplifier <a href="Distortion%20%28music%29">overdrive and fuzz box</a> <a href="effects%20unit">effects unit</a>s to create the song's razor-sharp guitar tone. Its blues–inspired solo—his fourth since arriving in England—used <a href="pentatonic%20scale">pentatonic scale</a>s while showcasing his innovative approach to <a href="melody">melody</a>; by exploiting the increased <a href="sustain">sustain</a> created by overdriving his amplifiers, he moved seamlessly between the middle and high <a href="Register%20%28music%29">registers</a> with a fluid, singing tone. Author Peter Doggett compared its slow beat to <a href="Memphis%20soul">Memphis soul</a>; David Stubbs described the track as a prototype for <a href="Heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> bands such as <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>.

Although the lyrics to "Purple Haze", which opened the US edition of "Are You Experienced", are often misinterpreted as describing an <a href="Psychedelic%20experience">acid trip</a>, Hendrix explained: "[It] was all about a dream I had that I was walking under the sea." He speculated that the dream may have been inspired by a science fiction story about a purple death ray. Redding stated that Hendrix had not yet taken <a href="Lysergic%20acid%20diethylamide">LSD</a> at the time of the song's writing, which was after a gig in London on December 26, 1966. The first draft of the lyrics was exceedingly long, so Chandler and Hendrix reduced its length to something appropriate for mainstream pop music. It opens with a guitar/bass harmony in the interval of a <a href="tritone">tritone</a> that was known as the "diabolus in musica" during the time of the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a>. The Catholic Church prohibited medieval composers of <a href="religious%20music">religious music</a> from using the tritone, or flattened fifth, because as musicologist Dave Whitehill wrote: "to play it was like ringing Satan's doorbell." In the opinion of the author <a href="Ritchie%20Unterberger">Ritchie Unterberger</a>, the opening riff has "become a permanent part of rock's vocabulary." Whereas "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" described the song as the beginning of late-1960s psychedelia, the authors Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek identified Hendrix's use of R&B, funk, and soul elements in the track.

In 1967, Hendrix told the journalist Keith Altham that "Third Stone from the Sun" is about a visiting space alien who, upon evaluation of the human species, decides that people are not fit to rule Earth, destroys their civilization, and places the planet in the care of chickens. The song is composed of two contrasting sections, one that features a <a href="jazz">jazz</a>y guitar melody played in the style of <a href="Wes%20Montgomery">Wes Montgomery</a> over a straightforward rock tempo, and another that showcases Hendrix's free-form <a href="mixolydian%20mode">mixolydian mode</a> guitar lines with a jazz beat. The track contains no proper vocals, instead using spoken words played at half-speed to invoke images of interstellar space travel. In addition to jazz elements, Unterberger identified Hendrix's use of <a href="surf%20music">surf music</a> motifs in the track that are reminiscent of earlier works by <a href="the%20Ventures">the Ventures</a>, a group from the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> that Hendrix would have heard during his childhood.

Hendrix described "Manic Depression" as "ugly times music"; during a live performance he explained the meaning of the lyrics: "It's a story about a cat wishing he could make love to music instead of the same old everyday woman." The song is unusual in that its written in <a href="triple%20metre">triple meter</a>, or 3/4 time, which is the time signature commonly associated with a <a href="waltz">waltz</a>; most rock music is written in 4/4. Although his delivery is rock oriented, Mitchell's drumming on the track is reminiscent of <a href="Elvin%20Jones">Elvin Jones</a>'s fluid jazz patterns. Musicologist Andy Aledort noted Hendrix's "dramatic use of <a href="chromaticism">chromaticism</a>" during the song's opening bars and the "heavily <a href="vibrato">vibrato</a>ed unison bends" that presage what he described as one of Hendrix's best guitar solos.

"The Wind Cries Mary" is the first ballad recorded by the Experience; Hendrix wrote the lyrics after an argument with his girlfriend, <a href="Kathy%20Etchingham">Kathy Etchingham</a>, whose middle name is Mary. She explained: "I smashed plates on the floor, [and] he swept them up. He locked me in the bathroom for absolutely ages and ... eventually Chas's girlfriend Lotta let me out ... I ran out to get a taxi and was standing under the traffic lights, and I had red hair and a red dress. I went back after I'd cooled down and he'd already written it." The song featured a chord progression inspired by <a href="Curtis%20Mayfield">Curtis Mayfield</a> and lyrics that reflected Hendrix's admiration of Bob Dylan. "Stone Free" expressed Hendrix's desire to preserve his personal freedom, demurring the concepts of conformity and long-term relationships. He revisited this theme in "51st Anniversary" and "Highway Chile". Omitted from the American version of the album, "Red House" did not see an official release in the US until the 1969 compilation "<a href="Smash%20Hits%20%28The%20Jimi%20Hendrix%20Experience%20album%29">Smash Hits</a>". An unusual feature of the recording is that it does not include a bass guitar track; Redding instead played rhythm guitar with his equalization set strongly in favor of bass tones. It is Hendrix's only original <a href="twelve-bar%20blues">twelve-bar blues</a>.

Chris Stamp designed the cover of the UK version of "Are You Experienced", which featured a picture of Hendrix, Mitchell, and Redding by <a href="Bruce%20Fleming%20%28photographer%29">Bruce Fleming</a>. The image shows Hendrix wearing a long dark cape while standing over Mitchell and Redding, striking what Egan described as a "Dracula-esque pose". Chandler contacted Fleming based on the photographer's previous work with <a href="the%20Hollies">the Hollies</a>, <a href="the%20Dave%20Clark%20Five">the Dave Clark Five</a>, and the Animals. The photo shoot took place in February after Fleming had attended several recording sessions and Experience gigs. Chandler made a point of requesting that the band member's faces be clearly visible in the photograph; Fleming explained: "[Album covers] got much more esoteric as time went on, but to establish the artist we had to get their faces across so the kids would recognize them." He took <a href="monochrome">monochrome</a> and color shots of the band; Track selected an image from the latter group. Fleming had indicated which picture he preferred they use, marking the shot with a cross, but after the album's release he realized that they had selected another, less desirable image. According to Fleming, the shot that he chose was "more sinister; more interesting". Stamp hired graphic artist Alan Aldridge to design the sleeve's psychedelic lettering. Track inexplicably put only the album's title on the cover, omitting the band's name; Polydor issued the release throughout Europe with Hendrix's name printed at the top in matching font. The cover art's combination of dull green and brown tones, juxtaposed with the jocular nature of the subject's pose, created a weak overall visual impression; Stamp commented: "It's not a great cover at all. Hopefully, we made up for that in all the other covers."

Hendrix disliked the UK cover of "Are You Experienced", so arrangements were made for a photo shoot with graphic designer <a href="Karl%20Ferris">Karl Ferris</a>. Hendrix wanted "something psychedelic", so he requested Ferris because he appreciated the photographer's sleeve-work on the Hollies' June 1967 release "<a href="Evolution%20%28The%20Hollies%20album%29">Evolution</a>". During a meeting with the band, Ferris told Hendrix that he wanted to hear more of their music from which to draw inspiration. They accommodated his request by allowing him to attend several sessions for their second album, "". Ferris brought home tapes from the sessions, which along with "Are You Experienced" he listened to intently. His first impression of the music was that it was "so far out that it seemed to come from outer space", which inspired him to develop a backstory about a "group travelling through space in a Biosphere on their way to bring their unworldly space music to earth." With this concept in mind, he took color photographs of the band at <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Kew">Kew Gardens</a> in London, using a <a href="fisheye%20lens">fisheye lens</a> which was then popular in <a href="Mod%20%28subculture%29">Mod sub-culture</a>. Ferris used what Egan described as "an infrared technique of his own invention which combined color reversal with heat signature", further enhancing the exotic nature of the image. Ferris was an experienced fashion photographer, and his interest in the finer details of his covers led him to choose the band's wardrobe. After seeing Hendrix with his hair combed away from the scalp, Ferris requested that he wear it that way during the photo shoot. Hendrix's girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham, trimmed his hair to improve its symmetry, forming an <a href="afro">afro</a> that became the basis of a homogenized Experience image. Redding and Mitchell liked Hendrix's new hairstyle, so Ferris hired a hairdresser to style their hair in a similar fashion. After purchasing clothing for Redding and Mitchell at the boutiques on <a href="King%27s%20Road">King's Road</a>—Hendrix wore clothes from his wardrobe, including a psychedelic jacket with a pair of eyes printed on the front which had been given to him by a fan—the Experience travelled to Kew Gardens. In an effort to focus on Hendrix's hands, Ferris shot the band at a low angle. The daylight faded soon after their arrival at the garden, so they returned the following day for a second shoot, which was not needed; the image selected for the US cover of "Are You Experienced" was the first shot taken the previous day. Ferris chose the cover's yellow background and its surreal lettering, and he intended for a textured gatefold jacket that Reprise, as a cost-saving measure, did not approve.

The third Experience single, "The Wind Cries Mary" backed by "Highway Chile", was released in the UK on May 5, 1967, while "Purple Haze" occupied the number three spot in the charts. The management's decision to release the single while the previous one was still present in the UK charts was unorthodox, as was the choice of "The Wind Cries Mary", which differed greatly from "Purple Haze". Stamp recalled: "We did that on purpose ... We wanted musically to show who this person was." Egan wrote: "It alerted the public to the fact that the so-called Wild Man of Borneo was capable of songs of delicacy and sensitivity." "The Wind Cries Mary" reached number six in the UK in May.

Track Records released "Are You Experienced" in the UK on May 12, 1967. It entered the charts on May 27, where it spent 33 weeks, peaking at number two. It remained in the charts long enough that it was still present when the Experience released their second album, "". The album, which was released in the UK without the first three singles, was prevented from reaching the top spot by the Beatles' "<a href="Sgt.%20Pepper%27s%20Lonely%20Hearts%20Club%20Band">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>".

In France and the <a href="Benelux">Benelux</a> countries, Hendrix's recordings were released by <a href="Barclay%20Records">Barclay Records</a> in a distribution deal secured by Jeffery.

Although popular in Europe at the time, the Experience's first US single, "Hey Joe", failed to reach the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> chart upon its release on May 1, 1967. The group's fortunes improved when <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> recommended them to the organizers of the <a href="Monterey%20Pop%20Festival">Monterey Pop Festival</a>. He insisted that the event would be incomplete without Hendrix, whom he called "an absolute ace on the guitar", and he agreed to join the board of organizers on the condition that the Experience perform at the festival in mid-June. During the climax of the festival, which was filmed by <a href="D.%20A.%20Pennebaker">D. A. Pennebaker</a> for the documentary "<a href="Monterey%20Pop">Monterey Pop</a>", Hendrix burned and smashed his guitar on stage for dramatic effect.

After the show-stealing performance, <a href="Reprise%20Records">Reprise Records</a> agreed to distribute "Are You Experienced". However, despite the increased awareness that the Experience's performance at Monterey provided, the second Experience single, "Purple Haze" / "The Wind Cries Mary", released in the US on August 16, 1967, stalled at number 65 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. Although the single performed poorly in the US charts, its presence on underground <a href="FM%20broadcasting">FM radio stations</a>, which were transitioning from <a href="easy%20listening">easy listening</a> and <a href="classical%20music">classical music</a> <a href="Radio%20format">formats</a> to album cuts, significantly aided sales of the LP. Reprise allocated a $20,000 promotional budget for the LP, which was an unprecedented amount for an unproven artist. Released in the US on August 23 by Reprise, "Are You Experienced" reached number five on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. The album remained on "Billboard"s album chart for 106 weeks, 27 of those in the Top 40. The North American edition of "Are You Experienced" featured a new cover by <a href="Karl%20Ferris">Karl Ferris</a> and a new track list, with Reprise omitting "Red House", "Remember", and "Can You See Me", and including the first three A-sides omitted from the UK release: "Hey Joe", "Purple Haze", and "The Wind Cries Mary".

"Are You Experienced" was an immediate commercial success, selling more than one million copies within seven months of its release. Reviewing the album in 1967, "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" praised its artistic integrity and the Experience's varied use of <a href="tempo">tempo</a>. "<a href="NME">NME</a>" Keith Altham said it is "a brave effort by Hendrix to produce a musical form which is original and exciting". However, not all contemporary writers gave the LP a favorable review; in November 1967, "Rolling Stone" Jon Landau wrote that although he considered Hendrix a "great guitarist and a brilliant arranger", he disapproved of his singing and songwriting. He criticized the quality of the material and described the lyrics as inane: "Above all this record is unrelentingly violent, and lyrically, inartistically violent at that."

Many music critics have since named "Are You Experienced" as one of the greatest rock and roll debut albums. Journalist Ritchie Unterberger described it as "one of the definitive albums of the psychedelic era." Author Chris Smith said the release was "a landmark in a summer of landmark albums". Noe Goldwasser, the founding editor of "<a href="Guitar%20World">Guitar World</a>" magazine, called it "a veritable textbook of what a musician can do with his instrument" and "the measure by which everything ... in rock and roll has been compared since." According to music journalist <a href="Charles%20Shaar%20Murray">Charles Shaar Murray</a>, the album "completely changed notions of what a guitar could sound like, or indeed, what music could sound like", while "<a href="The%20Miami%20Herald">The Miami Herald</a>" credited "Are You Experienced" with introducing <a href="acid%20rock">acid rock</a>, <a href="classic%20rock">classic rock</a>, and the guitar aesthetic of <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a>. Critic <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> called it a "bombshell debut" in his review for "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" and said its songs were innovative for how they utilized three-minute pop structures as a medium for Hendrix's unprecedentedly heavy and turbulent guitar and loud, powerful <a href="hook%20%28music%29">hooks</a>, which greatly appealed to young listeners.

"Rolling Stone" includes the album and several songs on various "best of" lists, such as:
Additionally, "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>" magazine listed "Are You Experienced" as the greatest guitar album of all time (2003). In 2005, "Are You Experienced" was one of 50 recordings chosen by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> to be added to the <a href="National%20Recording%20Registry">National Recording Registry</a>, which selects recordings annually that are "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". The album was also included in "A Basic Record Library" of 1950s and 1960s recordings—published in "" (1981)—and in the book "<a href="1001%20Albums%20You%20Must%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</a>".

Since the first release of "Are You Experienced" in 1967, there have been six different track listings. Since 1997, <a href="compact%20disc">compact disc</a> editions in the US and UK feature 17 tracks, including all songs that appeared on either the original UK/international edition of the album or the original North American edition, as well as the Experience's first three singles ("Stone Free", "51st Anniversary", and "Highway Chile").

"Are You Experienced" was first issued on the <a href="Compact%20Disc%20Digital%20Audio">Compact Disc Digital Audio</a> or CD format in 1985 by <a href="Polydor%20Records">Polydor Records</a> (Track's successor) in Europe and Reprise in the US. These early CDs essentially copied the original <a href="LP%20record">LP record</a> albums and used the same tracks, sequencing, and cover art as their 1967 counterparts. Both were reissued with minor changes in 1989–1991 and the Reprise release CD sleeve included "Digital re-mastering by <a href="Joe%20Gastwirt">Joe Gastwirt</a>, assisted by Dave Mitson using the <a href="Sonic%20Solutions">Sonic Solutions</a> <a href="NoNoise">NoNoise</a> System, under the supervision of Are You Experienced? Ltd."

In 1993, <a href="Alan%20Douglas%20%28record%20producer%29">Alan Douglas</a>, who managed Hendrix's recording catalogue, reached an agreement with <a href="MCA%20Records">MCA Records</a> for the future releases of Hendrix material. He also announced plans for new reissues of the three Experience albums: "Everything in the present catalogue is a budget release... They're all 25-year-old packages. I want to take it high-level... with all these new elements". Along with new artwork and liner notes, the MCA reissue was remastered with only one track selection and order for both the European and America markets. The 17-track CD included the first three Experience British singles (both A-sides and B-sides), followed by the 11 songs as they appeared on the Track/Polydor UK album release.

The 1993 Douglas reissues were short-lived; in 1997, his tenure as the overseer of Hendrix's catalogue was taken over by Experience Hendrix (the Hendrix family-controlled company). By April 1997, a new reissue was released, which restored the original artwork and sequencing for both the US and UK releases. However, both reissues included an additional six extra tracks, which provided the same 17 tracks (all the original singles and album tracks) in the UK and US, although in a different order. Since 1997, these have been the official authorized CD versions of the original albums. In 2010, <a href="Sony%20Music%20Entertainment">Sony's</a> <a href="Legacy%20Recordings">Legacy Recordings</a> became the exclusive distributor for the recordings managed by Experience Hendrix.

Be Here Now (album)

Be Here Now is the third studio album by English <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="Oasis%20%28band%29">Oasis</a>, released on 21 August 1997 by <a href="Creation%20Records">Creation Records</a>. Oasis had achieved worldwide success with their 1994 debut album "<a href="Definitely%20Maybe">Definitely Maybe</a>" and 1995 follow up "<a href="%28What%27s%20the%20Story%29%20Morning%20Glory%3F">(What's the Story) Morning Glory?</a>" The third album was highly anticipated by both fans and music critics. Oasis' management company, Ignition, were aware of the dangers of overexposure, and before release sought to control the media's access to the album. The campaign included limiting pre-release radio airplay and forcing journalists to sign <a href="gag%20order">gag order</a>s. The tactics resulted in the alienation of both the press and many industry personnel connected with the band, and fueled large-scale speculation and wide publicity within the British music scene.

On the first day of release, "Be Here Now" sold over 424,000 copies, becoming the fastest-selling album in British chart history, while initial reviews were overwhelmingly positive. The album's producer <a href="Owen%20Morris">Owen Morris</a> said the recording sessions were marred by arguments and drug abuse, and that the band's only motivations were commercial. As of 2008, the album had sold eight million copies worldwide. It was the biggest selling album of 1997 in the UK with 1.47 million units sold that year.

By the summer of 1996, Oasis were widely considered, according to guitarist <a href="Noel%20Gallagher">Noel Gallagher</a>, "the biggest band in the world ... bigger than, dare I say it, fucking God." The commercial success of the band's two previous albums had resulted in media frenzy and an ubiquity in the mainstream press that was in danger of leading to a backlash. In the summer of 1997, Oasis members were being invited to functions at <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">10 Downing Street</a> by new Prime Minister <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> and holidaying with <a href="Johnny%20Depp">Johnny Depp</a> and <a href="Kate%20Moss">Kate Moss</a> in <a href="Mick%20Jagger">Mick Jagger</a>'s villa in <a href="Mustique">Mustique</a>. During their last stay on the island, Noel wrote the majority of the songs that would make up Oasis's third album. He had suffered from <a href="writer%27s%20block">writer's block</a> during the previous winter, and has since admitted he wrote only a single guitar riff in the six months following the release of "<a href="%28What%27s%20the%20Story%29%20Morning%20Glory%3F">(What's the Story) Morning Glory?</a>". After a few weeks "idling", he disciplined himself to a routine of songwriting where he would go "into this room in the morning, come out for lunch, go back in, come out for dinner, go back in, then go to bed." Noel has later said about the album "... most of the songs were written before I even got a record deal, I went away and wrote the lyrics in about two weeks." The band's producer <a href="Owen%20Morris">Owen Morris</a> joined Gallagher later with a <a href="TASCAM">TASCAM</a> 8-track recorder, and they recorded demos with a drum machine and a keyboard.

In August 1996, the band performed two concerts before crowds of 250,000 at <a href="Knebworth%20House">Knebworth House</a>, Hertfordshire, while more than 2,500,000 fans had applied for tickets. The dates were to be the zenith of Oasis's popularity, and both the music press and the band realised it would not be possible for the band to equal the event. By this time however, there was much instability and internal conflict emerging between the band members. On 23 August 1996, vocalist <a href="Liam%20Gallagher">Liam Gallagher</a> refused to sing for an "<a href="MTV%20Unplugged">MTV Unplugged</a>" performance at London's <a href="Royal%20Festival%20Hall">Royal Festival Hall</a>, pleading a sore throat. Though he did attend the concert, he spent the evening heckling Noel from the upper level balcony. Four days later, Liam declined to participate in the first leg of an American tour, complaining that he needed to buy a house with his then girlfriend <a href="Patsy%20Kensit">Patsy Kensit</a>. He re-joined the band a few days after for a key concert at the <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award">MTV Video Music Award</a>s in New York, but intentionally sang off-key and spat beer and saliva during the performance. The following day, "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" led with the front-page headline "America sickened by obscene Liam's spitting rampage." Amongst much internal bickering, the tour continued—with Liam—to <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a>, where Noel finally lost his patience with his brother and announced he was leaving the band. He later admitted "If the truth be known, I didn't want to be there anyway. I wasn't prepared to be in the band if people were being like that to each other." 

Although Noel rejoined Oasis a few weeks later, the band's management and handlers were worried. With an album's worth of songs already demoed, the general feeling among the Gallaghers was that they should record as soon as possible. Their manager, Marcus Russell, said in 2007 that "in retrospect, we went in the studio too quickly. The smart move would have been to take the rest of the year off. But at the time it seemed like the right thing to do. If you're a band and you've got a dozen songs you think are great, why not go and do it." Noel Gallagher would agree with this assessment in 2016: "Instead of going, ‘Right, we should just go our separate ways for a year or two,’ we decided like idiots to go straight into the studio. That maybe wasn't the best idea." Morris expressed opposite sentiments, arguing that "It was a mistake on everyone's part, management very much included, that we didn’t record "Be Here Now" in the summer of 1996. It would have been a much different album: happy probably." He described the Mustique demos as "the last good recordings I did with Noel" and had a good rapport with Gallagher before Knebworth, regarding the concert as having changed things for the worse.

Recording began on 7 October 1996 at EMI's <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a> in London. Morris described the first week as "fucking awful", and suggested to Noel that they abandon the session: "He just shrugged and said it would be all right. So on we went." Liam was under heavy tabloid focus at the time, and on 9 November 1996 was arrested and cautioned for <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> possession following a bender at the "Q" Awards. A media frenzy ensued, and the band's management made the decision to move to a studio less readily accessible to paparazzi. "The Sun"s showbiz editor <a href="Dominic%20Mohan">Dominic Mohan</a> recalled of the period: "We had quite a few Oasis contacts on the payroll. I don't know whether any were drug dealers, but there was always a few dodgy characters about." Oasis's official photographer <a href="Jill%20Furmanovsky">Jill Furmanovsky</a> felt the media's focus, and was preyed upon by tabloid journalists living in the flat upstairs from her: "They thought I had the band hiding in my flat." In paranoia, Oasis cut themselves off from their wider circle. According to Johnny Hopkins, the publicist of Oasis's label <a href="Creation%20Records">Creation Records</a>, "People were being edged out of the circle around Oasis. People who knew them before they were famous rather than because they were famous." Hopkins likened the situation to a medieval court, complete with kings, courtiers and jesters. As he explained, "[o]nce you're in that situation you lose sight of reality."

On 11 November 1996, Oasis relocated to the rural Ridge Farm Studios in <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>. Though the band reconvened with more energy, the early recordings were compromised by the drug intake of all involved. Morris recalled that "in the first week, someone tried to score an ounce of weed, but instead got an ounce of cocaine. Which kind of summed it up." Noel was not present during any of Liam's vocal track recordings, typifying the high drama surrounding the sessions. Morris thought that the new material was weak, but when he voiced his opinion to Noel he was cut down: "[So] I just carried on shovelling drugs up my nose." Morris expressed regret at being unable to simply transfer the Mustique demos and overdub drums, vocals, and rhythm guitar, as the 8-track mixer he had employed required him to <a href="ping-pong%20recording">bounce tracks</a> for overdubs, leaving him unable to remove the drum machine from the recordings.

Noel, wanting to make the album as dense and "colossal" feeling as possible, layered multiple guitar tracks on several of the songs. In many instances he dubbed ten channels with identical guitar parts, in an effort to create a sonic volume. Creation's owner <a href="Alan%20McGee">Alan McGee</a> visited the studio during the <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixing</a> stage; he said, "I used to go down to the studio, and there was so much cocaine getting done at that point ... Owen was out of control, and he was the one in charge of it. The music was just "fucking loud"." Morris responded, "Alan McGee was the head of the record company. Why didn’t he do something about the “out of control” record producer”? Obviously, the one not in control was the head of the record company." He further explained that he and the band had been dealing with personal difficulties the day and night before McGee visited the studio.

As with Oasis' previous two albums, the songs on "Be Here Now" are generally anthemic. The structures are traditional, and largely follow the typical verse – chorus – verse – chorus – middle eight – chorus <a href="Verse%E2%80%93chorus%20form">format</a> of guitar-based rock music. Reviewing for "Nude as the News", Jonathan Cohen noted that the album is "virtually interchangeable with 1994's "<a href="Definitely%20Maybe">Definitely Maybe</a>" or its blockbuster sequel, "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?"", while Noel had previously remarked that he would make three albums in this generic style. Yet the songs on "Be Here Now" differ in that they are longer than previous releases; an extended <a href="Coda%20%28music%29">coda</a> brings "<a href="D%27You%20Know%20What%20I%20Mean%3F">D'You Know What I Mean?</a>" to almost eight minutes, while "<a href="All%20Around%20the%20World%20%28Oasis%20song%29">All Around the World</a>" contains three <a href="Key%20%28music%29">key</a> changes and lasts for a full nine minutes. The tracks are more layered and intricate than before, and each contains multiple guitar <a href="Overdubbing">overdubs</a>. While Morris had previously stripped away layers of overdubs on the band's debut "Definitely Maybe", during the production of "Be Here Now" he "seemed to gleefully encourage" such excess; "My Big Mouth" has an estimated thirty tracks of guitar overdubbed onto the song. A "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" review described the guitar lines as composed of "elementary riffs." There was some experimentation: "D'You Know What I Mean?" contains a <a href="Amen%20break">slowed down loop</a> from <a href="N.W.A">N.W.A</a>'s "<a href="Straight%20Outta%20Compton%20%28song%29">Straight Outta Compton</a>", while "Magic Pie" features psychedelically arranged vocal harmonies and a <a href="mellotron">mellotron</a>. According to Noel, "All I did was run my elbows across the keys and this mad jazz came out and everyone laughed." The album's production is dominated by top-end high frequency tones, and according to "<a href="Uncut%20%28magazine%29">Uncut</a>"s <a href="Paul%20Lester">Paul Lester</a>, its use of <a href="treble%20%28sound%29">treble</a> is reminiscent of both late 1980s Creation Records bands such as <a href="My%20Bloody%20Valentine%20%28band%29">My Bloody Valentine</a>, and <a href="The%20Stooges">The Stooges</a>' famously under-produced "<a href="Raw%20Power">Raw Power</a>".
The vocal melodies continue Noel's preference for "massed-rank sing-alongs", although <a href="Paul%20Du%20Noyer">Paul Du Noyer</a> concedes that not all are of the "pub-trashing idiot kind" of previous releases. At the time of release, "Q"s Phil Sutcliffe summarised the lyrics of "Be Here Now" as a mixture of "hookline optimism, a swarm of Beatles and other '60s references, a gruff love song to Meg, and further tangled expressions of his inability/unwillingness to express profound emotions."

The lyrics were elsewhere described as "[running] the gamut from insightful to insipid", although Du Noyer admitted that Noel is "[to go by his lyrics] something of a closet philosopher ... and often romantic to the point of big girl's blousedom." While the tracks "Don't Go Away" and "The Girl in the Dirty Shirt" were described as unabashedly sentimental, Du Noyer went on to observe that "there is compassion and sensitivity in these tracks that is not the work of oafs." Du Noyer conceded that Noel often tied himself up in "cosmic knots", but had "written words that sound simple and true, and are therefore poetic without trying to be." Lester read song titles such as "Stand by Me" and "Don't Go Away" as a series of demands, both to members of his private life and his public audience.

Du Noyer praised Liam's vocal contributions and described his "Northern punk whine" as "the most distinctive individual style of our time." Lester alluded to Liam as Noel's "mouthpiece", although he qualified that Liam is the "voice of every working-class boy with half a yen to break out and make it big."

When Alan McGee, Creation's publicist Johnny Hopkins, and marketing executive Emma Greengrass first heard "Be Here Now" at Noel Gallagher's house, each had their doubts about its artistic value, but kept their doubts to themselves. One Creation employee recalled "a lot of nodding of heads, a lot of slapping of backs." McGee later admitted to having strong misgivings at first: "I heard it in the studio and I remember saying 'We'll only sell seven million copies' ... I thought it was too confrontational." However, in an interview with the music press a few days later he predicted the album would sell twenty million copies. McGee's hyperbole alarmed both Oasis and their management company Ignition, and both immediately excluded him from involvement in the release campaign. Ignition's strategy from that point on centred on an effort to suppress all publicity, and withheld access to both music and information from anybody not directly involved with the album's release. Fearful of the dangers of over-hype and bootlegging, their aim was to present the record as a "regular, everyday collection of tunes." To this end they planned a modest marketing budget, to be spent on subdued promotional activities such as street posters and music press adverts, while avoiding mainstream instruments such as billboard and TV advertising. According to Greengrass "We want to keep it low key. We want to keep control of the whole mad thing."

However, the extent that Ignition were willing to go to control access to the album generated more hype than could normally have been expected, and served to alienate members of both the print and broadcast media, as well as most Creation staff members. When "<a href="D%27You%20Know%20What%20I%20Mean%3F">D'You Know What I Mean?</a>" was planned as the first single, Ignition decided on a late release to radio so as to avoid too much advance exposure. However, three stations broke the embargo, and Ignition panicked. According to Greengrass: "we'd been in these bloody bunker meetings for six months or something, and our plot was blown. 'Shit, it's a nightmare'." <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a> received a CD containing three songs ten days before the album's release, on condition that disc jockey <a href="Steve%20Lamacq">Steve Lamacq</a> talked over the tracks to prevent illegal copies being made by listeners. The day after Lamacq previewed the album on his show, he received a phone call from Ignition informing him that he would not be able to preview further tracks because he didn't speak enough over the songs. Lamacq said, "I had to go on the air the next night and say, 'Sorry, but we're not getting any more tracks.' It was just "absurd."" According to Creation's head of marketing John Andrews, "[The campaign] made people despise Oasis within Creation. You had this Oasis camp that was like 'I'm sorry, you're not allowed come into the office between the following hours. You're not allowed mention the word Oasis.' It was like a fascist state." One employee recalled an incident "when somebody came round to check our phones because they thought "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" had tapped them."

When Hopkins began to circulate <a href="Compact%20Cassette">cassette</a> copies of the album to the music press a few weeks later, he required that each journalist sign a contract containing a clause requiring that the cassette recipient, according to "Select" journalist Mark Perry, "not discuss the album with anyone—including your partner at home. It basically said don't talk to your girlfriend about it when you're at home in bed." "<a href="The%20Mail%20on%20Sunday">The Mail on Sunday</a>" wrote of Russell "[He] has a mind like a steel trap and the organisational skills of <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>." Reflecting in 1999, Greengrass admitted: "In retrospect a lot of the things we did were ridiculous. We sit in [Oasis] meetings today and we're like 'It's on the Internet. It's in <a href="Camden%20Market">Camden Market</a>. Whatever'. I think we've learned our lesson." According to Perry: "It seemed, particularly once you heard the album, that this was cocaine grandeur of just the most ludicrous degree. I remember listening to "<a href="All%20Around%20the%20World%20%28Oasis%20song%29">All Around the World</a>" and laughing—actually quite pleasurably—because it seemed so ridiculous. You just thought: Christ, there is so much coke being done here."

The cover image was shot in April 1997 at <a href="Stocks%20House">Stocks House</a> in Hertfordshire, the former home of <a href="Victor%20Lownes">Victor Lownes</a>, head of the Playboy Clubs in the UK until 1981. It shows the band standing outside the hotel surrounded by various props; in the centre is a <a href="Rolls-Royce%20%28car%29">Rolls Royce</a> floating in a swimming pool. Photographer Michael Spencer Johns said the original concept involved shooting each band member in various locations around the world, but when the cost proved prohibitive, the shoot was relocated to Stocks House. Spencer remarked that the shoot "degenerated into chaos", adding that "by 8 pm, everyone was in the bar, there were schoolkids all over the set, and the lighting crew couldn't start the generator. It was <a href="Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a> meets <a href="Apocalypse%20Now">Apocalypse Now</a>." Critics have tried to read into the selection of the cover props, but Johns said Gallagher simply selected items from the BBC props store he thought would look good in the picture. Two props considered were an inflatable globe (intended as a homage to the sleeve of "Definitely Maybe") and the Rolls Royce, suggested by Arthurs. The release date in each region was commemorated on the calendar pictured on the sleeve; Harris said the dating "[encouraged] fans to believe that to buy a copy on the day it appeared was to participate in some kind of historical event."

"Be Here Now" was released in the UK on 21 August 1997. The release date had been brought forward out of Ignition's fear that import copies of the album from the United States would arrive in Britain before that country's designated street date. Worrying that TV news cameras would interview queuing fans at a traditional midnight opening session, Ignition forced retailers to sign contracts pledging not to sell the record earlier than 8:00am. However, when the album did go on sale, the cameras showed up regardless, just in time to record the initially slow trade. It was not until lunch time that sales picked up. By the end of the first day of release, "Be Here Now" sold over 424,000 units and by the end of business on Saturday of that week sales had reached 663,389, making it, at the time, the fastest-selling album in British history. The album debuted at number two on the "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" charts in the United States kept off the #1 spot by <a href="Sean%20Combs">Puff Daddy's</a> "<a href="No%20Way%20Out%20%28Puff%20Daddy%20album%29">No Way Out</a>", but its first week sales of 152,000—below expected sales of 400,000 copies—were considered a disappointment.

Contemporaneous reviews of "Be Here Now" were, in <a href="John%20Harris%20%28critic%29">John Harris</a>'s words, unanimous with "truly amazing praise." According to Harris, "To find an album that had attracted gushing notices in such profusion, one had to go back thirty years, to the release of "<a href="Sgt.%20Pepper%27s%20Lonely%20Hearts%20Club%20Band">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>"." While "Q" magazine described the album as "cocaine set to music", most early reviews praised the record's length, volume and ambition. Reviews in the British music press for Oasis' previous album "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?" had been generally negative. When it went on to become, in the words of "<a href="Select%20%28magazine%29">Select</a>" editor <a href="Alexis%20Petridis">Alexis Petridis</a>, "this huge kind of Zeitgeist defining record" the music press was "baffled". Realising they had got it wrong the last time, Petridis believes the initial glowing reviews were a concession to public opinion.
By the end of 1997, "Be Here Now" had sold eight million units worldwide. However, the sales volume was largely gained in the first two weeks of release, and once the album was released to UK radio stations the turnover tapered off. Buyers realised that the album was not another "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?", and by 1999, "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" reported that it was the album most sold to second-hand record stores. In the 2003 John Dower-directed documentary "", music critic <a href="Jon%20Savage">Jon Savage</a> pinpointed "Be Here Now" as the moment where the <a href="Britpop">Britpop</a> movement ended. Savage said that while the album "isn't the great disaster that everybody says", he noted that "[i]t was supposed to be the big, big triumphal record" of the period. "Q" expressed similar sentiments, writing, "So colossally did "Be Here Now" fall short of expectations that it killed Britpop and ushered in an era of more ambitious, less overblown music". "<a href="Irish%20Times">Irish Times</a>" journalist Brian Boyd wrote: "Bloated and over-heated (much like the band themselves at the time), the album has all that dreadful braggadocio that is so characteristic of a cocaine user." Reflecting in 2007, Garry Mulholland admitted, "the fact that nothing could have lived up to the fevered expectations that surrounded its release doesn't change the facts. The third Oasis album is a loud, lumbering noise signifying nothing."

The Gallagher brothers hold differing opinions about the album. As early as July 1997, Noel was "talking down" "Be Here Now" in the music press, describing the production as "bland", and remarking that some of the tracks were "fucking shit". Noel is also very keen to downplay the record's commercial success, saying: "Just because you sell lots of records, it doesn't mean to say you're any good. Look at <a href="Phil%20Collins">Phil Collins</a>." In "Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop", he dismissed the album, and blamed its faults on drugs and the band's indifference during recording. He suggested that the people unsatisfied with the record simply sell it. In contrast, Noel noted that his brother "thinks it fucking rocks." In the same documentary, Liam defended the record, and said that "at that time we thought it was fucking great, and I still think it's great. It just wasn't "Morning Glory"." In 2006, Liam said of Noel, "If he didn't like the record that much, he shouldn't have put the fucking record out in the first place ... I don't know what's up with him but it's a top record, man, and I'm proud of it—it's just a little bit long." Noel Gallagher has observed that many Oasis fans still hold the album in high regard, as well as some prominent musicians such as <a href="Marilyn%20Manson">Marilyn Manson</a>.

As part of a promotional campaign entitled Chasing the Sun, the album was re-released on 14 October 2016. The three-disc deluxe edition includes remastered versions of the album and seven B-sides from the album's three UK singles. Bonus content includes demos, the Mustique sessions, live tracks, and a 2016 remix of "D'You Know What I Mean?"

Washington State Route 520

State Route 520 (SR 520) is a <a href="State%20highways%20in%20Washington">state highway</a> and <a href="freeway">freeway</a> in the <a href="Seattle%20metropolitan%20area">Seattle metropolitan area</a>, part of the U.S. state of <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>. It runs from <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> in the west to <a href="Redmond%2C%20Washington">Redmond</a> in the east. The freeway connects Seattle to the <a href="Eastside%20%28King%20County%2C%20Washington%29">Eastside</a> region of <a href="King%20County%2C%20Washington">King County</a> via the <a href="Evergreen%20Point%20Floating%20Bridge%20%282016%29">Evergreen Point Floating Bridge</a> on <a href="Lake%20Washington">Lake Washington</a>. SR 520 intersects several state highways, including <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20Washington">Interstate 5</a> (I-5) in Seattle, <a href="Interstate%20405%20%28Washington%29">I-405</a> in <a href="Bellevue%2C%20Washington">Bellevue</a>, and <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20202">SR 202</a> in Redmond.

The <a href="Evergreen%20Point%20Floating%20Bridge%20%281963%29">original floating bridge</a> was opened in 1963 as a replacement for the cross-lake <a href="Lake%20Washington%20steamboats%20and%20ferries">ferry system</a> that had operated since the late 19th century. In 1964, SR 520 was designated as a freeway connecting I-5 to I-405. An extension to Redmond was proposed later in the decade. In the 1970s and 1980s, sections of the freeway between Bellevue and Redmond were opened to traffic, replacing the temporary designation of SR 920.

Since the 1990s, SR 520 has been expanded with <a href="high-occupancy%20vehicle%20lane">high-occupancy vehicle lane</a>s (HOV lanes) and new interchanges to serve the <a href="Overlake%2C%20Washington">Overlake</a> area. In 2016, the original Evergreen Point Floating Bridge was replaced by a wider bridge, as part of a multibillion-dollar expansion program that is scheduled to be completed in the 2020s. The program also includes the construction of new bus infrastructure at <a href="Montlake%2C%20Seattle">Montlake</a> and on the Eastside, as well as a bicycle and pedestrian path along most of the highway's length.

SR 520 begins at an interchange with <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20Washington">I-5</a> in northern <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> near <a href="Roanoke%20Park%20%28Seattle%29">Roanoke Park</a>. The interchange provides access to both directions of I-5 as well as a westbound off-ramp to Harvard Avenue and Roanoke Street. SR 520 travels east across the south end of <a href="Portage%20Bay">Portage Bay</a> and its <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s on the Portage Bay Viaduct, entering the <a href="Montlake%2C%20Seattle">Montlake</a> neighborhood. In Montlake, the highway intersects Montlake Boulevard (<a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20513">SR 513</a>) and <a href="Lake%20Washington%20Boulevard">Lake Washington Boulevard</a> just south of the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> campus and <a href="Husky%20Stadium">Husky Stadium</a>. The freeway gains a set of <a href="high-occupancy%20vehicle%20lane">HOV lanes</a> and continues east on a pair of <a href="causeway">causeway</a>s through the <a href="marsh">marsh</a>lands of <a href="Union%20Bay%20%28Seattle%29">Union Bay</a> and <a href="Foster%20Island%20%28Washington%29">Foster Island</a>, at the north end of the <a href="Washington%20Park%20Arboretum">Washington Park Arboretum</a>.

From Seattle, SR 520 crosses <a href="Lake%20Washington">Lake Washington</a> on the six-lane <a href="Evergreen%20Point%20Floating%20Bridge%20%282016%29">Evergreen Point Floating Bridge</a>; at , it is the longest <a href="pontoon%20bridge">floating bridge</a> in the world. Tolls are <a href="electronic%20toll%20collection">collected electronically</a> using the state's <a href="Good%20to%20Go%20%28toll%20collection%20system%29">Good to Go</a> pass or by mail, and vary based on time of day and the vehicle's number of <a href="axle">axle</a>s. , tolls for Good to Go users range from a minimum of $1.25 between midnight and 5:00 a.m. and a maximum of $4.30 during the morning and evening <a href="peak%20period">peak period</a>s; tolls paid by mail range from $3.25 to $6.30. The freeway reaches the eastern end of Lake Washington at <a href="Evergreen%20Point">Evergreen Point</a> in northern <a href="Medina%2C%20Washington">Medina</a>, where it travels under a landscaped <a href="List%20of%20structures%20built%20on%20top%20of%20freeways">park lid</a> and next to a <a href="median%20%28road%29">median-side</a> <a href="bus%20station">bus station</a>. After an interchange and lid at 84th Avenue Northeast in <a href="Hunts%20Point%2C%20Washington">Hunts Point</a>, SR 520 travels eastward around the northern edge of <a href="Clyde%20Hill%2C%20Washington">Clyde Hill</a> in a north-facing <a href="arc%20%28geometry%29">arc</a>, passing through the <a href="Yarrow%20Point%2C%20Washington">Yarrow Point</a> lid and bus station. The freeway enters <a href="Bellevue%2C%20Washington">Bellevue</a>, intersecting <a href="Interstate%20405%20%28Washington%29">I-405</a> and crossing over the <a href="Eastside%20Rail%20Corridor">Eastside Rail Corridor</a>. SR 520 continues along the north side of the <a href="Bel-Red%2C%20Bellevue">Bel-Red</a> industrial area and enters the <a href="Overlake%2C%20Washington">Overlake</a> area of <a href="Redmond%2C%20Washington">Redmond</a>.

Within Overlake, SR 520 turns north and passes through several <a href="office%20park">office park</a>s, including the <a href="Microsoft%20Redmond%20Campus">headquarters campus</a> of <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> and the <a href="Nintendo%20of%20America">Nintendo of America</a> branch office. To serve exits at Northeast 40th Street and Northeast 51st Street, SR 520 gains a set of <a href="collector%E2%80%93distributor%20lane">collector–distributor lane</a>s, separated from other lanes by a <a href="jersey%20barrier">concrete barrier</a>. The freeway crosses the <a href="Sammamish%20River">Sammamish River</a> and turns east, passing to the south of the <a href="Redmond%20Town%20Center">Redmond Town Center</a> mall and <a href="Bear%20Creek%20%28Washington%29">Bear Creek</a> and to the north of <a href="Marymoor%20Park">Marymoor Park</a>. East of downtown Redmond, SR 520 intersects <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20202">SR 202</a> and terminates; the road continues north as Avondale Road towards <a href="Cottage%20Lake%2C%20Washington">Cottage Lake</a>. Portions of the corridor from Montlake to Downtown Redmond are also paralleled by a <a href="shared%20use%20path">shared-use trail</a> for bicycles and pedestrians.

SR 520's entire route is designated as part of the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, classifying it as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. The <a href="Government%20of%20Washington%20%28state%29">State of Washington</a> also designates the SR 520 corridor as a Highway of Statewide Significance, a category of highways that connect major communities throughout the state. SR 520 is maintained by the <a href="Washington%20State%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Washington State Department of Transportation</a> (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on the state's highways to measure traffic volume in terms of <a href="average%20annual%20daily%20traffic">average annual daily traffic</a>. In 2016, WSDOT calculated that 80,000 vehicles traveled on SR 520 near its interchange with SR 202 in Redmond and 47,000 vehicles used it at SR 513 in Seattle, the highest and lowest traffic counts along the highway, respectively. The highway is noted for its lack of a "<a href="reverse%20commute">reverse commute</a>", with roughly equal amounts of traffic in both directions during peak periods.

New towns along the eastern shore of Lake Washington were established in the late 19th century and initially served by <a href="Lake%20Washington%20steamboats%20and%20ferries">steamship ferries</a>, bringing passengers and goods to and from Seattle. By 1913, the steam ferry "<a href="Leschi%20%28steam%20ferry%29">Leschi</a>" was transporting automobiles and pedestrians between Seattle and the docks in Bellevue, <a href="Kirkland%2C%20Washington">Kirkland</a>, and Medina. In 1940, the <a href="Lacey%20V.%20Murrow%20Memorial%20Bridge">Lake Washington Floating Bridge</a> was opened between Seattle and <a href="Mercer%20Island%2C%20Washington">Mercer Island</a>, carrying the <a href="Sunset%20Highway%20%28Washington%29">Sunset Highway</a> (later <a href="Interstate%2090%20in%20Washington">I-90</a>) from Seattle towards Bellevue and the Eastside. The new bridge allowed the Eastside to develop rapidly into <a href="bedroom%20community">bedroom communities</a> in the 1940s and 1950s; the bridge also replaced the ferry system, which ceased operation in 1950, shortly after the removal of tolls on the bridge.

In the late 1940s, the state government conducted a feasibility study for a second floating bridge across Lake Washington, in response to increased traffic on the bridge. In 1953, the <a href="Washington%20State%20Legislature">Washington State Legislature</a> approved the construction of a second floating bridge, using past and future tolls to fund its construction. The west end of the floating bridge was to connect to the Everett–Seattle <a href="tollway">tollway</a> (later I-5) at Roanoke Street, south of the planned <a href="Ship%20Canal%20Bridge">Ship Canal Bridge</a>, as well as the proposed <a href="R.H.%20Thomson%20Expressway">Empire Way Expressway</a> (later the R.H. Thompson Expressway) at Montlake. The east end was to connect to the planned north–south freeway <a href="bypass%20%28road%29">bypass</a> of the Seattle area (later I-405), with an optional connection to the <a href="Stevens%20Pass%20Highway">Stevens Pass Highway</a>. Two alignments for the floating bridge were considered in the late 1950s: a <a href="Sand%20Point%2C%20Seattle">Sand Point</a>–Kirkland, favored by the City of Seattle; and an Evergreen Point crossing, favored by the state government and the <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a>, which operated <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Sand%20Point">Naval Air Station Sand Point</a>. The state government initially chose the Montlake–Evergreen Point alignment in 1954, intending to begin construction in 1955, but the alignment dispute delayed a final decision until December 1956. Citizen groups from the Montlake area protested the decision, but were largely ignored by the project's citizen committee.

Construction of the <a href="Evergreen%20Point%20Floating%20Bridge%20%281963%29">Evergreen Point Floating Bridge</a> began on August 29, 1960, and assembly of the bridge's pontoons began the following year. The bridge and its approach highways, connecting the main branch of <a href="Primary%20State%20Highway%201%20%28Washington%29">Primary State Highway 1</a> in Seattle to its Eastside branch near Bellevue, were added to the state highway system in March 1961. Construction of the western approach, an expressway between the Roanoke Interchange, Portage Bay, Montlake, and the Washington Park Arboretum, began in early 1962. The eastern approach was constructed between 1962 and 1963, connecting the bridge to Medina, <a href="Secondary%20State%20Highway%202A%20%28Washington%29">Secondary State Highway 2A</a> in southern <a href="Houghton%2C%20Washington">Houghton</a>, and Northup Way—a local road that continued east towards Redmond.

The Evergreen Point Floating Bridge opened on August 28, 1963, along with the Roanoke Expressway, part of the Seattle Freeway, and the eastern approach to Houghton and Bellevue up to a temporary interchange with 104th Avenue Northeast. The bridge and its approaches, constituting a state highway, were re-designated as Sign Route 520 (later SR 520) under the <a href="1964%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28Washington%29">new state highway numbering system</a> adopted in 1964. SR 520 would use a temporary route on Northup Way (Northeast 20th Street) and Bel-Red Road between Bellevue and SR 202 in Redmond until the planned freeway was completed by the late 1970s.

The Northup Interchange, where SR 520 intersects I-405, was opened on November 22, 1966. The highway was also extended east from 104th Avenue Northeast to 124th Avenue Northeast, serving the Bel-Red industrial area. The state government announced plans in 1968 to begin construction on the remaining freeway to Redmond, via a northeastward course through the Overlake area and across Marymoor Park. Construction of a segment between 124th Avenue Northeast and 148th Avenue Northeast in Overlake began in February 1972 and was completed in December 1973.

The planned route of SR 520 along the north side of Marymoor Park in Redmond was given the temporary designation of SR 920 in 1975. The <a href="two-lane%20expressway">two-lane expressway</a>, connecting West Lake Sammamish Parkway (<a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20901">SR 901</a>) and SR 202, was opened in July 1977 after several months of construction. Completion of the last segment of SR 520, between 148th Avenue Northeast and SR 920, was given priority by Eastside cities and civic groups in the mid-1970s. However, the City of Bellevue asked that the state government build a reversible <a href="bus%20lane">bus lane</a> on the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge before completing the last segment, due to increased traffic on the bridge. The City of Redmond opposed the request, leading to a dispute between the two cities that was later resolved with a compromise to place completion of SR 520 ahead of the bus lane.

The state government approved funding for the Redmond project in 1977, extending SR 520 by at an estimated cost of $10 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars), funded using part of a statewide <a href="gasoline%20tax">gasoline tax</a> increase of two cents per gallon. Contract bidding for the last segment was halted in 1978 by a lawsuit filed by a group of Eastside residents in opposition to the freeway, claiming that its <a href="environmental%20impact">environmental impact</a> had been improperly assessed. <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court">U.S. District</a> Judge <a href="Morell%20Edward%20Sharp">Morell Edward Sharp</a> ruled in favor of the state government in March 1979, allowing for the bid to be awarded to a contractor. The segment was opened to traffic on December 18, 1981. The SR 920 designation was removed from the state highway system in 1985, and the section was re-signed as part of SR 520. A traffic signal at the intersection of SR 520 and Northeast 51st Street remained in place until 1986, when it was replaced with an interchange.

The completion of SR 520 spurred new development in Downtown Redmond and the Overlake area, contributing to major traffic congestion on the freeway. In 1994, the state government approved $81.1 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) in highway improvements for the SR 520 corridor, including lane expansions and the addition of HOV lanes. The segment from West Lake Sammamish Parkway to SR 202 was widened from two to four lanes in September 1995, and included the construction of a new bridge across the Sammamish River. In late 1996, the highway's terminus at SR 202 was converted from a signalized intersection to an interchange, including an overpass connecting to Avondale Road. SR 520's HOV lanes between I-405 and West Lake Sammamish Parkway were opened in 1999 after a $40 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) expansion project. The new lanes were restricted to two persons per vehicle, while the older HOV lanes between I-405 and the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge had a three-person requirement. A new interchange was built at Northeast 40th Street in 2000 to serve the Microsoft Redmond Campus and other nearby employers, along with a set of collector–distributor lanes through the area, and <a href="ramp%20meter">ramp meter</a>s to manage traffic flow. Between 1994 and 2002, portions of a multi-use pedestrian and bicycle path on the north side of the freeway were completed and opened, forming a trail from northern Bellevue to Marymoor Park in Redmond.

In the late 2000s, WSDOT completed several highway improvement projects on the segment of SR 520 between West Lake Sammamish Parkway and SR 202 in Downtown Redmond. In August 2008, a flyover ramp from westbound SR 202 to westbound SR 520 was opened to traffic, replacing a pair of onramp traffic signals. SR 520 was widened to four lanes in each direction in 2010, in a multi-phase project that added HOV and merge lanes, as well as reconstructed ramps at West Lake Sammamish Parkway. In addition to the Downtown Redmond projects, a new lid-like overpass at Northeast 36th Street in Overlake was opened in 2010 to improve traffic in the area. The overpass's $30 million cost (equivalent to $ million in dollars) was funded mostly by <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, along with contributions from the City of Redmond and <a href="American%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment%20Act%20of%202009">federal stimulus</a> funding.

Since the opening of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge in 1963, several proposals from local governments have requested the construction of a parallel span or additional pontoons to increase capacity and add infrastructure for <a href="rapid%20transit">rapid transit</a> and bicyclists. Daily traffic crossing the bridge rose from 17,400 cars in 1964 to nearly 100,000 in 1987, making the bridge the worst traffic <a href="Bottleneck%20%28engineering%29">bottleneck</a> in the state of Washington. By the late 1990s, the bridge was carrying twice as much traffic as it was designed to handle, and calls from Eastside cities and companies for a replacement bridge intensified. WSDOT engineers also determined that sections of the bridge would fail during a large earthquake or a major windstorm, and that the bridge was nearing the end of its life expectancy, necessitating a total replacement. The bridge underwent a major rehabilitation in 1999, including a <a href="seismic%20retrofit">seismic retrofit</a>, and increased resistance to stronger sustained winds, to extend its life expectancy to 20 to 25 years.

The <a href="Washington%20State%20Transportation%20Commission">Washington State Transportation Commission</a> began seeking alternatives for the bridge replacement project in 1997, including a Sand Point crossing and various designs for a parallel replacement span. In 2003, the alternatives were narrowed to a replacement span, with varying lane widths and configurations for interchanges in Seattle. WSDOT chose the project's preferred alternative, a replacement span with six lanes and a mixed-use trail, in 2011. The $4.51 billion <a href="megaproject">megaproject</a>, which encompasses the SR 520 corridor between I-5 and I-405, was funded using a state gas tax and <a href="electronic%20tolling">electronic tolls</a> on the floating bridge introduced on December 29, 2011, to repay <a href="construction%20bond">construction bond</a>s over a 40-year period.

Construction of the SR 520 corridor project began in April 2011 on the Eastside, where WSDOT expanded the freeway to six lanes and added HOV lanes. The project, completed in 2014, also included the construction of new bus stations and direct access ramps, new interchanges, park lids covering SR 520, and a multi-use trail. Construction of the new floating bridge began in 2012, and it was dedicated on April 2, 2016, as the longest floating bridge in the world. The westbound lanes opened on April 11 and the eastbound lanes were opened on April 25. The new, bridge features four general purpose lanes and two HOV lanes, as well as a multi-use trail on its north side that opened on December 20, 2017. Demolition of the former bridge was completed in early 2017. The western approach was partially replaced with a new bridge for westbound traffic in August 2017, with the eastbound lanes remaining on the old approach bridge. As part of the project, several "<a href="ghost%20ramp">ghost ramp</a>s" in the Washington Park Arboretum for the cancelled R.H. Thomson Expressway were demolished in 2017, despite calls to preserve them in memory of the <a href="freeway%20revolt">protests</a> that cancelled the projects in the 1960s.

Improvements to the remaining segment of the SR 520 corridor, between I-5 and the floating bridge, were initially left unfunded, but underwent design and environmental review. In 2015, the state legislature approved $1.64 billion in funding for the "Rest of the West" program, which will be constructed between 2018 and 2029. The first phase of the program, planned to be completed by 2023, will include construction of the eastbound lanes of the western approach bridge and a new Montlake Boulevard interchange with HOV lane ramps, a relocated bus station, and a park lid. The second phase, to be constructed between 2020 and 2026, will include a new bridge across Portage Bay, a park lid near Roanoke Park, and a new HOV lane ramp to the I-5 reversible express lanes. The third phase, to be constructed between 2024 and 2029, will consist of a second <a href="bascule%20bridge">bascule bridge</a> over the <a href="Montlake%20Cut">Montlake Cut</a>, paralleling the existing <a href="Montlake%20Bridge">Montlake Bridge</a>, to connect SR 520 to the <a href="University%20District%2C%20Seattle">University District</a>.

The SR 520 corridor is served by <a href="Sound%20Transit%20Express">Sound Transit Express</a> Route 545, as well as other Sound Transit Express, <a href="King%20County%20Metro">King County Metro</a>, and <a href="Community%20Transit">Community Transit</a> bus routes. The corridor averaged about 24,500 weekday riders in 2016, using 700 bus trips on 18 routes. During peak periods, buses travel on SR 520 every one to four minutes between the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge and I-405.

Sound Transit will begin <a href="Link%20light%20rail">Link light rail</a> service along the Redmond portion of the SR 520 corridor in 2023, with the opening of the <a href="East%20Link%20Extension">East Link Extension</a>. Approved by voters in 2008, the line will connect <a href="Overlake%20Transit%20Center">Overlake Transit Center</a> at Northeast 40th Street and <a href="Overlake%20Village%20station">Overlake Village station</a> at 152nd Avenue Northeast to Seattle and Downtown Bellevue, crossing Lake Washington on the <a href="Homer%20M.%20Hadley%20Memorial%20Bridge">I-90 floating bridge</a>. In 2024, the line will be extended along SR 520 to <a href="Downtown%20Redmond%20station">Downtown Redmond</a>, using funding from the <a href="Sound%20Transit%203">Sound Transit 3</a> program approved by voters in 2016. The rebuilt floating bridge was also designed to accommodate a future light rail extension, requiring supplemental pontoons and new approaches.

Wihtred of Kent

Wihtred () (<a href="circa">c.</a> 670 – 23 April 725) was king of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kent</a> from about 690 or 691 until his death. He was a son of <a href="Ecgberht%20of%20Kent">Ecgberht I</a> and a brother of <a href="Eadric%20of%20Kent">Eadric</a>. Wihtred ascended to the throne after a confused period in the 680s, which included a brief conquest of Kent by <a href="C%C3%A6dwalla%20of%20Wessex">Cædwalla of Wessex</a>, and subsequent dynastic conflicts. His immediate predecessor was <a href="Oswine%20of%20Kent">Oswine</a>, who was probably descended from <a href="Eadbald%20of%20Kent">Eadbald</a>, though not through the same line as Wihtred. Shortly after the start of his reign, Wihtred issued a code of laws—the <a href="Law%20of%20Wihtred">Law of Wihtred</a>—that has been preserved in a manuscript known as the "<a href="Textus%20Roffensis">Textus Roffensis</a>". The laws pay a great deal of attention to the rights of the Church (of the time period), including punishment for irregular marriages and for pagan worship. Wihtred's long reign had few incidents recorded in the annals of the day. He was succeeded in 725 by his sons, <a href="%C3%86thelbert%20II%20of%20Kent">Æthelberht II</a>, <a href="Eadbert%20I%20of%20Kent">Eadberht I</a>, and <a href="Alric%20of%20Kent">Alric</a>.

The dominant force in late-seventh-century politics south of the <a href="River%20Humber">River Humber</a> was <a href="Wulfhere%20of%20Mercia">Wulfhere of Mercia</a>, who reigned from the late 650s to 675. The king of Kent for much of this time was <a href="Ecgberht%20of%20Kent">Ecgberht</a>, who died in 673. Ecgberht's sons, <a href="Eadric%20of%20Kent">Eadric</a> and Wihtred, were probably little more than infants, two or three years old, when their father died; Wulfhere was their uncle by virtue of his marriage to <a href="Eormenhild">Eormenhild</a>, Ecgberht's sister. <a href="Hlothhere%20of%20Kent">Hlothhere</a>, Ecgberht's brother, became king of Kent, but not until about a year later, in 674, and it may be that Wulfhere opposed the accession of Hlothhere and was the effective ruler of Kent during this year-long interregnum.

Eadric raised an army against his uncle and Hlothhere died of wounds sustained in battle in February 685 or possibly 686. Eadric died the following year, and according to <a href="Bede">Bede</a>, whose "<a href="Ecclesiastical%20History%20of%20the%20English%20People">Ecclesiastical History of the English People</a>" is one of the primary sources for this period, the kingdom fell apart into disorder. <a href="C%C3%A6dwalla%20of%20Wessex">Cædwalla of Wessex</a> invaded in 686 and established his brother <a href="Mul%20of%20Kent">Mul</a> as king there; Cædwalla may have ruled Kent directly for a period when Mul was killed in 687. When Cædwalla departed for Rome in 688, <a href="Oswine%20of%20Kent">Oswine</a>, who was probably supported by <a href="%C3%86thelred%20of%20Mercia">Æthelred of Mercia</a>, took the throne for a time. Oswine lost power in 690, but <a href="Sw%C3%A6fheard">Swæfheard</a> (son of <a href="Sebbi%20of%20Essex">Sebbi</a>, the king of Essex), who had been a king in Kent for a year or two, remained. There is clear evidence that both Swæfheard and Oswine were kings at the same time, as each witnessed the other's charters. It seems that Oswine was king of east Kent, which was usually the position of the dominant king, while Swæfheard was king of west Kent.

Wihtred emerged from this disarray and became king in the early 690s. Bede describes his accession by saying that he was the "rightful" king, and that he "freed the nation from foreign invasion by his devotion and diligence". Oswine was also of the royal family, and arguably had a claim to the throne; hence it has been suggested that Bede's comments here are strongly partisan. Bede's correspondent on Kentish affairs was Albinus, abbot of the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul (subsequently renamed <a href="St%20Augustine%27s%20Abbey">St. Augustine's</a>) in Canterbury, and these views can almost certainly be ascribed to the Church establishment there.

Two charters provide evidence of Wihtred's date of accession. One, dated April 697, indicates Wihtred was then in the sixth year of his rule, so his accession can be dated to some time between April 691 and April 692. Another, dated 17 July 694, is in his fourth regnal year, giving a possible range of July 690 to July 691. The overlap in date ranges gives April to July 691 as the likely date of his accession. Another estimate of the date of Wihtred's accession can be made from the duration of his reign, given by Bede as thirty four and a half years. He died on 23 April 725, which would imply an accession date in late 690.

Initially Wihtred ruled alongside Swæfheard. Bede's report of the election of <a href="Bertwald">Beorhtwald</a> as <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> in July 692 mentions that Swæfheard and Wihtred were the kings of Kent, but Swæfheard is not heard of after this date. It appears that by 694 Wihtred was the sole ruler of Kent, though it may also be that his son <a href="%C3%86thelbert%20II%20of%20Kent">Æthelberht</a> was a junior king in west Kent during Wihtred's reign. Wihtred is thought to have had three wives. His first was called Cynegyth, but a charter of 696 names Æthelburh as the royal consort and co-donor of an estate: the former spouse must have died or been dismissed after a short time. Near the end of his reign, a new wife, Wærburh, attested with her husband and son, Alric.

It was also in 694 that Wihtred made peace with the <a href="Wessex">West Saxon</a> king <a href="Ine%20of%20Wessex">Ine</a>. Ine's predecessor, Cædwalla, had invaded Kent and installed his brother <a href="Mul%20of%20Kent">Mul</a> as king, but the Kentishmen had subsequently revolted and burned Mul. Wihtred agreed compensation for the killing, but the amount paid to Ine is uncertain. Most manuscripts of the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" record "thirty thousand", and some specify thirty thousand pounds. If the pounds are equal to <a href="sceat">sceat</a>tas, then this amount is the equal of a king's <a href="wergild">wergild</a>—that is, the legal valuation of a man's life, according to his rank. It seems likely that Wihtred ceded some border territory to Ine as part of this settlement.

The earliest Anglo-Saxon law code to survive, which may date from 602 or 603, is that of <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Kent">Æthelberht of Kent</a>, whose reign ended in 616. In the 670s or 680s, a code was issued in the names of <a href="Hlothhere%20of%20Kent">Hlothhere</a> and <a href="Eadric%20of%20Kent">Eadric of Kent</a>. The next kings to issue laws were Ine of Wessex and Wihtred.

The dating of Wihtred's and Ine's laws is somewhat uncertain, but there is reason to believe that Wihtred's laws were issued on 6 September 695, while Ine's laws were written in 694 or shortly before. Ine had recently agreed peaceful terms with Wihtred over compensation for the death of Mul, and there are indications that the two rulers collaborated to some degree in producing their laws. In addition to the coincidence of timing, there is one clause that appears in almost identical form in both codes. Another sign of collaboration is that Wihtred's laws use "gesith", a West Saxon term for noble, in place of the Kentish term "eorlcund". It is possible that Ine and Wihtred issued the law codes as an act of prestige, to re-establish authority after periods of disruption in both kingdoms.

Wihtred's laws were issued at "Berghamstyde"; it is not known for certain where this was, but the best candidate is <a href="Bearsted">Bearsted</a>, near <a href="Maidstone">Maidstone</a>. The laws are primarily concerned with religious affairs; only the last four of its twenty-eight chapters do not deal with ecclesiastical affairs. The first clause of the code gives the Church freedom from taxation. Subsequent clauses specify penalties for irregular marriages, heathen worship, work on the sabbath, and breaking fasts, among other things; and also define how members of each class of society—such as the king, bishops, priests, ceorls, and esnes—can clear themselves by giving an oath. In addition to the focus of the laws themselves, the introduction makes clear the importance of the Church in the legislative process. Bertwald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was present at the assembly which devised the decrees, and so was <a href="Gebmund">Gefmund</a>, the Bishop of Rochester; and "every order of the Church of that nation spoke in unanimity with the loyal people".

The privileges given to the Church are notable: in addition to the freedom from taxation, the oath of a bishop is "incontrovertible", which places it at the same level as the oath of a king, and the Church receives the same level of compensation for violence done to dependents as does the king. This has led one historian to describe the Church's power, less than a century after the original Roman mission landed in Kent, as "all but co-ordinate with the king himself in the Kentish state", and it has also been described as presupposing "a frightening degree of royal power". However, the presence of clauses that provide penalties for any of Wihtred's subjects who "sacrifice to devils" makes it clear that although Christianity was dominant, the older pagan beliefs of the population had by no means died out completely.

Clause 21 of the code specifies that a ceorl must find three men of his own class to be his "oath-helpers". An oath-helper would swear an oath on behalf of an accused man, to clear him from the suspicion of the crime. The laws of Ine were more stringent than this, requiring that a high-ranking person must be found to be an oath-helper for everyone, no matter what class they were from. The two laws taken together imply a significant weakening of an earlier state in which a man's kin were legally responsible for him.

On his death, Wihtred left Kent to his three sons: <a href="%C3%86thelbert%20II%20of%20Kent">Æthelberht II</a>, <a href="Eadbert%20I%20of%20Kent">Eadberht I</a>, and <a href="Alric%20of%20Kent">Alric</a>. The chronology of the reigns following Wihtred is unclear, although there is evidence of both an Æthelbert and at least one Eadbert in the following years. After Wihtred's death, and the departure of Ine of Wessex for Rome the following year, <a href="%C3%86thelbald%20of%20Mercia">Æthelbald of Mercia</a> became the dominant power in the south of England.

Mischief Makers

Mischief Makers is a 1997 <a href="side-scrolling">side-scrolling</a> <a href="platform%20game">platform</a> video game developed by <a href="Treasure%20%28company%29">Treasure</a> and published by <a href="Enix">Enix</a> and <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> for the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a>. The player assumes the role of Marina, a robotic maid who journeys to rescue her creator from the emperor of Planet Clancer. The gameplay revolves around grabbing, shaking, and throwing objects. There are five worlds and 52 levels, and the game is displayed in <a href="2.5D">2.5D</a>.

The game was the first 2D side-scrolling game for the Nintendo 64, and Treasure's first release for a Nintendo console. The company began "Mischief Makers" development in mid-1995 with little knowledge of the console's features. The 12-person team wanted to make a novel gameplay mechanic, and implementing the resultant "catching" technique became their most difficult task. The game appeared at the 1997 <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> and was released in Japan on June 27, 1997, and later in the United States, Europe, and Australia.

The game received "mixed or average reviews", according to video game review score aggregator <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. Critics praised "Mischief Makers" inventiveness, personality, and <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss</a> fights, but criticized its brevity, low difficulty, low <a href="replay%20value">replay value</a>, sound, and harsh introductory learning curve. Retrospective reviewers disagreed with the originally poor reception, and multiple reviewers noted Marina's signature "Shake, shake!" <a href="sound%20bite">sound bite</a> as a highlight. Video game journalists cited "Mischief Makers" as ripe for reissue either through the <a href="Nintendo%20eShop">Nintendo eShop</a> or in a sequel or franchise reboot. In 2009, "<a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a>" called it "possibly the most underrated and widely ignored game on the N64".

 "Mischief Makers" is the first <a href="single-player">single-player</a> 2D <a href="side-scrolling">side-scrolling</a> <a href="platform%20game">platform game</a> on the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a> console. Its gameplay combines platform <a href="game%20mechanics">game mechanics</a> with aspects from the action and puzzle genres. The characters and backgrounds are modeled in pre-rendered 3D similar to "<a href="Donkey%20Kong%20Country">Donkey Kong Country</a>" "Advanced Computer Modeling". This style, with 3D backgrounds behind 2D gameplay, is known as "<a href="2.5D">D</a>". Compared to previous Treasure <a href="Run%20and%20gun%20%28video%20game%29">run and gun games</a>, "Mischief Makers" gameplay is more exploratory in nature.

The <a href="player-character">player-character</a>, a robotic maid named Marina, journeys to save her kidnapped creator. The story takes place on Planet Clancer, a world on the cusp of civil war due to the actions of its Emperor and his Imperial forces. The Emperor brainwashes Clancers to kidnap the visiting robotics genius Professor Theo. Theo's creation, the player-character Ultra-InterGalactic-Cybot G Marina Liteyears, pursues the professor and grabs, throws, and shakes the obstacles in her way, such as enemies, floating "Clanball" platforms, warp stars, and missiles. Indeed, almost all game objects can be grabbed, which lends towards the shake-based combat system. Marina can shake "grabbed" objects to throw them as projectiles or to find loot. Objects sometimes change functions when shaken, such as items that become homing missiles and guns with multi-directional shots. Some drop red, blue, and green gems, which restore player <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">health</a>. The health gauge in the corner of the screen shows the amount of damage Marina can take. The player can store up to two additional stock lives. Yellow gems hidden in each level extend the final cutscene's length. Marina can run, jump, and boost (via jetpack) in the eight <a href="Cardinal%20direction">cardinal and ordinal directions</a>. She can also slide, hover, and roll.

The game has five worlds with roughly twelve <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a> apiece. Some levels are action-only while others include puzzles. The player's goal is to reach a warp star at each level's end. En route, Marina shakes enemies, breaks blocks, uses weapons, and rides "bikes" and objects along wire path mazes. Each world has both final and mid-level <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">bosses</a>. The levels and boss fights use <a href="Scale%20%28ratio%29">scaling</a> and screen rotation <a href="special%20effects">special effects</a> to vary the gameplay.

Almost all things on Planet Clancerincluding people, buildings, and petseither wear or are inscribed with identical "sad" faces with "red, glowing eyes". A Clancer named Teran substitutes for Marina in several brief areas and uses non-shake mechanics like punching, kicking, and <a href="double%20jump%20%28video%20gaming%29">double jumping</a>. A character named Calina, a petulant Clancer who imitates Marina, recurs throughout the game as a <a href="comedic%20device">comedic device</a>.

<a href="Treasure%20%28company%29">Treasure</a> began to develop "Mischief Makers" in mid 1995. At the time, they knew little about the Nintendo 64's final technical specifications, graphics implementation, and <a href="development%20kit">development kit</a>, but were nevertheless interested in the console and its improved "<a href="pixel">pixel</a> quality". Historically, Treasure developed games exclusively for Sega consoles, which made "Mischief Makers" their first release for a Nintendo console. Bringing "Mischief Makers" to the Nintendo 64 was a hardware-based decision: the Nintendo 64's <a href="video%20game%20cartridge">cartridges</a> were more expensive than <a href="CD-ROMs">CD-ROMs</a>, but they loaded data instantly and were thus more conducive for <a href="action%20games">action games</a> such as "Mischief Makers". However, Treasure <a href="CEO">CEO</a> Masato Maegawa said that development for the Nintendo 64 had a harsher learning curve than even the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a>. Other than the special attention required to build a single boss in 3D, the team did not use features specific to the Nintendo 64 hardware.

Treasure's founders had come from <a href="Konami">Konami</a>, where they worked on <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> games such as "<a href="Castlevania%20%281986%20video%20game%29">Castlevania</a>" and "<a href="Contra%20%28video%20game%29">Contra</a>". They found their development environment restrictive and left to try riskier concepts and to singularly focus on making "great games". In the three years between Treasure's founding and "Mischief Makers" development, the company released highly regarded games such as "<a href="Gunstar%20Heroes">Gunstar Heroes</a>"known as "one of the definitive <a href="16-bit%20era">16-bit</a> action games"and "<a href="Dynamite%20Headdy">Dynamite Headdy</a>". An average of 12 people worked on "Mischief Makers", with up to 15 at times. Though the team was different in composition from that of previous Treasure titles, it included the lead programmer and character designer from "Gunstar Heroes". Treasure's CEO said that the company liked to expand into new genres, though they primarily work in genres where the staff had experience. The company sought to depart from the "Gunstar Heroes" <a href="shoot%20%27em%20up">shoot 'em up</a> design, and chose to build "Mischief Makers" around an original "catching" gameplay mechanic, which became the hardest aspect to implement. While foreign (non-Japanese) aesthetics were popular with other Japanese developers, Treasure's CEO felt the company's games did not look "particularly foreign" and could appeal to Japanese audiences.

The game was Treasure's first to be published by <a href="Enix">Enix</a>. The publisher sought out Treasure for their reputation in the action game genre, and had approached Treasure several times before the Nintendo 64 project surfaced. Upon choosing to make the game for the Nintendo 64, Treasure thought it would be a "good idea" to work with Enix. And similar to how Treasure ended its historic loyalty to the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> by developing "Mischief Makers" for Nintendo, Enix had just recently ended its historic loyalty to Nintendo by signing "<a href="Dragon%20Quest%20VII">Dragon Quest VII</a>" of their "<a href="Dragon%20Quest">Dragon Quest</a>" franchise to Sony. Neither Square or Enix built a "special relationship" with Nintendo specific for "Mischief Makers" release, though Nintendo later served as the game's publisher for Western markets. When their English localization of the Japanese game finished ahead of schedule, the North American release date was advanced two weeks accordingly.

"Mischief Makers" was the only game displayed at the Enix booth at the April 1997 Tokyo Game Show. It was later demonstrated at the 1997 <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> and released in Japan on June 27, 1997, the United States on October 1, and Europe and Australia on January 15, 1998. Its Japanese title is "Yuke-Yuke Trouble Makers", or "Go-Go Trouble Makers". Near the time of the game's Japanese launch, Treasure announced that they would continue to develop for the Nintendo 64 with the Japan-only "<a href="Bakuretsu%20Muteki%20Bangaioh">Bakuretsu Muteki Bangaioh</a>", which was released in September and later introduced to North America as "Bangai-O".

"Mischief Makers" received "mixed or average reviews", according to video game review score aggregator <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, and a "Gold Hall of Fame" score of 32/40 from Japanese magazine "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>". Critics praised the game's inventiveness, personality, "variety", and boss fights, and criticized its brevity, low difficulty, low <a href="replay%20value">replay value</a>, sound, and harsh introductory learning curve. Retrospective reviewers disagreed with the game's originally poor reception, and multiple reviewers noted Marina's signature "Shake, shake!" <a href="sound%20bite">sound bite</a> as a highlight. "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" awarded the game their silver award.

"<a href="IGN">IGN</a>"s Matt Casamassina said that the game compensated for its average graphics with excellent level design and gameplay challenges. He added that the game's puzzles require thought, unlike those in other action/platform games, and that the game's objectives were not clear until after the first few levels. Casamassina praised the game's transparency effects, <a href="Spatial%20anti-aliasing">anti-aliasing</a>, <a href="mipmapping">mipmapping</a>, and scaling rotations. "IGN" described anticipation for the game as "tremendous", particularly among the game's market of "younger gamers and 2D fans". "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" thought that the game was the best side-scroller since "<a href="Super%20Mario%20World">Super Mario World</a>". "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" wrote that "only diehard 2D platform fans" would be interested and did not feel that the game lived up to standards set by "<a href="Super%20Mario%2064">Mario 64</a>". In contrast, "<a href="GameFan">GameFan</a>" said that "Mischief Makers" did for 2D what "Mario 64" did for 3D, and suggested that <a href="Sega">Sega</a> should be influenced by the game. "<a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a>" retrospectively called "Mischief Makers" "pure, unadulterated awesome" and "2D brilliance". The website summarized the game to be about "grabbing sad-faced aliens, shaking them until gems come out, and then hurling them at other sad-faced aliens." Zachary Miller of "<a href="Nintendo%20World%20Report">Nintendo World Report</a>" asserted the game may be the console's most bizarre and surreal, but "<a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a>" John Harris said that the game's premise is "only strange to people who have never heard of <a href="anime">anime</a>". "GameFan" described the game as "obviously deeply Japanese", where "old school gameplay and 64-bit visuals finally meet".

<a href="Hirokazu%20Hamamura">Hirokazu Hamamura</a> of "Famitsu" commended "Mischief Makers" gameplay, which balanced its poor character design. Other "Famitsu" reviewers admired Treasure's signature robot designs and were puzzled by the company's choice to use buttons instead of the 3D <a href="analog%20stick">analog stick</a>. "<a href="Nintendo%20Life">Nintendo Life</a>" Jamie O'Neill praised the game's characters and disliked the controls. He compared the Calina character to the role of Shadow Mario in "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>". O'Neill wrote that the intricate controls were "the antithesis of a friendly, approachable, and intuitive platformer" because the game used every button on the controller (including the <a href="directional%20pad">directional pad</a>), though he felt that players who persevered through the difficult controls would find them "inventive and unique". He added that the complex controls allowed for experimentation that led to new and fun gameplay, and though the throwing enemies mechanic seemed to follow from "Gunstar Heroes", the Clanball platforming was unintuitive. John Harris of "Gamasutra" wrote that the game borrowed other elements from "Gunstar Heroes", as the games were similar in protagonists, collectible gems, and bosses. As the game took time to learn and understand, O'Neill left the reader to decide whether the game was "ultimately convoluted or bordering on sophistication and genius".

"Nintendo Life" O'Neill thought the five world bosses were among Treasure's best (in particular, the transforming "Cerberus Alpha" boss), but found the mid-level bosses uninteresting. Peter Bartholow of "<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>" and "Electronic Gaming Monthly" reviewers felt similarly. <a href="Sushi-X">Sushi-X</a> of "Electronic Gaming Monthly" added that the technique of looking for a boss's weak spot was similar to "<a href="Metroid">Metroid</a>". "Famitsu" reviewers praised how the game encouraged players to experiment with the basic "grab, throw, and shake" gameplay. They also appreciated the cadence of "Mischief Makers" short levels. O'Neill ("Nintendo Life") thought the game had great variety in gameplay mechanics (from maze puzzles to outrunning lava), graphics (from bosses that scale back the screen to levels with screen rotation), and audio (from upbeat quirk to scary), and added that he was surprised to hear critics speak against the "unique, varied, and dramatic" sound. Scott McCall of "<a href="AllGame">AllGame</a>" too appreciated the sound, from the voice to the "almost indescribable" music. "Gamasutra" John Harris noted its "tremendous variety" in gameplayfrom a "<a href="Track%20%26amp%3B%20Field%20%28video%20game%29">Track & Field</a>" remake to outrunning a missile barrageas rare for 2D platformers, and commented that "it is obvious that Treasure poured their hearts into this game."

Peter Bartholow of "GameSpot" summarized "Mischief Makers" as "a good game that will leave players wanting more". He liked the bosses, which made the player use all available skills, but felt they were short-lived and easily solved in the context of a short game with tutorials as one fifth of its levels. He did not consider the ending extension a suitable reward for returning to the levels, and predicted that most players would not finish the game more than once. "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" echoed Bartholow's comments about the game's brevity, and named the game's seven-event olympics as a highlight. Sushi-X of "Electronic Gaming Monthly" wrote that the game felt incomplete and lamented that "a decent player can finish the game in under three hours", though "Next Generation" said the game was "certainly long enough". The game's frequent reuse of a small selection of tiles, objects, sound effects, soundtracks, and bland backgrounds (compared to the "impressive" boss battle animations and effects) led "GameSpot" Bartholow to suggest that "Mischief Makers" was limited by its cartridge space. He concluded that the "decent" game would be "truly excellent ... on another medium". Zachary Miller of "Nintendo World Report" reported that the graphics did not age well into 2010. "Electronic Gaming Monthly" wrote that the game is "definitely a <a href="sleeper%20hit">sleeper hit</a>". As "<a href="Hardcore%20Gamer">Hardcore Gamer</a>" Ryan Cartmel put it, the game went "largely unnoticed".

Video game journalists from outlets such as "GamesRadar" and "Nintendo World Report" cited "Mischief Makers" as ripe for reissue either through the <a href="Nintendo%20eShop">Nintendo eShop</a> or in a sequel or franchise reboot. "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>" placed the "masterpiece of mayhem" 80th on their list of "essential" Nintendo 64 games for its "unbridled quality". In 2009, "GamesRadar" called it "possibly the most underrated and widely ignored game on the N64". The website wrote that "Mischief Makers" was received poorly because players wanted 3D instead of 2D gameplay from Nintendo 64 games. "Gamasutra"s John Harris added that those who gave it a "bum rap" missed a "surprisingly clever" game. <a href="UGO%20Networks">UGO</a> remembered the game as innovative, though imperfect, and asked to see Marina reinterpreted and resurrected in a new game.

Compsognathus

Compsognathus (; <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "kompsos"/κομψός; "elegant", "refined" or "dainty", and "gnathos"/γνάθος; "jaw") is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of small, <a href="bipedalism">bipedal</a>, <a href="carnivore">carnivorous</a> <a href="theropoda">theropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>. Members of its single <a href="species">species</a> Compsognathus longipes could grow to around the size of a <a href="turkey%20%28bird%29">turkey</a>. They lived about 150 <a href="mya%20%28unit%29">million years ago</a>, during the <a href="Tithonian">Tithonian</a> <a href="Stage%20%28stratigraphy%29">age</a> of the late <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">period</a>, in what is now Europe. Paleontologists have found two well-preserved <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s, one in Germany in the 1850s and the second in France more than a century later. Today, "C. longipes" is the only recognized species, although the larger specimen discovered in France in the 1970s was once thought to belong to a separate species and named "C. corallestris".

Many presentations still describe "Compsognathus" as "chicken-sized" dinosaurs because of the size of the German specimen, which is now believed to be a juvenile. "Compsognathus longipes" is one of the few dinosaur species whose diet is known with certainty: the remains of small, agile lizards are preserved in the bellies of both specimens. Teeth discovered in Portugal may be further fossil remains of the genus.

Although not recognized as such at the time of its discovery, "Compsognathus" is the first theropod dinosaur known from a reasonably complete fossil skeleton. Until the 1990s, it was the smallest-known non-<a href="Avialae">avialan</a> dinosaur, with the preceding centuries incorrectly labelling them as the closest relative of "<a href="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a>".

"Compsognathus" was the first dinosaur genus to be portrayed with feathers, by <a href="Thomas%20Henry%20Huxley">Thomas Henry Huxley</a> in 1876.

For decades, "Compsognathus" were famed as the smallest dinosaurs known; the first specimen collected was around in length. However, dinosaurs discovered later, such as "<a href="Caenagnathasia">Caenagnathasia</a>", "<a href="Microraptor">Microraptor</a>" and "<a href="Parvicursor">Parvicursor</a>", were even smaller. The largest "Compsognathus" specimen is estimated to have weighed somewhere between .

"Compsognathus" were small, bipedal animals with long hind legs and longer tails, which they used for balance during locomotion. The forelimbs were smaller than the hindlimbs and featured three digits equipped with solid claws suited for grasping prey. Their delicate skulls were narrow and long, with tapered snouts. The skull had five pairs of <a href="Fenestra%20%28anatomy%29">fenestrae</a> (skull openings), the largest of which was for the <a href="Orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbit</a> (eye socket), with the eyes being larger in proportion to the rest of the skull.

The lower jaw was slender and had no mandibular fenestra, a hole in the side of the lower jawbone commonly seen in <a href="archosaur">archosaur</a>s. The teeth were small but sharp, suited for its diet of small vertebrates and possibly other small animals, such as insects. Its frontmost teeth (those on the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a>) were unserrated, unlike those further back in the jaw which were flattened and more strongly recurved. Scientists have used these dental characteristics to identify "Compsognathus" and its closest relatives. Reisdorf and Wuttke (2012) described the taphonomical phenomena of the German specimen of "Compsognathus".

The "Compsognathus" specimen discovered in Germany in the 19th century featured only two digits on each forelimb, leading scientists to conclude that this was how the creature appeared in life. However, the fossil discovered later in France revealed the manus (hands) to have had three digits, similar to other members of compsognathid genera. The fossilization of the German "Compsognathus" had simply failed to preserve the specimen's hands completely. Bidar supposed that the French specimen had webbed hands, which would look like flippers in life. In the 1975 book "The Evolution and Ecology of the Dinosaurs", L. B. Halstead depicts the animal as an amphibious dinosaur capable of feeding on aquatic prey and swimming out of reach of larger predators. Ostrom debunked this <a href="hypothesis">hypothesis</a> by showing conclusively that the French specimen was nearly identical to the German specimen in every aspect but its size. Peyer confirmed these conclusions.

Some relatives of "Compsognathus", namely "<a href="Sinosauropteryx">Sinosauropteryx</a>" and "<a href="Sinocalliopteryx">Sinocalliopteryx</a>", have been preserved with the remains of simple feathers covering the body like fur, promoting some scientists to suggest that "Compsognathus" might have been feathered in a similar way. Consequently, many depictions of "Compsognathus" show them with coverings of downy proto-feathers. However, no feathers or feather-like covering have been preserved with "Compsognathus" fossils, in contrast to "Archaeopteryx", which are found in the same sediments. Karin Peyer, in 2006, reported skin impressions preserved on the side of the tail starting at the 13th tail vertebra. The impressions showed small bumpy tubercles, similar to the scales found on the tail and hind legs of "<a href="Juravenator">Juravenator</a>". Additional scales had in 1901 been reported by Von Huene, in the abdominal region of the German "Compsognathus", but Ostrom subsequently disproved this interpretation; in 2012 they were by <a href="Achim%20Reisdorf">Achim Reisdorf</a> seen as plaques of <a href="adipocere">adipocere</a>, corpse wax.

Like "Compsognathus", and unlike "Sinosauropteryx", a patch of fossilized skin from the tail and hindlimb of the possible relative "Juravenator starki" shows mainly scales, though there is some indication that simple feathers were also present in the preserved areas. This may mean that a feather covering was not ubiquitous in this group of dinosaurs.

"Compsognathus" is known from two almost complete skeletons, one from Germany that is long and another from France that is long. The physician and <a href="Fossil%20collecting">fossil collector</a> Joseph Oberndorfer acquired the German specimen (BSP AS I 563) in 1859, discovered about the same year in the lithographic <a href="limestone">limestone</a> deposits in the Riedenburg-Kelheim region of <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, in the Jurassic part of a lagoonal region known as the <a href="Solnhofen%20archipelago">Solnhofen archipelago</a>. The limestone of this area has also yielded such well-preserved fossils as "<a href="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a>" with feather impressions and some <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>s with imprints of their wing membranes. The German "Compsognathus" fossil itself most likely came from the <a href="Painten%20Formation">Painten Formation</a> of the Kapfelberg locality, specifically dated to the uppermost <a href="Kimmeridgian">Kimmeridgian</a> stage (150.8 million years ago); however, alternative possibilities include quarries near Jachenhausen or Goldberg, both from the <a href="Tithonian">Tithonian</a>, to which stage "Compsognathus" has traditionally been dated. <a href="Johann%20Andreas%20Wagner">Johann A. Wagner</a> discussed the specimen briefly in 1859, when he coined the name "Compsognathus longipes", and described it in detail in 1861. In early 1868, <a href="Thomas%20Huxley">Thomas Huxley</a> compared the two species and, following earlier suggestions by <a href="Karl%20Gegenbaur">Karl Gegenbaur</a> and <a href="Edward%20Drinker%20Cope">Edward Drinker Cope</a>, concluded that, apart from its arms and feathers, the "Archaeopteryx" skeleton was closely similar to "Compsognathus", and that the proto-bird was related to the dinosaurs. In 1896, <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Marsh</a> recognized the fossil as a true member of the Dinosauria. <a href="John%20Ostrom">John Ostrom</a> thoroughly redescribed the species in 1978, making it one of the best-known small theropods at that time. The German specimen is on display at the Bayerische Staatsammlung für Paläontologie und historische Geologie (Bavarian State Institute for Paleontology and Historical Geology) in <a href="Munich">Munich</a>, Germany, which bought the fossil from Oberndorfer in 1865.

The larger French specimen (MNHN CNJ 79) was discovered by quarry owner Louis Ghirardi around 1971 in the <a href="Portland%20stone">Portlandian</a> lithographic limestone of <a href="Canjuers">Canjuers</a> near <a href="Nice">Nice</a> in southeastern France. It dates to the lower Tithonian. Although <a href="Alain%20Bidar">Alain Bidar</a> originally described the specimen as a separate species called "Compsognathus corallestris", Ostrom, <a href="Jean-Guy%20Michard">Jean-Guy Michard</a> and others have since relabeled it as another example of "Compsognathus longipes". Quimby identified the smaller German specimen as a juvenile of the same species. In 1983, the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History%20%28France%29">National Museum of Natural History</a> in Paris acquired the French "Compsognathus" fossil; Michard thoroughly studied it there.

Collector Heinrich Fischer had originally labeled a partial foot, from the <a href="Solnhofen">Solnhofen</a> area, as belonging to "Compsognathus longipes". Though this identification was rejected by <a href="Wilhelm%20Barnim%20Dames">Wilhelm Barnim Dames</a> in 1884, <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Huene">Friedrich von Huene</a> nevertheless in 1925 provisionally referred the specimen to "Compsognathus". However, Ostrom's study of 1978 has disproven this. <a href="Jens%20Zinke">Jens Zinke</a> in 1998 assigned forty-nine teeth from the <a href="Kimmeridgian">Kimmeridgian</a> <a href="Camadas%20de%20Guimarota">Guimarota</a> formation of <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a> to the genus. These were not identical to those of "C. longipes", having serrations on the front edge, but were because of general similarities in form referred to a "Compsognathus" sp.

In 1997 <a href="Virginia%20Morell">Virginia Morell</a> renamed a related Chinese form, "Sinosauropteryx prima", into a "Compsognathus prima"; this has found no general acceptance.

The genus "Compsognathus" gives its name to the family <a href="Compsognathidae">Compsognathidae</a>, a group composed mostly of small dinosaurs from the late Jurassic and early <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> periods of China, Europe and South America. For many years it was the only member known; however, in recent decades paleontologists have discovered several related genera. The <a href="clade">clade</a> includes "<a href="Aristosuchus">Aristosuchus</a>", "<a href="Huaxiagnathus">Huaxiagnathus</a>", "<a href="Mirischia">Mirischia</a>", "<a href="Sinosauropteryx">Sinosauropteryx</a>", and perhaps "<a href="Juravenator">Juravenator</a>" and "<a href="Scipionyx">Scipionyx</a>". At one time, "<a href="Mononykus">Mononykus</a>" was proposed as a member of the family, but this was rejected by Chen and coauthors in a 1998 paper; they considered the similarities between "Mononykus" and the compsognathids to be an example of <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>. The position of "Compsognathus" and its relatives within the <a href="Coelurosauria">coelurosaur</a> group is uncertain. Some, such as theropod expert <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Holtz%20Jr.">Thomas Holtz Jr.</a> and co-authors <a href="Ralph%20Molnar">Ralph Molnar</a> and <a href="Phil%20Currie">Phil Currie</a> in the landmark 2004 text "Dinosauria", hold the family as the most <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> of the coelurosaurs, while others as part of the <a href="Maniraptora">Maniraptora</a>.

For almost a century, "Compsognathus longipes" was the only well-known small theropod species. This led to comparisons with "<a href="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a>" and to suggestions of an especially close relationship with birds. In fact, "Compsognathus", rather than "Archaeopteryx", piqued Huxley's interest in the origin of birds. The two animals share similarities in shape and proportions, so many in fact that two specimens of "Archaeopteryx", the "Eichstätt" and the "Solnhofen", were for a time misidentified as those of "Compsognathus". Many other types of theropod dinosaurs, such as <a href="maniraptora">maniraptora</a>ns, are now known to have been more closely related to birds.

Below is a simplified cladogram placing "Compsognathus" in Compsognathidae by Senter "et al." in 2012.

In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, nine foot bones referred to "Compsognathus" were examined for signs of <a href="stress%20fracture">stress fracture</a>, but none were found.

The remains of a lizard in the German specimen's thoracic cavity show that "Compsognathus" preyed on small vertebrates. Marsh, who examined the specimen in 1881, thought that this small skeleton in the "Compsognathus" belly was an embryo, but in 1903, <a href="Franz%20Nopcsa%20von%20Fels%C5%91-Szilv%C3%A1s">Franz Nopcsa</a> concluded that it was a lizard. Ostrom identified the remains as belonging to a lizard of the genus "<a href="Bavarisaurus">Bavarisaurus</a>", which he concluded was a fast and agile runner owing to its long tail and limb proportions. This in turn led to the conclusion that its predators, "Compsognathus", must have had sharp vision and the ability to rapidly accelerate and outrun the lizard. Conrad (in press) made the lizard found in the thoracic cavity of the German specimen of "Compsognathus" the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> of a new species "<a href="Schoenesmahl">Schoenesmahl</a> dyspepsia". The lizard is in a single piece, indicating that the "Compsognathus" must have swallowed its prey whole. The French specimen's gastric contents consist of unidentified lizards or <a href="Rhynchocephalia">sphenodontids</a>.

The plate of the German "Compsognathus" shows several circular irregularities in diameter near the skeletal remains. Peter Griffiths interpreted them as immature eggs in 1993. However, later researchers have doubted their connection to the genus because they were found outside the body cavity of the animal. A well-preserved fossil of a "<a href="Sinosauropteryx">Sinosauropteryx</a>", a genus related to "Compsognathus", shows two <a href="oviduct">oviduct</a>s bearing two unlaid eggs. These proportionally larger and less numerous eggs of "Sinosauropteryx" cast further doubt on the original identification of the purported "Compsognathus" eggs. In 1964 German geologist <a href="Karl%20Werner%20Barthel">Karl Werner Barthel</a> had explained the discs as gas bubbles formed in the sediment because of the putrefaction of the carcass.

During the late Jurassic, Europe was a dry, tropical <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a> at the edge of the <a href="Tethys%20Ocean">Tethys Sea</a>. The fine limestone in which the skeletons of "Compsognathus" have been found originated in <a href="calcite">calcite</a> from the shells of marine organisms. Both the German and French areas where "Compsognathus" specimens have been preserved were lagoons situated between the beaches and coral reefs of the Jurassic European islands in the Tethys Sea. Contemporaries of "Compsognathus longipes" include the early avialan "<a href="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a> lithographica" and the pterosaurs "<a href="Rhamphorhynchus">Rhamphorhynchus</a> muensteri" and "<a href="Pterodactylus">Pterodactylus</a> antiquus". The same sediments in which "Compsognathus" have been preserved also contain fossils of a number of marine animals such as fish, crustaceans, echinoderms and marine mollusks, confirming the coastal habitat of this theropod. No other dinosaur has been found in association with "Compsognathus", indicating that these little dinosaurs might in fact have been the top land predator in these islands.

Scotland national football team

The Scotland national football team represents <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> in international <a href="association%20football">football</a> and is controlled by the <a href="Scottish%20Football%20Association">Scottish Football Association</a>. It competes in the three major professional tournaments, the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">FIFA World Cup</a>, <a href="UEFA%20Nations%20League">UEFA Nations League</a> and the <a href="UEFA%20European%20Championship">UEFA European Championship</a>. Scotland, as a <a href="Countries%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">constituent country of the United Kingdom</a>, is not a member of the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> and therefore the national team does not compete in the <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a>. The majority of <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team%20home%20stadium">Scotland's home matches</a> are played at the national stadium, <a href="Hampden%20Park">Hampden Park</a>.

Scotland is the joint oldest national football team in the world, alongside <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a>, whom they played in the world's <a href="1872%20Scotland%20vs%20England%20football%20match">first international football match</a> in <a href="1872%20in%20sports">1872</a>. Scotland has a long-standing <a href="England%E2%80%93Scotland%20football%20rivalry">rivalry with England</a>, whom they played annually from 1872 until 1989. The teams have met only seven times since then, most recently in June 2017.

Scotland have qualified for the FIFA World Cup on eight occasions and the UEFA European Championship twice, but have never progressed beyond the first group stage of a finals tournament. The last major tournament they qualified for was the <a href="1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1998 World Cup</a>. The team have achieved some noteworthy results, such as beating the <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966 FIFA World Cup</a> winners England 3–2 at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> in 1967. <a href="Archie%20Gemmill">Archie Gemmill</a> scored what has been described as one of the greatest World Cup goals ever in a 3–2 win during the <a href="1978%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1978 World Cup</a> against the <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Netherlands</a>, who reached the final of the tournament. In their qualifying group for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202008">UEFA Euro 2008</a>, Scotland defeated <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 World Cup</a> runners-up <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a> 1–0 in both fixtures.

Scotland supporters are collectively known as the <a href="Tartan%20Army">Tartan Army</a>. The Scottish Football Association operates a <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team%20roll%20of%20honour">roll of honour</a> for every player who has made more than 50 <a href="cap%20%28sport%29">appearances</a> for Scotland. <a href="Kenny%20Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a> holds the record for Scotland appearances, having played 102 times between 1971 and 1986. Dalglish scored 30 goals for Scotland and shares the record for most goals scored with <a href="Denis%20Law">Denis Law</a>.

Scotland and <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> are the oldest national football teams in the world. Teams representing the two sides first competed at <a href="the%20Oval">the Oval</a> in <a href="England%20v%20Scotland%20representative%20football%20matches%20%281870%E2%80%9372%29">five matches</a> between 1870 and 1872. The two countries contested <a href="1872%20Scotland%20vs%20England%20football%20match">the first official international football match</a>, at <a href="Hamilton%20Crescent">Hamilton Crescent</a> in <a href="Partick">Partick</a>, Scotland, on 30 November 1872. The match ended in a goalless draw. All eleven players who represented Scotland that day played for <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> amateur club <a href="Queen%27s%20Park%20F.C.">Queen's Park</a>. Over the next forty years, Scotland played matches exclusively against the other three <a href="Home%20Nations">Home Nations</a>—England, <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Wales</a> and <a href="Ireland%20national%20football%20team%20%281882%E2%80%931950%29">Ireland</a>. The <a href="British%20Home%20Championship">British Home Championship</a> began in 1883, making these games competitive. The encounters against England were particularly fierce and a <a href="England%E2%80%93Scotland%20football%20rivalry">rivalry</a> quickly developed.

Scotland lost just two of their first 43 international matches. It was not until a 2–0 home defeat by Ireland in 1903 that Scotland lost a match to a team other than England. This run of success meant that Scotland would have regularly topped the <a href="World%20Football%20Elo%20Ratings">Elo ratings</a>, which were calculated in 1998, between 1876 and 1904. Scotland won the British Home Championship outright on 24 occasions, and shared the title 17 times with at least one other team. A noteworthy victory for Scotland before the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> was the 5–1 victory over England in 1928, which led to that Scotland side being known as the "<a href="Wembley%20Wizards">Wembley Wizards</a>". Scotland played their first match outside the British Isles in 1929, beating <a href="Norway%20national%20football%20team">Norway</a> 7–3 in <a href="Bergen%2C%20Norway">Bergen</a>. Scotland continued to contest regular <a href="exhibition%20game">friendly matches</a> against European opposition and enjoyed wins against <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany</a> and <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a> before losing to the <a href="Austria%20national%20football%20team">Austrian</a> "<a href="Wunderteam">Wunderteam</a>" and <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italy</a> in 1931.

Scotland, like the other Home Nations, did not enter the three <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">FIFA World Cup</a>s held during the 1930s. This was because the four associations had been excluded from <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a> due to a disagreement regarding the status of amateur players. The four associations, including Scotland, returned to the FIFA fold after the Second World War. A match between a <a href="United%20Kingdom%20national%20football%20team">United Kingdom team</a> and a "Rest of the World" team was played at <a href="Hampden%20Park">Hampden Park</a> in 1947 to celebrate this reconciliation.

The readmission of the <a href="Scottish%20Football%20Association">Scottish Football Association</a> to FIFA meant that Scotland were now eligible to enter the <a href="1950%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1950 FIFA World Cup</a>. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the <a href="1950%20British%20Home%20Championship">1950 British Home Championship</a>, but the SFA announced that Scotland would only attend the finals if Scotland won the competition. Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1–0 home defeat by <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> meant that the Scots finished as runners-up. This meant that the Scots had qualified by right for the World Cup, but had not met the demand of the SFA to win the Championship. The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain <a href="Billy%20Wright%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201924%29">Billy Wright</a> and the other England players. The SFA instead sent the Scots on a tour of North America.

The same qualification rules were in place for the <a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1954 FIFA World Cup</a>, with the <a href="1954%20British%20Home%20Championship">1954 British Home Championship</a> acting as a qualifying group. Scotland again finished second, but this time the SFA allowed a team to participate in the Finals, held in Switzerland. To quote the SFA website, "The preparation was atrocious". The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals, even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads. Despite this self-imposed hardship in terms of players, the SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers, accompanied by their wives. Scotland lost 1–0 against <a href="Austria%20national%20football%20team">Austria</a> in their first game in the finals, which prompted the team <a href="Manager%20%28association%20football%29">manager</a> <a href="Andy%20Beattie">Andy Beattie</a> to resign hours before the game against <a href="Uruguay%20national%20football%20team">Uruguay</a>. Uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the World Cup finals, and they defeated Scotland 7–0.

The <a href="1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1958 FIFA World Cup</a> finals saw Scotland draw their first game against <a href="Yugoslavia%20national%20football%20team">Yugoslavia</a> 1–1, but they then lost to <a href="Paraguay%20national%20football%20team">Paraguay</a> and <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a> and went out at the first stage. <a href="Matt%20Busby">Matt Busby</a> had been due to manage the team at the World Cup, but the severe injuries he suffered in the <a href="Munich%20air%20disaster">Munich air disaster</a> meant that trainer <a href="Dawson%20Walker">Dawson Walker</a> took charge of the team instead.

Under the management of <a href="Ian%20McColl">Ian McColl</a>, Scotland enjoyed consecutive British Home Championship successes in <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20British%20Home%20Championship">1962</a> and <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20British%20Home%20Championship">1963</a>. <a href="Jock%20Stein">Jock Stein</a>, <a href="John%20Prentice%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201926%29">John Prentice</a> and <a href="Malky%20MacDonald">Malky MacDonald</a> all had brief spells as manager before <a href="Bobby%20Brown%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201923%29">Bobby Brown</a> was appointed in 1967. Brown's first match as manager was against the <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">newly crowned world champions</a> England at Wembley Stadium. Despite being underdogs, Scotland won 3–2 thanks to goals from <a href="Denis%20Law">Denis Law</a>, <a href="Bobby%20Lennox">Bobby Lennox</a> and <a href="Jim%20McCalliog">Jim McCalliog</a>. Having defeated the world champions on their own turf, the Scotland fans hailed their team as the "<a href="Unofficial%20Football%20World%20Championships">unofficial world champions</a>". Despite this famous win, the Scots failed to qualify for any major competitions during the 1960s.

After <a href="Tommy%20Docherty">Tommy Docherty</a>'s brief spell as manager, <a href="Willie%20Ormond">Willie Ormond</a> was hired in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5–0 to England, but recovered to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1974 World Cup</a> finals in <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament. The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a>. After beating <a href="DR%20Congo%20national%20football%20team">Zaïre</a>, they drew with both <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a> and <a href="Yugoslavia%20national%20football%20team">Yugoslavia</a>, and went out because they had beaten Zaïre by the smallest margin.

Scotland appointed <a href="Ally%20MacLeod">Ally MacLeod</a> as manager in 1977, with qualification for the <a href="1978%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1978 World Cup</a> in <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> far from assured. The team made a strong start under MacLeod by winning the <a href="1977%20British%20Home%20Championship">1977 British Home Championship</a>, largely thanks to a 2–1 victory over England at Wembley. The <a href="Tartan%20Army">Scotland fans</a> invaded the pitch after the match, ripping up the turf and breaking a crossbar. Scotland's good form continued as they secured qualification for the World Cup with victories over <a href="Czechoslovakia%20national%20football%20team">Czechoslovakia</a> and <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Wales</a>.

During the build-up to the <a href="1978%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1978 FIFA World Cup</a>, MacLeod fuelled the hopes of the nation by stating that Scotland would come home with a medal. As the squad left for the finals in Argentina, they were given an enthusiastic send-off as they were paraded around a packed <a href="Hampden%20Park">Hampden Park</a>. Thousands more fans lined the route to <a href="Glasgow%20Prestwick%20International%20Airport">Prestwick Airport</a> as the team set off for <a href="South%20America">South America</a>. Scotland's first game was against <a href="Peru%20national%20football%20team">Peru</a> in <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Argentina">Córdoba</a>. Two spectacular goals by <a href="Te%C3%B3filo%20Cubillas">Teófilo Cubillas</a> meant that the result was a 3–1 loss. The second game was a very disappointing 1–1 draw against newcomers <a href="Iran%20national%20football%20team">Iran</a>. The disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in the <a href="Technical%20area">dugout</a> with his head in his hands.

After taking a single point from their opening two games, Scotland had to defeat the <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Netherlands</a> by three clear goals to progress. Despite the Dutch taking the lead, Scotland fought back to win 3–2 with a goal from <a href="Kenny%20Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a> and two from <a href="Archie%20Gemmill">Archie Gemmill</a>, the second of which is considered one of the greatest World Cup goals ever; Gemmill beat three Dutch defenders before lifting the ball over goalkeeper <a href="Jan%20Jongbloed">Jan Jongbloed</a> into the net. The victory was not sufficient to secure a place in the second round, and Scotland were eliminated on goal difference for the second successive World Cup.

MacLeod resigned as manager shortly after the 1978 World Cup, and <a href="Jock%20Stein">Jock Stein</a>, who had won nine consecutive <a href="list%20of%20Scottish%20football%20champions">Scottish league titles</a> and the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> as manager of <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a>, was appointed as his successor. After failing to qualify for the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201980">1980 European Championship</a>, Scotland qualified for the <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1982 FIFA World Cup</a> from a tough group including <a href="Sweden%20national%20football%20team">Sweden</a>, <a href="Portugal%20national%20football%20team">Portugal</a>, <a href="Israel%20national%20football%20team">Israel</a> and <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Northern Ireland</a>, losing just one match in the process. They beat <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20football%20team">New Zealand</a> 5–2 in their first game at the World Cup, but lost 4–1 to a <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a> team containing <a href="S%C3%B3crates">Sócrates</a>, <a href="Zico">Zico</a>, <a href="%C3%89der%20Aleixo%20de%20Assis">Eder</a> and <a href="Paulo%20Roberto%20Falc%C3%A3o">Falcão</a>. Scotland were again eliminated on goal difference, after a 2–2 draw with the <a href="Soviet%20Union%20national%20football%20team">Soviet Union</a>.

Scotland qualified for the <a href="1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1986 FIFA World Cup</a>, their fourth in succession, in traumatic circumstances. The squad went into their <a href="1985%20Wales%20vs%20Scotland%20football%20match">last qualification match against Wales</a> needing a point to progress to a qualifying playoff against <a href="Australia%20national%20association%20football%20team">Australia</a>. With only nine minutes remaining and Wales leading 1–0, Scotland were awarded a <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty kick</a>, which was calmly scored by <a href="Davie%20Cooper">Davie Cooper</a>. The 1–1 draw meant that Scotland progressed, but as the players and fans celebrated, Stein suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards. His assistant <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a> took over. Scotland qualified by winning 2–0 against Australia in a two-leg playoff, but were eliminated from the tournament with just one point from their three matches, a goalless draw with <a href="Uruguay%20national%20football%20team">Uruguay</a> following defeats by <a href="Denmark%20national%20football%20team">Denmark</a> and <a href="West%20Germany%20national%20football%20team">West Germany</a>.

In July 1986, <a href="Andy%20Roxburgh">Andy Roxburgh</a> was the surprise appointment as the new manager of Scotland. Scotland did not succeed in qualifying for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201988">Euro 1988</a>, but their 1–0 away win over <a href="Bulgaria%20national%20football%20team">Bulgaria</a> in the final fixture in November 1987 helped <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Ireland</a> to a surprise first-place finish and qualification for the finals in <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>.

Scotland qualified for their fifth consecutive <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup in 1990</a> by finishing second in their qualifying group, ahead of <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a>. Scotland were drawn in a group with <a href="Costa%20Rica%20national%20football%20team">Costa Rica</a>, Sweden, and Brazil, but the Scots lost 1–0 to Costa Rica. While they recovered to beat Sweden 2–1 in their second game, they lost to Brazil in their third match 1–0 and were again eliminated after the first round.

By a narrow margin, Scotland qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20European%20Championship">UEFA European Championship</a> for the first time in <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201992">1992</a>. A 1–0 defeat by <a href="Romania%20national%20football%20team">Romania</a> away from home left qualification dependent upon other results, but a 1–1 draw between <a href="Bulgaria%20national%20football%20team">Bulgaria</a> and Romania in the final group match saw Scotland squeeze through. Despite playing well in matches against the Netherlands and Germany and a fine win against the <a href="CIS%20national%20football%20team">CIS</a>, the team was knocked out at the group stage. Scotland failed to qualify for the <a href="1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1994 FIFA World Cup</a>. The team finished fourth in their <a href="1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28UEFA%29">qualifying group</a> behind <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italy</a>, <a href="Switzerland%20national%20football%20team">Switzerland</a> and Portugal. When it became clear that Scotland could not qualify, <a href="Andy%20Roxburgh">Andy Roxburgh</a> resigned from his position as team manager.
New manager <a href="Craig%20Brown%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201940%29">Craig Brown</a> successfully guided Scotland to the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201996">1996 European Championship</a> tournament. The first game against the Netherlands ended 0–0, raising morale ahead of a much anticipated game against England at Wembley. <a href="Gary%20McAllister">Gary McAllister</a> missed a penalty kick, and a goal by <a href="Paul%20Gascoigne">Paul Gascoigne</a> led to a 2–0 defeat. Scotland recovered to beat <a href="Switzerland%20national%20football%20team">Switzerland</a> 1–0 with a goal by <a href="Ally%20McCoist">Ally McCoist</a>. England taking a 4–0 lead in the other match briefly put both teams in a position to qualify, but a late goal for the <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Netherlands</a> meant that Scotland were knocked out on goals scored.

Brown again guided Scotland to qualification for a major tournament in 1998, and Scotland were drawn against Brazil in the opening game of the <a href="1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1998 World Cup</a>. <a href="John%20Collins%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201968%29">John Collins</a> equalised from the penalty spot to level the score at 1–1, but a <a href="Tom%20Boyd%20%28Scottish%20footballer%29">Tom Boyd</a> <a href="own%20goal">own goal</a> led to a 2–1 defeat. Scotland drew their next game 1–1 with Norway in <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, but the final match against <a href="Morocco%20national%20football%20team">Morocco</a> ended in an embarrassing 3–0 defeat.

During the qualification for the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202000">2000 European Championship</a>, Scotland faced England in a <a href="two-legged%20tie">two-legged</a> playoff nicknamed the "Battle of Britain" by the media. Scotland won the second match 1–0 with a goal by <a href="Don%20Hutchison">Don Hutchison</a>, but lost the tie 2–1 on aggregate.

Scotland failed to qualify for the <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2002 FIFA World Cup</a>, finishing third in their qualifying group behind <a href="Croatia%20national%20football%20team">Croatia</a> and <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium</a>. This second successive failure to qualify prompted Craig Brown to resign from his position after the final qualifying match. The <a href="Scottish%20Football%20Association">SFA</a> appointed former Germany manager <a href="Berti%20Vogts">Berti Vogts</a> as Brown's successor. Scotland reached the qualification play-offs for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202004">Euro 2004</a>. Scotland beat the <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Netherlands</a> 1–0 at Hampden Park, but suffered a 6–0 defeat in the return leg. Poor results in friendly matches and a bad start to the 2006 World Cup qualification caused the team to drop to a record low of 77th in the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Rankings">FIFA World Rankings</a>. Vogts announced his resignation in 2004, blaming the hostile media for his departure.

<a href="Walter%20Smith">Walter Smith</a>, a former <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> and <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> manager, was brought in to replace Vogts. Improved results meant that Scotland rose up the FIFA rankings and won the <a href="Kirin%20Cup">Kirin Cup</a>, a friendly competition in Japan. Scotland failed to qualify for the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a>, finishing third in their group behind <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italy</a> and <a href="Norway%20national%20football%20team">Norway</a>. Smith left the national side in January 2007 to return to <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a>, with Scotland leading their <a href="2008%20UEFA%20European%20Championship">Euro 2008</a> qualification group. <a href="Alex%20McLeish">Alex McLeish</a> was named as Smith's successor and Scotland's twentieth manager. McLeish guided Scotland to wins against <a href="Georgia%20national%20football%20team">Georgia</a>, the <a href="Faroe%20Islands%20national%20football%20team">Faroe Islands</a>, <a href="Lithuania%20national%20football%20team">Lithuania</a>, France and <a href="Ukraine%20national%20football%20team">Ukraine</a>, but defeats by Georgia and Italy ended their chances of qualification for Euro 2008. These improved results, particularly the wins against France, lifted Scotland into the top 20 of the FIFA world rankings.

After the narrow failure to qualify for Euro 2008, McLeish left to join <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> club <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a>. <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> manager <a href="George%20Burley">George Burley</a> was hired as the new manager, but he came in for criticism from the media after the team lost their first qualifier against <a href="Macedonia%20national%20football%20team">Macedonia</a>. After Scotland lost their fourth match 3–0 to the Netherlands, captain <a href="Barry%20Ferguson">Barry Ferguson</a> and goalkeeper <a href="Allan%20McGregor">Allan McGregor</a> were excluded from the starting lineup for the following match against <a href="Iceland%20national%20football%20team">Iceland</a> due to a "breach of discipline". Despite winning 2–1 against Iceland, Scotland suffered a terrible 4–0 defeat by Norway in the following qualifier, which left Scotland effectively needing to win their last two games to have a realistic chance of making the qualifying play-offs. Scotland defeated Macedonia 2–0 in the first of those two games, but were eliminated by a 1–0 loss to the Netherlands in the second game. Burley was allowed to continue in his post after a review by the SFA board, but a subsequent 3–0 friendly defeat by Wales led to the SFA sacking him.

The SFA appointed <a href="Craig%20Levein">Craig Levein</a> as head coach of the national team in December 2009. In <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202012%20qualifying">UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying</a>, Scotland were grouped with <a href="Lithuania%20national%20football%20team">Lithuania</a>, <a href="Liechtenstein%20national%20football%20team">Liechtenstein</a>, the <a href="Czech%20Republic%20national%20football%20team">Czech Republic</a> and world champions <a href="Spain%20national%20football%20team">Spain</a>. They took just four points from the first four games, leaving the team needing three wins from their remaining four games to have a realistic chance of progression. They only managed two wins and a draw and were eliminated after a 3–1 defeat by Spain in their last match. Levein left his position as head coach following a poor start to <a href="2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">2014 FIFA World Cup qualification</a>, having taken just two points from four games.

<a href="Gordon%20Strachan">Gordon Strachan</a> was appointed Scotland manager in January 2013, but defeats in his first two competitive matches meant that Scotland were the first UEFA team to be eliminated from the 2014 World Cup. Scotland finished their qualification section by winning three of their last four matches, including two victories against <a href="Croatia%20national%20football%20team">Croatia</a>. In <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202016%20qualifying">UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying</a>, Scotland appeared to have a better chance of qualification as the finals tournament was expanded from 16 teams to 24. After losing their opening match in <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany</a>, Scotland recorded home wins against <a href="Georgia%20national%20football%20team">Georgia</a>, the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Republic of Ireland</a> and <a href="Gibraltar%20national%20football%20team">Gibraltar</a>. <a href="Steven%20Fletcher%20%28footballer%29">Steven Fletcher</a> scored the first <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> for Scotland since 1969 in the game with Gibraltar. Later in the group, Scotland produced an "insipid" performance as they lost 1–0 in Georgia. A home defeat by Germany and a late equalising goal by <a href="Poland%20national%20football%20team">Poland</a> eliminated Scotland from contention. After a win against Gibraltar in the last qualifier, Strachan agreed a new contract with the SFA.

In <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28UEFA%29">qualification</a> for the <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2018 FIFA World Cup</a>, Scotland were drawn in the same group as England, facing their rivals in a competitive fixture for the first time since 1999. On 11 November 2016, England beat Scotland 3–0 at Wembley. The return match saw <a href="Leigh%20Griffiths">Leigh Griffiths</a> score two late free-kicks to give Scotland a 2–1 lead, but <a href="Harry%20Kane">Harry Kane</a> scored in added time to force a 2–2 draw. A draw in <a href="Slovenia%20national%20football%20team">Slovenia</a> in the final game of the group ended Scottish hopes of a play-off position, and Strachan subsequently left his position by mutual consent. In February 2018, Alex McLeish was appointed manager for the second time.

Scotland did not compete in the first three World Cup competitions, held in <a href="1930%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1930</a>, <a href="1934%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1934</a> and <a href="1938%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1938</a>. <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a> ruled that all its member associations must provide "broken-time" payments to cover the expenses of players who participated in <a href="football%20at%20the%201928%20Summer%20Olympics">football at the 1928 Summer Olympics</a>. In response to what they considered to be unacceptable interference, the football associations of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales held a meeting at which they agreed to resign from FIFA. The <a href="Scottish%20Football%20Association">Scottish Football Association</a> did not rejoin FIFA as a permanent member until 1946. The SFA declined to participate in <a href="1950%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1950</a> although they had qualified, as Scotland were not the <a href="British%20Home%20Championship">British champions</a>.

Scotland have since qualified for eight finals tournaments, including five consecutive tournaments from <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1974</a> to <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1990</a>. Scotland have never advanced beyond the first round of the finals competition – no country has qualified for as many World Cup finals without progressing past the first round. They have missed out on progressing to the second round three times on goal difference: in <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1974</a>, when <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a> edged them out; in <a href="1978%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1978</a>, when the <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Netherlands</a> progressed; and in <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1982</a>, when the <a href="Soviet%20Union%20national%20football%20team">Soviet Union</a> went through.

Scotland have qualified for two <a href="UEFA%20European%20Championship">European Championships</a>, but have failed to advance beyond the first round on both occasions. Their most recent participation was at the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201996">1996 European Championship</a>, where the Netherlands progressed instead of Scotland on <a href="goal%20difference">goals scored</a>. Scotland is due to host three group games and a last 16 match in <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202020">UEFA Euro 2020</a>, which is being held at venues across Europe.

When the <a href="UEFA%20Nations%20League">UEFA Nations League</a> was inaugurated in <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Nations%20League">2018–19</a>, Scotland were allocated to <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Nations%20League%20C">League C</a>. With a 3–2 win against <a href="Israel%20national%20football%20team">Israel</a> in their final match, Scotland won promotion to <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20UEFA%20Nations%20League%20B">League B</a> of the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20UEFA%20Nations%20League">2020–21</a> competition.


<a href="Hampden%20Park">Hampden Park</a> in Glasgow is the traditional home of the Scotland team and is described by the SFA as the National Stadium. The present stadium is one of three stadiums to have used the name. Stadiums named Hampden Park have hosted international matches since 1878. The present site was opened in 1903 and became the primary home ground of the Scotland team from 1906. The attendance record of 149,415 was set by the Scotland v England match in 1937. Safety regulations reduced the capacity to 81,000 by 1977 and the stadium was completely redeveloped during the 1990s, giving the present capacity of 52,000. Hampden is rated as a category four (elite) stadium within the <a href="UEFA%20stadium%20categories">UEFA stadium categories</a>, having previously held the five-star status under the old rating system.

Some <a href="exhibition%20game">friendly match</a>es are played at smaller venues. <a href="Pittodrie%20Stadium">Pittodrie Stadium</a> in <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> and <a href="Easter%20Road">Easter Road</a> in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> were both used as venues during the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20in%20Scottish%20football">2012–13 season</a>. Other stadiums were also used while Hampden was being redeveloped during the 1990s. <a href="Celtic%20Park">Celtic Park</a>, Pittodrie Stadium, <a href="Ibrox%20Stadium">Ibrox Stadium</a> and <a href="Rugby%20Park">Rugby Park</a> all hosted matches during the <a href="1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1998 World Cup</a> qualifying campaign, while <a href="Tynecastle%20Stadium">Tynecastle Stadium</a>, Pittodrie, Celtic Park and Ibrox were used for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202000">Euro 2000</a> qualifying matches. Since the last redevelopment to Hampden was completed in 1999, Scotland have played most of their competitive matches there. The most recent exception to this rule was in 2014, when Hampden was temporarily converted into an athletics stadium for the <a href="2014%20Commonwealth%20Games">2014 Commonwealth Games</a>.

Scotland's home matches are presently covered by the pay-TV broadcaster <a href="Sky%20Sports">Sky Sports</a>. Television rights to away games vary, although Sky Sports also held the rights to both home and away qualifiers for Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup. The arrangements to show Scotland matches on pay-TV have been criticised by the <a href="Scottish%20Government">Scottish Government</a>, who have argued that qualifying matches should be included in the <a href="Ofcom%20Code%20on%20Sports%20and%20Other%20Listed%20and%20Designated%20Events">list of sporting events</a> which can only be broadcast on free-to-air television. The SFA have argued that limiting the rights to <a href="free-to-air">free-to-air</a> broadcasters would severely reduce the amount of revenue that they could generate. An independent advisory panel recommended that qualifying matches played by all four Home Nations be added to the list, but <a href="Minister%20for%20Sport%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">UK Sports Minister</a> <a href="Hugh%20Robertson%20%28politician%29">Hugh Robertson</a> deferred a decision until the completion of the <a href="digital%20television%20transition">digital switchover</a>.

<a href="BBC%20Scotland">BBC Scotland</a>, <a href="STV%20%28TV%20channel%29">STV</a>, <a href="Setanta%20Sports">Setanta Sports</a>, <a href="Channel%205%20%28UK%29">Channel 5</a> and <a href="BT%20Sport">BT Sport</a> are among other networks that have previously shown live fixtures. All matches are broadcast with full commentary on <a href="BBC%20Radio%20Scotland">BBC Radio Scotland</a> and, when schedules allow, <a href="BBC%20Radio%205%20Live">BBC Radio 5 Live</a> also.

Scotland traditionally wear dark blue shirts with white shorts and dark blue socks, the colours of the <a href="Queen%27s%20Park%20F.C.">Queen's Park</a> team who represented Scotland in the first international. The blue Scotland shirt was earlier used in a February 1872 <a href="rugby%20union">rugby</a> international, with reports stating that "the scotch were easily distinguishable by their uniform of blue jerseys... the jerseys having the <a href="thistle">thistle</a> embroidered". The thistle had previously been worn to represent Scotland in the 1871 rugby international, but on "brown" shirts. The shirt is embroidered with a crest based upon the lion rampant of the <a href="Royal%20Standard%20of%20Scotland">Royal Standard of Scotland</a>.

Scotland have not always played in dark blue; on a number of occasions between 1881 and 1951 they played in the primrose and pink racing colours of <a href="Archibald%20Primrose%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Rosebery">Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery</a>. A former <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, Lord Rosebery was an influential figure in Scottish football, serving as honorary President of the SFA and <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> team <a href="Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.">Hearts</a>. His colours were used most frequently in the first decade of the 20th century, but were discontinued in 1909. The colours were briefly reprised in 1949, and were last used against <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a> in 1951. In 1900, when Scotland defeated England 4–1, Lord Rosebery remarked, "I have never seen my colours so well sported since <a href="Ladas%20%28horse%29">Ladas</a> won the <a href="Epsom%20Derby">Derby</a>". Rosebery colours were revived as a <a href="away%20colours">change kit</a> for the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202016%20qualifying">UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying</a> matches.

The current version of the crest is a roundel similar to the crest used from 1961 to 1988 enclosing a shield, with "Scotland" written on the top and "Est 1873" on the bottom. In the shield background there are 11 thistles, representing the national flower of Scotland, in addition to the lion rampant. Since 2005, the SFA have supported the use of <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a> on the national team's strip in recognition of the language's revival in Scotland.

Scotland fans are collectively known as the <a href="Tartan%20Army">Tartan Army</a>. During the 1970s, Scotland fans became known for their <a href="football%20hooligan">hooliganism</a> in England, particularly after they <a href="pitch%20invasion">invaded</a> the <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a> pitch and destroyed the goalposts after the England v Scotland match in 1977. Since then, the Tartan Army have won awards from <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> for their combination of vocal support, friendly nature and charity work. The Tartan Army have been awarded a <a href="Sportsmanship">Fair Play</a> prize by the <a href="Belgium%20at%20the%20Olympics">Belgian Olympic Committee</a> and were named as the best supporters during the <a href="1992%20UEFA%20European%20Championship">1992 European Championship</a>. The fans were also presented with a trophy for non-violence in sport and were voted by journalists to be the best supporters for their sense of fair play and sporting spirit at the <a href="1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1998 World Cup</a> in France.

The following players were called up for the matches against <a href="Kazakhstan%20national%20football%20team">Kazakhstan</a> and <a href="San%20Marino%20national%20football%20team">San Marino</a> in March 2019.

The following players have also been selected by Scotland in the past 12 months.

The <a href="Scottish%20Football%20Association">Scottish Football Association</a> operates a <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team%20roll%20of%20honour">roll of honour</a> for every player who has made more than 50 appearances for Scotland. there are 31 members of this roll, with <a href="Craig%20Gordon">Craig Gordon</a> the most recent addition to the list. The qualifying mark of 50 appearances means that many notable Scotland players including <a href="Jim%20Baxter">Jim Baxter</a>, <a href="Hughie%20Gallacher">Hughie Gallacher</a>, <a href="John%20Greig">John Greig</a>, <a href="Jimmy%20Johnstone">Jimmy Johnstone</a>, <a href="Billy%20McNeill">Billy McNeill</a>, <a href="Bobby%20Murdoch">Bobby Murdoch</a>, <a href="Archie%20Gemmill">Archie Gemmill</a> and <a href="Lawrie%20Reilly">Lawrie Reilly</a> are not on the roll of honour.

The <a href="Scottish%20Football%20Museum">Scottish Football Museum</a> operates a <a href="Scottish%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">hall of fame</a> which is open to players and managers involved in <a href="football%20in%20Scotland">Scottish football</a>. This means that membership is not restricted to people who have played for Scotland; inductees include <a href="Brian%20Laudrup">Brian Laudrup</a> and <a href="Henrik%20Larsson">Henrik Larsson</a>. At the most recent induction ceremony, <a href="Alan%20Rough">Alan Rough</a>, <a href="Martin%20Buchan">Martin Buchan</a>, <a href="Eddie%20Gray%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201948%29">Eddie Gray</a>, <a href="Tommy%20Docherty">Tommy Docherty</a>, <a href="Scot%20Symon">Scot Symon</a> and <a href="Bobby%20Walker%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201879%29">Bobby Walker</a> were added to its membership. <a href="Sportscotland">Sportscotland</a> operates the <a href="Scottish%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Scottish Sports Hall of Fame</a>, which has <a href="Scottish%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame%23Football">inducted some footballers</a>.

From 1872 to 1953, and 1954 to 1957, the Scotland national team was appointed by a selection committee. <a href="Andy%20Beattie">Andy Beattie</a> was manager for six matches in 1954 when Scotland competed at their first World Cup. After the tournament the selection committee resumed their duties, continuing until the appointment of <a href="Matt%20Busby">Matt Busby</a> in 1958. Busby was initially unable to assume his duties due to the serious injuries he sustained in the <a href="Munich%20air%20disaster">Munich air disaster</a>.

Statistically the most successful manager was <a href="Alex%20McLeish">Alex McLeish</a>, who won seven of the ten games during his first spell as manager. Discounting managers who took charge of less than ten games, the least successful manager was <a href="George%20Burley">George Burley</a>, with just three wins in 14 games.

<a href="Kenny%20Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a> holds the record for Scotland appearances, having played 102 times between 1971 and 1986. He is the only Scotland player to have reached 100 <a href="cap%20%28sport%29">caps</a>. <a href="Jim%20Leighton">Jim Leighton</a> is second, having played 91 times, a Scottish record for appearances by a <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a>. The title of Scotland's highest goalscorer is shared by two players. <a href="Denis%20Law">Denis Law</a> scored 30 goals between 1958 and 1974, during which time he played for Scotland on 55 occasions. <a href="Kenny%20Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a> scored an equal number from 102 appearances. <a href="Hughie%20Gallacher">Hughie Gallacher</a> as well as being the third highest scorer is also the most prolific with his 24 goals coming from only 20 games (averaging 1.2 goals per game).

The largest margin of victory achieved by a Scotland side is 11–0 against <a href="Ireland%20national%20football%20team%20%28IFA%29">Ireland</a> in the <a href="1901%20British%20Home%20Championship">1901 British Home Championship</a>. The record defeat occurred during the <a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1954 FIFA World Cup</a>, a 7–0 deficit against reigning world champions <a href="Uruguay%20national%20football%20team">Uruguay</a>.

Scotland's <a href="1937%20British%20Home%20Championship">1937 British Home Championship</a> match against England set a new world record for a football attendance. The Hampden Park crowd was officially recorded as 149,415, though the true figure is unknown as a large number of additional fans gained unauthorised entry. This attendance was surpassed 13 years later by the <a href="Uruguay%20v%20Brazil%20%281950%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%29">decisive match</a> of the <a href="1950%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1950 FIFA World Cup</a>, but remains a European record.

Scotland has always participated by itself in most of the major tournaments, such as the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> and the <a href="UEFA%20European%20Championship">UEFA European Championship</a>. At the <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a> the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> charter only permit a <a href="Great%20Britain%20Olympic%20football%20team">Great Britain Olympic football team</a>, representing the whole of the United Kingdom, to compete. Teams of amateur players represented <a href="Great%20Britain%20at%20the%20Olympics">Great Britain at the Olympics</a> from 1900 until 1972, but the FA stopped entering a team after then because the distinction between amateur and professional was abolished. The <a href="London%202012%20Olympic%20bid">successful bid</a> by London for the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a> prompted the FA to explore how a team could be entered. The SFA responded by stating that it would not participate, as it feared that this would threaten the independent status of the Scotland national team. <a href="President%20of%20FIFA">FIFA President</a> <a href="Sepp%20Blatter">Sepp Blatter</a> denied this, but the SFA expressed concern that a future President could take a different view. An agreement was reached in May 2009 whereby the FA would be permitted to organise a team using only England-qualified players, but this was successfully challenged by the <a href="British%20Olympic%20Association">British Olympic Association</a>. Only English and Welsh players were selected for the men's squad, but two Scottish players were selected for the <a href="Great%20Britain%20women%27s%20Olympic%20football%20team">women's team</a>.

Wood stork

The wood stork ("Mycteria americana") is a large <a href="Americas">American</a> wading <a href="bird">bird</a> in the <a href="Ciconiiformes">stork</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Ciconiidae. It was formerly called the "wood ibis", though it is not an <a href="ibis">ibis</a>. It is found in subtropical and tropical habitats in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>, including the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. In South America, it is resident, but in North America, it may disperse to as far as South America. Originally described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in 1758, this stork likely evolved in tropical regions. The head and neck are bare of feathers and dark grey in colour. The plumage is mostly white, with the exception of the tail and some of the wing feathers, which are black with a greenish-purplish sheen. The juvenile differs from the adult, with the former having a feathered head and a yellow bill, compared to the black adult bill. The sexes are similar.

The habitat of the wood stork can vary, but it must have a tropical or subtropical climate with fluctuating water levels. The in diameter nest is found in trees, especially <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a>s and those of the genus "<a href="Taxodium">Taxodium</a>", usually surrounded by water or over water. The wood stork nests colonially. The nest itself is made from sticks and greenery. During the breeding season, which is initiated when the water levels drop and can occur anytime between November and August, a single <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> of three to five eggs is laid. These are incubated for around 30 days, and the chicks hatch altricial. They fledge 60 to 65 days after hatching, although only about 31% of nests fledge a chick in any given year, with most chicks dying during their first two weeks, despite being watched by an adult during that time. The chicks are fed fish of increasing size. The diet of the adult changes throughout the year. During the dry season, fish and insects are eaten, compared to the addition of frogs and crabs during the wet season. Because it forages by touch, it needs shallow water to effectively catch food. This is also the reason why the wood stork breeds when water levels start to fall.

Globally, the wood stork is considered to be of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>. This is due to its large range. In the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, on the other hand, it is considered to be threatened. Predators of the wood stork include <a href="raccoons">raccoons</a>, which predate chicks, <a href="northern%20crested%20caracara">northern crested caracara</a>s, which prey on eggs, and other birds of prey, which feed on both eggs and chicks. Hunting and egg-collecting by humans has been implicated as a factor in the decline of South American wood storks. Humans also cause nest failures through <a href="ecotourism">ecotourism</a>, although observation through binoculars about away does not have a large effect on nesting success. In both North and South America, habitat alteration has caused the wood stork to decline, with <a href="levee">levee</a> and drainage systems in the Everglades causing a shift in the timing of breeding and thus a decrease in breeding success.

The wood stork was first formally described and given its binomial name "Mycteria americana" by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">1758</a>. Linnaeus based his description on a misplaced account and illustration in "<a href="Historia%20Naturalis%20Brasiliae">Historia Naturalis Brasiliae</a>" (1648) of the jabiru-guacu. Linnaeus also described "Tantalus loculator", which was proven to also apply to the jabiru-guacu, after "M. americana" based on a 1731 illustration of the wood stork by <a href="Mark%20Catesby">Mark Catesby</a> under the name of wood pelican. Since these binomials referred to the same species, "M. americana" and "T. loculator" are <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonymous</a> but "M. americana" takes <a href="Principle%20of%20Priority">priority</a> as it occurs before "T. loculator". The accepted genus name derives from the Greek "mykter", meaning snout, and the species name references the distribution of this stork.

This species seems to have <a href="Evolution">evolved</a> in tropical regions; its North American presence probably postdates the <a href="Last%20glacial%20period">last ice age</a>. A <a href="fossil">fossil</a> fragment from the <a href="Touro%20Passo%20Formation">Touro Passo Formation</a> found at <a href="Arroio%20Touro%20Passo">Arroio Touro Passo</a> (<a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>) might be of the living species; it is at most from the <a href="Late%20Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a> age, a few 10,000s of years ago. North American fossils from that time are of an <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event">extinct</a> larger relative, "M. wetmorei", which would be distinguished from the wood on the basis of size and on the basis of "M. wetmorei"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s less curved mandible. This was probably a <a href="sister%20species">sister species</a>; both occurred <a href="sympatric">sympatric</a>ally on <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> at the end of the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>. Of the extant members of the genus "<a href="Mycteria">Mycteria</a>", this bird is <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> to the clade <a href="yellow-billed%20stork">yellow-billed stork</a>, which is itself basal to the <a href="milky%20stork">milky stork</a> and the <a href="painted%20stork">painted stork</a>. This phylogeny is based on a 1996 study that sequenced the <a href="B%20chromosome">B chromosome</a> and then utilized <a href="DNA%E2%80%93DNA%20hybridization">DNA–DNA hybridization</a> to find the relations between the storks.

Likely because of its decurved bill, the wood stork has formerly been called the "wood ibis", although it is not an ibis. It also has been given the name of the "American wood stork", because it is found in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>. Regional names include "flinthead", "stonehead", "ironhead", "gourdhead", and "preacher".

The adult wood stork is a large bird which stands tall with a wingspan of . The male typically weighs , with a mean weight of ; the female weighs , with a mean weight of . Another estimate puts the mean weight at . The head and neck of the adult are bare, and the scaly skin is a dark grey. The black downward-curved bill is long and very wide at the base. The plumage is mostly white, with the , , and tail being black and having a greenish and purplish iridescence. The legs and feet are dark, and the flesh-coloured toes are pink during the breeding season. The sexes are similar.

Newly hatched chicks have a sparse coat of grey down () that is replaced by a dense, wooly, and white down () in about 10 days. Chicks grow fast, being about half the height of adults in three to four weeks. By the sixth and seventh weeks, the plumage on the head and neck turns smokey grey. When fledged, they resemble the adult, differing only in that they have a feathered head and a yellow bill.

This is a <a href="subtropical">subtropical</a> and <a href="tropical">tropical</a> species which breeds in much of <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a> and the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. The wood stork is the only stork that breeds in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. In the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> there are small breeding populations in <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, and <a href="the%20Carolinas">the Carolinas</a>. In South America, it is found south to northern Argentina. Some populations in North America disperse after breeding, frequently to South America.

This stork is able to adapt to a variety of tropical and subtropical wetland habitats having fluctuating water levels (as that initiates breeding). It nests in trees that are over water or surrounded by water. In freshwater habitats, it primarily nests in forests dominated by trees of the genus "<a href="Taxodium">Taxodium</a>" (in the USA), while in estuaries, it generally nests on trees in the <a href="mangrove%20forest">mangrove forest</a>s. To feed, the wood stork uses freshwater marshes in habitats with an abundance of "Taxodium" trees, while in areas with mangrove forests, it uses brackish water. Areas with more lakes attract feeding on lake, stream, and river edges.

A resident breeder in lowland wetlands with trees, the wood stork builds a large stick nest in a tree. In freshwater habitats, it prefers to nest in trees that are larger in diameter. It nests <a href="Bird%20colony">colonially</a>, with up to 25 nests in one tree. The height of these nests is variable, with some nests located in shorter mangrove trees being at heights of about , compared to a height of about for taller mangrove trees. For "Taxodium" trees, it generally nests near the top branches, frequently between above the ground. On the tree itself, forks of large limbs or places where multiple branches cross are usually chosen.

The nest itself is built by the male from sticks and green twigs collected from the colony and the surrounding area. The greenery usually starts to be added before the eggs are laid but after the main structure of twigs is completed. The frequency at which it is added decreases after the eggs hatch. This greenery functions to help insulate the nest. When complete, the nest is about in diameter, with a central green area having an average diameter of about . The thickness of the edge of the nest usually measures from .

Wood storks without a nest occasionally try to take over others' nests. Such nest take-overs are performed by more than one bird. The young and eggs are thrown out of the nest within about 15 minutes. If only one stork is attending the nest when it is forced out, then it usually waits for its mate to try to take the nest back over.

Breeding is initiated by a drop in the water level combined with an increased density of fish (with the former likely triggering the latter). This is because a decrease in the water level and an increased density of fish allows for an adequate amount of food for the nestlings. This can occur anytime between November and August. After it starts, breeding takes about four months to complete.
This bird lays one <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> of three to five cream coloured eggs that are about in size. These eggs are usually laid one to two days apart and <a href="Egg%20incubation">incubated</a> for 27 to 32 days by both sexes. This incubation period starts when the first egg is laid. During the first week of incubation, the parents do not go far from the colony, with the exception of the short trips to forage, drink, and collect nesting material carried out by the non-incubating bird. After the first week, the non-incubating bird spends less time in the colony, although the eggs are never left unattended. After a few hours of incubation, this bird sometimes takes a break to stretch, preen itself, rearrange nest material, or turn the eggs. The eggs hatch in the order in which they were laid, with an interval of a few days between when each egg hatches.

The chicks hatch <a href="altricial">altricial</a>, unable to move, and weigh an average of . They are brooded for the first week after hatching, and after that when it is raining and at night. The chicks are not left alone until at least three weeks of age, with one parent foraging while the other guards the nest and chicks. When the chicks are at least three weeks old, they are large enough to stay and protect the nest. This coincides with the chicks getting more aggressive when presented with foreign objects or organisms. They fledge 60 to 65 days after hatching, and reach sexual maturity at four years of age, although they usually do not successfully fledge chicks until their fifth year of age.

The hatching success, the percentage of birds that had at least one egg that hatched in a year, of the wood stork is around 62%. This can vary widely, though, with colonies ranging from about 26% to 89% hatching success. The period when chicks are most vulnerable to death is from hatching to when they are two weeks old. Overall, about 31% of nests produce at least one fledged bird. Raccoons and <a href="caracaras">caracaras</a>, especially <a href="northern%20crested%20caracara">northern crested caracara</a>s, are prominent predators of eggs and chicks. Other causes of nesting failure is the falling of nests, thus breaking the eggs inside. This can be caused by many events, the most prominent being poor nest construction and fights between adults.

During the dry season, the wood stork eats mostly fish, supplemented by insects. During the wet season, on the other hand, fish make up about half the diet, crabs make up about 30%, and insects and frogs make up the rest. The wood stork eats larger fish more often than smaller fish, even in some cases where the latter is more abundant. It is estimated that an adult wood stork needs about per day to sustain itself. For a whole family, it is estimated that about are needed per breeding season.

The wood stork usually forages in flocks when not breeding, and alone and in small groups when it is breeding. In the dry season, this bird generally forages by slowly walking forward with its bill submerged in the water while groping for food. During the wet season, this method is used about 40% of the time to catch food. During this period, foot stirring, where the stork walks very slowly with the bill in water while pumping its foot up and down before every step, is used about 35% of the time. Both these hunting methods are non-visual.

Because of its non-visual foraging methods, the wood stork requires shallow water and a high density of fish to forage successfully. The water that it forages in during the dry season averages about in depth, while during the wet season, the water usually is about deep. In the dry season, this stork prefers to forage in waters with no emergent vegetation, whereas in the wet season, it prefers areas with vegetation emerging between above the surface on average. This bird can travel over to reach foraging sites, lending it access to a wide variety of habitats.

Both parents feed the chicks by regurgitating food onto the nest floor. The chicks are mainly fed fish that are between in length, with the length of the fish usually increasing as the chicks get older. The amount of food that the chicks get changes over time, with more being fed daily from hatching to about 22 days, when food intake levels off. This continues until about 45 days, when food consumption starts to decrease. Overall, a chick eats about before it fledges.

When flying, this bird utilizes two different techniques. When it is not sufficiently warm and clear, such as in the late afternoon or on cloudy days, this stork alternates between flapping its wings and gliding for short periods of time. When it is warm and clear, this bird glides after it gains an altitude of at least through continuously flapping its wings. It can then glide for distances ranging from . It does not have to flap its wings during this time because the warm <a href="thermal">thermal</a>s are strong enough to support its weight. Because of the energy that is conserved by soaring, this stork usually uses this method to fly to more distant areas. It flies with its neck outstretched and its legs and feet trailing behind it.

When flying to foraging areas, the wood stork averages a speed of about . In flapping flight it does , and about by gliding.

During the breeding season, the wood stork commonly defecates over the edge of its nest, while the chicks usually defecate inside. The method of defecation of the adult differs based on temperature. Normally, it excretes by leaning forward and slightly raising its tail, with the waste either going straight down or slightly backwards. When it is hot,though, the adult takes a different position, quickly moving its tail downwards and forwards while twisting its body around to aim at a leg that is bent backwards (this is called <a href="urohidrosis">urohidrosis</a>). Which leg is aimed at is alternated. The excrement aimed at the legs is fluid and watery. It generally hits the legs around the middle of the unfeathered tibia, and runs down the leg as it is being directed by the scales. This results in evaporation, making this a method of <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a>. The temperature at which this starts is slightly above the threshold for panting, the latter of which takes place at temperatures of about and above, compared to the normal body temperature of about . In hot weather, breeding adults will also shade their chicks with their wings.

<a href="Raccoon">Raccoon</a>s are predators of wood stork chicks, especially during dry periods where the water beneath nesting trees dries up. Where it occurs, the <a href="crested%20caracara">crested caracara</a> is a significant predator of eggs. Other <a href="caracara">caracara</a>s and <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s and <a href="vulture">vulture</a>s prey on both eggs and chicks.

In the United States, "<a href="Haemoproteus%20crumenium">Haemoproteus crumenium</a>", a blood protozoan, can be found in subadult and adult wood storks. Other species of "<a href="Haemoproteus">Haemoproteus</a>" also infect wood storks in Costa Rica, in addition to "<a href="Syncuaria%20mycteriae">Syncuaria mycteriae</a>", a <a href="nematode">nematode</a> found in the <a href="gizzard">gizzard</a> of the wood stork.

Globally, the wood stork is considered <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> due to its large range. In the United States, this bird is considered to be threatened. This is a recovery from its former status as endangered, which it held from 1984 to 2014 because of a decline in its population caused by habitat loss and drought. Similarly, in the state of <a href="Santa%20Catarina%20%28state%29">Santa Catarina</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, its decline seems to have been reversed: after an absence between the late 1960s and the mid-1990s, the species is now again regularly encountered there, in particular in the <a href="Tubar%C3%A3o%20River">Tubarão River</a> region. It is likely that the <a href="Paran%C3%A1%20River">Paraná River</a> region's wetlands served as a stronghold of the species, from where it is now re-colonizing some of its former haunts.

Disturbance by tourists can have an effect on nesting success, with a study finding that nests that had boats passing by them within about had an average of 0.1 chicks fledging, compared to the normal rate for that area of about 0.9 chicks fledging per nest. Pedestrians watching from a distance of at least did not significantly affect nesting success. In the <a href="Everglades">Everglades</a>, <a href="levee">levee</a> and drainage systems have caused the timing of water fluctuations to change, thus shifting the timing of nesting and consequently a decrease in population. In South America, habitat alteration is the primary threat, in addition to hunting and egg collecting.

Strapping Young Lad

Strapping Young Lad was a Canadian <a href="extreme%20metal">extreme metal</a> band formed by <a href="Devin%20Townsend">Devin Townsend</a> in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> in 1994. The band started as a one-man studio project; Townsend played most of the instruments on the 1995 debut album, "<a href="Heavy%20as%20a%20Really%20Heavy%20Thing">Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing</a>". By 1997, he had recruited permanent members; this line-up, which consisted of Townsend on vocals and <a href="Electric%20guitar">guitar</a>, <a href="Jed%20Simon">Jed Simon</a> on guitar, <a href="Byron%20Stroud">Byron Stroud</a> on <a href="Bass%20guitar">bass</a>, and <a href="Gene%20Hoglan">Gene Hoglan</a> on drums, lasted until the band's dissolution.

Strapping Young Lad's music was characterized by the use of <a href="polyrhythm">polyrhythm</a>ic <a href="riff">guitar riffing</a> and drumming, <a href="blast%20beat">blast beat</a>s and <a href="wall%20of%20sound">wall of sound</a> production. The band's musical direction was mainly determined by Townsend, whose battle with <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar disorder</a> and dark sense of humour were major influences on his songwriting. Townsend was also noted for his eccentric appearance and on-stage behaviour, which greatly contributed to the band's intense live performances.

The band gained critical success and a growing <a href="Underground%20music">underground</a> fan base from their 1997 album "<a href="City%20%28Strapping%20Young%20Lad%20album%29">City</a>". After a hiatus between 1999 and 2002, the band released three more albums, reaching their commercial peak with the 2006 effort, "<a href="The%20New%20Black">The New Black</a>". Townsend disbanded Strapping Young Lad in May 2007, announcing his decision to retreat from public view while continuing to record solo albums.

Strapping Young Lad began in 1994 as a solo project of Canadian musician Devin Townsend. Following his work as vocalist on <a href="Steve%20Vai">Steve Vai</a>'s 1993 album "<a href="Sex%20%26amp%3B%20Religion">Sex & Religion</a>" and its 1994 tour, Townsend believed he had been a "musical whore", spending "the first five years of [his] career working at the behest of other people". During a brief stint as touring guitarist for <a href="The%20Wildhearts">The Wildhearts</a>, Townsend received a phone call from an <a href="A%26amp%3BR">A&R</a> representative for <a href="Roadrunner%20Records">Roadrunner Records</a>, expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. The offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of Roadrunner, who regarded Townsend's recordings as "just noise". He faced further rejection by <a href="Relativity%20Records">Relativity Records</a>, the label behind Vai's "Sex & Religion", who saw no commercial appeal in his music. <a href="Century%20Media%20Records">Century Media Records</a> subsequently contacted the musician, offering him a contract to "make us some extreme albums". Townsend agreed to a five-album deal with the record label.

Following his tour with The Wildhearts, Townsend began recording and producing his debut album, "<a href="Heavy%20as%20a%20Really%20Heavy%20Thing">Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing</a>", under the moniker Strapping Young Lad. According to Townsend, the recording process took "about a week". Embracing The Wildhearts' <a href="Anarchism">anarchist</a> approach, "while focusing on dissonance and just being as over-the-top as [he] could", Townsend sang on the record and performed the majority of its instrumental tracks (with the assistance of a <a href="drum%20machine">drum machine</a>). A few songs, however, featured local <a href="session%20musician">session musician</a>s, including guitarist Jed Simon, Townsend's future bandmate.
Released on April 4, 1995, "Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing" was not widely recognized in the metal community. The album sold 143 copies in its first six months, but received favorable reviews from the heavy metal press. Its unusual musical ideas—a synthesis of <a href="Death%20metal">death</a>, <a href="Thrash%20metal">thrash</a>, and <a href="industrial%20metal">industrial metal</a> influences—prompted Andy Stout from "<a href="Metal%20Hammer">Metal Hammer</a>" to call it "one of the most disturbing albums you'll hear for a very long time". Nevertheless, Townsend has repeatedly expressed his distaste for the recording. He dismissed the album in the liner notes of the record's 2006 reissue, contending it contained only two great songs. He also deemed its production poor in interviews, referring to the album as "basically a collection
of demos that were remixed". When Century Media advertised the reissue of "Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing" as the "rebirth of a genre-defying classic", Townsend called it "record company bullshit".

Townsend recruited a permanent line-up for the second album: Jed Simon on guitar, <a href="Byron%20Stroud">Byron Stroud</a> on bass, and <a href="Gene%20Hoglan">Gene Hoglan</a> on drums. "<a href="City%20%28Strapping%20Young%20Lad%20album%29">City</a>" was released on February 11, 1997, and received highly favorable critical reception. "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>" praised the album for its heaviness, claiming it sounded like "sticking your head into the jet nozzle of a <a href="Stealth%20aircraft">Stealth Bomber</a>", while "Metal Hammer" ranked it No. 13 on its "Top 20 Albums of 1997" list. The album soon gained a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a> and a loyal fan base for the band. "City" is considered to be the band's best effort by a large number of fans and critics alike. In 2002, the album was No. 45 on "<a href="Revolver%20%28magazine%29">Revolver</a>" magazine's "69 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time" list, and also appeared on their "Must Have Metal Albums" list in 2005. It also appeared on the "100 Most Important Albums of the Nineties" list conducted by "<a href="Terrorizer%20%28magazine%29">Terrorizer</a>". Townsend himself stated "City" "is the real Strapping record. That's the ultimate one out of all of them".

The band embarked on a world tour in 1997 to promote the album, which included dates in Europe, the US and Australia. On May 30, 1998, they performed at the <a href="Dynamo%20Open%20Air">Dynamo Open Air</a> festival in <a href="Eindhoven">Eindhoven</a>, <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, then continued touring the next month in Europe. In June 1998, the group released "<a href="No%20Sleep%20%27till%20Bedtime">No Sleep 'till Bedtime</a>", a <a href="live%20album">live album</a> containing songs performed at a 1997 performance at the <a href="HiFi%20Bar%20and%20Ballroom">HiFi Bar and Ballroom</a> in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Australia. Century Media was not initially interested in releasing a live record, but impressed with Townsend's production, the label agreed to release it. The band closed the year playing a few more dates in Japan and Australia.

At the end of 1998, Townsend placed Strapping Young Lad on hiatus to concentrate on his solo career and on his work as a record producer. He had already released two solo albums, "" in 1997 and "<a href="Infinity%20%28Devin%20Townsend%20album%29">Infinity</a>" in 1998 and produced several other artists' albums. Townsend explained numerous conflicts with Century Media, and his struggle with <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar disorder</a> (for which he checked himself into a psychiatric hospital in early 1998), contributed to the curtailment of Strapping Young Lad's activities:
What happened? I signed a shitty deal, but luckily it was non-exclusive. I got tired of doing Strapping so I said, 'I can't do it anymore.' Then I freaked out and went into a hospital. My lawyer said that I was under mental duress when I signed the contract so the contract is void. At that point it was like, 'I just won't do another Strapping record.' Yeah, I went down saying 'CM was the shittiest label ever.' And they went down as saying that I was 'a complete, arrogant psychopath.'

Townsend remained productive between 1999 and 2002, recording two more solo albums, "<a href="Physicist%20%28album%29">Physicist</a>" in 2000 and "<a href="Terria%20%28Devin%20Townsend%20album%29">Terria</a>" in 2001, and producing albums for <a href="Zimmers%20Hole">Zimmers Hole</a>, <a href="Stuck%20Mojo">Stuck Mojo</a> and <a href="Soilwork">Soilwork</a>, among others. Although Strapping Young Lad was officially on hiatus, they gave occasional live performances, including an appearance on the Foot In Mouth Tour in 2001 with <a href="Fear%20Factory">Fear Factory</a>. During this period, Townsend's bandmates were active musically; both Stroud and Hoglan recorded with other bands, and all three were involved in Townsend's solo efforts as studio musicians and as part of his live band as well. Hoglan and Simon also formed a <a href="side%20project">side project</a> called <a href="Tenet%20%28band%29">Tenet</a> with <a href="Grip%20Inc.">Grip Inc.</a> bassist Stuart Carruthers and Interzone frontman Rob Urbinati in early 2002.

In December 2001 Townsend announced, contrary to his earlier public statements, a new Strapping Young Lad album would be released in 2002. He emphasized he was not "forcing" his product upon fans to generate record sales, arguing his band—and its contract with Century—was never a lucrative endeavor. Instead, Townsend's motivation was the "creative anger" sparked by the <a href="September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> and further cultivated during their 2001 tour. For the first time, the album would be a product of collaborative writing; the band wrote "about half" of the material on the 2001 Foot In Mouth Tour, and the rest at home, starting January 2002. After playing a small number of festivals in 2002, Strapping Young Lad entered the studio in September of that year, to record their third album.

The self-titled "<a href="Strapping%20Young%20Lad%20%28album%29">Strapping Young Lad</a>" was released on February 11, 2003, and became the band's first charting album, entering "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>"'s <a href="Top%20Heatseekers">Top Heatseekers</a> at No. 97. The album received moderate critical success, Nate Smith from Rockzone.com called it a "solid addition to the Townsend catalog", but "not an instant classic", Xander Hoose from <a href="Chronicles%20of%20Chaos%20%28webzine%29">Chronicles of Chaos</a> called it "a good album", but also pointed out it is inferior to "City". "Strapping Young Lad" differed from "City" because it was less industrial and more reminiscent of death metal; the humor pervading the previous two albums became more subdued. The song "Devour" would later appear on <a href="Alone%20in%20the%20Dark%20%282005%20film%29%23Soundtrack">the soundtrack for the 2005 film "Alone in the Dark"</a>.

The band toured heavily throughout 2003 and 2004, making stops in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia. Although Townsend stated "Strapping Young Lad" might be the last album, the band re-signed with Century Media Worldwide in March 2004 and announced plans for a new album. On November 2, 2004, Strapping Young Lad released a <a href="DVD">DVD</a> entitled "", which documented the band's January 16, 2004, performance at the <a href="Commodore%20Ballroom">Commodore Ballroom</a> in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>. Bonus features included two <a href="music%20video">music video</a>s, "Relentless" and "Detox", and interviews with band members.

"<a href="Alien%20%28album%29">Alien</a>" was released on March 22, 2005, selling 3,697 copies in its first week. It reached No. 32 on the "Billboard" Top Heatseekers chart, and No. 35 on the <a href="Independent%20Albums">Top Independent Albums</a> chart. Critics praised Townsend's inventiveness and the dynamism of the songs in which "melody and discord meet midway"; Adrien Begrand of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> wrote that "Strapping Young Lad have raised the bar yet again", while <a href="Blabbermouth.net">Blabbermouth.net</a>'s Krista G. called it one of the best albums of the year. Townsend and Hoglan were the primary writers of the album, since Simon and Stroud were busy with other commitments. Townsend explained the experimental noise track "Info Dump" is a reflection on the panicked state of mind that ensued after he stopped taking his medication. The making of "Alien" was documented and made viewable online on Century Media's official site in February 2005. It was also available as a bonus DVD of the limited first edition of the album.
"Love?" was chosen as the sole single from the album. Its accompanying music video, inspired by the cult <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a>, "<a href="The%20Evil%20Dead">The Evil Dead</a>", was directed by Joe Lynch. The video garnered the band wider attention, and helped "Love?" become one of their most recognizable songs. Jed Simon admitted to having produced a video for this particular song because it had "the most commercial potential". "Love?" was originally one of two confirmed songs for an <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a> that was supposed to contain four new songs and four covers. Although planned for release in 2003, the EP was eventually canceled. A music video was also filmed for "Zen"; the video itself would also appear in the 2007 film "<a href="Shoot%20%27Em%20Up%20%28film%29">Shoot 'Em Up</a>".

The band embarked on a headlining tour in the United States in April and May 2005, then went on to tour in Europe. Starting at the end of June, they toured North America as part of the <a href="Sounds%20of%20the%20Underground">Sounds of the Underground</a> tour, then joined Fear Factory on the Transgression Tour in the U.S. Throughout the tour, Fear Factory bassist Stroud performed with both bands at every concert. Strapping Young Lad concluded the year with a tour in the UK. While on tour, the band started writing the next album, then continued the work in January 2006, and finished the album by May. In the same month, Townsend announced his intention to "take a hiatus from making records for a while" after the end of touring due to exhaustion from continuous recording and producing for the past ten years.

"<a href="The%20New%20Black">The New Black</a>", Strapping Young Lad's fifth and final studio album, was released on July 11, 2006. Century Media imposed a strict deadline on the release date of the album; it was to be ready before the 2006 <a href="Ozzfest">Ozzfest</a>. Despite this, Townsend stated the recording was not rushed, and "The New Black" became a critical, as well as a commercial, success. It was more melodic than any of the band's previous albums and brought back the debut album's <a href="tongue-in-cheek">tongue-in-cheek</a> humor. Having sold more than 4,000 copies during its first week, "The New Black" reached No. 200 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart, No. 15 on the Top Independent Albums, and No. 8 on the Top Heatseekers charts. <a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus Magazine</a>'s Cosmo Lee described it as "heavy, catchy, and with no filler", and <a href="About.com">About.com</a>'s Chad Bowar was also positive, stating that "this is a CD that's dense and heavy, but also has some memorable hooks".

A music video was shot in late May to accompany the sole single from the album, "Wrong Side". In June 2006 Strapping Young Lad embarked on a short festival tour of Europe, including performances at the <a href="Rock%20am%20Ring">Rock am Ring</a> and Rock im Park festivals in Germany and the <a href="Download%20Festival">Download Festival</a> in England, which was followed by a second stage appearance at Ozzfest in July and August, where they played to some of their largest audiences in their career.

Townsend recalls that after "Alien", he already knew that he wouldn't want to continue SYL as a project, and that he already wished to abandon SYL after the release of "City" already, considering the project's purpose fulfilled. In an interview conducted by "<a href="Terrorizer%20%28magazine%29">Terrorizer</a>" in August 2006, Townsend explained why he decided to put the band on hold:
At the end of the day, man, I'm just tired, and old, and bald, and fat, and grouchy, and bored. You know? So I was just like, I'm going to make this record, and do this stupid Ozzfest thing, and tell a bunch of stupid jokes in front of a lot of people at Download, then I'm just going to fuck off for a while. The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family. I don't wanna bastardise Strapping and all these other projects by doing it for the money. Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.
Although Hoglan initially denied the definitive break-up of the band, saying they would go on tour in March 2007, he later stated Strapping Young Lad is on "extended hiatus", and might never reunite again. In May 2007, during a press conference held to promote his new solo album, "<a href="Ziltoid%20the%20Omniscient">Ziltoid the Omniscient</a>", Townsend announced his plans to retreat from public view, including giving interviews and touring, to concentrate on his family, and producing solo albums, as well as other people's music. As a result, Strapping Young Lad were effectively disbanded. Townsend discussed his future projects in a May 2007 "Metal Hammer" interview, where he stated "there may be some stuff I do in the future that is as brutal and heavy as Strapping, it's just not going to be Strapping". At the time, Townsend's decision to dissolve the band caused a rift between himself and the remainder of the band, who considered SYL to be at the peak of their popularity and potential at the time; according to Simon, the rest of the band remained estranged from Townsend as a result for a time.

The remastered 10th anniversary edition of "City" was released on June 7, 2007, in similar vein to the 2006 remaster of "Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing", with bonus tracks and extended liner notes by Townsend. A career spanning <a href="Greatest%20hits">best of album</a>, entitled "<a href="1994%E2%80%932006%20Chaos%20Years">1994–2006 Chaos Years</a>", was released on March 31, 2008, with a bonus DVD of live performances and all of the band's music videos.

During his career-retrospective concert "<a href="The%20Retinal%20Circus">The Retinal Circus</a>" in October 2012, Townsend introduced <a href="Jed%20Simon">Jed Simon</a> on stage and performed two SYL songs, "Love?" and "Detox". Townsend has since stated that this was a one off performance and that he is not interested getting SYL back together or playing songs at future shows. He posted to Twitter that he no longer feels the same connection to SYL's music and that this performance was closure for him and Strapping. In an interview on the <a href="Metal%20Hammer">Metal Hammer</a> podcast, Townsend said that while he still connects to the music, SYL required him to go to extremes that took a toll on him. On his own website, he reiterates that SYL was a project that he eventually perceived to be harmful to his mental and physical health. In 2013, he played "Love?" at concerts in Mexico and Chile as a "cover song", but later expressed regretting the decision saying it "confuses people".

Townsend would occasionally perform an acoustic version of "Love?" during his "An Evening with Devin Townsend" shows through the UK in 2015. In 2016, on tour with the Devin Townsend project, he would sometimes play a humorous acoustic version of "Detox".

Strapping Young Lad is known for their <a href="industrial%20metal">industrial</a> <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a> sound while also blending it with elements of <a href="black%20metal">black metal</a>. Many of the band's songs showcased Townsend's versatile vocal style, often changing from <a href="Screaming%20%28music%29">screaming</a>, and <a href="Death%20growl">growling</a> to <a href="clean%20vocals">clean vocals</a>, or even <a href="falsetto">falsetto</a>, within the course of a single song. According to Townsend, the band functioned as his "outlet to freak out", and his two main projects, the more melodic The Devin Townsend Band and the aggressive Strapping Young Lad were "supposed to be the positive and the negative". To achieve a chaotic and cacophonic sound the band utilized complex <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a>s, <a href="polyrhythm">polyrhythm</a>ic composition, <a href="blast%20beat">blast beat</a>s, <a href="Sampling%20%28music%29">sampling</a>, <a href="Electronic%20keyboard">keyboard</a> effects and intricately layered production. Townsend used the newest technology available, such as <a href="Pro%20Tools">Pro Tools</a>, <a href="Steinberg%20Cubase">Steinberg Cubase</a> and <a href="Logic%20Pro">Logic Pro</a>, when recording, mixing and producing the band's songs. As a self-proclaimed "fan of <a href="Multitrack%20recording">multitracking</a>", he created an atmospheric, layered "wall of sound", which became a hallmark of the band's production style (with the exception of their self-titled album which featured no samples, or vocal layering). Townsend's musical ideas and production style have drawn comparisons to <a href="Phil%20Spector">Phil Spector</a> and <a href="Frank%20Zappa">Frank Zappa</a>. Strapping Young Lad mostly eschewed <a href="guitar%20solo">guitar solo</a>s until "The New Black", which featured a more heightened emphasis on melody than their previous albums.

Strapping Young Lad drew influence from a wide range of music genres, most prominently, but not exclusively, <a href="Heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a>. Townsend cited, amongst others, <a href="Judas%20Priest">Judas Priest</a>, <a href="Jane%27s%20Addiction">Jane's Addiction</a>, <a href="Zoviet%20France">Zoviet France</a>, <a href="Grotus">Grotus</a>, and Frank Zappa as his influences, and also expressed his admiration for <a href="Meshuggah">Meshuggah</a> on several occasions, calling them "the best metal band on the planet". Simon and Stroud listed classic <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> bands, like <a href="AC/DC">AC/DC</a>, <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> and <a href="Kiss%20%28band%29">Kiss</a>, and old school thrash and death metal bands, like <a href="Exodus%20%28band%29">Exodus</a>, <a href="Slayer">Slayer</a> and <a href="Morbid%20Angel">Morbid Angel</a> among their influences, while Hoglan's influences range wildly in style from <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a> to <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> drummers like <a href="Neil%20Peart">Neil Peart</a>, <a href="Terry%20Bozzio">Terry Bozzio</a> and <a href="Nick%20Mason">Nick Mason</a>. Townsend stated his main influences for "Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing" were <a href="Napalm%20Death">Napalm Death</a> and <a href="Fear%20Factory">Fear Factory</a>, "City" was influenced by bands such as <a href="Foetus%20%28band%29">Foetus</a> and <a href="White%20Noise%20%28band%29">White Noise</a>, and "The New Black"'s influences were Meshuggah, and "more traditional metal" like <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a>.

Townsend was the band's primary songwriter. While the first two albums were solely his work, subsequent albums featured a minority of "riffs, lyrical ideas, and song titles" by his bandmates.

Despite the brutality of Strapping Young Lad's music, their songs contain hints of <a href="tongue-in-cheek">tongue-in-cheek</a> humor and self-parody. Frequently, Townsend's lyrics approached serious personal or political issues with a morbid sense of humor. He has likened the band's sense of silliness to that of <a href="%26quot%3BWeird%20Al%26quot%3B%20Yankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a>. Townsend's lyrical influences covered a wide range of themes, including <a href="war">war</a>fare, mathematical theorems, and movies. He also used the technique of <a href="cross-referencing">cross-referencing</a>, repeating lines from his own works, such as older Strapping Young Lad, or solo material.

Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the <a href="Eccentricity%20%28behavior%29">eccentric</a> appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> wrote "Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend", and called Strapping Young Lad "one of the best live bands around". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize <a href="circle%20pit">circle pit</a>s, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.

The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled "Far Beyond Metal", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on "No Sleep 'till Bedtime", and on the "For Those Aboot to Rock" DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during "The New Black" sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used "<a href="Blame%20Canada">Blame Canada</a>", a comedic anti-Canada song from "" as <a href="Introduction%20%28music%29">intro music</a> at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.

For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of "Infinity", they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets. It was not until the 2003 release of "<a href="Accelerated%20Evolution">Accelerated Evolution</a>" when Townsend formed a separate band, called <a href="The%20Devin%20Townsend%20Band">The Devin Townsend Band</a>, to act as his full-fledged solo band.




Note: The pre-"City" touring line-up consisted of Townsend, Simon, White, Scribner, Sudar and Meyers.

Wendell Ford

Wendell Hampton Ford (September 8, 1924 – January 22, 2015) was an American politician from the <a href="Commonwealth%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Commonwealth</a> of <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. He served for twenty-four years in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> and was the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Kentucky">53rd</a> <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Governor of Kentucky</a>. He was the first person to be successively elected <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">lieutenant governor</a>, governor and United States senator in Kentucky history. The <a href="Assistant%20party%20leaders%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate">Senate Democratic whip</a> from 1991 to 1999, he was considered the leader of the state's Democratic Party from his election to governor in 1971 until his retirement from the Senate in 1999. At the time of his retirement, he was the longest-serving senator in Kentucky's history, a mark which was then surpassed by <a href="Mitch%20McConnell">Mitch McConnell</a> in 2009. As of 2019, he is the last Democrat to have served as a Senator from the state of Kentucky.

Born in <a href="Daviess%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Daviess County, Kentucky</a>, Ford attended the <a href="University%20of%20Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a>, but his studies were interrupted by his service in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. After the war, he graduated from the Maryland School of Insurance and returned to Kentucky to help his father with the family insurance business. He also continued his military service in the <a href="Kentucky%20Army%20National%20Guard">Kentucky Army National Guard</a>. He worked on the gubernatorial campaign of <a href="Bert%20T.%20Combs">Bert T. Combs</a> in 1959, and became Combs' executive assistant when Combs was elected governor. Encouraged to run for the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">Kentucky Senate</a> by Combs' ally and successor, <a href="Edward%20T.%20Breathitt">Ned Breathitt</a>, Ford won the seat and served one four-year term before running for lieutenant governor in 1967. He was elected on a <a href="split%20ticket">split ticket</a> with <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="Louie%20B.%20Nunn">Louie B. Nunn</a>. Four years later, Ford defeated Combs in an upset in the Democratic <a href="primary%20election">primary</a> en route to the governorship.

As governor, Ford made government more efficient by reorganizing and consolidating some departments in the executive branch. He raised revenue for the state through a <a href="severance%20tax">severance tax</a> on coal and enacted reforms to the educational system. He purged most of the Republicans from statewide office, including helping <a href="Walter%20Huddleston">Walter "Dee" Huddleston</a> win the Senate seat vacated by the retirement of Republican stalwart <a href="John%20Sherman%20Cooper">John Sherman Cooper</a>. In 1974, Ford himself ousted the other incumbent senator, Republican <a href="Marlow%20Cook">Marlow Cook</a>. Following the rapid rise of Ford and many of his political allies, he and his lieutenant governor, <a href="Julian%20Carroll">Julian Carroll</a>, were investigated on charges of <a href="political%20corruption">political corruption</a>, but a <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> refused to indict them. As senator, Ford was a staunch defender of Kentucky's <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a> industry. He also formed the <a href="Caucuses%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Congress%23N">Senate National Guard Caucus</a> with <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> senator <a href="Kit%20Bond">Kit Bond</a>. Chosen as Democratic party whip in 1991, Ford considered running for <a href="Party%20leaders%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate">floor leader</a> in 1994 before throwing his support to <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>'s <a href="Christopher%20Dodd">Christopher Dodd</a>. He retired from the Senate in 1999 and returned to Owensboro, where he taught politics to youth at the Owensboro Museum of Science and History.

Wendell Ford was born near <a href="Owensboro%2C%20Kentucky">Owensboro</a>, in <a href="Daviess%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Daviess County, Kentucky</a>, on September 8, 1924. He was the son of Ernest M. and Irene Woolfork (Schenk) Ford. His father was a <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">state senator</a> and ally of Kentucky Governor <a href="Earle%20C.%20Clements">Earle C. Clements</a>. Ford obtained his early education in the public schools of Daviess County and graduated from <a href="Daviess%20County%20High%20School">Daviess County High School</a>. From 1942 to 1943, he attended the <a href="University%20of%20Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a>.

On September 18, 1943, Ford married Jean Neel of Owensboro at the home of the bride's parents. The couple had two children. Daughter Shirley (Ford) Dexter was born in 1950 and son Steven Ford was born in 1954. The family attended First Baptist Church in Owensboro.

In 1944, Ford left the University of Kentucky to join the <a href="United%20States%20Army">army</a>, enlisting for service in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> on July 22, 1944. He was trained as an administrative <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a> and promoted to the rank of <a href="technical%20sergeant">technical sergeant</a> on November 17, 1945. Over the course of his service, he received the <a href="American%20Campaign%20Medal">American Campaign Medal</a> and the <a href="World%20War%20II%20Victory%20Medal%20%28United%20States%29">World War II Victory Medal</a> and earned the <a href="Expert%20Infantryman%20Badge">Expert Infantryman Badge</a> and <a href="Good%20Conduct%20Medal%20%28United%20States%29">Good Conduct Medal</a>. He was honorably discharged on June 18, 1946.

Following the war, Ford returned home to work with his father in the family insurance business, and graduated from the Maryland School of Insurance in 1947. On June 7, 1949, he enlisted in the <a href="Kentucky%20Army%20National%20Guard">Kentucky Army National Guard</a> and was assigned to Company I of the 149th Infantry Regimental Combat Team in Owensboro. On August 7, 1949, he was promoted to <a href="Second%20Lieutenant">Second Lieutenant</a> of Infantry. In 1949, Ford's <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> was converted from infantry to <a href="tank">tank</a>s, and Ford served as a <a href="Company%20Commander">Company Commander</a> in the 240th Tank Battalion. Promoted to <a href="First%20Lieutenant">First Lieutenant</a> of Armor, he transferred to the inactive Guard in 1956, before being discharged in 1962.

Ford was very active in civic affairs, becoming the first Kentuckian to serve as president of the <a href="Junior%20Chamber%20International">Jaycees</a> in 1954. He was a youth chairman of <a href="Bert%20T.%20Combs">Bert T. Combs</a>' 1959 gubernatorial campaign. After Combs' election, Ford served as Combs' executive assistant from 1959 to 1963. When his mother died in 1963, Ford returned to Owensboro to help his father with the family insurance agency. Although it was speculated he would run for lieutenant governor that year, Ford later insisted he had decided not to re-enter politics until Governor <a href="Edward%20T.%20Breathitt">Ned Breathitt</a> asked him to run against Casper "Cap" Gardner, the state senate's <a href="Floor%20leader">majority leader</a> and a major obstacle to Breathitt's <a href="Progressivism%20in%20the%20United%20States">progressive</a> legislative agenda. Ford won the 1965 election by only 305 votes but quickly became a key player in the state senate. Representing the Eighth District, including Daviess and <a href="Hancock%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Hancock</a> counties, Ford introduced 22 major pieces of legislation that became law during his single term in the senate.

In 1967, Ford ran for <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">lieutenant governor</a>, this time against the wishes of Breathitt and Combs, whose pick was <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Kentucky">state attorney general</a> <a href="Robert%20F.%20Matthews%2C%20Jr.">Robert Matthews</a>. Ford defeated Matthews by 631 votes, 0.2% of the total vote count in the <a href="Primary%20election">primary</a>. He ran an independent campaign and won in the general election even as Combs-Breathitt pick <a href="Henry%20Ward%20%28Kentucky%20politician%29">Henry Ward</a> lost the race for governor to <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="Louie%20B.%20Nunn">Louie B. Nunn</a>. Republicans and Democrats split the state offices, with five going to Republicans and four going to Democrats.

During his time as lieutenant governor, Ford rebuilt the state's Democratic <a href="political%20machine">machine</a>, which would help elect him and others, including Senator <a href="Walter%20Huddleston">Walter Huddleston</a> and Governor <a href="Martha%20Layne%20Collins">Martha Layne Collins</a>. When Governor Nunn asked the legislature to increase the state <a href="sales%20tax">sales tax</a> in 1968 from 3 percent to 5 percent, Ford opposed the measure, saying it should only pass if food and medicine were exempted. Ford lost this battle; the increase passed without exemptions. From 1970 to 1971, Ford was a member of the Executive Committee of the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors.

At the expiration of his term as lieutenant governor, Ford was one of eight candidates to enter the 1971 Democratic gubernatorial primary. The favorite of the field was Ford's mentor, Combs. During the campaign, Ford attacked Combs' age and the sales tax enacted during Combs' administration. He also questioned why Combs would leave his better-paying federal judgeship to run for a second term as governor. Ford garnered more votes than Combs and the other six candidates combined, and attributed his unlikely win over Combs in the primary to superior strategy and Combs' underestimation of his candidacy. Following the election, Combs correctly predicted "This is the end of the road for me politically."
Ford went on to win the governorship in a four-way general election that included another former Democratic governor, <a href="Happy%20Chandler">A. B. "Happy" Chandler</a>, who ran as an <a href="independent%20%28politician%29">independent</a>. Ford finished more than 58,000 votes ahead of his closest rival, Republican <a href="Tom%20Emberton">Tom Emberton</a>. With Combs and Chandler out of politics, factionalism in the Kentucky Democratic Party began to wane.

As governor, Ford raised revenue from a <a href="severance%20tax">severance tax</a> on coal, a two-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, and an increased corporate tax. He balanced these increases by exempting food from the state sales tax. The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects. His victory in the primary had been largely due to <a href="Jefferson%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Jefferson County</a>, and he returned the favor by approving funds to build the <a href="Commonwealth%20Convention%20Center">Commonwealth Convention Center</a> and expand the <a href="Kentucky%20Fair%20and%20Exposition%20Center">Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center</a>. He also shepherded a package of reforms to the state's criminal justice system through the first legislative session of his term.

Ford oversaw the transition of the <a href="University%20of%20Louisville">University of Louisville</a> from municipal to state funding. He pushed for reforms to the state's education system, giving up his own chairmanship of the University of Kentucky board of trustees and extending voting rights to student and faculty members of university boards. These changes generally shifted administration positions in the state's colleges from political rewards to professional appointments. He increased funding to the state's education budget and gave expanded powers to the <a href="Council%20on%20Postsecondary%20Education">Council on Higher Education</a>. He <a href="veto">veto</a>ed a measure that would have allowed <a href="collective%20bargaining">collective bargaining</a> for teachers.

Ford drew praise for his attention to the mundane task of improving the efficiency and organization of executive departments, creating several "super cabinets" under which many departments were consolidated. During the 1972 legislative session, he created the Department of Finance and Administration, combining the functions of the Kentucky Program Development Office and the Department of Finance. Constitutional limits sometimes prevented him from combining like functions, but Ford made the reorganization a top priority and realized some savings to the state.

On March 21, 1972, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> handed down its ruling in the case of "<a href="Dunn%20v.%20Blumstein">Dunn v. Blumstein</a>" that found that a citizen who had lived in a state for 30 days was resident in that state and thus eligible to vote there. Kentucky's Constitution required residency of one year in the state, six months in the county and sixty days in the precinct to establish voting eligibility. This issue had to be resolved before the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201972">1972 presidential election</a> in November, so Ford called a special legislative session to enact the necessary corrections. In addition, Ford added to the General Assembly's agenda the creation of a state environmental protection agency, a <a href="reapportionment">refinement of congressional districts</a> in line with the <a href="1970%20United%20States%20Census">latest census</a> figures and ratification of the recently passed <a href="Equal%20Rights%20Amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</a>. All of these measures passed.

Despite surgery for a brain <a href="aneurysm">aneurysm</a> in June 1972, Ford attended the <a href="1972%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1972 Democratic National Convention</a> in <a href="Miami%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Miami Beach, Florida</a>. He supported <a href="Edmund%20Muskie">Edmund Muskie</a> for president, but later greeted nominee <a href="George%20McGovern">George McGovern</a> when he visited Kentucky. The convention was the beginning of Ford's role in national politics. Offended by the McGovern campaign's treatment of Democratic finance chairman <a href="Robert%20Schwarz%20Strauss">Robert Schwarz Strauss</a>, he helped Strauss get elected chairman of the <a href="Democratic%20National%20Committee">Democratic National Committee</a> following McGovern's defeat. As a result of his involvement in Strauss' election, Ford was elected chair of the <a href="Democratic%20Governors%20Association">Democratic Governors' Conference</a> from 1973 to 1974. He also served as vice-chair of the Conference's Natural Resources and Environmental Management Committee.

During the 1974 legislative session, Ford proposed a six-year study of <a href="coal%20liquefaction">coal liquefaction</a> and <a href="coal%20gasification">gasification</a> in response to the <a href="1973%20oil%20crisis">1973 oil crisis</a>. He also increased funding to human resources and continued his reorganization of the executive branch, creating cabinets for transportation, development, education and the arts, human resources, consumer protection and regulation, safety and justice. He was considered less ruthless than previous governors in firing state officials hired by the previous administration, and expanded the state <a href="merit%20system">merit system</a> to cover some previously exempt state workers. Despite the expansion, he was criticized for the replacements he made, particularly that of the state personnel commissioner appointed during the Nunn administration. Critics also cited the fact that employees found qualified by the merit examination were still required to obtain political clearance before they were hired.
Ford united the state's Democratic Party, allowing them to capture a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1972 for the first time since 1956. The seat was vacated by the retirement of Republican <a href="John%20Sherman%20Cooper">John Sherman Cooper</a> and won by Ford's campaign manager, <a href="Walter%20Huddleston">Walter "Dee" Huddleston</a>. Ford's friends then began lobbying him to try and unseat Kentucky's other Republican senator, one-term legislator <a href="Marlow%20Cook">Marlow Cook</a>. Ford wanted lieutenant governor <a href="Julian%20Carroll">Julian Carroll</a>, who had run on an informal slate with Combs in the 1971 primary, to run for Cook's seat, but Carroll already had his eye on the governor's chair. Ford's allies did not have a gubernatorial candidate stronger than Carroll, and when a poll showed that Ford was the only Democrat who could defeat Cook, he agreed to run, announcing his candidacy immediately following the 1974 legislative session.

A primary issue during the election was the construction of a dam on the <a href="Red%20River%20%28Kentucky%29">Red River</a>. Cook opposed the dam, but Ford supported it and allocated some of the state's budget surplus to its construction. In the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20elections%2C%201974">election</a>, Ford defeated Cook by a vote of 399,406 to 328,982, completing his revitalization of the state's Democratic party by personally ousting the last Republican from major office. Cook resigned his seat in December so that Ford would have a higher standing in seniority in the Senate. Ford resigned as governor to accept the seat, leaving the governorship to Carroll, who dropped state support for the project, killing it.

In the wake of the rapid ascent of Ford and members of his faction to the state's major political offices, he and Carroll were investigated in a corruption probe. The four-year investigation began in 1977 and focused on a state insurance <a href="Kickback%20%28bribery%29">kickback</a> scheme alleged to have operated during Ford's tenure. In June 1972, Ford had purchased insurance policies for state workers from some of his political backers without <a href="competitive%20bidding">competitive bidding</a>. State law did not require competitive bidding, and earlier governors had engaged in similar practices. Investigators believed there was an arrangement in which insurance companies getting government contracts split commissions with party officials, although Ford was suspected of allowing the practice for political benefit rather than personal financial gain. In 1981, prosecutors asked for indictments against Ford and Carroll on <a href="racketeering">racketeering</a> charges but a <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> refused. Because grand jury proceedings are secret, what exactly occurred has never been publicly revealed. However, state Republicans maintained that Ford took the <a href="Fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifth Amendment</a> while on the stand, invoking his right against self-incrimination. Ford refused to confirm or deny this report. A federal grand jury recommended that Ford be indicted in connection with the insurance scheme, but the U.S. Department of Justice did not act on this recommendation.

Ford entered the Senate in 1974 and was reelected in 1980, 1986 and 1992. In the 1980 primary, Ford received only token opposition from attorney Flora Stuart. He was unopposed in the 1986 and 1992 Democratic primaries. Republicans failed to put forward a viable challenger during any of Ford's re-election bids. In 1980, he defeated septuagenarian former state auditor Mary Louise Foust by 334,862 votes. Ford's 720,891 votes represented 65 percent of the total votes cast in the election, a record for a statewide race in Kentucky. Against Republican Jackson Andrews IV in 1986, Ford shattered that record, securing 74 percent of the votes cast and carrying all <a href="List%20of%20counties%20in%20Kentucky">120 Kentucky counties</a>. State senator <a href="David%20L.%20Williams%20%28politician%29">David L. Williams</a> fared little better in <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Kentucky%2C%201992">1992</a>, surrendering 477,002 votes to Ford (63 percent).

Ford seriously considered leaving the Senate and running for governor again in 1983 and 1991, but decided against it both times. In the 1983 contest, he would have faced sitting lieutenant governor <a href="Martha%20Layne%20Collins">Martha Layne Collins</a> in the primary. Collins was a factional ally of Ford's, which influenced his decision. In 1991, Ford cited his seniority in the Senate and desire to become <a href="Assistant%20party%20leaders%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate">Democratic Senate whip</a> as factors in his decision not to run for governor.

Early in his career, Ford supported a <a href="constitutional%20amendment">constitutional amendment</a> against <a href="Desegregation%20busing%20in%20the%20United%20States">desegregation busing</a>. He also floated a proposal to put the federal budget on a two-year cycle, believing too much time was spent annually on budget wrangling. This idea, based on the model used in the Kentucky state budget, was never implemented. During the <a href="95th%20United%20States%20Congress">Ninety-fifth Congress</a> (1977–1979), he was chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Aeronautical%20and%20Space%20Sciences">Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences</a>.

From 1977 to 1983, Ford was a member of the <a href="Democratic%20Senatorial%20Campaign%20Committee">Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee</a>. He first sought the post of Democratic whip in 1988, but lost to <a href="California">California</a>'s <a href="Alan%20Cranston">Alan Cranston</a>, who had held the post since 1977. Ford got a late start in the race, and a "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" writer opined that he overestimated his chances of unseating Cranston. Immediately after conceding his loss, he announced he would be a candidate for the position in the next election in 1990. He again faced Cranston in the election, but Cranston withdrew from the race due to a battle with <a href="prostate%20cancer">prostate cancer</a>. Ford maintained that he had enough commitments of support in the Democratic caucus to have won without Cranston's withdrawal. When majority leader <a href="George%20J.%20Mitchell">George J. Mitchell</a> retired from the Senate in 1994, Ford showed some interest in the Democratic floor leader post. Ultimately, he decided against it, choosing to focus instead on Kentucky issues. He supported <a href="Christopher%20Dodd">Christopher Dodd</a> for majority leader.
During the <a href="98th%20United%20States%20Congress">Ninety-eighth Congress</a> (1983–1985), Ford served on the Select Committee to Study the Committee System, and he was a member of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Rules%20and%20Administration">Committee on Rules and Administration</a> in the <a href="100th%20United%20States%20Congress">One Hundredth</a> through <a href="103rd%20United%20States%20Congress">One Hundred Third</a> Congresses (1987–1995). In 1989, he joined with Missouri senator <a href="Kit%20Bond">Kit Bond</a> to form the Senate National Guard Caucus, a coalition of senators committed to advancing National Guard capabilities and readiness. Ford said he was motivated to form the caucus after seeing the work done by <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Representative</a> <a href="Gillespie%20V.%20Montgomery">Sonny Montgomery</a> with the <a href="National%20Guard%20Association%20of%20the%20United%20States">National Guard Association</a> and the <a href="National%20Guard%20Bureau">National Guard Bureau</a>. Ford co-chaired the caucus with Bond until Ford's retirement from the Senate in 1999. The Kentucky Army Guard dedicated the Wendell H. Ford Training Center in <a href="Muhlenberg%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Muhlenberg County, Kentucky</a> in 1998. In 1999, the National Guard Bureau presented Ford with the Sonny Montgomery Award, its highest honor.

Missouri senator <a href="Thomas%20Eagleton">Thomas Eagleton</a> opined that Ford and Dee Huddleston made "probably the best one-two combination for any state in the Senate." Both were defenders of <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a>, Kentucky's primary <a href="cash%20crop">cash crop</a>. Ford sat on the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Commerce%2C%20Science%20and%20Transportation">Commerce Committee</a>, influencing legislation affecting the manufacturing end of the tobacco industry, while Huddleston sat on the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Agriculture%2C%20Nutrition%20and%20Forestry">Agriculture Committee</a> and protected programs that benefited tobacco farmers. Both were instrumental in salvaging the <a href="Tobacco%20Price%20Support%20Program">Tobacco Price Support Program</a>. Ford got tobacco exempted from the <a href="Consumer%20Product%20Safety%20Act">Consumer Product Safety Act</a> and was a consistent opponent of <a href="Cigarette%20taxes%20in%20the%20United%20States">cigarette tax</a> increases. He sponsored an amendment to the <a href="General%20Agreement%20on%20Tariffs%20and%20Trade">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</a> that limited the amount of foreign tobacco that could be imported by the United States.

Later in his career, Ford split with Huddleston's successor, <a href="Mitch%20McConnell">Mitch McConnell</a>, over a proposed <a href="Tobacco%20Master%20Settlement%20Agreement%23Proposed%20%26quot%3BGlobal%20Settlement%20Agreement%26quot%3B">settlement of lawsuits against tobacco companies</a>. Ford favored the package as presented to Congress, which would have protected the price support program, while McConnell favored a smaller aid package to tobacco farmers and an end to the price support program. Both proposals were ultimately defeated, and the rift between Ford and McConnell never healed.

As chairman of the Commerce Committee's aviation subcommittee, Ford secured funds to improve the airports in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a>, <a href="northern%20Kentucky">northern Kentucky</a>, and <a href="Glasgow%2C%20Kentucky">Glasgow</a>. The <a href="Wendell%20H.%20Ford%20Airport">Wendell H. Ford Airport</a> in <a href="Hazard%2C%20Kentucky">Hazard, Kentucky</a> is named for him. A 1990 bill aimed at reducing <a href="aircraft%20noise">aircraft noise</a>, improving airline safety measures, and requiring airlines to better inform consumers about their performance was dubbed the <a href="Wendell%20H.%20Ford%20Aviation%20Investment%20and%20Reform%20Act%20for%20the%2021st%20Century">Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century</a>.

Of his career in the Senate, Ford said "I wasn't interested in national issues. I was interested in Kentucky issues." Nevertheless, he influenced several important pieces of federal legislation. He sponsored an amendment to the <a href="Family%20Medical%20Leave%20Act">Family Medical Leave Act</a> exempting businesses with fewer than fifty employees. He was a key player in securing passage of the <a href="National%20Voter%20Registration%20Act%20of%201993">motor voter law</a> in 1993. He supported increases to the <a href="Minimum%20wage%20in%20the%20United%20States">federal minimum wage</a> and a <a href="Personal%20Responsibility%20and%20Work%20Opportunity%20Act">1996 welfare reform bill</a>. A supporter of research into <a href="clean%20coal%20technology">clean coal technology</a>, he also worked with <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a> senator <a href="Jay%20Rockefeller">Jay Rockefeller</a> to secure better retirement benefits for coal miners. Never known as a major player on international issues, Ford favored continued <a href="economic%20sanctions">economic sanctions</a> against <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> as an alternative to the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>. He voted against the <a href="Torrijos%E2%80%93Carter%20Treaties">Panama Canal Treaty</a>, which he perceived to be unpopular with Kentucky voters. Despite having chaired <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>'s <a href="United%20States%20Congress%20Joint%20Committee%20on%20Inaugural%20Ceremonies">inaugural committee</a> in 1993, Ford broke with the administration by voting against the <a href="North%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> .

As he had as governor of Kentucky, Ford gave attention to improving the efficiency of government. While serving on the <a href="United%20States%20Congress%20Joint%20Committee%20on%20Printing">Joint Committee on Printing</a> during the <a href="101st%20United%20States%20Congress">One Hundred First</a> and One Hundred Third Congresses, he saved the government millions of dollars in printing costs by printing in volume and using <a href="Paper%20recycling">recycled paper</a>. In 1998, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> senator <a href="John%20Warner">John Warner</a> sponsored the Wendell H. Ford Government Publications Reform Act of 1998; Ford signed on as a co-sponsor. The bill would have eliminated the <a href="Joint%20Committee%20on%20Printing">Joint Committee on Printing</a>, distributing its authority and functions among the Senate Rules Committee, the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Oversight%20and%20Government%20Reform">House Oversight Committee</a>, and the administrator of the <a href="United%20States%20Government%20Printing%20Office">Government Printing Office</a>. It would also have centralized government printing services and penalized government agencies who did not make their documents available to the printing office to be printed. Opponents of the bill cited the broad powers granted to the printing office and concerns about the erosion of <a href="copyright">copyright</a> protection. The bill was reported favorably out of committee, but was squeezed from the legislative calendar by issues related to the impending <a href="impeachment%20of%20Bill%20Clinton">impeachment of Bill Clinton</a>. Warner did not return to his chairmanship of the Joint Committee on Printing in the next congress, Ford retired from the Senate, and the bill was not re-introduced.

Ford chose not to seek a fifth term in 1998, and retired to Owensboro. He worked for a time as a consultant to Washington lobbying and law firm <a href="Dickstein%20Shapiro%20Morin%20%26amp%3B%20Oshinsky">Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky</a>. At the time of his retirement, Ford was the longest-serving senator in Kentucky history. In January 2009, <a href="Mitch%20McConnell">Mitch McConnell</a> surpassed Ford's mark of 24 years in the Senate.

In August 1978, the <a href="U.S.%20Route%2060%20in%20Kentucky">US 60</a> bypass around Owensboro was renamed the Wendell H. Ford Expressway. The Western Kentucky Parkway was also renamed the <a href="Wendell%20H.%20Ford%20Western%20Kentucky%20Parkway">Wendell H. Ford Western Kentucky Parkway</a> during the administration of Governor <a href="Paul%20E.%20Patton">Paul E. Patton</a>. In 2009, Ford was inducted into the Kentucky Transportation Hall of Fame.

Later in life, Ford taught politics to the youth of Owensboro from the Owensboro Museum of Science and History, which houses a replica of his Senate office. On July 19, 2014, the "<a href="Messenger-Inquirer">Messenger-Inquirer</a>" reported that Ford had been diagnosed with <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a>.

Ford died on January 22, 2015, at the age of 90 from lung cancer, and was buried at <a href="Rosehill%20Elmwood%20Cemetery">Rosehill Elmwood Cemetery</a>.

Lake Burley Griffin

Lake Burley Griffin is an <a href="Reservoir%20%28water%29">artificial lake</a> in the centre of <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>, the capital of <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. It was completed in 1963 after the <a href="Molonglo%20River">Molonglo River</a>—which ran between the city centre and <a href="Parliamentary%20Triangle">Parliamentary Triangle</a>—was dammed. It is named after <a href="Walter%20Burley%20Griffin">Walter Burley Griffin</a>, the American architect who won the competition to design the city of Canberra.

Griffin designed the lake with many geometric motifs, so that the axes of his design lined up with natural geographical landmarks in the area. However, government authorities changed his original plans and no substantial work was completed before he left Australia in 1920. Griffin's proposal was further delayed by the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> and <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and it was not until the 1950s that planning resumed. After political disputes and consideration of other proposed variations, excavation work began in 1960 with the energetic backing of <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a>. After the completion of the bridges and dams, the dams were locked in September 1963. However, because of a drought, the lake's target water level was not reached until April 1964. The lake was formally inaugurated on 17 October 1964.

The lake is located in the approximate geographic centre of the city, and is the centrepiece of the capital in accordance with Griffin's original designs. Numerous important institutions, such as the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery</a>, <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Australia">National Museum</a>, <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Australia">National Library</a>, <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a> and the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court</a> were built on its shores, and <a href="Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra">Parliament House</a> is a short distance away. Its surrounds, consisting mainly of parklands, are popular with recreational users, particularly in the warmer months. Though swimming in the lake is uncommon, it is used for a wide variety of other activities, such as rowing, fishing, and sailing.

The lake is an ornamental body with a length of and a width, at its widest, of . It has an average depth of and a maximum depth of about near the <a href="Scrivener%20Dam">Scrivener Dam</a>. Its flow is regulated by the Scrivener Dam, designed to handle floods that occur once in 5,000 years. In times of drought, water levels can be maintained through the release of water from <a href="Googong%20Dam">Googong Dam</a>, located on an upstream tributary of the Molonglo River.

<a href="Charles%20Scrivener">Charles Robert Scrivener</a> (1855–1923) recommended the site for Canberra in 1909, which was to be a planned capital city for the country. One of the reasons for the location's selection was its ability to store water "for ornamental purposes at reasonable cost"; Scrivener's work had demonstrated that the topography could be used to create a lake through flooding.

In 1911, a competition for the design of Canberra was launched, and Scrivener's detailed survey of the area was supplied to the competing architects. The <a href="Molonglo%20River">Molonglo River</a> flowed through the site, which was a flood plain and Scrivener's survey showed in grey an area clearly representing an artificial lake—similar to the lake later created—and four possible locations for a dam to create it. Most of the proposals took the hint and included artificial bodies of water.

The American architect <a href="Walter%20Burley%20Griffin">Walter Burley Griffin</a> won the contest and was invited to Australia to oversee the construction of the nation's new capital after the judges' decision was ratified by <a href="King%20O%27Malley">King O'Malley</a>, the Minister for Home Affairs. Griffin's proposal, which had an abundance of geometric patterns, incorporated concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several radii.

His lake design was at the heart of the city and consisted of a Central Basin in the shape of circular segment, a West and East Basin, which were both approximately circular, and a West and East Lake, which were much larger and irregularly shaped, at either side of the system. The East Lake was supposed to be higher than the remaining components. Griffin's proposal was "the grandest scheme submitted, yet it had an appealing simplicity and clarity.

The lakes were deliberately designed so that their orientation was related to various topographical landmarks in Canberra. The lakes stretched from east to west and divided the city in two; a land axis perpendicular to the central basin stretched from <a href="Capital%20Hill%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Capital Hill</a>—the future location of the new <a href="Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra">Parliament House</a> on a mound on the southern side—north northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along <a href="Anzac%20Parade%2C%20Canberra">Anzac Parade</a> to the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> (although a casino was originally planned in its place). This was designed so that looking from Capital Hill, the War Memorial stood directly at the foot of <a href="Mount%20Ainslie">Mount Ainslie</a>. At the southwestern end of the land axis was <a href="Bimberi%20Peak">Bimberi Peak</a>.

The straight edge of the circular segment that formed the central basin was designated the water axis, and it extended northwest towards <a href="Black%20Mountain%20%28Australian%20Capital%20Territory%29">Black Mountain</a>, the highest point in Canberra. A line parallel to the water axis, on the northern side of the city, was designated the municipal axis. The municipal axis became the location of <a href="Constitution%20Avenue%2C%20Canberra">Constitution Avenue</a>, which linked <a href="City%20Hill%2C%20Canberra">City Hill</a> in <a href="City%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Civic Centre</a> and Market Centre. <a href="Commonwealth%20Avenue%2C%20Canberra">Commonwealth Avenue</a> and <a href="Kings%20Avenue%2C%20Canberra">Kings Avenue</a> were to run from the southern side from Capital Hill to City Hill and Market Centre on the north respectively, and they formed the western and eastern edges of the central basin. The area enclosed by the three avenues was known as the <a href="Parliamentary%20Triangle">Parliamentary Triangle</a>, and was to form the centrepiece of Griffin's work.

Later, Scrivener, as part of a government design committee, was responsible for modifying Griffin's winning design. He recommended changing the shape of the lake from Griffin's very geometric shapes to a much more organic one using a single dam, unlike Griffin's series of <a href="weir">weir</a>s. Griffin lobbied for the retention of the pure geometry, saying that they were "one of the reasons d'etre of the ornamental waters", but he was overruled. The new design included elements from several of the best design submissions and was widely criticised as being ugly. The new plan for the lake retained Griffin's three formal basins: east, central, and west, though in a more relaxed form.

Griffin entered into correspondence with the government over the plan and its alternatives, and he was invited to Canberra to discuss the matter. Griffin arrived in August 1913 and was appointed Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction for three years.

The plans were varied again in the following years, but the design of Lake Burley Griffin remained based largely on the original committee's plan. It was later gazetted and legally protected by the federal parliament in 1926, based on a 1918 plan. However, Griffin had a strained working relationship with the Australian authorities and a lack of federal government funding meant that by the time he left in 1920, little significant work had been done on the city. A 1920s proposal to reduce West Lake into a ribbon of water was made on the basis of flood safety. However, the Owen and Peake report of 1929 ruled that the original design was hydrologically sound.

With the onset of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, followed by <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, development of the new capital was slow, and in the decade after the end of the war, Canberra was criticised for resembling a village, and its disorganised collection of buildings was deemed ugly. Canberra was often derisively described as "several suburbs in search of a city".

During this time, the Molonglo River flowed through the flood basin, with only a small fraction of the water envisaged in Griffin's plan. The centre of his capital city consisted of mostly farmland, with small settlements—mostly wooden, temporary and ad hoc—on either side. There was little evidence that Canberra was planned, and the lake and Parliamentary Triangle at the heart of Griffin's plan was but a paddock. Royal Canberra Golf Course, and Acton Racecourse and a sports ground were located on the pastoral land that was to become the West Lake, and people had to disperse the livestock before playing sport. A rubbish dump stood on the northern banks of the location of central basin, and no earth had been moved since Griffin's departure three decades earlier.

In 1950, the East Lake—the largest component—was eliminated upon the advice of the National Capital Planning and Development Committee (NCPDC). Today, what would have been the East Lake corresponds to the suburb of <a href="Fyshwick">Fyshwick</a>. The rationale given was that around of farmland would be submerged and that the Molonglo would have insufficient water to keep the lake filled.

In 1953, the NCPDC excised the West Lake from its plans and replaced it with a winding stream, which was wide and covered around a fifth of the original area. As the NCPDC had only advisory powers, this change was attributed to the influence of senior officials in the Department of the Interior who felt that Griffin's plan was too grandiose. Advocates of watered-down scheme thought it was more economical and saved of land for development. However, according to engineering reports that were ignored, the smaller plan would actually cost more money and require a more complicated structure of dams that would in any case be less able to prevent flooding.

Initially, there was little opposition during the consultation period before the alterations were made. However, opposition to the reduction of the water area grew. The process that resulted in the alteration was criticised for being non-transparent and sneaky. Some organisations complained that they were not given an opportunity to express their opinion before the change was gazetted, and many politicians and the chief town planner were not informed. Critics bitterly insinuated that politically influential members of the <a href="Royal%20Canberra%20Golf%20Club">Royal Canberra Golf Club</a>, whose course was situated on the location of the proposed West Lake, were responsible for the change in policy.

The Parliamentary Public Works Committee advised the Parliament to restore the West Lake. After an inquiry in late 1954, it concluded that:

The <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a>, regarded the state of the national capital as an embarrassment. Over time his attitude changed from one of contempt to that of championing its development. He fired two ministers charged with the development of the city, feeling that their performance lacked intensity.

In 1958, the newly created <a href="National%20Capital%20Development%20Commission">National Capital Development Commission</a> (NCDC), which had been created and given more power by Menzies following a 1955 Senate inquiry, restored the West Lake to its plans, and it was formally gazetted in October 1959. The NCDC also blocked a plan by the Department of Works to build a bridge across the lake along the land axis between Parliament House and the War Memorial contrary to Griffin's plans.

A powerful Senate Select Committee oversaw the NCDC and renowned British architect Sir <a href="William%20Holford">William Holford</a> was brought in to fine-tune Griffin's original plans. He changed the central basin's geometry so that it was no longer a segment of circle; he converted the southern straight edge into a polygonal shape with three edges and inserted a gulf on the northern shore. The result was closer to Scrivener's modified design some decades earlier.

The lake contains of water with a surface area of . It is long, wide at its widest point, has a shoreline of and a water level of above sea level.

The lake is relatively shallow; the maximum depth is near the Scrivener Dam, and the average depth is . The shallowest part of the complex in the East Basin, which has an average depth of . The minimum depth of the water at the walls is around and rock is placed at the toe of the wall to inhibit aquatic plant growth.

Lake Burley Griffin contains six islands, three unnamed small islands and three larger named islands. Of the larger islands, <a href="Aspen%20Island">Aspen Island</a> is located in Central Basin while <a href="Springbank%20Island">Springbank</a> and <a href="Spinnaker%20Island%20%28Lake%20Burley%20Griffin%29">Spinnaker</a> Island are located in the West Lake. Aspen Island is connected to dry land by a footbridge, and is the site of the <a href="Australian%20National%20Carillon">Australian National Carillon</a>.

In 1958, engineers conducted studies into the hydrology and structural requirements needed for the building of the dam. Further studies were done to model water quality, siltation, climate effects and change in land quality. Modelling based on the data collection suggested that the water level could be kept within a metre of the intended level of above sea level in the case of a flood.

In February 1959, formal authority for beginning construction was granted. However, while Menzies was on holiday, some officials from the Department of Treasury convinced ministers to withhold money needed for the lake, so the start of the construction was delayed. Once it started, progress was fast. At its peak, the number of people physically working on the construction in the lakes was between 400 and 500. <a href="John%20Overall%20%28architect%29">John Overall</a>, the Commissioner of the NCDC, promised Menzies that the work would be finished within four years, and he succeeded, despite the Prime Minister's scepticism. Equipment was quickly requisitioned.

After the lengthy political wrangling over the design had passed, the criticism of the scheme died down. Menzies strongly denounced the "moaning" by opponents of the lake. Most critics decried the project as a waste of money that should have been spent on essential services across Australia. Less strident concerns centred on the potentially negative effects of the lake, such as mosquitoes, ecological degeneration, siltation and the possibility that the lake would create fog. The latter of these concerns has proven to be unfounded.

The excavation of Lake Burley Griffin began in 1960 with the clearing of vegetation from the floodplain of the Molonglo River. The trees on the golf course and along the river were pulled up, along with the various sports grounds and houses.

During major earthworks, at least of topsoil was excavated. It was collected for use at several public parks and gardens, including the future Commonwealth Park on the northern shore. It was also used to create the six artificial islands including Springbank Island. The island was named after the former Springbank Farm that was situated there. Land excavated to create a sailing course at <a href="Yarralumla%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Yarralumla</a> was used for the thematically named Spinnaker Island to its north, while excavated stone was moved beside the Kings Avenue Bridge at the eastern edge of the central basin from Aspen Island.

Care was taken to excavate the entire lake floor to a depth of at least to provide sufficient clearance for boat keels. Another reason given for this was that mosquitoes would not breed nor would weeds grow at such a depth. A soil conservation program was launched in the catchment and bed load traps were installed to minimise loss of earth. The traps have been used as a source of sand and gravel for building sites. Drainage blankets were used to prevent the loss of <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a> beneath the lake.

During the following phase of work, four types of lake margin were constructed. On the southern side of the Central Basin, low reinforced concrete retaining walls were used, while on the eastern side, grouted rock wall can be seen near Commonwealth Park, as well as much of the East Basin. Sand and gravel beaches were built to cater for lakeside recreational pursuits. These are mostly prevalent on the western half of the lake complex. Rocky outcrops, steeply sloping stable shores with water vegetation such as bullrushes were also used. This treatment is evident in the West Lake in Yarralumla. William Holford and Partners were responsible for the foreshore landscaping, and over 55,000 trees were planted in accordance with a detailed scheme. <a href="Eucalypt">Eucalypt</a>s were preferred so as to maintain the natural colour of the city landscape.

Lake Burley Griffin is crossed by <a href="Commonwealth%20Avenue%2C%20Canberra">Commonwealth Avenue</a> Bridge (), <a href="Kings%20Avenue%2C%20Canberra">Kings Avenue</a> Bridge () and a roadway over <a href="Scrivener%20Dam">Scrivener Dam</a>. The two bridges were constructed before the lake was filled, and replaced wooden structures. 

Site testing for both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960. The construction of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after. Fortunately for the builders, Canberra was in a drought and the ground remained dry during construction. Both bridges use <a href="Prestressed%20concrete%23Post-tensioned%20concrete">post-tensioned concrete</a>, reinforced with rustproof steel cables.

Both bridges are made of concrete and steel and are dual-carriageway; Commonwealth Avenue has three lanes in each direction while Kings Avenue has two. Instead of traditional lamp post lighting, Kings Avenue Bridge was illuminated by a series of fluorescent tubes on the handrails, a concept known as "integral lighting". The design was deemed a success, so it was introduced to the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge also. Both structures won awards from the Illumination Engineering Society.

Kings Avenue Bridge opened on 10 March 1962. Prime Minister Menzies unlocked a ceremonial chain before the motorcade and pageant crossed the lake in front of a large crowd. Commonwealth Avenue Bridge opened in 1963 without an official ceremony. Menzies called it "the finest building in the national capital".

The dam that holds back the waters of Lake Burley Griffin was named <a href="Scrivener%20Dam">Scrivener Dam</a> after <a href="Charles%20Scrivener">Charles Robert Scrivener</a>. The dam was designed and built by Rheinstahl Union Bruckenbau in <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>, and utilised state-of-the-art post-tensioning techniques to cope with any problems or movements in the riverbed. This was required because of the quartz porphyry and geological faulting upon which the dam sits. About of concrete was used in its construction. The dam is high and long with a maximum wall thickness of . The dam is designed to handle a once in 5,000 year flood event. Construction began in September 1960 and the dam was locked in September 1963.

The dam has five bay <a href="spillway">spillway</a> controlled by wide, <a href="Hydraulic%20machinery">hydraulically</a> operated <a href="floodgates">fish-belly flap gates</a>. The fish-belly gates allow for a precise control of water level, reducing the dead area on the banks between high and low water levels. The five gates have only been opened simultaneously once in the dam's history, during heavy flooding in 1976. The gates hold two thirds of the lake's volume. They were designed to allow easy flow of debris out of the lake.

The dam has the capacity to allow a flow of but can withstand up to before "catastrophic damage" results; A flow of can be dealt with without any substantial change in the water level. The highest recorded flow in the Molonglo was during an earlier flood.

Lady Denman Drive, a roadway atop the dam wall, provides a third road crossing for the lake. It consists of a roadway and a bicycle path, and allows residents in western Canberra to cross the lake. This was possible because the dam gates are closed by pushing up from below, unlike most previous designs that wherein the gates were lifted from above.

A prolonged drought coincided with and eased work on the lake's construction. The valves on the Scrivener Dam were closed on 20 September 1963 by Minister for the Interior, <a href="Gordon%20Freeth">Gordon Freeth</a>; Menzies was absent due to ill health. Several months on, with no rain in sight, mosquito-infested pools of water were the only visible sign of the lake filling. With the eventual breaking of the drought, the lake reached the planned level on 29 April 1964. On 17 October 1964, Menzies (by now Sir Robert) commemorated the filling of the lake and the completion of stage one with an opening ceremony amid the backdrop of sailing craft. The ceremony was accompanied by fireworks display, and Griffin's lake had finally come to fruition after five decades, at the cost of AUD5,039,050. Freeth suggested that Menzies had "been in a material sense the father of the lake" and that the lake should be named after him. Menzies insisted that the lake should be named after Griffin.

In times of severe drought, Lake Burley Griffin's water level can fall unacceptably low. When this happens, a release of water from Googong Dam located upstream can be scheduled to top up and restore the lake water level. The Googong Dam is located on the <a href="Queanbeyan%20River">Queanbeyan River</a> which is a tributary of the Molonglo River. The dam whose construction was finished in 1979 is one of three dams—the Cotter and Corin Dams are the others—that meet the water supply needs of the Canberra and <a href="Queanbeyan%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Queanbeyan</a> region. The Googong Dam's water carrying capacity is .

Griffin's design made the lake a focal point of the city. In the four decades since the initial construction of the lake, various buildings of national importance were added. According to the policy plan of the government, "The lake is not only one of the centrepieces of Canberra's plan in its own right, but forms the immediate foreground of the National Parliamentary Area."

The creation of the lake also gave a water frontage to many prominent institutions that were previously landlocked. The <a href="Canberra%20Hospital">Royal Canberra Hospital</a> was located on the <a href="Acton%20Peninsula">Acton Peninsula</a> between the West Lake and the West Basin on the north shore until its demolition. <a href="Government%20House%2C%20Canberra">Government House</a>, the historic <a href="Blundell%27s%20Cottage">Blundell's Cottage</a>—which was built over 50 years before construction of Canberra began—and the newly built <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a>, on the southern and northern shores of the West Lake, both gained a waterfront.

In 1970, two tourist attractions were added to the middle of Central Basin. The <a href="Captain%20James%20Cook%20Memorial">Captain James Cook Memorial</a> was built by the government to commemorate the Bicentenary of (then Lieutenant) <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>'s first sighting of the east coast of Australia. It includes a water jet fountain located in the central basin (based on the <a href="Jet%20d%27eau">Jet d'eau</a> in Geneva) and a skeleton globe sculpture at Regatta Point showing the paths of Cook's expeditions. On 25 April 1970, <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> officially inaugurated the memorial. As part of the same ceremony, Queen Elizabeth also opened the <a href="Australian%20National%20Carillon">National Carillon</a> on Aspen Island, a set of 53 bronze bells donated by the British Government to commemorate the city's 50th anniversary.
The completion of the central basin placed a waterway between Parliament House and the War Memorial and a landscaped boulevard was built along the land axis. Later, various buildings of national importance were built along the land axis in the late-1960s through to the early 1980s. The <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Australia">National Library</a> was opened on the western side of the axis in April 1968. Building of the <a href="high%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court</a> and <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery</a> occurred in the late-1970s and the buildings were opened in May 1980 and October 1982 respectively. The latter two buildings lie on the eastern side of the axis and are connected by an aerial bridge. In 1988, the new Parliament House was built on Capital Hill, thereby completing the most important structure in the Parliamentary Triangle.

The current home of the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Australia">National Museum</a> was built on the former site of the Royal Canberra Hospital in 2001. This occurred after the public were encouraged to watch the <a href="Royal%20Canberra%20Hospital%20implosion">controlled demolition of the hospital</a> in 1997, but a girl was killed by flying debris, leading to criticism of the ACT Government.

At the start of the 21st century, the layout of the lake was significantly altered for the first time since its construction, through the Kingston Foreshores Redevelopment on southern shore of the East Basin, which was planned in 1997. A bidding process was enacted, multimillion-dollar luxury apartment complexes were built in the suburb of <a href="Kingston%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Kingston</a>, driving property values to record-breaking levels. After a dispute over the environmental impact of the development, building works commenced on the previously industrial lakeside area of the suburb. In 2007, work started to reclaim land from the lakebed to form a harbour.

The <a href="Kingston%20Powerhouse">Kingston Powerhouse</a>, which used to provide the city's power supply, was converted into the <a href="Canberra%20Glassworks">Canberra Glassworks</a> in 2007, 50 years after the electricity generators stopped. A tower of glass and light named "Touching Lightly" was unveiled on 21 May 2010 by Chief Minister and Minister for the Arts and Heritage Jon Stanhope. It was built by Australian artist Warren Langley.

In 2007, the government unveiled a proposal to redevelop the area surrounding the historic <a href="Albert%20Hall%2C%20Canberra">Albert Hall</a> into a tourist and dining precinct. This included the building of an eight-storey building and the rezoning of some waterfront land currently designated as cultural to commercial. It was met with widespread hostility from heritage activists and the general community, which submitted more than 3,300 signatories in a petition against the scheme. One of the criticisms was that the project was tilted too heavily towards business, and neglected the arts and community events. The proposal was scrapped in 2009.

It has been proposed that a footbridge, to be named <a href="Immigration%20Bridge">Immigration Bridge</a>, be built between the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Australia">National Museum of Australia</a> and Lennox Gardens on the south shore, in recognition of the contributions that immigrants have made to Australia. The proposal has mostly received negative feedback. An inquiry recommended that the bridge be redesigned or moved to accommodate the needs of other lake users.

The surrounds of Lake Burley Griffin are very popular recreational areas, and is known locally as LBG. Public parks exist along most of the shore line, with free electric barbecue facilities, fenced-in swimming areas, picnic tables and toilets. These parklands form a large part of the area around the lake, and occupy in total. Some of the parks reserved for public recreation include <a href="Commonwealth%20Park%2C%20Canberra">Commonwealth</a>, <a href="Weston%20Park%2C%20Canberra">Weston</a>, <a href="Kings%20Park%2C%20Canberra">Kings</a> and Grevillea Parks, <a href="Lennox%20Gardens%2C%20Canberra">Lennox Gardens</a> and Commonwealth Place. Commonwealth and Kings Park on the northern shore of the Central Basin are among the two most popular. The former is an urban horticultural park and is the location of the Canberra Festival. 

Commonwealth Park is the location of <a href="Floriade%20%28Canberra%29">Floriade</a>, an annual flower festival that is held for around a month in spring and attracts upwards of 300,000 visitors, a number comparable to the city population. The largest flower festival in Australia, the event is a major tourist attraction for the city, and legal action was threatened after another festival in Australia wanted to use the same name. An expansion is being planned to coincide with the centenary of the national capital. The Weston Park to the west is known for its woodland and conifers, while Black Mountain Peninsula is known as a picnicking site with eucalypts. Grevillea and Bowen Parks on the East Basin tend to be little used.

Owing to the proliferation of beaches, boat ramps and jetties, the West Lake is the area most used by swimmers and vessels. A bike path also surrounds the lake, and riding, walking or jogging around the lake are a popular activity on the weekends. Fireworks are often held over the lake on <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve">New Year's Eve</a>, and a large show called <a href="Skyfire%20%28Canberra%29">Skyfire</a> has been held at the lake since 1989.

Lake Burley Griffin, apart from being ornamental, is used for many recreational activities. <a href="Canoeing">Canoeing</a>, <a href="sailing">sailing</a>, paddleboating, <a href="windsurfing">windsurfing</a> and <a href="dragon%20boating">dragon boating</a> are popular. A rowing course is set up at the western end of the lake. The National Championships were held in the lake in 1964, but high winds have deterred organisers. On one occasion, winds swept a boat into a bridge pylon. While not particularly popular, opportunities for swimming have been limited recently because of increasingly frequent lake closures due to concerns about water quality; another deterrent against swimming is the generally cold water temperature. During summer, the lake is used for the swim leg of numerous triathlon and aquathlon events including the Sri Chinmoy Triathlon Festival.

Generally, powerboat use on the lake is not permitted. Permits are available for the use of powered boats on the lake for use in rescue, training, commercial purposes or special interest (such as historic steam powered boats). Molonglo Reach, an area of the Molonglo River just before it enters the east basin is set aside for water skiing. Ten powerboats may be used in this limited area.

The lake is patrolled by the <a href="Australian%20Federal%20Police">Australian Federal Police</a> <a href="water%20police">water police</a>. The water police give assistance to lake users, helping to right boats and towing crippled craft to shore.

At most swimming locations around Lake Burley Griffin there are fenced-in swimming areas for safety. In the more popular areas, there are also safety lockers with life belts and emergency phones for requesting help. Between 1962 and 1991, seven people died from drowning.

For safety and water quality reasons, the lake has different zones for different activities. The eastern extremity is zoned for primary contact water activities such as swimming and water skiing. The East and Central Basins, closer to populated areas, are zoned for secondary contact water sports such as sailing or rowing. West Lake and Tarcoola Reach, which covers the area between Commonwealth Avenue and Kurrajong Point, is the primary recreational area of the lake, and both primary and secondary contact water sports are permitted. Yarramundi Reach near Scrivener Dam has a marked rowing course, and is zoned as secondary, although primary contact activities are also allowed.

<a href="Toxic">Toxic</a> <a href="Cyanobacteria">blue-green algae</a> blooms are a reasonably common occurrence in the lake. Warnings about coming into contact with the water are released when an <a href="algal%20bloom">algal bloom</a> is detected. Attempts are being made to limit the amount of <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a>s entering the lake in the hope of improving its water quality. Blue-green algae (more correctly cyanobacteria) produce <a href="toxin">toxin</a>s, which can be harmful for humans and any other animals that come in contact with the contaminated water. There have been several cases of dogs being affected after playing in and drinking the lake water.

The water also appears murky due to a high level of <a href="turbidity">turbidity</a>; however, this is not usually a health risk. However, the turbidity, which is caused by wind, prevents photosynthetic stabilisation. Siltation is not considered a major problem and is only a factor in the East Basin, but dredging is not required. The problem has eased with the construction of the Googong Dam, and the spectre of heavy metal pollution has receded, partly due to the closure of some lead mines upstream. However, leaching and groundwater leakage still causes some pollution. Rubbish, oil and sediment traps have been set up at the incoming openings to the lake to minimise pollution.

Fishing is quite popular in the lake. The most common species caught is the illegally introduced <a href="Common%20carp">carp</a>. Annual monitoring is carried out to determine fish populations. Almost equally as common are the introduced redfin <a href="European%20perch">European perch</a>, with these being a regular by catch when fishing for golden perch. However, a number of less common species also inhabit the lake, including native <a href="Murray%20cod">Murray cod</a>, <a href="western%20carp%20gudgeon">western carp gudgeon</a> and <a href="golden%20perch">golden perch</a>, as well as introduced <a href="goldfish">goldfish</a>, "<a href="Gambusia">Gambusia</a>", <a href="rainbow%20trout">rainbow trout</a> and <a href="brown%20trout">brown trout</a>.

The lake has been stocked annually with a variety of introduced and native species and over half a million fish have been released since 1981. There have been many changes to the fish populations in the lake as well as stocking practices since it was first filled.

Regular stocking since the start of the 1980s have re-established reasonable populations of golden perch and Murray cod; native fish that were indigenous to the Molonglo River before the lake was built, but had been lost to mining pollution of the Molonglo River in the first half of the 20th century. The main reason for stocking is to boost fish stocks along the Molonglo, which have been depleted by overfishing, introduced species and habitat destruction. One of the motives for raising the level of Murray cod and golden perch is to balance the ecosystem by having them act as native predators of other fish.

Native Silver perch and introduced brown trout were released in 1981–83 and 1987–89 respectively, but have not been stocked since. Silver perch stockings resulted in almost no captures. Introduced rainbow trout have been released sporadically, approximately once a decade, but have not been released since 2002–04, due to unacceptably low survival rates. According to a government report, the reason for the low survival rate is unknown, but the dominance of carp in the competition for food is one suggested theory. However, the eutrophic nature and high water temperatures of the lake in summer are more probable reasons. Golden perch and Murray cod have accounted for around four fifths of the released fish in the last three decades and have been the only fish stocked in the last five years. The government plans to stock only these two species for the five years leading up to 2014.

The Getaway (1972 film)

The Getaway is a 1972 American <a href="neo-noir">neo-noir</a> <a href="crime%20film">crime film</a> directed by <a href="Sam%20Peckinpah">Sam Peckinpah</a> and written by <a href="Walter%20Hill">Walter Hill</a>, based on <a href="Jim%20Thompson%20%28writer%29">Jim Thompson</a>'s <a href="The%20Getaway%20%28novel%29">1958 novel</a>. It stars <a href="Steve%20McQueen">Steve McQueen</a>, <a href="Ali%20MacGraw">Ali MacGraw</a>, <a href="Ben%20Johnson%20%28actor%29">Ben Johnson</a>, <a href="Al%20Lettieri">Al Lettieri</a>, and <a href="Sally%20Struthers">Sally Struthers</a>. The plot follows imprisoned mastermind robber Carter "Doc" McCoy (McQueen), whose wife Carol (MacGraw) conspires for his release on the condition they rob a bank in <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. A double-cross follows the crime and the McCoys are forced to flee for <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> with the police and criminals in hot pursuit.

<a href="Peter%20Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a>, whose "<a href="The%20Last%20Picture%20Show">The Last Picture Show</a>" impressed McQueen and producer David Foster, was originally hired as the director of "The Getaway". Thompson came on board to write the screenplay, but creative differences ensued between him and McQueen and he was subsequently fired along with Bogdanovich. Writing and directing duties eventually went to Hill and Peckinpah, respectively. <a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> commenced on February 7, 1972, on location in Texas. The film reunited McQueen and Peckinpah, both of whom had previously worked together on the relatively unprofitable "<a href="Junior%20Bonner">Junior Bonner</a>" which was released the same year.

"The Getaway" opened on December 13, 1972 to generally negative reviews. Even so, numerous retrospective critics gave the film good reviews. A box office hit earning over $36 million, it was the second highest-grossing film of the year, and was one of the most financially successful productions of Peckinpah's and McQueen's careers. In 1994, a <a href="The%20Getaway%20%281994%20film%29">remake</a> was released to generally negative reviews, directed by <a href="Roger%20Donaldson">Roger Donaldson</a> and starring <a href="Alec%20Baldwin">Alec Baldwin</a> and <a href="Kim%20Basinger">Kim Basinger</a>.

Serving four years of his ten-year sentence for armed robbery, Carter "Doc" McCoy is denied parole from a Texas prison. When his wife Carol visits him, he tells her to do whatever is necessary to make a deal with Jack Beynon, a corrupt businessman in <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a>, to free him. Beynon uses his influence and obtains Doc's parole on the condition that he take part in a bank robbery with two of his henchmen, Rudy and Frank. Frank kills a guard, then Rudy attempts a double-cross, killing Frank and drawing on Doc, who quickly reacts and shoots Rudy several times. Doc takes the $500,000 ($ million today) and leaves. Rudy, having secretly worn a <a href="bulletproof%20vest">bulletproof vest</a>, is only wounded.

Doc meets with Beynon, who attempts a double-cross before Carol shoots and kills him. Doc realizes that Carol had sex with Beynon to secure his parole. Doc angrily gathers up the money and, after a bitter quarrel, the couple flees for the border at <a href="El%20Paso">El Paso</a>.

A bloodied Rudy forces rural veterinarian Harold and his wife Fran to treat his injuries, then kidnaps them to pursue Doc and Carol. Beynon's brother Cully and his thugs also pursue the McCoys. At a train station, a <a href="confidence%20trick">con man</a> swaps locker keys with Carol and steals their bag of money. Doc follows him onto a train and forcefully takes it back. The injured con man and a train passenger – a boy whom Doc had rebuked for squirting him with a <a href="water%20gun">water gun</a> – are taken to the police station, where they identify Doc's mug shot.

Carol buys a car, and the McCoys drive to an electronics store. As Doc buys a portable radio, he switches off the television set near the proprietor's desk broadcasting the news of the earlier incidents they were involved in. Suddenly, all the television sets in the store show Doc's picture, prompting him to leave immediately. The proprietor gets a glimpse of the picture, and calls the police. Doc steals a shotgun from a neighboring store, followed by several shoot-outs and police chases. The couple escape by hiding in a large trash bin, only to end up in the back of a garbage truck that dumps its load at the local landfill. Filthy and frustrated, they argue about whether to stay together or split up. They decide to see things through.

Rudy's attraction to the veterinarian's wife leads to them having consensual sex in front of her husband. Humiliated, the vet hangs himself in the motel bathroom. Rudy and Fran move on, barely acknowledging the suicide. They check into an El Paso hotel used by criminals as a <a href="safe%20house">safe house</a> because Rudy knows that the McCoys will be heading to the same place. When Doc and Carol check in at the hotel, they ask for food to be delivered, but the manager, Laughlin, says he is working alone and cannot leave the desk. Doc soon realizes that Laughlin sent his family away because something is about to happen. He urges Carol to dress quickly so they can escape. An armed Rudy comes to their door while Fran poses as a delivery girl who needs to be paid for the food. Peering from an adjacent doorway, Doc is surprised to see Rudy alive. He sneaks up behind Rudy, knocks him out, and does the same to Fran.

Cully and his thugs arrive as the McCoys try to leave. A violent gunfight ensues in the halls, stairwell, and elevator; all Cully's men are killed but one, who Doc allows to run away. Cully himself dies when Doc shoots the cables of the elevator he is in and it crashes to the bottom of the shaft. Rudy comes to his senses, follows Doc and Carol outside onto a fire escape, and shoots at them. Doc returns fire and kills him. With the police on the way, the couple hijack a pickup truck and force the driver, a cooperative old cowboy, to take them to Mexico. After crossing the border, Doc and Carol pay the cowboy $30,000 ($ million today) for his beatup, old truck. Overjoyed, the cowboy heads back to El Paso on foot, while the couple continue into Mexico.
Steve McQueen had been encouraging his publicist David Foster to enter the film industry for years, as a <a href="film%20producer">producer</a>. His first attempt was "<a href="Butch%20Cassidy%20and%20the%20Sundance%20Kid">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a>" (1969), with McQueen starring alongside <a href="Paul%20Newman">Paul Newman</a>, but <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a>, particularly its president, <a href="Richard%20D.%20Zanuck">Richard D. Zanuck</a>, did not want Foster in the deal. Rather, Zanuck hired producer <a href="Paul%20Monash">Paul Monash</a> since he was the studio's profit maker, resulting in McQueen's departure from the project, which then fell apart. While McQueen was making "<a href="Le%20Mans%20%28film%29">Le Mans</a>" (1971) Foster acquired the rights to <a href="Jim%20Thompson%20%28writer%29">Jim Thompson</a>'s crime novel "<a href="The%20Getaway%20%28novel%29">The Getaway</a>". Foster sent McQueen a copy of the book urging him to do it. The actor was looking for a "good/bad guy" role and saw these qualities in the novel's protagonist, Doc McCoy.

Foster looked for a director and <a href="Peter%20Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a> came to his attention. Bogdanovich's agent, Jeff Berg, set up a special screening of his client's soon-to-be released "<a href="The%20Last%20Picture%20Show">The Last Picture Show</a>" (1971) for Foster with McQueen in attendance. They loved it and met with the director and a deal was made. However, <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> approached Bogdanovich with an offer to direct "<a href="What%27s%20Up%2C%20Doc%3F%20%281972%20film%29">What's Up, Doc?</a>" (1972), starring <a href="Barbra%20Streisand">Barbra Streisand</a>, with the stipulation that he had to start right away. The director wanted to do both, and the studio refused. When McQueen found out, he became upset and told Bogdanovich that he was going to get someone else to direct "The Getaway".

McQueen had recently worked with director Sam Peckinpah on "<a href="Junior%20Bonner">Junior Bonner</a>" (1972), and enjoyed the experience, but the film proved to be unsuccessful. He said: "Out of all my movies, "Junior Bonner" did not make one cent. In fact, it lost money." McQueen recommended that Foster approach Peckinpah. Like McQueen, Peckinpah was in need of a box office hit and accepted immediately. The filmmaker had read the novel when it was originally published, and had talked to Thompson about making a film adaptation when he was starting out as a director.

At the time, Peckinpah wanted to make "<a href="Emperor%20of%20the%20North%20Pole">Emperor of the North Pole</a>" (1973), a story set during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> about a <a href="brakeman">brakeman</a> obsessed with keeping homeless people off his train. The film's producer made a deal with <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>' production chief <a href="Robert%20Evans%20%28film%20producer%29">Robert Evans</a>, allowing Peckinpah to do his personal project if he first directed "The Getaway". The director was soon dismissed from "Emperor" and told that Paramount was not making "The Getaway".

A conflict arose with Paramount over the film's budget. Foster had thirty days to set up a new deal with another studio, or Paramount would own the exclusive rights. He was inundated with offers and accepted one from First Artists Group, because McQueen would receive no upfront salary, just 10% of the gross receipts from the first dollar taken in on the film. This would become very profitable if the film was a box office hit.

Jim Thompson was hired by Foster and McQueen to adapt his novel. He worked on the <a href="screenplay">screenplay</a> for four months, changing some of the scenes and episodes in his novel. Thompson's script included the borderline surrealistic ending from his novel featuring El Rey, an imaginary Mexican town filled with criminals. McQueen objected to the depressing ending and Thompson was replaced by screenwriter <a href="Walter%20Hill">Walter Hill</a>. Hill had been recommended by <a href="Polly%20Platt">Polly Platt</a>, Bogdanovich's wife, who was then still attached to direct; Platt had been impressed by Hill's work on "<a href="Hickey%20%26amp%3B%20Boggs">Hickey & Boggs</a>" (1972). Hill said Bogdanovich wanted to turn the material into a more <a href="Hitchcock">Hitchcock</a>-type thriller, but he had only gotten twenty-five pages in when McQueen fired the director. Hill finished the script in six weeks, then Peckinpah came on board.

Peckinpah read Hill's draft and the screenwriter remembered that he made few changes: "We made it non-period and added a little more action." On Thompson's novel, Hill said:

When Bogdanovich was to direct, he intended to cast <a href="Cybill%20Shepherd">Cybill Shepherd</a>, his then girlfriend, in the role of Carol. As soon as Peckinpah came on to direct, he wanted to cast <a href="Stella%20Stevens">Stella Stevens</a> with whom he had worked on "<a href="The%20Ballad%20of%20Cable%20Hogue">The Ballad of Cable Hogue</a>" (1970), with <a href="Angie%20Dickinson">Angie Dickinson</a> and <a href="Dyan%20Cannon">Dyan Cannon</a> as possible alternatives. Foster suggested <a href="Ali%20MacGraw">Ali MacGraw</a>, a much in-demand actress after the commercial success of "<a href="Love%20Story%20%281970%20film%29">Love Story</a>" (1970). She was married to Robert Evans, who wanted her to avoid being <a href="Typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a> in <a href="preppy">preppy</a> roles, and set up a meeting for her with Foster, McQueen, and Peckinpah about the film. According to Foster, she was scared of McQueen and Peckinpah because they had reputations as "wild, two-fisted, beer guzzlers". McQueen and MacGraw experienced a strong instant attraction. "He was recently separated and free" she said, "and I was scared of my overwhelming attraction to him."

Peckinpah originally wanted actor <a href="Jack%20Palance">Jack Palance</a> to play the role of Rudy Butler but could not afford his salary. Impressed by his performance in "<a href="The%20Panic%20in%20Needle%20Park">The Panic in Needle Park</a>" (1971), Hill recommended <a href="Richard%20Bright%20%28actor%29">Richard Bright</a>. Bright had worked with McQueen fourteen years before, but he did not have the threatening physique that McQueen pictured for Butler because the two men were the same height. Due to his friendship with Bright, Peckinpah cast him as the con man. <a href="Al%20Lettieri">Al Lettieri</a> was brought to Peckinpah's attention for the role of Butler by producer <a href="Albert%20S.%20Ruddy">Albert S. Ruddy</a>, who was working with the actor on "<a href="The%20Godfather">The Godfather</a>" (1972). Like Peckinpah, Lettieri was a heavy drinker, which caused problems while filming due to his unpredictable behavior.

<a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> on "The Getaway" began in <a href="Huntsville%2C%20Texas">Huntsville, Texas</a> on February 7, 1972. Peckinpah shot the opening prison scenes at the <a href="Huntsville%20Penitentiary">Huntsville Penitentiary</a>, with McQueen surrounded by actual convicts. Other shooting locations included multiple Texas towns such as <a href="San%20Marcos%2C%20Texas">San Marcos</a>, <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a>, and <a href="El%20Paso">El Paso</a>.

McQueen and MacGraw began an affair during production. She would eventually leave her husband Evans and become McQueen's second wife. Foster was worried that their relationship could have a potentially negative impact on the film by causing a scandal. MacGraw got her start as a model, and her inexperience as an actress was evident on the set as she struggled with the role. According to Foster, the actress and Peckinpah got along well, but she was not happy with her performance: "After we had completed "The Getaway" and I looked at what I had done in it, I hated my own performance. I liked the picture, but I despised my own work."

Peckinpah's intake of alcohol increased dramatically while making "The Getaway", and he was fond of saying, "I can't direct when I'm sober." He and McQueen got into occasional heated arguments during filming. The director recalled one such incident on the first day of rehearsal in San Marcos: "Steve and I had been discussing some point on which we disagreed, so he picked up this bottle of champagne and threw it at me. I saw it coming and ducked. And Steve just laughed." McQueen had a knack with props, especially the weapons he used in the film. Hill remembered, "You can see Steve's military training in his films. He was so brisk and confident in the way he handled the guns." It was McQueen's idea to have his character shoot and blow up a squad car in the scene where Doc holds two police officers at gunpoint.

Under his contract with First Artists McQueen had final cut privileges on "The Getaway", and when Peckinpah found out he was upset. Richard Bright said that McQueen chose takes that "made him look good" and Peckinpah felt that the actor played it safe: "He chose all these "<a href="Playboy%20%28magazine%29">Playboy</a>" shots of himself. He's playing it safe with these pretty-boy shots."

Peckinpah's longtime composer and collaborator <a href="Jerry%20Fielding">Jerry Fielding</a> was commissioned to <a href="film%20score">score</a> "The Getaway". He had worked previously with the director on "Noon Wine" (1966), "<a href="The%20Wild%20Bunch">The Wild Bunch</a>" (1969), "<a href="Straw%20Dogs%20%281971%20film%29">Straw Dogs</a>" (1970), and "Junior Bonner". After the film's second preview screening, McQueen was unhappy with the music and used his clout to hire <a href="Quincy%20Jones">Quincy Jones</a> to rescore the film. Jones's music had a jazzier edge and featured <a href="harmonica">harmonica</a> solos by <a href="Toots%20Thielemans">Toots Thielemans</a> and vocals by <a href="Don%20Elliott">Don Elliott</a>, both of whom had been his associates. Peckinpah was unhappy with this action and took out a full-page ad in "<a href="Daily%20Variety">Daily Variety</a>" on November 17, 1972, including a letter he had written to Fielding thanking him for his work. Fielding would work with Peckinpah on two more films, "<a href="Bring%20Me%20the%20Head%20of%20Alfredo%20Garcia">Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia</a>" (1974) and "<a href="The%20Killer%20Elite">The Killer Elite</a>" (1975). Jones was nominated for a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Score">Golden Globe award</a> for his original score.

There were two preview screenings for "The Getaway": a lackluster one in San Francisco, and an enthusiastic one held in San Jose, California. In the second week of January 1973, the film grossed an estimated amount of $874,000 in thirty-nine locations in the United States, during which time it also peaked "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>"s box office chart. The film grossed $18,943,592 by the end of 1973, and went on to become the second highest-grossing film of the year. Its North American rentals for that year were $17,500,000. On a production budget of $3,352,254, the film grossed $36,734,619 in the US alone.

Walter Hill later recalled:
<a href="Warner%20Home%20Video">Warner Home Video</a> released a two-disc <a href="DVD">DVD</a> version of "The Getaway" on November 19, 1997, presented in <a href="widescreen">widescreen</a> and <a href="pan%20and%20scan">pan and scan</a>. They also released the film again on DVD as part of "The Essential Steve McQueen Collection" seven-disc <a href="box%20set">box set</a> on May 31, 2005, followed by a <a href="HD%20DVD">HD DVD</a> and <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> version on February 27, 2007. Special features include <a href="audio%20commentary">audio commentary</a> by Peckinpah's biographers and documentarians Nick Redman, Garner Simmons, <a href="David%20Weddle">David Weddle</a>, and Paul Seydor; a 12-minute "virtual" commentary by Peckinpah, McQueen and MacGraw; a <a href="featurette">featurette</a> entitled "Main Title 1M1 Jerry Fielding, Sam Peckinpah & The Getaway" which includes interviews by composer Jerry Fielding's wife and two daughters, and Peckinpah's assistant; the bank robbery sequence with Fielding's film score; Fielding's audio-only alternate score; the film's three-minute trailer and trailers for other films of Peckinpah.

Matthew Hinkley of <a href="DVD%20Talk">DVD Talk</a> gave the Blu-ray version an overall rating of four stars out of five, commending the video transfer and special features, but criticizing the audio transfer. Peter Bracke of "High Def Digest" felt similarly in regard to the transfers and special features, though he gave an overall rating of three-and-a-half stars out of five.

Initial reaction to "The Getaway" was negative. <a href="Vincent%20Canby">Vincent Canby</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described the film as "aimless". <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" complained that the story was contrived, calling it "a big, glossy, impersonal mechanical toy". Ebert rated it two stars out of four. <a href="Pauline%20Kael">Pauline Kael</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" found the on-screen relationship between McQueen and MacGraw wanting. She referred to MacGraw, in hindsight, as a much worse actress than <a href="Candice%20Bergen">Candice Bergen</a>. <a href="Jay%20Cocks">Jay Cocks</a> of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine felt that Peckinpah "was pushing his privileges too far", but ultimately described the film as "a work of a competent craftsman". Kathleen Carroll of the "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>" denounced the film for being "too violent and vulgar". <a href="Gene%20Siskel">Gene Siskel</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" was an early supporter, giving it three-and-a-half stars out of four and writing that it "plays like a 1970s '<a href="Bonnie%20and%20Clyde%20%28film%29">Bonnie and Clyde</a>.'"

Modern criticism has been more appreciative. <a href="Dennis%20Schwartz">Dennis Schwartz</a> of "Ozus World Movie Reviews" gave it a B grade rating, praising most of the film's action sequence and, as a whole, called it "a gripping thriller (...) filmed in Peckinpah's excessive action-packed violent and amoral style". Newell Todd of <a href="CHUD.com">CHUD.com</a> scored it seven out of ten, and considered it "an entertaining film that is only made better with some McQueen action". Casey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com described it as "an effective thriller that plays with and against some of [Peckinpah]'s well-noted stylistic trademarks", (...) a well-constructed, lovers on the run-style heist flick". Writing for "Cinema Crazed", Felix Vasquez also lauded most action scenes and remarked: ""The Getaway" is a top notch crime thriller with a fantastic turn by McQueen and it's still the best action movie I've ever seen."

Contemporary review aggregation website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> gives the film a score of 85% based on 20 reviews—an <a href="average%20rating">average rating</a> of 7 out of 10, which provides the consensus, ""The Getaway" sees Sam Peckinpah and Steve McQueen, the kings of violence and cool, working at full throttle." They also ranked "The Getaway" at 46 on their 75 Best Heist Movies of All Time. In 2010, the film was among the 25 <a href="heist%20films">heist films</a> considered an all-time favorite by "The Playlist", who described it as "a solid, straight-ahead action flick that's always fun to wander into the middle of on late night TV".

A <a href="remake">remake</a> of the film was released on February 11, 1994, directed by <a href="Roger%20Donaldson">Roger Donaldson</a>, and co-produced and co-written by the original's David Foster and Walter Hill.

Naruto Uzumaki

When creating Naruto for the <a href="List%20of%20Naruto%20chapters%20%28Part%20I%29">initial part</a> of the series, Kishimoto kept the character "simple and stupid," while giving him many attributes of an ideal hero. Kishimoto gave Naruto a dark side by adding tragedy to the character's past. He has revised Naruto's image many times, providing the character with different clothes intended to appeal to Western audiences and to make him easier to illustrate. Kishimoto changed his design for <a href="List%20of%20Naruto%20chapters%20%28Part%20II%29">Part II</a> of the storyline, which starts two-and-a-half years after Part I. Naruto is voiced by <a href="Junko%20Takeuchi">Junko Takeuchi</a> in the original animated series and <a href="Maile%20Flanagan">Maile Flanagan</a> in the English adaptations.

Merchandise based on Naruto includes <a href="Action%20figure">figurines</a> and <a href="keychain">keychain</a>s. Naruto's character development has been praised by anime and manga publications and has drawn scholarly attention. Although some initially saw him as a typical manga and anime protagonist comparable to those in other "shōnen" manga, others have praised his personality and character development as he avoids stereotypes.

During the 1990s, new manga author <a href="Masashi%20Kishimoto">Masashi Kishimoto</a> sought to write a one-shot chapter that would feature Naruto as a chef, but this version never made it to print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of "Naruto" for the summer 1997 issue of "<a href="Akamaru%20Jump">Akamaru Jump</a>" magazine based on the idea. For the serialized version, Kishimoto incorporated traits he felt made an ideal hero in the creation of Naruto: a straightforward way of thinking, a mischievous side, and attributes possessed by <a href="Goku">Goku</a> from the "<a href="Dragon%20Ball">Dragon Ball</a>" franchise. Aiming to keep Naruto "simple and stupid," Kishimoto avoided modeling him after anyone in particular, instead conceiving of him as naïve with a dark side resulting from his harsh past. Despite this, he is always optimistic, a trait Kishimoto said makes this character unique. By and large, Naruto's personality is childish; the creator tried to convey this trait in his illustrations. Kishimoto notes as an example of this the cover of volume 10, where Kishimoto depicts Naruto mimicking a turtle as a child might do. "Naruto" was Kishimoto's first published manga, and he focused on making Naruto's facial expressions consistent in difficult situations. He commented: "It's rather awkward to talk about what makes Naruto appealing to audiences, but I think his being a knucklehead gives him an appeal." He believed it was Naruto's losses that made readers identify with him, although he wanted Naruto not to feel defeat again, which was his primary aim when writing the series. Kishimoto has said that Naruto's burning desire to be a ninja was based on his own ambition to succeed as a <a href="manga%20artist">manga artist</a>.

After fans likened Naruto, <a href="Sasuke%20Uchiha">Sasuke Uchiha</a> and <a href="Sakura%20Haruno">Sakura Haruno</a> to the three main characters from "<a href="Harry%20Potter">Harry Potter</a>" fantasy books, Kishimoto noted that both trios began their careers in a classroom, though he added that the similarity was unintentional. During the series' publication, Kishimoto married and had children. This influenced how he viewed Naruto's character. Naruto met his parents, and learned of their sacrifices in order to help him to control the Fox inside him so that he could protect their world. As a result, Naruto appreciated his life more and learned that his parents loved him, something the author wanted the character to feel based on his own experience as a father. In the first chapters of the series, Kishimoto did not conceive the idea that Naruto would be the son of <a href="Minato%20Namikaze">Minato Namikaze</a>. However, as time passed on, the manga author made touches to Minato's face shown in the Hokage Mountain in Konoha to make them more similar to Naruto with an emphasis on their spiky hairs. However, in order to reduce too many similarities, <a href="Kushina%20Uzumaki">Kushina Uzumaki</a>'s character was made to look like Naruto's face. Kishimoto's first editor, Kosuke Yahagi, praised the author for the way he handled Naruto's parents and his heritage.

When first introducing Sasuke, Kishimoto wrote him as a rival who never noticed Naruto. However, as the series continued, Naruto became strong enough to finally be recognized by Sasuke as a rival. He also intended both as brothers due to the fact both characters suffered loneliness, something which made the readers relate to them as he noted through fan letters. By Part I's ending, the bond between Naruto and Sasuke was weakened as a result of their fight but still expected the time when the Sasuke accepted Naruto as an equal. Kishimoto compared Sasuke and Naruto to the concept of <a href="yin%20and%20yang">yin and yang</a> because of their notable differences. When one of the two progressed, Kishimoto made sure the other did too. Before the serialization began, Kishimoto had decided the ending would feature a fight between these two characters. He wanted the conflict to end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato. By 2013 when the series was reaching its climax, Kishimoto told the readers to look forward to the final fight between the two characters. In regards to the fight, Kishimoto wanted to focus on <a href="hand-to-hand%20combat">hand-to-hand combat</a> rather than ninja techniques. Anime staff Chengxi Huang said the animated adaptation of this fight, the group worked carefully to depict the action in every scene by showing changes on Sasuke and Naruto's clothes and hair. Huang added he felt fatigue by working so much into this fight due to reaching 70 successive cuts at a time.

Out of all the student-teacher relationships Kishimoto has created in the "Naruto" series, the bond between Naruto and <a href="Jiraiya%20%28Naruto%29">Jiraiya</a> is his favorite, noting that it makes drawing them "worthwhile." Regarding bonds in the story, Kishimoto remarks the Jiraiya's death in his fight against Pain as in his last moments, he discovers the origin of Pain's multiple bodies and uses his last forces to send it as a message to Naruto so that he could send him as an piece of advice to defeat him in his place.

Naruto's romantic partner was decided during the early stages of the manga. Since <a href="Hinata%20Hyuga">Hinata Hyuga</a> always respected Naruto, even before the series' beginning, even before <a href="Iruka%20Umino">Iruka Umino</a>, Kishimoto felt they were meant to be. This angered his wife who wanted Naruto to marry Sakura Haruno. When Sakura was introduced, Kishimoto did not think of her as Naruto's future wife, as he saw them as being just friends and teammates, although once Hinata had appeared, the author thought of forming a <a href="love%20triangle">love triangle</a> between the three characters. He later regretted the love triangle as he considered "Naruto" a fighting series with little focus on romance, and he reiterated that "it was all about Naruto and Hinata getting married from an early stage."

In the original Japanese versions of "Naruto", Naruto often ends his sentences with the addendum ""-ttebayo"" (which achieves an effect similar to ending a sentence with "you know?" in English). Kishimoto wanted to give Naruto a childlike <a href="catchphrase">catchphrase</a>, and ""dattebayo"" came to mind; he believed that the phrase complements Naruto's character, and served as a verbal <a href="tic">tic</a> that portrayed him in a brattish manner. Throughout the first episodes of the English <a href="Dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29">dub</a> version, ""dattebayo"" and ""-ttebayo"" were replaced with the phrase "Believe it!", both to mirror the effect, and to match the character's lip movements, although later in the english dub Naruto stopped saying "Believe it" and the phrase was replaced with "You Know?".

When seeing the staff's work to focus a film on Naruto's relationship with Hinata, "The Last: Naruto the Movie", Kishimoto decided to oversee the project. Nevertheless, he enjoyed seeing Naruto and Hinata's romantical scenes he did not write. In regards to Naruto's rank which remains as the lowest one, Genin, due to Naruto spending most of his Part II's time fighting and training, Kishimoto decided Naruto would skip the following ranks to become the Hokage, which he felt was appealing. In the making of "The Last: Naruto the Movie", Hinata makes a red scarf for Naruto. This was based on how Kishimoto's wife actually once did which brought laughs to the staff developing the film.

Screenwriter Maruo Kyozuka said that he wanted to depict a love triangle between Naruto, Hinata and Toneri Otsutsuki in the film. Although Naruto is initially clueless about Hinata's feelings for him, during the film he begins to acknowledge and respond to them. Hinata's character was also developed in the film, with Kyozuka saying that she had to put aside her feelings for Naruto to accept Toneri's proposal so she could find Hanabi. During this scene, Kyozuka wanted to depict Naruto at his lowest after his rejection by Hinata. He then returned Naruto to his brave self, with the character resolving to continue his mission regardless of the cost.

In 2013, when "Naruto" was reaching its climax, Kishimoto envisioned the idea of Naruto becoming a father. This resulted in the creation of <a href="Boruto%20Uzumaki">Boruto Uzumaki</a>, Naruto and Hinata's first child. Kishimoto wanted Boruto to act like his father, but at the same time, have differences between each other. Despite not wishing to reveal much about Boruto due to developments of "", he added that Boruto is not as direct as Naruto. In the 2015 film "", Kishimoto developed Boruto and Naruto's relationship from his relationship with his sons. He wanted the film to depict the father and son relationship between Boruto and Naruto. Kishimoto identified Naruto's fights alongside Sasuke against Momoshiki as the highlights of the film and asked that the film's staff pay close attention to those sequences. Two other scenes written by the staff which surprised Kishimoto were Sasuke's combination of his <a href="Susanoo">Susanoo</a> technique and Naruto's recreation of the <a href="List%20of%20Naruto%20characters%23Kurama">Nine-Tailed Fox</a>.

Although a real ninja wears black to be inconspicuous, Kishimoto gave Naruto an orange jumpsuit to fit the "shōnen" genre. His wardrobe is based on clothing that Kishimoto wore when he was younger. According to him, a pre-existing design would not have made Naruto unique, whereas something original would have made him too distinctive. Because Naruto is associated with spirals in terms of objects he uses, the designer incorporated swirl patterns into the costume. Initial illustrations depicted Naruto in boots, but Kishimoto replaced these with sandals, because he enjoys drawing toes. The goggles Naruto used to wear were replaced with a hitai-ite, or shinobi headband, because they were too time-consuming to draw. One of the most difficult design choices was the color palette of Naruto's outfit. The orange in his costume makes Naruto pop and the blue parts are <a href="Complementary%20colors">complementary</a>. Kishimoto apologized to the anime staff for Naruto's design, as he considered it too difficult to animate.

Kishimoto was satisfied with his character having blond hair and blue eyes, something rarely seen in Japanese anime or manga. This also appealed to an international readership, something the editor of the American magazine "<a href="Shonen%20Jump%20%28magazine%29">Shonen Jump</a>" has noted. Of all his series' characters, Kishimoto most identified with Naruto. When asked why Naruto's favorite food was <a href="ramen">ramen</a> instead of <a href="kitsune%20udon">kitsune udon</a>, Kishimoto said that he himself likes eating ramen. In the , Naruto is playable in various stages of the Demon Fox's manifestation, characterized by a red <a href="chakra">chakra</a>. Kishimoto took inspiration from the games' presentation of these forms, imitating one of them for the manga cover of volume 26.

When designing Naruto for his <a href="List%20of%20Naruto%20chapters%20%28Part%20II%29">Part II</a> appearance, Kishimoto changed his character's clothing to an orange and black top, orange pants, and black sandals. He also gave him a red cape with black flames at the bottom when fighting Pain, a member of the Akatsuki. He drew Naruto's forehead-protector wider to make his eyebrows easier to draw, something that had bothered him with his previous design. He also noted that Naruto's pants made the character look too childish. To remedy this, Kishimoto designed them to roll up, giving him a more mature appearance. He gave Naruto this look in order to make him stand out during action scenes.

For the events of the film "" (2014) as well as the final episodes of , Naruto was given a young adult appearance. His hair was made shorter, while his height was expanded notably in contrast to his Part II design. He was given two different outfits, a casual look consisting of an orange shirt as well as a design consisting of a black shirt with orange pants specifically meant for his missions. Due to his growth, Naruto wears a different headband, while his new ninja appearance was created with the purpose of being able to carry weapons more easily. Nevertheless, both looks keep the character's spiralling logo that was carried from his late mother's gone group, the Uzumaki clan.

Although a male voice actor was sought for the Japanese adaptation of the Naruto role, the actress <a href="Junko%20Takeuchi">Junko Takeuchi</a> was chosen instead over many male applicants. Before recording the first episode, Takeuchi noticed several lines from the script that ended with exclamation marks, which helped her to define Naruto's voice. She noted difficulties in transitioning from the young Naruto to the older Naruto in the animated adaptation of Part II. She had to record the first episode of Part II when Naruto's character was older and more mature only one week after voicing the younger, immature character. Nine years after first voicing the character, while still finding it tough to voice Naruto, Takeuchi's opinion of him changed with her feeling he was "a very reliable young man." She admired his ability to prioritize and calmly make important decisions, and believes these traits will inspire viewers worldwide.

The producers of the English version of the anime stated that Naruto was the most difficult character to cast, adding that <a href="Maile%20Flanagan">Maile Flanagan</a> "has Naruto down, from the mischievous side, that precocious 12-year-old we learn to love, to the serious side." Flanagan avoided listening to Junko Takeuchi's performance as she did not want to imitate it, stating she wanted to develop her own voice for the character. Her performance has been praised as showing Naruto's brashness and later growth in confidence. In a 2014 interview, Flanagan claimed she had never heard of "Naruto" before her audition. She looked the show up after being chosen and felt the release of the English dub would be popular. She is recognized more for her work voicing Naruto than from other roles she has done in her career, although some fans did not expect that Naruto would be voiced by a woman.

Introduced as a young orphan boy of 12 years with blond, spiky hair, blue eyes and goggles, Naruto Uzumaki frequently wears an orange tracksuit. Following his ninja graduation he also wore a headband that denotes his position as a ninja from Konohagakure. In Part II of the manga, the now older and larger Naruto wears a different outfit. The Nine-Tailed Demon Fox within influences his body, causing Naruto to resemble the Fox over the course of his battles. While Naruto only shows small changes such as sharp teeth and claws initially, he later develops a red tail made of the Fox's vital energy, or "<a href="Chakra%28Naruto%29">chakra</a>". The red chakra starts by surrounding his body; once four tails are manifested, Naruto's blood begins to merge with the chakra, coloring his entire body red. As the sixth tail appears, Naruto appears to wear the Fox's skeleton, but once Naruto takes control of the fox's chakra, he is able to maintain his regular form while using it. As a ninja, Naruto carries many weapons, but relies mostly on his ninja techniques while fighting, specializing in making clones of himself. Nevertheless, late in the series Naruto starts wielding a pair of "<a href="b%C5%8D">bō</a>" in combat.

Introduced as a childish clown, Naruto seeks attention as he was ridiculed during his childhood. To be accepted and respected, he resolves to become Konohagakure's <a href="Hokage%20%28Naruto%29%23Hokage">Hokage</a> and surpass all previous leaders, no matter the difficulties. While becoming a ninja, Naruto forms friendships that he initially lacked, linking some of them to family relationships. Although Naruto sometimes finds himself unable to accomplish the tasks he proposes to do, other characters believe that he will be an excellent Hokage because of his positive impact on their lives.

Naruto is an orphan who has a dangerous fox-like entity known as Kurama the Nine-Tailed Fox sealed within his body by his father, the <a href="Fourth%20Hokage">Fourth Hokage</a> Minato Namikaze, the leader of Konoha's ninja force, at the cost of his own life and that of his wife, <a href="Kushina%20Uzumaki">Kushina Uzumaki</a>. This possession led to Naruto being ridiculed frequently by the rest of Konoha; being associated with him was considered taboo. As a youth, Naruto makes jokes and plays pranks to attract attention. Desiring what he lacked in his early life, Naruto dreams of becoming a Hokage himself with the hope that it will bring him the villagers' recognition and respect. In an attempt to become a ninja, Naruto is horrified to learn of his "Jinchuriki" nature, but finds acceptance from his teacher <a href="Iruka%20Umino">Iruka Umino</a>, whom he views as a father. After learning the powerful <a href="Shadow%20Clone">Multi-Shadow Clone "Jutsu"</a>, an ability to create physical copies of the user, Naruto becomes a ninja. He joins a ninja group under the leadership of <a href="Kakashi%20Hatake">Kakashi Hatake</a> where he gains the friends he lacked during his childhood. These are his classmates who are also assigned to <a href="List%20of%20Naruto%20characters%23Team%207">Team 7</a>: <a href="Sasuke%20Uchiha">Sasuke Uchiha</a>, with whom he has had a rivalry since they first met at the ninja academy, and <a href="Sakura%20Haruno">Sakura Haruno</a>.

While being examined to increase his ninja rank, Naruto meets the legendary ninja <a href="Jiraiya%20%28Naruto%29">Jiraiya</a> and learns how to <a href="Naruto%20summons">summon</a> toads to aid him in battle, and to control part of the Nine Tails's chakra energy. The exams are interrupted by the invasion of Konohagakure by the criminal <a href="Orochimaru%20%28Naruto%29">Orochimaru</a> and the ninja of Sunagakure. Naruto defeats the sand village's One Tail "Jinchuriki" <a href="Gaara">Gaara</a> and convinces him there is a better way to live. Shortly afterward, Naruto discovers the <a href="Akatsuki%20%28Naruto%29">Akatsuki</a>, a criminal organization that seeks to extract the Nine-Tails from his body. Though Jiraiya drives them off during this first meeting, learning its member Itachi is both Sasuke's brother, and the man who killed their family, the Akatsuki still plan to kidnap Naruto. While accompanying Jiraiya to find a new village leader, Naruto also learns the , a sphere of chakra for offensive purposes. When Sasuke leaves the village to join Orochimaru's forces to obtain the power to kill Itachi, Naruto becomes part of a rescue team to retrieve him. Naruto and Sasuke ultimately have a one-on-one battle, though neither can bring himself to finish off the other. The two go their separate ways, but Naruto does not give up on Sasuke, leaving Konoha with Jiraiya to prepare himself for his next encounter with Sasuke and the Akatsuki.

After his two and a half years of training, Naruto returns to Konoha and begins to deal more actively with the Akatsuki threat by saving Gaara from their clutches. To fight them, Naruto trains with Kakashi to infuse the Rasengan with his own wind-element chakra, creating the attack that proves instrumental in the downfall of the Akatsuki member <a href="Kakuzu">Kakuzu</a>. Despite being targeted by the Akatsuki, Naruto dedicates himself to finding and retrieving Sasuke; he eventually disposes of Orochimaru and starts acting on his vengeance-driven whims. Over time, though resisting the urge to use the creature's power, the Nine Tails's influence over him expands to the point where he begins to lose his rationality as more chakra manifests in the form of tails to the point the Tailed Beast can take control of his body. This ultimately causes him to go on a rampage, destroying everything in his path.

After learning that Jiraiya has been killed by the Akatsuki leader, <a href="Pain%20%28Naruto%29">Pain</a>, Naruto prepares for a future encounter by learning toad-style , a power-enhancing ability involving the gathering of natural energy, while also perfecting Naruto's Rasen-Shuriken in the process. When they finally face off, Naruto defeats Pain and convinces him to quit Akatsuki. At that time, Naruto learns that the Fourth Hokage was his father who sealed the Fox so that Naruto could use it to defeat the Akatsuki founder <a href="Tobi%20%28Naruto%29">Tobi</a> who was behind the Fox's attack on Konohagakure.

When Naruto discovers Sasuke's plan to attack the Leaf Village, he decides to confront him in a battle which could end both their lives should Naruto be unable to save him.

When the "Naruto" manga ended, <a href="Eiichiro%20Oda">Eiichiro Oda</a> drew a cover of a "<a href="One%20Piece">One Piece</a>" manga chapter where Naruto is seen eating with the "One Piece" characters.

In every official "<a href="Weekly%20Sh%C5%8Dnen%20Jump">Weekly Shōnen Jump</a>" popularity poll of the series, Naruto ranks in the top five characters and, as of the beginning of 2012, has been in first place twice. In 2006, Naruto lost his top-two status to the characters <a href="Deidara">Deidara</a>, Kakashi and Sasuke in the magazine's sixth poll. In the 2011 poll, Naruto was once again in first place. In a 2018 poll from "'Shonen Jump", Naruto was also voted as the 10th most powerful character in the magazine's history.

Merchandise has been modeled after Naruto, including <a href="keychain">keychain</a>s, and action figures. In the 2009 Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Awards, Junko Takeuchi won Best Voice Actress (Japanese) for her work as Naruto. Naruto was placed sixth in <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time with writer Chris Mackenzie stating that although: "Naruto actually isn't the most popular character in his own series most of the time," he is "the engine that powers the franchise." In the 2011 "<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records%20Gamer%27s%20Edition">Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition</a>", he was noted as the twenty-ninth best character appearing in video games. While working for <a href="CyberConnect2">CyberConnect2</a> in the making of the "<a href=".hack%20%28video%20game%20series%29">.hack</a>" games, character designer <a href="Yoshiyuki%20Sadamoto">Yoshiyuki Sadamoto</a> used Naruto as a model for ".hack"s protagonist, <a href="Kite%20%28.hack%29">Kite</a>. Shortly afterwards, CyberConnect2 started developing the "Naruto: Ultimate Ninja" games although Sadamoto recalls he was unaware this fact. CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama also participated in the 2012 <a href="Paris%20Marathon">Paris Marathon</a> while <a href="cosplaying">cosplaying</a> as Naruto to celebrating the release of a new video game. Matsuyama also said that Naruto's Rasenshuriken was his favorite technique in the entire series due to its sounds as well as how the character executes it. In 2014, IGN listed him as the second best "Naruto" character when the series ended. Theatergoers for the "Boruto" film were given two different types of fans with one of them using Naruto and Boruto's images. In a Japanese TV special from August 2017, Naruto was voted as the 13th "strongest hero" from the <a href="Heisei%20Era">Heisei Era</a>. Additionally, in 2017 Charapedia poll, Naruto ranked 9th most ideal Prime Minister in anime series. For the upcoming <a href="2020%20Summer%20Olympics">2020 Summer Olympics</a>, Naruto's image is being used as a character to represent the event.

Naruto's character has received mostly positive critical response in printed and online publications. Praise was given by Joseph Szadkowski of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Times">The Washington Times</a>" who noted that Naruto "has become a pop-culture sensation." Naruto's character was analyzed by <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Joe Dodson who noted that despite having an "ideal" life, he still suffered from severe isolation, although he was praised for his optimistic personality by Carl Kimlinger of <a href="Anime%20News%20Network">Anime News Network</a> (ANN). Writers for Mania Entertainment labeled him a "good lead character" with good overall development despite certain problems at the beginning. Christina Carpenter of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews disagreed with other writers, noting that while Naruto is a "likable enough scamp," his type of character has been done before in many anime and manga series. <a href="Yukari%20Fujimoto">Yukari Fujimoto</a>, a professor at <a href="Meiji%20University">Meiji University</a>, sees Naruto himself as the manga's weakness. A study which looked at if readers could predict character types based on physical cues regarded Naruto as a <a href="ENFP">ENFP</a> (<a href="Myers%E2%80%93Briggs%20Type%20Indicator">Myers-Briggs</a>) character type, impulsive and spontaneous, finding a <a href="Foil%20%28literature%29">foil</a> in the ISTJ-type Sasuke.

Writing for "Popular Culture in Counseling, Psychotherapy, and Play-Based Interventions", Lawrence Rubin states that while Naruto has an optimistic and hyperactive personality, the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox (Kurama) within his body symbolizes his negative emotions. He comments that Naruto has a <a href="wikt%3Amalevolent">malevolent</a> attitude when dealing with intense conflicts and emotions. He also states that Naruto would use Kurama's chakra for battles he can not handle with his own chakra. Rubin further notes that the more Naruto uses Kurama's chakra, the more he puts his comrades and himself in danger. Rubin feels the reason Naruto is a troublemaker is because some villagers avoid him and others mistreat him. He states that children growing up in the real world who have development issues can relate to his character. Rubin states that the search for <a href="acceptance">acceptance</a>, and being acknowledged by his peers is what motivates Naruto to keep going until he reaches his life's goal, becoming the Hokage. Rubin feels that Naruto's fights with enemies who try to bring harm to the Leaf Village further motivate him to become a powerful <a href="shinobi">shinobi</a>, and a "complete and mature person." Rubin concludes that Naruto's character development is similar to that of a modern American <a href="hero">hero</a>, the type who accidentally becomes better during a series and is able to build or restore peace.
Christopher A. Born, writing for <a href="DOAJ">DOAJ</a> journal "ASIANetwork Exchange", regards Naruto as a complex <a href="post-modern">post-modern</a> hero, showing "great heart." From Naruto's beginning, Born comments that the character is a <a href="wikt%3Anuisance">nuisance</a>, suggesting Naruto is the very definition of the word, given how he is characterized in the series, including how he interacts, and his behavior. Born argues that "Naruto" as a whole shows <a href="Confucian%20values">Confucian values</a>, and that Naruto himself unsettles <a href="Wa%20%28Japanese%20culture%29">harmony in society</a>. Amy Plumb, a PhD candidate at <a href="Macquarie%20University">Macquarie University</a>, states that Kishimoto used the mythology of the <a href="kitsune">kitsune</a> for Naruto's development throughout the series. She notes that at the beginning of the series, Naruto was a prankster and always causing trouble, the same as the kitsune. Plumb describes the Kyuubi (Demon) seal on Naruto's stomach as a <a href="wikt%3Acatalyst">catalyst</a> for how he develops. Writing for "Manga's Cultural Crossroads", Omote Tomoyuki compliments Naruto's character, saying that he has great ambition to achieve a tragic destiny. He comments how the character has matured over the course of the series, stating how after he became a "shinobi", he had let go of his childish ways that happened in the beginning of the series, and how he rarely joked around in Part II of the series when he became a teenager. Franziska Ehmcke, professor of Japanese studies at Cologne University, theorized that Naruto was named after whirlpools of the sea landscape of the <a href="Naruto%20whirlpools">Awa no Naruto</a>, and compared his behavior to that natural feature, as both figures have uncontrollable energy within them. Mike Hale compared Naruto to <a href="Buffy%20Summers">Buffy Summers</a> of "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>", praising the series' portrayal of childhood loneliness. Rik Spanjers regards Naruto's childishness as one of his strengths because it gives him a well of resoluteness from which to draw on in his goal to end the ninja wars.
His relationships with the other characters was described as appealing by IGN's Charles White and Jason Van Horn, most notably through his rivalry with Sasuke, as it shows "signs of maturity" in Naruto. However, his wish to retrieve Sasuke after the end of Part I was criticised because of his subsequent suffering. In a poll by Japanese pollster Charapedia, Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry reached the top place. Jacob Hope Chapman of ANN listed Naruto and Sasuke as one of "Anime's Fiercest Frenemies" considering their similarities and how they become friends after a mortal battle. Amy McNulty of ANN also praised their final fight, expressing amazement at how brutal some scenes were since Naruto had become more of a pacifist than previous story arcs. His romantic involvement with other characters led to disputes as there were fans in favour of his relationship with Sakura Haruno, while others preferred Hinata Hyuga. His romance with Hinata in the film "The Last" earned multiple positive reactions from the media. Some critics wished "The Last" could be condensed so that their relationship was the focus of the movie. On a similar note, both McNulty and Andy Hanley from UK Anime Network enjoyed Naruto's relationship with his son Boruto due to the differences in their childhoods and how that becomes the focus of the film "Boruto".

Kimlinger of Anime News Network said that while Naruto's initial fight scenes are lacking conviction when compared to others, his encounter with <a href="Gaara">Gaara</a> is one of his best moments because its tactics surpassed most "shōnen" stereotypes. ANN's Theron Martin and Mania Entertainment's Justin Rich made similar comments. The character's final fight against Sasuke at the end of Part I attracted similar responses, due to the fighting styles employed, and the character development resulting from their rivalry. The enormous physical changes caused by the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox have also been the focus of critics, as Naruto's loss of control causes him to become a bigger threat to his loved ones than other series' antagonists. Carlo Santos of ANN commented on the character's growth in Part II, specifically his fight against Pain in which Naruto's comments on peace, and the means by which it is achieved, touch on philosophical themes never seen in a "shōnen" series. Chris Beveridge of Mania Entertainment noted a change in Naruto's attitude as he acts calmly and more seriously than in previous story arcs. Naruto's new Senjutsu style was praised, as was his careful preparation for the fight against Pain, which resulted in a detailed display of his skills. Allega Frank from <a href="Polygon">Polygon</a> noted that during the start of both the manga and anime "Boruto: Naruto Next Generations", multiple fans were worried in regards to a flashforward; in this sequence an older Boruto is facing an enemy named Kawaki who implies Naruto might be dead so his fate left them worried. Singer <a href="Diana%20Garnet">Diana Garnet</a> expressed her pleasure at recording one of the ending theme songs for the animated series of "Naruto Shippuden" stating that not only she has been a fan of the series ever since she was younger, but was also motivated by Naruto's character because of his determination not to give up no matter what challenge he faced.

In March 2018, Chinese animator Chengxi Huang posted a video of Naruto and Hinata embracing each other naked. The image got disapproval from young fans as they considered it "gross". Huang's apology stated that the animation was simply practice, and that he wanted to portray the everyday life of a married couple but still deleted the video in response.

Wells Cathedral

Wells Cathedral is an <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> <a href="cathedral">cathedral</a> in <a href="Wells%2C%20Somerset">Wells, Somerset</a>, England, dedicated to <a href="St%20Andrew%20the%20Apostle">St Andrew the Apostle</a> and seat of the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bath%20and%20Wells">Bishop of Bath and Wells</a>, whose throne or "<a href="cathedra">cathedra</a>" it holds as mother church of the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Bath%20and%20Wells">diocese</a>. Built between 1175 and 1490 to replace an earlier church on the site since 705, it is moderately sized for an English cathedral. Its broad west front and large central tower are dominant features in the city and countryside. It has been called "unquestionably one of the most beautiful" and "most poetic" of English cathedrals. Its <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic architecture</a> is mostly in the <a href="Early%20English%20Gothic">Early English style</a> of the late 12th–early 13th centuries, lacking the <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> work that survives in many other cathedrals. Building began about 1175 at the east end with the <a href="Choir%20%28architecture%29">choir</a>. Historian <a href="John%20Harvey%20%28historian%29">John Harvey</a> sees it as Europe's first truly Gothic structure, breaking with the last constraints of Romanesque. The stonework of its pointed <a href="arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcade</a>s and fluted <a href="Pier%20%28architecture%29">piers</a> bears pronounced mouldings and carved <a href="Capital%20%28architecture%29">capitals</a> in a foliate, "stiff leaf" style. Its Early English front with 300 sculpted figures, is described as a "supreme triumph of the combined plastic arts in England". The east end retains a rare amount of ancient <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a>. Unlike many cathedrals of monastic foundation, Wells has many surviving secular buildings linked to its chapter of <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">secular canons</a>, including the <a href="Bishop%27s%20Palace%2C%20Wells">Bishop's Palace</a> and the 15th-century residential <a href="Vicars%27%20Close%2C%20Wells">Vicars' Close</a>. The cathedral is a <a href="Grade%20I%20listed%20building">Grade I listed building</a>.
The earliest remains of a building on the site are of a late-<a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman</a> <a href="mausoleum">mausoleum</a>, identified during excavations in 1980. An abbey church was built in Wells in 705 by <a href="Aldhelm">Aldhelm</a>, first bishop of the newly established <a href="Bishop%20of%20Sherborne">Diocese of Sherborne</a> during the reign of King <a href="Ine%20of%20Wessex">Ine of Wessex</a>. It was dedicated to <a href="Andrew%20the%20Apostle">Saint Andrew</a> and stood at the site of the cathedral's <a href="cloister">cloister</a>s, where some excavated remains can be seen. The <a href="baptismal%20font">font</a> in the cathedral's south <a href="transept">transept</a> is from this church and is the oldest part of the present building. In 766 <a href="Cynewulf%20of%20Wessex">Cynewulf</a>, <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Wessex">King of Wessex</a>, signed a charter endowing the church with eleven <a href="Hide%20%28unit%29">hides</a> of land. In 909 the seat of the diocese was moved from Sherborne to Wells.

The first Bishop of Wells was <a href="Athelm">Athelm</a> (909), who crowned <a href="%C3%86thelstan">King Æthelstan</a>. Athelm and his nephew <a href="Dunstan">Dunstan</a> both became <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishops of Canterbury</a>. During this period a choir of boys was established to sing the <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a>. <a href="Wells%20Cathedral%20School">Wells Cathedral School</a>, which was established to educate these choirboys, dates its foundation to this point. There is, however, some controversy over this. Following the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a>, <a href="John%20of%20Tours">John de Villula</a> moved the seat of the bishop from Wells to Bath in 1090. The church at Wells, no longer a cathedral, had a college of <a href="secular%20clergy">secular clergy</a>.

The cathedral is thought to have been conceived and commenced in about 1175 by <a href="Reginald%20Fitz%20Jocelin">Reginald Fitz Jocelin</a>, who died in 1191. Although it is clear from its size that from the outset, the church was planned to be the cathedral of the diocese, the seat of the bishop moved between Wells and the abbeys of <a href="Glastonbury%20Abbey">Glastonbury</a> and <a href="Bath%20Abbey">Bath</a>, before settling at Wells. In 1197 Reginald's successor, <a href="Savaric%20FitzGeldewin">Savaric FitzGeldewin</a>, with the approval of <a href="Pope%20Celestine%20III">Pope Celestine III</a>, officially moved his seat to Glastonbury Abbey. The title of Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury was used until the Glastonbury claim was abandoned in 1219.

Savaric's successor, <a href="Jocelin%20of%20Wells">Jocelin of Wells</a>, again moved the bishop's seat to Bath Abbey, with the title Bishop of Bath. Jocelin was a brother of <a href="Hugh%20of%20Wells">Hugh (II) of Lincoln</a> and was present at the signing of the <a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a>. Jocelin continued the building campaign begun by Reginald and was responsible for the <a href="Bishop%27s%20Palace%2C%20Wells">Bishop's Palace</a>, the <a href="choir">chorister</a>s' school, a <a href="grammar%20school">grammar school</a>, a hospital for travellers and a chapel. He also had a manor house built at <a href="Wookey">Wookey</a>, near Wells. Jocelin saw the church dedicated in 1239 but, despite much lobbying of the Pope by Jocelin's representatives in Rome, did not live to see cathedral status granted. The delay may have been a result of inaction by <a href="Pandulf%20Verraccio">Pandulf Verraccio</a>, a Roman ecclesiastical politician, papal legate to England and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Norwich">Bishop of Norwich</a>, who was asked by the Pope to investigate the situation but did not respond. Jocelin died at Wells on 19 November 1242 and was buried in the choir of the cathedral; the <a href="Monumental%20brass">memorial brass</a> on his tomb is one of the earliest brasses in England. Following his death the monks of Bath unsuccessfully attempted to regain authority over Wells.

In 1245 the ongoing dispute over the title of the bishop was resolved by a ruling of <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20IV">Pope Innocent IV</a> who established the title as the "Bishop of Bath and Wells", as it has remained until this day, with Wells as the principal seat of the bishop. Since the 11th century the church has had a <a href="Cathedral%20chapter">chapter</a> of secular clergy, like the cathedrals of <a href="Chichester%20Cathedral">Chichester</a>, <a href="Hereford%20Cathedral">Hereford</a>, <a href="Lincoln%20Cathedral">Lincoln</a> and <a href="York%20Minster">York</a>. The chapter was endowed with 22 <a href="prebendary">prebends</a> (lands from which finance was drawn) and a provost to manage them. On acquiring cathedral status, in common with other such cathedrals, it had four chief clergy, the <a href="Dean%20%28Christianity%29">dean</a>, <a href="precentor">precentor</a>, <a href="Chancellor%20%28ecclesiastical%29">chancellor</a> and <a href="sacristan">sacristan</a>, who were responsible for the spiritual and material care of the cathedral.

The building programme, begun by Reginald Fitz Jocelin, Bishop in the 12th century, continued under Jocelin of Wells, who was a canon from 1200, then bishop from 1206. Adam Locke was master mason from about 1192 until 1230. It was designed in the new style with pointed arches, later known as <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a>, which was introduced at about the same time at <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a>. Work was halted between 1209 and 1213 when <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">King John</a> was <a href="Excommunication">excommunicated</a> and Jocelin was in exile, but the main parts of the church were complete by the time of the dedication by Jocelin in 1239.

By the time the cathedral, including the <a href="chapter%20house">chapter house</a>, was finished in 1306, it was already too small for the developing liturgy, and unable to accommodate increasingly grand processions of clergy. <a href="John%20Droxford">John Droxford</a> initiated another phase of building under master mason Thomas of Whitney, during which the central tower was heightened and an eight-sided <a href="Lady%20chapel">Lady chapel</a> was added at the east end by 1326. <a href="Ralph%20of%20Shrewsbury">Ralph of Shrewsbury</a> followed, continuing the eastward extension of the choir and <a href="retrochoir">retrochoir</a> beyond. He oversaw the building of <a href="Vicars%27%20Close%2C%20Wells">Vicars' Close</a> and the Vicars' Hall, to give the men who were employed to sing in the choir a secure place to live and dine, away from the town and its temptations. He had an uneasy relationship with the citizens of Wells, partly because of his imposition of taxes, and he surrounded his palace with <a href="Battlement">crenellated</a> walls, a moat and a drawbridge.

<a href="John%20Harewell">John Harewell</a> raised money for the completion of the west front by <a href="William%20Wynford">William Wynford</a>, who was appointed as master mason in 1365. One of the foremost architects of his time, Wynford worked for the king at <a href="Windsor%2C%20Berkshire">Windsor</a>, <a href="Winchester%20Cathedral">Winchester Cathedral</a> and <a href="New%20College%2C%20Oxford">New College, Oxford</a>. At Wells, he designed the western towers of which north-west was not built until the following century. In the 14th century, the central <a href="Pier%20%28architecture%29">piers</a> of the <a href="crossing%20%28architecture%29">crossing</a> were found to be sinking under the weight of the crossing tower which had been damaged by an earthquake in the previous century. Strainer arches, sometimes described as scissor arches, were inserted by master mason <a href="William%20Joy">William Joy</a> to brace and stabilise the piers as a unit.

By the reign of <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII</a> the cathedral was complete, appearing much as it does today (though the fittings have changed). From 1508 to 1546, the eminent Italian <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">humanist</a> scholar <a href="Polydore%20Vergil">Polydore Vergil</a> was active as the chapter's representative in London. He donated a set of hangings for the <a href="Choir%20%28architecture%29">choir</a> of the cathedral. While Wells survived the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a> better than the cathedrals of monastic foundation, the abolition of chantries in 1547 resulted in a reduction in its income. <a href="Middle%20Ages">Medieval</a> brasses were sold, and a <a href="pulpit">pulpit</a> was placed in the <a href="nave">nave</a> for the first time. Between 1551 and 1568, in two periods as dean, <a href="William%20Turner%20%28naturalist%29">William Turner</a> established a <a href="herb%20garden">herb garden</a>, which was recreated between 2003 and 2010.

<a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a> gave the chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, creating a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to <a href="the%20Crown">the Crown</a>). The stability brought by the new charter ended with the onset of the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> and the execution of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, <a href="Walter%20Raleigh%20%28priest%29">Walter Raleigh</a>, a nephew of the explorer <a href="Walter%20Raleigh">Walter Raleigh</a>, was placed under house arrest after the fall of <a href="Bridgwater">Bridgwater</a> to the <a href="Roundhead">Parliamentarians</a> in 1645, first in the rectory at <a href="Chedzoy">Chedzoy</a> and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailer, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall. During the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20England">Commonwealth of England</a> under <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair. The bishop went into retirement and some of the clerics were reduced to performing menial tasks.

In 1661, after <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> was restored to the throne, <a href="Robert%20Creighton">Robert Creighton</a>, the king's chaplain in exile, was appointed dean and was bishop for two years before his death in 1672. His brass <a href="lectern">lectern</a>, given in thanksgiving, can be seen in the cathedral. He donated the nave's great west window at a cost of £140. Following Creighton's appointment as bishop, the post of dean went to <a href="Ralph%20Bathurst">Ralph Bathurst</a>, who had been chaplain to the king, president of <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Oxford">Trinity College, Oxford</a> and fellow of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>. During Bathurst's long tenure the cathedral was restored, but in the <a href="Monmouth%20Rebellion">Monmouth Rebellion</a> of 1685, Puritan soldiers damaged the west front, tore lead from the roof to make bullets, broke the windows, smashed the organ and furnishings, and for a time stabled their horses in the nave.

Restoration began again under <a href="Thomas%20Ken">Thomas Ken</a> who was appointed by the Crown in 1685 and served until 1691. He was one of seven bishops imprisoned for refusing to sign <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">King James II's</a> "<a href="Declaration%20of%20Indulgence">Declaration of Indulgence</a>", which would have enabled Catholics to resume positions of political power, but popular support led to their acquittal. Ken refused to take the oath of allegiance to <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a> and <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Mary II</a> because James II had not abdicated and with others, known as the <a href="Nonjuring%20schism">Nonjurors</a>, was put out of office. His successor, <a href="Richard%20Kidder">Richard Kidder</a>, was killed in the <a href="Great%20Storm%20of%201703">Great Storm of 1703</a> when two chimney stacks on the palace fell on him and his wife, while they were asleep in bed.

By the middle of the 19th century, a major <a href="Victorian%20restoration">restoration programme</a> was needed. Under <a href="Edmund%20Goodenough">Dean Goodenough</a>, the monuments were moved to the cloisters and the remaining medieval paint and <a href="whitewash">whitewash</a> removed in an operation known as "the great scrape". <a href="Anthony%20Salvin">Anthony Salvin</a> took charge of the extensive restoration of the choir. Wooden galleries installed in the 16th century were removed and the stalls were given stone canopies and placed further back within the line of the arcade. The medieval stone <a href="pulpitum">pulpitum</a> screen was extended in the centre to support a new organ.

In 1933 the Friends of Wells Cathedral were formed to support the cathedral's chapter in the maintenance of the fabric, life and work of the cathedral.

The late 20th century saw an extensive restoration programme, particularly of the west front. The stained glass is currently under restoration, with a programme underway to conserve the large 14th-century <a href="Tree%20of%20Jesse">Jesse Tree</a> window at the eastern terminal of the choir.

Since the 13th century, Wells Cathedral has been the seat of the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bath%20and%20Wells">Bishop of Bath and Wells</a>. Its governing body, the <a href="Chapter%20%28religion%29">chapter</a>, is made up of five clerical canons (the dean, the precentor, the canon chancellor, the canon treasurer, and the archdeacon of Wells) and four lay members: the administrator (chief executive), Keeper of the Fabric, Overseer of the Estate and the chairman of the cathedral shop and catering boards. The current Bishop of Bath and Wells is <a href="Peter%20Hancock">Peter Hancock</a>, who was installed in a service in the Cathedral on 7 June 2014. Since the retirement of Dean <a href="John%20Clarke%20%28dean%20of%20Wells%29">John Clarke</a>, the acting dean is Andrew Featherstone.

Employed staff include the organist and master of choristers, head <a href="Verger">virger</a>, archivist, librarian and the staff of the shop, café and restaurant. The chapter is advised by specialists such as architects, archaeologists and financial experts.

More than a thousand services are held every year. There are daily services of <a href="Matins">Matins</a>, Holy Communion and Choral Evensong, as well as major celebrations of Christian festivals such as Christmas, Easter, <a href="Pentecost">Pentecost</a> and <a href="Saint%27s%20Day">saints' days</a>. The cathedral is also used for the baptisms, weddings and funerals of those with close connections to it. In July 2009 the cathedral undertook the funeral of <a href="Harry%20Patch">Harry Patch</a>, the last <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> veteran of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, who died at the age of 111.

Three Sunday services are led by the resident choir (during the school terms) and choral services are sung on weekdays. The cathedral hosts visiting choirs and is involved in outreach work with local schools as part of its Chorister Outreach Project. It is also the venue for musical events such as an annual concert by the <a href="Somerset%20Chamber%20Choir">Somerset Chamber Choir</a>.

Each year about 150,000 people attend services and another 300,000 visit as tourists. Entry is free, but visitors are encouraged to make a donation towards the annual running costs which were around £1.5 million in 2015.
As of 8 February 2019:

Construction of the cathedral began in about 1175, to the design of an unknown architect. Wells is the first cathedral in England to be, from its foundation, built in the Gothic style. According to art historian <a href="John%20Harvey%20%28historian%29">John Harvey</a>, it is the first truly Gothic cathedral in the world, its architects having entirely dispensed with all the features that bound the contemporary east end of Canterbury Cathedral and the earlier buildings of France, such as the east end of the <a href="Basilica%20of%20St%20Denis">Abbey of Saint Denis</a>, to the Romanesque. Unlike these churches, Wells has clustered piers rather than columns and has a gallery of identical pointed arches rather than the typically Romanesque form of paired openings. The style, with its simple untraceried <a href="lancet%20arch">lancet arch</a>es and convoluted mouldings, is known as <a href="Early%20English%20Gothic">Early English Gothic</a>.

From about 1192 to 1230, Adam Lock, the earliest architect at Wells for whom a name is known, continued the transept and nave in the same manner as his predecessor. Lock was also the builder of the north porch, to his own design.

The Early English west front was commenced around 1230 by Thomas Norreys, with building and sculpture continuing for thirty years. Its south-west tower was begun 100 years later and constructed between 1365 and 1395, and the north-west tower between 1425 and 1435, both in the <a href="Perpendicular%20Gothic">Perpendicular Gothic</a> style to the design of William Wynford, who also filled many of the cathedral's early English <a href="lancet%20window">lancet window</a>s with delicate <a href="tracery">tracery</a>.
Between 1275 and 1310 the <a href="undercroft">undercroft</a> and chapter house were built by unknown architects, the undercroft in the Early English and the chapter house in the Geometric style of <a href="Decorated%20Gothic">Decorated Gothic</a> architecture. In about 1310 work commenced on the Lady Chapel, to the design of Thomas Witney, who also built the central tower from 1315 to 1322 in the Decorated Gothic style. The tower was later braced internally with arches by William Joy. Concurrent with this work, in 1329–45 Joy made alterations and extensions to the choir, joining it to the Lady Chapel with the retrochoir, the latter in the <a href="Flowing%20Decorated">Flowing Decorated</a> style.

Later changes include the Perpendicular vault of the tower and construction of Sugar's Chapel, 1475–90 by <a href="William%20Smyth%20%28architect%29">William Smyth</a>. Also, Gothic Revival renovations were made to the choir and pulpitum by <a href="Benjamin%20Ferrey">Benjamin Ferrey</a> and Anthony Salvin, 1842–57.

Wells has a total length of . In common with Canterbury, Lincoln and <a href="Salisbury%20Cathedral">Salisbury</a> cathedrals, it has the distinctly English arrangement of two transepts, with the body of the church divided into distinct parts: nave, choir, and retro-choir, beyond which extends the Lady Chapel. The façade is wide, with its towers extending beyond the transepts on either side. There is a large projecting porch on the north side of the nave forming an entry into the cathedral. To the north-east is the large octagonal chapter house, entered from the north choir aisle by a passage and staircase. To the south of the nave is a large cloister, unusual in that the northern range, that adjacent the cathedral, was never built.

In section, the cathedral has the usual arrangement of a large church: a central nave with an aisle on each side, separated by two arcades. The elevation is in three stages, <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcade</a>, <a href="Triforium">triforium gallery</a> and <a href="clerestory">clerestory</a>. The nave is in height, very low compared to the Gothic cathedrals of France. It has a markedly horizontal emphasis, caused by the triforium having a unique form, a series of identical narrow openings, lacking the usual definition of the bays. The triforium is separated from the arcade by a single horizontal <a href="string%20course">string course</a> that runs unbroken the length of the nave. There are no vertical lines linking the three stages, as the shafts supporting the vault rise above the triforium.

The exterior of Wells Cathedral presents a relatively tidy and harmonious appearance since the greater part of the building was executed in a single style, <a href="Early%20English%20Gothic">Early English Gothic</a>. This is uncommon among English cathedrals where the exterior usually exhibits a plethora of styles. At Wells, later changes in the Perpendicular style were universally applied, such as filling the Early English lancet windows with simple tracery, the construction of a <a href="parapet">parapet</a> that encircles the roof, and the addition of <a href="pinnacle">pinnacle</a>s framing each <a href="gable">gable</a>, similar to those around the chapter house and on the west front. At the eastern end there is a proliferation of tracery with repeated motifs in the Reticulated style, a stage between Geometric and Flowing Decorated tracery.

The west front is high and wide, and built of <a href="Inferior%20Oolite">Inferior Oolite</a> of the <a href="Middle%20Jurassic">Middle Jurassic</a> period, which came from the <a href="Doulting%20Stone%20Quarry">Doulting Stone Quarry</a>, about to the east. According to the <a href="architectural%20historian">architectural historian</a> <a href="Alec%20Clifton-Taylor">Alec Clifton-Taylor</a>, it is "one of the great sights of England".

West fronts in general take three distinct forms: those that follow the elevation of the nave and aisles, those that have paired towers at the end of each aisle, framing the nave, and those that screen the form of the building. The west front at Wells has the paired-tower form, unusual in that the towers do not indicate the location of the aisles, but extend well beyond them, screening the dimensions and profile of the building.

The west front rises in three distinct stages, each clearly defined by a horizontal course. This horizontal emphasis is counteracted by six strongly projecting buttresses defining the cross-sectional divisions of nave, aisles and towers, and are highly decorated, each having canopied niches containing the largest statues on the façade.

At the lowest level of the façade is a plain base, contrasting with and stabilising the ornate arcades that rise above it. The base is penetrated by three doors, which are in stark contrast to the often imposing portals of French Gothic cathedrals. The outer two are of domestic proportion and the central door is ornamented only by a central post, <a href="quatrefoil">quatrefoil</a> and the fine mouldings of the arch.

Above the basement rise two storeys, ornamented with quatrefoils and niches originally holding about four hundred statues, with three hundred surviving until the mid-20th century. Since then, some have been restored or replaced, including the ruined figure of Christ in the gable.

The third stages of the flanking towers were both built in the Perpendicular style of the late 14th century, to the design of William Wynford; that on the north-west was not begun until about 1425. The design maintains the general proportions, and continues the strong projection of the buttresses.

The finished product has been criticised for its lack of pinnacles, and it is probable that the towers were intended to carry spires which were never built. Despite its lack of spires or pinnacles, the architectural historian <a href="Banister%20Fletcher%20%28junior%29">Banister Fletcher</a> describes it as "the highest development in English Gothic of this type of façade." 

The sculptures on the west front at Wells include standing figures, seated figures, half-length angels and narratives in high relief. Many of the figures are life-sized or larger, and together they constitute the finest display of medieval carving in England. The figures and many of the architectural details were painted in bright colours, and the colouring scheme has been deduced from flakes of paint still adhering to some surfaces. The sculptures occupy nine architectural zones stretching horizontally across the entire west front and around the sides and the eastern <a href="return%20%28architecture%29">returns</a> of the towers which extend beyond the aisles. The strongly projecting buttresses have tiers of niches which contain many of the largest figures. Other large figures, including that of Christ, occupy the gable. A single figure stands in one of two later niches high on the northern tower.

In 1851 the archaeologist <a href="Charles%20Robert%20Cockerell">Charles Robert Cockerell</a> published his analysis of the iconography, numbering the nine sculptural divisions from the lowest to the highest. He defined the theme as "a calendar for unlearned men" illustrating the doctrines and history of the Christian faith, its introduction to Britain and its protection by princes and bishops. He likens the arrangement and iconography to the <a href="Te%20Deum">Te Deum</a>.

According to Cockerell, the side of the façade that is to the south of the central door is the more sacred and the scheme is divided accordingly. The lowest range of niches each contained a standing figure, of which all but four figures on the west front, two on each side, have been destroyed. More have survived on the northern and eastern sides of the north tower. Cockerell speculates that those to the south of the portal represented prophets and patriarchs of the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> while those to the north represented early missionaries to Britain, of which <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">Augustine of Canterbury</a>, <a href="St%20Birinus">St Birinus</a>, and <a href="Benedict%20Biscop">Benedict Biscop</a> are identifiable by their <a href="Saint%20symbolism">attributes</a>. In the second zone, above each pair of standing figures, is a quatrefoil containing a half-length angel in relief, some of which have survived. Between the gables of the niches are quatrefoils that contain a series of narratives from the Bible, with the Old Testament stories to the south, above the prophets and patriarchs, and those from the New Testament to the north. A horizontal course runs around the west front dividing the architectural storeys at this point.

Above the course, zones four and five, as identified by Cockerell, contain figures which represent the Christian Church in Britain, with the spiritual lords such as bishops, abbots, abbesses and saintly founders of monasteries on the south, while kings, queens and princes occupy the north. Many of the figures survive and many have been identified in the light of their various attributes. There is a hierarchy of size, with the more significant figures larger and enthroned in their niches rather than standing. Immediately beneath the upper course are a series of small niches containing dynamic sculptures of the dead coming forth from their tombs on the <a href="Day%20of%20Judgement">Day of Judgement</a>. Although naked, some of the dead are defined as royalty by their crowns and others as bishops by their mitres. Some emerge from their graves with joy and hope, and others with despair.

The niches in the lowest zone of the gable contain nine angels, of which Cockerell identifies Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel. In the next zone are the taller figures of the twelve apostles, some, such as John, Andrew and Bartholomew, clearly identifiable by the attributes that they carry. The uppermost niches of the gable contained the figure of Christ the Judge at the centre, with the Virgin Mary on his right and John the Baptist on his left. The figures all suffered from <a href="iconoclasm">iconoclasm</a>. A new statue of Jesus was carved for the central niche, but the two side niches now contain <a href="cherub">cherub</a>im. Christ and the Virgin Mary are also represented by now headless figures in a <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20Virgin">Coronation of the Virgin</a> in a niche above the central portal. A damaged figure of the Virgin and Christ Child occupies a quatrefoil in the <a href="spandrel">spandrel</a> of the door.
The central tower appears to date from the early 13th century. It was substantially reconstructed in the early 14th century during the remodelling of the east end, necessitating the internal bracing of the piers a decade or so later. In the 14th century the tower was given a timber and lead spire which burnt down in 1439. The exterior was then reworked in the Perpendicular style and given the present parapet and pinnacles. Alec Clifton-Taylor describes it as "outstanding even in Somerset, a county famed for the splendour of its church towers".

The north porch is described by art historian <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> as "sumptuously decorated", and intended to be the main entrance. Externally it is simple and rectangular with plain side walls. The entrance is a steeply arched portal framed by rich mouldings of eight shafts with stiff-leaf capitals each encircled by an <a href="Annulet%20%28architecture%29">annular</a> moulding at middle height. Those on the left are figurative, containing images representing the martyrdom of St <a href="Edmund%20the%20Martyr">Edmund the Martyr</a>. The walls are lined with deep niches framed by narrow shafts with capitals and annulets like those of the portal.

The cloisters were built in the late 13th century and largely rebuilt from 1430 to 1508 and have wide openings divided by <a href="mullion">mullion</a>s and <a href="Transom%20%28architectural%29">transom</a>s, and tracery in the Perpendicular Gothic style. The vault has <a href="Lierne%20%28vault%29">lierne</a> ribs that form octagons at the centre of each compartment, the joints of each rib having decorative <a href="Boss%20%28architecture%29">bosses</a>. The eastern range is of two storeys, of which the upper is the library built in the 15th century.

Because Wells Cathedral was secular rather than monastic, cloisters were not a practical necessity. They were omitted from several other secular cathedrals but were built here and at Chichester. Explanations for their construction at these two secular cathedrals range from the processional to the aesthetic. As at Chichester, there is no northern range to the cloisters. In monastic cloisters it was the north range, benefiting most from winter sunlight, that was often used as a <a href="scriptorium">scriptorium</a>.

In 1969, when a large chunk of stone fell from a statue near the main door, it became apparent that there was an urgent need for restoration of the west front. Detailed studies of the stonework and of conservation practices were undertaken under the cathedral architect, Alban D. R. Caroe and a restoration committee formed. The methods that were selected for conservation were those devised by Eve and Robert Baker. W. A. (Bert) Wheeler, clerk of works to the cathedral 1935–1978, had previously experimented with washing and surface-treatment of architectural carvings on the building and his techniques were among those tried on the statues.

The conservation was carried out between 1974 and 1986, wherever possible using non-invasive procedures such as washing with water and a solution of <a href="Lime%20%28material%29">lime</a>, filling gaps and damaged surfaces with soft mortar to prevent the ingress of water and stabilising statues that were fracturing because of the corrosion of metal dowels. The surfaces were finished by painting with a thin coat of mortar and <a href="silane">silane</a> to resist further erosion and attack by pollutants. The restoration of the façade revealed much paint adhering to the statues and their niches, indicating that it had once been brightly coloured.

The particular character of this Early English interior is dependent on the proportions of the simple lancet arches. It is also dependent on the refinement of the architectural details, in particular the mouldings.

The arcade, which takes the same form in the nave, choir and transepts, is distinguished by the richness of both mouldings and carvings. Each pier of the arcade has a surface enrichment of 24 slender shafts in eight groups of three, rising beyond the <a href="Capital%20%28architecture%29">capitals</a> to form the deeply undulating mouldings of the arches. The capitals themselves are remarkable for the vitality of the stylised foliage, in a style known as "stiff-leaf". The liveliness contrasts with the formality of the moulded shafts and the smooth unbroken areas of <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a> masonry in the spandrels. Each capital is different, and some contain small figures illustrating narratives.

The vault of the nave rises steeply in a simple quadripartite form, in harmony with the nave arcade. The eastern end of the choir was extended and the whole upper part elaborated in the second quarter of the 14th century by William Joy. The vault has a multiplicity of ribs in a net-like form, which is very different from that of the nave, and is perhaps a recreation in stone of a local type of compartmented wooden roof of which examples remain from the 15th century, including those at <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Cuthbert%2C%20Wells">St Cuthbert's Church</a>, Wells. The vaults of the aisles of the choir also have a unique pattern.

Until the early 14th century, the interior of the cathedral was in a unified style, but it was to undergo two significant changes, to the tower and to the eastern end. Between 1315 and 1322 the central tower was heightened and topped by a spire, which caused the piers that supported it to show signs of stress. In 1338 the mason William Joy employed an unorthodox solution by inserting low arches topped by inverted arches of similar dimensions, forming scissors-like structures. These arches brace the piers of the crossing on three sides, while the easternmost side is braced by a choir screen. The bracing arches are known as "St Andrew's Cross arches", in a reference to the patron saint of the cathedral. They have been described by Wim Swaan – rightly or wrongly – as "brutally massive" and intrusive in an otherwise restrained interior.

Wells Cathedral has a square east end to the choir and presbytery as is usual, and like several other cathedrals including Salisbury and Exeter Cathedrals has a lower Lady Chapel projecting at the eastern end, begun by Thomas Witney in about 1310, possibly before the chapter house was completed. The date is a matter of dispute.

The Lady Chapel has a vault of complex and somewhat irregular pattern, as the chapel is not symmetrical about both axes. The main ribs are intersected by additional non-supporting ribs known as "lierne ribs" and which in this case form a star-shaped pattern at the apex of the vault. It is one of the earliest lierne vaults in England. There are five large windows, which are filled with fragments of medieval glass. In the east window the figures are all of the nineteenth century. The tracery of the windows is in the style known as Reticulated, having a pattern of a single repeated shape, in this case a trefoil, giving a "reticulate" or net-like appearance. The openings are also described as fish scales.

The retrochoir extends across the east end of the choir and into the east transepts. At its centre the vault is supported by a remarkable structure of angled piers. Two of these are so placed as to complete the octagonal shape of the Lady Chapel, a solution described by Francis Bond as "an intuition of Genius". The piers have attached shafts of marble, and, with the vaults that they support, create a vista of great complexity from every angle. The windows of the retrochoir are in the Reticulated style like those of the Lady Chapel, but are fully Flowing Decorated in that the tracery mouldings form <a href="Ogive%20%28architecture%29">ogival</a> curves. The plan of this area between the presbytery and the Lady Chapel is unique, and it has been suggested that the failure to procure the canonization of William of March led to a shortening of the presbytery as space was no longer needed for his shrine. There was then a consequent need to fill in the resulting extra space behind the High Altar. It was done ingeniously and beautifully. A similar situation had arisen at St Albans Abbey, where the old apse had been removed leaving space between the Lady Chapel and the shrine of St Alban. The space there, however, was not treated as imaginatively as it was at Wells.

The <a href="chapter%20house">chapter house</a> was begun in the late 13th century and built in two stages, completed about 1310. It is a two-storeyed structure with the main chamber raised on an <a href="undercroft">undercroft</a>. It is entered from a staircase which divides and turns, one branch leading through the upper storey of <a href="Chain%20Gate%2C%20Wells">Chain Gate</a> to Vicars' Close. The <a href="Geometric%20Decorated">Decorated</a> interior is described by Alec Clifton-Taylor as "architecturally the most beautiful in England". It is octagonal, with its ribbed vault supported on a central column. The column is surrounded by shafts of <a href="Purbeck%20Marble">Purbeck Marble</a>, rising to a single continuous rippling foliate capital of stylised oak leaves and acorns, quite different in character from the Early English stiff-leaf foliage. Above the moulding spring thirty-two ribs of strong profile, giving an effect generally likened to "a great palm tree". The windows are large with Geometric Decorated tracery that is beginning to show an elongation of form, and <a href="ogee">ogee</a>s in the lesser lights that are characteristic of Flowing Decorated tracery. The tracery lights still contain ancient glass. Beneath the windows are 51 stalls, the canopies of which are enlivened by carvings including many heads carved in a light-hearted manner.

Wells Cathedral contains one of the most substantial collections of medieval <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> in England, despite damage by Parliamentary troops in 1642 and 1643. The oldest surviving glass dates from the late 13th century and is in two windows on the west side of the chapter-house staircase. Two windows in the south choir aisle are from 1310–20.

The Lady Chapel has five windows, of which four date from 1325–30 and include images of a local saint, Dunstan. The east window was restored to a semblance of its original appearance by <a href="Thomas%20Willement">Thomas Willement</a> in 1845. The other windows have complete canopies, but the pictorial sections are fragmented.

The east window of the choir is a broad, seven-light window dating from 1340–45. It depicts the "<a href="Tree%20of%20Jesse">Tree of Jesse</a>" (the genealogy of Christ) and demonstrates the use of <a href="Silver%20nitrate">silver staining</a>, a new technique that allowed the artist to paint details on the glass in yellow, as well as black. The combination of yellow and green glass and the application of the bright yellow stain gives the window its popular name, the "Golden Window". It is flanked by two windows each side in the clerestory, with large figures of saints, also dated to 1340–45. In 2010 a major conservation programme was undertaken on the Jesse Tree window.

The panels in the chapel of <a href="Catherine%20of%20Alexandria">St Katherine</a> are attributed to <a href="Arnold%20of%20Nijmegen">Arnold of Nijmegen</a> and date from about 1520. They were acquired from the destroyed church of Saint-Jean, <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>, with the last panel having been purchased in 1953.

The large triple lancet to the nave west end was glazed at the expense of Dean Creighton at a cost of £140 in 1664. It was repaired in 1813, and the central light was largely replaced to a design by <a href="Archibald%20Keightley%20Nicholson">Archibald Keightley Nicholson</a> between 1925 and 1931. The main north and south transept end windows by <a href="James%20Powell%20and%20Sons">James Powell and Sons</a> were erected in the early 20th century.

The greater part of the stone carving of Wells Cathedral comprises foliate capitals in the stiff-leaf style. They are found ornamenting the piers of the nave, choir and transepts. Stiff-leaf foliage is highly abstract. Though possibly influenced by carvings of <a href="Acanthus%20%28ornament%29">acanthus</a> leaves or <a href="grape">vine</a> leaves, it cannot be easily identified with any particular plant. Here the carving of the foliage is varied and vigorous, the springing leaves and deep undercuts casting shadows that contrast with the surface of the piers. In the transepts and towards the crossing in the nave the capitals have many small figurative carvings among the leaves. These include a man with toothache and a series of four scenes depicting the 
"<a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Romans">Wages of Sin</a>" in a narrative of fruit stealers who creep into an orchard and are subsequently beaten by the farmer. Another well-known carving is in the north transept aisle: a foliate <a href="corbel">corbel</a>, on which climbs a lizard, sometimes identified as a <a href="salamander">salamander</a>, a symbol of <a href="Eternal%20life%20%28Christianity%29">eternal life</a>.

Carvings in the Decorated Gothic style may be found in the eastern end of the buildings, where there are many carved bosses. In the chapter house, the carvings of the fifty-one stalls include numerous small heads of great variety, many of them smiling or laughing. A well-known figure is the corbel of the dragon-slaying monk in the chapter house stair. The large continuous capital that encircles the central pillar of the chapter house is markedly different in style to the stiff-leaf of the Early English period. In contrast to the bold projections and undercutting of the earlier work, it has a rippling form and is clearly identifiable as grapevine.

The 15th-century cloisters have many small bosses ornamenting the vault. Two of these carvings in the west cloister, near the location of the gift shop and café, have been described as <a href="sheela%20na%20gig">sheela na gig</a>s, i. e. female figures displaying their genitals and variously considered to be associated with depictions of the sin of <a href="lust">lust</a> or with ancient fertility cults.
Wells Cathedral has one of the finest sets of <a href="misericord">misericord</a>s in Britain. Its clergy has a long tradition of singing or reciting from the <a href="Book%20of%20Psalms">Book of Psalms</a> each day, along with the customary daily reading of the <a href="Liturgy%20of%20the%20Hours">Holy Office</a>. In medieval times the clergy assembled in the church eight times daily for the <a href="canonical%20hours">canonical hours</a>. As the greater part of the services was recited while standing, many monastic or collegiate churches were fitted with stalls in which the seats tipped up to provide a convenient ledge for the monk or cleric to lean against. They were called "misericords" because their installation was an act of mercy. Misericords typically have a carved figurative bracket beneath the ledge framed by two floral motifs known, in the <a href="Heraldry">heraldic</a> manner, as "supporters".

The misericords date from 1330 to 1340. They may have been carved under the direction of master carpenter John Strode, although his name is not recorded before 1341. He was assisted by Bartholomew Quarter, who is documented from 1343. They originally numbered ninety, of which sixty-five have survived. Sixty-one are installed in the choir, three are displayed in the cathedral and one is held by the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>. New stalls were ordered when the eastern end of the choir was extended in the early 14th century. The canons complained that they had borne the cost of the rebuilding and ordered that the prebendary clerics should pay for their own stalls. When the newly refurbished choir opened in 1339 many misericords were left unfinished, including one-fifth of the surviving 65. Many of the clerics had not paid, and were required to contribute a total sum of £200. The misericords survived better than the other sections of the stalls, which, during the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, had their canopies chopped off and galleries inserted above them. One of the misericords, depicting a boy pulling a thorn from his foot, dates from the 17th century. In 1848 there was a complete rearrangement of the choir furniture, and 61 of the misericords were reused in the restructured stalls.

The subject matter of the carvings of the central brackets as misericords is very varied, but with many common themes recurring in different churches. Typically, the themes are less unified and less directly related to the Bible and Christian theology than are the themes of small sculptures seen elsewhere within churches, such as those on bosses. This is much the case at Wells, where none of the misericord carvings is directly based on a Bible story. The subjects, chosen either by the woodcarver, or perhaps by the individual paying for the stall, have no over-riding theme. The sole unifying element is the <a href="roundel">roundel</a>s on each side of the pictorial subject, which are all elaborately carved foliage, in most cases formal and stylised in the later Decorated manner, but with several examples of naturalistic foliage, including roses and <a href="Convolvulus">bindweed</a>. Many of the subjects carry traditional interpretations. The image of the "<a href="Pelican%20in%20her%20Piety">Pelican in her Piety</a>" (believed to feed her young on her own blood) is a recognised symbol for Christ's love for the Church. A cat playing with a mouse may represent the <a href="Devil">Devil</a> snaring a human soul. Other subjects illustrate popular fables or sayings such as "When the fox preaches, look to your geese". Many of the subjects are depictions of animals, some of which may symbolise a human vice or virtue, or an aspect of faith.

Twenty-seven of the carvings depict animals: rabbits, dogs, a puppy biting a cat, a ewe feeding a lamb, monkeys, lions, bats, and the Early Christian motif of two doves drinking from a <a href="ewer">ewer</a>. Eighteen of the misericords have mythological subjects, including mermaids, dragons and <a href="wyvern">wyvern</a>s. Five of the carvings are clearly narrative, such as the Fox and the Geese, and the story of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> being raised to Heaven by <a href="griffin">griffin</a>s. There are three heads: a bishop in a mitre, an angel and a woman wearing a veil over her hair arranged in coils over each ear. Eleven carvings are of human figures, among which are several of remarkable design, having been conceived by the artist specifically for their purpose of supporting a shelf. One figure lies beneath the seat, supporting the shelf with his cheek, one hand and one foot. Another sits in a contorted manner supporting the weight on his elbow, while another figure squats with his knees wide apart and a strained look on his face.

Some of the cathedral's fittings and monuments are hundreds of years old. The <a href="brass">brass</a> lectern in the Lady Chapel dates from 1661 and has a moulded stand and foliate crest. In the north transept chapel is a 17th-century oak screen with columns, formerly used in cow stalls, with artisan <a href="Ionic%20order">Ionic</a> capitals and cornice, set forward over the chest tomb of <a href="John%20Godelee">John Godelee</a>. There is a bound oak chest from the 14th century, which was used to store the chapter seal and key documents. The bishop's throne dates from 1340, and has a panelled, canted front and stone doorway, and a deep nodding cusped ogee canopy above it, with three-stepped <a href="Niche%20%28architecture%29">statue niches</a> and pinnacles. The throne was restored by Anthony Salvin around 1850. Opposite the throne is a 19th-century octagonal pulpit on a coved base with panelled sides, and steps up from the north aisle. The round font in the south transept is from the former <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20England">Saxon</a> cathedral and has an arcade of round-headed arches, on a round <a href="plinth">plinth</a>. The font cover was made in 1635 and is decorated with the heads of <a href="Putto">putti</a>. The Chapel of <a href="Martin%20of%20Tours">St Martin</a> is a memorial to every Somerset man who fell in World War I.

The monuments and tombs include: <a href="Gisa%20%28bishop%20of%20Wells%29">Gisa</a>, bishop, died 1088; <a href="William%20of%20Bitton">William of Bitton</a>, bishop, died 1274; <a href="William%20of%20March">William of March</a>, bishop, died 1302; John Droxford, died 1329; John Godelee, died 1333; John Middleton, died c. 1350; Ralph of Shrewsbury, died 1363; John Harewell, bishop, died 1386; William Bykonyll, died c. 1448; John Bernard, died 1459; <a href="Thomas%20Beckington">Thomas Beckington</a>, bishop, died 1464; <a href="John%20Gunthorpe">John Gunthorpe</a>, died 1498; <a href="John%20Still">John Still</a>, died 1607; <a href="Robert%20Creighton">Robert Creighton</a>, died 1672; Richard Kidder, bishop, died 1703; <a href="George%20Hooper">George Hooper</a>, bishop, died 1727 and <a href="Lord%20Arthur%20Hervey">Arthur Harvey</a>, bishop, died 1894.

In the north transept is <a href="Wells%20Cathedral%20clock">Wells Cathedral clock</a>, an <a href="astronomical%20clock">astronomical clock</a> from about 1325, believed to be the work of Peter Lightfoot, a monk of Glastonbury. Its mechanism, dated to between 1386 and 1392, was replaced in the 19th century, and the original mechanism moved to the <a href="Science%20Museum%2C%20London">Science Museum</a> in London, where it continues to operate. It is the second-oldest surviving clock in England, after the <a href="Salisbury%20cathedral%20clock">Salisbury cathedral clock</a>.

The clock has its original medieval face. As well as showing the time on a 24-hour dial, it reflects the motion of the Sun and Moon, the <a href="Lunar%20phase">phases of the Moon</a>, and the time since the last new Moon. The astronomical dial represents a <a href="Geocentric%20model">geocentric</a> or pre-<a href="Copernican%20Revolution">Copernican</a> view of the universe, with the Sun and Moon revolving round a central fixed Earth, like that of the clock at <a href="Ottery%20St%20Mary">Ottery St Mary</a>. The quarters are chimed by a <a href="Jacquemart%20%28bellstriker%29">quarter jack</a> in the form of a small <a href="automaton">automaton</a> known as Jack Blandifers, who hits two bells with hammers and two with his heels. At the striking of the clock, <a href="jousting">jousting</a> knights appear above the clock face.

On the outer wall of the transept, opposite Vicars' Hall, is a second clock face of the same clock, placed there just over seventy years after the interior clock and driven by the same mechanism. The second clock face has two quarter jacks (which strike on the quarter-hour) in the form of knights in armour.

In 2010 the official clock-winder retired and was replaced by an electric mechanism.

The first record of an organ at this church dates from 1310. A smaller organ, probably for the Lady Chapel, was installed in 1415. In 1620 an organ, built by <a href="Thomas%20Dallam">Thomas Dallam</a>, was installed at a cost of £398 1s 5d. (equivalent to about £73,000 ).

The organ that was installed in 1620 was destroyed by <a href="Roundhead">parliamentary soldiers</a> in 1643. An organ built in 1662 was enlarged in 1786 and again in 1855. In 1909–10 an organ was built by <a href="Harrison%20%26amp%3B%20Harrison">Harrison & Harrison</a> of Durham, with the best parts of the old organ retained. It has been serviced by the same company ever since.

The cathedral also has a <a href="chamber%20organ">chamber organ</a>, built by the Scottish organ-builders Lammermuir, which is normally kept in the <a href="Choir%20%28architecture%29">choir</a> but which can be moved around, for services and concerts, in other parts of the Cathedral. It is regularly used for authentic accompaniment of <a href="Renaissance%20music">Tudor</a> and <a href="baroque%20music">baroque music</a>.

The first recorded <a href="List%20of%20organists%20and%20assistant%20organists%20of%20Wells%20Cathedral">organist of Wells Cathedral</a> was Walter Bagele (or Vageler) in 1416, and the post of organist or assistant organist has been held by more than 60 individuals since then. <a href="Peter%20Lyons%20%28musician%29">Peter Stanley Lyons</a> was Master of the Choristers at Wells Cathedral, and Director of Music at <a href="Wells%20Cathedral%20School">Wells Cathedral School</a>, from 1954 to 1960. The choral conductor <a href="James%20William%20Webb-Jones">James William Webb-Jones</a>, the father of Lyons's wife, Bridget, whom Lyons married in the Cathedral, was Headmaster of Wells Cathedral School from 1955 to 1960. <a href="Malcolm%20Archer">Malcolm Archer</a> was the appointed <a href="Organist%20and%20Master%20of%20the%20Choristers">Organist and Master of the Choristers</a> from 1996 to 2004. Since 2005, the organist has been Matthew Owens. Jeremy Cole was appointed assistant organist in 2017, and the current organ scholar is Harrison Cole.

There has been a choir of boy choristers at Wells since 909. Currently there are 18 boy choristers and a similar number of girl choristers, aged from eight to fourteen. The Vicars Choral was formed in the 12th century and the sung liturgy was provided by a traditional cathedral choir of men and boys until the formation of an additional choir of girls in 1994. The boys and girls sing alternately with the Vicars Choral and are educated at Wells Cathedral School.

The Vicars Choral currently number twelve men, of whom three are choral scholars. Since 1348 the College of Vicars had its own accommodation in a quadrangle converted in the early 15th century to form Vicar's Close. The Vicars Choral generally perform with the choristers, except on Wednesdays, when they sing alone, allowing them to present a different repertoire, in particular <a href="plainsong">plainsong</a>.

In December 2010 Wells Cathedral Choir was rated by "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">Gramophone</a>" magazine as "the highest ranking choir with children in the world". It continues to provide music for the liturgy at Sunday and weekday services. The choir has made many recordings and toured frequently, including performances in Beijing and Hong Kong in 2012. Its repertoire ranges from the choral music of the <a href="Renaissance%20music">Renaissance</a> to recently commissioned works.

The Wells Cathedral Voluntary Choir is a mixed adult choir of 30 members, formed in 1986 to sing at the midnight service on Christmas Eve, and invited to sing at several other special services. The choir now sings for about 50 services a year, when the Cathedral Choir is in recess or on tour, and spends one week a year singing as the "choir in residence" at another cathedral. Although primarily liturgical, the choir's repertoire includes other forms of music, as well as performances at engagements such as weddings and funerals.

The cathedral is home to Wells Cathedral Oratorio Society (WCOS), founded in 1896. With around 160 voices the society gives three concerts a year under the direction of Matthew Owens, Organist and Master of the Choristers at the Cathedral. Concerts are normally in early November, December (an annual performance of <a href="Messiah%20%28Handel%29">Handel's "Messiah"</a>) and late March. It performs with a number of specialist orchestras including: Music for Awhile, Chameleon Arts and La Folia.

The bells at Wells Cathedral are the heaviest ring of ten bells in the world, the tenor bell (the 10th and largest), known as Harewell, weighing . They are hung for full-circle ringing in the English style of <a href="change%20ringing">change ringing</a>. These bells are now hung in the south-west tower, although some were originally hung in the central tower.

The library is above the eastern cloister and was built between 1430 and 1508. Its collection is in three parts: early documents, housed in the <a href="Muniment">Muniment</a> Room; the collection predating 1800, housed in the Chained Library; and the post-1800 collection, housed in the Reading Room. The chapter's earlier collection was destroyed during the Reformation, so that the present library consists chiefly of early printed books, rather than medieval manuscripts. The earlier books, in the Chained Library, number 2,800 volumes and give an indication of the variety of interests of the members of the cathedral chapter from the Reformation until 1800. The focus of the collection is predominantly theology but there are volumes on science, medicine, exploration, and languages. Books of particular interest include <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny</a>'s "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Natural History</a>" printed in 1472, an "<a href="Theatrum%20Orbis%20Terrarum">Atlas of the World</a>" by <a href="Abraham%20Ortelius">Abraham Ortelius</a>, printed in 1606 and a set of the works of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> that once belonged to <a href="Erasmus">Erasmus</a>. The library is open to the public at appointed times during summer and presents a small exhibition of documents and books.

Three early registers of the dean and chapter of Wells – the "Liber Albus I" (White Book; R I), "Liber Albus II" (R III) and "Liber Ruber" (Red Book; R II, section i) – were edited by W. H. B. Bird for the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20on%20Historical%20Manuscripts">Historical Manuscripts Commissioners</a> and published in 1907. The books comprise, with some repetition, a <a href="cartulary">cartulary</a> of possessions of the cathedral, with grants of land dating back as early as the 8th century, well before the development of hereditary surnames in England; they also comprise acts of the Dean and Chapter, and surveys of their estates, mostly in Somerset.

The cathedral is situated adjacent to a large lawned area, Cathedral Green, which is approached by three ancient gateways, <a href="Brown%27s%20Gatehouse%2C%20Wells">Brown's Gatehouse</a>, <a href="Penniless%20Porch%2C%20Wells">Penniless Porch</a> and Chain Gate. On the green is the 12th-century <a href="The%20Old%20Deanery%2C%20Wells">Old Deanery</a>, largely rebuilt in the late 15th century by Dean Gunthorpe and remodelled by Dean Bathurst in the late 17th century. No longer the dean's residence, it is used as offices for the diocese.

To the south of the cathedral is the moated Bishop's Palace, begun around 1210 by Jocelin of Wells but dating mostly from the 1230s. In the 15th century Thomas Beckington added the north wing, which is now the bishop's residence. It was restored and extended by Benjamin Ferrey between 1846 and 1854.

To the north of the cathedral and connected to it by the Chain Gate is Vicars' Close, a street planned in the 14th century and claimed to be the oldest purely residential street in Europe, with all but one of its original buildings surviving intact. Buildings in the close include the Vicars Hall and gateway at the south end, and the Vicars Chapel and Library at the north end.

The <a href="Wells%20St%20Andrew">Liberty of St Andrew</a> was the historic <a href="Liberty%20%28division%29">liberty</a> and parish that encompassed the cathedral and the surrounding lands closely associated with it.

The English painter <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a> visited Wells in 1795, making sketches of the precinct and a water colour of the west front, now in the <a href="Tate%20Britain">Tate</a> gallery. Other artists whose paintings of the cathedral are in national collections are <a href="Albert%20Goodwin%20%28artist%29">Albert Goodwin</a>, <a href="John%20Syer">John Syer</a> and <a href="Ken%20Howard%20%28artist%29">Ken Howard</a>.

The cathedral was used as an inspiration for <a href="Ken%20Follett">Ken Follett</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Pillars%20of%20the%20Earth">The Pillars of the Earth</a>" and, with a heavily modified central tower, featured as the completed fictional Kingsbridge Cathedral at the end of the 2010 television adaptation of that novel. The interior of the cathedral was used for the "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>" episode, '<a href="The%20Lazarus%20Experiment">The Lazarus Experiment</a>', while the exterior shots were filmed at <a href="Southwark%20Cathedral">Southwark Cathedral</a>.

Qatna

Qatna (modern: , Tell al-Mishrifeh) is an ancient city located in <a href="Homs%20Governorate">Homs Governorate</a>, <a href="Syria">Syria</a>. Its remains constitute a <a href="Tell%20%28archaeology%29">tell</a> situated about northeast of <a href="Homs">Homs</a> near the village of <a href="Al-Mushrifah">al-Mishrifeh</a>. The city was an important center throughout most of the second millennium BC and in the first half of the first millennium BC. It contained one of the largest royal palaces of <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> Syria and an intact royal tomb that has provided a great amount of <a href="archaeological%20evidence">archaeological evidence</a> on the funerary habits of that period.

First inhabited for a short period in the second half of the fourth millennium BC, it was repopulated around 2800 BC and continued to grow. By 2000 BC, it became the capital of a regional kingdom that spread its authority over large swathes of the central and southern <a href="Levant">Levant</a>. The kingdom enjoyed good relations with <a href="Mari%2C%20Syria">Mari</a>, but was engaged in constant warfare against <a href="Yamhad">Yamhad</a>. By the 15th century BC, Qatna lost its hegemony and came under the authority of <a href="Mitanni">Mitanni</a>. It later changed hands between the former and <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egypt</a>, until it was conquered and sacked by the <a href="Hittites">Hittites</a> in the late 14th century BC. Following its destruction, the city was reduced in size before being abandoned by the 13th century BC. It was resettled in the 10th century BC, becoming a center of the kingdoms of <a href="Palistin">Palistin</a> then <a href="Hama">Hama</a>th until it was destroyed by the <a href="Sargon%20II">Assyrians</a> in 720 BC, which reduced it to a small village that eventually disappeared in the 6th century BC. In the 19th century AD, the site was populated by villagers who were evacuated into the newly built village of al-Mishrifeh in 1982. The site has been excavated since the 1920s.

Qatna was inhabited by different peoples, most importantly the <a href="Amorites">Amorites</a>, who established the kingdom, followed by the <a href="Arameans">Arameans</a>; <a href="Hurrians">Hurrians</a> became part of the society in the 15th century BC and influenced Qatna's written language. The city's art is distinctive and shows signs of contact with different surrounding regions. The artifacts of Qatna show high-quality workmanship. The city's religion was complex and based on many cults in which ancestor worship played an important role. Qatna's location in the middle of the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a> trade networks helped it achieve wealth and prosperity; it traded with regions as far away as the <a href="Baltic%20region">Baltic</a> and <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. The area surrounding Qatna was fertile, with abundant water, which made the lands suitable for grazing and supported a large population that contributed to the prosperity of the city.

Third millennium texts do not mention the name Qatna; the archive of <a href="Ebla">Ebla</a> mentions the toponym "Gudadanum" (or "Ga-da-nu"), which has been identified with Qatna by some scholars, such as <a href="Giovanni%20Pettinato">Giovanni Pettinato</a> and <a href="Michael%20Astour">Michael Astour</a>, but this is debated.

Aside from an obscure passage in the 20th-century BC Egyptian "<a href="Story%20of%20Sinuhe">Story of Sinuhe</a>", where the name Qatna is not clearly mentioned, the earliest occurrence of the name comes from the Middle Bronze Age archive of Mari, where the city is mentioned as "Qatanum", an <a href="Akkadian%20language">Akkadian</a>ized format (<a href="qa%20%28cuneiform%29">Qa</a>-<a href="ta%20%28cuneiform%29">ta</a>-<a href="nim%20%28cuneiform%29">nim</a>). In Alalakh, the name "Qa-ta-na" was used, an Amorite format that was shortened into Qatna during the Late Bronze Age. The name is <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic</a>; it derives from the root "q-ṭ-n", meaning "thin" or "narrow" in a number of Semitic languages such as Akkadian, <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac</a>, and <a href="Ethiopian%20Semitic%20languages">Ethiopian</a>. "Ga-da-nu" from the Eblaite archive may also derive from that root. The toponym "Qatna" is strictly related to <a href="waterway">waterway</a>s and lakes; this could be a reference to the artificial narrowing that created a lake from the springs located southwest of the city, since Qatna grew on the eastern shore of a now dried lake.

The city is located in the countryside, north of Homs. It was founded on a <a href="limestone">limestone</a> plateau, and its extensive remains suggest fertile surroundings with abundant water, which is not the case in modern times. Three northward flowing tributary <a href="wadi">wadi</a>s (Mydan, Zorat and Slik) of the <a href="Orontes%20River">Orontes River</a> cross the region of Qatna, enclosing an area north–south and east–west. The city lay along the central wadi (Zorat), surrounded by at least twenty five satellite settlements, most of them along the Mydan (marking the eastern border of the region) and Slik (marking the western border of the region) wadis. The wadis are now dry most of the year, but during the rainy season their discharge is disproportional to the size of their valleys, suggesting that the region was much more humid and water was more abundant in the past. The early city, dating to the Early Bronze Age IV (2200–2100 BC), was built in a circular plan; this circular site became the upper city (acropolis) of Qatna's later phases and was surrounded by a lower rectangular city.




The site was first occupied during the Late Chalcolithic IV period (3300–3000 BC). This early settlement was concentrated on the central part of the upper town; its function is unknown and it ended in the late fourth millennium BC. After a hiatus of several centuries, the site was reoccupied around 2800 BC during the Early Bronze Age III.

The last two centuries of the third millennium BC saw widespread disruption of urban settlements in Syria and the abandonment of many cities; however, Qatna seems to be an exception, as it continued to grow. During the Early Bronze Age IV, Qatna reached a size of ; it included a dense residential quarter and facilities for the storage and processing of grains, especially a large multi-roomed granary similar to the one in <a href="Tell%20Beydar">Tell Beydar</a>. The city may have been one of the urban centers of the <a href="Ib%27al">Ib'al</a> federation, perhaps the center of a king or prince. The early city occupied the acropolis, and none of its remains were found in the lower city. Most of the small settlements surrounding Qatna, to , appeared during this period; this might have been connected with the emergence of a central institution in the city.

The Kingdom of Qatna was established around 2000 BC. At the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age I, the city expanded and covered an area of . This growth reduced the number of the small settlements as people were drawn into the expanded metropolis. It is probable that the earliest mention of "Qatna" by this name dates to the same period. According to <a href="Thomas%20Schneider%20%28Egyptologist%29">Thomas Schneider</a>, a city named "Qedem", mentioned in a controversial passage in the "<a href="Story%20of%20Sinuhe">Story of Sinuhe</a>" dating to the beginning of the <a href="Twelfth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt</a> (early 20th century BC), is most probably to be identified with Qatna. Qedem in the Egyptian text is written "Qdm", and, in Egyptian, Qatna is written as "Qdn". If Schneider's interpretation is correct, then this is the first known written mention of the city. The text also mentions that the title of the ruler was "Mekim" (or Mekum), a royal title known from Ebla. The theory of Schneider is debated: in Sinuhe's story, the protagonist turned back to Qedem after reaching <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a>; <a href="Joachim%20Friedrich%20Quack">Joachim Friedrich Quack</a> pointed out that the Egyptian verb ""ḥs ̯i"" used in the text was known to indicate that a certain expedition had reached its final destination and was now returning to Egypt, indicating that Qedem was south of Byblos, while Qatna is to the north of Byblos.

The next mention of Qatna after the "Story of Sinuhe" comes from Mari in the 18th century BC, during the reign of <a href="Ishi-Addu">Išḫi-Addu</a> of Qatna. However, a tablet found in <a href="Tuttul">Tuttul</a>, dating to the early reign of the Mariote king <a href="Yahdun-Lim">Yahdun-Lim</a> in the late 19th century BC, mentions a king named <a href="Amut-pi%CA%BEel%20I">Amut-piʾel</a>, who is most probably the father of Išḫi-Addu; this would make him the first known king of Qatna. Also during the reign of Yahdun-Lim, the kingdom of <a href="Yamhad">Yamhad</a> in Aleppo and its king <a href="Sumu-Epuh">Sumu-Epuh</a> enter the historical record through the texts of Mari.

Early in their history, Qatna and Yamhad had hostile relations; Amut-piʾel I, in alliance with Yahdun-Lim and Ḫammu-Nabiḫ (probably king of Tuttul), attacked the Yamhadite city of <a href="Umm%20el-Marra">Tuba</a>, which was a personal possession of Aleppo's royal family, and took a large booty. Later, Yahdun-Lim embarked on an expedition to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> that was used for ideological purposes, as it was meant to echo <a href="Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a>'s deeds; the journey likely had undeclared political motives as well, when seen in the context of the alliance with Qatna. The Mariote–Qaṭanean alliance, which was probably cemented by dynastic marriage, must have provoked Yamhad, which supported rebellions in Mari to preoccupy Yahdun-Lim with his own problems. Despite the tension and battles, a full-scale war with Yamhad was avoided.

Qatna was at its apex during the reign of Išḫi-Addu. Mari was conquered by <a href="Shamshi-Adad%20I">Shamshi-Adad I</a> of Assyria, who appointed his son <a href="Yasmah-Adad">Yasmah-Adad</a> as its king. Išḫi-Addu was allied with Shamshi-Adad and is attested corresponding with Mari for a period of six years between . At its height, the kingdom extended from the upper valley of the Orontes to <a href="Kadesh%20%28Syria%29">Qadeš</a> in the west, while <a href="Palmyra">Palmyra</a> was Qatna's easternmost city. It was bordered by Yamhad in the north, while the south was dominated by <a href="Tel%20Hazor">Hazor</a>, a Qaṭanean vassal. The many kingdoms of <a href="Amurru%20kingdom">Amurru</a>, which controlled the central Levantine coast between Byblos and <a href="Ugarit">Ugarit</a>, bordered Qatna from the west and were counted among Išhi-Addu's vassals. Also under the rule of Qatna were various cities in the <a href="Beqaa%20Valley">Beqaa Valley</a> and the cities in the region of Apum, in the modern <a href="Ghouta">Damascus Oasis</a>.

The kingdom was sometimes threatened by nomads; a letter sent to Yasmah-Adad informs him that 2000 <a href="Suteans">Suteans</a> conducted a raid against Qatna. Relations with Yamhad worsened during Išḫi-Addu's reign and the conflict evolved into border warfare; Qatna occupied the city of <a href="Barga%20%28kingdom%29">Parga</a> in the region of <a href="Hama">Hama</a>th for a while before Sumu-Epuh retook it. In the south, Išḫi-Addu faced a general rebellion; the alliance with Assyria was cemented by the marriage of Išḫi-Addu's daughter to Yasmah-Adad in . The following year, after petitions by Qatna, Shamshi-Adad sent an army to help Išḫi-Addu deal with the rebellion. The Assyrian troops avoided engaging Yamhad and did not participate in its war with Qatna, while Išḫi-Addu took up residence in Qadeš to oversee the suppression of the rebellion, which apparently was supported by Yamhad. After four years in the service of Qatna, Shamshi-Adad ordered his troops to return; this might have been connected to a peace treaty between Assyria and <a href="Yarim-Lim%20I">Yarim-Lim I</a>, son of Sumu-Epuh. Išḫi-Addu, who in the past had declared that "even if Shamshi-Adad would conclude peace with Sumu-epuh, I will never make peace with Sumu-epuh, as long as I live!", was delivered a heavy blow, but Mari's sources are silent on how the king dealt with the situation, and by the time they resumed mentioning Qatna in , Išḫi-Addu was dead and succeeded by his son <a href="Amut-pi%CA%BEel%20II">Amut-piʾel II</a>.

The political and military balance in the region changed dramatically during the reign of Amut-piʾel II; Shamshi-Adad I had died by about 1775 BC, and his empire disintegrated, while Yasmah-Adad was removed from his throne and replaced with <a href="Zimri-Lim">Zimri-Lim</a>. Yarim-Lim I gained the upper hand and turned his kingdom into the supreme power in the Levant; Qatna was forced to respect the borders and interests of Yamhad. In Mari, Zimri-Lim, who was Yarim-Lim's protégé, married Amut-piʾel II's sister and Yasmah-Adad's widow Dam-Ḫuraṣi, and this seemed to satisfy the king of Qatna, as his relations with Mari were never hostile. In 1772 BC, the <a href="Mari%2C%20Syria%23People.2C%20language%20and%20government">Banu-Yamina</a> tribes revolted against Zimri-Lim, who asked Qatna for help; Amut-piʾel II sent his troops to Dūr-Yahdun-Lim (probably modern <a href="Deir%20ez-Zor">Deir ez-Zor</a>) to support Mari, but when he asked for Mariote military support at a later time, Zimri-Lim hesitated as Yarim-Lim I was expressly against such a dispatch. When Qatna tried to establish an alliance with <a href="Eshnunna">Eshnunna</a>, Mari, which was at war with Eshnunna, arrested the messengers on the pretext that Zimri-Lim feared for their safety; in reality, the king of Mari was probably acting on behalf of Yamhad to prevent Qatna from establishing such an alliance.
The archive of Mari reports a plan between Zimri-Lim, the king of <a href="Carchemish">Carchemish</a> and the king of Eshnunna (who made peace with Mari), to attack Qatna. Such an alliance could not have been realized without the participation of Yamhad, overlord of both Mari and Carchemish; in the end, the plan was not pursued and the tense relations between Qatna and Yamhad eased toward the last years of Yarim-Lim's reign. In a letter written to Zimri-Lim, Yarim-Lim I agreed to establish peace with Qatna if Amut-piʾel II were to come by himself to Aleppo, thus acknowledging the supremacy of Yamhad; no proof can be shown for a meeting taking place between the two kings. Just before his death in 1765 BC, Yarim-Lim called a meeting of his vassals, and Zimri-Lim traveled to Aleppo where he met messengers from Qatna and Hazor, indicating that Amut-piʾel II started recognizing the supremacy of Yarim-Lim, and that Hazor, Qatna's vassal, was now obeying Yamhad. Yarim-Lim's successor <a href="Hammurabi%20I">Hammurabi I</a> arranged a peace with Qatna that probably did not require the Qaṭanean king to visit Aleppo personally, but indicated Qatna's acceptance of Yamhad's superiority. This apparent yielding seems a mere formality as Qatna continued its aspirations for power, as became clear in its behavior during the Elamite invasion of Mesopotamia in year ten of Zimri-Lim's reign. An Elamite messenger reached <a href="Emar">Emar</a> and sent three of his servants to Qatna; Hammurabi I of Yamhad learned of this and sent troops to intercept them on their return. The servants were captured and questioned, revealing that Amut-piʾel II told them to tell their monarch that "The country is delivered to you, come up to me! if you come up, you will not be taken by surprise." The Qaṭanean king also sent two messengers to Elam, but they were probably captured in Babylon.

The hegemony of Yamhad affected Qatna's economy; the trade route connecting Mesopotamia and Mari to Qatna through Palmyra lost its importance, while the trade routes from the Mediterranean to Mesopotamia came under the full control of Aleppo, contributing to Qatna's loss of wealth. Following the destruction of Mari by <a href="Hammurabi">Hammurabi</a> of Babylon around 1761 BC, information about Qatna becomes scarce; in the late 17th century BC, Yamhad invaded and defeated Qatna during the reign of <a href="Yarim-Lim%20III">Yarim-Lim III</a>. The political and commercial importance of Qatna declined quickly during the Late Bronze Age (LB I), around 1600 BC, as a result of growing Egyptian and <a href="Mitanni">Mitanni</a>an influences. Numerous small states appeared in the region and detached from Qatna.

It is not known when Qatna lost its independence. It became a Mitannian vassal in the 16th century BC, but the archive of Qatna proves that even in its final period during the 14th century BC, Qatna maintained a certain degree of autonomy. Early Egyptian military intrusions to the region occurred under <a href="Thutmose%20I">Thutmose I</a> (). The name Qedem appears in an inscription found on a fragmented gateway from <a href="Karnak">Karnak</a> dated to the reign of Thutmose mentioning a military campaign in the northern Levant. The inscription suggests that the mentioned cities submitted to the king. The geographic sequence given in the inscription is Qedem ("Qdm"), <a href="Tunip">Tunip</a> ("Twnjp") and "Ḏj<a href="Transliteration%20of%20Ancient%20Egyptian%23Egyptological%20alef.2C%20ayin.2C%20and%20yod">3</a> wny" (maybe <a href="Siyannu">Siyannu</a>); Qatna (Qdn in Egyptian) would fit better in the geographic sequence and <a href="Alexander%20Ahrens">Alexander Ahrens</a> suggested that the inscription might have meant Qatna. Any oaths of loyalty to Egypt taken by Levantine rulers were forgotten after Thutmose I's death. The Egyptians returned under the leadership of <a href="Thutmose%20III">Thutmose III</a> (), who reached Qatna during his eighth Asiatic campaign, . Thutmose III did not rule directly in Qatna but established vassalage ties and attended an archery contest with the Qaṭanean king.

Towards the end of Thutmose III's reign, and under the influence of Mitanni, the Syrian states changed their loyalty, causing Thutmose's successor <a href="Amenhotep%20II">Amenhotep II</a> () to march north in his seventh year on the throne, where he fought troops from Qatna near the city. The threat of the <a href="Hittites">Hittites</a> prompted Mitanni's king to sue for peace: <a href="Artatama%20I">Artatama I</a> approached Amenhotep II for an alliance and long negotiations started. The talks lasted until after Amenhotep's death, when his successor <a href="Thutmose%20IV">Thutmose IV</a> () finally sealed a treaty that divided the Levant between the two powers. Qatna and the states north of it, such as <a href="Nuha%C5%A1%C5%A1e">Nuhašše</a>, fell into the sphere of Mitanni. Despite its reduced status, Qatna still controlled the <a href="Mount%20Lebanon">Lebanon Mountains</a> away in the 14th century BC.

During the reign of <a href="Adad-Nirari%20of%20Nuha%C5%A1%C5%A1e">Adad-Nirari</a> of <a href="Nuha%C5%A1%C5%A1e">Nuhašše</a> in the 14th century BC, Qatna may have become part of his kingdom. In 1977, Astour considered Qatna a constituent part of the lands of Nuhašše, and identified a king of Qatna named <a href="Adad-Nirari%20of%20Qatna">Adad-Nirari</a> with the Nuhaššite king. Astour was followed by <a href="Thomas%20Richter%20%28historian%29">Thomas Richter</a> in 2002, who considered Qatna to be a secondary city in the domain of the Nuhaššite king. The tablets of Qatna mention a "<a href="Shakkanakku">šakkanakku</a>" (military governor) named Lullu, and Richter considered him an official of Nuhašše. The hypothesis of Richter is debated; a number of scholars accept it, for example Pfälzner, who suggested that the Nuhaššite king may have resided in Qatna's royal palace. Richter dated the rule of the Nuhaššite king to the period preceding the Hittite king <a href="%C5%A0uppiluliuma%20I">Šuppiluliuma I</a>'s first Syrian war, during which Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše opposed the Hittites, was defeated, and, according to Richter, had his kingdom split between different Hittite puppets including <a href="Idanda">Idanda</a> of Qatna.

Gernot Wilhelm saw no ground for Richter's assumption concerning the identification of the Nuhaššite monarch with the Qaṭanean king. This identification rests on the theory that Qatna belonged geographically to the region of Nuhašše, but no solid evidence supports this assumption, and the <a href="Shattiwaza">Shattiwaza</a> treaty between the Hittites and Mitannians clearly mentioned Qatna as a different realm from Nuhašše during the first Syrian war when the Nuhaššite king ruled. If Qatna was part of the Nuhaššite kingdom, its submission to the Hittites would not have been mentioned separately in the treaty. It is a fact that Qatna was ruled by Idanda during the first war and the Hittite documents do not mention a change of rulers in Qatna made by Šuppiluliuma, leaving no reason to suspect that Idanda ascended the throne as a result of the war. <a href="Jacques%20Freu">Jacques Freu</a> likewise rejected Richter's hypothesis. Citing different arguments, he concluded that Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše was a contemporary of Idanda, the successor of the Qaṭanean Adad-Nirari.

Early in his reign, the Hittite king Šuppiluliuma I () aimed at conquering Mitanni's lands west of the Euphrates. Šuppiluliuma waged several campaigns to achieve his goal: the first Syrian foray, the second Syrian foray, the first Syrian war and the second Syrian war. The events and chronology of the Hittites' subjugation of Qatna are debated. King Idanda was a Hittite vassal; a letter sent by the Hittite general Ḫanutti contains a demand that Idanda fortify the city. Freu believed that Idanda abandoned Mitanni and joined the Hittites as a result of Šuppiluliuma's first Syrian foray. The Mitannian king <a href="Tushratta">Tushratta</a> retaliated by invading Qatna, and burning the royal palace; an event dated to around 1340 BC. Wilhelm, on the other hand, believed that Idanda submitted to the Hittites as a result of the first Syrian war.

The events leading to the destruction of the royal palace did not cause the destruction of the whole city. The Shattiwaza treaty, which describes the events of the first Syrian war, mentions that Qatna was invaded and destroyed, and its people were deported during the war. However, Idanda's successor, <a href="Akizzi">Akizzi</a>, was ruling in the second half of the Egyptian pharaoh <a href="Akhenaten">Akhenaten</a>'s reign following the first Syrian war, or shortly before the second Syrian war. This discrepancy can be explained if the treaty did not mention the events in a chronological order; many scholars, such as Wilhelm, believe that the author of the document organized the text according to the principle of association, rather than following the sequence of events.

Akizzi contacted Egypt and declared himself a servant to the pharaoh. An anti-Hittite coalition, probably organized by Akizzi, was established. Šuppiluliuma tried diplomatic means to solve the conflict but Akizzi rejected them. Hittite military intervention soon followed and Akizzi asked Egypt for troops, but received none. Šuppiluliuma himself came to Qatna, aided by <a href="Aziru">Aziru</a> of <a href="Amurru%20kingdom">Amurru</a>. The Hittite monarch took with him a statue of the sun deity, which had been given to Qatna by an ancestor of Akhenaten. This move symbolized the final capitulation of the kingdom.

Akizzi survived the destruction of his city and continued his communication with the pharaoh for some time; in an <a href="Amarna%20letters">Amarna letter</a> (EA 55), the king of Qatna described to Akhenaten the actions of Šuppiluliuma and his plundering of Qatna. Hence, the final sack of Qatna occurred after the royal palace was destroyed in 1340 BC, and before the death of Akhenaten, to whom the letter was addressed, in . <a href="Trevor%20R.%20Bryce">Trevor Bryce</a> suggested that Akizzi might have accepted Hittite overlordship again. In any case, he was the last known king. The city lost its importance following its sacking and never regained its former status.

The destruction of the royal palace constituted a break in Qatna's history; all other palaces were abandoned and the political system collapsed. A pottery workshop was built in the place of the southern palace, while the lower city palace was replaced by two adjacent courtyards surrounded by walls. Archaeological data suggest a much reduced settlement with no regional role. Following the 13th century BC, no archaeological evidence exists to prove the city was occupied; the toponym Qatna stopped appearing and the next occupation level dates to the late 10th century BC, suggesting it was uninhabited for three centuries.

In the late 10th century and early 9th century BC, the site was reoccupied but its name during that time is unknown; three human head sculptures made of basalt were discovered in the site; they probably date to the mid-9th century BC. At this time, the region was probably under the control of <a href="Palistin">Palistin</a>, with Qatna under the rule of Hamath, which was probably part of Palistin. The basalt heads bear similarities to a statue discovered in Palistin's capital, but there is not enough information to allow a general conclusion over the borders of Palistin and its extent into Qatna. The settlement was a small one; it included large buildings that were used both as residences and manufacturing facilities.

By the 8th century, the site saw a revival in settlement; the city expanded and many houses, public buildings, and storage areas were built. The newly expanded settlement was a contrast to the earlier 10th/9th century one; the existence of official buildings and the emergence of many satellite settlements surrounding Qatna suggest that the city was a local center in the kingdom of Hamath. The official buildings were violently destroyed, probably at the hands of the Assyrian king <a href="Sargon%20II">Sargon II</a> (), who annexed the region in 720 BC. The site continued to be inhabited during the Iron Age III, following the Assyrian destruction, but the settlement shrank considerably, being reduced to a village comprising the central part of the acropolis. It was abandoned in the mid-6th century BC.

In the mid-19th century, a modern village (<a href="Al-Mushrifah">al-Mishrifeh</a>) was built within the ancient site. Houses were built on top of the royal palace floors, damaging them to a certain degree, but also protecting the underlying ruins. In 1982, the Syrian <a href="Directorate-General%20of%20Antiquities%20and%20Museums">Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums</a> resettled the inhabitants in a new village next to the ancient tell, thus making the site available for modern archaeological research.

The kingdom of Qatna had a predominantly Semitic <a href="Amorites">Amorite</a> population; all the personal names from Qatna in the Mari archive were Amorite. The royal family was also Amorite and it stayed as such during the Mitannian era, which witnessed the expansion of <a href="Hurrians">Hurrians</a>; by the fifteenth century BC, Qatna had a sizable Hurrian element. The <a href="Arameans">Arameans</a> were responsible for the re-occupation of the site in the first millennium BC.

The Amorites in Qatna spoke their <a href="Amorite%20language">own language</a>, but kings communicated with their counterparts using <a href="Akkadian%20language">Akkadian</a>, which was the language of writing in the city. Qatna's Akkadian became heavily influenced by <a href="Hurrian%20language">Hurrian</a> in the 15th and 14th centuries BC; Richter argued that a special Akkadian–Hurrian hybrid dialect developed in Qatna. Texts from Qatna exhibit many Hurrian elements, proving that Hurrian was prominent among <a href="scribe">scribe</a>s, but its predominance as a spoken language by the general public cannot be determined.

Details about the religious life in Qatna are not available due to the rarity of written evidence from the city; in general, many cults seems to have existed and mixed in Qatna, most prominently the royal <a href="ancestor%20cult">ancestor cult</a>, the cult of gods and the cult of the dead.

Belet-Ekallim (Ninegal) was a prominent deity in Qatna; the inventories of gifts presented to the gods found in hall C of the palace show that she was a prominent element in the royal liturgy, where she was called the "lady of the palace" and "Belet Qatna", making her effectively the goddess of the city. However, no trace of a temple or shrine has been found in the building. The inventories also mention the "gods of the king"; it is debated whether this referred to deities or to royal ancestors. <a href="Jean%20Bott%C3%A9ro">Jean Bottéro</a> identified the "gods of the king" with the sun god <a href="Shamash">Šamaš</a>, whom Akizzi called the "god of my father" in his letter to Akhenaten. <a href="Gregorio%20del%20Olmo%20Lete">Gregorio del Olmo Lete</a> considered Šamaš the god of Qatna's dynasty, but the "gods of the king" probably included other deities as well. <a href="Jean-Marie%20Durand">Jean-Marie Durand</a> considers <a href="Hadad">Addu</a> to be the god of the city based on a seal dating to Išḫi-Addu's reign describing Addu as such. Another indication of the deities worshiped in Qatna comes from the archive of Mari; the daughter of Išḫi-Add was devoted to the goddess <a href="Ishtar">Ishtar</a> and Zimri-Lim once invited Amut-piʾel II to Mari to take part in rituals for that goddess, indicating that the cult of Ishtar was prominent in Qatna.

The texts of Mari show that the cult of stones, especially the "sikkanum" (i.e., <a href="Baetylus">Betyles</a>—sacred stones), was widespread in western Syria, and its practice in Qatna is plausible. Du Mesnil du Buisson named room F in the royal palace "Haut-Lieu" and considered it a shrine of <a href="Asherah">Ašera</a>. Research done after 1999 ruled out du Mesnil du Buisson's hypothesis and concluded that the room is a bathroom, but further research showed that the bathroom interpretation must also be wrong. Pfälzner, based on its architecture being suitable for containing sacred stones, suggested that room F was the palace shrine for the cult of Betyles. Pfälzner concludes that "an ultimate proof, however, for the function of Room F at Qaṭna cannot be deduced from this parallel. Nor is there a clue as to the dedication of the possible Betyle-sanctuary at Qaṭna".

Ancestors were worshiped in Qatna; the royal <a href="hypogeum">hypogeum</a> provided a large amount of data concerning the cult of ancestor worshiping and the practices associated with it. Two kinds of burials are distinguished; a primary burial intended to transport the dead into the netherworld, and a secondary burial that was intended to transform the deceased into their ultimate form: an ancestor. The royal hypogeum provides hints at the different rituals taking place during a secondary burial; a noticeable character is that skeletons were not complete, and no skulls are found for the majority of secondary burial remains. There is no evidence that skulls decayed as they would have left behind teeth, of which very few were found, indicating that the skulls were removed to be venerated in another location.

Bones in the secondary burial were arranged without respect for anatomical order; it is plausible to assume that the distribution process was the result of symbolic rituals that indicated the changing of the deceased's role by incorporating him or her into the group of royal ancestors. Pottery vessels were deposited next to the secondary burial remains; they were fixed on top of food offerings meant as a food supply for the dead, giving evidence for the performance of <a href="Funerary%20cult%23Mesopotamia">Kispu</a> (nourishing and caring for one's ancestor through a regular supply of food and drink). Hundreds of pilled vessels provide evidence that the living participated and dined with their ancestors, venerating them. Pfälzner argues for a third burial process which he calls the tertiary burial; the eastern chamber of the hypogeum was used as an ossuary where human remains and animal bones left from the Kispu were mixed and pilled. Pfälzner conclude that bones left in that chamber were deposited there because they had become useless in funerary rituals, thus the chamber was their final resting place. Bones in the eastern chamber were stored with no respect for the unity of an individual, indicating that the persons buried were now part of the collective group of ancestors; this did not mean that the individuals were no longer cared for, as the many bowls in the chamber indicate the continuation of food offerings to those ancestors.

According to Pfälzner, a final burial stage can be noticed, which he calls the quaternary burial. Tomb VII, which most probably contained remains taken out of the royal hypogeum, seems to have worked as a storage for the remains of individuals whose Kispu cycle came to an end; very few bowls were found in that tomb. The Kispu was important for demonstrating the legitimacy of the king, thus it needed to be public and visible to a large crowd; Pfälzner suggests that hall A in the royal palace was the place for the public Kispu and that the antechamber of the royal hypogeum was dedicated for private Kispu that included only the king and the spirits of his ancestors.

Due to its location in the middle of the trade network of the ancient world, the cultural and social landscape of the city was complex, as the inhabitants had to deal with traders and envoys who brought with them different customs from distant regions. The inventories of gifts presented to deities from the royal palace indicate that Qatna used the <a href="sexagesimal">sexagesimal</a> numeral system.

Textiles dyed with <a href="Tyrian%20purple">royal purple</a>, a symbol of social status, were found in the royal hypogeum. Judging by the royal statues found in the royal hypogeum antechamber, a king of Qatna wore clothes different from those worn in Mesopotamia; his robes would have reached his ankles and the hem on his shawl would have been in the shape of a thick rope, while his beard was short and his headdress consisted of a broad band. For royal primary burials, several steps were followed: constructing the burial container, anointing the body with oil, heating the body, leading the burial procession, laying the sarcophagus floor with textiles, burying the body with another layer of textiles, and finally depositing a layer of plants and herbs. <a href="Syrian%20elephant">Elephants</a>, which lived in western Syria, were esteemed in Qatna and connected to the royal family; they were apparently hunted by the royals and the king himself, as there is evidence that their bones were displayed in the palace; thus, elephants were part of the royal ideology and hunting an elephant was a symbol of prestige that glorified the strength of the king.

An international style in art did not exist in Qatna; instead, a regional hybrid style prevailed where international motifs appear along with regional ones, yet all the pieces reveal enough features to trace them to Qatna. The <a href="volute">volute</a>-shaped plant is one of the most widespread international motifs; many pieces from the royal hypogeum were decorated with the motif, but Qatna had its own typical volute, where the crown is a single long lobe with dotted pendants branching out of the corners of the upper volute. The wall painting in Qatna's royal palace attests to contact with the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a> region; they depict typical <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan</a> motifs such as palm trees and dolphins.

Qatna also had a distinctive local craftsmanship; the wall paintings in the royal palace, though including Aegean motifs, depict elements that are not typical either in Syria or the Aegean region, such as turtles and crabs. This hybrid style of Qatna prompted Pfälzner to suggest a "craftsmanship interaction model", which is based on the assumption that Aegean artists were employed in local Syrian workshops. Local workshops modeled amber in Syrian style; many pieces were found in the royal hypogeum including 90 beads and a vessel in the shape of a lion head. Ivory was connected to the royal family and the pieces discovered reflect a high level of craftsmanship that was influenced by Egyptian traditions. Jewelry was made to fit local tastes even when the origin of the concept was foreign; an example would be the <a href="Scarab%20%28artifact%29">scarabs</a>, traditional Egyptian objects, that were modified in Qatna by engraving them with local motifs and encasing them with gold, which is atypical for Egyptian specimens. Aside from two golden beads that seem imported from Egypt, no jewelry discovered was of foreign origin.

Typical western Syrian architectural traditions are seen in the eastern palace, which has an asymmetrical plan and tripartite reception halls. The lower city palace also shows typical second-millennium Syrian features, being elongated and lacking the huge courtyards that were a traditional Mesopotamian feature; instead, the palace had several small courtyards spread within it. Qatna's royal palace was unique in its monumental architecture; it had a distinctive foundation and the throne room walls were wide, which does not occur elsewhere in the architecture of the ancient Near East. The period following the destruction of the royal palace shows a clear break in culture, evidenced by the poor building materials and architectural techniques.

Finds in "Tomb IV" indicate that Qatna was engaged in long distance trade since its early history. The city's location on the edges of the Syrian steppes turned it into a strategic stop for caravans traveling to the Mediterranean Sea from the east. The countryside surrounding the city provided the key for its success in the Early Bronze Age IV; those lands were capable of supporting both agriculture and pastoralism. Despite the modern scarcity of water, geoarchaeological research on the wadis of the region confirm the abundance of water during the Bronze Age. The land was abundant in pasture lands; when drought struck Mari, Išḫi-Addu allowed its nomads to graze their flocks in Qatna.

The written sources do not offer deep insight on the economy of the kingdom; it counted mainly on agriculture during the Middle Bronze Age but, by the Late Bronze Age, it became based on trade with surrounding regions. Securing raw materials scarce near the city was an important concern for the rulers; basalt was an important building tool and it was probably acquired from the <a href="Salamiyah">Salamiyah</a> region or <a href="Al-Rastan">Al-Rastan</a>. Calcite was provided from either the Syrian coast or Egypt, amber came from the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> region, while regions in modern <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> provided carnelian and lapis-lazul.

The main routes passing Qatna were from Babylon to Byblos through Palmyra, from Ugarit to Emar, and from Anatolia to Egypt. Taxes on caravans crossing the trade routes allowed the city's royalty to get rich; an insight into Qatna's wealth can be acquired from the dowry of Išḫi-Addu's daughter, who was endowed with 10 talents of silver (288 kg) and 5 talents of textiles (worth 144 kg of silver). White horses were among Qatna's most famous exports, in addition to high-quality wines, woods from the nearby Lebanon mountain, and goods, such as chariots, from a highly skilled craft industry.

Many Egyptian imports were found in the city, including the "sphinx of Ita", which represents a daughter of the Egyptian pharaoh <a href="Amenemhat%20II">Amenemhat II</a>, and a vessel with the name of <a href="Senusret%20I">Senusret I</a> inscribed on it, plus around 50 stone vessels in the royal hypogeum. Two units of weight and payment measurement are prominent in Qatna: the <a href="Mina%20%28unit%29">mina</a> and the <a href="shekel">shekel</a>. The mina had different values from region to region but it seems that in Qatna the preferred value was 470 g, while the preferred value of the shekel is hard to figure.

The existence of agricultural facilities on the acropolis during the EB IV early city indicates that a central authority oversaw the production process; perhaps the city was a center of one of the princes of Ib'al. Another piece of evidence is "Tomb IV", which contained the remains of 40 people, 300 pottery vessels, weapons and ornaments. The tomb probably belonged to the elite or the ruling family of the city. In the kingdom of Qatna, the crown prince had the city of <a href="Al-Qaryatayn">Nazala</a> as his domain. The palace was mainly a political and administrative institution devoid of religious functions, in contrast to the palace of Mari. In the realm of Hamath, Qatna was an administrative center probably in control of the kingdom's southern regions. During the Assyrian period, Qatna lost its administrative role and even its urban character until its abandonment.

Du Mesnil du Buisson led excavations starting in 1924, and annually from 1927 to 1929; the third millennium BC remains provided scarce samples and most of the data come from Tomb IV. In 1994, a Syrian mission led by <a href="Michel%20Al-Maqdissi">Michel Al-Maqdissi</a> conducted several surveys and surface excavations, then, in 1999, a joint Syrian–Italian–German mission was formed that was headed by Al-Maqdissi, <a href="Daniele%20Morandi%20Bonacossi">Daniele Morandi Bonacossi</a> and Pfälzner. Due to the development of the excavations, the Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums split the mission into Syrian (headed by Al-Maqdissi), Syrian–German (headed by Pfälzner) and Syrian–Italian (headed by Morandi Bonacossi) missions in 2004.

Research was focused on the upper city while the lower city remained largely untouched; by 2006, only 5% of the site's total area had been excavated. The royal palace was split into two excavation areas: operation G covering the western part and operation H covering the eastern part. Operation J covers the summit of the acropolis, while the lower city palace is covered by operation K. One of the most important discoveries came in 2002, when the archive of king Idanda was discovered, containing 67 clay tablets. As a result of the <a href="Syrian%20Civil%20War">Syrian Civil War</a>, excavations stopped in 2011.

William Sterling Parsons

<a href="Rear%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> William Sterling "Deak" Parsons (26 November 1901 – 5 December 1953) was an American naval officer who worked as an ordnance expert on the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. He is best known for being the weaponeer on the "<a href="Enola%20Gay">Enola Gay</a>", the aircraft which dropped the <a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a> atomic bomb on <a href="Hiroshima%2C%20Japan">Hiroshima, Japan</a> in 1945. To avoid the possibility of a nuclear explosion if the aircraft crashed and burned on takeoff, he decided to arm the bomb in flight. While the aircraft was "en route" to Hiroshima, Parsons climbed into the cramped and dark bomb bay, and inserted the powder charge and detonator. He was awarded the <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a> for his part in the mission.

A 1922 graduate of the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a>, Parsons served on a variety of warships beginning with the <a href="battleship">battleship</a> . He was trained in ordnance and studied <a href="ballistics">ballistics</a> under <a href="L.T.E.%20Thompson">L.T.E. Thompson</a> at the <a href="Naval%20Surface%20Warfare%20Center%20Dahlgren%20Division">Naval Proving Ground</a> in <a href="Dahlgren%2C%20Virginia">Dahlgren</a>, Virginia. In July 1933, Parsons became liaison officer between the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Ordnance">Bureau of Ordnance</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Research%20Laboratory">Naval Research Laboratory</a>. He became interested in <a href="radar">radar</a> and was one of the first to recognize its potential to locate ships and aircraft, and perhaps even track shells in flight. In September 1940, Parsons and <a href="Merle%20Tuve">Merle Tuve</a> of the <a href="National%20Defense%20Research%20Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a> began work on the development of the <a href="proximity%20fuze">proximity fuze</a>, a radar-triggered fuze that would explode a shell in the proximity of the target. The fuze, eventually known as the VT (variable time) fuze, Mark 32, went into production in 1942. Parsons was on hand to watch the <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> shoot down the first enemy aircraft with a VT fuze in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> in January 1943.

In June 1943, Parsons joined the Manhattan Project as Associate Director at the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20National%20Laboratory">research laboratory</a> at <a href="Los%20Alamos%2C%20New%20Mexico">Los Alamos</a>, New Mexico under <a href="J.%20Robert%20Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>. Parsons became responsible for the ordnance aspects of the project, including the design and testing of the non-nuclear components of <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s. In a reorganization in 1944, he lost responsibility for the implosion-type fission weapon, but retained that for the design and development of the <a href="gun-type%20fission%20weapon">gun-type fission weapon</a>, which eventually became Little Boy. He was also responsible for the delivery program, codenamed <a href="Project%20Alberta">Project Alberta</a>. He watched the <a href="Trinity%20%28nuclear%20test%29">Trinity nuclear test</a> from a <a href="B-29">B-29</a>.

After the war, Parsons was promoted to the rank of rear admiral without ever having commanded a ship. He participated in <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a>, the nuclear weapon tests at <a href="Bikini%20Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a> in 1946, and later the <a href="Operation%20Sandstone">Operation Sandstone</a> tests at <a href="Enewetak%20Atoll">Enewetak Atoll</a> in 1948. In 1947, he became deputy commander of the <a href="Armed%20Forces%20Special%20Weapons%20Project">Armed Forces Special Weapons Project</a>. He died of a heart attack on 5 December 1953.

William Sterling Parsons was born in <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago</a>, Illinois, on 26 November 1901, the oldest of three children of a lawyer, Harry Robert Parsons, and his wife Clara, née Doolittle. In 1909, the family moved to <a href="Fort%20Sumner%2C%20New%20Mexico">Fort Sumner</a>, New Mexico, where William learned to speak fluent Spanish. He attended the local schools in Fort Sumner and was home schooled by his mother for a time. He commenced at <a href="Santa%20Rosa%20High%20School%20%28Santa%20Rosa%2C%20New%20Mexico%29">Santa Rosa High School</a>, where his mother taught English and Spanish, rapidly advancing through three years in just one. In 1917 he attended Fort Sumner High School, from which he graduated in 1918.

In 1917 Parsons travelled to <a href="Roswell%2C%20New%20Mexico">Roswell</a>, New Mexico to take the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> exam for one of the appointments by Senator <a href="Andrieus%20A.%20Jones">Andrieus A. Jones</a>. He was only an alternate, but passed the exam while more favored candidates did not, and received the appointment. As he was only 16, two years younger than most candidates, he was shorter and lighter than the physical standards called for, but managed to convince the examining board to admit him anyway. He entered the Naval Academy at <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis</a>, Maryland in 1918, and eventually graduated 48th out of 539 in the class of 1922, in which <a href="Hyman%20G.%20Rickover">Hyman G. Rickover</a> graduated 107th. At the time, it was customary for midshipmen to acquire nicknames, and Parsons was called "Deacon", a play on his last name. This became shortened to "Deak".

On graduating in June 1922, Parsons was commissioned as an <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">ensign</a> and posted to the <a href="battleship">battleship</a> , where he was placed in charge of one of the 14-inch gun turrets. In May 1927, Parsons, now a <a href="lieutenant%20%28junior%20grade%29">lieutenant (junior grade)</a>, returned to Annapolis, where he commenced a course in ordnance at the <a href="Naval%20Postgraduate%20School">Naval Postgraduate School</a>. He became friends with Lieutenant Jack Crenshaw, a fellow officer attending the same training course. Jack asked Parsons to be best man at his wedding to Betty Cluverius, the daughter of the Commandant of the <a href="Norfolk%20Navy%20Yard">Norfolk Navy Yard</a>, <a href="Rear%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Wat%20Tyler%20Cluverius%2C%20Jr.">Wat Tyler Cluverius, Jr.</a>, at the Norfolk Navy Chapel. As best man, Parsons was paired with Betty's maid of honor, her sister Martha. Parsons and Martha got along well, and in November 1929, they too were married at the Norfolk Navy Chapel. This time, Jack and Betty were best man and maid of honor.
The ordnance course was normally followed by a relevant field posting, so Parsons was sent to the <a href="Naval%20Surface%20Warfare%20Center%20Dahlgren%20Division">Naval Proving Ground</a> in <a href="Dahlgren%2C%20Virginia">Dahlgren</a>, Virginia to further study <a href="ballistics">ballistics</a> under <a href="L.T.E.%20Thompson">L.T.E. Thompson</a>. Following the usual pattern of alternating duty afloat and ashore, Parsons was posted to the battleship in June 1930, with the rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20%28naval%29">lieutenant</a>. In November, the Commander in Chief <a href="United%20States%20Fleet">United States Fleet</a>, <a href="Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Admiral</a> <a href="Jehu%20V.%20Chase">Jehu V. Chase</a>, hoisted his flag on the "Texas", bringing Cluverius with him as his chief of staff. This was awkward for Parsons, but Cluverius understood, being himself the son-in-law of an admiral, in his case, Admiral <a href="William%20T.%20Sampson">William T. Sampson</a>.

In July 1933, Parsons became liaison officer between the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Ordnance">Bureau of Ordnance</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Research%20Laboratory">Naval Research Laboratory</a> (NRL) in Washington, DC. At the NRL he was briefed by the head of its Radio Division, <a href="A.%20Hoyt%20Taylor">A. Hoyt Taylor</a>, who told him about experiments that had been carried out into what the Navy would later name <a href="radar">radar</a>. Parsons immediately recognized the potential of the new invention to locate ships and aircraft, and perhaps even track shells in flight. For this, he realized that he was going to need high frequency <a href="microwave">microwave</a>s. He discovered that no one had attempted this. The scientists had not considered all the applications of the technology, and the Navy bureaus had not grasped their potential. He was able to persuade the scientists to establish a group to investigate microwave radar, but without official sanction it had low priority. Parsons submitted a memorandum on the subject to the Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) requesting $5,000 per annum for research. To his dismay, the BuOrd and <a href="Bureau%20of%20Engineering">Bureau of Engineering</a>, which was responsible for the NRL, turned down his proposal.

Some thought that Parsons was ruining his career with his advocacy of radar, but he acquired one powerful backer. The Chief of the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Aeronautics">Bureau of Aeronautics</a> (BuAer), Rear Admiral <a href="Ernest%20J.%20King">Ernest J. King</a>, supported the use of radar as a means of determining aircraft altitude. When the Bureau of Engineering protested that such a device would necessarily be too large to carry on a plane, King told them that it would still be worthwhile, even if the only aircraft in the Navy big enough to carry it was the airship .

Parson's marriage produced three daughters. The first, Hannah, was born in 1932; the second, Margaret (Peggy), followed in 1934. Hannah died of <a href="polio">polio</a> in April 1935. Parsons returned to sea in June 1936 as the executive officer of the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> . He was promoted to <a href="Lieutenant%20commander%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant commander</a> in May 1937. His third daughter, Clara (Clare), was born the same year. On that occasion, Parsons left Martha with the newborn and three-year-old Peggy to care for and reported for duty the next day, believing that his first responsibility was to his ship. His skipper, <a href="Commander%20%28United%20States%29">Commander</a> <a href="Earl%20E.%20Stone">Earl E. Stone</a>, did not agree, and sent him home. In March 1938, Rear Admiral <a href="William%20R.%20Sexton">William R. Sexton</a> had Parsons assigned to his <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, the cruiser , as gunnery officer. Parson's task was to improve the gunnery scores of his command, and in this he succeeded.

Parsons was posted back to Dahlgren in September 1939 as experimental officer. The atmosphere had changed considerably. In June 1940, President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> approved the creation of the <a href="National%20Defense%20Research%20Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a> (NDRC), under the direction of <a href="Vannevar%20Bush">Vannevar Bush</a>. <a href="Richard%20C.%20Tolman">Richard C. Tolman</a>, dean of the graduate school at <a href="Caltech">Caltech</a>, was given responsibility for the NDRC's Armor and Ordnance Division. Tolman met with Parsons and Thompson in July 1940, and discussed their needs. Within the Navy, too, there was a change of attitude, with <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-6%29">Captain</a> <a href="William%20Henry%20Purnell%20Blandy">William H. P. (Spike) Blandy</a> as the head of BuOrd's Research Desk. Blandy welcomed the assistance of NDRC scientists in improving and developing weapons.

In September 1940, Parsons and <a href="Merle%20Tuve">Merle Tuve</a> of NDRC began work on a new concept. Shooting down an aircraft with an <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft gun</a> was a difficult proposition. As a shell had to hit a speeding aircraft at an uncertain altitude, the only hope seemed to be to fill the sky with ammunition. A direct hit was not actually required; an aircraft might be destroyed or critically damaged by a shell detonating nearby. With this in mind, anti-aircraft gunners used <a href="Artillery%20fuze%23Time%20fuzes">time fuzes</a> to increase the possibility of damage. The question then arose as to whether radar could be used to create an explosion in the proximity of an aircraft. Tuve's first suggestion was to have an aircraft drop a radar-controlled bomb on a bomber formation. Parsons saw that while this was technically feasible, it was tactically problematic.

The ideal solution was a <a href="proximity%20fuze">proximity fuze</a> inside an artillery shell, but there were numerous technical difficulties with this. The radar set had to be made small enough to fit inside a shell, and its glass <a href="vacuum%20tube">vacuum tube</a>s had to first withstand the 20,000 <a href="g%20force">g force</a> of being fired from a gun, and then 500 rotations per second in flight. A special Section T of NDRC was created, chaired by Tuve, with Parsons as special assistant to Bush and liaison between NDRC and BuOrd.

On 29 January 1942, Parsons reported to Blandy that a batch of fifty proximity fuzes from the pilot production plant had been test fired, and 26 of them had exploded correctly. Blandy therefore ordered full-scale production to begin. In April 1942, Bush, now the Director of the <a href="Office%20of%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> (OSRD), placed the project directly under OSRD. The research effort remained under Tuve but moved to the <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a>'s <a href="Applied%20Physics%20Laboratory">Applied Physics Laboratory</a> (APL), where Parsons was BuOrd's representative. In August 1942, a live firing test was conducted with the newly commissioned cruiser . Three <a href="pilotless%20drone">pilotless drone</a>s were shot down in succession.

Parsons had the new proximity fuzes, now known as VT (variable time) fuze, Mark 32, flown to the <a href="Mare%20Island%20Navy%20Yard">Mare Island Navy Yard</a>, where they were mated with <a href="5%26quot%3B/38%20caliber%20gun">5"/38 caliber gun</a> rounds. Some 5,000 of them were then shipped to the South Pacific. Parsons flew there himself, where he met with Admiral <a href="William%20F.%20Halsey">William F. Halsey</a> at his headquarters in <a href="Noum%C3%A9a">Nouméa</a>. He arranged for Parsons to take VT fuzes out with him on the cruiser . On 6 January 1943, "Helena" was part of a cruiser force that bombarded <a href="Munda%2C%20Solomon%20Islands">Munda</a> in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. On the return trip, the cruisers were attacked by four <a href="Aichi%20D3A">Aichi D3A</a> (Val) dive bombers. "Helena" fired at one with a VT fuze. It exploded close to the aircraft, which crashed into the sea.

To preserve the secrecy of the weapon, its use was initially permitted only over water, where a dud round could not fall into enemy hands. In late 1943, the Army obtained permission for it to be used over land. It proved particularly effective against the <a href="V-1%20%28flying%20bomb%29">V-1 flying bomb</a> over England, and later <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> in 1944. The use of a version fired from <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a>s against ground targets was authorized in response to the German <a href="Ardennes%20Offensive">Ardennes Offensive</a> in December 1944, with deadly effect. By the end of 1944, VT fuzes were coming off the production lines at the rate of 40,000 per day.

Parsons returned to Dahlgren in March 1943. Around this time, a <a href="Los%20Alamos%20National%20Laboratory">research laboratory</a> was established at <a href="Los%20Alamos%2C%20New%20Mexico">Los Alamos</a>, New Mexico under the direction of <a href="J.%20Robert%20Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a> as Project Y, which was part of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>, the top-secret effort to develop an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>. The creation of a practical weapon would necessarily require an expert in ordnance, and Oppenheimer tentatively pencilled in Tolman for the role, but getting him released from OSRD was another matter. Until then, Oppenheimer had to do the job himself. In May 1943, the Manhattan Project's director, <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves">Leslie R. Groves</a>, took up the matter with the Military Policy Committee, the high-level committee that oversaw the Manhattan Project. It consisted of Vannevar Bush as its chairman, Brigadier General <a href="Wilhelm%20D.%20Styer">Wilhelm D. Styer</a> who represented the Army, and Rear Admiral <a href="William%20R.%20Purnell">William R. Purnell</a> as the Navy's representative.

Groves told them that he was looking for someone with "a sound understanding of both practical and theoretical ordnance – high explosives, guns and fusing – a wide acquaintance and an excellent reputation among military ordnance people and an ability to gain their support; a reasonably broad background in scientific development; and an ability to attract and hold the respect of scientists." He said that a military officer would be his ideal, as the job might involve planning and coordinating the use of the bomb, but added that he knew of no Army officer who fit the bill. Bush then suggested Parsons, a nomination supported by Purnell. The next morning, Parsons received a phone call from Purnell, ordering him to report to Admiral King, who was now the Commander in Chief, US Fleet (Cominch). In a terse ten-minute meeting, King briefed Parsons on the Project, which he said had his full backing. That afternoon, Parsons met with Groves, who quickly sized him up as the right man for the job.
Parsons was relieved of his duties at Dahlgren and officially assigned to Admiral King's Cominch staff on 1 June 1943, with a promotion to the rank of captain. On 15 June 1943 he arrived at Los Alamos as Associate Director. Parsons would be Oppenheimer's second in command. Parsons and his family moved into one of the houses on "Bathtub Row" that had formerly belonged to the headmaster and staff of the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Ranch%20School">Los Alamos Ranch School</a>. Bathtub row, so-called because the houses were the only ones at Los Alamos with bathtubs, was the most prestigious address at Los Alamos. Parsons became Oppenheimer's next-door neighbor, and in fact his house was slightly larger, because Parsons had two children and Oppenheimer, at this point, had only one. With two school-age children, Parsons took a keen interest in the construction of the Central School at Los Alamos, and became president of the school board. Instead of the temporary two-story structure that Groves had envisioned in the interest of economy and not misusing the project's high priorities for labor and materials, Parsons had a well-built, modern, single-story school constructed. On seeing the result, Groves said: "I'll hold you personally responsible for this, Parsons."

Oppenheimer had already recruited key people for Parson's Ordnance Division. <a href="Edwin%20McMillan">Edwin McMillan</a> was a physicist who headed the Proving Ground Group. His first task was to establish the ordnance test area. Later he became Parsons' deputy for the <a href="gun-type%20fission%20weapon">gun-type fission weapon</a>. <a href="Charles%20Critchfield">Charles Critchfield</a>, a <a href="mathematical%20physicist">mathematical physicist</a> with ordnance experience at the Army's <a href="Aberdeen%20Proving%20Ground">Aberdeen Proving Ground</a>, was in charge of the Target, Projectile and Source Group. <a href="Kenneth%20Bainbridge">Kenneth Bainbridge</a> arrived in August to take charge of the Instrumentation Group. Parsons recruited <a href="Robert%20Brode">Robert Brode</a> from the proximity fuze project to become head of the Fuze Development Group. <a href="Joseph%20Hirschfelder">Joseph Hirschfelder</a> was brought in as an expert on <a href="internal%20ballistics">internal ballistics</a>, and headed the Interior Ballistics Group. From the beginning, Parsons wanted <a href="Norman%20Ramsey">Norman Ramsey</a> as the head of the delivery group. Edward L. Bowles, the scientific adviser to the <a href="Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a>, <a href="Henry%20L.%20Stimson">Henry L. Stimson</a>, was reluctant to part with Ramsey, but gave way under pressure from Groves, Tolman and Bush. Perhaps the most controversial group head would be <a href="Seth%20Neddermeyer">Seth Neddermeyer</a>, the head of the Implosion Experimentation Group; for the time being, Parson accorded a relatively low priority to this work. He also recruited Hazel Greenbacker as his secretary.
Groves, among others, felt that Parsons had a tendency to fill positions with Naval officers. There was some aspect of service parochialism, and Parsons believed that involvement in the Manhattan Project would be important for the future of the Navy, but it was also due to the difficulty of getting highly skilled people from any source in wartime. Parsons simply found it easiest to get them through Navy channels. Lieutenant Commander <a href="Norris%20Bradbury">Norris Bradbury</a> said that he did not wish to join Project Y, but was soon on his way to Los Alamos anyway. Parsons recruited Commander <a href="Francis%20Birch%20%28geophysicist%29">Francis Birch</a>, who replaced McMillan at Anchor Ranch. Commander <a href="Frederick%20Ashworth">Frederick Ashworth</a> was a Naval ordnance officer and aviator who was senior aviator at Dahlgren when he was brought in to work on the delivery side. By the end of the war, there were 41 Naval officers at Los Alamos.

Over the next few months, Parsons' division designed the gun-type <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> weapon, codenamed <a href="Thin%20Man%20%28nuclear%20bomb%29">Thin Man</a>. It was assumed that a <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a> weapon would be similar in nature. Hirschfelder's group considered various designs, and evaluated different propellants. The ordnance test area, which became known as "Anchor Ranch", was established on a nearby ranch, where Parsons conducted test firings with a 3-inch anti-aircraft gun. Work on implosion lagged by comparison, but this was not initially a major concern, because it was expected that the gun-type would work with both uranium and plutonium. However, Oppenheimer, Groves and Parsons lobbied Purnell and Tolman to get <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a> to have a look at the problem. Von Neumann suggested the use of shaped charges to initiate implosion.
Oppenheimer considered that there was a "reciprocal lack of confidence" between Parsons and Neddermeyer, and in October 1943 he brought in <a href="George%20Kistiakowsky">George Kistiakowsky</a>, who began a new attack on the implosion design. Kistiakowsky clashed with both Parsons and Neddermeyer, but felt that "my disagreements with Deak Parsons were very minor compared to my disagreements with Neddermeyer." The implosion design acquired a new urgency in April 1944, when studies of reactor-produced plutonium confirmed that it could not be used in a gun-type weapon. An accelerated effort was called for to design and build the implosion-type weapon, codenamed <a href="Fat%20Man">Fat Man</a>. Two new groups were created at Los Alamos: X (for explosives) Division headed by Kistiakowsky, and G (for gadget) Division under <a href="Robert%20Bacher">Robert Bacher</a>. Parsons was placed in charge of O (for ordnance) Division, with responsibility for both the gun-type design and delivery.

The uranium gun-type weapon known as <a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a> did prove to be simpler than Thin Man. The gun velocity needed to be only , a third that of Thin Man. A corresponding reduction in the barrel length reduced the bomb's overall length to . In turn, this made it much easier to handle, and permitted a conventional bomb shape, resulting in a more predictable flight. The main concerns with Little Boy were its safety and reliability.

The delivery program, codenamed <a href="Project%20Alberta">Project Alberta</a>, got underway under Ramsey's direction in October 1943. Starting in November, the <a href="Air%20Force%20Materiel%20Command">Army Air Forces Materiel Command</a> at <a href="Wright%20Field">Wright Field</a>, Ohio, began <a href="Silverplate">Silverplate</a>, the codename for the modification of <a href="B-29">B-29</a>s to carry the bombs. Parsons arranged for a test program at Dahlgren using scale models of Thin Man and Fat Man. Test drops were carried out at <a href="Edwards%20Air%20Force%20Base">Muroc Army Air Field</a>, <a href="California">California</a> and the <a href="Naval%20Air%20Weapons%20Station%20China%20Lake">Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern</a>, California using full-size replicas of Fat Man known as <a href="pumpkin%20bomb">pumpkin bomb</a>s. The ungainly and non-aerodynamic shape of Fat Man proved to be the main difficulty, but many other problems were encountered and overcome. Parsons, wrote Oppenheimer, "has been almost alone in this project to appreciate the actual military and engineering problems which we would encounter. He has been almost alone in insisting on facing these problems at a date early enough so that we might arrive at their solution."
In July 1944, Parsons joined Jack Crenshaw, who was investigating the <a href="Port%20Chicago%20disaster">Port Chicago disaster</a>. The two men surveyed the disaster area, where 1,500 tons of munitions had exploded and 320 men had lost their lives. A year later, Parsons watched the <a href="Trinity%20%28nuclear%20test%29">Trinity nuclear test</a> from a circling B-29. Afterwards, Parsons flew to <a href="Tinian">Tinian</a>, where the B-29s of Colonel <a href="Paul%20W.%20Tibbets">Paul W. Tibbets</a>' <a href="509th%20Composite%20Group">509th Composite Group</a> were preparing to deliver the weapons. En route, he stopped off in <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> to visit his eighteen-year-old half-brother Bob, a marine who had been badly wounded in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Iwo%20Jima">Battle of Iwo Jima</a>. Parsons also met with Captain <a href="Charles%20B.%20McVay%20III">Charles B. McVay III</a>, the skipper of the cruiser , in Purnell's office at the <a href="Embarcadero%20%28San%20Francisco%29">Embarcadero</a> in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> and gave McVay his orders: 

Parsons was in charge of scientists and technicians from Project Alberta on Tinian, who were nominally organized as the 1st Technical Service Detachment. Their role was the handling and maintenance of the nuclear weapons. Parsons was joined by Purnell, who represented the Military Liaison Committee, and Brigadier General <a href="Thomas%20F.%20Farrell">Thomas F. Farrell</a>, Groves' Deputy for Operations. They became, informally, the "Tinian Joint Chiefs", with decision-making authority over the nuclear mission. Before Farrell left for Tinian, Groves had told him: "Don't let Parsons get killed. We need him!"
In the space of a week on Tinian, four B-29s crashed and burned on the runway. Parsons became very concerned. If a B-29 crashed with a Little Boy, the fire could cook off the explosive and detonate the weapon, with catastrophic consequences. He raised the possibility of arming the bomb in flight with Farrell, who agreed that it might be a good idea. Farrell asked Parsons if he knew how to perform this task. "No sir, I don't", Parsons conceded, "but I've got all afternoon to learn." The night before the mission, Parsons repeatedly practiced inserting the powder charge and detonator in the bomb in the poor visibility and cramped conditions of the bomb bay.

Parsons participated in the <a href="bombing%20of%20Hiroshima">bombing of Hiroshima</a> on 6 August 1945, flying on the "<a href="Enola%20Gay">Enola Gay</a>" as weaponeer and Senior Military Technical Observer. Shortly after takeoff, he clambered into the bomb bay and carefully carried out the procedure that he had rehearsed the night before. It was Parsons and not Tibbetts, the pilot, who was in charge of the mission. He approved the choice of Hiroshima as the target, and gave the final approval for the bomb to be released. For his part in the mission, Parsons was awarded the <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a>, and was promoted to the wartime rank of <a href="Commodore%20%28United%20States%29">commodore</a> on 10 August 1945. For his work on the Manhattan Project, he was awarded the <a href="Navy%20Distinguished%20Service%20Medal">Navy Distinguished Service Medal</a>.

In November 1945, King created a new position of Deputy <a href="Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Chief of Naval Operations</a> for Special Weapons, which was given to Vice Admiral Blandy. Parsons became Blandy's assistant. In turn, Parsons had two assistants of his own, Ashworth and <a href="Horacio%20Rivero%2C%20Jr.">Horacio Rivero, Jr.</a> He also brought Greenbacker from Los Alamos to help set up the new office. Parsons was a strong supporter of research into the use of nuclear power for warship propulsion, but disagreed with Rear Admiral <a href="Harold%20G.%20Bowen%2C%20Sr.">Harold G. Bowen, Sr.</a>, the head of the <a href="Office%20of%20Naval%20Research">Office of Research and Inventions</a>, who wanted the Navy to initiate its own nuclear project. Parsons felt that the Navy should work with the Manhattan Project, and arranged for Naval officers to be assigned to Oak Ridge. The most senior of them was his former classmate Rickover, who became assistant director there. They immersed themselves in the study of nuclear energy, laying the foundations for a <a href="nuclear%20navy">nuclear-powered navy</a>.
On 11 January 1946, Blandy was appointed to command Joint Task Force One (JTF-1), a special force created to conduct a series of nuclear weapon tests at <a href="Bikini%20Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a>, which he named <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a>, to determine the effect of nuclear weapons on warships. Parsons, who was promoted to the rank of rear admiral on 8 January 1946, became Blandy's Deputy Commander for Technical Direction and Commander Task Group 1.1. Parsons worked hard to make a success of the operation, which he described as "the largest laboratory experiment in history". In addition to the 95 target ships, there was a support fleet of more than 150 ships, 156 aircraft, and over 42,000 personnel.

Parsons witnessed the first explosion, Able, from the deck of the task force flagship, the <a href="command%20ship">command ship</a> . An airburst like the Hiroshima blast, it was unimpressive, and even Parsons thought that it must have been smaller than the Hiroshima bomb. It failed to sink the target ship, the battleship , mainly because it missed it by a considerable distance. This made it difficult to assess the amount of damage caused, which was the objective of the exercise. Blandy then announced that the next test, Baker, would occur in just three weeks. This meant that Parsons had to carry out the evaluation of Able simultaneously with the preparations for Baker. This time he assisted with the final preparations on before heading back to <a href="seaplane%20tender">seaplane tender</a> for the test. The underwater Baker explosion was no larger than Able, but the dome and water column made it look far more spectacular. The real problem was the radioactive fallout, as Colonel <a href="Stafford%20L.%20Warren">Stafford L. Warren</a>, the Manhattan Project's medical advisor, had predicted. The target ships proved impossible to decontaminate and, lacking targets, the test series had to be called off. For his part in Operation Crossroads, Parsons was awarded the <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a>.

The Special Weapons Office was abolished in November 1946, and the Manhattan Project followed suit at the end of the year. A civilian agency, the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">United States Atomic Energy Commission</a> (AEC), was created by the <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Act%20of%201946">Atomic Energy Act of 1946</a> to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project, including development, production and control of nuclear weapons. The law provided for a Military Liaison Committee (MLC) to advise the AEC on military matters, and Parsons became a member. A joint Army-Navy organization, the <a href="Armed%20Forces%20Special%20Weapons%20Project">Armed Forces Special Weapons Project</a> (AFSWP), was created to handle the military aspects of nuclear weapons. Groves was appointed to command the AFSWP, with Parsons and Air Force Major General <a href="Roscoe%20C.%20Wilson">Roscoe C. Wilson</a> as his deputies. In this capacity, Parsons pressed for the development of improved nuclear weapons. During the <a href="Operation%20Sandstone">Operation Sandstone</a> series of nuclear weapon tests at <a href="Enewetak%20Atoll">Enewetak Atoll</a> in 1948, Parsons once again served as deputy commander. Parsons hoped that his next posting would be to sea, but he was instead sent to the <a href="Weapons%20Systems%20Evaluation%20Group">Weapons Systems Evaluation Group</a> in 1949. He finally returned to sea duty in 1951, this time as Commander, Cruiser Division 6, despite having never commanded a ship. Parsons and his cruisers conducted a tour of the Mediterranean <a href="wikt%3Ashow%20the%20flag">showing the flag</a>. He then became Deputy Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance in March 1952.

Parsons remained in contact with Oppenheimer. The two men and their wives visited each other from time to time, and the Parsons family especially enjoyed visiting its former neighbors at their new home at Olden Manor, a 17th-century estate with a cook and <a href="groundskeeper">groundskeeper</a>, surrounded by of woodlands at the <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a> in <a href="Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton</a>, New Jersey. Parsons was disturbed by the rise of <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a> in the early 1950s. In 1953 he wrote a letter to Oppenheimer expressing his hope that "the anti-intellectualism of recent months may have passed its peak". On 4 December that year, Parsons heard of President <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>'s "blank wall" directive, blocking Oppenheimer from access to classified material. Parsons became visibly upset, and that night began experiencing severe chest pains. The next morning, he went to <a href="Bethesda%20Naval%20Hospital">Bethesda Naval Hospital</a>, where he died while the doctors were still examining him. He was buried at <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a> alongside his daughter Hannah. He was survived by his father, brother, half-brother and sister, as well as his wife Martha and daughters Peggy and Clare.

The <a href="Rear%20Admiral%20William%20S.%20Parsons%20Award">Rear Admiral William S. Parsons Award for Scientific and Technical Progress</a> was established by the Navy in his memory. It is awarded "to a Navy or Marine Corps officer, enlisted person, or civilian who has made an outstanding contribution in any field of science that has furthered the development and progress of the Navy or Marine Corps." The <a href="Forrest%20Sherman%20class%20destroyer">"Forrest Sherman"-class</a> <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> was named in his honor. Her keel was laid down by <a href="Ingalls%20Shipbuilding">Ingalls Shipbuilding</a> of <a href="Pascagoula%2C%20Mississippi">Pascagoula</a>, Mississippi on 17 June 1957 and was launched by his widow Martha on 17 August 1958. When it was rechristened as a guided missile destroyer (DDG-33) in 1967, Clare, now a Naval officer herself, represented her family. "Parsons" was decommissioned on 19 November 1982, stricken from the Navy list on 1 December 1984, and disposed of as a target on 25 April 1989. The Deak Parsons Center, headquarters of Afloat Training Group, Atlantic, in Norfolk, Virginia, was also named for him. Parsons' portrait is among a series of paintings related to Operation Crossroads. His papers are in the <a href="Naval%20Historical%20Center">Naval Historical Center</a> in Washington, DC.

Deusdedit of Canterbury

Deusdedit (died <a href="circa">c.</a> 664) was a medieval <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, the first native-born holder of the <a href="see%20of%20Canterbury">see of Canterbury</a>. By birth an <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a>, he became archbishop in 655 and held the office for more than nine years until his death, probably from <a href="plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a>. Deusdedit's successor as archbishop was one of his priests at Canterbury. There is some controversy over the exact date of Deusdedit's death, owing to discrepancies in the medieval written work that records his life. Little is known about his episcopate, but he was considered to be a <a href="saint">saint</a> after his demise. A <a href="hagiography">saint's life</a> was written after his <a href="relic">relic</a>s were moved from their original burial place in 1091.

A post-<a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a> tradition, originating with <a href="Goscelin">Goscelin</a>, gives Deusdedit's original name as "Frithona", possibly a corruption of Frithuwine. He was consecrated by <a href="Ithamar%20%28bishop%29">Ithamar</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Rochester">Bishop of Rochester</a>, on 26 March or perhaps 12 March 655. He was the sixth archbishop after the arrival of the <a href="List%20of%20members%20of%20the%20Gregorian%20mission">Gregorian missionaries</a>, and the first to be a native of the island of Great Britain rather than an Italian, having been born a <a href="Wessex">West Saxon</a>. One reason for the long period between the <a href="Christianization">Christianization</a> of the Kentish kingdom from <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20paganism">Anglo-Saxon paganism</a> in about 600 and the appointment of the first native archbishop may have been the need for the schools established by the <a href="Gregorian%20mission">Gregorian mission</a>aries to educate the natives to a sufficiently high standard for them to take ecclesiastical office. Deusdedit probably owed his appointment to the <a href="see%20of%20Canterbury">see of Canterbury</a> to a collaboration between <a href="Eorcenberht%20of%20Kent">Eorcenberht of Kent</a> and <a href="Cenwalh%20of%20Wessex">Cenwalh of Wessex</a>. The name Deusdedit means "God has given" in Latin, and had been the name of a recent pope, <a href="Pope%20Adeodatus%20I">Deusdedit</a>, in office from 615 to 618; it was the practice of many of the early medieval Saxon bishops to take an adopted name, often from recent papal names. It is unclear when Deusdedit adopted his new name, although the historian Richard Sharpe considers it likely to have been when he was consecrated as an archbishop, rather than when he entered <a href="Consecrated%20life">religious life</a>.

The see of Canterbury seems at this time to have been passing through a period of comparative obscurity. During Deusdedit's nine years as archbishop, all the new bishops in England were consecrated by <a href="Celtic%20Christianity">Celtic</a> or foreign bishops, with one exception: Deusdedit consecrated <a href="Damianus">Damianus</a>, Ithamar's successor as Bishop of Rochester. Deusdedit did, however, found a <a href="nunnery">nunnery</a> in the <a href="Isle%20of%20Thanet">Isle of Thanet</a> and helped with the foundation of <a href="Medeshamstede">Medeshamstede</a> Abbey, later <a href="Peterborough%20Cathedral">Peterborough Abbey</a>, in 657. He was long overshadowed by <a href="Agilbert">Agilbert</a>, bishop to the West Saxons, and his authority as archbishop probably did not extend past his own diocese and that of <a href="Diocese%20of%20Rochester">Rochester</a>, which had traditionally been dependent on Canterbury.

The <a href="Synod%20of%20Whitby">Synod of Whitby</a>, which debated whether the <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>n church should follow the Roman or the Celtic <a href="Computus">method of dating</a> <a href="Easter">Easter</a>, was held in 664. Deusdedit does not appear to have been present, perhaps because of an outbreak of the plague prevalent in England at the time.

Deusdedit died at some time around the Synod of Whitby, although the exact date is disputed. <a href="Bede">Bede</a>, in the "<a href="Historia%20ecclesiastica%20gentis%20Anglorum">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</a>", states that "On the fourteenth of July in the above mentioned year, when an eclipse was quickly followed by plague and during which Bishop <a href="Colm%C3%A1n%20of%20Lindisfarne">Colman</a> was refuted by the unanimous decision of the Catholics and returned to his own country, Deusdedit the sixth Archbishop of Canterbury died." A solar eclipse occurred on 1 May 664, which would appear to make the date of Deusdedit's death 14 July 664. But that conflicts with Bede's own information earlier in the "Historia", where he claims that Deusdedit's predecessor, <a href="Honorius%20of%20Canterbury">Honorius</a>, "died on the 30th of September 653, and after a vacancy of 18 months, Deusdedit, a West Saxon was elected to the archiepiscopal see and became the 6th Archbishop. He was consecrated by Ithamar, Bishop of Rochester, on the 26th of May, and ruled the see until his death nine years, four months, and two days later." If this information is accurate, then Deusdedit must have died on 28 July 664. Various methods of reconciling these discrepancies have been proposed. <a href="Frank%20Stenton">Frank Stenton</a> argues that Bede began his years on 1 September; thus the date of Honorius' death should be considered 30 September 652 in modern reckoning. Further, Stenton argued that medieval copyists had introduced an error into the manuscripts of the "Historia", and that Bede meant that the length of Deusdedit's reign was 9 years and 7 months, rather than 9 years and 4 months as stated in the manuscripts. From this, he concludes that Deusdedit's death occurred in the year September 663 to September 664. This would make the year of death correct according to the eclipse, but still leave a discrepancy on the specific day of death, for which Stenton asserted the length calculations given by Bede were more correct than the actual death date given. Thus Stenton concluded that Deusdedit died on 28 October 663.

Other historians, including Richard Abels, P. Grosjean, and Alan Thacker, state that Deusdedit died on 14 July 664. The main argument was put forward by Grosjean, who claimed that Bede had the consecration date wrong, as 26 May was <a href="Maundy%20Thursday">Maundy Thursday</a> in 655, not a date that would normally have been chosen for a consecration. Grosjean argues that the best method for resolving the conflicts is to just take 14 July 664 as the date of death, and figure backwards with the length of reign given by Bede, which gives a consecration date of 12 March 655. Thacker and Abels agree generally, although Thacker does not give a specific consecration date beyond March. Abels adds to Grosjean's arguments Bede's association of Deusdedit's death with that of King Eorcenberht, which Bede gives as occurring on the same day. Bede states that the plague of 664 began soon after the eclipse on 1 May. Nothing in Bede contradicts the date of 14 July 664 for Eorcenberht; therefore, Abels considers that date to be the best fit for the available data. The historian D. P. Kirby agrees that Deusdedit died in 664, although he does not give a precise date within that year.

Most historians state that Deusdedit died of the plague that was prevalent in England at the time. Because Bede records the death of Deusdedit shortly after he mentions the outbreak of the plague, the historian <a href="John%20Maddicott">J. R. Maddicott</a> asserts that both Deusdedit and Eorcenberht were struck suddenly with the disease and died quickly. Bede is not specific on the type of plague, but Maddicott argues that because of the time of its eruption and the way it arrived in England it was probably <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a>. Although Bede does not describe either Eorcenberht or Deusdedit's symptoms he does discuss another victim of the 664 disease, who suffered from a tumour on his thigh, resembling the characteristic groin swellings of bubonic plague.

Except for the bare facts of his life, little is known about Deusdedit. Deusdedit's successor as Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="Wighard">Wighard</a>, had been one of his clergy. Deusdedit was regarded as a saint after his death, with a feast day of 14 July, although the <a href="Bosworth%20Psalter">Bosworth Psalter</a>, a late 10th or early 11th-century <a href="psalter">psalter</a> produced at , gives a date of 15 July. His feast day is designated as a major feast day, and is included along with those of a number of other early Canterbury archbishops in the Bosworth Psalter. Deusdedit was buried in the church of St Augustine's in Canterbury, but was <a href="translation%20%28relic%29">translated</a> to the new abbey church in 1091. A <a href="hagiography">hagiography</a>, or saint's biography, on Deusdedit was written by Goscelin after the translation of his relics, but the work was based mainly on Bede's account; the manuscript of the "De Sancto Deusdedit Archiepiscopo" survives as part of <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a> manuscript (ms) <a href="Cotton%20library">Cotton</a> Vespasian B.xx. Because of the late date of the "Sancto", Bede's "Historia" is the main source for what little is known about Deusdedit. Other than the hagiography, there is scant evidence of a cult surrounding him. His shrine survived until the <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20monasteries">dissolution of the monasteries</a> in the 1530s.

<doc id="592039" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=592039" title="Rosewood massacre">
Rosewood massacre

The Rosewood massacre was a racially motivated <a href="massacre">massacre</a> of black people and destruction of a black town that took place during the first week of January 1923 in rural <a href="Levy%20County%2C%20Florida">Levy County, Florida</a>. At least six black people and two white people were killed, though eyewitness accounts suggested a death toll as high as 150. The town of <a href="Rosewood%2C%20Florida">Rosewood</a> was destroyed, in what contemporary news reports characterized as a <a href="Mass%20racial%20violence%20in%20the%20United%20States">race riot</a>. Racial disturbances were common during the early 20th century in the United States, reflecting the nation's rapid social changes. Florida had an especially high number of <a href="lynching">lynching</a>s of black males in the years before the massacre, including a well-publicized incident in December 1922.

Before the massacre, the town of Rosewood had been a quiet, primarily black, self-sufficient <a href="whistle%20stop">whistle stop</a> on the <a href="Seaboard%20Air%20Line%20Railway">Seaboard Air Line Railway</a>. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of unsupported accusations that a white woman in nearby <a href="Sumner%2C%20Florida">Sumner</a> had been beaten and possibly raped by a black drifter. When the town's black citizens rallied together to defend themselves against further attacks, a mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for black people, and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. Survivors from the town hid for several days in nearby swamps until they were evacuated by train and car to larger towns. No arrests were made for what happened in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by its former black and white residents; none ever moved back, and the town ceased to exist.

Although the rioting was widely reported around the United States at the time, few official records documented the event. Survivors, their descendants, and the perpetrators remained silent about Rosewood for decades. Sixty years after the rioting, the story of Rosewood was revived in major media when several journalists covered it in the early 1980s. Survivors and their descendants organized to sue the state for having failed to protect Rosewood's black community. In 1993, the Florida Legislature commissioned a report on the incident. As a result of the findings, Florida became the first U.S. state to compensate survivors and their descendants for damages incurred because of racial violence. The incident was the subject of <a href="Rosewood%20%28film%29">a 1997 feature film</a> directed by <a href="John%20Singleton">John Singleton</a>. In 2004, the state designated the site of Rosewood as a <a href="Florida%20Heritage%20Landmark">Florida Heritage Landmark</a>. 

Officially, the recorded death toll of the first week of January 1923 was eight (six black and two white). Historians disagree about this number. Some survivors' stories claim there may have been up to 27 black residents killed, and assert that newspapers did not report the total number of white deaths. Minnie Lee Langley, who was in the Carrier house siege, recalls that she stepped over many white bodies on the porch when she left the house. A newspaper article in 1984 stated that reports of up to 150 victims may have been exaggerations. Several eyewitnesses claim to have seen a mass grave filled with black people; one remembers a plow brought from Cedar Key that covered 26 bodies. However, by the time authorities investigated these claims, most of the witnesses were dead or too elderly and infirm to lead them to a site to confirm the stories.

Rosewood was settled in 1845, nine miles (14 km) east of <a href="Cedar%20Key%2C%20Florida">Cedar Key</a>, near the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. Most of the local economy drew on the timber industry; the name Rosewood refers to the reddish color of cut <a href="Eastern%20Red%20Cedar">cedar</a> wood. Two pencil mills were founded nearby in Cedar Key; local residents also worked in several <a href="turpentine">turpentine</a> mills and a sawmill three miles (4.8 km) away in <a href="Sumner%2C%20Florida">Sumner</a>, in addition to farming of citrus and cotton. The hamlet grew enough to warrant the construction of a post office and train depot on the <a href="Florida%20Railroad">Florida Railroad</a> in 1870, but it was never incorporated as a town.

Initially, Rosewood had both black and white settlers. When most of the cedar trees in the area had been cut by 1890, the pencil mills closed, and many white residents moved to Sumner. By 1900, the population in Rosewood had become predominantly black. The village of Sumner was predominantly white, and relations between the two communities were relatively amicable. Two black families in Rosewood named Goins and Carrier were the most powerful. The Goins family brought the turpentine industry to the area, and in the years preceding the attacks were the second largest landowners in Levy County. To avoid lawsuits from white competitors, the Goins brothers moved to <a href="Gainesville%2C%20Florida">Gainesville</a>, and the population of Rosewood decreased slightly. The Carriers were also a large family, primarily working at logging in the region. By the 1920s, almost everyone in the close-knit community was distantly related to each other. The population of Rosewood peaked in 1915 at 355 people. Florida had effectively <a href="Disenfranchisement%20after%20the%20Reconstruction%20Era">disenfranchised</a> black voters since the start of the 20th century by high requirements for voter registration; both Sumner and Rosewood were part of a single voting precinct counted by the <a href="U.S.%20Census">U.S. Census</a>. In 1920, the combined population of both towns was 638 (344 black and 294 white).

As was common in the late 19th century South, Florida had imposed legal <a href="racial%20segregation">racial segregation</a> under <a href="Jim%20Crow%20laws">Jim Crow laws</a> requiring separate black and white public facilities and transportation. Black and white residents created their own community centers: by 1920, the residents of Rosewood were mostly self-sufficient. They had three churches, a school, a large <a href="Freemasonry">Masonic Hall</a>, a turpentine mill, a <a href="sugarcane">sugarcane</a> mill, a baseball team named the Rosewood Stars, and two general stores, one of which was white-owned. The village had about a dozen two-story wooden plank homes, other small two-room houses, and several small unoccupied plank farm and storage structures. Some families owned pianos, organs, and other symbols of middle-class prosperity. Survivors of Rosewood remember it as a happy place. In 1995, survivor Robie Mortin recalled at age 79 that when she was a child there, that "Rosewood was a town where everyone's house was painted. There were roses everywhere you walked. Lovely."

Racial violence at the time was common throughout the nation, manifested as individual incidents of extra-legal actions, or attacks on entire communities. <a href="Lynchings">Lynchings</a> reached a peak around the start of the 20th century as southern states were disenfranchising black voters and imposing white supremacy; white supremacists used it as a means of social control throughout the South. In 1866 Florida, as did many Southern states, passed laws called <a href="Black%20Codes%20%28United%20States%29">Black Codes</a> disenfranchising black citizens. Although these were quickly overturned, and black citizens enjoyed a brief period of improved social standing, by the late 19th century black political influence was virtually nil. The white Democrat-dominated legislature passed a <a href="Poll%20tax%20%28United%20States%29">poll tax</a> in 1885, which largely served to disenfranchise all poor voters. Losing political power, black voters suffered a deterioration of their legal and political rights in the years following. Without the right to vote, they were excluded as jurors and could not run for office, effectively excluding them from the political process. The United States as a whole was experiencing rapid social changes: an influx of European immigrants, industrialization and the growth of cities, and political experimentation in <a href="Northern%20United%20States">the North</a>. In <a href="Southern%20United%20States">the South</a>, black Americans grew increasingly dissatisfied with their lack of economic opportunity and status as second-class citizens.
Elected officials in Florida represented the voting white majority. Governor <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte%20Broward">Napoleon Bonaparte Broward</a> (1905–1909) suggested finding a location out of state for black people to live separately. Tens of thousands of people moved to the North during and after <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in the <a href="Great%20Migration%20%28African%20American%29">Great Migration</a>, unsettling labor markets and introducing more rapid changes into cities. They were recruited by many expanding northern industries, such as the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a>, the steel industry, and meatpacking. Florida governors <a href="Park%20Trammell">Park Trammell</a> (1913–1917) and <a href="Sidney%20Catts">Sidney Catts</a> (1917–1921) generally ignored the emigration of blacks to the North and its causes. While Trammell was state <a href="attorney%20general">attorney general</a>, none of the 29 lynchings committed during his term were prosecuted, nor were any of the 21 that occurred while he was governor. Catts ran on a platform of <a href="white%20supremacy">white supremacy</a> and anti-Catholic sentiment; he openly criticized the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP) when they complained he did nothing to investigate two lynchings in Florida. Catts changed his message when the turpentine and lumber industries claimed labor was scarce; he began to plead with black workers to stay in the state. By 1940, 40,000 black people had left Florida to find employment, but also to escape the oppression of segregation, underfunded education and facilities, violence, and disenfranchisement.

When U.S. troop training began for World War I, many white Southerners were alarmed at the thought of arming black soldiers. A confrontation regarding the rights of black soldiers culminated in the <a href="Houston%20Riot%20%281917%29">Houston Riot of 1917</a>. German <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> encouraged black soldiers to turn against their "real" enemies: American whites. Rumors reached the U.S. that French women had been sexually active with black American soldiers, which <a href="University%20of%20Florida">University of Florida</a> historian David Colburn argues struck at the heart of Southern fears about power and miscegenation. Colburn connects growing concerns of sexual intimacy between the races to what occurred in Rosewood: "Southern culture had been constructed around a set of mores and values which places white women at its center and in which the purity of their conduct and their manners represented the refinement of that culture. An attack on women not only represented a violation of the South's foremost taboo, but it also threatened to dismantle the very nature of southern society." The transgression of <a href="miscegenation">sexual taboos</a> subsequently combined with the arming of black citizens to raise fears among whites of an impending race war in the South.

The influx of black people into urban centers in the North and Midwest increased racial tensions in those cities. Between 1917 and 1923, racial disturbances erupted in numerous cities throughout the U.S., motivated by economic competition between different racial groups for industrial jobs. One of the first and most violent instances was a <a href="East%20St.%20Louis%20Riot">riot in East St. Louis</a>, sparked in 1917. In the <a href="Red%20Summer%20of%201919">Red Summer of 1919</a>, racially motivated mob violence erupted in 23 cities—including <a href="Chicago%20Race%20Riot%20of%201919">Chicago</a>, <a href="Omaha%20Race%20Riot%20of%201919">Omaha</a>, and <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>—caused by competition for jobs and housing by returning World War I veterans of both races, and the arrival of waves of new European immigrants. Further unrest occurred in <a href="Tulsa%20race%20riot">Tulsa in 1921</a>, when whites attacked the black Greenwood community. David Colburn distinguishes two types of violence against black people up to 1923: Northern violence was generally spontaneous mob action against entire communities. Southern violence, on the other hand, took the form of individual incidents of lynchings and other extrajudicial actions. The Rosewood massacre, according to Colburn, resembled violence more commonly perpetrated in the North in those years.
In the mid-1920s, the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> (KKK) reached its peak membership in the South and Midwest after a revival beginning around 1915. Its growth was due in part to tensions from rapid industrialization and social change in many growing cities; in the Midwest and West, its growth was related to the competition of waves of new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. The KKK was strong in the Florida cities of <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville</a> and <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa</a>; <a href="Miami%2C%20Florida">Miami</a>'s chapter was influential enough to hold initiations at the Miami Country Club. The Klan also flourished in smaller towns of the South where racial violence had a long tradition dating back to the <a href="Reconstruction%20era">Reconstruction era</a>. An editor of "<a href="The%20Gainesville%20Sun">The Gainesville Daily Sun</a>" admitted that he was a member of the Klan in 1922, and praised the organization in print.

Despite Governor Catts' change of attitude, white mob action frequently occurred in towns throughout north and central Florida and went unchecked by local law enforcement. Extrajudicial violence against black residents was so common that it seldom was covered by newspapers. In 1920, whites removed four black men from jail, who were suspects accused of raping a white woman in <a href="Macclenny%2C%20Florida">Macclenny</a>, and lynched them. In <a href="Ocoee%2C%20Florida">Ocoee</a> the same year, two black citizens armed themselves to go to the polls during an election. A confrontation ensued and two white election officials were shot, after which a white mob destroyed Ocoee's black community, causing as many as 30 deaths, and destroying 25 homes, two churches, and a Masonic Lodge. Just weeks before the Rosewood massacre, the <a href="Perry%20Race%20Riot">Perry Race Riot</a> occurred on 14 and 15 December 1922, in which whites burned Charles Wright at the stake and attacked the black community of <a href="Perry%2C%20Florida">Perry, Florida</a> after a white schoolteacher was murdered. On the day following Wright's lynching, whites shot and hanged two more black men in Perry; next they burned the town's black school, <a href="Masonic%20lodge">Masonic lodge</a>, church, amusement hall, and several families' homes.

The Rosewood massacre occurred after a white woman in Sumner claimed she had been assaulted by a black man. Frances "Fannie" Taylor was 22 years old in 1923 and married to James, a 30-year-old <a href="millwright">millwright</a> employed by Cummer & Sons in Sumner. They lived there with their two young children. James' job required him to leave each day during the darkness of early morning. Neighbors remembered Fannie Taylor as "very peculiar". She was meticulously clean, scrubbing her cedar floors with bleach so that they shone white. Other women attested that Taylor was aloof; no one knew her very well.

On January 1, 1923, the Taylors' neighbor reported that she heard a scream while it was still dark, grabbed her revolver and ran next door to find Fannie bruised and beaten, with scuff marks across the white floor. Taylor was screaming that someone needed to get her baby. She said a black man was in her house; he had come through the back door and assaulted her. The neighbor found the baby, but no one else. Taylor's initial report stated her assailant beat her about the face but did not <a href="rape">rape</a> her. Rumors circulated—widely believed by whites in Sumner—that she was both raped and robbed. The charge of rape of a white woman by a black was inflammatory in the South: the day before, the Klan had held a parade and rally of over 100 hooded Klansmen away in <a href="Gainesville%2C%20Florida">Gainesville</a> under a <a href="burning%20cross">burning cross</a> and a banner reading, "First and Always Protect Womanhood".
The neighbor also reported the absence that day of Taylor's laundress, Sarah Carrier, whom the white women in Sumner called "Aunt Sarah". Philomena Goins, Carrier's granddaughter, told a different story about Fannie Taylor many years later. She joined her grandmother Carrier at Taylor's home as usual that morning. They watched a white man leave by the back door later in the morning before noon. She said Taylor did emerge from her home showing evidence of having been beaten, but it was well after morning. Carrier's grandson and Philomena's brother, Arnett Goins, sometimes went with them; he had seen the white man before. His name was John Bradley and he worked for the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Carrier told others in the black community what she had seen that day; the black community of Rosewood understood that Fannie Taylor had a white lover, they got into a fight that day, and he beat her. When the man left Taylor's house, he went to Rosewood.

Quickly, Levy County Sheriff Robert Elias Walker raised a <a href="Posse%20comitatus%20%28common%20law%29">posse</a> and started an investigation. When they learned that Jesse Hunter, a black prisoner, had escaped from a <a href="chain%20gang">chain gang</a>, they began a search to question him about Taylor's attack. Men arrived from Cedar Key, <a href="Otter%20Creek%2C%20Florida">Otter Creek</a>, <a href="Chiefland%2C%20Florida">Chiefland</a>, and <a href="Bronson%2C%20Florida">Bronson</a> to help with the search. Adding confusion to the events recounted later, as many as 400 white men began to gather. Sheriff Walker <a href="Deputy%20sheriff">deputize</a>d some of them, but was unable to initiate them all. Walker asked for dogs from a nearby convict camp, but one dog may have been used by a group of men acting without Walker's authority. Dogs led a group of about 100 to 150 men to the home of Aaron Carrier, Sarah's nephew. Aaron was taken outside, where his mother begged the men not to kill him. He was tied to a car and dragged to Sumner. Sheriff Walker put Carrier in protective custody at the county seat in Bronson to remove him from the men in the posse, many of whom were drinking and acting on their own authority. Worried that the group would quickly grow further out of control, Walker also urged black employees to stay at the turpentine mills for their own safety.

A group of white <a href="vigilantes">vigilantes</a>, who had become a mob by this time, seized Sam Carter, a local blacksmith and teamster who worked in a turpentine still. They tortured Carter into admitting that he had hidden the escaped chain gang prisoner. Carter led the group to the spot in the woods where he said he had taken Hunter, but the dogs were unable to pick up a scent. To the surprise of many witnesses, someone fatally shot Carter in the face. The group hung Carter's mutilated body from a tree as a symbol to other black men in the area. Some in the mob took souvenirs of his clothes. Survivors suggest that John Bradley fled to Rosewood because he knew he was in trouble and had gone to the home of Aaron Carrier, a fellow veteran and <a href="Freemasonry">Mason</a>. Carrier and Carter, another Mason, covered Bradley in the back of a wagon. Carter took Bradley to a nearby river, let him out of the wagon, then returned home to be met by the mob; they had reached him led by dogs following Bradley's scent.

After lynching Sam Carter, the mob met Sylvester Carrier—Aaron's cousin and Sarah's son—on a road and told him to get out of town. Carrier refused, and when the mob moved on, he suggested gathering as many people as possible for protection.

Despite the efforts of Sheriff Walker and mill supervisor W. H. Pillsbury to disperse the mobs, white men continued to gather. On the evening of January 4, a mob of armed white men went to Rosewood and surrounded the house of Sarah Carrier. It was filled with approximately 15 to 25 people seeking refuge, including many children hiding upstairs under mattresses. Some of the children were in the house because they were visiting their grandmother for Christmas. They were protected by Sylvester Carrier and possibly two other men, but Carrier may have been the only one armed. He had a reputation of being proud and independent. In Rosewood, he was a formidable character, a crack shot, expert hunter, and music teacher, who was simply called "Man". Many whites considered him arrogant and disrespectful.

Sylvester Carrier was reported in the "New York Times" saying that the attack on Fannie Taylor was an "example of what negroes could do without interference". Whether or not he said this is debated, but a group of 20 to 30 white men, inflamed by the reported statement, went to the Carrier house. They believed that the black community in Rosewood was hiding escaped prisoner Jesse Hunter.

Reports conflict about who shot first, but after two members of the mob approached the house, someone opened fire. Sarah Carrier was shot in the head. Her nine-year-old niece at the house, Minnie Lee Langley, had witnessed Aaron Carrier taken from his house three days earlier. When Langley heard someone had been shot, she went downstairs to find her grandmother, Emma Carrier. Sylvester placed Minnie Lee in a firewood closet in front of him as he watched the front door, using the closet for cover: "He got behind me in the wood [bin], and he put the gun on my shoulder, and them <a href="Cracker%20%28pejorative%29">cracker</a>s was still shooting and going on. He put his gun on my shoulder ... told me to lean this way, and then Poly Wilkerson, he kicked the door down. When he kicked the door down, Cuz' Syl let him have it."

Several shots were exchanged: the house was riddled with bullets, but the whites did not overtake it. The standoff lasted long into the next morning, when Sarah and Sylvester Carrier were found dead inside the house; several others were wounded, including a child who had been shot in the eye. Two white men, C. P. "Poly" Wilkerson and Henry Andrews, were killed; Wilkerson had kicked in the front door, and Andrews was behind him. At least four whites were wounded, one possibly fatally. The remaining children in the Carrier house were spirited out the back door into the woods. They crossed dirt roads one at a time, then hid under brush until they had all gathered away from Rosewood.

News of the armed standoff at the Carrier house attracted white men from all over the state to take part. Reports were carried in the "<a href="St.%20Petersburg%20Independent">St. Petersburg Independent</a>", the "<a href="Florida%20Times-Union">Florida Times-Union</a>", the "<a href="Miami%20Herald">Miami Herald</a>", and "<a href="The%20Miami%20Metropolis">The Miami Metropolis</a>", in versions of competing facts and overstatement. The "Miami Metropolis" listed 20 black people and four white people dead and characterized the event as a "race war". National newspapers also put the incident on the front page. The "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" and "<a href="St.%20Louis%20Post-Dispatch">St. Louis Dispatch</a>" described a band of "heavily armed Negroes" and a "negro desperado" as being involved. Most of the information came from discrete messages from Sheriff Walker, mob rumors, and other embellishments to part-time reporters who wired their stories to the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a>. Details about the armed standoff were particularly explosive. According to historian Thomas Dye, "The idea that blacks in Rosewood had taken up arms against the white race was unthinkable in the Deep South".

Black newspapers covered the events from a different angle. The "<a href="Afro-American%20%28newspaper%29">Afro-American</a>" in Baltimore highlighted the acts of African-American heroism against the onslaught of "savages". Another newspaper reported: "Two Negro women were attacked and raped between Rosewood and Sumner. The sexual lust of the brutal white mobbists satisfied, the women were strangled."

The white mob burned black churches in Rosewood. Philomena Goins' cousin, Lee Ruth Davis, heard the bells tolling in the church as the men were inside setting it on fire. The mob also destroyed the white church in Rosewood. Many black residents fled for safety into the nearby swamps, some clothed only in their pajamas. Wilson Hall was nine years old at the time; he later recounted his mother waking him to escape into the swamps early in the morning when it was still dark; the lights from approaching cars of white men could be seen for miles. The Hall family walked through swampland to the town of <a href="Gulf%20Hammock%2C%20Florida">Gulf Hammock</a>. The survivors recall that it was uncharacteristically cold for Florida, and people suffered when they spent several nights in raised wooded areas called <a href="hammock%20%28ecology%29">hammocks</a> to evade the mob. Some took refuge with sympathetic white families. Sam Carter's 69-year-old widow hid for two days in the swamps, then was driven by a sympathetic white mail carrier, under bags of mail, to join her family in Chiefland.

White men began surrounding houses, pouring <a href="kerosene">kerosene</a> on and lighting them, then shooting at those who emerged. Lexie Gordon, a light-skinned 50-year-old woman who was ill with <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>, had sent her children into the woods. She was killed by a shotgun blast to the face when she fled from hiding underneath her home, which had been set on fire by the mob. Fannie Taylor's brother-in-law claimed to be her killer. On January 5, more whites converged on the area, forming a mob of between 200 and 300 people. Some came from out of state. Mingo Williams, who was away near Bronson, was collecting turpentine sap by the side of the road when a car full of whites stopped and asked his name. As was custom among many residents of Levy County, both black and white, Williams used a nickname that was more prominent than his given name; when he gave his nickname of "Lord God", they shot him dead.

Sheriff Walker pleaded with news reporters covering the violence to send a message to the <a href="Alachua%20County">Alachua County</a> Sheriff P. G. Ramsey to send assistance. Carloads of men came from Gainesville to assist Walker; many of them had probably participated in the Klan rally earlier in the week. W. H. Pillsbury tried desperately to keep black workers in the Sumner mill, and worked with his assistant, a man named Johnson, to dissuade the white workers from joining others using extra-legal violence. Armed guards sent by Sheriff Walker turned away black people who emerged from the swamps and tried to go home. W. H. Pillsbury's wife secretly helped smuggle people out of the area. Several white men declined to join the mobs, including the town barber who also refused to lend his gun to anyone. He said he did not want his "hands wet with blood".

Governor <a href="Cary%20Hardee">Cary Hardee</a> was on standby, ready to order <a href="National%20Guard%20%28United%20States%29">National Guard</a> troops in to neutralize the situation. Despite his message to the sheriff of Alachua County, Walker informed Hardee by telegram that he did not fear "further disorder" and urged the governor not to intervene. The governor's office monitored the situation, in part because of intense Northern interest, but Hardee would not activate the National Guard without Walker's request. Walker insisted he could handle the situation; records show that Governor Hardee took Sheriff Walker's word and went on a hunting trip.

James Carrier, Sylvester's brother and Sarah's son, had previously suffered a stroke and was partially paralyzed. He left the swamps and returned to Rosewood. He asked W. H. Pillsbury, the white turpentine mill supervisor, for protection; Pillsbury locked him in a house but the mob found Carrier, and tortured him to find out if he had aided Jesse Hunter, the escaped convict. After they made Carrier dig his own grave, they fatally shot him.

On January 6, white train conductors John and William Bryce managed the evacuation of some black residents to Gainesville. The brothers were independently wealthy Cedar Key residents who had an affinity for trains. They knew the people in Rosewood and had traded with them regularly. As they passed the area, the Bryces slowed their train and blew the horn, picking up women and children. Fearing reprisals from mobs, they refused to pick up any black men. Many survivors boarded the train after having been hidden by white general store owner John Wright and his wife, Mary Jo. Over the next several days, other Rosewood residents fled to Wright's house, facilitated by Sheriff Walker, who asked Wright to transport as many residents out of town as possible.

Lee Ruth Davis, her sister, and two brothers were hidden by the Wrights while their father hid in the woods. On the morning of Poly Wilkerson's funeral, the Wrights left the children alone to attend. Davis and her siblings crept out of the house to hide with relatives in the nearby town of Wylly, but they were turned back for being too dangerous. The children spent the day in the woods but decided to return to the Wrights' house. After spotting men with guns on their way back, they crept back to the Wrights, who were frantic with fear. Davis later described the experience: "I was laying that deep in water, that is where we sat all day long ... We got on our bellies and crawled. We tried to keep people from seeing us through the bushes ... We were trying to get back to Mr. Wright house. After we got all the way to his house, Mr. and Mrs. Wright were all the way out in the bushes hollering and calling us, and when we answered, they were so glad." Several other white residents of Sumner hid black residents of Rosewood and smuggled them out of town. Gainesville's black community took in many of Rosewood's evacuees, waiting for them at the train station and greeting survivors as they disembarked, covered in sheets. On Sunday, January 7, a mob of 100 to 150 whites returned to burn the remaining dozen or so structures of Rosewood.

Many people were alarmed by the violence, and state leaders feared negative effects on the state's tourist industry. Governor Cary Hardee appointed a special grand jury and special prosecuting attorney to investigate the outbreak in Rosewood and other incidents in Levy County. In February 1923, the all-white <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> convened in Bronson. Over several days, they heard 25 witnesses, eight of whom were black, but found insufficient evidence to prosecute any perpetrators. The judge presiding over the case deplored the actions of the mob.

By the end of the week, Rosewood no longer made the front pages of major white newspapers. The "<a href="Chicago%20Defender">Chicago Defender</a>", the most influential black newspaper in the U.S., reported that 19 people in Rosewood's "race war" had died, and a soldier named Ted Cole appeared to fight the lynch mobs, then disappeared; no confirmation of his existence after this report exists. A few editorials appeared in Florida newspapers summarizing the event. "The Gainesville Daily Sun" justified the actions of whites involved, writing "Let it be understood now and forever that he, whether white or black, who brutally assaults an innocent and helpless woman, shall die the death of a dog." The "Tampa Tribune", in a rare comment on the excesses of whites in the area, called it "a foul and lasting blot on the people of Levy County".

Northern publications were more willing to note the breakdown of law, but many attributed it to the backward mindset in the South. The "<a href="New%20York%20Call">New York Call</a>," a socialist newspaper, remarked "how astonishingly little cultural progress has been made in some parts of the world", while the "<a href="Nashville%20Banner">Nashville Banner</a>" compared the events in Rosewood to recent race riots in Northern cities, but characterized the entire event as "deplorable". A three-day conference in Atlanta organized by the <a href="Southern%20Methodist%20Church">Southern Methodist Church</a> released a statement that similarly condemned the chaotic week in Rosewood. It concluded, "No family and no race rises higher than womanhood. Hence, the intelligence of women must be cultivated and the purity and dignity of womanhood must be protected by the maintenance of a single standard of morals for both races."

Officially, the recorded death toll of the first week of January 1923 was eight people (six black and two white). Historians disagree about this number. Some survivors' stories claim there may have been up to 27 black residents killed, and assert that newspapers did not report the total number of white deaths. Minnie Lee Langley, who was in the Carrier house siege, recalls that she stepped over many white bodies on the porch when she left the house. Several eyewitnesses claim to have seen a mass grave filled with black people; one remembers a plow brought from Cedar Key that covered 26 bodies. However, by the time authorities investigated these claims, most of the witnesses were dead, or too elderly and infirm to lead them to a site to confirm the stories.

Aaron Carrier was held in jail for several months in early 1923; he died in 1965. James Carrier's widow Emma was shot in the hand and the wrist and reached Gainesville by train. She never recovered, and died in 1924. Sarah Carrier's husband Haywood did not see the events in Rosewood. He was on a hunting trip, and discovered when he returned that his wife, brother James, and son Sylvester had all been killed and his house destroyed by a white mob. Following the shock of learning what had happened in Rosewood, Haywood rarely spoke to anyone but himself; he sometimes wandered away from his family unclothed. His grandson, Arnett Goins, thought that he had been unhinged by grief. Haywood Carrier died a year after the massacre. Jesse Hunter, the escaped convict, was never found. Many survivors fled in different directions to other cities, and a few changed their names from fear that whites would track them down. None ever returned to live in Rosewood.

Fannie Taylor and her husband moved to another mill town. She was "very nervous" in her later years, until she succumbed to cancer. John Wright's house was the only structure left standing in Rosewood. He lived in it and acted as an emissary between the county and the survivors. After they left the town, almost all of their land was sold for taxes. Mary Jo Wright died around 1931; John developed a problem with alcohol. He was ostracized and taunted for assisting the survivors, and rumored to keep a gun in every room of his house. He died after drinking too much one night in Cedar Key, and was buried in an unmarked grave in Sumner. The sawmill in Sumner burned down in 1925, and the owners moved the operation to <a href="Lacoochee%2C%20Florida">Lacoochee</a> in <a href="Pasco%20County">Pasco County</a>. Some survivors as well as participants in the mob action went to Lacoochee to work in the mill there. W. H. Pillsbury was among them, and he was taunted by former Sumner residents. No longer having any supervisory authority, Pillsbury was retired early by the company. He moved to Jacksonville and died in 1926.

Despite nationwide news coverage in both white and black newspapers, the incident, and the small abandoned village, slipped into oblivion. Most of the survivors scattered around Florida cities and started over with nothing. Many, including children, took on odd jobs to make ends meet. Education had to be sacrificed to earn an income. As a result, most of the Rosewood survivors took on manual labor jobs, working as maids, shoe shiners, or in citrus factories or lumber mills.

Although the survivors' experiences after Rosewood were disparate, none publicly acknowledged what had happened. Robie Mortin, Sam Carter's niece, was seven years old when her father put her on a train to Chiefland, east of Rosewood, on January 3, 1923. Mortin's father avoided the heart of Rosewood on the way to the depot that day, a decision Mortin believes saved their lives. Mortin's father met them years later in <a href="Riviera%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Riviera Beach</a>, in South Florida. None of the family ever spoke about the events in Rosewood, on order from Mortin's grandmother: "She felt like maybe if somebody knew where we came from, they might come at us".

This silence was an exception to the practice of <a href="African%20American%20culture%23Oral%20tradition">oral history among black families</a>. Minnie Lee Langley knew James and Emma Carrier as her parents. She kept the story from her children for 60 years: "I didn't want them to know what I came through and I didn't discuss it with none of them ... I just didn't want them to know what kind of way I come up. I didn't want them to know white folks want us out of our homes." Decades passed before she began to trust white people. Some families spoke of Rosewood, but forbade the stories from being told: Arnett Doctor heard the story from his mother, Philomena Goins Doctor, who was with Sarah Carrier the day Fannie Taylor claimed she was assaulted, and was in the house with Sylvester Carrier. She told her children about Rosewood every Christmas. Doctor was consumed by his mother's story; he would bring it up to his aunts only to be dissuaded from speaking of it.

In 1982, an investigative reporter named Gary Moore from the "<a href="St.%20Petersburg%20Times">St. Petersburg Times</a>" drove from the Tampa area to Cedar Key looking for a story. When he commented to a local on the "gloomy atmosphere" of <a href="Cedar%20Key">Cedar Key</a>, and questioned why a Southern town was all-white when at the start of the 20th century it had been nearly half black, the local woman replied, "I know what you're digging for. You're trying to get me to talk about that massacre." Moore was hooked. He was able to convince Arnett Doctor to join him on a visit to the site, which he did without telling his mother. Moore addressed the disappearance of the incident from written or spoken history: "After a week of sensation, the weeks of January 1923 seem to have dropped completely from Florida's consciousness, like some unmentionable skeleton in the family closet".

When Philomena Goins Doctor found out what her son had done, she became enraged and threatened to disown him, shook him, then slapped him. A year later, Moore took the story to <a href="CBS">CBS</a>' "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>," and was the background reporter on a piece produced by Joel Bernstein and narrated by African-American journalist <a href="Ed%20Bradley">Ed Bradley</a>. Philomena Doctor called her family members and declared Moore's story and Bradley's television exposé were full of lies. A psychologist at the University of Florida later testified in state hearings that the survivors of Rosewood showed signs of <a href="posttraumatic%20stress%20disorder">posttraumatic stress disorder</a>, made worse by the secrecy. Many years after the incident, they exhibited fear, denial, and <a href="hypervigilance">hypervigilance</a> about socializing with whites—which they expressed specifically regarding their children, interspersed with bouts of apathy. Despite such characteristics, survivors counted religious faith as integral to their lives following the attack in Rosewood, to keep them from becoming bitter. Michael D'Orso, who wrote a book about Rosewood, said, "[E]veryone told me in their own way, in their own words, that if they allowed themselves to be bitter, to hate, it would have eaten them up." Robie Mortin described her past this way: "I knew that something went very wrong in my life because it took a lot away from me. But I wasn't angry or anything."

The legacy of Rosewood remained in Levy County. For decades no black residents lived in Cedar Key or Sumner. Robin Raftis, the white editor of the "Cedar Key Beacon", tried to place the events in an open forum by printing Moore's story. She had been collecting anecdotes for many years, and said, "Things happened out there in the woods. There's no doubt about that. How bad? We don't know ... So I said, 'Okay guys, I'm opening the closet with the skeletons, because if we don't learn from mistakes, we're doomed to repeat them'." Raftis received notes reading, "We know how to get you and your kids. All it takes is a match". 
University of Florida historian David Colburn stated, "There is a pattern of denial with the residents and their relatives about what took place, and in fact they said to us on several occasions they don't want to talk about it, they don't want to identify anyone involved, and there's also a tendency to say that those who were involved were from elsewhere."

In 1993, a black couple retired to Rosewood from Washington D.C. They told "The Washington Post", "When we used to have black friends down from Chiefland, they always wanted to leave before it got dark. They didn't want to be in Rosewood after dark. We always asked, but folks wouldn't say why."

Philomena Goins Doctor died in 1991. Her son Arnett was, by that time, "obsessed" with the events in Rosewood. Although he was originally excluded from the Rosewood claims case, he was included after this was revealed by publicity. By that point, the case had been taken on a "<a href="pro%20bono">pro bono</a>" basis by one of Florida's largest legal firms. In 1993, the firm filed a lawsuit on behalf of Arnett Goins, Minnie Lee Langley, and other survivors against the state government for its failure to protect them and their families.

Survivors participated in a publicity campaign to expand attention to the case. Langley and Lee Ruth Davis appeared on "<a href="The%20Maury%20Povich%20Show">The Maury Povich Show</a>" on <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Day">Martin Luther King Day</a> in 1993. Gary Moore published another article about Rosewood in the "Miami Herald" on March 7, 1993; he had to negotiate with the newspaper's editors for about a year to publish it. At first they were skeptical that the incident had taken place, and secondly, reporter Lori Rosza of the "Miami Herald" had reported on the first stage of what proved in December 1992 to be a deceptive claims case, with most of the survivors excluded. "If something like that really happened, we figured, it would be all over the history books", an editor wrote.

Arnett Doctor told the story of Rosewood to print and television reporters from all over the world. He raised the number of historic residents in Rosewood, as well as the number who died at the Carrier house siege; he exaggerated the town's contemporary importance by comparing it to <a href="Atlanta%2C%20Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a> as a cultural center. Doctor wanted to keep Rosewood in the news; his accounts were printed with few changes. According to historian Thomas Dye, Doctor's "forceful addresses to groups across the state, including the NAACP, together with his many articulate and heart-rending television appearances, placed intense pressure on the legislature ... to do something about Rosewood". In December 1996, Doctor told a meeting at Jacksonville Beach that 30 women and children had been buried alive at Rosewood, and that his facts had been confirmed by journalist Gary Moore. He was embarrassed to learn that Moore was in the audience. As the <a href="Holland%20%26amp%3B%20Knight">Holland & Knight</a> law firm continued the claims case, they represented 13 survivors, people who had lived in Rosewood at the time of the 1923 violence, in the claim to the legislature.

The lawsuit missed the filing deadline of January 1, 1993. The speaker of the <a href="Florida%20House%20of%20Representatives">Florida House of Representatives</a> commissioned a group to research and provide a report by which the equitable claim bill could be evaluated. It took them nearly a year to do the research, including interviews, and writing. On December 22, 1993, historians from <a href="Florida%20State%20University">Florida State University</a>, <a href="Florida%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">Florida A&M University</a>, and the <a href="University%20of%20Florida">University of Florida</a> delivered a 100-page report (with 400 pages of attached documentation) on the Rosewood massacre. It was based on available primary documents, and interviews mostly with black survivors of the incident. Due to the media attention received by residents of Cedar Key and Sumner following filing of the claim by survivors, white participants were discouraged from offering interviews to the historians. The report used a taped description of the events by Jason McElveen, a Cedar Key resident who had since died, and an interview with Ernest Parham, who was in high school in 1923 and happened upon the lynching of Sam Carter. Parham said he had never spoken of the incident because he was never asked. The report was titled "Documented History of the Incident which Occurred at Rosewood, Florida in January 1923". Gary Moore, the investigative journalist who wrote the 1982 story in "The St. Petersburg Times" that reopened the Rosewood case, criticized demonstrable errors in the report. The commissioned group retracted the most serious of these, without public discussion. They delivered the final report to the <a href="Florida%20Board%20of%20Regents">Florida Board of Regents</a> and it became part of the legislative record.

Florida's consideration of a bill to compensate victims of racial violence was the first by any U.S. state. Opponents argued that the bill set a dangerous precedent and put the onus of paying survivors and descendants on Floridians who had nothing to do with the incident in Rosewood. James Peters, who represented the State of Florida, argued that the <a href="statute%20of%20limitation">statute of limitation</a>s applied because the law enforcement officials named in the lawsuit—Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee—had died many years before. He also called into question the shortcomings of the report: although the historians were instructed not to write it with compensation in mind, they offered conclusions about the actions of Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee. The report was based on investigations led by historians as opposed to legal experts; they relied in cases on information that was <a href="hearsay">hearsay</a> from witnesses who had since died. Critics thought that some of the report's writers asked <a href="leading%20question">leading question</a>s in their interviews.

Even legislators who agreed with the sentiment of the bill asserted that the events in Rosewood were typical of the era. One survivor interviewed by Gary Moore said that to single out Rosewood as an exception, as if the entire world was not a Rosewood, would be "vile". Florida Representatives Al Lawson and Miguel De Grandy argued that, unlike Native Americans or slaves who had suffered atrocities at the hands of whites, the residents of Rosewood were tax-paying, self-sufficient citizens who deserved the protection of local and state law enforcement. While mob lynchings of black people around the same time tended to be spontaneous and quickly concluded, the incident at Rosewood was prolonged over a period of several days. Some legislators began to receive hate mail, including some claiming to be from Ku Klux Klan members. One legislator remarked that his office received an unprecedented response to the bill, with a proportion of ten constituents to one opposing it.

In 1994, the state legislature held a hearing to discuss the merits of the bill. Lee Ruth Davis died a few months before testimony began, but Minnie Lee Langley, Arnett Goins, Wilson Hall, Willie Evans, and several descendants from Rosewood testified. Other witnesses were a clinical psychologist from the University of Florida, who testified that survivors had suffered post-traumatic stress, and experts who offered testimony about the scale of property damages. Langley spoke first; the hearing room was packed with journalists and onlookers who were reportedly mesmerized by her statement. Ernest Parham also testified about what he saw. When asked specifically when he was contacted by law enforcement regarding the death of Sam Carter, Parham replied that he had been contacted for the first time on Carter's death two weeks before testifying. The coroner's inquest for Sam Carter had taken place the day after he was shot in January 1923; he concluded that Carter had been killed "by Unknown Party".

After hearing all the evidence, the <a href="Special%20Master">Special Master</a> Richard Hixson, who presided over the testimony for the Florida Legislature, declared that the state had a "moral obligation" to make restitution to the former residents of Rosewood. He said, "I truly don't think they cared about compensation. I think they simply wanted the truth to be known about what happened to them ... whether they got fifty cents or a hundred and fifty million dollars. It didn't matter."

Black and Hispanic legislators in Florida took on the Rosewood compensation bill as a cause, and refused to support Governor <a href="Lawton%20Chiles">Lawton Chiles</a>' healthcare plan until he put pressure on House Democrats to vote for the bill. Chiles was offended, as he had supported the compensation bill from its early days, and the legislative caucuses had previously promised their support for his healthcare plan. The legislature passed the bill, and Governor Chiles signed the Rosewood Compensation Bill, a $2.1 million package to compensate survivors and their descendants. Seven survivors and their family members were present at the signing to hear Chiles say, 
Because of the strength and commitment of these survivors and their families, the long silence has finally been broken and the shadow has been lifted ... Instead of being forgotten, because of their testimony, the Rosewood story is known across our state and across our nation. This legislation assures that the tragedy of Rosewood will never be forgotten by the generations to come.

Originally, the compensation total offered to survivors was $7 million, which aroused controversy. The legislature eventually settled on $1.5 million: this would enable payment of $150,000 to each person who could prove he or she lived in Rosewood during 1923, and provide a $500,000 pool for people who could apply for the funds after demonstrating that they had an ancestor who owned property in Rosewood during the same time. The four survivors who testified automatically qualified; four others had to apply. More than 400 applications were received from around the world.

Robie Mortin came forward as a survivor during this period; she was the only one added to the list who could prove that she had lived in Rosewood in 1923, totaling nine survivors who were compensated. Gaining compensation changed some families, whose members began to fight among themselves. Some descendants refused it, while others went into hiding in order to avoid the press of friends and relatives who asked them for <a href="handout">handout</a>s. Some descendants, after dividing the funds among their siblings, received not much more than $100 each. Later, the <a href="Florida%20Department%20of%20Education">Florida Department of Education</a> set up the Rosewood Family Scholarship Fund for Rosewood descendants and ethnic minorities.

The Rosewood massacre, the ensuing silence, and the compensation hearing were the subject of the 1996 book titled "Like Judgment Day: The Ruin and Redemption of a Town Called Rosewood" by <a href="Mike%20D%27Orso">Mike D'Orso</a>. It was a New York Times bestseller and won the <a href="Lillian%20Smith%20Book%20Award">Lillian Smith Book Award</a>, bestowed by the <a href="University%20of%20Georgia">University of Georgia</a> Libraries and the Southern Regional Council to authors who highlight racial and social inequality in their works.

The dramatic feature film "<a href="Rosewood%20%28film%29">Rosewood</a>" (1997), directed by <a href="John%20Singleton">John Singleton</a>, was based on these historic events. Minnie Lee Langley served as a source for the set designers, and Arnett Doctor was hired as a consultant. Recreated forms of the towns of Rosewood and Sumner were built in Central Florida, far away from Levy County. The film version, written by screenwriter <a href="Gregory%20Poirier">Gregory Poirier</a>, created a character named Mann, who enters Rosewood as a type of reluctant Western-style hero. Composites of historic figures were used as characters, and the film offers the possibility of a happy ending. In "The New York Times" <a href="E.R.%20Shipp">E.R. Shipp</a> suggests that Singleton's youth and his background in <a href="California">California</a> contributed to his willingness to take on the story of Rosewood. She notes Singleton's rejection of the image of black people as victims and the portrayal of "an idyllic past in which black families are intact, loving and prosperous, and a black superhero who changes the course of history when he escapes the noose, takes on the mob with double-barreled ferocity and saves many women and children from death". Singleton has offered his view: "I had a very deep—I wouldn't call it fear—but a deep contempt for the South because I felt that so much of the horror and evil that black people have faced in this country is rooted here ... So in some ways this is my way of dealing with the whole thing."

Reception of the film was mixed. Shipp commented on Singleton's creating a fictional account of Rosewood events, saying that the film "assumes a lot and then makes up a lot more". The film version alludes to many more deaths than the highest counts by eyewitnesses. Gary Moore believes that creating an outside character who inspires the citizens of Rosewood to fight back condescends to survivors, and he criticized the inflated death toll specifically, saying the film was "an interesting experience in illusion". On the other hand, in 2001 <a href="Stanley%20Crouch">Stanley Crouch</a> of "The New York Times" described "Rosewood" as Singleton's finest work, writing, "Never in the history of American film had Southern racist hysteria been shown so clearly. Color, class and sex were woven together on a level that <a href="William%20Faulkner">Faulkner</a> would have appreciated."

The State of Florida declared Rosewood a Florida Heritage Landmark in 2004 and subsequently erected a historical marker on <a href="Florida%20State%20Road%2024">State Road 24</a> that names the victims and describes the community's destruction. Scattered structures remain within the community, including a church, a business, and a few homes, notably John Wright's. Mary Hall Daniels, the last known survivor of the massacre, died at the age of 98 in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>, on May 2, 2018.

Rosewood descendants formed the Rosewood Heritage Foundation and the Real Rosewood Foundation in order to educate people both in Florida and all over the world about the massacre. The Rosewood Heritage Foundation created a traveling exhibit that tours internationally in order to share the history of Rosewood and the attacks; a permanent display is housed in the library of <a href="Bethune-Cookman%20University">Bethune-Cookman University</a> in <a href="Daytona%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Daytona Beach</a>. The Real Rosewood Foundation presents a variety of humanitarian awards to people in Central Florida who help preserve Rosewood's history. The organization also recognized Rosewood residents who protected blacks during the attacks by presenting an Unsung Heroes Award to the descendants of Sheriff Robert Walker, John Bryce, and William Bryce. Lizzie Jenkins, executive director of the Real Rosewood Foundation and niece of the Rosewood schoolteacher, explained her interest in keeping Rosewood's legacy current: 
It has been a struggle telling this story over the years, because a lot of people don't want to hear about this kind of history. People don't relate to it, or just don't want to hear about it. But Mama told me to keep it alive, so I keep telling it ... It's a sad story, but it's one I think everyone needs to hear.

Palladian architecture

Palladian architecture is a European style of <a href="architecture">architecture</a> derived from and inspired by the designs of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetian</a> architect <a href="Andrea%20Palladio">Andrea Palladio</a> (1508–1580). That which is recognised as Palladian architecture today is an evolution of Palladio's original concepts. Palladio's work was strongly based on the symmetry, perspective and values of the formal classical temple architecture of the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a>s and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>. From the 17th century Palladio's interpretation of this classical architecture was adapted as the style known as Palladianism. It continued to develop until the end of the 18th century.

Palladianism became popular briefly in <a href="Early%20Modern%20Britain">Britain</a> during the mid-17th century, but its flowering was cut short by the onset of the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> and the imposition of austerity which followed. In the early 18th century it returned to fashion, not only in England but also, directly influenced from Britain, in <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>. Count <a href="Francesco%20Algarotti">Francesco Algarotti</a> may have written to <a href="Richard%20Boyle%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Burlington">Lord Burlington</a> from Berlin that he was recommending to <a href="Frederick%20the%20Great">Frederick the Great</a> the adoption in Prussia of the architectural style Burlington had introduced in England but <a href="Georg%20Wenzeslaus%20von%20Knobelsdorff">Knobelsdorff</a>'s opera house on the Unter den Linden, based on Campbell's <a href="Wanstead%20House">Wanstead House</a>, had been constructed from 1741. Later in the century, when the style was falling from favour in Europe, it had a surge in popularity throughout the British colonies in North America, highlighted by examples such as <a href="Drayton%20Hall">Drayton Hall</a> in South Carolina, the <a href="Redwood%20Library">Redwood Library</a> in <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>, the Morris-Jumel Mansion in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, the <a href="Hammond-Harwood%20House">Hammond-Harwood House</a> in <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>'s <a href="Monticello">Monticello</a> and <a href="Poplar%20Forest">Poplar Forest</a> in Virginia.

The style continued to be popular in Europe throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, where it was frequently employed in the design of public and municipal buildings. From the latter half of the 19th century it was rivalled by the <a href="Gothic%20revival">Gothic revival</a> in the English-speaking world, whose champions, such as <a href="Augustus%20Welby%20Northmore%20Pugin">Augustus Pugin</a>, remembering the origins of Palladianism in ancient temples, deemed it too pagan for <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> and <a href="Anglo-Catholic">Anglo-Catholic</a> worship. However, as an architectural style it has continued to be popular and to evolve; its <a href="pediment">pediment</a>s, symmetry and proportions are clearly evident in the design of many modern buildings today.

Buildings entirely designed by <a href="Palladio">Palladio</a> are all in <a href="Venice">Venice</a> and the <a href="Veneto">Veneto</a>, with an especially rich grouping of palazzi in <a href="Vicenza">Vicenza</a>. They include <a href="Palladian%20Villas%20of%20the%20Veneto">villas</a>, and <a href="church%20architecture">churches</a> such as <a href="Il%20Redentore">Redentore</a> in Venice. In Palladio's architectural <a href="treatise">treatise</a>s he followed the principles defined by the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> architect <a href="Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a> and his 15th-century disciple <a href="Leon%20Battista%20Alberti">Leon Battista Alberti</a>, who adhered to principles of <a href="Roman%20architecture">classical Roman architecture</a> based on mathematical proportions rather than the rich ornamental style also characteristic of the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>.

Palladio always designed his <a href="villa">villa</a>s with reference to their setting. If on a hill, such as Villa Capra, <a href="facade">facade</a>s were frequently designed to be of equal value so that occupants could have fine views in all directions. Also, in such cases, <a href="portico">portico</a>s were built on all sides so that occupants could fully appreciate the countryside while being protected from the sun, similar to many <a href="United%20States">American</a>-style <a href="porch">porch</a>es of today. Palladio sometimes used a <a href="loggia">loggia</a> as an alternative to the portico. This can most simply be described as a recessed portico, or an internal single storey room, with pierced walls that are open to the elements. Occasionally a loggia would be placed at second floor level over the top of a loggia below, creating what was known as a double loggia. Loggias were sometimes given significance in a facade by being surmounted by a pediment. Villa Godi has as its focal point a loggia rather than a portico, plus loggias terminating each end of the main building.

Palladio would often model his villa elevations on <a href="Roman%20temple">Roman temple</a> facades. The temple influence, often in a <a href="cruciform">cruciform</a> design, later became a <a href="trademark">trademark</a> of his work. Palladian villas are usually built with three floors: a rusticated <a href="basement">basement</a> or ground floor, containing the service and minor rooms. Above this, the <a href="piano%20nobile">piano nobile</a> accessed through a portico reached by a flight of external steps, containing the principal reception and bedrooms, and above it is a low <a href="Mezzanine%20%28architecture%29">mezzanine</a> floor with secondary bedrooms and accommodation. The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios. Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical facade; however, Palladio's designs related to the whole, usually square, villa.

Palladio deeply considered the dual purpose of his villas as both farmhouses and palatial weekend retreats for wealthy <a href="merchant">merchant</a> owners. These symmetrical temple-like houses often have equally symmetrical, but low, wings sweeping away from them to accommodate horses, farm animals, and agricultural stores. The wings, sometimes detached and connected to the villa by <a href="colonnade">colonnade</a>s, were designed not only to be functional but also to complement and accentuate the villa. They were, however, in no way intended to be part of the main house, and it is the design and use of these wings that Palladio's followers in the 18th century adapted to become an integral part of the building.

Palladio's Four Books of Architecture was first published in 1570, This architectural treatise contains descriptions and illustrations of his own architecture along with the Roman building that inspired him to create the style. Palladio reinterpreted Rome's ancient architecture and applied it to all kinds of buildings from grand villas and public buildings to humble houses and farm sheds.

 
The Palladian, Serlian, or Venetian window features largely in Palladio's work and is almost a trademark of his early career. There are two different versions of the motif; properly the simpler one is called a <a href="Venetian%20window">Venetian window</a>, and a more elaborate and specific one a Palladian window or "Palladian motif", although this distinction is not always observed.

The Venetian window has three parts: a central high round-arched opening, with two smaller rectangular openings to the sides, the latter topped by <a href="lintel">lintel</a>s and supported by columns. This really goes back to the ancient Roman <a href="triumphal%20arch">triumphal arch</a>, and was first used outside Venice by <a href="Donato%20Bramante">Donato Bramante</a> and later mentioned by <a href="Sebastiano%20Serlio">Sebastiano Serlio</a> (1475–1554) in his seven-volume architectural book "<a href="Tutte%20l%27opere%20d%27architettura%20et%20prospetiva">Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva</a>" expounding the ideals of Vitruvius and Roman architecture. It can be used in series, but is often only used once in a facade, as at <a href="New%20Wardour%20Castle">New Wardour Castle</a>, or once at each end, as on the inner facade of <a href="Burlington%20House">Burlington House</a> (true Palladian windows). 

Palladio's elaboration of this, normally used in a series, places a larger or <a href="giant%20order">giant order</a> in between each window, and doubles the small columns supporting the side lintels, placing the second column behind rather than beside the first. This was in fact introduced in the <a href="Biblioteca%20Marciana">Biblioteca Marciana</a> in Venice, by <a href="Jacopo%20Sansovino">Jacopo Sansovino</a> (1537, and heavily used by Palladion in the <a href="Basilica%20Palladiana">Basilica Palladiana</a> in <a href="Vicenza">Vicenza</a>, where it is used on both storeys; this feature was less often copied. Here the openings are not strictly windows, as they enclose a <a href="loggia">loggia</a>. <a href="Pilaster">Pilaster</a>s might replace columns, as in other contexts. Sir <a href="John%20Summerson">John Summerson</a> suggests that the ommission of the doubled columns may be allowed, but the term "Palladian motif" should be confined" to cases where the larger order is present. 

Palladio used these elements extensively, for example in very simple form in his entrance to <a href="Villa%20Forni%20Cerato">Villa Forni Cerato</a>. It is perhaps this extensive use of the motif in the <a href="Veneto">Veneto</a> that has given the window its alternative name of the Venetian window; it is also known as a Serlian window. Whatever the name or the origin, this form of window has probably become one of the most enduring features of Palladio's work seen in the later architectural styles evolved from Palladianism. According to <a href="James%20Lees-Milne">James Lees-Milne</a>, its first appearance in Britain was in the remodelled wings of <a href="Burlington%20House">Burlington House</a>, London, where the immediate source was actually in <a href="Inigo%20Jones">Inigo Jones</a>'s designs for <a href="Whitehall%20Palace">Whitehall Palace</a> rather than drawn from Palladio himself.

A variant, in which the motif is enclosed within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though <a href="Richard%20Boyle%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Burlington">Lord Burlington</a> seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to <a href="Vincenzo%20Scamozzi">Scamozzi</a>. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of <a href="Tottenham%20House">Tottenham Park</a> in <a href="Savernake%20Forest">Savernake Forest</a> for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed designs for the north front of <a href="Holkham%20Hall">Holkham Hall</a>.

In 1570 Palladio published his book, "<a href="I%20Quattro%20Libri%20dell%27Architettura">I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura</a>", which inspired architects across Europe.

During the 17th century, many architects studying in Italy learned of Palladio's work. Foreign architects then returned home and adapted Palladio's style to suit various <a href="climate">climate</a>s, <a href="topography">topographies</a> and personal tastes of their clients. Isolated forms of Palladianism throughout the world were brought about in this way. However, the Palladian style did not reach the zenith of its popularity until the 18th century, primarily in <a href="England">England</a>, <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> and later <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. In Venice itself there was an early reaction to the excesses of <a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque architecture</a> that manifested itself as a return to Palladian principles. The earliest neo-Palladians there were the exact contemporaries, both trained up as masons, <a href="Domenico%20Rossi%20%28architect%29">Domenico Rossi</a> (1657–1737) and <a href="Andrea%20Tirali">Andrea Tirali</a> (1657–1737). <a href="Tommaso%20Temanza">Tommaso Temanza</a>, their biographer, proved to be the movement's most able and learned proponent; in his hands the visual inheritance of Palladio's example became increasingly codified in correct rules and drifted towards <a href="neoclassical%20architecture">neoclassicism</a>.

The most influential follower of Palladio anywhere, however, was the Englishman <a href="Inigo%20Jones">Inigo Jones</a>, who travelled throughout Italy with the 'Collector' Earl of Arundel, annotating his copy of Palladio's treatise, in 1613–14. The "Palladianism" of Jones and his contemporaries and later followers was a style largely of facades, and the mathematical formulae dictating layout were not strictly applied. A handful of great country houses in England built between 1640 and c. 1680, such as <a href="Wilton%20House">Wilton House</a>, are in this Palladian style. These follow the great success of Jones' Palladian designs for the <a href="Queen%27s%20House">Queen's House</a> at <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a> and the <a href="Banqueting%20House">Banqueting House</a> at <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a>, the uncompleted royal palace in <a href="London">London</a> of King <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>.

However, the Palladian designs advocated by Inigo Jones were too closely associated with the court of Charles I to survive the turmoil of the civil war. Following the Stuart restoration Jones's Palladianism was eclipsed by the <a href="baroque">baroque</a> designs of such architects as <a href="William%20Talman%20%28architect%29">William Talman</a> and Sir <a href="John%20Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a>, <a href="Nicholas%20Hawksmoor">Nicholas Hawksmoor</a>, and even Jones' pupil <a href="John%20Webb%20%28architect%29">John Webb</a>.

The <a href="baroque">baroque</a> style, popular in continental Europe, was never truly to the English taste and was considered excessively flamboyant, catholic and 'florid'. It was quickly superseded when, in the first quarter of the 18th century, four books were published in Britain which highlighted the simplicity and purity of classical architecture. These were:

The most popular of these among the wealthy patrons of the day was the four-volume "Vitruvius Britannicus" by Colen Campbell. Campbell was both an architect and a publisher. The book was basically a book of design containing architectural prints of British buildings, which had been inspired by the great architects from <a href="Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a> to Palladio; at first mainly those of Inigo Jones, but the later tomes contained drawings and plans by Campbell and other 18th-century architects. These four books greatly contributed to Palladian architecture becoming established in 18th-century Britain. Their three authors became the most fashionable and sought after architects of the era. Due to his book "Vitruvius Britannicus", <a href="Colen%20Campbell">Colen Campbell</a> was chosen as the architect for banker <a href="Henry%20Hoare%20%28banker%29">Henry Hoare I</a>'s <a href="Stourhead">Stourhead</a> house ("illustration above"), a masterpiece that became the inspiration for dozens of similar houses across England.

At the forefront of the new school of design was the aristocratic "architect earl", <a href="Richard%20Boyle%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Burlington">Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington</a>; in 1729, he and William Kent, designed <a href="Chiswick%20House">Chiswick House</a>. This House was a reinterpretation of Palladio's Villa Capra, but purified of 16th century elements and ornament. This severe lack of ornamentation was to be a feature of the Palladianism.
In 1734 <a href="William%20Kent">William Kent</a> and Lord Burlington designed one of England's finest examples of Palladian architecture with <a href="Holkham%20Hall">Holkham Hall</a> in <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>. The main block of this house followed Palladio's dictates quite closely, but Palladio's low, often detached, wings of farm buildings were elevated in significance. Kent attached them to the design, banished the farm animals, and elevated the wings to almost the same importance as the house itself. These wings were often adorned with porticos and pediments, often resembling, as at the much later <a href="Kedleston%20Hall">Kedleston Hall</a>, small <a href="country%20houses">country houses</a> in their own right. It was the development of the flanking wings that was to cause English Palladianism to evolve from being a pastiche of Palladio's original work.

Architectural styles evolve and change to suit the requirements of each individual client. When in 1746 the <a href="John%20Russell%2C%204th%20Duke%20of%20Bedford">Duke of Bedford</a> decided to rebuild <a href="Woburn%20Abbey">Woburn Abbey</a>, he chose the Palladian style for the design, as this was now the most fashionable of the era. He selected architect <a href="Henry%20Flitcroft">Henry Flitcroft</a>, a protege of Burlington. Flitcroft's designs, while Palladian in nature, would not be recognised by Palladio himself. The central block is small, only three bays, the temple-like portico is merely suggested, and it is closed. Two great flanking wings containing a vast suite of <a href="state%20room">state room</a>s replace the walls or colonnades which should have connected to the farm buildings; the farm buildings terminating the structure are elevated in height to match the central block, and given <a href="Palladian%20window">Palladian window</a>s, to ensure they are seen as of Palladian design. This development of the style was to be repeated in countless houses, and town halls in Britain over one hundred years. Falling from favour during the Victorian era, it was revived by Sir <a href="Aston%20Webb">Aston Webb</a> for his refacing of <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> in 1913. Often the terminating blocks would have blind porticos and pilasters themselves, competing for attention with, or complementing the central block. This was all very far removed from the designs of Palladio two hundred years earlier.

English Palladian houses were now no longer the small but exquisite weekend retreats from which their Italian counterparts were conceived. They were no longer <a href="villa">villa</a>s but "power houses" in Sir <a href="John%20Summerson">John Summerson</a>'s term, the symbolic centres of power of the Whig "squirearchy" that ruled Britain. As the Palladian style swept Britain, all thoughts of mathematical proportion were swept away. Rather than square houses with supporting wings, these buildings had the length of the façade as their major consideration; long houses often only one room deep were deliberately deceitful in giving a false impression of size.

During the Palladian revival period in <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, even quite modest mansions were cast in a neo-Palladian mould. Palladian architecture in Ireland subtly differs from that in England. While adhering as in other countries to the basic ideals of Palladio, it is often truer to them – perhaps because it was often designed by architects who had come directly from mainland Europe, and therefore were not influenced by the evolution that Palladianism was undergoing in Britain. Whatever the reason, Palladianism still had to be adapted for the wetter, colder weather.

One of the most pioneering Irish architects was Sir <a href="Edward%20Lovett%20Pearce">Edward Lovett Pearce</a> (1699–1733), who became one of the leading advocates of Palladianism in Ireland. A cousin of Sir <a href="John%20Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a>, he was originally one of his pupils, but rejecting the baroque, he spent three years studying architecture in <a href="France">France</a> and Italy, before returning home to Ireland. His most important Palladian work is the former <a href="Irish%20Houses%20of%20Parliament">Irish Houses of Parliament</a> in Dublin. He was a prolific architect who also designed the south façade of <a href="Drumcondra%20House">Drumcondra House</a> in 1725 and <a href="Summerhill%20House">Summerhill House</a> in 1731, which was completed after Pearce's death by <a href="Richard%20Cassels">Richard Cassels</a>.

Pearce oversaw the building of <a href="Castletown%20House">Castletown House</a>, near <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, designed by the Italian architect <a href="Alessandro%20Galilei">Alessandro Galilei</a> (1691–1737). It is perhaps the only Palladian house in Ireland to have been built with Palladio's mathematical ratios, and one of the three Irish mansions which claim to have inspired the design of the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington</a>.

Other examples include <a href="Russborough">Russborough</a>, designed by Cassels, who also designed the Palladian Rotunda Hospital in Dublin, and <a href="Florence%20Court">Florence Court</a>, <a href="County%20Fermanagh">County Fermanagh</a>. Irish Palladian <a href="Country%20houses">Country houses</a> often feature robust <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a> plasterwork, frequently executed by the <a href="Lafranchini%20brothers">Lafranchini brothers</a>, an Irish speciality, which is far more flamboyant than the interiors of their contemporaries in England. So much of Dublin was built in the 18th century that it set a <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> stamp on the city; however arising out of bad planning and poverty, until recently Dublin was one of the few cities where fine 18th-century housing could be seen in ruinous condition. Elsewhere in Ireland after 1922, the lead was removed from the roofs of unoccupied Palladian houses for its value as scrap, with the houses often abandoned owing to excessive roof-rate based taxes. Some roofless Palladian houses can still be found in the depopulated Irish countryside.

Palladio's influence in North America is evident almost from the beginning of architect-designed building there though the Irish philosopher, <a href="George%20Berkeley">George Berkeley</a>, may have been America's pioneering Palladian. Acquiring a large farmhouse in Middletown, near Newport in the late 1720s, Berkeley dubbed it "Whitehall" and improved it with a Palladian doorcase derived from William Kent's "Designs of Inigo Jones" (1727), which he may have brought with him from London; Palladio's work was included in the library of a thousand volumes he amassed for the purpose and sent to <a href="Yale%20College">Yale College</a>. In 1749 <a href="Peter%20Harrison%20%28architect%29">Peter Harrison</a> adopted the design of his <a href="Redwood%20Library%20and%20Athenaeum">Redwood Library</a> in <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>, more directly from Palladio's "<a href="I%20Quattro%20Libri%20dell%27Architettura">Quattro Libri</a>", while his Brick Market, also in Newport, of a decade later is also Palladian in conception.

The <a href="Hammond-Harwood%20House">Hammond-Harwood House</a> in <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a> ("illustration") is an example of Palladian architecture in the United States. It is the only existing work of colonial academic architecture that was principally designed from a plate in <a href="Andrea%20Palladio">Andrea Palladio</a>’s "Quattro Libri". The house was designed by the architect <a href="William%20Buckland%20%28architect%29">William Buckland</a> in 1773–74 for wealthy farmer Matthias Hammond of <a href="Anne%20Arundel%20County">Anne Arundel County</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>. It was modeled on the design of the <a href="Villa%20Pisani%20%28Montagnana%29">Villa Pisani</a> in <a href="Montagnana">Montagnana</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a> in Book II, Chapter XIV of "I Quattro Libri dell’Achitettura."

The politician and architect <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> (1743–1826) once referred to Palladio's " Quattro Libri" as his <a href="bible">bible</a>. Jefferson acquired an intense appreciation of Palladio's architectural concepts, and his designs for his own beloved <a href="Monticello">Monticello</a>, the <a href="James%20Barbour">James Barbour</a> <a href="Barboursville%20%28James%20Barbour%29">Barboursville</a> estate, <a href="Virginia%20State%20Capitol">Virginia State Capitol</a>, and the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a> were based on drawings from Palladio's book. Realizing the powerful political significance pertaining to ancient Roman buildings, Jefferson designed his civic buildings in the Palladian style. Monticello (remodelled between 1796 and 1808) is quite clearly based on Palladio's <a href="Villa%20Capra">Villa Capra</a>, however, with modifications, in a style which is described in America today as <a href="Colonial%20Georgian">Colonial Georgian</a>. Jefferson's <a href="Pantheon%2C%20Rome">Pantheon</a>, or <a href="The%20Rotunda%20%28University%20of%20Virginia%29">Rotunda</a>, at the University of Virginia is undeniably Palladian in concept and style.

In <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> and <a href="The%20Carolinas">Carolina</a>, the Palladian manner is epitomised in numerous <a href="Tidewater%20region%20of%20Virginia">Tidewater</a> <a href="Plantation%20complexes%20in%20the%20Southeastern%20United%20States%23Plantation%20house">plantation house</a>s, such as <a href="Stratford%20Hall%20Plantation">Stratford Hall</a> or <a href="Westover%20Plantation">Westover Plantation</a>, or <a href="Drayton%20Hall">Drayton Hall</a> near <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a>. These examples are all classic American <a href="American%20colonial%20architecture">colonial</a> examples of a Palladian taste that was transmitted through <a href="engraving">engraving</a>s, for the benefit of masons—and patrons, too—who had no first-hand experience of European building practice. A feature of American Palladianism was the re-emergence of the great portico, which again, as in Italy, fulfilled the need of protection from the sun; the portico in various forms and size became a dominant feature of American <a href="colonial%20architecture">colonial architecture</a>. In the north European countries the portico had become a mere symbol, often closed, or merely hinted at in the design by <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s, and sometimes in very late examples of English Palladianism adapted to become a <a href="porte-cochere">porte-cochere</a>; in America, the Palladian portico regained its full glory.

One house which clearly shows this Palladian-Gibbs influence is <a href="Mount%20Airy%2C%20Richmond%20County%2C%20Virginia">Mount Airy</a>, in <a href="Richmond%20County%2C%20Virginia">Richmond County, Virginia</a>, built in 1758–62.

At <a href="Westover%20Plantation">Westover</a> the north and south entrances, made of imported <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a>, were patterned after a plate in William Salmon's "Palladio Londinensis" (1734).

The distinctive feature of <a href="Drayton%20Hall">Drayton Hall</a>, its two-storey portico, was derived directly from Palladio.

The neoclassical presidential mansion, the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> in Washington, was inspired by Irish Palladianism. Both Castle Coole and Richard Cassel's <a href="Leinster%20House">Leinster House</a> in Dublin claim to have inspired the architect <a href="James%20Hoban">James Hoban</a>, who designed the executive mansion, built between 1792 and 1800. Hoban, born in <a href="Callan%2C%20County%20Kilkenny">Callan</a>, <a href="County%20Kilkenny">County Kilkenny</a>, in 1762, studied architecture in Dublin, where Leinster House (built c. 1747) was one of the finest buildings at the time. The White House is more neoclassical than Palladian; particularly the South façade, which closely resembles <a href="James%20Wyatt">James Wyatt</a>'s 1790 design for <a href="Castle%20Coole">Castle Coole</a>, also in Ireland. Castle Coole is, in the words of the architectural commentator Gervase Jackson-Stops, "A culmination of the Palladian traditions, yet strictly neoclassical in its chaste ornament and noble austerity."

One of the adaptations made to Palladianism in America was that the piano nobile now tended to be placed on the ground floor, rather than above a service floor, as was the tradition in Europe. This service floor, if it existed at all, was now a discreet semi-basement. This negated the need for an ornate external staircase leading to the main entrance as in the more original Palladian designs. This would also be a feature of the neoclassical style that followed Palladianism.

The only two houses in the United States—from the English colonial period (1607–1776)—that can be definitively attributed to designs from the "Four Books of Architecture" are architect William Buckland's <a href="Hammond-Harwood%20House">Hammond-Harwood House</a> (1774) in <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a>, and Thomas Jefferson's first Monticello. The design source for the Hammond-Harwood House is Villa Pisani at <a href="Montagnana">Montagnana</a> (Book II, Chapter XIV), and for the first Monticello (1770) the design source is <a href="Villa%20Cornaro">Villa Cornaro</a> at <a href="Piombino%20Dese">Piombino Dese</a> (Book II, Chapter XIV). Thomas Jefferson later covered this façade with additions so that the Hammond-Harwood House remains the only pure and pristine example of direct modeling in America today.

Because of its later development, Palladian architecture in Canada is rare. One notable example is the <a href="Province%20House%20%28Nova%20Scotia%29">Nova Scotia Legislature building</a>, completed in 1819. Another example is <a href="Government%20House%20%28Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador%29">Government House</a> in <a href="St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland">St. John's, Newfoundland</a>.
<a href="The%20Center%20for%20Palladian%20Studies%20in%20America%2C%20Inc.">The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.</a>, a non-profit membership organization, was founded in 1979 to research and promote understanding of Palladio’s influence in the United States.

By the 1770s, in Britain, such architects as <a href="Robert%20Adam">Robert Adam</a> and Sir <a href="William%20Chambers%20%28architect%29">William Chambers</a> were in huge popular demand, but they were now drawing on a great variety of classical sources, including ancient <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, so much so that their forms of architecture were eventually defined as <a href="neoclassicism">neoclassical</a> rather than Palladian. In Europe, the Palladian revival ended by the end of the 18th century. In North America, Palladianism lingered a little longer; Thomas Jefferson's floor plans and elevations owe a great deal to Palladio's "Quattro Libri." The term "Palladian" today is often misused, and tends to describe a building with any classical pretensions. There was, however, a revival of Palladian ideas amongst the colonial revivalists of the early 20th century, and the strain has been unbroken, even through the modernist period.

In the mid-20th century, the originality of the approach of the architectural historian <a href="Colin%20Rowe">Colin Rowe</a> had the effect of re-situating the assessment of modern architecture within history and acknowledged the Palladian architecture as an active influence. In the later 20th century, when Rowe's influence had spread worldwide, this approach had become a key element in the process of architectural and urban design. If "the presence of the past" was evident in the work of many architects in the late 20th century, from <a href="James%20Stirling%20%28architect%29">James Stirling</a> to <a href="Aldo%20Rossi">Aldo Rossi</a>, <a href="Robert%20Venturi">Robert Venturi</a>, <a href="Oswald%20Matthias%20Ungers">Oswald Matthias Ungers</a>, <a href="Peter%20Eisenman">Peter Eisenman</a>, <a href="Michael%20Graves">Michael Graves</a> and others, this was largely due to the influence of Rowe. Colin Rowe's unorthodox and non-chronological view of history then made it possible for him to develop theoretical formulations such as his famous essay "The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa" (1947) in which he theorised that there were compositional "rules" in Palladio’s villas that could be demonstrated to correspond to similar "rules" in Le Corbusier’s villas at Poissy and Garches. This approach enabled Rowe to elaborate an astonishingly fresh and provocative trans-historical assessment of both Palladio and Le Corbusier, in which the architecture of both was assessed not in chronological time, but side by side in the present moment.

United Kingdom corporation tax

In the United Kingdom, corporation tax is a <a href="corporate%20tax">corporate tax</a> levied in the United Kingdom on the <a href="Profit%20%28economics%29">profit</a>s made by UK-resident <a href="Company%20%28law%29">companies</a> and on the profits of entities registered overseas with <a href="permanent%20establishment">permanent establishment</a>s in the UK.

Until 1 April 1965, companies were taxed at the same <a href="Taxation%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Income%20tax">income tax rates</a> as individual taxpayers, with an additional <a href="profits%20tax">profits tax</a> levied on companies. <a href="Finance%20Act%201965">Finance Act 1965</a> replaced this structure for companies and associations with a single corporate tax, which took its basic structure and rules from the income tax system. Since 1997, the UK's <a href="Tax%20Law%20Rewrite%20Project">Tax Law Rewrite Project</a> has been modernising the UK's tax legislation, starting with income tax, while the legislation imposing corporation tax has itself been amended, the rules governing income tax and corporation tax have thus diverged. Corporation tax was governed by the <a href="Income%20and%20Corporation%20Taxes%20Act%201988">Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988</a> (as amended) prior to the rewrite project.

Originally introduced as a classical tax system, in which companies were subject to tax on their profits and companies' <a href="shareholder">shareholder</a>s were also liable to income tax on the <a href="dividend">dividend</a>s that they received, the first major amendment to corporation tax saw it move to a <a href="dividend%20imputation">dividend imputation</a> system in 1973, under which an individual receiving a dividend became entitled to an income tax credit representing the corporation tax already paid by the company paying the dividend. The classical system was reintroduced in 1999, with the abolition of <a href="advance%20corporation%20tax">advance corporation tax</a> and of repayable dividend tax credits. Another change saw the single main rate of tax split into three. <a href="Tax%20competition">Tax competition</a> between jurisdictions reduced the main corporate tax rate from 28% in 2008-2010 to a flat rate of 20% as of April 2015.

The <a href="UK%20government">UK government</a> faced problems with its corporate tax structure, including <a href="European%20Court%20of%20Justice">European Court of Justice</a> judgements that aspects of it are incompatible with EU treaties. <a href="Tax%20avoidance">Tax avoidance</a> schemes marketed by the financial sector have also proven an irritant, and been countered by complicated anti-avoidance legislation.

The complexity of the corporation tax system is a recognised issue. The Labour government, supported by the Opposition parties, carried through wide-scale reform from the Tax Law Rewrite project, resulting in the <a href="Corporation%20Tax%20Act%202010">Corporation Tax Act 2010</a>. The tax has slowly been integrating <a href="generally%20accepted%20accounting%20practice">generally accepted accounting practice</a>, with the corporation tax system in various specific areas based directly on the accounting treatment.

Total net corporation tax receipts were a record high of £56 billion in 2016-17.

Until 1965, companies were subject to income tax on their profits at the same rates as was levied on individual taxpayers. A <a href="dividend%20imputation">dividend imputation</a> system existed, whereby the income tax paid by a company was offset against the income tax liability of a shareholder who received dividends from the company. The standard rate of income tax in 1949 was 50%. If the company paid a £100 dividend, the recipient would be treated as if he had earned £200 and had paid £100 in income tax on it – the tax paid by the company fully covered the tax due from the individual on the dividend paid. If, however, the individual was subject to tax at a higher rate (known as "surtax"), he (not the company) would be liable to pay the additional tax.

In addition to income tax, companies were also subject to a profits tax, which was deducted from company profits when determining the income tax liability. It was a differential tax, with a higher tax rate on <a href="dividend">dividend</a>s (profits distributed to shareholders) than on profits retained within the company. By penalising the distribution of profits, it was hoped companies would retain profits for investment, which was considered a priority after the Second World War. The tax did not have the desired effect, so the distributed profits tax was increased by 20% by the <a href="Attlee%20ministry">post-war Labour government</a> to encourage companies to retain more of their profits. At the time of <a href="Hugh%20Gaitskell">Hugh Gaitskell</a>'s 1951 budget, the profits tax was 50% for distributed profits and 10% for undistributed profits.

A series of reductions in the profits tax were brought in from 1951 onwards by the new Conservative government. The tax rates fell to 22.5% on distributed profits and 2.5% on undistributed profits by 1957, but the profits tax was no longer income tax-deductible. <a href="Derick%20Heathcoat-Amory">Derick Heathcoat-Amory</a>'s Budget of March 1958 replaced the differential profits tax with a single profits tax measure, applicable to both retained and distributed profits. This gradual decrease, and final abolition, of taxes on capital distributions reflected ideological differences between the Conservative and Labour parties: the Conservative approach was to distribute profits to capital holders for investment elsewhere, while Labour sought to force companies to retain profits for reinvestment in the company in the hope this would benefit the company's workforce.

Finance Act 1965 replaced the system of income tax and profits tax from 1 April 1965 with the Corporation Tax, which re-introduced aspects of the old system. Corporation Tax was charged at a uniform rate on all profits, but additional tax was then payable if profits were distributed as a dividend to shareholders. In effect, dividends suffered double taxation. This method of corporation tax is known as the classical system and is similar to that used in the United States. The effect of the tax was to revert to the distribution tax in operation from 1949 to 1959: dividend payments were subject to higher tax than profits retained within the company.

Finance Act 1965 also introduced a <a href="capital%20gains%20tax">capital gains tax</a>, at a rate of 30%, charged on the gains arising on the disposal of capital assets by individuals. While companies were exempted from capital gains tax, they were liable to corporation tax on their "chargeable gains", which were calculated in substantially the same way as capital gains for individuals. The tax applied to company shares as well as other assets. Before 1965, capital gains were not taxed, and it was advantageous for taxpayers to argue that a receipt was non-taxable "capital" rather than taxable "revenue".

The basic structure of the tax, where company profits were taxed as profits, and dividend payments were then taxed as income, remained unchanged until 1973, when a partial imputation system was introduced for dividend payments. Unlike the previous imputation system, the tax credit to the shareholder was less than the corporation tax paid (corporation tax was higher than the standard rate of income tax, but the imputation, or set-off, was only of standard rate tax). When companies made distributions, they also paid the advance corporation tax (known as ACT), which could be set off against the main corporation tax charge, subject to certain limits (the full amount of ACT paid could not be recovered if significantly large amounts of profits were distributed). Individuals and companies who received a dividend from a UK company received a <a href="tax%20credit">tax credit</a> representing the ACT paid. Individuals could set off the tax credit against their income tax liability.

On introduction, ACT was set at 30% of the gross dividend (the actual amount paid plus the tax credit). If a company made a £70 dividend payment to an individual, the company would pay £30 of advance corporation tax. The shareholder would receive the £70 cash payment, plus a tax credit of £30; thus, the individual would be deemed to have earned £100, and to have already paid tax of £30 on it. The ACT paid by the company would be deductible against its final "mainstream" corporation tax bill. To the extent that the individual's tax on the dividend was less than the tax credit – for example, if his income was too low to pay tax (below £595 in 1973–1974) – he would be able to reclaim some or all of the £30 tax paid by the company. The set-off was only partial, since the company would pay 52% tax (small companies had lower rates, but still higher than the ACT rate), and thus the £70 received by the individual actually represented pre-tax profits of £145.83. Accordingly, only part of the double taxation was relieved.

ACT was not payable on dividends from one UK company to another (unless the payor company elected to pay it). Also, the recipient company was not taxed on that dividend receipt, except for dealers in shares and <a href="life%20assurance">life assurance</a> companies in respect of some of their profits. As the payor company would have suffered tax on the payments it made, the company that received the dividend also received a credit that it could use to reduce the amount of ACT it itself paid, or, in certain cases, apply to have the tax credit repaid to them.
The level of ACT was linked to the basic rate of income tax between 1973 and 1993. The March 1993 Budget of <a href="Norman%20Lamont%20%281942%29">Norman Lamont</a> cut the ACT rate and tax credit to 22.5% from April 1993, and 20% from April 1994. These changes were accompanied with a cut of income tax on dividends to 20%, while the basic rate of income tax remained at 25%. Persons liable for tax were lightly affected by the change, because income tax liability was still balanced by the tax credit received, although higher rate tax payers paid an additional 25% tax on the amount of the dividend actually received (net), as against 20% before the change.

The change had bigger effects on pensions and non-taxpayers. A pension fund receiving a £1.2 m dividend income prior to the change would have been able to reclaim £400,000 in tax, giving a total income of £1.6 m. After the change, only £300,000 was reclaimable, reducing income to £1.5 m, a fall of 6.25%.

<a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a>'s summer Budget of 1997 ended the ability of pension funds and other tax-exempt companies to reclaim tax credits with immediate effect, and for individuals from April 1999. This tax change has been blamed for the poor state of British pension provision, while usually ignoring the more significant effect of the dot-com shareprice crash of 2000 onwards when the FTSE-100 lost half its value to fall from 6930 at the beginning of 2000 to just 3490 by March 2003. Despite this, critics such as <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> <a href="Frank%20Field%20%28UK%20politician%29">Frank Field</a> described it as a "hammer blow" and the "<a href="Sunday%20Times">Sunday Times</a>" described it as a swindle, with the hypothetical £1.5 m income described above falling to £1.2 m, a fall in income of 20%, because no tax would be reclaimable.

From 6 April 1999 ACT was abolished, and the tax credit on dividends was reduced to 10%. There was a matching reduction in the basic income tax rate on dividends to 10%, while a new higher-rate of 32.5% was introduced which led to an overall effective 25% tax rate for higher rate taxpayers on dividends (after setting this "notional" tax credit against the tax liability).While non-taxpayers were no longer able to claim this amount from the treasury (as opposed to taxpayers who could deduct it from their tax bill), the 20% ACT (which would have previously been deducted from the dividend before payment) was no longer levied.

The abolition of ACT was actually one of the biggest tax grabs ever by a Chancellor, as pension companies could no longer recover the tax paid on dividends (along with pensioners and other reliant on the income). This now costs over £10bn a year and was one of the factors that lead to the death of the final salary pension scheme. (ref:https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/pensions/10798785/True-cost-of-Labours-pension-tax-raid-and-others-since-Seventies.html). It is one of the biggest tax grabs ever, sold as 'the abolition of a tax'.

ACT that had been incurred prior to 1999 could still be set off against a company's tax liability, provided it would have been able to set it off under the old imputation system. In order to keep the stream of payments associated with advance corporation tax payment, 'large' companies (comprising the majority of corporation tax receipts) were subjected to a quarterly instalments scheme for tax payment.

On its introduction in 1965, corporation tax was charged at 40%, rising to 45% in the 1969 <a href="Budget">Budget</a>. The rate then fell to 42.5% in the second Budget of 1970 and 40% in 1971. In 1973, alongside the introduction of <a href="advance%20corporation%20tax">advance corporation tax</a> (ACT), Conservative chancellor <a href="Anthony%20Barber">Anthony Barber</a> created a main rate of 52%, together with a smaller companies' rate of 42%. This apparent increase was negated by the fact that under the ACT scheme, dividends were no longer subject to income tax.

The 1979 Conservative Budget of <a href="Geoffrey%20Howe">Geoffrey Howe</a> cut the small companies' rate to 40%, followed by a further cut in the 1982 Budget to 38%. The Budgets of 1983–1988 saw sharp cuts in both main and small companies' rates, falling to 35% and 25% respectively. Budgets between 1988 and 2001 brought further falls to a 30% main rate and 19% small companies' rates. From April 1983 to March 1997 the small companies' rate was pegged to the basic rate of <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a>. During the 1980s there was briefly a higher rate of tax imposed for capital profits.

Chancellor <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a>'s 1999 Budget introduced a 10% starting rate for profits from £0 to £10,000, effective from April 2000. Marginal relief applied meaning companies with profits of between £10,000 and £50,000 paid a rate between the starting rate and the small companies' rate (19% in 2000).

The 2002 Budget cut the starting rate to zero, with marginal relief applying in the same way. This caused a significant increase in the number of companies being incorporated, as businesses that had operated as <a href="self-employed">self-employed</a>, paying income tax on profits from just over £5,000, were attracted to the corporation tax rate of 0% on income up to £10,000. Previously self-employed individuals could now distribute profits as <a href="dividend">dividend</a> payments rather than salaries. For companies with profits under £50,000 the corporation tax rate varied between 0% and 19%. Because dividend payments come with a <a href="basic%20rate%20tax">basic rate tax</a> credit, provided the recipient did not earn more than the basic rate allowance, no further tax would be paid. The number of new companies being formed in 2002–2003 reached 325,900, an increase of 45% on 2001–2002.

The fact that individuals operating in this manner could potentially pay no tax at all was felt by the government to be unfair tax avoidance, and the 2004 Budget introduced a Non-Corporate Distribution Rate. This ensured that where a company paid below the small companies' rate (19% in 2004), dividend payments made to non-corporates (for example, individuals, trusts and personal representatives of deceased persons) would be subject to additional corporation tax, bringing the corporation tax paid up to 19%. For example, a company making £10,000 profit, and making a £6,000 dividend distribution to an individual and £4,000 to another company would pay 19% corporation tax on the £6,000. Although this measure substantially reduced the number of small businesses incorporating, the Chancellor in the 2006 Budget said tax avoidance by small businesses through incorporation was still a major issue, and scrapped the starting rate entirely.

The starting point for computing taxable profits is profits before tax (except for a <a href="life%20assurance">life assurance</a> company). The rules for calculating corporation tax generally ran in parallel with income tax until 1993, when the first statutory rule to move profit reporting into line with <a href="generally%20accepted%20accounting%20practice">generally accepted accounting practice</a> was introduced, although the courts were already moving towards requiring trading profits to be computed using general <a href="accountancy">accountancy</a> rules.

Finance Act 1993 introduced rules to make tax on exchange gains and losses mimic their treatment in a company's <a href="financial%20statements">financial statements</a> in most instances. Finance Act 1994 saw similar rules for financial instruments, and in Finance Act 1996 the treatment of most loan relationships was also brought into line with the accounting treatment. Finance Act 1997 saw something similar with rental premiums. A year later, Finance Act 1998 went even further, making it clear that taxable trading profits (apart from those accruing to a <a href="Lloyd%27s%20of%20London">Lloyd's</a> corporate name or to a <a href="life%20assurance">life assurance</a> company) and profits from a rental business are equal to profits calculated under <a href="UK%20generally%20accepted%20accounting%20principles">generally accepted accounting practice</a> ("GAAP") unless there is a specific statutory or case law rule to the contrary. This was followed up by Finance Act 2004, which provided that where a company with investment business could make deductions for management expenses, they were calculated by reference to figures in the <a href="financial%20statements">financial statements</a>.

From 2005, all <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> <a href="listed%20company">listed companies</a> have to prepare their financial statements using the "<a href="International%20Financial%20Reporting%20Standards">International Financial Reporting Standards</a>" ("IFRS"), as modified by the EU. Other UK companies may choose to adopt IFRS. Corporation tax law is changing so that, in the future, IFRS accounting profits are largely respected. The exception is for certain financial instruments and certain other measures to prevent tax <a href="arbitrage">arbitrage</a> between companies applying IFRS and companies applying UK GAAP.

<a href="Tax%20avoidance">Tax avoidance</a> is the legitimate reduction of tax through tax planning and/or usage of legal provisions. Unlike most other countries, most UK tax professionals are accountants rather than lawyers by training.

Until 2013, the UK had no <a href="tax%20avoidance">general anti-avoidance rule</a> ("GAAR") for corporation tax. However, it inherited an anti-avoidance rule from income tax relating to transactions in securities, and since then has had various "mini-GAARs" added to it. The best known "mini-GAAR" prevents a deduction for interest paid when the loan to which it relates is made for an "unallowable purpose". In 2013, the government introduced a General Anti-Avoidance Rule to manage the risk of tax avoidance.

Finance Act 2004 introduced disclosure rules requiring promoters of certain tax avoidance schemes that are financing- or employment-related to disclose the scheme. Taxpayers who use these schemes must also disclose their use when they submit their tax returns. This is the first provision of its kind in the UK, and Finance Act 2005 has shown a number of tax avoidance schemes being blocked earlier than would have been expected prior to the disclosure rules.

In the early twenty-first century the government sought to raise more revenues from corporation tax. In 2002 it introduced a separate 10% supplementary charge on profits from oil and gas extraction businesses, and Finance Act 2005 contained measures to accelerate when oil and gas extraction business have to pay tax. Instead of paying their tax in four equal instalments in the seventh, tenth, thirteenth and sixteenth month after the accounting period starts, they will be required to consolidate their third and fourth payments and pay them in the thirteenth month, creating a <a href="cash%20flow">cash flow</a> advantage for the government.Finance (No.2) Act 2005 continued measures specifically relating to <a href="life%20assurance">life assurance</a> companies. When originally announced (as Finance (No.3) Bill 2005) <a href="Legal%20%26amp%3B%20General">Legal & General</a> told the Stock Exchange that £300 m had been wiped off its value, and Aviva (Norwich Union) announced that the tax changes would cost its policy holders £150 m.

Powers to collect corporation tax must be passed annually by <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">parliament</a>, otherwise there is no authority to collect it. The charge for the <a href="Fiscal%20year">financial year</a> (beginning 1 April each year) is imposed by successive finance acts. The tax is charged in respect of the company's <a href="accounting%20period">accounting period</a>, which is normally the 12-month period for which the company prepares its <a href="financial%20statements">accounts</a>. Corporation tax is administered by <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Revenue%20and%20Customs">Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs</a> (HMRC).

Corporation tax is levied on the net profits of a company. Except for certain <a href="life%20assurance">life assurance</a> companies, it is borne by the company as a <a href="direct%20tax">direct tax</a>.

Up until 1999 no corporation tax was due unless HMRC raised an assessment on a company. Companies were, however, obliged to report certain details to HMRC so that the right amount could be assessed. This changed for accounting periods ending on or after 1 July 1999, when self-assessment was introduced. Self-assessment means that companies are required to assess themselves "and take full responsibility for that assessment". If the self-assessment is wrong through negligence or recklessness, the company can be liable to penalties.
The self-assessment tax return needs to be delivered to HMRC 12 months after the end of the period of account in which the accounting period falls (although the tax must be paid before this date). If a company fails to submit a return by then, it is liable to penalties. HMRC may then issue a determination of the tax payable, which cannot be appealed – however, in practice they wait until a further six months have elapsed. Also, the most common claims and elections that may be made by a company have to be part of its tax return, with a time limit of two years after the end of the accounting period. This means that a company submitting its return more than one year late suffers not only from the late filing penalties, but also from the inability to make these claims and elections.

From 2004 there has been a requirement for new companies to notify HM Revenue & Customs of their <a href="Company%20Formation">formation</a>, although HMRC receives notifications of new company registrations from <a href="Companies%20House">Companies House</a>. Companies will then receive an annual notice CT603, approximately 1–2 months after the end of the company's financial period, notifying it to complete an annual return. This must also include the company's annual accounts, and possibly other documents, such as <a href="auditor">auditor</a>s' reports, that are required for certain companies.

In the United Kingdom the "source rule" applies. This means that something is taxed only if there is a specific provision bringing it within the charge to tax. Accordingly, profits are only charged to corporation tax if they fall within one of the following, and are not otherwise exempted by an explicit provision of the Taxes Acts:

Notes:

Schedule D is itself divided into a number of cases:

Notes:

Strictly speaking, Corporation Tax Act 2010 replaces the historic terminology "Schedule A", "Schedule D Case I" etc. with more descriptive terms but this does not affect the substantive application of the schedular system so that, for example, different rules apply for utilising tax losses depending upon the nature of the income under which the losses arises.

Most direct expenses are deductible when calculating taxable income and chargeable gains. Notable exceptions include any costs of entertaining clients. Companies with investment business may deduct certain indirect expenses known as "expenses of management" when calculating their taxable profits. A similar relief is available for expenses of a <a href="life%20assurance">life assurance</a> company taxed on the <a href="I%20minus%20E%20basis">I minus E basis</a> which relate to the company's <a href="basic%20life%20assurance%20and%20general%20annuity%20business">basic life assurance and general annuity business</a>. Donations made to charities are also normally deducted in calculating taxable income if made under <a href="Gift%20Aid">Gift Aid</a>.

The 2007 Budget announced a main rate cut from 30% to 28%, effective from April 2008. At the same time, the small companies' rate was increased from 19% to 20% from April 2007, 21% in April 2008, to stop "individuals artificially incorporating as small companies to avoid paying their due share of tax, a practice if left unaddressed would cost the rest of the taxpaying population billions of pounds".

The rate of corporation tax is determined by the financial year, which runs from 1 April to the following 31 March. Financial year FY17 started on 1 April 2017 and ends on 31 March 2018. Where a company's <a href="accounting%20period">accounting period</a> straddles a financial year in which the corporation tax rate has changed, the company's profits for that period are split. For example, a company paying small companies' rate with its accounting period running from 1 January to 31 December, and making £100,000 of profit in 2007, would be deemed to have made 90/365*£100,000 = £24,657.53 in FY06 (there are 90 days between 1 January and 31 March), and 275/365*£100,000=£75,34.47 in FY07, and would pay 19% on the FY06 portion, and 20% on the FY07 portion.

From 1 April 2010 HM Revenue & Customs updated their terminology and the former Small Companies' Rate is now called Small Profits Rate.

Notes:

Most companies are required to pay tax nine months and a day after the end of an accounting period. Larger companies are required to pay quarterly instalments, in the seventh, tenth, thirteenth and sixteenth months after a full accounting period starts. These times are modified where an accounting period lasts for less than twelve months. From 2005 onwards, for tax payable on oil and gas extraction profits, the third and fourth quarterly instalments are merged, including the supplementary 10% charge.

In the financial year 2004–2005, approximately 39,000 companies paid corporation tax at the main rate. These 4.7% of active companies are responsible for 75% of all corporation tax receipts. Around 224,000 companies paid the small companies rate, with 34,000 benefiting from marginal relief. 264,000 were in the starting rate, with 269,000 benefiting from the lower band of marginal relief. The total revenue was £41.9bn from 831,885 companies. Only 23480 companies had a liability in excess of £100,000.

HMRC has one year from the normal filing date, which is itself one year after the end of the <a href="period%20of%20account">period of account</a>, to open an enquiry into the return. This period is extended if the return is filed late. The enquiry continues until all issues that HMRC wish to enquire about a return are dealt with. However, a company can appeal to the Commissioners of Income Tax to close an enquiry if they feel there is undue delay.

If either side disputes the amount of tax that is payable, they may appeal to either the General or Special Commissioners of Income Tax. Appeals on points of law may be made to the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">High Court</a> (<a href="Court%20of%20Session">Court of Session</a> in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>), then the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeals">Court of Appeal</a>, and finally, with leave, to the <a href="Judicial%20functions%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>. However, decisions of fact are binding and can only be appealed if no reasonable Commissioner could have made that decision.

Once an enquiry is closed, or the time for opening an enquiry has passed, HMRC can only re-open a prior year if they become aware of an issue which they could not reasonably have known about at the time, or in instances of fraud or negligence. In fraud or negligence cases, they can re-open cases from up to 20 years ago.

After an HMRC enquiry closes, or after final determination of an issue by the courts, the taxpayer has 30 days to amend their return, and make additional claims and elections, if appropriate, before the assessment becomes final and conclusive. If there is no enquiry, the assessment becomes final and conclusive once the period in which the Revenue may open an enquiry passes.

There is a risk of <a href="double%20taxation">double taxation</a> whenever a company receives income that has already been taxed. This could be <a href="dividend">dividend</a> income, which will have been paid out of the post-tax <a href="Profit%20%28economics%29">profit</a>s of another company and which may have suffered <a href="withholding%20tax">withholding tax</a>. Or it could be because the company itself has suffered foreign tax, perhaps because it conducts part of its trade through an overseas <a href="permanent%20establishment">permanent establishment</a>, or because it receives other types of foreign income.

Double taxation is avoided for UK dividends by exempting them from tax for most companies: only dealers in shares suffer tax on them. Where double taxation arises because of overseas tax suffered, relief is available either in the form of expense or credit relief. Expense relief allows the overseas tax to be treated as a deductible expense in the tax computation. Credit relief is given as a deduction from the UK tax liability, but is restricted to the amount of UK tax suffered on the foreign income. There is a system of onshore pooling, so that overseas tax suffered in high tax territories may be set off against taxable income arising from low tax territories. From 1 July 2009, new rules were introduced to exempt most non-UK dividends from corporation tax so these double taxation rules in respect of non-UK dividends will be of less common application in practice after that date.

Detailed and separate rules apply to how all the different types of losses may be set off within the computations of a company. A detailed explanation of these can be found in: "<a href="United%20Kingdom%20corporation%20tax%20loss%20relief">United Kingdom corporation tax loss relief</a>".

The UK does not permit <a href="tax%20consolidation">tax consolidation</a>, where companies in a group are treated as though they are a single entity for tax purposes. One of the main benefits of tax consolidation is that tax losses in one entity in a group are automatically relievable against the tax profits of another. Instead, the UK permits a form of loss relief called "group relief".

Where a company has losses arising in an accounting period (other than capital losses, or losses arising under Case V or VI of Schedule D) in excess of its other taxable profits for the period, it may surrender these losses to a group member with sufficient taxable profits in the same accounting period.
The company receiving the losses may offset them against their own taxable profits. Exceptions include that a company in the oil and gas extraction industry may not accept group relief against the profits arising on its <a href="oil%20drilling">oil and gas extraction business</a>, and a life assurance company may only accept group relief against its profits chargeable to tax at the standard shareholder rate applicable to that company. Separate rules apply for dual resident companies.

Full group relief is permitted between companies subject to UK corporation tax that are in the same 75% group, where companies have a common ultimate parent, and at least 75% of the shares in each company (other than the ultimate parent) are owned by other companies in the group. The companies making up a 75% group do not all need to be UK-resident or subject to UK corporation tax relief. An <a href="open-ended%20investment%20company">open-ended investment company</a> cannot form part of a group.

Consortium relief is permitted where a company subject to UK corporation tax is owned by a <a href="consortium">consortium</a> of companies that each own at least 5% of the shares and together own at least 75% of the shares. A consortium company can only surrender or accept losses in proportion to how much of that company is owned by each consortium group.

This is an example computation involving a company that has one associate from which it receives £50,000 group relief.
Notes:

Although there are no <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> <a href="European%20Union%20directive">directives</a> dealing with direct taxes, UK laws must comply with European legislation. In particular, legislation should not be discriminatory under the EC treaty.

A number of cases where UK tax laws are believed to be discriminatory have been brought to the <a href="European%20Court%20of%20Justice">European Court of Justice</a>, usually with respect to freedom of establishment and freedom of movement of capital. Key cases which have been decided include:


Also, the case of "ICI v Colmer" led to the UK amending its definition of a group, for group relief purposes. Previously, the definition required that all companies and intermediate parent companies in a group to be UK resident.

There are also a number of other cases making their way, slowly, up to the European Court. In particular:


There have been a number of proposals for corporation tax reform, although only a few have been enacted. In March 2001, the government published a technical note "A Review of Small Business Taxation", which considered simplification of corporation tax for small companies through the closer alignment of their profits for tax purposes with those reported in their accounts. In July of that year, the government also published a consultation document, "Large Business Taxation: the Government's strategy and corporate tax reforms". It set out the strategy for modernising corporate taxes and proposals for relief for <a href="capital%20gain">capital gain</a>s on substantial shareholdings held by companies.

In August 2002, "Reform of corporation tax – A consultation document" was published, outlining initial proposals for the abolition of the Schedular system. This was followed up in August 2003 by "Corporation tax reform – A consultation document", which further discussed the possible abolition of the Schedular system, and also whether the capital allowances (tax depreciation) system should be abolished. It also made proposals that were ultimately enacted in Finance Act 2004. (The first two of these listed below were in response to threats to the UK tax base arising from recent <a href="European%20Court%20of%20Justice">European Court of Justice</a> judgments.) The changes were to:

In December 2004, "Corporation tax reform – a technical note" was published. It outlined the government's decision to abolish the schedular system, replacing the numerous schedules and cases with two pools: a trading and letting pool; and an "everything else" pool. The Government had decided that capital allowances would remain, though there would be some reforms, mostly affecting the leasing industry.

Other main reforms enacted, include:

Miriam Makeba

Zenzile Miriam Makeba (4 March 1932 – 9 November 2008), nicknamed Mama Africa, was a South African singer, songwriter, actress, United Nations <a href="FAO%20Goodwill%20Ambassador">goodwill ambassador</a>, and <a href="civil%20and%20political%20rights">civil-rights</a> activist. Associated with musical genres including <a href="African%20popular%20music">Afropop</a>, <a href="jazz">jazz</a>, and <a href="world%20music">world music</a>, she was an advocate against <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> and white-minority government in South Africa.

Born in <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a> to <a href="Swazi%20people">Swazi</a> and <a href="Xhosa%20people">Xhosa</a> parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognized when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the <a href="Manhattan%20Brothers">Manhattan Brothers</a>, and an all-woman group, <a href="the%20Skylarks%20%28South%20African%20vocal%20group%29">the Skylarks</a>, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film "<a href="Come%20Back%2C%20Africa">Come Back, Africa</a>", which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer <a href="Harry%20Belafonte">Harry Belafonte</a>, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government.

Makeba's career flourished in the United States, and she released several albums and songs, her most popular being "<a href="Pata%20Pata">Pata Pata</a>" (1967). Along with Belafonte she received a Grammy Award for her 1965 album "<a href="An%20Evening%20with%20Belafonte/Makeba">An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba</a>". She testified against the South African government at the United Nations and became involved in the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a>. She married <a href="Stokely%20Carmichael">Stokely Carmichael</a>, a leader of the <a href="Black%20Panther%20Party">Black Panther Party</a>, in 1968. As a result, she lost support among white Americans and faced hostility from the US government, leading her and Carmichael to move to Guinea. She continued to perform, mostly in African countries, including at several <a href="Decolonization%20of%20Africa">independence celebrations</a>. She began to write and perform music more explicitly critical of apartheid; the 1977 song "<a href="Soweto%20Blues">Soweto Blues</a>", written by her former husband <a href="Hugh%20Masekela">Hugh Masekela</a>, was about the <a href="Soweto%20uprising">Soweto uprising</a>. After apartheid was dismantled in 1990, Makeba returned to South Africa. She continued recording and performing, including a 1991 album with <a href="Nina%20Simone">Nina Simone</a> and <a href="Dizzy%20Gillespie">Dizzy Gillespie</a>, and appeared in the 1992 film "<a href="Sarafina%21%20%28film%29">Sarafina!</a>". She was named a UN goodwill ambassador in 1999, and campaigned for humanitarian causes. She died of a heart attack during a 2008 concert in Italy.

Makeba was among the first African musicians to receive worldwide recognition. She brought African music to a Western audience, and popularized the world music and Afropop genres. She also made popular several <a href="music%20in%20the%20movement%20against%20apartheid">songs critical of apartheid</a>, and became a symbol of opposition to the system, particularly after her right to return was revoked. Upon her death, former South African President <a href="Nelson%20Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> said that "her music inspired a powerful sense of hope in all of us."

Zenzile Miriam Makeba was born on 4 March 1932 in the black <a href="township%20%28South%20Africa%29">township</a> of Prospect, near Johannesburg. Her <a href="Swazi%20people">Swazi</a> mother, Christina Makeba, was a "sangoma", or <a href="traditional%20healers%20of%20South%20Africa">traditional healer</a>, and a <a href="domestic%20worker">domestic worker</a>. Her <a href="Xhosa%20people">Xhosa</a> father, Caswell Makeba, was a teacher; he died when she was six years old. Makeba later said that before she was conceived, her mother had been warned that any future pregnancy could be fatal. Neither Miriam nor her mother seemed likely to survive after a difficult labour and delivery. Miriam's grandmother, who attended the birth, often muttered "uzenzile", a <a href="Xhosa%20language">Xhosa</a> word that means "you brought this on yourself", to Miriam's mother during her recovery, which inspired her to give her daughter the name "Zenzile".

When Makeba was eighteen days old, her mother was arrested and sentenced to a six-month prison term for selling <a href="umqombothi">umqombothi</a>, a homemade beer brewed from malt and cornmeal. The family could not afford the small fine required to avoid a jail term, and Miriam spent the first six months of her life in jail. As a child, Makeba sang in the choir of the Kilnerton Training Institute in <a href="Pretoria">Pretoria</a>, an all-black <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> primary school that she attended for eight years. Her talent for singing earned her praise at school. Makeba was <a href="baptism">baptised</a> a <a href="protestant%20church">Protestant</a>, and sang in church choirs, in English, Xhosa, <a href="Sotho%20language">Sotho</a>, and <a href="Zulu%20language">Zulu</a>; she later said that she learned to sing in English before she could speak the language.

The family moved to the <a href="Transvaal%20Province">Transvaal</a> when Makeba was a child. After her father's death, she was forced to find employment; she did domestic work, and worked as a <a href="nanny">nanny</a>. She described herself as a shy person at the time. Her mother worked for <a href="White%20South%20African">white</a> families in Johannesburg, and had to live away from her six children. Makeba lived for a while with her grandmother and a large number of cousins in Pretoria. Makeba was influenced by her family's musical tastes; her mother played several traditional instruments, and her elder brother collected records, including those of <a href="Duke%20Ellington">Duke Ellington</a> and <a href="Ella%20Fitzgerald">Ella Fitzgerald</a>, and taught Makeba songs. Her father played the piano, and his musical inclination was later a factor in Makeba's family accepting what was seen as a risque choice of career.

In 1949, Makeba married James Kubay, a policeman in training, with whom she had her only child, <a href="Bongi%20Makeba">Bongi Makeba</a>, in 1950. Makeba was then diagnosed with <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a>, and her husband, who was said to have beaten her, left her shortly afterwards, after a two-year marriage. A decade later she overcame cervical cancer via a <a href="hysterectomy">hysterectomy</a>.

Makeba began her professional musical career with the Cuban Brothers, a South African all-male <a href="close%20harmony">close harmony</a> group, with whom she sang covers of popular American songs. Soon afterwards, at the age of 21, she joined a jazz group, the <a href="Manhattan%20Brothers">Manhattan Brothers</a>, who sang a mixture of <a href="music%20of%20South%20Africa">South African songs</a> and pieces from popular <a href="African-American%20music">African-American groups</a>. Makeba was the only woman in the group. With the Manhattan Brothers she recorded her first hit, "Laku Tshoni Ilanga", in 1953, and developed a national reputation as a musician. In 1956 she joined a new all-woman group, <a href="the%20Skylarks%20%28South%20African%20vocal%20group%29">the Skylarks</a>, singing a blend of jazz and traditional South African melodies. Formed by <a href="Gallotone%20Records">Gallotone Records</a>, the group was also known as the Sunbeams. Makeba sang with the Skylarks when the Manhattan Brothers were travelling abroad; later, she also travelled with the Manhattan Brothers. In the Skylarks, Makeba sang alongside <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Rhodesian</a>-born musician <a href="Dorothy%20Masuka">Dorothy Masuka</a>, whose music Makeba had followed, along with that of <a href="Dolly%20Rathebe">Dolly Rathebe</a>. Several of the Skylarks' pieces from this period became popular; the music historian Rob Allingham later described the group as "real trendsetters, with harmonisation that had never been heard before." Makeba received no royalties from her work with the Skylarks.

While performing with the Manhattan Brothers in 1955, Makeba met the young lawyer <a href="Nelson%20Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>; he later remembered the meeting, and that he felt that the girl he met "was going to be someone." In 1956, <a href="Gallo%20Record%20Company">Gallotone Records</a> released "<a href="Lovely%20Lies">Lovely Lies</a>", Makeba's first solo success; the Xhosa lyric about a man looking for his beloved in jails and hospitals was replaced with the unrelated and innocuous line "You tell such lovely lies with your two lovely eyes" in the English version. The record became the first South African record to chart on the United States <a href="Billboard%20Top%20100">Billboard Top 100</a>. In 1957, Makeba was featured on the cover of "<a href="Drum%20%28South%20African%20magazine%29">Drum</a>" magazine.

In 1959, Makeba sang the lead female role in the <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a>-inspired South African jazz opera "<a href="King%20Kong%20%281959%20musical%29">King Kong</a>"; among those in the cast was the musician <a href="Hugh%20Masekela">Hugh Masekela</a>. The musical was performed to racially integrated audiences, raising her profile among white South Africans. Also in 1959, she had a short guest appearance in "<a href="Come%20Back%2C%20Africa">Come Back, Africa</a>", an anti-apartheid film produced and directed by the American independent filmmaker <a href="Lionel%20Rogosin">Lionel Rogosin</a>. Rogosin cast her after seeing her on stage in "African Jazz and Variety" show, on which Makeba was a performer for 18 months. The film blended elements of documentary and fiction and had to be filmed in secret as the government was expected to be hostile to it. Makeba appeared on stage, and sang two songs: her appearance lasted four minutes. The <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo</a> made an enormous impression on viewers, and Rogosin organised a visa for her to attend the <a href="premiere">premiere</a> of the film at the twenty-fourth <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a> in Italy, where the film won the prestigious Critics' Choice Award. Makeba's presence has been described as crucial to the film, as an emblem of cosmopolitan black identity that also connected with working-class black people due to the dialogue being in Zulu.

Makeba's role in "Come Back, Africa" brought her international recognition and she travelled to London and New York to perform. In London she met the American singer <a href="Harry%20Belafonte">Harry Belafonte</a>, who became her mentor, helping her with her first solo recordings. These included "<a href="Pata%20Pata">Pata Pata</a>", which would be released many years later, and a version of the traditional Xhosa song "<a href="The%20Click%20Song">Qongqothwane</a>", which she had first performed with the Skylarks. Though "Pata Pata"—described by <a href="Musician%20%28magazine%29">"Musician" magazine</a> as a "groundbreaking Afropop gem"—became her most famous song, Makeba described it as "one of my most insignificant songs". While in England, she married Sonny Pillay, a South African ballad singer of Indian descent; they divorced within a few months.

Makeba then moved to New York, making her US music debut on 1 November 1959 on "<a href="The%20Steve%20Allen%20Show">The Steve Allen Show</a>" in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> for a television audience of 60 million. Her New York debut at the <a href="Village%20Vanguard">Village Vanguard</a> occurred soon after; she sang in Xhosa and Zulu, and performed a <a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a> folk song. Her audience at this concert included <a href="Miles%20Davis">Miles Davis</a> and Duke Ellington; her performance received strongly positive reviews from critics. She first came to popular and critical attention in jazz clubs, after which her reputation grew rapidly. Belafonte, who had helped Makeba with her move to the US, handled the logistics for her first performances. When she first moved to the US, Makeba lived in <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>, along with other musicians and actors. As was common in her profession, she experienced some financial insecurity, and worked as a <a href="babysitting">babysitter</a> for a period.

Soon after the <a href="Sharpeville%20massacre">Sharpeville massacre</a> in 1960, Makeba learned that her mother had died. When she tried to return home for the funeral, she found that her South African passport had been cancelled. Two of Makeba's family members were killed in the massacre. The incident left her concerned about her family, many of whom were still in South Africa, including her daughter: the nine-year-old Bongi joined her mother in the US in August 1960. During her first few years in the US, Makeba had rarely sung explicitly political music, but her popularity had led to an increase in awareness of apartheid and the anti-apartheid movement. Following the Sharpeville killings, Makeba felt a responsibility to help, as she had been able to leave the country while others had not. From this point, she became an increasingly outspoken critic of apartheid and the white-minority government; before the massacre, she had taken care to avoid overtly political statements in South Africa.

Her musical career in the US continued to flourish. She signed with the recording label <a href="RCA%20Records">RCA Victor</a>, and released "<a href="Miriam%20Makeba%20%28album%29">Miriam Makeba</a>", her first studio album, in 1960, backed by Belafonte's band. RCA chose to buy out Makeba's contract with Gallotone Records, and despite the fact that Makeba was unable to perform in South Africa, Gallotone received US$45,000 in the deal, which meant that Makeba received no royalties for her debut album. The album included one of her most famous hits in the US, "Qongqothwane", which was known in English as "The Click Song" because Makeba's audiences could not pronounce the Xhosa name. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine called her the "most exciting new singing talent to appear in many years", and "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" compared her voice to "the smoky tones and delicate phrasing" of Ella Fitzgerald and the "intimate warmth" of <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>. The album was not commercially successful, and Makeba was briefly dropped from the RCA label: she was re-signed soon after as the label recognised the commercial possibilities of the growing interest in African culture. Her South African identity had been downplayed during her first signing, but it was strongly emphasised the second time to take advantage of this interest. Makeba made several appearances on television, often in the company of Belafonte. In 1962, Makeba and Belafonte sang at the birthday party for US President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a>, but Makeba did not go to the party afterwards because she was ill. Kennedy nevertheless insisted on meeting her, so Belafonte sent a car to pick her up.

In 1964, Makeba released her second studio album for RCA, "The World of Miriam Makeba". An early example of <a href="world%20music">world music</a>, the album peaked at number eighty-six on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. Makeba's music had a cross-racial appeal in the US; white Americans were attracted to her image as an "exotic" African performer, and black Americans related their own experiences of <a href="racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States">racial segregation</a> to Makeba's struggle against apartheid. Makeba found company among other African exiles and émigrés in New York, including Hugh Masekela, to whom she was married from 1963 to 1968. During their marriage, Makeba and Masekela were neighbours of the jazz musician <a href="Dizzy%20Gillespie">Dizzy Gillespie</a> in <a href="Englewood%2C%20New%20Jersey">Englewood, New Jersey</a>; they spent much of their time in <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a>. She also came to know actors <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a> and <a href="Lauren%20Bacall">Lauren Bacall</a>, and musicians <a href="Louis%20Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</a> and <a href="Ray%20Charles">Ray Charles</a>. Fellow singer-activist <a href="Nina%20Simone">Nina Simone</a> became friendly with Makeba, as did actor <a href="Cicely%20Tyson">Cicely Tyson</a>; Makeba and Simone performed together at <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a>. Makeba was among black entertainers, activists, and intellectuals in New York at the time who believed that the civil rights movement and popular culture could reinforce each other, creating "a sense of intertwined political and cultural vibrancy"; other examples included <a href="Maya%20Angelou">Maya Angelou</a> and <a href="Sidney%20Poitier">Sidney Poitier</a>. She later described her difficulty living with racial segregation, saying "There wasn't much difference in America; it was a country that had abolished slavery but there was apartheid in its own way."

Makeba's music was also popular in Europe, and she travelled and performed there frequently. Acting on the advice of Belafonte, she added songs from Latin America, Europe, Israel, and elsewhere in Africa to her repertoire. She visited Kenya in 1962 in support of <a href="Kenyan%20Independence">the country's independence</a> from British colonial rule, and raised funds for its independence leader <a href="Jomo%20Kenyatta">Jomo Kenyatta</a>. Later that year she testified before the <a href="United%20Nations%20Special%20Committee%20against%20Apartheid">United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid</a> about the effects of the system, asking for economic sanctions against South Africa's <a href="National%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29">National Party</a> government. She requested an arms embargo against South Africa, on the basis that weapons sold to the government would likely be used against black women and children. As a result, her music was banned in South Africa, and her South African citizenship and right to return were revoked. Makeba thus became a <a href="statelessness">stateless person</a>, but she was soon issued passports by Algeria, Guinea, Belgium and Ghana. In her life, she held nine passports, and was granted honorary citizenship in ten countries.

Soon after her testimony, <a href="Haile%20Selassie">Haile Selassie</a>, the emperor of Ethiopia, invited her to sing at the inauguration of the <a href="Organisation%20of%20African%20Unity">Organisation of African Unity</a>, the only performer to be invited. As the fact of her ban from South Africa became well known she became a "cause célébre" for Western <a href="liberalism">liberals</a>, and her presence in the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a> provided a link between that movement and the anti-apartheid struggle. In 1964 she was taught the song "<a href="Malaika">Malaika</a>" by a Kenyan student while backstage at a performance in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>; the song later became a staple of her performances.

Throughout the 1960s, Makeba strengthened her involvement with a range of black-centred political movements, including the civil rights, anti-apartheid, <a href="Black%20Consciousness%20Movement">Black Consciousness</a>, and <a href="Black%20Power%20movement">Black Power</a> movements. She briefly met the Trinidadian-American activist <a href="Stokely%20Carmichael">Stokely Carmichael</a>—the leader of the <a href="Student%20Nonviolent%20Coordinating%20Committee">Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee</a> and a prominent figure in the <a href="Black%20Panther%20Party">Black Panther Party</a>—after Belafonte invited him to one of Makeba's concerts; they met again in <a href="Conakry">Conakry</a> six years later. They entered a relationship, initially kept secret from all but their closest friends and family. Makeba participated in fundraising activities for various civil rights groups, including a benefit concert for the 1962 <a href="Southern%20Christian%20Leadership%20Conference">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a> that civil rights activist <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> referred to as the "event of the year". Following a concert and rally in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> in support of King, Makeba and others were denied entrance to a restaurant as a result of <a href="Jim%20Crow%20laws">Jim Crow laws</a>, leading to a televised protest in front of the establishment. She also criticised King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference for its investment in South African companies, informing press that "Now my friend of long standing supports the country's persecution of my people and I must find a new idol". Her identity as an African woman in the civil rights movement helped create "an emerging liberal consensus" that extreme racial discrimination, whether domestically or internationally, was harmful. In 1964 she testified at the UN for a second time, quoting a song by <a href="Vanessa%20Redgrave">Vanessa Redgrave</a> in calling for quick action against the South African government.

On 15 March 1966, Makeba and Belafonte received the <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Ethnic%20or%20Traditional%20Folk%20Recording">Best Folk Recording</a> for "<a href="An%20Evening%20with%20Belafonte/Makeba">An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba</a>". The album dealt with the political plight of black South Africans under apartheid, including several songs critical of the South African government, such as "Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd" ("Watch our Verwoerd", a reference to <a href="Hendrik%20Verwoerd">Hendrik Verwoerd</a>, one of the architects of apartheid). It sold widely and raised Makeba's profile in the US; Belafonte and Makeba's concert tour following its release was often sold out, and the album has been described as the best they made together. Makeba's use of lyrics in <a href="Swahili%20language">Swahili</a>, Xhosa, and Sotho led to her being seen as a representation of an "authentic" Africa by American audiences. In 1967, more than ten years after she first recorded the song, the single "Pata Pata" was released in the US on an album of the same title, and became a worldwide hit. During its recording, she and Belafonte had a disagreement, after which they stopped recording together.

Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. <a href="Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States">Conservatives</a> came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the <a href="The%20Bahamas">Bahamas</a>, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.

Guinea remained Makeba's home for the next 15 years, and she and her husband became close to President <a href="Ahmed%20S%C3%A9kou%20Tour%C3%A9">Ahmed Sékou Touré</a> and his wife, Andrée. Touré wanted to create a new style of African music, and all musicians received a <a href="minimum%20wage">minimum wage</a> if they practised for several hours every day. Makeba later stated that "I've never seen a country that did what Sékou Touré did for artists." After her rejection from the US she began to write music more directly critical of the US government's racial policies, recording and singing songs such as "<a href="Lumumba%20%28song%29">Lumumba</a>" in 1970, (referring to <a href="Patrice%20Lumumba">Patrice Lumumba</a>, the assassinated Prime Minister of <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo%20%28L%C3%A9opoldville%29">the Congo</a>), and "<a href="Malcolm%20X%20%28song%29">Malcolm X</a>" in 1974.

Makeba performed more frequently in African countries, and as countries became independent of European colonial powers, was invited to sing at independence ceremonies, including in Kenya, Angola, Zambia, Tanganyika, and Mozambique. In September 1974 she performed alongside a multitude of well-known African and American musicians at the <a href="Zaire%2074">Zaire 74</a> festival in <a href="Kinshasa">Kinshasa</a>, <a href="Zaire">Zaire</a> (formerly the Congo). She also became a diplomat for Ghana, and was appointed Guinea's official delegate to the UN in 1975; that year, she addressed the <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a>. She continued to perform in Europe and Asia, as well as her African concerts, but not in the US, where a "de facto" boycott was in effect. Her performances in Africa were immensely popular: she was described as the highlight of <a href="FESTAC%2077">FESTAC 77</a>, a <a href="Pan-Africanism">Pan-African</a> arts festival in Nigeria in 1977, and during a Liberian performance of "Pata Pata", the stadium proved so loud that she was unable to complete the song. "Pata Pata", like her other songs, had been banned in South Africa. Another song she sang frequently in this period was "<a href="Nkosi%20Sikelel%27%20iAfrika">Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika</a>", though she never recorded it. Makeba later stated that it was during this period that she accepted the label "Mama Africa".

In 1976, the South African government replaced English with <a href="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> as the medium of instruction in all schools, setting off the <a href="Soweto%20uprising">Soweto uprising</a>. Between 15,000 and 20,000 students took part; caught unprepared, the police opened fire on the protesting children, killing hundreds and injuring over a thousand. Hugh Masekela wrote "<a href="Soweto%20Blues">Soweto Blues</a>" in response to the massacre, and the song was performed by Makeba, becoming a staple of her live performances for many years. A review in the magazine "<a href="Musician%20%28magazine%29">Musician</a>" said that the song had "searingly righteous lyrics" about the uprising that "cut to the bone". She had separated from Carmichael in 1973; in 1978 they divorced and in 1980 she married Bageot Bah, an airline executive.

Makeba's daughter Bongi, who was a singer in her own right and had often accompanied her mother on stage, died in childbirth in 1985. Makeba was left responsible for her two grandchildren, and decided to move out of Guinea. She settled in the <a href="Woluwe-Saint-Lambert">Woluwe-Saint-Lambert</a> district of the Belgian capital <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>. In the following year, Masekela introduced Makeba to <a href="Paul%20Simon">Paul Simon</a>, and a few months later she embarked on Simon's very successful <a href="Graceland%20%28album%29">Graceland Tour</a>. The tour concluded with two concerts held in <a href="Harare">Harare</a>, Zimbabwe, which were filmed in 1987 for release as "Graceland: The African Concert". After touring the world with Simon, <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros. Records</a> signed Makeba and she released "<a href="Sangoma%20%28Miriam%20Makeba%20album%29">Sangoma</a>" ("Healer"), an album of healing chants named in honour of her "sangoma" mother. Her involvement with Simon caused controversy: "Graceland" had been recorded in South Africa, breaking the cultural boycott of the country, and thus Makeba's participation in the tour was regarded as contravening the boycott (which Makeba herself endorsed).

In preparation for the Graceland tour, she worked with journalist James Hall to write an autobiography titled "Makeba: My Story". The book contained descriptions of her experience with apartheid, and was also critical of the commodification and consumerism she experienced in the US. The book was translated into five languages. She took part in the <a href="Nelson%20Mandela%2070th%20Birthday%20Tribute">Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute</a>, a popular-music concert staged on 11 June 1988 at London's <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>, and broadcast to an audience of 600 million across 67 countries. Political aspects of the concert were heavily censored in the US by the <a href="Fox%20News">Fox television network</a>. The use of music to raise awareness of apartheid paid off: a survey after the concert found that among people aged between 16 and 24, three-quarters knew of Mandela, and supported his release from prison.

Following growing pressure from the anti-apartheid movement both <a href="internal%20resistance%20to%20apartheid">domestically</a> and internationally, in 1990 State President <a href="F.%20W.%20de%20Klerk">Frederik Willem de Klerk</a> reversed the ban on the <a href="African%20National%20Congress">African National Congress</a> and other anti-apartheid organisations, and announced that Mandela would shortly be released from prison. Mandela was released in February 1990. He persuaded Makeba to return to South Africa, which she did, using her French passport, on 10 June 1990.
Makeba, Gillespie, Simone, and Masekela recorded and released her studio album, "<a href="Eyes%20on%20Tomorrow">Eyes on Tomorrow</a>", in 1991. It combined jazz, <a href="Rhythm%20and%20blues">R&B</a>, <a href="Pop%20music">pop</a>, and traditional African music, and was a hit across Africa. Makeba and Gillespie then toured the world together to promote it. In November she made a guest appearance on a US sitcom, "<a href="The%20Cosby%20Show">The Cosby Show</a>". In 1992, she starred in the film "<a href="Sarafina%21%20%28film%29">Sarafina!</a>", which centred on students involved in the 1976 Soweto uprising. Makeba portrayed the title character's mother, Angelina, a role which "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described as having been performed with "immense dignity".

On 16 October 1999, Makeba was named a <a href="FAO%20Goodwill%20Ambassador">Goodwill Ambassador</a> of the <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> of the United Nations. In January 2000, her album, "<a href="Homeland%20%28Miriam%20Makeba%20album%29">Homeland</a>", produced by the New York City based <a href="record%20label">record label</a> <a href="Putumayo%20World%20Music">Putumayo World Music</a>, was nominated for a Grammy Award in the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20World%20Music%20Album">Best World Music Album</a> category. She worked closely with <a href="Gra%C3%A7a%20Machel">Graça Machel-Mandela</a>, the South African first lady, advocating for children suffering from <a href="AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a>, <a href="Military%20use%20of%20children">child soldiers</a>, and the <a href="Disability">physically handicapped</a>. She established the Makeba Centre for Girls, a home for orphans, described in an obituary as her most personal project. She also took part in the 2002 documentary "", which examined the struggles of black South Africans against apartheid through the music of the period. Makeba's second autobiography, "Makeba: The Miriam Makeba Story", was published in 2004. In 2005 she announced that she would retire and began a farewell tour, but despite having <a href="osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</a>, continued to perform until her death. During this period, her grandchildren Nelson Lumumba Lee and Zenzi Lee, and her great-grandchild Lindelani, occasionally joined her performances.

On 9 November 2008, Makeba fell ill during a concert in <a href="Castel%20Volturno">Castel Volturno</a>, near <a href="Caserta">Caserta</a>, Italy. The concert had been organised to support the writer <a href="Roberto%20Saviano">Roberto Saviano</a> in his stand against the <a href="Camorra">Camorra</a>, a criminal organisation active in the <a href="Campania">Campania</a> region. She suffered a heart attack after singing her hit song "Pata Pata", and was taken to the Pineta Grande clinic, where doctors were unable to revive her.

The groups with which Makeba began her career performed "<a href="mbube%20%28genre%29">mbube</a>", a style of vocal harmony which drew on American jazz, <a href="ragtime">ragtime</a>, and <a href="Anglican%20church">Anglican church</a> hymns, as well as indigenous styles of music. Johannesburg musician Dolly Rathebe was an early influence on Makeba's music, as were female jazz singers from the US. Historian David Coplan writes that the "African jazz" made popular by Makeba and others was "inherently hybridized" rather than derivative of any particular genre, blending as it did <a href="marabi">marabi</a> and jazz, and was "Americanized African music, not Africanized American music". The music that she performed was described by British writer <a href="Robin%20Denselow">Robin Denselow</a> as a "unique blend of rousing township styles and jazz-influenced balladry".

Makeba released more than 30 albums during her career. The dominant styles of these shifted over time, moving from African jazz to recordings influenced by Belafonte's "crooning" to music drawing from traditional South African musical forms. She has been associated with the genres of world music and <a href="African%20popular%20music">Afropop</a>. She also incorporated Latin American musical styles into her performances. Historian <a href="Ruth%20Feldstein">Ruth Feldstein</a> described her music as "[crossing] the borders between what many people associated with avant-garde and 'quality' culture and the commercial mainstream"; the latter aspect often drew criticism. She was able to appeal to audiences from many political, racial, and national backgrounds.

She was known for having a dynamic vocal range, and was described as having an emotional awareness during her performances. She occasionally danced during her shows, and was described as having a sensuous presence on stage. She was able to vary her voice considerably: an obituary remarked that she "could soar like an opera singer, but she could also whisper, roar, hiss, growl and shout. She could sing while making the epiglottal clicks of the Xhosa language." She sang in English and several African languages, but never in Afrikaans, the language of the apartheid government in South Africa. She once stated "When Afrikaaners sing in my language, then I will sing theirs." English was seen as the language of political resistance by black South Africans due to the educational barriers they faced under apartheid; the Manhattan Brothers, with whom Makeba had sung in Sophiatown, had been prohibited from recording in English. Her songs in African languages have been described as reaffirming black pride.

Makeba said that she did not perform political music, but music about her personal life in South Africa, which included describing the pain she felt living under apartheid. She once stated "people say I sing politics, but what I sing is not politics, it is the truth", an example of the mixing of personal and political issues for musicians living during apartheid. When she first entered the US, she avoided discussing apartheid explicitly, partly out of concern for her family still in South Africa. Nonetheless, she is known for using her voice to convey the political message of opposition to apartheid, performing widely and frequently for civil rights and anti-apartheid organisations. Even songs that did not carry an explicitly political message were seen as subversive, due to their being banned in South Africa. Makeba saw her music as a tool of activism, saying "In our struggle, songs are not simply entertainment for us. They are the way we communicate."

Makeba's use of the <a href="click%20consonant">click</a>s common in languages such as Xhosa and Zulu (as in "Qongqothwane", "The Click Song") was frequently remarked upon by Western audiences. It contributed to her popularity and her exotic image, which scholars have described as a kind of <a href="othering">othering</a>, exacerbated by the fact that Western audiences often could not understand her lyrics. Critics in the US described her as the "African tribeswoman" and as an "import from South Africa", often depicting her in condescending terms as a product of a more primitive society. Commentators also frequently described her in terms of the prominent men she was associated with, despite her own prominence. During her early career in South Africa she had been seen as a <a href="sex%20symbol">sex symbol</a>, an image that received considerably less attention in the US.

Makeba was described as a style icon, both in her home country and the US. She wore no makeup and refused to straighten her hair for shows, thus helping establish a style that came to be known internationally as the "<a href="Afro">Afro look</a>". According to music scholar Tanisha Ford, her hairstyle represented a "liberated African beauty aesthetic". She was seen as a beauty icon by South African schoolgirls, who were compelled to shorten their hair by the apartheid government. Makeba stuck to wearing African jewellery; she disapproved of the skin-lighteners common among South African women at the time, and refused to appear in advertisements for them. Her self-presentation has been characterised by scholars as a rejection of the predominantly white standards of beauty that women in the US were held to, which allowed Makeba to partially escape the sexualisation directed at women performers during this period. Nonetheless, the terms used to describe her in the US media have been identified by scholars as frequently used to "sexualize, infantalize, and animalize" people of African heritage.

Makeba was among the most visible Africans in the US; as a result, she was often emblematic of the continent of Africa for Americans. Her music earned her the moniker "Mama Africa", and she was variously described as the "Empress of African Song", the "Queen of South African music", and Africa's "first superstar". Music scholar J. U. Jacobs said that Makeba's music had "both been shaped by and given shape to black South African and American music". The jazz musician <a href="Abbey%20Lincoln">Abbey Lincoln</a> is among those identified as being influenced by Makeba. Makeba and Simone were among a group of artists who helped shape <a href="soul%20music">soul music</a>. Longtime collaborator Belafonte called her "the most revolutionary new talent to appear in any medium in the last decade". Speaking after her death, Mandela called her "South Africa's first lady of song", and said that "her music inspired a powerful sense of hope in all of us."

Outside her home country Makeba was credited with bringing African music to a Western audience, and along with artists such as <a href="Youssou%20N%27Dour">Youssou N'Dour</a>, <a href="Salif%20Keita">Salif Keita</a>, <a href="Ali%20Farka%20Tour%C3%A9">Ali Farka Touré</a>, <a href="Baaba%20Maal">Baaba Maal</a> and <a href="Ang%C3%A9lique%20Kidjo">Angélique Kidjo</a>, with popularising the genre of world music. Her work with Belafonte in the 1960s has been described as creating the genre of world music before the concept entered the popular imagination, and also as highlighting the diversity and cultural pluralism within African music. Within South Africa, Makeba has been described as influencing artists such as <a href="kwaito">kwaito</a> musician <a href="Thandiswa%20Mazwai">Thandiswa Mazwai</a> and her band <a href="Bongo%20Maffin">Bongo Maffin</a>, whose track "De Makeba" was a modified version of Makeba's "Pata Pata", and one of several tribute recordings released after her return to South Africa. South African jazz musician <a href="Simphiwe%20Dana">Simphiwe Dana</a> has been described as "the new Miriam Makeba". South African singer <a href="Lira%20%28singer%29">Lira</a> has frequently been compared with Makeba, particularly for her performance of "Pata Pata" during the opening ceremony of the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010 Football World Cup</a>. A year later, Kidjo dedicated her concert in New York to Makeba, as a musician who had "paved the way for her success". In an obituary, scholar Lara Allen referred to Makeba as "arguably South Africa's most famous musical export". In 2016 the French singer <a href="Jain%20%28singer%29">Jain</a> released <a href="Makeba%20%28song%29">"Makeba"</a>, a tribute.

Makeba was among the most visible people campaigning against the apartheid system in South Africa, and was responsible for popularising several <a href="Music%20in%20the%20movement%20against%20apartheid">anti-apartheid songs</a>, including "<a href="Meadowlands%20%28song%29">Meadowlands</a>" by Strike Vilakezi and "<a href="Ndodemnyama%20we%20Verwoerd">Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd</a>" (Watch out, Verwoerd) by <a href="Vuyisile%20Mini">Vuyisile Mini</a>. Due to her high profile, she became a spokesperson of sorts for Africans living under oppressive governments, and in particular for black South Africans living under apartheid. When the South African government prevented her from entering her home country, she became a symbol of "apartheid's cruelty", and she used her position as a celebrity by testifying against apartheid before the UN in 1962 and 1964. Many of her songs were banned within South Africa, leading to Makeba's records being distributed underground, and even her apolitical songs being seen as subversive. She thus became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government both within and outside South Africa. In an interview in 2000, Masekela said that "there [was] nobody in Africa who made the world more aware of what was happening in South Africa than Miriam Makeba."

Makeba has also been associated with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the <a href="Pan-Africanism">Pan-African movement</a>. She called for unity between black people of African descent across the world: "Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere. The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. The Black people are the victims of capitalism, racism and oppression, period". After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael's message that "<a href="black%20is%20beautiful">black is beautiful</a>". Along with performers such as Simone, <a href="Lena%20Horne">Lena Horne</a>, and Abbey Lincoln, she used her position as a prominent musician to advocate for civil rights. Their activism has been described as simultaneously calling attention to racial and gender disparities, and highlighting "that the liberation they desired could not separate race from sex". Makeba's critique of <a href="second-wave%20feminism">second-wave feminism</a> as being the product of luxury led to observers being unwilling to call her a feminist. Scholar Ruth Feldstein stated that Makeba and others influenced both <a href="black%20feminism">black feminism</a> and second-wave feminism through their advocacy, and the historian Jacqueline Castledine referred to her as one of the "most steadfast voices for social justice".

Makeba's 1965 collaboration with Harry Belafonte won a Grammy Award, making her the first African recording artist to win this award. Makeba shared the 2001 <a href="Polar%20Music%20Prize">Polar Music Prize</a> with <a href="Sofia%20Gubaidulina">Sofia Gubaidulina</a>. They received their prize from <a href="Carl%20XVI%20Gustaf%20of%20Sweden">Carl XVI Gustaf</a>, the <a href="King%20of%20Sweden">King of Sweden</a>, during a nationally televised ceremony at <a href="Berwaldhallen">Berwaldhallen</a>, Stockholm, on 27 May 2002.
She won the <a href="Dag%20Hammarskj%C3%B6ld">Dag Hammarskjöld</a> Peace Prize in 1986, and in 2001 was awarded the <a href="Otto%20Hahn%20Peace%20Medal">Otto Hahn Peace Medal in Gold</a> by the <a href="United%20Nations%20Association">United Nations Association of Germany</a> (DGVN) in Berlin, "for outstanding services to peace and international understanding". She also received several honorary doctorates. In 2004, she was voted 38th in a poll ranking 100 <a href="Great%20South%20Africans">Great South Africans</a>.

"Mama Africa", a musical about Makeba, was produced in South Africa by Niyi Coker. Originally titled "Zenzi!", the musical premiered to a sold-out crowd in Cape Town on 26 May 2016. It was performed in the US in <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>, Missouri and at the <a href="Skirball%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts">Skirball Center for the Performing Arts</a> in New York City between October and December 2016. The musical returned to South Africa in February 2017 for what would have been Makeba's 85th birthday.
From 25 to 27 September 2009, a tribute television show to Makeba entitled "Hommage à Miriam Makeba" and curated by <a href="Benin">Benin</a>oise singer-songwriter and activist <a href="Ang%C3%A9lique%20Kidjo">Angélique Kidjo</a>, was held at the <a href="Cirque%20d%27hiver">Cirque d'hiver</a> in Paris. The show was presented as "Mama Africa: Celebrating Miriam Makeba" at the <a href="Barbican%20Centre">Barbican</a> in London on 21 November 2009. A <a href="documentary%20film">documentary film</a> titled "Mama Africa", about Makeba's life, co-written and directed by Finnish <a href="film%20director">director</a> <a href="Mika%20Kaurism%C3%A4ki">Mika Kaurismäki</a>, was released in 2011. On 4 March 2013, and again on <a href="International%20Women%27s%20Day">International Women's Day</a> in 2017, Google honoured her with a <a href="Google%20Doodle">Google Doodle</a> on their homepage.
In 2014 she was honoured (along with <a href="Nelson%20Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>, <a href="Albertina%20Sisulu">Albertina Sisulu</a> and <a href="Steve%20Biko">Steve Biko</a>) in the Belgian city of <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a>, which named a square after her, the "Miriam Makebaplein".

This is a list of albums and songs, including <a href="Cover%20version">covers</a>, by Miriam Makeba that have received significant mention in commentary about her or about the musical and political movements she participated in.

Valley Parade

Valley Parade, also known as the Northern Commercials Stadium through <a href="sponsor%20%28commercial%29">sponsorship</a> rights, is an <a href="all-seater">all-seater</a> <a href="association%20football">football</a> stadium in <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a>, <a href="West%20Yorkshire">West Yorkshire</a>, England. It was built in 1886, and was the home of <a href="Manningham%20F.C.">Manningham Rugby Football Club</a> until 1903, when they changed code from <a href="rugby%20league">rugby football</a> to association football and became <a href="Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.">Bradford City</a>. It has been Bradford City's home since, although it is now owned by former chairman <a href="Gordon%20Gibb">Gordon Gibb</a>'s pension fund. It has also been home to <a href="Bradford%20Park%20Avenue%20A.F.C.">Bradford (Park Avenue)</a> for one season, and <a href="Bradford%20Bulls">Bradford Bulls</a> rugby league side for two seasons, as well as host to a number of <a href="England%20national%20youth%20football%20team">England youth team</a> fixtures.

Football architect <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a> was commissioned to redevelop the ground when Bradford City were promoted to the <a href="Football%20League%20Division%20One">First Division</a> in 1908. From then, the stadium underwent few changes until 1985, when it was the scene of a <a href="Bradford%20City%20stadium%20fire">fatal fire</a> on 11 May 1985, when 56 supporters were killed and at least 265 were injured. It underwent a <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>2.6 million redevelopment and was re-opened in December 1986. The ground underwent significant changes in the 1990s, and early 2000s, and now has a capacity of 25,136. The record attendance of 39,146 was set in 1911 for an <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> tie against <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a>, making it the oldest surviving attendance record at a <a href="The%20Football%20League">Football League</a> ground in the country. The highest attendance at Valley Parade, as it is now, was against Reading in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20FA%20Cup%23Sixth%20Round%20Proper">2015 FA Cup Quarter-finals</a>.

<a href="Manningham%20F.C.">Manningham Rugby Football Club</a>, formed in 1876, originally played games at Cardigan Fields, in the Carlisle Road area of <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a>. When their ground was sold to facilitate the construction of Drummond School, the club required a new home. Consequently, they bought one-third of the Valley Parade site in <a href="Manningham%2C%20Bradford">Manningham</a>, taking a short-term lease out on the rest of the land in time to play there for the 1886–87 season. The new ground and the road it was built upon both adopted the name of the local area, "Valley Parade", a name deriving from the steep hillside below Manningham. The land was previously a <a href="quarry">quarry</a>, and formed part of a greater site owned by Midland Railway Company.

The club spent <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>1,400 appointing designers to oversee the excavation and levelling of the land, and moved a one-year-old stand from Carlisle Road to the highest part of the new ground. The original ground comprised the relocated stand, a 2,000-capacity stepped enclosure with the players' <a href="Changeroom">changing rooms</a> beneath the stand, the playing area, a <a href="track%20and%20field%20athletics">cinder athletics track</a> and fencing to limit the total capacity to 18,000. The playing field was made of <a href="track%20ballast">ballast</a>, ashes, soil and sods. The ground was officially opened on 27 September 1886 for a game against <a href="Wakefield%20Trinity">Wakefield Trinity</a> which was watched by a capacity crowd, but construction work meant most of Manningham's early games were away fixtures.
Manningham RFC continued playing until 1903, when financial difficulties, caused by relegation at the turn of the century, prompted club officials to change codes from <a href="rugby%20league">rugby football</a> to association football. The first association football game to be played at Valley Parade was a promotional fixture on 6 April 1903 between a side of West Yorkshire footballers and <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>'s <a href="1903%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1903 FA Cup</a> winning side. The game had been organised to stimulate interest in the sport in Bradford and attracted 8,000 fans. The new football club, <a href="Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.">Bradford City</a>, were elected to <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a>'s <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Division Two</a> the following month. Bradford City's first game at Valley Parade came on 5 September 1903 against <a href="Gainsborough%20Trinity%20F.C.">Gainsborough Trinity</a>, drawing a crowd of 11,000. As a result of alterations first implemented in 1897, City players originally changed in a shed behind one end of the ground, and visiting teams used the old rugby club dressing rooms at the back of the nearby Belle Vue Hotel. However, after City's 5–1 defeat by <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> on 10 February 1906, United player <a href="Bob%20Bonthron">Bob Bonthron</a> was attacked as he left the ground. As a result, <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> closed the ground for 14 days, ordering City to switch its changing rooms to the nearby Artillery Barracks for the <a href="1906%E2%80%9307%20in%20English%20football">1906–07</a> season. Several supporters faced criminal proceedings for the incident.

After Bradford City won the Division Two championship in <a href="1907%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">1907–08</a>, the club hurried through a reconstruction programme of the ground to prepare for the club's first season in <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Division One</a>. Football architect <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a> was commissioned to design new <a href="terrace%20%28stadium%29">terracing</a> in the paddock—a standing area in front of the 5,300-seater main stand which was built in 1908—and build a <a href="Spion%20Kop%20%28stadia%29">Spion Kop</a> at the north side of the ground and an 8,000-capacity stand at the Midland Road end opposite the main stand. Further work was performed to lower the railings, erect barriers, move the pitch and add extra <a href="turnstile">turnstile</a>s. The changing rooms were also moved, with a tunnel leading from the rooms underneath the Kop along the main stand side of the ground. The total project cost £9,958, and raised the capacity to 40,000. The work was not completed until midway through the <a href="1908%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football">1908–09 season</a>. The first match after work was finished took place on Christmas Day 1908, when 36,000 fans saw City host <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a>. The improvements allowed Bradford City to set their record attendance of 39,146 on 11 March 1911 against <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> during the club's <a href="1911%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup winning run</a>. It is the longest surviving attendance record at any league ground in the country.
On 17 March 1932, Bradford City paid Midland Railway Company £3,750 for the remaining two-thirds of the site to become outright owners of the ground, which was now 45 years old. The stadium had remained virtually unchanged since 1908, and did so until 1952, when the capacity of the ground was reduced after examinations of the foundations were ordered following the 1946 <a href="Burnden%20Park%20disaster">Burnden Park disaster</a>. The investigation resulted in the closure of half the Midland Road stand. The stand's steel frame was then sold to <a href="Berwick%20Rangers%20F.C.">Berwick Rangers</a> for £450 and a smaller replacement stand was built at Valley Parade in 1954. Six years later, the stand had to be demolished for a second time because of continuing foundation problems. It was another six years before all four stands at Valley Parade were able to be opened for the first time. To enable construction of a new stand on the Midland Road side of the ground, the club directors moved the pitch closer to the main stand. The new stand was then the narrowest stand in the league. Further improvements were made to the stand in 1969, ready for the club's FA Cup tie with <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Division One</a> side <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> on 3 January 1970, which ended in a 2–2 draw in front of 23,000 fans. The cost of the work forced the club to sell Valley Parade to Bradford Corporation for £35,000, but it was bought back by 1979 for the same price.

During the period from 1908 to 1985, the club carried out a number of other lesser work to the rest of the ground. It also included the introduction of <a href="Floodlights%20%28sport%29">floodlights</a> in English football. Valley Parade's first floodlights cost £3,000 and were lamps mounted on telegraph poles running along each side of the ground. They were originally used against <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a> on 20 December 1954. The floodlights were replaced in 1960 and again used for the first time against Hull City, but when one fell over in 1962, an FA Cup game with <a href="Gateshead%20F.C.">Gateshead</a> had to go ahead with only three pylons, prompting an FA inquiry. In 1985, football ground writer <a href="Simon%20Inglis">Simon Inglis</a> described the view from the main stand, which was still the same as when it was developed in 1908, as "like watching football from the <a href="cockpit">cockpit</a> of a <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a>" because of its antiquated supports and struts.
On 11 May 1985, one of the <a href="List%20of%20accidents%20and%20disasters%20by%20death%20toll%23Sporting%20events">worst sporting disasters</a> occurred at Valley Parade, 56 people died and at least 265 were injured when the main stand was engulfed by <a href="Bradford%20City%20stadium%20fire">fire</a>. The fire started 40 minutes into the club's final game of the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20in%20English%20football">1984–85</a> season against <a href="Lincoln%20City%20F.C.">Lincoln City</a> and destroyed the main stand in just nine minutes. For the next season and the first five months of the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20in%20English%20football">1986–87</a> season, Bradford City played home games at <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United's</a> <a href="Elland%20Road">Elland Road</a>, <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Huddersfield Town's</a> <a href="Leeds%20Road%2C%20Huddersfield">Leeds Road</a> and <a href="Bradford%20Bulls">Bradford Northern's</a> <a href="Odsal%20Stadium">Odsal Stadium</a>, while Valley Parade was rebuilt. Huddersfield-based firm J Wimpenny carried out the £2.6 million work, which included funding from insurance pay-outs, <a href="The%20Football%20League">Football League</a> stadium grants, club funds and a £1.46 million Government loan obtained by two Bradford MPs, <a href="Geoffrey%20Lawler">Geoffrey Lawler</a> and <a href="Max%20Madden">Max Madden</a>. A new 5,000 all-seater main stand was built, longer than the structure which had burned down. The Kop was also covered for the first time and increased to a 7,000 capacity. Other minor work was carried out to the ground's other two stands. On 14 December 1986, 582 days after the fire, The Hon Sir <a href="Oliver%20Popplewell">Oliver Popplewell</a>, who had conducted the inquiry into the fire, opened the new stadium before an exhibition match against an England international XI. It was first used for a league game on Boxing Day when City lost 1–0 to <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a>.
The two stands which were not altered after the fire were both improved during the 1990s. The Bradford end of the ground was made a double-decker, all-seater stand, with a new scoreboard, in 1991. City's promotion to <a href="Football%20League%20Division%20One">Division One</a> in 1996 meant that chairman <a href="Geoffrey%20Richmond">Geoffrey Richmond</a> announced the construction of a 4,500 seater stand on the Midland Road side. It was first used for a Yorkshire <a href="local%20derby">derby</a> against <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> on Boxing Day 1996, before being officially opened by <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> on 27 March 1997. Richmond continued his plans to redevelop the ground as City continued to rise through the league. The roof of the Kop, which was the largest safe-standing terrace in the country at the time, was removed and the capacity reduced during City's <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20in%20English%20football">1998–99</a> promotion season, to prepare for a summer £6.5 million rebuilding programme. The Kop was converted into a two-tier 7,500-seat capacity stand. An additional 2,300-seat capacity corner section was built, which filled in the corner between the main stand and Kop. When opened in December 2000 it took the capacity of Valley Parade to more than 20,000 for the first time since 1970. A suite of offices and a shop were added at the same time. Once the work was completed, a second tier was added to the main stand at the cost of £6.5 million. It was opened in 2001, increasing the main stand's capacity to 11,000, and the ground's capacity to 25,000.

Richmond also planned to increase the main stand's capacity by a further 1,800 seats by building new changing rooms and office blocks, and add a second tier to the Midland Road stand, to increase the ground capacity to more than 35,000. However, the club went into <a href="administration%20%28insolvency%29">administration</a> in May 2002, and Richmond was replaced by new co-owners <a href="Julian%20Rhodes">Julian Rhodes</a> and <a href="Gordon%20Gibb">Gordon Gibb</a>. The following year, Valley Parade was sold to Gibb's pension fund for £5 million, with the club's offices, shop and car park sold to London-based Development Securities for an additional £2.5 million. Bradford City's annual rent bill in 2011 to Gibb's pension fund is £370,000. The total budget for the year, including other rent payments, <a href="rates%20%28tax%29">rates</a>, maintenance and <a href="public%20utility">utility</a> bills is £1.25 million.

The ground has been renamed a number of times for sponsorship reasons. Sponsors have included <a href="the%20Pulse%20of%20West%20Yorkshire">The Pulse radio station</a>, <a href="Bradford%20%26amp%3B%20Bingley">Bradford & Bingley</a>, Intersonic and Coral Windows. The ground has been named the Northern Commercials Stadium since July 2016 but is still commonly known throughout football as Valley Parade.

The stadium is divided into five <a href="all-seater">all-seater</a> stands, the <a href="JCT600">JCT600</a> Stand, the Kop, the Midland Road Stand, the North West Corner and the TL Dallas Stand. All five stands are covered except for a small part of the main stand, and all but the Midland Road Stand being two-tiered. Most of the stands are cantilever structures, and because of the ground's location on the hillside, the Midland Road Stand overhangs the road.

Many of the stands have more traditional names, but have since been renamed because of sponsorship deals. The JCT600 Stand is the ground's main stand, and is often called the latter by fans, but is also known as the Sunwin stand owing to the former sponsor. The <a href="Spion%20Kop%20%28stadia%29">Kop</a>, was the former standing area, and its name was derived, like at many stadia across the country, from the <a href="Battle%20of%20Spion%20Kop">Battle of Spion Kop</a>. The East Stand, sponsored by Northern Commercials, is also named the Midland Road stand, because of the road on that side of the ground. The TL Dallas Stand is also known as the Bradford end, because it is nearest to the city centre.

The total capacity of Valley Parade is 25,136. The largest stand is the JCT600 Stand, which holds 9,004 supporters, followed by the Kop, which has a capacity of 7,492. The Midland Road Stand holds 4,500, and the North West Corner 2,300. The TL Dallas Stand is the smallest of the five stands with a capacity of 1,840. The stadium includes 134 seats for media representatives.

The Sunwin Stand has further room for expansion, and is unusual because it only runs three-quarters of the length of the pitch. The rest of this side is taken up by a brick building, situated in the south west corner of the stadium, which houses the club changing rooms and the security offices. The Sunwin Stand also includes the ground's 17 executive boxes and conference facilities, which have capacity for up to 700 people. A second function room, called the Bantams Bar, in the Kop, has room for another 300 people. There is also more office space, a club store, ticket office and museum in the car park behind the Kop. From early 2010, the area near the store will also include a <a href="dental%20surgery">dental surgery</a>, which will be run by NHS Bradford and Airedale in partnership with the football club.

Visiting team fans sat in the TL Dallas Stand from 1995 to 2008, but have also been given other parts of the ground for larger matches. In March 2008, the club announced that the TL Dallas Stand would be made available for home fans for the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football">2008–09</a> season. The decision came after an overwhelmingly positive text message poll from the club's supporters to use the Bradford End of the ground. Visiting team fans have been accommodated in the end blocks of the East Stand since the start of the 2008–09 season. Since the 2013–14 Season away fans have moved back to the TL Dallas stand.

On 11 May 1985, a crowd of 11,076 attended Bradford City's final <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Division Three</a> game of the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20in%20English%20football">1984–85</a> season against <a href="Lincoln%20City%20F.C.">Lincoln City</a>. The Bradford side had secured the Division Three title the week before when they defeated <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> 2–0. The league trophy was presented to City's skipper <a href="Peter%20Jackson%20%28footballer%20born%201961%29">Peter Jackson</a> before the Lincoln game. The score was still 0–0 after 40 minutes of the game, when a small fire was noticed three rows from the back near one end of the main stand. The flames became more visible within minutes, and police started to evacuate people in the stand less than six minutes later. Club chairman <a href="Stafford%20Heginbotham">Stafford Heginbotham</a>, who was in the main stand, described the effect and his reaction to the disaster: "The fire just spread along the length of the stand in seconds. The smoke was choking. We couldn't breathe. It was to be our day." The game was stopped, and the wooden roof caught fire. The fire spread the length of the stand, and timber and the roof began to fall onto the crowds. Black smoke enveloped the rear passageways, where fans were trying to escape. Ultimately, the fire killed 56 spectators, ranging from 11-year-old children to the 86-year-old former chairman of the club, Sam Firth. At least 265 further supporters were injured. The few existing narrow escape routes led to locked doors in some cases, and the only escape for most spectators was directly onto the field. The match was abandoned and never replayed, with <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> ordering the scoreline at the time of abandonment to stand.
Sir <a href="Oliver%20Popplewell">Oliver Popplewell</a> published his inquiry into the fire in 1986, which introduced new safety legislation for sports grounds across the country. Forensic scientist David Woolley believed the cause of the fire was from a discarded cigarette or match, which had dropped through gaps between the seating to a void below the stand where rubbish had built up. A number of police officers and 22 spectators were later awarded bravery awards for their deeds on the day.

The old wooden roof of the stand was due to be replaced the day after the Lincoln match, because it did not meet the safety regulations required for <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Division Two</a>, where the team would be playing in the following season. Instead, it took until July 1986 for rebuilding work to begin. The ground was used for reserve team fixtures from September 1985, but only journalists and club officials were present to watch. Bradford City's senior team played home games at other grounds in West Yorkshire for 19 months while Valley Parade was rebuilt. The new ground cost £2.6 million (£ million today) to rebuild, and was reopened in December 1986.

More than £3.5 million (£ million today) was raised for victims of the fire and their families through the Bradford Disaster Appeal Fund. Memorials have been erected at the ground and at Bradford City Hall, the latter of which was provided by Bradford's twin town of <a href="Hamm">Hamm</a>, in Germany. The disaster is also marked by an annual remembrance ceremony on 11 May at Bradford City Hall, and an annual Easter-weekend youth tournament, contested between Bradford, Lincoln and other teams from across Europe.

Valley Parade hosted its first international football game just two months after its first Football League match. The game's governing bodies wanted to promote the sport in the <a href="West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">West Riding of Yorkshire</a>, so chose Valley Parade to host a game between an English League side and an <a href="Irish%20Football%20League">Irish League</a> side, despite the ground not being up to standard. An estimated 20,000 spectators attended the match on 10 October 1903, which the English League won 2–1. Over the next 20 years the ground hosted a number of other representative games, including an <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England international</a> trial, the 1904 <a href="FA%20Amateur%20Cup">FA Amateur Cup</a> Final and an under-15s schoolboy international between England and Scotland. But it was not until 6 April 1987 that the ground hosted another international when <a href="England%20national%20under-18%20football%20team">England under-18s</a> drew 1–1 with <a href="Switzerland%20national%20football%20team">Switzerland</a>. Other under-18 fixtures have been played since, the last of which was between England and <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium</a> in November 2000. It hosted two <a href="England%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">England under-21</a> international friendlies. The first was against <a href="Denmark%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">Denmark's under-21s</a> on 8 October 1999. The hosts thrashed the visitors 4–1. The other was against <a href="Italy%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">Italy's under-21s</a> 26 March 2002. it ended in a 1 - 1 draw with 21,642 in attendance. Valley Parade's next international came seven years later when Bradford City hosted an under-19s European Championship qualifying game, in which England defeated <a href="Slovakia%20national%20football%20team">Slovakia</a> 4–1. The <a href="England%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">England women's team</a> have also played at Valley Parade, including their first home match under the auspices of <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> in 1994 against <a href="Spain%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Spain</a>.

<a href="Bradford%20Park%20Avenue%20A.F.C.">Bradford (Park Avenue)</a> have played 29 games at Valley Parade, including a 2–0 friendly victory over Swiss side <a href="AC%20Lugano">AC Lugano</a> in 1962, and all their home fixtures in <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20in%20English%20football">1973–74</a>, their last season before extinction. Bradford's <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a> side Bradford Northern played a number of fixtures at Valley Parade between 1920 and 1937, as well as three games in the 1980s, and 1990s. Bradford Northern became Bradford Bulls with the advent of the <a href="Super%20League">Super League</a>, and played two seasons at Valley Parade in 2001 and 2002 during redevelopment of their home ground at <a href="Odsal%20Stadium">Odsal</a>.

The record attendance at Valley Parade is 39,146, for Bradford City's <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> fourth round tie against <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> on 11 March 1911. The highest league attendance of 37,059, was for a <a href="Bradford%20derby">Bradford derby</a> match between Bradford City and <a href="Bradford%20Park%20Avenue%20A.F.C.">Bradford (Park Avenue)</a> on 17 September 1927 in <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North">Division Three (North)</a>. The record attendance since the Valley Parade grounds were rebuilt in 1986 (all-seated attendance) is 24,321, set on 7 March 2015 in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20FA%20Cup%23Sixth%20Round%20Proper">2015 FA Cup Quarter-finals</a> draw against <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a>, surpassing the previous record of 23,971, set on 10 December 2012 in the club's <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Football%20League%20Cup%23Quarter-finals">2012–13 Football League Cup Quarter-finals</a> victory over <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. The lowest attendance for a league home match at Valley Parade is 1,249, on 15 May 1981, for a <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Division Four</a> fixture with <a href="Hereford%20United%20F.C.">Hereford United</a>. The record gate receipts that Bradford City have received are £181,990 for the Premier League game with <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> on 13 January 2001.

Official attendance figures for league games were not kept by <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> until 1925. City's official highest average attendance at Valley Parade since then is 18,551 for the <a href="1928%E2%80%9329%20in%20English%20football">1928–29</a> <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> season from Division Three (North), although the club reported an average of 22,585 in <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20in%20English%20football">1920–21</a>. It was not until City were promoted to the Premier League in 1999 that the club again recorded average attendances of higher than 18,000. City recorded an average of 18,030 in <a href="1999-2000%20in%20English%20football">1999–2000</a>, and 18,511 the following season.

During their two years at Valley Parade, the <a href="Bradford%20Bulls">Bradford Bulls</a> recorded their highest attendance on 4 March 2001 against <a href="St%20Helens%20R.F.C.">St. Helens</a> with a crowd of 16,572. The Bulls averaged 11,488 in 2002 for <a href="Super%20League%20VII">Super League VII</a>. The highest crowd for a Bradford Northern fixture at Valley Parade was 20,973 on 13 February 1926 for a <a href="Challenge%20Cup">Challenge Cup</a> game against <a href="Keighley%20Cougars">Keighley</a>, which finished 2–2.

Bradford is served by two railway stations. They are <a href="Bradford%20Interchange">Bradford Interchange</a>, which is also the city's main bus terminus, and away from the ground, and <a href="Bradford%20Forster%20Square%20railway%20station">Bradford Forster Square</a>, which is away from the ground. Bradford Interchange connects to <a href="Leeds%20railway%20station">Leeds railway station</a> for <a href="London%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London North Eastern Railway</a> and <a href="CrossCountry">CrossCountry</a> train services, <a href="Grand%20Central%20%28train%20operating%20company%29">Grand Central</a> provide a direct service to London, and provides <a href="First%20Bradford">First Bradford</a> and <a href="Keighley%20Bus%20Company">Keighley Bus Company</a> buses to the ground. Forster Square, which provides train services operated by <a href="Northern%20%28train%20operating%20company%29">Northern</a>, also connects to Leeds. The stadium has no parking facilities available to supporters on matchdays. In 2000, as part of the expansion of Valley Parade, the club drew up a green transport plan in a bid to ease traffic congestion around the ground. Proposals included a new railway station on the line between Leeds and Bradford Forster Square, and a discounted bus service. No station has ever been built, and a discounted bus route was withdrawn because of low patronage.

Siege of Sidney Street

The Siege of Sidney Street of January 1911, also known as the Battle of Stepney, was a <a href="Shootout">gunfight</a> in the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End of London</a> between a combined police and army force and two <a href="Latvians">Latvian</a> revolutionaries. The siege was the culmination of a series of events that began in December 1910, with an attempted jewellery robbery at <a href="Houndsditch">Houndsditch</a> in the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a> by a gang of Latvian immigrants which resulted in the murder of three policemen, the wounding of two others, and the death of George Gardstein, the leader of the Latvian gang.

An investigation by the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan</a> and <a href="City%20of%20London%20Police">City of London Police</a> forces identified Gardstein's accomplices, most of whom were arrested within two weeks. The police were informed that the final two members of the gang were hiding at 100 Sidney Street in <a href="Stepney">Stepney</a>. The police evacuated local residents from the environs, and on the morning of 3 January a firefight broke out. Armed with inferior weapons, the police sought assistance from the <a href="British%20Army">army</a>. The siege lasted for about six hours. Towards the end of the stand-off, the building caught fire; no single cause has been identified. One of the agitators in the building was shot before the fire took control. While the <a href="London%20Fire%20Brigade">London Fire Brigade</a> were damping down the ruins—in which they found the two bodies—the building collapsed, killing a fireman, Superintendent Charles Pearson.

The siege marked the first time the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed stand-off. It was also the first siege in Britain to be caught on camera, as the events were filmed by <a href="Path%C3%A9%20News">Pathé News</a>. Some of the footage included images of the then <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. His presence caused a political row over the level of his operational involvement. At the subsequent trial in May 1911 of those arrested for the Houndsditch jewellery robbery, all but one of the accused were acquitted; the sole conviction was subsequently overturned on appeal. The events were fictionalised in film—in "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Knew%20Too%20Much%20%281934%20film%29">The Man Who Knew Too Much</a>" (1934) and "<a href="The%20Siege%20of%20Sidney%20Street">The Siege of Sidney Street</a>" (1960)—and novels. On the centenary of the events two tower blocks in Sidney Street were named after <a href="Peter%20the%20Painter">Peter the Painter</a>, one of the minor members of the gang who was probably not present at either Houndsditch or Sidney Street. The murdered policemen and the fireman who died are commemorated with memorial plaques.

In the 19th century <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> was home to about five million <a href="Jews">Jews</a>, the largest Jewish community at the time. Subjected to religious persecution and violent <a href="pogrom">pogrom</a>s, many emigrated and between 1875 and 1914 around 120,000 arrived in the United Kingdom, <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20England%231880s%20to%201920">mostly in England</a>. The influx reached its peak in the late 1890s when large numbers of Jewish immigrants—mostly poor and semi-skilled or unskilled—settled in the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End of London</a>. The concentration of Jewish immigrants into some areas was almost 100 per cent of the population, and a study undertaken in 1900 showed that <a href="Houndsditch">Houndsditch</a> and <a href="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</a> were both identified as a "well-defined intensely Jewish district".

Some of the expatriates were revolutionaries, many of whom were unable to adapt to life in the politically less oppressive London. The social historian <a href="William%20J.%20Fishman">William J. Fishman</a> writes that "the "" (crazy) Anarchists were almost accepted as part of the East End landscape"; the terms "<a href="socialist">socialist</a>" and "<a href="anarchist">anarchist</a>" had been conflated in the British press, who used the terms interchangeably to refer to those with revolutionary beliefs. A <a href="Editorial">leading article</a> in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" described the Whitechapel area as one that "harbours some of the worst alien anarchists and criminals who seek our too hospitable shore. And these are the men who use the pistol and the knife."

From the turn of the century, gang warfare persisted in the Whitechapel and <a href="Aldgate">Aldgate</a> areas of London between groups of <a href="Bessarabia">Bessarabia</a>ns and refugees from <a href="Odessa">Odessa</a>, and various revolutionary factions were active in the area. One event, the <a href="Tottenham%20Outrage">Tottenham Outrage</a> of January 1909, by two revolutionary Russians in London—Paul Helfeld and Jacob Lepidus—was an attempt to rob a payroll van, which left two dead and twenty injured. The event used a tactic often employed by revolutionary groups in Russia: the expropriation or theft of private property to fund radical activities.

The influx of émigrés, and the rising rates of violent crime associated with it, led to popular concerns and comments in the press. The government passed the <a href="Aliens%20Act%201905">Aliens Act 1905</a> in an attempt to reduce immigration. The popular press reflected the opinions of many at the time; a leading article in "The Manchester Evening Chronicle" supported the bill to bar "the dirty, destitute, diseased, verminous and criminal foreigner who dumps himself on our soil". The journalist <a href="Robert%20Winder">Robert Winder</a>, in his examination of immigration into Britain, opines that the Act "gave official sanction to xenophobic reflexes which might ... have remained dormant".

By 1910 Russian émigrés met regularly at the Anarchist Club in Jubilee Street, <a href="Stepney">Stepney</a>. Many of its members were not anarchists, and the club became a meeting and social venue for the Russian émigré <a href="diaspora">diaspora</a>, most of whom were Jewish. The small group of Latvians who became involved in the events at Houndsditch and Sidney Street were not all anarchists—although anarchist literature was later found among their possessions. Members of the group were probably revolutionaries who had been radicalised by their experiences in Russia. All had extreme left-wing political views and believed the expropriation of private property was a valid practice.

The probable leader of the group was George Gardstein, whose real name was likely to have been Poloski or Poolka; he used the aliases Garstin, Poloski, Poolka, Morountzeff, Mourimitz, Maurivitz, Milowitz, Morintz, Morin and Levi. Gardstein, who probably was an anarchist, had been accused of murder and acts of terrorism in Warsaw in 1905 before his arrival in London. Another member of the group, <a href="Yakov%20Peters">Jacob (or Yakov) Peters</a>, had been an agitator in Russia while in the army and later as a dockyard worker. He had served a term in prison for his activities and had been tortured by the removal of his fingernails. Yourka Dubof was another Russian agitator who had fled to England after being flogged by <a href="Cossacks">Cossacks</a>. Fritz Svaars was a Latvian who had been arrested by the Russian authorities three times for terrorist offences, but escaped each time. He had travelled through the United States, where he undertook a series of robberies, before arriving in London in June 1910.

Another member was "Peter the Painter", a nickname for an unknown figure, possibly named Peter Piaktow (or Piatkov, Pjatkov or Piaktoff), or Janis Zhaklis. Bernard Porter, in a brief sketch in the "<a href="Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Dictionary of National Biography</a>", writes that no firm details are known of the anarchist's background and that "None of the ... biographical 'facts' about him ... is altogether reliable." William (or Joseph) Sokoloff (or Sokolow) was a Latvian who had been arrested in Riga in 1905 for murder and robbery before travelling to London. Another of the group's members was Karl Hoffman—whose real name was Alfred Dzircol—who had been involved in revolutionary and criminal activities for several years, including gun-running. In London he had practiced as a decorator. John Rosen—real name John Zelin or Tzelin—came to London in 1909 from Riga and worked as a barber, while another member of the gang was Max Smoller, also known as Joe Levi and "Josepf the Jew". He was wanted in his native Crimea for several jewel robberies.

Following the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Act%201829">Metropolitan Police Act 1829</a> and the City of London Police Act 1839, the capital was policed by two forces, the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police</a>, who held sway over most of the capital, and the <a href="City%20of%20London%20Police">City of London Police</a>, who were responsible for law enforcement within the <a href="City%20of%20London">historic City boundaries</a>. The events in Houndsditch in December 1910 fell into the purview of the City of London service, and the subsequent actions at Sidney Street in January 1911 were in the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan force. Both services came under the political control of the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, who in 1911 was the 36-year-old rising politician <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>.

While on the beat, or in the course of their normal duties, the officers of both the City of London and Metropolitan forces were provided with only a short wooden <a href="Baton%20%28law%20enforcement%29">truncheon</a> for protection. When they faced armed opponents—as was the case in Sidney Street—the police were issued with <a href="Webley%20Revolver">Webley</a> and <a href="British%20Bull%20Dog%20revolver">Bull Dog revolvers</a>, <a href="shotgun">shotgun</a>s and small-bore rifles fitted with <a href="Gallery%20gun%23Saloon%20gun">.22 Morris-tube barrels</a>, the last of which were more commonly used on small indoor shooting galleries.

At the beginning of December 1910 Smoller, using the name Joe Levi, visited Exchange Buildings, a small cul-de-sac that backed onto the properties of Houndsditch. He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000. Over the next two weeks the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25 m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.

With the exception of Gardstein, the identities of the gang members present in Houndsditch on the night of 16 December 1910 have never been confirmed. Bernard Porter, writing in the "Dictionary of National Biography", considers that Sokoloff and Peters were present and, in all likelihood, were two of those who shot the policemen who interrupted their burglary. Porter opines that Peter the Painter was probably not at the property that night, while the journalist J P Eddy suggests that Svaars was among those present. Donald Rumbelow, a former policeman who wrote a history of the events, considers that those present consisted of Gardstein, Smoller, Peters and Dubof, with a second group in case the work needed to continue into the following day, which included among their number Sokolow and Svaars. Rumbelow considers a third group on standby, staying at Hoffman's lodgings, to have comprised Hoffman, Rosen and Osip Federoff, an unemployed locksmith. Rumbelow also considers that present at the events—either as lookouts or in unknown capacities—were Peter the Painter and Nina Vassilleva.

On 16 December, working from the small yard behind 11 Exchange Buildings, the gang began to break through the back wall of the shop; number 10 had been unoccupied since 12 December. At around 10:00 that evening, returning to his home at 120 Houndsditch, Max Weil heard curious noises coming from his neighbour's property. Outside his house Weil found <a href="Constable">Police Constable</a> Piper on his beat and informed him of the noises. Piper checked at 118 and 121 Houndsditch, where he could hear the noise, which he thought was unusual enough to investigate further. At 11:00 he knocked at the door of 11 Exchange Buildings—the only property with a light on in the back. The door was opened in a furtive manner and Piper became suspicious immediately. So as not to rouse the man's concerns, Piper asked him "is the missus in?" The man answered in broken English that she was out, and the policeman said he would return later.
Piper reported that as he was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously in the shadows of the cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.

As the gang exited the property and made to escape up the cul-de-sac, other police intervened. Sergeant Charles Tucker from Bishopsgate police station was hit twice, once in the hip and once in the heart by Peters: he died instantly. Choate grabbed Gardstein and wrestled for his gun, but the Russian managed to shoot him in the leg. Other members of the gang ran to Gardstein's assistance, shooting Choate twelve times in the process, but Gardstein was also wounded; as the policeman collapsed, Gardstein was carried away by his accomplices, who included Peters. As these men, aided by an unknown woman, made their escape with Gardstein they were accosted by Isaac Levy, a passer-by, whom they threatened at pistol-point. He was the only witness to the escape who was able to provide firm details; other witnesses confirmed they saw a group of three men and a woman, and thought one of the men was drunk as he was being helped by his friends. The group, which included Peters, went to Svaars' and Peter the Painter's lodgings at 59 Grove Street (now Golding Street), off Commercial Road, where Gardstein was tended by two of the gang's associates, Luba Milstein (Svaars' mistress) and Sara Trassjonsky. As they left Gardstein on the bed, Peters left his Dreyse pistol under the mattress, either to make it seem the wounded man was the one who had killed Tucker, or to enable him to defend himself against a possible arrest.

Other policemen arrived in Houndsditch, and began to attend to the wounded. Tucker's body was put into a taxi and he was taken to the <a href="London%20Hospital">London Hospital</a> (now the Royal London Hospital) in <a href="Whitechapel%20Road">Whitechapel Road</a>. Choate was also taken there, where he was operated on, but he died at 5:30am on 17 December. Bentley was taken to <a href="St%20Bartholomew%27s%20Hospital">St Bartholomew's Hospital</a>. He was half-conscious on arrival, but recovered enough to be able to have a conversation with his pregnant wife and answer questions about the events. At 6:45pm on 17 December his condition worsened, and he died at 7:30. The killings of Tucker, Bentley and Choate remain one of the largest multiple murders of police officers carried out in Britain in peacetime.

The City of London police informed the Metropolitan force, as their protocol demanded, and both services issued revolvers to the detectives involved in the search. The subsequent investigation was challenging for the police because of the cultural differences between the British police and the largely foreign residents of the area covered by the search. The police did not have any Russian, Latvian or Yiddish speakers on the force.

In the early hours of the morning of 17 December Milstein and Trassjonsky became increasingly concerned as Gardstein's condition worsened, and they sent for a local doctor, explaining that their patient had been wounded accidentally by a friend. The doctor thought the bullet was still in the chest—it was later found to be touching the right <a href="Ventricle%20%28heart%29">ventricle</a> of the heart. The doctor wanted to take Gardstein to the London Hospital, but he refused; with no other course open to him, the doctor sold them pain medication and left. The Russian was dead by 9:00 that morning. The doctor returned at 11:00am and found the body. He had not heard of the events at Exchange Buildings the night before, and so reported the death to the coroner, not the police. At midday the coroner reported the death to the local police who, led by Divisional Detective Inspector <a href="Frederick%20Wensley">Frederick Wensley</a>, went to Grove Street and discovered the corpse. Trassjonsky was in the next room when they entered, and she was soon found by the police, hastily burning papers; she was arrested and taken to the police headquarters at <a href="Old%20Jewry">Old Jewry</a>. Many of the papers recovered linked the suspects to the East End, particularly to the anarchist groups active in the area. Wensley, who had extensive knowledge of the Whitechapel area, subsequently acted as a liaison officer to the City of London force throughout the investigation.

Gardstein's body was removed to a local mortuary where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions of those who had helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after she had told him she had been one of the people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to come in from the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.
On 22 December a public memorial service took place for Tucker, Bentley and Choate at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>. <a href="George%20V">King George V</a> was represented by Edward Wallington, his <a href="Groom%20in%20Waiting">Groom in Waiting</a>; also present were Churchill and the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London">Lord Mayor of London</a>. The crime had shocked Londoners and the service showed evidence of their feelings. An estimated ten thousand people waited in St Paul's environs, and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect; the nearby <a href="London%20Stock%20Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a> ceased trading for half an hour to allow traders and staff to watch the procession along <a href="Threadneedle%20Street">Threadneedle Street</a>. After the service, when the coffins were being transported on an eight-mile (13 km) journey to the cemeteries, it was estimated that 750,000 people lined the route, many throwing flowers onto the hearses as they passed.

<a href="Identity%20parade">Identity parade</a>s were held at <a href="Bishopsgate">Bishopsgate</a> police station on 23 December. Isaac Levy, who had seen the group leaving Exchange Buildings, identified Peters and Dubof as the two he had seen carrying Gardstein. It was also ascertained that Federoff had been witnessed at the events. The following day Federoff, Peters and Dubof all appeared at the Guildhall police court where they were charged with being connected to the murder of the three policemen, and with conspiracy to burgle the jewellery shop. All three pleaded not guilty.

On 27 December the poster bearing Gardstein's picture was seen by his landlord, who alerted police. Wensley and his colleagues visited the lodgings on Gold Street, Stepney and found knives, a gun, ammunition, false passports and revolutionary publications. Two days later there was another hearing at the Guildhall police court. In addition to Federoff, Peters and Dubof, present in the dock were Milstein and Trassjonsky. With some of the defendants having a low standard of English, interpreters were used throughout the proceedings. At the end of the day the case was adjourned until 6 January 1911.

On New Year's Day 1911 the body of Léon Beron, a Russian Jewish immigrant, was found on <a href="Clapham%20Common">Clapham Common</a> in South London. He had been badly beaten and two S-shaped cuts, both two inches long, were on his cheeks. The case became connected in the press with the Houndsditch murders and the subsequent events at Sidney Street, although the evidence at the time for the link was scant. The historian F G Clarke, in his history of the events, located information from another Latvian who stated that Beron had been killed not because he was one of the informers who had passed on information, but because he was planning to pass the information on, and the act was a pre-emptive one, designed to scare the locals into not informing on the anarchists.

The posters of Gardstein proved effective, and late on New Year's Day a member of the public came forward to provide information about Svaars and Sokoloff. The informant told police that the men were hiding at 100 Sidney Street, along with a lodger, Betty Gershon, who was Sokoloff's mistress. The informant was persuaded to visit the property the following day to confirm the two men were still present. A meeting took place on the afternoon of 2 January to decide the next steps. Wensley, high-ranking members of the Metropolitan force and <a href="William%20Nott-Bower">Sir William Nott-Bower</a>, the Commissioner of the City Police, were present.

Just after midnight on 3 January, 200 police officers from the City of London and Metropolitan forces cordoned off the area around 100 Sidney Street. Armed officers were placed at number 111, directly opposite number 100, and throughout the night the residents of the houses on the block were roused and evacuated. Wensley woke the ground floor tenants at number 100 and asked them to fetch Gershon, claiming that she was needed by her sick husband. When Gershon appeared she was grabbed by the police and taken to the City of London police headquarters; the ground floor lodgers also evacuated. Number 100 was now empty of all residents, apart from Svaars and Sokoloff, neither of whom seemed to be aware of the evacuation.

The police's operating procedure—and the law which governed their actions—meant they were unable to open fire without being fired upon first. This, along with the structure of the building, which had a narrow, winding stairwell up which police would have to pass, meant any approach to the gang members was too perilous to attempt. It was decided to wait until dawn before taking any action. At about 7:30am a policeman knocked on the door of number 100, which elicited no response; stones were then thrown at the window to wake the men. Svaars and Sokoloff appeared at the window and opened fire at the police. A police sergeant was wounded in the chest: he was evacuated under fire across the rooftops, and taken to the London Hospital. Some members of the police returned fire, but their guns were only effective over shorter ranges, and proved ineffective against the comparatively advanced automatic weapons of Svaars and Sokoloff.

By 9:00am it was apparent that the two gunmen possessed superior weapons and ample ammunition. The police officers in charge on the scene, Superintendent Mulvaney and Chief Superintendent Stark, contacted Assistant Commissioner Major <a href="Frederick%20Wodehouse">Frederick Wodehouse</a> at <a href="Scotland%20Yard">Scotland Yard</a>. He telephoned the <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> and obtained permission from Churchill to bring in a detachment of <a href="History%20of%20the%20Scots%20Guards%20%281805%E2%80%931913%29">Scots Guards</a>, who were stationed at the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>. It was the first time that the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed siege. Twenty-one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10:00am and took firing positions at each end of the street and in the houses opposite. The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage.
Churchill arrived on the scene at 11:50am to observe the incident at first hand; he later reported that he thought the crowd were unwelcoming to him, as he heard people asking "Oo let 'em in?", in reference to the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party's</a> immigration policy that had allowed the influx from Russia. Churchill's role during the siege is unclear. His biographers, <a href="Paul%20Addison">Paul Addison</a> and <a href="Roy%20Jenkins">Roy Jenkins</a>, both consider that he gave no operational commands to the police, but a Metropolitan police history of the event states that the events of Sidney Street were "a very rare case of a Home Secretary taking police operational command decisions". In a subsequent letter to "The Times", Churchill clarified his role while he was present:

I did not interfere in any way with the dispositions made by the police authorities on the spot. I never overruled those authorities nor overrode them. From beginning to end the police had an absolutely free hand. ... I did not send for the Artillery or the Engineers. I was not consulted as to whether they should be sent for.

Shooting between the two sides reached a peak between 12:00 and 12:30pm, but at 12:50 smoke was seen coming from the building's chimneys and from the second floor windows; it has not been established how the fire was started, whether by accident or design. The fire slowly spread, and by 1:30 it had taken a firm hold and had spread to the other floors. A second detachment of Scots Guards arrived, bringing with them a <a href="Maxim%20gun">Maxim machine gun</a>, which was never used. Shortly afterwards Sokoloff put his head out of the window; he was shot by one of the soldiers and he fell back inside. The senior officer of the <a href="London%20Fire%20Brigade">London Fire Brigade</a> present on the scene sought permission to extinguish the blaze, but was refused. He approached Churchill in order to have the decision overturned, but the Home Secretary approved the police decision. Churchill later wrote:
I now intervened to settle this dispute, at one moment quite heated. I told the fire-brigade officer on my authority as Home Secretary that the house was to be allowed to burn down and that he was to stand by in readiness to prevent the conflagration from spreading.

By 2:30pm the shooting from the house had ceased. One of the detectives present walked close to the wall and pushed the door open, before retreating. Other police officers, and some of the soldiers, came out and waited for the men to exit. None did, and as part of the roof collapsed, it was clear to onlookers that the men were both dead; the fire brigade was allowed to start extinguishing the fire. At 2:40 Churchill left the scene, at about the time the <a href="Royal%20Horse%20Artillery">Royal Horse Artillery</a> arrived with two <a href="13-pounder">13-pounder</a> <a href="field%20artillery">field artillery</a> pieces. When the firemen entered the property to douse the flames, they soon located Sokoloff's body, which was extracted. A wall collapsed on a group of five firemen, who were all taken to the London Hospital. One of the men, Superintendent Charles Pearson, had a fractured spine; he died six months after the siege as a result of his injuries. After shoring up the building, the firemen resumed their search of the premises. At around 6:30pm the second body—that of Svaars—was found; it was taken to the mortuary.

The siege was captured by <a href="Path%C3%A9%20News">Pathé News</a> cameras—one of their earliest stories and the first siege to be captured on film—and it included footage of Churchill in attendance. When the newsreels were screened in cinemas, Churchill was booed with shouts of "shoot him" from audiences. His presence was controversial to many and the <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Leader of the Opposition</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Balfour">Arthur Balfour</a>, remarked, "He [Churchill] was, I understand, in military phrase, in what is known as the zone of fire—he and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. I understand what the photographer was doing, but what was the right hon. Gentleman doing? That I neither understood at the time, nor do I understand now." Jenkins suggests that he went simply because "he could not resist going to see the fun himself".

An inquest was held in January into the deaths at Houndsditch and Sidney Street. The jury took fifteen minutes to reach the conclusion that the two bodies located were those of Svaars and Sokoloff, and that Tucker, Bentley and Choate had been murdered by Gardstein and others in the course of the burglary attempt. Rosen was arrested on 2 February at work in Well Street, <a href="Hackney%20Central">Hackney</a>, and Hoffman was taken into custody on 15 February. The committal proceedings spread from December 1910—with Milstein and Trassjonsky appearing—to March 1911, and included Hoffman from 15 February. The proceedings consisted of 24 individual hearings. In February Milstein was discharged on the basis that there was insufficient evidence against her; Hoffman, Trassjonsky and Federoff were released in March on the same basis.

The case against the four remaining arrested gang members was heard at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a> by <a href="William%20Grantham">Mr Justice Grantham</a> in May. Dubof and Peters were accused of Tucker's murder, Dubof, Peters, Rosen and Vassilleva were charged with "feloniously harbouring a felon guilty of murder", and for "conspiring and agreeing together and with others unknown to break and enter the shop of Henry Samuel Harris with intent to steal his goods." The case lasted for eleven days; there were problems with the proceedings because of the language difficulties and the chaotic personal lives of the accused. The case resulted in acquittals for all except Vassilleva, who was convicted of conspiracy in the burglary. She was sentenced to two years' imprisonment; her conviction was later overturned on appeal.

After the high levels of criticism aimed at the <a href="Aliens%20Act%201905">Aliens Act</a>, Churchill decided to strengthen the legislation, and proposed the Aliens (Prevention of Crime) Bill under the <a href="Ten%20Minute%20Rule">Ten Minute Rule</a>. The MP <a href="Josiah%20Wedgwood%2C%201st%20Baron%20Wedgwood">Josiah C Wedgwood</a> objected, and wrote to Churchill to ask him not to introduce the hard-line measures "You know as well as I do that human life does not matter a rap in comparison with the death of ideas and the betrayal of English traditions." The bill did not become law.

The inadequacy of the police's firepower led to criticism in the press, and on 12 January 1911 several alternative weapons were tested. The trials resulted in the Metropolitan Police replacing the Webley revolver with the <a href="Webley%20%26amp%3B%20Scott%23Webley%20.26%20Scott%20automatic%20pistols">Webley & Scott .32 calibre MP semi-automatic pistol</a> later that year; the City of London Police adopted the same weapon in 1912.

The members of the group dispersed after the events. Peter the Painter was never seen or heard from again. It was assumed he left the country, and there were several possible sightings in the years afterwards; none were confirmed. Jacob Peters returned to Russia, rose to be deputy head of the <a href="Cheka">Cheka</a>, the Soviet secret police, and was executed in <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>'s <a href="Great%20Purge">1938 purge</a>. Trassjonsky had a mental breakdown and was confined for a time at <a href="Friern%20Hospital">Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum</a>. Her eventual fate and date of death are unknown. Dubof, Federoff and Hoffmann disappeared from the records; Vassilleva remained in the East End for the remainder of her life and died at <a href="Brick%20Lane">Brick Lane</a> in 1963. Smoller left the country in 1911 and travelled to Paris, after which he disappeared; Milstein later emigrated to live in the United States.

The siege was the inspiration for the final scene in <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s original 1934 version of "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Knew%20Too%20Much%20%281934%20film%29">The Man Who Knew Too Much</a>"; the whole story was heavily fictionalised in the 1960 film "<a href="The%20Siege%20of%20Sidney%20Street">The Siege of Sidney Street</a>". The siege was also the fictional inspiration for two novels, "The Siege of Sidney Street" (1960) by F Oughton and "A Death Out of Season" (1973) by <a href="Emanuel%20Litvinoff">Emanuel Litvinoff</a>.

In September 2008 <a href="Tower%20Hamlets%20London%20Borough%20Council">Tower Hamlets London Borough Council</a> named two tower blocks in Sidney Street, Peter House and Painter House; Peter the Painter was only involved in a minor capacity in the events, and was not present at the siege. The name plaques on the buildings call Peter the Painter an "<a href="anti-hero">anti-hero</a>". The decision angered the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Federation">Metropolitan Police Federation</a>, and a council spokesman said that "There is no evidence that Peter the Painter killed the three policemen, so we knew we were not naming the block after a murderer. ... but he is the name that East Enders associate with the siege and Sidney Street." In December 2010, on the centenary of the events at Houndsditch, a memorial plaque for the three murdered policemen was unveiled near the location. Three weeks later, on the anniversary of the siege, a plaque was unveiled in honour of Pearson, the fireman who died because the building collapsed on him.

She is married to businessman Adam Shulman, with whom she has a son.

Anne Jacqueline Hathaway was born in the <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> borough of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> on November 12, 1982. Her father, Gerald, is a labor attorney, and her mother, Kate ("<a href="n%C3%A9e">née</a>" McCauley), is a former actress. Hathaway's maternal grandfather was <a href="WTEL%20%28AM%29">WIP-AM</a> <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> radio personality Joe McCauley. Kate is of Irish descent, and Gerald is of Irish, French, English and German ancestry. Hathaway's surname originates in England, and she was named after <a href="Anne%20Hathaway%20%28wife%20of%20Shakespeare%29">Shakespeare's wife</a>. She is the second of three children, with two brothers, one older, Michael, and one younger, Thomas. When she was six, her family moved to the <a href="Short%20Hills%2C%20New%20Jersey">Short Hills</a> neighborhood of <a href="Millburn%2C%20New%20Jersey">Millburn, New Jersey</a>, where she then grew up.
At age six, when Hathaway watched her mother perform in "<a href="Les%20Mis%C3%A9rables%20%28musical%29">Les Misérables</a>" as <a href="Fantine">Fantine</a>, she instantly became fascinated with the stage, but her parents were not keen on allowing her to pursue an acting career. After this, Kate quit acting to raise Hathaway and her brothers. Hathaway was raised as <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> with what she considers "really strong values" and stated that she wished to be a <a href="nun">nun</a> during her childhood, but acting was always a high priority for her. At the age of 15, her relationship with the Catholic Church changed, after learning that Michael was gay. Her family left the church due to its intolerance of homosexuality, converting to <a href="Episcopalianism">Episcopalianism</a>, but left that too. In 2009, Hathaway stated that her religious beliefs are "a work in progress".

Hathaway attended Brooklyn Heights <a href="Montessori">Montessori</a> School and Wyoming Elementary School in Millburn. She graduated from <a href="Millburn%20High%20School">Millburn High School</a>, where she played soccer and participated in many plays, including "<a href="Once%20Upon%20a%20Mattress">Once Upon a Mattress</a>", in which she portrayed Winnifred. Later, she appeared in other plays like "<a href="Jane%20Eyre">Jane Eyre</a>" and "<a href="Gigi%20%28play%29">Gigi</a>", at New Jersey's Paper Mill Playhouse. She studied at the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Dramatic%20Arts">American Academy of Dramatic Arts</a> in 1993 and became the first teenager admitted into <a href="the%20Barrow%20Group">the Barrow Group</a> Theater Company's acting program. She spent several semesters studying as an English major and political science minor at <a href="Vassar%20College">Vassar College</a> in <a href="Poughkeepsie%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Poughkeepsie, New York</a>, before transferring to <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>'s <a href="Gallatin%20School%20of%20Individualized%20Study">Gallatin School of Individualized Study</a>. She has stated that she would have become either an English teacher or psychologist if she were not acting.

Between 1998 and 1999, Hathaway sang <a href="soprano">soprano</a> with the All-Eastern U.S. High School Honors Chorus at <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a> and in plays at <a href="Seton%20Hall%20Preparatory%20School">Seton Hall Preparatory School</a> in <a href="West%20Orange%2C%20New%20Jersey">West Orange</a>, New Jersey. At the start of her film career, her acting style and beauty were compared to the likes of <a href="Judy%20Garland">Judy Garland</a>—whom she cites as one of her favorite actresses—and <a href="Audrey%20Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a>. Three days after her performance at Carnegie Hall, Hathaway was cast in the short-lived Fox television series "<a href="Get%20Real%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Get Real</a>". Hathaway played the teenager Meghan Green alongside <a href="Jon%20Tenney">Jon Tenney</a>, <a href="Debrah%20Farentino">Debrah Farentino</a> and <a href="Jesse%20Eisenberg">Jesse Eisenberg</a>. Despite her early success, Hathaway suffered from depression and anxiety as a teenager; she says she has since grown from it. She missed her first college semester for the filming of her cinematic debut "<a href="The%20Princess%20Diaries%20%28film%29">The Princess Diaries</a>" (2001). She says she never regretted not finishing her degree, as she enjoyed being with others who "were trying to grow up".

The comedy "The Princess Diaries" and the adventure drama "<a href="The%20Other%20Side%20of%20Heaven">The Other Side of Heaven</a>", both 2001 <a href="Disney">Disney</a> films, featured Hathaway in lead roles. Based on <a href="Meg%20Cabot">Meg Cabot</a>'s 2000 novel of the <a href="The%20Princess%20Diaries">same name</a>, the former follows a teenager <a href="Mia%20Thermopolis">Mia Thermopolis</a> (Hathaway) who discovers that she is the heir to the throne of the fictional Kingdom of Genovia. Hathaway auditioned for the role during a flight layover on the way to New Zealand. <a href="Garry%20Marshall">Garry Marshall</a>, the film's director, initially considered <a href="Liv%20Tyler">Liv Tyler</a> for the role, but cast Hathaway after his granddaughters suggested that she had the best "princess" hair. The film became a major commercial success, grossing $165 million worldwide. Many critics praised Hathaway's performance; a <a href="BBC">BBC</a> critic noted that "Hathaway shines in the title role and generates great chemistry" and "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" <a href="Elvis%20Mitchell">Elvis Mitchell</a> found her to be "royalty in the making, a young comic talent with a scramble of features". She earned a <a href="MTV%20Movie%20Award%20for%20Next%20Generation">MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Female Performance</a> nomination for the role. Hathaway starred with <a href="Christopher%20Gorham">Christopher Gorham</a> in <a href="Mitch%20Davis">Mitch Davis</a>'s "The Other Side of Heaven". Inspired by <a href="John%20H.%20Groberg">John H. Groberg</a>'s memoir "In the Eye of the Storm", the film met with mostly negative reviews and was a box-office failure.

Owing to the success of "The Princess Diaries", "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" magazine named Hathaway one of its breakthrough stars of 2001. In February 2002, Hathaway starred in the City Center Encores! concert production of "<a href="Carnival%21">Carnival!</a>" in her New York City stage debut. She played Lili, an optimistic orphan who falls in love with a magician. Before rehearsing with the full cast, Hathaway trained with a vocal coach for two weeks. She memorized almost all of her lines and songs at the first read-through. Critics generally praised her for holding her own against well-known actors and heralded her as a new star. In a positive review for the musical, <a href="Charles%20Isherwood">Charles Isherwood</a> of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" called Hathaway the highlight of the show and "remarkably unaffected and winning", praising her convincing performance. She won a <a href="Clarence%20Derwent%20Award">Clarence Derwent Award</a> for Most Promising Female. Later, Hathaway voiced the audiobook release of the first three books in "The Princess Diaries" novels.

Hathaway portrayed princesses and appeared in family-oriented films over the next three years, subsequently becoming known in mainstream media as a children's role model. After voicing Haru Yoshioka for the English version of "<a href="The%20Cat%20Returns">The Cat Returns</a>" (2002), she starred in <a href="Douglas%20McGrath">Douglas McGrath</a>'s comedy-drama "<a href="Nicholas%20Nickleby%20%282002%20film%29">Nicholas Nickleby</a>" (2002), which opened to positive reviews. The "<a href="Deseret%20News">Deseret News</a>" said that the cast was "terrific". The film did not enter wide release and failed at the North American box office, totaling less than $4 million in ticket sales. The fantasy romantic comedy film "<a href="Ella%20Enchanted%20%28film%29">Ella Enchanted</a>" (2004), in which Hathaway played the titular character, also performed poorly at the box-office. She first read <a href="Ella%20Enchanted">the book the film is based on</a> when she was 16, and stated that the script was originally much closer to the book, but did not work as a film, and therefore prefers the film the way it became. The film opened to mostly mixed reviews. Hathaway sang three songs on the film's <a href="Ella%20Enchanted%20%28soundtrack%29">soundtrack</a>, including a duet with singer <a href="Jesse%20McCartney">Jesse McCartney</a>.

In 2003, Hathaway declined the role for <a href="Joel%20Schumacher">Joel Schumacher</a>'s "<a href="The%20Phantom%20of%20the%20Opera%20%282004%20film%29">The Phantom of the Opera</a>" (2004), because the production schedule of the film overlapped with "" (2004). Hathaway was initially hesitant and nervous about starring in the sequel, but agreed to it after Marshall convinced her that she was not repeating anything. The film was released in August 2004 to negative reviews, but made $95.1 million against a $40 million budget.

In a 2008 article, Hathaway said that "anybody who was a role model for children needs a reprieve", but noted that "it's lovely to think that my audience is growing up with me". To avoid getting <a href="typecast%20%28acting%29">typecast</a>, she began taking on adult roles. After replacing <a href="Tara%20Strong">Tara Strong</a> for the voice role of <a href="Little%20Red%20Riding%20Hood">Red Puckett</a> in "<a href="Hoodwinked%21">Hoodwinked!</a>" (2005), she starred in the drama "<a href="Havoc%20%282005%20film%29">Havoc</a>" (2005) as a spoiled socialite, appearing nude in some of its scenes. Although film was thematically different from her previous films, Hathaway denied that her role was an attempt to be seen as a more mature actress, citing her belief that doing <a href="nudity">nudity</a> in certain films is merely a part of what her chosen form of art demands of her; and because of that belief she does not consider appearing nude in appropriate films to be morally objectionable. The film was not released in theaters in the United States due to unfavorable critical reception.

Hathaway starred alongside <a href="Heath%20Ledger">Heath Ledger</a> and <a href="Jake%20Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a> in <a href="Ang%20Lee">Ang Lee</a>'s drama "<a href="Brokeback%20Mountain">Brokeback Mountain</a>" (2005). The film depicts the emotional and sexual relationship between two married men, <a href="Ennis%20Del%20Mar">Ennis</a> (Ledger) and <a href="Jack%20Twist">Jack</a> (Gyllenhaal); Hathaway played Jack's wife. She was originally sent the script with the role of Alma, Ennis' wife, but decided to audition for Lureen once she read the screenplay. During her audition, Hathaway lied to Lee about her knowledge of <a href="horse%20riding">horse riding</a> so he would cast her, but she did subsequently take horse riding lessons. The film received positive reviews from critics and several <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Award</a> nominations. <a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a> of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" believed that Hathaway "excels at showing Lureen's journey from cutie-pie to hard case", and <a href="Todd%20McCarthy">Todd McCarthy</a> of "Variety" opined she "provides an entertaining contrast in wifely disappointment". Hathaway later stated that the content of the film was more important than its award count and that making it made her more aware of the kind of stories she wanted to tell as an actress. At that point, she realized that she wanted to play roles to move her audiences or otherwise entertain them so much that they forget about their own lives.
In 2006, she starred in <a href="David%20Frankel">David Frankel</a>'s comedy film "<a href="The%20Devil%20Wears%20Prada%20%28film%29">The Devil Wears Prada</a>", as an assistant to the powerful <a href="fashion%20magazine">fashion magazine</a> editor <a href="Miranda%20Priestly">Miranda Priestly</a>, played by <a href="Meryl%20Streep">Meryl Streep</a>. Hathaway said that working on the film made her respect the fashion industry a great deal more than she had previously, though she claimed that her personal style is something she "still can't get right". The actress also stated that she and co-star <a href="Emily%20Blunt">Emily Blunt</a> got so hungry on their weight-loss regimen for the film it made them cry. To prepare for the role, Hathaway volunteered for a few weeks as an assistant at an <a href="auction%20house">auction house</a>. The film received positive reviews; <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> called Hathaway "a great beauty [...] who makes a convincing career girl" and <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> found "Streep in top form and Anne Hathaway more than holding her own".

Hathaway was cast in "<a href="Knocked%20Up">Knocked Up</a>", but dropped out before filming began and was replaced by <a href="Katherine%20Heigl">Katherine Heigl</a>. According to writer-director <a href="Judd%20Apatow">Judd Apatow</a>, this happened because Hathaway was uncomfortable with the use of real footage of a woman giving birth; Hathaway believed it did not contribute to the film's story. Her only release in 2007 was the biographical romantic drama "<a href="Becoming%20Jane">Becoming Jane</a>", as the titular English author <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a>.

She moved to England a month before production began to improve her English accent.

Considering the role to be "a childhood dream come true", Hathaway learned martial arts and dancing techniques in preparation. While filming an action sequence, Hathaway split the flesh of her shin to the bone, which led to her receiving 15 stitches. The film, centering on an analyst who dreams of becoming a real field agent and a better spy, was a financial success. Hathaway's following film, the American-Canadian mystery thriller "<a href="Passengers%20%282008%20film%29">Passengers</a>" alongside <a href="Patrick%20Wilson%20%28American%20actor%29">Patrick Wilson</a>, was a critical and commercial failure.

Hathaway starred in "<a href="Bride%20Wars">Bride Wars</a>" (2009), which she described as "hideously commercial – gloriously so". The romantic comedy, in which she and <a href="Kate%20Hudson">Kate Hudson</a> played two best friends who become rivals after their weddings are scheduled on the same day, was a critical failure; it was named among the 10 worst <a href="chick%20flick">chick flick</a>s of all time by "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" in 2010. Despite this, the film was successful financially and earned Hathaway an <a href="MTV%20Movie%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20in%20a%20Movie">MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance</a> nomination.

For the role, Hathaway spent time with a Parkinson's patient to research the disease. Preparing for the film's nude scenes, she watched the work of the actresses <a href="Kate%20Winslet">Kate Winslet</a> and <a href="Pen%C3%A9lope%20Cruz">Penélope Cruz</a> who, in her opinion, have done nudity with sensitivity and dignity. Hathaway believed that these scenes would not discourage <a href="Social%20conservatism">socially conservative</a> people from watching the film. Critics generally praised the film's adult romance but were unenthusiastic about its plot elements. Hathaway's performance, which Ebert called "warm, lovable", earned her a <a href="Satellite%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture">Satellite Award</a> and a nomination for the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Comedy%20or%20Musical">Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Comedy or Musical</a>.

The film tells the story of two young people who meet twenty years after they shared a one-night stand together. Hathaway was clandestinely given the script, as "One Day" was set in the UK, and Scherfig was not looking for any American actresses for the part. After a nonproductive meeting with Scherfig, Hathaway left a list of songs for her, who after listening to them, cast the actress for the part. In an interview with Peter Travers, Hathaway said she might have inadvertently encouraged misogyny as she did not trust Scherfig as a director, which she felt was because of her gender. Hathaway's <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> accent in the film was considered subpar. Columnist Suzanne Moore, reviewing the film on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a>'s "<a href="Front%20Row%20%28radio%29">Front Row</a>", said Hathaway's accents were "all over the shop", adding, "Sometimes she's from Scotland, sometimes she's from New York, you just can't tell".

Hathaway auditioned not knowing what role she was being considered for, admitting that she had one character in mind, but only learned her role after talking with Nolan for an hour. She described the role as the most physically demanding she had ever played, as she had to redouble her efforts in the gym to keep up with the requirements of the role. Hathaway trained extensively in <a href="martial%20arts">martial arts</a> for the role, and looked to <a href="Hedy%20Lamarr">Hedy Lamarr</a> in developing her role as Catwoman.

Footage of Hathaway singing "<a href="I%20Dreamed%20a%20Dream">I Dreamed a Dream</a>", a song from the film, was shown at <a href="CinemaCon">CinemaCon</a> in April 2012. Hooper described Hathaway's singing as "raw" and "real." Preparing for the role, Hathaway consumed fewer than 500 calories a day to lose , researched prostitution and cut her hair. To get into the character's mental space alone during filming in London, Hathaway sent her husband back to the US; this resulted in her becoming increasingly temperamental. <a href="Christopher%20Orr%20%28film%20critic%29">Christopher Orr</a> from "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>" wrote that "Hathaway gives it everything she has, beginning in quiet sorrow before building to a woebegone climax: she gasps, she weeps, she coughs." Ann Hornaday of "<a href="the%20Washington%20Post">the Washington Post</a>" wrote that "the centerpiece of a movie composed entirely of centerpieces belongs to Anne Hathaway, who as the tragic heroine Fantine sings another of the memorable numbers". For the film, Hathaway won an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Academy</a>, a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture">Golden Globe</a>, a <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Female%20Actor%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">Screen Actors Guild</a> and a <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">BAFTA Award</a> for Best Supporting Actress.

After briefly appearing in the romantic comedy "<a href="Don%20Jon">Don Jon</a>" (2013), Hathaway starred in and co-produced (with her husband and others) "<a href="Song%20One">Song One</a>". In the drama film, she played an anthropology student who returns home to see her injured brother, Henry (played by <a href="Ben%20Rosenfield">Ben Rosenfield</a>), and soon begins a romantic relationship with his favorite musician, James Forester (played by <a href="Johnny%20Flynn%20%28musician%29">Johnny Flynn</a>). Hathaway's character was initially written as 19 years old, but <a href="Kate%20Barker-Froyland">Kate Barker-Froyland</a>, the film's writer and director, changed the part to that of an older woman after casting Hathaway. Hathaway says that the reason she decided to produce the film was because of its depiction of the healing power of music and second chances. For the film's soundtrack, she provided her voice for the song "Afraid of Heights". "Song One" premiered in the U.S. Dramatic Competition at the <a href="2014%20Sundance%20Film%20Festival">30th Sundance Film Festival</a> in January 2014, and released in theaters the following year to mixed reviews from critics.

Hathaway reprised her role as Jewel in the animated film "<a href="Rio%202">Rio 2</a>"—her third film with <a href="Jamie%20Foxx">Jamie Foxx</a>—which was released in 2014. It grossed about five times more than its $103 million budget. Hathaway's only <a href="live%20action">live action</a> film in 2014 was Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction film "<a href="Interstellar%20%28film%29">Interstellar</a>". Set in a <a href="dystopian">dystopian</a> future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity. With a budget of $165 million, the high-profile production, co-starring <a href="Matthew%20McConaughey">Matthew McConaughey</a> and <a href="Jessica%20Chastain">Jessica Chastain</a>, was filmed mostly using <a href="IMAX">IMAX</a> cameras. Hathaway was drawn to her character's growth from an arrogant to a humbler person. While filming a water scene in Iceland, Hathaway almost suffered <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a> because the <a href="dry%20suit">dry suit</a> she was wearing had not been properly secured. Critics for "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" and "Empire" wrote that she was "affecting" as a scientist unable to decide between her professional responsibilities and her feelings and played it with "soulful nuance". "Interstellar", which earned more than $675 million worldwide, earned Hathaway a nomination for a <a href="Saturn%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Saturn Award for Best Actress</a>.

Hathaway began 2015 with an appearance in the first season of the musical reality show "<a href="Lip%20Sync%20Battle">Lip Sync Battle</a>".

Blige</a> and "<a href="Wrecking%20Ball%20%28Miley%20Cyrus%20song%29">Wrecking Ball</a>" by <a href="Miley%20Cyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>. <a href="Nancy%20Meyers">Nancy Meyers</a>' "<a href="The%20Intern%20%282015%20film%29">The Intern</a>" was Hathaway's only film work in 2015. The film tells the story of Ben Whittaker (played by <a href="Robert%20DeNiro">Robert DeNiro</a>), a seventy-year old widower who becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site run by Hathaway's character, Jules Ostin. Hathaway aspired to work with DeNiro and Meyers, her favorite actor and director, respectively; impressed with the film's story, she auditioned for the third time for a Meyers film. Reviews for the film were generally positive; one in Ebert's website found her "extremely appealing" and a reviewer in "<a href="Vulture%20%28magazine%29">Vulture</a>" wrote ""The Intern" gets off on De Niro's amiability and Hathaway's sweet energy". Against a production budget of $35 million, the film grossed $194 million worldwide. The 2015 <a href="Found%20footage%20%28film%20technique%29">found footage</a> horror movie "", about an aspiring Romanian filmmaker who goes to shocking extremes to convince Hathaway to star in his film, was officially selected and had its North American premiere in April 2016 at the <a href="Nashville%20Film%20Festival">Nashville Film Festival</a>.

Hathaway is one of several actors featured on <a href="Barbra%20Streisand">Barbra Streisand</a>'s 2016 album "". Along with <a href="Daisy%20Ridley">Daisy Ridley</a>, Hathaway and Streisand performed the song "<a href="At%20The%20Ballet">At The Ballet</a>" from "<a href="A%20Chorus%20Line">A Chorus Line</a>"; Hathaway played the role of Maggie, one of a trio of dancers hoping to be cast in an upcoming show. Her final film that year was alongside <a href="Jason%20Sudeikis">Jason Sudeikis</a> in <a href="Nacho%20Vigalondo">Nacho Vigalondo</a>'s science fiction black comedy film "<a href="Colossal%20%28film%29">Colossal</a>" (2016). Playing an unemployed young writer, Hathaway was the first actress to sign on at a time when the project had no financial backing. She found herself attached to the genre-hopping nature of the script, later comparing it to "<a href="Being%20John%20Malkovich">Being John Malkovich</a>" (1999), one of her favorite films. The film received positive reviews from critics, but earned only $4 million at the box-office.

After a two-year absence from the screen, Hathaway starred as a famous actress in the all-female spin-off of the <a href="Ocean%27s%20Trilogy">"Ocean's Eleven" franchise</a>, "<a href="Ocean%27s%208">Ocean's 8</a>", directed by <a href="Gary%20Ross">Gary Ross</a>.

Hathaway said she found it fun to play someone with an immense ego and saw the role as an opportunity "to lean into all the ridiculous fame nonsense that I've been trying to side-step for all of these years." Hathaway hoped that the film would be profitable so that it could debunk claims that films with female protagonists do not succeed commercially. Many critics felt that Hathaway's performance overshadowed those of her co-stars'; <a href="ABC%20Online">ABC Online</a>'s Jason Di Rosso wrote she "shines in [a] disappointing" spin-off, adding, "the film's best moments belong to Hathaway as the anxiety-ridden, vain and capricious starlet. She's the only successful meld of comedy and pathos—a victim of the celebrity treadmill who is also capable of outsmarting it." The film earned a total of over $297 million worldwide on a production budget of $70 million.

In 2019, Hathaway co-starred in <a href="Steven%20Knight">Steven Knight</a>'s thriller film "<a href="Serenity%20%282018%20film%29">Serenity</a>", alongside <a href="Matthew%20McConaughey">Matthew McConaughey</a> and <a href="Diane%20Lane">Diane Lane</a>. She dyed her hair blonde for her role, a woman who tasks her ex-husband (McConaughey) to kill her new abusive husband. The film received negative reviews; "The Washington Post" criticized Hathway's performance as "cartoonish", writing that her <a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a> character was reminiscent of "a kind of live-action <a href="Jessica%20Rabbit">Jessica Rabbit</a>".

She gave birth to their son, Jonathan, in 2016. That year, Hathaway purchased an apartment worth $2.55 million in <a href="Upper%20West%20Side">Upper West Side</a>, a neighborhood in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> where she lives with Shulman and their child. Hathaway and Shulman sold their wedding photo and donated its profits to <a href="same-sex%20marriage">same-sex marriage</a> advocacy group <a href="Freedom%20to%20Marry">Freedom to Marry</a>. They also hosted Freedom to Marry's National Engagement Party, an event which raised $500,000.

In early 2007, Hathaway spoke of her experiences with depression during her teenage years, saying that she eventually overcame the disorder without medication. In 2008, she began smoking after a stressful summer and the end of her relationship with Follieri. She credited quitting smoking for the subsequent decline in her stress level and returned to being vegetarian. Although Hathaway became a <a href="vegan">vegan</a> in early 2012, she quit while filming "Interstellar" in August 2014.

Hathaway has served as a long-term advocate for the Nike Foundation to raise awareness against <a href="child%20marriage">child marriage</a>. In July 2006, she spent a week in <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> to help vaccinate children against <a href="hepatitis%20A">hepatitis A</a>. She has also traveled to other countries to heed the rights of women and girls, including Kenya and Ethiopia. In 2008, she was honored at "<a href="Elle%20%28magazine%29">Elle</a>" magazine's "Women in Hollywood" tribute and won an award from the Human Rights Campaign for her philanthropy; she was also honored for her work with Step Up Women's Network in 2008. She then teamed up in 2010 with <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> in a two-year development program "The Girl Effect" whose mission focuses on helping empower girls in developing and developed nations where one-third of young women are not employed and not in school. In 2013, she provided the narration for "<a href="Girl%20Rising">Girl Rising</a>", a <a href="CNN">CNN</a> documentary film, which focused on the power of female education as it followed seven girls around the world who sought to overcome obstacles and follow their dreams.

Hathaway currently serves on the board of the Lollipop Theatre Network and is involved with charities <a href="Creative%20Coalition">Creative Coalition</a>, <a href="St.%20Jude%20Children%27s%20Research%20Hospital">St. Jude Children's Research Hospital</a> and the Human Rights Campaign. She is a supporter of <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> rights and has donated money to organizations that support gay marriage. In 2016, Hathaway was appointed <a href="UN%20Women">UN Women</a> <a href="Goodwill%20ambassador">Goodwill ambassador</a> based on her advocacy for gender equity. The following year, she spoke on <a href="International%20Women%27s%20Day">International Women's Day</a> in favor of paid <a href="parental%20leave">parental leave</a> for both men and women. To promote an increased awareness of systemic <a href="sexism">sexism</a> in the entertainment industry, Hathaway has advocated for greater professional opportunities for women and criticized Hollywood as not being a place for equality. In 2018, she collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the <a href="Time%27s%20Up%20%28movement%29">Time's Up</a> initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination. Hathaway has also spoken out against the issues of bullying of gay students, discrimination toward transgender children and <a href="white%20supremacy">white supremacy</a>.

John Hiscock of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" finds Hathaway a "well-grounded, friendly young woman with a good sense of humour, a wide smile and an easy-going attitude". He says that despite considerable success Hathaway has never "gone Hollywood", staying close to her friends. The authors of the book "365 Style" note Hathaway's <a href="girl%20next%20door">girl next door</a> image and Nancy Meyers (who directed her in "The Intern") says she is "wise beyond her years". Laura Brown in "<a href="Harper%27s%20Bazaar">Harper's Bazaar</a>" considers her to be a "sincere", "warm and funny" woman. After her Golden Globe acceptance speech for "Les Misérables", some members of the media began to dismiss her as "too-actress-y, over-eager" and inauthentic. Addressing this, Hathaway said in 2014 that she feels anxious speaking to the public, but has since grown from it and become a more compassionate person. Regarding her perceived image, she says, "People have this idea of me as just being a very prim, professional girl, which I suppose I am, but I do cut loose and have fun in my life".
Hathaway is one of the most accomplished actresses of her generation. In a review of her work in "Twelfth Night", Charles Isherwood wrote, "on screen or onstage Ms. Hathaway possesses the unmistakable glow of a natural star". An "<a href="Esquire%20%28magazine%29">Esquire</a>" writer says many of her good performances have been overlooked, describing her career as "subtle brilliance that has largely gone unnoticed". Discussing her career in 2015, Hathaway said that after her breakthrough in "The Princess Diaries", she struggled to find serious roles or ones that were not about princesses. According to Judi Gugliemli of "People", Hathaway used this fear of being typecast as motivation to build a versatile body of work. Gugliemli believes that Hathaway's ability to extensively research her roles is the key to her success. A writer for "The Daily Telegraph" commends her willingness to appear in different genres, ranging from action comedies to dramas. Hathaway aspires to appear in many different films, work with different directors and play diverse roles. She says she would be "lost" without acting and feels lucky to have found it as her profession. A trained stage actress, she prefers performing on stage to film roles and claims to be terrified of acting in front of camera. "I always assume that every film is my last, and I always assume that I have to go out and convince everybody why they have to hire me. I still audition", she explains.

"<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" reported Hathaway as one of the highest paid actresses of 2015, and since 2017 she is among the highest-grossing actresses of the 21st century. In 2009, Hathaway was included in "Forbes" annual list of <a href="Celebrity%20100">Celebrity 100</a> with earnings of $7 million, and was invited to join the <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a>. Analyzing her earnings in 2010, the magazine included her in Hollywood's Best Actors for the Buck, the highest <a href="Return%20on%20investment">return profit</a> among actresses. By October 2017, her films had grossed $6.4 billion worldwide. Profiled as among the world's leading actresses by "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>", Hathaway, according to Catherine Elsworth of "The Daily Telegraph", is pursued both by directors and cosmetics companies. In January 2008, she joined French luxury perfumes and cosmetics house <a href="Lanc%C3%B4me">Lancôme</a> as the face of their fragrance Magnifique. In 2011, Hathaway became the new face of the Italian company <a href="Tod%27s">Tod's</a>.

Hathaway's sex appeal was picked up by several media outlets; "<a href="FHM">FHM</a>", "People", <a href="AskMen">AskMen</a>, "<a href="Maxim%20%28magazine%29">Maxim</a>", "<a href="Empire%20%28magazine%29">Empire</a>" and "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" have included her in their yearly lists of sexiest women. In 2011, "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times%20Magazine">Los Angeles Times Magazine</a>" listed her as one of the 50 Most Beautiful Women in Film. Elsworth calls her "the hottest young actress in Hollywood". Hathaway disagreed, insisting that she has a "good girl" image and no sex appeal. She refused to undergo <a href="Botox">Botox</a>, saying that she is comfortable in her own skin.

Hathaway's most acclaimed and highest-grossing films, according to the online portal <a href="Box%20Office%20Mojo">Box Office Mojo</a> and the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, include "The Princess Diaries" (2001), "Brokeback Mountain" (2005), "The Devil Wears Prada" (2006), "Get Smart" (2008), "Rachel Getting Married" (2008), "Valentine's Day" (2010), "Alice in Wonderland" (2010), "Love and Other Drugs" (2010), "The Dark Knight Rises" (2012), "Les Misérables" (2012), "Interstellar" (2014), "The Intern" (2015), "Colossal" (2016), and "Ocean's 8" (2018).

Hathaway has been nominated for two <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a>, three <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Awards">Golden Globe Awards</a>, and a <a href="British%20Academy%20Film%20Award">British Academy Film Award</a>. She has won an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild and a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress for "Les Misérables". She has also won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for her voice role in a 2010 episode of "The Simpsons". In November 2018, Hathaway was one of 50 nominees for the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">New Jersey Hall of Fame</a>, an organization that honors contributions to society and the world beyond.

Steve Bruce

Stephen Roger Bruce (born 31 December 1960) is an English professional <a href="Association%20football">football</a> manager and former player. He is the manager of club <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>. Born in <a href="Corbridge">Corbridge</a>, Northumberland, he was a promising schoolboy footballer but was rejected by several professional clubs. He was on the verge of quitting the game altogether when he was offered a trial with <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a>. Bruce was offered an apprenticeship and went on to play more than 200 games for the club before joining <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> in 1984, winning the <a href="1985%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup in 1985</a>.

In 1987, he moved to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, with whom he achieved great success, winning twelve trophies including three <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> titles, three <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>s, one <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> and the <a href="European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a>. He also became the first English player of the 20th century to captain a team to <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">the Double</a>. Despite his success on the field, he was never selected to play for the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England national team</a>. Commentators and contemporaries have described him as one of the best English players of the 1980s and 1990s never to play for his country at full international level.

Bruce began his managerial career with <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>, and spent short periods of time managing <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a>, <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> and <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> before joining <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> in 2001. He twice led Birmingham to <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> to the Premier League during his tenure of nearly six years, but resigned in 2007 to begin a second spell as manager of Wigan. At the end of the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football">2008–09 season</a> he resigned to take over as manager of <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>, a post he held until he was dismissed in November 2011. Seven months later, he was appointed manager of <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a> and led the club to two promotions to the Premier League, as well as the <a href="2014%20FA%20Cup%20Final">2014 FA Cup Final</a>, before leaving in July 2016. He took over at <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> four months later but was dismissed in October 2018. He took over as manager of Sheffield Wednesday in February 2019.

Bruce was born in <a href="Corbridge">Corbridge</a> in Northumberland, the elder of two sons of Joe and Sheenagh Bruce. His father was local, and his mother had been born in <a href="Bangor%2C%20County%20Down">Bangor</a> in Northern Ireland. The family lived in Daisy Hill near <a href="Wallsend">Wallsend</a>, and Bruce attended <a href="Benfield%20School">Benfield School</a>.

Bruce, a boyhood fan of <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>, claims to have sneaked into <a href="St%20James%27%20Park">St James' Park</a> without paying to watch the team play, saying "I have always been a <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a> lad and when I was a kid, I crawled under the turnstiles to get in to try and save a <a href="Shilling">bob</a> or whatever it was. They were my team, I went to support them as a boy and being a <a href="Geordie">Geordie</a> it's in-bred, you follow the club still the same today." Like several other future professionals from the area, he played football for <a href="Wallsend%20Boys%20Club">Wallsend Boys Club</a>. He was also selected for the Newcastle Schools representative team, and at the age of 13 was among a group of players from the team selected to serve as <a href="ball%20boy">ball boy</a>s at the <a href="1974%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1974 League Cup Final</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>.

Having been turned down by several professional clubs, including Newcastle United, <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>, <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> and <a href="Southport%20F.C.">Southport</a>, Bruce was about to start work as an apprentice plumber at the <a href="Swan%20Hunter">Swan Hunter</a> dockyard when he was offered a trial by <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> club <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a>, whose manager <a href="Gerry%20Summers">Gerry Summers</a> had seen him playing for Wallsend in an international youth tournament. He travelled down to <a href="Kent">Kent</a> with another player from the Wallsend club, <a href="Peter%20Beardsley">Peter Beardsley</a>, but although Gillingham signed Bruce as an apprentice, they turned Beardsley away. At the time Bruce was playing as a <a href="midfielder">midfielder</a>, but he was switched to the centre of defence by the head of Gillingham's youth scheme, <a href="Bill%20Collins%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201920%29">Bill Collins</a>, whom Bruce cites as the single biggest influence on his career.

Bruce spent the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20in%20English%20football">1978–79 season</a> in Gillingham's <a href="reserve%20team">reserve team</a> and, despite playing in defence, scored 18 goals to finish the season as top scorer. In January 1979, he was selected to represent the <a href="England%20national%20under-18%20football%20team">England youth</a> team, and he went on to gain eight caps, participating in the <a href="1980%20UEFA%20European%20Under-18%20Championship">1980 UEFA European Under-18 Championship</a>. He came close to making his debut for the club's senior team in May 1979, but Summers decided at the last minute that, as Gillingham were chasing <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> from the Third Division, Bruce was not yet ready to handle the pressure of the occasion. He eventually made his senior debut in a <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> tie against <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a> on 11 August 1979, and made an immediate impact in the team, winning the club's Player of the Year award at the end of the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20in%20English%20football">1979–80 season</a>. He went on to make more than 200 appearances for the club, and was twice voted into the <a href="Professional%20Footballers%27%20Association">Professional Footballers' Association</a>'s Third Division Team of the Year.

Confident that he was being targeted by clubs from higher divisions, Bruce resolved not to sign a new contract with Gillingham when his existing deal expired at the end of the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20in%20English%20football">1983–84 season</a>. In an April 1983 match against <a href="Newport%20County%20A.F.C.">Newport County</a>, he attempted, in a moment of anger, to deliberately injure opposition player <a href="Tommy%20Tynan">Tommy Tynan</a>, but connected awkwardly and succeeded only in breaking his own leg, leaving him unable to play again for six months. He returned in time to play a key role in Gillingham achieving two draws against <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> in 1984, attracting the attention once again of <a href="scout%20%28sport%29">scouts</a> from <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> clubs. <a href="Arthur%20Cox%20%28footballer%29">Arthur Cox</a>, manager of Bruce's beloved Newcastle United, expressed an interest in signing the player, but resigned from his job before any further action could be taken. Bruce eventually opted to sign for <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> in August 1984 for a fee variously reported as £125,000 or £135,000. In 2009, he was voted into Gillingham's <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a>.

Bruce began the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20in%20English%20football">1984–85 season</a> by scoring an <a href="own%20goal">own goal</a> in the first minute of his debut for Norwich against <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, but went on to score the team's winning goal in the semi-final of the League Cup against local rivals <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>, and was named man of the match in Norwich's victory in <a href="1985%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">the final</a>. Bruce was voted <a href="Norwich%20City%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Norwich City Player of the Year</a>, but the team was <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegated</a> to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>. Bruce played in every match as Norwich won promotion back to the top division at the first time of asking in the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20in%20English%20football">1985–86 season</a>, after which he was chosen to replace the departing <a href="Dave%20Watson">Dave Watson</a> as club <a href="Captain%20%28sports%29">captain</a>. The following season he helped the club to its highest ever league finish of fifth position.

In 1987, he was chosen to captain the <a href="England%20national%20football%20B%20team">England B team</a> in a match against the <a href="Malta%20national%20football%20team">full national team of Malta</a>, but it was to be his only appearance in an England shirt, and he has subsequently been described as one of the best defenders of his era never to be selected for <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">the full England team</a>. Bruce later stated, "I bumped into former England manager <a href="Bobby%20Robson">Bobby Robson</a> in <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a>" (sic)". He came up to me and said 'I should have capped you'. It was nice to hear but it still didn't get me one ... I'll always be a little disappointed I didn't get one."

Bruce began to attract the attention of big-name clubs in late 1987, with <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> and <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> all reported to be interested in signing him. Manchester United quickly emerged as the front runners for his signature, and Bruce publicly expressed his desire to sign for the club. The deal came close to collapsing when Norwich asked for a transfer fee of £900,000 after initially agreeing to accept £800,000, leading to Bruce refusing to play any further matches for the club, which he felt was jeopardising his dream move. On 17 December 1987, shortly before his 27th birthday, the deal was concluded and Bruce officially left <a href="Carrow%20Road">Carrow Road</a>, for a fee reported as £800,000 or £825,000. Norwich fans remembered his contribution, and in 2002 voted him into the <a href="List%20of%20Norwich%20City%20F.C.%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20members">Norwich City Hall of Fame</a>.

Bruce made his Manchester United debut in a 2–1 win over <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> on 19 December 1987, and played in 21 of United's remaining 22 league fixtures, helping the club to a top two place in the First Division for the first time since 1980. The team only finished in mid-table in the following season, prompting manager <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a> to bring in several new players, including <a href="Gary%20Pallister">Gary Pallister</a>, who joined the club in August 1989 from <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a>. His partnership with Bruce in the centre of defence was described in 2006 by the then-United captain, <a href="Gary%20Neville">Gary Neville</a>, as the best in the club's history. "Dolly and Daisy", as the pair were affectionately known, are described as "arguably the best" on the official Manchester United website. Bruce and Pallister were part of the team that won the <a href="1990%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1990 FA Cup Final</a> against <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> in a replay.

Following the lifting of the five-year ban on English clubs from European competitions, which had been imposed after the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel Stadium disaster</a>, United became England's first entrants into the <a href="European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> in the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1990–91 season</a>. Bruce played regularly, and scored three goals, in the team's progress to <a href="1991%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">the final</a> against <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>. He came close to scoring the first goal, only for <a href="Mark%20Hughes">Mark Hughes</a> to deflect the ball over the line and claim the goal, and United went on to win the game 2–1. This was a particularly high-scoring season for Bruce, who found the net 13 times in the First Division and 19 times in total in all competitions. He also played again at Wembley, in the <a href="1991%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup final</a>, in which United were defeated by <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> of the Second Division.
Bruce missed several weeks of the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20in%20English%20football">1991–92 season</a> when he underwent an operation on a longstanding <a href="hernia">hernia</a> problem, in which <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>, after a season-long tussle, beat Manchester United to the championship by four points. Bruce helped United win their first-ever League Cup in April 1992, captaining the team in <a href="1992%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">the final</a> in place of the injured <a href="Bryan%20Robson">Bryan Robson</a>. Injuries continued to take their toll upon Robson during the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20in%20English%20football">1992–93 season</a>, leading to Bruce captaining the team in the majority of United's matches during the first season of the new <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. Bruce scored two late goals in a win over Sheffield Wednesday which proved decisive in United winning the inaugural Premier League title, the first time the club had won the championship of English football since 1967, and he and Robson received the trophy jointly after the home victory over <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> on 3 May.

At the height of his success with United, Bruce was contacted by <a href="Jack%20Charlton">Jack Charlton</a>, manager of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Republic of Ireland national team</a>, who had discovered that, due to his mother's place of birth, Bruce was eligible to play for Ireland. Bruce states in his autobiography that further investigation revealed that, while his earlier appearance for England B in a <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendly match</a> was not an issue, his appearances for the England Youth team in a <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a>-sanctioned tournament prohibited him from playing for the senior team of another country. He has subsequently claimed that he chose not to play for Ireland as it would have caused problems for his club at a time when UEFA restricted the number of foreign players that a club could have in their squad in its competitions.

United dominated English football in the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20in%20English%20football">1993–94 season</a>, winning a second consecutive Premier League title and then defeating Chelsea in the <a href="1994%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup final</a> to become only the fourth team, and Bruce the first English captain, to win <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">The Double</a> in the 20th century, The <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20in%20English%20football">1994–95 season</a> was a disappointing one for Bruce and United, as the club failed in its bid to win a third consecutive Premier League title and lost to Everton in the <a href="1995%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup final</a>.

During the following season Bruce was offered the job of manager by three clubs, but Ferguson refused to allow him to pursue the opportunities as he felt the player still had a role to play in the United team. Bruce made a further 30 Premier League appearances, as United managed to overcome a 12-point deficit to Newcastle United to win the championship once again. A week later he was left out of United's squad for the <a href="1996%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup final</a> due to a slight injury. At the end of the match <a href="Eric%20Cantona">Eric Cantona</a>, who had captained the team and scored the only goal in a 1–0 win over Liverpool, attempted to persuade Bruce to be the one to receive the trophy, but Bruce declined. Ferguson denied that Bruce's omission was a sign that his time at the club was nearing an end, but Bruce, then 35 years old, believed that he would be unlikely to be selected for the team during the year remaining on his contract. He opted instead to join First Division club <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> on a <a href="Free%20transfer%20%28association%20football%29">free transfer</a>, having signed a contract valued at nearly £2 million over two years, which made him one of the highest-paid players in the country.

Bruce was among five former Premier League players signed by Birmingham manager <a href="Trevor%20Francis">Trevor Francis</a> to add experience to a squad expected to challenge for promotion. He was made captain of the team, but his Birmingham career was dogged by a series of disagreements with Francis. Director <a href="David%20Sullivan%20%28businessman%29">David Sullivan</a> felt the need to publicly deny rumours that Bruce was lined up to replace Francis as manager after the club's stock market flotation. While playing for Birmingham, Bruce was the subject of several bids from his old Manchester United colleague Bryan Robson to sign for Middlesbrough, but the transfer never happened.

The <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20in%20English%20football">1997–98 season</a> saw Bruce dropped for the first time in his career, for a match against former club Gillingham, and he described himself as "hurt and unhappy" at being left out. By November 1997 he was being left out more frequently, and his omission against <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> provoked a public war of words, which fuelled rumours that the manager was to be dismissed and that Bruce would take over as caretaker until the end of the season. At the end of the season he accepted the post of <a href="player-manager">player-manager</a> of <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>. Though the deal was delayed while Birmingham attempted to negotiate a transfer fee for his playing contract, he took up his new position on 2 July 1998. He played 11 matches for the club before retiring as a player, his final appearance being in a home match against Sunderland on 28 November 1998.

During the early part of his career, Bruce's sometimes over-enthusiastic playing style, which he later described as "rampaging", caused him disciplinary problems. He later developed into a solid and dependable all-round player, characterised as "an honest trier who made the absolute most of limited natural ability". In his prime, he was particularly noted for his calm and deliberate passing of the ball, and his ability to control it under pressure, often with his chest. At the time, <a href="Mark%20Wright%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201963%29">Mark Wright</a> of Liverpool was said to be the only other centre-back able to match Bruce's level of skill in these areas.

Bruce was also known for his unusually high goalscoring rate for a centre-back, resulting from a combination of his ability to powerfully head the ball and his effectiveness in taking <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty kick</a>s. Although lacking poise and grace, and often criticised for his lack of pace, his bravery and willingness to take knocks from opposition players made him the "heart" of the defence during his time with Manchester United. He was well known for continuing to play even when injured, including returning to the United team at short notice in 1992 even though he was awaiting an operation on a hernia. His indomitable spirit and motivational abilities were deemed vital to the United team, and Alex Ferguson has commented on his "determination and heart".

In his first season as a manager, Bruce guided Sheffield United to eighth place in the First Division, nine points away from a place in the play-offs. He caused controversy when he attempted to take his team off the pitch during an FA Cup match against <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. Bruce felt that the Gunners had broken an unwritten rule of sportsmanship by scoring the winning goal from a throw-in instead of returning the ball to United, who had intentionally kicked it out of play to allow an injured player to be attended to. Although the game eventually continued to a finish, following a gesture by Arsenal the match was declared void and replayed. In May 1999, Bruce resigned from his post after just one season in charge, citing turmoil in the club's boardroom and a shortage of funds for transfers. He contemplated leaving football for a job in television but was persuaded by <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> owner Barry Rubery to become the club's manager.

Huddersfield were early promotion contenders in the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20in%20English%20football">1999–2000 season</a>, winning six consecutive matches to rise to third place in the First Division table by late November, but lost form and failed to reach the <a href="EFL%20Championship%20play-offs">play-offs</a>. The team continued to struggle at the start of the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football">2000–01 season</a>, gaining just six points from 11 matches, and Bruce was sacked in October 2000. He then became involved in a dispute with Rubery, who accused him of "wasting" £3m on players and having "an ego to feed". Although he was linked with the manager's job at <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a>, Bruce remained out of the game until he was appointed manager of <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> in April 2001. The team reached the Second Division play-offs but lost in the semi-finals, and Bruce almost immediately left the club, where he had been in charge for less than two months, to take over as manager of Crystal Palace.

Although his new club began the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20in%20English%20football">2001–02 season</a> strongly, topping the First Division table and looking well placed for regaining the Premier League place that the club had last held in the 1997–98 season, Bruce tendered his resignation less than three months into the season in order to return to Birmingham City as manager. Although he was initially prevented from doing so by an injunction taken out by Crystal Palace, he was eventually allowed to join the Midlands-based club after a compensation package was agreed. By now he had acquired a reputation as a manager who rarely held down a job for a significant length of time.

Upon his arrival, the Blues were in a mid-table position in the First Division, but a lengthy unbeaten run saw the team qualify for the play-offs. The team went on to beat Bruce's former club Norwich City in the final after a <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shoot-out</a> to gain promotion to the Premier League, ending a 16-year absence from the top level of English football. Birmingham spent the early part of the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20in%20English%20football">2002–03 season</a> struggling near the foot of the Premier League table, but Bruce's signing of <a href="Christophe%20Dugarry">Christophe Dugarry</a> revitalised the team, who ended the season in 13th place and finished higher than local rivals <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> for the first time since the 1970s.

The following season began well for Birmingham, who climbed as high as fourth in the table, but the team's fortunes declined and they could only finish in tenth place at the end of the season. Despite this disappointment, Bruce signed a new contract in June 2004 designed to keep him at <a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20%28stadium%29">St Andrew's</a> for a further five years, but just two months later <a href="Freddy%20Shepherd">Freddy Shepherd</a>, chairman of Newcastle United, was reported to have made Bruce his main target in the search for a new manager to replace Bobby Robson. The club was reportedly prepared to pay Birmingham more than £3 million in compensation, and Bruce himself was said to be keen to take over at St James' Park, but he ultimately remained at Birmingham. He stated that "as far as I'm concerned, I've got a job to do [at Birmingham City] and I'm determined to get on with it", but it was also reported that Newcastle would have been required to pay a much larger compensation fee or face legal action had he been persuaded to switch clubs. Initial expectations were high for the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20in%20English%20football">2004–05 season</a>, but the club once again finished in a mid-table position, ending the season in 12th place.

Following the sacking of <a href="Graeme%20Souness">Graeme Souness</a> as Newcastle manager in February 2006, Bruce was again linked with the job, which ultimately went to <a href="Glenn%20Roeder">Glenn Roeder</a>. By this stage of the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">2005–06 season</a>, Birmingham were struggling in the league, and on 21 March 2006 were beaten 7–0 at home by Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Some supporters of the club began to call for his resignation, but Bruce insisted that he would fight on as manager. The team managed to climb out of the relegation zone for the first time in nearly six months after a win over <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> in early April 2006. However, they were soon overtaken by Portsmouth, whose victory over Wigan Athletic on 29 April left Birmingham mathematically unable to match their points total and therefore relegated.

Although Bruce had the largest transfer budget in the division made available to him, Birmingham made a slow start to the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20in%20English%20football">2006–07 season</a> in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> and, after a 1–0 defeat at home to Norwich City, the team's fifth consecutive match without a win, there were calls from fans and local journalists for the manager to be sacked. Bruce publicly accepted responsibility for the team's poor run and admitted that he feared for his job, but the team responded with a 1–0 victory over Derby County, and then recorded a further five consecutive league victories to be joint leaders of the league table by late November. On 29 April 2007, Birmingham secured promotion to the Premier League, with one match to play, by virtue of Derby County's 2–0 defeat at Crystal Palace. Chairman <a href="David%20Gold%20%28businessman%29">David Gold</a> told the press "There have been some dark days but Steve has been outstanding. He was determined to bounce back. He has rebuilt the team and now we are all back where we want to be."

In May 2007, Birmingham's board agreed a new contract for Bruce, but the unwillingness of the club's prospective purchaser <a href="Carson%20Yeung">Carson Yeung</a> to ratify it left his future uncertain. In October 2007, Bolton Wanderers were refused permission to speak to him about their managerial vacancy.
Later that month, Bruce and Yeung held a meeting which reportedly had positive results. Bruce later claimed that Birmingham's managing director <a href="Karren%20Brady">Karren Brady</a> had "shafted" him on a new contract with the club, and when Wigan Athletic requested permission to speak to Bruce about their managerial vacancy, he was receptive to their approach. As required under the terms of his contract, Wigan agreed to pay Birmingham a then-<a href="Transfer%20%28association%20football%29%23Managers">world record</a> compensation for the loss of his services of around £3m, and they were then allowed to speak to him. On 19 November, Wigan announced the signing of Bruce for a second time.

On 21 November, during a press conference which was intended to formally present Bruce as the new manager of Wigan, the club's chief executive Brenda Spencer informed the media that the deal had been put on hold by "unknown issues" between Bruce and Birmingham City, reported to centre on the advance payment of the image rights element of Bruce's contract at St Andrew's. On 23 November 2007 Wigan announced that Bruce had now signed his contract and would officially rejoin the Latics. His first game in charge was a 1–1 home draw with <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> on 1 December 2007. Wigan spent the remainder of the season struggling against relegation, but the club secured Premier League survival with victory over Aston Villa in the penultimate game of the season. In September 2008, Bruce was once again linked with the manager's job at Newcastle United following the departure of <a href="Kevin%20Keegan">Kevin Keegan</a>.

Bruce led Wigan to an 11th-place finish in the 2008–09 season, despite the loss of midfielder <a href="Wilson%20Palacios">Wilson Palacios</a> to Tottenham Hotspur in the January transfer window.

On 27 May 2009, Bruce was reported to have been given permission to talk to Sunderland about succeeding <a href="Ricky%20Sbragia">Ricky Sbragia</a>, who resigned as manager after the last match of the season. Bruce was confirmed as the new manager of Sunderland on 3 June after signing a three-year contract. He was joined at Sunderland by three of his former Wigan Athletic coaching staff, assistant <a href="Eric%20Black">Eric Black</a>, goalkeeping coach <a href="Nigel%20Spink">Nigel Spink</a>, and reserve team coach <a href="Keith%20Bertschin">Keith Bertschin</a>. In his first season at Sunderland, despite a run of 14 games without a win, Bruce led the Black Cats to a 13th-place finish in the Premier League.

Bruce made wholesale changes to Sunderland's squad, signing 13 players and selling 15 in his first 18 months at the club. On 25 February 2011, Bruce signed an extension to his contract, keeping him at Sunderland until 2014, with chairman <a href="Niall%20Quinn">Niall Quinn</a> stating that "In only 18 months he has reshaped our squad beyond recognition, bringing in some fantastically talented players. He embodies the ethos of teamwork and the importance of camaraderie in creating a wonderful spirit of togetherness amongst the players and staff".

Bruce was dismissed as manager on 30 November 2011, with Sunderland in 16th position following a poor run of form which culminated with a 2–1 home defeat to bottom club Wigan four days earlier. He later linked his dismissal from the managerial post with the fact that he is a fan of Newcastle United, Sunderland's <a href="Tyne%E2%80%93Wear%20derby">bitter rivals</a>.

On 8 June 2012, Bruce was appointed as manager at Championship club <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a> on a three-year contract. In his first season with the club, he led them to promotion to the Premier League, clinching second place in the Championship on the final day of the season. The following season, the "Tigers" came 16th with a club record tally of 37 points, and reached the final of the FA Cup for the first time. They took a two-goal lead in the first ten minutes of <a href="2014%20FA%20Cup%20Final">the final</a>, but opponents Arsenal scored a goal in each half to take the game into extra-time and then scored a third to win the trophy. Reaching the final qualified Hull for the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2014–15 UEFA Europa League</a>, their first European campaign.

In March 2015, Bruce signed a three-year contract extension. A run of poor form left Hull near the bottom of the table going into the final game of the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20in%20English%20football">2014–15</a> season and needing to defeat Bruce's former club Manchester United to stand any chance of avoiding relegation. They could only manage a 0–0 draw and were relegated to the Championship. The poor performances of a number of players signed by Bruce, including club record signing <a href="Abel%20Hern%C3%A1ndez">Abel Hernández</a>, were identified as key factors in the club's failure to remain in the Premier League.

In January 2016, Bruce won the <a href="EFL%20Championship%20Manager%20of%20the%20Month">Championship Manager of the Month</a> after leading Hull to four victories; Hernández, who scored six times, got the <a href="EFL%20Championship%20Player%20of%20the%20Month">players' equivalent</a>. Hull finished the season in fourth, qualifying for <a href="2016%20Football%20League%20play-offs">the play-offs</a>, where they defeated Derby County in the semi-finals. In the final on 28 May, a 25-yard goal from <a href="Mohamed%20Diam%C3%A9">Mohamed Diamé</a> against Sheffield Wednesday won Hull promotion to the Premier League for the second time during Bruce's spell in charge. Bruce said after the game that he had considered resignation following the team's relegation, and would hold talks with the prospective new owners to be assured of his future. In July 2016, with his future at Hull seemingly still uncertain, he was interviewed by officials of <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> concerning the vacant position of manager of England. Three days later, Bruce met with Hull City officials and announced his resignation later that day amid claims he became frustrated by a lack of transfer activity at the club.

On 12 October 2016, Bruce was appointed manager of Championship club Aston Villa. In his second match in charge, Villa defeated <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a>, the club's first win in 11 games and the first away win for 14 months. He brought in <a href="Colin%20Calderwood">Colin Calderwood</a> as assistant manager from <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion">Brighton & Hove Albion</a> and <a href="Stephen%20Clemence">Stephen Clemence</a> from old club Hull City as first-team coach. In the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20in%20English%20football">2017–18</a> season, Villa secured a play-off place and defeated Middlesbrough to reach <a href="2018%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20Final">the final</a>, but lost 1–0 to <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> in the final and thus missed out on promotion to the Premier League. On 2 October 2018, Villa surrendered a two-goal lead, drawing 3–3 at home to bottom club <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a>. One spectator threw a cabbage at Bruce and there were calls from home fans on the <a href="Holte%20End">Holte End</a> for Bruce to go. The following day, he was sacked by Villa after a poor run of form.

In January 2019, Bruce was appointed manager of Championship club Sheffield Wednesday with effect from the start of the following month. On 27 January, his delay in taking up this appointment was criticised by "<a href="Match%20of%20the%20Day">Match of the Day</a>" pundits <a href="Danny%20Murphy%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201977%29">Danny Murphy</a> and <a href="Ruud%20Gullit">Ruud Gullit</a> during a 3–0 FA Cup defeat away to Chelsea. Bruce subsequently defended his decision, as he had had two operations since leaving Aston Villa and needed time to recuperate, as well as the need to recover from the death of both his parents in 2018.

Bruce has been married since February 1983 to Janet (née Smith), who is also from the <a href="Hexham">Hexham</a> area, and went to the same school as Bruce. The couple have two children, <a href="Alex%20Bruce%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201984%29">Alex</a> (born 1984) and Amy (born 1987). Alex is also a footballer, and was signed by his father for Hull City in July 2012. He had previously played under his father's management at Birmingham City, but left the club in 2006, in part due to accusations of <a href="nepotism">nepotism</a> levelled at his father. Amy was linked romantically with Aston Villa player <a href="Lee%20Hendrie">Lee Hendrie</a> in tabloid newspaper stories in 2004, which provoked an angry response from her father, who described the reports as "lies", and claimed that journalists had gone so far as to contact his doctor and examine his household waste in an attempt to uncover gossip. In September 2004, Bruce was involved in an altercation outside his home with two men who were attempting to steal his daughter's car. The affray left him with facial injuries but did not prevent him from travelling to a Premier League match the same day. After the incident one newspaper attempted to connect it with the allegations concerning Hendrie, leading Bruce to contemplate legal action.

Bruce's autobiography, "Heading for Victory", was published in 1994. In 1999, while manager of Huddersfield, he wrote a trio of novels: "Striker!", "Sweeper!" and "Defender!". The books centred on fictional football manager Steve Barnes, based on Bruce, who solved murder mysteries and thwarted terrorists. Bruce later expressed his embarrassment at the books, which have become sought-after collectables.

Irish phonology

The phonology of the Irish language varies from <a href="Irish%20language%23Dialects">dialect to dialect</a>; there is no <a href="standard%20language">standard pronunciation</a> of <a href="Irish%20language">Irish</a>. Therefore, this article focuses on phenomena that pertain generally to most or all dialects, and on the major differences among the dialects. Detailed discussion of the dialects can be found in the specific articles: <a href="Ulster%20Irish">Ulster Irish</a>, <a href="Connacht%20Irish">Connacht Irish</a>, and <a href="Munster%20Irish">Munster Irish</a>.

Irish <a href="phonology">phonology</a> has been studied as a discipline since the late 19th century, with numerous researchers publishing <a href="descriptive%20linguistics">descriptive</a> accounts of dialects from all regions where the language is spoken. More recently, Irish phonology has been the focus of <a href="theoretical%20linguist">theoretical linguist</a>s, who have produced a number of books, articles, and doctoral theses on the topic.

One of the most important aspects of Irish phonology is that almost all <a href="consonant">consonant</a>s come in pairs, with one having a "broad" pronunciation and the other a "slender" one. Broad consonants are either <a href="velarized">velarized</a> (that is, the back of the tongue is pulled back and slightly up in the direction of the <a href="soft%20palate">soft palate</a> while the consonant is being articulated) or simply <a href="Velar%20consonant">velar</a> (e.g. ). Slender consonants are <a href="Palatalization%20%28phonetics%29">palatalized</a>, which means the tongue is pushed up toward the <a href="hard%20palate">hard palate</a> during the articulation. The contrast between broad and slender consonants is crucial in Irish, because the meaning of a word can change if a broad consonant is substituted for a slender consonant or vice versa. For example, the only difference in pronunciation between the words ('cow') and ('alive') is that is pronounced with a broad "b" sound, while is pronounced with a slender "b" sound. The contrast between broad and slender consonants plays a critical role not only in distinguishing the individual consonants themselves, but also in the pronunciation of the surrounding <a href="vowel">vowel</a>s, in the determination of which consonants can stand next to which other consonants, and in the behavior of words that begin with a vowel. This broad/slender distinction is similar to the hard/soft one of several Slavic languages, like <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>.

The Irish language shares a number of phonological characteristics with its nearest linguistic relatives, <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a> and <a href="Manx%20language">Manx</a>, as well as with <a href="Hiberno-English">Hiberno-English</a>, with which it is in the closest <a href="language%20contact">language contact</a>.

Until the end of the nineteenth century, linguistic discussions of Irish focused either on the traditional grammar of the language (issues like the <a href="inflection">inflection</a> of nouns, verbs and adjectives) or on the <a href="historical%20linguistics">historical</a> development of sounds from <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> through <a href="Proto-Celtic">Proto-Celtic</a> to <a href="Old%20Irish">Old Irish</a>. The first <a href="descriptive%20linguistics">descriptive</a> analysis of the phonology of an Irish dialect was , which was based on <a href="Franz%20Nikolaus%20Finck">the author</a>'s fieldwork in the <a href="Aran%20Islands">Aran Islands</a>. This was followed by , a phonetic description of the dialect of Meenawannia near <a href="Glenties">Glenties</a>, County Donegal. is predominantly a historical account, but has some description of modern dialects as well. <a href="Alf%20Sommerfelt">Alf Sommerfelt</a> published early descriptions of both <a href="Ulster%20Irish">Ulster</a> and <a href="Munster%20Irish">Munster varieties</a> ( and for the village of Torr in <a href="Gweedore">Gweedore</a>, for Munster, and for the now extinct dialect of South <a href="County%20Armagh">Armagh</a>). The dialect of <a href="Dunquin">Dunquin</a> on the <a href="Dingle%20Peninsula">Dingle Peninsula</a> was described by . From 1944 to 1968 the <a href="Dublin%20Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Studies">Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies</a> published a series of monographs, each describing the phonology of one local dialect: for West Muskerry in <a href="County%20Cork">County Cork</a> (<a href="Ballyvourney">Ballyvourney</a>, <a href="Coolea">Coolea</a> and vicinity), (first published 1945) for <a href="Cois%20Fhairrge">Cois Fhairrge</a> in <a href="County%20Galway">County Galway</a> (<a href="Barna">Barna</a>, <a href="Spiddal">Spiddal</a>, <a href="Inverin">Inverin</a> and vicinity), for <a href="An%20Rinn">An Rinn</a>, County Waterford, for <a href="Tourmakeady">Tourmakeady</a> in <a href="County%20Mayo">County Mayo</a>, for <a href="Teelin">Teelin</a>, County Donegal, for <a href="Erris">Erris</a> in County Mayo. More recent descriptive phonology has been published by for <a href="Rosguill">Rosguill</a> in northern Donegal, for Tangaveane and Commeen (also near Glenties), for Iorras Aithneach in <a href="Connemara">Connemara</a> (<a href="Kilkieran">Kilkieran</a> and vicinity), and for the <a href="Dingle%20Peninsula">Dingle Peninsula</a> in County Kerry.

Research into the theoretical phonology of Irish began with , which follows the principles and practices of "<a href="The%20Sound%20Pattern%20of%20English">The Sound Pattern of English</a>" and which formed the basis of the phonology sections of . Dissertations examining Irish phonology from a theoretical point of view include , in <a href="optimality%20theory">optimality theory</a>, and and in <a href="government%20phonology">government phonology</a>.

Most dialects of Irish contain at a minimum the consonant <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a>s shown in the following chart (see <a href="International%20Phonetic%20Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a> for an explanation of the symbols). The consonant is neither broad nor slender.

Broad (velar or velarized) consonants have a noticeable <a href="velar%20approximant">velar offglide</a> (a very short vowel-like sound) before <a href="front%20vowel">front vowel</a>s, which sounds like the English "w" but made without rounding the lips. The IPA symbol for this sound is . Thus ('nine') and ('way, manner') are pronounced and , respectively. This velar offglide is <a href="labialized">labialized</a> (pronounced with lip-rounding, like "w") after <a href="labial%20consonant">labial consonant</a>s, so ('yellow') is pronounced .

Similarly, slender (palatal or palatalized) consonants have a <a href="palatal%20approximant">palatal offglide</a> (like English "y") before <a href="back%20vowel">back vowel</a>s, e.g. ('thick') is pronounced .

When a broad consonant follows a front vowel, there is a very short vowel sound (called an onglide) just before the consonant, e.g. ('sell') is pronounced . Similarly, when a slender consonant follows a back vowel, there is an onglide before the consonant, e.g. ('place') is pronounced , ('drinking' <a href="genitive%20case">gen.</a>) is pronounced , ('understanding') is , and ('to us') is .

 (which can be written as , , or ) has two basic <a href="allophone">allophone</a>s: the <a href="labiovelar%20approximant">labiovelar approximant</a> and the velarized <a href="voiced%20labiodental%20fricative">voiced labiodental fricative</a> . The distribution of these allophones varies from dialect to dialect. In Munster, generally only is found, and in Ulster generally only is found. In Connacht, is found word-initially before vowels (e.g. 'is') and in other positions (e.g. 'saint', 'autumn', and 'hurried').

The remaining labial fricatives are typically <a href="labiodental%20consonant">labiodental</a> , but they as well as the fricative allophone of have <a href="bilabial%20consonant">bilabial</a> allophones in many dialects; the distribution depends partly on environment (bilabials are more likely to be found adjacent to rounded vowels) and partly on the individual speaker.

Among the coronals, most are <a href="alveolar%20consonant">alveolar</a>, but the broad stops and lateral are typically <a href="Dental%20consonant">dental</a> , and the slender coronal fricative is typically <a href="postalveolar%20consonant">postalveolar</a> . The slender coronal stops may be realized as <a href="alveolo-palatal%20consonant">alveolo-palatal</a> <a href="affricate">affricate</a>s in a number of dialects, including Tourmakeady, Erris, and Teelin.

The slender dorsal stops may be articulated as true <a href="Palatal%20consonant">palatals</a> or as <a href="velar%20consonant">palatovelars</a> .

The phoneme has three allophones in most dialects: a <a href="palatal%20approximant">palatal approximant</a> before vowels besides and at the ends of <a href="syllable">syllable</a>s (e.g. 'nice', 'will be'); a <a href="voiced%20palatal%20fricative">voiced (post)palatal fricative</a> before consonants (e.g. 'sun'); and an intermediate sound (with more <a href="fricative%20consonant">frication</a> than but less frication than ) before (e.g. 'straightened').

As in <a href="English%20language">English</a>, <a href="voice%20%28phonetics%29">voiceless</a> <a href="stop%20consonant">stops</a> are <a href="aspiration%20%28phonetics%29">aspirated</a> (articulated with a puff of air immediately upon release) at the start of a word, while voiced stops may be incompletely voiced but are never aspirated. Voiceless stops are unaspirated after and (e.g. 'terror'); however, stops remain aspirated after the <a href="clitic">clitic</a> "is" (e.g. 'it's crooked'). Several researchers (e.g. , , , , and ) use transcriptions like , etc., indicating they consider the stops that occur after voiceless fricatives to be devoiced allophones of the voiced stops rather than unaspirated allophones of the voiceless stops (as is actually the case in <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a>), but this is a minority view.

In <a href="Old%20Irish">Old Irish</a>, the <a href="sonorant">sonorant</a>s (those spelled ) were divided not only into broad and slender types, but also into <a href="fortis%20and%20lenis">fortis and lenis</a> types. The precise phonetic definition of these terms is somewhat vague, but the coronal fortis sounds (those spelled ) were probably longer in duration and may have had a larger area of contact between the tongue and the roof of the mouth than the lenis sounds. Fortis "m" was probably a normal , while lenis "m" was a nasalized semivowel , perhaps tending towards a nasalized fricative or when palatalized. By convention, the fortis coronals are transcribed with <a href="capital%20letters">capital letters</a> , the lenis with lower case (some authors, such as , instead use Latin for fortis and Greek for lenis). Thus Old Irish had four <a href="rhotic%20consonant">rhotic</a> phonemes , four <a href="lateral%20consonant">lateral</a> phonemes , and four coronal <a href="nasal%20stop">nasal</a> phonemes . Fortis and lenis sonorants contrasted with each other between vowels and word-finally after vowels in Old Irish, for example ('he shears') vs. ('he may carry'); ('hazel') vs. ('sin'); ('stake') vs. ('sound'). Word-initially, only the fortis sounds were found, but they became lenis in environments where <a href="Irish%20initial%20mutations">morphosyntactically triggered lenition</a> was found: ('mystery') vs. ('his mystery'), ('provision') vs. ('his provision').

In the modern language, the four rhotics have been reduced to two in all dialects, having merged as . For the laterals and nasals, some dialects have kept all four distinct, while others have reduced them to three or two distinct phonemes, as summarized in the following table.

As for fortis and lenis "m", in time the lenis version (nasalized semivowel or labial fricative) came to be pronounced as a regular semivowel or fricative along with nasalization of the preceding vowel. The later loss of between vowels has resulted in phonemically nasalized vowels in some modern dialects (see <a href="%23Nasalized%20vowels">below</a>), but these are not robustly maintained in any dialect; the strong tendency is to eliminate the nasalization entirely. The original nasalized semivowel is still reflected as in the spelling, however.

The <a href="vowel">vowel</a> sounds vary from dialect to dialect, but in general Connacht and Munster at least agree in having the <a href="monophthong">monophthong</a>s , , , , , , , , , , and <a href="schwa">schwa</a> (), which is found only in <a href="stress%20%28linguistics%29">unstressed</a> syllables; and the falling <a href="diphthong">diphthong</a>s , , , and .

The vowels of <a href="Ulster%20Irish">Ulster Irish</a> are more divergent and are not discussed in this article.

The <a href="vowel%20backness">backness</a> of vowels (that is, the horizontal position of the highest point of the tongue) depends to a great extent on the quality (broad or slender) of adjacent consonants. Some researchers (e.g. , , ) have argued that and are actually allophones of the same phoneme, as are and , as in a <a href="vertical%20vowel%20system">vertical vowel system</a>. Under this view, these phonemes are <a href="underspecification">not marked</a> at an abstract level as either <a href="front%20vowel">front vowel</a>s or <a href="back%20vowel">back vowel</a>s. Rather, they acquire a specification for frontness or backness from the consonants around them. In this article, however, the more traditional assumption that are four distinct phonemes will be followed. The descriptions of the allophones in this section come from ; the pronunciations therefore reflect the Munster accent of the <a href="Dingle%20Peninsula">Dingle Peninsula</a>. Unless otherwise noted, however, they largely hold for other Munster and Connacht accents as well.

The four <a href="close%20vowel">close vowel</a> phonemes of Irish are the fully close and , and the <a href="near-close%20vowel">near-close</a> and . Their exact pronunciation depends on the quality of the surrounding consonants. is realized as a <a href="front%20vowel">front</a> between two slender consonants (e.g. 'country'). Between a slender and a broad consonant, the tongue is retracted slightly from this position (for which the IPA symbol is ), e.g. ('sale'), ('berry' gen.). Between two broad consonants, the tongue is retracted even further, almost to the point of being a <a href="central%20vowel">central vowel</a> (in IPA, ): ('sheep'). is a fully back between broad consonants (e.g. 'fort'), but between a broad and a slender consonant, the tongue is somewhat advanced (IPA ), e.g. ('three people'), ('eye'). Between two slender consonants, it is advanced even further, to a centralized vowel (IPA ): ('quiet').
The near-close vowels and show a similar pattern. is realized between slender consonants as a front , e.g. ('house' <a href="dative%20case">dat.</a>). After a slender consonant and before a broad one, it is a <a href="near-front%20vowel">near-front</a> , e.g. ('piece'). After a broad consonant and before a slender one, it is a more retracted , e.g. ('understands'). Finally, between two broad consonants it is a central , e.g. ('salty'). is a <a href="near-back%20vowel">near-back</a> when all adjacent consonants are broad, e.g. ('black'), and a more centralized after a slender consonant, e.g. ('rag').

The realization of the long <a href="close-mid%20vowel">close-mid vowel</a>s and varies according to the quality of the surrounding consonants. is a front between two slender consonants (e.g. 'yell'), a centralized between a broad and a slender consonant (e.g. 'call'), and a more open centralized between two broad consonants (e.g. 'danger'). ranges from a back between two broad consonants (e.g. 'turf') to an advanced between a broad and a slender consonant (e.g. 'turf' [gen.]) to a centralized between two slender consonants (e.g. 'music' [gen.]).

The short <a href="open-mid%20vowel">open-mid vowel</a>s also vary depending on their environment. Short ranges from a front between slender consonants (e.g. 'will be') to a retracted between a broad and a slender consonant (e.g. 'I will be', 'was') to a central when the only adjacent consonant is broad (e.g. 'cross' [dat.]). Short between two broad consonants is usually a back , e.g. ('stone'), but it is a centralized adjacent to <a href="nasal%20stop">nasal consonants</a> and <a href="labial%20consonant">labial consonant</a>s, e.g. ('there') and ('soft'). Between a broad and a slender consonant, it is a more open : ('school'), ('drink').

Unstressed is realized as a near-close, near-front when adjacent to a <a href="palatal%20consonant">palatal consonant</a>, e.g. ('pike'). Next to other slender consonants, it is a mid-centralized , e.g. ('salt water'). Adjacent to broad consonants, it is usually a mid central , e.g. ('information'), but when the preceding syllable contains one of the close back vowels , it is realized as a mid-centralized back , e.g. ('closing'), ('pigs').

The realization of the <a href="open%20vowel">open vowel</a>s varies according to the quality of the surrounding consonants; there is a significant difference between Munster dialects and Connacht dialects as well. In Munster, long and short have approximately the same range of realization: both vowels are relatively back in contact with broad consonants and relatively front in contact with slender consonants. Specifically, long in word-initial position and after broad consonants is a back , e.g. ('place'), ('beach'). Between a slender and a broad consonant, it is a retracted front , e.g. ('will cut'), while between two slender consonants it is a fully front , e.g. ('John' <a href="vocative%20case">voc.</a>). In Dingle, the back allophone is rounded to after broad labials, e.g. ('white'), while in <a href="Ring%2C%20County%20Waterford">Ring, County Waterford</a>, rounded is the usual realization of in all contexts except between slender consonants, where it is a centralized . Short between two slender consonants is a front , as in ('short'). Between a broad and a slender consonant, it is in most cases a retracted , e.g. ('man'), and ('worn'), but after broad labials and it is a centralized front , e.g. ('town'), ('injure'). When it is adjacent only to broad consonants, it is a centralized back , e.g. ('son'), ('say').
In Connacht varieties, the allophones of short are consistently further front than the allophones of long . In Erris, for example, short ranges from a <a href="near-open%20front%20unrounded%20vowel">near-open front vowel</a> before slender consonants (e.g. 'earwax') to an open after slender consonants (e.g. 'bright') to a centralized back between broad consonants (e.g. 'horse'). Long , on the other hand, ranges from a back between broad consonants (e.g. 'boat') to an advanced back before slender consonants (e.g. 'to get') to a centralized back after slender consonants (e.g. 'fine'). In <a href="Toormakeady">Toormakeady</a>, the back allophone is rounded to after broad labials, e.g. ('white'). In Connemara, the allophones of are lengthened in duration, so that only vowel quality distinguishes the allophones of from those of .

The starting point of ranges from a near-open central after broad consonants to an open-mid centralized front after slender consonants, and its end point ranges from a near-close near-front before slender consonants to a centralized before broad consonants. Examples include ('rogue'), ('dog'), ('church'), and ('cure').

The starting point of ranges from a near-open central after broad consonants to an open-mid advanced central after slender consonants, and its end point ranges from a near-close near-back before broad consonants to a centralized before slender consonants. Examples include ('deaf'), ('improvement'), ('speak'), and ('memory'). In West Muskerry and the Dingle Peninsula, however, the starting point of is rounded and further back after broad consonants, e.g. ('goat').
The starting point of ranges from a close front after slender consonants to a retracted after word-initial broad (the only context in which it appears after a broad consonant). Its end point ranges from a mid central before broad consonants to a close-mid centralized front before slender consonants. Examples include ('sense'), ('ever'), and ('devils').

The starting point of is consistently a close back while the end point ranges from to : ('above'), ('lamb'), ('strike').

In general, vowels in Irish are <a href="nasalization">nasalized</a> when adjacent to <a href="nasal%20consonant">nasal consonant</a>s. For some speakers, there are reported to be <a href="minimal%20pair">minimal pair</a>s between <a href="nasal%20vowel">nasal vowel</a>s and oral vowels, indicating that nasal vowels are also separate phonemes; these generally result from an earlier nasalized semivowel (historically the lenited version of ), that has since been lost. However, the contrast is not robust in any dialect; most published descriptions say that contrastively nasal vowels are present in the speech of only some (usually older) speakers. Potential minimal pairs include those shown in the table below.

In addition, where a vowel is nasalized because it is adjacent to a nasal consonant, it often retains its nasalization in related forms where the consonant is no longer nasal. For example, the nasal of ('mother') is replaced by nonnasal in the phrase ('his mother'), but the vowel remains nasalized. Similarly, in ('snow') the vowel after the is nasalized, while in ('the snow' gen.), the is replaced by in some northern dialects, but the nasalized vowel remains.

The most interesting aspects of Irish <a href="phonotactics">phonotactics</a> revolve around the behavior of <a href="consonant%20cluster">consonant cluster</a>s. Here it is important to distinguish between clusters that occur at the beginnings of words and those that occur after vowels, although there is overlap between the two groups.

Irish words can begin with clusters of two or three consonants. In general, all the consonants in a cluster agree in their quality, i.e. either all are broad or all are slender. Two-consonant clusters consist of an <a href="obstruent%20consonant">obstruent consonant</a> followed by a <a href="liquid%20consonant">liquid</a> or <a href="nasal%20stop">nasal consonant</a> (however, labial obstruents may not be followed by a nasal); examples (from ) include ('milking'), ('fine'), ('button'), ('law'), ('usual'), ('idiot'), ('slice'), ('snow'), ('poker'), and ('long for'). In addition, and may be followed by a voiceless stop, as in ('purse') and ('story'). Further, the cluster occurs in the word ('women') and a few forms related to it. Three-consonant clusters consist of or plus a voiceless stop plus a liquid. Examples include ('rumpus'), ('scream'), ('flash'), ('fun'), and ('streak').

One exception to quality agreement is that broad is found before slender labials (and for some speakers in Connemara and Dingle before as well). Examples include: ('berries'), ('scythe'), ('dependent'), ('inspire'), and ('story').

In the environment of an initial <a href="consonant%20mutation">consonant mutation</a>, there is a much wider range of possible onset clusters; for example, in a lenition environment the following occur: ('tasted'), ('broke'), ('practiced'), ('bent'), ('stuck'), ('acted'), ('slipped'), ('swam'), ('reached'). In an eclipsis environment, the following are found: ('flower'), ('years'), ('you would break'), ('warp'), ('bridge'), ('ladder'), ('you would dress'), ('you would leave'), ('you would act').

In Donegal, Mayo, and Connemara dialects (but not usually on the Aran Islands), the coronal nasals can follow only respectively in a word-initial cluster. After other consonants, they are replaced by : ('hill'), ('women'), ('liking'), ('long for').

Under lenition, become as expected in these dialects, but <a href="Irish%20initial%20mutations%23After%20proclitics">after the definite article "an"</a> they become : ('snow'), ('snow' [lenited form]), ('the snow' gen.).

Like word-initial consonant clusters, post-vocalic consonant clusters usually agree in broad or slender quality. The only exception here is that broad , not slender , appears before the slender coronals : ('two people'), ('trade'), ('doors'), ('handle'), ('advice').

A cluster of , , or followed by a labial or dorsal consonant (except the voiceless stops , ) is broken up by an <a href="epenthesis">epenthetic</a> vowel : ('abrupt'), ('blue'), ('mistake'), ('certain'), ('service'), ('anger'), ('dark'), ('bold'), ('dove'), ('pleasant'), ('sparrow'), ('venom'), , (a name for Ireland), ('name'), ('mind'), ('animal').

There is no epenthesis, however, if the vowel preceding the cluster is long or a diphthong: ('wrinkle'), ('term'), ('insight'), ('duty'). There is also no epenthesis into words that are at least three syllables long: ('firmament'), ('throat'), ('dandelion'), ('Carmelite').

Vowel-initial words in Irish exhibit behavior that has led linguists to suggest that the vowel sound they begin with on the surface is not actually the first sound in the word at a more abstract level. Specifically, when a clitic ending in a consonant precedes a word beginning with the vowel, the consonant of the clitic surfaces as either broad or slender, depending on the specific word in question. For example, the "n" of the <a href="definite%20article">definite article</a> ('the') is slender before the word ('wonder') but broad before the word ('age'): ('the wonder' gen.) vs. ('the age').

One analysis of these facts is that vowel-initial words actually begin, at an abstract level of representation, with a kind of "empty" consonant that consists of nothing except the information "broad" or "slender". Another analysis is that vowel-initial words, again at an abstract level, all begin with one of two <a href="semivowel">semivowel</a>s, one triggering palatalization and the other triggering velarization of a preceding consonant.

Where reflexes of the Old Irish <a href="%23Fortis%20and%20lenis%20sonorants">fortis sonorants</a> appear in syllable-final position (in some cases, only in word-final position), they trigger a lengthening or diphthongization of the preceding vowel in most dialects of Irish. The details vary from dialect to dialect.

In Donegal and Mayo, lengthening is found only before "rd, rl, rn", before "rr" (except when a vowel follows), and in a few words also before word-final "ll", for example, ('top'), ('tall'), ('inch'), ('spinning wheel'), ('yonder').

In Connemara, the Aran Islands, and Munster, lengthening is found generally not only in the environments listed above, but also before "nn" (unless a vowel follows) and before "m" and "ng" at the end of a word. For example, the word ('hole') is pronounced in all of these regions, while ('grip') is pronounced in Connemara and Aran and in Munster.

Because vowels behave differently before broad sonorants than before slender ones in many cases, and because there is generally no lengthening (except by <a href="Analogy%23Linguistics">analogy</a>) when the sonorants are followed by a vowel, there is a variety of vowel <a href="alternation%20%28linguistics%29">alternations</a> between different related word-forms. For example, in Dingle ('head') is pronounced with a diphthong, but (the <a href="genitive">genitive</a> singular of the same word) is pronounced with a long vowel, while (the plural, meaning 'heads') is pronounced with a short vowel.

This lengthening has received a number of different explanations within the context of theoretical phonology. All accounts agree that some property of the fortis sonorant is being transferred to the preceding vowel, but the details about what property that is vary from researcher to researcher. argue that the fortis sonorant is <a href="tenseness">tense</a> (a term only vaguely defined phonetically) and that this tenseness is transferred to the vowel, where it is realized phonetically as vowel length and/or diphthongization. argues that the triggering consonant is underlyingly associated with a unit of <a href="syllable%20weight">syllable weight</a> called a <a href="mora%20%28linguistics%29">"mora"</a>; this mora then shifts to the vowel, creating a long vowel or a diphthong. expands on that analysis to argue that the fortis sonorants have an <a href="advanced%20tongue%20root">advanced tongue root</a> (that is, the bottom of the tongue is pushed upward during articulation of the consonant) and that diphthongization is an <a href="articulatory%20phonetics">articulatory</a> effect of this tongue movement.

Where a voiced <a href="obstruent">obstruent</a> or comes into contact with , the is absorbed into the other sound, which then becomes voiceless (in the case of , devoicing is to ). Devoicing is found most prominently in the <a href="future%20tense">future</a> of <a href="Irish%20verbs%23First%20conjugation">first conjugation</a> verbs (where the sound is represented by the letter "f") and in the formation of <a href="verbal%20adjective">verbal adjective</a>s (where the sound is spelled "th"). For example, the verb ('sweep') ends in the voiced consonant , but its future tense ('will sweep') and verbal adjective ('swept') have the voiceless consonant .

Irish exhibits a number of external <a href="sandhi">sandhi</a> effects, i.e. phonological changes across word boundaries, particularly in rapid speech. The most common type of sandhi in Irish is <a href="Assimilation%20%28linguistics%29">assimilation</a>, which means that a sound changes its pronunciation in order to become more similar to an adjacent sound. One type of assimilation in Irish is found when a coronal consonant (one of "d, l, n, r, s, t") changes from being broad to being slender before a word that begins with a slender coronal consonant, or from being slender to being broad before a word that begins with a broad coronal consonant. For example, ('deceive') ends with a broad "ll", but in the phrase ('it deceived me'), the "ll" has become slender because the following word, , starts with a slender coronal consonant.

The consonant "n" may also assimilate to the <a href="place%20of%20articulation">place of articulation</a> of a following consonant, becoming labial before a labial consonant, palatal before a palatal consonant, and velar before a velar consonant. For example, the "nn" of ('one') becomes in ('a lame one') and in ('a scabbed one'). A voiced consonant at the end of a word may become voiceless when the next word begins with a voiceless consonant, as in ('he bent'), where the "b" sound of ('bent') has become a "p" sound before the voiceless "s" of .

An Irish word normally has only one <a href="stress%20%28linguistics%29">stressed</a> syllable, namely the first syllable of the word. In IPA transcription, a stressed syllable is marked with the symbol to the left of the syllable. Examples include ('left' [past tense of "leave"]) and ('dishonor'). However, certain words, especially <a href="adverb">adverb</a>s and <a href="loanword">loanword</a>s, have stress on a noninitial syllable, e.g. ('only'), ('tobacco').

In most <a href="compound%20%28linguistics%29">compound</a> words, primary stress falls on the first member and a <a href="secondary%20stress">secondary stress</a> (marked with ) falls on the second member, e.g. ('spent bog'). Some compounds, however, have primary stress on both the first and the second member, e.g. ('a terrible lie').

In Munster, stress is attracted to a long vowel or diphthong in the second or third syllable of a word, e.g. ('girl'), ('request'). In the now-extinct accent of East Mayo, stress was attracted to a long vowel or diphthong in the same way as in Munster; in addition, stress was attracted to a short vowel before word-final "ll", "m", or "nn" when that word was also final in its utterance. For example, ('horse') was pronounced in isolation or as the last word of a sentence, but as in the middle of a sentence.

In general, short vowels are all reduced to <a href="schwa">schwa</a> () in unstressed syllables, but there are some exceptions. In Munster, if the third syllable of a word is stressed and the preceding two syllables are short, the first of the two unstressed syllables is "not" reduced to schwa; instead it receives a secondary stress, e.g. ('scythe-man'). Also in Munster, an unstressed short vowel is not reduced to schwa if the following syllable contains a stressed or , e.g. ('art'), ('gather'). In Ulster, long vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened but are not reduced to schwa, e.g. ('girl'), ('gallon').

The <a href="voiceless%20velar%20fricative">voiceless velar fricative</a> , spelled , is associated with some unusual patterns in many dialects of Irish. For one thing, its presence after the vowel triggers behavior atypical of short vowels; for another, and its slender counterpart interchange with the <a href="voiceless%20glottal%20fricative">voiceless glottal fricative</a> in a variety of ways, and can sometimes be deleted altogether.

In Munster, stress is attracted to in the second syllable of a word if it is followed by , "provided" the first syllable (and third syllable, if there is one) contains a short vowel . Examples include ('lame') and ('chips'). However, if the first or third syllable contains a long vowel or diphthong, stress is attracted to that syllable instead, and the before is reduced to as normal, e.g. ('listen'), ('wether').

In Ulster, unstressed before is not reduced to <a href="schwa">schwa</a>, e.g. ('cattle').

In many dialects of Irish, the voiceless dorsal fricatives and alternate with under a variety of circumstances. For example, as the lenition of and , is replaced by before back vowels, e.g. ('I would give'), ('drove'). In Munster, becomes after a vowel, e.g. ('twenty'). In Ring, becomes at the end of a monosyllabic word, e.g. ('fear'). In some Ulster dialects, such as that of <a href="Tory%20Island">Tory Island</a>, can be replaced by , e.g. ('not'), and can even be deleted word-finally, as in ('greedy') In other Ulster dialects, can be deleted before as well, e.g. ('seven').

The following table shows some sample sentences from the Aran dialect.
The first eight chapters of <a href="Peadar%20Ua%20Laoghaire">Peadar Ua Laoghaire</a>'s autobiography "" at <a href="Wikisource">Wikisource</a> include recordings of the text being read by a native speaker of Muskerry (Munster) Irish.

Many of the phonological processes found in Irish are found also in its nearest relatives, <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic%20language">Scottish Gaelic</a> and <a href="Manx%20language">Manx</a>. For example, both languages contrast "broad" and "slender" consonants, but only at the coronal and dorsal <a href="place%20of%20articulation">places of articulation</a>; both Scottish Gaelic and Manx have lost the distinction in labial consonants. The change of etc. to etc. is found in Manx and in most Scottish dialects. Evidence from written manuscripts suggests it had begun in Scottish Gaelic as early as the sixteenth century and was well established in both Scottish Gaelic and Manx by the late 17th to early 18th century. Lengthening or diphthongization of vowels before fortis sonorants is also found in both languages. The stress pattern of Scottish Gaelic is the same as that in Connacht and Ulster Irish, while in Manx, stress is attracted to long vowels and diphthongs in noninitial syllables, but under more restricted conditions than in Munster.

Manx and many dialects of Scottish Gaelic share with Ulster Irish the property of not reducing unstressed to before .

Irish pronunciation has had a significant influence on the features of <a href="Hiberno-English">Hiberno-English</a>. For example, most of the vowels of Hiberno-English (with the exception of ) correspond to vowel <a href="Phone%20%28phonetics%29">phones</a> of Irish. The Irish stops are common realizations of the English phonemes . Hiberno-English also allows where it is permitted in Irish but excluded in other <a href="List%20of%20dialects%20of%20the%20English%20language">dialects of English</a>, such as before an <a href="unstressed%20vowel">unstressed vowel</a> (e.g. "Haughey" ) and at the end of a word (e.g. "McGrath" ). There is epenthesis in words like "film" and "form" .

Mahan-class destroyer

The "Mahan"-class destroyers of the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> were a series of 18 <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s of which the first 16 were laid down in 1934. The last two of the 18, and (this pair laid down in 1935), are sometimes considered a separate <a href="ship%20class">ship class</a>. All 18 were commissioned in 1936 and 1937. was the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a>, named for Rear Admiral <a href="Alfred%20Thayer%20Mahan">Alfred Thayer Mahan</a>, an influential historian and theorist on sea power.

The "Mahan"s featured improvements over previous destroyers, with 12 <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, superimposed gun shelters, and generators for emergency use. The <a href="Standard%20displacement">Standard displacement</a> increased from 1,365 tons to 1,500 tons. The class introduced a new steam <a href="propulsion">propulsion</a> system that combined increases in pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>, which proved simpler and more efficient than the "Mahan"s' predecessors—so much so that it was used on many subsequent wartime US destroyers.

All 18 ships saw action in World War II, entirely in the <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Theater">Pacific Theater</a>, which included the <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a>, and the battles of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Santa%20Cruz%20Islands">Santa Cruz Islands</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Leyte Gulf</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Iwo%20Jima">Iwo Jima</a>. Their participation in major and secondary campaigns included the bombardment of beachheads, amphibious landings, task force screening, convoy and patrol duty, and anti-aircraft and submarine warfare. Six ships were lost in combat and two were expended in the postwar <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a> nuclear tests. The remainder were decommissioned, sold, or scrapped after the war; none remain today. Collectively, the ships received 111 <a href="Service%20star%23Navy%20warships">battle stars</a> for their World War II service.

The "Mahan"-class destroyers emerged as improved versions of the , 
which incorporated the most up-to-date machinery available. 
The Navy's <a href="General%20Board">General Board</a> had wrestled with the proposed design changes, first they considered 12 torpedo tubes with one fewer <a href="5%26quot%3B/38%20caliber%20gun">/38 caliber gun</a>, and then proposed to retain all five guns with the twelve <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, but configure those guns only for surface targets, not air targets. The <a href="Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Chief of Naval Operations</a> objected, and recommended against "subordinating the gun to the <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>", and a compromise was struck that included a new engineering plant and a new battery arrangement for the "Mahan" class and others. In the final design, No. 3 gun was moved to the aft deckhouse (just ahead of No. 4) to make room for the third quadruple torpedo tube; the two middle torpedo tubes were moved to the sides, and released the centerline space for extension of the aft deckhouse. All five 5 in/38s were kept and remained <a href="dual%20purpose%20gun">dual purpose gun</a>s, able to target aircraft as well as ships, but only No. 1 and No. 2 had <a href="gun%20shield">gun shield</a>s. The traditional destroyer machinery was replaced with a new generation of land-based machinery. This change ushered in a new steam propulsion system that combined increases in pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight steam turbine, which proved simpler and more efficient to operate. Double reduction <a href="gear">gear</a>ing also reduced the size of the faster-turning turbines and allowed cruising turbines to be added. These changes led to a ten percent increase in displacement over the "Farragut"s.

The "Mahan"s typically had a tripod foremast with a pole mainmast. To improve the anti-aircraft field of fire, their tripod foremast was constructed without nautical rigging. In silhouette, they were similar to the larger s that immediately preceded them. The "Mahan"s were fitted with the first emergency generators, which replaced the storage batteries of earlier classes. Gun crew shelters were built for the superimposed weapons, one shelter before the bridge and one atop the shelter deck aft.

The "Mahan"s displaced at <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">standard</a> load and at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. The <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of the class was , the <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> was , and the <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> . They were powered by <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a> geared steam turbines, driving two shafts that developed a total of for a maximum speed of . Four <a href="Babcock%20%26amp%3B%20Wilcox">Babcock & Wilcox</a> or four <a href="Foster%20Wheeler">Foster Wheeler</a> <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s generated the <a href="superheated%20steam">superheated steam</a> needed for the turbines. The "Mahan"s carried a maximum of of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, with a range of at . Their peacetime complement was 158 officers and enlisted men. The wartime complement increased to approximately 250 officers and enlisted men.

The "Mahan"s' propulsion plant was considerably improved over that of the "Farragut"s. The steam pressure was raised from to in some ships, and the <a href="superheated%20steam">superheated steam</a> temperature was raised from to in all ships. Double reduction <a href="gear">gear</a>ing replaced single reduction gearing, and allowed smaller, faster-turning turbines to be used. This saved enough space and weight so that cruising turbines could be fitted, which greatly improved fuel economy at moderate speeds. The <a href="boiler">boiler</a> <a href="economizer">economizer</a>s, as in previous ships, further improved fuel economy. The ships' range was extended to at , farther than the "Farragut"s. The design shaft horsepower was increased from to in the same space and weight as in the "Farragut"s. The relatively compact power plant contributed to the "Mahan"s' ability to carry 12 torpedo tubes instead of eight with only 150 tons of extra displacement. The main turbines were manufactured by the <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric Company</a> and were the <a href="steam%20turbine%23Impulse%20turbines">impulse-type</a>, also called the Curtis turbines. Each main turbine was divided into a high-pressure (HP) and a low-pressure (LP) turbine, which fed into a common reduction gear and drove a shaft, in a similar manner to the machinery illustrated at the following reference note. The steam from the boilers was supplied to the HP turbine, which exhausted to the LP turbine, in turn exhausted to the <a href="surface%20condenser">condenser</a>. The cruising turbines were geared to the HP turbines and could be engaged or disengaged as needed. At low speeds, they were operated in a series with the HP turbines to improve the efficiency of the overall turbine arrangement, and also improved the fuel economy. This general arrangement with double reduction gearing became a standard for most subsequent steam-powered surface ships of the US Navy, although not all of them had cruising turbines.

The main battery of the "Mahan" class consisted of five dual purpose /38 caliber guns, equipped with the Mark 33 gun <a href="fire-control%20system">fire-control system</a>. The <a href="anti-aircraft">anti-aircraft</a> battery had four water-cooled <a href=".50%20caliber%20machine%20gun">.50 caliber machine gun</a>s (12.7 mm). The class was fitted with three quadruple torpedo tube mounts for twelve torpedo tubes, guided by the Mark 27 torpedo fire control system. The class was initially equipped with the <a href="Mark%2011%20torpedo">Mark 11 torpedo</a> or <a href="Mark%2012%20torpedo">Mark 12 torpedo</a>, which were replaced by the <a href="Mark%2015%20torpedo">Mark 15 torpedo</a> beginning in 1938. The depth charge roll-off racks were rigged on the stern.

In early 1942, the "Mahan"-class destroyers began a wartime armament refitting process, but most of the class was not fully refitted until 1944. The notable refits to the "Mahan" class included the removal of one 5-inch/38 gun, typically replaced with two twin <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun">Bofors 40 mm gun</a>s (1.6 in) and between four and six <a href="20%20mm%20Oerlikon">20 mm Oerlikon</a> (0.79 in) guns to increase the ships' light <a href="anti-aircraft">anti-aircraft</a> (AA) armament.

In January 1945, removal of two quadruple torpedo tubes was authorized to permit substitution of two 40 mm quad mounts. In June, removal of the third centerline tube was authorized to make way for two 40 mm twin mounts abreast of the aft stack. All ships receiving these AA modifications were to have directors installed with their new 40 mm mounts; these Mark 51s were to be replaced by new blind-firing GFFC Mark 63 installations with <a href="radar">radar</a>.

The "Dunlap" class was a two-ship destroyer class based on the "Mahan" design, listed as a separate class in some sources. The ships were and , the last two "Mahan"s. Unlike the "Mahan"s, the "Dunlap"s had the new Mark 25 <a href="gunhouse">enclosed mounts</a> for the two forward 5-inch/38 caliber guns, with base rings housing projectile hoists that rotated with each of the guns; their ammunition was fed from a handling room below each mount. "Dunlap" and "Fanning" were the first US destroyers to use enclosed forward gun mounts rather than shields; their light pole foremast and lack of a mainmast visibly distinguished them from the "Mahan"s.

The constructioon of the first sixteen vessels was authorised under the NIRA Executive Order on 16 June 1933. The last two were authorised under the Vinson-Trammell Act of 27 March 1934 (as part of a group of 95 destroyers authorised on that date - and covered DD-380 to DD-436 and DD-445 to DD-482). The contracts for the first six "Mahan"s were awarded to three shipbuilders, but none of the builders had what the US Navy judged as an acceptable in-house design structure. On the strength of their reputation, the New York firm of <a href="Gibbs%20%26amp%3B%20Cox">Gibbs & Cox</a> was named as the design agent. The firm had no experience in the design of warships, but had successfully designed passenger-cargo liners with better propulsion systems than any available to the US Navy. The decision was made to design the "Mahan" class and future classes around a new generation of machinery. This included a cheaper, faster and more efficient propulsion system, which combined increases in steam pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight, fast-running turbine and double reduction gears.

USS "Mahan" was commissioned on the east coast in September 1936 and served in the Atlantic area until July 1937. She sailed to the Southern California coast for fleet training before moving on to Pearl Harbor. At sea when the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor</a> on 7 December 1941, "Mahan" participated in the initial post-attack efforts in search of the strike force. The ship joined <a href="Task%20Force%2017">Task Force 17</a> in February 1942, which conducted raids on several atolls in the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall</a> and <a href="Gilbert%20Islands">Gilbert Islands</a>. Late in March, she returned to Pearl Harbor and proceeded to the west coast for overhaul. By August 1942, "Mahan" was back operating out of Pearl Harbor.
In October 1942, "Mahan" was assigned to <a href="Task%20Force%2061">Task Force 61</a> and took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Santa%20Cruz%20Islands">Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands</a>. The engagement cost the Navy 74 aircraft, the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> , and one destroyer. While en route to <a href="Noum%C3%A9a%2C%20New%20Caledonia">Nouméa, New Caledonia</a>, "Mahan" and the <a href="battleship">battleship</a> collided, causing severe damage to both ships. Temporary repairs were made to "Mahan" and she steamed to Pearl Harbor for a new bow. She pulled out of Pearl Harbor in January 1943. In the months to follow, "Mahan" escorted convoys between <a href="New%20Hebrides">New Hebrides</a> and the <a href="Fiji">Fiji Islands</a>, performed patrol assignments off New Caledonia and engaged in operations in Australian waters. Assigned to the amphibious force of Rear Admiral <a href="Daniel%20E.%20Barbey">Daniel E. Barbey</a>, "Mahan" participated in a succession of wide-ranging amphibious campaigns in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> and <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>. In February and March 1944, she saw action with the <a href="7th%20Fleet">7th Fleet</a> in the <a href="Admiralty%20Islands">Admiralty Islands</a>. After that the ship was ordered back to the west coast for an overhaul, leaving the yard in July 1944 for Pearl Harbor.

Returning to New Guinea, "Mahan" began to escort convoys between <a href="Jayapura">Hollandia</a>, in <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and <a href="Leyte">Leyte</a>, in the <a href="Philippine%20Islands">Philippine Islands</a>. By November 1944, she was doing anti-submarine patrols off Leyte. On 7 December 1944 while patrolling the channel between Leyte and <a href="Ponson%20Island">Ponson Island</a>, a group of Japanese <a href="kamikaze">suicide aircraft</a> overwhelmed "Mahan" at <a href="Ormoc%20Bay">Ormoc Bay</a>. She was disabled by the attack, then abandoned and sunk by a US destroyer. "Mahan" received five battle stars for her World War II service.

USS "Cummings" served in the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">Pacific Fleet</a> in the late 1930s, participating in numerous individual and fleet training exercises. In 1940, she served on security patrols off the west coast. "Cummings" went on a goodwill visit to several ports in the South Pacific, including <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, New Zealand, and <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a>. The destroyer was hit by fragments while docked in Pearl Harbor during the Japanese attack, and suffered a few casualties. She escorted convoys between Pearl Harbor and the west coast for the first six months of World War II. In June 1942, she was transferred to convoy escort duties in the South Pacific until August, when she had an overhaul in San Francisco, and then returned to her role as a convoy escort in the South Pacific.

In January 1944, "Cummings" joined the screen for the Fast Carrier Strike Force while it raided Japanese positions in the Central Pacific. In March, "Cummings" sailed for <a href="Trincomalee">Trincomalee</a>, Ceylon, where she rendezvoused with British ships for exercises. In April, the ship joined a British force to screen during air strikes on <a href="Sabang%2C%20Indonesia">Sabang, Indonesia</a>. She returned to Ceylon in May and then moved on to <a href="Exmouth%20Gulf">Exmouth Gulf</a>, Australia. With a British force, "Cummings" sortied for air strikes on <a href="Soerabaja">Soerabaja</a>, Java, before leaving for Pearl Harbor.

By July she was back in San Francisco to escort the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> , the ship that carried President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> to Pearl Harbor. "Cummings" joined the <a href="US%203rd%20Fleet">US 3rd Fleet</a> for the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. The next month, she bombarded Iwo Jima in preparation for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Iwo%20Jima">amphibious assault on the island</a>. The ship operated off Okinawa <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">during its invasion</a>. After the war, "Cummings" returned to the United States and was decommissioned in December 1945 and sold for scrap in July 1947. She received seven battle stars for her World War II service.

USS "Drayton" made her shakedown cruise to Europe late in 1936, and finished her final trials in the United States. She left Norfolk, Virginia, in June 1937 for San Diego, California, to join the Scouting Force. In July, "Drayton" participated in the search for the lost American pilot, <a href="Amelia%20Earhart">Amelia Earhart</a>. For the next two years, she exercised along the west coast, the <a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a>, and the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, "Drayton" was at sea but able to participate in the post-attack efforts in search of the enemy force. During the succeeding three months, she escorted a convoy to Christmas Island (<a href="Kiritimati">Kiritimati</a>), screened a carrier in an airstrike on <a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville Island</a>, and screened a tanker to <a href="Suva">Suva</a> Harbor, Fiji Islands. In late November 1942
"Drayton" became part of <a href="Task%20Force%2067">Task Force 67</a>, which intercepted a Japanese naval force guarding transports en route to resupply <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a>. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Tassafaronga">Battle of Tassafaronga</a> followed.

Throughout June, July and August 1943, "Drayton" escorted Australian troop carriers from <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>, Australia, to <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a>, New Guinea. In early September, the ship supported the <a href="Landing%20at%20Lae">amphibious landing at Lae</a>, New Guinea. Later in September, she participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Scarlet%20Beach">amphibious landing at Finschhafen</a>, New Guinea. After escorting troops to <a href="Arawe">Arawe</a>, New Britain, in December 1943, "Drayton" participated in <a href="Battle%20of%20Arawe">the landings there</a> and at Borgen Bay, near <a href="Cape%20Gloucester">Cape Gloucester</a>, New Britain. The destroyer took part in the invasion of <a href="Los%20Negros%20Island">Los Negros Island</a> in the Admiralty Islands during February 1944. She reported to the 7th Fleet in October and performed patrol and escort duty in Leyte Gulf. In December 1944, while screening a convoy to <a href="San%20Pedro%20Bay%20%28Philippines%29">San Pedro Bay</a> in the Philippines, a Japanese bomber attacked the ship, killing two men and wounding seven. The next day, she fought off enemy fighters; one crashed into a 5"/38 caliber gun mount, killing six men and wounding twelve. By August 1945 she was on her way to New York, arriving in September. "Drayton" was decommissioned in October 1945 and sold for scrap in December 1946. She received 11 <a href="battle%20stars">battle stars</a> for her World War II service.

USS "Lamson" shipped out of Norfolk, Virginia, in June 1937 for San Diego, California, less than a year after her naval service began. She engaged in exercises and tactical training until sailing for Pearl Harbor in October 1939. For the next two years, "Lamson" continued training from her base in <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, she joined the post-attack efforts to search for the Japanese strike force. In February 1942 she became part of the newly formed <a href="ANZAC%20Squadron">ANZAC Squadron</a>, consisting of Australian, New Zealand, and American warships in Suva, Fiji Islands. In March, she operated with the squadron as a cover group southeast of Papua New Guinea. In late November 1942, "Lamson" was assigned to Task Force 67 and took part in the Battle of Tassafaronga.

For the next eight months, "Lamson" screened convoys en route to Guadalcanal. By August 1943, she had moved on to Milne Bay, New Guinea, and participated in the September amphibious landings at Lae and Finschhafen. In December, the ship engaged in the pre-invasion bombardment of Arawe and landings at Cape Gloucester, New Britain. After an overhaul and training at Pearl Harbor, "Lamson" joined the 7th Fleet in October 1944. In early December 1944, she took part in the amphibious landing at Ormoc Bay, Leyte, Philippine Islands. There she was struck by a "<a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a>" that set fire to the ship, killing 21 men and injuring 50. The fires were extinguished by a rescue tug and "Lamson" was saved. After extensive repairs in the <a href="Puget%20Sound%20Naval%20Shipyard">Puget Sound Naval Shipyard</a>, she returned to the Pacific and operated off Iwo Jima, then sailed to the United States in November 1945. In May 1946, she participated in the Able nuclear test of <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a>; she was sunk in the Baker test in July 1946. "Lamson" received five battle stars for her World War II service.

USS "Flusser" steamed her way to San Diego, California, in July 1937, after spending the first months of her naval service in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. She was based in San Diego until 1939, then reassigned to Pearl Harbor. "Flusser" was at sea when the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor, but took part in the post-attack search. For the next six months, she carried out convoy duty between Pearl Harbor and the west coast, and engaged in escort and patrol duty out of southwest Pacific ports. From July 1942 to February 1943, "Flusser" was in overhaul status at Pearl Harbor. She returned to escort and training operations in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> and was later based at Milne Bay, New Guinea. During September, "Flusser" was part of the amphibious landing forces at Lae and Finschhafen, New Guinea. In December 1943, the destroyer participated in the bombardment and landings at Arawe and Cape Gloucester, New Britain. While attached to the 7th Fleet in February, she supported the landing of troops at Los Negros Island in the Admiralty Islands. Between April and June 1944, the ship was in the <a href="Mare%20Island%20Naval%20Shipyard">Mare Island Naval Shipyard</a> for overhaul.

After her overhaul, "Flusser" returned to Pearl Harbor. In August, she escorted a convoy to <a href="Eniwetok">Eniwetok</a> and moved on to <a href="Majuro">Majuro</a> in the Marshall Islands, where she patrolled bypassed Japanese-held atolls. On a patrol off <a href="Wotje%20Atoll">Wotje Atoll</a>, the ship was fired on by a shore battery that left nine of her crew members wounded. In October, she sailed north to San Pedro Bay for duty in the Leyte Gulf and <a href="Surigao%20Strait">Surigao Strait</a>. By early December 1944, "Flusser" had escorted convoys from Hollandia Jayapura to Leyte and taken part in the amphibious landing at Ormoc Bay. In March 1945, "Flusser" provided escort support for the landing near <a href="Cebu">Cebu</a> in the Philippines. During July she participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Balikpapan%20%281945%29">Balikpapan campaign</a> in Borneo, escorting ships and covering the landing. After occupation duty in Okinawa during September and October, she sailed to San Diego, California, arriving in November 1945. During 1946, "Flusser" took part in the atomic weapons tests in the Marshall Islands. From there, she steamed to Pearl Harbor, then to Norfolk, Virginia. The destroyer was decommissioned there in December 1946 and sold in January 1948. "Flusser" received eight battle stars for her World War II service.

USS "Reid" came into naval service in November 1936. From 1937 until 1941, she participated in training and fleet maneuvers in the Atlantic and Pacific. "Reid" was berthed at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked, but escaped without damage while her gunners fired at the enemy attackers. After the attack, "Reid" did patrol duty in the Hawaiian waters, and later escorted convoys to San Francisco, California. Late in May 1942, "Reid" steamed north from Pearl Harbor to bombard the Japanese positions in <a href="Kiska">Kiska</a> and supported landings at <a href="Adak%2C%20Alaska">Adak, Alaska</a>. While conducting an anti-submarine patrol in August, she brought a Japanese submarine to the surface with a heavy <a href="depth%20charge">depth charge</a> barrage, and opened fire on it until it capsized and sank. Five of the submarine's crew survived and were rescued by "Reid". By October, she was patrolling the waters near New Caledonia, Samoa, and the Fiji Islands. In January 1943, the ship bombarded several Japanese locations on Guadalcanal.

During September 1943, "Reid" provided support for the landings at Lae and Finschhafen, New Guinea. In December, "Reid" escorted troop transports for the landings at Arawe, New Britain, and participated in the landings at Cape Gloucester, New Britain. In the following months she supported landings at Los Negros Island in the Admiralty Islands, Hollandia Jayapura, <a href="Wakde%20Island">Wakde Island</a>, <a href="Biak">Biak</a>, and <a href="Noemfoor">Noemfoor</a>, New Guinea. "Reid" supported air strikes against <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a>, and in November 1944 did patrol duty off Leyte in the Philippines.

On 11 December 1944, "Reid" was operating with a convoy bound for Ormoc Bay, Leyte, to resupply land forces. Late that afternoon, a group of Japanese planes descended on the convoy and penetrated the defenses, taking aim at "Reid" and another destroyer. The destroyers put up an anti-aircraft barrage that splashed some of the planes and damaged others, but "Reid" was hit by five suicide planes, causing powerful explosions. Within minutes, she went to the bottom, and over a hundred men perished. "Reid" received seven battle stars for her World War II service.

USS "Case" began active duty in September 1936 and was assigned to the Pacific Fleet. In April 1940, Pearl Harbor became her home base. The following year, she participated in fleet exercises to <a href="Midway%20Island">Midway Island</a>, <a href="Johnston%20Island">Johnston Island</a>, <a href="Palmyra%20Atoll">Palmyra Atoll</a>, Samoa, and Auckland. "Case" was berthed at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese struck, but sustained no damage. After the attack, she escorted convoys between the west coast and Pearl Harbor until late May 1942. "Case" went north to support the pre-invasion bombardment of Kiska and do patrol duty off Adak, Alaska. In October, the ship escorted a convoy to Pearl Harbor and then headed to the states for repair, returning to Pearl Harbor in November. In January 1943, she sailed to <a href="Espiritu%20Santo">Espiritu Santo</a> for training and remained there until September. After overhaul in San Francisco, California, "Case" returned to Pearl Harbor in December 1943. She proceeded to the Marshall Islands, taking part in attacks on Wotje Atoll and <a href="Maloelap%20Atoll">Maloelap Atoll</a> in late January and Eniwetok in early February 1944.

In April 1944, "Case" took part in air raids on Hollandia, Truk (<a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Chuuk Lagoon</a>), <a href="Satawan">Satawan</a>, and <a href="Ponape%20Island">Ponape Island</a>. Her next assignment was with Task Group 58.4, participating in strikes on Japanese airfields in the <a href="Bonin%20Islands">Bonin Islands</a>. During June 1944, "Case" engaged in raids on the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Mariana Islands</a> and Vulcan Islands. Following repair work at Eniwetok, the ship resumed operations with the task group, screening for air strikes in July and for attacks on the Bonin Islands in August and September. She took part in the bombardment of <a href="Marcus%20Island">Marcus Island</a> before joining Task Group 38.1 for strikes on <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a>. While screening US cruisers bound for <a href="Saipan">Saipan</a>, "Case" rammed and sank a Japanese midget submarine. Undamaged, she sailed to Saipan for offshore patrol duty until early December 1944. Afterward, "Case" became involved in a raid on Iwo Jima airfields and helped sink two Japanese ships. Following repairs at Saipan, she patrolled between there and Iwo Jima until the end of the war. She then left Iwo Jima for Norfolk, Virginia, where she was decommissioned in December 1945 and sold in December 1947. "Case" received seven battle stars for her World War II service.

USS "Conyngham" made her maiden voyage to northern Europe in early 1937, shortly after being commissioned. Following an overhaul in Boston, she sailed to San Diego, California. From October 1937 until April 1940, "Conyngham" operated along the west coast, the Hawaiian Islands and the Caribbean, then made her way to Pearl Harbor. In March 1941, "Conyngham" left Pearl Harbor on a goodwill tour to Samoa, Sydney and Brisbane in Australia, and Suva in Fiji, returning in April 1941. Undamaged by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, she put to sea on patrol duty that continued through December. After a brief overhaul at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, "Conyngham" performed escort duty between the west coast and New Hebrides. Her escort assignment was interrupted to screen carriers in the Battle of Midway Island in June 1942.

During October 1942, "Conyngham" participated in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands and supported the attack at the <a href="Matanikau%20River">Matanikau River</a>, Guadalcanal. In June 1943 she joined an amphibious force that later carried out landings at Lae and Finschhafen, New Guinea. In December, she took part in the landings at Arawe and Cape Gloucester, New Britain. The next month, "Conyngham" participated in the <a href="landing%20at%20Saidor">landing at Saidor</a>, New Guinea, and sailed to San Francisco for overhaul. Returning to duty in May 1944, she screened battleships in the Mariana Islands and remained there until August. "Conyngham" then joined a convoy screening ships to the Philippines Islands, arriving at Leyte Gulf in early November 1944. There, a floatplane (a type of seaplane) strafed her, wounding 17 men yet causing slight damage to the ship. By early December, she had covered landings at Ormoc Bay and helped with reinforcements. "Conygnham" left the Philippines late in December for Manus Island, New Guinea, to replenish supplies. Later on, she helped screen a convoy to Leyte for the landings at Lingayen Gulf. The ship participated in bombardments at Lingayen Gulf and remained on patrol there after the landings in January 1945. "Conygham" sailed to <a href="Subic%20Bay">Subic Bay</a> for overhaul in late July 1945, and remained there until the end of the war. Decommissioned in December 1946, "Conyngham" was used in the atomic weapons test at Bikini in 1946, and was scuttled in July 1948. She received 14 battle stars for her World War II service.

USS "Cassin" began naval service in August 1936, but alterations kept her from sea duty until March 1937. The next year, she joined the forces at Pearl Harbor for annual fleet exercises. In April 1940, "Cassin" was assigned to a Hawaiian unit. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, "Cassin" was in dry-dock with the battleship and the destroyer . Both destroyers were at the southern end of the dock when an incendiary bomb struck "Downes," starting unstoppable fires on both destroyers. "Cassin" slipped off her blocks and rolled over onto the burning "Downes". She was salvaged and towed to the Mare Island Navy Yard and decommissioned.

"Cassin" was rebuilt and commissioned again in February 1944. She reported to Pearl Harbor in April and pulled escort duty until August. In October, the ship took part in the shelling of Marcus Island to destroy enemy installations. After participating in the bombardment of Iwo Jima in November 1944 and January 1945, she escorted an ammunition ship to the newly invaded Iwo Jima. There, "Cassin" did radar picket and air-sea rescue duty.

With the war over, she took part in guarding the air evacuation of released prisoners of war from <a href="Japan">Japan</a>. In November 1945, the ship deployed to Norfolk, Virginia, and decommissioned there in December 1945. She was sold for scrap in November 1947. "Cassin" received six battle stars for her World War II service.

USS "Shaw" crossed the Atlantic on her <a href="shakedown%20cruise">shakedown cruise</a> in April 1937, and returned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard in June. There, she began a year of yard work before completing acceptance trials. For the remainder of the year, the ship conducted training exercises in the Atlantic. Sailing to the west coast, she was at the Mare Island Navy Yard from January to April 1939. By April 1940, "Shaw" moved on to Hawaiian waters, then back to the west coast in November for overhaul. She returned to Hawaii in February 1941, and later entered the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard for repairs. "Shaw" was still in <a href="dry%20dock">dry dock</a> when the Japanese attacked, with most of the ship's crew ashore. She was hit by three bombs and severely damaged when her forward magazine exploded. Temporary repairs were made at Pearl Harbor, and in February 1942 the ship sailed to the west coast to complete them.

With repairs completed, "Shaw" returned to Pearl Harbor in August 1942. She was then assigned to Task Force 61, and took part in the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands in mid-October. Reassigned to a unit of the 7th Amphibious Force, "Shaw" escorted reinforcements to Lae and Finschhafen, New Guinea, for the remainder of October and part of November. In late December, she escorted units engaged in the assault on Cape Gloucester, New Britain, and sustained casualties and damage. Thirty-six men were injured; three later died of their wounds. Temporary repairs were made at Milne Bay, New Guinea, and permanent repairs were completed at San Francisco in May 1944. "Shaw" then returned to Pearl Harbor.

With Task Force 52, she participated in the offensive to gain possession of the Japanese-held Mariana Islands. In January 1945, with the San Fabian Attack Force, "Shaw" saw action at <a href="Manila%20Bay">Manila Bay</a> in the Philippine Islands. She returned to the United States in April, stopping first at San Francisco for repairs, then routed to New York via Philadelphia for deactivation. The ship was decommissioned in October 1945 and sold for scrap in July 1946. "Shaw" received 11 battle stars for her World War II service.

USS "Tucker" was commissioned in July 1936. After her shakedown cruise, she joined the destroyer forces attached to the US Battle Fleet based in San Diego, California. In February 1939 the ship took part in a naval exercise in the Caribbean, personally observed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt from the cruiser . After exercises in Hawaiian waters in early 1940, "Tucker" operated between the west coast and Hawaii until the end of the year. By February 1941, she was back in Pearl Harbor. "Tucker" went on a goodwill tour that included Auckland, during March, before returning to Pearl Harbor. There, she participated in exercises at sea before sailing on to San Diego. By November 1941, "Tucker" was once again in Pearl Harbor. When the Japanese attacked, the ship was berthed at East Loch undergoing tender overhaul. She was undamaged, and returned fire on the Japanese forces.

After the hostilities, "Tucker" patrolled off Pearl Harbor, then spent the next five months escorting convoys between the west coast and Hawaii. She later escorted the tender to Tutuila in American Samoa, Suva in the Fiji Islands, and Nouméa in New Caledonia. The ship then escorted "Wright" back to Suva, arriving there in June 1942. From Suva, she escorted the cargo ship "Nira Luckenbach" to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, in August. The ship entered the harbor by the western entrance and struck at least one mine. The crew abandoned ship and was rescued by nearby vessels. Efforts to save her were in vain; she eventually jack-knifed and went to the bottom. "Tucker" had steamed into a minefield placed by US forces, but she was never informed of its existence. Three men were killed and three more were listed as missing. She was removed from the Navy list in December 1944. "Tucker" received one battle star for her World War II service.

USS "Downes" entered service in January 1937. The following November, she sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, to San Diego, California. While based there, "Downes" participated in exercises along the west coast, in the Caribbean and in Hawaiian waters until April 1940. Pearl Harbor then became her homeport. In early 1941, "Downes" joined a cruise to Samoa, the Fiji Islands, and Australia, then visited the west coast later in the year. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, "Downes" was in dry-dock with the battleship "Pennsylvania" and the destroyer "Cassin". Both destroyers were at the southern end of the dock when an incendiary bomb struck "Downes", setting unstoppable fires on both ships. "Cassin" slipped her blocks and rolled over onto the burning "Downes", and "Downes" was later decommissioned.

"Downes" was rebuilt and recommissioned in November 1943. During March 1944, she escorted a convoy to Pearl Harbor and on to Majuro in the Marshall Islands. By July, "Downes" began escort duty from Eniwetok to Saipan in support of the invasion of the Mariana Islands. Then she patrolled off <a href="Tinian">Tinian</a> during its invasion, and gave fire support during mop-up operations there. Afterward, "Downes" took part in the bombardment of Marcus Island to create a diversion and destroy Japanese installations, an action that Admiral Halsey later commended. During the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the ship screened the Fast Carrier Task Force during the air strikes on Vice Admiral <a href="Jisabur%C5%8D%20Ozawa">Jisaburō Ozawa</a>'s Northern Force. "Downes" served in Iwo Jima from June 1944 until the end of the war, when the ship was ordered to return to the United States, arriving at Norfolk in November 1945. She was decommissioned in December 1945 and sold in November 1947. "Downes" received four battle stars for her World War II service.
USS "Cushing" reported to the Pacific Fleet in August 1936, soon after her Navy service began. She joined the unsuccessful search for the missing Earhart during the month of July 1937. She moved on to San Diego for training exercises, continuing to operate along the west coast for the next several years. "Cushing" was under overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard when the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor. Following the attack, she did convoy duty between the west coast and Pearl Harbor, and later operated off Midway Island on anti-submarine patrol. In August 1942, "Cushing" sailed to Pearl Harbor for training exercises and later joined operations around Guadalcanal.

With Task Force 61, "Cushing" took part in the bitterly contested Battle of Santa Cruz in October 1942. Outnumbered, the force stalled the Japanese from their advance toward Guadalcanal. At the Battle of Guadalcanal, "Cushing" was perhaps the first US ship to strike the enemy on that November day in 1942. In the fighting that followed, she sustained several hits amidships and slowly began to lose power, but was able to fire six torpedoes by local control at the . In his book, "Destroyer Operations in World War II" (1953), Theodore Roscoe said, “ Three of the “fish” seemed to hit the bulls-eye; if they did, it was with tack-hammer thumps. They may have exploded prematurely. But "Hiei"s lookouts must have seen them coming, for the big ship swung her bow to the left and lumbered westward, disappearing into the smoke-haze.”
By this time, "Cushing" was dead in the water, an easy target for repeated enemy shelling. The results were disastrous and the order was given to abandon ship. Six officers and 53 men were lost. Of the survivors rescued, 56 had been wounded and ten of them suffered fatal injuries. The abandoned ship remained afloat until her magazines blew up. "Cushing" received three battle stars for her World War II service.

USS "Perkins" was commissioned in September 1936 and San Diego, California, became her homeport. She operated in the eastern Pacific prior to World War II, and was at the Mare Island Navy Yard when the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor. In mid-December, she escorted a convoy to Pearl Harbor, returned to Mare Island for new radar gear, and sailed back to Pearl Harbor the latter part of January 1942. The following month, "Perkins" departed Pearl Harbor and joined Australian, New Zealand, and other US ships in the ANZAC Squadron, charged with protecting the eastern approaches to Australia and New Zealand. She continued operations with ANZAC until April. In May 1942, "Perkins" participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Coral%20Sea">Battle of the Coral Sea</a>. After that, propeller problems took her to New Zealand and to Pearl Harbor, where repairs were completed. While at Pearl Harbor, additional radar gear and 40 mm guns were installed.

By November 1942 "Perkins" was with Task Force 67, led by Rear Admiral <a href="Carleton%20H.%20Wright">Carleton H. Wright</a>. In the nighttime Battle of Tassafaronga, the force intercepted the Japanese to stop them from supplying Guadalcanal. Undamaged in the encounter, "Perkins" headed for <a href="Tulagi">Tulagi</a> where she bombarded the Guadalcanal coast and served on escort assignments until January 1943. She joined Task Force 76, an amphibious group, in March. In September 1943, "Perkins" bombarded Lae, New Guinea, and supported the landings there. She took part in the successful landings at Finschhafen, New Guinea. Late in November, the ship was bound from Milne Bay to Buna, steaming independently, when <a href="MV%20Duntroon">"Duntroon"</a>, an Australian troopship, accidentally collided with her. "Perkins" broke in two and quickly sank; nine of the crew went down with her. "Perkins" received four battle stars for her World War II service.

USS "Smith" began her US naval service in September 1936, and operated along the west coast of the United States for the next five years. From the start of World War II until April 1942, she was based in San Francisco, California, attached to a destroyer squadron. In June, "Smith" was in Pearl Harbor, engaged in training exercises, then escorted a convoy back to San Francisco. After overhaul and sea trials in the bay area, "Smith" returned to Pearl Harbor in August. By October she was part of Task Force 61, participating in the Battle of Santa Cruz. In the course of the battle, a Japanese torpedo plane crashed into her; the explosion ignited the forward part of the ship. The crew eventually extinguished the fires, and "Smith" was able to retain her position in the screen. When the air cleared, 28 were dead and 23 wounded. She was patched up enough in New Caledonia to make her way to Pearl Harbor, where she was under overhaul until February 1943. The next few months, "Smith" performed anti-submarine patrols, did convoy duty, and participated in Navy exercises. In September and October, she was part of the amphibious landings at Lae and Finschhafen, New Guinea. In late December 1943 "Smith" was attached to Task Force 76, and took part in landing the 1st Marine Division at Cape Gloucester, New Britain.

In January 1944, "Smith" participated in the amphibious landing near Saidor, New Guinea, led by Barbey. In February, she bombarded designated targets in preparation for the landing at Los Negros in the Admiralty Islands. By the middle of March, "Smith" sailed to the west coast for overhaul. Completed in June, she returned to Pearl Harbor for training exercises and gunnery practice. Attached to the 7th Fleet in October, "Smith" sailed to Leyte Gulf in the Philippine Islands. There, she was positioned northeast of Ponson Island as a fighter director ship for the landing at Ormoc Bay in December 1944. During January 1945, "Smith" supported the landings in Lingayen Gulf, Philippine Islands. In late June, she bombarded Balikpapan, Borneo, in preparation for the landing by an Australian force. "Smith" departed the Philippines on 15 August 1945 for <a href="Buckner%20Bay">Buckner Bay</a>, remaining there until steaming to <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a> Harbor, <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>, Japan, on 15 September, arriving there just 37 days after the nuclear bombing of Nagasaki on 9 August 1945 by US forces.
There the ship boarded 80 US military ex-prisoners of war, taking them to Okinawa for transfer to the United States. On 21 September "Smith" returned to Nagasaki and picked up 90 Allied prisoners of war, taking them to Bickner Bay. She arrived in <a href="Sasebo%2C%20Nagasaki">Sasebo, Nagasaki</a>, on 28 September and departed two days later for San Diego via Pearl Harbor. Docking at San Diego on 19 November, she remained there until ordered to Pearl Harbor on 28 December, arriving there on 3 January 1946 and assumed an inactive status. The ship was decommissioned on 28 June 1946 and struck from the Navy list on 25 February 1947. "Smith" received six battle stars for her World War II service.

USS "Preston" was in service from October 1936 until November 1942. Following shakedown, she served briefly under the Chief of Naval Operations, then joined the US Fleet. "Preston" did peacetime training exercises into the month of December 1941, and performed patrol and escort duties along the west coast until June 1942. After that, she screened the carrier to Hawaii, followed by four months of patrol and escort work in Hawaiian waters.

In October she became part of Task Force 61 and participated in the Battle of Santa Cruz. In mid-November 1942, "Preston" sailed to the western end of Guadalcanal to intercept another run by the Japanese to bombard <a href="Henderson%20Field%20%28Guadalcanal%29">Henderson Field</a>. In the ensuing skirmish, "Preston" was hit by a salvo from a Japanese cruiser that put both fire rooms out of commission and toppled the aft stack. Her fires made an easy target; as they spread, the order was given to abandon ship. The ship rolled onto her side and sank, taking 116 of her crew with her. "Preston" received two battle stars for her World War II service.

USS "Dunlap" became part of the US Navy in June 1937. A year later, she served as an escort at Philadelphia for the steamer , which carried <a href="Gustaf%20VI%20Adolf%20of%20Sweden">Gustaf Adolf</a>, the Crown Prince of Sweden. By April 1940, Pearl Harbor was "Dunlap"'s homeport. When the Japanese attacked, "Dunlap" was at sea bound for Pearl Harbor; she entered port the following day. In January, she sortied for air strikes on the Marshall Islands, and in February she took part in a raid on Wake Island. Afterward, "Dunlap" patrolled Hawaiian waters, escorted convoys between various ports on the west coast, and returned to Pearl Harbor in October 1942. In December, the destroyer moved on to Noumea, New Caledonia, and operated from there until July 1943.
"Dunlap" saw action at Vella Gulf in the Solomon Islands in a nighttime torpedo clash. In "United States Destroyer Operations in World War II" (1953), <a href="Theodore%20Roscoe">Theodore Roscoe</a> wrote: "In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vella%20Gulf">Battle of Vella Gulf</a>, as this engagement was called, the enemy had not laid a hand on the American ships."

After overhaul in San Diego, "Dunlap" performed patrol duty out of Adak, Alaska, in November and December 1943 and sailed to Pearl Harbor. From January until March 1944, she screened carriers in strikes on the Marshall Islands with the 5th Fleet. After that, "Dunlap" took part in strikes on the Soerabaja area of <a href="Java">Java</a> in May and returned to Pearl Harbor in June. In July, she sailed to San Francisco to join the screen for the heavy cruiser "Baltimore", which carried Roosevelt for conferences and inspections with top Pacific commanders of Pearl Harbor and Alaskan bases. In early September 1944, "Dunlap" participated in the shelling of Wake Island. In October 1944, she lent a hand in the bombardment of Marcus Island. By January 1945, the ship was involved in the shelling of Iwo Jima, Haha-jima, and <a href="Chichi-jima">Chichi-jima</a>. On 3 September 1945, Commodore John H. Magruder accepted the surrender of the Bonin Islands by Lt. General <a href="Yoshio%20Tachibana">Yoshio Tachibana</a> on board the destroyer. "Dunlap" sailed to Norfolk, Virginia, in November 1945, where she was decommissioned in December 1945 and sold in December 1947. She received six battle stars for her World War II service.

USS "Fanning" was occupied with sea trials and minor repairs for the first six months of her naval service. In April 1938, she escorted the light cruiser from Annapolis, Maryland, to the Caribbean with Roosevelt aboard.
"Fanning" sailed to New York for overhaul the following month; in September she moved on to her new base in San Diego, California. Over the next three years, her duties took her to the east coast and eventually to Hawaii. The ship was at sea when the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor; she returned the following day. Underway for <a href="Tutuila">Tutuila</a> in January 1942, "Fanning" encountered a blinding rainstorm and collided with . Both destroyers suffered bow damage and were forced to return to Pearl Harbor. In April 1942 "Fanning" became part of Task Force 16, which supported the <a href="Doolittle%20Raid">Doolittle Raid</a> on the air strike against Tokyo. After the mission, she returned to Pearl Harbor.

For the first nine months of 1943, "Fanning" deployed against the Japanese on Guadalcanal, supported an occupation force on the <a href="Russell%20Islands">Russell Islands</a>, participated in patrol duty, and assisted in the protection of troops occupying <a href="Munda%2C%20Solomon%20Islands">Munda, Solomon Islands</a>. In September, she had an overhaul on the west coast, then finished the year operating off the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>. By January 1944, "Fanning" was operating with Task Group 58.4 in the Marshall Islands. In March she reported to the Eastern Fleet (British units, reinforced with Australian, Dutch and French warships), participating in strikes against Sabang, Indonesia, the next month. Detached from the Eastern Fleet in May, "Fanning" sailed to the west coast. In July she left San Diego, escorting the heavy cruiser "Baltimore" to Alaska with Roosevelt on board. Her next assignment was with Task Group 30.2, shelling Marcus Island in October 1944 to create a diversion and destroy enemy installations. During January 1945, "Fanning" took part in the shelling of Iwo Jima, Haha-jima, and Chichi-Jima. For the remainder of the war, she was occupied with patrol and escort activities. In September 1945, she sailed for the United States, and was decommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia, in December 1945; she was sold for scrap in 1948. "Fanning" received four battle stars for her World War II service.

1954 Guatemalan coup d'état

The 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état was a covert operation carried out by the U.S. <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) that <a href="deposition%20%28politics%29">deposed</a> the <a href="Guatemalan%20presidential%20election%2C%201950">democratically elected</a> Guatemalan President <a href="Jacobo%20%C3%81rbenz">Jacobo Árbenz</a> and ended the <a href="Guatemalan%20Revolution">Guatemalan Revolution</a> of 1944–1954. Code-named Operation PBSUCCESS, it installed the military dictatorship of <a href="Carlos%20Castillo%20Armas">Carlos Castillo Armas</a>, the first in a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian rulers in <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>.

The Guatemalan Revolution began in 1944, when a popular uprising toppled the authoritarian <a href="Jorge%20Ubico">Jorge Ubico</a> and brought <a href="Juan%20Jos%C3%A9%20Ar%C3%A9valo">Juan José Arévalo</a> to power via Guatemala's <a href="Guatemalan%20presidential%20election%2C%201944">first democratic election</a>. The new president introduced a <a href="minimum%20wage">minimum wage</a> and near-<a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a>, aiming to turn Guatemala into a <a href="liberal%20democracy">liberal democracy</a>. Arévalo was succeeded by Árbenz in 1951, who instituted popular <a href="Decree%20900">land reforms</a> which granted property to landless peasants. The Guatemalan Revolution was disliked by the United States Federal government, <a href="Latin%20America%E2%80%93United%20States%20relations">which was predisposed</a> by the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> to see it as <a href="communism">communist</a>. This perception grew after Árbenz took power and legalized the <a href="Guatemalan%20Party%20of%20Labour">Communist Party</a>. The <a href="United%20Fruit%20Company">United Fruit Company</a> (UFC), whose highly profitable business had been affected by the end to exploitative labor practices in Guatemala, engaged in an influential lobbying campaign to persuade the U.S. to overthrow the Guatemalan government. U.S. President <a href="Harry%20Truman">Harry Truman</a> authorized <a href="Operation%20PBFORTUNE">Operation PBFORTUNE</a> to topple Árbenz in 1952; although the operation was quickly aborted, it was a precursor to PBSUCCESS.

<a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> was elected U.S. President in 1952, promising to take a harder line <a href="Anti-communism">against communism</a>; the links that his staff members <a href="John%20Foster%20Dulles">John Foster Dulles</a> and <a href="Allen%20Dulles">Allen Dulles</a> had to the UFC also predisposed them to act against the Guatemalan government. Additionally, the U.S. Federal government drew exaggerated conclusions about the extent of communist influence from the presence of a small number of communists among Árbenz's advisers. Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSUCCESS in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by <a href="Carlos%20Castillo%20Armas">Carlos Castillo Armas</a>. The coup was preceded by U.S. efforts to criticize and isolate Guatemala internationally. Castillo Armas' force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of <a href="psychological%20warfare">psychological warfare</a>. This included a radio station which broadcast anti-government propaganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion, claiming to be genuine news, as well as bombings of <a href="Guatemala%20City">Guatemala City</a> and a naval blockade of Guatemala. The invasion force fared poorly militarily, and most of its offensives were defeated. However, psychological warfare and the possibility of a U.S. invasion intimidated the <a href="Military%20of%20Guatemala">Guatemalan army</a>, which eventually refused to fight. Árbenz briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion, before resigning on 27 June. Castillo Armas became president ten days later, following negotiations in <a href="San%20Salvador">San Salvador</a>.

Described as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala, the coup was widely criticized internationally, and contributed to long-lasting <a href="Anti-Americanism%23Latin%20America">anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America</a>. Attempting to justify the coup, the CIA launched <a href="Operation%20PBHISTORY">Operation PBHISTORY</a>, which sought evidence of <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> influence in Guatemala among documents from the Árbenz era: the effort was a failure. Castillo Armas quickly assumed dictatorial powers, banning opposition parties, imprisoning and torturing political opponents, and reversing the social reforms of the revolution. Nearly four decades of <a href="Guatemalan%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> followed, as leftist guerrillas fought a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian regimes whose brutalities included a <a href="Guatemalan%20genocide">genocide of the Maya peoples</a>.

U.S. President <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a>'s foreign policy doctrine of 1823 warned the <a href="International%20relations%20of%20the%20Great%20Powers%20%281814%E2%80%931919%29">European powers</a> against further <a href="European%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">colonization in Latin America</a>. The stated aim of the Monroe Doctrine was to maintain order and stability, and to ensure that U.S. access to resources and markets was not limited. Historian Mark Gilderhus states that the doctrine also contained racially condescending language, which likened <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>n countries to squabbling children. While the U.S. did not initially have the power to enforce the doctrine, over the course of the 19th century many European powers withdrew from Latin America, allowing the U.S. to expand its <a href="sphere%20of%20influence">sphere of influence</a> throughout the region. In 1895, President <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> laid out a more militant version of the doctrine, stating that the U.S. was "practically sovereign" on the continent.

Following the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> in 1898, this aggressive interpretation was used to create a U.S. economic empire across the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, such as with the <a href="Cuban%E2%80%93American%20Treaty%20of%20Relations%20%281903%29">1903 treaty with Cuba</a> that was heavily tilted in the U.S.' favor. U.S. President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> believed that the U.S. should be the main beneficiary of production in <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>. The U.S. enforced this hegemony with armed interventions in <a href="United%20States%20occupation%20of%20Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> (1912–33), and <a href="United%20States%20occupation%20of%20Haiti">Haiti</a> (1915–34). The U.S. did not need to use its military might in Guatemala, where a series of dictators were willing to accommodate the economic interests of the U.S. in return for its support for their regimes. Guatemala was among the Central American countries of the period known as a <a href="banana%20republic">banana republic</a>. From 1890 to 1920, control of Guatemala's resources and its economy shifted away from <a href="British%20Empire%23Britain%27s%20imperial%20century%20%281815%E2%80%931914%29">Britain</a> and <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a> to the U.S., which became Guatemala's dominant trade partner. The Monroe Doctrine continued to be seen as relevant to Guatemala, and was used to justify the coup in 1954.

Following a surge in <a href="History%20of%20coffee">global coffee demand</a> in the late 19th century, the Guatemalan government made several concessions to plantation owners. It passed legislation that dispossessed the communal landholdings of the <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas%23Guatemala">indigenous population</a> and allowed <a href="Coffee%20production%20in%20Guatemala">coffee growers</a> to purchase it. <a href="Manuel%20Estrada%20Cabrera">Manuel Estrada Cabrera</a>, President of Guatemala from 1898 to 1920, was one of several rulers who made large concessions to foreign companies, including the <a href="United%20Fruit%20Company">United Fruit Company</a> (UFC). Formed in 1899 by the merger of two large U.S. corporations, the new entity owned large tracts of land across Central America, and in Guatemala controlled the <a href="Rail%20transport%20in%20Guatemala">railroads</a>, the docks, and the communication systems. By 1900 it had become the largest exporter of bananas in the world, and had a monopoly over the Guatemalan <a href="Banana%20production%20in%20the%20Caribbean">banana trade</a>. Journalist and writer <a href="William%20Blum">William Blum</a> describes UFC's role in Guatemala as a "<a href="state%20within%20a%20state">state within a state</a>". The U.S. government was also closely involved with the Guatemalan state under Cabrera, frequently dictating financial policies and ensuring that American companies were granted several exclusive rights. When Cabrera was overthrown in 1920, the U.S. sent an armed force to make certain that the new president remained friendly to it.

Fearing a popular revolt following the unrest created by the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, wealthy Guatemalan landowners lent their support to <a href="Jorge%20Ubico">Jorge Ubico</a>, who won an uncontested <a href="Guatemalan%20general%20election%2C%201931">election in 1931</a>. Ubico's regime became one of the most repressive in the region. He abolished <a href="debt%20peonage">debt peonage</a>, replacing it with a <a href="vagrancy%20%28people%29">vagrancy</a> law which stipulated that all landless men of working age needed to perform a minimum of 100 days of <a href="forced%20labor">forced labor</a> annually. He authorized landowners to take any actions they wished against their workers, including <a href="Capital%20punishment%20in%20Guatemala">executions</a>. Ubico was an admirer of European <a href="fascism">fascist</a> leaders such as <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> and <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, but had to <a href="Guatemala%E2%80%93United%20States%20relations">ally with the U.S.</a> for geopolitical reasons, and received substantial support from this country throughout his reign. A staunch <a href="anti-communism">anti-communist</a>, Ubico reacted to several peasant rebellions with incarcerations and massacres.

By 1930 the UFC had built an operating capital of 215 million U.S. dollars, and had been the largest landowner and employer in Guatemala for several years. Ubico granted it a new contract, which was immensely favorable to the company. This included of public land, an exemption from all taxes, and a guarantee that no other company would receive any competing contract. Ubico requested the UFC to cap the daily salary of its workers at 50 U.S. cents, so that workers in other companies would be less able to demand higher wages.

The repressive policies of the Ubico government resulted in a popular uprising led by university students and middle-class citizens in 1944. Ubico fled, handing over power to a three-person <a href="junta%20%28governing%20body%29">junta</a> which continued Ubico's policies until it too was toppled, by the <a href="Guatemalan%20Revolution%23October%20revolution">October Revolution</a> that aimed to transform Guatemala into a <a href="liberal%20democracy">liberal democracy</a>. The largely free election that followed installed a philosophically conservative university professor, <a href="Juan%20Jos%C3%A9%20Ar%C3%A9valo">Juan José Arévalo</a>, as the President of Guatemala. Arévalo's administration drafted a more liberal labor code, built health centers, and increased funding to education. Arévalo enacted a minimum wage, and created state-run farms to employ landless laborers. He also cracked down on the communist <a href="Guatemalan%20Party%20of%20Labour">Guatemalan Party of Labour</a> ("Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo", PGT) and in 1945 criminalized all <a href="labor%20union">labor union</a>s in workplaces with fewer than 500 workers. By 1947, the remaining unions had grown strong enough to pressure him into drafting a new labor code, which made workplace discrimination illegal and created health and safety standards. However, Arévalo refused to advocate <a href="land%20reform">land reform</a> of any kind, and stopped short of drastically changing labor relations in the countryside.

Despite Arévalo's anti-communism, the U.S. was suspicious of him, and worried that he was under Soviet influence. The communist movement did grow stronger during Arévalo's presidency, partly because he released its imprisoned leaders, and also through the strength of its teachers' union. Another cause for U.S. worry was Arévalo's support of the <a href="Caribbean%20Legion">Caribbean Legion</a>. The Legion was a group of progressive exiles and revolutionaries, whose members included <a href="Fidel%20Castro">Fidel Castro</a>, that aimed to overthrow U.S.-backed dictatorships across Central America. The government also faced opposition from within the country; Arévalo survived at least 25 coup attempts during his presidency. A notable example was an attempt in 1949 led by <a href="Francisco%20Arana">Francisco Arana</a>, which was foiled in an armed shootout between Arana's supporters and a force led by Arévalo's defense minister <a href="Jacobo%20%C3%81rbenz">Jacobo Árbenz</a>. Arana was among those killed, but details of the coup attempt were never made public. Other sources of opposition to Arévalo's government were the right-wing politicians and conservatives within the military who had grown powerful during Ubico's dictatorship, as well as the clergy of the <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20Guatemala">Catholic Church</a>.

The largely free <a href="Guatemalan%20presidential%20election%2C%201950">elections of 1950</a> were won by the popular Árbenz, and represented the first transfer of power between democratically elected leaders in Guatemala. Árbenz had personal ties to some members of the communist PGT, which was legalized during his government, and a couple of members played a role in drafting the new president's policies. Nonetheless, Árbenz did not try to turn Guatemala into a <a href="communist%20state">communist state</a>, instead choosing a moderate <a href="capitalism">capitalist</a> approach. The PGT too committed itself to working within the existing legal framework to achieve its immediate objectives of emancipating peasants from <a href="feudalism">feudalism</a> and improving workers' rights. The most prominent component of Árbenz's policy was his agrarian reform bill. Árbenz drafted the bill himself, having sought advice from economists across Latin America. The focus of the law was on transferring uncultivated land from large landowners to poor laborers, who would then be able to begin viable farms of their own.

The official title of the agrarian reform bill was <a href="Decree%20900">Decree 900</a>. It expropriated all uncultivated land from landholdings that were larger than . If the estates were between and , uncultivated land was to be expropriated only if less than two-thirds of it was in use. The owners were compensated with government bonds, the value of which was equal to that of the land expropriated. The value of the land itself was what the owners had declared it to be in their tax returns in 1952. Of the nearly 350,000 private landholdings, only 1,710 were affected by expropriation. The law was implemented with great speed, which resulted in some arbitrary land seizures. There was also some violence, directed at landowners, as well as at peasants that had minor landholdings.

By June 1954, of land had been expropriated and distributed. Approximately 500,000 individuals, or one-sixth of the population, had received land by this point. Contrary to the predictions made by detractors, the law resulted in a slight increase in Guatemalan agricultural productivity, and in an increase in cultivated area. Purchases of farm machinery also increased. Overall, the law resulted in a significant improvement in living standards for many thousands of peasant families, the majority of whom were indigenous people. Historian <a href="Greg%20Grandin">Greg Grandin</a> sees the law as representing a fundamental power shift in favor of the hitherto marginalized.

By 1950, the United Fruit Company's annual profits were 65 million U.S. dollars, twice as large as the revenue of the government of Guatemala. The company also virtually owned <a href="Puerto%20Barrios">Puerto Barrios</a>, Guatemala's only port to the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, allowing it to make profits from the flow of goods through the port. Due to its long association with Ubico's government, Guatemalan revolutionaries saw the UFC as an impediment to progress after 1944. This image was reinforced by the company's discriminatory policies against its <a href="people%20of%20color">workers of color</a>. Due to its size, the reforms of Arévalo's government affected the UFC more than other companies. Among other things, the new labor code allowed UFC workers to strike when their demands for higher wages and job security were not met. The company saw itself as being specifically targeted by the reforms, and refused to negotiate with the numerous sets of strikers, despite frequently being in violation of the new laws. The company's troubles were compounded with the passage of Decree 900 in 1952. Of the that the company owned, only 15 percent was being cultivated; the rest was idle, and thus came under the scope of the agrarian reform law.

The UFC responded by intensively <a href="lobbying">lobbying</a> the U.S. government; several <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congressmen</a> criticized the Guatemalan government for not protecting the interests of the company. The Guatemalan government replied that the company was the main obstacle to progress in the country. American historians observed that "[to] the Guatemalans it appeared that their country was being mercilessly exploited by foreign interests which took huge profits without making any contributions to the nation's welfare". In 1953, of uncultivated land was expropriated by the government, which offered the company compensation at the rate of 2.99 U.S. dollars to the acre (7.39 U.S. dollars per hectare), twice what the company had paid when it bought the property. More expropriation occurred soon after, bringing the total to over ; the government offered compensation to the company at the rate at which the UFC had valued its own property for tax purposes. Since this was a major undervaluation, the company was unhappy with its compensation, resulting in further lobbying in Washington, particularly through <a href="U.S.%20Secretary%20of%20State">U.S. Secretary of State</a> <a href="John%20Foster%20Dulles">John Foster Dulles</a>, who had close ties to the company.

The UFC also began a public relations campaign to discredit the Guatemalan government; it hired <a href="Edward%20Bernays">Edward Bernays</a>, who mounted a concerted misinformation campaign for several years which portrayed the company as the victim of a communist Guatemalan government. The company stepped up its efforts after <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a> was elected U.S. President in 1952. These included commissioning a research study from a firm known to be hostile to social reform, which produced a 235-page report that was highly critical of the Guatemalan government. Historians have stated that the report was full of "exaggerations, scurrilous descriptions and bizarre historical theories" but it nonetheless had a significant impact on the members of Congress who read it. Overall, the company spent over half a million dollars to convince lawmakers and the American public that the Guatemalan government needed to be overthrown.

As the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> developed and the Guatemalan government clashed with U.S. corporations on an increasing number of issues, the U.S. government grew increasingly suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution. In addition, the Cold War predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion also worried the Truman administration, which saw it as a vehicle for communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration had relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the perceived communist influence. The U.S. had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.

The U.S.'s worries over communist influence increased after the election of Árbenz in 1951 and his enactment of Decree 900 in 1952. In April 1952 <a href="Anastasio%20Somoza%20Garc%C3%ADa">Anastasio Somoza García</a>, the dictator of <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>, made his first state visit to the U.S. He made several public speeches praising the U.S., and was awarded a medal by the New York City government. During a meeting with Truman and his senior staff, Somoza said that if the U.S. gave him the arms, he would "clean up Guatemala". The proposal did not receive much immediate support, but Truman instructed the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) to follow up on it. The CIA contacted <a href="Carlos%20Castillo%20Armas">Carlos Castillo Armas</a>, a Guatemalan army officer who had been exiled from the country in 1949 following a <a href="Guatemalan%20Revolution%231949%20coup%20attempt">failed coup attempt</a> against President Arévalo. Believing that Castillo Armas would lead a coup with or without their assistance, the CIA decided to supply him with weapons and 225,000 U.S. dollars.

The coup was planned in detail over the next few weeks by the CIA, the UFC, and Somoza. The CIA also contacted <a href="Marcos%20P%C3%A9rez%20Jim%C3%A9nez">Marcos Pérez Jiménez</a> of Venezuela and <a href="Rafael%20Trujillo">Rafael Trujillo</a> of the Dominican Republic; the two U.S.-backed dictators were supportive of the plan, and agreed to contribute some funding. Although PBFORTUNE was officially approved on 9 September 1952, various planning steps had been taken earlier in the year. In January 1952, officers in the CIA's <a href="National%20Clandestine%20Service">Directorate of Plans</a> compiled a list of "top flight Communists whom the new government would desire to eliminate immediately in the event of a successful anti-Communist coup". The CIA plan called for the assassination of over 58 Guatemalans, as well as the arrest of many others.

The CIA put the plan into motion in late 1952. A freighter that had been borrowed from the UFC was specially refitted in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> and loaded with weapons under the guise of agricultural machinery, and set sail for Nicaragua. However, the plan was terminated soon after: accounts of its termination vary. Some sources state that the State Department discovered the plan when a senior official was asked to sign a certain document, while others suggest that Somoza was indiscreet. The eventual outcome was that Secretary of State <a href="Dean%20Acheson">Dean Acheson</a> called off the operation. The CIA continued to support Castillo Armas; it paid him a monthly retainer of 3000 U.S. dollars, and gave him the resources to maintain his rebel force.

During his successful campaign for the U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more proactive anti-communist policy, promising to <a href="Rollback">roll back</a> communism, rather than <a href="Containment">contain it</a>. Working in an atmosphere of increasing <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a> in government circles, Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use the CIA to depose governments the U.S. disliked. Although PBFORTUNE had been quickly aborted, tension between the U.S. and Guatemala continued to rise, especially with the legalization of the communist PGT, and its inclusion in the government coalition for the elections of January 1953. Articles published in the U.S. press often reflected this predisposition to see communist influence; for example, a "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" article about the visit to Guatemala by Chilean poet <a href="Pablo%20Neruda">Pablo Neruda</a> highlighted his communist beliefs, but neglected to mention his reputation as the greatest living poet in Latin America.

Several figures in Eisenhower's administration, including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother CIA Director <a href="Allen%20Dulles">Allen Dulles</a>, had close ties to the United Fruit Company. The Dulles brothers had worked for the law firm of <a href="Sullivan%20%26amp%3B%20Cromwell">Sullivan & Cromwell</a>, and in that capacity had arranged several deals for the UFC. Undersecretary of State <a href="Walter%20Bedell%20Smith">Walter Bedell Smith</a> would later become a director of the company, while Eisenhower's personal assistant <a href="Ann%20C.%20Whitman">Ann C. Whitman</a> was the wife of UFC public relations director Edward Whitman. These personal connections meant that the Eisenhower administration tended to conflate the interests of the UFC with that of U.S. national security interests, and made it more willing to overthrow the Guatemalan government. The success of the <a href="1953%20Iranian%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">1953 CIA operation</a> to overthrow the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran also strengthened Eisenhower's belief in using the agency to effect political change overseas.

Historians and authors writing about the 1954 coup have debated the relative importance of the role of the United Fruit Company and the worries about communist influence (whether or not these were grounded in reality) in the U.S.'s decision to instigate the coup in 1954. Several historians have maintained that the lobbying of the UFC, and the expropriation of its lands, were the chief motivation for the U.S., strengthened by the financial ties of individuals within the Eisenhower administration to the UFC. Others have argued that the overthrow was motivated primarily by U.S. strategic interest; the knowledge of the presence of a small number of communists close to Árbenz led the U.S. to reach incorrect conclusions about the extent of communist influence. Yet others have argued that the overthrow was part of a larger tendency within the U.S. to oppose nationalist movements in the <a href="Third%20World">Third World</a>. Both the role of the UFC and that of the perception of communist influence continue to be cited as motivations for the U.S.'s actions today.

The CIA operation to overthrow Jacobo Árbenz, code-named Operation PBSUCCESS, was authorized by Eisenhower in August 1953. The operation was granted a budget of 2.7 million U.S. dollars for "psychological warfare and political action". The total budget has been estimated at between 5 and 7 million dollars, and the planning employed over 100 CIA agents. In addition, the operation recruited scores of individuals from among Guatemalan exiles and the populations of the surrounding countries. The plans included drawing up lists of people within Árbenz's government to be assassinated if the coup were to be carried out. Manuals of assassination techniques were compiled, and lists were also made of people whom the junta would dispose of.

The State Department created a team of diplomats who would support PBSUCCESS. It was led by <a href="John%20Peurifoy">John Peurifoy</a>, who took over as <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20Guatemala">Ambassador to Guatemala</a> in October 1953. Another member of the team was <a href="William%20D.%20Pawley">William D. Pawley</a>, a wealthy businessman and diplomat with extensive knowledge of the aviation industry. Peurifoy was a militant anti-communist, and had proven his willingness to work with the CIA during his time as <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20Greece">United States Ambassador to Greece</a>. Under Peurifoy's tenure, relations with the Guatemalan government soured further, although those with the Guatemalan military improved. In a report to John Dulles, Peurifoy stated that he was "definitely convinced that if [Árbenz] is not a communist, then he will certainly do until one comes along". Within the CIA, the operation was headed by <a href="Deputy%20Director%20of%20Plans">Deputy Director of Plans</a> <a href="Frank%20Wisner">Frank Wisner</a>. The field commander selected by Wisner was former U.S. Army Colonel Albert Haney, then chief of the CIA station in South Korea. Haney reported directly to Wisner, thereby separating PBSUCCESS from the CIA's Latin American division, a decision which created some tension within the agency. Haney decided to establish headquarters in a concealed office complex in <a href="Opa-locka%2C%20Florida">Opa-locka, Florida</a>. Codenamed "Lincoln", it became the nerve center of operation PBSUCCESS.

The CIA operation was complicated by a premature coup on 29 March 1953, with a futile raid against the army garrison at <a href="Salam%C3%A1">Salamá</a>, in the central Guatemalan department of <a href="Baja%20Verapaz%20Department">Baja Verapaz</a>. The rebellion was swiftly crushed, and a number of participants were arrested. Several CIA agents and allies were imprisoned, weakening the coup effort. Thus the CIA came to rely more heavily on the Guatemalan exile groups and their anti-democratic allies in Guatemala. The CIA considered several candidates to lead the coup. <a href="Miguel%20Yd%C3%ADgoras%20Fuentes">Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes</a>, the conservative candidate who had lost the 1950 election to Árbenz, held favor with the Guatemalan opposition but was rejected for his role in the Ubico regime, as well as his European appearance, which was unlikely to appeal to the majority mixed-race "<a href="mestizo">mestizo</a>" population. Another popular candidate was the coffee planter Juan Córdova Cerna, who had briefly served in Arévalo's cabinet before becoming the legal adviser to the UFC. The death of his son in an anti-government uprising in 1950 turned him against the government, and he had planned the unsuccessful Salamá coup in 1953 before fleeing to join Castillo Armas in exile. Although his status as a civilian gave him an advantage over Castillo Armas, he was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1954, taking him out of the reckoning. Thus it was Castillo Armas, in exile since the failed 1949 coup and on the CIA's payroll since the aborted PBFORTUNE in 1951, who was to lead the coming coup.

Castillo Armas was given enough money to recruit a small force of mercenaries from among Guatemalan exiles and the populations of nearby countries. This band was called the Army of Liberation. The CIA established training camps in Nicaragua and <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a> and supplied them with weapons as well as several <a href="bomber">bomber</a>s. The U.S. signed military agreements with both those countries prior to the invasion of Guatemala, allowing it to move heavier arms freely. These preparations were only superficially covert: the CIA intended Árbenz to find out about them, as a part of its plan to convince the Guatemalan people that the overthrow of Árbenz was a "<a href="fait%20accompli">fait accompli</a>". Additionally, the CIA made covert contact with a number of church leaders throughout the Guatemalan countryside, and persuaded them to incorporate anti-government messages into their sermons.

While preparations for Operation PBSUCCESS were underway, Washington issued a series of statements denouncing the Guatemalan government, alleging that it had been infiltrated by communists. The State Department also asked the <a href="Organization%20of%20American%20States">Organization of American States</a> to modify the agenda of the <a href="Pan-American%20Conference">Inter-American Conference</a>, which was scheduled to be held in <a href="Caracas">Caracas</a> in March 1954, requesting the addition of an item titled "Intervention of International Communism in the American Republics", which was widely seen as a move targeting Guatemala. On 29 and 30 January 1954, the Guatemalan government published documents containing information leaked to it by a member of Castillo Armas' team who had turned against him. Lacking in original documents, the government had engaged in poor forgery to enhance the information it possessed, undermining the credibility of its charges. A spate of arrests followed of allies of Castillo Armas within Guatemala, and the government issued statements implicating a "Government of the North" in a plot to overthrow Árbenz. Washington denied these allegations, and the U.S. media uniformly took the side of their government; even publications which had until then provided relatively balanced coverage of Guatemala, such as "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>", suggested that Árbenz had succumbed to communist propaganda. Several Congressmen also pointed to the allegations from the Guatemalan government as proof that it had become communist.

At the conference in Caracas, the various Latin American governments sought economic aid from the U.S., as well as its continuing non-intervention in their internal affairs. The U.S. government's aim was to pass a resolution condemning the supposed spread of communism in the Western Hemisphere. The Guatemalan foreign minister <a href="Guillermo%20Toriello">Guillermo Toriello</a> argued strongly against the resolution, stating that it represented the "internationalization of McCarthyism". Despite support among the delegates for Toriello's views, the anti-communist resolution passed with only Guatemala voting against, because of the votes of dictatorships dependent on the U.S. and the threat of economic pressure applied by John Dulles. Although support among the delegates for Dulles' strident anti-communism was less strong than he and Eisenhower had hoped for, the conference marked a victory for the U.S., which was able to make concrete Latin American views on communism.

The U.S. had stopped selling arms to Guatemala in 1951 while signing bilateral defense agreements and increasing arms shipments to neighboring Honduras and Nicaragua. The U.S. promised the Guatemalan military that it too could obtain arms—if Árbenz were deposed. In 1953, the State Department aggravated the U.S. arms embargo by thwarting the Árbenz government's arms purchases from Canada, Germany, and <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a>. By 1954 Árbenz had become desperate for weapons, and decided to acquire them secretly from <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, which would have been the first time that a <a href="Soviet%20bloc">Soviet bloc</a> country shipped weapons to the Americas, an action seen as establishing a communist beachhead in the Americas. The weapons were delivered to Guatemala at the Atlantic port of Puerto Barrios by the Swedish freight ship , which sailed from <a href="Szczecin">Szczecin</a> in <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Poland">Poland</a>. The U.S. failed to intercept the shipment despite imposing an illegal naval quarantine on Guatemala. However "Guatemalan army officers" quoted in "The New York Times" said that "some of the arms ... were duds, worn out, or entirely wrong for use there". The CIA portrayed the shipment of these weapons as Soviet interference in the United States' backyard; it was the final spur for the CIA to launch its coup.

U.S. rhetoric abroad also had an effect on the Guatemalan military. The military had always been anti-communist, and Ambassador Peurifoy had applied a lot of pressure on senior officers ever since his arrival in Guatemala in October 1953. Árbenz had intended the secret shipment of weapons from the "Alfhem" to be used to bolster peasant militias, in the event of army disloyalty. But the U.S. informed army chiefs of the shipment, forcing Árbenz to hand them over to the military, and deepening the rift between him and his top generals.

Castillo Armas' force of 480 men had been split into four teams, ranging in size from 60 to 198. On 15 June 1954 these four forces left their bases in Honduras and <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a>, and assembled in various towns just outside the Guatemalan border. The largest force was supposed to attack the Atlantic harbor town of Puerto Barrios, while the others attacked the smaller towns of <a href="Esquipulas">Esquipulas</a>, <a href="Jutiapa">Jutiapa</a>, and <a href="Zacapa">Zacapa</a>, the Guatemalan army's largest frontier post. The invasion plan quickly faced difficulties; the 60-man force was intercepted and jailed by Salvadoran policemen before it got to the border. At 8:20 am on 18 June 1954, Castillo Armas led his invading troops over the border. Ten trained saboteurs preceded the invasion, with the aim of blowing up railways and cutting telegraph lines. At about the same time, Castillo Armas' planes flew over a pro-government rally in the capital. Castillo Armas demanded Árbenz's immediate surrender. The invasion provoked a brief panic in the capital, which quickly decreased as the rebels failed to make any striking moves. Bogged down by supplies and a lack of transportation, Castillo Armas' forces took several days to reach their targets, although their planes blew up a bridge on 19 June.

When the rebels did reach their targets, they met with further setbacks. The force of 122 men targeting Zacapa were intercepted and decisively beaten by a garrison of 30 Guatemalan soldiers, with only 30 rebels escaping death or capture. The force that attacked Puerto Barrios was dispatched by policemen and armed dockworkers, with many of the rebels fleeing back to Honduras. In an effort to regain momentum, the rebel planes tried air attacks on the capital. These attacks caused little material damage, but they had a significant psychological impact, leading many citizens to believe that the invasion force was more powerful than it actually was. The rebel bombers needed to fly out of the Nicaraguan capital of <a href="Managua">Managua</a>; as a result, they had a limited <a href="payload">payload</a>. A large number of them substituted dynamite or <a href="Molotov%20cocktail">Molotov cocktail</a>s for bombs, in an effort to create loud bangs with a lower payload. The planes targeted ammunition depots, parade grounds, and other visible targets.

Early in the morning on 27 June 1954, a CIA <a href="Lockheed%20P-38%20Lightning%23Variants">Lockheed P-38M Lightning</a> attacked <a href="Puerto%20San%20Jos%C3%A9">Puerto San José</a> and dropped <a href="napalm">napalm</a> bombs on the British cargo ship, , which was on charter to the U.S. company <a href="W.%20R.%20Grace%20and%20Company%23Shipping">W.R. Grace and Company Line</a>, and was being loaded with Guatemalan cotton and coffee. This incident cost the CIA one million U.S. dollars in compensation. On 22 June, another rebel plane bombed the Honduran town of <a href="San%20Pedro%20de%20Cop%C3%A1n">San Pedro de Copán</a>; John Dulles claimed the attack had been by the Guatemalan air force, thus avoiding diplomatic consequences. The handful of bombers that the rebel forces had begun with were shot down by the Guatemalan army within a few days, causing Castillo Armas to demand more from the CIA. Eisenhower quickly agreed to provide these additional planes, bolstering the rebel force. <a href="William%20Pawley">William Pawley</a> had a crucial role to play in the delivery of these aircraft.

Castillo Armas' army of 480 men was not large enough to defeat the Guatemalan military, even with U.S.-supplied aircraft. Therefore, the plans for Operation PBSUCCESS called for a campaign of <a href="psychological%20warfare">psychological warfare</a>, which would present Castillo Armas' victory as a "fait accompli" to the Guatemalan people, and would force Árbenz to resign. The propaganda campaign had begun well before the invasion, with the <a href="U.S.%20Information%20Agency">U.S. Information Agency</a> (USIA) writing hundreds of articles on Guatemala based on CIA reports, and distributing tens of thousands of leaflets throughout Latin America. The CIA persuaded friendly governments to screen video footage of Guatemala that supported the U.S. version of events.

"Alfhem"s success in evading the quarantine led to Washington escalating its intimidation of Guatemala through <a href="United%20States%20Navy">its navy</a>. On 24 May, the U.S. launched Operation HARDROCK BAKER, a naval blockade of Guatemala. Ships and submarines patrolled the Guatemalan coasts, and all approaching ships were stopped and searched; these included ships from Britain and France, violating international law. However Britain and France did not protest very strongly, hoping that in return the U.S. would not interfere with their efforts to subdue rebellious colonies in the Middle East. The intimidation was not solely naval; on 26 May one of Castillo Armas' planes flew over the capital, dropping leaflets that exhorted people to struggle against communism and support Castillo Armas.

The most wide-reaching psychological weapon was the radio station <a href="Voice%20of%20Liberation">Voice of Liberation</a>. It began broadcasting on 1 May 1954, carrying anti-communist propaganda, telling its listeners to resist the Árbenz government and support the liberating forces of Castillo Armas. The station claimed to be broadcasting from deep within the jungles of the Guatemalan hinterland, a message which many listeners believed. In actuality, the broadcasts were concocted in <a href="Miami">Miami</a> by Guatemalan exiles, flown to Central America, and broadcast through a mobile transmitter. The Voice of Liberation made an initial broadcast that was repeated four times, after which it took to transmitting two-hour bulletins twice a day. The transmissions were initially only heard intermittently in Guatemala City; a week later, the CIA significantly increased their transmitting power, allowing clear reception in the Guatemalan capital. The radio broadcasts have been given a lot of credit by historians for the success of the coup, due to the unrest they created throughout the country. They were unexpectedly assisted by the outage of the government-run radio station, which stopped transmitting for three weeks while a new antenna was being fitted. These transmissions continued throughout the conflict, broadcasting exaggerated news of rebel troops converging on the capital, and contributing to massive demoralization among both the army and the civilian population.

The Árbenz government originally meant to repel the invasion by arming the military-age populace, workers' militias, and the <a href="Military%20of%20Guatemala">Guatemalan Army</a>. Resistance from the armed forces, as well as public knowledge of the secret arms purchase, compelled the President to supply arms only to the Army. From the beginning of the invasion, Árbenz was confident that Castillo Armas could be defeated militarily and expressed this confidence in public. But he was worried that a defeat for Castillo Armas would provoke a direct invasion by the U.S. military. This also contributed to his decision not to arm civilians initially; lacking a military reason to do so, this could have cost him the support of the army. <a href="Carlos%20Enrique%20D%C3%ADaz%20de%20Le%C3%B3n">Carlos Enrique Díaz</a>, the chief of the Guatemalan armed forces, told Árbenz that arming civilians would be unpopular with his soldiers, and that "the army [would] do its duty".

Árbenz instead told Díaz to select officers to lead a counter-attack. Díaz chose a corps of officers who were all regarded to be men of personal integrity, and who were loyal to Árbenz. On the night of 19 June, most of the Guatemalan troops in the capital region left for Zacapa, joined by smaller detachments from other garrisons. Árbenz stated that "the invasion was a farce", but worried that if it was defeated on the Honduran border, Honduras would use it as an excuse to declare war on Guatemala, which would lead to a U.S. invasion. Due to the rumours spread by the Voice of Liberation, there were worries throughout the countryside that a <a href="fifth%20column">fifth column</a> attack was imminent; large numbers of peasants went to the government and asked for weapons to defend their country. They were repeatedly told that the army was "successfully defending our country". Nonetheless, peasant volunteers assisted the government war effort, manning roadblocks and donating supplies to the army. Weapons shipments dropped by rebel planes were intercepted and turned over to the government.

The Árbenz government also pursued diplomatic means to try and end the invasion. It sought support from El Salvador and Mexico; Mexico declined to get involved, and the Salvadoran government merely reported the Guatemalan effort to Peurifoy. Árbenz's largest diplomatic initiative was in taking the issue to the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a>. On 18 June the Guatemalan foreign minister petitioned the Council to "take measures necessary ... to put a stop to the aggression", which he said Nicaragua and Honduras were responsible for, along with "certain foreign monopolies which have been affected by the progressive policy of my government". The Security Council looked at Guatemala's complaint at an emergency session on 20 June. The debate was lengthy and heated, with Nicaragua and Honduras denying any wrongdoing, and the U.S. stating that Eisenhower's role as a general in World War II demonstrated that he was against imperialism. The <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> was the only country to support Guatemala. When the U.S. and its allies proposed referring the matter to the Organization of American States, the Soviet Union <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20veto%20power">vetoed</a> the proposal. Guatemala continued to press for a Security Council investigation; the proposal received the support of Britain and France, but on 24 June it was vetoed by the U.S., the first time it did so against its allies. The U.S. accompanied this with threats to the foreign offices of both countries that the U.S. would stop supporting their other initiatives. UN Secretary General <a href="Dag%20Hammarskj%C3%B6ld">Dag Hammarskjöld</a> called the U.S. position "the most serious blow so far aimed at the [United Nations]". A fact-finding mission was set up by the <a href="Inter-American%20Peace%20Committee">Inter-American Peace Committee</a>; Washington used its influence to delay the entry of the committee until the coup was complete and a military dictatorship installed.

Árbenz was initially confident that his army would quickly dispatch the rebel force. The victory of a small garrison of 30 soldiers over the 180 strong rebel force outside Zacapa strengthened his belief. By 21 June, Guatemalan soldiers had gathered at Zacapa under the command of Colonel Víctor M. León, who was believed to be loyal to Árbenz. León told Árbenz that the counter-attack would be delayed for logistical reasons, but assured him not to worry, as Castillo Armas would be defeated very soon. Other members of the government were not so certain. Army Chief of Staff Parinello inspected the troops at Zacapa on 23 June, and returned to the capital believing that the army would not fight. Afraid of a U.S. intervention in Castillo Armas' favor, he did not tell Árbenz of his suspicions. PGT leaders also began to have their suspicions; acting secretary general <a href="Bernardo%20Alvarado%20Monz%C3%B3n">Alvarado Monzón</a> sent a member of the central committee to Zacapa to investigate. He returned on 25 June, reporting that the army was highly demoralized, and would not fight. Monzón reported this to Árbenz, who quickly sent another investigator. He too returned the same report, carrying an additional message for Árbenz from the officers at Zacapa—asking the President to resign. The officers believed that given U.S. support for the rebels, defeat was inevitable, and Árbenz was to blame for it. He stated that if Árbenz did not resign, the army was likely to strike a deal with Castillo Armas, and march on the capital with him.

During this period, Castillo Armas had begun to intensify his aerial attacks, with the extra planes that Eisenhower had approved. They had limited material success; many of their bombs were surplus material from World War II, and failed to explode. Nonetheless, they had a significant psychological impact. On 25 June, the same day that he received the army's ultimatum, Árbenz learned that Castillo Armas had scored what later proved to be his only military victory, defeating the Guatemalan garrison at <a href="Chiquimula">Chiquimula</a>. Historian Piero Gleijeses has stated that if it were not for U.S. support for the rebellion, the officer corps of the Guatemalan army would have remained loyal to Árbenz because, although they were not uniformly his supporters, they were more wary of Castillo Armas, and also had strong nationalist views. As it was, they believed that the U.S. would intervene militarily, leading to a battle they could not win.

On the night of 25 June, Árbenz called a meeting of the senior leaders of the government, the political parties, and the labor unions. Colonel Díaz was also present. The President told them that the army at Zacapa had abandoned the government, and that the civilian population needed to be armed in order to defend the country. Díaz raised no objections, and the unions pledged several thousand troops between them. When the troops were mustered the next day, only a few hundred showed up. The civilian population of the capital had fought alongside the Guatemalan Revolution twice before—during the <a href="Guatemalan%20Revolution%23October%20revolution">popular uprising of 1944</a>, and again during the <a href="Guatemalan%20Revolution%231949%20coup%20attempt">attempted coup of 1949</a>—but on this occasion the army, intimidated by the United States, refused to fight. The union members were reluctant to fight both the invasion and their own military. Seeing this, Díaz reneged on his support of the President, and began plotting to overthrow Árbenz with the assistance of other senior army officers. They informed Peurifoy of this plan, asking him to stop the hostilities in return for Árbenz's resignation. Peurifoy promised to arrange a truce, and the plotters went to Árbenz and informed him of their decision. Árbenz, utterly exhausted and seeking to preserve at least a measure of the democratic reforms that he had brought, agreed without demur. After informing his cabinet of his decision, he left the presidential palace at 8 pm on 27 June 1954, having taped a resignation speech that was broadcast an hour later. In it, he stated that he was resigning in order to eliminate the "pretext for the invasion", and that he wished to preserve the gains of the October Revolution of 1944. He walked to the nearby <a href="List%20of%20diplomatic%20missions%20of%20Mexico">Mexican Embassy</a>, seeking political asylum. Two months later he was granted safe passage out of the country, and flew to exile in Mexico. Some 120 Árbenz loyalists or communists were also allowed to leave, and none of the assassination plans contemplated by the CIA were actually implemented.

Immediately after the President announced his resignation, Díaz announced on the radio that he was taking over the presidency, and that the army would continue to fight against the invasion of Castillo Armas. He headed a military junta which also consisted of Colonels <a href="Elfego%20Hern%C3%A1n%20Monz%C3%B3n%20Aguirre">Elfego Hernán Monzón Aguirre</a> and <a href="Jose%20Angel%20S%C3%A1nchez">Jose Angel Sánchez</a>. Two days later Ambassador Peurifoy told Díaz that he had to resign because, in the words of a CIA officer who spoke to Díaz, he was "not convenient for American foreign policy". Peurifoy castigated Díaz for allowing Árbenz to criticize the United States in his resignation speech; meanwhile, a U.S.-trained pilot dropped a bomb on the army's main powder magazine, in order to intimidate the colonel. Soon after, Díaz was overthrown by a rapid bloodless coup led by Colonel Monzón, who was more pliable to U.S. interests. Díaz later stated that Peurifoy had presented him with a list of names of communists, and demanded that all of them be shot by the next day; Díaz had refused, turning Peurifoy further against him. On 17 June, the army leaders at Zacapa had begun to negotiate with Castillo Armas. They signed a pact, the "Pacto de Las Tunas", three days later, which placed the army at Zacapa under Castillo Armas, in return for a general amnesty. The army returned to its barracks a few days later, "despondent, with a terrible sense of defeat".

Although Monzón was staunchly anti-communist and repeatedly spoke of his loyalty to the U.S., he was unwilling to hand over power to Castillo Armas. The fall of Díaz had led Peurifoy to believe that the CIA should make way and let the State Department play the lead role in negotiating with the new government of Guatemala. The State Department asked <a href="%C3%93scar%20Osorio">Óscar Osorio</a>, the dictator of El Salvador, to invite all players for talks in <a href="San%20Salvador">San Salvador</a>. Osorio agreed, and Monzón and Castillo Armas arrived in the Salvadoran capital on 30 June. Peurifoy initially remained in Guatemala City, to avoid the appearance of a heavy U.S. role, but he was forced to travel to San Salvador when the negotiations came close to breaking down on the first day. In the words of John Dulles, Peurifoy's role was to "crack some heads together". Neither Monzón nor Castillo Armas could have remained in power without U.S. support, and thus Peurifoy was able to force an agreement, which was announced at 4:45 am on 2 July. Under the agreement, Castillo Armas and his subordinate Major Enrique Trinidad Oliva joined the three-person junta headed by Monzón, who remained president. On 7 July Colonels Dubois and Cruz Salazar, Monzón's supporters on the junta, resigned, according to the secret agreement they had made without Monzón's knowledge. Outnumbered, Monzón also resigned, allowing Castillo Armas to be unanimously elected president of the junta. The two colonels were paid 100,000 U.S. dollars apiece for their cooperation. The U.S. promptly recognized the new government on 13 July. Soon after taking office as President, Castillo Armas faced a coup from young army cadets, who were unhappy with the army's surrender to him. The coup was crushed, leaving 29 dead and 91 wounded. Elections were held in early October, from which all political parties were barred. Castillo Armas was the only candidate; he won the election with 99% of the vote, completing his transition into power.

The Guatemalan "coup d'état" was reviled internationally. "<a href="Le%20Monde">Le Monde</a>" of Paris and "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" of London attacked the United States' coup as a "modern form of <a href="economic%20colonialism">economic colonialism</a>". In Latin America, public and official opinion was sharply critical of the U.S., and for many Guatemala became a symbol of armed resistance to U.S. hegemony. Former British Prime Minister <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a> called it "a plain act of aggression". When Allen Dulles described the coup as a victory of "democracy" over communism and claimed that the situation in Guatemala was "being cured by the Guatemalans themselves", a British official remarked that "in places, it might almost be <a href="Vyacheslav%20Molotov">Molotov</a> speaking about ... Czechoslovakia or Hitler speaking about <a href="Austria">Austria</a>". UN Secretary General Hammarskjöld said that the paramilitary invasion with which the U.S. deposed Guatemala's elected government was a geopolitical action that violated the human rights stipulations of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Charter">United Nations Charter</a>. Even the usually pro–U.S. newspapers of <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> condemned the coup. <a href="Kate%20Doyle">Kate Doyle</a>, the Director of the Mexico Project of the <a href="National%20Security%20Archives">National Security Archives</a>, described the coup as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala.

The coup had broad support among U.S. politicians. Historian Piero Gleijeses writes that the foreign policy of both Republican and Democratic parties expressed an intransigent assertion of U.S. hegemony over Central America, making them predisposed to seeing communist threats where none existed. Thus Eisenhower's continuation of the Monroe Doctrine had continued <a href="Bipartisanship%23In%20U.S.%20politics">bipartisan</a> support. The coup met with strong negative reactions in Latin America; a wave of anti-United States protests followed the overthrow of Árbenz. These sentiments persisted for several decades afterwards; historians have pointed to the coup as a reason for the hostile reception given to U.S. Vice President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> when he visited Latin America four years later. A State Department study found that negative public reactions to the coup had occurred in eleven Latin American countries, including a few that were otherwise pro-American. Historian <a href="John%20Lewis%20Gaddis">John Lewis Gaddis</a> states that knowledge of the CIA's role in coups in Iran and Guatemala gave the agency "an almost mythic reputation throughout Latin America and the Middle East as an instrument with which the United States could depose governments it disliked, whenever it wished to do so".

Operation PBHISTORY was an effort by the CIA to analyze documents from the Árbenz government to justify the 1954 coup after the fact, in particular by finding evidence that Guatemalan communists had been under the influence of the Soviet Union. Due to the quick overthrow of the Árbenz government, the CIA believed that the administration would not have been able to destroy any incriminating documents, and that these could be analyzed to demonstrate Árbenz's supposed Soviet ties. The CIA also believed this would help it better understand the workings of Latin American communist parties, on which subject the CIA had very little real information. A final motivation was that international responses to the coup had been very negative, even among allies of the U.S., and the CIA wished to counteract this anti-U.S. sentiment. The operation began on 4 July 1954 with the arrival of four CIA agents in Guatemala City, led by a specialist in the structure of communist parties. Their targets included Árbenz's personal belongings, police documents, and the headquarters of the Guatemalan Party of Labour.

Although the initial search failed to find any links to the Soviet Union, the CIA decided to extend the operation, and on 4 August a much larger team was deployed, with members from many government departments, including the State Department and the USIA. The task force was given the cover name Social Research Group. To avoid confrontation with Guatemalan nationalists, the CIA opted to leave the documents in Guatemalan possession, instead funding the creation of a Guatemalan intelligence agency that would try to dismantle the communist organizations. Thus the <a href="National%20Committee%20of%20Defense%20Against%20Communism">National Committee of Defense Against Communism</a> ("Comité de Defensa Nacional Contra el Comunismo") was created on 20 July, and granted a great deal of power over military and police functions. The personnel of the new agency were also put to work analyzing the same documents. The document-processing phase of the operation was terminated on 28 September 1954, having examined 500,000 documents. There was tension between the different U.S. government agencies about using the information; the CIA wished to use it to subvert communists, the USIA for propaganda. The CIA's leadership of the operation allowed it to retain control over any documents deemed necessary for clandestine operations. A consequence of PBHISTORY was the opening of a CIA file on Argentine communist <a href="Che%20Guevara">Ernesto Che Guevara</a>.

In the subsequent decade, the documents gathered were used by the authors of several books, most frequently with covert CIA assistance, which described the Guatemalan Revolution and the 1954 coup in terms favorable to the CIA. Despite the efforts of the CIA, both international and academic reaction to U.S. policy remained highly negative. Even books partially funded by the CIA were somewhat critical of its role. PBHISTORY failed in its chief objective of finding convincing evidence that the PGT had been instruments of the Soviet Union, or even that it had any connection to Moscow whatsoever. The Soviet description of the coup, that the U.S. had crushed a democratic revolution to protect the United Fruit Company's control over the Guatemalan economy, became much more widely accepted. Historian Mark Hove stated that "Operation PBHistory proved ineffective because of 'a new, smoldering resentment' that had emerged in Latin America over US intervention in Guatemala."

The 1954 coup had a large political fallout both inside and outside Guatemala. The relatively easy overthrow of Árbenz, coming soon after the similar <a href="1953%20Iranian%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">overthrow of the democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister</a> in 1953, made the CIA overconfident in its abilities, which led to the failed <a href="Bay%20of%20Pigs%20Invasion">Bay of Pigs Invasion</a> to overthrow the Cuban government in 1961. Among the civilians living in Guatemala City during the coup was a 25-year-old Ernesto Che Guevara. After a couple of abortive attempts to fight on the side of the government, Guevara took shelter at the embassy of <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, before eventually being granted safe passage to Mexico, where he would join the <a href="Cuban%20Revolution">Cuban Revolution</a>. His experience of the Guatemalan coup was a large factor in convincing him "of the necessity for armed struggle ... against imperialism", and would inform his successful military strategy during the Cuban Revolution. Árbenz's experience during the Guatemalan coup also helped Fidel Castro's Cuban regime in thwarting the CIA invasion. Throughout the years of the Guatemalan Revolution, both United States policy makers and the U.S. media had tended to believe the theory of a communist threat. When Árbenz had announced that he had evidence of U.S. complicity in the Salamá incident, it had been dismissed, and virtually the entire U.S. press portrayed Castillo Armas' invasion as a dramatic victory against communism. The press in Latin America were less restrained in their criticism of the U.S., and the coup resulted in lasting anti-United States sentiment in the region.

Within Guatemala, Castillo Armas worried that he lacked popular support, and thus tried to eliminate all opposition. He promptly arrested several thousand opposition leaders, branding them communists, repealed the constitution of 1945, and granted himself virtually unbridled power. Concentration camps were built to hold the prisoners when the jails overflowed. Acting on the advice of Allen Dulles, Castillo Armas detained a number of citizens trying to flee the country. He also created the National Committee of Defense Against Communism, with sweeping powers of arrest, detention, and deportation. Over the next few years, the committee investigated nearly 70,000 people. Many were imprisoned, executed, or "<a href="Forced%20disappearance">disappeared</a>", frequently without trial. He outlawed all labor unions, peasant organizations, and political parties, except for his own, the <a href="National%20Liberation%20Movement%20%28Guatemala%29">National Liberation Movement</a> ("Movimiento de Liberación Nacional", MLN), which was the ruling party until 1957, and remained influential for decades after. Castillo Armas' dependence on the officer corps and the mercenaries who had put him in power led to widespread corruption, and the Eisenhower administration was soon subsidizing the Guatemalan government with many millions of U.S. dollars. Castillo Armas also reversed the agrarian reforms of Árbenz, leading the U.S. embassy to comment that it was a "long step backwards" from the previous policy. The UFC did not profit from the coup; although it regained most of its privileges, its profits continued to decline, and it was eventually merged with another company to save itself from bankruptcy. Despite the influence which some of the local Catholic Church leaders had in the coup, <a href="Anti-Catholicism%23In%20primarily%20Catholic%20countries">anti-Catholic</a> restrictions which had been enforced under previous governments in Guatemala would resume by the 1960s, as many anti-communist governments felt the Church had too much sympathy towards socialist parties.

The rolling-back of the progressive policies of the civilian governments resulted in a series of leftist insurgencies in the countryside, beginning in 1960. This triggered the 36-year <a href="Guatemalan%20Civil%20War">Guatemalan Civil War</a> between the U.S.-backed military government of Guatemala and the leftist insurgents, who frequently had a large degree of popular support. The largest of these movements was led by the <a href="Guerrilla%20Army%20of%20the%20Poor">Guerrilla Army of the Poor</a>, which at its largest point had 270,000 members. During the civil war, atrocities against civilians were committed by both sides; 93% of these violations were committed by the U.S.-backed military, which included a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous <a href="Maya%20people">Maya population</a> in the 1980s. The violence was particularly severe during the presidencies of <a href="Efra%C3%ADn%20R%C3%ADos%20Montt">Ríos Montt</a> and <a href="Fernando%20Romeo%20Lucas%20Garc%C3%ADa">Lucas García</a>.

Numerous other human rights violations were committed, including massacres of civilian populations, rape, aerial bombardment, and <a href="Forced%20disappearance%23Guatemala">forced disappearances</a>. Gleijeses wrote that Guatemala was "ruled by a culture of fear", and that it held the "macabre record for human rights violations in Latin America". These violations were partially the result of a particularly brutal <a href="counter-insurgency">counter-insurgency</a> strategy adopted by the government. The ideological narrative that the 1954 coup had represented a battle against communism was often used to justify the violence in the 1980s. Historians have attributed the violence of the civil war to the 1954 coup, and the "anti-communist paranoia" that it generated. The civil war came to an end in 1996, with a peace accord between the guerrillas and the government of Guatemala, which included an amnesty for the fighters on both sides. The civil war claimed the lives of an estimated 200,000 civilians in all.

In March 1999, U.S. President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> apologized to the Guatemalan government for the atrocities committed by the U.S.-backed dictatorships. Clinton stated "For the United States it is important that I state clearly that support for military forces and intelligence units which engaged in violence and widespread repression was wrong, and the United States must not repeat that mistake." The apology came soon after the release of a truth commission report that documented U.S. support for the military forces that committed genocide.

In May 2011 the Guatemalan government signed an agreement with Árbenz's surviving family to restore his legacy and publicly apologize for the government's role in ousting him. This included a financial settlement to the family. The formal apology was made at the National Palace by Guatemalan President <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Colom">Álvaro Colom</a> on 20 October 2011, to Jacobo Árbenz Villanova, the son of the former president, and a Guatemalan politician. Colom stated, "It was a crime to Guatemalan society and it was an act of aggression to a government starting its democratic spring." The agreement established several forms of reparation for the next of kin of Árbenz Guzmán.
