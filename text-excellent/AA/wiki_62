John Adair

John Adair (January 9, 1757 – May 19, 1840) was an American pioneer, soldier, and politician. He was the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Kentucky">eighth</a> <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Governor of Kentucky</a> and represented the state in both the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a>. A native of <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, Adair enlisted in the state militia and served in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a>, during which he was twice captured and held as a prisoner of war by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">British</a>. Following the War, he was elected as a delegate to South Carolina's convention to ratify the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>.

After moving to Kentucky in 1786, Adair participated in the <a href="Northwest%20Indian%20War">Northwest Indian War</a>, including a skirmish with the <a href="Miami%20people">Miami</a> Chief <a href="Little%20Turtle">Little Turtle</a> near <a href="Fort%20St.%20Clair">Fort St. Clair</a> in 1792. Popular for his service in two wars, he entered politics in 1792 as a delegate to Kentucky's constitutional convention. Adair was elected to a total of eight terms in the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">state House of Representatives</a> between 1793 and 1803. He served as Speaker of the Kentucky House in 1802 and 1803, and was a delegate to the state's <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution%23The%201799%20Constitution">Second Constitutional Convention</a> in 1799. He ascended to the United States Senate to fill the seat vacated when <a href="John%20Breckinridge%20%28U.S.%20Attorney%20General%29">John Breckinridge</a> resigned to become <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Attorney General of the United States</a> in the <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20States">Cabinet</a> of <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, but failed to win a full term in the subsequent election due to his implication in a <a href="Burr%20conspiracy">treason conspiracy</a> involving Vice President <a href="Aaron%20Burr">Aaron Burr</a>. After a long legal battle, he was acquitted of any wrongdoing; and his accuser, General <a href="James%20Wilkinson">James Wilkinson</a>, was ordered to issue an apology. The negative publicity kept him out of politics for more than a decade.

Adair's participation in the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, and a subsequent protracted defense of Kentucky's soldiers against General <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>'s charges that they showed cowardice at the <a href="Battle%20of%20New%20Orleans">Battle of New Orleans</a>, restored his reputation. He returned to the State House in 1817, and <a href="Isaac%20Shelby">Isaac Shelby</a>, his commanding officer in the War who was serving a second term as governor, appointed him <a href="adjutant%20general">adjutant general</a> of the state militia. In 1820, Adair was elected eighth governor on a platform of financial relief for Kentuckians hit hard by the <a href="Panic%20of%201819">Panic of 1819</a>, and the ensuing economic recession. His primary effort toward this end was the creation of the <a href="Bank%20of%20the%20Commonwealth%20%28Kentucky%29">Bank of the Commonwealth</a>, but many of his other financial reforms were deemed unconstitutional by the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a>, touching off the <a href="Old%20Court%E2%80%93New%20Court%20controversy">Old Court–New Court controversy</a>. Following his term as governor, Adair served one undistinguished term in the United States House of Representatives and did not run for re-election.

John Adair was born January 9, 1757, in <a href="Chester%20County%2C%20South%20Carolina">Chester County, South Carolina</a>, a son of <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a> immigrants Baron William and Mary [Moore] Adair. He was educated at schools in <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a>, and enlisted in the South Carolina colonial militia at the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. He was assigned to the regiment of his friend, Edward Lacey, under the command of <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> <a href="Thomas%20Sumter">Thomas Sumter</a> and participated in the failed <a href="Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Colonial</a> assault on a <a href="Loyalist">Loyalist</a> outpost at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rocky%20Mount">Battle of Rocky Mount</a> and the subsequent Colonial victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hanging%20Rock">Battle of Hanging Rock</a>. During the British victory over the Colonists at the August 16, 1780, <a href="Battle%20of%20Camden">Battle of Camden</a>, Adair was taken as a <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a>. He contracted <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> and was treated harshly by his captors during his months-long imprisonment. Although he escaped at one point, Adair was unable to reach safety because of difficulties related to his smallpox infection and was recaptured by British Colonel <a href="Banastre%20Tarleton">Banastre Tarleton</a> after just three days. Subsequently, he was released via a <a href="prisoner%20exchange">prisoner exchange</a>. In 1781, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the South Carolina militia, and fought in the drawn <a href="Battle%20of%20Eutaw%20Springs">Battle of Eutaw Springs</a>, the war's last major battle in the Carolinas. Edward Lacey was elected <a href="sheriff">sheriff</a> of Chester County after the war, and Adair replaced him in his former capacity as the county's <a href="justice%20of%20the%20peace">justice of the peace</a>. He was chosen as a delegate to the South Carolina convention to ratify the <a href="U.S.%20Constitution">U.S. Constitution</a>.

In 1784, Adair married Katherine Palmer. They had twelve children, ten of them daughters. One married <a href="Thomas%20Bell%20Monroe">Thomas Bell Monroe</a>, who later served as Adair's <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20of%20Kentucky">Secretary of State</a> and was appointed to a federal judgeship. In 1786, the Adairs migrated westward to <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, settling in <a href="Mercer%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Mercer County</a>.

Enlisting for service as a <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> in the <a href="Northwest%20Indian%20War">Northwest Indian War</a> in 1791, Adair was soon promoted to major and assigned to the brigade of <a href="James%20Wilkinson">James Wilkinson</a>. On November 6, 1792, a band of <a href="Miami%20people">Miamis</a> under the command of <a href="Little%20Turtle">Little Turtle</a> encountered Adair and about 100 men serving under him on a scouting mission near <a href="Fort%20St.%20Clair">Fort St. Clair</a> in <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>. When the Miami attacked, Adair ordered Lieutenant (and later governor of Kentucky) <a href="George%20Madison">George Madison</a> to attack their right flank while Adair led 25 men to attack the left flank. (Adair had intended for a subordinate to lead the charge, but the officer was killed before Adair could give the order.) The maneuver forced the Miamis to fall back and allowed Adair's men to escape. They retreated to their camp and made a stand, forcing the Miamis to withdraw. Six of Adair's men were killed; another four were missing and five were wounded. Among the wounded were Madison and <a href="Richard%20Taylor%20%28colonel%29">Richard Taylor</a>, father of future U.S. President <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>.

Recognizing his bravery and fighting skill, Adair's superiors promoted him to <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a>. He was assigned to the command of <a href="Charles%20Scott%20%28governor%29">Charles Scott</a>, who would eventually serve as Kentucky's fourth governor. He assisted in the construction of <a href="Greenville%2C%20Ohio">Fort Greeneville</a> in 1794, forwarding supplies to <a href="Anthony%20Wayne">Anthony Wayne</a> during his operations which ended in a decisive victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fallen%20Timbers">Battle of Fallen Timbers</a>.

Popular for his military service, Adair was chosen as a delegate to the Kentucky constitutional convention in 1792. Upon the state's admission to the Union, he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, serving from 1793 to 1795. He remained active in the Kentucky militia, and on February 25, 1797, he was promoted to <a href="brigadier%20general">brigadier general</a> and given command of the 2nd Brigade of the Kentucky Militia. He was promoted to <a href="major%20general">major general</a> and given command of the 2nd Division of the Kentucky Militia on December 16, 1799.

Adair returned to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1798. When Kentuckians voted to hold another constitutional convention in 1799 to correct weaknesses in their first constitution, Adair was chosen as a delegate. At the convention, he was the leader of a group of politically ambitious delegates who opposed most limits on the powers and terms of office of elected officials, particularly on legislators. He was elected to the Kentucky House again from 1800 to 1803. A candidate for a seat in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> in 1800, he was defeated in an overwhelming 68–13 vote of the legislature by <a href="John%20Breckinridge%20%28U.S.%20Attorney%20General%29">John Breckinridge</a>, who had been the acknowledged leader of the just-concluded constitutional convention. In 1802, Adair succeeded Breckinridge as <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> by a vote of 30–14 over Elder David Purviance, the candidate preferred by Governor <a href="James%20Garrard">James Garrard</a>. He continued to serve as Speaker for the duration of his tenure in the House. In 1802, the legislature formed <a href="Adair%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Adair County, Kentucky</a>, naming it after the popular Speaker.

In January 1804, Garrard nominated Adair to the position of registrar of the state land office. Adair's was the seventh name submitted by Garrard to the state Senate for the position; his approval by the Senate marked the end of a two-month imbroglio between Garrard and the legislature over the appointment. Later that year, he was a candidate for the U.S. Senate seat then occupied by <a href="John%20Brown%20%28Kentucky%29">John Brown</a>. Although <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> supported Brown's re-election, Adair had the support of <a href="Felix%20Grundy">Felix Grundy</a>. Grundy accused Brown of involvement in a conspiracy to make Kentucky a province of the Spanish government, damaging his popularity. Adair won a plurality, but not a majority, of the votes cast in six consecutive ballots. Clay then threw his support to <a href="Buckner%20Thruston">Buckner Thruston</a>, a more palatable candidate who defeated Adair on the seventh ballot. Grundy's influence in the legislature continued to grow, and when John Breckinridge resigned to accept President <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>'s appointment as <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">U.S. Attorney General</a> in August 1805, the Senate chose Adair to fill the vacancy.

Former Vice-President <a href="Aaron%20Burr">Aaron Burr</a> visited Kentucky in 1805, reaching <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort, Kentucky</a>, on May 25 and lodging with former Senator John Brown. During the trip, he consulted with many prominent politicians, Adair among them, about the possibility of wresting Mexico from Spain. Most of those he spoke with believed he was acting on behalf of the federal government and intended to expand U.S. holdings in Mexico. Adair believed this too, having received letters from his former commander, James Wilkinson, which appeared to confirm it. In 1806, however, Burr was arrested in Frankfort on charges of <a href="treason">treason</a>. Officials claimed he in fact <a href="Burr%20conspiracy">intended to create a new, independent nation</a> in Spanish lands.
Convinced of his innocence, Henry Clay represented Burr, while <a href="Joseph%20Hamilton%20Daveiss">Joseph Hamilton Daveiss</a> acted as prosecutor. <a href="Harry%20Innes">Harry Innes</a> presided over the trial, which commenced November 11. Daveiss had to ask for a postponement because <a href="Davis%20Floyd">Davis Floyd</a>, one of his key witnesses, was then serving in the <a href="Indiana%20General%20Assembly">Indiana General Assembly</a> and could not be present in court. The court next convened on December 2, and Daveiss again had to ask for a postponement, this time because Adair, another witness, was not present. Adair had traveled to <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> to inspect a tract of land he had recently purchased there. On his arrival in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, he was arrested on the order of his former commander, James Wilkinson, then serving as governor of the <a href="Louisiana%20Territory">Louisiana Territory</a>.

Clay had insisted that the trial proceed in Adair's absence, and, the next day, Daveiss presented indictments against Burr for treason and against Adair as a co-conspirator. After hearing testimony, the <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> rejected the indictment against Adair as "not a true bill" and similarly dismissed the charges against Burr two days later. After his vindication by the grand jury, Adair counter-sued Wilkinson in federal court. Although the legal battle between the two spanned several years, the court found that Wilkinson had no solid evidence against Adair and ordered Wilkinson to issue a public apology and pay Adair $2,500 in damages. Adair's acquittal and successful counter-suit came too late to prevent damage to his political career. Because of his association with Burr's scheme, he lost the election for a full term in the Senate in November 1806. Rather than wait for his partial term to expire, he resigned on November 18, 1806.

Adair rejoined the Kentucky militia at the outset of the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. After <a href="Oliver%20Hazard%20Perry">Oliver Hazard Perry</a>'s victory in the September 10, 1813, <a href="Battle%20of%20Lake%20Erie">Battle of Lake Erie</a>, <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> called on Kentucky Governor <a href="Isaac%20Shelby">Isaac Shelby</a>, a popular Revolutionary War hero, to recruit troops in Kentucky and join him in his invasion of Canada. Shelby asked Adair to serve as his first <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a>. Future Kentucky governor and U.S. Senator <a href="John%20J.%20Crittenden">John J. Crittenden</a> was Shelby's second aide, and future U.S. Senator and <a href="United%20States%20Postmaster%20General">Postmaster General</a> <a href="William%20T.%20Barry">William T. Barry</a> was his secretary. Adair rendered commendable service in the campaign, most notably at the American victory in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Thames">Battle of the Thames</a> on October 5, 1813. Shelby praised Adair's service and in 1814, made him <a href="adjutant%20general">adjutant general</a> of Kentucky and <a href="brevet%20%28military%29">brevetted</a> him to the rank of brigadier general.

In late 1814, <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> requested reinforcements from Kentucky for his defense of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. Adair quickly raised three regiments, but the federal government provided them no weapons and no means of transportation. <a href="James%20Taylor%2C%20Jr.%20%28Kentucky%29">James Taylor, Jr.</a>, then serving as <a href="quartermaster%20general">quartermaster general</a> of the state militia, took out a $6,000 mortgage on his personal land to purchase boats to transport Adair's men. The number of men with Adair was later disputed; sources variously give numbers between 700 and 1,500. Many did not have weapons, and the ones who did were primarily armed with their own civilian rifles. John Thomas, to whom Adair was an adjunct, fell ill just before the battle commenced, leaving Adair responsible for all the Kentuckians present at the battle.

On January 7, 1815, Adair traveled to New Orleans and requested that the city's leaders lend him several stands of arms from the city armory to arm his militiamen. The officials agreed under the condition that the removal of the arms from the armory be kept secret from the citizenry. The weapons were placed in boxes and delivered to Adair's camp on the night of January 7. At Adair's suggestion, his men were placed in reserve and located centrally behind the <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> militiamen under <a href="William%20Carroll%20%28Tennessee%20politician%29">William Carroll</a>. From there, they could quickly move to reinforce whichever portion of the American line received the heaviest attack from the British.

Apparently unaware of Adair's request, that evening, Jackson ordered 400 unarmed Kentucky militiamen under Colonel John Davis to march to New Orleans to obtain arms, then reinforce the 450 Louisiana militiamen under David B. Morgan on the west bank of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>. When they arrived in New Orleans, they were told that the city's arms had already been shipped to Adair. The citizens collected what weapons they had —mostly old muskets in various states of disrepair —and gave them to Davis' men. About 200 men were thus armed and reported to Morgan as ordered, just hours before the start of the <a href="Battle%20of%20New%20Orleans">Battle of New Orleans</a>. The remainder of Davis's men returned to the main camp, still without weapons.

As the British approached on the morning of January 8, it became evident that they would try to break the American line through Carroll's Tennesseans, and Adair advanced his men to support them. The main American line held and repulsed the British attack; in total, only six Americans were killed and seven wounded. Meanwhile, Davis' Kentuckians on the west bank had, upon their arrival in Morgan's camp, been sent to meet the advance of a secondary British force. Outnumbered, poorly armed, and without the benefit of breastworks or artillery support, they were quickly outflanked and forced to retreat. Seeing the retreat of the Kentuckians, Morgan's militiamen abandoned their breastworks; Adair would later claim they had never even fired a shot. The British quickly abandoned the position they had just captured, but Jackson resented the setback in an otherwise spectacular victory.

Jackson's official report blamed the Kentuckians' retreat for the collapse of the west bank defenses, and many Kentuckians felt it played down the importance of Adair's militiamen on the east bank in preserving the American line and securing the victory. Davis' men insisted the report was based on Jackson's misunderstanding of the facts and asked that Adair request a court of inquiry, which convened in February 1815 with Major General Carroll of Tennessee presiding. The court's report found that "[t]he retreat of the Kentucky militia, which, considering their position, the deficiency of their arms, and other causes, may be excusable," and that the formation of the troops on the west bank was "exceptional", noting that 500 Louisiana troops supported by three artillery pieces and protected by a strong breastwork were charged with defending a line that stretched only while Davis's 170 Kentuckians, poorly armed and protected only by a small ditch, were expected to defend a line over long. On February 10, 1816, the Kentucky General Assembly passed a resolution thanking Adair for his service at the Battle of New Orleans and for his defense of the soldiers accused by Jackson.
Jackson approved the court's findings, but they were not the full refutation of Jackson's report that many Kentuckians —including Adair —had wanted. In a letter that was quickly made public, Adair —formerly one of Jackson's close friends —insisted that Jackson withdraw or modify his official report, but Jackson refused. This ended the matter until June 1815 when H. P. Helm, secretary to John Thomas, forwarded to a Frankfort newspaper remarks from "the general" that had been annexed to the official report. "The remarks" stated that the general was now convinced that the initial reports of cowardice by Davis's men "had been misrepresented" and that their retreat had been "not only excusable, but absolutely justifiable." The remarks, popularly believed to be from Jackson in response to Adair's letter, were subsequently reprinted across Kentucky. The "general" referenced was in fact General John Thomas; Jackson had never seen them. Helm claimed he sent a subsequent correction to the newspaper that published the remarks, but it was never printed.

Jackson did not discover the remarks until they were published again in January 1817 in response to a Boston newspaper's criticism of Kentucky militiamen. He wrote to the "Kentucky Reporter" at that time, denouncing the remarks as a forgery. The "Reporter" investigated and published an explanation of how Thomas's remarks had been attributed to Jackson. They did not reprint Jackson's letter because they felt his claim that the remarks had been intentionally forged —a charge which was now found to be false —was too inflammatory. The editors promised that if their retraction did not satisfy Jackson, they would fully publish any of his additional remarks on the subject. In Jackson's April 1817 response, he implied that Adair had intentionally misrepresented the remarks, and reasserted that they had been forged, possibly by Adair himself. Adair believed Jackson's references to the remarks as a "forged dish, dressed in the true Spanish style" was a thinly veiled reference to Adair's alleged participation in the Burr conspiracy. As ostensible proof that he was not predisposed against Kentuckians, Jackson also implied that he had not reported additional dishonorable behavior by Kentucky militiamen during the battle. This letter thrust the dispute into the national spotlight and prompted Adair to resume correspondence with him both to defend Davis's men and refute Jackson's charges of conspiracy. In his May 1817 response, he reasserted his defense of the Kentucky militiamen at New Orleans and dismissed many of Jackson's allegations as unimportant and untrue. He flatly denied the existence of a conspiracy, and chastised Jackson for making charges without supporting evidence. Responding to Jackson's allusion to Spain, Adair recalled that Jackson had also been implicated with Burr.

Unable to provide tangible evidence of Adair's alleged misdeeds, Jackson provided indirect evidence that a conspiracy was possible. His response, delayed by his treaty negotiations with the <a href="Cherokee%20Nation%20%2819th%20century%29">Cherokee</a>, was printed September 3, 1817, and used complicated calculations based on spacing and distance, to argue that Adair had only half the number of men he claimed to have commanded at the Battle of New Orleans. Further, he claimed that Adair had ordered Davis to New Orleans to obtain weapons knowing that the arms had already been taken by other brigades under Adair's command. Either Adair had given a foolish order, or he did not have as many men in his main force as he claimed. He closed by promising that this would be his last statement on the matter. Adair's October 29, 1817, response was delayed, he said, because he was awaiting documents from New Orleans that never came. In it, he quoted from a letter to Jackson's aide-de-camp —cited by Jackson himself in previous correspondence —showing that Jackson had been made aware of both the existence and the authorship of Thomas's remarks in 1815 but declined the opportunity to refute them. He also defended his account of the number of troops under his command, which he had consistently reported as being near 1,000, and asked why Jackson had not challenged it until now. Finally, he claimed that not only did he retrieve the weapons from New Orleans under Jackson's orders, but he rode Jackson's horse to New Orleans to effect the transaction. Tradition holds that this letter prompted either Adair or Jackson to challenge the other to a <a href="duel">duel</a>, but friends of both men averted the conflict after assembling to watch; no written evidence of the event exists. Tensions between the two eventually eased, and Adair came to comfort Jackson after his wife <a href="Rachel%20Jackson">Rachel</a>'s death in 1828. Adair also campaigned for Jackson during his presidential campaigns in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201824">1824</a>, <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201828">1828</a>, and <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201832">1832</a>. Jackson's opponents compiled copies of his letters into campaign pamphlets to use against him in Kentucky during these elections.

Adair's participation in the War of 1812 and subsequent correspondence with Jackson restored his reputation. He continued to serve as adjutant general until 1817, when the voters returned him to the state House of Representatives. He was nominated for Speaker of the House during that term, and, although he was not elected, he drew support from members of both parties, largely because of his correspondence with Jackson.

In the aftermath of the <a href="Panic%20of%201819">Panic of 1819</a> —the first major financial crisis in United States history —the primary political issue of the day was debt relief. The federal government had created the <a href="Second%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Second Bank of the United States</a> in 1817, and its strict credit policy hit Kentucky's large debtor class hard. Sitting governor <a href="Gabriel%20Slaughter">Gabriel Slaughter</a> had lobbied for some measures favored by the state's debtors, particularly punitive taxes against the branches of the Bank of the United States in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a> and <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington</a>. The <a href="Second%20Party%20System">Second Party System</a> had not yet developed, but there were nonetheless two opposing factions that arose around the debt relief issue. The first —primarily composed of <a href="land%20speculation">land speculators</a> who had bought large land parcels on credit and were unable to repay their debts due to the financial crisis —was dubbed the Relief Party (or "faction") and favored more legislation favorable to debtors. Opposed to them was the Anti-Relief Party; it was composed primarily of the state's aristocracy, many of whom were creditors to the land speculators and demanded that their contracts be adhered to without interference from the government. They claimed that no government intervention could effectively aid the debtors and that attempts to do so would only prolong the economic depression.

Adair was the clear leader of the Relief faction, and his popularity had been enhanced thanks to his lengthy and public dispute with Jackson. In the 1820 gubernatorial election, he was elected as Kentucky's chief executive over three fellow <a href="Democratic-Republican%20Party">Democratic-Republicans</a>. Adair garnered 20,493 votes; U.S. Senator <a href="William%20Logan%20%28Kentuckian%29">William Logan</a> finished second with 19,497, fellow veteran <a href="Joseph%20Desha">Joseph Desha</a> received 12,419, and Colonel Anthony Butler mustered only 9,567 votes. Proponents of debt relief measures also won majorities in both houses of the General Assembly.

Kentucky historian <a href="Lowell%20H.%20Harrison">Lowell H. Harrison</a> opined that the most important measure implemented during Adair's administration was the creation of the <a href="Bank%20of%20the%20Commonwealth%20%28Kentucky%29">Bank of the Commonwealth</a> in 1820. The bank made generous loans and liberally issued paper money. Although bank notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth quickly fell well below par, creditors who refused to accept these devalued notes had to wait two years before seeking <a href="replevin">replevin</a>. To inspire confidence in the devalued notes, Adair mandated that all officers of the state receive their salaries in notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth.

The state's other bank, the Bank of Kentucky, adhered to more conservative banking practices. While this held the value of its notes closer to par, it also rendered loans less available, which angered relief-minded legislators; consequently, they revoked the bank's charter in December 1822. Adair oversaw the abolition of the practice of <a href="Debtors%27%20prison">incarceration for debt</a>, and sanctioned rigorous anti-gambling legislation. Legislators also exempted from forced sale the items then considered necessary for making a living —a horse, a plow, a hoe, and an ax.

The <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a>, then the state's <a href="court%20of%20last%20resort">court of last resort</a>, struck down the law ordering a two-year stay of replevin because it impaired the <a href="Contract%20Clause">obligation of contracts</a>. At about the same time, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> issued its decision in the case of "<a href="Green%20v.%20Biddle">Green v. Biddle</a>", holding that land claims granted by Virginia in the District of Kentucky before Kentucky became a separate state took precedence over those later granted by the state of Kentucky if the two were in conflict. Adair denounced this decision in an 1823 message to the legislature, warning against federal and judicial interference in the will of the people, expressed through the legislature. Emboldened by Adair's message, Relief partisans sought to remove the three justices of the state Court of Appeals, as well as <a href="James%20Clark%20%28Kentucky%29">James Clark</a>, a lower court judge who had issued a similar ruling, from the bench.

Adair urged legislators to create a public school system. In response, the General Assembly passed an act creating a state "Literary Fund" which received half of the clear profits accrued by the Bank of the Commonwealth. The fund was to be available, proportionally, to each of the state's counties for the establishment of "a system of general education". In the tumultuous economic environment, however, legislators routinely voted to borrow from the Literary Fund to pay for other priorities, chiefly the construction of <a href="internal%20improvements">internal improvements</a>.
Adair's <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">lieutenant governor</a>, William T. Barry, and <a href="John%20Pope%20%28Kentucky%29">John Pope</a>, Secretary of State under Adair's predecessor, headed a six-man committee authorized by the act to study the creation of a system of <a href="common%20school">common school</a>s. The "Barry Report," delivered to the legislature in December 1822, was lauded by such luminaries as <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a>, Thomas Jefferson, and <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a>. Authored by committee member <a href="Amos%20Kendall">Amos Kendall</a>, it criticized the idea of land grant academies then prevalent in the state as unworkable outside affluent towns. It also concluded that the Literary Fund alone was insufficient for funding a system of common schools. The report recommended that funds only be made available to counties that imposed a county tax for the benefit of the public school system. Legislators largely ignored the report, a decision Kentucky historian <a href="Thomas%20D.%20Clark">Thomas D. Clark</a> called "one of the most egregious blunders in American educational history".

Adair's endorsement of the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a> was instrumental in securing its passage by Kentucky legislators. He advocated prison reform and better treatment of the insane. He also oversaw the enactment of a plan for internal improvements, including improved navigation on the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a>.

Barred from seeking immediate re-election by the <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">state constitution</a>, Adair retired to his farm in Mercer County at the expiration of his term as governor. Shortly after returning to private life, he began to complain about the low value of Bank of the Commonwealth notes —then worth about half par —and petitioned the legislature to remedy the situation. The complaint of a former Relief Party governor over the ill effects of pro-relief legislation prompted wry celebration among members of the Anti-Relief faction.

Adair made one final contribution to the public when he was elected to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> as a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Jackson Democrat</a> in 1831. During the <a href="22nd%20United%20States%20Congress">22nd Congress</a>, he served on the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">Committee on Military Affairs</a>. During his term, he made only one speech, and it was so inaudible that no one knew what position he was advocating. The House reporter speculated that it concerned mounting Federal troops on horseback. He did not run for re-election in 1833, and left public life for good.

He died at home in <a href="Harrodsburg%2C%20Kentucky">Harrodsburg</a> on May 19, 1840, and was buried on the grounds of his estate, White Hall. In 1872, his remains were moved to the <a href="Frankfort%20Cemetery">Frankfort Cemetery</a>, by the <a href="Old%20State%20Capitol%20%28Kentucky%29">state capitol</a>, and the Commonwealth erected a marker over his grave there.

Battle of Barrosa

The Battle of Barrosa (Chiclana, 5 March 1811, also known as the Battle of Chiclana or Battle of Cerro del Puerco) was part of an unsuccessful manoeuvre to break the <a href="siege%20of%20C%C3%A1diz">siege of Cádiz</a> in Spain during the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a>. During the battle, a single British <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division</a> defeated two French divisions and captured a <a href="French%20Imperial%20Eagle">regimental eagle</a>.

<a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cádiz</a> had been <a href="Investment%20%28military%29">invested</a> by the French in early 1810, leaving it accessible from the sea, but in March of the following year a reduction in the besieging army gave its garrison of British and Spanish troops an opportunity to lift the siege. A large Allied strike force was shipped south from Cádiz to <a href="Tarifa">Tarifa</a>, and moved to engage the siege lines from the rear. The French, under the command of <a href="Claude%20Victor-Perrin%2C%20Duc%20de%20Belluno">Marshal Victor</a>, were aware of the Allied movement and redeployed to prepare a trap. Victor placed one division on the road to Cádiz, blocking the Allied line of march, while his two remaining divisions fell on the single <a href="Anglo-Portuguese%20Army">Anglo-Portuguese</a> rearguard division under the command of <a href="Thomas%20Graham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Lynedoch">Sir Thomas Graham</a>.

Following a fierce battle on two fronts, the British succeeded in routing the attacking French forces. A lack of support from the larger Spanish contingent prevented an absolute victory, and the French were able to regroup and reoccupy their siege lines. Graham's tactical victory proved to have little strategic effect on the continuing war, to the extent that Victor was able to claim the battle as a French victory since the siege remained in force until finally being lifted on 24 August 1812.

In January 1810, the city of Cádiz, a major Allied harbour and the effective seat of Spanish government since the occupation of <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>, was besieged by French troops of <a href="Jean-de-Dieu%20Soult">Marshal Soult</a>'s I <a href="Corps">Corps</a> under the command of <a href="Claude%20Victor-Perrin%2C%20Duc%20de%20Belluno">Marshal Victor</a>. The city's garrison initially comprised only four <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s of volunteers and recruits, but the Duke of <a href="Alburquerque%2C%20Badajoz">Alburquerque</a> ignored orders from the Spanish "<a href="C%C3%A1diz%20Cortes">Junta</a>" and instead of attacking Victor's superior force, he brought his 10,000 men to reinforce the city. This allowed the city's defences to be fully manned.

Under pressure from widespread protests and mob violence the ruling Spanish "Junta" resigned, and a five-man Regency was established to govern in its place. The Regency, recognising that Spain could only be saved with Allied aid, immediately asked the newly ennobled <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Arthur Wellesley, Viscount Wellington</a>, to send reinforcements to Cádiz; by mid-February, five Anglo-Portuguese battalions had landed, bringing the garrison up to 17,000 men and making the city effectively impregnable. Additional troops continued to arrive, and by May, the garrison was 26,000 strong, while the besieging French forces had risen to 25,000.

Although the siege tied up a large number of Spanish, British and Portuguese troops, Wellington accepted this as part of his strategy since a similar number of French troops were also engaged. However, in January 1811, Victor's position began to deteriorate. Soult ordered Victor to send almost a third of his troops to support Soult's assault on <a href="Badajoz">Badajoz</a>, reducing the besieging French army to around 15,000 men. Victor had little chance of making progress against the fortress city with a force of this strength, nor could he withdraw—the garrison of Cádiz, if let loose, was large enough to overrun the whole of <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>.

Following Soult's appropriation of many of Victor's troops, the Allies sensed an opportunity to engage <a href="Marshal%20of%20France">Marshal</a> Victor in open battle and raise the <a href="siege%20of%20C%C3%A1diz">siege of Cádiz</a>. To that end, an Anglo-Spanish expedition was sent by sea from Cádiz south to <a href="Tarifa">Tarifa</a>, with the intention of marching north to engage the French rear. This force comprised some 8,000 Spanish and 4,000 British troops, with the overall command ceded to the Spanish General <a href="Manuel%20la%20Pe%C3%B1a">Manuel la Peña</a>, a political accommodation since he was widely regarded as incompetent. To coincide with la Peña's assault, it was arranged that General <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Pascual%20de%20Zayas%20y%20Chac%C3%B3n">José Pascual de Zayas y Chacón</a> would lead a force of 4,000 Spanish troops in a <a href="wikt%3Asally">sally</a> from Cádiz, via a <a href="pontoon%20%28boat%29">pontoon</a> bridge from the Isla de León.

The Anglo-Portuguese contingent – a division commanded by <a href="Lieutenant-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="Thomas%20Graham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Lynedoch">Sir Thomas Graham</a> – sailed from Cádiz on 21 February 1811, somewhat later than planned. Graham's forces were unable to land at Tarifa due to bad weather and were forced to sail on to <a href="Algeciras">Algeciras</a>, where they disembarked on 23 February. Joined by a composite battalion of flank companies under Colonel Browne, the troops marched to Tarifa on 24 February, where they received a further reinforcement from the fortress garrison there. By 27 February, they were joined by la Peña's Spanish troops, who had left Cádiz three days after Graham and, despite encountering similar weather difficulties, had succeeded in landing at Tarifa.

To further strengthen the Allied ranks, a force of Spanish irregulars under General <a href="Antonio%20Begines%20de%20los%20R%C3%ADos">Antonio Begines de los Ríos</a> had been ordered to come down from the <a href="Ronda">Ronda</a> mountains by 23 February and join the main Anglo-Portuguese and Spanish force. Unaware of the delays in sailing, Begines had advanced as far as <a href="Medina-Sidonia">Medina-Sidonia</a> in search of the Allied army; unsupported, and embroiled in skirmishes with Victor's right flank, he returned to the mountains. General <a href="Louis%20Victorin%20Cassagne">Louis Victorin Cassagne</a>, Victor's flank commander, informed the marshal of the developing threat. Victor responded by sending three infantry battalions and a cavalry <a href="regiment">regiment</a> to reinforce Cassagne, and ordering the fortification of Medina-Sidonia.

Having concentrated, the combined Allied force began marching north towards Medina-Sidonia on 28 February, and la Peña now ordered Beguines's irregulars to join them at <a href="Benalup-Casas%20Viejas">Casas Viejas</a>. Once there, however, Beguines's scouts reported that Medina-Sidonia was held more strongly than had been anticipated. Rather than engaging the French and forcing Victor to weaken his siege by committing more of his troops to the town's defence, la Peña decided that the Allied army should march across country and join the road that ran from Tarifa, through <a href="Vejer%20de%20la%20Frontera">Vejer</a> and <a href="Chiclana%20de%20la%20Frontera">Chiclana</a>, to Cádiz.

This change of plan, combined with further bad weather and la Peña's insistence on marching only at night, meant the Allied force was now two days behind schedule. La Peña sent a message to Cádiz informing Zayas of the delay, but the dispatch was not received and on 3 March, Zayas launched his sally as arranged. A pontoon bridge was floated across the Santi Petri creek and a battalion sent across to establish a <a href="bridgehead">bridgehead</a> prior to the arrival of the main force. Victor could not allow the Cádiz garrison, which still numbered about 13,000 men, to make a sortie against his lines while he was threatened from outside, so on the night of 3–4 March he sent six <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">companies</a> of "<a href="voltigeur">voltigeur</a>s" to storm the bridgehead <a href="fortification">entrenchments</a> and prevent a breakout. Zayas's battalion was ejected from its positions, with 300 Spanish casualties, and Zayas was forced to float the pontoon bridge back to the island for future use.

Marshal Victor had, by now, received intelligence from a <a href="Squadron%20%28army%29">squadron</a> of <a href="dragoon">dragoon</a>s that had been driven out of Vejer, informing him of the strong Anglo-Portuguese and Spanish force making its way up the western road from Tarifa. In conjunction with the aggressive action of the Cádiz garrison, this led him to conclude that the approaching troops were heading for Cádiz; their line of march was therefore predictable, so he prepared a trap. General <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne-Casimir%20Villatte">Eugène-Casimir Villatte</a>'s <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division</a> was sent to block the neck of the peninsula on which the western road ran, preventing access to the Santi Petri creek and the Isla de Léon. Two other divisions, under the commands of Generals <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Amable%20Ruffin">François Amable Ruffin</a> and <a href="Jean%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Leval">Jean François Leval</a>, were ordered to conceal themselves in the thick Chiclana forest in position to attack the flank of the Allies as they engaged Villatte's division.

After another night march, on 5 March the Allies reached a hill to the south east of Barrosa, the Cerro del Puerco (also referred to as the Barrosa Ridge). Scouts reported the presence of Villatte's force, and la Peña ordered his vanguard division to advance. With the aid of a fresh sortie of Zayas's troops from Cádiz, and reinforced by a <a href="brigade">brigade</a> of the <a href="Pedro%20de%20Alc%C3%A1ntara%20T%C3%A9llez-Gir%C3%B3n">Prince of Anglona</a>'s division, the Spanish drove Villatte's force across the Almanza Creek. La Peña refused his vanguard permission to pursue the retreating French, who were consequently able to regroup on the far side of the creek. Graham's Anglo-Portuguese division had remained behind on the Cerro del Puerco to defend the rear and right flank of la Peña's main force.

Having opened up the route to Cádiz, la Peña instructed Graham to move his troops forward to Bermeja. However, on Graham's strenuous objections to vacating a position that would result in both an exposed flank and rear, a force of five Spanish battalions and Browne's battalion was left to hold the Barrosa Ridge. In addition, three Spanish and two <a href="King%27s%20German%20Legion">King's German Legion</a> (KGL) squadrons of cavalry, under the command of Colonel <a href="Samuel%20Ford%20Whittingham">Samuel Whittingham</a>, were sent to flank this rearguard force on the coast track. Graham's division then moved north as ordered—instead of descending from the heights on the coast road, they followed a path through a pine wood to the west of the ridge. This route was shorter and more practical for <a href="artillery">artillery</a>, but the trees restricted visibility in all directions, meaning that they were effectively marching blind.

Victor was disappointed that Villatte had failed to block the Cádiz road for longer, but he was still confident that his main force could drive the Allies into the sea. He could see that the bulk of the Spanish troops had taken station opposite Villatte and, on hearing reports that Barrosa Ridge was deserted, realised that here was an opportunity to take this commanding position. Ruffin was ordered to occupy the heights while Leval struck at Graham's troops in the woods, and three squadrons of dragoons were sent around the Cerro to take the coastal track.

Victor's plan rapidly developed momentum. Ruffin's advance sufficed to send the five rearguard Spanish battalions running, leaving only Browne's battalion defending the ridge and, confronted by the French dragoons, Whittingham's cavalry decided to retire. Whittingham lent a single squadron of KGL <a href="hussar">hussar</a>s to Browne to cover his retreat; Browne initially positioned his battalion in the ruins of a chapel at the summit but, seeing Whittingham's retreat and spotting six French battalions advancing on his position, he had little choice but to give way and seek Graham's force in the woods. Barrosa Ridge fell unopposed as Victor had intended, and Ruffin <a href="wikt%3Aemplace">emplaced</a> a battery of artillery on the heights.

Meanwhile, midway through his march to join la Peña's Spaniards, Graham received news from Spanish "<a href="guerrilleros">guerrilleros</a>" that French soldiers had emerged from the Chiclana forest. Riding to the rear of his marching columns, he witnessed the Spanish battalions retreating from the ridge, Ruffin's division climbing its slopes, and Leval's division approaching from the east. Realizing that the Allied force was in danger of being swamped, Graham disregarded his orders and turned his division to deal with the threats to his flank and rear. He ordered <a href="General%20officer">General</a> Dilkes's brigade to retake the ridge while <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> Wheatley's brigade was sent to see off Leval's force to the east.

Because of the time it took to deploy a full brigade into battle formation, Graham knew he needed to delay the French. He therefore ordered Browne, who had rejoined the division, to turn his single "Flankers" battalion of 536 men around and advance up the slope of the Barrosa Ridge against the 4,000 men and artillery of Ruffin's division. Colonel Barnard, who led the light battalion of Wheatley's brigade, and Colonel Bushe, leading two light companies of Portuguese <a href="skirmisher">skirmisher</a>s, were ordered to attack through the woods to hold up Leval's advance.

Advancing up the ridge they had just abandoned, Browne's battalion came under intense fire from Ruffin's emplaced infantry and artillery. Within a few salvoes, half the battalion was gone and, unable to continue, Browne's men scattered amongst the cover provided by the slope and returned fire. Despite his success, Ruffin could not descend the hill to brush away the remnants of Browne's battalion, as Dilkes's brigade had by now emerged from the wood and was forming up at the base of the slope.

Dilkes, instead of following Browne's route up the slope, advanced to the right where there was more cover and ground not visible to the French. As a result, the French artillery could not be brought to bear, and Dilkes's brigade managed to get near the top of the ridge without suffering serious loss. By this time, though, its formation had become disorganised, so Ruffin deployed four battalion <a href="column%20%28formation%29">columns</a> in an attempt to sweep both Dilkes and the remaining "Flankers" back down the slope. Contrary to French expectations, the crude British <a href="line%20%28formation%29">line</a> stopped the attacking columns in their tracks, and the two forces exchanged fire. Marshal Victor, by then himself on the crest of the ridge, brought up his reserve in two battalion columns of grenadiers. These columns were, as with the previous four, subjected to intense <a href="musket">musket</a> fire and were brought to a halt just metres from the British line. The first four columns had started to give ground, so Victor tried to disengage his reserves and bring them to their support. However, as the two grenadier columns attempted to move off from their stalled positions, they came under additional fire from the remnants of Browne's battalion, which had renewed its own advance. Prevented from rallying, the entire French force broke and fled to the valley below.

While Dilkes was moving on Ruffin's position on Barrosa Ridge, Barnard and the light companies advanced through the woods towards Leval's division. Unaware of the impending British assault, the French had taken no precautions and were advancing in two columns of march, with no forward line of "<a href="voltigeur">voltigeur</a>s". The unexpected appearance of British skirmishers caused such confusion that some French regiments, thinking there were cavalry present, formed <a href="infantry%20square">square</a>. These were prime targets for <a href="Shrapnel%20shell">shrapnel</a> rounds fired by the ten <a href="cannon">cannon</a> under <a href="Major">Major</a> Duncan which, having made rapid progress through the woods, arrived in time to support the skirmish line. As the situation became clearer, the French organised themselves into their customary attacking formation—the 'column of divisions'—all the time under fire from Barnard's light companies and Duncan's artillery. Finally, with the French now in their fighting columns and beginning their advance, Barnard was forced to draw back. Leval's men then encountered Bushe's companies of the 20th Portuguese, who supported the light battalion's retreat and kept the French engaged until Wheatley's brigade had formed up in line on the edge of the woods. The retreating light companies joined Wheatley's troops; Leval's division of 3,800 men was now marching on an Anglo-Portuguese line of 1,400 men supported by cannon.

Although they had the advantage in numbers, the French were under the impression that they were facing a superior force. Having been mauled by Barnard's and Bushe's light companies, and now facing the rolling volleys of the main British line, the French needed time to form from column into line themselves. However, Wheatley attacked as soon as the light companies cleared the field, and only one of Leval's battalions was able to even partially redeploy. The first French column Wheatley engaged broke after a single British volley. The 8th Ligne, part of this column, suffered about 50 percent casualties and lost its <a href="French%20Imperial%20Eagle">eagle</a>. The capture of the eagle—the first to be won in battle by British forces in the Peninsular wars—cost <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">Ensign</a> Keogh of the <a href="87th%20%28Royal%20Irish%20Fusiliers%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">87th</a> his life and was finally secured by <a href="Sergeant">Sergeant</a> Patrick Masterson (or Masterman, depending on source). As Wheatley's brigade moved forward, it encountered the only French battalion, from the 54th Ligne, that had begun to form line. It took three charges to break this battalion, which eventually fled towards the right where it encountered the remainder of Leval's fleeing division.

Ruffin's and Leval's divisions fled towards the Laguna del Puerco, where Victor succeeded in halting their disorganised rout. The Marshal deployed two or three relatively unscathed battalions to cover the reorganisation of his forces and secure their retreat, but Graham had also managed to call his exhausted men to order and he brought them, with Duncan's artillery, against Victor's new position. Morale in the re-formed French ranks was fragile; when a squadron of KGL hussars rounded the Cerro and drove a squadron of French dragoons onto their infantry, the shock was too much to bear for the demoralised soldiers, who retreated in a sudden rush.

Throughout the battle, la Peña steadfastly refused to support his Anglo-Portuguese allies. He learnt of the French advance at about the same time as Graham, and decided to entrench his full force on the <a href="isthmus">isthmus</a> defending the approach to the Isla de Léon. Learning of Graham's decision to engage the two French divisions, the Spanish commander was convinced that the French would win the day and so stayed in place; Zayas repeatedly asked for leave to go to Graham's support, but le Peña denied permission each time. On hearing that the British had prevailed, la Peña further declined to pursue the retreating French, again over-riding the continued protestations of Zayas.

Furious at la Peña, the following morning Graham collected his wounded, gathered trophies from the field and marched into Cádiz; snubbed, la Peña would later accuse Graham of losing the campaign for the Allies. It is almost certain that, had the Allies pushed the French positions either immediately after the battle or on the morning of 6 March, the siege would have been broken. Even though Victor had managed to rally his troops at Chiclana, panic was rife in the French lines. Fully expecting a renewed offensive, Victor had made plans to stall any Allied advance just long enough to blow up most of the besieging forts and to allow I Corps to retreat to Seville. Cassagne took temporary control of Villatte's division, since that general was wounded. Victor assigned Cassagne to command the <a href="rearguard">rearguard</a> and instructed him not to retreat until the Allies advanced. Such was the French discomposure that, despite the Allied inactivity, one battery was destroyed without any orders being given.

La Peña had determined not to heed plans from Graham and Admiral <a href="Richard%20Goodwin%20Keats">Keats</a> to make a cautious advance against the French at Chiclana, and he even refused to send out cavalry scouts to find out what Victor was doing. After remaining entrenched at Bermeja during 5–6 March, the Spanish army crossed to the Isla de León the following day, leaving only Beguines's irregulars on the mainland. This force did manage to briefly secure Medina-Sidonia, but then returned to the Ronda mountains. Cassagne's division remained in place since the Allies never threatened it. To Victor's amazement, a cavalry patrol on 7 March found no evidence of Allied forces. By 8 March, just three days after the battle, Victor had reoccupied even the evacuated southern section of his lines and the siege was back in place. It would remain so for another eighteen months, until finally being abandoned on 24 August 1812, when Soult ordered a general French retreat following the Allied victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Salamanca">Salamanca</a>.

Despite the conduct of their commanding general, both the Spanish success at Almanza Creek and Graham's actions at Barrosa Ridge gave a much needed boost to Spanish morale. La Peña was subsequently arraigned for <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>, mainly for his refusal to pursue the retreating French, where he was acquitted but relieved of command. At a time when Anglo-Spanish relations were already strained, Graham's criticism of his Spanish allies meant that it was no longer <a href="wikt%3Apolitic">politic</a> for him to remain in Cádiz, so he was transferred to Wellington's main army.

Both tactically and in terms of the casualties inflicted, the battle was a British victory. Graham's troops had beaten a French force approaching twice their number despite having marched through the previous night and part of that day. The British lost approximately 1,240 men, including Portuguese and German contingents under Graham's command, while Victor lost around 2,380. The Spanish suffered 300–400 casualties. Strategically, however, the failure of the Allies to follow up their victory allowed Victor to reoccupy his siege lines; Cádiz was not relieved and the campaign effectively failed to achieve anything. Victor even claimed the battle as a French victory, since the positions of the opposing sides remained unchanged following the action.

In November 1811, the British <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prince Regent</a> commanded that a medal be struck to commemorate the "brilliant Victory obtained over the Enemy"; this was awarded to the senior British officers present at the battle.

Four <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> ships <a href="HMS%20Barossa">have taken their names</a> from the battle including <a href="HMS%20Barrosa%20%281812%29">HMS "Barrosa" (1812)</a> launched the year after the battle.

Neferirkare Kakai (known in <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> as Nefercherês, Νεφερχέρης) was an <a href="ancient%20Egyptian">ancient Egyptian</a> <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>, the third king of the <a href="Fifth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fifth Dynasty</a>. Neferirkare, the eldest son of <a href="Sahure">Sahure</a> with his consort <a href="Meretnebty">Meretnebty</a>, was known as Ranefer A before he came to the throne. He acceded the day after his father's death and reigned for eight to eleven years, sometime in the early to mid-<a href="25th%20century%20BCE">25th century BCE</a>. He was himself very likely succeeded by his eldest son, born of his queen <a href="Khentkaus%20II">Khentkaus II</a>, the prince Ranefer B who would take the throne as king <a href="Neferefre">Neferefre</a>. Neferirkare fathered another pharaoh, <a href="Nyuserre%20Ini">Nyuserre Ini</a>, who took the throne after Neferefre's short reign and the brief rule of the poorly known <a href="Shepseskare">Shepseskare</a>.

Neferirkare was acknowledged by his contemporaries as a kind and benevolent ruler, intervening in favour of his <a href="courtier">courtier</a>s after a mishap. His rule witnessed a growth in the number of administration and priesthood officials, who used their expanded wealth to build architecturally more sophisticated <a href="mastabas">mastabas</a>, where they recorded their biographies for the first time. Neferirkare was the last pharaoh to significantly modify the standard <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20royal%20titulary">royal titulary</a>, separating the <a href="Nomen%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">nomen</a> or birth name, from the <a href="Prenomen%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">prenomen</a> or throne name. From his reign onwards, the former was written in a cartouche preceded by the "Son of Ra" epithet. His rule witnessed continuing trade relations with <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a> to the south and possibly with <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a> on the <a href="Levant">Levantine coast</a> to the north.

Neferirkare started <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Neferirkare">a pyramid for himself</a> in the royal necropolis of <a href="Abusir">Abusir</a>, called "Ba-Neferirkare" meaning "Neferirkare is a <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20concept%20of%20the%20soul%23B%C3%A2%20%28personality%29">Ba</a>". It was initially planned to be a <a href="step%20pyramid">step pyramid</a>, a form which had not been employed since the days of the <a href="Third%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Third Dynasty</a> circa 120 years earlier. This plan was modified to transform the monument into a true pyramid, the largest in Abusir, which was never completed owing to the death of the king. In addition, Neferirkare built a <a href="Egyptian%20sun%20temple">temple</a> to the sun god <a href="Ra">Ra</a> called "Setibre", that is "Site of the heart of Ra". <a href="Abusir%20Papyri">Ancient sources</a> state that it was the largest one built during the Fifth Dynasty but as of the early 21st century it has not yet been located.

After his death, Neferirkare benefited from a <a href="funerary%20cult">funerary cult</a> taking place in his mortuary temple, which had been completed by his son Nyuserre Ini. This cult seems to have disappeared at the end of the Old Kingdom period, although it might have been revived during the <a href="Twelfth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twelfth Dynasty</a> of the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a>, albeit in a very limited form. In all probability, it was also around this time that the story of the <a href="Papyrus%20Westcar">Papyrus Westcar</a> was first written, a tale where <a href="Userkaf">Userkaf</a>, Sahure and Neferirkare are said to be brothers, the sons of Ra with a woman <a href="Rededjet">Rededjet</a>.

Neferirkare is well attested in sources contemporaneous with his reign. Beyond his pyramid complex, he is mentioned in the tomb of many of his contemporaries such as his vizier <a href="Washptah">Washptah</a>, the courtier Rawer and the priest <a href="Akhethetep%20%28son%20of%20Ptahhotep%29">Akhethetep</a>. Neferirkare also appears in the nearly contemporaneous <a href="Giza%20writing%20board">Giza writing board</a>, a short list grouping six kings from different dynasties dating to the later Fifth or early <a href="Sixth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Sixth Dynasty</a>. The writing board was uncovered in the tomb of a high official named Mesdjerw, who may have composed it for his use in the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20religion%23Afterlife">afterlife</a>.

Neferirkare is attested in two ancient Egyptian king lists, both dating to the <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom</a>. The earliest of these is the <a href="Abydos%20King%20List">Abydos King List</a> written during the reign of <a href="Seti%20I">Seti I</a> (fl. 1290–1279 BCE). There, Neferirkare's <a href="Nomen%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">nomen</a> "Kakai" occupies the 28th entry, in between those of Sahure and Neferefre. During the subsequent reign of <a href="Ramses%20II">Ramses II</a> (fl. 1279–1213 BCE), Neferirkare's <a href="Prenomen%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">prenomen</a> was recorded on the 27th entry of the <a href="Saqqara%20Tablet">Saqqara Tablet</a>, but this time as a successor of Sahure and predecessor of Shepseskare.

Neferirkare was also given an entry on the <a href="Turin%20King%20List">Turin canon</a>, a document dating to the reign of Ramses II as well. Neferirkare's entry is commonly believed to be on the third column-19th row; unfortunately this line has been lost in a large lacuna affecting the papyrus and neither his reign length nor his successor can be ascertained from the surviving fragments. The Egyptologist <a href="Miroslav%20Verner">Miroslav Verner</a> has furthermore proposed that the Turin canon makes a new dynasty start with this entry and thus that Neferirkare would be its founder. The division of the Turin canon list of kings into dynasties is a currently debated. The Egyptologist Jaromír Málek for example sees the divisions between groups of kings occurring in the canon as marking transfers of royal residence rather than the rise and fall of royal dynasties as this term is currently understood, a usage which only began in the Egyptian context with the 3rd-century BCE work of the priest <a href="Manetho">Manetho</a>. Similarly, the Egyptologist Stephan Seidlmeyer, considers the break in the Turin Canon at the end of the Eighth Dynasty to represent the relocation of the royal residence from Memphis to Herakleopolis. The Egyptologist John Baines holds views that are closer to Verner's, believing that the canon was divided into dynasties with totals for the time elapsed given at the end of each, though only few such divisions have survived. Similarly, Professor John Van Seters views the breaks in the canon as divisions between dynasties, but in contrast, states that the criterion for these divisions remains unknown. He speculates that the pattern of dynasties may have been taken from the nine divine kings of the <a href="Ennead">Greater and Lesser Enneads</a>. The Egyptologist <a href="Ian%20Shaw%20%28Egyptologist%29">Ian Shaw</a> believes that the Turin Canon gives some credibility to Manetho's division of dynasties, but considers the king lists to be a form of ancestor worship and not a historical record.
This whole problematic could be mooted in another of Verner's speculations, where he proposed that Neferirkare's entry may have been located on the 20th line rather than the 19th as is usually believed. This would credit Neferirkare with seven years of reign, and would make Sahure the dynasty founder in the hypothesis that the canon records such events. Archaeological evidences have established that the transitions from Userkaf to Sahure and from Sahure to Neferirkare were father–son transitions, so that neither Sahure nor Neferirkare can be dynasty founders in the modern sense of the term.

Neferirkare was mentioned in the "<a href="Aegyptiaca">Aegyptiaca</a>", a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BCE during the reign of <a href="Ptolemy%20II">Ptolemy II</a> (283–246 BCE) by Manetho. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived to this day and it is now known only through later writings by <a href="Sextus%20Julius%20Africanus">Sextus Julius Africanus</a> and <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>. The <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> scholar <a href="George%20Syncellus">George Syncellus</a> reports that Africanus relates that the "Aegyptiaca" mentioned the succession "Sephrês → Nefercherês → Sisirês" for the early Fifth Dynasty. Sephrês, Nefercherês and Sisirês are believed to be the <a href="Hellenization">hellenized</a> forms for Sahure, Neferirkare and Shepseskare, respectively. Thus, Manetho's reconstruction of the Fifth Dynasty is in agreement with the Saqqara tablet. In Africanus' <a href="epitome">epitome</a> of the "Aegyptiaca", Nefercherês is reported to have reigned for 20 years.

Until 2005, the identity of Neferirkare's parents was uncertain. Some <a href="Egyptology">Egyptologists</a>, including <a href="Nicolas%20Grimal">Nicolas Grimal</a>, <a href="William%20C.%20Hayes">William C. Hayes</a>, Hartwig Altenmüller, Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton, viewed him as a son of <a href="Userkaf">Userkaf</a> and <a href="Khentkaus%20I">Khentkaus I</a>, and a brother to his predecessor Sahure. The main impetus behind this theory was the <a href="Papyrus%20Westcar">Papyrus Westcar</a>, an Ancient Egyptian story narrating the rise of the Fifth Dynasty. In it, a magician prophesies <a href="Khufu">Khufu</a> the future demise of his lineage as three brothers, the first three kings of the Fifth Dynasty, will be born of the god <a href="Ra">Ra</a> and a woman named <a href="Rededjet">Rededjet</a>. Egyptologists such as Verner have sought to discern a historical truth in this account, proposing that Sahure and Neferirkare were siblings born of queen <a href="Khentkaus%20I">Khentkaus I</a>.

In 2005, excavations of the causeway leading up to Sahure's pyramid yielded new relief fragments which showed indisputably that pharaoh Sahure and his consort, queen Meretnebty, were Neferirkare's parents. Indeed, these reliefs—discovered by Verner and Tarek El Awady—depict Sahure and Meretnebty together with their two sons Ranefer and Netjerirenre. While both sons are given the title of "king's eldest son", possibly indicating that they were twins, Ranefer is shown closer to Sahure and also given the title of "chief lector-priest", which may reflect that he was born first and thus given higher positions. Since Ranefer is known to have been the name of Neferirkare before he took the throne, as indicated by reliefs from the mortuary temple of Sahure (see below), no doubt subsists as to Neferirkare's <a href="filiation">filiation</a>. Nothing more is known on Netjerirenre, an observation which led Verner and El-Awady to speculate that he could have attempted to seize the throne at the unexpected death of Neferirkare's son and successor Neferefre, who died in his early twenties after two years on the throne. In this conjectural hypothesis, he would be the ephemeral <a href="Shepseskare">Shepseskare</a>. Finally, the same relief as well as another one record a further four sons of Sahure, Khakare, Horemsaf, Raemsaf and Nebankhre but the identity of their mother is unknown, so that they are therefore at least half-brothers to Neferirkare.

As of the early 21st century, the only known queen of Neferirkare is <a href="Khentkaus%20II">Khentkaus II</a>. This is due to the position of her pyramid next to that of Neferirkare as was normal for the consort of a king, as well as her title of "king's wife" and several reliefs representing both of them together. Neferirkare could possibly have had at least one other spouse, as suggested by the presence of a small pyramid next to that of Khentkaus, but this remains conjectural.
Neferirkare and his consort Khentkaus II were, in all likelihood, the parents of prince Ranefer B, the future pharaoh <a href="Neferefre">Neferefre</a>.
This relationship is confirmed by a relief on a limestone slab discovered in a house in the village near Abusir depicting Neferirkare and his wife Khentkaus with "the king's eldest son Ranefer", a name identical with some variants of Neferefre's own. This indicates that, just as for Neferirkare, Ranefer was Neferefre's name when he was still only a <a href="crown%20prince">crown prince</a>, that is, before his accession to the throne.

Neferirkare and Khentkaus II had at least one other child together, the future pharaoh <a href="Nyuserre%20Ini">Nyuserre Ini</a>. Indeed, Neferirkare's consort Khentkaus II is known to have been Nyuserre's mother, since excavations of her mortuary temple yielded a fragmentary relief showing her facing Nyuserre and his family. Remarkably, on this relief both Khentkaus and Nyuserre appear on the same scale, an observation which may be connected with Khentkaus' enhanced status during Nyuserre's reign, as he sought to legitimise his rule following the premature death of Neferefre and the possible challenge by Shepseskare. Further evidence for the filiation of Nyuserre are the location of his pyramid next to that of Neferirkare, as well as his reuse for his own valley temple of materials from Neferikare's unfinished constructions.

Yet another son of Neferirkare and Khentkhaus has been proposed, probably younger than both Neferefre and Nyuserre: Iryenre, a prince "<a href="iry-pat">iry-pat</a>" whose relationship is suggested by the fact that his <a href="funerary%20cult">funerary cult</a> was associated with that of his mother, both having taken place in the temple of Khentkaus II.

Finally, Neferirkare and Khentkaus II may also be the parents of queen <a href="Khentkaus%20III">Khentkaus III</a>, whose tomb was discovered in Abusir in 2015. Indeed, based on the location and general date for her tomb, as well as her titles of "king's wife" and "king's mother", Khentkaus III was almost certainly Neferefre's consort and the mother of either <a href="Menkauhor%20Kaiu">Menkauhor Kaiu</a> or <a href="Shepseskare">Shepseskare</a>.

Manetho's "Aegyptiaca" assigns Neferirkare a reign of 20 years, but the archaeological evidence now suggests that this is an overestimate. First, the damaged <a href="Palermo%20Stone">Palermo Stone</a> preserves "the year of the 5th <a href="cattle%20count">cattle count</a>" for Neferirkare's time on the throne. The cattle count was an important event aimed at evaluating the amount of taxes to be levied on the population. By the reign of Neferirkare, this involved counting cattle, oxen and small livestock. This event is believed to have been biennial during the Old Kingdom period, that is occurring once every two years, meaning that Neferirkare reigned at least ten years. Given the shape of the Palermo stone, this record must correspond to his final year or be close to it, so that he ruled no more than eleven years. This is further substantiated by two cursive inscriptions left by masons on stone blocks from the pyramids of Khentkaus II and Neferirkare, both of which also date to Neferirkare's fifth cattle count, its highest known regnal year. Finally, Verner has pointed out that a 20-year-long reign would be difficult to reconcile with the unfinished state of his pyramid in Abusir.

Beyond his construction of a pyramid and sun temple, little is known of Neferirkare's activities during his time on the throne. Some events dating to his first and final years of reign are recorded on the surviving fragments of the Palermo stone, a royal <a href="annals">annal</a> covering the period from the start of the reign of <a href="Menes">Menes</a> of the <a href="First%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">First Dynasty</a> until around the time of Neferirkare’s rule. According to the Palermo stone, the future pharaoh Neferirkare, then called prince Ranefer, <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20pharaoh">ascended the throne</a> the day after his father Sahure's death, which occurred on the 28th day of <a href="Season%20of%20the%20Harvest">the ninth month</a>.

The annal then records that in his first year as king, Neferirkare granted land to the agricultural estates serving the cults of the Ennead, the <a href="Souls%20of%20Pe%20and%20Nekhen">Souls of Pe and Nekhen</a> and the gods of Keraha. To Ra and <a href="Hathor">Hathor</a>, he dedicated an offering table provided with 210 daily offerings, and ordered the construction of two store rooms and the employment of new dependents in the host temple.
Neferirkare also commanded "the fashioning and <a href="Opening%20of%20the%20mouth%20ceremony">opening of the mouth</a> of an <a href="electrum">electrum</a> statue of [the god] <a href="Ihy">Ihy</a>, escorting [it] to the "mrt"-chapel of <a href="Snefru">Snefru</a> of the "nht"-shrine of Hathor". Later in his reign, in the year of the fifth cattle count, Neferirkare had a bronze statue of himself erected and set up four <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20solar%20ships%23Abusir">barques</a> for Ra and Horus in and around his sun temple, two of which were of copper. The Souls of Pe and Nekhen and <a href="Wadjet">Wadjet</a> received electrum endowments, while <a href="Ptah">Ptah</a> was given lands.

The fact that the Palermo stone terminates around Neferirkare's rule led some scholars, such as Grimal, to propose that they might have been compiled during his reign.

Few specific administrative actions taken by Neferirkare are known. One decree of his inscribed on a limestone slab was excavated in 1903 in <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a> and is now in the <a href="Boston%20Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Boston Museum of Fine Arts</a>. The decree exempts personnel belonging to a temple of <a href="Khenti-Amentiu">Khenti-Amentiu</a> from undertaking compulsory labour in perpetuity, under penalty of forfeiture of all property and freedom and be forced to work the fields or in a stone quarry. This decree indirectly suggests that taxation and compulsory labour was imposed on everybody as a general rule.

More generally, Neferirkare's reign saw the growth of the Egyptian administration and priesthood, which amassed more power than in earlier reigns, although the king remained a living god. In particular the positions of viziers and overseer of the expedition, that is the highest offices, were opened to people from outside the royal family.
In conjunction with this trend, the <a href="mastabas">mastabas</a> of high officials started to become more elaborate, with, for example, chapels including multiple rooms, and from the mid to late Fifth Dynasty, wide entrance porticoes with columns and family tomb complexes. It is also at this time that these officials started to record <a href="autobiographies">autobiographies</a> on the walls of their tombs.

The reign of Neferirkare Kakai saw the last important modification to the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20royal%20titulary">titulary of pharaohs</a>. He was the earliest pharaoh to separate the "nswt-bjtj" ("King of Upper and Lower Egypt") and "S3-Rˁ" ("Son of Ra") epithets of the royal titulary. He associated these two epithets with two different, independent names: the <a href="Prenomen%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">prenomen</a> and <a href="Nomen%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">nomen</a>, respectively. The prenomen or throne name, taken by the new king as he ascended the throne, was written in a cartouche immediately after the bee and sedge signs for "nswt-bjtj". From Neferirkare's time onwards, the nomen, or birth name, was also written in cartouche systematically preceded by the mention of "Son of Ra", an epithet which had seen little use in preceding times.

There is little evidence for military action during Neferirkare's reign. <a href="William%20C.%20Hayes">William C. Hayes</a> proposed that a few fragmentary limestone statues of kneeling and bound prisoners of war discovered in his mortuary temple possibly attest to punitive raids in Libya to the west or the <a href="Sinai">Sinai</a> and <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a> to the east during his reign. The art historian William Stevenson Smith commented that such statues were customary elements of the decoration of royal temples and mastabas, suggesting that they may not be immediately related to actual military campaigns. Similar statues and small wooden figures of kneeling captives were discovered in the mortuary complexes of Neferefre, <a href="Djedkare%20Isesi">Djedkare Isesi</a>, <a href="Unas">Unas</a>, <a href="Teti">Teti</a>, <a href="Pepi%20I">Pepi I</a> and <a href="Pepi%20II">Pepi II</a> as well as in the tomb of vizier <a href="Senedjemib%20Mehi">Senedjemib Mehi</a>.

Trade relations with <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a> are the only ones attested to during Neferirkare's reign. The archaeological evidence for this are seal impressions and <a href="ostracon">ostracon</a> bearing his name uncovered in the fortress of <a href="Buhen">Buhen</a>, on the <a href="Cataracts%20of%20the%20Nile">second cataract</a> of the Nile. Contacts with <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a> on the <a href="Levant">Levantine coast</a> might also have happened during Neferirkare's rule, as suggested by a single alabaster bowl inscribed with his name unearthed there.

Neferirkare's reign was unusual for the significant number of surviving contemporary records which describe him as a kind and gentle ruler. When <a href="Rawer%20%285th%20Dynasty%29">Rawer</a>, an elderly nobleman and royal courtier, was accidentally touched by the king's mace during a religious ceremony—a dangerous situation which could have caused this official to be put immediately to death or banished from court since the pharaoh was viewed as a living god in <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a> mythology—Neferirkare quickly pardoned Rawer and commanded that no harm should occur to the latter for the incident. As Rawer gratefully states in an inscription from his <a href="Giza">Giza</a> tomb:

Similarly, Neferirkare gave the Priest of Ptah <a href="Ptahshepses">Ptahshepses</a> the unprecedented honour of kissing his feet rather than the ground in front of him. Finally, when the vizier <a href="Washptah">Washptah</a> suffered a stroke while attending court, the king quickly summoned the palace's chief doctors to treat his dying vizier. When Weshptah died, Neferirkare was reportedly inconsolable and retired to his personal quarters to mourn the loss of his friend. The king then ordered the purification of Weshptah's body in his presence and ordered an ebony coffin made for the deceased vizier. Weshptah was buried with special endowments and rituals courtesy of Neferirkare. The records of the king's actions are inscribed in Weshptah's tomb itself and emphasize Neferirkare's humanity towards his subjects.

The <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Neferirkare%20Kakai">Pyramid of Neferirkare Kakai</a>, known to the Ancient Egyptians as "Ba-Neferirkare" and variously translated as "Neferirkare is a <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20concept%20of%20the%20soul%23B%C3%A2%20%28personality%29">Ba</a>" or "Neferirkare takes form", is located in the royal necropolis of Abusir. It is the largest one built during the Fifth Dynasty, equalling roughly the size of the <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Menkaure">Pyramid of Menkaure</a>.

The pyramid construction comprised three stages: first built were six steps of rubble, their retaining walls made of locally quarried limestone indicating that the monument was originally planned to be a <a href="step%20pyramid">step pyramid</a>, an unusual design for the time which had not been used since the <a href="Third%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Third Dynasty</a>, some 120 years earlier. At this point the pyramid, had it been completed, would have reached . This plan was then altered by a second construction stage with the addition of filling between the steps meant to transform the monument into a true pyramid. At a later stage, the workers enlarged the pyramid further, adding a girdle of masonry and smooth casing stones of red granite. This work was never finished, even after the works implemented by Nyuserre.
With a square base of sides, the pyramid would have reached high had it been completed. Today it is in ruins owing to extensive stone robbing. The entrance to the pyramid's substructures was located on its north side. There, a descending corridor with a <a href="gable%20roof">gable roof</a> made of limestone beams led into a burial chamber. No pieces of the sarcophagus of the king were found there.

The pyramid of Neferirkare is surrounded by smaller pyramids and tombs which seem to form an architectural unit, the cemetery of his close family. This ensemble was meant to be reached from the Nile via a causeway and a valley temple near the river. At the death of Neferirkare, only the foundations of both had been laid and Nyuserre later diverted the unfinished causeway to his <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Nyuserre">own pyramid</a>.

The mortuary temple was far from finished at the death of Neferirkare but it was completed later, by his sons Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini using cheap <a href="mudbrick">mudbrick</a>s and wood rather than stone. A significant cache of administrative papyri, known as the <a href="Abusir%20Papyri">Abusir papyri</a>, was uncovered there by illegal diggers in 1893 and subsequently by Borchardt in 1903. Further papyri were also uncovered in the mid-seventies during a <a href="Charles%20University%20in%20Prague">University of Prague</a> Egyptological Institute excavation. The presence of this cache is due to the peculiar historical circumstances of the mid-Fifth Dynasty.
As both Neferirkare and his heir Neferefre died before their pyramid complexes could be finished, Nyuserre altered their planned layout, diverting the causeway leading to Neferirkare's pyramid to his own. This meant that Neferefre's and Neferirkare's mortuary complexes became somewhat isolated on the Abusir plateau, their priests therefore had to live next to the temple premises in makeshift dwellings, and they stored the administrative records onsite. In contrast, the records of other temples were kept in the pyramid town close to Sahure's or Nyuserre's pyramid, where the current level of ground water means any papyrus has long since disappeared.

The Abusir papyri record some details pertaining to Neferirkare's mortuary temple. Its central chapel housed a niche with five statues of the king. The central one is described in the papyri as being a representation of the king as <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a>, while the first and last ones depicted him as the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, respectively. The temple also comprised store-rooms for the offerings, where numerous stone vessels—now broken—had been deposited. Finally the papyri indicate that of the four boats included in the mortuary complex, two were buried to the north and south of the pyramid, one of which was unearthed by Verner.

During the <a href="Late%20Period%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">Late Period of ancient Egypt</a> (664–332 BCE) the mortuary temple of Neferirkare was used as a secondary cemetery. A gravestone made of yellow <a href="calcite">calcite</a> was discovered by Borchardt bearing an <a href="Aramaic%20language">Aramaic</a> inscription reading "Belonging to Nesneu, son of Tapakhnum". Another inscription in Aramaic found on a limestone block and dating to the <a href="5th%20century%20BC">fifth century BCE</a> reads "Mannukinaan son of Sewa".

Neferirkare is known from ancient sources to have built a temple to the sun god Ra, which is yet to be identified archaeologically. It was called "Setibre", meaning "Site of the heart of Ra", and was, according to contemporary sources, the largest one built during the Fifth Dynasty. It is possible that the temple was only built out of mudbricks, with a planned completion in stone which had not started when Neferirkare died. In this case, it would rapidly have turned into ruins that would be very difficult to locate for archaeologists. Alternatively, the Egyptologist <a href="Rainer%20Stadelmann">Rainer Stadelmann</a> has proposed that the "Setibre" as well as the sun temples of Sahure and Userkaf were one and the same known building, <a href="Sun%20temple%20of%20Userkaf">that attributed to Userkaf</a> in Abusir.

Of all the sun temples built during the Fifth Dynasty, the "Setibre" is the one most commonly cited in ancient sources. Due to this, some details of its layout are known: it had a large central obelisk, an altar and store-rooms, a sealed barque room housing two boats and a "hall of the '<a href="Sed%20festival">Sed festival</a>. Religious festivals did certainly take place in sun temples, as is attested to by the Abusir papyri. In the case of the "Setibre", the festival of the "Night of Ra" is specifically said to have taken place there. This was a festival concerned with Ra's journey during the night and connected with the ideas of renewal and rebirth that were central to sun temples.

The temple played an important role in the distribution of food offerings which were brought everyday from there to the mortuary temple of the king. This journey was made by boat, indicating that the "Setibre" was not adjacent to Neferirkare's pyramid. This also underscores the dependent position of the king with respect to Ra, as offerings were made to the sun god and then to the deceased king.

The Egyptologist Werner Kaiser proposed, based on a study of the evolution of the hieroglyph determinative for "sun temple", that Neferirkare completed the sun temple of Userkaf—known in Ancient Egyptian as "Nekhenre"—sometime around the fifth cattle count of his reign. This opinion is shared by the Egyptologists and archaeologists Ogden Goelet, <a href="Mark%20Lehner">Mark Lehner</a> and <a href="Herbert%20Ricke">Herbert Ricke</a>. In this hypothesis, Neferirkare would have provided the "Nekhenre" with its monumental obelisk of limestone and red granite.
Verner and the Egyptologist <a href="Paule%20Posener-Kri%C3%A9ger">Paule Posener-Kriéger</a> have pointed out two difficulties with the hypothesis. Firstly, it would imply a long interlude between the two phases of construction of Userkaf's temple: nearly 25 years between the erection of the temple and that of its obelisk. Secondly, they observe that both the pyramid and sun temple of Neferirkare were unfinished at his death, raising the question as to why the king would have devoted exceptional effort on a monument of Userkaf when his own still required substantial works to be completed. Instead, Verner proposes that it was Sahure who finished the "Nekhenre".

As with the other pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty, Neferirkare was the object of a funerary cult after his death. Cylinder seals belonging to priests and priestesses serving in this cult attest his existence during the <a href="Old%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Old Kingdom period</a>.
For example, a black steatite seal, now in the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum">Metropolitan Museum</a> bears the inscription "<a href="wikt%3Avotary">Votary</a> of <a href="Hathor">Hathor</a> and priestess of the good god Neferirkare, beloved of the gods". Some of these officials had roles in the cults of several kings, as well as in their sun temples.
Offerings for the funerary cult of deceased rulers were provided by dedicated agricultural estates set up during the king's reign. A few of these are known for Neferirkare, including "The estate of Kakai (named) the "i3gt" of Kakai", "Strong is the power of Kakai", "The plantations of Kakai", "<a href="Nekhbet">Nekhbet</a> desires that Kakai lives", "Neferirkare is beloved of the ennead" and "The mansion of the Ba of Neferirkare".

Traces of the continued existence of the funerary cult of Neferirkare beyond the Old Kingdom period are scant. A pair of statues belonging to a certain Sekhemhotep were uncovered in Giza, one of which is inscribed with the standard <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20offering%20formula">Ancient Egyptian offering formula</a> followed by "of the temple of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Neferirkare, <a href="Maat%20Kheru">true of voice</a>". The statues, which date to the early 12th Dynasty of the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom period</a> are the only archaeological evidences that Neferirkare's funerary cult still existed or had been revived around Abusir at the time, albeit in a very limited form.

Hurricane Carol

Hurricane Carol was among the worst <a href="tropical%20cyclones">tropical cyclones</a> on record to affect the states of <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> and <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a> in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. It developed from a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> near the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> on August 25, 1954, and slowly strengthened as it moved northwestward. On August 27, Carol intensified to reach winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), but weakened as its motion turned to a northwest drift. A strong <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> of low pressure turned the hurricane northeastward, and Carol later intensified into a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20scales">major hurricane</a>. While paralleling the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic</a> and <a href="Southeastern%20United%20States">Southeastern United States</a>, the storm produced strong winds and rough seas that caused minor coastal flooding and slight damage to houses in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>, and <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>. The well-organized hurricane accelerated north-northeastward and made landfall on eastern <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, and then over eastern <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> on August 31 with sustained winds estimated at 110-mph and a barometric pressure near 956 mb. Carol later transitioned into an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> over <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, on August 31, 1954.

In New York, strong winds on Long Island damaged about 1,000 houses, left 275,000 people without electricity, downed many trees, and resulted in heavy crop losses. Storm surge flooded <a href="LaGuardia%20Airport">LaGuardia Airport</a> and inundated the <a href="Montauk%20Highway">Montauk Highway</a>, which left the eastern portion of Long Island isolated. Carol also brought strong winds and rough seas to coastal Connecticut, Rhode Island, and southeastern Massachusetts. Throughout the region, about 150,000 people were left without electricity and telephone service. 1,545 houses were destroyed and another 9,720 were damaged. Approximately 3,500 cars and 3,000 boats were destroyed. There were 65 deaths and 1,000 injuries in New England. The storm caused an additional $1 million in damage in Canada as well as two deaths. Overall, Carol caused 72 fatalities and damage totaled $462 million (1954 <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>), making it the <a href="List%20of%20costliest%20Atlantic%20hurricanes">costliest</a> hurricane in the history of the United States, at the time. Following the storm, Carol was <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20names">retired</a>, becoming the first name to be removed from the naming lists in the Atlantic basin.

A <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> spawned a tropical depression over the northeastern <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> on August 25. It moved to the north-northwest and intensified into a tropical storm early on August 26. Receiving the name Carol, the storm gradually turned to the north, and strengthened under generally favorable conditions. On August 26, the <a href="Hurricane%20Hunters">Hurricane Hunters</a> reported an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a>, in diameter despite Carol being a tropical storm. The next day, Carol strengthened to attain hurricane status while located about 345 miles (545 km) east of <a href="Cape%20Canaveral">Cape Canaveral</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. With a large <a href="anticyclone">anticyclone</a> persisting across the southeastern United States, the motion of Carol turned to a northwest drift. The hurricane continued to strengthen, and Carol reached an initial peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h) on August 28. By that time, it was a small hurricane, and the <a href="radius%20of%20maximum%20wind">radius of maximum wind</a>s was smaller than normal for its latitude and central pressure. After maintaining peak intensity for 30 hours and moving a distance of about 75 miles (120 km), Carol weakened slightly off the coast of <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>.

An eastward moving deep-wave <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> intensified as it moved through the eastern <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. This caused Carol to accelerate as it turned to the north and north-northeast. On August 30, the hurricane again strengthened to reach <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">Category 2</a> status while located 180 miles (290 km) east of <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah, Georgia</a>. Early on August 31, Carol passed very near <a href="Cape%20Hatteras">Cape Hatteras</a>, North Carolina with reconnaissance aircraft intensity estimates from 75–125 mph (120–200 km/h). The hurricane continued north-northeastward with a forward motion of up to 39 mph (63 km/h), and Carol intensified further to make landfall on eastern Long Island a Category 3 hurricane with peak winds of 111 mph (185 km/h). After quickly crossing <a href="Long%20Island%20Sound">Long Island Sound</a>, the hurricane made landfall again near <a href="Groton%2C%20Connecticut">Groton, Connecticut</a>. Carol had maintained its small structure and well-defined eye, and observers on both eastern Long Island and Groton, Connecticut reported blue skies and light winds as the eye passed overhead, followed by strong hurricane force winds. The landfall intensity was based on a pressure of recorded in <a href="Groton%2C%20Connecticut">Groton, Connecticut</a>. Ninety percent of homes in the Groton Long Point area were destroyed by the storm surge and winds in Hurricane Carol. Carol quickly lost tropical characteristics while crossing into inland eastern <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, and became extratropical over southwestern <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, late on August 31. The powerful extratropical storm continued northward, before losing its identity after entering <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, over southern <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>.

Before affecting North Carolina, the threat of Carol prompted a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches">hurricane warning</a> from <a href="Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilmington</a> to <a href="Manteo%2C%20North%20Carolina">Manteo</a>. Storm warnings were issued southward to <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a>. Residents evacuated north of Wilmington along the ocean. While passing by the state, the strongest winds remained to the east of Hurricane Carol, though winds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 160 km/h) were reported at Cape Hatteras. Further inland, the hurricane produced a wind gust of 55 mph (90 km/h) in Wilmington and 65 mph (105 km/h) in <a href="Cherry%20Point%2C%20North%20Carolina">Cherry Point</a>. The winds resulted in agricultural damage to the corn and soy bean crop. High winds caused minor damage to roofs and houses, and also downed some trees and power lines. Near the coast, waves from the storm damaged fishing piers, and flooding was reported in <a href="New%20Bern%2C%20North%20Carolina">New Bern</a>. High waves also damaged coastal roadways. Damage in the state totaled to around $228,000. Carol passed 100 miles (160 km) to the east of Virginia, and produced 40 mph (65 km/h) winds in <a href="Virginia%20Beach%2C%20Virginia">Virginia Beach</a>. The hurricane produced 4 inches (100 mm) of rain in <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk</a>. Further to the northwest, rainfall from the system alleviated drought conditions in the Washington, D.C. area. Damage was minor from Virginia to Delaware, where light rains fell. Precipitation also extended into Pennsylvania.

In New Jersey, high winds downed power lines, which killed two people. Along the coast, high waves damaged boardwalks and caused flooding. In neighboring Pennsylvania, Carol caused a tractor to crash into a train, resulting in two deaths. Damage in the state was estimated at $250,000.

On eastern Long Island near where Carol made landfall, a pressure of was recorded. Winds on the island gusted to , leaving thousands of homes without power. The winds downed many trees, and left heavy crop damage to various fruits. High winds damaged widespread homes, boats, and cars. About 1,000 houses were damaged on the island, and 275,000 people lost power. The hurricane's storm surge covered the <a href="Montauk%20Highway">Montauk Highway</a> in <a href="Montauk%2C%20New%20York">Montauk</a>, effectively isolating eastern Long Island for a period of time. Flooding also affected <a href="LaGuardia%20Airport">LaGuardia Airport</a>. Due to the compact nature of the storm, areas west of <a href="Fire%20Island">Fire Island</a> were largely unaffected by the hurricane. There were power outages in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, but little damage. Damage was estimated at $5 million in the state, and one death was reported, after thousands of people evacuated.

Hurricane Carol produced hurricane and gale force winds across New England. Strong winds from Hurricane Carol destroyed nearly 40% of the apple, corn, peach, and tomato crops from eastern Connecticut to Cape Cod. Overall crop damage was estimated at $22.25 million. The hurricane destroyed several thousand homes in New England, many of which were destroyed from the waters or the powerful winds. Overall, 11,785 families were directly impacted by the hurricane, including 9,720 houses that were damaged and 1,545 that were destroyed. High winds left over 150,000 people without power in New England, potentially as many as one-third of all of New England, and many residents also lost phone service. The hurricane also destroyed 3,500 cars and 3,000 boats in the region. Heavy rainfall from the storm caused traffic accidents, but only minor flooding.

Throughout the United States, Hurricane Carol caused $461 million in damage, mostly in New England, making it the costliest Atlantic hurricane at the time. There were 65 deaths in New England, and about 1,000 injured people. Despite the high damage, advance warning allowed for many fewer deaths than the total of 488 fatalities during the <a href="1938%20New%20England%20hurricane">1938 New England hurricane</a>, which affected the same area with similar strength. However, some areas did not receive advance warning, due to power outages preventing people from receiving <a href="United%20States%20Weather%20Bureau">Weather Bureau</a> warnings ahead of the storm.

Hurricane Carol struck <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> shortly after <a href="tide">high tide</a>, and its combination with 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.5 m) <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a>s from <a href="New%20London%2C%20Connecticut">New London</a> eastward produced widespread tidal flooding. About 2,000 people were stranded when a rail line between <a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut">New Haven</a> and Rhode Island was flooded. The heaviest rainfall associated with the passage of the storm occurred in New London, where up to 6 inches (150 mm) fell and wind blew off a portion of the <a href="city%20hall">city hall</a> roof. These strong winds left much of the eastern portion of the state without power. Near the coast, the combination of strong winds and the storm surge damaged or destroyed thousands of buildings, including 100 destroyed houses. Many other homes in Eastern Connecticut were damaged by falling trees. Thousands had evacuated before the storm reached the area, and one person died in the state. Due to the compact nature of the storm, western Connecticut experienced little effects from Carol. Overall damage in the state was estimated at $50 million.

The hurricane produced a record-high wind gust of 135 mph (215 km/h) at <a href="Block%20Island">Block Island</a>, while on mainland <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>, sustained winds peaked at 90 mph (145 km/h) in <a href="Warwick%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Warwick</a> with gusts to 105 mph (165 km/h). Upon making landfall around high tide, Carol produced a storm surge of up to 14.4 feet (4.4 m) in <a href="Narragansett%20Bay">Narragansett Bay</a>, surpassing that of the New England Hurricane of 1938. The resulting storm surge flooded downtown <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence</a> with 12 feet (3.7 m) of water. News reports indicated that the floods covered the area with in about an hour. The winds downed two broadcasting towers in the city. <a href="Westerly%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Westerly</a> was also flooded, where 200 homes were washed away. There was also heavy damage in <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport</a>, where the <a href="Newport%20Casino">Newport Casino</a> was damaged. Some entire coastal communities were nearly destroyed, and 620 houses and 83 other buildings were destroyed in the state. The winds destroyed the roofs of hundreds of buildings, forcing many to evacuate to shelters during the passage of the storm. The powerful winds also downed thousands of trees and power lines, <a href="power%20outage">blacking out</a> the entire state and interrupting 95 percent of phone service. Damage in the state totaled about $200 million, and there were at least 17 deaths in Rhode Island.
Before Carol affected the area, 20,000 people evacuated from <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a>. In Massachusetts, the hurricane produced winds between 80 and 110 mph (130 to 180 km/h) across much of the eastern part of the state. Gusts reached at <a href="Blue%20Hill%20Meteorological%20Observatory">Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory</a>, and the highest gusts in the state were around . The winds downed about 50 million <a href="Board%20foot">board feet</a> of trees in the state, many of which fell onto power lines; much of eastern Massachusetts lost power during the storm. Carol left about $15 million in crop damage in the state. The winds destroyed much of the corn crop, about half of the peach crop, and about 1.5 million <a href="bushel">bushel</a>s of apples. 

Heavy damage was reported throughout Boston, where high winds destroyed the spire of the <a href="Old%20North%20Church">Old North Church</a>, the location of the hung lanterns during <a href="Paul%20Revere">Paul Revere</a>'s <a href="Paul%20Revere%27s%20Ride">ride</a>. It was a replacement spire, after a <a href="Snow%20Hurricane%20of%201804">hurricane in 1804</a> destroyed the original. In <a href="Wareham%2C%20Massachusetts">Wareham</a>, about 1,500 people were left homeless. Statewide, 3,350 homes were damaged to some degree, and another 800 were destroyed. The hurricane destroyed another 213 buildings and severely damaged. Near the coast, strong storm surges were reported, and a storm tide was reported at <a href="New%20Bedford%2C%20Massachusetts">New Bedford</a>, setting a record. At least 15 deaths were reported in the state, and damage was estimated at $175 million. 

In <a href="Dedham%2C%20Massachusetts">Dedham, Massachusetts</a>, the hurricane knocked down the 80 foot bell tower on the East Dedham firehouse, today the oldest wooden firehouse in the country. The tower flew across the station and landed on 219 Bussey St, the house next door, where Louise Guerrio was feeding her one year old son, Joseph. It also crushed three cars parked on Bussey St.

Carol maintained its intensity as it moved inland, and its winds were strong enough to knock down trees and power lines in New Hampshire. One tree fell onto a car, killing a person, and there were three deaths overall in the state, along with $3 million in damage. There was also a death in neighboring Vermont. Carol produced winds of up to 80 mph (130 km/h) in <a href="Augusta%2C%20Maine">Augusta, Maine</a>. Throughout the state, the winds downed hundreds of trees, some of which damaged houses, wrecked cars, destroyed one building, or fell onto power lines. Fallen trees blocked highways, and one person was injured by a falling tree limb. Downed power lines left several counties without power or telephone services. The winds flattened hundreds of acres of corn in <a href="Livermore%2C%20Maine">North Livermore</a>, and throughout the state, there was heavy damage to the apple crop. Damage to the apple crop amounted to $1.7 million. While moving west of Maine, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, including a report of 2.15 inches (63 mm) in 12 hours. Along the coast, high waves damaged boats. In Maine, the hurricane killed three people, injured at least eight, and caused $10 million in damage, the costliest natural disaster in the state's history. Carol lost this distinction 10 days later when <a href="Hurricane%20Edna">Hurricane Edna</a> caused $15 million in damage in the state.

Rainfall in Canada peaked at 4.27 inches (108 mm) in Quebec. In <a href="Yarmouth%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Yarmouth, Nova Scotia</a>, wind gusts peaked at 47 mph (75 km/h). In Quebec, the extratropical remnants of Carol downed trees and power lines in Montreal from wind gusts as high as . Widespread power outages were reported in New Brunswick and Quebec, and downed trees struck three cars in <a href="Saint%20John%2C%20New%20Brunswick">Saint John, New Brunswick</a>. The storm caused flights to be canceled, and subways were flooded in Montreal. Damage there totaled about $1 million (1954 <a href="Canadian%20dollar">CAD</a>, $980,000 USD). Two people were killed, one of whom due to drowning on a sunken barge in <a href="Quebec%20City">Quebec City</a>.

<a href="Governor%20of%20Rhode%20Island">Governor of Rhode Island</a> <a href="Dennis%20J.%20Roberts">Dennis J. Roberts</a> declared <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a> for the state after Carol caused heavy damage. In Massachusetts, the <a href="Massachusetts%20National%20Guard">National Guard</a> were deployed to six towns to prevent looting. National Guardsmen flew a plane of <a href="dry%20ice">dry ice</a> from <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark, New Jersey</a> to Boston to assist the widespread areas without power and refrigeration. Widespread areas were without power for days, and in some areas for up to a week, until crews could repair downed lines. Spoiled food due to lack of refrigeration resulted in about $1 million in losses. Power crews from elsewhere in the United States arrived to assist in the restoration. Workers quickly removed trees from highways. Damaged factories in Rhode Island prevented employees from working for three weeks after the storm. The steeple of the Old North Church in Boston was rebuilt in 1955, after residents throughout the country provided $150,000 in donations. <a href="Governor%20of%20Maine">Governor of Maine</a> <a href="Burton%20M.%20Cross">Burton M. Cross</a> declared a state of emergency for the state. The Small Business Administration declared six counties in Maine as disaster areas. In the days after the storm, <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a> <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a> declared Massachusetts and Rhode Island as federal disaster areas. The federal government provided financial aid, amounting to $1.5 million in Massachusetts. The president ordered for troops to assist in the aftermath. The <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">American Red Cross</a> quickly deployed teams to the most affected areas, feeding hundreds of families. About 12 days after Carol struck New England, Hurricane Edna struck eastern Massachusetts, causing an additional $40 million in damage and 20 deaths. More disaster aid was provided after the second hurricane.

The high damage caused by Hurricane Carol and other hurricanes in 1954 prompted the United States government to devote research to set up the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Research%20Project">National Hurricane Research Project</a>. Hurricane Hunters and the Weather Bureau collected data on subsequent hurricanes to determine their structure, as well as attempted to weaken storms with <a href="silver%20iodide">silver iodide</a> via <a href="Project%20Stormfury">Project Stormfury</a>.

Due to the high damage, the name Carol was removed from the naming list for 10 years. The name was reused in the <a href="1965%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1965 season</a>, but was retroactively retired, and it will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. Carol was the first Atlantic hurricane name in history to be retired.

Menkauhor Kaiu

Menkauhor Kaiu (also known as Ikauhor and in <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> as Mencherês, Μεγχερῆς) was an <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>ian <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a> of the <a href="Old%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Old Kingdom</a> period. He was the seventh ruler of the <a href="Fifth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fifth Dynasty</a> at the end of the <a href="25th%20century%20BC">25th century BC</a> or early in the <a href="24th%20century%20BC">24th century BC</a>.

Menkauhor ruled for possibly eight or nine years, following king <a href="Nyuserre%20Ini">Nyuserre Ini</a>, and was succeeded in turn by <a href="Djedkare%20Isesi">Djedkare Isesi</a>. Although Menkauhor is well attested by historical sources, few artifacts from his reign have survived. Consequently, his familial relation to his predecessor and successor is unclear, and no offspring of his have been identified. <a href="Khentkaus%20III">Khentkaus III</a> may have been Menkauhor's mother, as indicated by evidence discovered in her tomb in 2015.

Beyond the construction of monuments, the only known activity dated to Menkauhor's reign is an expedition to the <a href="copper">copper</a> and <a href="turquoise">turquoise</a> mines in <a href="Sinai">Sinai</a>. Menkauhor ordered the construction of a <a href="Egyptian%20sun%20temple">sun temple</a>, called the "Akhet-Ra", meaning "The Horizon of Ra". The last ever to be built, this sun temple, known from inscriptions found in the tombs of its priests, is yet to be located. Menkauhor was buried in a small <a href="Egyptian%20pyramids">pyramid</a> in <a href="Saqqara">Saqqara</a>, which the Ancient Egyptians named "Netjer-Isut Menkauhor", "The Divine Places of Menkauhor". Known today as the <a href="Headless%20Pyramid">Headless Pyramid</a>, the ruin had been lost under shifting sands until its rediscovery in 2008.

The figure of Menkauhor was at the centre of a long lasting funerary cult until the end of the Old Kingdom period, with at least seven agricultural domains producing goods for the necessary offerings. The cult of a deified Menkauhor, then known by the titles "Strong Lord of the Two Lands, Menkauhor <a href="Maat%20Kheru">the Justified</a>" reappeared during the <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom period</a> (c. 1550 – c. 1077 BC), and lasted until at least the <a href="Nineteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Nineteenth Dynasty</a> (c. 1292 – c. 1077 BC), some 1200 years after his death.

Menkauhor is attested by three hieroglyphic sources, all from the much later New Kingdom period. His name is given on the 31st entry of the <a href="Abydos%20King%20List">Abydos King List</a>, which was inscribed on the walls of a temple during the reign of <a href="Seti%20I">Seti I</a> (1290–1279 BC). He is also mentioned on the <a href="Saqqara%20Tablet">Saqqara Tablet</a> (30th entry) and on the <a href="Turin%20King%20List">Turin canon</a> (third column, 23rd row), both of which were written during the reign of <a href="Ramesses%20II">Ramesses II</a> (1279–1213 BC). The Turin canon credits Menkauhor with a reign of eight years. These sources indicate that Menkauhor succeeded <a href="Nyuserre%20Ini">Nyuserre Ini</a> and preceded <a href="Djedkare%20Isesi">Djedkare Isesi</a> on the throne, making him the seventh pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty.

Menkauhor was likely mentioned in the "<a href="Aegyptiaca">Aegyptiaca</a>", a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of <a href="Ptolemy%20II">Ptolemy II</a> (283–246 BC) by the Egyptian priest <a href="Manetho">Manetho</a>, but no copies of the text survive, and it is known only through later writings by <a href="Sextus%20Julius%20Africanus">Sextus Julius Africanus</a> and <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>. Africanus relates that the "Aegyptiaca" mentioned a pharaoh "Mencherês" reigning for nine years as the seventh king of the Fifth Dynasty. "Mencherês" is believed to be a <a href="Hellenized">Hellenized</a> form of "Menkauhor", and Africanus' nine-year figure fits well with the eight years of reign given to Menkauhor on the Turin canon, the latter figure being considered by some Egyptologists, including <a href="Hartwig%20Altenm%C3%BCller">Hartwig Altenmüller</a>, as more likely than the former.

Relatively few attestations dating to Menkauhor's reign have survived compared to the other kings of the Fifth Dynasty. Nonetheless, Menkauhor's name is well attested in the names and titles of priests and officials of the Fifth Dynasty as well as in the names of the agricultural estates associated with his funerary cult. Surviving artefacts contemporaneous with Menkauhor's reign include two stone vessels inscribed with his name from the <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Neferefre%23Mortuary%20temple">mortuary temple of Neferefre</a> – possibly gifts from Menkauhor for the funerary cult of <a href="Neferefre">Neferefre</a>– as well as a few sealings from the same temple and from an area known as "Djedkare's Family Cemetery" in Abusir. <a href="Cylinder%20seal">Cylinder seal</a> impressions showing Menkauhor's <a href="Horus%20name">Horus name</a> or the name of his pyramid have also been unearthed in the mortuary complex of Nyuserre Ini, and in the necropolises of Giza and <a href="Gebelein">Gebelein</a>.

A gold cylinder seal bearing Menkauhor's cartouche as part of the name of his pyramid together with the <a href="serekh">serekh</a> of Djedkare Isesi is now on display at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts%2C%20Boston">Museum of Fine Arts, Boston</a>. The seal, purportedly discovered near the <a href="Pactolus%20river">Pactolus river</a> valley in western <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, could attest to wide ranging trade-contacts during the Fifth Dynasty, but its provenance remains unverifiable.

The only secure depiction of the king dating to the Old Kingdom that has survived to this day is a rough, possibly unfinished, alabaster statuette showing Menkauhor enthroned and wearing the tight-fitting ceremonial robe of the "<a href="Sed%20festival">Heb-sed</a>". The statue was discovered in a cachette built during the late New Kingdom beneath the floor of a room to the west of the sacred lake at the <a href="temple%20of%20Ptah%20%28Memphis%29">temple of Ptah</a> in <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis</a>. The Egyptologist Jocelyn Berlandini proposed that another statuette, usually attributed to <a href="Teti">Teti</a>, belongs instead to Menkauhor Kaiu. Berlandini bases her hypothesis on stylistic grounds, noting the resemblance with Menkauhor's seated statue, as well as the location of the second statue, which was uncovered east of Teti's pyramid, in close proximity to Menkauhor's pyramid.

Monumental attestations of Menkauhor are limited to a rock inscription at the <a href="Wadi%20Maghareh">Wadi Maghareh</a> in <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai</a>, showing his titulary and a rough stele inscribed with his cartouche from Mastaba 904 at Saqqara.

The name of Menkauhor is a departure from those of other kings of the Fifth Dynasty. Menkauhor, whose name means "Eternal are the <a href="Ka%20%28Egyptian%20soul%29">Ka</a>s of <a href="Horus">Horus</a>", is the first pharaoh in 80 years whose name does not refer to the sun god <a href="Ra">Ra</a>. The name of Menkauhor instead finds its peers among the princes of the Fifth Dynasty with, for example, prince Khentykauhor "The forces of Horus are at the fore", a son of Nyuserre Ini, and prince <a href="Neserkauhor">Neserkauhor</a>, a son of Djedkare Isesi.

Owing to the paucity of contemporaneous sources for Menkauhor, his relation to his predecessor, Nyuserre Ini, and to his successor, Djedkare Isesi, cannot be ascertained beyond doubt. Menkauhor may have been a son of Nyuserre Ini; indeed Nyuserre Ini is known to have fathered a prince Khentykauhor as shown by a relief mentioning the prince from the mortuary complex of queen <a href="Khentkaus%20II">Khentkaus II</a>, the mother of Nyuserre Ini. The similarity of Khentykauhor's name to that of Menkauhor led the Egyptologists Miroslav Verner and Vivienne Callender to propose that the two are the same person, with Khentykauhor taking the name "Menkauhor" upon ascending the throne. This hypothesis is possibly contradicted by an inscription discovered in 2008 in the <a href="mastaba">mastaba</a> of Werkaure, the eldest son of an unnamed king. The inscription mentions a "Menkauhor", but does not ascribe any royal attributes to him. The Egyptologists Hana Vymazalová and Filip Coppens suggest this might refer to the future pharaoh Menkauhor Kaiu at a time when he was still a prince. They note that Menkauhor might have offered high-quality stone blocks for the construction of the tomb of his (possible) relative, which would explain the inscription. This contradicts the identification of Menkauhor with Khentykauhor; Vymazalová and Coppens theorize that Khentykauhor and Menkauhor were brothers and sons of Nyuserre Ini.

The identity of Menkauhor's mother is equally uncertain. In January 2015 the tomb of the "King's wife" and "King's mother", <a href="Khentkaus%20III">Khentkaus III</a>, was discovered by a team of <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech</a> archaeologists in the necropolis surrounding the pyramid of Neferefre in Abusir. Mud seals in the tomb indicate that Khentkaus III was buried during Nyuserre Ini's reign. Since Nyuserre Ini's own mother is known to have been Khentkaus II, the discovery suggests that she was Menkauhor Kaiu's mother. The position of her tomb close to the pyramid of Neferefre could indicate that she was this king's consort and thus that Neferefre was Menkauhor's father.

No queen consort of Menkauhor has been identified for certain. The Egyptologist Wilfried Seipel has proposed that <a href="Khuit%20I">Khuit I</a> was a queen of Menkauhor. Based on the dating of the tombs surrounding Khuit's burial, Seipel argues that she lived during the mid-Fifth Dynasty. By the process of elimination, he attributes known queens to each king of the period, which leaves only Menkauhor as a candidate for her king. These arguments are criticized by the Egyptologist <a href="Michel%20Baud">Michel Baud</a>, who observes that pharaohs could have had more than one queen.

Queen <a href="Meresankh%20IV">Meresankh IV</a> has also been suggested as a consort for Menkauhor based on the dating and location of her tomb in Saqqara. It is possible however that she was a wife of Djedkare Isesi.

There is no evidence either for or against the hypothesis that Menkauhor's successor Djedkare Isesi was his son. Two sons have been suggested for Menkauhor based on the dating and general location of their tombs in Saqqara: princes <a href="Raemka">Raemka</a> and Kaemtjenent, both believed to be children of Meresankh IV. By the same reasoning, they could instead be sons of Djedkare Isesi.

Given the scarcity of contemporaneous attestations for Menkauhor, modern <a href="Egyptologist">Egyptologist</a>s consider his reign to have been perhaps eight or nine years long, as indicated by the much later historical sources.
The small seated statue of Menkauhor wearing the robe of the Sed festival might suggest a longer reign, since this festival was typically celebrated only after a ruler had spent 30 years on the throne. However, Egyptologist Hartwig Altenmüller deems this hypothesis unlikely.
Mere depictions of the festival do not necessarily imply a long reign; for example, a relief showing pharaoh <a href="Sahure">Sahure</a> in the tunic of the Sed festival was found in his mortuary temple, although both historical sources and archaeological evidence suggest Sahure ruled Egypt for less than 14 full years.

Owing to the scarcity of artefacts and inscriptions relating to Menkauhor's reign, few of his activities are known. Menkauhor sent an expedition to Sinai to exploit the mines of <a href="turquoise">turquoise</a> and <a href="copper">copper</a> in the <a href="Wadi%20Maghareh">Wadi Maghareh</a>. The expedition is evidenced by a damaged rock inscription showing Menkauhor's titulary which is one of the few attestations dating to his lifetime. The mines of Sinai had been exploited since the <a href="Third%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Third Dynasty</a> (2686 BC–2613 BC), and both Menkauhor's predecessor Nyuserre Ini and successor Djedkare Isesi sent expeditions to the Wadi Maghareh.

Menkauhor Kaiu is known to have ordered the construction of two major monuments during his reign: a <a href="Egyptian%20sun%20temple">sun temple</a> for the veneration of Ra and a pyramid for his burial, known today as the "Headless Pyramid".

Following a tradition which started with <a href="Userkaf">Userkaf</a>, the founder of the Fifth Dynasty, Menkauhor built a temple to the sun god Ra. He was the last pharaoh to do so. His successors, Djedkare Isesi and Unas, abandoned this practice as the cult of Ra declined at the expense of that of Osiris. Given the paucity of documents relating to Menkauhor's sun temple, it probably functioned for only a short time or was never completed.

Menkauhor's sun temple was called "Akhet-Ra", which is variously translated as "The Horizon of Ra" or "The Place where Ra Issues Forth". The temple has yet to be located and could be lying under the sands of Saqqara or Abusir. Its existence is known thanks to inscriptions found in the tombs of Fifth and Sixth Dynasties officials who served as priests of Ra in the temple. These include Hemu, buried in Giza, and Neferiretptah and Raemankh, who were both buried in Saqqara-north. In addition to his service in the "Akhet-Ra", Neferiretptah was a priest in Menkauhor's pyramid and held the office of "royal ornament", making him responsible for the precious items in the palace of the king.

Besides these inscriptions, a single seal bearing the name of the "Akhet-Ra" is known from the tomb of princess Khamerernebti, located near the mortuary temple of Niuserre in Abusir. The seal was placed on a large vessel indicating that provisions for the tombs of members of the royal family were dispatched from Menkauhor's temple to Niuserre's pyramid complex.

Menkauhor Kaiu built a pyramid in North-Saqqara, thereby abandoning the royal necropolis of Abusir, where kings of the Fifth Dynasty had been buried since the reign of Sahure, some 80 years earlier. The reason for this choice may be that the Abusir plateau had become overcrowded by the beginning of Menkauhor's reign.

Originally named "Netjer-isut-Menkauhor" by the Ancient Egyptians, meaning "The divine places of Menkauhor", the pyramid is known today as <a href="Lepsius%20list%20of%20pyramids">Lepsius XXIX</a> after the number given to it by the archaeologist <a href="Karl%20Richard%20Lepsius">Karl Richard Lepsius</a> who discovered the pyramid in 1843. Owing to the ruined state of the structure, it is known in Arabic as the "<a href="Headless%20Pyramid">Headless Pyramid</a>", a name that has been retained. The pyramid was lost under shifting sands in the early 20th century and its attribution to Menkauhor was consequently debated. Instead, it was proposed that the Headless Pyramid was <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Merikare">that of Merikare</a>, a structure dating to the <a href="First%20Intermediate%20Period%20of%20Egypt">First Intermediate Period</a> and which has yet to be found. In 2008, the structure identified by Lepsius was rediscovered by a team of archaeologists under the direction of <a href="Zahi%20Hawass">Zahi Hawass</a>, and excavations at the site quickly established a Fifth Dynasty date as indicated by the construction techniques used in its making. Although the excavations failed to yield the name of the king who built the pyramid, Menkauhor was the last pharaoh of the dynasty whose pyramid remained undiscovered. Thus, proceeding by elimination, archeologists and egyptologists have formally recognized the Headless Pyramid as that of Menkauhor.

The pyramid is estimated to have been around at the base, so that the edifice would have stood high at the time of its construction, making it one of the smallest royal pyramids of the Old Kingdom.
There is evidence that Menkauhor had the time to complete his pyramid, whose small dimensions are thus consistent with his short eight to nine years of reign.

On the north side lies the entrance to the underground chamber system, which was sealed by two granite portcullises indicating that a burial took place. A broken sarcophagus lid of blue-grey basalt was found in the burial chamber by <a href="Cecil%20Mallaby%20Firth">Cecil Mallaby Firth</a> during his brief excavations of the pyramid in 1930.

After his death Menkauhor enjoyed a funerary cult centered on his pyramid complex. The cult lasted at least until the second half of the <a href="Sixth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Sixth Dynasty</a>, nearly 150 years later. Provisions for this cult were produced in dedicated agricultural domains that were established during Menkauhor's lifetime. Products of these domains were delivered to Menkauhor's sun and mortuary temples and distributed to the priests of the cult, who could use them for their sustenance or their own funerary cults. Personified representations of Menkauhor's agricultural domains are depicted bringing offerings on the walls of the mastabas of these priests. Most of the depictions are located in Saqqara North, near the <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Djoser">pyramid complex of Djoser</a>. This area comprises the tombs of Neferiretptah, Raemankh, Duare, Iti, Sekhemnefer, Snofrunefer, Akhethotep, Ptahhotep and Qednes, all priests of the funerary cult of Menkauhor. Further tombs of priests of this cult are found to the north, in Abusir South, with the mastaba of Isesiseneb and Rahotep and in Giza.

The complete names of at least seven domains of Menkauhor are known: "Ikauhor is perfect in favor" and "the favor of Ikauhor", both mentioned in the tombs of Ptahhotep and Akhethotep; "Ikauhor is perfect of life", from the tomb of Ptahhotep II; "Horus Qemaa causes Ikauhor to live"; "Ikauhor is strong"; "<a href="Seshat">Seshat</a> loves Ikauhor" and "Matyt loves Ikauhor" from the tombs of viziers <a href="Senedjemib%20Inti">Senedjemib Inti</a>, <a href="Senedjemib%20Mehi">Senedjemib Mehi</a> and Hemu in Giza. In addition the "Ḥwt" domain of the king, which comprises the land holdings of the mortuary temple of Menkauhor, was named "Menkauhor is perfect of appearances".

The cult of Menkauhor enjoyed a revival during the New Kingdom period (1550–1077 BC). At this point Menkauhor had been deified as a local god of the Saqqara necropolis acting as a divine intercessor, and qualified of "Strong Lord of the Two Lands, Menkauhor <a href="Maat%20Kheru">the Justified</a>". This cult is evidenced by reliefs showing Menkauhor in the tombs of the "Chief of the artisans and jewelers" Ameneminet and of the physician Thuthu in Saqqara-North, both of whom lived at the time of the late <a href="Eighteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Eighteenth Dynasty</a> (1550–1292 BC), during the reigns of <a href="Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun</a>, <a href="Ay">Ay</a> and <a href="Horemheb">Horemheb</a>.

An inscribed block dating to the later <a href="Nineteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Ramesside period</a> (1292–1077 BC) and now in the <a href="Neues%20Museum">Egyptian Museum of Berlin</a>, was uncovered by Lepsius in a house in Abusir and shows Menkauhor enthroned beside four other deified kings of the Old Kingdom: the name of the first, partially lost, but probably <a href="Sneferu">Sneferu</a> is then followed by <a href="Djedefre">Djedefre</a>, <a href="Menkaure">Menkaure</a>, Menkauhor and finally <a href="Pepi%20II%20Neferkare">Neferkare</a>. The owner of the tomb stands before the kings, in worship. Another relief dating to the same period shows a similar scene. It was inscribed on the lintel of the tomb chapel of Mahy buried in Saqqara North. Four deified kings of the Old Kingdom are shown, all of whom built their pyramids at Saqqara: <a href="Djoser">Djoser</a>, Teti, Userkaf and Menkauhor.

The persistence of the cult of Menkauhor during the late Eighteenth to Nineteenth Dynasty possibly results from the location of his pyramid, which stood on the way to the necropolis of the <a href="Apis%20%28deity%29">Apis</a> bulls, which later became the <a href="Serapeum">Serapeum</a>.

Djedkare Isesi

Djedkare Isesi (known in <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> as Tancheres) was a <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>, the eighth and penultimate ruler of the <a href="Fifth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fifth Dynasty of Egypt</a> in the late <a href="25th%20century%20BC">25th century</a> to mid-<a href="24th%20century%20BC">24th century BC</a>, during the <a href="Old%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Old Kingdom</a>. Djedkare succeeded <a href="Menkauhor%20Kaiu">Menkauhor Kaiu</a> and was in turn succeeded by <a href="Unas">Unas</a>. His relations to both of these pharaohs remain uncertain, although it is often conjectured that Unas was Djedkare's son, owing to the smooth transition between the two.

Djedkare likely enjoyed a reign of more than 40 years, which heralded a new period in the history of the Old Kingdom. Breaking with a tradition followed by his predecessors since the time of <a href="Userkaf">Userkaf</a>, Djedkare did not build a temple to the sun god <a href="Ra">Ra</a>, possibly reflecting the rise of <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a> in the <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">Egyptian pantheon</a>. More significantly, Djedkare effected comprehensive reforms of the Egyptian state administration, the first undertaken since the inception of the system of ranking titles. He also reorganised the <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20funerary%20practices">funerary cults</a> of his forebears buried in the <a href="necropolis">necropolis</a> of <a href="Abusir">Abusir</a> and reformed the corresponding <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20religion%23Funerary%20practices">priesthood</a>.

Djedkare commissioned expeditions to <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula%23Ancient%20Egypt">Sinai</a> to procure <a href="copper">copper</a> and <a href="turquoise">turquoise</a>, to <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a> for its gold and <a href="diorite">diorite</a> and to the fabled <a href="Land%20of%20Punt">Land of Punt</a> for its <a href="incense">incense</a>. One such expedition had what could be the earliest recorded instance of <a href="oracle">oracular</a> <a href="divination">divination</a> undertaken to ensure an expedition's success. The word "Nub", meaning gold, to designate Nubia is first recorded during Djedkare's reign. Under his rule, Egypt also entertained continuing trade relations with the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>ine coast and made punitive raids in <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>. In particular, one of the earliest depictions of a battle or siege scene was found in the tomb of one of Djedkare's subjects.

Djedkare was buried in a <a href="Egyptian%20pyramids">pyramid</a> in <a href="Saqqara">Saqqara</a> named <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Djedkare%20Isesi">Nefer Djedkare</a> ("Djedkare is perfect"), which is now <a href="ruin">ruin</a>ed owing to theft of stone from its outer casing during antiquity. The burial chamber still held Djedkare's <a href="Mummy%23Egyptian%20mummies">mummy</a> when it was excavated in the 1940s. Examinations of the mummy revealed that he died in his fifties. Following his death, Djedkare was the object of a cult that lasted at least until the end of the Old Kingdom. He seemed to have been held in particularly high esteem during the mid-<a href="Sixth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Sixth Dynasty</a>, whose pharaohs lavished rich offerings on his cult. Archaeological evidence suggests the continuing existence of this funerary cult throughout the much later <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom</a> (c. 1550–1077 BC). Djedkare was also remembered by the ancient Egyptians as the Pharaoh of <a href="vizier%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">Vizier</a> <a href="Ptahhotep">Ptahhotep</a>, the purported author of "<a href="The%20Maxims%20of%20Ptahhotep">The Maxims of Ptahhotep</a>", one of the earliest pieces of philosophic <a href="wisdom%20literature">wisdom literature</a>.

The reforms implemented by Djedkare are generally assessed negatively in <a href="Egyptology%23Modern%20Egyptology">modern Egyptology</a> as his policy of decentralization created a virtual feudal system that transferred much power to the high and provincial administrations. Some Egyptologists such as <a href="Naguib%20Kanawati">Naguib Kanawati</a> argue that this contributed heavily to the collapse of the Egyptian state during the <a href="First%20Intermediate%20Period%20of%20Egypt">First Intermediate Period</a>, c. 200 years later. These conclusions are rejected by Nigel Strudwick, who says that in spite of Djedkare's reforms, Ancient Egyptian officials never amassed enough power to rival that of the king.

Djedkare is well attested in sources contemporaneous with his reign. The tombs of many of his courtiers and family members have been discovered in Giza, <a href="Saqqara">Saqqara</a> and <a href="Abusir">Abusir</a>. They give insights into the administrative reforms that Djedkare conducted during his reign and, in a few cases, even record letters that the king sent to his officials. These letters, inscribed on the walls of tombs, typically present royal praises for the tomb owner.

Another important source of information about Egypt during the reign of Djedkare is the <a href="Abusir%20Papyri">Abusir papyri</a>. These are administrative documents, covering a period of 24 years during Djedkare's reign; they were discovered in the mortuary temples of pharaohs <a href="Neferirkare%20Kakai">Neferirkare Kakai</a>, <a href="Neferefre">Neferefre</a> and queen <a href="Khentkaus%20II">Khentkaus II</a>. In addition to these texts, the earliest letters on papyrus preserved to the present day also date to Djedkare's reign, dealing with administrative or private matters.

Djedkare is attested in four ancient Egyptian king lists, all dating to the <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom</a>. The earliest of these is the <a href="Karnak%20king%20list">Karnak king list</a>, dating to the reign of <a href="Thutmose%20III">Thutmose III</a> (1479–1425 BC), where Djedkare is mentioned on the fifth entry. Djedkare's <a href="Prenomen%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">prenomen</a> occupies the 32nd entry of the <a href="Abydos%20King%20List">Abydos King List</a>, which was written during the reign of <a href="Seti%20I">Seti I</a> (1290–1279 BC). Djedkare is also present on the <a href="Saqqara%20Tablet">Saqqara Tablet</a> (31st entry) where he is listed under the name "Maatkare", probably because of a scribal error. Djedkare's prenomen is given as "Djed" on the <a href="Turin%20King%20List">Turin canon</a> (third column, 24th row), probably because of a lacuna affecting the original document from which the canon was copied during the reign of <a href="Ramses%20II">Ramses II</a> (1279–1213 BC). The Turin canon credits Djedkare with 28 years of reign.

In addition to these sources, Djedkare is mentioned on the <a href="Prisse%20Papyrus">Prisse Papyrus</a> dating to the <a href="Twelfth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">12th Dynasty</a> (c. 1990–1800 BC). The papyrus records "<a href="The%20Maxims%20of%20Ptahhotep">The Maxims of Ptahhotep</a>" and gives Djedkare's <a href="Nomen%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">nomen</a> "Isesi" to name the pharaoh whom the purported authors of the maxims, <a href="Vizier%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">vizier</a> <a href="Ptahhotep">Ptahhotep</a>, served.
Djedkare was also probably mentioned in the "<a href="Manetho%23Aegyptiaca">Aegyptiaca</a>", a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of <a href="Ptolemy%20II">Ptolemy II</a> (283–246 BC) by the Egyptian priest <a href="Manetho">Manetho</a>. No copies of the "Aegyptiaca" have survived to this day and it is known to us only through later writings by <a href="Sextus%20Julius%20Africanus">Sextus Julius Africanus</a> and <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>. Africanus relates that a pharaoh Tancheres (<a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> Τανχέρης) reigned for 44 years as the eighth and penultimate king of the Fifth Dynasty. Given its position within the dynasty, Tancheres is believed to be his <a href="Hellenization">Hellenized</a> name.

Djedkare's parentage is unknown; in particular his relation with his predecessors <a href="Menkauhor%20Kaiu">Menkauhor Kaiu</a> and <a href="Nyuserre%20Ini">Nyuserre Ini</a> cannot be ascertained. Djedkare is generally thought to have been the son of Menkauhor Kaiu, but the two might instead have been brothers and sons of Nyuserre Ini. Another hypothesis suggests that Djedkare and Menkauhor could have been cousins, being sons of Nyuserre and Neferefre respectively.
The identity of Djedkare's mother is similarly unknown.

The name of Djedkare's principal wife is not known. An important queen consort whose name is lost was very likely the owner of a large pyramid complex located to the northeast of Djedkare's pyramid in Saqqara. This could indicate that she was the mother of Djedkare's successor, <a href="Unas">Unas</a>, or that Djedkare owed the throne to her. The very high status of this queen is suggested by some features of her funerary complex that are otherwise reserved to kings: her pyramid has its own satellite pyramid, has a causeway leading from a valley temple up to a mortuary temple devoted to the cult of the queen and had an entrance hall "pr-wrw", an open courtyard and a square antechamber. Furthermore, some reliefs showing the queen had been reworked with royal insignia and vultures added above her head. Since the construction of the queen's pyramid was apparently undertaken after the planning of Djedkare's pyramid and her relief had been reworked, the Egyptologist Klaus Baer suggests that this queen may have ruled after the death of Djedkare, playing an important role in his succession. This is rejected by other Egyptologists, such as <a href="Michel%20Baud">Michel Baud</a>, owing to the lack of evidence for a regency or interregnum between Djedkare and Unas.

The Egyptologist Wilfried Seipel has proposed that this pyramid was initially intended for queen <a href="Meresankh%20IV">Meresankh IV</a>, whom he and Verner see as a wife of Djedkare. Seipel contends that Meresankh was finally buried in a smaller mastaba in Saqqara North after she fell into disgrace. Alternatively, Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton have proposed that she was a wife of the preceding king, Menkauhor Kaiu.

Only one son of Djedkare has been identified for certain, <a href="Neserkauhor">Neserkauhor</a>, who bore the title of "eldest beloved king's son of his body". Neserkauhor also bore the title of <a href="Iry-pat">Iry-pat</a>, showing that he was an important member of the royal court, as well as a priestly title "Greatest of the Five in the temple of Thot", suggesting that he may have been a vizier or had similar occupations.

As well as Neserkauhor, there is indirect evidence that princes <a href="Raemka">Raemka</a> and <a href="Kaemtjenent">Kaemtjenent</a> are sons of Djedkare based on the dating and general location of their tombs in Saqqara. For example, the tomb of Kaemtjenent mentions vizier Rashepses, who served during the reign of Djedkare. Raemka also bore the title of "king's son of his body", almost exclusively reserved to true princes of royal blood. The locations of Raemka's and Kaemtjenent's tombs have led some Egyptologists to believe that both princes are sons of queen Meresankh IV buried nearby, who would thus be one of Djedkare's wives. These conclusions are debated, in particular in the case of Kaemtjenent, whose title of "king's son" may have been purely honorific.

A high official named <a href="Isesi-ankh">Isesi-ankh</a> could have been yet another son of Djedkare, as suggested by his name meaning "Isesi lives". Yet, similarities in the titles and locations of the tombs of Isesi-ankh and Kaemtjenent have led Egyptologists to propose that they could instead be brothers and sons of Meresankh IV, or that the former is a son of the latter. Even though Isesi-ankh bore the title of "king's son", the Egyptologists Michel Baud and Bettina Schmitz argue that this filiation was fictitious, being only an honorary title.

Finally, the successor of Djedkare, Unas, is thought to have been his son in spite of the complete lack of evidence bearing on the question. The main argument in favor of this filiation is that the succession from Djedkare to Unas seems to have been smooth, as suggested indirectly, for example, by the Abusir papyri. Indirect evidence also comes from the reliefs of Unas' causeway, which show many officials bearing names incorporating "Isesi", suggesting at the very least that Unas did not perceive Djedkare as an antagonist.

Several daughters of Djedkare have been identified by the title of "king's daughter of his body" and the general date of their tomb. These include <a href="Kekheretnebti">Kekheretnebti</a>, whose filiation is clearly indicated by her other title of "Beloved of Isesi", <a href="Meret-Isesi">Meret-Isesi</a>, <a href="Hedjetnebu">Hedjetnebu</a>, and <a href="Nebtyemneferes">Nebtyemneferes</a>. Less certain is the filiation of Kentkhaus III, wife of vizier <a href="Senedjemib%20Mehi">Senedjemib Mehi</a>, who bore the title of "king's daughter of his body". It is debated whether this title indicates a true filiation or if it is only honorary.

The relative chronological position of Djedkare as the eighth and penultimate ruler of the Fifth Dynasty, succeeding Menkauhor Kaiu and preceding Unas on the throne, is well established by historical sources and confirmed by archaeological evidence.

The duration of Djedkare's reign is much less certain. Djedkare's time on the throne is well documented by the Abusir papyri, numerous royal seals and contemporary inscriptions; taken together, they indicate a fairly long rule for this king. While the Turin canon credits him with 28 years of reign, there is direct evidence for an even longer reign. Several artefacts and inscriptions have been uncovered relating to Djedkare's rejuvenation or <a href="Sed%20festival">"sed" festival</a>, normally celebrated only after 30 years of reign. For example, the tomb of one of Djedkare's viziers, <a href="Senedjemib%20Inti">Senedjemib Inti</a>, relates construction works undertaken during the year of the 16th cattle count in preparation for the festival ceremonies. An alabaster vase now on display at the Louvre museum bears an inscription celebrating Djedkare's first sed festival, indicating in all likelihood that he reigned beyond his 30th year on the throne.

One of the Abusir papyri was found to be dated to the "Year of the 22nd Count, IV <a href="Season%20of%20the%20Inundation">Akhet</a> day 12", constituting Djedkare's latest known date. This date might correspond to any time from the 32nd year of Djedkare's reign up to his 44th year on the throne, depending on whether the cattle count was once every two years or once every year and a half. The higher estimate is close to Manetho's 44-year figure credited to Tancheres, the Hellenized name of Djedkare, although this may just be coincidental. Modern estimates thus put Djedkare's reign length as certainly more than 33 years and, if the cattle count was regularly biennial, at least 42 to 44 years. This makes Djedkare the longest reigning king of the Fifth Dynasty.

The reign of Djedkare heralded a new period in the history of the Old Kingdom. First, he did not build a <a href="Egyptian%20sun%20temple">sun temple</a>, as his predecessors had done since the time of <a href="Userkaf">Userkaf</a>, some 80 years earlier. This may be a result of the increased prominence of <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a> compared with the sun god <a href="Ra">Ra</a> during the late Fifth Dynasty. The rise of Osiris corresponds to changes in the role of king with respect to the wider Egyptian society, in particular the king loses his role as the sole guarantor of the afterlife, which now becomes available beyond the immediate royal circle. This changes demythologise the king's position and, as the Egyptologist Hans Goedicke write, make him fully human yet still socially dominant.
The importance of the cult of Osiris becomes manifest when the <a href="Pyramid%20Texts">Pyramid Texts</a> of the <a href="pyramid%20of%20Unas">pyramid of Unas</a> are inscribed a few decades later. In this context, it is perhaps noteworthy that the only known statue of Djedkare was discovered in the ruins of the temple of Osiris, in <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a>. Another manifestation of the winds of change during Djedkare's time on throne is the confirmation of the relocation of the royal necropolis from Abusir, where it had been since the reign of <a href="Sahure">Sahure</a>, to Saqqara, where Menkauhor Kaiu, Djedkare and his successor, Unas, built their pyramids. Abusir may have become overcrowded by the time of Menkauhor's accession and the capital may have been shifted south to Saqqara along with the royal necropolis around the same time. The abandonment of Abusir as a royal necropolis and the termination of sun temple building are possibly related given the close association between the two since the reign of Userkaf.

During his reign Djedkare effected significant reforms of the state administration and priesthood, in particular that pertaining to the funerary cults in the necropolis of Abusir.
These evolutions are witnessed by changes in priestly titles and more broadly, in the system of ranking titles of high officials, which was modified for the first time in its existence. For example, the priesthood of the royal pyramids was reorganized, with Djedkare possibly changing the titles and functions of the priests from "priest of king" to "priest of the pyramid", although this change may have happened earlier, under Nyuserre Ini.
Princes of royal blood could once more hold administrative titles, a prerogative they had lost during the early Fifth Dynasty. At the same time, viziers could now hold the prestigious titles of "Iry-pat" and "<a href="Haty-a">Haty-a</a>" and, as "overseer of the royal scribes", became the head of the scribal administration. At least one vizier, <a href="Seshemnefer%20%28III%29">Seshemnefer III</a>, even bore the title of "king's son of his body", one of the most distinguished titles at the time and normally reserved to princes of royal blood. Yet neither Seshemnefer III's father nor his mother seems to have belonged to the royal family. For the period spanning the reign of Djedkare until that of Teti, viziers were furthermore responsible for the weaponry of the state, both for military and other purposes. Following the reforms undertaken by Djedkare, three viziers would be in office at the same time: two in the <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphite</a> region and a Southern one, the "governor of Upper Egypt", with a seat at Abydos. In total six viziers were appointed during Djedkare's reign.

Lower ranking officials lost power during the late Fifth Dynasty and were frequently limited to holding only one high title, a departure from the preceding period. Such functions as "overseer of the granary" and "overseer of the treasury" disappear from the record some time between Djedkare's reign and that of <a href="Teti">Teti</a>, while men of lower status became head of the legal administration. Consequently, the viziers concentrated more power than before while lower echelons of the state administration were reduced. At the same time, the size of the provincial administration was increased, and it also became more autonomous from the central government. In particular, the <a href="nomarch">nomarch</a>s were responsible in their provinces for performing works hitherto conducted by Memphite officials.

The main building activity undertaken during the reign of Djedkare was the construction of his pyramid complex in Saqqara. Djedkare also either completed or undertook restoration works in the funerary complex of Nyuserre Ini in Abusir, as indicated by a now damaged inscription, which must have detailed Djedkare's activities on the site. Further building works took place in Abusir during the second half of Djedkare's reign following the curious decision by members of the royal family to be buried there rather than next to Djedkare's pyramid in Saqqara. A group of mastabas was thus constructed for princess Kekheretnebti and her daughter Tisethor, princess Hedjetnebu, the courtiers Mernefu and Idu, who was buried with his wife Khenit, and prince Neserkauhor.

Djedkare also undertook building activities in relation with his "sed" festival as indicated by a decree that he sent to his vizier Senedjemib Inti on the year of the 16th cattle count, praising him for his work. The decree mentions the construction of a broad rectangular court or artificial lake for the jubilee of the king, some 1000 <a href="Cubit%23Ancient%20Egyptian%20royal%20cubit">cubits</a> long and 400 cubits wide, amounting to c. . The court was located within the precincts of a palace built for the ceremonies of the "sed" festival, which was probably located in the vicinity of his pyramid. Another decree addressed to Senedjemib Inti and later inscribed on the walls of his mastaba records the decoration of a chapel of <a href="Hathor">Hathor</a> in the palace of the king. This chapel was most likely built during his reign.

Djedkare may have left some of his monuments unfinished at his death, as suggested by several relief-bearing blocks inscribed with his name and which were found reused in the pyramid of king Unas. Their original setting remains unknown.

Three or four rock inscriptions dating to Djedkare's reign have been found in the <a href="Wadi%20Maghareh">Wadi Maghareh</a> in Sinai, where mines of copper and semi-precious stones were exploited throughout the Old Kingdom, from the <a href="Fourth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fourth</a> until the <a href="Sixth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Sixth Dynasty</a>. These inscriptions record three expeditions sent to look for <a href="turquoise">turquoise</a>: the earliest one, dated to the third or fourth <a href="Cattle%20count%20%28Egypt%29">cattle count</a>–possibly corresponding to the sixth or eighth year of Dejdkare's reign–explicitly recalls the arrival of the mining party to the "hills of the turquoise" after being given "divine authority for the finding of semi-precious stones in the writing of the god himself, [as was enacted] in the broad court of the <a href="Userkaf%23Sun%20temple">temple Nekhenre</a>". This sentence could indicate the earliest known record of an oracular <a href="divination">divination</a> undertaken in order to ensure the success of the expedition prior to its departure, Nekhenre being the sun temple of Userkaf.
Another inscription dating to the year of the ninth cattle count–possibly Djedkare's 18th year on the throne – shows the king "subduing all foreign lands. Smiting the chief of the foreign land". The expedition that left this inscription comprised over 1400 men and administration officials. Some Egyptologists have proposed that these men were also sent to mine copper.

These expeditions departed Egypt from the port of <a href="Ain%20Sukhna">Ain Sukhna</a>, on the western shore of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Suez">Gulf of Suez</a>, as revealed by papyri and seals bearing Djedkare's name found on the site. The port comprised large galleries carved into the sandstone serving as living quarters and storage places. The wall of one such gallery was inscribed with a text mentioning yet another expedition to the hills of turquoise in the year of the seventh cattle count–possibly Djedkare's 14th year on the throne. In early 2018, more than 220 clay seals bearing the serekh of Djedkare were uncovered in <a href="Edfu%23Ancient%20Tell%20Edfu">Tell Edfu</a> in the south of Upper Egypt. These seals have been found in close association with copper ore, Nubian potery, the remains of two large buildings and a settlement. Edfu, called Behdet by the ancient Egyptians, was likely the place of departure for the mining expeditions sent to the Eastern desert and the Red Sea during Djedkare's reign. These expeditions were undertaken by a special group of prospectors, called the "sementiu", who were under the orders of an administration official sent by the king from Memphis to Edfu.
South of Egypt, Djedkare dispatched at least one expedition to the <a href="diorite">diorite</a> quarries located north-west of <a href="Abu%20Simbel">Abu Simbel</a>. Djedkare was not the first king to do so, as these quarries were already exploited during the Fourth Dynasty and continued to be so during the Sixth Dynasty and later, in the Middle Kingdom period (c. 2055 BE – c. 1650 BC).

Djedkare probably also exploited gold mines in the <a href="Eastern%20Desert">Eastern Desert</a> and in <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>: indeed, the earliest mention of the "land of gold" – an Ancient Egyptian term for Nubia – is found in an inscription from the mortuary temple of Djedkare.

Egypt entertained continuing trade relations with the Levant during Djedkare's reign, possibly as far north as <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>. A gold <a href="cylinder%20seal">cylinder seal</a> bearing the <a href="serekh">serekh</a> of Djedkare together with the cartouche of Menkauhor Kaiu is now on display at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts%2C%20Boston">Museum of Fine Arts, Boston</a>. The seal, whose gold may originate from the <a href="Pactolus">Pactolus river</a> valley in western Anatolia, could attest to wide-ranging trade-contacts during the later Fifth Dynasty, but its provenance remains unverifiable.

Trade contacts with <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a>, on the coast of modern-day <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, are suggested by a fragmentary stone vessel unearthed in the city and bearing the inscription "King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Djedkare [living] forever". A biographical inscription discovered in the tomb of Iny, a Sixth Dynasty official, provides further evidence for an Egyptian expedition to Byblos during Djedkare's reign. Iny's inscription relates his travels to procure lapis lazuli and lead or tin for pharaoh Merenre, but starts by recounting what must have been similar events taking place under Djedkare.

To the south of Egypt, Djedkare also sent an expedition to the fabled <a href="Land%20of%20Punt">Land of Punt</a> to procure the myrrh used as incense in the Egyptian temples. The expedition to Punt is referred to in the letter from <a href="Pepi%20II%20Neferkare">Pepi II Neferkare</a> to Harkuf some 100 years later. Harkuf had reported that he would bring back a "dwarf of the god's dancers from the land of the horizon dwellers". Pepi mentions that the god's sealbearer Werdjededkhnum had returned from Punt with a dwarf during the reign of Djedkare and had been richly rewarded. The decree mentions that "My Majesty will do for you something greater than what was done for the god's sealbearer Werdjededkhnum in the reign of Isesi, reflecting my majesty's yearning to see this dwarf".

Djedkare's expedition to Punt is also mentioned in a contemporaneous <a href="Graffiti">graffito</a> found in Tumas, a locality of Lower Nubia some south of <a href="Aswan">Aswan</a>, where Isesi's cartouche was discovered.

Not all relations between Egypt and its neighbors were peaceful during Djedkare's reign. In particular, one of the earliest known depictions of a battle or city being besieged is found in the tomb of Inti, an official from the <a href="Nome%20%28Egypt%29%23Upper%20Egypt">21st nome of Upper Egypt</a>, who lived during the late Fifth Dynasty. The scene shows Egyptian soldiers scaling the walls of a near eastern fortress on ladders. More generally, ancient Egyptians seem to have regularly organised punitive raids in <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a> during the later Old Kingdom period but did not attempt to establish a permanent dominion there.

Djedkare built his pyramid in South Saqqara. It was called "Nefer Isesi" or "Nefer Djedkare" in Ancient Egyptian, variously translated as "Isesi/Djedkare is beautiful" or "Isesi/Djedkare is perfect". It is known today as "Haram el-Shawwâf" (), because it stands on the edge of the Nile valley.

The pyramid originally comprised six or seven steps made of irregular and roughly hewn limestone blocks and mortar, of which only three survive. This core was overlaid by casing stones of white <a href="Tura%2C%20Egypt">Tura</a> limestone, which have been stolen in antiquity. At the time of its construction the pyramid stood high with a base length of and an inclination angle of 52°.

In the interior of the pyramid a descending passage led, behind three granite portcullises, to an antechamber, three magazine rooms and the burial chamber. In it, pieces of alabaster and a faience bead on a gold thread were discovered as well as many fragments of what was originally a large <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> of dark grey basalt. The sarcophagus was sunk into the floor of the burial chamber together with a niche for the <a href="canopic%20chest">canopic chest</a> of the king to its north-east. An almost complete mummy was discovered in the remnants of the sarcophagus. An examination by Ahmed Batrawi of these skeletal remains, excavated in the mid-1940s under the direction of Abdel-Salam Hussein, suggests that Djedkare died at the age of 50 to 60 years old.

To the east of the pyramid, Djedkare's mortuary temple was laid out. The eastern façade of the mortuary temple was flanked by two massive stone structures, which resemble the later <a href="Pylon%20%28architecture%29">pylon</a>s. The mortuary temple is connected via a yet unexcavated causeway to a valley temple.

For Nigel Strudwick, the reforms of Djedkare were undertaken as a reaction to the rapid growth of the central administration in the first part of the Fifth Dynasty which, Baer adds, had amassed too much political or economic power in the eyes of the king. <a href="Joyce%20Tyldesley">Joyce Tyldesley</a> sees the reign of Djedkare as the very beginning of a decline in the importance of the king, in conjunction with the gradual rise of the power wielded by the high and provincial administration. Concurrent with this trend is a process of decentralization, with local loyalties slowly superseding allegiance to the central state. Since offices and the vizierate in particular could be inherited, the reforms of Djedkare created a "virtual feudal system" as <a href="Nicolas%20Grimal">Nicolas Grimal</a> writes, with much power in the hands of a few puissant officials. This is best witnessed by the large, magnificent mastaba tombs that Djedkare's viziers built. In this context, Djedkare's reforms of the ranking system might have been an attempt at maintaining a sprawling administration under control, yet ultimately failed. For some Egyptologists, such as <a href="Naguib%20Kanawati">Naguib Kanawati</a>, this failure contributed in no small part to the fall of the Old Kingdom, but others, including Strudwick, believe the reasons of the collapse must be sought elsewhere as the power of an administration official never approached that of the king.

The reforms of Djedkare played an important role in flourishing of the arts during the later Old Kingdom, as artisans and craftsmen could now find many wealthy patrons beyond the king. This created a surge in the number of commissions leading to a general improvement of the artistic works. This also provided the artisans with a new wealth, which they used to build their own large funerary complexes.

Djedkare was the object of a funerary cult established at his death and which lasted until the end of the Old Kingdom nearly 200 years later. Provisions for this cult were produced in several agricultural estates set up during Djedkare's reign. The names of some of these estates have been found inscribed on the walls of the tombs of his courtiers: "Ra desires that Isesi lives", "<a href="Heqet">Heqa</a> desires that Izezi live", "Perfect of emulation is Isesi", "The mnza-vessel of Djedkare", "Perfect of favors is Isesi", "<a href="Seshat">Seshat</a> makes Isesi live", "The <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20concept%20of%20the%20soul%23Ka%20.28vital%20spark.29">Ka</a> of Isesi is foremost", "Dominion belongs to Izezi", "Work of the command of Izezi", "<a href="Bastet">Bastet</a> wishes that Izezi lives", "<a href="Horus">Horus</a> perpetuates Izezi", "The offerings of Izezi", and "Izezi is one who loves life".

Djedkare seems to have been held in high esteem during the Sixth Dynasty. For example, <a href="Merenre%20Nemtyemsaf%20I">Merenre Nemtyemsaf I</a> chose to place his pyramid complex close to that of Djedkare. In addition, the <a href="South%20Saqqara%20Stone">South Saqqara Stone</a>, a royal annal dating to the reign of Merenre or of his successor Pepi II, records rich offerings being made to Djedkare on behalf of the king. An estimated 92% of the text inscribed on the stone was lost when it was roughly polished to be reused as a sarcophagus lid, possibly in the late <a href="First%20Intermediate%20Period">First Intermediate</a> (c. 2160–2055 BC) to early <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> period (c. 2055–1650 BC).

More generally, an historical or literary tradition concerning events in the time of Djedkare seems to have flourished toward the end of Old Kingdom as can be inferred from the tombs of Harkuf and Iny. These two officials were in charge of expeditions to foreign lands–Punt and Byblos– under Merenre I and Pepi II and both relate similar expeditions that took place during the time of Djedkare.

The funerary cult of Djedkare enjoyed a revival during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1077 BC). For the early part of this period, this is best attested by the Karnak king list, a list of kings commissioned by pharaoh Thutmose III. The list was not meant to be exhaustive, rather it gave the names of Thutmose's forefathers whom he wanted to honor by dedicating offerings.

For the later New Kingdom, a relief from the Saqqara tomb of the priest Mehu, dating to the 19th or <a href="Twentieth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">20th Dynasty</a> shows three gods faced by several deceased pharaohs. These are <a href="Djoser">Djoser</a> and <a href="Sekhemket">Sekhemket</a>, of the <a href="Third%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Third Dynasty</a> and Userkaf, founder of the Fifth Dynasty. He is followed by a fourth king whose name is damaged but which is often read "Djedkare" or, much less likely, "<a href="Shepseskare">Shepseskare</a>". The relief is an expression of personal piety on Mehu's behalf, who prayed to the ancient kings for them to recommend him to the gods.

Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)

The development team wanted to make a game featuring Shadow to capitalize on the character's popularity and resolve plot mysteries that began with his introduction in "<a href="Sonic%20Adventure%202">Sonic Adventure 2</a>". Director <a href="Takashi%20Iizuka%20%28game%20designer%29">Takashi Iizuka</a>, who targeted a younger audience with previous "Sonic" games, strove to attract an older audience with "Shadow the Hedgehog"; Shadow's darker character also allowed the team to use elements otherwise inappropriate for the series. The game was revealed at the March 2005 <a href="Walk%20of%20Game">Walk of Game</a> event, and was released for the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a>, <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>, and <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> <a href="video%20game%20console">video game console</a>s in November 2005.

"Shadow the Hedgehog" received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, who disliked its controls, plot, and dark themes, and took particular issue with the addition of guns and other weapons to traditional "Sonic" gameplay. However, some praised its <a href="replay%20value">replay value</a> and it went on to become a commercial success, selling 2.06 million copies by March 2007.

"Shadow the Hedgehog" is a <a href="platform%20game">platform game</a> that incorporates elements of <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> gameplay. Like previous games in the "Sonic" series, basic gameplay involves running quickly, collecting <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28series%29%23Rings">rings</a>, and destroying enemies. Shadow collects rings as a form of health; when he is attacked by an enemy, ten of his rings bounce away from him in all directions. If he is hit by an enemy while not having any rings, he loses a life. Each level is completed by undertaking a mission, and each mission is labeled "Hero," "Dark," or "Normal." The "Hero" missions involve completing tasks for the "Sonic" series' heroic characters, or <a href="Doctor%20Eggman">Doctor Eggman</a> on one occasion, and the "Dark" missions involve completing tasks for the Black Arms or Doctor Eggman. The "Normal" missions involve reaching the Chaos Emerald or goal at the end of the level. Examples of non-neutral mission objectives include killing all enemies in the levels, destroying an aircraft flying to the end of the level, or activating or destroying objects in the level. All enemies attack Shadow regardless of the mission chosen. The mission types selected affect the plot, the levels played, and the ending received out of ten possibilities. Each level features <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s that advance the story, and several levels also feature <a href="Boss%20%28video%20games%29">boss battles</a>. There are 326 possible paths to take in "Shadow the Hedgehog", and each pathway is individually named.
New gameplay features distinguish "Shadow the Hedgehog" from previous "Sonic" games. For example, Shadow can use guns to combat enemies, adding an element of <a href="third-person%20shooter">third-person shooter</a> gameplay. Parts of the scenery, such as <a href="traffic%20sign">traffic sign</a>s, can also be used as weapons. Another new feature is the ability to drive vehicles, such as <a href="motorcycle">motorcycle</a>s and alien aircraft. Although Shadow can outrun the game's vehicles, the latter have unique capabilities, such as crushing enemies and traversing otherwise impassible acid-covered areas.

As in most "Sonic" series games, the Chaos Emeralds play a major role; they help Shadow remember his past and allow him to perform Chaos Control and Chaos Blast. Chaos Control allows Shadow to move more quickly in levels and slows time in boss battles, and Chaos Blast creates an explosion that destroys or severely damages all nearby enemies. Shadow can perform Chaos Control after the player fills the Hero Gauge by defeating Black Arms soldiers, and he can perform Chaos Blast after filling the Dark Gauge by defeating G.U.N. soldiers.

The game includes a <a href="two-player%20video%20game">two-player mode</a> that retains the single-player mechanics but is set in one of three specially designed stages and uses a vertically <a href="split%20screen%20%28computer%20graphics%29">split screen</a> to separate each player's view. Each player chooses one of the available characters—Shadow, two metallic versions of him, and <a href="palette%20swap">palette-swapped</a> variants of each. The combatants attack each other and steal each other's rings until all but one are eliminated. Additionally, in single-player mode, a second player may take control of Shadow's sidekick character in some stages.

Shadow the Hedgehog, the game's titular protagonist, was created 50 years before the game's events by <a href="Professor%20Gerald%20Robotnik">Professor Gerald Robotnik</a> in an orbital military research <a href="space%20station">space colony</a> known as the ARK. Robotnik was trying to unlock the secrets of eternal life on the government's orders and create the "Ultimate Life Form." To that end, Robotnik designed Shadow to harness the powers of the Chaos Emeralds. At the end of "<a href="Sonic%20Adventure%202">Sonic Adventure 2</a>", his first in-game appearance, Shadow was presumed dead, but he returned in "<a href="Sonic%20Heroes">Sonic Heroes</a>" with <a href="amnesia">amnesia</a> that persists into the events of "Shadow the Hedgehog".

The Guardian Units of Nations (G.U.N.) is the military of Earth's government, the United Federation, and it is directed by the G.U.N. Commander. When completing "Hero" missions, Shadow usually helps G.U.N. and heroic characters from the "Sonic" series, including <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28character%29">Sonic</a>, <a href="Tails%20%28character%29">Tails</a>, <a href="Knuckles%20the%20Echidna">Knuckles</a>, <a href="Amy%20Rose">Amy</a>, <a href="Rouge%20the%20Bat">Rouge</a>, <a href="E-123%20Omega">Omega</a>, <a href="Vector%20the%20Crocodile">Vector</a>, <a href="Charmy%20Bee">Charmy</a>, and <a href="Espio%20the%20Chameleon">Espio</a>. Their aim is to protect Earth from both Doctor Eggman and the Black Arms, an army of various related alien species that invade Earth from the Black Comet. Black Doom, the leader of the Black Arms, sends an extension of himself called "Doom's Eye" to watch Shadow and help him complete missions. When completing "Dark" missions, Shadow helps either Black Doom or Doctor Eggman, each of whom wants the Chaos Emeralds for himself. In one "Hero" mission of Sky Troops, Shadow assists Doctor Eggman in battling the Black Arms.

At the beginning of the game, Shadow suffers from amnesia. Other than the events of "<a href="Sonic%20Heroes">Sonic Heroes</a>" that took place three months prior, Shadow remembers only two things: his name and his attempt to escape the space colony ARK with his creator's granddaughter <a href="Maria%20Robotnik">Maria</a>, who was killed by <a href="G.U.N.%20soldiers">G.U.N. soldiers</a>. Having walked through a room filled with androids that looked like him during the events of "Sonic Heroes", Shadow wonders if he too is an android. The game starts with Shadow reminiscing outside the city of Westopolis when the alien race Black Arms drops out of the sky and invades the city. One Black Arms alien, Doom's Eye, approaches Shadow, and the Black Arms's leader Black Doom tells Shadow of an old agreement Shadow made: to bring Black Doom the Chaos Emeralds. Stunned that Black Doom knew his name, Shadow searches for the Chaos Emeralds to learn about his past.

The game progresses through the Westopolis level and five more levels from the different paths Shadow may take. As missions are completed, Shadow learns more about his past and regains memories. He can choose to help Doctor Eggman or the Black Arms, to help G.U.N. and the series' heroic characters, or to help neither and keep the Chaos Emeralds for himself. The missions completed determine which one of ten possible endings will be seen after Shadow collects all the Chaos Emeralds and defeats one of the game's final bosses. The possible ending events range from planning to defeat the Black Arms to planning to destroy the planet.

Completing all ten endings unlocks the game's true ending in which Black Doom uses Chaos Control, enhanced by the power of all seven Chaos Emeralds, to bring the Black Comet to the Earth's surface. Black Doom explains that the Black Arms intend to use humans as an energy source, and the Black Comet begins to release a nerve gas into the Earth's atmosphere that causes total paralysis in those who inhale it. Shadow confronts Black Doom after the "Last Way" level, where he discovers that Professor Gerald Robotnik created the ARK's Eclipse Cannon weapon to destroy the Black Comet. During their confrontation, Black Doom reveals that Shadow was created using Black Doom's blood, and he attempts to use <a href="mind%20control">mind control</a> on Shadow, but fails. Black Doom then transforms into a giant called Devil Doom; in response, Shadow uses the Chaos Emeralds to transform into Super Shadow and confronts Devil Doom. During the battle, Doctor Eggman confirms to Shadow that he is the original and not an android. Shadow defeats Devil Doom and uses Chaos Control to teleport the Black Comet back into Earth's orbit, where he obliterates it using the Eclipse Cannon. His friends are elated, as are people at G.U.N. headquarters. Shadow is then shown in the ARK's control room holding up a photograph of Maria and Gerald. He discards the photograph and leaves the room, deciding to put the past behind him and move on.

"Shadow the Hedgehog" was developed by <a href="Sega%20Studios%20USA">Sega Studios USA</a>, the now-defunct United States division of <a href="Sega">Sega</a>'s <a href="Sonic%20Team">Sonic Team</a>, and published by Sega. Sega first revealed the game and its tagline ("Hero or villain? You decide.") at the March 8, 2005 inauguration of <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28character%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> into the <a href="Walk%20of%20Game">Walk of Game</a>. Sega formally announced development of the game for the <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a>, <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>, and <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> video game consoles on March 23, 2005. The same year, Sega released the game in North America on November 15, in Europe on November 18, and in Japan on December 15.

Sonic Team's <a href="Takashi%20Iizuka%20%28game%20designer%29">Takashi Iizuka</a>, who had worked on the "Sonic the Hedgehog" series since 1993, targeted a younger audience with previous "Sonic" games and wanted to attract an older audience with "Shadow the Hedgehog". The game's development team wanted to make a game featuring Shadow to resolve plot mysteries that began with the character's introduction in "Sonic Adventure 2". The team felt that Shadow's design—inspired by films such as "<a href="Underworld%20%282003%20film%29">Underworld</a>", "<a href="Constantine%20%28film%29">Constantine</a>", and the <a href="Terminator%20%28franchise%29">"Terminator" series</a>—would make the story darker and allow for elements, such as vehicles and weapons, otherwise considered inappropriate for a "Sonic" game. Sonic Team's <a href="Yuji%20Naka">Yuji Naka</a> stated in an interview with <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> that he wanted to use Shadow as the game's main character due to his popularity among fans and being the best fit for a "gun action" game. The game features several <a href="computer%20animation">CG-animated</a> cutscenes produced by <a href="Blur%20Studio">Blur Studio</a>. The game also contains profanities, including instances of "damn" and "hell" spoken by Shadow and other characters such as Espio, the G.U.N. Commander, Knuckles, and Sonic. Profanity and the use of guns, both firsts for the "Sonic" series, generated pre-release controversy. The <a href="Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board">ESRB</a> assigned the game a rating of E10+ for "fantasy violence" and "mild language".

The music of "Shadow the Hedgehog" was composed by <a href="Jun%20Senoue">Jun Senoue</a>, Yutaka Minobe, <a href="Tomoya%20Ohtani">Tomoya Ohtani</a>, and <a href="Mariko%20Nanba">Mariko Nanba</a>. "Lost and Found: Shadow the Hedgehog Vocal Trax" is a <a href="video%20game%20soundtrack">video game soundtrack</a> album released on CD on February 22, 2006. The album contains seven vocal songs from the game, one of which is a remix rather than the original. Another soundtrack, "Shadow the Hedgehog: Original Soundtrax", was also released on February 22, 2006. It contains both vocal and instrumental tracks from the game. The game was the first in the "Sonic" series to use the <a href="4Kids%20Entertainment">4Kids</a> cast from "<a href="Sonic%20X">Sonic X</a>" following the death of Doctor Eggman's previous voice actor, Deem Bristow. This cast continued to be used until late 2010 when all cast members except for <a href="Mike%20Pollock%20%28voice%20actor%29">Mike Pollock</a> were replaced before the release of "<a href="Sonic%20Free%20Riders">Sonic Free Riders</a>".

"Shadow the Hedgehog" received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, many of which were highly critical of its gameplay mechanics and differences from other "Sonic" games. However, it was voted the best game of 2005 in the "<a href="Official%20Jetix%20Magazine">Official Jetix Magazine</a>" Reader Awards and named the "Best Platformer" of 2005 by "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" readers (receiving more votes than the staff's choice, "<a href="Sonic%20Rush">Sonic Rush</a>"). "Shadow the Hedgehog" was also a commercial success: Sega reported 1.59 million units sold from its release to March 2006 and 470,000 units sold in the U.S. from March 2006 to March 2007, for total sales of at least 2.06 million. The game was later released as a part of three budget lines: <a href="List%20of%20Sony%20Greatest%20Hits%20games">Greatest Hits</a> and <a href="Platinum%20Range">Platinum Range</a> for the PlayStation 2 (representing sales of at least 400,000 in North America and Europe, respectively) and <a href="Player%27s%20Choice">Player's Choice</a> for the GameCube (250,000 in North America).

Many critics derided the game's sense of maturity for a "Sonic" game, especially the addition of guns and other weapons. "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" staff writer Matt Helgeson said, "not only is this new 'adult' interpretation of Sonic painfully dumb, it’s also ill-advised and almost feels like a betrayal to longtime fans." <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> staff writer Tom Bramwell felt that "the game's other selling point – its darker edge – [is] not really meant for us." <a href="G4%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">G4</a>'s "<a href="X-Play">X-Play</a>" and <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> staff writer Patrick Klepek thought similarly. In contrast, "Nintendo Power" staff writer Steve Thomason rated the game 8.0 out of 10, stating, "this darker take on the Sonic universe succeeds for the most part, giving the series a bit of an edge without going overboard on violence." In addition, "<a href="Official%20Xbox%20Magazine">Official Xbox Magazine</a>" reassured readers, "Don't worry, "Shadow the Hedgehog" isn't half as 'urban' or quite as 'gangsta' as it first seems." Hegelson panned the game's "laughable" plot, saying it "makes no sense," and that various "Sonic" conventions undermined its attempts to be "mature" or "edgy".

Reviewers also criticized the game's controls, especially Shadow's homing attack causing unexpected character deaths. "Game Informer"s Matt Helgeson complained that the attack "frequently sends you careening off into nothingness, resulting in cheap death after cheap death." "Nintendo Power", "X-Play", Eurogamer, "Official Xbox Magazine", and GameSpy agreed. Other complaints focused on the mechanics of weapons and vehicles. Greg Mueller of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> felt that the guns were nearly useless because of a lack of a target lock or manual aim, combined with an ineffective auto-aim. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> staff writer <a href="Matt%20Casamassina">Matt Casamassina</a>, <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> staff writer Greg Sewart, "Game Informer", "X-Play", GameSpy, and <a href="London">London</a>'s "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" also criticized the mechanics of Shadow's weapons, vehicles, and other aspects of the game's controls. However, Thomason said that "blasting Shadow's foes with the wide variety of weapons at his disposal is just plain fun."

The <a href="level%20design">level design</a> received mixed comments. Mueller called some levels "extremely frustrating". Helgeson stated that the fast-paced "levels are poorly designed", and Andrew Reiner, who wrote a second-opinion review for "Game Informer", called the level design "disastrous". "Official Xbox Magazine" was more mixed, balancing the possibility of getting lost in the large levels with the likely appeal of these stages to 3D "Sonic" gamers, particularly those who had enjoyed "<a href="Sonic%20Heroes">Sonic Heroes</a>". GameTrailers found that "the levels are either dark and urban, or bright and psychedelic. Either way, they fit in well to the "Sonic" universe. They are loaded with speed ramps, loops and an assortment of other boosts that rocket Shadow like a pinball." Bettenhausen included "the classic run-like-hell roller coaster design philosophy" of some stages in his limited praise. Casamassina disliked the "stupid level design", saying that "[j]ust because they dazzled players six years ago does not mean that Sonic Team can copy and paste exactly the same loops and spins into each new franchise iteration and expect everyone to be happy with the outcome." GameSpy observed that "the areas are much less open than in previous "Sonic" games, but the level designers haven't taken advantage of the constraints." "Nintendo Power" singled out the difficulty of the missions that require the player to locate objects.

Critics praised the game's replay value, applauding the many possible paths that a player may take through the game. GameTrailers stated, "this choose-your-own-adventure style gives the game replay value that many platformers lack." The <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Australia, publication "<a href="Herald%20Sun">Herald Sun</a>", "Nintendo Power", and "Official Xbox Magazine" thought similarly. GameSpot praised the variety of alternate endings, but concluded that "the gameplay isn't fun enough to warrant playing the game through multiple times." Bettenhausen thought that the morality system felt artificial, but said that it extended the game's replay value.

G. Ledyard Stebbins

George Ledyard Stebbins Jr. (January 6, 1906 – January 19, 2000) was an American <a href="botany">botanist</a> and <a href="geneticist">geneticist</a> who is widely regarded as one of the leading <a href="evolutionary%20biology">evolutionary biologists</a> of the 20th century. Stebbins received his Ph.D. in botany from <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> in 1931. He went on to the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>, where his work with <a href="E.%20B.%20Babcock">E. B. Babcock</a> on the genetic evolution of plant <a href="species">species</a>, and his association with a group of evolutionary biologists known as the <a href="Bay%20Area%20Biosystematists">Bay Area Biosystematists</a>, led him to develop a comprehensive synthesis of plant evolution incorporating genetics.

His most important publication was "<a href="Variation%20and%20Evolution%20in%20Plants">Variation and Evolution in Plants</a>", which combined <a href="genetics">genetics</a> and <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Darwin's</a> theory of <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a> to describe plant <a href="speciation">speciation</a>. It is regarded as one of the main publications which formed the core of the <a href="Modern%20synthesis%20%2820th%20century%29">modern synthesis</a> and still provides the conceptual framework for research in plant evolutionary biology; according to <a href="Ernst%20Mayr">Ernst Mayr</a>, "Few later works dealing with the evolutionary systematics of plants have not been very deeply affected by Stebbins' work." He also researched and wrote widely on the role of <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridization</a> and <a href="polyploidy">polyploidy</a> in speciation and plant evolution; his work in this area has had a lasting influence on research in the field.

From 1960, Stebbins was instrumental in the establishment of the Department of Genetics at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Davis">University of California, Davis</a>, and was active in numerous organizations involved in the promotion of evolution, and of science in general. He was elected to the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Science">National Academy of Science</a>, was awarded the <a href="National%20Medal%20of%20Science">National Medal of Science</a>, and was involved in the development of evolution-based science programs for California high schools, as well as the conservation of rare plants in that state.

Stebbins was born in <a href="Lawrence%2C%20St.%20Lawrence%20County%2C%20New%20York">Lawrence, New York</a>, the youngest of three children. His parents were George Ledyard Stebbins, a wealthy real estate financier who developed <a href="Mount%20Desert%2C%20Maine">Seal Harbor, Maine</a> and helped to establish <a href="Acadia%20National%20Park">Acadia National Park</a>, and Edith Alden Candler Stebbins; both parents were native New Yorkers and <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America">Episcopalian</a>s. Stebbins was known throughout his life as Ledyard, to distinguish himself from his father. The family encouraged their sons' interest in natural history during their periodic journeys to Seal Harbor. In 1914, Edith contracted <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> and the Stebbins moved to <a href="Santa%20Barbara%2C%20California">Santa Barbara, California</a> to improve her health. In California, Stebbins was enrolled at the <a href="Cate%20School">Cate School</a> in <a href="Carpinteria%2C%20California">Carpinteria</a> where he became influenced by <a href="Ralph%20Hoffmann">Ralph Hoffmann</a>, an American <a href="natural%20history">natural history</a> instructor and amateur <a href="ornithology">ornithologist</a> and <a href="botany">botanist</a>. After graduating from high school, he embarked on a major in political studies at <a href="Harvard">Harvard</a>. By the third year of his undergraduate study, he had decided to major in <a href="botany">botany</a>.

Stebbins started graduate studies at Harvard in 1928, initially working on flowering <a href="plant%20taxonomy">plant taxonomy</a> and <a href="biogeography">biogeography</a>—particularly that of the flora of New England—with <a href="Merritt%20Lyndon%20Fernald">Merritt Lyndon Fernald</a>. He completed his <a href="Master%20of%20Arts">MA</a> in 1929 and continued to work toward his <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Ph.D.</a> He became interested in using <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s for taxonomic studies, a method that Fernald did not support. Stebbins chose to concentrate his doctoral work on the <a href="cell%20biology">cytology</a> of plant reproductive processes in the genus "<a href="Antennaria">Antennaria</a>", with cytologist <a href="E.%20C.%20Jeffrey">E. C. Jeffrey</a> as his supervisor and Fernald on his supervisory panel. During his Ph.D. candidature, Stebbins sought advice and supervision from geneticist <a href="Karl%20Sax">Karl Sax</a>. Sax identified several errors in Stebbins's work and disapproved of his interpretation of results that, while in accordance with Jeffrey's views, were inconsistent with the work of contemporary geneticists. Jeffrey and Sax argued over Stebbins's dissertation, and the thesis was revised numerous times to accommodate their differing views.

Stebbins's Ph.D. was granted by Harvard in 1931. In March that year, he married Margaret Chamberlin, with whom he had three children. In 1932, he took a teaching position in biology at <a href="Colgate%20University">Colgate University</a>. While at Colgate, he continued his work in cytogenetics; in particular, he continued to study the genetics of "Antennaria" and began to study the behaviour of chromosomes in hybrid <a href="peony">peonies</a> bred by biologist Percy Saunders. Saunders and Stebbins attended the 1932 International Congress of Genetics in Ithaca, New York. Here, Stebbins's interest was captured by talks given by <a href="Thomas%20Hunt%20Morgan">Thomas Hunt Morgan</a> and <a href="Barbara%20McClintock">Barbara McClintock</a>, who spoke about <a href="chromosomal%20crossover">chromosomal crossover</a>. Stebbins reproduced McClintock's crossover experiments in the peony, and published several papers on the cytogenetics of "Paeonia", which established his reputation as a geneticist.

In 1935, Stebbins was offered a genetics research position at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> working with geneticist <a href="E.%20B.%20Babcock">E. B. Babcock</a>. Babcock needed assistance with a large <a href="Rockefeller%20Foundation">Rockefeller</a>-funded project characterizing the genetics and evolutionary processes of plants from the genus "<a href="Crepis">Crepis</a>" and was interested in developing "Crepis" into a <a href="model%20organism">model plant</a>, to enable genetic investigations similar to those possible in the model insect "<a href="Drosophila%20melanogaster">Drosophila melanogaster</a>". Like the genera that Stebbins had previously studied, "Crepis" commonly hybridized, displayed <a href="polyploidy">polyploidy</a> (chromosome doubling), and could make seed without fertilization (a process known as <a href="apomixis">apomixis</a>). The collaboration between Babcock and Stebbins produced numerous papers and two <a href="monograph">monograph</a>s. The first monograph, published in 1937, resulted in splitting off the Asiatic "Crepis" species into the genus "<a href="Youngia">Youngia</a>". The second, published in 1938, was titled "The American Species of Crepis: their interrelationships and distribution as affected by polyploidy and apomixis".

In "The American Species of Crepis", Babcock and Stebbins described the concept of the <a href="polyploid%20complex">polyploid complex</a>, and its role in plant evolution. Some genera, such as "Crepis", have a complex of reproductive forms that center on sexually diploid populations that have also given rise to polyploid ones. Babcock and Stebbins also observed that <a href="Polyploidy%23Allopolyploidy">allopolyploid</a> types formed from the hybridization of two different species always have a wider distribution than diploid or <a href="Polyploidy%23Autopolyploidy">autotetraploid</a> species, and proposed that polyploids formed through hybridization have a greater potential to exploit varied environments, because they inherit all traits from both parents. They also showed that hybridization in the polyploid complex could provide a mechanism for genetic exchange between diploid species that were otherwise unable to breed. Their observations offered insight into species formation and knowledge of how all these complex processes could provide information on the <a href="phylogeny">history</a> of a genus. This monograph was described by Swedish botanist <a href="%C3%85ke%20Gustafsson">Åke Gustafsson</a> as the most important work on the formation of species during that period.

Stebbins's review, "The significance of polyploidy in plant evolution", published in "<a href="American%20Naturalist">American Naturalist</a>" in 1940, demonstrated how work done on artificial polyploids and natural polyploid complexes had shown that polyploidy was important in developing large, complex, and widespread genera. However, by looking at the history of polyploidy in plant <a href="family%20%28biology%29">families</a>, he argued that polyploidy was only common in herbaceous <a href="Perennial%20plant">perennials</a> and infrequent in woody plants and <a href="Annual%20plant">annuals</a>. As such, polyploids played a conservative role in evolution since problems with fertility prevented the acquisition and replication of new genetic material that might lead to a new line of evolution. This work continued with the 1947 paper "Types of polyploids: their classification and significance", which detailed a system for the classification of polyploids and described Stebbins' ideas about the role of <a href="Polyploidy%23Paleopolyploidy">paleopolyploidy</a> in angiosperm evolution, where he argued that chromosome number may be a useful tool for the construction of phylogenies. These reviews were highly influential and provided a basis for others to study the role of polyploidy in evolution.

In 1939, with Babcock's support, Stebbins was made a full professor in the Department of Genetics at UC Berkeley, after the Department of Botany failed to promote him. Stebbins was required to teach a course on evolution, and during his preparation he became excited by contemporary research combining genetics and evolution. He became associated with a group known as the <a href="Bay%20Area%20Biosystematists">Bay Area Biosystematists</a>, which included botanist <a href="Jens%20Clausen">Jens Clausen</a>, taxonomist <a href="David%20D.%20Keck">David D. Keck</a>, physiologist <a href="William%20Hiesey">William Hiesey</a> and the evolutionary geneticist <a href="Theodosius%20Dobzhansky">Theodosius Dobzhansky</a>. During this time he also became friends with the botanist <a href="Herbert%20G.%20Baker">Herbert Baker</a>. With the encouragement of this group of scientists, Stebbins directed his research towards evolution. He became involved with the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Study%20of%20Evolution">Society for the Study of Evolution</a> in 1946, and was one of the few botanists involved with the new organization.

His research on plant evolution also progressed during this period; he worked on the genetics of forage grasses, looking at polyploidy and the evolution of the <a href="Poaceae">Poaceae</a> and publishing numerous papers on the subject though the 1940s. He produced an artificial autotetraploid grass from the diploid species "<a href="Ehrharta%20erecta">Ehrharta erecta</a>" through treatment with the chromosome doubling agent <a href="colchicine">colchicine</a>. He was able to establish the plant in the field, and after 39 years of field trials was able to show that the autopolyploid was not as successful as its diploid parent in an unchanging environment.

<a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>'s Jesup Lectures were the starting point for many of the most important works of the <a href="Modern%20synthesis%20%2820th%20century%29">modern evolutionary synthesis</a>. The presenters introduced the connection between two important discoveries—the units of evolution (<a href="gene">gene</a>s) with <a href="natural%20selection">selection</a> as the primary mechanism of evolution. In 1941, <a href="Edgar%20Anderson">Edgar Anderson</a> (whose work on hybridization in the genus "<a href="Iris%20%28plant%29">Iris</a>" had interested Stebbins since they met in 1930) and <a href="Ernst%20Mayr">Ernst Mayr</a> co-presented the lecture series and Mayr later published his lectures as "<a href="Systematics%20and%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">Systematics and the Origin of Species</a>". In 1946, Stebbins was invited on Dobzhansky's recommendation to present the prestigious lectures. Stebbins' lectures drew together the otherwise disparate fields of genetics, ecology, systematics, cytology, and paleontology. In 1950, these lectures were published as "<a href="Variation%20and%20Evolution%20in%20Plants">Variation and Evolution in Plants</a>", which proved to be one of the most important books in 20th-century botany. The book brought botanical science into the new synthesis of evolutionary theory, and became part of the canon of biological works written between 1936 and 1950 that formed the modern synthesis of evolution.

"Variation and Evolution in Plants" was the first book to provide a wide-ranging explanation of how evolutionary mechanisms operated in plants at the genetic level. It brought concepts related to plant evolution into line with animal evolution as it emerged from Dobzhansky's 1937 "<a href="Genetics%20and%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">Genetics and the Origin of Species</a>" and provided the conceptual framework to organize a disparate set of disciplines into a new field: plant evolutionary biology. In the book Stebbins argued that evolution needed to be studied as a dynamic problem and that evolution must be considered on three levels: first, that of individual <a href="Genetic%20variation">variation</a> within an interbreeding population; second, that of the <a href="population%20genetics">distribution and frequency</a> of this variation; and third, that of the separation and divergence of populations as the result of the building up of isolating mechanisms leading to the formation of species. He used the work of biosystematists Clausen, Keck, Hiesey, and <a href="G%C3%B6te%20Turesson">Turesson</a> to show that it was possible to distinguish between <a href="genotype">genotypic</a> and <a href="phenotype">phenotypic</a> variation—that is, genetically identical plants could have different phenotypes in different environments. One of the book's most original chapters used the cytogenetics work of <a href="C.%20D.%20Darlington">C. D. Darlington</a> to show that genetic systems like hybridization and polyploidy were also subject to selection.

The book offered few original hypotheses, but Stebbins hoped that by summarising the available research on plant evolution the book would "help to open the way towards a deeper understanding of evolutionary problems and more fruitful research in the direction of their solution." The book effectively ended any serious belief in alternative mechanisms of evolution in plants, such as <a href="Lamarckism">Lamarckian evolution</a> or <a href="soft%20inheritance">soft inheritance</a>, which were still upheld by some botanists. Following that publication, Stebbins was regarded as an expert on modern evolutionary theory and is widely credited with the founding of the science of plant evolutionary biology. "Variation and Evolution in Plants" continues to be widely cited in contemporary scientific botanical literature more than 50 years after its publication.

Stebbins regarded his contribution to the modern synthesis as the application of genetic principles already established by other workers to botany. "I didn't add any new elements [to the modern synthetic theory] to speak of. I just modified things so that people could understand how things were in the plant world."

Stebbins took an appointment at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Davis">University of California, Davis</a> in 1950, where he was a key figure in the establishment of the University's Department of Genetics; he was the department's first chairman and held the position from 1958 to 1963. At Davis, the focus of his research changed to incorporate newer areas, such as <a href="developmental%20biology">developmental morphology</a> and <a href="genetics">genetics</a> in crop plants, including <a href="barley">barley</a>. He continued to publish widely and extensively on plant evolution, writing over 200 papers and several books after 1950.

Stebbins and Edgar Anderson wrote a paper in 1954 on the importance of hybridization in adapting to new environments. They proposed novel adaptations would facilitate the invasion of habitats not utilized previously by either parent and that novel adaptations may facilitate the formation of stabilized hybrid species. Following this paper, Stebbins developed the first model of <a href="adaptive%20radiation">adaptive radiation</a>. He proposed that a high degree of genetic variability was necessary for major evolutionary advances, that because of slow mutation rates, <a href="genetic%20recombination">genetic recombination</a> was the most likely source of this variation, and that variation could be maximised though hybridization. As of 2006, research is ongoing regarding whether hybridization is an accidental consequence of evolution or if it is necessary for the creation and evolution of plant species; it has been argued that contemporary studies are part of an intellectual lineage that started with the work of Stebbins and Anderson.

Stebbins wrote several books during his time at UC Davis. These included his follow-up to "Variation and Evolution", "", which was published in 1974, following his delivery of the Prather Lectures at Harvard. Stebbins discusses the origins, genetics and developmental biology of the <a href="angiosperm">angiosperm</a>s. He argues for the role of adaptive radiation in the diversification of the angiosperms and the usefulness of applying our current understanding of species' genetics and ecology to gain knowledge about the evolution of ancient species. He also wrote "Processes of Organic Evolution", "The Basis of Progressive Evolution", "Chromosomal Evolution in Plants" and the textbook "Evolution" with co-authors Dobzhansky, <a href="Francisco%20J.%20Ayala">Francisco Ayala</a> and <a href="James%20W.%20Valentine">James W. Valentine</a>. His last book, "Darwin to DNA, Molecules to Humanity" was published in 1982.

Stebbins was passionate about teaching evolution, advocating during the 1960s and 70s the teaching of Darwinian evolution in public schools. He worked closely with the <a href="Biological%20Sciences%20Curriculum%20Study">Biological Sciences Curriculum Study</a> to develop high school curricula based on evolution as the central unifying principle in biology. He also opposed scientific creationism groups. Stebbins was active in numerous science organizations—including the International Union of Biological Sciences, the Western Society of Naturalists, the Botanical Society of America, and the Society for the Study of Evolution—and served as President of the American Society of Naturalists. He was elected to the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a> in 1952. Stebbins received numerous awards for his contributions to science: the <a href="National%20Medal%20of%20Science">National Medal of Science</a>, the Gold Medal from the <a href="Linnean%20Society%20of%20London">Linnean Society of London</a>, the Addison Emery Verrill Medal from the Yale <a href="Peabody%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Peabody Museum of Natural History</a>, and the John Frederick Lewis Award from the <a href="American%20Philosophical%20Society">American Philosophical Society</a>. He was elected a Fellow of the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a> in 1952. He was awarded the 1983 <a href="Leidy%20Award">Leidy Award</a> from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.

Stebbins was active in conservation issues in California during his later life. He established a <a href="California%20Native%20Plant%20Society">California Native Plant Society</a> branch in Sacramento in the early 1960s. Through the society, he created an active field trip program to increase interest in the native flora of California and to document rare plants. Stebbins was the state President of the Society during 1966. The society was instrumental in preventing the destruction of a beach on the <a href="Monterey%2C%20California">Monterey Peninsula</a> that he referred to as "Evolution Hill"—the area is now known as the S.F.B. Morse Botanical Area and is managed by the Del Monte Forest Foundation. He was a major contributor to the Society's 1996 book "California's Wild Gardens: A Living Legacy". Stebbins was instrumental in the establishment of the "Inventory of Rare and Endangered Vascular Plants of California" by the California Native Plant Society; it is still used by state and federal bodies in the United States for conservation policy-making. Stebbins was also a member of the <a href="Sierra%20Club">Sierra Club</a>.

During his tenure at UC Davis, he trained more than 30 graduate students in genetics, developmental biology and agricultural science. In 1973, Stebbins gave his last lectures at UC Davis and was made <a href="professor%20emeritus">professor emeritus</a>. Following his retirement, he travelled widely, taught, and visited colleagues for the next 20 years. His last paper, "A brief summary of my ideas on evolution", was published in the "<a href="American%20Journal%20of%20Botany">American Journal of Botany</a>" in 1999. The same year he was co-recipient with Ernst Mayr of the Distinguished Service award from the American Institute of Biological Sciences. A colloquium was held by the National Academies of Science in 2000 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the publication of "Variation and Evolution in Plants". Stebbins died in his home in Davis the same year from a cancer-related illness. Stebbins was honored at a <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> memorial service—he had been active in the church in his later years following his 1958 marriage to his second wife, Barbara Monaghan Stebbins. His ashes were scattered at <a href="Stebbins%20Cold%20Canyon%20Reserve">Stebbins Cold Canyon Reserve</a>.

Stebbins made an enormous contribution to scientific thought and botany by developing an intellectual framework for studying plant evolution including modern concepts of plant species and plant speciation. His contributions to the literature of plant evolutionary biology, in addition to his seven books, include more than 280 journal articles and book chapters, a compilation of which were published in 2004—"The Scientific Papers of G. Ledyard Stebbins (1929–2000)" (). Betty Smocovitis, a historian of science who is preparing a book-length biography on Stebbins, described Stebbins's scientific contribution as follows:
In science as in everything, small-scale synthesizers usually get credit from all constituent parties, but truly great synthesizers can fall between the cracks in the cycle of scientific credit. Ledyard Stebbins was in the latter category; neither fish nor fowl, he frequently failed to receive credit for work in some areas, usually at the hands of narrower colleagues. Few, however, have challenged his contributions to plant evolutionary biology, nor questioned his ability to synthesize disparate literature into a coherent framework. His ability to read quickly, recognize novel insights, digest new material, and then integrate the knowledge were the hallmarks of his scientific work style. He was a masterful synthesizer and master of the review essay or synthetic thought piece.

In 1980, the University of California, Davis, named a parcel of land near <a href="Lake%20Berryessa">Lake Berryessa</a>, California, the <a href="Stebbins%20Cold%20Canyon%20Reserve">Stebbins Cold Canyon Reserve</a> in recognition of his contributions to conservation and evolutionary science. The reserve is part of the <a href="University%20of%20California%20Natural%20Reserve%20System">University of California Natural Reserve System</a>. The UC Davis Herbarium maintains a G. Ledyard Stebbins student grant program, established in celebration of his 90th birthday.

California State Route 78

State Route 78 (SR 78) is a <a href="state%20highway">state highway</a> in the U.S. state of <a href="California">California</a> that runs from <a href="Oceanside%2C%20California">Oceanside</a> east to <a href="Blythe%2C%20California">Blythe</a>, traversing nearly the entire width of the state. Its western terminus is at <a href="Interstate%205%20%28California%29">Interstate 5</a> (I-5) in <a href="San%20Diego%20County%2C%20California">San Diego County</a> and its eastern terminus is at <a href="Interstate%2010%20%28California%29">I-10</a> in <a href="Riverside%20County%2C%20California">Riverside County</a>. The route is a freeway through the heavily populated cities of northern San Diego County and a two-lane highway running through the <a href="Cuyamaca%20Mountains">Cuyamaca Mountains</a> to <a href="Julian%2C%20California">Julian</a>. In <a href="Imperial%20County%2C%20California">Imperial County</a>, SR 78 travels through the desert near the <a href="Salton%20Sea">Salton Sea</a> and passes through the city of <a href="Brawley%2C%20California">Brawley</a> before turning north and passing through an area of sand dunes on the way to its terminus in Blythe.

SR 78 was one of the original state highways designated in 1934, although portions of the route existed as early as 1900. However, it was not designated east of Brawley until 1959. The freeway section in the <a href="San%20Diego%20North%20County%2C%20California">North County</a> of <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> that connects Oceanside and <a href="Escondido%2C%20California">Escondido</a> was built in the middle of the twentieth century in several stages, including a transitory stage known as the Vista Way Freeway, and has been improved several times. An expressway bypass of the city of Brawley was completed in 2012. There are many projects slated to improve the freeway due to increasing congestion in the region.

SR 78 begins in Oceanside as a continuation of Vista Way. As it encounters a traffic signal and crosses over I-5, the route becomes a suburban freeway traveling east through Oceanside. The freeway loosely parallels Buena Vista Creek before entering the city of <a href="Vista%2C%20California">Vista</a>. Turning southeast, SR 78 continues into the city of <a href="San%20Marcos%2C%20California">San Marcos</a> near <a href="California%20State%20University%20San%20Marcos">California State University San Marcos</a> and enters Escondido, where it has an interchange with <a href="Interstate%2015%20%28California%29">I-15</a>. A 2011 Caltrans study estimated that the average commuter encountered a delay of 10 minutes on the portion from I-5 to I-15. After passing the Center City Parkway (<a href="Interstate%2015%20Business%20%28Escondido%2C%20California%29">I-15 Business</a>) interchange, the freeway abruptly ends at the intersection with Broadway. SR 78 then makes a turn south onto Broadway and continues through downtown Escondido by turning east onto Washington Avenue and south onto Ash Street, which becomes San Pasqual Valley Road.
Turning east once again, SR 78 leaves the Escondido city limits and enters the <a href="San%20Pasqual%20Valley">San Pasqual Valley</a> as it provides access to the <a href="San%20Diego%20Zoo%20Safari%20Park">San Diego Zoo Safari Park</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Pasqual">San Pasqual Battlefield State Park</a>. After leaving the San Pasqual Valley, the road follows a serpentine alignment, heading south to enter the community of <a href="Ramona%2C%20California">Ramona</a> as Pine Street. In Ramona, SR 78 intersects <a href="State%20Route%2067%20%28California%29">SR 67</a> and makes a turn east onto Main Street, going through downtown Ramona. The highway leaves Ramona as Julian Road, which continues on a winding mountain alignment through <a href="Witch%20Creek%2C%20California">Witch Creek</a> to <a href="Santa%20Ysabel%2C%20California">Santa Ysabel</a> where it meets <a href="SR%2079%20%28CA%29">SR 79</a>.

SR 78 runs concurrently with SR 79 across the headwaters of the <a href="San%20Diego%20River">San Diego River</a> and through the hamlet of <a href="Wynola%2C%20California">Wynola</a>, briefly entering <a href="Cleveland%20National%20Forest">Cleveland National Forest</a> before reaching <a href="Julian%2C%20California">Julian</a> and entering the town as Washington Street. The route, still concurrent with SR 79, turns east onto Main Street and travels through downtown Julian before SR 79 diverges south towards <a href="Cuyamaca%2C%20California">Cuyamaca</a> and SR 78 heads northeast as Banner Road. The road intersects with <a href="County%20Route%20S2%20%28California%29">County Route S2</a> (CR S2) at a junction called <a href="Scissors%20Crossing">Scissors Crossing</a>; CR S2 runs concurrently in a <a href="wrong-way%20concurrency">wrong-way concurrency</a>. Shortly afterwards, SR 78 enters Anza-Borrego Desert State Park and is designated as a scenic highway for its length in the state park. Although this route travels many miles south of the town of <a href="Borrego%20Springs%2C%20California">Borrego Springs</a>, it provides access to the town via <a href="CR%20S3%20%28CA%29">CR S3</a>. SR 78 travels through the town of <a href="Ocotillo%20Wells%2C%20California">Ocotillo Wells</a> before exiting the state park and entering <a href="Imperial%20County%2C%20California">Imperial County</a>.
In Imperial County, SR 78 intersects with <a href="SR%2086%20%28CA%29">SR 86</a>, running concurrently with it southwest of the <a href="Salton%20Sea">Salton Sea</a> and northwest of San Felipe Creek. SR 78 passes through the desert community of <a href="Elmore%20Desert%20Ranch%2C%20California">Elmore Desert Ranch</a> before entering the city of <a href="Westmorland%2C%20California">Westmorland</a>. The route, still concurrent with SR 86, enters into the city of <a href="Brawley%2C%20California">Brawley</a> as Main Street, where SR 86 splits to the south towards <a href="El%20Centro%2C%20California">El Centro</a>. SR 78 continues north onto the Brawley Bypass, a freeway that passes to the north of downtown Brawley. <a href="SR%20111%20%28CA%29">SR 111</a> runs concurrently with SR 78 for a short duration before the latter exits from the freeway and continues east.

Then, SR 78 intersects with <a href="State%20Route%20115%20%28California%29">SR 115</a> east of Brawley, running concurrently with it for a brief distance. Shortly after passing through the small community of <a href="Glamis%2C%20California">Glamis</a>, the road turns northeast and eventually north towards Blythe, passing near the <a href="Chocolate%20Mountain%20Aerial%20Gunnery%20Range">Chocolate Mountain Naval Reserve</a>. As it nears the <a href="Colorado%20River">Colorado River</a> and the <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> border, SR 78 briefly passes through <a href="Cibola%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">Cibola National Wildlife Refuge</a> before entering the community of <a href="Palo%20Verde%2C%20California">Palo Verde</a>, where the river turns away from the highway and SR 78 enters <a href="Riverside%20County%2C%20California">Riverside County</a>.
As it nears Blythe, the highway makes a sharp turn east onto 32nd Avenue before turning north on Rannels Boulevard. It makes a right on 28th Avenue before turning north on South Neighbours Boulevard and passing through <a href="Ripley%2C%20California">Ripley</a>. SR 78 continues north for a few more miles to its terminus at I-10, approximately west of the Arizona border. North of I-10, Neighbours Boulevard becomes <a href="Interstate%2010%20Business%20%28Blythe%2C%20California%29">Interstate 10 Business</a> for a block before the <a href="business%20route">business route</a> turns east toward Blythe.

SR 78 is designated as the Ronald Packard Parkway (after a former <a href="Congressman">Congressman</a> named <a href="Ronald%20Packard">Ronald Packard</a> from the area) from I-5 in the city of Oceanside to <a href="Interstate%2015%20in%20California">I-15</a> in the city of Escondido, and Ben Hulse Highway (after a former <a href="California%20Senate">state senator</a> named <a href="Ben%20Hulse">Ben Hulse</a>) from <a href="State%20Route%2086%20%28California%29">SR 86</a> near Brawley to I-10 near the city of <a href="Blythe%2C%20California">Blythe</a>. The portion of SR 78 from SR 86 in Brawley to CR S3 near <a href="Anza-Borrego%20Desert%20State%20Park">Anza-Borrego Desert State Park</a> is designated as part of the <a href="Juan%20Bautista%20de%20Anza%20National%20Historic%20Trail">Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail</a> auto tour route, promoted by the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a>. An informal nickname for the road is "the Hops Highway," referring to the fact that the stretch of SR 78 from Oceanside to Julian passes by one-third of all the <a href="Beer%20in%20San%20Diego%20County%2C%20California">breweries in San Diego County</a>.

SR 78 is part of the <a href="California%20Freeway%20and%20Expressway%20System">California Freeway and Expressway System</a>, although only the metropolitan section of SR 78 is a <a href="freeway">freeway</a>. The section of SR 78 from the western junction of <a href="State%20Route%2079%20%28California%29">SR 79</a> to the western junction with SR 86 is designated by the <a href="California%20State%20Legislature">California State Legislature</a> as eligible by law for the <a href="State%20Scenic%20Highway%20System%20%28California%29">State Scenic Highway System</a>; however, only the section in Anza Borrego Desert State Park has officially been designated by <a href="Caltrans">Caltrans</a> as being part of the system, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a "memorable landscape" with no "visual intrusions", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community; it gained this status in 1971. SR 78 from I-5 to I-15, and from the eastern junction with SR 86 to the eastern junction with SR 111 is part of the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a> (NHS), a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a>. In 2013, SR 78 had an <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a> (AADT) of 670 between the San Diego–Imperial county line and the western SR 86 junction, and 163,000 between Twin Oaks Valley Road and Nordahl Road, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.

The Old Banner Toll Road connected the towns of Julian and Banner in 1871, after a gold rush began in 1870, and eliminated the need to manually lower supplies to gold miners down a slope. The county bought the road from Horace Wilcox in 1874, and removed the toll. The road remained in service until 1925, and remained operational until a flood in the winter season of 1979–1980. By August 1874, a road from Valle de las Viejas to Julian was open and accessible for horse teams. In the meantime, the City of Oceanside began discussions regarding a road east from Oceanside through the San Marcos valley. Efforts to realign the road from Ramona to Julian began in 1892, when a county surveyor examined the prospect of shifting the road away from the Graves hill.

Before the designation of SR 78, a road known as the Brawley-Westmorland-Julian-Oceanside Highway (connecting Oceanside, Escondido, Ramona, Julian, Westmorland, and Brawley) existed during the early twentieth century. This road roughly followed the current routing of SR 78 from Escondido to the east of Brawley, although it traveled along a different routing from Westmorland into Brawley. No road connected Brawley with Glamis in 1919; it was necessary to travel north through <a href="Calipatria%2C%20California">Calipatria</a> to reach Blythe. East of the Sand Hills, there was a road from Glamis passing by Smith Well into Palo Verde, which roughly follows the routing of SR 78.

At this time, when the road from the west into Julian had been approved, many in the community began discussing a road east into the Imperial Valley. There were many proposed alignments besides the one east of Julian through Banner, including through the San Felipe Valley, and the Montezuma Valley. The plan was to construct the Santa Ysabel grade portion as a gravel road, and the rest of the road between <a href="Ballena%2C%20California">Ballena</a> (near Ramona) and Julian as a concrete road. The work to pave the road from Santa Ysabel to Julian was nearing completion in September 1920. Grading was completed by August 1921, and paving work continued, as well as grading on the Santa Ysabel and Julian grades. In 1922, the <a href="Automobile%20Club%20of%20Southern%20California">Automobile Club of Southern California</a> scouting expedition reported that the road from Ramona to Julian was "in excellent condition" though the pavement was poor from Ballena to Santa Ysabel, and under construction just east of Santa Ysabel.

A road from Julian to Kane Springs was completed in 1925. Efforts to include this road extending to Brawley into the state highway system date back from 1927, in order to receive state funding for the road. Plans for a cross-country road through Borrego Springs were being discussed by county government officials in 1927, as there were no east–west state highways in between Mountain Springs and Riverside. Those living in Calipatria and Westmorland supported the prospect of the road to Julian being improved, and included in the state highway system. In 1928, state assembly member Myron Witter wrote a letter to the San Diego County Board of Supervisors to suggest that the highway be incorporated as a second entrance to the county from the east, and that it would not detract from the progress of the other highway from <a href="El%20Centro%2C%20California">El Centro</a>; however, the county wanted to prioritize the paving over the designation. Chambers of commerce in the Imperial Valley generally agreed with Witter, proposing that the El Centro–Calexico road be made a part of the state highway system, and the Kane Springs–Julian road be given second priority for inclusion.

In June 1930, an agreement was made between the county and the state to share in the construction and maintenance on the road to Kane Springs from Julian; prison crews were to make up some of the workforce. Vista Way opened on November 26, 1930. By 1932, the road from Escondido to Ramona was a gravel road, and the portion from Julian to <a href="U.S.%20Route%2099">U.S. Route 99</a> (US 99), which is currently designated as SR 86, was still a dirt road. That year, the cost was predicted to be $176,000 (about $ in dollars).

SR 78 was originally formed along with the originally signed state highways in California (Sign Routes) in 1934; however, it only extended to what was then US 99 near <a href="Kane%20Springs%2C%20California">Kane Springs</a>. In the North County, SR 78 was legislatively designated as Route 196 from then-<a href="U.S.%20Route%20101%20%28California%29">US 101</a> (present-day I-5) to Vista, and as Route 77 from Vista to <a href="U.S.%20Route%20395%20%28California%29">US 395</a> in Escondido. SR 78 was legally known as Route 197 from Escondido to Ramona, and Route 198 from Ramona to US 99, which is now SR 86. From the eastern junction of SR 86 to the Riverside county line, the route was designated as Route 146 in 1959.

By 1947, US 395 ran concurrently along the portion of SR 78 from Vista to Escondido before continuing along Santa Fe Avenue to Bonsall and Fallbrook and rejoining its alignment during the 1970s. At this time, all of SR 78 that existed had been paved. Before the present-day freeway was built, SR 78 was routed on the Vista Way Freeway (which was an expressway) from Oceanside east to downtown Vista. After this, it followed Santa Fe Avenue and Mission Road east (now signed as <a href="County%20Route%20S14%20%28California%29">CR S14</a>), continuing onto Grand Avenue in Escondido. Following the intersection with US 395, SR 78 turned south on Ash Street and rejoined the current alignment of the highway. In 1949, the rerouting of SR 78 from US 395 to US 99 was listed as a priority by local officials. The road was known for its curves, even though it went over relatively flat terrain; this reduced its efficiency.

The portion of the SR 78 freeway in Oceanside opened to traffic on February 11, 1954. This highway was extended to Vista in May 1955, at a cost of $1,159,000 (about $ in dollars). The part of the freeway from Vista to Escondido was one of the top priorities for highway construction in the county as early as 1960. The center portion of the Vista Way Freeway opened in April 1962, but the western part of the route was not entirely <a href="Controlled-access%20highway">access controlled</a>, as an expressway. The section of the SR 78 freeway from Rancho Santa Fe Road in San Marcos to Nordahl Road was completed in April 1962. The part of the freeway connecting Rancho Santa Fe Road to the Vista portion opened in February 1963, at a cost of $3.9 million (about $ in dollars). The opening of the freeway was credited with helping to bring 315 jobs to San Marcos in 1963. The rest of the freeway between Nordahl Road and US 395 opened on December 21, 1964, providing a four-lane highway from Escondido to Oceanside; the segment cost $1,865,000 (about $ in dollars). SR 78 was officially designated in the <a href="1964%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28California%29">1964 state highway renumbering</a>.

The San Diego Chamber of Commerce and the San Diego Highway Development Association urged for the conversion of SR 78 west of Vista, a length of , from an expressway to a freeway in April 1967. The College Boulevard <a href="diamond%20interchange">diamond interchange</a> on this western segment was scheduled to open to traffic on October 24, 1967, and connected the recently relocated <a href="MiraCosta%20College">MiraCosta College</a> to the freeway. The interchange, previously an <a href="at-grade%20intersection">at-grade intersection</a>, improved traffic flow to the college by removing the left turn across the highway needed to access it. The construction of the interchange cost $800,941 (about $ in dollars). May 1968 saw the state designating the Jefferson Street and Emerald Drive interchanges as a priority. In August 1968, the state allocated $750,000 (about $ in dollars) for building the Jefferson Street interchange. Further funding difficulties were encountered due to US 395 being given priority, but both interchanges had funding by August 1970.

The construction of the Emerald Drive interchange was scheduled for the year 1971. While the El Camino Real interchange was already a diamond interchange, the state planned to add <a href="traffic%20signal">traffic signal</a>s to the ramps to accommodate more congestion from the nearby mall. The Emerald Drive interchange was completed in September, and the rest of the project was to be completed by the end of the year, leaving Jefferson Drive as the only remaining traffic signal. Construction on the Jefferson Street interchange began in early 1972; the section from I-5 east to Melrose Drive (along the routing of the Vista Way Freeway) had been upgraded to full freeway standards as of 1973.

Plans to construct a road from Brawley to Glamis date from 1953; the road would provide improved access to two newer state parks. The ceding of the Chocolate Mountains to the <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> had closed a north–south road traversing Imperial County, and the government needed to restore a corridor for local residents to use, as the road was closed during the day for five days a week. However, in August, the Riverside Chamber of Commerce opposed the construction, even though it would replace the Niland–Blythe road. The chamber reversed its stance in December, as the road would mostly be constructed in Imperial County.

To construct the road, the <a href="House%20Armed%20Services%20Committee">House Armed Services Committee</a> voted to allocate $660,000 (about $ in dollars) for the Navy to give to Imperial County to construct it in February 1956. The House Appropriations Committee bundled it with 616 other projects, however, which President <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a> vetoed in mid-July. The allocation was eventually approved by both Congress and Eisenhower a few weeks later. "The San Diego Union" and the "Evening Tribune" (later merged to form the "<a href="San%20Diego%20Union-Tribune">Union-Tribune</a>") were recognized by the San Diego county supervisors for their role in winning congressional support for the funding.

There was a brief delay in approving the money in February 1957 when there was a proposal to move the gunnery range. However, at the end of the month, the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> obtained ownership from Imperial County of the old Niland–Blythe road running through the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range for the specified amount. The county then used this money to fund the construction of the Glamis Road, which Ben Hulse predicted would become a state highway. This portion of the road was specifically designed to address the challenges of building it through sand dunes. The engineers routed the highway according to the terrain and made cuts in the sand up to deep. The routing roughly followed an old Native American trail that went from the Imperial Valley to the Palo Verde Valley. According to an Imperial County official, the road was predicted to be more busy than US 80 and to bring traffic to San Diego directly from <a href="Needles%2C%20California">Needles</a> and US 66.

The Glamis road opened in August 1958, and the road from Glamis to Palo Verde was under construction at that time; the part of the road that was already open was dedicated in October. In 1959, the rest of the current routing of SR 78 between Brawley and Palo Verde was added to the state highway system as SR 195 and Legislative Route 146. The state legislature added the portion of SR 78 from SR 115 to the Riverside County line in the 1964 state highway renumbering, also naming the road the Ben Hulse Highway. In March 1964, the Ben Hulse Highway leading to Palo Verde was dedicated, and state senator Hulse's efforts to have the road built were recognized. Following this, in 1965, the newly constructed section was signed as CR S78. The section from Palo Verde to Blythe shows up as part of SR 78 on maps as early as 1965, and the section from southwest of Midway Well to Palo Verde is shown as part of SR 78 as early as 1966.

In 1969, plans to extend the freeway portion of SR 78 east from the Broadway interchange through Escondido were delayed by <a href="Caltrans">Caltrans</a> director Jacob Dekema due to a lack of funding until 1980. However, in 1970, the community raised concerns about the number of buildings that would need to be destroyed, as the freeway would go through a dense urban area. Other routes, including routing SR 78 along I-15 south, were proposed. The majority of the Escondido City Council supported sending representatives to the upcoming <a href="California%20Coastal%20Commission">California Coastal Commission</a> meeting in January 1971 to expedite the process of construction.

A month later, an environmental study was conducted that focused on the possibilities of rerouting the proposed freeway. In April 1972, the majority of voters supported a referendum that halted plans to build the SR 78 freeway through the city of Escondido. The city then turned its focus to widening Lincoln Avenue and Ash Street instead, and also requested that the routing of SR 78 be moved to Broadway, Washington Avenue, and Ash Street from Grand Avenue to improve traffic flow. Five years later, signs were installed on eastbound SR 78, directing traffic headed for the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to use I-15 south to Via Rancho Parkway instead of continuing eastbound, to bypass the Escondido traffic.

City officials expressed a desire to have SR 78 included in the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a> in 1985, but this was determined unlikely to succeed by state senator William Craven. In September, the state government agreed to pay $7.5 million (about $ in dollars) for the widening between Oceanside and Escondido, but the county and the five cities the route ran through would have to pay for the rest of the cost. The San Diego County Board of Supervisors endorsed the project that month, in order to have the best chance at getting federal funding. A spike in accidents during that year led to Representative <a href="Ron%20Packard">Ron Packard</a> proposing a way to split the costs between the governments; there were 387 accidents from January to August 1985, a sharp increase from 234 in 1984. In recognition for his work obtaining funding, SR 78 between Oceanside and Escondido was named the Ronald Packard Parkway in 2000.

The House Public Works and Transportation Subcommittee allocated $12 million (about $ in dollars) in a bill during June 1986. The <a href="Senate%20%28U.S.%29">Senate</a> raised an issue over the speed limit in October, which made the outcome dubious. The House and Senate eventually settled on a version of the bill in March 1987, only to have President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> veto the bill due to "pork barrel" spending. Congress passed the bill in April 1987, overriding Reagan's veto, in the same legislation that allowed for rural Interstates to have a speed limit of up to . The bill authorized $15 million (about $ in dollars) in federal funding, and the cities of Oceanside, Carlsbad, Vista, San Marcos, and Escondido agreed to pay $6 million (about $ in dollars); the total cost was $30 million (about $ in dollars). Caltrans predicted that without the widening project, traffic speeds on SR 78 would be as low as by the year 2000 because of congestion. A public relations campaign had begun to garner public support for the project, including <a href="bumper%20stickers">bumper stickers</a> saying "I hate 78".

The widening project began construction on April 14, 1989, with the first project adding two lanes between San Marcos Boulevard and I-15. Additional funding was secured with a local sales tax increase in 1987, providing $80 million (about $ in dollars), and an additional $7.8 million (about $ in dollars) from the California Transportation Commission. By March 1991, another part of the project from College Boulevard to Melrose Drive began the <a href="Construction%20bidding">bidding process</a>. The next year, the project began to wind down, with bidding on the final part of the work between Nordahl Road and I-15. The widening was complete by the beginning of 1994.

Several projects took place following the completion of the widening project. A realignment project took place in 1994 to remove one of the curves in the San Pasqual Valley, at a cost of $2.5 million (about $ in dollars). The San Marcos Boulevard interchange was renovated beginning in late 1996, but encountered difficulties in the land acquisition process. Work resumed in 1999, and was expected to be finished by 2000, at a cost of $10 million; the benefits of decreased congestion came into effect once the new westbound offramp was opened. The Twin Oaks Valley Road interchange was another subject of contention, as the state Assembly refused to fund the project with $5.1 million (about $ in dollars) in April 1997. However, in June 1998, the California Transportation Commission approved the funding after the San Diego Association of Governments officially requested it. Construction began in August 1999, and was scheduled to end in 2001.

A new interchange with Vista Village Drive was opened in 1998, and the College Boulevard interchange in Oceanside was revised along westbound SR 78, at a cost of $5.5 million (about $ in dollars). In addition to this, a new interchange was constructed at Las Posas Road in San Marcos, which opened in 2006. According to the U-T San Diego (the renamed San Diego Union-Tribune), SR 78 at Barham Drive was the worst "traffic bottleneck" in the county between 2010 and 2012. Thus, the interchange at Nordahl Road was also improved, and extra lanes were to be added between Nordahl Road and I-15; construction commenced in early 2012, and the new bridge opened in November. The project cost $41 million.

In the late 2000s, planning began for a bypass around the downtown portion of the city of Brawley. An expressway would carry the routing of SR 78 north and east of the city, with an interchange at SR 111, before intersecting with the current alignment of SR 78. A Swedish company began construction on this bypass in April 2008; the first phase consisted of the portion of the bypass that is solely SR 111. The second phase of the bypass, from the western junction with SR 111 to the eastern junction with SR 78, lasted from February 2008 to June 2011. On the third phase of the project, from the junction with SR 86 west of Brawley to the western end of the completed bypass, construction began in late 2010. This project was identified in August 2010 as a project that could be affected by California state budget cuts. The Brawley Bypass, as it was known, opened on October 30, 2012.

The western portion of SR 78 in <a href="North%20County">North County</a> is currently slated for several improvements. There were plans to construct an additional interchange at Rancho Del Oro Road in Oceanside; however, the Oceanside City Council decided to cancel these plans in 2005, despite studies suggesting that this move would be detrimental to the traffic in the region. The City Council reinstated those plans in September 2012.

There are also plans to improve the interchange with I-5, which currently involves a traffic signal connecting Vista Way and SR 78 with the ramps to I-5 southbound. Plans call for adding more lanes to I-5 and SR 78 as well as for the construction of a new ramp from SR 78 westbound to I-5 southbound and from I-5 southbound to SR 78 eastbound. The nearby lagoon has served as an obstacle in constructing additional ramps. In 2002, the I-5 northbound to SR 78 eastbound ramp was widened to two lanes to ease congestion. At 2015 meeting, the Oceanside community expressed concerns about a potential "flyover" ramp design for the new interchange. The project is scheduled for completion in the late 2020s.

A 2011 Caltrans report proposed adding two <a href="high-occupancy%20vehicle%20lane">high-occupancy vehicle lane</a>s to the freeway portion of SR 78 between I-5 and I-15 to accommodate increased traffic. In early 2016, the mayor of San Marcos stated that there were plans to add another lane in each direction to SR 78 through parts of the city.

The Garden of Earthly Delights

The Garden of Earthly Delights is the modern title given to a <a href="triptych">triptych</a> <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> on <a href="oak">oak panel</a> painted by the <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Early Netherlandish</a> master <a href="Hieronymus%20Bosch">Hieronymus Bosch</a>, between 1490 and 1510, when Bosch was between 40 and 60 years old. It has been housed in the <a href="Museo%20del%20Prado">Museo del Prado</a> in Madrid since 1939.

As so little is known of Bosch's life or intentions, interpretations of his intent have ranged from an admonition of worldly fleshy indulgence, to a dire warning on the perils of life's temptations, to an evocation of ultimate sexual joy. The intricacy of its symbolism, particularly that of the central panel, has led to a wide range of scholarly interpretations over the centuries. Twentieth-century art historians are divided as to whether the triptych's central panel is a moral warning or a panorama of paradise lost. <a href="Peter%20S.%20Beagle">Peter S. Beagle</a> describes it as an "erotic derangement that turns us all into <a href="voyeur">voyeur</a>s, a place filled with the intoxicating air of perfect liberty".

Bosch painted three large triptychs (the others are "<a href="The%20Last%20Judgment%20%28Bosch%20triptych%29">The Last Judgment</a>" of c. 1482 and "<a href="The%20Haywain%20Triptych">The Haywain Triptych</a>" of c. 1516) that can be read from left to right and in which each panel was essential to the meaning of the whole. Each of these three works presents distinct yet linked themes addressing history and faith. Triptychs from this period were generally intended to be read sequentially, the left and right panels often portraying <a href="Garden%20of%20Eden">Eden</a> and the <a href="Last%20Judgment">Last Judgment</a> respectively, while the main subject was contained in the center piece. It is not known whether "The Garden" was intended as an <a href="altarpiece">altarpiece</a>, but the general view is that the extreme subject matter of the inner center and right panels make it unlikely that it was intended to function in a church or monastery, but was instead commissioned by a <a href="Laity">lay</a> <a href="Patronage">patron</a>.

When the triptych's wings are closed, the design of the outer panels becomes visible. Rendered in a green–gray <a href="grisaille">grisaille</a>, these panels lack colour, probably because most Netherlandish triptychs were thus painted, but possibly indicating that the painting reflects a time before the creation of the sun and moon, which were formed, according to Christian theology, to "give light to the earth". The typical grisaille blandness of Netherlandish <a href="altarpiece">altarpiece</a>s served to highlight the splendid colour inside.

The outer panels are generally thought to depict the <a href="Genesis%20creation%20myth">creation</a> of the world, showing greenery beginning to clothe the still-pristine Earth. God, wearing a crown similar to a <a href="papal%20tiara">papal tiara</a> (a common convention in Netherlandish painting), is visible as a tiny figure at the upper left. Bosch shows <a href="Conceptions%20of%20God">God</a> as <a href="God%20the%20Father">the father</a> sitting with a <a href="Bible">Bible</a> on his lap, creating the Earth in a passive manner by divine <a href="Let%20there%20be%20light">fiat</a>. Above him is inscribed a quote from <a href="Psalm%2033">Psalm 33</a> reading "Ipse dixit, et facta sunt: ipse mandāvit, et creāta sunt"—"For he spake and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast". The Earth is encapsulated in a transparent sphere recalling the traditional depiction of the created world as a crystal sphere held by God or Christ. It hangs suspended in the cosmos, which is shown as an impermeable darkness, whose only other inhabitant is God himself.

Despite the presence of vegetation, the earth does not yet contain human or animal life, indicating that the scene represents the events of the biblical Third Day. Bosch renders the plant life in an unusual fashion, using uniformly gray tints which make it difficult to determine whether the subjects are purely vegetable or perhaps include some mineral formations. Surrounding the interior of the globe is the sea, partially illuminated by beams of light shining through clouds. The exterior wings have a clear position within the sequential narrative of the work as a whole. They show an unpopulated earth composed solely of rock and plants, contrasting sharply with the inner central panel which contains a paradise teeming with <a href="lust">lust</a>ful humanity.

Scholars have proposed that Bosch used the outer panels to establish a Biblical setting for the inner elements of the work, and the exterior image is generally interpreted as set in an earlier time than those in the interior. As with Bosch's "<a href="The%20Haywain%20Triptych">Haywain</a>" triptych, the inner centerpiece is flanked by heavenly and hellish imagery. The scenes depicted in the triptych are thought to follow a chronological order: flowing from left-to-right they represent Eden, the garden of earthly delights, and Hell. God appears as the creator of humanity in the left hand wing, while the consequences of humanity's failure to follow his will are shown in the right.However, in contrast to Bosch's two other complete triptychs, "<a href="The%20Last%20Judgment%20%28Bosch%20triptych%29">The Last Judgment</a>" (around 1482) and "The Haywain" (after 1510), God is absent from the central panel. Instead, this panel shows humanity acting with apparent <a href="free%20will">free will</a> as naked men and women engage in various pleasure-seeking activities. According to some interpretations, the right hand panel is believed to show God's penalties in a hellscape.

Art historian <a href="Charles%20de%20Tolnay">Charles de Tolnay</a> believed that, through the seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon the newly created earth. This view is reinforced by the rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure in comparison to the immensity of the earth. According to Hans Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before <a href="Fall%20of%20Man">the Fall</a>, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.

The left panel (sometimes known as the "Joining of Adam and Eve") depicts a scene from the paradise of the <a href="Garden%20of%20Eden">Garden of Eden</a> commonly interpreted as the moment when God presents Eve to Adam. The painting shows Adam waking from a deep sleep to find God holding Eve by her wrist and giving the sign of his blessing to their union. God is younger-looking than on the outer panels, blue-eyed and with golden curls. His youthful appearance may be a device by the artist to illustrate the concept of <a href="Jesus">Christ</a> as the <a href="Incarnation%20%28Christianity%29">incarnation</a> of the <a href="Logos">Word of God</a>. God's right hand is raised in blessing, while he holds Eve's wrist with his left. According to the work's most controversial interpreter, the 20th-century <a href="folkloristics">folklorist</a> and <a href="art%20historian">art historian</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20Fraenger">Wilhelm Fraenger</a>:

As though enjoying the pulsation of the living blood and as though too he were setting a seal on the eternal and immutable communion between this human blood and his own. This physical contact between the Creator and Eve is repeated even more noticeably in the way Adam's toes touch the Lord's foot. Here is the stressing of a rapport: Adam seems indeed to be stretching to his full length in order to make contact with the Creator. And the billowing out of the cloak around the Creator's heart, from where the garment falls in marked folds and contours to Adam's feet, also seems to indicate that here a current of divine power flows down, so that this group of three actually forms a closed circuit, a complex of magical energy ...
Eve avoids Adam's gaze, although, according to art historian Walter S. Gibson, she is shown "seductively presenting her body to Adam". Adam's expression is one of amazement, and Fraenger has identified three elements to his seeming astonishment. Firstly, there is surprise at the presence of the God. Secondly, he is reacting to an awareness that Eve is of the same nature as himself, and has been created from his own body. Finally, from the intensity of Adam's gaze, it can be concluded that he is experiencing sexual arousal and the primal urge to reproduce for the first time.
The surrounding landscape is populated by hut-shaped forms, some of which are made from stone, while others are at least partially organic. Behind Eve rabbits, symbolising <a href="fecundity">fecundity</a>, play in the grass, and a <a href="Dracaena%20%28plant%29">dragon tree</a> opposite is thought to represent <a href="Immortality">eternal life</a>. The background reveals several animals that would have been exotic to contemporaneous Europeans, including a giraffe, an elephant, and a lion that has killed and is about to devour his prey. In the foreground, from a large hole in the ground, emerge birds and winged animals, some of which are realistic, some fantastic. Behind a fish, a person clothed in a short-sleeved hooded jacket and with a duck's beak holds an open book as if reading. To the left of the area a cat holds a small lizard-like creature in its jaws. Belting observes that, despite the fact that the creatures in the foreground are fantastical imaginings, many of the animals in the mid and background are drawn from contemporary travel literature, and here Bosch is appealing to "the knowledge of a humanistic and aristocratic readership". <a href="Erhard%20Reuwich">Erhard Reuwich</a>'s pictures for Bernhard von Breydenbach's 1486 "Pilgrimages to the Holy Land" were long thought to be the source for both the elephant and the giraffe, though more recent research indicates the mid-15th-century humanist scholar <a href="Ciriaco%20de%27%20Pizzicolli">Cyriac of Ancona</a>'s travelogues served as Bosch's exposure to these exotic animals.

According to art historian Virginia Tuttle, the scene is "highly unconventional [and] cannot be identified as any of the events from the <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Book of Genesis</a> traditionally depicted in Western art". Some of the images contradict the innocence expected in the Garden of Eden. Tuttle and other critics have interpreted the <a href="gaze">gaze</a> of Adam upon his wife as lustful, and indicative of the Christian belief that humanity was doomed from the beginning. Gibson believes that Adam's facial expression betrays not just surprise but also expectation. According to a belief common in the Middle Ages, before the Fall Adam and Eve would have copulated without lust, solely to reproduce. Many believed that the first sin committed after Eve tasted the <a href="Tree%20of%20Knowledge%20of%20Good%20and%20Evil">forbidden fruit</a> was carnal lust. On a tree to the right a <a href="Serpent%20%28Bible%29">snake</a> curls around a tree trunk, while to its right a mouse creeps; according to Fraenger, both animals are universal <a href="Phallus">phallic symbols</a>.

The skyline of the center panel (220 × 195 cm, 87 × 77 in) matches exactly with that of the left wing, while the positioning of its central pool and the lake behind it echoes the lake in the earlier scene. The center image depicts the expansive "garden" landscape which gives the triptych its name. The panel shares a common horizon with the left wing, suggesting a spatial connection between the two scenes. The garden is teeming with male and female nudes, together with a variety of animals, plants and fruit. The setting is not the paradise shown in the left panel, but neither is it based in the terrestrial realm. Fantastic creatures mingle with the real; otherwise ordinary fruits appear engorged to a gigantic size. The figures are engaged in diverse amorous sports and activities, both in couples and in groups. Gibson describes them as behaving "overtly and without shame", while art historian Laurinda Dixon writes that the human figures exhibit "a certain adolescent sexual curiosity".

Many of the numerous human figures revel in an innocent, self-absorbed joy as they engage in a wide range of activities; some appear to enjoy <a href="Sensory%20system">sensory</a> pleasures, others play unselfconsciously in the water, and yet others cavort in meadows with a variety of animals, seemingly at one with nature. In the middle of the background, a large blue globe resembling a fruit pod rises in the middle of a lake. Visible through its circular window is a man holding his right hand close to his partner's genitals, and the bare buttocks of yet another figure hover in the vicinity. According to Fraenger, the <a href="Erotic%20art">eroticism</a> of the center frame could be considered either as an allegory of <a href="Spirituality">spiritual</a> transition or a playground of corruption.

On the right-hand side of the foreground stand a group of four figures, three fair and one black-skinned. The fair-skinned figures, two males and one female, are covered from head to foot in light-brown body hair. Scholars generally agree that these <a href="Hirsutism">hirsute</a> figures represent wild or primeval humanity but disagree on the symbolism of their inclusion. Art historian Patrik Reuterswärd, for example, posits that they may be seen as "the <a href="noble%20savage">noble savage</a>" who represents "an imagined alternative to our civilized life", imbuing the panel with "a more clear-cut primitivistic note". Writer Peter Glum, in contrast, sees the figures as intrinsically connected with whoredom and lust.

In a cave to their lower right, a male figure points towards a reclining female who is also covered in hair. The pointing man is the only clothed figure in the panel, and as Fraenger observes, "he is clothed with emphatic austerity right up to his throat". In addition, he is one of the few human figures with dark hair. According to Fraenger:

The way this man's dark hair grows, with the sharp dip in the middle of his high forehead, as though concentrating there all the energy of the masculine M, makes his face different from all the others. His coal-black eyes are rigidly focused in a gaze that expresses compelling force. The nose is unusually long and boldly curved. The mouth is wide and sensual, but the lips are firmly shut in a straight line, the corners strongly marked and tightened into final points, and this strengthens the impression—already suggested by the eyes—of a strong controlling will. It is an extraordinarily fascinating face, reminding us of faces of famous men, especially of Machiavelli's; and indeed the whole aspect of the head suggests something Mediterranean, as though this man had acquired his frank, searching, superior air at Italian academies.

The pointing man has variously been described as either the patron of the work (Fraenger in 1947), as an advocate of Adam denouncing Eve (Dirk Bax in 1956), as Saint <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a> in his camel's skin (Isabel Mateo Goméz in 1963), or as a self-portrait. The woman below him lies within a semicylindrical transparent shield, while her mouth is sealed, devices implying that she bears a secret. To their left, a man crowned by leaves lies on top of what appears to be an actual but gigantic <a href="strawberry">strawberry</a>, and is joined by a male and female who contemplate another equally huge strawberry.

There is no perspectival order in the foreground; instead it comprises a series of small motifs wherein proportion and terrestrial logic are abandoned. Bosch presents the viewer with gigantic ducks playing with tiny humans under the cover of oversized fruit; fish walking on land while birds dwell in the water; a passionate couple encased in an <a href="amniotic%20fluid">amniotic fluid</a> bubble; and a man inside of a red fruit staring at a mouse in a transparent cylinder.

The pools in the fore and background contain bathers of both sexes. In the central circular pool, the sexes are mostly segregated, with several females adorned by peacocks and fruit. Four women carry cherry-like fruits on their heads, perhaps a symbol of pride at the time, as has been deduced from the contemporaneous saying: "Don't eat cherries with great lords—they'll throw the pits in your face." The women are surrounded by a parade of naked men riding horses, donkeys, <a href="unicorn">unicorn</a>s, camels and other exotic or fantastic creatures. Several men show <a href="acrobatics">acrobatics</a> while riding, apparently acts designed to gain the females' attention, which highlights the attraction felt between the two sexes as groups. The two outer springs also contain both men and women cavorting with abandon. Around them, birds infest the water while winged fish crawl on land. Humans inhabit giant <a href="Seashell">shells</a>. All are surrounded by oversized fruit pods and eggshells, and both humans and animals feast on strawberries and cherries.

The impression of a life lived without consequence, or what art historian Hans Belting describes as "unspoilt and pre-moral existence", is underscored by the absence of children and old people. According to the second and third chapters of <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Genesis</a>, Adam and Eve's children were born after they were expelled from Eden. This has led some commentators, in particular Belting, to theorise that the panel represents the world if the two had not been driven out "among the thorns and thistles of the world". In Fraenger's view, the scene illustrates "a <a href="utopia">utopia</a>, a garden of divine delight before the Fall, or—since Bosch could not deny the existence of the dogma of <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a>—a millennial condition that would arise if, after expiation of Original Sin, humanity were permitted to return to Paradise and to a state of tranquil harmony embracing all Creation."

In the high distance of the background, above the hybrid stone formations, four groups of people and creatures are seen in flight. On the immediate left a human male rides on a <a href="chthonic">chthonic</a> solar eagle-lion. The human carries a triple-branched <a href="tree%20of%20life">tree of life</a> on which perches a bird; according to Fraenger "a symbolic bird of death". Fraenger believes the man is intended to represent a genius, "he is the symbol of the extinction of the duality of the sexes, which are resolved in the ether into their original state of unity". To their right a knight with a dolphin tail sails on a winged fish. The knight's tail curls back to touch the back of his head, which references the common symbol of eternity: the <a href="ouroboros">snake biting its own tail</a>. On the immediate right of the panel, a winged youth soars upwards carrying a fish in his hands and a falcon on his back. According to Belting, in these passages Bosch's "imagination triumphs ... the ambivalence of [his] visual syntax exceeds even the enigma of content, opening up that new dimension of freedom by which painting becomes art." Fraenger titled his chapter on the high background "The Ascent to Heaven", and wrote that the airborne figures were likely intended as a link between "what is above" and "what is below", just as the left and right hand panels represent "what was" and "what will be".

The right panel (220 × 97.5 cm, 87 × 38.4 in) illustrates <a href="Hell">Hell</a>, the setting of a number of Bosch paintings. Bosch depicts a world in which humans have succumbed to temptations that lead to <a href="evil">evil</a> and reap eternal damnation. The tone of this final panel strikes a harsh contrast to those preceding it. The scene is set at night, and the natural beauty that adorned the earlier panels is noticeably absent. Compared to the warmth of the center panel, the right wing possesses a chilling quality—rendered through cold colourisation and frozen waterways—and presents a tableau that has shifted from the paradise of the center image to a spectacle of cruel torture and retribution. In a single, densely detailed scene, the viewer is made witness to cities on fire in the background; war, torture chambers, <a href="The%20infernal%20names">infernal</a> taverns, and <a href="demon">demon</a>s in the midground; and mutated animals feeding on human flesh in the foreground. The <a href="nudity">nakedness</a> of the human figures has lost all its eroticism, and many now attempt to cover their genitalia and breasts with their hands, ashamed by their nakedness.

Large explosions in the background throw light through the city gates and spill into the water in the midground; according to writer Walter S. Gibson, "their fiery reflection turning the water below into blood". The light illuminates a road filled with fleeing figures, while hordes of tormentors prepare to burn a neighbouring village. A short distance away, a rabbit carries an impaled and bleeding corpse, while a group of victims above are thrown into a burning lantern. The foreground is populated by a variety of distressed or tortured figures. Some are shown vomiting or excreting, others are crucified by harp and lute, in an <a href="allegory">allegory</a> of music, thus sharpening the contrast between pleasure and torture. A choir sings from a score inscribed on a pair of buttocks, part of a group that has been described as the "Musicians' Hell".

The focal point of the scene is the "Tree-Man", whose cavernous torso is supported by what could be contorted arms or rotting tree trunks. His head supports a disk populated by demons and victims parading around a huge set of bagpipes—often used as a dual sexual symbol—reminiscent of human <a href="scrotum">scrotum</a> and <a href="penis">penis</a>. The tree-man's torso is formed from a broken eggshell, and the supporting trunk has thorn-like branches which pierce the fragile body. A grey figure in a hood bearing an arrow jammed between his buttocks climbs a ladder into the tree-man's central cavity, where nude men sit in a tavern-like setting. The tree-man gazes outwards beyond the viewer, his conspiratorial expression a mix of wistfulness and resignation. Belting wondered if the tree-man's face is a self-portrait, citing the figure's "expression of irony and the slightly sideways gaze [which would] then constitute the signature of an artist who claimed a bizarre pictorial world for his own personal imagination".

Many elements in the panel incorporate earlier iconographical conventions depicting hell. However, Bosch is innovative in that he describes hell not as a fantastical space, but as a realistic world containing many elements from day-to-day human life.

Animals are shown punishing humans, subjecting them to nightmarish torments that may symbolise the <a href="seven%20deadly%20sins">seven deadly sins</a>, matching the torment to the sin. Sitting on an object that may be a toilet or a throne, the panel's centerpiece is a gigantic bird-headed monster feasting on human corpses, which he excretes through a cavity below him, into the transparent chamber pot on which he sits. The monster is sometimes referred to as the "Prince of Hell", a name derived from the <a href="cauldron">cauldron</a> he wears on his head, perhaps representing a debased crown. To his feet a female has her face reflected on the buttocks of a demon. Further to the left, next to a hare-headed demon, a group of naked persons around a toppled gambling table are being massacred with swords and knives. Other brutal violence is shown by a knight torn down and eaten up by a pack of wolves to the right of the tree-man.

During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, <a href="History%20of%20human%20sexuality">sexuality</a> and lust were seen, by some, as evidence of humanity's <a href="Fall%20of%20Man">fall from grace</a>. In the eyes of some viewers, this sin is depicted in the left-hand panel through Adam's, allegedly lustful, gaze towards Eve, and it has been proposed that the center panel was created as a warning to the viewer to avoid a life of sinful pleasure. According to this view, the penalty for such sins is shown in the right panel of the triptych. In the lower right-hand corner, a man is approached by a pig wearing the veil of a nun. The pig is shown trying to seduce the man to sign legal documents. Lust is further said to be symbolised by the gigantic musical instruments and by the choral singers in the left foreground of the panel. Musical instruments often carried erotic connotations in works of art of the period, and lust was referred to in moralising sources as the "music of the flesh". There has also been the view that Bosch's use of music here might be a rebuke against traveling minstrels, often thought of as purveyors of bawdy song and verse.

The dating of "The Garden of Earthly Delights" is uncertain. <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Baldass">Ludwig von Baldass</a> (1917) considered the painting to be an early work by Bosch. However, since De Tolnay (1937) consensus among 20th-century art historians placed the work in 1503–1504 or even later. Both early and late datings were based on the "archaic" treatment of space. <a href="Dendrochronology">Dendrochronology</a> dates the oak of the panels between the years 1460 and 1466, providing an earliest date ("<a href="terminus%20post%20quem">terminus post quem</a>") for the work. Wood used for panel paintings during this period customarily underwent a lengthy period of storage for <a href="Wood%20drying">seasoning</a> purposes, so the age of the oak might be expected to predate the actual date of the painting by several years. Internal evidence, specifically the depiction of a <a href="pineapple">pineapple</a> (a "<a href="New%20World">New World</a>" fruit), suggests that the painting itself postdates <a href="Voyages%20of%20Christopher%20Columbus">Columbus' voyages</a> to the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>, between 1492 and 1504. The dendrochronological research brought Vermet to reconsider an early dating and, consequently, to dispute the presence of any "New World" objects, stressing the presence of African ones instead.

"The Garden" was first documented in 1517, one year after the artist's death, when Antonio de Beatis, a <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a> from <a href="Molfetta">Molfetta</a>, Italy, described the work as part of the decoration in the town palace of the <a href="Count">Count</a>s of the <a href="House%20of%20Nassau">House of Nassau</a> in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>. The palace was a high-profile location, a house often visited by heads of state and leading court figures. The prominence of the painting has led some to conclude that the work was commissioned, and not "solely ... a flight of the imagination". A description of the triptych in 1605 called it the "strawberry painting", because the fruit of the <a href="Arbutus%20unedo">strawberry tree</a> ("madroño" in Spanish) features prominently in the center panel. Early Spanish writers referred to the work as "La Lujuria" ("Lust").

The aristocracy of the <a href="Burgundian%20Netherlands">Burgundian Netherlands</a>, influenced by the <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">humanist</a> movement, were the most likely collectors of Bosch's paintings, but there are few records of the location of his works in the years immediately following his death. It is probable that the patron of the work was <a href="Engelbert%20II%20of%20Nassau">Engelbrecht II of Nassau</a>, who died in 1504, or his successor <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20Nassau-Breda">Henry III of Nassau-Breda</a>, the <a href="Stadtholder">governor</a> of several of the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg</a> provinces in the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a>. De Beatis wrote in his travel journal that "there are some panels on which bizarre things have been painted. They represent seas, skies, woods, meadows, and many other things, such as people crawling out of a shell, others that bring forth birds, men and women, white and blacks doing all sorts of different activities and poses." Because the triptych was publicly displayed in the palace of the House of Nassau, it was visible to many, and Bosch's reputation and fame quickly spread across Europe. The work's popularity can be measured by the numerous surviving copies—in oil, engraving and tapestry—commissioned by wealthy patrons, as well as by the number of forgeries in circulation after his death. Most are of the central panel only and do not deviate from the original. These copies were usually painted on a much smaller scale, and they vary considerably in quality. Many were created a generation after Bosch, and some took the form of wall <a href="tapestry">tapestries</a>.

The De Beatis description, only rediscovered by Steppe in the 1960s, cast new light on the commissioning of a work that was previously thought—since it has no central religious image—to be an atypical <a href="altarpiece">altarpiece</a>. Many Netherlandish <a href="diptych">diptych</a>s intended for private use are known, and even a few triptychs, but the Bosch panels are unusually large compared with these and contain no <a href="Patronage">donor</a> portraits. Possibly they were commissioned to celebrate a wedding, as large Italian paintings for private houses frequently were. Nevertheless, "The Garden"s bold depictions do not rule out a church commission, such was the contemporaneous fervor to warn against immorality. In 1566, the triptych served as the model for a <a href="tapestry">tapestry</a> that hangs at <a href="El%20Escorial">El Escorial</a> monastery near Madrid.

Upon the death of Henry III, the painting passed into the hands of his nephew <a href="William%20the%20Silent">William the Silent</a>, the founder of the <a href="House%20of%20Orange-Nassau">House of Orange-Nassau</a> and leader of the <a href="Dutch%20Revolt">Dutch Revolt</a> against Spain. In 1568, however, the <a href="Fernando%20%C3%81lvarez%20de%20Toledo%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Alba">Duke of Alba</a> confiscated the picture and brought it to Spain, where it became the property of one Don Fernando, the Duke's illegitimate son and heir and the Spanish commander in the Netherlands. <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Phillip II</a> acquired the painting at auction in 1591; two years later he presented it to El Escorial. A contemporaneous description of the transfer records the gift on 8 July 1593 of a "painting in oils, with two wings depicting the variety of the world, illustrated with grotesqueries by Hieronymus Bosch, known as 'Del Madroño'". After an unbroken 342 years at El Escorial, the work moved to the <a href="Museo%20del%20Prado">Museo del Prado</a> in 1939, along with other works by Bosch. The triptych is not particularly well-preserved; the paint of the middle panel especially has flaked off around joints in the wood.

Little is known for certain of the life of <a href="List%20of%20paintings%20by%20Hieronymus%20Bosch">Hieronymus Bosch</a> or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the <a href="iconography">iconography</a> of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Netherlandish artist</a>. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous <a href="Esotericism">esoteric knowledge</a> since lost to history.

Although Bosch's career flourished during the <a href="Renaissance%20painting">High Renaissance</a>, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held <a href="moral%20authority">moral authority</a>. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.
<a href="Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Sig%C3%BCenza">José de Sigüenza</a> is credited with the first extensive critique of "The Garden of Earthly Delights", in his 1605 "History of the Order of St. Jerome". He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels "are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind". The art historian <a href="Carl%20Justi">Carl Justi</a> observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by "the news of recently discovered <a href="Atlantis">Atlantis</a> and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise". The period in which the triptych was created was a time of adventure and discovery, when tales and trophies from the <a href="New%20World">New World</a> sparked the imagination of poets, painters and writers. Although the triptych contains many unearthly and fantastic creatures, Bosch still appealed in his images and cultural references to an elite humanist and aristocratic audience. Bosch reproduces a scene from <a href="Martin%20Schongauer">Martin Schongauer</a>'s engraving "Flight into Egypt".

Conquest in Africa and the East provided both wonder and terror to European intellectuals, as it led to the conclusion that Eden could never have been an actual geographical location. "The Garden" references exotic travel literature of the 15th century through the animals, including lions and a giraffe, in the left panel. The giraffe has been traced to <a href="Ciriaco%20de%27%20Pizzicolli">Cyriac of Ancona</a>, a travel writer known for his visits to Egypt during the 1440s. The exoticism of Cyriac's sumptuous manuscripts may have inspired Bosch's imagination.

The charting and conquest of this new world made real regions previously only idealised in the imagination of artists and poets. At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional <a href="Utopia">Utopia</a>n representation, as exemplified by the writings of <a href="Thomas%20More">Thomas More</a> (1478–1535).

<a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a> was an avid student of exotic animals, and drew many sketches based on his visits to European zoos. Dürer visited <a href="%27s-Hertogenbosch">'s-Hertogenbosch</a> during Bosch's lifetime, and it is likely the two artists met, and that Bosch drew inspiration from the German's work.

Attempts to find sources for the work in literature from the period have not been successful. Art historian <a href="Erwin%20Panofsky">Erwin Panofsky</a> wrote in 1953 that, "In spite of all the ingenious, erudite and in part extremely useful research devoted to the task of "decoding Jerome Bosch", I cannot help feeling that the real secret of his magnificent nightmares and daydreams has still to be disclosed. We have bored a few holes through the door of the locked room; but somehow we do not seem to have discovered the key." The humanist <a href="Desiderius%20Erasmus">Desiderius Erasmus</a> has been suggested as a possible influence; the writer lived in 's-Hertogenbosch in the 1480s, and it is likely he knew Bosch. Glum remarked on the triptych's similarity of tone with Erasmus's view that theologians "explain (to suit themselves) the most difficult mysteries ... is it a possible proposition: God the Father hates the Son? Could God have assumed the form of a woman, a devil, an ass, a gourd, a stone?"

Because only bare details are known of Bosch's life, interpretation of his work can be an extremely difficult area for academics as it is largely reliant on conjecture. Individual motifs and elements of symbolism may be explained, but so far relating these to each other and to his work as a whole has remained elusive. The enigmatic scenes depicted on the panels of the inner triptych of "The Garden of Earthly Delights" have been studied by many scholars, who have often arrived at contradictory interpretations. Analyses based on symbolic systems ranging from the <a href="alchemy">alchemical</a>, <a href="astrology">astrological</a>, and <a href="heresy">heretical</a> to the <a href="folklore">folkloric</a> and <a href="unconscious%20mind">subconscious</a> have all attempted to explain the complex objects and ideas presented in the work. Until the early 20th century, Bosch's paintings were generally thought to incorporate attitudes of <a href="Medieval%20literature">Medieval didactic literature</a> and sermons. Charles De Tolnay wrote that,
The oldest writers, <a href="Dominicus%20Lampsonius">Dominicus Lampsonius</a> and <a href="Karel%20van%20Mander">Karel van Mander</a>, attached themselves to his most evident side, to the subject; their conception of Bosch, inventor of fantastic pieces of devilry and of infernal scenes, which prevails today (1937) in the public at large, and prevailed with historians until the last quarter of the 19th century.

Generally, his work is described as a warning against lust, and the central panel as a representation of the transience of worldly pleasure. In 1960, the art historian Ludwig von Baldass wrote that Bosch shows "how sin came into the world through the Creation of Eve, how fleshly lusts spread over the entire earth, promoting all the <a href="Seven%20deadly%20sins">Deadly Sins</a>, and how this necessarily leads straight to Hell". De Tolnay wrote that the center panel represents "the nightmare of humanity", where "the artist's purpose above all is to show the evil consequences of sensual pleasure and to stress its ephemeral character". Supporters of this view hold that the painting is a sequential narrative, depicting mankind's initial state of innocence in Eden, followed by the subsequent corruption of that innocence, and finally its punishment in Hell. At various times in its history, the triptych has been known as "La Lujuria", "The Sins of the World" and "The Wages of Sin".

Proponents of this idea point out that moralists during Bosch's era believed that it was woman's—ultimately Eve's—temptation that drew men into a life of lechery and sin. This would explain why the women in the center panel are very much among the active participants in bringing about the Fall. At the time, the power of <a href="femininity">femininity</a> was often rendered by showing a female surrounded by a circle of males. A late 15th-century <a href="engraving">engraving</a> by <a href="Israhel%20van%20Meckenem">Israhel van Meckenem</a> shows a group of men prancing ecstatically around a female figure. The Master of the Banderoles's 1460 work the "Pool of Youth" similarly shows a group of females standing in a space surrounded by admiring figures.

This line of reasoning is consistent with interpretations of Bosch's other major moralising works which hold up the folly of man; the "<a href="Death%20and%20the%20Miser">Death and the Miser</a>" and the Haywain. Although each of these works is rendered in a manner, according to the art historian Walter Bosing, that it is difficult to believe "Bosch intended to condemn what he painted with such visually enchanting forms and colors." Bosing concluded however that a medieval mindset was naturally suspicious of material beauty, in any form, and that the sumptuousness of Bosch's description may have been intended to convey a false paradise, teeming with transient beauty.

In 1947, Wilhelm Fränger argued that the triptych's center panel portrays a joyous world when mankind will experience a rebirth of the innocence enjoyed by Adam and Eve before their <a href="Fall%20of%20Man">fall</a>. In his book "The Millennium of Hieronymus Bosch", Fränger wrote that Bosch was a member of the heretical sect known as the <a href="Adamites">Adamites</a>—who were also known as the "Homines intelligentia" and <a href="Brethren%20of%20the%20Free%20Spirit">Brethren and Sisters of the Free Spirit</a>. This radical group, active in the area of the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> and the Netherlands, strove for a form of spirituality immune from sin even in the flesh and imbued the concept of lust with a paradisical innocence.

Fränger believed "The Garden of Earthly Delights" was commissioned by the order's Grand Master. Later critics have agreed that, because of their obscure complexity, Bosch's "altarpieces" may well have been commissioned for non-devotional purposes. The "Homines intelligentia" cult sought to regain the innocent sexuality enjoyed by Adam and Eve before the Fall. Fränger writes that the figures in Bosch's work "are peacefully frolicking about the tranquil garden in vegetative innocence, at one with animals and plants and the sexuality that inspires them seems to be pure joy, pure bliss." Fränger argued against the notion that the hellscape shows the retribution handed down for sins committed in the center panel. Fränger saw the figures in the garden as peaceful, naive, and innocent in expressing their sexuality, and at one with nature. In contrast, those being punished in Hell comprise "musicians, gamblers, desecrators of judgment and punishment".

Examining the symbolism in Bosch's art—"the freakish riddles … the irresponsible phantasmagoria of an ecstatic"—Fränger concluded that his interpretation applied to Bosch's three altarpieces only: "The Garden of Earthly Delights", "<a href="The%20Temptation%20of%20St%20Anthony%20%28Bosch%20painting%29">Temptation of Saint Anthony</a>", and "<a href="The%20Haywain%20Triptych">The Haywain Triptych</a>". Fränger distinguished these pieces from the artist's other works and argued that despite their anti-cleric polemic, they were nevertheless all altarpieces, probably commissioned for the devotional purposes of a mystery cult. While commentators accept Fränger's analysis as astute and broad in scope, they have often questioned his final conclusions. These are regarded by many scholars as hypothesis only, and built on an unstable foundation and what can only be conjecture. Critics argue that artists during this period painted not for their own pleasure but for commission, while the language and secularization of a post-Renaissance mind-set projected onto Bosch would have been alien to the late-<a href="Medieval%20painting">Medieval painter</a>.

Fränger's thesis stimulated others to examine "The Garden" more closely. Writer Carl Linfert also senses the joyfulness of the people in the center panel, but rejects Fränger's assertion that the painting is a "doctrinaire" work espousing the "guiltless sexuality" of the Adamite sect. While the figures engage in amorous acts without any suggestion of the forbidden, Linfert points to the elements in the center panel suggesting death and temporality: some figures turn away from the activity, seeming to lose hope in deriving pleasure from the passionate frolicking of their cohorts. Writing in 1969, E. H Gombrich drew on a close reading of <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Genesis</a> and the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Matthew">Gospel According to Saint Matthew</a> to suggest that the central panel is, according to Linfert, "the state of mankind on the eve of <a href="Deluge%20%28mythology%29">the Flood</a>, when men still pursued pleasure with no thought of the morrow, their only sin the unawareness of sin."

Because Bosch was such a unique and visionary artist, his influence has not spread as widely as that of other major painters of his era. However, there have been instances of later artists incorporating elements of "The Garden of Earthly Delights" into their own work. <a href="Pieter%20Bruegel%20the%20Elder">Pieter Bruegel the Elder</a> (c. 1525–1569) in particular directly acknowledged Bosch as an important influence and inspiration, and incorporated many elements of the inner right panel into several of his most popular works. Bruegel's "<a href="Dull%20Gret">Mad Meg</a>" depicts a peasant woman leading an army of women to pillage Hell, while his "<a href="The%20Triumph%20of%20Death">The Triumph of Death</a>" (c. 1562) echoes the monstrous Hellscape of "The Garden", and utilizes, according to the <a href="Royal%20Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts%20Antwerp">Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp</a>, the same "unbridled imagination and the fascinating colours".

While the Italian court painter <a href="Giuseppe%20Arcimboldo">Giuseppe Arcimboldo</a> () did not create Hellscapes, he painted a body of strange and "fantastic" vegetable portraits—generally heads of people composed of plants, roots, webs and various other organic matter. These strange portraits rely on and echo a motif that was in part inspired by Bosch's willingness to break from strict and faithful representations of nature.

<a href="David%20Teniers%20the%20Younger">David Teniers the Younger</a> () was a Flemish painter who quoted both Bosch and Bruegel throughout his career in such works as his versions of the "Temptation of St Anthony", the "Rich Man in Hell" and his version of "Mad Meg".

During the early 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early <a href="Surrealism">surrealists</a>' fascination with <a href="Dream%20art">dreamscapes</a>, the autonomy of the imagination, and a free-flowing connection to the <a href="Unconscious%20mind">unconscious</a> brought about a renewed interest in his work. Bosch's imagery struck a chord with <a href="Joan%20Mir%C3%B3">Joan Miró</a> and <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a> in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen "The Garden of Earthly Delights" in the <a href="Museo%20del%20Prado">Museo del Prado</a>, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's "<a href="The%20Tilled%20Field">The Tilled Field</a>" contains several parallels to Bosch's "Garden": similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 "<a href="The%20Great%20Masturbator">The Great Masturbator</a>" is similar to an image on the right side of the left panel of Bosch's "Garden", composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.

When <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Breton">André Breton</a> wrote his first <a href="Surrealist%20Manifesto">Surrealist Manifesto</a> in 1924, his historical precedents as inclusions named only <a href="Gustave%20Moreau">Gustave Moreau</a>, <a href="Georges%20Seurat">Georges Seurat</a> and <a href="Paolo%20Uccello">Uccello</a>. However, the Surrealist movement soon rediscovered Bosch and Breughel, who quickly became popular among the Surrealist painters. <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Magritte">René Magritte</a> and <a href="Max%20Ernst">Max Ernst</a> both were inspired by Bosch's "The Garden of Earthly Delights".

Bobby Peel

Robert Peel (12 February 1857 – 12 August 1941) was an English professional <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er who played <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> for <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> between 1883 and 1897. Primarily a <a href="left-arm%20orthodox%20spin">left-arm spin bowler</a>, Peel was also an effective left-handed <a href="batting%20%28cricket%29">batsman</a> who played in the <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Middle%20order">middle order</a>. Between 1884 and 1896, he was regularly selected to represent <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a>, playing 20 <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> in which he took 101 <a href="Wicket%23Dismissing%20a%20batsman">wickets</a>. Over the course of his career, he scored 12,191 <a href="run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> and took 1,775 wickets in first-class cricket. A match-winning bowler, particularly when conditions favoured his style, Peel generally opened the attack, an orthodox tactic for a spinner at the time, and was highly regarded by critics.

Peel began playing for Yorkshire in 1883 but, after a successful debut, was overshadowed in the team by <a href="Ted%20Peate">Edmund Peate</a> and often played only a minor role with the ball. Improvements in his batting and his excellence as a <a href="fielding%20%28cricket%29">fielder</a> kept him in the team, and when Peate was sacked for drunkenness in 1887, Peel became Yorkshire's main spinner. He had already played for England, touring Australia with two professional teams, although he did not play a Test in England until 1888. Over the following years he regularly took over 100 wickets in each season and often played in the prestigious <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">Gentlemen v Players</a> matches. He was generally Yorkshire's leading bowler—until the emergence of <a href="George%20Hirst">George Hirst</a>, he generally received little support from other members of the attack—and often among their leading batsmen. His best season in county cricket came in <a href="1896%20English%20cricket%20season">1896</a>, when he recorded the <a href="double%20%28cricket%29">double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets</a>, and made his highest first-class score of 210. Among his notable feats in Tests, he bowled England to victory after they had <a href="follow-on">followed on</a> in Australia in 1894–95 and took six for 23 in his final Test. The first English cricketer to reach 100 wickets against <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a>, in 1894–95 he also became the first player to fail to score in four successive Test <a href="innings">innings</a>.

As a player, Peel was very popular and admirers often entertained him socially; he became well known for liking alcohol. On the morning of the match that England won after following on, Peel was intoxicated and had to be sobered up. In 1897, he was suspended by Yorkshire for drunkenness during a match. Although it is unclear what exactly happened—Peel said he slipped when fielding, but Hirst later recalled that he came on the field drunk and when asked to leave, bowled a ball in the wrong direction—he never played for the county again. Decades later, a widely circulated story suggested that Peel urinated on the pitch before being sent away. Historians consider the story unlikely, and attribute it to a misunderstanding by its reporter. Peel continued to play and coach cricket for most of his life and in later years became associated with Yorkshire once again. Among his other jobs, he became the landlord of a public house and worked in a mill. He died in 1941 at the age of 84.

Peel was born in <a href="Churwell">Churwell</a>, a village close to <a href="Morley%2C%20West%20Yorkshire">Morley</a>, on 12 February 1857. He was the son of a <a href="Coal%20mining%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">miner</a>, and Peel himself worked in the mines for a time. From the age of 16, he played with increasing frequency for the Churwell cricket team, and by 1882 was part of the <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> Colts. At the time, <a href="Ted%20Peate">Edmund Peate</a> was the first-choice <a href="Left-arm%20orthodox%20spin">left-arm spin bowler</a> in the Yorkshire team, and his presence restricted Peel's opportunities. An injury to Peate allowed Peel to make his <a href="First-class%20cricket">first-class</a> debut for Yorkshire against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> at <a href="Bramall%20Lane">Sheffield</a> on 10 July 1882. Peel took nine wickets in the game, including five for 83 (five wickets taken while conceding 83 runs) in the second innings. <a href="Martin%20Hawke%2C%207th%20Baron%20Hawke">Lord Hawke</a>—who assumed the <a href="captain%20%28cricket%29">captaincy</a> of Yorkshire later that season—subsequently described Peel's debut as one of the most impressive for Yorkshire.

Peel played regularly alongside Peate between 1883 and 1886. He had a junior role, and his bowling was used sparingly; in five seasons he took 163 wickets for Yorkshire, and only took more than 50 first-class wickets in a season once before 1887. His obituary in "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" in 1942 stated: "Yorkshire were singularly rich in bowling talent, so that [Peel] had to wait several years before attaining real distinction". Peel retained his place through his ability as a batsman and fielder; in his history of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, R. S. Holmes judges that Peel was "brilliant" as a fielder and that it was "probably the marked improvement in [his] batting which first secured him a place in the County eleven." He had occasional success with the ball, for example taking eleven for 87 in the match against <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a> in 1884—a match in which Peate did not play. Meanwhile, his <a href="Batting%20average%23Cricket">batting average</a> gradually improved until it reached the mid-20s in 1887.

During the English winter of 1884–85, Peel was included in the team which toured Australia under the management of <a href="Alfred%20Shaw">Alfred Shaw</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Shrewsbury">Arthur Shrewsbury</a> and <a href="James%20Lillywhite">James Lillywhite</a>. English teams that toured Australia at this time were not composed exclusively of the best cricketers in England. The 1884–85 English team, like most earlier tours, contained only professional cricketers; less usually, the team contained nine players who, critics judged, would likely have been in a full-strength England side. Much of the cricket was overshadowed by off-field clashes with the Australian team that had toured England in 1884; the disputes mainly concerned each team's share of match receipts. Peel was required to bowl a large number of <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">overs</a>; in minor matches, mainly played against the odds (where the opposition teams included more players than the English team), he took 321 wickets at an average of less than five. In first-class matches, he was the leading wicket-taker with 35 wickets, but his average of 19.22 was relatively high.

During the tour, Peel made his Test debut and played all five matches. His first Test began on 12 December 1884. Opening the bowling, took eight wickets in the match; in the second innings, he took five for 51 on a pitch affected by rain. He was less effective in the remaining games, ending the series with 21 wickets at an average of 21.47, and scored 37 runs at an average of 7.40. He was not selected in the next Test matches played by England, against Australia in 1886, and missed the next English tour of Australia, in the winter of 1886–87, again organised by Shaw, Shrewsbury and Lillywhite.

In the mid-1880s, the Yorkshire team was generally inconsistent. In 1886, Lord Hawke became Yorkshire's full-time captain. One of his first actions, with the support of the Yorkshire committee, was to sack Peate early in the <a href="1887%20English%20cricket%20season">1887</a> season. At the time, many professional cricketers drank heavily and the Yorkshire team had many players who liked alcohol. Peate had been the chief offender for some years, and while he remained Yorkshire's leading left-arm spinner, his disruptive influence and disregard for authority was having a negative effect on the team. The historian Mick Pope suggests that Hawke may have felt able to act as he knew that Peel was available as a replacement. With Peate unavailable, Peel began to play a leading role. In the 1887 season, a year in which good weather produced conditions generally in favour of batsmen, he took 85 wickets at an average of 17.32. He also improved his record with the bat, scoring 835 runs at 25.30. According to his "Wisden" obituary, he recorded at least two match-winning performances that season: against <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> he took five for 14 and scored 43 runs in a low-scoring game; in the match against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a> he took eleven wickets for 51. Twice in 1887, Peel appeared for the professional Players in their prestigious <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">match against the Gentlemen</a>, the first time he had been selected for the team. He played regularly for them until 1897.

During the winter of 1887–88, the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a> organised another English tour of Australia. The team was mainly composed of amateurs, but Peel was included with three other professionals. At the same time, a rival English team, organised by Shaw, Shrewsbury and Lillywhite, also toured Australia. The resulting confusion affected the attendances at games and the financial success of both tours. The lack of success for the Australian team in this period lessened the quality of Tests and, amid declining spectator interest, touring teams no longer generated profits. In his history of early international cricket, Malcolm Knox observes that "two England teams were coming when Australian cricket was not strong enough to host one". Peel took 49 first-class wickets on the tour, finishing second in the bowling averages for the team, and scored 449 runs in first-class matches at an average of 34.53, which placed him second in the batting averages. Although various matches were played by both teams against combined Australian teams, only one official Test match was played on the tour. The best eleven players from both English teams combined to defeat an Australian team which had several leading players missing; later writers questioned whether the match should have the status of a Test. Peel took nine wickets in the match, including five for 18 in the first innings as Australia were bowled out for 42 runs.

In <a href="1888%20English%20cricket%20season">1888</a>, an unusually rainy summer led to wet pitches which made batting difficult. Peel took 171 first-class wickets, the first time he had passed 100 wickets in a season, at an average of 12.22. He also topped the Yorkshire bowling averages for county matches. His best performance came against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>, when he took eight for 12 in the first innings on the way to fourteen for 33 in the match; for the Players against the Gentlemen, he took six for 34. In the season, Peel scored 669 runs at 13.38. That year, an Australian team toured England and Peel was chosen for his first Test matches in England. The Australian team, missing several key players, won the first Test match before England recovered to win the final two games. Playing all three Tests, Peel took 24 wickets at an average of 7.54. In the decisive third Test, he took seven for 31 in the first Australian innings and finished with match figures of eleven for 68. "Wisden" noted that Peel "bowled remarkably well" in the second Test; it stated that, in the third, "the Australians were helpless against Peel" and judged his overall performance "altogether admirable". Peel's performance in 1888 resulted in his selection, prior to the 1889 season, as one of "Wisden's" "Six Great Bowlers"; this was the first time "Wisden" had made the award which in later years became the prestigious <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">"Wisden" Cricketer of the Year</a>. The citation said: "During his early career [Peel] was contemporary with Peate, and naturally did not get the same chances that have fallen to his lot during the last two years. He has won his way to the very front rank by sheer merit, and bats and fields so well that he would be worth playing in any eleven if he could not get a wicket."

Yorkshire had a poor season in <a href="1889%20English%20cricket%20season">1889</a>, finishing second-from-last in the list of counties; writing in 1904, Holmes described this as "the low-water mark of Yorkshire cricket". The team lost twelve games and won eight, affected by the decline of several leading players. The fielding was poor; Peel had twelve catches dropped from his bowling in one game. Only Peel had a good season, and Holmes pondered: "Where would Yorkshire have been without Peel?" He took 130 wickets at an average of 16.39; with the bat, he scored 991 runs, his best seasonal aggregate to that point, at an average of 22.02. He came top of both the Yorkshire batting and bowling averages and had three times more wickets than any other player. Additionally, he was the only player in the team to score a century in matches against another county;
against <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>, he scored 158 runs, his maiden first-class hundred. At the end of the season, Hawke ended the careers of several players; the Yorkshire president told the committee that the "demon drink" was to blame.

In <a href="1890%20English%20cricket%20season">1890</a>, Peel took 171 wickets at an average of 13.71 and scored 817 runs at 18.56. He missed several Yorkshire games while playing representative matches, but was comfortably their leading bowler with 91 wickets for the county—the next best figure was 37 wickets. The Australians toured England again that year, and Peel took six wickets in the first Test at Lord's. The touring team's results were poor, which resulted in a loss of prestige for the Test matches. The newly formed <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a> was a rival attraction, and several players were withdrawn from the England team to play for their counties—<a href="Andrew%20Stoddart">Andrew Stoddart</a>, for example, was withdrawn by Middlesex before the first Test. With Middlesex due to play Yorkshire, Stoddart was also withdrawn from the second Test; upon finding this out, Lord Hawke withdrew his Yorkshire players from the England XI, including Peel. In the Middlesex–Yorkshire game, Peel dismissed Stoddart twice. The third Test was rained off completely.

During the <a href="1891%20English%20cricket%20season">1891</a> season, Peel took 99 wickets at 17.35 and scored 971 runs at 24.27, including his second first-class century, but Yorkshire again performed poorly. This prompted a reorganisation of the club over the following two years. Peel led the Yorkshire batting averages and came second in the bowling. In the winter of 1891–92, he was included in the touring team to Australia organised by <a href="Henry%20Holroyd%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Sheffield">Lord Sheffield</a> and captained by <a href="W.%20G.%20Grace">W. G. Grace</a>. He came fourth in the team's bowling averages with 15 wickets at 18.86 and finished fifth in the batting averages with 229 runs at 25.44. He played in all three Test matches, taking six wickets at 21.33, and scoring 134 runs at 26.80. In the third game, he scored 83, his first Test match fifty, but did not bowl; the <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> cricketer <a href="Johnny%20Briggs%20%28cricketer%29">Johnny Briggs</a> bowled Australia out on a rain-damaged pitch but this was England's only victory as Australia won the series 2–1.

In first-class matches during <a href="1892%20English%20cricket%20season">1892</a>, Peel scored 772 runs at 19.79 and took 121 wickets at 16.80. Additionally, in a non-first-class games against Leicestershire, he scored 226 as well as taking five wickets in Leicestershire's first innings. In the <a href="1893%20English%20cricket%20season">1893</a> season, he took slightly more wickets at a lower average (126 at 14.51) but his run aggregate fell to 550 runs at 13.75. He was part of a successful Yorkshire team. The county won their first official County Championship title and the team was no longer as dependent on Peel with the ball—<a href="Ted%20Wainwright">Ted Wainwright</a> took more wickets than he did. The Australians toured England once again, but Peel played in just one of the three Test matches. He did not take a wicket, did little with the bat, and was left out of the team for the second Test. As the Australians had proved poor on the field, Lord Hawke withdrew Peel and <a href="Stanley%20Jackson">Stanley Jackson</a> from the team for the third Test so that they could play for Yorkshire. In <a href="1894%20English%20cricket%20season">1894</a>, Peel scored 699 runs at 16.25, failing to score a half-century. With the ball, he took 145 wickets at 13.44. During the season, he was awarded a <a href="Benefit%20%28sports%29">benefit match</a> at Bradford, which raised £2,000. The retirement of <a href="George%20Ulyett">George Ulyett</a> that season made Peel the team's senior professional, an important position at the time.

During the 1894 season, the Melbourne Cricket Club and the trustees of the <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a> combined to organise another English tour of Australia. They asked Andrew Stoddart to raise a team, and Peel was chosen. Peel was successful in the opening first-class matches of the tour. He took five wickets in an innings against <a href="South%20Australia%20cricket%20team">South Australia</a>, <a href="Victoria%20cricket%20team">Victoria</a> and <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a>; after three games, he had taken 23 wickets, and he and Briggs provided the main threat with the ball. Against Victoria, Peel also scored 48 and 65 with the bat. He played a leading role in the first Test, which "Wisden" described as "probably the most sensational match ever played either in Australia or in England". Australia scored 586 in their first innings; England scored 325 and, <a href="Follow-on">following-on</a>, scored 437 to leave a target of 177 to win. At the end of the fifth day's play, Australia had scored 113 for two, and were overwhelming favourites to win.

Until then, Peel had been ineffective in the match. Several of the England team, including Peel, drank heavily in the night thinking the game was lost, but overnight rain drastically changed the nature of the pitch. Peel had not sobered up when play was scheduled to start, although Stoddart had given him a cold shower to speed up the process, and arrived late. As another player was also missing, the start was delayed; this allowed the pitch to dry further and therefore become more <a href="Sticky%20wicket">sticky</a> and difficult to bat on. Peel had slept through the overnight storm and was astonished when he saw the state of the pitch, suspecting someone had watered it. He reportedly said: "Gi' me t'ball, Mr Stoddart. Ah'll get t'buggers out before lunch". With Briggs, Peel bowled Australia out, taking five wickets to go with the one he took the previous evening to finish with six for 67. Australia scored 166 and lost by ten runs. One Australian newspaper reported that Peel "found the match rather a trying one, and came in fairly done up". The English team were praised for fighting back, but the role of the weather was acknowledged, and some critics blamed the Australians for batting badly in the second innings.

England won the second Test; after both teams' first innings were low-scoring, Peel, appearing at number six, batted for 150 minutes in the second innings to score 53 without hitting any <a href="Boundary%20%28cricket%29%23Scoring%20runs">fours</a>. Stoddart's 173 set Australia a big target, and Peel took four for 77 to bowl England to a 94-run win. Australia won the third Test by 382 runs; Peel took four wickets in the game, but was dismissed in both innings without scoring. It is possible that around this time, Peel was threatened by Stoddart with expulsion from the tour owing to his drinking. Australia won the fourth Test to level the series at 2–2. In very favourable bowling conditions, Peel took three for 74 but Australia totalled 284. England were bowled out twice to give Australia an <a href="Result%20%28cricket%29%23Statement%20of%20result">innings victory</a>, and Peel suffered his second consecutive <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23P">pair</a> (i.e. failing to score in either innings). He was the first player to score four successive <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">ducks</a> in Test cricket, a succession of failures not repeated until 1936, and this remained the record number of successive ducks until 1985.

Amid great public interest—the game was advertised as "the match of the century"—and great tension, the decisive final Test match was played. Peel took four wickets in Australia's first innings, then scored 73 runs in England's first innings, sharing a 162-run partnership with <a href="Archie%20MacLaren">Archie MacLaren</a>. In Australia's second innings, Peel took three more wickets to return match figures of seven for 203 in 94 overs. <a href="Jack%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Jack Brown</a> scored a century to guide England towards a target of 297, and Peel eventually hit the winning runs. Peel ended the series with 27 wickets at 26.70, second in the averages behind <a href="Tom%20Richardson%20%28cricketer%29">Tom Richardson</a>, and 168 runs at 18.67, placing him sixth in the batting averages. David Frith suggests that this series was vital in establishing the importance of Test cricket, and that the interest felt in both England and Australia, and the coverage by the press, set up the pattern and expectations of future Test series. In all first-class games, Peel scored 421 runs at 21.05, to be eighth in the averages, and took 57 wickets at 25.28, placing him third in the averages behind Richardson and Briggs, although the latter had fewer wickets.

Returning to England for the <a href="1895%20English%20cricket%20season">1895</a> season, Peel took 180 wickets, the most he took in any season, at an average of 14.97. This included the best figures of his career when he took nine for 22 against Somerset; in total he took fifteen wickets in that match, and "Wisden" described this performance as "causing a sensation". He led the Yorkshire bowling averages, and <a href="George%20Hirst">George Hirst</a> became his regular partner opening the bowling. Both men took over 130 wickets for Yorkshire that season and the pair established an effective bowling partnership until the end of Peel's career. With the bat in 1895, Peel scored 847 runs at 17.28. In 1896, Peel performed the <a href="double%20%28cricket%29">double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets</a> for the only time in his first-class career. In a dry summer which favoured batsmen, his wickets came at a higher average: he took 128 at 17.50, but he scored 1,206 runs at 30.15, his best batting aggregate and average in an English season. He came third in the Yorkshire batting averages, and often succeeded in scoring runs when the team were under pressure. Against <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a>, he scored 210 <a href="not%20out">not out</a>, the highest first-class innings of his career, and one of four centuries in the innings, out of a Yorkshire total of 887. A contemporary critic described Peel's innings as the best ever played by a left-hander. He shared a partnership of 292 for the eighth wicket with Lord Hawke. As of 2017, this remains Yorkshire's highest partnership for that wicket, and the fifth-highest eighth-wicket partnership recorded in first-class cricket. He also took a <a href="Hat-trick%23Cricket">hat-trick</a> against Kent.

The Australians played three Tests in England in 1896, but Peel only played in the final one. Before the match, several English professionals—not including Peel—threatened to strike, but the dispute was settled. Then, before the third day of the game, the pitch was mysteriously watered, becoming very difficult for batting. Australia only needed a small total, but Peel believed that he could bowl them out. He took six of the last seven Australian wickets at a cost of 23 runs to bowl England to victory; in recognition of this achievement, Stanley Jackson, a teammate in this game, gave him a gold watch-chain ornament. He was less successful with the bat, scoring a pair once again. This was his final Test match. In total, Peel played 20 Tests, scoring 427 runs at an average of 14.72 and taking 101 wickets at 16.98.

In January 1897, the Australian <a href="Fred%20Spofforth">Fred Spofforth</a> claimed in a letter to the "Sporting Life" that Peel occasionally <a href="throwing%20%28cricket%29">threw</a> the ball, an accusation he also levelled at <a href="Tom%20McKibbin">Tom McKibbin</a>, an Australian bowler. Spofforth wrote that Peel "has no need to resort to throwing. I acknowledge that he does not often take to it, still, it is well known to cricketers that at times he does 'shy' [throw]." Peel denied this and claimed that leading umpires would support him.

In the <a href="1897%20English%20cricket%20season">1897</a> season, Peel was suspended by Yorkshire for drunkenness. Alcohol was popular with many professional cricketers, and the careers of several Yorkshire players in this period, including Peate, had been ended for this reason. Peel was always known to be a heavy drinker, but his behaviour had been tolerated. His fame, brought about by his performances, made the problem worse. Derek Hodgson, in the official Yorkshire club history, writes: "A cheerful, gregarious man, [Peel] took to hospitality and entertaining with alacrity and moved in such society, particularly in London, that when one of the foremost journalists of the day asked to see him he was fobbed off by a man who announced himself as 'Peel's secretary', adding: 'He does not like interviews and has little to say. He sent me to take his place.'" Hodgson observes: "It is not impossible, of course, that Bobby was either shy, or 'indisposed' at that particular moment", and suggests that Peel's downfall, like Peate's before him, was because he "was too often the toast of the town".
In 1897, Peel had played regularly until July with some success. He scored 115 against Leicestershire, and took eight for 53 against Kent. He then suffered an injury in a match against Lancashire that caused him to miss around a month of cricket. He returned to the Yorkshire team to play Middlesex at Sheffield on 16 August. In Middlesex's first innings, Peel took five for 71, but on the third day, he appeared on the field drunk. Later that day, the Yorkshire committee met and resolved to suspend Peel for the remainder of the season for "presenting himself on the field in a state of intoxication". According to Anthony Woodhouse, in his history of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, this was not Peel's first such offence. Contemporary accounts give no indication of trouble on the field involving Peel, but the influential Lord Hawke may have encouraged the press to remain silent. The decision to suspend Peel was made public on 19 August, the following day.

There are several conflicting versions of what happened on the field in the Middlesex game. On the morning of 19 August, replying to suggestions that he was drunk, Peel spoke to a newspaper reporter and stated: "Before I went on the ground at Sheffield—I don't blush to say it—I had two small glasses of gin and water. At luncheon time I had nothing". Peel said that he opened the bowling with Stanley Jackson and was eventually rested without a word being said to him. He stated that he later slipped twice while fielding, but the cause was that the spikes on his boots were broken. That evening, when he went to collect his wages at the end of the game, the Yorkshire secretary, <a href="Joseph%20Wolstenholme">Joseph Wolstenholme</a>, informed him of the suspension on the grounds that his play was "unsatisfactory", and when pressed by Peel for an explanation, he told him: "You have had a glass too much".

The cricket writer A. A. Thompson relates a different story told to him fifty years later by Hirst, who played in the match. According to this account, Hirst was having breakfast when Peel came in drunk. Anxious that Peel would be seen, and worried about bringing the team into disrepute, Hirst forced Peel to return to bed and went to the ground, where he told Lord Hawke that Peel had been taken ill in the night and would not be able to play. Hawke promised to see Peel that evening and took the <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">twelfth man</a> onto the field. According to Thompson, when Hirst went onto the field, he saw "with dawning dismay that there were not eleven fieldsmen present but twelve. There, his face red, his cap awry, the ball in his hand, stood Peel". Peel was even more drunk than at breakfast, and Hawke ordered him from the field. Peel replied that he was fine, and according to Hirst bowled a ball to demonstrate his fitness, but in his confusion did so in the wrong direction. Peel was then led from the field. After falling asleep in the hotel, he was advised by Hirst to apologise to Lord Hawke, but refused, claiming that he was indispensable to the team and would be recalled.

A different, widely circulated story suggests that Peel urinated on the pitch before being dismissed by Hawke. Woodhouse, writing in 1989, suggested that "it is difficult to ascertain the truth behind this long-standing tale", while Hodgson observes: "I have never been convinced of this account because it has always seemed to be so much out of character for a cricketer of that time when so much stress was placed upon behaving 'like a gentleman' even in one's cups." Mick Pope writes: "The more recent accusation that Peel urinated on the pitch remains unjust, unproven and such a myth ... that it should have no place in any study of Bobby Peel, the cricketer." The story originated in a cricket publication, "Cricket Quarterly", in 1968. The historian Rowland Bowen, in an article called "Fresh Light on the Dismissal of R Peel in 1897", claimed that an "aged Yorkshireman of 85" told him that Peel had urinated and that this was a common practice then. Subsequent research by the historian Irving Rosewater established that Bowen's information came to him second-hand. The 85-year-old had not used the word "urinated" but had actually said "pissed at the wicket", meaning that Peel was drunk ("pissed" being slang for drunk) on the pitch ("at the wicket"). Rosewater suggests that this was merely repetition of the already known story, not the new information claimed by Bowen. Rosewater self-published his findings in a book called "An Unjust Slur on Bobby Peel" in 1997.

Peel, having concluded that the suspension would end his Yorkshire career, signed a contract to play for <a href="Accrington%20Cricket%20Club">Accrington Cricket Club</a>. He told a newspaper that he regarded his suspension as unfair, that he had been given no opportunity to explain, and that he had taken the appointment with Accrington to provide for himself and his family. In 1900, he told "Cricket" magazine that, before his suspension, he had been bedridden for three weeks as a result of an injury he suffered while batting, that he played against Middlesex with some success and was then suspended without any explanation. He later said of the incident: "[Lord Hawke] put his arm around me and escorted me off the field and out of Yorkshire cricket. What a gentleman". The journalist Harry Pearson suggests that this was "either very gracious, or exceedingly sarcastic." Hawke later described Peel's sacking as "the most decisive action of my whole career ... It had to be done for the sake of discipline and the good of cricket. Nothing ever gave me so much pain." At the time, Hawke believed these events cost Yorkshire the County Championship, but the team had only two more games to play in that season's competition, and it was mathematically impossible for them to win. Hirst told Thompson that Hawke was always sorry that Peel had to be sacked, and that whenever the pair met afterwards, they remained friends and that neither bore the other any animosity. Although Peel considered himself indispensable, the following year he was replaced by <a href="Wilfred%20Rhodes">Wilfred Rhodes</a>, who remained in the team until 1930 and took 4,184 first-class wickets. Peel remained popular with the people of Morley in the aftermath of his dismissal, and they supported him rather than believing the reports.

Peel made two further first-class appearances in 1897 after his suspension by Yorkshire. He played in two end-of-season festival games at Hastings, first for the North against the South and then for the Players against the Gentlemen, but did little with bat or ball. In all first-class games that year he took 72 wickets at 19.51 and scored 566 runs at 22.64. His only other appearances in first-class cricket came in 1899, when he played for <a href="A.%20J.%20Webbe">A. J. Webbe</a>'s XI against <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a> and for an England XI against the touring Australians. He ended his first-class career with 12,191 first-class runs at an average of 19.44 and 1,775 wickets at 16.20.

In <a href="1898%20English%20cricket%20season">1898</a>, Peel played for Accrington. His signing was widely reported in the press. Before this, most professionals in league cricket were neither famous names nor particularly good cricketers. According to Pearson, in his survey of club cricket in the north of England, Peel was the first international cricketer to play in a league. He took 80 wickets that season, but only received a third of his salary; the committee withheld the rest because of unspecified problems during the season. His contract was not renewed and he instead became the professional at Morley. Pearson suggests that Peel's signing showed the clubs that big-name signings could bring benefits. Peel also accepted a position as a coach at Essex in 1899, and remained there until at least 1904. The press suggested that he would qualify for Essex, but he never played for that team. He later became the landlord of a public house in Churwell. In 1923 he resumed his connection with Yorkshire when he undertook a coaching and scouting programme for the county, in association with George Hirst, organised by the "Yorkshire Evening News". Peel remained close to the Yorkshire players. When the four Yorkshire members of the English team that toured Australia in 1932–33 departed from Leeds, Peel was present and gave each of them a white rose—the symbol of Yorkshire. He attended the funeral of <a href="Roy%20Kilner">Roy Kilner</a> in 1928, and was one of many Yorkshire cricketers to attend the memorial service for Lord Hawke in 1938. Peel continued to play cricket and coach locally into his seventies. In his later years, he worked in a woollen mill in Morley.

Peel was married in 1878; he and his wife, Annie Louise, were married for over fifty years and had four children, one of whom was killed in the First World War. Peel's wife died in 1933. Peel lived until 1941, when he died at the house of his daughter. Among those who attended his funeral were Hirst and Rhodes.

"Wisden" said that as a bowler, Peel had a "fine length, easy action and splendid command of spin", which meant that he "was often a match-winner". Peel consistently bowled a <a href="good%20length%20ball">good length</a> and varied the <a href="flight%20%28cricket%29">flight</a> of the ball to deceive batsmen. He also bowled a quicker ball which, in contrast to his usual delivery, travelled in a straight line instead of turning. On a pitch affected by rain, batsmen found him very difficult to face, and he was very successful in these conditions. When bowling on pitches where the ball came more slowly off the surface, Peel often bowled faster; this pace made it difficult for batsmen to score runs against him even when conditions were in their favour. After he delivered the ball, the spin he imparted often made it curve in the air before it reached the batsman. According to Woodhouse, when bowling, "Peel brought his arm behind his back with a peculiar flourish-like action and then 'whipped the ball down. He generally opened the bowling, including when he played for England. At the time, it was general practice to open the bowling with a fast bowler and a left-arm spinner.

Peel was the first English bowler to take 100 Test wickets against Australia. At a time when international matches were relatively rare, his 20 Test matches were a considerable achievement, and it was unusual for a player to tour Australia as often as he did: he went there four times. His main rival as a spinner and for a place in the England team was Johnny Briggs; Peel bowled faster, which made him harder to hit. Archie MacLaren, who captained England from the late 1890s and was a team-mate and captain of Briggs, described Peel as "the cleverest bowler of my time". MacLaren stated that Peel thoroughly understood tactics and could spot weaknesses in a batsman's technique. He concluded: "I place Peel first on my list of great left-handed bowlers on account of his wonderful judgement, his diabolical cleverness and his great natural ability." When Rhodes took over the role of left-arm spin bowler in the Yorkshire team, there was some debate over who out of Peate, Peel and Rhodes was the best left-arm spinner to play for Yorkshire. Historians regard Peel as part of a long-lasting chain of successful Yorkshire left-arm spinners, preceded by Peate and succeeded by Rhodes.

"Wisden" described Peel as a "punishing left-handed batsman". Batting in the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Middle%20order">middle order</a>, he was often effective when other batsmen had failed. For England, he most often batted at number six. "Wisden" also called him "a capital fieldsman, especially at cover-point".

During his playing days, Peel was famous and well-respected—the actor <a href="Henry%20Ainley">Henry Ainley</a> claimed that the highlight of his life was carrying Peel's bag. According to the historian David Frith, Peel was not a considerate husband. Frith also suggests that he was sometimes involved in embarrassing situations; for example, when <a href="Ranjitsinhji">Ranjitsinhji</a> invited him on a hunting trip, "Peel blasted eight barrels at a hare, removing its legs, an ear and much else before chasing the remnants of the animal into a neighbouring property, still firing away, until all life was extinguished". Frith believes that Peel had a "perverse" character, exemplified by Lord Hawke's comment that he showed no pleasure at his many successes. Pearson suggests that some of Peel's problems may have been connected to depression, but Frith records that he mellowed in later life.

Retiarius

A retiarius (plural retiarii; literally, "net-man" or "net-fighter" or fisherman in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>) was a <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> <a href="gladiator">gladiator</a> who fought with equipment styled on that of a <a href="fisherman">fisherman</a>: a <a href="net%20casting">weighted net</a> ("rete", hence the name), a three-pointed <a href="trident">trident</a> ("fuscina" or "tridens"), and a <a href="dagger">dagger</a> ("<a href="pugio">pugio</a>"). The "retiarius" was lightly armoured, wearing an arm guard ("<a href="lorica%20manica">manica</a>") and a shoulder guard ("galerus"). Typically, his clothing consisted only of a loincloth ("subligaculum") held in place by a wide belt, or of a short <a href="tunic">tunic</a> with light padding. He wore no head protection or footwear.

The "retiarius" was routinely pitted against a heavily armed "<a href="secutor">secutor</a>". The net-fighter made up for his lack of protective gear by using his speed and agility to avoid his opponent's attacks and waiting for the opportunity to strike. He first tried to throw his net over his rival. If this succeeded, he attacked with his trident while his adversary was entangled. Another tactic was to ensnare his enemy's weapon in the net and pull it out of his grasp, leaving the opponent defenseless. Should the net miss or the "secutor" grab hold of it, the "retiarius" likely discarded the weapon, although he might try to collect it back for a second cast. Usually, the "retiarius" had to rely on his trident and dagger to finish the fight. The trident, as tall as a human being, permitted the gladiator to jab quickly and keep his distance. It was a strong weapon, capable of inflicting piercing wounds on an unprotected skull or limb. The dagger was the "retiarius"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s final backup should the trident be lost. It was reserved for when close combat or a straight wrestling match had to settle the bout. In some battles, a single "retiarius" faced two "secutores" simultaneously. For these situations, the lightly armoured gladiator was placed on a raised platform and given a supply of stones with which to repel his pursuers.

"Retiarii" first appeared in the arena during the 1st century <a href="Common%20Era">AD</a> and had become standard attractions by the 2nd or 3rd century. The gladiator's lack of armour and his reliance on evasive tactics meant that many considered the "retiarius" the lowliest (and most effeminate) of an already <a href="Social%20stigma">stigmatised</a> (i.e. gladiators) class. Passages from the works of <a href="Juvenal">Juvenal</a>, <a href="Seneca%20the%20Younger">Seneca</a>, and <a href="Suetonius">Suetonius</a> suggest that those "retiarii" who fought in tunics may have constituted an even more demeaned subtype ("retiarii tunicati") who were not viewed as legitimate "retiarii" fighters but as arena clowns. Nevertheless, Roman artwork, graffiti, and grave markers include examples of specific net-men who apparently had reputations as skilled combatants and lovers.

<a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> <a href="gladiator">gladiator</a>s fell into stock "<a href="list%20of%20Roman%20gladiator%20types">categories</a>" modelled on real-world precedents. Almost all of these classes were based on military antecedents; the "retiarius" ("net-fighter" or "net-man"), which was themed after the sea, was one exception. Rare gladiator fights were staged over water; these may have given rise to the concept of a gladiator based on a <a href="fisherman">fisherman</a>. Fights between differently armed gladiators became popular in the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Imperial</a> period; the "retiarius" versus the scaly "secutor" developed as the conflict of a fisherman with a stylised fish. The earlier "<a href="murmillo">murmillo</a>nes" had borne a fish on their helmets; the "secutores" with their scaly armour evolved from them. However, because of the stark differences in arms and armour between the two types, the pairing pushed such practices to new extremes. Roman art and literature make no mention of "retiarii" until the early Imperial period; for example, the type is absent from the copious gladiator-themed reliefs dating to the 1st century found at <a href="Chieti">Chieti</a> and <a href="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>. Nevertheless, graffiti and artifacts from Pompeii attest to the class's existence by this time. Fights between "retiarii" and "secutores" probably became popular as early as the middle of the 1st century CE, and the net-fighter became one of the standard gladiator categories by the 2nd or 3rd century CE and remained a staple attraction until the end of the gladiatorial games. In addition to the <a href="conflict%20%28narrative%29">man-versus-nature</a> symbolism inherent in such bouts, the lightly armoured "retiarius" was viewed as the effeminate counterpoint to the manly, heavily armoured "secutor". The "retiarius" was also seen as water to the "secutor"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fire, one constantly moving and escaping, the other determinedly inescapable. Another gladiator type, the "<a href="laquearius">laquearius</a>" ("noose-man"), was similar to the "retiarius" but fought with a <a href="lasso">lasso</a> in place of a net.

The more skin left unarmoured and exposed, the lower a gladiator's status and the greater his perceived <a href="effeminacy">effeminacy</a>. Likewise, the engulfing net may have been seen as a feminine symbol. The light arms and armour of the "retiarius" thus established him as the lowliest, most disgraced, and most effeminate of the gladiator types. Helmets allowed both gladiators and spectators to dehumanise the fighters; when an arena combatant had to kill a comrade-at-arms, someone he probably lived and trained with every day, his opponent's helmet added an extra layer of separation. However, the "retiarius" was allowed no head protection; his face was visible to all. The emperor <a href="Claudius">Claudius</a> had all net-fighters who lost in combat put to death so that spectators could enjoy their expressions of agony. The "retiarius"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fighting style was another strike against him, as reliance on speed and evasion were viewed as undignified in comparison to the straightforward trading of blows. The "retiarii" lived in the worst barracks. Some members of the class trained to fight as <a href="Samnite%20%28gladiator%20type%29">Samnites</a>, another gladiator type, in order to improve their status.

There is evidence that those net-men wearing tunics, known as "retiarii tunicati", formed a special sub-class, one even more demeaned than their loincloth-wearing colleagues. The Roman satirist <a href="Juvenal">Juvenal</a> wrote that: So even the lanista's establishment is better ordered than yours, for he separates the vile from the decent, and sequesters even from their fellow-"retiarii" the wearers of the ill-famed tunic; in the training-school, and even in gaol, such creatures herd apart….

The passage suggests that tunic-wearing "retiarii" were trained for a different role, "in servitude, under strict discipline and even possibly under some restraints." Certain effeminate men mentioned by <a href="Seneca%20the%20Younger">Seneca the Younger</a> in his "<a href="Quaestiones%20naturales">Quaestiones naturales</a>" were trained as gladiators and may correspond to Juvenal's tunic-wearing "retiarii". <a href="Suetonius">Suetonius</a> reports this anecdote: "Once a band of five "retiarii" in tunics, matched against the same number of "secutores", yielded without a struggle; but when their death was ordered, one of them caught up his trident and slew all the victors." The reaction of Emperor <a href="Caligula">Caligula</a> showed the disgust with which he viewed the gladiators' actions: "Caligula bewailed this in a public proclamation as a most cruel murder, and expressed his horror of those who had had the heart to witness it." The fate of the "retiarii" is not revealed. This was probably not a standard competition, as real gladiators did not surrender so easily. Rather, such tunic-wearing net-men may have served as comic relief in the gladiatorial programming.

Juvenal's second satire, wherein he deplores the immorality he perceived in Roman society, introduces a member of the <a href="Gracchi">Gracchus family</a> who is described as a homosexual married (in female persona) to a horn player. Gracchus later appears in the arena:Greater still the portent when Gracchus, clad in a tunic, played the gladiator, and fled, trident in hand, across the arena—Gracchus, a man of nobler birth than the Capitolini, or the Marcelli, or the descendants of Catulus or Paulus, or the Fabii: nobler than all the spectators in the podium; not excepting him who gave the show at which that net was flung.Gracchus appears once again in Juvenal's eighth satire as the worst example of the noble Romans who have disgraced themselves by appearing in public spectacles and popular entertainments:

To crown all this [scandal], what is left but the amphitheatre? And this disgrace of the city you have as well—Gracchus not fighting as equipped as a Mirmillo, with buckler or falchion (for he condemns—yes, condemns and hates such equipment). Nor does he conceal his face beneath a helmet. See! he wields a trident. When he has cast without effect the nets suspended from his poised right hand, he boldly lifts his uncovered face to the spectators, and, easily to be recognized, flees across the whole arena. We can not mistake the tunic, since the ribbon of gold reaches from his neck, and flutters in the breeze from his high-peaked cap. Therefore, the disgrace, which the Secutor had to submit to, in being forced to fight with Gracchus, was worse than any wound.
The passage is obscure, but Cerutti and Richardson argue that Gracchus begins the fight as a loincloth-wearing "retiarius". When the tide turns against him, he dons a tunic and a womanish wig ("spira"), apparently part of the same costume, and thus enjoys a reprieve, although this attire may not itself have been considered effeminate as it was also worn by the priests of <a href="Mars%20%28mythology%29">Mars</a> of whom Gracchus was the chief priest. The change of clothing seems to turn a serious fight into a comical one and shames his opponent. It is unusual to see a gladiator depicted this way in a satire, as such fighters usually take the role of men who are "brawny, brutal, sexually successful with women of both high and low status, but especially the latter, ill-educated if not uneducated, and none too bright intellectually." The "retiarius tunicatus" in the satire is the opposite: "a mock gladiatorial figure, of equivocal sex, regularly dressed in costume of some sort, possibly usually as a woman, and matched against a "secutor" or "murmillo" in a mock gladiatorial exhibition."

Despite their low status, some "retiarii" became quite popular throughout the <a href="Principate">early Empire</a>. The fact that spectators could see net-fighters' faces humanised them and probably added to their popularity. At Pompeii, graffiti tells of Crescens or Cresces the "retiarius", "lord of the girls" and "doctor to nighttime girls, morning girls, and all the rest." Evidence suggests that some homosexual men fancied gladiators, and the "retiarius" would have been particularly appealing. Roman art depicts net-men just as often as other types. A mosaic found in 2007 in a bathhouse at the <a href="Villa%20dei%20Quintili">Villa dei Quintili</a> shows a "retiarius" named Montanus. The fact that his name is recorded indicates that the gladiator was famous. The mosaic dates to c. CE 130, when the Quintilii family had the home built; the emperor <a href="Commodus">Commodus</a>, who fought in gladiatorial bouts as a "secutor", acquired the house in CE 182 and used it as a country villa. In modern times, popular culture has made the "retiarius" probably the most famous type of gladiator.

The "retiarius" is the most readily identifiable gladiator type, due to his signature equipment: arm guard ("<a href="lorica%20manica">manica</a>"), shoulder guard ("galerus"), <a href="net%20%28device%29">net</a> ("rete"), <a href="trident">trident</a> ("fuscina" or "tridens"), and <a href="dagger">dagger</a> ("<a href="pugio">pugio</a>"). (Technically, the "retiarius" was not a "gladiator" at all, since he did not fight with the sword—"<a href="gladius">gladius</a>"—after which such fighters took their name.) His weapons and armour could be decorated. An embellished gladiatorial dagger is held at the <a href="Naples%20National%20Archaeological%20Museum">Naples National Archaeological Museum</a>. Archaeologists have excavated three engraved shoulder guards from the gladiator barracks at Pompeii: one is engraved with illustrations of an anchor, a crab, and a dolphin; another with <a href="cupid">cupid</a>s and the head of <a href="Hercules">Hercules</a>; and a third with weapons and the inscription "RET/SECUND" (""retiarius", second rank").

Although the net ("rete") was this gladiator's signature weapon, few depictions of the device survive. Combat with throwing nets may have occurred on ancient battlefields, but modern experiments and comparisons with modern fishing nets offer the only clues as to how the gladiatorial net was constructed. Such data indicate that the "rete" was circular, with a wide mesh about in diameter and lead weights along the edges. A rope ran around the perimeter of the mesh, with the ends tied to the gladiator's wrist. Because it was thrown, the net was sometimes called a "iaculum".

The "retiarius" complemented his net with an iron or bronze trident ("fuscina", "fascina" or, rarely, "tridens") that stood about as high as a human being. A skull found in a gladiator graveyard in <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a>, Turkey, shows puncture holes consistent with a trident strike. The wounds are apart and match a bronze trident excavated from Ephesus harbour in 1989. The trident's prongs are long.

A long, straight-bladed dagger ("pugio") was the gladiator's final weapon. A tombstone found in Romania shows a "retiarius" holding a dagger with four spikes (known as a "quadrens"—each spike at the corner of a square <a href="Guard%20%28weapon%29">guard</a>) instead of the usual bladed dagger. This was previously thought to be an artistic invention or perhaps a ceremonial weapon but a recently excavated <a href="femur">femur</a> bone from a gladiator graveyard in Ephesus has wounds consistent with the use of such a weapon.

The "retiarius" wore minimal armour; unlike other gladiator types, he wore no helmet, greaves, or shield. He wore a "<a href="Lorica%20manica">manica</a>" on his left arm, where other gladiators wore it on the right; this allowed him to more fluidly make a right-handed cast of his net. Attached to the top of this was a long bronze or leather guard over the upper left arm and shoulder, known as a "galerus". This guard extended beyond the shoulder blade and flared outward, allowing free movement of the gladiator's head. The device protected the upper arm, head and face when the "retiarius" kept his left side to his opponent. The armour was designed to let the net-man duck his head behind it, and it was curved so as to deflect a blow from the top downwards, not up towards the eyes. Three examples of this protective gear found at Pompeii vary between in length and about the same in width. They weigh about .

In the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a> in later years, some "retiarii" wore a <a href="mail%20%28armour%29">chainmail</a> "manica" instead of the "galerus". This mail covered the arm and upper chest. Equipment styles stayed relatively fixed in the <a href="Western%20Roman%20Empire">Western Empire</a>.

Besides these items, the "retiarius" wore only a <a href="loincloth">loincloth</a> ("subligaculum") held in place by a wide belt and gaiters or, as images show in lieu of the loincloth, a <a href="tunic">tunic</a> that left the right shoulder uncovered. He wore fabric padding on his body to provide minimal additional protection. Artistic depictions show that other options included legbands, anklebands, a headband, and a medallion. All told, the "retiarius"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s equipment weighed 7 to to 17.6 lb), making him the lightest of the standard gladiator types. Like other arena combatants, the "retiarius" fought barefoot.

The "retiarius" was traditionally pitted against a "secutor" or, possibly on rare occasions, a "<a href="murmillo">murmillo</a>". Despite the disparity between the nearly nude net-fighter and his heavily armoured adversary, modern re-enactments and experiments show that the "retiarius" was by no means outmatched. His lack of heavy equipment meant that he could use speed and evasion to his advantage. He also fought with three offensive weapons to his opponent's one. The net-fighter had to avoid close combat at all costs, keep his distance, and wait for an opening to stab with his trident or throw his net. The name "secutor" means "pursuer" or "chaser", because this gladiator had to chase down the "retiarius". They were also known as "contraretiarii" ("those against the net-man"). The "secutor"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s strategy was to keep behind his shield ("<a href="scutum%20%28shield%29">scutum</a>") and force his opponent into close combat so that he could strike with his sword. In close quarters, the net-man had only his "galerus" shoulder guard for defence; its design forced him to keep his head ducked down behind it. The "secutor"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s helmet greatly restricted his sight, hearing, and airflow. Coupled with the heavy weight of his arms and armour—the gear of a "murmillo", of which the "secutor" was a variant, weighed —this gladiator was in greater danger of exhausting himself in a long fight. One of the "retiarius"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s tactics was to jab at the "secutor"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s shield (the heaviest part of his equipment), forcing him to block and wear himself out. Overall, Roman oddsmakers gave an advantage to a "retiarius", although skill and experience could affect the odds in individual matches.

In skilled hands, the net was a useful weapon. The "retiarius"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s primary objective with it was to capture his opponent. A ewer found at <a href="Rheinzabern">Rheinzabern</a> demonstrates the throwing technique: the "retiarius" held the net folded up in his right hand and cast it underhanded. He held his trident and dagger in his left hand, careful to keep the trident's prongs pointed downward to avoid snagging it in the mesh. If the toss missed, the "retiarius" used the drawrope tied to his wrist to bring the net back in hand. On a successful cast, the gladiator tightened the drawcord around the net's perimeter and tried to unbalance or topple his rival. A successful cast of the net could win the battle for the "retiarius" straightaway. This was not certain, however, as a mosaic at the <a href="National%20Archaeological%20Museum%20of%20Spain">National Archaeological Museum</a> in Madrid shows: in the first panel, the "retiarius" Kalendio has caught his opponent, a "secutor" named Astyanax, in his net. In the later image, however, Kalendio lies on the ground, wounded, and raises his dagger to surrender. The inscription above Kalendio shows the sign for "null", implying that the match organisers ordered him killed.

The net could ensnare the "secutor"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s weapon to disarm him and snag away his shield to put him at a significant disadvantage. Other "retiarius" tricks were to whip the net at his opponent's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him. The helmet of the "secutor" was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net. In most cases, the "secutor" knew to expect the net-man's tactics and tried to intercept and hold on to the weapon, possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net. In such danger, the "retiarius" could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger. The "secutor" stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it. Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the "retiarius" used his net. Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net, yet the class is named for the device, and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a "retiarius" in his satires. The discrepancy may simply be a case of <a href="artistic%20licence">artistic licence</a>; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance, and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict. The lack of nets in "retiarius" images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility is that some "retiarii" simply did not use nets.
In most bouts, the "retiarius" probably had to resort to fighting with just his trident and dagger, placing him at a disadvantage. The trident was his primary weapon in such situations, and its length allowed the "retiarius" to keep his opponent at bay. He held the weapon two-handed, left nearer the prongs, so that he could parry his enemy's strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends. Wielded two-handed, the weapon could land powerful blows. Images show "retiarii" stabbing downward at the "secutor"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s unshielded legs or stabbing down at the helmet in an attempt to poke through an eyehole. The trident itself was too weak to pierce the metal, although a skull found at Ephesus, Turkey, dating to CE 200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to the head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent. The "secutor"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s helmet was rounded and free of protrusions to avoid snaring the net or being caught in the trident's prongs, but attacks on it forced the "secutor" to duck or hide behind his shield. This reduced his field of vision and gave the "retiarius" an advantage with his speed. Should the "secutor" strike with his sword, the "retiarius" parried with the trident prongs and attempted to disarm him. Likewise, the more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block the trident with his shield and force the net-man to lose it. Another type of gladiator, <a href="scissor%20%28gladiator%29">scissor</a> could also be pitted against a "retiarius". Images from the Eastern Roman Empire show "scissores" wearing a tubular arm-guard in lieu of a shield. The guard fits over the left hand and ends in a hooked, knife-like blade that was probably intended to parry the net and trident or to snag and pull away the net. "Scissores" who succeeded in this probably dropped the hook weapon and fought with just a sword.

The "retiarius" held the dagger in his left hand. The gladiator could use the dagger to cut his net free if it got snagged on his trident. He might fight with the trident in one hand and the dagger in the other, but this negated the advantage of distance afforded by the longer weapon when wielded by itself. The dagger also served as a backup should the "retiarius" lose both net and trident. He attacked with the dagger when he had the element of surprise and could attempt to wrestle the "secutor" to the ground. Fights could devolve into straight wrestling matches in such situations, perhaps with daggers. Should the "retiarius" win and be ordered to kill his rival, he used his knife to stab him or cut his throat. Evidence shows that "retiarii" could be quite successful combatants; a tombstone from Gaul reads, "[For] the "retiarius", L. Pompeius, winner of nine crowns, born in Vienna, twenty-five years of age. His wife put this up with her own money for her wonderful spouse." Nevertheless, the gladiators themselves were prone to boast: A graffito at Pompeii shows the "retiarius" Antigonus, who claims a ridiculous 2,112 victories, facing a challenger called Superbus, who has won but a single fight.

In some contests, a "retiarius" faced two "secutores" at the same time. He stood on a bridge or raised platform with stairs and had a pile of fist-sized stones to lob at his adversaries and keep them at bay. The "secutores" tried to scale the structure and get at him. The platform (called a "pons", "bridge") may have been constructed over water. Such scenarios were one of the rare situations where gladiators were not paired one on one.

Arthur Mold

Arthur Webb Mold (27 May 1863 – 29 April 1921) was an English professional <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er who played <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> for <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> as a <a href="Fast%20bowling">fast bowler</a> between 1889 and 1901. A <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">"Wisden" Cricketer of the Year</a> in 1892, he was selected for <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> in three <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> in 1893. Mold was one of the most effective bowlers in England during the 1890s but his career was overshadowed by controversy over his <a href="bowling%20action">bowling action</a>. Although he took 1,673 <a href="Wicket%23Dismissing%20a%20batsman">wickets</a> in first-class matches, many commentators viewed his achievements as tainted.

Mold began his professional cricket career playing for <a href="Banbury">Banbury</a> and <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a> in the mid-1880s, but by 1889 had qualified to play for Lancashire at county level. Immediately successful, he quickly established a good bowling partnership with <a href="Johnny%20Briggs%20%28cricketer%29">Johnny Briggs</a> and became one of the leading bowlers in the country. However, he only achieved selection for England in one series in 1893. Many critics thought he <a href="Throwing%20%28cricket%29">threw</a> rather than bowled the ball, and he was among several bowlers at the time about whom there were similar suspicions. Controversy erupted in 1900 when Mold was <a href="no-ball">no-ball</a>ed for throwing by <a href="Jim%20Phillips%20%28cricketer%29">Jim Phillips</a>, an umpire who had targeted several prominent bowlers with dubious bowling actions. After Mold avoided several games in which Phillips was umpire, the affair came to a head in 1901. On the opening morning of a match, Phillips repeatedly no-balled Mold. Several of Mold's teammates and most Lancashire supporters continued to believe that Mold bowled legally, but his reputation was ruined and, after three more appearances in 1901, he retired at the end of the season. After his departure from the game, throwing ceased to be a concern in English cricket for 50 years.

Mold was born on 27 May 1863 in the village of <a href="Middleton%20Cheney">Middleton Cheney</a> in Northamptonshire. His family had links with the <a href="thatching">thatching</a> trade, but Mold pursued a career in professional cricket. He began to play for the village team, making good progress as a bowler; in 1882, Middleton Cheney were unbeaten and Mold had the best <a href="bowling%20average">bowling average</a> in the team. In 1885 and 1886, he was employed as a professional at <a href="Banbury">Banbury</a> Cricket Club. In his second year, a successful match against the <a href="Free%20Foresters%20Cricket%20Club">Free Foresters</a>, an amateur team, impressed two <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> cricketers who played against him. Subsequently, in 1887, Mold was employed by <a href="Manchester%20Cricket%20Club">Manchester Cricket Club</a>, and played a few non-competitive cricket matches for Lancashire. In the same season, <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a>, which at the time had not been awarded <a href="First-class%20cricket">first-class status</a>, asked Mold to play for them. Playing as a professional, Mold was immediately successful, taking ten <a href="Wicket%23dismissal">wickets</a> in a match against a team from <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> and seven wickets for 22 <a href="Run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> (seven for 22) in an innings against <a href="Staffordshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Staffordshire</a>. He continued to represent Northamptonshire in the following season but hoped to play for Lancashire. At the time, cricketers who wished to play competitive first-class matches for a county in which they were not born had to live there for two years to qualify.

By 1889, Mold was qualified for Lancashire and was expected by critics to make an impact. At the time, Lancashire had no <a href="Fast%20bowling">fast bowler</a> in their team, making Mold potentially an important player. He made his first-class debut for the county in a three-day match against <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) starting on 9 May 1889, taking one wicket in a drawn game. Throughout the rest of the season, Mold impressed critics. After a slow start in unhelpful conditions and unsuitable playing surfaces for his type of bowling, he took a total of 33 wickets in four consecutive games and established a reputation as the fastest bowler in England. His best performance statistically was seven for 35 against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire County Cricket Club</a>, in a match during which he took 13 wickets, but he was successful in other high-profile matches. In all games against county opposition, Mold took 80 wickets at an average of 11.69; in all first-class matches he took 102 wickets at an average of 11.81. This placed him third in the national bowling averages. Although less successful in 1890, he took 118 wickets in first-class games at 14.72, which was 11th in the averages. His best figures, nine for 41, once more came against Yorkshire, and he helped Lancashire to second place in the first official <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a>. Mold came close to playing for England when he was included in the squad to play in the third <a href="Test%20cricket">Test match</a> against Australia, but the match was abandoned owing to rain and no play took place.

Mold established himself as one of the leading bowlers in England during 1891. According to "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>", "The season of 1891 brought him a great increase of reputation, and all through the summer he was uniformly successful." In all first-class matches, he took 138 wickets at 12.49 to finish second in the national bowling averages. As a result of his good performances in the season, he was chosen as one of the "Wisden" <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a>. Lancashire finished as runners-up once again in the County Championship.

In 1892, Mold's aggregate of wickets fell to 120 at an average of 13.63, but he returned the best bowling figures of his career when he took nine for 29 against <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a>. He was chosen in a representative match for the first time, playing for the <a href="North%20v%20South">North against the South</a>. During the 1893 season, Mold took 166 wickets at 16.96; at the end of the season, "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" described him as a great bowler and noted that he and <a href="Johnny%20Briggs%20%28cricketer%29">Johnny Briggs</a> were Lancashire's only two effective bowlers. Between them, the pair took 225 wickets; the other bowlers in combination took 46. Once more representing the North during 1893, this time in a match against the touring Australian team, Mold also made his debut in the prestigious <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">Gentlemen v Players</a> match, playing for the professional "Players" and taking nine wickets in the game. His performances brought about his international debut; he played for England in all three Test matches against Australia, the only such appearances of his career. In the first game, he took three for 44 in Australia's only innings, his best figures of the series, and took four wickets in the other two matches to finish with seven wickets at an average of 33.42. It is likely that doubts about the legality of his <a href="bowling%20action">bowling action</a> prevented him from playing further Test matches, or touring Australia with a representative side. However, other factors may have played a part in his subsequent omission, including the emergence of <a href="Tom%20Richardson%20%28cricketer%29">Tom Richardson</a> as a successful fast bowler, and the opinion that Mold's bowling was flattered by the difficult, uneven <a href="Cricket%20pitch">pitches</a> on which Lancashire played their home games.

Mold's annual total of wickets continued to increase in the following seasons. In 1894, he again represented the North and the Players, taking 207 wickets in total at an average of 12.30. But as Lancashire increased the number of games they played, Mold and Briggs had an increased bowling workload and once more had little assistance from other bowlers. Between them, they took 324 wickets while the next most successful bowler took 13. The following year, Mold reached his highest seasonal tally with 213 wickets at 15.96, and made his final appearance for the Players. "The Times" commented on the effectiveness of Mold: "Mold preserves all his pace and break in bowling, and his success on the hard wickets was phenomenal."

Although Mold appeared for the North against the Australians, who toured again in 1896, he did not play any Tests or other representative cricket that year and his wicket total fell to 150 at 18.12; after this season, his bowling began to decline in effectiveness. Suffering frequently from injury in 1897, Mold failed to reach 100 wickets in the season for the first time. His 90 wickets in 1898 were taken at an average over 20, the only time his bowling average was so high, and he missed three weeks of the season owing to injury. After improving his record to 115 wickets at 18.68 during 1899, he was awarded a <a href="Benefit%20%28sports%29">benefit match</a> by Lancashire during 1900 which raised £2,050, a record total at the time and worth around £173,000 in 2010.

For many years in England, there had been controversy over <a href="bowling%20action">bowling action</a>s; several bowlers were believed to <a href="Throwing%20%28cricket%29">throw</a> rather than bowl the ball, which was contrary to the <a href="Laws%20of%20Cricket">Laws of Cricket</a>. Lancashire had a particularly poor reputation among other county teams for using bowlers who threw: by the early 1880s, up to four of Lancashire's main bowlers were judged to be unfair, including <a href="John%20Crossland">John Crossland</a> who bowled very quickly. By the mid-1880s, several teams refused to play Lancashire on account of their bowling attack. Mainly through the actions of <a href="George%20Harris%2C%204th%20Baron%20Harris">Lord Harris</a>, many of the suspect bowlers were forced out of cricket, and bowling actions became more legitimate. However, some players continued to bowl with questionable actions, including members of the Lancashire team. The issue intensified in 1896 when two of the Australian touring team, <a href="Ernie%20Jones%20%28Australian%20sportsman%29">Ernie Jones</a> and <a href="Tom%20McKibbin">Tom McKibbin</a>, seemed to throw the ball regularly; <a href="Sydney%20Pardon">Sydney Pardon</a>, the editor of "Wisden", wrote: "The mortifying fact was that the illegal bowling was due entirely to our own weakness in not having the laws of the game carried out. The Australians only did against us what we had over and over again done against them."

Following the 1896 tour, the English authorities realised action had to be taken. <a href="Jim%20Phillips%20%28cricketer%29">Jim Phillips</a>, an Australian-born umpire who journeyed each year between his native country and England, travelled to Australia with an <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201897%E2%80%9398">English touring team</a> in 1897–98. During two of the matches he umpired, Phillips <a href="no-ball">no-ball</a>ed Ernie Jones for throwing. Upon returning to England for the 1898 season, Phillips also called <a href="C.%20B.%20Fry">C. B. Fry</a>, a prominent amateur cricketer and all-round sportsman, for throwing. This was the second of three occasions in 1898 that Fry was no-balled. Other umpires, following Phillips' lead, no-balled Fry and <a href="Frank%20Hopkins%20%28cricketer%29">Frank Hopkins</a>. Two further bowlers, albeit not famous cricketers, were called for throwing in 1899.

During the 1900 season, Fry was once more no-balled at the beginning of June, this time by <a href="William%20West%20%28umpire%29">William West</a>. The concerted action against throwing reached a peak when Phillips umpired the match between <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a> and Lancashire in Nottingham on 26 June. Early on the first morning of the three-day match, Mold came on to bowl when Nottinghamshire had scored 34. In Mold's first <a href="Over%20%28cricket%29">over</a>, Phillips twice no-balled him for throwing. Lancashire's captain, <a href="Archie%20MacLaren">Archie MacLaren</a>, withdrew Mold from the bowling attack at the end of the over and he did not bowl again in the match. However, MacLaren later defended Mold in the press. The match reports in both "The Times" and "Wisden" commented that Mold had been lucky never to be no-balled before in his career; he was the most high-profile bowler to be called in the Phillips-led crackdown on bowling actions. Mold played another nine times in 1900 without being called for throwing, but he did not play in any of the Lancashire matches umpired by Phillips. Later in the season, Phillips called the <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a> bowler <a href="Ted%20Tyler">Ted Tyler</a>. By the end of the season, Mold had taken 97 wickets at 14.01.
That December, at their annual meeting at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>, the captains of the first-class counties discussed the problem of throwing. MacLaren asked those present at the meeting to give their opinion of Mold's bowling. According to MacLaren, they "replied to a man that they considered that Mold was not always fair". Reports in the press stated that they voted by a majority of eleven to one that Mold's action was unfair, and that along with other bowlers whose actions were suspected, he should not bowl in the coming season. The captains further recommended that bowlers with illegal actions should be banned, suspended or warned depending on the severity of their transgression. The meeting proved controversial, and disputes arose over how many captains had supported the decision. MacLaren claimed that he was the only captain to support Mold. Despite the verdict of the meeting, Lancashire's committee remained of the opinion that Mold bowled legally; the Lancashire president <a href="A.%20N.%20Hornby">A. N. Hornby</a> and several of Mold's teammates also publicly backed the bowler. Opinions among other players and in the press varied as to the fairness of Mold's bowling, but sympathy was expressed for the damage to Mold's career and reputation, while <a href="Pelham%20Warner">Pelham Warner</a> suggested that it was unfair to ban Mold completely. Some critics believed that the captains should not have passed judgement at all. The MCC, responsible for the laws of cricket and the organisation of the English game, were asked to adjudicate by several county committees. Reluctant to let the decision stand, the MCC overruled the captains, preferring to leave the matter to individual umpires. However, the umpires were instructed to pay close attention to suspect bowlers during the coming season.
Although he may have been expected to retire following the controversy and in view of his age, Mold continued to play for Lancashire, who were short of quality bowlers, at the start of the 1901 season. At least one umpire was asked by the MCC to report specifically on Mold's bowling, but decided it was fair, and no umpire initially called him for throwing. He missed two Lancashire matches in which Phillips was an umpire, wishing to avoid a confrontation, but Lancashire were criticised by the public for omitting Mold from these matches. Consequently, he played in the game against Somerset umpired by Phillips, which started on 11 July at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford Cricket Ground</a>. Under the captaincy of MacLaren, Mold opened the attack and bowled with Phillips at <a href="Umpire%20%28cricket%29%23Positions">square leg</a>. In Mold's second over of the game, Phillips no-balled him for throwing. Acting at the request of the Lancashire committee, MacLaren then switched Mold to bowl from the opposite end so that Phillips would be at the bowler's end. Even so, Phillips continued to no-ball him, and after 10 overs, Mold had been called 16 times by Phillips. MacLaren removed Mold from the attack, although he returned to bowl later without further action from either umpire. For the remainder of the match, Mold bowled from Phillips' end without censure; Phillips believed he had made his point. The other umpire took no action at any point in the match. The crowd at the game protested noisily against Phillips, for a time shouting "no-ball" as every ball was bowled, and making comments about him. According to "Wisden", Phillips' actions caused "a great sensation ... The incident naturally gave rise to much excitement, and for the next few days nothing else was talked about in the cricket world." At the conclusion of the match, <a href="Mitchell%20and%20Kenyon">Mitchell and Kenyon</a>, a film-making company based in Blackburn, filmed the players leaving the field and took footage of Mold bowling in the <a href="Cricket%20nets">nets</a> to Hornby. Phillips received criticism for his actions and Mold had some support in the press. Mold's "Times" obituary noted: "Mold did not lack defenders, but those who argued that he was, and always had been, a perfectly fair bowler, had a very bad case. The weight of expert evidence was overwhelmingly against them."

In December 1901, the MCC approved the scheme previously suggested—that the county captains should meet to discuss the fairness of suspected bowlers. It was proposed that any bowler who was judged to be unfair by a two-to-one majority of captains would be banned for at least a season. The MCC also recommended that the counties not play suspected bowlers and that any bowler called for throwing should be removed from the attack in the interests of the spirit of cricket. In the 1902 "Wisden", Sydney Pardon wrote: "Never in the last twenty years or more has there been so little unfair or doubtful bowling as in the season of 1901. Indeed the improvement was so marked as to make it clear that, if the captains stick to their guns, we shall soon be entirely free from the evil of which not very long ago it seemed impossible to get rid." After 1901, there were only isolated incidents regarding illegal bowling actions until the Second World War, and throwing ceased to be an issue in English cricket, in which no cricketer was no-balled for throwing between 1908 and 1952.

Mold played another three matches in 1901 without being no-balled for throwing, but his reputation was ruined and he retired at the end of the season, although Lancashire had offered him a new contract. In this final season, he took 59 wickets at 19.35. In his career as a whole, he took 1,673 first-class wickets at an average of 15.54. In 2012, he is 57th on the list of leading first-class wicket-takers; among those whose careers were contemporaneous with or preceded Mold's, he is placed 19th.

Subsequently, Mold returned to play for Northamptonshire in 1903, and played league cricket in his native county, although he struggled with increasing weight in his later years. In his retirement, he became the landlord of a public house in Middleton Cheney, the village in which he was born. He took up shooting as a hobby and looked after his ailing mother. After a long illness, he died on 29 April 1921 in Middleton Cheney. The memorial on his gravestone states: "This stone was erected by his old cricketing friends as a token of their affection, admiration and respect". It was paid for by a subscription opened by the Lancashire Committee.

A <a href="Fast%20bowling">fast bowler</a> who operated from a very short <a href="Run-up%20%28cricket%29">run-up</a>, Mold bowled extremely quickly, releasing the ball with his arm very high in his early years, although later in his career, his arm was lower in delivery. Unusually for a bowler of his pace, he could make the ball deviate from straight, either through <a href="Seam%20bowling">seam movement</a> or <a href="Leg%20cutter">cutting his fingers over it before release</a>, but most of his wickets were taken through sheer speed. His obituary in the <a href="The%20Guardian">"Manchester Guardian"</a> stated that he was among the fastest bowlers of all time and his bowling action was "beautiful" and possessed "fine grace". If the pitch was uneven or otherwise difficult for batting, he was extremely difficult to bat against: in 1892, "Wisden" noted: "On anything like a rough or bumpy wicket [pitch] he is, beyond all question, the most difficult and dangerous bowler of the day, the ball getting up from the pitch so high and so fast as to intimidate all but the very pluckiest of batsmen." "The Times" later noted that he was very successful for Lancashire and a difficult bowler to face. In combination with Briggs, he bowled a very high proportion of Lancashire's overs. At times, he struggled with a knee injury but continued to bowl with little opportunity to rest.

Opinion was divided over the legality of Mold's bowling action. After no-balling Mold for the second time, Phillips wrote that he had long suspected Mold of throwing. Even though he believed Mold was trying to bowl with a straight arm in the Somerset match, Phillips considered many more deliveries to be throws than merely those he called. In his own defence, Mold queried why Phillips never acted on his prior suspicions, and suggested that the umpire did not make it clear which part of Mold's bowling action was unfair. The "Manchester Guardian", reporting on the Somerset match in 1901, noted that many umpires had apparently viewed Mold's action as fair earlier in the season, even after the instruction from the MCC to pay careful attention to him. It stated that "the general opinion was that if one ball was to be called a throw then every ball he sent down was of the same order." However, some critics noted that when bowling an occasional faster ball, Mold's action changed slightly; this was the delivery to which Phillips objected. His obituary in the "Manchester Guardian" stated that the lack of action by umpires other than Phillips in 1901, and throughout Mold's career, meant that the "charge against Mold, then, can hardly be said to have been 'proven.

Mold continued to have his supporters. MacLaren later wrote that he believed Mold never intentionally threw; A. N. Hornby consistently defended Mold, partly because, as Mold's captain during the 1890s, it would have been a slur against his sportsmanship to admit that an unfair bowler had been in his team. Most Lancashire supporters never doubted that Mold's action was fair. Cricket historian Don Ambrose suggests that Mold probably did throw his faster delivery, which may have accounted for the high proportion of his wickets which were <a href="bowled">bowled</a>. It also explained his ability to produce a delivery that surprised the batsman; <a href="W.%20G.%20Grace">W. G. Grace</a> once observed that it was particularly painful to be struck by a delivery from Mold. The lack of action by Phillips' fellow umpires was possibly, according to Ambrose, due to their unwillingness to cause problems for a fellow professional cricketer. However, Ambrose also suggests that in the Somerset match, Phillips was determined to end Mold's career and that not every delivery that he called was actually a throw.

Mold was popular with other cricketers. "The Times" said: "Apart from the burning question of throwing, not a word could be said against him. He was liked by all his brother professionals, and popular wherever he played." However, his achievements were always qualified by suspicion over the legality of his bowling action, even before he was no-balled by Phillips. A batsman who played against him when he first appeared for Northamptonshire said: "If he is fair he is the best bowler in England, but I think he is a worse thrower than ever Crossland [the Lancashire bowler of the 1880s with a suspect bowling action] was." Mold's "Times" obituary stated: "He was a deadly fast bowler, but, all through his career, even his best feats in the cricket field were spoken of with something of apology".

Moorgate tube crash

The Moorgate tube crash occurred on 28 February 1975 at 8:46 am on the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>'s <a href="Northern%20City%20Line">Northern City Line</a>; 43 people died and 74 were injured after a train failed to stop at the line's southern terminus, <a href="Moorgate%20station">Moorgate station</a>, and crashed into its end wall. It is considered the worst peacetime accident on the London Underground. No fault was found with the train, and the inquiry by the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Environment">Department of the Environment</a> concluded that the accident was caused by the actions of Leslie Newson, the 56-year-old driver.

The crash forced the first carriage into the roof of the tunnel at the front and back, but the middle remained on the trackbed; the coach was crushed to . The second carriage was concertinaed at the front as it collided with the first, and the third <a href="telescoping%20%28rail%20cars%29">rode over</a> the rear of the second. The brakes were not applied and the <a href="dead%20man%27s%20handle">dead man's handle</a> was still depressed when the train crashed. The <a href="London%20Fire%20Brigade">London Fire Brigade</a>, <a href="London%20Ambulance%20Service">Ambulance Service</a> and <a href="City%20of%20London%20Police">City of London Police</a> attended the scene. It took 13 hours to remove the injured from the wreckage, many of whom had to be cut free. With no services running into the adjoining platform to create the <a href="piston%20effect">piston effect</a> pushing air into the station, ventilation was poor and temperatures in the tunnel rose to over . It took a further four days to extract the last body, that of Newson; his cab, normally deep, had been crushed to .

The <a href="post-mortem">post-mortem</a> on Newson showed no medical reason to explain the crash. A cause has never been established, and theories include suicide, that he may have been distracted, or that he was affected by conditions such as <a href="transient%20global%20amnesia">transient global amnesia</a> or <a href="akinetic%20mutism">akinesis with mutism</a>. Tests showed that Newson had a <a href="blood%20alcohol%20level">blood alcohol level</a> of 80 mg/100 ml—the level at which one can be prosecuted for <a href="drink-driving">drink-driving</a>, though the alcohol may have been produced by the natural <a href="decomposition">decomposition</a> process over four days at a high temperature.

In the aftermath of the crash, London Underground introduced a safety system that automatically stops a train when travelling too fast. This became known informally as <a href="%23Moorgate%20protection">Moorgate protection</a>. Northern City Line services into Moorgate ended in October 1975 and British Rail services started in August 1976. After a long campaign by relatives of the dead, two memorials were unveiled in the vicinity of the station, one in July 2013 and one in February 2014.

<a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>—also known as the Underground or the Tube—is a public <a href="rapid%20transit">rapid transit</a> system serving London and some parts of the adjacent counties of <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>, <a href="Essex">Essex</a> and <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>. The network opened in 1863 and contained of <a href="Network%20length%20%28transport%29%23Route%20length">route track</a> by 1975; that year three million people used the service each day. The Tube was one of the safest methods of transport in Britain in 1975. Apart from <a href="suicide">suicide</a>s, there were only 14 deaths on the Underground between 1938 and 1975, 12 of which occurred in <a href="Stratford%20tube%20crash">the 1953 Stratford crash</a>. <a href="Moorgate%20station">Moorgate station</a>, in the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>, was the terminus at the southern end of the <a href="Northern%20City%20Line">Northern City Line</a>, five stops and from the northern end at <a href="Drayton%20Park%20railway%20station">Drayton Park</a>. Moorgate is an interchange between the Underground network and suburban overground services. The station contains ten platforms; numbers 7 to 10 are <a href="London%20Underground%20infrastructure%23Sub-surface%20network%20and%20deep-level%20tube%20lines">deep level</a>, and numbers 9 and 10 are used for the Northern City Line service.
At the end of platform 9 in 1975 was a red warning light atop a post, situated in front of a <a href="sand%20drag">sand drag</a> placed to stop over-running trains. The drag was long, of which was on the tracks in front of the platform, and was inside an overrun tunnel that was long, high and wide. The tunnel had been designed to accommodate larger <a href="Main%20line%20%28railway%29">main line</a> rolling stock and so was wider than the standard tube tunnel width of . A <a href="buffer%20stop">buffer</a>, which had once been hydraulic, but had not been functioning as such for some time prior to the crash, was at the end of the tunnel, in front of a solid wall. The approach to Moorgate from <a href="Old%20Street%20station">Old Street station</a>, the stop prior to the terminus, was on a falling gradient of 1 in 150 for before levelling out for to platform 9; a <a href="scissors%20crossover">scissors crossover</a> was located just prior to platforms 9 and 10. There was a <a href="speed%20limit">speed limit</a> of on the line, and a limit of on entry into Moorgate station.

From November 1966 the Northern City Line ran <a href="London%20Underground%201938%20Stock">1938 rolling stock</a>. Weekly checks were made on the stock's brakes, doors and compressors; all equipment on the train was examined on a six-week basis and the cars were lifted from their <a href="bogie">bogie</a>s for a thorough examination once a year.

On 28 February 1975 the first shift of the Northern City Line service was driven by Leslie Newson, 56, who had worked on London Transport since 1969, and been driving on the Northern City Line for the previous three months. Newson was known by his colleagues as a careful and conscientious motorman (driver). On 28 February he carried a bottle of milk, sugar, his rule book, and a notebook in his work satchel; he also had £270 in his jacket to buy a second-hand car for his daughter after work. According to staff on duty his behaviour appeared normal. Before his shift began he had a cup of tea and shared his sugar with a colleague; he jokingly said to the colleague "Go easy on it, I shall want another cup when I come off duty".

The first return trips of the day between Drayton Park and Moorgate, which started at 6:40 am, passed without incident. Robert Harris, the 18-year-old guard who had started working for London Underground in August 1974, was late and joined the train when it returned to Moorgate at 6:53 am; a driver waiting to go on duty took his place until his arrival. Newson and Harris made three further return trips before the train undertook its final journey from Drayton Park at 8:38 am, thirty seconds late. The train carried approximately 300 passengers; it was a Friday and, as it was the peak of rush hour, most of the travellers were commuters. As the exit from platform 9 was next to the overrun tunnel, the first two carriages were more popular with commuters and more full than the remaining four. Although pupils from the nearby <a href="City%20of%20London%20School%20for%20Girls">City of London School for Girls</a> would normally be on the service at that time, the pupils had a day's holiday as the school was in use for external examinations. The journalist Sally Holloway, in her history of the crash, observes that the number of casualties could have been higher if the girls had been attending school.

After the train departed Old Street on its 56-second journey to Moorgate, Harris was bored and left his position at the guard's control panel—which contained the controls for the emergency brake—at the front of the rear carriage and walked to the back of the train to look for a newspaper. He did not find one and spent his time reading the advertisements on the walls at the rear of the carriage.

On arrival at Moorgate at 8:46 am, the train, which comprised two units of three connected cars, did not slow. It was still under power and no brakes were applied; it passed through the station at . The <a href="Signalman%20%28rail%29">signalman</a> on duty later reported that the train appeared to be accelerating as it passed along the platform. A passenger waiting to take the return journey stated that Newson appeared "to be staring straight ahead and to be somewhat larger than life". Tests were later done on trains entering platform 9 at slow speed. These showed that because of the station lighting, it was impossible to clearly see the driver's eyes. Witnesses standing on the platform saw Newson sitting upright and facing forward, his uniform neat and still wearing his hat; his hands appeared to be on the train's controls as far as they could tell.
The brakes were not applied and the <a href="dead%20man%27s%20handle">dead man's handle</a> was still depressed when the train entered the overrun tunnel, throwing up sand from the drag; when the driver's cab made impact with the hydraulic buffer, the carriage was separated from its bogie and the coachwork was forced into the end wall and the roof. The first 15 seats of the carriage were crushed into . The second coach was forced under the rear of the first, which buckled at three points into the shape of a V with a tail, and had its rear forced into the tunnel roof. With the weight of the train piling up behind it, the front coach was crushed to . The third car was damaged at both ends, more significantly at the leading end as it <a href="telescoping%20%28rail%20cars%29">rode over</a> the second. Javier Gonzalez, a passenger who was travelling in the front carriage described the moment the train crashed:
Just above my newspaper I saw a lady sitting opposite me and then the lights went out. I have the image of her face to this day. She died.
As darkness came, there was a very loud noise of the crash, metal and glass breaking, no screams, all in the fraction of the second, one takes to breathe in. It was all over in no time.

Forty-two passengers and the driver died; seventy-four people were treated in hospital for their injuries. It was, and remains, the worst peacetime accident on the Underground.

The first call to the emergency services was received at 8:48 am; the <a href="London%20Ambulance%20Service">London Ambulance Service</a> arrived at 8:54 am and the <a href="London%20Fire%20Brigade">London Fire Brigade</a> at 8:57 am. At around the same time the <a href="City%20of%20London%20Police">City of London Police</a> alerted nearby <a href="St%20Bartholomew%27s%20Hospital">St Bartholomew's Hospital</a> (Barts) that "a tube train had hit the buffers", but there was no indication at that stage of the seriousness of the crash. A small assessment team comprising a casualty officer and a medical student was sent from the hospital; 15 minutes later a <a href="resuscitation">resuscitation</a> unit was sent, although the hospital staff were still unaware of the scale of the problem. The City of London Police also contacted the medical unit of <a href="BP">BP</a> at Britannic House, <a href="Finsbury%20Circus">Finsbury Circus</a>. Dr Donald Dean and a team of two doctors and two nurses walked around to the station to assist, and were the first medical assistance at the scene. After assessing the situation, Dean realised that he did not have enough painkillers with him, or in BP stores, so he went to the Moorgate branch of <a href="Boots%20UK">Boots</a> where the pharmacist gave him the shop's entire supply of <a href="morphine">morphine</a> and <a href="pethidine">pethidine</a>. The Fire Brigade undertook a brief inspection of the site and, once they saw what they were dealing with, the status was updated to a Major Accident event; additional ambulances and fire tenders were soon sent. One of the doctors from Barts later described the scene:

The front carriage was an indescribable tangle of twisted metal and in it the living and the dead were heaped together, intertwined among themselves and the wreckage.
It was impossible to estimate the number [of casualties] involved with any degree of accuracy because the lighting was poor, the victims were all tangled together, and everything was covered with a thick layer of black dust. Many of the victims were writhing in agony and were screaming for individual attention. It was obvious from an early stage that the main problem was the disentanglement of a heap of people, many of whom appeared to be in imminent danger of suffocation.

By around 9:00 am the last casualty had been removed from the third carriage. By 9:30 am <a href="Moorgate">Moorgate</a> and many of the surrounding roads had been cordoned off to allow space for the co-ordination teams above ground to manage the flow of vehicles—particularly for ambulances taking casualties to hospitals. A message was sent from the London Fire Brigade headquarters to all fire stations in London; it estimated that there were still 50 people trapped and warned that "this incident will be protracted". To make a clear passage through the wreckage for equipment, the emergency services and injured commuters, a circular route was organised through the carriages. Firemen cut holes in parts of the structure, including in the floors and ceilings of the carriages through which it was possible to move, even if it meant crawling through some areas. At 10:00 am a medical team arrived from <a href="Royal%20London%20Hospital">The London Hospital</a> and set up a makeshift operating theatre on a platform near the <a href="triage">triage</a> team.

Platform 9 was underground, and fire and ambulance crews had to carry all the equipment they needed through the station and down to the scene of the accident. The depth at which they were operating, and the shielding effect of the soil and concrete, meant their radios could not get through to the surface. Messages and requests for further supplies were passed by runners, which led to mistakes: one doctor requested further supplies of the pain-killing gas <a href="Entonox">Entonox</a>, but by the time the request reached the surface, it had been garbled to "the doctor wants an empty box". The fire brigade deployed a small team with "Figaro", an experimental radio system that worked in deep locations. Working conditions for the emergency services became increasingly difficult throughout the day. The crash had thrown soot and dirt into the air from the sand drag, and from between the two metal layers of the tube carriages. Everything was covered with a thick layer of the residue which was easily disturbed. The lamps and cutting gear used by the fire brigade raised the temperature to over and oxygen levels began to drop. In the deep lines at Moorgate, ventilation is created by the <a href="piston%20effect">piston effect</a> created by trains forcing air through the tube lines. With services stopped since the crash, no fresh air was reaching platforms 9 and 10. A large electric fan was placed at the top of the escalators in an attempt to remedy the situation, but soot and dirt was disturbed and little draught was created; the machine was soon turned off.

By 12:00 noon only five live casualties were left to be extracted; by 3:15 pm only two were left: Margaret Liles, a 19-year-old <a href="Police%20ranks%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23History%20of%20police%20ranks">Woman Police Constable</a> (WPC), and Jeff Benton, who worked at the <a href="London%20Stock%20Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a>. They were in the front part of the first carriage at the time of the crash and ended up trapped together, pinned down under the girders of the carriage's structure. The Fire Brigade worked for several hours to release Benton, but it became apparent that Liles needed to be removed first, which could only be done by <a href="Amputation">amputating</a> her left foot. She was finally removed from the wreckage after the procedure at 8.55 pm; Benton was removed at 10:00 pm. As soon as Benton had been removed, all equipment was turned off and silence was ordered among the emergency services. Shouts were made to listen for any people trapped to respond; there were none and the site medical officer declared that all the remaining bodies in the wreckage were dead. During the day <a href="mouth-to-mouth%20resuscitation">mouth-to-mouth resuscitation</a> had been needed to save two people, and two victims died of <a href="crush%20syndrome">crush syndrome</a> soon after being released from the wreckage. Benton also died of crush syndrome, in hospital on 27 March 1975, despite initially good progress.

Work on removing the bodies and clearing the wreckage from the tunnel began after the last casualty had been removed. With no casualties remaining, the Fire Brigade were able to use <a href="flame%20cutting">flame cutting</a> equipment. After the third carriage was cut free from the second, at 1:00 am on 1 March the third carriage began to be winched back down the track; as it began moving a body that no-one had seen fell from the wreckage and onto the track. According to <a href="Joseph%20Milner%20%28firefighter%29">Joseph Milner</a>, the <a href="Chief%20fire%20officer">Chief fire officer</a> of the London Fire Brigade, the body gave "the first indication of how protracted would be the work ahead". Once the carriage had been removed, a doctor again checked for further signs of living casualties; none were found.
The use of the flame cutting equipment had a detrimental effect on the atmosphere on the platform. Oxygen levels dropped from the norm of 21 per cent to 16 per cent and the smell of decomposition from the bodies trapped in the wreckage was noticed by workers. Those working on the platform or tunnel were restricted to 20-minute spells working, followed by 40 minutes' recovery time on the surface. All workers had to wear gloves and masks; any cuts had to be reported, and no-one with a cut was allowed to be involved in the extrication of a body. Temperatures improved after a company donated an <a href="air%20conditioning">air conditioning</a> unit, which was installed at ground level, and the air piped down into the tunnel.

During 1 and 2 March the wreckage of the second carriage was cut away in sections and winched free; clearance of the carriages continued round the clock until a break was forced by a telephoned <a href="bomb%20scare">bomb scare</a> at 10:00 pm on 2 March, which forced the crews to evacuate the station. The last passenger was removed from the front carriage at 3:20 pm on 4 March, which left only the driver's body. Gordon Hafter, London Underground's chief engineer, and Lieutenant Colonel Ian McNaughton, the Chief Inspecting Officer of Railways, examined the driver's cab; normally deep, it had been crushed to . They ascertained that Newson was at his controls, although his head had been forced through the front window. Hafter reported his examination about Newson to the subsequent inquiry:

His left hand was close to, but not actually on the driver's brake handle and his right arm was hanging down to the right of the main controller. His head was to the left of the dead man's handle which had been forced upwards, beyond its normal travel, and was resting on his right shoulder.

Newson's body was removed at 8:05 pm on 4 March; the Fire Brigade cleared the remainder of the wreckage by 5:00 am on 5 March and handed control of the platform back to London Underground. The rescue and clean-up operation involved the efforts of 1,324 firemen, 240 policemen, 80 ambulance men, 16 doctors and several nurses.

Services on the line had been suspended on the day of the crash. A shuttle service between Drayton Park and Old Street was used from 1 March 1975 until normal traffic returned on 10 March.

The <a href="post-mortem">post-mortem</a> was undertaken on Newson by the <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> <a href="pathologist">pathologist</a> <a href="Keith%20Simpson%20%28pathologist%29">Keith Simpson</a> on 4 March 1975. He found no physical conditions, such as a <a href="stroke">stroke</a> or <a href="heart%20attack">heart attack</a>, that would have explained the crash. Initial findings showed no drugs or alcohol in Newson's bloodstream, and there was no evidence of liver damage from heavy drinking.

On 7 March 1975 <a href="Anthony%20Crosland">Anthony Crosland</a>, the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Environment">Secretary of State for the Environment</a>, instructed McNaughton to undertake an investigation of the crash. McNaughton's inquiry began on 13 March and was paused after a day and a half; during that time it was established that the mechanics of the train were in working order and that there were no known problems with Newson's health, although the results of pathological tests were still awaited. McNaughton said he was perplexed as to the causes of the crash, but that he would proceed with the next part of his inquiry, which was to undertake further enquiries and to consider measures so the accident could not be repeated.

The <a href="coroner">coroner</a>'s <a href="Inquests%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">inquest</a> was between 14 and 18 April 1975. David Paul, the coroner, was unhappy that a government inquiry had already begun, as evidence was in the public domain, and could affect the <a href="coroner%27s%20jury">inquest's jury</a>. Sixty-one witnesses gave evidence. An analysis of Newson's kidneys by the <a href="toxicologist">toxicologist</a> Dr Anne Robinson showed his <a href="blood%20alcohol%20level">blood alcohol level</a> at the time of the post-mortem was 80 mg/100 ml. Robinson stated that there were several biological processes that produced alcohol in the body after death, and it was not possible to reach a definite conclusion as to whether this was the result of consumption of alcohol or a product of the process of <a href="decomposition">decomposition</a>. She added "there are so many unknown factors here that it is difficult to be precise and definite. One has to make a number of assumptions", although she stated that it was likely that he had been drinking. 80 mg/100 ml was—and, as at 2018, still is—the legal limit in England for driving. It was the highest reading of four samples taken from Newson's body; the lowest was 20 mg/100 ml. Newson's widow stated that her husband drank spirits only rarely; David Paul agreed that it was out of character with all he had heard, and agreed that further tests could be run on Newson's samples. On the final day of the inquiry, Dr Roy Goulding, a specialist in the forensic examination of poisons, stated that while he reached the same results of 80 mg/100 ml, his conclusions differed from Robinson's; Goulding stated that as alcohol was naturally produced in the blood after death, it was not possible to confirm that Newson had been drinking prior to the crash. Several of Newson's colleagues reported that they had no suspicions that Newson had been drinking, and that his behaviour on the morning of the crash was normal. David Paul asked Simpson to comment on the findings relating to alcohol levels. He informed the coroner that "it is generally accepted that as much as 80 mg/100ml may make its appearance in a decomposing body after four days in a [relatively] high temperature". The jury returned verdicts of <a href="accidental%20death">accidental death</a>.

On 19 March a memorial service was held at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>, London, attended by 2,000 mourners, including representatives of the emergency services and Newson's widow and family.

McNaughton published his report almost a year later, on 4 March 1976. He wrote that tests showed no equipment fault on the train, and that the dead man's handle had no defect. From <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s it was clear that at the moment of the crash Newson's hand was on the dead man's handle. There were no electrical burns on his skin or clothing to indicate an electrical fault. McNaughton observed that because of the guard Harris's lack of experience, he could not have taken any action to stop the accident from happening, although he thought the young man "displayed himself as idle and undisciplined". He concluded that "the accident was solely due to a lapse on the part of the driver, Motorman Newson".

Given the inquest findings relating to alcohol in Newson's bloodstream, McNaughton examined the possibility that Newson was drunk. He received expert advice that even if Newson had drunk sufficient alcohol to achieve a blood alcohol level of 80 mg/100 ml, it would not account for the crash. McNaughton also examined the possibility of suicide by Newson, but considered it unlikely, given other indications, including Newson's plans for purchasing a car later in the day and that he had driven the route without error for the preceding 2 hours.

McNaughton investigated the possibility that Newson may have been daydreaming or distracted to the point that he did not realise the train was entering Moorgate. McNaughton concluded that as the train went over the scissor crossing before the platform, it would have brought the driver to his senses. It was also likely that Newson would have realised his circumstances before the train hit the wall, and would have thrown his hands up in front of his face in a reflex action. Medical evidence presented to the inquiry raised the possibility that the driver had been affected by conditions such as <a href="transient%20global%20amnesia">transient global amnesia</a> or <a href="akinetic%20mutism">akinesis with mutism</a>, where the brain continues to function and the individual remains aware, although not being able to move physically. There was no evidence to indicate either condition: to positively diagnose akinesis with mutism would depend on a microscopic examination of the brain, which was not possible because of decomposition, and transient global amnesia leaves no traces. McNaughton's report found that there was insufficient evidence to say if the accident was due to a deliberate act or a medical condition.

I must conclude, therefore, that the cause of this accident lay entirely in the behaviour of Motorman Newson during the final minute before the accident occurred. Whether his behaviour was deliberate or whether it was the result of a suddenly arising physical condition not revealed as a result of post-mortem examination, there is not sufficient evidence to examine, but I am satisfied that no part of the responsibility for the accident rests with any other person and that there was no fault or condition of the train, track or signalling that in any way contributed to it.

London Underground services into Moorgate on the Northern City Line had previously been scheduled to be replaced by British Rail services from Welwyn Garden City and Hertford; the accident did not change the plan. The last London Underground services on the Northern City Line ran into Moorgate on 4 October 1975 and British Rail services started in August 1976, having previously terminated at <a href="Broad%20Street%20railway%20station%20%28England%29">Broad Street station</a>.

When platform 9 reopened there had been changes introduced to aid drivers. The back wall of the tunnel was painted white and a large, heavy-duty buffer preceded the sand drag. Shortly after the crash, London Underground imposed a speed limit of for all trains entering terminal platforms. Operating instructions were changed so that the protecting signal at terminal platforms was held at danger until trains approaching were travelling slowly, or had been brought to a stop, although this caused delays and operating problems.

Since the death of a driver in 1971, when an empty stock train did not stop in tunnel sidings, London Underground had been introducing speed controls at such locations. By the time of the Moorgate crash, 12 of the 19 locations had the equipment installed. In July 1978, approval was given for Moorgate protection, Moorgate Control or Trains Entering Terminal Stations (TETS) to be introduced at all dead-end termini on manually driven lines on the Underground system.

At Moorgate's platform 9 three <a href="Train%20stop%23Types%20of%20train%20stop">timed train stops</a> were installed; the first at the scissors crossing, the second at the start of the platform and the third halfway down the platform. If the train passes any of these at more than the <a href="Emergency%20brake%20%28train%29">emergency brake</a> is applied. Resistors were placed in the traction supply of trains, to prevent a train accelerating when entering the platform, although the value of these resistors had to be changed after installation. Relays switch the resistors out when the train is permitted to leave. The system was operational in all locations by 1984.

In the south-west corner of <a href="Finsbury%20Square">Finsbury Square</a>, north of Moorgate station, a memorial lists those who died. Measuring , it was unveiled in July 2013 after a long campaign by relatives of the victims and supporters. On 28 February 2014 a memorial plaque was unveiled by <a href="Fiona%20Woolf">Fiona Woolf</a>, the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London">Lord Mayor of London</a>, on the side of the station building, in Moor Place.

In 1977 the <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> programme "Red Alert" examined whether an accident like Moorgate could happen again. The writer <a href="Laurence%20Marks%20%28British%20writer%29">Laurence Marks</a>, whose father died in the disaster, presented "Me, My Dad and Moorgate", a <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> documentary broadcast on 4 June 2006; he stated that he believed the crash was due to suicide by Newson. In 2009 the <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> programme "In Living Memory" examined the causes of the crash, and in 2015 "Real Lives Reunited", aired on BBC One, recorded survivors meeting the firemen who cut them from the wreckage.

Martha Layne Collins

Martha Layne Collins (<a href="n%C3%A9e">née</a> Hall; born December 7, 1936) is an American former businesswoman and politician from the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>; she was elected as the state's <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Kentucky">56th governor</a> from 1983 to 1987, the first woman to hold the office and the only one to date. Prior to that, she served as the 48th <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky</a>, under <a href="John%20Y.%20Brown%2C%20Jr.">John Y. Brown, Jr.</a> Her election made her the highest-ranking <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> woman in the U.S. She was considered as a possible running mate for Democratic presidential nominee <a href="Walter%20Mondale">Walter Mondale</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201984">1984 presidential election</a>, but Mondale chose Congresswoman <a href="Geraldine%20Ferraro">Geraldine Ferraro</a> instead.

After graduating from the <a href="University%20of%20Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a>, Collins worked as a school teacher while her husband finished a degree in dentistry. She became interested in politics, and worked on both <a href="Wendell%20Ford">Wendell Ford</a>'s gubernatorial campaign in 1971 and <a href="Walter%20Dee%20Huddleston">Walter "Dee" Huddleston</a>'s <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> campaign in 1972. In 1975, she was chosen secretary of the state's Democratic Party and was elected clerk of the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a>. During her tenure as clerk, a constitutional amendment restructured the state's judicial system, and the Court of Appeals became the <a href="Kentucky%20Supreme%20Court">Kentucky Supreme Court</a>. Collins continued as clerk of the renamed court and worked to educate citizens about the court's new role.

Collins was elected lieutenant governor in 1979, under Governor <a href="John%20Y.%20Brown%2C%20Jr.">John Y. Brown, Jr.</a> Brown was frequently out of the state, leaving Collins as acting governor for more than 500 days of her four-year term. In 1983, she defeated <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="Jim%20Bunning">Jim Bunning</a> to become Kentucky's first woman governor. Her administration had two primary focuses: education and economic development. After failing to secure increased funding for education in the 1984 legislative session, she conducted a statewide public awareness campaign in advance of a special legislative session the following year; the modified program was passed in that session. She successfully used economic incentives to bring a <a href="Toyota">Toyota</a> manufacturing plant to <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Kentucky">Georgetown, Kentucky</a> in 1986. Legal challenges to the incentives – which would have cost the state the plant and its related economic benefits – were eventually dismissed by the Kentucky Supreme Court. The state experienced record economic growth under Collins' leadership.

At the time, Kentucky governors were <a href="Term%20limits%20in%20the%20United%20States">not eligible for reelection</a>. Collins taught at several universities after her four-year term as governor. From 1990 to 1996, she was the president of <a href="Saint%20Catharine%20College">Saint Catharine College</a> near <a href="Springfield%2C%20Kentucky">Springfield, Kentucky</a>. The 1993 conviction of Collins' husband, Dr. Bill Collins, in an influence-peddling scandal, damaged her hopes for a return to political life. Prior to her husband's conviction it had been rumored that she would be a candidate for the U.S. Senate, or would take a position in the administration of President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>. From 1998 to 2012, Collins served as an executive scholar-in-residence at <a href="Georgetown%20College%20%28Kentucky%29">Georgetown College</a>.

Martha Layne Hall was born December 7, 1936, in <a href="Bagdad%2C%20Kentucky">Bagdad, Kentucky</a>, the only child of Everett and Mary (Taylor) Hall. When Martha was in the <a href="sixth%20grade">sixth grade</a>, her family moved to <a href="Shelbyville%2C%20Kentucky">Shelbyville, Kentucky</a>, and opened the Hall-Taylor Funeral Home. Martha was involved in numerous extracurricular activities both in school and at the local <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> church. Her parents were active in local politics, working for the campaigns of several <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> candidates, and Hall frequently joined them, stuffing envelopes and delivering pamphlets door-to-door.

Martha attended Shelbyville High School where she was a good student and a cheerleader. She frequently competed in beauty pageants and won the title of <a href="Shelby%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Shelby County</a> Tobacco Festival Queen in 1954. After high school, Hall enrolled at <a href="Lindenwood%20University">Lindenwood College</a>, then an <a href="Single-sex%20education">all-woman college</a> in <a href="Saint%20Charles%2C%20Missouri">Saint Charles, Missouri</a> (It is now a co-ed university). After one year at Lindenwood, she transferred to the <a href="University%20of%20Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a> in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>. She was active in many clubs, including the <a href="Chi%20Omega">Chi Omega</a> social sorority, the <a href="Baptist%20Student%20Union">Baptist Student Union</a>, and the home economics club, and was also the president of her dormitory and vice president of the house presidents council.

In 1957, Hall met Billy Louis Collins while attending a Baptist camp in Shelby County. He was a student at <a href="Georgetown%20College%20%28Kentucky%29">Georgetown College</a> in <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Kentucky">Georgetown, Kentucky</a>, about 13 miles from Lexington; he and Hall dated while finishing their degrees. Hall earned a Bachelor of Science degree in <a href="Home%20Economics">Home Economics</a> in 1959. Having won the title of <a href="Kentucky%20Derby%20Festival">Kentucky Derby Festival</a> Queen earlier that year, she briefly considered a career in modeling. Instead, she and Collins married shortly after her graduation. While Billy Collins pursued a degree in <a href="dentistry">dentistry</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Louisville">University of Louisville</a>, Martha taught at <a href="Seneca%20High%20School%20MCA">Seneca</a> and <a href="Fairdale%20High%20School">Fairdale</a> high schools, both located in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a>. While living in Louisville, the couple had two children, Steve and Marla.

In 1966, the Collinses moved to <a href="Versailles%2C%20Kentucky">Versailles, Kentucky</a>, where Martha taught at Woodford County Junior High School. The couple became active in several civic organizations, including the <a href="United%20States%20Junior%20Chamber">Jaycees and Jayceettes</a> and the Young Democratic Couples Club. Through the club, they worked on behalf of <a href="Henry%20Ward%20%28Kentucky%20politician%29">Henry Ward</a>'s unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign in 1967.

By 1971, Collins was the president of the Jayceettes; through her work there, she came to the attention of Democratic <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">state senator</a> <a href="Walter%20Dee%20Huddleston">Walter "Dee" Huddleston</a>. Huddleston asked Collins to co-chair <a href="Wendell%20Ford">Wendell Ford</a>'s gubernatorial campaign in the <a href="Kentucky%27s%206th%20congressional%20district">6th District</a>. J.R. Miller, then-chairman of the state Democratic Party, commented that "She organized that district like you wouldn't believe." After Ford's victory, he named Collins as a <a href="Democratic%20National%20Committee">Democratic National Committee</a>woman from Kentucky. She quit her teaching job and went to work full-time at the state Democratic Party headquarters, as secretary of the state Democratic party and as a delegate to the <a href="1972%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1972 Democratic National Convention</a>. The following year, she worked for Huddleston's campaign for the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a>.

In 1975, Collins won the Democratic nomination for Clerk of the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a> in a five-way primary. In the general election, she defeated <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> Joseph E. Lambert by a vote of 382,528 to 233,442. During her term, an amendment to the <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">state constitution</a> changed the name of the Court of Appeals to the <a href="Kentucky%20Supreme%20Court">Kentucky Supreme Court</a>; Collins was the last person to hold the office of Clerk of the Court of Appeals and the first to hold the office of Clerk of the Supreme Court. As Clerk, she compiled and distributed a brochure about the new role of the Supreme Court, and worked with the state department of education to create a teacher's manual for use in the public schools, detailing the changes effected in the court system as a result of the constitutional amendment. The <a href="Woodford%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Woodford County</a> chapter of <a href="Business%20and%20Professional%20Women%27s%20Foundation">Business and Professional Women</a> chose Collins as its 1976 Woman of Achievement, and in 1977, Governor <a href="Julian%20Carroll">Julian Carroll</a> named her Kentucky Executive Director of the <a href="Friendship%20Force%20International">Friendship Force</a>.

In a field that included six major candidates, Collins secured the Democratic nomination for <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">lieutenant governor</a> in the 1979 primary, garnering 23 percent of the vote. She handily defeated Republican <a href="Hal%20Rogers">Hal Rogers</a> in the general election 543,176 to 316,798. As lieutenant governor, she traveled the state, attending ceremonies in place of Democratic Governor <a href="John%20Y.%20Brown%2C%20Jr.">John Y. Brown, Jr.</a>, who disliked such formal events and often chose not to attend. By the end of her term, she declared that she had visited all <a href="List%20of%20counties%20in%20Kentucky">120 counties in Kentucky</a>. Governor Brown was frequently out of the state, leaving Collins as acting governor for more than 500 days of her four-year term.

As lieutenant governor, Collins presided over the state Senate. Members of both major parties praised Collins for her impartiality and knowledge of <a href="parliamentary%20procedure">parliamentary procedure</a> in this role. She was twice called upon to break tie votes in the Senate, once on a bill allowing the state's teachers to engage in <a href="collective%20bargaining">collective bargaining</a> and another on a bill to allow <a href="branch%20banking">branch banking</a> across county lines within the state; in both instances she voted in the negative, killing the bill. During her tenure, she also chaired the <a href="National%20Conference%20of%20Lieutenant%20Governors">National Conference of Lieutenant Governors</a>, becoming the first woman to hold that position. In 1982, she was named to the board of regents of the <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Theological%20Seminary">Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</a> in Louisville.

Nearing the end of her term as lieutenant governor, Collins announced her intent to run for governor in 1983. Her opponents for the Democratic nomination included Louisville mayor <a href="Harvey%20Sloane">Harvey Sloane</a> and Grady Stumbo, the former secretary of the state's Department of Human Resources. Collins had the support of many leaders in the Democratic Party, but just before the primary, Governor Brown endorsed Stumbo, charging that both Sloane and Collins would use their gubernatorial appointment power to dispense party patronage. Although this was a common practice at the time, Brown notably shunned it during his term. With 223,692 votes, Collins edged out Sloane (219,160 votes) and Stumbo (199,795 votes) to secure the nomination. Sloane asked for a recanvass of the ballots, but ultimately decided it would not change the outcome and conceded defeat.
In the general election, Collins faced Republican state senator <a href="Jim%20Bunning">Jim Bunning</a>, who was later elected to the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> for his achievements as a professional <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> . The <a href="National%20Organization%20for%20Women">National Organization for Women</a>, the <a href="National%20Women%27s%20Campaign%20Fund">National Women's Campaign Fund</a>, and the <a href="Women%27s%20Political%20Caucus">Women's Political Caucus</a> all refused to endorse Collins, citing her lukewarm support for the <a href="Equal%20Rights%20Amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</a> and her opposition to <a href="Abortion%20in%20the%20United%20States">abortion</a> except in cases of <a href="rape">rape</a>, <a href="incest">incest</a>, or when the mother's life was in danger. But, Bunning was not personable on the campaign trail and had difficulty finding issues that would draw traditionally Democratic voters to him. His <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> was a political liability among the majority-Protestant voters. Collins won the election by a vote of 561,674 to 454,650, becoming the first, and to date only, woman to be elected governor of Kentucky.

Following her election, Collins donated the surplus $242,000 from her campaign coffers to the state Democratic Party. When Collins' husband was named state treasurer for the party – at an annual salary of $59,900 – the state press charged that the move was a plot to funnel Collins' campaign funds into her personal account. (The previous Democratic state treasurer had received no salary during his tenure.) Following the media criticism, Dr. Collins resigned his post as treasurer. All of the involved individuals insisted that Governor Collins had not been briefed on the details of her husband's appointment. The media's criticism of Collins continued as many of the appointments to her executive cabinet went to what they characterized as inexperienced personnel who had held key positions in her past campaigns. When newly appointed Insurance Commissioner Gilbert McCarty approved a 17% rate increase requested by <a href="Blue%20Cross%20Blue%20Shield%20Association">Blue Cross Blue Shield</a> – a request that his predecessor had denied a few days earlier – Collins quickly countermanded the approval pending a public hearing on the matter.

In her first address to the legislature, Collins asked for an additional $324 million from the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a>, most of it allocated for education. The additional revenue was to be derived from Collins' proposed tax package, which included increasing the income tax on individuals making more than $15,000 annually, extending the <a href="sales%20tax">sales tax</a> to cover services such as auto repair and dry cleaning, and increasing the corporate licensing tax. After opposition to her proposal developed among legislators during the 1984 biennial legislative session, Collins revised the tax package. She retained the corporate licensing tax increase, but replaced the sales tax and income tax modifications with a flat five percent personal income tax and phasing out the deductions for <a href="depreciation">depreciation</a> which corporations could claim on their state taxes.

With the state still recovering from an <a href="Early%201980s%20recession">economic recession</a> and an election year upcoming, legislators refused to raise taxes. Collins eventually withdrew her request and submitted a continuation budget instead. Some education proposals advocated by Collins were passed, including mandatory <a href="kindergarten">kindergarten</a>, <a href="Remedial%20education">remedial programs</a> for elementary school children, mandatory testing and internship for teachers, and the implementation of academic receivership for underperforming schools. Among the other accomplishments of the 1984 legislative session were passage of a tougher <a href="Drunk%20driving%20%28United%20States%29">drunk driving</a> law, and a measure allowing state banking companies to purchase other banks within the state.

By virtue of her election as Kentucky's governor, Collins became the highest-ranking Democratic woman in the nation. The only two women in the U.S. Senate at the time were Republicans, and Collins was the only woman governor of any state. Shortly after her election, she appeared on "<a href="Good%20Morning%20America">Good Morning America</a>", where she was asked about her interest in the <a href="Vice-President%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice-presidency</a> and gave a non-committal answer. Four days after her inauguration as governor, she was chosen to deliver the Democratic response to <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s <a href="Weekly%20Radio%20Address%20of%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">weekly radio address</a>. At a news conference following her speech, Collins was asked again if she would be willing to be considered as the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201984">upcoming election</a>; she replied "No, not at this time."

In mid-1984, the <a href="Democratic%20National%20Committee">Democratic National Committee</a> chose Collins to preside over the <a href="1984%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1984 Democratic National Convention</a> in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. This engagement prevented Collins from chairing the state delegation to the convention, as was typical of governors. The party appointed Collins' son, Steve as state chair. Prior to the convention, <a href="Walter%20Mondale">Walter Mondale</a>, the presumptive presidential nominee, interviewed Collins as a possible vice-presidential candidate before choosing <a href="Geraldine%20Ferraro">Geraldine Ferraro</a> as his running mate. A writer for "<a href="The%20Miami%20Herald">The Miami Herald</a>" later opined, based on interviews with Mondale advisers, that Collins was never given serious consideration by Mondale. He reported that she was included in his list of potential running mates primarily to blunt potential charges of "tokenism" in considering other women and minorities.

In January 1985, Collins renewed her push for additional education funding and changes by appointing herself secretary of the state Education and Humanities Cabinet. Following the announcement, Collins and several key legislators held a series of meetings in every county, advocating for her proposed changes and seeking information about what types of changes the state's citizens desired. At the meetings, Collins was careful to separate the issues of her proposed education plan and potential tax increases. She believed that opposition to increased taxes had prevented her previous package from being enacted.

Collins announced a new education package in June 1985 that included a five percent across-the-board pay raise for teachers, a reduction in class sizes, funding for construction projects, aides for every kindergarten teacher in the state, and a "power equalization" program to make funding for poorer school districts more equal to that of their more affluent counterparts. After favorable reaction to the plan from legislators, she called a special legislative session to convene July 8 to consider the plan. After two weeks of deliberation, the General Assembly approved Collins' education plan, tripling the corporate licensing tax to $2.10 per $1,000 in order to pay for the package. The Assembly rejected a proposed five-cents-per-gallon increase in the state <a href="gasoline%20tax">gasoline tax</a> to finance other spending.

Collins followed up her success in the 1985 special session with a push for more higher education funding in the 1986 legislative session. Lawmakers obliged by approving an additional $100 million for higher education in the biennial budget. They also approved implementation of a pilot preschool program and the purchase of new reading textbooks, but failed to act on Collins' request for an additional $3.9 million to improve the state's <a href="vocational%20education">vocational education</a> system. Legislators approved calling a referendum on a constitutional amendment – supported by Collins – to make the state superintendent of education an appointive, rather than elective, office. The amendment was defeated by the state's voters in November 1986, despite a Collins-led campaign in favor of it. The increased corporate tax intended to cover the cost of the increased education budget was, however, inadequate. In 1987, a plan to increase revenue through changes in the state income tax was abandoned when <a href="Wallace%20Wilkinson">Wallace Wilkinson</a>, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee who would go on to succeed Collins, announced his opposition to it.

In March 1985, Collins embarked on the first of several <a href="trade%20mission">trade mission</a>s to <a href="Japan">Japan</a>. She returned there in October 1985, and also visited <a href="China">China</a> – a first for any Kentucky governor – to encourage opening Chinese markets for Kentucky goods and to establish a "sister state" relationship with China's <a href="Jiangxi">Jiangxi</a> province. Collins' efforts in Japan yielded her most significant accomplishment as governor – convincing <a href="Toyota">Toyota</a> to locate <a href="Toyota%20Motor%20Manufacturing%20Kentucky">an $800 million manufacturing plant</a> in <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Kentucky">Georgetown</a>. According to published reports, the Kentucky location was chosen over proposed sites in <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, and <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>.

The agreement with Toyota was contingent upon legislative approval of $125 million in incentives promised to Toyota by Collins and state Commerce Secretary <a href="Carroll%20Knicely">Carroll Knicely</a>. They included $35 million to buy and improve a tract to be given to Toyota for the plant, $33 million for initial training of employees, $10 million for a skills development center for employees, and $47 million in highway improvements near the site. The incentive package was approved in the 1986 legislative session. State <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Kentucky">Attorney General</a> <a href="David%20L.%20Armstrong">David L. Armstrong</a> expressed concerns that the incentives might conflict with the state constitution by giving gifts from the state treasury to a private business, but concluded that the General Assembly had made "a good-faith effort to be in compliance with the constitution".

Given Armstrong's concerns, the administration employed general counsel J. Patrick Abell to file a friendly <a href="test%20case%20%28law%29">test case</a> to determine the constitutionality of the incentive package. While the suit was pending, the "<a href="Lexington%20Herald-Leader">Lexington Herald-Leader</a>" reported that the administration had failed to include the interest on the <a href="Bond%20%28finance%29">bonds</a> used to finance the expenditures in its estimation of the cost; this, plus the cost overruns reported by the "Herald-Leader", had already pushed the total cost of the package to about $354 million by late September 1986. In October, Toyota agreed to cover the cost overruns associated with preparing the site for construction.

Opponents of the economic enticements for Toyota joined the state's test suit. In October 1986, <a href="Franklin%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Franklin County</a> Circuit Court Judge Ray Corns issued an initial ruling that the package did not violate the state constitution, but both sides asked the Kentucky Supreme Court to make a final decision. On June 11, 1987, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled 4–3 that the package served a public purpose and were therefore constitutional.

Shortly after the announcement that Toyota was moving to Georgetown, Martha Lane Collins, within her capacity as Governor condemned a portion of land belonging to real estate developer Gordon Taub. Taub owned 60 acres within the Toyota plant site and 4.2 acres were condemned to build a four-lane highway to the Toyota plant entrance. Taub challenged the condemnation stating that the Commonwealth did not have the right to condemn private property for the use of a "for profit", public corporation. At trial, Martha Lane Collins became the first sitting governor of Kentucky to testify in court.She was represented by former governor, Bert T. Combs, Taub was represented by former governor Louis B. Nunn; this was also the first time in the history of Kentucky that two former governors represented opposing parties in a legal action.

Later, Toyota set up several assembly plants across the state; near the end of Collins' term, the state Commerce Cabinet reported that 25 automotive-related manufacturing plants had been constructed in 17 counties since the Toyota announcement.

In 1987, Collins promised $10 million in state aid to <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> to incentivize the company to expand its <a href="Kentucky%20Truck%20Assembly">truck assembly plant in Louisville</a>. The state experienced record job growth under Collins' economic development plan, which included attempts to attract both domestic and international companies. The state's unemployment rate fell from 9.7 percent in October 1983 to 7.2 percent in October 1987; according to the administration's own figures, they created a net increase of 73,000 jobs in the state during Collins' tenure.

On October 7, 1987, Collins called a special legislative session to close a deficit between state contributions to the <a href="worker%27s%20compensation">worker's compensation</a> Special Fund and disbursements. The Special Fund was designated for payments to workers with <a href="occupational%20disease">occupational disease</a>s and workers whose work-related injuries could not be traced to any single employer. A plan proposed by Democratic state senator <a href="Ed%20O%27Daniel">Ed O'Daniel</a> was expected to provide the framework for legislation considered in the session. Under O'Daniel's plan, additional revenue for the Special Fund would be raised by increasing assessments on worker's compensation premiums for 30 years. Assessments for coal companies were increased more than those on other businesses because the majority of the claims paid from the Special Fund were for <a href="Coalworker%27s%20pneumoconiosis">black lung</a>, a breathing disease common among coal miners; consequently, it was opposed by legislators from heavily coal-dependent counties. Nevertheless, after nine days of negotiations, a bill substantially similar to O'Daniel's original plan was approved by the legislature and signed by Collins.

Collins chaired the <a href="Tennessee%E2%80%93Tombigbee%20Waterway">Tennessee–Tombigbee Waterway</a> Authority and held that position when the waterway opened to the public in 1985. On May 10, 1985, she was named to the University of Kentucky Alumni Association's Hall of Distinguished Alumni. She also chaired the Southern Growth Policies Board, Southern States Energy Board, and was co-chair of the <a href="Appalachian%20Regional%20Commission">Appalachian Regional Commission</a>.

Collins' term expired on December 8, 1987, and under the restrictions then present in the Kentucky Constitution, she was <a href="Term%20limits%20in%20the%20United%20States">ineligible for consecutive terms</a>. In 1988, she accepted a position as "executive in residence" at the University of Louisville, giving guest lectures to students in the university's business classes. She also started an international trade consulting firm in Lexington. When <a href="Western%20Kentucky%20University">Western Kentucky University</a> president <a href="Kern%20Alexander">Kern Alexander</a> resigned to accept a position at <a href="Virginia%20Polytechnic%20Institute%20and%20State%20University">Virginia Tech</a> in 1988, Collins was among four finalists to succeed him. Some faculty members publicly expressed concerns about Collins' lack of experience in academia, and she withdrew her name from consideration shortly before the new president was announced.
After fulfilling her one-year commitment to the University of Louisville, Collins was named a fellow of the <a href="Harvard%20Institute%20of%20Politics">Harvard Institute of Politics</a>' <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20School%20of%20Government">John F. Kennedy School of Government</a>, teaching non-credit classes on leadership styles once a week. Concurrent with her position at Harvard, Collins was named to the board of regents for <a href="Midway%20College">Midway College</a> in 1989; the following year, she was removed from the board of regents of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Her removal was automatically triggered after she missed three consecutive board meetings between 1986 and 1989. In 1990, Collins accepted the presidency of <a href="Saint%20Catharine%20College">Saint Catharine College</a> in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Kentucky">Springfield, Kentucky</a>, becoming the first president of the small, <a href="Catholicism">Catholic</a> college who was not a <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican</a> nun. College officials stated that Collins was recruited for the presidency to raise the college's profile.

In 1993, Collins' husband, Bill, was charged in an influence-peddling scandal. The prosecution claimed that while Collins was governor, Dr. Collins exploited a perception that he could influence the awarding of state contracts through his wife. It was alleged that he exploited this perception to pressure people who did business with the state to invest nearly $2 million with him. He was convicted on October 14, 1993, after a seven-week trial; he was given a sentence of five years and three months in federal prison, which was at the low end of the range prescribed by the <a href="United%20States%20Federal%20Sentencing%20Guidelines">federal sentencing guidelines</a>. He was also fined $20,000 for a conspiracy charge that involved <a href="Political%20corruption%23Kickbacks">kickbacks</a> disguised as political contributions. Governor Collins was called to testify in the trial, but was not charged. The scandal tarnished her image, however, and may have cost her an appointment in the administration of President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>. Collins was also rumored to be considering running for the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a>, a bid which never materialized following her husband's conviction. The Collinses reunited following Dr. Collins' release from prison on October 10, 1997.

In 1996, Collins resigned as president of Saint Catharine College to direct the International Business and Management Center at the University of Kentucky. Later that year, she was a co-chair of the Credentials Committee at the <a href="1996%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic National Convention</a>. When her contract with the University of Kentucky expired in 1998, Collins took a part-time position as "executive scholar in residence" at Georgetown College, which allowed her more time to pursue other interests. In 1999, she was named Honorary Consul General of Japan in Kentucky, a position which involved promoting Japanese interests in Kentucky, encouraging Japanese investment in the state, and encouraging cultural understanding between Kentucky and Japan. In 2001, Governor <a href="Paul%20E.%20Patton">Paul E. Patton</a> named her co-chair of the Kentucky Task Force on the Economic Status of Women. In January 2005, she became the chairwoman and <a href="chief%20executive%20officer">chief executive officer</a> of the Kentucky World Trade Center. She has held positions on the boards of directors for several corporations, including <a href="Eastman%20Kodak">Eastman Kodak</a>.

Women Leading Kentucky, a non-profit group designed to promote education, mentorship, and networking among Kentucky professional women, created the Martha Layne Collins Leadership Award in 1999 to recognize "a Kentucky woman of achievement who inspires and motivates other women through her personal, community and professional lives"; Collins was the first recipient of the award. In 2003, Kentucky's Bluegrass Parkway was renamed the <a href="Martha%20Layne%20Collins%20Bluegrass%20Parkway">Martha Layne Collins Bluegrass Parkway</a> in her honor; Collins also received the World Trade Day Book of Honor Award for the state of Kentucky from the <a href="World%20Trade%20Centers%20Association">World Trade Centers Association</a> that year. In 2009, she was inducted into the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun">Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star</a> by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Japan%29">Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> for her contributions "to strengthening economic and cultural exchanges between Japan and the United States of America". <a href="Martha%20Layne%20Collins%20High%20School">Martha Layne Collins High School</a> in Shelby County was named in her honor and opened in 2010.

Sino-Roman relations

Sino-Roman relations comprised the mostly indirect contact, flow of trade goods, information, and occasional travellers between the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> and <a href="Han%20dynasty">Han Empire</a> of China, as well as between the later <a href="Eastern%20Roman%20Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a> and various <a href="Dynasties%20in%20Chinese%20history">Chinese dynasties</a>. These empires inched progressively closer in the course of the Roman expansion into the <a href="ancient%20Near%20East">ancient Near East</a> and simultaneous Han Chinese military incursions into <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>. Mutual awareness remained low, and firm knowledge about each other was limited. Only a few attempts at direct contact are known from records. Intermediate empires such as the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthians</a> and <a href="Kushan%20Empire">Kushans</a>, seeking to maintain lucrative control over the silk trade, inhibited direct contact between these two <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>n powers. In 97 AD, the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20China%20before%201911">Chinese</a> general <a href="Ban%20Chao">Ban Chao</a> tried to send his envoy <a href="Gan%20Ying">Gan Ying</a> to <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a>, but Gan was dissuaded by <a href="Parthia">Parthia</a>ns from venturing beyond the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>. Several alleged Roman emissaries to China were recorded by ancient Chinese historians. The first one on record, supposedly from either the Roman emperor <a href="Antoninus%20Pius">Antoninus Pius</a> or his adopted son <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a>, arrived in 166 AD. Others are recorded as arriving in 226 and 284 AD, with a long absence until the first recorded <a href="Byzantine%20diplomacy">Byzantine embassy</a> in 643 AD.

The indirect exchange of goods on land along the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> and <a href="Indo%E2%80%93Roman%20trade%20relations">sea routes</a> included Chinese <a href="silk">silk</a>, <a href="Roman%20glass">Roman glass</a>ware and high-quality cloth. <a href="Roman%20currency">Roman coins</a> minted from the 1st century AD onwards have been found in China, as well as a coin of <a href="Maximian">Maximian</a> and <a href="medal">medal</a>lions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius in <a href="Jiaozhi">Jiaozhi</a> in modern Vietnam, the same region at which Chinese sources claim the Romans first landed. Roman glassware and silverware have been discovered at Chinese archaeological sites dated to the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">Han period</a>. Roman coins and glass beads have also been found in Japan.

In <a href="Classical%20antiquity">classical</a> sources, the problem of identifying references to ancient China is exacerbated by the interpretation of the Latin term "<a href="Seres">Seres</a>", whose meaning fluctuated and could refer to several Asian peoples in a wide arc from India over Central Asia to China. In Chinese records, the Roman Empire came to be known as "<a href="Daqin">Daqin</a>" or Great Qin. Daqin was directly associated with the later "Fulin" () in Chinese sources, which has been identified by scholars such as <a href="Friedrich%20Hirth">Friedrich Hirth</a> as the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. Chinese sources describe several embassies of Fulin arriving in China during the <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang dynasty</a> and also mention the <a href="Siege%20of%20Constantinople%20%28674-678%29">siege of Constantinople</a> by the forces of <a href="Muawiyah%20I">Muawiyah I</a> in 674–678 AD.

<a href="Roman%20geographers">Geographers in the Roman Empire</a> such as <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> provided a rough sketch of the eastern <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, including the <a href="Malay%20Peninsula">Malay Peninsula</a> and beyond this the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Thailand">Gulf of Thailand</a> and <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a>. Ptolemy's <a href="Cattigara">Cattigara</a> was most likely <a href="%C3%93c%20Eo">Óc Eo</a>, Vietnam, where <a href="Antonine">Antonine</a>-era Roman items have been found. Ancient <a href="Chinese%20geography">Chinese geographers</a> demonstrated a general knowledge of <a href="West%20Asia">West Asia</a> and <a href="Roman%20province">Rome's eastern provinces</a>. The 7th-century AD Byzantine historian <a href="Theophylact%20Simocatta">Theophylact Simocatta</a> wrote of the contemporary <a href="Sui%20dynasty">reunification</a> of <a href="northern%20and%20southern%20China">northern and southern China</a>, which he treated as <a href="Northern%20and%20Southern%20dynasties">separate nations recently at war</a>. This mirrors both the <a href="Chen%20dynasty">conquest of Chen</a> by <a href="Emperor%20Wen%20of%20Sui">Emperor Wen of Sui</a> (reigned 581–604 AD) as well as the names "<a href="Cathay">Cathay</a>" and "<a href="Manzi%20%28geography%29">Mangi</a>" used by later <a href="Europeans%20in%20Medieval%20China">medieval Europeans in China</a> during the <a href="Mongol%20Empire">Mongol</a>-led <a href="Yuan%20dynasty">Yuan dynasty</a> and <a href="Han%20Chinese">Han-Chinese</a> <a href="Southern%20Song%20dynasty">Southern Song dynasty</a>.

Beginning in the 1st century BC with <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>, <a href="Horace">Horace</a>, and <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>, Roman histories offer only vague accounts of China and the silk-producing Seres people of the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>, who were perhaps the ancient Chinese. The 1st-century AD geographer <a href="Pomponius%20Mela">Pomponius Mela</a> asserted that the lands of the Seres formed the centre of the coast of <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">an eastern ocean</a>, flanked to the south by India and to the north by the <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a> of the <a href="Eurasian%20Steppe">Eurasian Steppe</a>. The 2nd-century AD Roman historian <a href="Florus">Florus</a> seems to have confused the Seres with peoples of India, or at least noted that their skin complexions proved that they both lived "beneath another sky" than the Romans. Roman authors generally seem to have been confused about where the Seres were located, in either Central Asia or East Asia. The historian <a href="Ammianus%20Marcellinus">Ammianus Marcellinus</a> (c. 330 – c. 400 AD) wrote that the land of the Seres was enclosed by great natural walls around a river called Bautis, possibly a description of the <a href="Yellow%20River">Yellow River</a>.

The existence of China was known to <a href="Roman%20cartographers">Roman cartographers</a>, but their understanding of it was less certain. Ptolemy's 2nd-century AD "<a href="Ptolemy%27s%20Geography">Geography</a>" separates the Land of Silk ("Serica") at the end of the overland <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> from the land of the <a href="Qin%20Empire">Qin</a> ("Sinae") reached by sea. The Sinae are placed on the northern shore of the <a href="Magnus%20Sinus">Great Gulf</a> ("Magnus Sinus") east of the <a href="Golden%20Peninsula">Golden Peninsula</a> ("Aurea Chersonesus", Malay Peninsula). Their chief port, Cattigara, seems to have been in the lower <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a>. The Great Gulf served as a combined <a href="Gulf%20of%20Thailand">Gulf of Thailand</a> and <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a>, as <a href="Marinus%20of%20Tyre">Marinus of Tyre</a> and Ptolemy's belief that the Indian Ocean was an inland sea caused them to bend the <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>n coast south beyond the equator before turning west to join southern <a href="Ancient%20Libya">Libya</a> (<a href="Africa">Africa</a>). Much of this is given as <a href="terra%20incognita">unknown lands</a>, but the north-eastern area is placed under the Sinae.

Classical geographers such as <a href="Geographica">Strabo</a> and <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> were slow to incorporate new information into their works and, from their positions as <a href="auctoritas">esteemed scholars</a>, were seemingly prejudiced against lowly merchants and their <a href="topographical">topographical</a> accounts. Ptolemy's work represents a break from this, since he demonstrated an openness to their accounts and would not have been able to chart the <a href="Bay%20of%20Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a> so accurately without the input of traders. In the 1st-century AD "<a href="Periplus%20of%20the%20Erythraean%20Sea">Periplus of the Erythraean Sea</a>", its anonymous Greek-speaking author, a merchant of <a href="Roman%20Egypt">Roman Egypt</a>, provides such vivid accounts of eastern trade cities that it is clear he visited many of them. These include sites in Arabia, Pakistan, and India, including <a href="guide%20book">travel times from rivers and towns</a>, where to <a href="anchorage%20%28shipping%29">drop anchor</a>, the locations of royal courts, lifestyles of the locals and goods found in their markets, and favourable times of year to sail from Egypt to these places to catch the <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a> winds. The "Periplus" also mentions a great inland city, "Thinae" (or "Sinae"), in a country called "This" that perhaps stretched as far as the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian</a>. The text notes that silk produced there travelled to neighbouring India via the <a href="Ganges">Ganges</a> and to <a href="Bactria">Bactria</a> by a land route. Marinus and Ptolemy had relied on the testimony of a Greek sailor named Alexander, probably a merchant, for how to reach Cattigara (most likely Óc Eo, Vietnam). Alexander (Greek: Alexandros) mentions that the main terminus for Roman traders was a Burmese city called Tamala on the north-west Malay Peninsula, where Indian merchants travelled overland across the <a href="Kra%20Isthmus">Kra Isthmus</a> to reach the Perimulic Gulf (the Gulf of <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>). Alexandros claimed that it took twenty days to sail from Thailand to a port called "Zabia" (or "Zaba") in southern Vietnam. According to him, one could continue along the coast (of southern Vietnam) from Zabia until reaching the trade port of Cattigara after an unspecified number of days (with "some" being interpreted as "many" by Marinus).

<a href="Cosmas%20Indicopleustes">Cosmas Indicopleustes</a>, a 6th-century AD Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Greek monk from <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> and former merchant with experience in the Indian Ocean trade, was the first Roman to write clearly about China in his "<a href="Christian%20Topography">Christian Topography</a>" (c. 550 AD). He called it the country of "<a href="Names%20of%20China">Tzinista</a>" (comparable to <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> "Chinasthana" and <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac</a> "Sinistan" from the 781 AD <a href="Nestorian%20Stele">Nestorian Stele</a> of <a href="Xi%27an">Xi'an</a>, China), located in easternmost Asia. He explained the maritime route towards it (first sailing east and then north up the southern coast of the Asian continent) and the fact that <a href="clove">clove</a>s came that way to <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> for sale. By the time of <a href="Byzantine%20emperor">the Eastern Roman</a> ruler <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a> (r. 527–565 AD), the Byzantines purchased Chinese silk from <a href="Sogdia">Sogdia</a>n intermediaries. They also <a href="Smuggling%20of%20silkworm%20eggs%20into%20the%20Byzantine%20Empire">smuggled silkworms out of China</a> with the help of <a href="Nestorian">Nestorian</a> monks, who claimed that the land of <a href="Serindia">Serindia</a> was located north of India and produced the finest silk. By smuggling silkworms and producing silk of their own, the Byzantines could bypass the Chinese silk trade dominated by their chief rivals, the <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Sasanian Empire</a>.

From <a href="Turkic%20Khaganate">Turkic peoples</a> of Central Asia during the <a href="Northern%20Wei">Northern Wei</a> (386–535 AD) period the Eastern Romans acquired yet another <a href="Names%20of%20China">name for China</a>: "<a href="Tuoba">Taugast</a>" (<a href="Old%20Turkic%20language">Old Turkic</a>: "<a href="Tuoba">Tabghach</a>"). <a href="Theophylact%20Simocatta">Theophylact Simocatta</a>, a historian during the reign of <a href="Heraclius">Heraclius</a> (r. 610–641 AD), wrote that Taugast (or Taugas) was a great eastern empire <a href="Xianbei">colonised by Turkic people</a>, with a capital city northeast of India that he called "Khubdan" (from the Turkic word "Khumdan" used for the <a href="Sui%20dynasty">Sui</a> and Tang capital <a href="Chang%27an">Chang'an</a>), where <a href="Chinese%20folk%20religion">idolatry was practised</a> but the people were wise and lived by just laws. He depicted the Chinese empire as being divided by a great river (the <a href="Yangzi">Yangzi</a>) that served as the boundary between <a href="Northern%20and%20Southern%20dynasties">two rival nations at war</a>; during the reign of Byzantine Emperor <a href="Maurice%20%28emperor%29">Maurice</a> (582–602 AD) the northerners wearing "black coats" conquered the "red coats" of the south (black being a distinctive colour worn by the people of <a href="Shaanxi">Shaanxi</a>, location of the Sui capital Sui Chang'an, according to the 16th-century Persian traveller Hajji Mahomed, or Chaggi Memet). This account may correspond to the conquest of the <a href="Chen%20dynasty">Chen dynasty</a> and reunification of China by <a href="Emperor%20Wen%20of%20Sui">Emperor Wen of Sui</a> (r. 581–604 AD). Simocatta names their ruler as "Taisson", which he claimed meant <a href="Chinese%20emperor">Son of God</a>, either correlating to the Chinese "Tianzi" (<a href="Son%20of%20Heaven">Son of Heaven</a>) or even the name of the contemporary ruler <a href="Emperor%20Taizong%20of%20Tang">Emperor Taizong of Tang</a> (r. 626 – 649 AD). Later <a href="Europeans%20in%20Medieval%20China">medieval Europeans in China</a> wrote of it as two separate countries, with "<a href="Cathay">Cathay</a>" in the north and "<a href="Manzi%20%28geography%29">Mangi</a>" in the south, during the period when the <a href="Yuan%20dynasty">Yuan dynasty</a> led by Mongol ruler <a href="Kublai%20Khan">Kublai Khan</a> (r. 1260–1294 AD) conquered the <a href="Southern%20Song%20Dynasty">Southern Song Dynasty</a>.

Detailed geographical information about the Roman Empire, at least its easternmost territories, is provided in traditional <a href="Chinese%20historiography">Chinese historiography</a>. The "<a href="Records%20of%20the%20Grand%20Historian">Shiji</a>" by <a href="Sima%20Qian">Sima Qian</a> (c. 145–86 BC) gives descriptions of countries in <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a> and <a href="West%20Asia">West Asia</a>. These accounts became significantly more nuanced in the "<a href="Book%20of%20Han">Book of Han</a>", co-authored by <a href="Ban%20Gu">Ban Gu</a> and his sister <a href="Ban%20Zhao">Ban Zhao</a>, younger siblings of the general <a href="Ban%20Chao">Ban Chao</a>, who led military exploits <a href="Protectorate%20of%20the%20Western%20Regions">into Central Asia</a> before returning to China in 102 AD. The westernmost territories of Asia as described in the "<a href="Book%20of%20the%20Later%20Han">Book of the Later Han</a>" compiled by <a href="Fan%20Ye%20%28historian%29">Fan Ye</a> (398–445 AD) formed the basis for almost all later accounts of Daqin. These accounts seem to be restricted to descriptions of the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>, particularly <a href="History%20of%20Syria">Syria</a>. Historical linguist <a href="Edwin%20G.%20Pulleyblank">Edwin G. Pulleyblank</a> explains that Chinese historians considered Daqin to be a kind of "counter-China" located at the opposite end of their known world. According to Pulleyblank, "the Chinese conception of Dà Qín was confused from the outset with ancient <a href="Chinese%20mythology">mythological notions</a> about the far west". The Chinese histories explicitly related Daqin and Lijian (also "Li-kan", or Syria) as belonging to the same country; according to Yule, D. D. Leslie, and K. H. G. Gardiner, the earliest descriptions of Lijian in the "Shiji" distinguished it as the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic-era</a> <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a>. Pulleyblank provides some linguistic analysis to dispute their proposal, arguing that Tiaozhi () in the "Shiji" was most likely the Seleucid Empire and that Lijian, although still poorly understood, could be identified with either <a href="Hyrcania">Hyrcania</a> in <a href="History%20of%20Iran">Iran</a> or even <a href="History%20of%20Alexandria">Alexandria in Egypt</a>.

The "<a href="Weil%C3%BCe">Weilüe</a>" by <a href="Yu%20Huan">Yu Huan</a> (c. 239–265 AD), preserved in <a href="Annotations%20to%20Records%20of%20the%20Three%20Kingdoms">annotations to</a> the "<a href="Records%20of%20the%20Three%20Kingdoms">Records of the Three Kingdoms</a>" (published in 429 AD by <a href="Pei%20Songzhi">Pei Songzhi</a>), also provides details about the easternmost portion of the Roman world, including mention of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. For Roman Egypt, the book explains the location of Alexandria, travelling distances along the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> and the tripartite division of the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile Delta</a>, <a href="Heptanomis">Heptanomis</a>, and <a href="Thebaid">Thebaid</a>. In his "<a href="Zhu%20Fan%20Zhi">Zhu Fan Zhi</a>", the <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song</a>-era <a href="Quanzhou">Quanzhou</a> customs inspector <a href="Zhao%20Rugua">Zhao Rugua</a> (1170–1228 AD) described the ancient <a href="Lighthouse%20of%20Alexandria">Lighthouse of Alexandria</a>. Both the "Book of the Later Han" and the "Weilüe" mention the "flying" <a href="pontoon%20bridge">pontoon bridge</a> () over the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> at <a href="Zeugma%2C%20Commagene">Zeugma, Commagene</a> in <a href="Roman%20Anatolia">Roman Anatolia</a>. The "Weilüe" also listed what it considered the most important dependent <a href="vassal">vassal</a> states of the Roman Empire, providing travel directions and estimates for the distances between them (in <a href="li%20%28unit%29">Chinese miles, "li"</a>). Friedrich Hirth (1885) identified the locations and dependent states of Rome named in the "Weilüe"; some of his identifications have been disputed. Hirth identified Si-fu () as <a href="Emesa">Emesa</a>; John E. Hill (2004) uses linguistic and situational evidence to argue it was <a href="Petra">Petra</a> in the <a href="Nabataean%20Kingdom">Nabataean Kingdom</a>, which was annexed by Rome in 106 AD during the reign of <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a>.

The "<a href="Old%20Book%20of%20Tang">Old Book of Tang</a>" and "<a href="New%20Book%20of%20Tang">New Book of Tang</a>" record that <a href="Muslim%20conquests">the Arabs</a> ("Da shi" ) sent their commander Mo-yi (, <a href="pinyin">pinyin</a>: "Móyè", i.e. <a href="Muawiyah%20I">Muawiyah I</a>, <a href="History%20of%20Syria%23Medieval%20era">governor of Syria</a> and later <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyad caliph</a>, r. 661–680 AD) to <a href="Siege%20of%20Constantinople%20%28674%E2%80%93678%29">besiege the Byzantine capital</a>, Constantinople, and forced the Byzantines to pay them tribute. The same books also described Constantinople in some detail as having <a href="Walls%20of%20Constantinople">strong granite walls</a> and a <a href="water%20clock">water clock</a> mounted with a golden statue of man. <a href="Henry%20Yule">Henry Yule</a> noted that the name of the Byzantine negotiator "Yenyo" (the patrician <a href="John%20Pitzigaudes">John Pitzigaudes</a>) was mentioned in Chinese sources, an envoy who was unnamed in <a href="Edward%20Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a>'s account of the man sent to <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a> to hold a parley with the Umayyads, followed a few years later by the increase of tributary demands on the Byzantines. The "New Book of Tang" and "<a href="Wenxian%20Tongkao">Wenxian Tongkao</a>" described the land of <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a> (either the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kush">Kingdom of Kush</a> or <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Aksum">Aksum</a>) as a desert south-west of the Byzantine Empire that was infested with <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, where the natives had <a href="Black%20people">black skin</a> and consumed <a href="Palm%20date">Persian dates</a>. In discussing the three <a href="Islamization%20of%20the%20Sudan%20region">main religions of Nubia</a> (the Sudan), the "Wenxian Tongkao" mentions the <a href="Christianity%20in%20Sudan">Daqin religion</a> there and the <a href="Sabbath">day of rest</a> occurring every seven days for those following the faith of the "Da shi" (the <a href="Islam%20in%20Sudan">Muslim Arabs</a>). It also repeats the claim in the "New Book of Tang" about the <a href="Roman%20medicine">Eastern Roman surgical practice</a> of <a href="trepanning">trepanning</a> to remove parasites from the brain. The descriptions of Nubia and <a href="Horn%20of%20Africa">Horn of Africa</a> in the "Wenxian Tongkao" were ultimately derived from the "<a href="Jingxingji">Jingxingji</a>" of <a href="Du%20Huan">Du Huan</a> (fl. 8th century AD), a Chinese travel writer whose text, preserved in the "<a href="Tongdian">Tongdian</a>" of <a href="Du%20You">Du You</a>, is perhaps <a href="Ethiopian%20historiography">the first Chinese source</a> to describe <a href="Ethiopian%20Empire">Ethiopia</a> ("Laobosa"), in addition to offering descriptions of <a href="History%20of%20Eritrea">Eritrea</a> ("Molin").

Some contact may have occurred between <a href="Hellenistic%20Greece">Hellenistic Greeks</a> and the <a href="Qin%20dynasty">Qin dynasty</a> in the late 3rd century BC, following the Central Asian campaigns of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>, king of <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>, and the establishment of <a href="Hellenistic%20civilization">Hellenistic kingdoms</a> relatively close to China, such as the <a href="Greco-Bactrian%20Kingdom">Greco-Bactrian Kingdom</a>. Excavations at <a href="Mausoleum%20of%20the%20First%20Qin%20Emperor">the burial site</a> of China's first Emperor <a href="Qin%20Shi%20Huang">Qin Shi Huang</a> (r. 221–210 BC) suggest <a href="Hellenistic%20art">Greek stylistic</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20technology">technological</a> influences in the artworks found there, including the famous <a href="terracotta%20army">terracotta army</a>. Cultural exchanges at such an early date are generally regarded as conjectural in academia, but excavations of a 4th-century BC tomb in Gansu province belonging to the <a href="state%20of%20Qin">state of Qin</a> have yielded Western items such as glass beads and a blue-glazed (possibly <a href="faience">faience</a>) beaker of Mediterranean origin. Trade and diplomatic relations between China's Han Empire and remnants of Hellenistic Greek civilization under the rule of the nomadic <a href="Yuezhi">Da Yuezhi</a> began with the Central Asian journeys of the Han envoy <a href="Zhang%20Qian">Zhang Qian</a> (d. 113 BC). He brought back reports to the court of <a href="Emperor%20Wu%20of%20Han">Emperor Wu of Han</a> about the "<a href="Dayuan">Dayuan</a>" in the <a href="Fergana%20Valley">Fergana Valley</a>, with <a href="Alexandria%20Eschate">Alexandria Eschate</a> as its capital, and the "<a href="Daxia">Daxia</a>" of <a href="Bactria">Bactria</a>, in what is now Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The only well-known Roman traveller to have visited the easternmost fringes of Central Asia was <a href="Maes%20Titianus">Maes Titianus</a>, a contemporary of <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a> in either the late 1st or early 2nd century AD who visited a "Stone Tower" that has been identified by historians as either <a href="Tashkurgan%20Town">Tashkurgan</a> in the Chinese <a href="Pamirs">Pamirs</a> or a similar monument in the <a href="Alai%20Valley">Alai Valley</a> just west of <a href="Kashgar">Kashgar</a>, Xinjiang, China.

The historian Florus described the visit of numerous envoys, including the "<a href="Seres">Seres</a>" (possibly the Chinese) to the court of the first <a href="Roman%20Emperor">Roman Emperor</a> <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> (r. 27 BC – 14 AD):
In the entire corpus of <a href="Roman%20literature">Roman literature</a> and <a href="Roman%20historiography">historiography</a>, Yule was unable to uncover any other mention of such a direct diplomatic encounter between the Romans and the Seres. He speculated that these people were more likely to have been private merchants than diplomats, since Chinese records insist that <a href="Gan%20Ying">Gan Ying</a> was the first Chinese to reach as far west as Tiaozhi (; <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>) in 97 AD. Yule notes that the 1st-century AD "Periplus" mentioned that people of "Thinae" (<a href="Sinae">Sinae</a>) were rarely seen, because of the difficulties of reaching that country. It states that their country, located under <a href="Ursa%20Minor">Ursa Minor</a> and on the farthest unknown reaches of the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>, was the origin of raw silk and fine silk cloth that was traded overland from Bactria to <a href="Barygaza">Barygaza</a>, as well as down the Ganges.

The <a href="Eastern%20Han">Eastern Han</a> general <a href="Ban%20Chao">Ban Chao</a> (32–102 AD), in a series of military successes which brought the <a href="Western%20Regions">Western Regions</a> (the <a href="Tarim%20Basin">Tarim Basin</a> of Xinjiang) back under Chinese control and suzerainty, defeated the Da Yuezhi in 90 AD and the <a href="Xiongnu">Northern Xiongnu</a> in 91 AD, forcing the submission of city-states such as <a href="Kucha">Kucha</a> and <a href="Turfan">Turfan</a>, <a href="Khotan">Khotan</a> and <a href="Kashgar">Kashgar</a> (Indo-European <a href="Tocharians">Tocharian</a> and <a href="Saka">Saka</a> settlements, respectively), and finally <a href="Karasahr">Karasahr</a> in 94 AD. An embassy from the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian Empire</a> had earlier arrived at the Han court in 89 AD and, while Ban was stationed with his army in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Khotan">Khotan</a>, another Parthian embassy came in 101 AD, this time bringing exotic gifts such as <a href="ostrich">ostrich</a>es.

In 97 AD, Ban Chao sent an envoy named Gan Ying to explore the far west. Gan made his way from the Tarim Basin to <a href="Parthia">Parthia</a> and reached the Persian Gulf. Gan left a detailed account of western countries; he apparently reached as far as Mesopotamia, then under the control of the Parthian Empire. He intended to sail to the Roman Empire, but was discouraged when told that the trip was dangerous and could take two years. Deterred, he returned to China bringing much new information on the countries to the west of Chinese-controlled territories, as far as the <a href="Mediterranean%20Basin">Mediterranean Basin</a>.

Gan Ying is thought to have left an account of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> (Daqin in Chinese) which relied on secondary sources—likely sailors in the ports which he visited. The "Book of the Later Han" locates it in "Haixi" ("west of the sea", or <a href="Roman%20Egypt">Roman Egypt</a>; the sea is the one known to the Greeks and Romans as the <a href="Erythraean%20Sea">Erythraean Sea</a>, which included the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, the <a href="Arabian%20Sea">Arabian Sea</a>, and Red Sea):

The "Book of the Later Han" gives a positive, if inaccurate, view of <a href="Cursus%20honorum">Roman governance</a>:
Yule noted that although the description of the <a href="Roman%20Constitution">Roman Constitution</a> and products was garbled, the "Book of the Later Han" offered an accurate depiction of the <a href="Coral%20reef%20fish">coral fisheries in the Mediterranean</a>. <a href="Coral">Coral</a> was a highly valued luxury item in Han China, imported among other items from India (mostly overland and perhaps also by sea), the latter region being where the Romans sold coral and obtained <a href="pearl">pearl</a>s. The original list of Roman products given in the "Book of the Later Han", such as <a href="sea%20silk">sea silk</a>, <a href="glass">glass</a>, <a href="amber">amber</a>, <a href="cinnabar">cinnabar</a>, and <a href="asbestos">asbestos</a> cloth, is expanded in the "<a href="Weil%C3%BCe">Weilüe</a>". The "Weilüe" also claimed that in 134 AD the ruler of the <a href="Shule%20Kingdom">Shule Kingdom</a> (Kashgar), who had been a hostage at the court of the <a href="Kushan%20Empire">Kushan Empire</a>, offered blue (or green) gems originating from "Haixi" as gifts to the Eastern Han court. <a href="Fan%20Ye%20%28historian%29">Fan Ye</a>, the editor of the "Book of the Later Han", wrote that former generations of Chinese had never reached these far western regions, but that the report of Gan Ying revealed to the Chinese their lands, customs and products. The "Book of the Later Han" also asserts that the Parthians (<a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese</a>: 安息; "Anxi") wished "to control the trade in multi-coloured Chinese silks" and therefore intentionally blocked the Romans from reaching China.

It is possible that a group of Greek acrobatic performers, who claimed to be from a place "west of the seas" (Roman Egypt, which the "Book of the Later Han" related to the Daqin empire), were presented <a href="Pyu%20city-states">by a king of Burma</a> to Emperor An of Han in 120 AD. It is known that in both the Parthian Empire and Kushan Empire of Asia, ethnic Greeks continued to be employed after the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a> as musicians and athletes. The "Book of the Later Han" states that Emperor An transferred these entertainers from his countryside residence to the capital <a href="Luoyang">Luoyang</a>, where they gave a performance at his court and were rewarded with gold, silver, and other gifts. Raoul McLaughlin notes that the Romans knew Burma as "<a href="Greater%20India%23Medieval%20Europe">India Trans Gangem</a>" (India Beyond the Ganges) and that <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> listed the cities of Burma. McLaughlin speculates that the Romans <a href="History%20of%20slavery">were selling slaves</a> to the Burmese and that this is how the entertainers originally reached Burma before they were sent by the Burmese ruler to Emperor An in China. Syrian jugglers were renowned in Western <a href="Classical%20literature">Classical literature</a>, and Chinese sources from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD mention them as well.

The first group of people claiming to be an ambassadorial mission of Romans to China was recorded as having arrived in 166 AD by the "Book of the Later Han". The embassy came to <a href="Emperor%20Huan%20of%20Han">Emperor Huan</a> of <a href="Han%20China">Han China</a> from "Andun" (; Emperor <a href="Antoninus%20Pius">Antoninus Pius</a> or <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius Antoninus</a>), "king of Daqin" (Rome). As Antoninus Pius died in 161 AD, leaving the empire to his adoptive son Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and the envoy arrived in 166 AD, confusion remains about who sent the mission, as both emperors were named "Antoninus". The Roman mission came from the south (therefore probably by sea), entering China by the frontier of <a href="Rinan">Rinan</a> or <a href="Tonkin">Tonkin</a> (present-day Vietnam). It brought presents of <a href="Rhinoceros%23Horn%20trade%20and%20use">rhinoceros horns</a>, <a href="ivory">ivory</a>, and <a href="tortoise">tortoise</a> <a href="Animal%20shell">shell</a>, probably acquired in <a href="Southern%20Asia">Southern Asia</a>. The text states that it was the first time there had been direct contact between the two countries. Yule speculated that the Roman visitors must have lost their original wares due to robbery or shipwreck and used the gifts instead, prompting Chinese sources to suspect them of withholding their more precious valuables, which Yule notes was the same criticism directed at <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Beijing">papal missionary</a> <a href="John%20of%20Montecorvino">John of Montecorvino</a> when he arrived in China in the late 13th century AD. Historians <a href="Rafe%20de%20Crespigny">Rafe de Crespigny</a>, <a href="Peter%20Fibiger%20Bang">Peter Fibiger Bang</a>, and <a href="Warwick%20Ball">Warwick Ball</a> believe that this was most likely a group of <a href="Roman%20commerce">Roman merchants</a> rather than official diplomats sent by Marcus Aurelius. Crespigny stresses that the presence of this Roman embassy as well as others from <a href="Tianzhu%20%28India%29">Tianzhu</a> (in <a href="northern%20India">northern India</a>) and <a href="Buyeo">Buyeo</a> (in <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a>) provided much-needed prestige for Emperor Huan, as he was facing serious <a href="Disasters%20of%20the%20Partisan%20Prohibitions">political troubles and fallout</a> for the forced suicide of politician <a href="Liang%20Ji">Liang Ji</a>, who had dominated the Han government well after the death of his sister <a href="Empress%20Liang%20Na">Empress Liang Na</a>. Yule emphasised that the Roman embassy was said to come by way of <a href="Jiaozhi">Jiaozhi</a> in northern Vietnam, the same route that Chinese sources claimed the embassies from Tianzhu (northern India) had used in 159 and 161 AD.

The "<a href="Weil%C3%BCe">Weilüe</a>" and "<a href="Book%20of%20Liang">Book of Liang</a>" record the arrival in 226 AD of a merchant <a href="Daqin%23Naming%20conventions">named Qin Lun</a> () from <a href="History%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire">the Roman Empire</a> (Daqin) at Jiaozhi (Chinese-controlled northern Vietnam). Wu Miao, the Prefect of Jiaozhi, sent him to the court of <a href="Sun%20Quan">Sun Quan</a> (the ruler of <a href="Eastern%20Wu">Eastern Wu</a> during the <a href="Three%20Kingdoms">Three Kingdoms</a>) in <a href="Nanjing">Nanjing</a>, where Sun requested that he provide him with a report on his native country and its people. An expedition was mounted to return the merchant along with ten female and ten male "blackish coloured dwarfs" he had requested as a curiosity, as well as a Chinese officer, Liu Xian of Huiji (in <a href="Zhejiang">Zhejiang</a>), who died en route. According to the "Weilüe" and "Book of Liang" Roman merchants were active in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Funan">Cambodia and Vietnam</a>, a claim supported by modern archaeological finds of ancient Mediterranean goods in the <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>n countries of Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

Yule mentions that in the early 3rd century AD a ruler of Daqin sent an envoy with gifts to the northern Chinese court of <a href="Cao%20Wei">Cao Wei</a> (220–265 AD) that included <a href="Dichroic%20glass">glassware of various colours</a>. Several years later a Daqin craftsman is mentioned as showing the Chinese how to make "<a href="Glassblowing">flints into crystal by means of fire</a>", a curiosity to the Chinese.

Another embassy from Daqin is recorded as bringing tributary gifts to the Chinese <a href="Western%20Jin">Jin Empire</a> (265–420 AD). This occurred in 284 AD during the reign of <a href="Emperor%20Wu%20of%20Jin">Emperor Wu of Jin</a> (r. 266–290 AD), and was recorded in the "<a href="Book%20of%20Jin">Book of Jin</a>", as well as the later "<a href="Wenxian%20Tongkao">Wenxian Tongkao</a>". This embassy was presumably sent by the Emperor <a href="Carus">Carus</a> (r. 282–283 AD), whose brief reign was <a href="Bahram%20II">preoccupied by war</a> with <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Sasanian Persia</a>.

Chinese histories for the <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang dynasty</a> (618–907 AD) record contacts with merchants from "Fulin" (), the new name used to designate the Byzantine Empire. The first reported diplomatic contact took place in 643 AD during the reigns of <a href="Constans%20II">Constans II</a> (641–668 AD) and <a href="Emperor%20Taizong%20of%20Tang">Emperor Taizong of Tang</a> (626–649 AD). The "<a href="Old%20Book%20of%20Tang">Old Book of Tang</a>", followed by the "<a href="New%20Book%20of%20Tang">New Book of Tang</a>", provides the name "Po-to-li" (, <a href="pinyin">pinyin</a>: "Bōduōlì") for Constans II, which Hirth conjectured to be a transliteration of "Kōnstantinos Pogonatos", or "Constantine the Bearded", giving him the title of a <a href="Chinese%20nobility">king</a> (王 "wáng"). Yule and S. A. M. Adshead offer a different transliteration stemming from "<a href="patriarch">patriarch</a>" or "<a href="Patrician%20%28ancient%20Rome%29">patrician</a>", possibly a reference to one of the acting <a href="regent">regent</a>s for the 13-year-old Byzantine monarch. The Tang histories record that Constans II sent an embassy in the 17th year of the Zhenguan () regnal period (643 AD), bearing gifts of <a href="Cranberry%20glass">red glass</a> and green <a href="gemstone">gemstone</a>s. Yule points out that <a href="Yazdegerd%20III">Yazdegerd III</a> (r. 632–651 AD), last ruler of the Sasanian Empire, sent diplomats to China to secure aid from Emperor Taizong (<a href="Protectorate%20General%20to%20Pacify%20the%20West">considered the suzerain</a> over <a href="Ferghana">Ferghana</a> in Central Asia) during the loss of the <a href="Persian%20Empire">Persian heartland</a> to the Islamic <a href="Rashidun%20Caliphate">Rashidun Caliphate</a>, which may also have prompted the Byzantines to send envoys to China amid their <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20the%20Levant">recent loss of Syria to the Muslims</a>. Tang Chinese sources also recorded how Sasanian prince <a href="Peroz%20III">Peroz III</a> (636–679 AD) fled to Tang China following the <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Persia">conquest of Persia by the growing Islamic caliphate</a>.

Yule asserts that the additional Fulin embassies during the Tang period arrived in 711 and 719 AD, with another in 742 AD that may have been Nestorian monks. Adshead lists four official diplomatic contacts with Fulin in the "Old Book of Tang" as occurring in 643, 667, 701, and 719 AD. He speculates that the absence of these missions in Western literary sources can be explained by how the Byzantines typically viewed political relations with powers of the East, as well as the possibility that they were launched on behalf of frontier officials instead of <a href="Byzantine%20bureaucracy%20and%20aristocracy">the central government</a>. Yule and Adshead concur that a Fulin diplomatic mission occurred during the reign of <a href="Justinian%20II">Justinian II</a> (r. 685–695 AD; 705–711 AD). Yule claims it occurred in the year of the emperor's death, 711 AD, whereas Adshead contends that it took place in 701 AD during the usurpation of <a href="Leontios">Leontios</a> and the emperor's exile in <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a>, perhaps the reason for its omission in <a href="Roman%20historiography">Byzantine records</a> and the source for confusion in Chinese histories about precisely who sent this embassy. Justinian II regained the throne with the aid of <a href="Bulgars">Bulgars</a> and a marriage alliance with the <a href="Khazars">Khazars</a>. Adshead therefore believes a mission sent to Tang China would be consistent with Justinian II's behaviour, especially if he had knowledge of the permission <a href="Empress%20Wu%20Zetian">Empress Wu Zetian</a> granted to <a href="Narsieh">Narsieh</a>, son of Peroz III, to march against the Arabs in Central Asia at the end of the 7th century. The 719 AD Fulin embassy ostensibly came from <a href="Leo%20III%20the%20Isaurian">Leo III the Isaurian</a> (r. 717–741 AD) to the court of <a href="Emperor%20Xuanzong%20of%20Tang">Emperor Xuanzong of Tang</a> (r. 712–756 AD), during a time when the Byzantine emperor was again reaching out to Eastern powers with a renewed Khazar marriage alliance. The year of this embassy coincided with Xuanzong's refusal to provide aid to the <a href="Sogdia">Sogdia</a>ns of <a href="Bukhara">Bukhara</a> and <a href="Samarkand">Samarkand</a> against the <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Transoxiana">Arab invasion force</a>. An embassy from the Umayyad Caliphate was received by the Tang court in 732 AD; the Arab victory at the 751 AD <a href="Battle%20of%20Talas">Battle of Talas</a> and the <a href="An%20Lushan%20Rebellion">An Lushan Rebellion</a> crippled Tang Chinese interventionist efforts in Central Asia.

The last diplomatic contacts with Fulin are recorded as having taken place in the 11th century AD. From the "Wenxian Tongkao", written by historian <a href="Ma%20Duanlin">Ma Duanlin</a> (1245–1322), and from the "<a href="History%20of%20Song">History of Song</a>", it is known that the Byzantine emperor <a href="Michael%20VII%20Doukas">Michael VII Parapinakēs Caesar</a> (, "Mie li sha ling kai sa") of Fulin sent an embassy to China's <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song dynasty</a> that arrived in 1081 AD, during the reign of <a href="Emperor%20Shenzong%20of%20Song">Emperor Shenzong of Song</a> (r. 1067–1085 AD). The "History of Song" described the tributary gifts given by the Byzantine embassy as well as the products made in Byzantium. It also described punishments used in <a href="Byzantine%20law">Byzantine law</a>, such as the <a href="capital%20punishment">capital punishment</a> of being stuffed into a "feather bag" and thrown into the sea, probably the Romano-Byzantine practice of "<a href="poena%20cullei">poena cullei</a>" (from <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> 'penalty of the sack'). The final recorded embassy arrived in 1091 AD, during the reign of <a href="Alexios%20I%20Komnenos">Alexios I Komnenos</a> (r. 1081–1118 AD); this event is only mentioned in passing.

The "<a href="History%20of%20Yuan">History of Yuan</a>" offers a biography of a Byzantine man named Ai-sie (transliteration of either Joshua or Joseph), who originally served the court of <a href="G%C3%BCy%C3%BCk%20Khan">Güyük Khan</a> but later became a head <a href="Byzantine%20astronomy">astronomer</a> and <a href="Byzantine%20medicine">physician</a> for the court of <a href="Kublai%20Khan">Kublai Khan</a>, the Mongol founder of the <a href="Yuan%20dynasty">Yuan dynasty</a> (1271–1368 AD), at <a href="Khanbaliq">Khanbaliq</a> (modern <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a>). He was eventually granted the title Prince of Fulin (, "Fúlǐn wáng") and his children were listed with their <a href="Chinese%20name">Chinese name</a>s, which seem to match with transliterations of the <a href="Christian%20name">Christian name</a>s Elias, Luke, and Antony. Kublai Khan is also known to have sent Nestorian monks, including <a href="Rabban%20Bar%20Sauma">Rabban Bar Sauma</a>, to the court of Byzantine ruler <a href="Andronikos%20II%20Palaiologos">Andronikos II Palaiologos</a> (r. 1282–1328 AD), whose <a href="Byzantine-Mongol%20alliance">half-sisters were married to the great-grandsons</a> of <a href="Genghis%20Khan">Genghis Khan</a>, making this Byzantine ruler an <a href="Affinity%20%28law%29">in-law with the Mongol ruler</a> in Beijing.
Within the <a href="Mongol%20Empire">Mongol Empire</a>, which <a href="Mongol%20conquest%20of%20the%20Song%20dynasty">eventually included all of China</a>, there were enough Westerners travelling there that in 1340 AD <a href="Francesco%20Balducci%20Pegolotti">Francesco Balducci Pegolotti</a> compiled a <a href="guide%20book">guide book</a> for fellow merchants on how to exchange silver for <a href="paper%20money">paper money</a> to purchase silk <a href="History%20of%20Beijing">in Khanbaliq (Beijing)</a>. By this stage the Eastern Roman Empire, temporarily dismantled by the <a href="Latin%20Empire">Latin Empire</a>, had shrunk to the size of a rump state in <a href="Byzantine%20Greece">parts of Greece</a> and <a href="Byzantine%20Anatolia">Anatolia</a>. <a href="Ma%20Duanlin">Ma Duanlin</a>, author of the "Wenxian Tongkao", noted the shifting political boundaries, albeit based on generally inaccurate and distorted <a href="political%20geography">political geography</a>. He wrote that historians of the Tang Dynasty considered "Daqin" and "Fulin" to be the same country, but he had his reservations about this due to discrepancies in geographical accounts and other concerns (<a href="Wade%E2%80%93Giles">Wade–Giles</a> spelling):

The "<a href="History%20of%20Ming">History of Ming</a>" expounds how the <a href="Hongwu%20Emperor">Hongwu Emperor</a>, founder of the <a href="Ming%20dynasty">Ming dynasty</a> (1368–1644 AD), sent a merchant of Fulin named "Nieh-ku-lun" () back to his native country with a letter announcing the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Ming%20dynasty">founding of the Ming dynasty</a>. It is speculated that the merchant was a <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Beijing">former archbishop</a> of <a href="History%20of%20Beijing">Khanbaliq</a> called Nicolaus de Bentra (who succeeded <a href="John%20of%20Montecorvino">John of Montecorvino</a> for that position). The "History of Ming" goes on to explain that contacts between China and Fulin ceased after this point and an envoy of the great western sea (the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>) did not appear in China again until the 16th century AD, with the 1582 AD arrival of the Italian <a href="Jesuit%20China%20missions">Jesuit missionary</a> <a href="Matteo%20Ricci">Matteo Ricci</a> in Portuguese <a href="Macau">Macau</a>.

Direct trade links between the Mediterranean lands and India had been established in the late 2nd century BC by the Hellenistic <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic Kingdom</a> of Egypt. Greek navigators learned to use the regular pattern of the <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a> winds for their trade voyages in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. The lively sea trade in Roman times is confirmed by the excavation of large deposits of Roman coins along much of the coast of India. Many trading ports with links to Roman communities have been <a href="Indo-Roman%20trade%20relations">identified in India</a> and Sri Lanka along the route used by the Roman mission. Archaeological evidence stretching from the Red Sea ports of <a href="Roman%20Egypt">Roman Egypt</a> to India suggests that <a href="Roman%20commerce">Roman commercial</a> activity in the Indian Ocean and <a href="History%20of%20Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> declined heavily with the <a href="Antonine%20Plague">Antonine Plague</a> of 166 AD, the same year as the first Roman embassy to Han China, where similar plague outbreaks had occurred from 151 AD.

High-quality <a href="glass">glass</a> from Roman manufacturers in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> and Syria was exported to many parts of Asia, including Han China. The first <a href="Roman%20glass">Roman glass</a>ware discovered in China is a blue soda-lime glass bowl dating to the early 1st century BC and excavated from a Western Han tomb in the southern port city of <a href="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>, which may have come there via the Indian Ocean and <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a>. Other Roman glass items include a mosaic-glass bowl found in a prince's tomb near <a href="Nanjing">Nanjing</a> dated to 67 AD and a glass bottle with opaque white streaks found in an <a href="Eastern%20Han">Eastern Han</a> tomb of <a href="Luoyang">Luoyang</a>. Roman and Persian glassware has been found in a 5th-century AD tomb of <a href="Gyeongju">Gyeongju</a>, Korea, capital of ancient <a href="Silla">Silla</a>, east of China. Roman glass beads have been discovered as far as Japan, within the 5th-century AD <a href="Kofun%20period">Kofun-era</a> Utsukushi burial mound near <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>.

From Chinese sources it is known that other Roman luxury items were esteemed by the Chinese. These include gold-embroidered <a href="carpet">rugs</a> and gold-coloured cloth, <a href="amber">amber</a>, <a href="asbestos">asbestos</a> cloth, and <a href="sea%20silk">sea silk</a>, which was a cloth made from the silk-like hairs of a Mediterranean shell-fish, the "<a href="Pinna%20nobilis">Pinna nobilis</a>". As well as silver and bronze items found throughout China dated to the 3rd–2nd centuries BC and perhaps originating from the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a>, there is also a Roman <a href="gilded">gilded</a> silver plate dated to the 2nd–3rd centuries AD and found in <a href="Jingyuan%20County%2C%20Gansu">Jingyuan County, Gansu</a>, with a raised <a href="relief">relief</a> image in the centre depicting the Greco-Roman god <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a> resting on a feline creature.

A maritime route opened up with the Chinese-controlled port of <a href="Rinan">Rinan</a> in Jiaozhi (centred in modern Vietnam) and the <a href="Khmer%20people">Khmer</a> kingdom of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Funan">Funan</a> by the 2nd century AD, if not earlier. Jiaozhi was proposed by <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Richthofen">Ferdinand von Richthofen</a> in 1877 to have been the port known to the Greco-Roman geographer <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> as <a href="Cattigara">Cattigara</a>, situated near modern <a href="Hanoi">Hanoi</a>. <a href="Geography%20%28Ptolemy%29">Ptolemy wrote</a> that Cattigara lay beyond the <a href="Golden%20Chersonese">Golden Chersonese</a> (the <a href="Malay%20Peninsula">Malay Peninsula</a>) and was visited by a Greek sailor named Alexander, most likely a merchant. Richthofen's identification of Cattigara as Hanoi was widely accepted until archaeological discoveries at <a href="%C3%93c%20Eo">Óc Eo</a> (near <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City">Ho Chi Minh City</a>) in the <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a> during the mid-20th century suggested this may have been its location. Granville Allen Mawer states that Ptolemy's Cattigara seems to correspond with the latitude of modern Óc Eo, where Roman goods and native jewellery imitating <a href="Antonine">Antonine</a> Roman coins have been found. At Óc Eo, which was once located along the coastline, Roman coins were among the vestiges of long-distance trade discovered by the French archaeologist <a href="Louis%20Malleret">Louis Malleret</a> in the 1940s. These include Roman golden <a href="medal">medal</a>lions from the reigns of <a href="Antoninus%20Pius">Antoninus Pius</a> and his successor Marcus Aurelius. Ancient Roman glass beads and bracelets were also found at the site.

The trade connection from Cattigara extended, via ports on the coasts of India and Sri Lanka, all the way to Roman-controlled ports in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> and the <a href="Nabataean">Nabataean</a> territories on the north-eastern coast of the Red Sea. The archaeologist Warwick Ball does not consider discoveries such as the Roman and Roman-inspired goods at Óc Eo, a coin of Roman emperor <a href="Maximian">Maximian</a> found in <a href="Tonkin">Tonkin</a>, and a Roman bronze lamp at P'ong Tuk in the Mekong Delta, to be conclusive proof that Romans visited these areas and suggests that the items could have been introduced by Indian merchants. While observing that the Romans had a recognised trading port in Southeast Asia, Dougald O'Reilly writes that there is little evidence to suggest Cattigara was Óc Eo. He argues that the Roman items found there only indicate that the Indian Ocean trade network extended to the ancient Kingdom of Funan.

<a href="Roman%20commerce">Chinese trade with the Roman Empire</a>, confirmed by the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> desire for silk, started in the 1st century BC. The Romans knew of <a href="wild%20silk">wild silk</a> harvested on <a href="Kos">Cos</a> ("<a href="coa%20vestis">coa vestis</a>"), but they did not at first make the connection with the silk that was produced in the <a href="Pamir%20Mountains">Pamir</a> <a href="Sarikol%20kingdom">Sarikol kingdom</a>. There were few direct trade contacts between Romans and Han Chinese, as the rival Parthians and Kushans were each protecting their lucrative role as trade intermediaries.

During the 1st century BC silk was still a rare commodity in the Roman world; by the 1st century AD this valuable trade item became much more widely available. In his "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Natural History</a>" (77–79 AD), <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> lamented the financial drain of coin from the <a href="Roman%20economy">Roman economy</a> to purchase this expensive luxury. He remarked that Rome's "womankind" and the purchase of luxury goods from India, Arabia, and the Seres of the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a> cost the empire roughly 100 million <a href="sesterces">sesterces</a> per year, and claimed that journeys were made to the Seres to acquire silk cloth along with <a href="pearl%20diving">pearl diving</a> in the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>. Despite the claims by Pliny the Elder about the trade imbalance and quantity of Rome's coinage used to purchase silk, Warwick Ball asserts that the Roman purchase of other foreign commodities, particularly <a href="spice%20trade">spices from India</a>, had a much greater impact on the Roman economy. In 14 AD the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Senate</a> issued an edict prohibiting the wearing of silk by men, but it continued to flow unabated into the Roman world. Beyond the economic concerns that the import of silk caused a huge outflow of wealth, silk clothes were also considered to be decadent and immoral by <a href="Seneca%20the%20Elder">Seneca the Elder</a>:

Trade items such as spice and silk had to be paid for with Roman gold coinage. There was some demand in China for Roman glass; the Han Chinese also produced glass in certain locations. Chinese-produced glassware date back to the Western Han era (202 BC – 9 AD). In dealing with foreign states such as the Parthian Empire, the Han Chinese were perhaps more concerned with diplomatically outmaneuvering their chief enemies, the nomadic <a href="Xiongnu">Xiongnu</a>, than with establishing trade, since mercantile pursuits and the <a href="Four%20occupations">merchant class</a> were frowned upon by the <a href="Scholar-official">gentry</a> who <a href="Government%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">dominated the Han government</a>.

Shortly after the <a href="smuggling%20of%20silkworm%20eggs%20into%20the%20Byzantine%20Empire">smuggling of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire</a> from China by <a href="Nestorian%20Christian">Nestorian Christian</a> monks, the 6th-century AD Byzantine historian <a href="Menander%20Protector">Menander Protector</a> wrote of how the Sogdians attempted to establish a direct trade of Chinese silk with the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. After forming an alliance with the Sasanian Persian ruler <a href="Khosrow%20I">Khosrow I</a> to defeat the <a href="Hephthalite%20Empire">Hephthalite Empire</a>, <a href="Ist%C3%A4mi">Istämi</a>, the <a href="G%C3%B6kt%C3%BCrk">Göktürk</a> ruler of the <a href="Turkic%20Khaganate">Turkic Khaganate</a>, was approached by Sogdian merchants requesting permission to seek an audience with the Sasanian king of kings for the privilege of travelling through Persian territories to trade with the Byzantines. Istämi refused the first request, but when he sanctioned the second one and had the Sogdian embassy sent to the Sasanian king, the latter had the members of the embassy killed by poison. Maniakh, a Sogdian diplomat, convinced Istämi to send an embassy directly to Byzantium's capital <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, which arrived in 568 AD and offered not only silk as a gift to Byzantine ruler <a href="Justin%20II">Justin II</a>, but also an alliance against Sasanian Persia. Justin II agreed and sent an embassy under <a href="Zemarchus">Zemarchus</a> to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct silk trade desired by the Sogdians.

The small number of <a href="Roman%20currency">Roman</a> and <a href="Byzantine%20coinage">Byzantine coins</a> found during excavations of Central Asian and Chinese archaeological sites from this era suggests that direct trade with the Sogdians remained limited. This was despite the fact that ancient Romans imported Han Chinese silk, and discoveries in contemporary tombs indicate that the <a href="Economy%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">Han-dynasty Chinese</a> imported Roman glassware. <a href="Valerie%20Hansen">Valerie Hansen</a> wrote in 2012 that no Roman coins from the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a> (507–27 BC) or the <a href="Principate">Principate</a> (27 BC – 284 AD) era of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> have been found in China. <a href="Warwick%20Ball">Warwick Ball</a> (2016) highlights a discovery at <a href="Xi%27an">Xi'an</a>, China (the site of the Han capital <a href="Chang%27an">Chang'an</a>) where a hoard of sixteen Roman coins from the reigns of <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius</a> (14–37 AD) to <a href="Aurelian">Aurelian</a> (270–275 AD) have been discovered. The Roman coins found at Óc Eo, Vietnam, near Chinese-controlled <a href="Jiaozhou%20%28region%29">Jiaozhou</a>, date to the mid-2nd century AD. A coin of Maximian (r. 286–305 AD) was also discovered in <a href="Tonkin">Tonkin</a>. Roman coins of the 3rd and 4th centuries AD have been discovered in Japan; they were unearthed from <a href="Katsuren%20Castle">Katsuren Castle</a> (in <a href="Uruma%2C%20Okinawa">Uruma, Okinawa</a>), which was built from the 12th to 15th centuries AD.

The earliest gold <a href="Solidus%20%28coin%29">"solidus" coins</a> from the Eastern Roman Empire found in China date to the reign of Byzantine emperor <a href="Theodosius%20II">Theodosius II</a> (r. 408–450 AD) and altogether only forty-eight of them have been found (compared to 1300 silver coins) in <a href="Xinjiang">Xinjiang</a> and the rest of China. The use of silver coins in <a href="Turfan">Turfan</a> persisted long after the <a href="Tang%20campaign%20against%20Karakhoja">Tang campaign against Karakhoja</a> and Chinese conquest of 640 AD, with a gradual adoption of <a href="Ancient%20Chinese%20coinage">Chinese bronze coinage</a> during the 7th century AD. Hansen maintains that these Eastern Roman coins were almost always found with <a href="Monetary%20history%20of%20Iran">Sasanian Persian silver coins</a> and Eastern Roman gold coins were used more as ceremonial objects like <a href="talisman">talisman</a>s, confirming the pre-eminence of <a href="Greater%20Iran">Greater Iran</a> in Chinese Silk Road commerce of Central Asia compared to Eastern Rome. <a href="Walter%20Scheidel">Walter Scheidel</a> remarks that the Chinese viewed Byzantine coins as pieces of exotic jewellery, preferring to use bronze coinage in the <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang</a> and <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song</a> dynasties, as well as <a href="Banknote">paper money</a> during the Song and Ming periods, even while silver <a href="bullion">bullion</a> was plentiful. Ball writes that the scarcity of Roman and Byzantine coins in China, and the greater amounts found in India, suggest that most Chinese silk purchased by the Romans was from maritime India, largely bypassing the overland <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> trade through Iran. Chinese coins from the <a href="Sui%20dynasty">Sui</a> and Tang dynasties (6th–10th centuries AD) have been discovered in India; significantly larger amounts are dated to the Song period (11th–13th centuries AD), particularly in the territories of the contemporary <a href="Chola%20dynasty">Chola dynasty</a>.

Even with the Byzantine production of silk starting in the 6th century AD, Chinese varieties were still considered to be of higher quality. This theory is supported by the discovery of a Byzantine "solidus" minted during the reign of <a href="Justin%20II">Justin II</a> found in a Sui-dynasty tomb of <a href="Shanxi">Shanxi</a> province in 1953, among other Byzantine coins found at various sites. Chinese histories offer descriptions of Roman and Byzantine coins. The "<a href="Weil%C3%BCe">Weilüe</a>", "Book of the Later Han", "<a href="Book%20of%20Jin">Book of Jin</a>", as well as the later "<a href="Wenxian%20Tongkao">Wenxian Tongkao</a>" noted how ten ancient Roman silver coins were worth one Roman gold coin. The Roman golden "<a href="aureus">aureus</a>" was worth about twenty-five silver "<a href="denarius">denarii</a>". During the later Byzantine Empire, twelve silver "<a href="miliaresion">miliaresion</a>" was equal to one gold "<a href="nomisma">nomisma</a>". The "<a href="History%20of%20Song">History of Song</a>" notes that the Byzantines made coins of either silver or gold, <a href="Ancient%20Chinese%20coinage%23early%20round%20coins">without holes in the middle</a>, with an inscription of the king's name. It also asserts that the Byzantines forbade the production of counterfeit coins.

In 2010, <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> was used to identify that a partial skeleton found in a Roman grave from the 1st or 2nd century AD in Vagnari, Italy, had <a href="East%20Asian">East Asian</a> ancestry on his mother's side.

A 2016 analysis of archaeological finds from <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a> in London, the site of the ancient Roman city <a href="Londinium">Londinium</a> in <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman Britain</a>, suggests that two or three skeletons from a sample of twenty-two dating to the 2nd to the 4th centuries AD are of Asian ancestry, and possibly of Chinese descent. The assertion is based on forensics and the analysis of skeletal facial features. The discovery has been presented by Dr Rebecca Redfern, curator of human <a href="osteology">osteology</a> at the <a href="Museum%20of%20London">Museum of London</a>. No DNA analysis has yet been done, the skull and tooth samples available offer only fragmentary pieces of evidence, and the samples that were used were compared with the morphology of modern populations, not ancient ones.

The historian <a href="Homer%20H.%20Dubs">Homer H. Dubs</a> speculated in 1941 that Roman prisoners of war who were transferred to the eastern border of the Parthian empire might later have clashed with Han troops there.

After a Roman army under the command of <a href="Marcus%20Licinius%20Crassus">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a> decisively lost the <a href="battle%20of%20Carrhae">battle of Carrhae</a> in 54 BC, an estimated 10,000 Roman prisoners were dispatched by the Parthians to <a href="Margiana">Margiana</a> to man the frontier. Some time later the nomadic <a href="Xiongnu">Xiongnu</a> chief <a href="Zhizhi">Zhizhi</a> established a state further east in the <a href="Talas%20River">Talas valley</a>, near modern-day <a href="Taraz">Taraz</a>. Dubs points to a Chinese account by <a href="Ban%20Gu">Ban Gu</a> of about "a hundred men" under the command of Zhizhi who fought in a so-called "fish-scale formation" to defend Zhizhi's wooden-palisade fortress against <a href="Han%20Dynasty">Han</a> forces, in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Zhizhi">Battle of Zhizhi</a> in 36 BC. He claimed that this might have been the Roman <a href="testudo%20formation">testudo formation</a> and that these men, who were captured by the Chinese, founded the <a href="Liqian%20village">village of Liqian</a> (Li-chien, possibly from "legio") in <a href="Yongchang%20County">Yongchang County</a>.

There have been attempts to promote the Sino-Roman connection for tourism, but Dubs' synthesis of Roman and Chinese sources has not found acceptance among historians, on the grounds that it is highly speculative and reaches too many conclusions without sufficient hard evidence. <a href="Genealogical%20DNA%20test">DNA testing</a> in 2005 confirmed the <a href="Proto-Indo-Europeans">Indo-European</a> ancestry of a few inhabitants of modern Liqian; this could be explained by transethnic marriages with Indo-European people known to have lived in Gansu in ancient times, such as the <a href="Yuezhi">Yuezhi</a> and <a href="Wusun">Wusun</a>. A much more comprehensive DNA analysis of more than two hundred male residents of the village in 2007 showed close genetic relation to the <a href="Han%20Chinese">Han Chinese</a> populace and great deviation from the <a href="Western%20Eurasian">Western Eurasian</a> gene pool. The researchers conclude that the people of Liqian are probably of Han Chinese origin. The area lacks archaeological evidence of a Roman presence.

God of War (2005 video game)

God of War is a <a href="Third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person</a> <a href="hack%20and%20slash">hack and slash</a> <a href="Action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> video game developed by <a href="SCE%20Santa%20Monica%20Studio">Santa Monica Studio</a> and published by <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a> (SCE). First released on March 22, 2005, for the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> (PS2) console, it is the first installment in the <a href="God%20of%20War%20%28franchise%29">series of the same name</a> and the third chronologically. Loosely based on <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, it is set in <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a> with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist <a href="Kratos%20%28God%20of%20War%29">Kratos</a>, a <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>n warrior who serves the <a href="Twelve%20Olympians">Olympian Gods</a>. The goddess <a href="Athena">Athena</a> tasks Kratos with killing <a href="Ares">Ares</a>, the God of War and Kratos' former mentor who tricked Kratos into killing his wife and daughter. As Ares besieges <a href="Classical%20Athens">Athens</a> out of hatred for Athena, Kratos embarks on a quest to find the one object capable of stopping the god once and for all: <a href="Pandora%27s%20Box">Pandora's Box</a>.

The <a href="gameplay">gameplay</a> of "God of War" focuses on <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combo-based</a> combat, achieved through the player's main weapon—the Blades of Chaos—and a secondary weapon acquired later in the game. It features <a href="quick%20time%20event">quick time event</a>s that require the player to complete various game controller actions in a timed sequence to defeat stronger enemies and <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">bosses</a>. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options. It also features <a href="puzzle%20video%20game">puzzles</a> and <a href="platform%20game">platforming</a> elements.

"God of War" sold more than 4.6 million copies worldwide, making it the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20PlayStation%202%20video%20games">eleventh best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time</a>. Regarded as one of the best action-adventure games for the platform, it won several "Game of the Year" awards. In 2009, entertainment website <a href="IGN">IGN</a> named "God of War" the seventh-best PlayStation 2 game of all time. It has been highly praised for its graphics, sound, story, and gameplay and has been hailed as one of the <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best">greatest video games ever made</a>. Success of the game led to the development of seven more games and expansion into other media. The game and its first sequel, "<a href="God%20of%20War%20II">God of War II</a>", were remastered and released in November 2009 as part of the "<a href="God%20of%20War%20video%20game%20collections%23God%20of%20War%20Collection">God of War Collection</a>", and in 2012, the remastered version was re-released as part of the "<a href="God%20of%20War%20video%20game%20collections%23God%20of%20War%20Saga">God of War Saga</a>", both for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> (PS3). A <a href="novelization">novelization</a> of the game was published in May 2010 and a <a href="film%20adaptation">film adaptation</a> has been in development since 2005.

"God of War" is a <a href="Third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person</a> <a href="single-player%20video%20game">single player</a> <a href="action-adventure">action-adventure</a> video game with <a href="hack%20and%20slash">hack and slash</a> elements, viewed from a <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system%23Fixed">fixed camera</a> perspective. The player controls the character Kratos in <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combo-based combat</a>, <a href="Platform%20game">platforming</a>, and <a href="Puzzle%20video%20game">puzzle game</a> elements, and battles <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythological</a> foes that include undead soldiers, <a href="harpies">harpies</a>, <a href="minotaurs">minotaurs</a>, <a href="Medusa">Medusa</a> and the <a href="Gorgons">Gorgons</a>, <a href="cyclops">cyclopes</a>, wraiths, <a href="Siren%20%28mythology%29">Sirens</a>, <a href="satyr">satyr</a>s, <a href="centaur">centaur</a>s, <a href="cerberus">cerberus</a>es, and <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss</a> opponents—the <a href="Lernaean%20Hydra">Hydra</a> and a giant minotaur known as Pandora's Guardian. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, swing on ropes, and balance across <a href="Beam%20%28structure%29">beams</a> to proceed through sections of the game. Some puzzles are simple, such as moving a box so that the player can use it as a jumping-off point to access a pathway unreachable with normal jumping, but others are more complex, such as finding several items across different areas of the game to unlock one door.

Throughout the game world, the player finds green, red, and blue <a href="Treasure%20chest%20%28video%20games%29">chests</a> that contain <a href="Power-up">orbs</a> of the corresponding color. Green orbs replenish the player's <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">health</a>, blue orbs replenish <a href="Magic%20point">magic</a>, and red orbs provide <a href="Experience%20point">experience</a> for upgrading weapons and magic and replenish the Rage meter, which, if full, allows for the usage of the Rage of the Gods ability. Red orbs are also collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects. The player can also find Gorgon Eyes and <a href="Phoenix%20%28mythology%29">Phoenix</a> Feathers that increase the length of the Health and Magic Meters, respectively.

Kratos' main weapon is the Blades of Chaos: a pair of <a href="blade">blade</a>s attached to <a href="Chain%20weapon">chains</a> wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung in various maneuvers. Later in the game, Kratos acquires a secondary weapon called the Blade of Artemis: a large sword that offers alternative combat options. Kratos also learns to use four <a href="Magic%20%28gaming%29">magical</a> abilities (like Zeus' Fury, which allows him to throw lightning bolts at distant targets) which allow him to kill individual and multiple targets. Other magical abilities include Medusa's Gaze, Poseidon's Rage, and Army of Hades. A relic called Poseidon's Trident allows Kratos to breathe underwater and navigate through this environment. Early in the game, Kratos acquires a <a href="Superpower%20%28ability%29">special ability</a> called Rage of the Gods, which provides temporary invulnerability and increased attack damage.

In combat, a <a href="quick%20time%20event">quick time event</a> (QTE) is initiated when the player has weakened a strong foe. The player performs a sequence of actions on the <a href="game%20controller">game controller</a> shortly after an image of its circle button appears as an on-screen prompt. This allows for limited control of Kratos during a QTE cinematic sequence, which, if successful, ends the battle; failure usually results in damaging Kratos. Similar in function is a quick time sex <a href="mini-game">mini-game</a> that occurs when Kratos encounters female twins; this became a regular feature throughout the series until "" (2010).

When the game is completed, a challenge mode—ten trials called the Challenge of the Gods—is <a href="Unlockable%20%28gaming%29">unlocked</a>; this requires players to complete a series of specific tasks. The player may unlock bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and <a href="concept%20art">concept art</a> of the characters and environments, as rewards. Completion of each difficulty level unlocks additional rewards.

"God of War" is set in an alternate version of <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a> populated by the <a href="Twelve%20Olympians">Olympian gods</a>, <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titans</a>, and other Greek mythological beings. With the exception of <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashbacks</a>, the events of the game are set between those of the games "" (2008) and "" (2010). There are six locations explored, including fictional versions of the real-world <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> and <a href="Classical%20Athens">Athens</a>, and fictional locations of the Desert of Lost Souls, the Temple of <a href="Pandora">Pandora</a>, the <a href="Greek%20underworld">Underworld</a>, and a brief scene on <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a>.

The Aegean Sea setting includes a mass of shipwrecked vessels. Athens is a war-torn city under assault by <a href="Ares">Ares</a>, the God of War; beyond the city is the Desert of Lost Souls, a vast and windy desert of ancient <a href="ruins">ruins</a>. The majority of the game occurs in Pandora’s Temple, which is chained to the back of the Titan <a href="Cronus">Cronos</a>, who crawls through the desert. The massive temple, constructed by the architect Pathos Verdes III, is filled with traps and monsters, and has three sections dedicated to the Titan <a href="Atlas%20%28mythology%29">Atlas</a> and gods <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> and <a href="Hades">Hades</a>, respectively. The Underworld is a fiery realm with spiked pillars full of souls and flaming versions of previously encountered enemies. Athens is the scene of the final battle before a denouement on Mount Olympus in the God of War's throne room.

The protagonist of the game is <a href="Kratos%20%28God%20of%20War%29">Kratos</a> (voiced by <a href="Terrence%20C.%20Carson">Terrence C. Carson</a>), a <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>n warrior who serves the Olympian Gods. Other characters include a host of Greek gods, such as <a href="Athena">Athena</a> (<a href="Carole%20Ruggier">Carole Ruggier</a>), the Goddess of Wisdom and Kratos' ally and mentor; Ares (<a href="Steven%20Blum">Steven Blum</a>), the God of War and main antagonist; Poseidon (<a href="Fred%20Tatasciore">Fred Tatasciore</a>), the God of the Sea; <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a> (Carole Ruggier), the Goddess of Love and Sexuality; <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> (<a href="Paul%20Eiding">Paul Eiding</a>), the King of the Gods; <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a> (<a href="Claudia%20Black">Claudia Black</a>), the Goddess of the Hunt; and Hades (<a href="Nolan%20North">Nolan North</a>), the God of the Underworld. Several of the gods aid Kratos with magic or weapons. Minor characters include the <a href="Oracle">Oracle</a> of Athens (<a href="Susan%20Blakeslee">Susan Blakeslee</a>), the gravedigger (Paul Eiding), the body burner (<a href="Christopher%20Corey%20Smith">Christopher Corey Smith</a>), and the boat captain (<a href="Keith%20Ferguson%20%28voice%20actor%29">Keith Ferguson</a>). Other characters appear in flashbacks, including Kratos' wife Lysandra (<a href="Gwendoline%20Yeo">Gwendoline Yeo</a>), his daughter Calliope, the <a href="Barbarian">Barbarian</a> King, and a Village Oracle (Susan Blakeslee). The game is narrated by <a href="Linda%20Hunt">Linda Hunt</a>.

Kratos is a warrior who serves the Greek gods of Olympus. Flashbacks reveal that he was once a successful captain in the Spartan army and led his men to several victories before being defeated by a barbarian king. Facing death, Kratos called on the God of War, Ares, whom he promised to serve if the god would spare his men and provide the power to destroy their enemies. Ares agreed and bonded the Blades of Chaos, a pair of chained blades forged in the depths of <a href="Tartarus">Tartarus</a>, to his new servant. Kratos, equipped with the blades, then decapitated the barbarian king.

Kratos waged war at the behest of Ares, eventually leading an attack on a village occupied by worshipers of Athena. Unknown to Kratos, Ares had secretly transported Kratos' wife and daughter to the village; during his frenzied attack on its temple, Kratos accidentally killed them. Although Ares believed this act would free Kratos to become the perfect warrior, the Spartan instead renounced his pledge of servitude to the god. The oracle of the destroyed village cursed Kratos by bonding the ashes of his dead family to his skin, turning it ash-white and earning him the nickname, "Ghost of Sparta". Plagued by nightmares of his horrible deed, Kratos vowed to serve the other gods in hope of ridding himself of the visions.

When the game starts, Kratos has been serving the gods for ten years. He kills the Hydra on behalf of Poseidon, but he has grown tired of his service and suffering. He summons Athena, who states that if Kratos performs one final act—the murder of Ares—he will be forgiven for killing his family. Ares is waging war on the city of Athens out of hatred and jealousy of his sister Athena, who assigns Kratos to destroy Ares because Zeus has forbidden divine intervention. Athena guides Kratos to the war-torn Athens. After a strange encounter with a gravedigger who encourages him to continue his task, Kratos battles his way to Athens's oracle, finds her, and learns that the only way to defeat Ares is with <a href="Pandora%27s%20Box">Pandora's Box</a>, a mythical artifact that grants the power to kill a god.

Kratos enters the Desert of Lost Souls, and Athena tells him Pandora's Box is hidden in a temple chained to the back of the Titan Cronos—a punishment by Zeus for Cronos' role in the <a href="Titanomachy">Great War</a>. Kratos summons Cronos, climbs for three days before reaching the Temple entrance, overcomes an array of deadly traps and an army of monsters, and eventually finds the Box. But Ares, aware of his former servant's success, kills Kratos as he is leaving the Temple. While harpies take the Box to Ares, Kratos falls into the Underworld. He battles his way through the fiery realm, and with help from the mysterious gravedigger, who tells him Athena is not the only god watching over him, he escapes and returns to Athens.

Kratos recovers Pandora's Box from Ares, opens it, and uses its power to become godlike. Despite Ares' best efforts to destroy Kratos physically and mentally, including stripping him of the Blades of Chaos and all magic, he survives and kills Ares with the Blade of the Gods. Athens is saved, and Athena tells Kratos that although his sins are forgiven, the gods cannot erase his nightmares. Forsaken by the gods, he tries to commit suicide by casting himself into the Aegean Sea, but Athena intervenes and transports him to Mount Olympus. As a reward for his services to the gods, she provides Kratos with a new set of blades and the seat as the new God of War.

<a href="SCE%20Santa%20Monica%20Studio">Santa Monica</a> began development of "God of War" in 2002, under the working title "Dark Odyssey", and unveiled it two years later at <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment%20of%20America">SCEA</a> Santa Monica Gamers' Day 2004. In a meeting with <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> at the <a href="E3%202004">2004</a> <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3), the developers said there would be 15 to 25 different attacks with the player's main weapon in the final game, with a free-form combo system that would allow players to combine moves in almost any order. GameSpot said the developers described the gameplay "as merging the action of "<a href="Devil%20May%20Cry">Devil May Cry</a>" with the puzzle-solving of "<a href="Ico">Ico</a>"" and noted that players would be able to "sunder enemies with a single move, such as by ripping them in half".

Game Director and creator <a href="David%20Jaffe">David Jaffe</a> confirmed the game would be a cinematic presentation. He said that at E3, they got to see where players were having issues with the camera system and said, "we are doing extensive focus tests, and using data compiled from E3, to find and fix the problem areas" of the cameras. He said he had the confidence that the team would fix the problems before the game's release. However, he said if players "hate cinematic camera systems, nothing we can do will help you like the "God of War" cameras". The game uses Santa Monica's <a href="Kinetica%20%28game%20engine%29">Kinetica</a> engine, which they developed for their previous game, "<a href="Kinetica">Kinetica</a>" (2001).

Although the game is based on Greek mythology, the development team gave themselves "lots of freedom" to modify the myths, and Jaffe said they took the "coolest aspects of the subject" and wrote a story using those elements. In an interview for "<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>", he said while the idea for "God of War" was his own, the concept owed a debt to <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a> because he had played "<a href="Onimusha">Onimusha</a>" and said "let's do that with Greek Mythology". He was inspired in part by the 1981 <a href="feature%20film">feature film</a>, "<a href="Clash%20of%20the%20Titans%20%281981%20film%29">Clash of the Titans</a>", saying, "the real high concept for me was ... merging it with "<a href="Heavy%20Metal%20%28magazine%29">Heavy Metal</a>" magazine". He said he liked both "the kids stuff ... with Greek Mythology" and the idea of adding more adult themes such as sex and violence.

After E3 2004, Jaffe told <a href="IGN">IGN</a> that the creative team's goal was to "make the player feel brutal, letting their inner beast free and just going nuts". He said the game's combat system would have an unparalleled degree of freedom. The team designed two systems of combat: a "macro" system, which gives players the choice between normal combat, magical attacks, or using the QTE feature to kill a foe; and a "micro" system, where players press a sequence of buttons to perform different attacks. Puzzles were implemented, including self-contained ones that incorporate up to three rooms of the game, and global puzzles that spread across four or five areas. Jaffe compared the game to the popular "<a href="Prince%20of%20Persia">Prince of Persia</a>" series—which also incorporates puzzle and platforming elements—and said that while each puzzle in that series is a slight variation of the last, "each puzzle in "God of War" is its own beast".

Frank Cifaldi of <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> covered a speech by Jaffe on the development of "God of War" at the 2006 <a href="D.I.C.E.%20Summit">D.I.C.E. Summit</a> in Las Vegas. Cifaldi said ""God of War" was a rare opportunity for a game designer" because Sony gave Jaffe nearly complete creative control to develop a game on his terms with a substantial budget. He stated that Jaffe wanted to make the game "out of passion, not fear, and that it would be a game that [Jaffe] himself, as a game player, would want to play". Jaffe said the 1981 film "<a href="Raiders%20of%20the%20Lost%20Ark">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>" also inspired the development of "God of War"; he wanted to make players feel like he felt as a child watching that film, but did not want to put the player in the role of an adventurer, referencing "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>" games. He elaborated that "God of War" was designed to be simplistic and forward-moving, but the game "is not innovative or unique, and that's intentional". Jaffe said that their system was shallow and "it forced the team to constantly create new content to trapeze the player from one area of interest to the next". He said he understood modular game design—the need to have great looking, high-detail levels without having to build and texture every minuscule piece of the environment—but "[he] was going to get bored" if they did not step outside of those boundaries.

The <a href="Game%20demo">demo</a> of "God of War", entitled "God of War: The Hydra Battle", was released on January 1, 2005. It featured Kratos battling various opponents and ended with a portion of the Hydra battle that opens the main game. The game was released on March 22 in North America, July 8 in the United Kingdom, and November 17 in Japan. By the end of July, it was the sixth-best-selling game of 2005 up to that point. In 2006, it became available in the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> lineup of <a href="List%20of%20Sony%20Greatest%20Hits%20games">Greatest Hits</a>. By July 2006, the game had sold 1 million copies and earned $43 million in the United States alone. "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" ranked it as the 50th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a>, or <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. In June 2012, Sony reported that the game sold more than 4.6 million copies worldwide.

The game and its sequel, "<a href="God%20of%20War%20II">God of War II</a>", were released in North America on November 17, 2009, as part of the "<a href="God%20of%20War%20video%20game%20collections%23God%20of%20War%20Collection">God of War Collection</a>", featuring remastered <a href="porting">ports</a> of both games for the PlayStation 3 platform, with <a href="video%20scaler">upscaled</a> graphics and support for <a href="PlayStation%203%20Trophies">PlayStation 3 Trophies</a>. It became available in Japan on March 18, 2010, Australia on April 29, and the UK on April 30. The "God of War Collection" was released as a digital download on the <a href="PlayStation%20Store">PlayStation Store</a> on November 2, 2010, and was the first product containing PlayStation 2 software available via download. <a href="PlayStation%20Plus">PlayStation Plus</a> subscribers can download a one-hour trial of each game. By June 2012, "God of War Collection" had sold more than 2.4 million copies worldwide. A <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a> version of "God of War Collection" was released on May 6, 2014. On August 28, 2012, "God of War Collection", "<a href="God%20of%20War%20III">God of War III</a>", and "" were included in the "<a href="God%20of%20War%20video%20game%20collections%23God%20of%20War%20Saga">God of War Saga</a>", under Sony's line of PlayStation Collections for the PlayStation 3 in North America.

"God of War: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game", composed by <a href="Gerard%20Marino">Gerard K. Marino</a>, <a href="Ron%20Fish">Ron Fish</a>, <a href="Winifred%20Phillips">Winifred Phillips</a>, <a href="Mike%20Reagan">Mike Reagan</a>, <a href="Cris%20Velasco">Cris Velasco</a>, <a href="Winnie%20Waldron">Winnie Waldron</a>, and Marcello De Francisci, was released on <a href="Compact%20Disc">CD</a> by Sony Computer Entertainment as an exclusive product for the <a href="Sony%20Connect">Sony Connect Music Store</a> on March 1, 2005. The soundtrack was also made available for free to customers who purchased the game via a voucher code included with the game. Several of the tracks feature voice-over passages from the video game. Dave Valentine of Square Enix Music Online rated it 8 out of 10 and praised the composers for avoiding the production of "a neverending dullness of action themes". He complimented the soundtrack for having "a large number of well-developed orchestral themes, with a noticeable creative use of ancient and ethnic instrumentation". Spence D. of IGN gave the soundtrack 6.9 out of 10 and also praised the use of ancient and ethnic instrumentation, but criticized the uneven transitions between tracks. In March 2010, the soundtrack was released as <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> as part of the "God of War Trilogy Soundtrack" in the "<a href="God%20of%20War%20III">God of War III Ultimate Edition</a>".

"God of War" received "universal acclaim" according to <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> with a score of 94 out of 100, and a score of 93.58% from <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a>. Tom Lane of <a href="CNN">CNN</a> wrote, ""God of War" is the type of game that makes you remember why you play games in the first place." He said it is addictive and the action is balanced with a modest amount of puzzle and platforming elements. He praised how quickly it progresses and said it "is one of the most violent [games] on the market".

Raymond Padilla of <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> said the gameplay is "excellent" and it has "some of the goriest, most exaggerated, and over-the-top violence I've ever seen". He praised the combo system for being generous, with players easily able to execute attack combinations, but added that it can challenge players who "throw themselves into the system". Chris Sell of <a href="PAL%20Gaming%20Network">PAL Gaming Network</a> wrote that the most enjoyable aspect of the combat is its simplicity. He said the QTEs are "superbly enjoyable", "highly satisfying", and most entertaining during <a href="boss%20fight">boss fight</a>s. In regards to combining combat with platforming, Sell said, ""God of War" pulls it off perfectly."

Lane said the story is "compelling", while Sell stated that it is well laid out and rarely stalls. Padilla wrote, ""God of War" is the best thing to happen to Greek mythology" since <a href="Harry%20Hamlin">Harry Hamlin</a> played <a href="Perseus">Perseus</a> in "Clash of the Titans". He praised the sound as very strong, but felt that some of the voice acting and music tracks are overstated. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer said the audio is "a stunningly evocative example of a well-judged dramatic soundtrack and thunderous effects".

Sell stated that the graphics are "quite possibly the best on the PS2" and rival games on the Xbox. He said the character models are "excellent" and each level has its own distinctive feel. Eric Blattberg of <a href="PlayStation%20Universe">PlayStation Universe</a> praised the graphics for being seamless, realistic, and capable of being able to run at <a href="480p">480p</a> on a widescreen television. He said the textures are "great", and the environments are "stunning and unbelievably detailed." Mikel Reparaz of <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> noted the amount of detail, elaborating that as a consequence of the aging hardware of the PS2, "the graphics occasionally stutter or even slow down." He still gave the game a perfect score, concluding, "these problems are minor nits next to "God of War"s creative design, riveting plot and sheer balls-out fun. One of the best action titles on the PS2, "God of War" stands out as an ultraviolent masterpiece."

Sell said "God of War" has very few flaws and that the only one worth mentioning is the camera system: he said that although the cameras do a great job of following Kratos, "there are a fair few annoying moments when you're attacked by something off-screen, or you fail to make a jump because you couldn't really see the jump properly". Other minor complaints from Sell include its lack of <a href="Replay%20value">replayability</a>, the amount of time it takes to upgrade items, and the final fight with Ares, which he said is "a little disappointing". Reed wrote that in a few notable occasions, he found some of the platforming balancing acts "a little bothersome". He said players may be overwhelmed by the number of enemies, but they will eventually get their "brain and reactions in gear and move onto the next gripping section and feel hugely satisfied".

"God of War" won several "Game of the Year" awards. At the 2005 <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>, it was named "Best Action Game" and David Jaffe won "Designer of the Year" for the game. It was also a nominee for "Game of the Year", "Best Performance by a Human Male" (<a href="TC%20Carson">TC Carson</a> as Kratos), and "Best Original Score". At the 2006 <a href="Interactive%20Achievement%20Awards">Interactive Achievement Awards</a>, it won several awards, including "Overall Game of the Year", "Console Game of the Year", and "Action/Adventure Game of the Year". In 2009, IGN named "God of War" the seventh-best PlayStation 2 game of all time. In November 2012, "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>" magazine named "God of War" the eleventh-best PlayStation 2 game of all time.

An official novelization of the game, titled "God of War", was announced in July 2009, along with a novelization of "God of War II". It was written by <a href="Matthew%20Stover">Matthew Stover</a> and <a href="Robert%20E.%20Vardeman">Robert E. Vardeman</a>, and was published on May 25, 2010, by <a href="Del%20Rey%20Books">Del Rey Books</a>. In an interview for "<a href="Play%20%28UK%20magazine%29">Play</a>" magazine, Vardeman said a mythology book written in the 1930s got him interested in Greek mythology, and the chance to work on the "God of War" novel "was an opportunity not to be missed". He said giving the readers a solid plot foundation was necessary and the novel required extra material so that it did not simply follow the action of the game. Although he has not played the game, he said "God of War" was based on the traditional <a href="Edith%20Hamilton">Edith Hamilton</a> Greek mythology, essentially "the accepted mythology on steroids". Vardeman called Kratos a substantial character, continuing, "This conflict of motives makes him a great, if troubled, hero." He confirmed his work on the <a href="God%20of%20War%20II%23Novel">second "God of War" novel</a>, saying there are many potential story ideas for Kratos and that "it would be a shame" if there were not additional books to fill in the details of his quests, such as stories of the time while he was a minion of Ares or before he met the Barbarian King. "God of War" was nominated for the International Association of Tie-in Writers Scribe Award as best adapted novel in 2010.

The novel recounts the events of the game and offers deeper insights into its story, explaining that Athena wanted Kratos to kill Ares and explaining how she manipulated the other gods, with the exception of Zeus, into aiding Kratos. After learning of Athena's plans, Zeus decides to aid Kratos (with magic and as the gravedigger) with the intention of Kratos becoming the new God of War after killing Ares. Poseidon is persuaded by Athena when she convinces him that Ares brought the Hydra into his domain. Artemis is persuaded because Ares and his minions are destroying her wilderness and its wildlife, and by aiding Kratos she will prevent future destruction. Athena manipulates Aphrodite into believing that Medusa is plotting against her. Hades, however, is omitted from the book, as Kratos does not meet him or gain his magic. Another omission from the book is Kratos receiving a new set of blades from Athena, and the Blades of Chaos is revealed to have been forged by <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a> in Tartarus.

The god <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> is not in the game, but in the novel, he is responsible for informing Athena that Kratos is committing suicide. New characters include Coeus, the First Officer of Kratos' ship, and the two servants of Medusa: Jurr and a blind man. The twins encountered in the sex mini-game are revealed to be the daughters of Aphrodite named Zora and Lora. The book also explains how certain creatures of the mythology that were slain by <a href="Greek%20Heroic%20Age">heroes</a> are, apparently, still alive. For example, Zeus recollects that <a href="Hercules">Hercules</a> slew the Hydra, and Athena confirms this, but informs Zeus that the new Hydra is a newborn spawn of the Titans <a href="Typhon">Typhon</a> and <a href="Echidna%20%28mythology%29">Echidna</a>, and was released by Ares.

A film adaptation was announced in 2005. Jaffe confirmed that a script had been completed by <a href="David%20Self">David Self</a> and they were looking for a director. He confirmed that <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a> was committed to making the film, but he was unaware of its status, and later expressed doubt the film would be released. In September 2008, <a href="Brett%20Ratner">Brett Ratner</a> told <a href="UGO%20Networks">UGO</a> that he would direct the film, but in February 2009, it was revealed that he had left the project to direct "<a href="Tower%20Heist">Tower Heist</a>". In March 2010, Santa Monica confirmed that they have no creative control over the film. During the "God of War – Game Directors Live" documentary, filmed on September 1, 2010, Jaffe said the "script went out a year and a half ago to <a href="Daniel%20Craig">Daniel Craig</a>, who plays [James] Bond, but he turned it down". He indicated an actor had since signed on for the role of Kratos, and said, "this new person is pretty good, if that ends up true". In July 2012, "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" confirmed that the writers of "<a href="Pacific%20Rim%20%28film%29">Pacific Rim</a>", <a href="Patrick%20Melton">Patrick Melton</a> and <a href="Marcus%20Dunstan">Marcus Dunstan</a>, had been hired to adapt "God of War" into a film.

On August 30, 2012, Melton and Dunstan stated in an IGN interview that they were hired to rework Self's screenplay as they considered it outdated, being written before recent films in the same genre, such as "<a href="Clash%20of%20the%20Titans%20%282010%20film%29">Clash of the Titans</a>" (2010) and its sequel, "<a href="Wrath%20of%20the%20Titans">Wrath of the Titans</a>" (2012). The first step will be to apparently humanize Kratos, who will begin as a mortal and still have his family, with the pivotal change being the barbarian attack. Melton added, "We're going to learn about [Kratos] and understand how he operates. So it's potentially 30 minutes ... of building up this character so that, when he ... becomes the Ghost of Sparta, we understand him as a human and ... the journey that he's going to take." According to Dunstan, "with a bigger movie like "God of War", you have to go quite a bit deeper into the character as opposed to a horror film". Melton and Dunstan also have "big plans" for Ares. Melton said they are "trying to build [Ares] up a bit more ... so that he can become a true villain" beyond his raid of Athens.

In November 2012, the writers told GameSpot that "God of War" will "improve on films like "Clash of the Titans" and "<a href="Immortals%20%282011%20film%29">Immortals</a>" by taking a step in a bolder direction." Melton said that Sony has "encouraged" them to make it different from other films in the same genre. It was confirmed that <a href="Charles%20Roven">Charles Roven</a> and <a href="Alex%20Gartner">Alex Gartner</a>, who are producing the "<a href="Uncharted%23Film">Uncharted</a>" film, will be producing the movie via <a href="Atlas%20Entertainment">Atlas Entertainment</a>. In early 2013, ""s Game Director, Todd Papy, said he did not know the status of the film. The writer behind the "God of War" video games, <a href="Marianne%20Krawczyk">Marianne Krawczyk</a>, said her main worry with the movie adaptation is casting Kratos: "The player has a personal experience with him, and then he's going to be embodied by a different actor, he's going to have a different voice, he's going to say a lot more words. So I think it will be hard to get that across," but she is hopeful that it can be done. As of 25, 2019, the movie is without a director, no actors have been confirmed, a release date has not been set, but the script has been "turned in". It has a budget of $150 million <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>.

Bluebuck

The bluebuck (<a href="Afrikaans%20language">Afrikaans</a>: bloubok ) or blue antelope ("Hippotragus leucophaeus") is an <a href="extinct">extinct</a> <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="antelope">antelope</a> that lived in South Africa until around 1800. It is <a href="congener%20%28biology%29">congener</a>ic with the <a href="roan%20antelope">roan antelope</a> and <a href="sable%20antelope">sable antelope</a> (belonging in the genus "<a href="Hippotragus">Hippotragus</a>"), but was smaller than either. It was sometimes considered a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the roan antelope, but a genetic study has confirmed it as a distinct species.

The largest mounted bluebuck specimen is tall at the <a href="withers">withers</a>. Its <a href="Horn%20%28anatomy%29">horns</a> measure along the curve. The <a href="Coat%20%28animal%29">coat</a> was a uniform bluish-grey, with a pale whitish belly. The forehead was brown, darker than the face. Its mane was not as developed as in the roan and sable antelopes; its ears were shorter and blunter, not tipped with black; and it had a darker tail tuft and smaller teeth. It also lacked the contrasting black and white patterns seen on the heads of its relatives. The bluebuck was a <a href="grazing">grazer</a>, and may have calved where rainfall, and thus the availability of grasses, would peak. The bluebuck was confined to the southwestern <a href="Cape%20Peninsula">Cape</a> when encountered by Europeans, but fossil evidence and <a href="rock%20art">rock paintings</a> show that it originally had a larger distribution.

Europeans encountered the bluebuck in the 17th century, but it was already uncommon by then, perhaps due to its preferred grassland habitat having been reduced to a range, mainly along the southern coast of South Africa. Sea level changes during the early <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> may also have contributed to its decline by disrupting the population. The first published mention of the bluebuck is from 1681, and few descriptions of the animal were written while it existed. The few 18th-century illustrations appear to have been based on stuffed specimens. Hunted by European settlers, the bluebuck became extinct around 1800; it was the first large African <a href="mammal">mammal</a> to face extinction in historical times, followed by the <a href="quagga">quagga</a> in 1883. Only four mounted specimens remain, in museums in <a href="Leiden">Leiden</a>, <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, and <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, along with skulls and horns in various museums.

In 1776 the German zoologist <a href="Peter%20Simon%20Pallas">Peter Simon Pallas</a> formally <a href="Species%20description">described</a> the bluebuck as "Antilope leucophaeus". In 1853, the Dutch zoologist <a href="Coenraad%20Jacob%20Temminck">Coenraad Jacob Temminck</a> stated that the <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> was an adult male skin now in the <a href="Naturalis%20Biodiversity%20Center">Naturalis Biodiversity Center</a> in <a href="Leiden">Leiden</a> (formerly <a href="Rijksmuseum%20van%20Natuurlijke%20Historie">Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie</a>), collected in <a href="Swellendam">Swellendam</a> and present in <a href="Haarlem">Haarlem</a> before 1776. It has been questioned whether this was actually the type specimen, but in 1969, the Dutch zoologists Antonius M. Husson and <a href="Lipke%20Holthuis">Lipke Holthuis</a> selected it as the <a href="lectotype">lectotype</a> of a <a href="syntype%20series">syntype series</a>, as Pallas may have based his description on multiple specimens.

In 1846, the Swedish zoologist <a href="Carl%20Jakob%20Sundevall">Carl Jakob Sundevall</a> moved the bluebuck and its closest relatives to the genus "<a href="Hippotragus">Hippotragus</a>"; he had originally named this genus for the <a href="roan%20antelope">roan antelope</a> ("H. equinus") in 1845. This revision was commonly accepted by other writers, such as the British zoologists <a href="Philip%20Sclater">Philip Sclater</a> and <a href="Oldfield%20Thomas">Oldfield Thomas</a>, who restricted the genus "Antilope" to the <a href="blackbuck">blackbuck</a> ("A. cervicapra") in 1899. In 1914, the name "Hippotragus" was submitted for <a href="Conserved%20name">conservation</a> (so older, unused genus names could be suppressed) to the <a href="International%20Commission%20on%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature</a> (ICZN) with the bluebuck as <a href="type%20species">type species</a>. However, the original 1845 naming of the genus with the roan antelope as single species was overlooked and later suppressed by the ICZN, leading to some taxonomic confusion. In 2001, the British ecologist <a href="Peter%20J.%20Grubb">Peter J. Grubb</a> proposed that the ICZN should rescind its suppression of the 1845 naming and make the roan antelope the type species of "Hippotragus", since too little is known about the bluebuck for it to be a reliable type species. This was accepted by the commission in 2003.

According to German zoologist <a href="Erna%20Mohr">Erna Mohr</a>'s 1967 book about the bluebuck, the 1719 account of the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a> published by the traveller <a href="Peter%20Kolbe">Peter Kolbe</a> appears to be the first publication containing mention of the species. Kolbe also included an illustration, which Mohr believed was based on memory and notes. In 1975, Husson and Holthuis examined the original Dutch version of Kolbe's book and concluded that the illustration did not depict a bluebuck but rather a <a href="greater%20kudu">greater kudu</a> ("Tragelaphus strepsiceros"), and that the error was due to a mistranslation into German. The first published illustration of the bluebuck is therefore instead a depiction of a horn from 1764. It has also been pointed out that the animal had already been mentioned (as "blaue Böcke") on a list of <a href="Fauna%20of%20South%20Africa%23Mammals">South African mammals</a> in 1681.

The Welsh naturalist <a href="Thomas%20Pennant">Thomas Pennant</a> made the next published illustration, and included an account of the antelope, calling it "blue goat", in his 1771 "Synopsis of Quadrupeds", based on a skin from the Cape of Good Hope, purchased from Amsterdam. In 1778 a drawing by the Swiss-Dutch natural philosopher <a href="Jean-Nicolas-S%C3%A9bastien%20Allamand">Jean-Nicolas-Sébastien Allamand</a> was included in <a href="Comte%20de%20Buffon">Comte de Buffon</a>'s "<a href="Histoire%20Naturelle">Histoire Naturelle</a>"; he called the antelope "tzeiran", the Siberian name for the <a href="goitered%20gazelle">goitered gazelle</a> ("Gazella subgutturosa"). The illustration is widely believed to be based on the specimen in Leiden. This drawing is the first published illustration that shows the entire animal. Another record of the bluebuck appears in the travel memoirs of French explorer <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Levaillant">François Levaillant</a>, published in the 1780s, describing his quest to discover the land to the east of the Cape of Good Hope, "<a href="Hottentots%20Holland">Hottentots Holland</a>". The German zoologist <a href="Martin%20Lichtenstein">Martin Lichtenstein</a> wrote about the bluebuck in 1812, but the species was mentioned less frequently in subsequent literature.

Today, four mounted skins of the bluebuck remain: the adult male in Leiden, a young female at the <a href="Zoological%20Museum%20of%20Stockholm">Zoological Museum of Stockholm</a>, an adult female in the <a href="Vienna%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Vienna Museum of Natural History</a>, and an adult male in the <a href="Museum%20of%20Natural%20History%20in%20Paris">Museum of Natural History in Paris</a>. A mounted skin was housed in the <a href="Zoological%20Museum%20in%20Uppsala">Zoological Museum in Uppsala</a> until the 19th century, but now only the horns remain. There are also records of a skin in Haarlem, but its current whereabouts are unknown. Several of these skins have been identified in various 18th-century illustrations. A female skull is part of the collection at both the <a href="Hunterian%20Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery">Hunterian Museum</a> and the <a href="Zoological%20Museum%20of%20Amsterdam">Zoological Museum of Amsterdam</a>, though it has been suggested that the Hunterian's belongs to a sable antelope ("H.niger"). A pair of horns is present at both the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum, London</a>, and the <a href="South%20African%20Museum">South African Museum</a>. Skeletal remains have been found in both archaeological and palaeontological contexts.

The common names "bluebuck" and "blue antelope" are English for the original <a href="Afrikaans%20Language">Afrikaans</a> name "blaubok" . The name is a <a href="Compound%20%28linguistics%29">compound</a> of "blauw" and "bok" ("male antelope" or "male goat"). Variants of this name include "blaawwbok" and "blawebock". The <a href="Generic%20name%20%28biology%29">generic name</a> "Hippotragus" is <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> for "horse-goat", while the <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "leucophaeus" is a fusion of two Greek words: "leukos" ("white") and "phaios" ("brilliant").

Based on studies of <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>, the bluebuck has historically been classified as either a distinct species or as a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the roan antelope. After its extinction, some 19th-century naturalists began to doubt its validity as a species, with some believing the museum specimens to be small or immature roan antelopes, and both species were lumped together under the name "A.leucophaeus" by the English zoologist <a href="George%20Robert%20Gray">George Robert Gray</a> in 1821. The Austrian zoologist <a href="Franz%20Friedrich%20Kohl">Franz Friedrich Kohl</a> pointed out the distinct features of the bluebuck in 1866, followed by Sclater and Thomas, who rejected the synonymy in 1899.

In 1974 the American biologist <a href="Richard%20G.%20Klein">Richard G. Klein</a> showed (based on fossils) that the bluebuck and roan antelope occurred <a href="sympatry">sympatrically</a> on the coastal plain of the southwestern Cape from <a href="Oakhurst%2C%20Western%20Cape">Oakhurst</a> to <a href="Uniondale%2C%20Western%20Cape">Uniondale</a> during the early <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a>, supporting their status as separate species. In 1996 an analysis of <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> extracted from the bluebuck specimen in Vienna showed that it is outside the <a href="clade">clade</a> containing the roan and sable antelopes. The study therefore concluded that the bluebuck is a distinct species, and not merely a subspecies of the roan antelope as was supposed. The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> below shows the position of the bluebuck among its relatives, following the 1996 analysis:
In 2017, a reconstruction of the entire bluebuck <a href="mitogenome">mitogenome</a>, based on bone powder extracted from the horns in Uppsala, contradicted the 1996 results. This study instead placed the bluebuck as <a href="sister%20species">sister species</a> to the sable antelope, with the roan antelope as <a href="Outgroup%20%28cladistics%29">outgroup</a>. The bluebuck and sable antelope diverged form each other 2.8 million years ago, while the roan antelope diverged from them 4.17 million years ago. Africa was going through <a href="climactic%20oscillations">climactic oscillations</a> between 3.5 and 2 million years ago, and during a colder period, the ancestors of the sable antelope and bluebuck may have been separated, and the population in southern Africa eventually became a new species. The cladogram below shows the placement of the bluebuck according to the 2017 study:

The adult male bluebuck in Leiden is tall at the <a href="withers">withers</a>, and is possibly the largest known specimen. According to Sclater and Thomas, the tallest specimen is the one in Paris, a male that stands at the shoulder; the specimen in Vienna, on the other hand, is the shortest, a tall female. The bluebuck was notably smaller than the roan and sable antelopes, and therefore the smallest member of its genus.

The <a href="Coat%20%28animal%29">coat</a> was a uniform bluish-grey, with a pale whitish belly, which was not contrasted on the flanks. The limbs had a faint dark line along their front surface. The forehead was brown, darker than the face, and the upper lip and patch in front of the eyes were lighter than the body. The neck-mane was directed forwards and not as developed as in the roan and sable antelopes, and the throat-mane was almost absent. Other differences between the bluebuck and its extant relatives included its shorter and blunter ears not tipped with black, a darker tail tuft (though little darker than its general colour), and smaller teeth. The bluebuck also lacked the contrasting black and white patterns seen on the heads of its relatives.

As the old skins are presumably faded, it may be difficult to reconstruct the original colour of the bluebuck from them. Pennant observed that the eyes had white patches below them and the underbelly was white; the coat was a "fine blue" in living specimens, while it changed to "bluish grey, with a mixture of white" in dead animals. He also suggested that the length of the bluebuck's hair and the morphology of its horns formed a link between antelopes and <a href="goat">goat</a>. He went on to describe the ears as pointed and over long and the tail as long, terminating in a long tuft.

The horns of the bluebuck were significantly shorter and thinner than those of the roan antelope, but perhaps proportionally longer. The horns of the Leiden specimen measure along the curve. The horns at Hunterian Museum are spaced apart and are nearly long with a basal circumference of nearly . Pennant gave the horn length as . He added that the horns, sharp and curving backward, consist of twenty rings. This description agrees with the horns at the Hunterian Museum. The skull at the Hunterian Museum measures in length. The horns of the bluebuck appear to have hollow pedicles (bony structures from which the horns emerge).

The bluebuck, as Klein puts it, became extinct before "qualified scientists could make observations on live specimens". According to historical accounts, the bluebuck formed groups of up to 20 individuals. Similarities to the roan and the sable antelopes in terms of dental morphology make it highly probable that the bluebuck was predominantly a selective <a href="Grazing">grazer</a>, and fed mainly on grasses. The row of <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s was longer than in others of the genus, implying the presence of <a href="Dicotyledon">dicot</a>s in the diet. A 2013 study by the Australian palaeontologist J. Tyler Faith and colleagues noted the scarcity of morphological evidence to show that the bluebuck could have survived the summers in the western margin of the <a href="Cape%20Floristic%20Region">Cape Floristic Region</a> (CFR), when the grasses are neither palatable nor nutritious. This might have induced a west-to-east migration, because the eastern margin receives rainfall throughout the year while precipitation in the western margin is limited to winter.

An 18th-century account suggests that females might have left their newborn calves in isolation and returned regularly to suckle them until the calves were old enough to join herds, which is similar to the behaviour of roan and sable antelopes. Akin to other grazing antelopes, the bluebuck probably calved mainly where rainfall, and thus the availability of grasses, peaked. Such locations could be the western margin of the CFR during winter and the eastern margin of the CFR during summer. Faith et al. 2013 found that the occurrence of juveniles in bluebuck fossils decreases linearly from the west to the east, indicating that most births took place in the western CFR; due to the preference for rainfall, it may be further assumed that most births occurred during winter, when the western CFR receives most of its rainfall. The annual west-to-east migration would have followed in summer, consistent with the greater number of older juveniles in the east that would have joined herds. Juvenile fossils also occur in other places across the range, but appear to be concentrated in the western CFR.

<a href="Endemic%20species">Endemic</a> to South Africa, the bluebuck was confined to the southwestern <a href="Cape%20Peninsula">Cape</a>. A 2003 study estimated the expanse of the historic range of the bluebuck at , mainly along the southern coast of South Africa; fossils, however, have been discovered in a broader area that includes the southern and western CFR and even the highlands of <a href="Lesotho">Lesotho</a>. Historical records give a rough estimate of its range. On 20January 1774, Swedish naturalist <a href="Carl%20Peter%20Thunberg">Carl Peter Thunberg</a> recorded a sighting in Tigerhoek, <a href="Mpumalanga">Mpumalanga</a>. In March or April 1783, Levalliant claimed to have witnessed two specimens in Soetemelksvlei, <a href="Western%20Cape">Western Cape</a>. Based on these notes, a 2009 study by the South African zoologist Graham I. H. Kerley and colleagues estimated the range of the bluebuck to be limited within a triangular area in the Western Cape, bounded by <a href="Caledon%2C%20Western%20Cape">Caledon</a> to the west, Swellendam to the northeast and <a href="Bredasdorp">Bredasdorp</a> to the south. <a href="Rock%20paintings">Rock paintings</a> in the <a href="Caledon%20River">Caledon river valley</a> of the <a href="Free%20State%20%28province%29">Free State</a> province in eastern South Africa have been identified as bluebucks, which also confirms the once wider distribution of the species.

In 1974 Klein studied the fossils of "Hippotragus" species in South Africa. Most of these were found to represent the bluebuck and the roan antelope. The fossil record suggested that the bluebuck occurred in large numbers during the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a> (nearly 0.1million years ago), and was more common than <a href="sympatry">sympatric</a> antelopes. The bluebuck could adapt to more open habitats than could the roan antelope, a notable point of difference between these species. Fossils of the bluebuck have been found in the <a href="Klasies%20River%20Caves">Klaises River</a> and the <a href="Nelson%20Bay%20Cave">Nelson Bay Cave</a> (near Plettenberg Bay) and <a href="Swartklip">Swartklip</a> (to the west of the <a href="Hottentots%20Holland%20Mountains">Hottentots Holland mountains</a>). Faith et al. 2013 noted that the western and southern CFR were separated by <a href="biogeographical">biogeographical</a> barriers, such as the <a href="Cape%20Fold%20Belt">Cape Fold Belt</a> and <a href="afromontane">afromontane</a> forests. A 2011 study suggested that low sea levels facilitated migrations for large mammals; therefore the rise in sea levels with the beginning of the Holocene would have led to fragmented bluebuck populations and distanced many populations from the western coast (fossils dating to this period are scarce in the western coast but have been recorded from the southern coast). Thus, a mass extinction could have taken place, leaving behind mainly the populations that remained in the resource-rich western CFR. The causes of the drastic decline in bluebuck populations just before the 15th and 16th centuries have not been investigated; competition with livestock and habitat deterioration could have been major factors in its depletion.

Faith et al. 2013 further suggested that the bluebuck, being a grazer, probably favoured grassland habitats. This hypothesis is supported by fossil evidencebluebuck fossils appear in significant numbers along with those of grassland antelopes. Kerley et al. 2009 suggested that the bluebuck frequented grasslands and shunned wooded areas and thickets. In a 1976 study of fossils in the <a href="Southern%20Cape">Southern Cape</a>, Klein observed that the bluebuck's habitat preferences were similar to those of the <a href="Cape%20buffalo">Cape buffalo</a> ("Syncerus caffer") and the <a href="reedbuck">reedbuck</a> ("Redunca").

Due to the small range of the bluebuck at the time of European settlement of the Cape region in the 17th and 18th centuries compared to the much wider area evidenced by fossil remains, it is thought the species was already in decline before this time. The bluebuck was the sole species of "Hippotragus" in the region until 70,00035,000 years ago, but the roan antelope appears to have become predominant about 11,000 years ago. This might have coincided with grasslands being replaced by, for example, brush and forest, thereby reducing what is presumed to be the preferred habitat of the bluebuck, the grasslands. The results of the sea level changes in the early Holocene may also have played a role in the decline of the species, and left only the southern population to survive into historical times.

The bluebuck was hunted to extinction by European settlers; in 1774 Thunberg noted that it was becoming increasingly rare. The German biologist <a href="Hinrich%20Lichtenstein">Hinrich Lichtenstein</a> claimed that the last bluebuck had been shot in 1799 or 1800. The bluebuck is the first historically recorded large <a href="Fauna%20of%20Africa%23Mammals">African mammal</a> to become extinct, followed by the <a href="quagga">quagga</a> ("Equus quagga quagga"), which died out in 1883. Around the time of its extinction, the bluebuck occurred in what would be known as the <a href="Overberg">Overberg</a> region (Western Cape), probably concentrated in Swellendam. In 1990, the South African zoologist Brian D. Colohan argued that an 1853 eyewitness report of a "bastard gemsbok" seen near <a href="Bethlehem%2C%20Free%20State">Bethlehem, Free State</a>, actually referred to a bluebuck, fifty years after the last individuals in Swellendam were shot.

Rokeby Venus

The Rokeby Venus (; also known as The Toilet of Venus, Venus at her Mirror, Venus and Cupid, or La Venus del espejo) is a painting by <a href="Diego%20Vel%C3%A1zquez">Diego Velázquez</a>, the leading artist of the <a href="Spanish%20Golden%20Age">Spanish Golden Age</a>. Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a> in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the <a href="Roman%20mythology">Roman</a> god of physical love, her son <a href="Cupid">Cupid</a>. The painting is in the <a href="National%20Gallery%20%28London%29">National Gallery</a>, London.

Numerous works, from the ancient to the <a href="baroque">baroque</a>, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as <a href="Giorgione">Giorgione's</a> "<a href="Sleeping%20Venus%20%28Giorgione%29">Sleeping Venus</a>" (c. 1510) and <a href="Titian">Titian's</a> "<a href="Venus%20of%20Urbino">Venus of Urbino</a>" (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the <a href="Venus%20effect">Venus effect</a>. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.

The "Rokeby Venus" is the only surviving female <a href="Depictions%20of%20nudity">nude</a> by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a>. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in <a href="Rokeby%20Park">Rokeby Park</a>, <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>. In 1906, the painting was purchased by <a href="The%20Art%20Fund">National Art Collections Fund</a> for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage">suffragette</a> <a href="Mary%20Richardson">Mary Richardson</a>, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.

The "Rokeby Venus" depicts the <a href="Roman%20mythology">Roman</a> goddess of love, beauty and <a href="fertility">fertility</a> reclining languidly on her bed, her back to the viewer—in <a href="Ancient%20history">Antiquity</a>, portrayal of Venus from a back view was a common visual and literary erotic motif—and her knees tucked. She is shown without the mythological paraphernalia normally included in depictions of the scene; jewellery, roses, and <a href="Myrtus">myrtle</a> are all absent. Unlike most earlier portrayals of the goddess, which show her with blond hair, Velázquez's Venus is a brunette. The female figure can be identified as Venus because of the presence of her son, Cupid.

Venus gazes into a mirror held by Cupid, who is without his usual bow and arrows. When the work was first inventoried, it was described as "a nude woman", probably owing to its controversial nature.
Venus looks outward at the viewer of the painting through her reflected image in the mirror. However, the image is blurred and reveals only a vague reflection of her facial characteristics; the reflected image of the head is much larger than it would be in reality. The critic Natasha Wallace has speculated that Venus's indistinct face may be the key to the underlying meaning of the painting, in that "it is not intended as a specific female nude, nor even as a portrayal of Venus, but as an image of self-absorbed beauty." According to Wallace, "There is nothing spiritual about face or picture. The classical setting is an excuse for a very material aesthetic sexuality—not sex, as such, but an appreciation of the beauty that accompanies attraction."

Intertwining pink silk ribbons are draped over the mirror and curl over its frame. The ribbon's function has been the subject of much debate by art historians; suggestions include an allusion to the <a href="fetters">fetters</a> used by Cupid to bind lovers, that it was used to hang the mirror, and that it was used to blindfold Venus moments before. The critic Julián Gallego found Cupid's facial expression to be so melancholy that he interprets the ribbons as fetters binding the god to the image of Beauty, and gave the painting the title "Amor conquered by Beauty".

The folds of the bed sheets echo the goddess's physical form, and are rendered to emphasise the sweeping curves of her body. The composition mainly uses shades of red, white, and grey, which are used even in Venus's skin; although the effect of this simple colour scheme has been much praised, recent technical analysis has shown that the grey sheet was originally a "deep mauve", that has now faded. The luminescent colours used in Venus's skin, applied with "smooth, creamy, blended handling", contrast with the dark greys and black of the silk she is lying on, and with the brown of the wall behind her face.
The "Rokeby Venus" is the only surviving nude by Velázquez, but three others by the artist are recorded in 17th-century Spanish inventories. Two were mentioned in the Royal collection, but may have been lost in the 1734 fire that destroyed the main <a href="Royal%20Palace%20of%20Madrid">Royal Palace of Madrid</a>. A further one was recorded in the collection of Domingo Guerra Coronel. These records mention "a reclining Venus", "Venus and Adonis", and a "Psyche and Cupid".

Although the work is widely thought to have been painted from life, the identity of the model is subject to much speculation. In contemporary Spain it was acceptable for artists to employ male nude models for studies; however, the use of female nude models was frowned upon. The painting is believed to have been executed during one of Velázquez's visits to Rome, and Prater has observed that in Rome the artist "did indeed lead a life of considerable personal liberty that would have been consistent with the notion of using a live nude female model". It has been claimed that the painting depicts a mistress Velázquez is known to have had while in Italy, who is supposed to have borne his child. Others have claimed that the model is the same as in "Coronation of the Virgin" and "<a href="Las%20Hilanderas%20%28Vel%C3%A1zquez%29">Las Hilanderas</a>", both in the <a href="Museo%20del%20Prado">Museo del Prado</a>, and other works.

The figures of both Venus and Cupid were significantly altered during the painting process, the result of the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted. <a href="Pentimento">Pentimenti</a> can be seen in Venus's upraised arm, in the position of her left shoulder, and on her head. <a href="Infrared%23Art%20history">Infra-red</a> reveals that she was originally shown more upright with her head turned to the left. An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate. The painting was given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66, which showed it to be in good condition, and with very little paint added later by other artists, contrary to what some earlier writers had asserted.

Paintings of nudes and of Venus by Italian, and especially Venetian, artists were influences on Velázquez. However, Velázquez's version is, according to the art historian Andreas Prater, "a highly independent visual concept that has many precursors, but no direct model; scholars have sought them in vain". Forerunners include Titian's various depictions of Venus, such as "Venus and Cupid with a Partridge", "Venus and Cupid with an Organist" and notably the "Venus of Urbino"; <a href="Palma%20il%20Vecchio">Palma il Vecchio</a>'s "Reclining Nude"; and Giorgione's "Sleeping Venus", all of which show the deity reclining on luxurious textiles, although in landscape settings in the latter two works. The use of a centrally placed mirror was inspired by the painters of the Italian High Renaissance, including Titian, <a href="Girolamo%20Savoldo">Girolamo Savoldo</a> and <a href="Lorenzo%20Lotto">Lorenzo Lotto</a>, who used mirrors as an active protagonist, as opposed to more than merely a prop or accessory in the pictorial space. Both <a href="Titian">Titian</a> and <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a> had already painted Venus looking into a mirror, and as both had had close ties to the Spanish court, their examples would have been familiar to Velázquez. However, "this girl with her small waist and jutting hip, does not resemble the fuller more rounded Italian nudes inspired by ancient sculpture".

One innovation of the "Rokeby Venus", when compared to other large single nude paintings, lies in the fact that Velázquez depicts a back view of its subject who is turned away from the viewer. There were precedents for this in <a href="old%20master%20print">prints</a> by <a href="Giulio%20Campagnola">Giulio Campagnola</a>, <a href="Agostino%20Veneziano">Agostino Veneziano</a>, <a href="Hans%20Sebald%20Beham">Hans Sebald Beham</a> and <a href="Theodor%20de%20Bry">Theodor de Bry</a>, as well as classical sculptures known to Velázquez, of which casts were made for Madrid. These were the "Sleeping Ariadne" now in the <a href="Pitti%20Palace">Pitti Palace</a>, but then in Rome, of which Velázquez ordered a cast for the Royal collection in 1650–51, and the <a href="Borghese%20Hermaphroditus">Borghese Hermaphroditus</a>, a sleeping <a href="hermaphrodite">hermaphrodite</a> (picture to the right above), now in the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>, of which a cast was sent to Madrid, and which also emphasises the curve from hip to waist. However, the combination of elements in Velázquez's composition was original.

The "Rokeby Venus" may have been intended as a pendant to a sixteenth-century <a href="Venice">Venetian</a> painting of a recumbent Venus (which seems to have begun life as a <a href="Dana%C3%AB">Danaë</a>) in a landscape, in the same pose, but seen from the front. The two were certainly hung together for many years in Spain when in the collection of <a href="Gaspar%20M%C3%A9ndez%20de%20Haro%2C%207th%20Marquis%20of%20Carpio">Gaspar Méndez de Haro, 7th Marquis of Carpio</a> (1629–87); at what point they were initially paired is uncertain.

The portrayal of nudes was officially discouraged in 17th-century Spain. Works could be seized or repainting demanded by the Inquisition, and artists who painted licentious or immoral works were often excommunicated, fined, or banished from Spain for a year. However, within intellectual and aristocratic circles, the aims of art were believed to supersede questions of morality, and there were many, generally mythological, nudes in private collections.

Velázquez's patron, the art-loving King Philip IV, held a number of nudes by Titian and Rubens, and Velázquez, as the king's painter, need not have feared painting such a picture. Leading collectors, including the King, tended to keep nudes, many mythological, in relatively private rooms; in Phillip's case "the room where His Majesty retires after eating", which contained the Titian "poesies" he had inherited from <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Phillip II</a>, and the Rubens he had commissioned himself. The "Venus" would be in such a room while in the collections of both Haro and Godoy. The court of Philip IV greatly "appreciated painting in general, and the nude in particular, but ... at the same time, exerted unparalleled pressure on artists to avoid the depiction of the naked human body."

The contemporary Spanish attitude toward paintings of nudes was unique in Europe. Although such works were appreciated by some connoisseurs and intellectuals within Spain, they were generally treated with suspicion. Low necklines were commonly worn by women during the period, but according to the art historian Zahira Veliz, "the codes of pictorial decorum would not easily permit a known lady to be painted in this way". For Spaniards of the 17th century, the issue of the nude in art was tied up with concepts of morality, power, and aesthetics. This attitude is reflected in the literature of the <a href="Spanish%20Golden%20Age">Spanish Golden Age</a>, in works such as <a href="Lope%20de%20Vega">Lope de Vega</a>'s play "La quinta de Florencia", which features an aristocrat who commits rape after viewing a scantily clad figure in a mythological painting by <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>.

In 1632, an anonymous pamphlet—attributed to the Portuguese Francisco de Braganza—was published with the title "A copy of the opinions and censorship by the most revered fathers, masters and senior professors of the distinguished universities of <a href="University%20of%20Salamanca">Salamanca</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Alcal%C3%A1">Alcalá</a>, and other scholars on the abuse of lascivious and indecent figures and paintings, which are mortal sin to be painted, carved and displayed where they can be seen". The court was able to exert counter-pressure, and a piece by the famous poet and preacher Fray <a href="Hortensio%20F%C3%A9lix%20Paravicino">Hortensio Félix Paravicino</a>, which proposed the destruction of all paintings of the nude, and was written to be included in the pamphlet, was never published. Paravicino was a connoisseur of painting, and therefore believed in its power: "the finest paintings are the greatest threat: burn the best of them". As his title shows, Braganza merely argued that such works should be kept from the view of a wider public, as was in fact mostly the practice in Spain.

In contrast, <a href="French%20art">French art</a> of the period often depicted women with low necklines and slender corsets; however, the mutilation by the French royal family of the <a href="Correggio">Correggio</a> depiction of <a href="Leda%20and%20the%20Swan">Leda and the Swan</a> and their apparent destruction of the famous <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> and <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> paintings of the same subject, show that nudity could be controversial in France also. In northern Europe it was seen as acceptable to portray artfully draped nudes. Examples include Rubens's "Minerva Victrix", of 1622–25, which shows <a href="Marie%20de%27%20Medici">Marie de' Medici</a> with an uncovered breast, and <a href="Anthony%20van%20Dyck">Anthony van Dyck</a>'s 1620 painting, "The Duke and Duchess of Buckingham as Venus and Adonis".

In 17th-century Spanish art, even in the depiction of <a href="sibyl">sibyl</a>s, nymphs, and goddesses, the female form was always chastely covered. No painting from the 1630s or 1640s, whether in the <a href="genre%20works">genre</a>, portrait, or <a href="history%20painting">history</a> format, shows a Spanish female with her breasts exposed; even uncovered arms were only rarely shown. In 1997, the art historian Peter Cherry suggested that Velázquez sought to overcome the contemporary requirement for modesty by portraying Venus from the back. Even in the mid-18th century, an English artist who made a drawing of the Venus when it was in the collection of the Dukes of Alba noted it was "not hung up, owing to the subject".

Another attitude to the issue was shown by Morritt, who wrote to <a href="Sir%20Walter%20Scott">Sir Walter Scott</a> of his "fine painting of Venus' backside", which he hung above his main fireplace, so that "the ladies may avert their downcast eyes without difficulty and connoisseurs steal a glance without drawing the said posterior into the company".

The "Rokeby Venus" was long held to be one of Velázquez's final works. In 1951, it was found recorded in an inventory of 1 June 1651 from the collection of <a href="Gaspar%20M%C3%A9ndez%20de%20Haro%2C%207th%20Marquis%20of%20Carpio">Gaspar Méndez de Haro, 7th Marquis of Carpio</a>, a close associate of <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20Spain">Philip IV of Spain</a>. Haro was the great-nephew of Velázquez's first patron, the <a href="Gaspar%20de%20Guzm%C3%A1n%2C%20Count-Duke%20of%20Olivares">Count-Duke of Olivares</a>, and a notorious <a href="libertine">libertine</a>. According to the art historian Dawson Carr, Haro "loved paintings almost as much as he loved women", and "even his panegyrists lamented his excessive taste for lower-class women during his youth". For these reasons it seemed likely that he would have commissioned the painting. However, in 2001 the art historian Ángel Aterido discovered that the painting had first belonged to the Madrid art dealer and painter Domingo Guerra Coronel, and was sold to Haro in 1652 following Coronel's death the previous year. Coronel's ownership of the painting raises a number of questions: how and when it came into Coronel's possession, and why Velázquez's name was omitted from Coronel's inventory. The art critic Javier Portús has suggested that the omission may have been due to the painting's portrayal of a female nude, "a type of work which was carefully supervised and whose dissemination was considered problematic".

These revelations make the painting difficult to date. Velázquez's painting technique offers no assistance, although its strong emphasis on colour and tone suggest that the work dates from his mature period. The best estimates of its origin put its completion in the late 1640s or early 1650s, either in Spain or during Velázquez's last visit to Italy. If this is the case, then the breadth of handling and the dissolution of form can be seen to mark the beginning of the artist's final period. The conscientious modelling and strong tonal contrasts of his earlier work are here replaced by a restraint and subtlety which would culminate in his late masterpiece, "<a href="Las%20Meninas">Las Meninas</a>".

The painting passed from Haro into the collection of his daughter Catalina de Haro y Guzmán, the eighth Marchioness of Carpio, and her husband, Francisco Álvarez de Toledo, the tenth <a href="List%20of%20Dukes%20of%20Alba">Duke of Alba</a>. In 1802, <a href="Charles%20IV%20of%20Spain">Charles IV of Spain</a> ordered the family to sell the painting (with other works) to <a href="Manuel%20de%20Godoy">Manuel de Godoy</a>, his <a href="favourite">favourite</a> and chief minister. He hung it alongside two masterpieces by <a href="Francisco%20Goya">Francisco Goya</a> that he may have commissioned himself, <a href="La%20maja%20desnuda">"The Nude Maja"</a> and <a href="La%20maja%20vestida">"The Clothed Maja"</a>. These bear obvious compositional similarities with Velázquez's "Venus", although unlike Velázquez, Goya clearly painted his nude in a calculated attempt to provoke shame and disgust in the relatively unenlightened climate of 18th-century Spain.

"Venus" was brought to England in 1813, where it was purchased by <a href="John%20Morritt">John Morritt</a> for £500 (£  in 2019), and on the advice of his friend Sir <a href="Thomas%20Lawrence">Thomas Lawrence</a>. Morritt hung it in his house at Rokeby Park, Yorkshire—thus the painting's popular name. In 1906, the painting was acquired for the National Gallery by the newly created National Art Collections Fund, its first campaigning triumph. King <a href="Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Edward VII</a> greatly admired the painting, and anonymously provided £8,000 (£  in 2019) towards its purchase, and became Patron of the Fund thereafter.

In part because he was overlooked until the mid-19th century, Velázquez found no followers and was not widely imitated. In particular, his visual and structural innovations in this portrayal of Venus were not developed by other artists until recently, largely owing to the censorship of the work. The painting remained in a series of private rooms in private collections until it was exhibited in 1857 at the Manchester <a href="Art%20Treasures%20Exhibition">Art Treasures Exhibition</a>, along with 25 other paintings at least claimed to be by Velázquez; it was here that it became known as the "Rokeby Venus". It does not appear to have been copied by other artists, engraved or otherwise reproduced, until this period. In 1890 it was exhibited in the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a> in London, and in 1905 at Messrs. Agnews, the dealers who had bought it from Morritt. From 1906 it was highly visible in the National Gallery and became well-known globally through reproductions. The general influence of the painting was therefore long delayed, although individual artists would have been able to see it on occasion throughout its history.
Velázquez's portrait is a staging of a private moment of intimacy and a dramatic departure from the classical depictions of sleep and intimacy found in works from antiquity and Venetian art that portray Venus. However, the simplicity with which Velázquez displays the female nude—without jewellery or any of the goddess's usual accessories—was echoed in later nude studies by <a href="Jean%20Auguste%20Dominique%20Ingres">Ingres</a>, <a href="%C3%89douard%20Manet">Manet</a>, and <a href="Paul-Jacques-Aim%C3%A9%20Baudry">Baudry</a>, among others. In addition, Velázquez's depiction of Venus as a reclining nude viewed from the rear was a rarity before that time, although the pose has been painted by many later artists. Manet, in his stark female portrayal "<a href="Olympia%20%28painting%29">Olympia</a>", paraphrased the "Rokeby Venus" in pose and by suggesting the persona of a real woman rather than an ethereal goddess. "Olympia" shocked the <a href="Paris">Paris</a>ian art world when it was first exhibited in 1863. Olympia gazes directly out at the viewer, as does Velázquez's Venus, only through the reflection of the mirror.

The 1961 film "<a href="The%20Happy%20Thieves">The Happy Thieves</a>" features a plan to steal the picture from a Spanish mansion.

On 10 March 1914, the <a href="suffragette">suffragette</a> <a href="Mary%20Richardson">Mary Richardson</a> walked into the National Gallery and attacked Velázquez's canvas with a meat cleaver. Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette <a href="Emmeline%20Pankhurst">Emmeline Pankhurst</a> the previous day, although there had been earlier warnings of a planned suffragette attack on the collection. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, particularly causing damage to the area between the figure's shoulders. However, all were successfully repaired by the National Gallery's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann.

Richardson was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, the maximum allowed for destruction of an artwork. In a statement to the <a href="Women%27s%20Social%20and%20Political%20Union">Women's Social and Political Union</a> shortly afterwards, Richardson explained, "I have tried to destroy the picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest against the Government for destroying Mrs. Pankhurst, who is the most beautiful character in modern history." She added in a 1952 interview that she didn't like "the way men visitors gaped at it all day long".

The feminist writer <a href="Lynda%20Nead">Lynda Nead</a> observed, "The incident has come to symbolize a particular perception of feminist attitudes towards the female nude; in a sense, it has come to represent a specific stereotypical image of feminism more generally." Contemporary reports of the incident reveal that the picture was not widely seen as mere artwork. Journalists tended to assess the attack in terms of a murder (Richardson was nicknamed "Slasher Mary"), and used words that conjured wounds inflicted on an actual female body, rather than on a pictorial representation of a female body. "The Times" described a "cruel wound in the neck", as well as incisions to the shoulders and back.

Interstate 275 (Michigan)

Interstate 275 (I-275) is an <a href="Interstate%20Highway">Interstate</a> in the US state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> that acts as a western <a href="Bypass%20%28road%29%23United%20States">bypass</a> of the <a href="Detroit%20metropolitan%20area">Detroit metropolitan area</a>. The <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT) maintains the highway as part of the larger <a href="Michigan%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway system</a>. The freeway runs through the western suburbs near <a href="Detroit%20Metropolitan%20Wayne%20County%20Airport">Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport</a>, and crosses several rivers and rail lines in the area. The southern terminus is the interchange with <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">I-75</a> near <a href="Newport%2C%20Michigan">Newport</a>, northeast of <a href="Monroe%2C%20Michigan">Monroe</a>. MDOT considers the Interstate to run to an interchange with <a href="Interstate%2096">I-96</a>, <a href="Interstate%20696">I-696</a> and <a href="M-5%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-5</a> on the <a href="Farmington%20Hills%2C%20Michigan">Farmington Hills</a>–<a href="Novi%2C%20Michigan">Novi</a> city line, <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">running concurrently</a> with I-96 for about . This gives a total length of about , which is backed up by official signage. According to the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> (FHWA), the length is because that agency considers I-275 to end at the junction with I-96 and <a href="M-14%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-14</a> along the boundary between <a href="Livonia%2C%20Michigan">Livonia</a> and <a href="Plymouth%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Plymouth Township</a>.

A highway roughly parallel to the modern I-275 was included in early planning maps for the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s. As plans developed through the 1960s and into the early 1970s, the freeway was to run from I-75 near Newport north to Novi and connect back to I-75 near <a href="Davisburg%2C%20Michigan">Davisburg</a>. Some plans in the 1970s had the northern Novi–Davisburg section numbered as a state highway M-275. The southern half of I-275 was built in segments that were completed in January 1977. Later that month, the state canceled the northern section because of local opposition. A later attempt to revive the proposal failed in 1979. Additional plans to complete M-275 through <a href="Oakland%20County%2C%20Michigan">Oakland County</a> were kept on the drawing boards through the 1980s, but failed to materialize. M-5 (Haggerty Connector) opened along part of the former I-275/M-275 <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a> between 1994 and 2000.

I-275 begins at exit 20 along I-75 in northeastern <a href="Monroe%20County%2C%20Michigan">Monroe County</a>. The surrounding area is farmland and residential subdivisions in the adjacent <a href="Frenchtown%20Charter%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Frenchtown</a> and <a href="Berlin%20Charter%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Berlin</a> <a href="charter%20township">charter township</a>s near the community of Newport. The <a href="freeway">freeway</a> angles to the northwest and crosses <a href="U.S.%20Route%2024%20in%20Michigan">US Highway 24</a> (US 24), which is also called Telegraph Road. After this interchange, I-275 turns to the north, running east of <a href="Carleton%2C%20Michigan">Carleton</a>, crossing the <a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">Canadian National Railway</a> and <a href="Conrail%20Shared%20Assets">Conrail Shared Assets</a> lines north of exit 5. At Will Carleton Road, the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">trunkline</a> crosses into <a href="Wayne%20County%2C%20Michigan">Wayne County</a>. There it continues on a northerly path parallel to a <a href="CSX%20Transportation">CSX Transportation</a> line through southern Wayne County. The freeway crosses the <a href="Huron%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Huron River</a> at South Huron Road, adjacent to <a href="Willow%20Metropark">Willow Metropark</a>.
In the city of <a href="Romulus%2C%20Michigan">Romulus</a>, I-275 begins to take on a more suburban character when it passes the southwestern boundary of the <a href="Detroit%20Metropolitan%20Wayne%20County%20Airport">Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport</a>. There is access to the south side of the airport signed at Eureka Road and to the north side at <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a>. Between these two interchanges, I-275 begins to run to the northwest. South of I-94, the highway crosses over the same CSX line and a <a href="Norfolk%20Southern%20Railway">Norfolk Southern Railway</a> (NS) line and north of I-94, it passes a campus of <a href="Wayne%20County%20Community%20College">Wayne County Community College</a> and the headquarters of the <a href="Visteon%20Corporation">Visteon Corporation</a>, a major auto parts supplier spun off from <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford Motor Company</a>. Near these two complexes, the freeway turns north again, running parallel and to the east of Haggerty Road. The freeway crosses over another NS railroad line also used by <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> trains from <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> and <a href="Pontiac%2C%20Michigan">Pontiac</a>, <a href="U.S.%20Route%2012%20in%20Michigan">US 12</a> (Michigan Avenue) and <a href="M-153%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-153</a> (Ford Road) in <a href="Canton%2C%20Michigan">Canton</a>. I-275 crosses the Lower Branch of the <a href="River%20Rouge%20%28Michigan%29">River Rouge</a> north of Michigan Avenue and the Middle Branch north of Ford Road, and it also crosses over a CSX line again. North of the Middle Branch of the River Rouge in <a href="Plymouth%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Plymouth Township</a>, I-275 crosses Schoolcraft Road and another CSX line from <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>.

The interchange with <a href="Interstate%2096">I-96</a> (Jeffries Freeway) on the border between Plymouth Township and <a href="Livonia%2C%20Michigan">Livonia</a> is where the FHWA considers I-275 to end as they do not note any overlap with I-96, however MDOT continues the designation on maps and signage to <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">run concurrently</a> with I-96 northward. I-96 merges from the east on the Jeffries Freeway and turns north; from the west, the <a href="M-14%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-14</a> freeway merges and ends. At the time the freeway from this interchange northward to <a href="Farmington%20Hills%2C%20Michigan">Farmington Hills</a> was opened to traffic, it was dual signed as I-96/I-275, and the unbuilt segment of freeway from <a href="Novi%2C%20Michigan">Novi</a> to <a href="Davisburg%2C%20Michigan">Davisburg</a> that was to be either I-275 or M-275 was still an active proposal. I-275 is shown running concurrently with I-96 through Livonia and Farmington Hills on MDOT maps, and other map makers and mapping service providers such as the <a href="American%20Automobile%20Association">American Automobile Association</a>, <a href="Rand%20McNally">Rand McNally</a> and <a href="Google%20Maps">Google Maps</a> label their maps in accordance with MDOT and not FHWA.
North of the interchange with the Jeffries Freeway, the combined I-96/I-275 curves to the east into Livonia, running parallel to Haggerty Road and continuing through suburban areas. The freeway has interchanges with <a href="Mile%20Road%20System%20%28Detroit%29">6 Mile and 7 Mile roads</a> in the northwest corner of Livonia. I-96/I-275 passes through an interchange with <a href="8%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BMile%20Road">8 Mile Road</a> while crossing into <a href="Oakland%20County%2C%20Michigan">Oakland County</a> entering the southwest corner of Farmington Hills. North of 10 Mile Road, I-96/I-275 crosses <a href="Grand%20River%20Avenue">Grand River Avenue</a>. Here the ramps start to connect with both directions of <a href="M-5%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-5</a>, the start of eastbound <a href="Interstate%20696">I-696</a> or the continuation of westbound I-96. MDOT ends the I-275 designation at this massive interchange.

A north–south freeway was originally planned as an <a href="Interstate%20Highway">Interstate Highway</a> allowing through traffic to bypass the city of <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>. This plan was included in the 1955 "<a href="General%20Location%20of%20National%20System%20of%20Interstate%20Highways">General Location of National System of Interstate Highways</a>" ("Yellow Book"), an early proposal for what would become the Interstate Highway System. The "Yellow Book" contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Detroit area including a north–south freeway east of the current I-275 corridor. The 1958 numbering plan for Michigan submitted by the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Highway%20Department">State Highway Department</a> had this route initially marked as I-73. William Swanson in the MDOT Highway Planning Unit later stated that the department also planned to reverse the numbering of I-75 and I-275 between <a href="Newport%2C%20Michigan">Newport</a> and <a href="Davisburg%2C%20Michigan">Davisburg</a>; I-75 would have bypassed downtown Detroit just as it bypassed downtown <a href="Flint%2C%20Michigan">Flint</a> and downtown <a href="Saginaw%2C%20Michigan">Saginaw</a> to the north, and the auxiliary number (I-275) would have been used on the freeway through downtown Detroit.

The present-day <a href="freeway">freeway</a> was built in stages in the mid-1970s. In 1974, the state highway map of the time showed the highway under construction, but no parts completed. The first of the freeway were shown opened to traffic from <a href="M-153%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-153</a> (Ford Road) in <a href="Canton%2C%20Michigan">Canton</a> to Schoolcraft Avenue (just south of the <a href="Interstate%2096">I-96</a> and <a href="M-14%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-14</a> interchange) in <a href="Plymouth%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Plymouth Township</a> by the start of 1975. The segment between US 24 and I-75 in Monroe County was open as well. The second phase was completed in the latter half of 1976, when I-275 was extended north from Schoolcraft Avenue (and the incomplete interchange with the future route of I-96) to the I-96/<a href="Interstate%20696">I-696</a> interchange in <a href="Novi%2C%20Michigan">Novi</a>. Then on January 14, 1977, the remaining section of I-275 between US 24 in Monroe County and M-153 in Canton Township was opened to traffic, completing the current freeway. The final cost to build the I-275 freeway was $145 million (equivalent to $ in ).

The Michigan State Highway Commission canceled the northern section of the highway, originally planned to continue northward from Novi to a point near <a href="Davisburg%2C%20Michigan">Davisburg</a> and <a href="Clarkston%2C%20Michigan">Clarkston</a>, on January 26, 1977, after it spent $1.6 million (equivalent to $ in ) the year before purchasing land for the roadway. This northern section was not planned as an Interstate Highway at that time, bearing the designation M-275 instead. Opposition to construction came from various citizens' groups and different levels of local government. Additionally, both "<a href="The%20Detroit%20News">The Detroit News</a>" and "<a href="Detroit%20Free%20Press">Detroit Free Press</a>" opposed the project. The <a href="Detroit%20City%20Council">Detroit City Council</a>, led by then-Chairman <a href="Carl%20Levin">Carl Levin</a>, opposed the plan. Levin said at the time, "At last I think people are waking up to the dangers of more and more expressways. At some point we've got to say enough. And I think we've reached it." The US Department of the Interior reviewed the state's environmental impact study of the project and stated that the project, "will cause irreparable damages on recreation lands, wetlands, surface waters and wildlife habitat". The total project to link Farmington Hills with Davisburg with the extension would have cost $69.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) and saved drivers an estimated eight minutes off travel time around the city of Detroit.

The Jeffries Freeway project was in its final stages of construction in 1977, linking the final of I-96 at <a href="M-39%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-39</a> (Southfield Freeway) with the I-275 freeway. After it was completed, I-96 was routed to run concurrently with I-275 between Novi and Plymouth Township, and the segments of freeway through Farmington and Farmington Hills that were to be part of I-96 instead became part of an extended <a href="M-102%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-102</a>.

At the end of the 1970s, MDOT took part in a FHWA-backed initiative called the Positive Guidance Demonstration Project, and the two agencies audited signage practices in the vicinity of the I-96/<a href="M-37%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-37</a> and <a href="Interstate%20296">I-296</a>/<a href="U.S.%20Route%20131">US 131</a> interchange in <a href="Walker%2C%20Michigan">Walker</a> near <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a>. MDOT determined that usage of the I-296 designation overlapping US 131 was "a potential source of confusion for motorists". FHWA agreed with the department's proposal to eliminate all signage and public map references to the designation in April 1979. MDOT then received formal permission from the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20and%20Transportation%20Officials">American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials</a> (AASHTO) on October 13, and from the FHWA on December 3, 1979, to remove the redundant highway designation from signage and most maps.

Following this program, the Reflective Systems Unit at MDOT reviewed the state of two- and three-way concurrencies along the highway system in Michigan. They approached the department's Trunkline Numbering Committee and the district traffic and safety engineers on October 19, 1982, for proposals to reduce or eliminate the various overlapping designations to "avoid driver confusion and save funds". Included on the initial discussion report was the I-96/I-275 concurrency with a request for comments by November 5 of that year. When the unit released its final recommendations on March 17, 1983, no changes were proposed regarding the I-96/I-275 concurrency. Other recommendations, such as removing <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20in%20Michigan">US 2</a> and <a href="U.S.%20Route%2010%20in%20Michigan">US 10</a> from overlaps with I-75 were implemented in later in 1983 and in 1985, respectively.

A least one transportation study in the early 1970s identified the highway north of Novi as M-275. The Oakland County Road Commission, local land developers, and local politicians supported building a highway along the route of M-275 to open up the area for development. After the January 1977 cancelation of M-275 as a full freeway, the state explored building the highway as a parkway instead. This parkway concept allowed at-grade intersections that would have not been permitted had the highway been built as a full freeway, and included more landscaping and less <a href="grade%20separation">grade separation</a>. In September 1977, the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Transportation%20Commission">State Transportation Commission</a> ordered MDOT to study alternatives to a freeway in the area, along with the possible widening of <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a> and <a href="U.S.%20Route%2023%20in%20Michigan">US 23</a> and the improvement of local roads to handle increased traffic caused by the absence of an extended I-275 from the state's freeway network.

The canceled highway project was revisited by the State Transportation Commission in 1979 as M-275. The renewed interest came after a vote of local residents showed a desire for the road. The Michigan Department of State Highways and Transportation backed the proposal with the support of local officials around the highway and the highway lobby. The 22-year-old proposal was deemed "necessary" by the department to alleviate highway congestion along other area highways. The Department of the Interior continued to oppose the highway on environmental grounds. M-275 would have cut through <a href="Dodge%20No.%204%20State%20Park">Dodge No. 4 State Park</a> in Oakland County if completed. Another factor that helped sink the project was the rising costs. Estimates in 1979 placed a $100 million (equivalent to $ in ) price tag on the project.

Despite funding increases for MDOT by the State Legislature, M-275 languished on the drawing boards. New plans in 1983 had addressed several of the environmental concerns by moving interchanges and rerouting around wetlands. These plans even canceled an extension of Northwestern Highway (then M-4, now part of <a href="M-10%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-10</a>) to Pontiac Trail and a connection with M-275. The state increased MDOT's budget by $602 million (equivalent to $ in ), but left the M-275 project off a priority list. The Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) continued to factor M-275 into regional <a href="transportation%20planning">transportation planning</a> forecasts. SEMCOG's position was that the location population that would be served by the new highway would rival 70 of Michigan's counties combined, yet there was no four-lane highways through the area. Opponents cited <a href="urban%20sprawl">urban sprawl</a>, which SEMCOG dismissed because the population was already in the area of the new highway. Transportation planners at an April 24, 1985, meeting of the West Bloomfield Republicans said that the highway extension "would make sense" but MDOT "is planning no new freeways and no major road construction" at the time. By the next month, MDOT had relinquished ownership of <a href="Right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a> in <a href="West%20Bloomfield%20Township%2C%20Michigan">West Bloomfield Township</a>, ending any further progress at building the roadway. Studies comparing the levels of traffic at various checkpoints along the existing I-275 showed that the freeway was only handling half of its rated capacity. At <a href="8%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BMile%20Road">8 Mile Road</a>, the freeway carried 57,000 vehicles in 1977 and 88,000 vehicles in 1984. This compared to a 1986 projection of 133,000 vehicles daily.

After many years of inactivity, further work began along this same route to relieve traffic congestion in the area, but the resulting highway was designated as a part of <a href="M-5%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-5</a> rather than I-275 or M-275. The first section of this freeway extension was opened in October 1994. This extended a freeway from I-275's previous terminus at I-96/I-696 north to 12 Mile Road. A plan enacted by then Governor <a href="John%20Engler">John Engler</a> in 1995 angered road officials when funding was diverted from county road commissions to help complete state highway projects like the M-5 (Haggerty Connector) project. In 1999, a second extension of M-5 was completed to 14 Mile Road, but only as an <a href="Limited-access%20road">expressway</a>. The final between 14 Mile Road and Pontiac Trail opened to traffic on November 1, 2002.

In the mid-1970s, MDOT constructed a <a href="Trail%23Bicycle%20trail">bike trail</a> parallel to I-275 in response to the <a href="1970s%20energy%20crisis">energy crisis</a>. Since 2006, the Michigan Trails & Greenway Alliance and MDOT have been working to improve the bike trail. At the time of the alliance's initial studies, the trail was overgrown with vegetation in locations. Since a grand re-opening in 2011, the bike path has been called the I-275 Metro Trail. In the middle of 2015, MDOT completed reconstruction of the bike trail, resulting in a paved trail from a junction with the Downriver Linked Greenways East–West Trail near South Huron Road in <a href="Huron%20Charter%20Township">Huron Township</a> northward to 12 Mile Road in Novi.

Interstate 675 (Michigan)

Interstate 675 (I-675) is an <a href="List%20of%20auxiliary%20Interstate%20Highways">auxiliary Interstate Highway</a> in the US state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. The freeway is a loop route through downtown <a href="Saginaw%2C%20Michigan">Saginaw</a>, as <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">I-75</a> passes on the east side of the city. I-675 is also a <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> that provided a bypass of the former drawbridge carrying I-75 and <a href="U.S.%20Route%2023%20in%20Michigan">US Highway 23</a> (US 23) across the <a href="Saginaw%20River">Saginaw River</a>. Construction of I-675 started in 1969 and the freeway opened in 1971. Since then, sections near downtown were reconstructed from 2009 through 2011 to update one of the freeway's interchanges and rebuild the bridge over the Saginaw River.

Splitting from I-75/US 23 on the eastern side of Saginaw, I-675 turns west toward downtown. The freeway runs between residential neighborhoods and has an interchange with Veterans Memorial Parkway. West of that interchange, it crosses a line of the <a href="Huron%20and%20Eastern%20Railway">Huron and Eastern Railway</a>. From there, it runs on the northern edge of downtown near the <a href="Dow%20Event%20Center">Dow Event Center</a>, spanning the <a href="Saginaw%20River">Saginaw River</a> on the <a href="Henry%20G.%20Marsh">Henry G. Marsh</a> Bridge. On the west side of the river, the trunkline meets an interchange with <a href="M-58%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-58</a>. From there it turns northward, crossing a line of the <a href="Mid-Michigan%20Railroad">Mid-Michigan Railroad</a>. I-675 continues northward, passing to the east of the and through more residential neighborhoods in <a href="Saginaw%20Township%20North%2C%20Michigan">Saginaw Township North</a>. After the interchange with Tittabawassee Road, which provides access to the <a href="Fashion%20Square%20Mall">Fashion Square Mall</a>, I-675 turns northeasterly to connect back to I-75/US 23 north of the <a href="Zilwaukee%20Bridge">Zilwaukee Bridge</a>. The entire length of the freeway has four lanes (two in each direction).
Like other state highways in Michigan, I-675 is maintained by the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT). In 2015, the department's traffic surveys showed that on <a href="average%20annual%20daily%20traffic">average</a>, 31,300 vehicles used the freeway daily across the river and 9,400 vehicles did so each day north of Tittabawassee Road, the highest and lowest counts along the trunkline, respectively. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-675 is listed on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.

I-675 was initially planned in the mid-1950s, and the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Highway%20Department">Michigan State Highway Department</a> (MSHD) originally proposed the number I-275 for the freeway through Saginaw in 1958, while the MSHD proposed an I-73 number for what is now <a href="Interstate%20275%20%28Michigan%29">I-275</a>. The state started construction on I-675 in 1969. The freeway was to provide access to the downtown Saginaw area and serve as a bypass for the original Zilwaukee Bridge northeast of downtown, roles that continue today. At the time, the Zilwaukee Bridge was a <a href="bascule%20bridge">bascule bridge</a> that could be raised to allow shipping traffic to use the Saginaw River. Opening the drawbridge would back traffic up on the freeway for up to four hours on holiday weekends. I-675 helped relieve the congestion during such times. The record was a traffic jam on Labor Day 1968, although backups were common until the shipping companies using the Saginaw River limited their traffic in 1970. The freeway was completed in 1971 and opened to traffic that year. After completion, the state considered reconstructing I-675 to make the downtown freeway the through routing for I-75/US 23 in the Saginaw area to bypass the bascule bridge. Originally to be completed in 1983, the replacement bridge on I-75/US 23 finally opened on September 19, 1988. The next year, southbound I-675 was used to divert traffic around a temporary closure on the southbound span of the Zilwaukee Bridge. At the same time, northbound I-675 was closed while crews replaced the deck on the bridge over the Saginaw River.

In 2002, the Zilwaukee Bridge was closed for a few months for joint repair work, and traffic was diverted onto I-675. The freeway through downtown was pressed back into service as a detour around the Zilwaukee Bridge for six months in 2008 as a mishap involving several steel reinforcement rods during a maintenance project closed that structure for an extended period of time. Then, starting in May 2009 and ending in November 2011, sections of I-675 were closed from exit 2 easterly to begin renovations during the summer construction seasons. These projects included rehabilitation of the Henry Marsh Bridge, the reconstruction of overpasses, and a redesigned exit at Warren Avenue to ease access into downtown Saginaw. The project cost $42 million (equivalent to $ in ).

SMS Schlesien

SMS "Schlesien" was one of five <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s built for the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy) between 1904 and 1906. Named after the German province of <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a>, "Schlesien" was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> at the <a href="Schichau-Werke">Schichau-Werke</a> shipyard in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> on 19 November 1904, <a href="Ship%20launching">launched</a> on 28 May 1906, and <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 5 May 1908. She was armed with a battery of four <a href="28%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">guns</a> and had a top speed of . The ships of her class were already outdated by the time they entered service, as they were inferior in size, armor, firepower, and speed to the revolutionary new British battleship .

After commissioning, "Schlesien" was assigned to <a href="I%20Battle%20Squadron">I Battle Squadron</a> of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>, later being transferred to <a href="II%20Battle%20Squadron">II Battle Squadron</a>. She was primarily occupied with training cruises and fleet maneuvers in her early career. She served with the fleet throughout the first two years of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, seeing action at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> on 31 May – 1 June 1916, where she was briefly actively engaged in combat. After Jutland, the Imperial Navy relegated "Schlesien" to guard duties before withdrawing her altogether in 1917, when she became a training ship. The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> permitted the German navy to keep eight obsolete battleships, including "Schlesien", to defend the German coast. Initially kept in reserve, she was modernized in the mid-1920s and saw extensive service with the reorganized "<a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a>".

"Schlesien" saw limited combat during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, briefly bombarding Polish forces during the <a href="invasion%20of%20Poland">invasion of Poland</a> in September 1939. She escorted minesweepers during <a href="Operation%20Weser%C3%BCbung">Operation "Weserübung"</a>, the invasion of Norway and Denmark in April 1940. After the operation, she was given secondary duties, primarily serving as a training ship and icebreaker. She ended her career providing fire support in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> coast of occupied Poland. While off <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a> on 3 May 1945, she struck a <a href="Naval%20mine">mine</a> and was towed into Swinemünde, where she was sunk by her crew in shallow water, though much of her superstructure, including her main battery, remained above water. In the remaining days of the war, "Schlesien" used her anti-aircraft guns to defend the city from air attack. After the end of the war, she was broken up, though some parts of the ship remained visible until the 1970s.

In 1900, the <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Second Naval Law</a> passed under the direction of "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" ("VAdm"Vice Admiral) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a>. The law secured funding for the construction of twenty new battleships over the next seventeen years. The first group, the five s, were laid down in the early 1900s. Shortly thereafter, design work began on a follow-up design, which became the . The "Deutschland"-class ships were broadly similar to the "Braunschweig"s, but featured incremental improvements in armor protection. They also abandoned the <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s for the secondary battery guns, moving them back to traditional <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s to save weight. The British battleship armed with ten 12-inch (30.5 cm) gunswas commissioned in December 1906. "Dreadnought"s revolutionary design rendered every capital ship of the German navy obsolete, including "Schlesien".

"Schlesien" was long, had a beam of , and a draft of . She <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> , and had a full-load displacement of . She was equipped with three <a href="triple%20expansion%20engine">triple expansion engine</a>s and twelve coal-fired <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s that produced a rated and a top speed of . In addition to being the fastest ship of her class, "Schlesien" was the most fuel efficient. At a cruising speed of , she could steam for . She had a standard crew of 35 officers and 708 enlisted men.

The ship's primary armament consisted of four <a href="28%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">28 cm SK L/40 gun</a>s in two twin turrets; one turret was placed forward and the other aft. She was also equipped with fourteen <a href="17%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">SK L/40</a> guns mounted in casemates and twenty guns in casemates. The ship was fitted with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all submerged in the hull. One was in the bow, one in the stern, and four on the <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. Her <a href="belt%20armor">armored belt</a> was thick <a href="amidships">amidships</a> and she had a armored deck. The main battery turrets had sides.

The contracts for the last two members of the "Deutschland" class, ordered under the contract names "R" and "Q", were awarded on 11 June 1904. "R" was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> on 19 November at the <a href="Schichau-Werke">Schichau</a> dockyard in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a>. She was <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> on 28 May 1906, at which time Duchess Mathilde of Pless christened her "Schlesien," after the province of <a href="Province%20of%20Silesia">Silesia</a>. Graf von Zedlitz Trützschler, the "<a href="Oberpr%C3%A4sident">Oberpräsident</a>" of Silesia, gave a speech at the launching ceremony. A shipyard crew took the ship from Danzig to <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> in March 1908 for her final <a href="fitting-out">fitting-out</a>. "Schlesien" was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> into the fleet on 5 May. She then began <a href="sea%20trials">sea trials</a>, which were delayed from 6 July to 5 September when the ship was temporarily used as a <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> testing ship in place of the <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a> , which had to go into drydock for an overhaul. By early September, "Vineta" had completed her overhaul, allowing "Schlesien" to join the fleet. She received her full crew on 22 September and thereafter joined <a href="I%20Battle%20Squadron">I Battle Squadron</a>.

The ships of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> embarked on a cruise into the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> that lasted from 7 July to 1 August. While on the way back to Germany, they were received by the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a>. In late 1909, Admiral <a href="Henning%20von%20Holtzendorff">Henning von Holtzendorff</a> became the new fleet commander. His tenure as fleet commander was marked by strategic experimentation, due to the threat the latest underwater weapons posed, and the fact that the new s were too wide to pass through the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a>. Accordingly, the fleet was transferred from Kiel to <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> on 1 April 1910. In May 1910, the fleet conducted training maneuvers in the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a>. These were in accordance with Holtzendorff's strategy, which envisioned drawing the Royal Navy into the narrow waters there. The annual summer cruise was to Norway, and was followed by fleet training, during which another fleet review was held in Danzig on 29 August. A training cruise into the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> took place at the end of the year.

In March 1911, the fleet conducted exercises in the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> and Kattegat. "Schlesien" and the rest of the fleet received British and American naval squadrons at Kiel in June and July. The year's autumn maneuvers were confined to the Baltic and the Kattegat, during which another fleet review was held in order to prepare for an Austro-Hungarian delegation that included <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand">Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> and Admiral <a href="Rudolf%20Montecuccoli">Rudolf Montecuccoli</a>. On 3 November 1911, "Schlesien" was transferred to <a href="II%20Battle%20Squadron">II Battle Squadron</a> with the rest of her sister ships; at this time, she transferred back to Kiel, where II Squadron was based. In mid-1912, due to the <a href="Agadir%20Crisis">Agadir Crisis</a>, the summer cruise was confined to the Baltic, to avoid exposing the fleet during the period of heightened tension with Britain and France. The fleet thereafter held the annual autumn maneuvers in August and September. A winter cruise in the Baltic followed at the end of the year. In 1913 the same uneventful pattern followed. On 14 July 1914, the annual summer cruise to Norway began. The threat of war during the <a href="July%20Crisis">July Crisis</a> forced Kaiser Wilhelm II to end the cruise after only two weeks; by the end of July the fleet was back in port.

"Schlesien" served with the High Seas Fleet through the first two years of the war. At the outbreak of the conflict, the ship was deployed to guard the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a>. She then rejoined the High Seas Fleet to support the battlecruisers that <a href="Raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby</a> on 15–16 December 1914. During the operation, the German battle fleet of 12 dreadnoughts and 8 pre-dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. Skirmishes between the rival <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> screens convinced Admiral <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Ingenohl">Friedrich von Ingenohl</a> that he was confronted with the entire <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>, and so he broke off the engagement and went back home. Two fruitless fleet advances followed on 17–18 and 21–23 April 1915. Another followed on 17–18 May, and another on 23–24 October. In March 1916, "Schlesien" was employed as a <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a> for <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s. On 24–25 April, "Schlesien" and her sisters joined the dreadnoughts of the High Seas Fleet to support the battlecruisers of the <a href="I%20Scouting%20Group">I Scouting Group</a> on a raid of the English coast. While en route to the target, the battlecruiser was damaged by a <a href="naval%20mine">mine</a>. The remaining battlecruisers conducted a short <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Yarmouth%20and%20Lowestoft">bombardment of the ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft</a>. The target's visibility was poor, so the operation was soon called off before the British fleet could intervene. Squadron exercises in the Baltic followed from 11 to 22 May.

Admiral Scheer immediately planned another foray into the North Sea, but the damage to "Seydlitz" delayed the operation until the end of May. "Schlesien" was the second ship in the IV Division of the II Battle Squadron under the command of Rear Admiral , positioned at the rear of the German line. During the ensuing operation, "Schlesien" was the second to last ship in the German line, followed only by her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> . During the "Run to the North," Admiral <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a>, the commander of the fleet, ordered the fleet to pursue the British V Battle Squadron at top speed. The slower "Deutschland"-class ships could not keep up with the faster dreadnoughts and quickly fell behind. By 19:30, the Grand Fleet had arrived on the scene and confronted Scheer with a large numerical superiority. The German fleet was severely hampered by the presence of the slower "Deutschland"-class ships; if Scheer ordered an immediate turn towards Germany, he would have to sacrifice the slower ships to make good his escape.

Scheer decided to reverse the course of the fleet with the "Gefechtskehrtwendung", a maneuver that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously. As they had fallen behind, the ships of the IIBattle Squadron could not conform to the new course following the turn. "Schlesien" and the other five ships of the squadron were, therefore, located on the disengaged side of the German line. Mauve considered moving his ships to the rear of the line, astern of the IIIBattle Squadron dreadnoughts, but decided against it when he realized the movement would interfere with the maneuvering of Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s battlecruisers. Instead, he attempted to place his ships at the head of the line.

Later on the first day of the battle, the hard-pressed battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group were being pursued by their British opponents. "Schlesien" and the other so-called "five-minute ships" came to their aid by steaming in between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons. "Schlesien" and her sisters could barely make out a target in the darkness. Due to the poor visibility their shooting was ineffective. The British battlecruisers scored several hits on the German ships; in the brief melee a near miss from a large-caliber gun sprayed shell splinters onto "Schlesien"s decks, killing one man and wounding another. Admiral Mauve ordered an <a href="Boxing%20the%20compass">8-point</a> turn to the south, and the British did not follow.

Late on the 31st, the fleet organized for the night return to Germany; "Schlesien" and "Schleswig-Holstein" fell in behind the mauled battlecruisers and at the rear of the line. British destroyers conducted a series of attacks against the fleet, some of which targeted "Schlesien". Regardless, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached <a href="Horns%20Rev">Horns Reef</a> by 4:00 on 1 June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later, where the undamaged dreadnoughts of the "Nassau" and es took up defensive positions.

After Jutland, "Schlesien" and her three surviving sisters returned to picket duty at the mouth of the Elbe, and in June and July "Schlesien" again served as a torpedo target ship for U-boats. The experience at Jutland demonstrated that pre-dreadnoughts had no place in a naval battle with dreadnoughts, and they were thus left behind when the High Seas Fleet sortied again <a href="Action%20of%2019%20August%201916">on 18 August</a>. From 31 January to 9 February 1917, she served in the <a href="Danish%20straits">Danish straits</a> as a guard ship, and also as an <a href="icebreaker">icebreaker</a>, after which she returned to the Elbe. From 2 May to 8 June, she was again used as a target ship in the Baltic. Her guard ship duties in the Elbe ended on 27 July, when she was withdrawn from service and converted into a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> for engine room personnel and new recruits. She served in this capacity from 20 August to 16 April 1918.

In late April, "Schlesien" was taken into the drydock at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Wilhelmshaven">"Kaiserliche Werft"</a> (Imperial Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven to be converted into a training ship for <a href="naval%20cadet">naval cadet</a>s. The ship's main and secondary battery guns were removed so they could be used ashore, leaving "Schlesien" equipped with a battery of and guns. She had made several training cruises in the Baltic by November 1918; she was in Kiel during the <a href="Kiel%20mutiny">Kiel mutiny</a> in the closing days of the war. On 5 November, she left the port still flying the Imperial German flag even after most of the other vessels in the port had hoisted the <a href="Red%20flag%20%28politics%29">red flag</a> of revolution. "Schlesien" initially went to <a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a>, but mutineers had already spread to the port, so on orders from the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Naval Office) she sailed instead to <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a>, where on 10 November her commander, "<a href="Fregattenkapit%C3%A4n">Fregattenkapitän</a>" (Frigate Captain) von Waldeye-Hartz hauled down his flag and placed his ship out of service. He and the crew remained aboard, and on 14 November they took the ship back to Kiel, where they were released from service on 20 November. She was used briefly again to train cadets to operate boilers and engines; on 1 December, she was again removed from service.

Following the German defeat in World War I, the German navy was reorganized as the "<a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a>" according to the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>. The new navy was permitted to retain eight pre-dreadnought battleships under —two of which would be in reserve—for coastal defense. "Schlesien" was one of the vessels retained under the terms of the treaty, but was initially kept in reserve, since she still carried the battery of just 10.5 cm and 8.8 cm guns. By the mid-1920s, two of the battleships still in active service, and , were becoming worn out and needed replacement. The replacements for the old battleships—the s—would not be ready for some time, and so the navy decided to rearm and modernize "Schlesien" in 1926–1927. Her original 28 cm guns were reinstalled, and a new secondary battery of guns were installed in the casemates for the old 17 cm guns. This included removing the fore funnel and ducting those boilers into an enlarged funnel, and installing a new heavy pole mast. The work was completed on 1 March 1927, and she thereafter entered service with the crew from "Hannover".

On joining the rest of the fleet, "Schlesien" became the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the Commander of the Naval Forces of the North Sea, "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" ("KAdm"—Rear Admiral) <a href="Alexander%20Werth%20%28Admiral%29">Alexander Werth</a>, which was renamed on 1 January 1930 the Commander of Battleships. She was based in Wilhelmshaven. In May 1927, <a href="President%20of%20Germany%20%281919%E2%80%931945%29">President</a> <a href="Paul%20von%20Hindenburg">Paul von Hindenburg</a> came to Wilhelmshaven to visit the fleet. The annual fleet maneuvers were conducted in August and September, as they had been in the prewar years, and they culminated in a <a href="naval%20review">naval review</a> on 14 September for Hindenburg. "KAdm" <a href="Wilhelm%20Prentzel">Wilhelm Prentzel</a> replaced Werth on 29 September and in October 1928 he was in turn replaced by "KAdm" <a href="Walther%20Franz">Walther Franz</a>. In the course of 1928, "Schlesien" went on a fleet cruise in the Atlantic in July and conducted shooting training in August with the old ironclad, now target ship, . Another Atlantic cruise followed in April and May 1929. In February 1930, Franz, who had by then been promoted to the rank of "vizeadmiral", turned command of the unit to "KAdm" <a href="Richard%20Foerster%20%28Admiral%29">Richard Foerster</a>. From 3 April to 6 June, "Schlesien" embarked on a major training cruise by herself to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, during which she visited <a href="Messina">Messina</a>, <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, where her senior officers met King <a href="Victor%20Emmanuel%20III%20of%20Italy">Victor Emmanuel III of Italy</a>.

In June 1931, "Schlesien" visited Norway. "<a href="Kommodore">Kommodore</a>" (Commodore) <a href="Max%20Bastian">Max Bastian</a> replaced Foerster in September 1932, and at the same time, "<a href="Kapit%C3%A4n%20zur%20See">Kapitän zur See</a>" (Captain at Sea) <a href="Wilhelm%20Canaris">Wilhelm Canaris</a>, who later served as chief of the "<a href="Abwehr">Abwehr</a>", took command of the ship, a position he would hold for the next two years. "Schlesien" made another trip into the Atlantic in January 1933, which included a stop in <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> from 6 to 9 January. On 10 December 1933, the new <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> replaced "Schlesien" as the flagship of the Commander of Battleships. "Schlesien" was converted back into a training ship for cadets between 18 February and 8 April 1935, and she was formally removed from the fleet organization on 30 September. Among the modifications were the installation of additional anti-aircraft guns and replacement of the ship's boilers. The newer boilers were more efficient, which allowed fewer of them to be used; the additional space this created was used as crew compartments for the cadets and an instruction room. The crew was also altered; the standard crew had been 35 officers and 708 enlisted men; after the conversion, this was reduced to 29 officers and 559 sailors, supplemented by 214 cadets. Over the course of the following three years, "Schlesien" embarked on several overseas training cruises as part of the Training Inspectorate. The first lasted from 1 December 1935 to 29 February 1936, and went to <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a> in the central Atlantic. More modernization work was done after her return to Germany, and from 12 October 1936 to 22 April 1937, she went on a tour of North, Central, and South America. Further cruises followed in October 1937, April 1938, and March 1939. During this period, her last coal-fired boilers were replaced with oil-fired models.

After the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> following the <a href="German%20invasion%20of%20Poland">German invasion of Poland</a> on 1 September 1939, "Schlesien" initially remained in her training ship role, though from 21 to 27 September she was used to bombard Polish artillery positions around <a href="Hel%2C%20Poland">Hela</a> and <a href="Jastarnia">Jastarnia</a>. After the operation, "Schlesien" had six of her 15 cm guns removed to arm the new surface raider . She then returned to training ship duties, and from January to March 1940 served as an icebreaker to allow U-boats to operate. She then escorted <a href="minesweeper">minesweeper</a>s in the <a href="Little%20Belt">Little Belt</a> in April during <a href="Operation%20Weser%C3%BCbung">Operation "Weserübung"</a>, the invasion of Norway and Denmark. She resumed training duties, but crew shortages forced the navy to deactivate the ship on 2 August, leaving only a <a href="skeleton%20crew">skeleton crew</a> aboard to maintain the ship's condition. In January 1941, she was reactivated to again serve as an icebreaker in the Baltic until 31 March, when she was again decommissioned in <a href="Gotenhafen">Gotenhafen</a>, thereafter being used as a stationary training <a href="hulk%20%28ship%29">hulk</a> with a skeleton crew.

As Germany began to prepare for war with the Soviet Union in early 1941, "Schlesien" was reactivated on 30 April to protect <a href="minelayer">minelayer</a>s along with "Schleswig-Holstein" as they laid a series of minefields in the Baltic to prevent the <a href="Soviet%20Baltic%20Fleet">Soviet Baltic Fleet</a> from attempting to break out to Britain. The Soviet fleet did not attempt to leave port after <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Germany invaded</a> in June, and so "Schlesien" was detached from the force guarding the minefields in October. She returned to Gotenhafen and resumed training duties there. Icebreaker service again summoned the vessel to active service from January to April 1942. On 4 April, "Schlesien" sailed to back Gotenhafen in company with the battleship and the icebreaker . "Schlesien" thereafter saw limited training duties in the Baltic in 1943 and 1944, owing to the increasingly limited supplies of fuel oil available to Germany by this stage in the war. During this period, her armament was revised several times. In 1943, a pair of twin anti-aircraft guns were installed, one on each side of her bridge. 

In early 1944, her anti-aircraft armament was strengthened considerably with the addition of two 40 mm guns and twenty guns; these were in two quadruple and six double mounts. Further enhancements were made later in the year, including with the installation of four heavy 10.5 cm anti-aircraft guns in place of the old 8.8 cm guns atop her after superstructure and two more of the guns abreast her bridge, these taking the place of the 37 mm guns, which were removed. The light anti-aircraft battery increased to seven or ten 40 mm guns in single and double mounts and eighteen or twenty-two 20 mm guns in double and quadruple mounts (sources differ on the exact number of guns). "Schlesien" was also equipped with a FuMO-25 search <a href="radar">radar</a> and a FuMB-6 radar detection set, both of which were installed on the foremast.

She was moved from Danzig to Gotenhafen and then to <a href="Sopot">Sopot</a> from 15 to 21 March 1945 to provide gunfire support to German forces in the area. She was then used to carry more than 1,000 wounded soldiers from Sopot to Swinemünde, where she also restocked her ammunition. She then remained in the port to shell the advancing Soviet <a href="2nd%20Shock%20Army">2nd Shock Army</a>. On 2 May, she was ordered to protect the bridge that connected <a href="Wolgast">Wolgast</a> and the island of <a href="Usedom">Usedom</a>. Early on the morning of 3 May, while steaming south of <a href="Greifswalder%20Oie">Greifswalder Oie</a>, she struck a British air-dropped <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>; the explosion killed two men and caused significant flooding. She was taken under tow by the destroyer back to Swinemünde, where her anti-aircraft guns could be used to help defend the city. The crew scuttled the ship there in shallow water so she could not be sunk by air attack and risk <a href="capsize">capsizing</a>. Between 1949 and 1956, the wreck was demolished and then scrapped "in situ" by an East German company. Some remains from the ship were still visible in 1970.

Final Fantasy XIII

Final Fantasy XIII is a science fiction <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a> developed and published by <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a> for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> consoles and later for the <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> operating system. Released in Japan in December 2009 and worldwide in March 2010, it is the thirteenth title in the mainline "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>" series. The game includes fast-paced <a href="Gameplay%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%23Parties%20and%20battles">combat</a>, a new system for the series for determining which abilities are developed for the characters called "Crystarium", and a customizable "Paradigm" system to control which abilities are used by the characters. "Final Fantasy XIII" includes elements from the previous games in the series, such as <a href="Final%20Fantasy%20character%20jobs%23Summoner">summoned monsters</a>, <a href="chocobo">chocobo</a>s, and <a href="Gameplay%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%23Airships%20and%20transport">airships</a>.

The game takes place in the fictional floating world of Cocoon, whose government, the Sanctum, is ordering a purge of civilians who have supposedly come into contact with Pulse, the much-feared world below. The former soldier <a href="Lightning%20%28Final%20Fantasy%29">Lightning</a> begins her fight against the government in order to save her sister who has been branded as an unwilling servant to a god-like being from Pulse, making her an enemy of Cocoon. Lightning is soon joined by a band of allies, and together the group also become marked by the same Pulse creature. They rally against the Sanctum while trying to discover their assigned task and whether they can avoid being turned into monsters or crystals at the completion.

Development began in 2004, and the game was first announced at <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) 2006. "Final Fantasy XIII" is the flagship title of the "<a href="Fabula%20Nova%20Crystallis%20Final%20Fantasy">Fabula Nova Crystallis</a>" collection of "Final Fantasy" games and is the first game to use Square Enix's <a href="Crystal%20Tools">Crystal Tools</a> engine. "Final Fantasy XIII" received mostly positive reviews from <a href="video%20game%20journalism">video game publications</a>, which praised the game's <a href="video%20game%20graphics">graphics</a>, presentation, and battle system. The game's story received a mixed response from reviewers, and its <a href="nonlinear%20gameplay">linearity</a> compared to previous games in the series was mostly criticized. Selling 1.7 million copies in Japan in 2009, "Final Fantasy XIII" became the fastest-selling title in the history of the series. As of 2017, the game has sold over 7 million copies worldwide on consoles. The Microsoft Windows version has sold over 746,000 copies according to SteamSpy. A sequel, titled "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XIII-2">Final Fantasy XIII-2</a>", was released in December 2011 in Japan and in February 2012 in North America and PAL regions. A second sequel, titled "", which concludes Lightning's story and the "Final Fantasy XIII" series, was released in November 2013 in Japan and in February 2014 in North America and PAL regions. In September 2014, Square Enix announced the "Final Fantasy XIII" series has been widely successful and has shipped over 11 million copies worldwide. In November, 2018, the series was added to Xbox One backwards compatibility.

The player directly controls the <a href="player%20character">on-screen character</a> through a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies throughout the game. The player can also turn the camera around the characters, which allows for a 360° view of the surroundings. The world of "Final Fantasy XIII" is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain, as found in the earlier "Final Fantasy" games, every area is represented proportionally. The player navigates the <a href="overworld">world</a> by foot or by <a href="chocobo">chocobo</a>. Players may save their game to a hard disk drive using save stations, where the player can also purchase items from retail networks or upgrade their weapons. An in-game datalog provides a <a href="bestiary">bestiary</a> and incidental information about the world of "Final Fantasy XIII". The "Final Fantasy XIII Ultimate Hits International" version of the game, released in Japan, also contains an "Easy" mode option.

As in "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XII">Final Fantasy XII</a>", enemies are integrated into the open field and can be approached or avoided by the player. When the player's character touches an enemy, the screen transitions from the regular map to a separate battle screen similar to those used in previous "Final Fantasy" titles. A maximum of three characters may be used in battles, which use a variant on the series' traditional <a href="Gameplay%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%23Parties%20and%20battles">Active Time Battle</a> (ATB) system first featured in "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20IV">Final Fantasy IV</a>". Under this system, the player selects an action from the <a href="menu%20%28computing%29">menus</a>, such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Unlike previous games in the series, the player only controls the lead character while the remaining two characters are controlled by the game's <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI). Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which continually refills to a set maximum number of slots. The ATB bar gradually increases in size throughout the game from two slots to six. The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions, or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of battle, and the characters' health is fully restored after each battle.

Each enemy has a meter, called a chain counter, consisting of a percentage starting at 100 which increases when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Attacks by different roles have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the chain counter resets. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it is applied to the enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy is placed into Stagger State. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and may be launched into the air. The Paradigm system allows the player to program six different roles which the characters can then assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to the specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, a <a href="Final%20Fantasy%20character%20jobs%23Warrior">warrior</a>-type role; Ravager, a <a href="Black%20Mage">black mage</a>-type role which uses damage-dealing magic; Medic, a <a href="Final%20Fantasy%20character%20jobs%23White%20Mage">White Mage</a>-type role which can heal and remove negative status ailments; Saboteur, which uses magic to weaken enemies by inflicting negative statuses; Synergist, which uses magic to strengthen allies by giving positive statuses; and Sentinel, which has protective and defensive abilities similar to a <a href="Final%20Fantasy%20character%20jobs%23Paladin">paladin</a>. Each of the characters can initially take on only three roles, but the player has access to all of them later in the game (although the other three roles are limited in their abilities for those players which choose them). The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters are using both outside and during battle, which is the only way that the player can control the AI characters during battle. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up beforehand outside of battle.

Each leader or controlled character can summon a specific Eidolon into battle. These <a href="Final%20Fantasy%20character%20jobs%23Summoner">summoned creatures</a> include series staples Odin, Shiva, Alexander, and Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr. When summoned, the Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party. While an Eidolon is summoned, the player can trigger a feature called Gestalt Mode, in which the Eidolon transforms into a different form and performs different attacks while the summoning character rides them.

The Crystarium is a leveling system consisting of six crystals and resembles the <a href="Sphere%20Grid">Sphere Grid</a> from "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X">Final Fantasy X</a>". Each crystal in the Crystarium represents one of the six Paradigms, and is divided into ten levels. Each level contains various nodes that supply bonuses to health, strength, or magic, or provide new abilities and accessory slots. These nodes are connected by a semi-linear path. The player may advance down the path by acquiring Crystarium Points, which are awarded after defeating enemies. The full Crystarium is not available to the player at the beginning of the game; at specific points in the game's plot, the player gains access to new crystals or levels.

"Final Fantasy XIII" is set on the world of Gran Pulse (often simply called Pulse). Central to the story is Cocoon, a massive artificial sphere that floats above Pulse's surface and is ruled by the Sanctum, a <a href="Theocracy">theocratic</a> government. The two worlds are controlled by fal'Cie , mechanical beings with godlike power. The Cocoon fal'Cie are responsible for keeping Cocoon floating, as well as providing light and water to the people that live inside. Each fal'Cie handles a specific task. The fal'Cie have the capability of marking the humans that live in Pulse and Cocoon as their servants. These servants, called l'Cie , are branded with a symbol representing either Pulse or Cocoon and are given a "Focus"—a task to complete. If the l'Cie complete their task in time, they are transformed to crystal and according to legend gain eternal life; otherwise they become mindless monsters called Cie'th . The l'Cie are not explicitly told their Focus, but are instead given visions that they must interpret.

Several hundred years before the events of the game, a battle known as the War of Transgression took place between Pulse and Cocoon. During the battle, l'Cie from Pulse attacked and ripped a large hole in Cocoon. Eventually, the l'Cie completed their focus and were turned to crystal. The hole was patched with material lifted from Pulse, and Cocoon's citizens have since lived in fear of another invasion; this fear is used by the Sanctum to remain in power. The Sanctum oversees two military branches: the Guardian Corps, responsible for keeping order on Cocoon, and the Public Security and Intelligence COMmand (PSICOM), the special forces in charge of dealing with any threat related to Pulse. The fal'Cie have given the humans advanced technology, including flying airships and mechanical creatures, and a form of magic also exists. This magic is normally only accessible to l'Cie, fal'Cie, and various monsters in Cocoon and Pulse, though distilled chemical forms can be used by normal humans through the use of Manadrives.

The six main playable characters of "Final Fantasy XIII" are <a href="Lightning%20%28Final%20Fantasy%29">Lightning</a>, the main protagonist of the game, a former soldier and older sister to Serah; <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Snow%20Villiers">Snow Villiers</a>, Serah's fiancé and leader of NORA, a paramilitary group; <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Oerba%20Dia%20Vanille">Oerba Dia Vanille</a>, the game's <a href="narrator">narrator</a> and an exile who is later revealed to be a l'Cie from Pulse; <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Sazh%20Katzroy">Sazh Katzroy</a>, a civilian pilot and father to a young boy, Dajh; <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Hope%20Estheim">Hope Estheim</a>, a young boy who is struggling within the relationships he shares with his parents; and <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Oerba%20Yun%20Fang">Oerba Yun Fang</a>, a l'Cie from Pulse who is working with the Sanctum's Cavalry branch. Other characters include <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Galenth%20Dysley">Galenth Dysley</a>, the ruler of the Sanctum and main antagonist; <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Cid%20Raines">Cid Raines</a>, a Sanctum Brigadier General in the Cavalry who does not trust the government; and <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Serah%20Farron">Serah Farron</a>, Lightning's younger sister and Snow's fiancée.

In Cocoon, the citizens of the town of Bodhum are being evicted, or Purged, after coming in contact with something from Pulse. Over the course of the game, the player is shown flashbacks of the events of the previous thirteen days, which began when a fal'Cie from Pulse was discovered near Bodhum. Lightning's sister Serah had found the fal'Cie from Pulse and been changed into a l'Cie by it. Lightning and Sazh derail a Purge train bound for Pulse in an attempt to save Serah. As Snow leads his resistance group NORA to rescue the Purge exiles, several of them are killed. Heading to the fal'Cie Anima to save Serah, Snow is joined by two of the exiles: Hope and Vanille. The two parties meet at the fal'Cie, and find Serah just as she turns to crystal. Anima then brands them as l'Cie and they are cast out into a different part of Cocoon. During this transformation, the newly crested l'Cie all have the same vision: a monster called Ragnarok. Arguing over the ambiguous nature of the dreamed Focus, the party finds Serah in her crystallized form; Snow remains with her as the others leave.

Snow meets Cid and Fang, two members of the Cavalry, after he is captured and detained aboard the <a href="airship">airship</a> "Lindblum". Meanwhile, the others flee from PSICOM before getting separated by an airstrike; Hope and Lightning travel to Palumpolum, while Sazh and Vanille travel to Nautilus. In Lightning's scenario, she unintentionally supports Hope's goal of killing Snow to avenge his mother's death. In Vanille's scenario, Sazh discusses how his son Dajh was turned into a l'Cie by a Cocoon fal'Cie and was taken by PSICOM to discover his Focus. In Palumpolum, Lightning attempts to dissuade Hope from going through with his revenge and meets Snow and Fang. Fang reveals that she and Vanille were l'Cie from Pulse who were turned into crystals; they were turned back into humans 13 days earlier, sparking the Purge. Hope attempts to murder Snow, but after being rescued during an airstrike, he decides not to go through with it. The four then flee the city with Cid's aid. In Nautilus, Vanille reveals herself to Sazh as a l'Cie from Pulse, and indirectly the reason that Dajh was turned into a l'Cie. Sazh and Vanille are then captured and detained on board the airship "Palamecia".

On the "Palamecia", the other members of the party reunite with Vanille and Sazh before they confront Galenth Dysley, the Sanctum's Primarch, who is the Cocoon fal'Cie ruler Barthandelus in disguise. Barthandelus tells the party that their Focus is to transform into the beast Ragnarok and slay the sleeping fal'Cie Orphan, who keeps Cocoon afloat above Pulse. Slaying Orphan will result in the destruction of Cocoon. The party flees and learns from Cid that the fal'Cie believe that Cocoon's destruction will summon the Maker, the creator of the worlds. The fal'Cie cannot harm Orphan themselves. Vanille and Fang reveal to the party that they were involved in the War of Transgression centuries earlier, and that their Focus then had been the same: to transform into Ragnarok and attempt to destroy Orphan. The party flies away to Pulse and journeys to Oerba, Vanille and Fang's hometown, where they hope to learn how to remove their l'Cie marks. The town is deserted, and they find no living people on the surface. The party is unsuccessful in removing their marks, and Barthandelus confronts them again. The party learns that Barthandelus has made Cid the new Primarch to create chaos in Cocoon to force the Cavalry to attack Cid and Orphan in a <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>.

The party infiltrates Cocoon and heads towards Orphan but soon discover that the Cavalry have been turned into Cie'th. The party defeats Barthandelus, but Orphan awakens and merges with Barthandelus, then compels Fang to finish her Focus as Ragnarok while the others are seemingly transformed into Cie'th. The party reappears in human form, preventing Fang from transforming. The party defeats Orphan and escapes Cocoon, which is now falling towards Pulse. As the rest of the party turns to crystal for completing their Focus, Vanille and Fang remain on Cocoon and transform into Ragnarok together to prevent a collision between Cocoon and Pulse. The rest of the party awaken from their crystallization on Pulse and find their l'Cie brands gone; Lightning, Hope, Snow and Sazh reunite with Serah and Dajh.

Development of "Final Fantasy XIII" began in February 2004, shortly after the release of "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X-2%20International%20%2B%20Last%20Mission">Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission</a>" in Japan. At the time, the project was internally referred to by the codename "Colors World". Over the first year, director <a href="Motomu%20Toriyama">Motomu Toriyama</a> and scenario conceptor <a href="Kazushige%20Nojima">Kazushige Nojima</a> conceived ideas for the plot. Nojima thought up the crystal mythology that became the basis for the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" series, including concepts such as the fal'Cie and l'Cie. Toriyama then created a story premised on this mythology. He wanted to portray "characters at the mercy of a predetermined, unjust fate" who "belong together but collide heavily". In order to achieve this, each of the story's thirteen chapters was made to focus on different protagonists. Chapters seven and eight were to mark a turning point in the interpersonal relationships of the party.

In March 2006, when the structural part of the narrative started to come together, lead scenario writer <a href="Daisuke%20Watanabe">Daisuke Watanabe</a> joined the team. Toriyama gave him a rough outline of the first eight chapters, which included several cornerstone scenes that needed to be kept, like when party members were separated or reunited. He told Watanabe what he wanted to express with the scenario, and asked him to flesh out the story and to strengthen how the points in his outline connected. For example, Toriyama's rudimentary instructions in the document would say "Snow and Hope reconcile". Watanabe had to decide about how the scenes with this reconciliation would play out, then write the scenario that way. To emphasize what the story tried to express, Watanabe adjusted the personalities Toriyama had given to each character. For example, he felt that the party should not have a "reliable and calm leader type" at the beginning of the story, in order to more accurately show the confusion and unease after the protagonists transform into l'Cie. Toriyama has said that one of the storytelling challenges was the despair of the characters and the many points at which they are seemingly cornered. He mentioned the scene where Sazh tries to commit suicide as one such example: Although Toriyama felt it was "almost a little too dark", he wanted to include something like it in the game. In contrast, he said that lighthearted elements such as Sazh's Chocobo chick helped maintain a good balance.

At the beginning of the development, the game was intended to be released on the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>. In May 2005, however, after the positive reception of the tech demo of "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VII">Final Fantasy VII</a>", the team decided to move the game to the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> and developed it with the new <a href="Crystal%20Tools">Crystal Tools</a> engine, a <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28seventh%20generation%29">seventh generation</a> multiplatform <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> created by Square Enix for its next generation games. Square Enix believed that developing a new engine would speed up development time later in the project, though it would initially cause a delay in the game's development. However, the delay was longer than originally anticipated as the engine had to accommodate the requirements of several other games in addition to "XIII". Another factor in the platform move was the delayed release of "Final Fantasy XII", which came out a very short time before the release of the PlayStation 3. A <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">PC</a> port was considered during development, but was decided against due to how Square Enix saw the video game market situation at the time as well as additional complexities that Square Enix did not have experience with related to the PC platform, such as security issues. "Final Fantasy XIII" was first shown at the 2006 <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3</a> convention. The <a href="trailer%20%28film%29">trailer</a> shown was an artistic concept that did not represent the final concept for the game, since at the time there was no playable form of the game. Announced alongside the game was "Final Fantasy Versus XIII", later retitled as "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XV">Final Fantasy XV</a>", and the <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> game "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20Type-0">Final Fantasy Type-0</a>", originally titled "Final Fantasy Agito XIII", the three of which form the "<a href="Fabula%20Nova%20Crystallis%20Final%20Fantasy">Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy</a>" series. Square Enix explained that although all three games are thematically linked, they are not directly related in terms of story.

The developers for "Final Fantasy XIII" were divided into multiple areas, with each developer or team focusing only on a specific task such as developing a specific in-game area or modeling characters. Each physical area of the game was developed separately; after an initial design was approved, teams were assigned to a specific location and filled in details without reusing assets from other areas. Several of the game's developers had worked on previous installments of the series. Director <a href="Motomu%20Toriyama">Motomu Toriyama</a> had worked on "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X">Final Fantasy X</a>" and "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X-2">X-2</a>"; producer <a href="Yoshinori%20Kitase">Yoshinori Kitase</a> had worked on "V" through "VIII" and as the producer for "X" and "X-2"; main-character designer <a href="Tetsuya%20Nomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a> had performed the same role for "VII", "VIII", "X", and "X-2", and battle-system director <a href="Toshiro%20Tsuchida">Toshiro Tsuchida</a> reprised that role from "Final Fantasy X". As "XIII" was the first "Final Fantasy" game for the PlayStation 3, the development team's internal goal was for the game to have the same "gameplay and craftmanship" impact that "Final Fantasy VII" and "X" had as the first games of the series on their respective consoles. They aimed to sell five million copies of the game. Toriyama wanted the game to be "the ultimate single player <a href="role-playing%20game%23single%20player">RPG</a>".

Tsuchida's concept for the battle system was to maintain the strategic nature of command-based battles. The system stemmed from a desire to create battles similar to those found in the film "". <a href="Magic%20point">Magic point</a>s (MP), which had been a part of the battle system in previous "Final Fantasy" titles, were removed in the game's battle system as Tsuchida and the other designers felt that it gave players an incentive to not use their most powerful magic attacks due to the MP cost, in turn making battles less interesting. The Paradigm system was designed early in the battle system's development, with the intent of making battles rely on quickly changing strategies and feel fast-moving. Originally there were only five roles, but the Saboteur was later added as the designers felt that its abilities were missing from the game and did not fit with the other roles. Together with the maximum of three characters in a combat situation, the groupings of enemies were designed to force the player to switch Paradigms to keep them engaged in the battles.

Toriyama wanted Lightning to be a new type of female character with an athlete's body and a less feminine nature than some of the previous female characters of the series. His guideline to Nomura was to make her "strong and beautiful", and she was intended to be reminiscent of "Final Fantasy VII"s <a href="Cloud%20Strife">Cloud Strife</a>. Fang was initially meant to be a male character, but the gender was changed to coincide with the updated character designs during the latter part of development. The graphics capabilities of the PS3 and Xbox 360 compared to previous consoles allowed Nomura to use more complex elements in the character designs than before, such as Lightning's cape and detailed facial features. This in turn meant that the art team had to do much more work for each character or area than in previous games. Nomura did not take an involved role in the creation of the <a href="3D%20interactive%20characters">non-playable characters</a>.

Unlike previous games in the series which were more inspired by Asian locations and culture, "Final Fantasy XIII" was intended by the art team to be reminiscent of the United States. Pulse was based on landscape photographs the team took from across the country, and Cocoon was intended to be a "<a href="melting%20pot">melting pot</a>" of different ethnicities. The setting was also given a <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> aesthetic to make it stand out more in comparison with other entries in the series. Art director <a href="Isamu%20Kamikokuryo">Isamu Kamikokuryo</a> revealed that many additional scenarios such as Lightning's home, which were functioning in an unreleased build during development, were left out of the final version due to concerns about the game's length and volume. Kamikokuryo said the content they cut was, in itself, enough to make another game. According to Toriyama, the cuts were made in "various stages of [the game's] development", and that some of the content was removed just before the game's completion. The game, unlike previous titles in the series, includes no explorable town areas; Toriyama said in an interview that the team was unable to make them as graphically appealing as the rest of the game and chose to eliminate them. Toriyama intended to have a piece of <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> available for the game that would include a new area, weapons and quests, but was forced to cut it as well due to quality concerns so late in the project and difficulties with the different systems for extra content on the two gaming consoles.

A playable demo of "Final Fantasy XIII" was included in the Japanese version of "", released on April 16, 2009. Toriyama stated that the release of the demo, which was not in the original development schedule, helped the team recognize a shared vision for what the game should look and feel like, a problem which had been plaguing the development team up until then. It helped the team prioritize the work that still needed to be done, which increased the development speed for the remainder of the project. The game was intended to appeal to both Western and Japanese audiences, and focus groups from both regions were used. The English <a href="Language%20localisation">localization</a> began while development was still in progress to lessen the delay between the Japanese and worldwide releases. The game was initially going to be released solely for the PlayStation 3, but an Xbox 360 version was announced late in the game's development cycle. The Xbox version, due to technical limitations, runs at a lower resolution (720p maximum) than the PlayStation version and is spread across 3 discs.

<a href="Masashi%20Hamauzu">Masashi Hamauzu</a> composed the game's soundtrack; his previous work on the series was as a co-composer for "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X">Final Fantasy X</a>" and as the main composer for "". The game was the first main-series "Final Fantasy" game to not include any compositions by original series composer <a href="Nobuo%20Uematsu">Nobuo Uematsu</a>. Although Uematsu was originally announced to compose the main theme of the game, this role was taken over by Hamauzu after Uematsu signed on to compose the soundtrack to "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XIV%20%282010%20video%20game%29">Final Fantasy XIV</a>". The score features some pieces orchestrated by <a href="Yoshihisa%20Hirano">Yoshihisa Hirano</a>, Toshiyuki Oomori, and Kunihito Shiina, with the <a href="Warsaw%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. The song "<a href="My%20Hands">My Hands</a>", from British singer <a href="Leona%20Lewis">Leona Lewis</a>' second album "<a href="Echo%20%28Leona%20Lewis%20album%29">Echo</a>", was chosen to replace "Final Fantasy XIII"'s original theme song, "<a href="Kimi%20ga%20Iru%20Kara%20%28Sayuri%20Sugawara%20song%29">Kimi ga Iru Kara</a>" by <a href="Sayuri%20Sugawara">Sayuri Sugawara</a>, for the game's international release. Square Enix president <a href="Yoichi%20Wada">Yoichi Wada</a> later said that it would have been better if the American branch of the company had produced a theme song from scratch, but a lack of staff led to the decision of licensing an existing song.

Music from the game has been released in several albums. Square Enix released the main soundtrack album, "Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack", on four <a href="Compact%20Disc">Compact Disc</a>s in 2010. The album sold 16,000 copies the day of its release. Square Enix released selections from the soundtrack on two <a href="gramophone%20record">gramophone record</a> albums in 2010: "W/F: Music from Final Fantasy XIII" and "W/F: Music from Final Fantasy XIII Gentle Reveries". An album of arranged pieces from the soundtrack, "Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack -PLUS-", was also released by Square Enix in 2010, as was an album of piano arrangements. <a href="For%20Life%20Music">For Life Music</a> published a single of the theme song for the Japanese version of the game, "Kimi ga Iru Kara" (君がいるから, "Because You're Here"), in 2009.

The game was released in Japan on December 17, 2009, and in North America, Europe and Australia on March 9, 2010. Alongside the release of the game in Japan, Japanese alcoholic beverage distributor <a href="Suntory">Suntory</a> released the "Final Fantasy XIII Elixir" to promote the game. On the same day, a "Final Fantasy XIII" <a href="PlayStation%20Home">PlayStation Home</a> personal space was made available for free in Japan until January 13, 2010, along with a costume and personal space furnishings; they were released to the Asian, European, and North American versions of PlayStation Home on March 11, 2010. On December 18, 2012, the game was re-released as part of the "Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box" Japanese package. It was re-released again on November 21, 2013, as part of the Lightning Ultimate box, a Japan exclusive edition which includes "Final Fantasy XIII" and its two sequels.

The game was released bundled with consoles in different regions. The game was bundled in Japan with a limited-edition white PlayStation 3 with a pink color print of Lightning on the surface of the console, and with an Xbox 360 with the silver strip on the hard drive emblazoned with the "Final Fantasy XIII" logo in the western release. A limited quantity of themed Xbox faceplates created by Nomura were made available through a select few retailers in Europe, North America, and Australia. <a href="PAL">PAL</a> territories received a limited collector's edition of the game for both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, with the "Final Fantasy XIII Original Sound Selection" "best of" soundtrack CD, three Eidolon art prints, a "Brand of the l'Cie" decal and "The World of Final Fantasy XIII", a hardback book featuring character artwork, CG-rendered artwork, and environments from across the game production. Square Enix published three <a href="List%20of%20Square%20Enix%20companion%20books%23Ultimania">Ultimania</a> books: the "Final Fantasy XIII Scenario Ultimania" and the "Final Fantasy XIII Battle Ultimania" on January 28, 2010, and the "Final Fantasy XIII Ultimania Ω" on September 30, 2010. The "Battle Ultimania" provides a description and analysis of the new battle system and its components, and developer interviews. The "Scenario Ultimania" describes the main scenarios in the game, profiles on the characters and areas in Cocoon and Gran Pulse, developer interviews, and details on each location. The last guide, the "Ultimania Ω", includes <a href="voice%20acting">voice actor</a> and additional staff interviews, the complete story of "Final Fantasy XIII" including additional character profiles, a collection of artworks and illustrations, and additional dissections of the story and background.

While the game was released on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in western regions, the game was a PlayStation 3 exclusive in Asian territories. This was changed in late 2010 when Square Enix announced that the Xbox 360 version would in fact release in Japan, despite many statements to the opposite. It was later released for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> via <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a>, along with its two sequels. "Final Fantasy XIII" was the first game in the series to receive an official release in Chinese and Korean. This was the first edition of a "Final Fantasy" game in which Japanese voice-overs could be enabled. An <a href="international%20version">international version</a> of the game for the Xbox 360 called "Final Fantasy XIII Ultimate Hits International" was released in Asia on December 16, 2010. The game includes an "Easy" mode option, and features the English voices. It comes with a bonus booklet titled "Final Fantasy XIII Corridor of Memory" that contains content that was previously left out of the original version of the game and a short story epilogue titled "Final Fantasy XIII Episode I".

"Final Fantasy XIII" was released for <a href="iOS">iOS</a> and <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> devices via cloud streaming in Japan on April 10, 2015.

"Final Fantasy XIII" sold over one million units on its first day of sale in Japan, and had sold 1.7 million copies for the PlayStation 3 in Japan by the end of 2009, and 1.9 million by the end of 2010. Square Enix had anticipated high initial sales for the game and shipped close to two million units for its launch. The game sold more than one million copies in North America in its release month. In March 2010, Square Enix stated that "Final Fantasy XIII" was the fastest-selling title in the franchise's history. By April of the same year, American game sales for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 reached an estimated 800,000 and 500,000 units respectively. According to <a href="Media%20Create">Media Create</a>, <a href="Women%20and%20video%20games">female gamers</a> accounted for nearly a third of the game's Japanese fanbase. As of July 2012, a combined total of 9.7 million units has been sold on consoles for both "Final Fantasy XIII" and its sequel "Final Fantasy XIII-2". As of January 2013, the game had sold 6.6 million copies worldwide. In September 2014, Square Enix announced the "Final Fantasy XIII" series has been widely successful and has shipped over 11 million copies worldwide. As of 2017, the game has sold over 7 million copies worldwide on consoles. By April 2018, the Windows version has sold over 746,000 copies according to SteamSpy.

"Final Fantasy XIII" received generally positive reviews. <a href="Review%20aggregator">Review aggregator</a> website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> gave the PlayStation 3 version 83/100 based on 83 reviews, the Xbox 360 version 82/100 based on 54 reviews, and the Microsoft Windows version 65/100 based on 6 reviews. It was rated 39 out of 40 by the Japanese gaming magazine "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>". "<a href="Dengeki%20PlayStation">Dengeki</a>" praised the game for the battle system, stating that the battles are by far the most exciting in the series, and concluded "Final Fantasy XIII" deserved a score of 120, as 100 would not be enough. The game was voted as the second best game of 2009 in Dengeki Online's reader poll, and in January 2010, it was voted the best game ever in "Famitsu" reader poll. The game received a Best RPG of the year award nomination at the <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>, but lost to "<a href="Mass%20Effect%202">Mass Effect 2</a>". It won the "Future Division" award at the Japan Game Awards 2009 and later won a Game Designers Award at the Japan Game Awards 2010.

Universal praise was given to the technical milestones achieved by the game's graphics and presentation. "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" felt that Cocoon in particular was an "inspired setting [...] blessed with a vibrancy and vivid colour that often leaves you open-mouthed". <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> called the art design "magnificent". Further praise was given to the <a href="cutscene">pre-rendered animation sequences</a> and the almost seamless transition of visual quality between these and the realtime gameplay. Many also appreciated the game's soundtrack, with Masashi Hamauzu providing "a score with catchy hooks and blood-pumping battle melodies", according to "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>".

The battle system of "Final Fantasy XIII" received widespread praise. The increased pace of battles was appreciated, with several reviews describing it as "thrilling"; "Edge"s description of the battle system summarized it as "among the genre's finest". <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> said that "Despite the fact that two-thirds of your party is AI-controlled, FFXIII's battles may be the most involving the series has ever seen." The story got a mixed reception, with "Wired" remarking that the plot was "a little more human and less esoteric than in previous games". 1UP.com felt that the story was "hardly world-class writing", but that the writers clearly knew the medium well and had attempted to avoid clichés. Reviewers felt that the characters worked well together, and that the interactions among them as the game progressed made up for shortcomings in the story.

While critics generally praised Square Enix's attempt to revitalize the "Final Fantasy" series formula, many reacted negatively to the linear nature of the game, especially in the first ten chapters on Cocoon, an issue which many felt was compounded by the large reduction of towns, free-roaming capabilities, and interaction with non-player characters. "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" described the gameplay as "a long hallway toward an orange target symbol on your mini-map that triggers a cutscene, a boss fight, or both," and 1UP.com criticized the linear aspect as the game's "biggest shortcoming", and felt the first section was "superficial." "Edge" and others awarded the game especially lower scores as a result of these aspects, with "Edge" in particular lowering the score they awarded the game to a five out of ten primarily due to the game's linear nature.

In contrast, reviewers from <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> and "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" appreciated the linear nature; the former stated that "the streamlined, focused structure eliminates potential tedium without dumbing anything down", while the latter felt it was "a clever move", and kept the player from being "[bogged] down with mundane number crunching, [and] finicky and repetitive leveling-up." Many negatively noted the gradual unfurling of the player's abilities over this first part of the game, from battle gameplay to selecting the party leader. Combined with the game's linear nature, some reviews went as far as to describe these chapters as "boring" until the world of Gran Pulse was revealed. "Edge" noted that while it did not do enough to make up for the opening chapters, at Gran Pulse the game "hits a sweet spot" as the narrative offers "hunting side-quests and the simple joy of exploring to see what visual marvel is around the next corner."

After release, director Motomu Toriyama felt that the lower-than-expected review scores for a main "Final Fantasy" series game came from reviewers who approached the game from a Western point of view. These reviewers were used to games in which the player was given an <a href="open%20world">open world</a> to explore, he said, noting that this expectation contrasted with the vision the team set out to create. He noted that it "becomes very difficult to tell a compelling story when you're given that much freedom". Yoshinori Kitase stated that they "didn't really intend to work within the RPG template," but "wanted to create a new game, even a new genre." He stated that "in a lot of senses FFXIII is more like an <a href="First-person%20shooter">FPS</a> than an RPG."

Toriyama and Kitase later said, in July 2011, that the biggest complaints about the game were that it was too linear and that there was not enough interaction between the player and the world, which they described as a lack of towns and <a href="Minigames%20of%20Final%20Fantasy">minigames</a> compared to the previous "Final Fantasy" games. They also named the amount of time it took to access all of the gameplay elements as a common criticism, saying that people interpreted it as a "lengthy tutorial".

<a href="Yoichi%20Wada">Yoichi Wada</a>, then-president of Square Enix, made his thoughts about the reception of the game known to <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a>. He said "some value it highly and some are not very happy with it". He added, "Should "Final Fantasy" become a new type of game or should "Final Fantasy" not become a new type of game? The customers have different opinions. It's very difficult to determine which way it should go."

Square Enix released a Microsoft Windows port of the game in October 2014, where it was met with a more critical reception than the original versions. "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>"s Samuel Roberts, when reviewing the port, criticized not only the original gameplay, but heavily criticized the quality of the port itself, decrying the low resolution, limited graphical options and low framerate. He was especially critical of the time taken for the port given that an unofficial patch was produced by <a href="mod%20%28video%20gaming%29">modder</a> Peter Thoman within a day of release that fixed many of the issues. Michael McWhertor of <a href="Polygon%20%28website%29">Polygon</a> also noted a similar critical response by consumers. A patch was released by Square Enix in December 2014, which was noted by Thoman as adding only the graphical features that his external patch had, with no other additions or performance improvements.

At the Square Enix First Production Department Conference held on January 18, 2011, Square Enix announced that they were developing a direct sequel to "Final Fantasy XIII", entitled "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XIII-2">Final Fantasy XIII-2</a>", which they intended to build on the game's story and characters while taking on board the criticism and other feedback about the original. It was released on December 15, 2011, in Japan, January 31, 2012, in North America and February 3, 2012, in Europe, for both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. Motomu Toriyama and Yoshinori Kitase returned to their respective roles as director and producer. The game begins three years after the events of "Final Fantasy XIII", and features Serah and newcomer Noel as the main protagonists. "XIII-2" is the fifth sequel game in the "Final Fantasy" series, after "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X-2">Final Fantasy X-2</a>", "", "", and "". Most of the team returned again to create a second sequel entitled "", meant to wrap up the story of Lightning and the "Final Fantasy XIII" universe. The game was released in November 2013 in Japan and in February 2014 in North America and Europe. Toriyama stated in the "<a href="List%20of%20Square%20Enix%20companion%20books">Ultimania Omega</a>" companion book prior to "XIII-2"s announcement that he hoped to write a story "where Lightning ends up happy", though at the time Square Enix had no plans to make a sequel.

Kreutz sungrazer

The Kreutz sungrazers (, pronounced kroits) are a family of <a href="sungrazing%20comet">sungrazing comet</a>s, characterized by <a href="orbit">orbit</a>s taking them extremely close to the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> at <a href="perihelion">perihelion</a>. They are believed to be fragments of one large <a href="comet">comet</a> that broke up several centuries ago and are named for German <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a> <a href="Heinrich%20Kreutz">Heinrich Kreutz</a>, who first demonstrated that they were related. A Kreutz sungrazers's <a href="aphelion">aphelion</a> is about 170 <a href="Astronomical%20Unit">AU</a> from the Sun; these sungrazers make their way from the distant outer Solar System from a patch in the sky in <a href="Canis%20Major">Canis Major</a>, to the inner Solar System, to their perihelion point near the Sun, and then leave the inner Solar System in their return trip to their aphelion.

Several members of the Kreutz family have become <a href="great%20comet">great comet</a>s, occasionally visible near the Sun in the daytime sky. The most recent of these was <a href="Comet%20Ikeya%E2%80%93Seki">Comet Ikeya–Seki</a> in 1965, which may have been one of the brightest comets in the last <a href="millennium">millennium</a>. It has been suggested that another cluster of bright Kreutz system comets may begin to arrive in the inner Solar System in the next few years to decades.

Many hundreds of smaller members of the family, some only a few meters across, have been discovered since the launch of the <a href="Solar%20and%20Heliospheric%20Observatory">SOHO</a> satellite in 1995. None of these smaller comets have survived its perihelion passage. Larger sungrazers such as the <a href="Great%20Comet%20of%201843">Great Comet of 1843</a> and <a href="C/2011%20W3%20%28Lovejoy%29">C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy)</a> have survived their perihelion passage. <a href="Amateur%20astronomy">Amateur astronomer</a>s have been successful at discovering Kreutz comets in the data available in real time via the <a href="Internet">Internet</a>.

The first comet whose orbit had been found to take it extremely close to the Sun was the <a href="C/1680%20V1">Great Comet of 1680</a>. This comet was found to have passed just 200,000 km (0.0013 <a href="Astronomical%20unit">AU</a>) above the Sun's surface, equivalent to around a seventh of Sun's diameter, or about half the distance between the <a href="Earth">Earth</a> and the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>. It thus became the first known <a href="sungrazing%20comet">sungrazing comet</a>. Its perihelion distance was just 1.3 <a href="Solar%20radius">solar radii</a>.

Astronomers at the time, including <a href="Edmond%20Halley">Edmond Halley</a>, speculated that this comet was a return of a bright comet seen close to the Sun in the sky in 1106. 163 years later, the <a href="Great%20Comet%20of%201843">Great Comet of 1843</a> appeared and also passed extremely close to the Sun. Despite orbital calculations showing that it had a period of several centuries, some astronomers wondered if it was a return of the 1680 comet. A bright comet seen in 1880 was found to be travelling on an almost identical orbit to that of 1843, as was the subsequent <a href="Great%20Comet%20of%201882">Great Comet of 1882</a>. Some astronomers suggested that perhaps they were all one comet, whose orbital period was somehow being drastically shortened at each perihelion passage, perhaps by retardation by some dense material surrounding the Sun.

An alternative suggestion was that the comets were all fragments of an earlier Sun-grazing comet. This idea was first proposed in 1880, and its plausibility was amply demonstrated when the Great Comet of 1882 broke up into several fragments after its perihelion passage. In 1888, Heinrich Kreutz published a paper showing that the comets of 1843 (C/1843 D1, the Great March Comet), 1880 (C/1880 C1, the Great Southern Comet), and 1882 (C/1882 R1, Great September Comet) were probably fragments of a giant comet that had broken up several orbits before. The comet of 1680 proved to be unrelated to this family of comets.

After another Kreutz sungrazer was seen in 1887 (C/1887 B1, the <a href="Great%20Southern%20Comet%20of%201887">Great Southern Comet of 1887</a>), the next one did not appear until 1945. Two further sungrazers appeared in the 1960s, <a href="Comet%20Pereyra">Comet Pereyra</a> in 1963 and <a href="Comet%20Ikeya%E2%80%93Seki">Comet Ikeya–Seki</a>, which became extremely bright in 1965, and broke into three pieces after its perihelion. The appearance of two Kreutz Sungrazers in quick succession inspired further study of the dynamics of the group.

The group generally has an <a href="Inclination">Inclination</a> of roughly 140 degrees, a perihelion distance of around 0.01 AU, and a <a href="Longitude%20of%20ascending%20node">Longitude of ascending node</a> of 340–10°.

The brightest members of the Kreutz sungrazers have been spectacular, easily visible in the daytime sky. The three most impressive have been the <a href="Great%20Comet%20of%201843">Great Comet of 1843</a>, the <a href="Great%20Comet%20of%201882">Great Comet of 1882</a> and <a href="Comet%20Ikeya%E2%80%93Seki">Comet Ikeya–Seki</a>. Another notable Kreutz sungrazer was the Eclipse Comet of 1882 (see further below).

The Great Comet of 1843 was first noticed in early February of that year, just over three weeks before its perihelion passage. By February 27 it was easily visible in the daytime sky, and observers described seeing a tail 2–3° long stretching away from the Sun before being lost in the glare of the sky. After its perihelion passage, it reappeared in the morning sky, and developed an extremely long tail. It extended about 45° across the sky on March 11 and was more than 2° wide; the tail was calculated to be more than 300 million kilometers (2 AU) long. This held the record for the longest measured cometary tail until 2000, when <a href="Comet%20Hyakutake">Comet Hyakutake</a>'s tail was found to stretch to some 550 million kilometers in length. (The Earth–Sun distance—1 AU—is only 150 million kilometers.)

The comet was very prominent throughout early March, before fading away to almost below <a href="naked%20eye">naked eye</a> visibility by the beginning of April. It was last detected on April 20. This comet apparently made a substantial impression on the public, inspiring in some a fear that judgement day was imminent.

A party of observers gathered in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> to watch a <a href="Solar%20eclipse%20of%20May%2017%2C%201882">solar eclipse in May 1882</a> were greatly surprised when they observed a bright streak near to the Sun once totality began. By a remarkable coincidence, the eclipse had coincided with the perihelion passage of a Kreutz comet. The comet would otherwise have gone unnoticed — its sighting during the eclipse was the only observation of it. Photographs of the eclipse revealed that the comet had moved noticeably during the 1m50s eclipse, as would be expected for a comet racing past the Sun at almost 500 km/s. The comet is sometimes referred to as "Tewfik", after <a href="Tewfik%20Pasha">Tewfik Pasha</a>, the <a href="Khedive%20of%20Egypt">Khedive of Egypt</a> at the time.

The <a href="Great%20Comet%20of%201882">Great Comet of 1882</a> was discovered independently by many observers, as it was already easily visible to the naked eye when it appeared in early September 1882, just a few days before perihelion. It grew rapidly brighter and was eventually so bright it was visible in the daytime for two days (16–17 September), even through light cloud.

After its perihelion passage, the comet remained bright for several weeks. During October, its nucleus was seen to fragment into first two and then four pieces. Some observers also reported seeing diffuse patches of light several degrees away from the nucleus. The rate of separation of the fragments of the nucleus was such that they will return about a century apart, between 670 and 960 years after the break-up.

Comet Ikeya–Seki is the most recent very bright Kreutz sungrazer. It was discovered independently by two <a href="Japan">Japan</a>ese amateur astronomers on September 18, 1965, within 15 minutes of each other, and quickly recognised as a Kreutz sungrazer. It brightened rapidly over the following four weeks as it approached the Sun, and reached <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 2 by October 15. Its perihelion passage occurred on October 21, and observers across the world easily saw it in the daytime sky. A few hours before perihelion passage on October 21 it had a visible magnitude from −10 to −11, comparable to the <a href="lunar%20phase">first quarter</a> of the <a href="Moon">Moon</a> and brighter than any other comet seen since 1106. A day after perihelion its magnitude decreased to just −4.

Japanese astronomers using a <a href="coronagraph">coronagraph</a> saw the comet break into three pieces 30 minutes before perihelion. When the comet reappeared in the morning sky in early November, two of these nuclei were definitely detected with the third suspected. The comet developed a very prominent tail, about 25° in length, before fading throughout November. It was last detected in January 1966.

A study by <a href="Brian%20G.%20Marsden">Brian G. Marsden</a> in 1967 was the first attempt to trace back the orbital history of the group to identify the progenitor comet. All known members of the group up until 1965 had almost identical <a href="orbital%20inclination">orbital inclination</a>s at about 144°, as well as very similar values for the <a href="longitude">longitude</a> of <a href="perihelion">perihelion</a> at 280–282°, with a couple of outlying points probably due to uncertain orbital calculations. A greater range of values existed for the <a href="argument%20of%20periapsis">argument of perihelion</a> and <a href="longitude%20of%20the%20ascending%20node">longitude of the ascending node</a>.

Marsden found that the Kreutz sungrazers could be split into two groups, with slightly different orbital elements, implying that the family resulted from fragmentations at more than one perihelion. Tracing back the orbits of Ikeya–Seki and the Great Comet of 1882, Marsden found that at their previous perihelion passage, the difference between their orbital elements was of the same order of magnitude as the difference between the elements of the fragments of Ikeya–Seki after it broke up. This meant it was realistic to presume that they were two parts of the same comet which had broken up one orbit ago. By far the best candidate for the progenitor comet was that seen in 1106 (<a href="Great%20Comet%20of%201106">Great Comet of 1106</a>): Ikeya–Seki's derived orbital period gave a previous perihelion almost exactly at the right time, and while the Great Comet of 1882's derived orbit implied a previous perihelion a few decades later, it would only require a small error in the orbital elements to bring it into agreement.

The Sun-grazing comets of 1668, 1689, 1702 and 1945 seem to be closely related to those of 1882 and 1965, although their orbits are not well enough determined to establish whether they broke off from the parent comet in 1106, or the previous perihelion passage before that, some time in the 3–5th centuries AD. This subgroup of comets is known as Subgroup II. <a href="Comet%20White%E2%80%93Ortiz%E2%80%93Bolelli">Comet White–Ortiz–Bolelli</a>, which was seen in 1970, is more closely related to this group than Subgroup I, but appears to have broken off during the previous orbit to the other fragments.

The Sun-grazing comets observed in 1843 (Great Comet of 1843) and 1963 (<a href="Comet%20Pereyra">Comet Pereyra</a>) seem to be closely related and belong to the subgroup I, although when their orbits are traced back to one previous perihelion, the differences between the orbital elements are still rather large, probably implying that they broke apart from each other one revolution before that. They may not be related to the comet of 1106, but rather a comet that returned about 50 years before that. Subgroup I also includes comets seen in 1695, 1880 (Great Southern Comet of 1880) and in 1887 (Great Southern Comet of 1887), as well as the vast majority of comets detected by the SOHO mission (see below).

The distinction between the two sub-groups is thought to imply that they result from two separate parent comets, which themselves were once part of a 'grandparent' comet which fragmented several orbits previously. One possible candidate for the grandparent is a comet observed by <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and <a href="Ephorus">Ephorus</a> in 371 BC. Ephorus claimed to have seen this comet break into two. However modern astronomers are skeptical of the claims of Ephorus, because they were not confirmed by other sources. Instead comets that arrived between 3rd and 5th centuries AD (comets of 214, 426 and 467) are considered as possible progenitors of the Kreutz family. The original comet must certainly have been very large indeed, perhaps as large as 100 km across (for comparison, the nucleus of <a href="Comet%20Hale%E2%80%93Bopp">Comet Hale–Bopp</a> was about 40 km across).

Although its orbit is rather different from those of the main two groups, it is possible that the comet of 1680 is also related to the Kreutz sungrazers via a fragmentation many orbits ago.

The Kreutz sungrazers are probably not a unique phenomenon. Studies have shown that for comets with high orbital inclinations and perihelion distances of less than about 2 AU, the cumulative effect of gravitational perturbations tends to result in sungrazing orbits. One study has estimated that Comet Hale–Bopp has about a 15% chance of eventually becoming a Sun-grazing comet.

Until recently, it would have been possible for even a very bright member of the Kreutz sungrazers to pass through the inner Solar System unnoticed, if its perihelion had occurred between about May and August. At this time of year, as seen from <a href="Earth">Earth</a>, the comet would approach and recede almost directly behind the Sun, and could only become visible extremely close to the Sun if it became very bright. Only a remarkable coincidence between the perihelion passage of the Eclipse Comet of 1882 and a total solar eclipse allowed its discovery.

However, during the 1980s, two Sun-observing satellites serendipitously discovered several new members of the Kreutz family, and since the launch of the <a href="Solar%20and%20Heliospheric%20Observatory">SOHO</a> Sun-observing satellite in 1995, it has been possible to observe comets very close to the Sun at any time of year. The satellite provides a constant view of the immediate solar vicinity, and SOHO has now discovered hundreds of new Sun-grazing comets, some just a few metres across. About 83% of the sungrazers found by SOHO are members of the Kreutz group, with the other being referred to as 'non-Kreutz' or 'sporadic' sungrazers (Meyer, Marsden, and Kracht1&2 families). On average, a new member of the Kreutz family is discovered every three days. Apart from Comet Lovejoy, none of the sungrazers seen by SOHO has survived its perihelion passage; some may have plunged into the Sun itself, but most are likely to have simply evaporated away completely.

More than 75% of the SOHO sungrazers have been discovered by amateur astronomers analysing SOHO's observations via the <a href="Internet">Internet</a>. Some amateurs have managed remarkable numbers of discoveries, with Rainer Kracht of <a href="Germany">Germany</a> having chalked up 211, Michael Oates of the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> making 144, and Zhou Bo of <a href="China">China</a> spotting 97. As of December 2011, over 2,000 Kreutz sungrazers have been identified using SOHO data.

SOHO observations have shown that Sungrazers frequently arrive in pairs separated by a few hours. These pairs are too frequent to occur by chance, and cannot be due to break-ups on the previous orbit, because the fragments would have separated by a much greater distance. Instead, it is thought that the pairs result from fragmentations far away from the perihelion. Many comets have been observed to fragment far from perihelion, and it seems that in the case of the Kreutz sungrazers, an initial fragmentation near perihelion can be followed by an ongoing 'cascade' of break-ups throughout the rest of the orbit.

The number of Subgroup I Kreutz comets discovered is about four times the number of Subgroup II members. This suggests that the 'grandparent' comet split into parent comets of unequal size.

Dynamically, the Kreutz sungrazers might continue to be recognised as a distinct family for many thousands of years yet. Eventually their orbits will be dispersed by gravitational perturbations, although depending on the rate of fragmentation of the constituent parts, the group might be completely destroyed before it is gravitationally dispersed. The continuing discovery of large numbers of the smaller members of the family by SOHO will undoubtedly lead to a greater understanding of how comets break up to form families.

It is not possible to estimate the chances of another very bright Kreutz comet arriving in the near future, but given that at least 10 have reached naked eye visibility over the last 200 years, another great comet from the Kreutz family seems almost certain to arrive at some point. <a href="Comet%20White%E2%80%93Ortiz%E2%80%93Bolelli">Comet White–Ortiz–Bolelli</a> in 1970 reached an apparent magnitude of 1. In December 2011, Kreutz sungrazer <a href="C/2011%20W3%20%28Lovejoy%29">C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy)</a> survived its perihelion passage and had an apparent magnitude of −3.

Stefan Lochner

Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late "soft style" of the <a href="International%20Gothic">International Gothic</a>. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the <a href="Realism%20%28arts%29">realism</a>, virtuoso <a href="oil%20paint">surface textures</a> and innovative <a href="iconography">iconography</a> of the early <a href="Northern%20Renaissance">Northern Renaissance</a>. Based in <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, a commercial and <a href="Cologne%20School%20of%20Painting">artistic hub</a> of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a>. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional <a href="polyptych">polyptych</a>s and <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a>s, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence.
Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in <a href="Meersburg">Meersburg</a> in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Low Countries</a>. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor <a href="Frederick%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick III</a>, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. <a href="Second%20plague%20pandemic">Plague</a> hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40.
Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a <a href="notname">notname</a> taken from the "Dombild Altarpiece" (in English "cathedral picture", also known as the "Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints") still in <a href="Cologne%20Cathedral">Cologne Cathedral</a>. One of Dürer's diary entries became key, 400 years later, in the 20th-century establishment of Lochner's identity. Only two attributed works are dated, and none are signed. His influence on successive generations of northern artists was substantial. Apart from the many direct copies made in the later 15th century, echoes of his panels can be seen in works by <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a> and <a href="Hans%20Memling">Hans Memling</a>. Lochner's work was praised by <a href="Karl%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Schlegel">Friedrich Schlegel</a> and <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Goethe</a> for its qualities, especially the "sweetness and grace" of his <a href="Madonna%20%28art%29">Madonnas</a>.

There are no signed paintings by Lochner, and his identity was not established until the 19th century. <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20B%C3%B6hmer">J. F. Böhmer</a> in an 1823 article identified the "Dombild" (meaning "Cathedral picture") or "Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints" with a work mentioned in an account of a visit to Cologne in 1520 in the diary of <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a>. The notoriously thrifty artist paid 5 silver <a href="pfennig">pfennig</a> to see an altarpiece by "Maister Steffan" some seventy years after Lochner's death. Although Dürer fails to mention specifically which of Maister Steffan's panels he had seen, his description matches exactly the centre panel of the "Dombild Altarpiece". The altarpiece is referred to in a number of other records. It was repaired and re-<a href="Gilding">gilded</a> in 1568, and mentioned in <a href="Georg%20Braun">Georg Braun</a>'s "Civitates Orbis Terrarum" in 1572.

German Gothic art underwent a revival in the early 19th-century Romantic period when the work was seen as a climax of the late Gothic period. The German philosopher and critic <a href="Karl%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Schlegel">Friedrich Schlegel</a> was instrumental in reviving Lochner's reputation. He wrote lengthy tracts comparing the "Dombild" favourably to the work of <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>, and believed it exceeded anything by van Eyck, Dürer or <a href="Hans%20Holbein%20the%20Younger">Holbein</a>. Later, <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Goethe</a> was enthusiastic, emphasising Lochner's German "spirit and origin"; he described the Dombild as the "axis around which the ancient Netherlandish art resolves into the new".
Lochner's identity remained unknown for centuries, and no other known works were associated with the "Dombild" altarpiece. In 1816 <a href="Ferdinand%20Franz%20Wallraf">Ferdinand Franz Wallraf</a> identified him as Philipp Kalf, based on a reading of a name inscribed on the cloth of a figure on the right of the centre panel. He misinterpreted markings on the stone floor pictured in "<a href="Annunciation%20%28Lochner%29">Annunciation</a>" to read 1410, which he took as the year of completion. <a href="Johann%20Dominicus%20Fiorillo">Johann Dominicus Fiorillo</a> discovered a 15th-century record that read "in 1380 there was an excellent painter in Cologne called Wilhelm, who had no equal in his art and who depicted human beings as if they were alive". In 1850 <a href="Johann%20Jakob%20Merlo">Johann Jakob Merlo</a> identified "Maister Steffan" with the historical Stefan Lochner.

In 1862, <a href="Gustav%20Waagen">Gustav Waagen</a> became one of the first art historians to try to place Lochner's works in chronological order. His reasoning was based the assumption that Lochner developed from the early idealised forms usually associated with early 15th century Cologne, and later absorbed the techniques and realism of the Netherlandish painters. In this way, he placed the lighter "gaiety" of Lochner's Madonna paintings as from the beginning of his career, with the more stern and pessimistic crucifixions and doom panels at the end. Today, art historians believe the reverse to be true; the dramatic and innovative polyptychs came first, and the single Madonnas and panels of saints are from his mid-career.

Based on their similarity to the "Altar of the City Patrons", art historians have attributed other paintings to Lochner, although a number have questioned whether the diary entry was authentically made by Dürer. Documentary evidence linking the paintings and miniatures with the historical Lochner has also been challenged, most notably by the art historian Michael Wolfson in 1996. In either case, the extent of Lochner's direct hand, as opposed to those of workshop members or followers, is debated. Some panels formerly attributed to him are now thought to date from after 1451, the year of his death.

The outline of the historical Stefan Lochner's life has been established from a small number of records, mostly relating to commissions, payments and property transfers. There are no documents relating to his early life, a contributing factor being the loss of archival records from his supposed birthplace during the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French occupation of Cologne</a>.

The primary sources relating to Lochner's life are a June 1442 payment by the city of Cologne in relation to Friedreich's visit; deeds of 27 October 1442 and 28 August 1444 outlining the transfer of ownership of the house at Roggendorf; October 1444 deeds for the purchase of two houses in st Alban; his 24 June 1447 registration as a citizen of Cologne; his December 1447 election to the municipal council; his Christmas 1450 re-election to that post; an August 1451 correspondence with the city council; a 22 September 1451 announcement of the setting up of a plague graveyard next to his property, and finally, court records dated 7 January 1452 detailing the appropriation of his property.

Through threadbare clues and supposition, mostly centred around a relatively wealthy couple that perished during a <a href="plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a>, believed to be his parents, Lochner is thought to have come from <a href="Meersburg">Meersburg</a>, near <a href="Lake%20Constance">Lake Constance</a>. Georg and Alhet Lochner were citizens and died there in 1451. A "Stefan" is referred to as "Stefan Lochner of Constance" in two documents dated 1444 and 1448. However, there is no archival evidence that he was there, and his style bears no trace of the art in that region. There are no further records of him or his family in the town except for a mention of Lochners (a fairly uncommon name) in the village of <a href="Hagnau%20am%20Bodensee">Hagnau</a>, two kilometers from Meersburg.

However records indicate that Lochner's talent was recognised from an early age. He may have been of Netherlandish origin or worked there for a master, possibly <a href="Robert%20Campin">Robert Campin</a>. Lochner's work seems influenced by <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a> and <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>; elements of their styles can be detected in the structure and colourisation of Lochner's mature works, especially in his "Last Judgment", although neither is thought to be the master with whom he studied.

By the 1440s, Cologne was the largest and wealthiest city in the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. It controlled and taxed the passage of trade from <a href="County%20of%20Flanders">Flanders</a> to <a href="Electorate%20of%20Saxony">Saxony</a>, and became a financial, religious and artistic center. The city had a long tradition of producing high-quality visual art, and in the 14th century, its output was considered to be equal to that of Vienna and Prague. Cologne's artists concentrated on more personal and intimate subject matters, and the area became known for its production of small panels of "great lyrical charm and loveliness, which reflected the deep devotion of the writings of the <a href="German%20mystic">German mystic</a>s".
During the 1430s, painting in Cologne had become conventional and somewhat old-fashioned, and still under the influence of the courtly style of the <a href="Master%20of%20Saint%20Veronica">Master of Saint Veronica</a>, active until 1420. After his arrival Lochner, who was earlier exposed to the Netherlandish painters and already working in oils, eclipsed other artists in the city. According to the art historian Emmy Wellesz, after Lochner's arrival "painting in Cologne became infused with a new life", perhaps enriched by the earlier exposure to the Netherlandish artists. He became widely celebrated as the most capable and modern painter in the city, where he was known as "Maister Steffan zu Cöln".

Lochner first appears in extant records in 1442, nine years before he died. He moved to Cologne where he received a commission from the city council for the provision of decorations for the visit of Emperor <a href="Frederick%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick III</a>. Lochner was seemingly well established and although other artists were involved in preparing for the event, he was responsible for the most important arrangements. The centrepiece seems to have been the "Dombild Altarpiece", described by modern art historians as "the most important commission of the fifteenth century in Cologne". He is recorded as having been paid forty <a href="Mark%20%28currency%29">marks</a> and ten shillings for his effort.

Lochner bought a house with his wife Lysbeth around 1442. Nothing else is known about her and the couple apparently had no children. In 1444 he acquired two larger properties, the "zome Carbunckel", near <a href="St.%20Pantaleon%27s%20Church%2C%20Cologne">Saint Alban Church</a>, and the "zome Alden Gryne". Historians have speculated whether these acquisitions indicate a need to house a growing group of assistants due to his rising commercial success. It is likely that he lived in one house and worked in the other. The purchases may have caused a strain; in around 1447 he seems to have encountered financial difficulties, and he was forced to remortgage the homes. Second mortgages were taken out in 1448.

In 1447 the local painter's guild elected Lochner as their representative municipal councilor, or "Ratsherr". The appointment implies that he had lived in Cologne since at least 1437, as only those who had been living in the city for ten years could take up the position. He had not taken up citizenship immediately, possibly to avoid paying the 12 <a href="guilder">guilder</a> fee. He was obliged to act as "Ratsherr", and on 24 June 1447, he became a <a href="Citizenship">burgher</a> of Cologne. The role of municipal councilor could only be held for a one-year term, with two years vacated before reoccupation. Lochner was re-elected for a second term in the winter of 1450–51 but died in office.

There was an outbreak of plague in 1451, and there are no surviving records of him after Christmas of that year. On 16 August 1451 the council of Meersburg was informed by officials in Cologne that Lochner would be unable to attend to the will and estate of his parents, recently deceased. It is presumed he was by then already ill; plague was widespread in the area. On 22 September Saint Alban parish requested permission to burn victims in the lot next to his house there was no longer room in their cemetery. Lochner died sometime between this date and December 1451 when creditors took possession of his house. Records from 1451 do not mention Lysbeth, who was presumably already dead.

Lochner worked in the late <a href="International%20Gothic">International Gothic</a> ("schöne stil") style, already considered dated and old-fashioned by the 1440s, yet is widely regarded as innovative. He introduced a number of progressions to painting in Cologne, especially by filling his backgrounds and landscapes with specific and elaborate details, and by rendering his figures with more bulk and volume. Wellesz described his paintings as evidencing an "intensity of feeling which gives a very special and very moving quality to his work. His devotion is reflected in his figures: it charges with symbolic meaning the smallest details of his paintings; and, in a hidden, almost magical way, it speaks from the concord of his pure and glowing colours."

Lochner painted with <a href="oil%20paint">oil</a>, preparing the surface in a way typical of other North German artists; in some works, he attached canvas to the panel support underneath the usual chalk ground. This was probably done where there were to be large areas of plain <a href="gilding">gilding</a>. Where the gold ground was to have a pattern such as a <a href="brocade">brocade</a>, this was carved into the chalk ground before gilding, and, in some paintings, elements had moulded additions applied to raise the surface to be gilded. He employed a number of techniques when gilding, to give different effects. These included laying the <a href="gold%20leaf">leaf</a> with water for burnished passages, and with oil or varnish <a href="sizing">sizing</a> (mordant gilding) for the more decorative areas. His colour schemes tend to be bright and luminous, filled with varieties of red, blue and green pigments. He often employed <a href="ultramarine">ultramarine</a>, then expensive and difficult to source. His figures are regularly outlined with red paint. He was innovative in his rendering of flesh tones, which he built up using lead whites to give pale complexions with almost porcelain qualities. In this, he refers to an older tradition of indicating women of high nobility whose paleness was associated with a life spent indoors, "shielded from toiling in the fields, which was the lot of most". In particular, this technique follows the Master of Veronica, although the earlier painter's figures had an almost yellowish, ivory hue. Lochner's Madonnas tend to be clothed in saturated blues which resonate with surrounding yellow, red and green paint. According to James Snyder, the artist "employed these four basic colors for his harmonies", but went beyond by using more subdued and deep hues in a technique referred to as "pure color".
Like <a href="Conrad%20von%20Soest">Conrad von Soest</a>, Lochner often applied black cross-<a href="hatching">hatching</a> on gold, usually to render metallic objects such as <a href="brooch">brooch</a>es, crowns or buckles, in imitation of goldsmiths work on precious objects such as <a href="Reliquary">reliquaries</a> and <a href="chalice">chalice</a>s. He was heavily influenced by the art and process of metalwork and goldsmithing, especially in his painting of gold grounds, and it has been suggested that he may have once trained as a <a href="goldsmith">goldsmith</a>. Evidence of his imitation of elements of their craft is apparent even in his <a href="underdrawing">underdrawing</a>s. Notable and elaborate painted examples include the tooled gold border of the angelic concert in his "Last Judgement", and Gabriel's clasp on the outer wing of the "Dombild altarpiece".

Lochner seems to have prepared on paper before approaching his underdrawings; there is little evidence of reworking, even when positioning large groups of figures. <a href="Infrared">Infrared reflectography</a> of the underdrawings for the "Last Judgment" panels show letters used to denote the final colour to be applied, for example "g" for "gelb" (yellow) or "w" for "weiss" (white), and there are few deviations in the finished work. He often rearranged drapery fold lines or to denote perspective, enlarged or diminished the size of figures. The underdrawings reveal a draughtsman of skill, dynamism, and confidence; the figures appear fully formed with little evidence of reworking. Many are extremely detailed and precisely modelled, for example, St Ursula's brooch in the "Altarpiece of the City Patron Saints", which contains closely detailed <a href="garland">garland</a>s and <a href="diadem">diadem</a>s.
Perhaps influenced by van Eyck's "<a href="Madonna%20in%20the%20Church">Madonna in the Church</a>", Lochner closely detailed the fall and gradient of light. According to the art historian Brigitte Corley, the clothes of "protagonists change their hues in delicate reaction to the influx of light, reds being transformed through a symphony of pink tonalities to a dusty greyish white, greens to a warm pale yellow, and lemon shading through oranges to a saturated red". Lochner employed the notion of supernatural illumination not just from van Eyck, but also from von Soest's "Crucifixion", where light emanating from Christ dissolves around <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John</a>'s red robe, as yellows rays eventually become white. There is a real possibility that a number of the faces of saints are modelled on historical persons, i.e. as <a href="donor%20portrait">donor portrait</a>s of the commissioners and their wives. Figures fitting this theory include St Ursula and St Gereon panels from the City Saints altarpiece.

Unlike the painters in the Low Countries, Lochner was not so concerned with delineating <a href="Perspective%20%28graphical%29">perspective</a>; his pictures are often set in shallow space, while his backgrounds give little indication of distance and often dissolve into solid gold. Thus, and given his harmonious colour schemes, Lochner is usually described as one of the last exponents of the International Gothic. This is not to say his paintings lack contemporary northern sophistication; his arrangements are often innovative. The worlds he paints are hushed, according to Snyder, achieved with the symmetry of subdued use of colour and the often repeated stylistic element of circles. Angels form circles around the heavenly figures; the heavenly figures' heads are highly circular and they wear round haloes. According to Snyder, the viewer is slowly "drawn into empathy with the revolving forms".

Because of the paucity of surviving attributed works, it is difficult to detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent <a href="Dendrochronology">dendrochronological</a> examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that the more advanced "Presentation in the Temple" is of 1445, predating the more Gothic "Saints" panels now divided between London and Cologne.

Lochner's major works include three large polyptychs: the "Dombild Altarpiece"; the "Last Judgement", which is broken apart and in several collections; and Nuremberg's "Crucifixion". Only two attributed paintings are dated; the 1445 "<a href="Nativity%20%28Lochner%29">Nativity</a>" now in the <a href="Alte%20Pinakothek">Alte Pinakothek</a>, Munich, and the "Presentation in the Temple" from 1447, now in <a href="Darmstadt">Darmstadt</a>. There is a <a href="Presentation%20of%20Christ%20in%20the%20Temple%20%28Lochner%2C%201445%29">smaller, earlier version</a> of the presentation scene at the <a href="Calouste%20Gulbenkian%20Foundation">Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation</a>, Lisbon, dated 1445. As secular works grew in demand and religious works became unfashionable in later centuries, 15th-century polyptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works, especially if a panel or section contained an image that could pass as a secular portrait.

Wing panels and other fragments of Lochner's larger works are today spread across various museums and collections. Two surviving double-sided wing panels from an altarpiece with images of saints are in the London's <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a> and the Wallraf-Richartz Museum, Cologne (this now sawn through so both sides can be displayed on a wall). The wings of the "Last Judgement" originally had six parts, painted on both sides, but have been sawn into twelve individual pictures, now divided between the Wallraf-Richartz Museum, the <a href="Alte%20Pinakothek">Alte Pinakothek</a> in Munich and the <a href="St%C3%A4del%20Museum">Städel Museum</a> in Frankfurt. It is probably from early in his career, but in subject matter and background differs from other extant and attributed works. While the elements are arranged in typical harmony, the composition and tone are unusually dark and dramatic. The "Crucifixion" is also an early work and reminiscent of late medieval painting. It has a heavily ornamented gilded background and the smooth flowing quality of the 'soft' Gothic style.
The extant works repeatedly address the same scenes and themes. The <a href="Nativity%20of%20Jesus">nativity</a> is recurrent, while several panels depict the Virgin and Child, often surrounded by a chorus of angels, or in earlier panels, blessed by a hovering representation of <a href="God%20the%20Father">God</a> or a dove (representing the <a href="Holy%20Ghost">Holy Ghost</a>). In many instances Mary is enclosed in her usual <a href="Hortus%20conclusus">enclosed garden</a>. Several reveal the work of a number of hands, with weaker and less confident passages attributed to workshop members. The figures of Mary and Gabriel on the reverse of the "Dombild" were drawn more rapidly and with less skill than the figures on the main panels, and their drapery is modelled with, according to the art historian Julien Chapuis, a certain "stiffness", while the cross hatching "achieves no clear definition of <a href="relief">relief</a>". A number of drawings have been associated with him, but only one, a c. 1450 brush and ink on paper entitled "Virgin and Child" and now in the <a href="Musee%20du%20Louvre">Musee du Louvre</a>, is attributed with confidence.

Lochner is associated with three surviving <a href="book%20of%20hours">books of hours</a>; in Darmstadt, Berlin and <a href="Anholt%2C%20Germany">Anholt</a>. The extent of his association in each is debated; workshop members were probably heavily involved in their production. The most famous is the early 1450s <a href="Prayer%20book%20of%20Stephan%20Lochner">Prayer book of Stephan Lochner</a> now at Darmstadt; the others are the Berlin Book of Prayers of c. 1444, and the Anholt Prayerbook, completed in the 1450s. The manuscripts are very small (Berlin: 9.3 cm x 7 cm, Darmstadt: 10.7 cm x 8 cm, Anholt: 9 cm x 8 cm) and similar in layout and colourisation and are each extensively decorated in gold and blue. The borders are ornamented in bright colours and contain <a href="Acanthus%20%28ornament%29">acanthus</a> scrolls, gold foliage, flowers, berry-like fruits and round pods. The Darmstadt book includes a complete cycle of the Martyrdom of the Apostles. Its illustrations contain Lochner's characteristic application of deep blue, reminiscent of his "<a href="Madonna%20of%20the%20Rose%20Bower">Virgin in the Rose Garden</a>".

The art historian Ingo Walther detects Lochner's hand in the "pious intimacy and soulfulness of the figures, always expressed so gently and elegantly, even in the extremely small format of the pictures". Chapuis agrees with the attribution, noting how many of the miniatures share thematic similarities to attributed panels. He writes that the illustrations "are not a peripheral phenomenon. On the contrary, they address several of the concerns articulated in Lochner's paintings and formulate them anew. There is little doubt that these exquisite images stem from the same mind." The text of the Darmstadt book is written in Cologne vernacular, the Berlin book in Latin.

There are extant liturgical vestments containing embroidered figures, including that of St. Barbara, in Lochner's style and with similar facial types. This has led to some speculation whether Lochner provided the models. In addition, a number of contemporary stained glass panels are similar in style, and there has been debate whether he might have been responsible for church murals; the over-life-size figures of the "Dombild" and "Virgin with the Violet" indicate his ability to work on a monumental scale.

Two drawings on paper in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> and the <a href="%C3%89cole%20nationale%20sup%C3%A9rieure%20des%20Beaux-Arts">École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts</a> were at times thought to be studies for the Munich "Nativity". The lines of the folds in the garments closely match those of the painting, although the technical ability does not. The Paris drawing has blotches of paint indicating that it was a study piece for workshop members. The London piece is superior, but its lines are more rigid, lacking Lochner's fluidity, and so its attribution has been relegated to a draughtsman closely associated with Lochner.

Lochner's art seems indebted to two broad sources; Netherlandish artists van Eyck and <a href="Robert%20Campin">Robert Campin</a>, and the earlier German masters <a href="Conrad%20von%20Soest">Conrad von Soest</a> and the Master of Saint Veronica. From the former Lochner drew his realism in depicting naturalistic backgrounds, objects, and clothes. From the latter, he adopted the somewhat antiquated manner of depicting figures, especially females, with doll-like, eloquent and sensitive features, to present "iconic, almost timeless" atmospheres, enhanced by the then old-fashioned gold backgrounds. Lochner's figures have idealised facial features typical of medieval portraiture. His subjects, females in particular, usually have the high foreheads, long noses, small rounded chins, tucked blond curls and prominent ears typical of the late Gothic, giving them the characteristic monumentality of 13th-century art, placing them on seemingly similar shallow backgrounds.

Lochner probably saw van Eyck's c. 1432 "<a href="Ghent%20Altarpiece">Ghent Altarpiece</a>" during his visit to the Netherlands and seems to have borrowed a number of its compositional elements. The similarities include the manner in which the figures engage with their space and the emphasis on and rendering of elements such as <a href="brocade">brocade</a>s, gems and metals. Some figures in Lochner's paintings are directly borrowed from Ghent, and a number of facial features match those seen in van Eyck. His "Virgin with the Violet" has often been compared to van Eyck's 1439 "<a href="Madonna%20at%20the%20Fountain">Virgin at the Fountain</a>". Similarly to those in van Eyck's work, Lochner's angels often sing or play musical instruments, including <a href="lute">lute</a>s and organs.

He seemingly rejected some aspects of van Eyckian realism, notably in his depictions of shadows, and his unwillingness to apply transparent glazes. As a colourist, Lochner was more inclined towards the International Gothic style, even if this inhibited realism. He did not utilise the newly developed Netherlandish techniques of representing <a href="Perspective%20%28graphical%29">perspective</a>, but rather indicated distance through the diminution of parallel objects.

The historical evidence suggests that Lochner's paintings were well known and widely copied during his lifetime, and remained so until the 16th century. Early examples in ink after his "Virgin in Adoration" are in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> and <a href="%C3%89cole%20nationale%20sup%C3%A9rieure%20des%20Beaux-Arts">École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts</a>. The influence of Lochner's "Last Judgement" can be seen in <a href="Hans%20Memling">Hans Memling</a>'s "<a href="The%20Last%20Judgment%20%28Memling%29">Gdansk altarpiece</a>", where the gates of Heaven are similar, as is the rendering of the blessed. Albrecht Dürer knew of him before his stay in Cologne, and Van der Weyden saw his paintings during his travel to Italy. The latter's "<a href="Altar%20of%20Saint%20John">Altar of Saint John</a>" is similar to Lochner's "Flaying of Bartholomew", especially in the executioner's pose, while his "<a href="Saint%20Columba%20altarpiece">Saint Columba altarpiece</a>" includes two motifs from Lochner's "Adoration of the Magi" triptych; specifically, the king in the central panel with his back to the viewer, and the girl in the right hand wing holding a basket containing doves.

The "Heisterbach Altarpiece", a dismantled double set of wings now broken apart and divided between <a href="Bamberg">Bamberg</a> and Cologne, is heavily indebted to Lochner's style. The inner panels show sixteen scenes from the lives of <a href="Life%20of%20Christ">Christ</a> and the <a href="Life%20of%20the%20Virgin">Virgin</a> that bear multiple similarities to Lochner's work, including in format, compositional motifs, <a href="physiognomy">physiognomy</a> and colourisation. The work was for a period attributed to Lochner but is now generally accepted as bearing his strong influence. In 1954 Alfred Stange described the <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Heisterbach%20Altarpiece">Master of the Heisterbach Altarpiece</a> as Lochner's "best-known and most important pupil and follower", although research in 2014 indicates that the two may have collaborated on the panels.

Research in 2014 by Iris Schaeffer into the underdrawings of the "Dombild Altarpiece" established two guiding hands, presumably Lochner and an exceptionally talented pupil, whom she concludes was in probability the principal artist behind the "Heisterbach Altarpiece". A counter view is that Lochner's workshop was producing to a deadline, and he delegated as a matter of expediency.

Eduard Streltsov

Eduard Anatolyevich Streltsov (, 21 July 1937 – 22 July 1990) was a <a href="Association%20football">footballer</a> from the Soviet Union who played as a <a href="forward%20%28association%20football%29">forward</a> for <a href="FC%20Torpedo%20Moscow">Torpedo Moscow</a> and the <a href="Soviet%20Union%20national%20football%20team">Soviet national team</a> during the 1950s and 1960s. A powerful and skilful attacking player, he scored the fourth-highest number of goals for the Soviet Union and has been called "the greatest outfield player Russia has ever produced". He is sometimes dubbed "the Russian <a href="Pel%C3%A9">Pelé</a>".

Born and raised in east Moscow, Streltsov joined Torpedo at the age of 16 in 1953 and made his international debut two years later. He was part of the squad that won the gold medal <a href="Association%20football%20at%20the%201956%20Summer%20Olympics">at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics</a>, and came seventh in the <a href="1957%20Ballon%20d%27Or">1957 Ballon d'Or</a>. Early the next year his promising career was interrupted by a rape scandal. The 20-year-old Streltsov was accused of raping a woman shortly before the <a href="1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1958 World Cup</a>; told he could still play if he admitted his guilt, he confessed, despite inconclusive evidence against him. He was instead convicted and sentenced to twelve years in the <a href="Gulag">Gulag</a> system of <a href="forced%20labor">forced</a> <a href="labor%20camp">labour camps</a>.

Streltsov was released after five years in the camps and in 1965 he resumed his career with Torpedo Moscow. In the first season of his comeback, the club won the <a href="Soviet%20Top%20League">Soviet championship</a>; in 1968 Torpedo won the <a href="Soviet%20Cup">Soviet Cup</a>. Streltsov was restored to the Soviet national team in 1966, and in 1967 and 1968 named <a href="Soviet%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">Soviet Footballer of the Year</a>. By the time of his retirement in 1970 he had pioneered innovations such as the back-heeled pass, which became known in Russia as "Streltsov's pass". He died in Moscow in 1990. Six years later, Torpedo renamed their home ground "<a href="Eduard%20Streltsov%20Stadium">Eduard Streltsov Stadium</a>" in his honour. In the 21st century, statues of Streltsov stand outside the stadium bearing his name and the <a href="Luzhniki%20Olympic%20Complex">Luzhniki Olympic Complex</a> in Moscow.

Eduard Anatolyevich Streltsov was born in <a href="Perovo%20District">Perovo</a>, an eastern district of Moscow, on 21 July 1937, the son of Anatoly Streltsov, a front-line soldier and intelligence officer, and Sofia Frolovna. Anatoly did not return to the family following the Second World War, instead choosing to settle alone in <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>; Sofia therefore raised her son on her own, working at the Fraser Cutting Instruments Factory to support Eduard and herself. As a result, Streltsov had a modest upbringing, the highlights of which were playing football and following his favoured team, <a href="FC%20Spartak%20Moscow">Spartak Moscow</a>.

The factory recognised his talent from a young age: Streltsov became the Fraser Factory football team's youngest ever player when he was 13 years old. Three years later in 1953, a <a href="exhibition%20game">friendly match</a> was organised between Fraser and a youth team from <a href="FC%20Torpedo%20Moscow">Torpedo Moscow</a>. Streltsov impressed the Torpedo coach, Vasily Provornov, and after befriending him, left Fraser to play for Torpedo.

Aged 16, Streltsov made his debut for Torpedo during <a href="1954%20Soviet%20Top%20League">the 1954 season</a>, appeared in every league game and scored four goals. The team finished ninth in the league, a drop from third the previous year. In his <a href="1955%20Soviet%20Top%20League">second season</a> Streltsov was the league's most prolific goalscorer, scoring 15 goals in 22 games as his side rose to fourth place. Streltsov was selected for the <a href="USSR%20national%20football%20team">Soviet national team</a> for the first time in 1955, halfway through the season; his debut came in a friendly match against <a href="Sweden%20national%20football%20team">Sweden</a> in Stockholm on 26 June, when he scored a <a href="hat-trick%23Association%20football">hat-trick</a> within the first 45 minutes as the Swedish team was defeated 6–0. On his second appearance, a friendly home game against <a href="India%20national%20football%20team">India</a>, he scored three goals again. A further game in Hungary and a goal against <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a> meant that by the start of 1956, Streltsov had scored seven goals for the Soviet Union in four matches. After scoring in a match against <a href="Denmark%20national%20football%20team">Denmark</a> in April 1956, he missed three international matches before returning in September with a goal after three minutes in a 2–1 away victory over <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">West Germany</a>. Streltsov continued to score regularly for Torpedo, managing 12 league goals during the <a href="1956%20Soviet%20Top%20League">1956 season</a>, but appeared in two successive defeats for the Soviets before they travelled in November 1956 to the <a href="1956%20Summer%20Olympics">Olympic Games</a> in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. Streltsov scored three goals in a 16–2 victory over <a href="Australia%20national%20association%20football%20team">Australia</a> in an unofficial match on 15 November before scoring a late winning goal in the first tournament match against the <a href="United%20Team%20of%20Germany">United Team of Germany</a> nine days later. The Soviets required a <a href="replay%20%28sports%29">replay</a> to overcome <a href="Indonesia%20national%20football%20team">Indonesia</a> in the quarter-finals and met <a href="Bulgaria%20national%20football%20team">Bulgaria</a> in the semi-final.

The match finished 0–0 after 90 minutes, and with defender <a href="Nikolai%20Tishchenko">Nikolai Tishchenko</a> and Streltsov's fellow Torpedo forward <a href="Valentin%20Kozmich%20Ivanov">Valentin Ivanov</a> both injured, the Soviet team had only nine fit players when Bulgaria scored early in <a href="extra%20time">extra time</a>. Streltsov's performance was later described by journalist <a href="Jonathan%20Wilson%20%28journalist/author%29">Jonathan Wilson</a> as "magnificent"; he scored an equaliser after 112 minutes and then <a href="Assist%20%28football%29">set up</a> <a href="Boris%20Tatushin">Boris Tatushin</a> of Spartak Moscow four minutes later to score the winning goal. Streltsov missed the final against <a href="Yugoslavia%20national%20football%20team">Yugoslavia</a> as the team manager, <a href="Gavriil%20Kachalin">Gavriil Kachalin</a>, believed the two forward players should be club team-mates; as Ivanov was unfit, Streltsov was dropped as well. <a href="Nikita%20Simonyan">Nikita Simonyan</a>, who took his place, offered Streltsov his gold medal following a 1–0 victory over the Yugoslavs, an offer which the Torpedo player refused, saying "Nikita, I will win many other trophies". Streltsov received two votes in the <a href="1956%20Ballon%20d%27Or">1956 Ballon d'Or</a>.

Streltsov scored the first goal in a 2–0 win in a <a href="1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">World Cup qualifying</a> <a href="play%20off">play-off</a> match in Poland which meant the Soviet Union qualified for the <a href="1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1958 World Cup</a>. At club level, he scored 12 goals in 15 league matches during the <a href="1957%20Soviet%20Top%20League">1957 season</a>. Torpedo, never league champions and traditionally overshadowed by local rivals such as <a href="PFC%20CSKA%20Moscow">CSKA</a>, <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Moscow">Dynamo</a> and Spartak, finished as runners-up of the <a href="Soviet%20Top%20League">Soviet Top League</a>. At the end of that season, Streltsov came seventh in the <a href="1957%20Ballon%20d%27Or">1957 Ballon d'Or</a>, gaining 12 votes; by the start of the World Cup year, 1958, his international record stood at 18 goals in 20 games. Streltsov scored five goals in the first eight league matches of the <a href="1958%20Soviet%20Top%20League">1958 Top League season</a>, and appeared in a 1–1 friendly draw with <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> in Moscow on 18 May 1958.

Streltsov was known for womanising, drinking heavily and leading an extravagant life outside of football, as well as for wearing his hair in the British "<a href="Teddy%20Boy">Teddy Boy</a>" style. As a key player for his club and for the Soviet national side, these traits combined to create an impression in government circles that, in Wilson's words, "Streltsov was becoming rather too much of a celebrity". The problem was brought to a head by an alleged relationship between the footballer and Svetlana Furtseva, the 16-year-old daughter of the first female <a href="Politburo">Politburo</a> member <a href="Ekaterina%20Furtseva">Ekaterina Furtseva</a>. With the young Svetlana besotted by the 19-year-old Torpedo forward, her mother first met him at a <a href="Moscow%20Kremlin">Kremlin</a> ball held early in 1957 to celebrate the Olympic victory of 1956. Furtseva suggested he might marry her daughter, to which Streltsov replied "I already have a fiancée and I will not marry her [Svetlana]." While drunk, he was later heard to remark either "I would never marry that monkey" or "I would rather be hanged than marry such a girl" (both quotes were reported), humiliating Furtseva, a minister close to Soviet Premier <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>.

Streltsov became secretly engaged to Alla Demenko before leaving for the Olympics, and the couple married on 25 February 1957, halfway through preparations for the Soviet season. The Department of Soviet Football criticised both the player and his club over the timing of the ceremony. The <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Communist Party</a> also seemed to distrust him, considering him a possible <a href="Eastern%20Bloc%20emigration%20and%20defection">defector</a> after he attracted the interest of French and Swedish clubs during tours overseas with Torpedo. His file in the party archives included the comment: "[a]ccording to a verified source, Streltsov said to his friends in 1957 that he was always sorry to return to the USSR after trips abroad." After he was sent off during a game in <a href="Odessa">Odessa</a> in April 1957, the official government sports newspaper "<a href="Sovetsky%20Sport">Sovetsky Sport</a>" published an article about him titled "This is not a hero" as well as letters purportedly written by members of the proletariat, which described Streltsov as an "example of the evils of western imperialism".
A week after appearing against England in a warm-up match in Moscow for the 1958 World Cup, Streltsov was invited to a party by a Soviet military officer, Eduard Karakhanov, to be held on 25 May. Streltsov and the rest of the Soviet squad were on a pre-World Cup training camp at Tarasovka, just outside Moscow, but the team had been given the day as holiday. At the end of such days, the players had to report to the authorities at <a href="Dynamo%20Stadium%20%28Moscow%29">Dynamo Stadium</a> at 4:30 pm, but Streltsov and two team-mates, Spartak players <a href="Mikhail%20Ogonkov">Mikhail Ogonkov</a> and <a href="Boris%20Tatushin">Boris Tatushin</a>, ignored this rule and went to the party anyway. Held at Karakhanov's <a href="dacha">dacha</a>, it was also attended by a 20-year-old woman named Marina Lebedeva, whom Streltsov had never met. The following morning, Streltsov, Ogonkov and Tatushin were all arrested and charged with raping her.

Journalist Kevin O'Flynn writes that since heavy drinking had taken place at the party, the evidence against Streltsov was "confused and contradictory", even from Lebedeva herself. But the Soviet team coach, <a href="Gavriil%20Kachalin">Gavriil Kachalin</a>, claimed shortly before Streltsov's death that influence from high up in the Communist Party dictated that the player could not be helped; Kachalin said that police told him of Khrushchev's personal involvement, fuelled by a grudge held by Furtseva. According to Soviet Union team-mate Nikita Simonyan, speaking in 2006, Streltsov wrote home to his mother "saying he was taking the blame for someone else". Streltsov and Lebedeva did sleep together, Simonyan said, and he did not believe their meeting had been set up, but he was unsure about whether or not Streltsov had raped her. Simonyan proposed that consensual sex could have been twisted into a rape accusation by "the system", which he said bore ill will towards the Torpedo forward. However, in the same interview Simonyan revealed incriminating photographs of both Lebedeva and Streltsov from the time of the trial, including one in which the Torpedo player's face "was streaked from nose to cheekbone with three parallel scratches". "[T]here is the possibility that the photographs were doctored or the injuries inflicted at a later date", Wilson comments, "but Soviet justice rarely required such damning evidence." Streltsov's wife of just over a year, Alla, filed for divorce soon after the accusations were made. Apart from Streltsov himself, the only members of the team present at his trial were Ogonkov and Tatushin, who appeared as witnesses.

Streltsov confessed to the crime after being told this would allow him to keep his place in the Soviet team for the 1958 World Cup. This did not happen, however; far from remaining in the national side, Streltsov was sentenced to twelve years in the <a href="forced%20labor">forced</a> <a href="labor%20camps">labour camps</a> of the <a href="Gulag">Gulag</a>, and barred from ever returning to professional football of any kind. Plans for a march by 100,000 workers at Moscow's <a href="ZiL">ZiL</a> car factory, the base of the Torpedo club, to show support during the trial, were abandoned when Streltsov was sentenced before the march could be arranged. Ogonkov and Tatushin, meanwhile, were banned from playing any kind of organised football for three years, and barred from representing the USSR for life. In the camp where he was incarcerated, Streltsov was initially victimised by a young criminal who inflicted so much physical harm on him that he spent four months in the prison hospital, suffering from injuries caused by blows from either an "iron bar or a shoe heel". Camp authorities later started to include Streltsov in football matches to calm down the inmates in times of trouble; one prisoner, Ivan Lukyanov, later said: "[w]e loved Streltsov, we believed he would return to football. And not only us."

Meanwhile, the Soviet team travelled to Sweden for the World Cup without Streltsov, Ogonkov or Tatushin. The world's press claimed that two of the competing teams were severely weakened: England by the <a href="Munich%20air%20disaster">Munich air disaster</a>, and the Soviets by the loss of Streltsov. The Soviets reached the quarter-finals, losing 2–0 to hosts Sweden, a team defeated 6–0 by the Soviet Union during Streltsov's 1955 debut. Without Streltsov, Torpedo dropped from their second-place finish in 1957 to seventh <a href="1958%20Soviet%20Top%20League">in 1958</a>, though the team also reached the Soviet Cup final before losing to Spartak. Streltsov's place as the club's leading scorer was taken by the 21-year-old forward <a href="Gennadi%20Gusarov">Gennadi Gusarov</a>, who had turned professional with Torpedo during 1957. The team rose to fifth in 1959 before winning <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">the Double</a> of Top League and Cup <a href="1960%20Soviet%20Top%20League">during the following year</a>, with Gusarov leading the league in goals with 20. Torpedo then finished as runners-up in both competitions <a href="1961%20Soviet%20Top%20League">in 1961</a>, with Gusarov scoring 22. Two mid-table finishes followed as Gusarov was sold to city rivals Dynamo between the 1962 and 1963 seasons, but Torpedo once again came second <a href="1964%20Soviet%20Top%20League">in 1964</a>, losing a championship play-off against <a href="FC%20Dinamo%20Tbilisi">Dinamo Tbilisi</a> after the two clubs finished equal on points.

Streltsov was released on 4 February 1963, five years into his twelve-year sentence, and owing to the ban from professional play began to split his time between work at the ZiL factory and the study of automotive engineering at the attached technical college. After failing to patch up his differences with Alla, he married Raisa Mikhailovna in September 1963. He started to play for the amateur factory team, which caused it to attract large crowds, both at home and away. When the ZiL side travelled to <a href="Nizhny%20Novgorod">Gorky</a> for an away match late in the 1964 season, the team's coach received orders from above not to play Streltsov, something which spectators noticed immediately when the match started; during the first half, they began to riot and threatened to burn down the stadium, chanting Streltsov's name. Worried that the angry crowd might go through with this, the Gorky factory chief ordered the ZiL coach to send Streltsov out for the second half. On stepping onto the field, the former Gulag prisoner received a standing ovation.

With Streltsov in the team, ZiL topped the factory league after winning all 11 matches. Although he was not allowed to play for Torpedo, Streltsov attended matches at his old club throughout the season. In October 1964, Khrushchev was replaced as the Communist Party's <a href="General%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">First Secretary</a> by <a href="Leonid%20Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a>, who shortly after taking office received a letter signed by tens of thousands of people, including <a href="Hero%20of%20Socialist%20Labour">heroes of Socialist Labour</a> and national and regional <a href="Supreme%20Soviet%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Supreme Soviet</a> members, requesting the reversal of Streltsov's professional ban. Some party members were wary of a potential comeback, fearing that Streltsov's inclusion in a Torpedo squad that regularly travelled to Western Europe could lead to an international incident, but Brezhnev repealed the ban, arguing that as a free man Streltsov should be able to use his trained profession. He was cleared to return to Torpedo before the 1965 season.

Streltsov was enthusiastically welcomed back by supporters. Although he had lost some of his strength and agility, his footballing intelligence was still intact; his presence helped Torpedo to win the <a href="1965%20Soviet%20Top%20League">1965 Soviet championship</a>, with Streltsov scoring 12 goals from 26 league matches. At the end of the season, he came second in the voting for the <a href="Soviet%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">Soviet Footballer of the Year</a> behind Torpedo team-mate <a href="Valery%20Voronin">Valery Voronin</a>. It was the second time that Torpedo had won the league; the club had won its first title <a href="1960%20Soviet%20Top%20League">five years earlier</a>, during Streltsov's imprisonment. Streltsov made his debut in continental club competition on 28 September 1966, playing in a 1–0 defeat away to <a href="F.C.%20Internazionale%20Milano">Inter Milan</a> in the <a href="European%20Cup">European Cup</a>. He was recalled to the Soviet national team on 16 October 1966 in a 2–0 home defeat against <a href="Turkey%20national%20football%20team">Turkey</a>, and scored the first international goal of his comeback a week later in a 2–2 draw with <a href="East%20Germany%20national%20football%20team">East Germany</a>. An appearance in a 1–0 away defeat against <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italy</a> followed two weeks later. Torpedo reached the final of the <a href="Soviet%20Cup">Soviet Cup</a> in 1966, but lost 2–0 to Dynamo. Streltsov matched his previous seasonal tally of 12 league goals during the 1966 Top League season.

Streltsov successfully re-established himself in the Soviet team over the following year, as he appeared in eight consecutive USSR matches, starting with a 2–0 friendly victory over <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">Scotland</a> in Glasgow in May 1967. He scored two goals during this run in the national side: one each in a 4–2 win against <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a> in Paris on 3 June 1967 and a 4–3 European Championship qualifying home victory over <a href="Austria%20national%20football%20team">Austria</a> eight days later. After losing his place for the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201968">1968 European Championship</a> <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201968%20qualifying">qualifying</a> match against Finland on 30 August 1967, Streltsov missed three Soviet Union matches. He regained his place for an away friendly match against <a href="Bulgaria%20national%20football%20team">Bulgaria</a> on 8 October, scoring a goal as the Soviets fought back from 1–0 to record a 2–1 win. He retained his place for the rest of the calendar year, and scored a hat-trick away against <a href="Chile%20national%20football%20team">Chile</a> on 17 December. He was voted Soviet Footballer of the Year at the end of the season, although he scored a relatively low six league goals during 1967, his lowest for a full season since his debut year of 1954.

Streltsov was dropped from the Soviet team for the first three national team matches of 1968. After featuring in a home friendly win over <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium</a> in April, he made his final appearance for the USSR in the 2–0 1968 European Championship quarter-final first leg loss to <a href="Hungary%20national%20football%20team">Hungary</a> on 4 May 1968. The Soviets beat Hungary 3–0 in Moscow a week later, without Streltsov, to qualify for the final tournament on aggregate. Streltsov was left out of the tournament squad, and never played for the USSR again; after his final appearance, his international tally stood at 25 goals in 38 matches. Torpedo won the Soviet Cup during the 1968 season, overcoming <a href="Uzbek%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Uzbek</a> side <a href="FC%20Pakhtakor%20Tashkent">Pakhtakor Tashkent</a> 1–0 in the final. Streltsov retained his title of Soviet Footballer of the Year after scoring the highest seasonal total of his career, 21 (in the league), but was moved back to <a href="midfielder">midfield</a> before the 1969 season and did not score in 23 league matches during his final two years. He retired from football in 1970, at the age of 33, leaving his final league record for Torpedo over both spells standing at 99 goals from 222 games.

Following a footballing career <a href="List%20of%20one-club%20men%20in%20association%20football">spent exclusively with Torpedo</a>, Streltsov, a supporter of <a href="FC%20Spartak%20Moscow">Spartak Moscow</a>, repeatedly complained about his failure to play for his favourite team. After his retirement, Torpedo continued to pay his salary to fund his study of football coaching at the Institute of Physical Culture. Streltsov returned to Torpedo in the capacity of youth team manager following his qualification; he also spent a brief spell as manager of the first team before returning to the youth team in 1982. He also took part in matches contested by former players before dying in 1990 from <a href="esophageal%20cancer">throat cancer</a>, which his first wife Alla later claimed had been brought about by <a href="radiation">irradiated</a> food served to him in the camps. Seven years later, Marina Lebedeva, the woman Streltsov had confessed to raping, was seen laying flowers at his grave in Moscow on the day after the anniversary of his death.

Olympic policy in 1956 was to award gold medals only to members of the winning football squad who had played in the final match. Since Streltsov did not play in the final, he did not receive a medal. He was posthumously given a gold medal in 2006, after this policy was changed retroactively to allow all members of winning Olympic squads to receive medals.

Many critics consider Streltsov to be one of the finest footballers ever from Russia or the Soviet Union: British journalist and author Jonathan Wilson describes him as "the greatest outfield player Russia has ever produced ... a tall, powerful forward, possessed of a fine first touch and extraordinary footballing intelligence", while Russian author Aleksandr Nilin writes that "the boy came to us from the land of wonder". Streltsov's skilful, innovative style of play helped him to stand out in Soviet football, and his pioneering of the back-heeled pass resulted in it becoming known in Russia as "Streltsov's pass". During his early career, this technical ability combined with considerable speed and physical presence to create a formidable all-round forward player. In his later years, with his physical attributes reduced, he emphasised his skill and on-field intelligence to become more of a playmaker, playing further back and setting up attacking moves for team-mates rather than leading them himself. Indeed, for his final two seasons, Streltsov played in an attacking midfield role rather than up front. Despite the eight-year gap between his two spells as a member of the Soviet national team, Streltsov, nicknamed "The Russian <a href="Pel%C3%A9">Pelé</a>", was the fourth highest international goalscorer in the country's history.
Torpedo Moscow's ground, <a href="Eduard%20Streltsov%20Stadium">Torpedo Stadium</a>, was redubbed the "Eduard Streltsov Stadium" in 1996. A year later, the <a href="Russian%20Football%20Union">Russian Football Union</a> introduced the Strelyets prizes as the most prestigious individual honours in Russian football, awarded annually to the best manager in the Russian league and the best players in each position until discontinued in 2003. A statue of Streltsov was constructed within Moscow's <a href="Luzhniki%20Olympic%20Complex">Luzhniki Olympic Complex</a> in 1998, and another was erected by Torpedo outside the stadium bearing his name during the following year.

The Streltsov Committee, formed in 2001, was founded to attempt to have Streltsov's conviction of rape posthumously overturned. The campaign's leader, <a href="chess">chess</a> champion <a href="Anatoly%20Karpov">Anatoly Karpov</a>, claimed in 2001 that the conviction had prevented Streltsov from becoming the world's best player. The <a href="Central%20Bank%20of%20Russia">Central Bank of the Russian Federation</a> paid tribute to Streltsov in 2010, when it minted a commemorative two-<a href="Russian%20ruble">ruble</a> coin bearing his likeness. The coin was one of three minted as part of the "Outstanding Sportsmen of Russia" series; the other two pieces bore the faces of footballers <a href="Lev%20Yashin">Lev Yashin</a> and <a href="Konstantin%20Beskov">Konstantin Beskov</a>, respectively.

Louis Riel (comics)

Louis Riel is a historical biography in <a href="comics">comics</a> by Canadian cartoonist <a href="Chester%20Brown">Chester Brown</a>, published as a book in 2003 after serializion in 1999–2003. The story deals with <a href="M%C3%A9tis%20people%20%28Canada%29">Métis</a> rebel leader <a href="Louis%20Riel">Louis Riel</a>'s antagonistic relationship with the newly established <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">Canadian government</a>. It begins shortly before the 1869 <a href="Red%20River%20Rebellion">Red River Rebellion</a>, and ends with Riel's 1885 hanging for <a href="Treason%20Act%201351">high treason</a>. The book explores Riel's possible <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>—he believed God had named him Prophet of the New World, destined to lead the Métis people to freedom.

The work is noted for its emotional disengagement, its intentionally flat dialogue, and a minimalist drawing style inspired by that of <a href="Harold%20Gray">Harold Gray</a>'s comic strip "<a href="Little%20Orphan%20Annie">Little Orphan Annie</a>". Unusual for comics of the time, it includes a full scholarly apparatus: a foreword, index, bibliography, and end notes. The lengthy, hand-lettered appendix provides insight into Brown's creative process and biases and highlights where he changed historical facts to create a more engaging story, such as incorporating a conspiracy theory not widely accepted by historians. Brown became interested in the issue of property rights while researching the book, which led to a public change in his politics from <a href="anarchism">anarchism</a> to <a href="libertarianism">libertarianism</a>.

Although Brown intended it to be published only in book form, his publisher had him first serialize "Louis Riel" as a comic book, which lasted ten issues. The series was the first comic book to receive a grant from the <a href="Canada%20Council">Canada Council for the Arts</a>. It won a favourable critical reception and three <a href="Harvey%20Award">Harvey Award</a>s. The serialization sold poorly, but the book version was a surprise bestseller. Its success played a major part in gaining shelf space for serious <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a>s in mainstream North American bookstores.

Subtitled "A Comic-Strip Biography", "Louis Riel" looks at <a href="M%C3%A9tis%20people%20%28Canada%29">Métis</a> rebel leader <a href="Louis%20Riel">Louis Riel</a> and his leadership in the <a href="Red%20River%20Rebellion">Red River</a> and <a href="North-West%20Rebellion">North-West</a> rebellions. It does not attempt a complete retelling of Riel's life—it omits long periods and ignores many aspects of his personality. Instead the focus is on his "antagonistic relationship with the <a href="Government%20of%20Canada">Canadian government</a>" from 1869 to 1885. The story comprises 241 pages of the 271-page book, and is supplemented with a complete <a href="Critical%20apparatus">scholarly apparatus</a>: a foreword, bibliography, <a href="index%20%28publishing%29">index</a>, map section and extensive end notes. It has strong <a href="Historiography">historiographical</a> elements, detailing in the appendix the research done and choices made by the author in developing a story.

Brown grew up in the Canadian province of <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, where the majority speaks French, and where Riel is often considered a martyr. However Brown, who grew up speaking only English, said he was largely ignorant of Riel's story until he read <a href="Maggie%20Siggins">Maggie Siggins</a>' 1994 biography "Louis Riel: A Life of Revolution". Many of Brown's favourite topics are entwined in "Louis Riel": <a href="anti-authoritarianism">anti-authoritarianism</a>, outsider religion, <a href="insanity">insanity</a>, and accuracy and objectivity in nonfiction. A central incident in the book is an eight-panel sequence in which Riel has a revelatory experience on a hilltop in Washington, D.C. He experiences visions and talks to God, who declares him Prophet of the New World and instructs him to lead his people to freedom. On the cover of the book, however, we see Riel standing alone in the wilderness, staring into the sky, leaving open the question of whether what he witnessed was real.

In 1995, Brown published the <a href="anti-psychiatry">anti-psychiatry</a> comics essay "<a href="The%20Little%20Man%20%28comics%29%23My%20Mom%20was%20a%20Schizophrenic">My Mom was a Schizophrenic</a>", in which he examines society's role in mental illness, and questions the medical profession's accepted beliefs about it. The six-page strip came with two pages of end notes gathered from his research. Brown enjoyed this project and thought he would like to take on another in which he could "cram a lot of research into a comic strip". When he came across Siggins' biography of Riel, he had been working on the experimental "<a href="Underwater%20%28comics%29">Underwater</a>" series, a project on which he felt he had lost his way. His father died in late 1997, and he decided he did not "want to waste time with projects that weren't working out". In 1998, he turned his attention to Riel, putting the unpopular "Underwater" series on hold.

While researching, Brown came across two books by political scientist <a href="Tom%20Flanagan%20%28political%20scientist%29">Tom Flanagan</a>: "Louis "David" Riel: "Prophet of the New World"" (1996) and "Louis Riel and the Rebellion: 1885 Reconsidered" (2000). Brown found ""Prophet of the New World"" particularly intriguing as it dealt with Riel's religious ideas while reevaluating his alleged diagnosis of mental illness, two topics Brown had especial interest in, as he had previously made "eccentric" <a href="Chester%20Brown%27s%20Gospel%20adaptations">adaptations of the Gospel</a>, and comics dealing with his mother's <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>. He also came across books by researcher Don McLean and historian Douglas N. Sprague that advanced the <a href="conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy theory</a> that the 1885 North-West Rebellion was deliberately provoked by Prime Minister <a href="John%20A.%20Macdonald">John A. Macdonald</a> to gain support for the building of the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway%23Building%20the%20railway%2C%201881%E2%80%931885">transcontinental railway</a>.

Brown had gained a reputation for improvised storytelling by the time he began work on "Louis Riel". With "Underwater", he had intended to write a script, but in the end chose to improvise. He found the results unsatisfactory, and decided to write a full script beforehand for his next project. The script for "Louis Riel" came to over 200 pages.

Brown's was not the first depiction of the Métis leader in comics. <a href="James%20Simpkins">James Simpkins</a>, a Canadian cartoonist best known for Jasper the Bear, made a mildly anti-Riel two-page strip in 1967, and Pierre Dupuis produced a French-language two-page summary in 1979. A 23-page pro-Riel strip appeared in "Canadian History Comic Book No. 2: Rebellion" in 1972. In 1980, Italian artist <a href="Hugo%20Pratt">Hugo Pratt</a> created a character called <a href="Jesuit%20Joe">Jesuit Joe</a> who was supposed to have descended from Riel. Publishing house Les Éditions des Plaines published two books on Riel: Robert Freynet's 58-page (""Louis Riel in Comics"") in 1990, and Zoran and Toufik's (""Louis Riel, the Father of Manitoba"") in 1996, both in French. Riel also played a secondary role in the 1995 <a href="Franco-Belgian%20comics">comic album</a> (""The Twilight of <a href="Bois-Br%C3%BBl%C3%A9s">Bois-Brûlés</a>"").

The government of the <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">new Dominion of Canada</a> (established 1867), under Prime Minister John A. Macdonald, has made a deal with the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> to purchase <a href="Rupert%27s%20Land">Rupert's Land</a>—vast tracts of land in northern North America. The French-speaking Métis—people who are half <a href="Aboriginal%20peoples%20in%20Canada">Native</a>, half <a href="White%20people">white</a>, and inhabit parts of Rupert's Land—dispute that their land can be sold to the Canadians without their consent. In the <a href="Red%20River%20Colony">Red River settlement</a>, the Métis, led by Louis Riel, dodge political manoeuverings on the part of Lieutenant Governor <a href="William%20McDougall%20%28politician%29">William McDougall</a> and some of the English-speaking settlers, while seizing <a href="Fort%20Garry">Fort Garry</a>. After an armed standoff at English-speaking settler <a href="John%20Christian%20Schultz">John Schultz</a>'s home, the Métis declare a provisional government and vote Riel their president, with an even number of French and English representatives. Schultz escapes from prison and rounds up a number of men with the intention of freeing the prisoners from Fort Garry, but when Riel lets the prisoners go, Schultz's men set out for home. On the way, a number of them pass Fort Garry, where they are captured and imprisoned. One of the prisoners, Thomas Scott, relentlessly quarrels with the guards, showering them with racial epithets. Eventually, the provisional government convicts him of treason and executes him by firing squad. The remaining prisoners are released, and the provisional government enters into negotiations with Ottawa, which results in the founding of the province of <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>. They are unable to get an <a href="amnesty">amnesty</a> for the execution of Scott, however. The Canadian army arrives, ostensibly to keep the peace. Riel flees to the U.S., and the anglophone population assumes governance.

Schultz takes control of Manitoba, and the government of <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> offers a cash reward for Riel's capture, dead or alive. Macdonald secretly sends Riel money to disappear, as his death would lose him votes in Quebec but allowing him to live would cost him votes in English Canada. Riel flees from town to town in the U.S. as <a href="bounty%20hunter">bounty hunter</a>s try to track him down. In 1873, he returns to the Manitoba and wins a seat in the federal <a href="Parliament%20of%20Canada">Parliament</a> in a by-election. He fears actually sitting in parliament because there is still a bounty on his head, and continues to live in hiding. In 1874, he wins his seat again. Schultz wins a seat in the settlement as well, however, and <a href="Alexander%20Mackenzie%20%28politician%29">Alexander Mackenzie</a> has become Prime Minister, running on promises not to grant the rebels an amnesty. Riel is expelled from Parliament for failing to sit, but wins his seat again in the next by-election. The frustrated government finally extends an amnesty to the rebels—all except Riel, whose amnesty is conditional on a five-year banishment from Canada. During his exile, he has a <a href="Vision%20%28spirituality%29">visionary experience</a> on a hilltop in Washington, D.C., in which God names him David, the Prophet of the New World, and tells him to lead the Métis to freedom. In 1876, Riel is secretly committed by a friend to a lunatic asylum near Montréal under a false name.

Over the next several years, the Métis, unhappy with the Canadian government's handling of their land rights, move farther west across the <a href="Canadian%20Prairies">Prairies</a>. There as well, they see their petitions to the government repeatedly ignored and their rights trampled on. Finally, after being ignored for too long, the Métis search for Riel in <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, in the hope that his return will force the Canadians to take their claims seriously. He is reluctant at first, as he has started a family and settled down as a schoolmaster. In the hopes that he will get money from the Canadian government for his tenure administering the Red River settlement (by this time known as <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>), he moves his family to <a href="Batoche%2C%20Saskatchewan">Batoche</a> (now in <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>) in mid-1884. Macdonald has returned to the prime ministership and conspires with <a href="George%20Stephen%2C%201st%20Baron%20Mount%20Stephen">George Stephen</a>, president of the financially burdened <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a>, to use the situation to gain support for finishing the railway. By inciting a violent revolt amongst the Métis, the government can justify funding the railway to move troops to the Prairies. The Métis under Riel respond with arms as intended. Riel declares "Rome has fallen!" and breaks from the Catholic Church. He breathes the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> into his followers, thereafter known as the <a href="Exovedate">Exovedate</a>. Tensions build until the bloodshed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Duck%20Lake">Battle of Duck Lake</a>, where Riel and his followers drive back the <a href="North-West%20Mounted%20Police">North-West Mounted Police</a>. Macdonald takes this as a cue to send two thousand troops to the area. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fish%20Creek">Battle of Fish Creek</a>, the outnumbered Métis manage to drive back the Canadians, but at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Batoche">Battle of Batoche</a>, while Riel is increasingly immersed in religious activities, the Métis finally suffer defeat. In the hope that his trial will provide an opportunity to get the Métis' story to the public, Riel surrenders instead of fleeing.

In July 1885, Riel is put on trial in Regina for his role as leader in the North-West Rebellion. Against his will, Riel's lawyer tries unsuccessfully to defend him on grounds of insanity. He is found guilty of <a href="Treason%20Act%201351">high treason</a>. Though the jury pleads for mercy, he is sentenced to hang. In response to the pleas of Quebeckers to pardon Riel, Macdonald responds, "He shall hang though every dog in Quebec bark in his favour". After reconciling himself with the Church, Riel is hanged in Regina on 16 November 1885. In the aftermath, the remaining rebels receive a pardon, Macdonald and Stephen continue in their success, and Riel's wife dies.

Riel (1844–85) was a French-speaking Métis politician from a devoutly Catholic background. He founded and named the Province of Manitoba (a <a href="Cree%20language">Cree</a> word meaning "the god that speaks"). He led the two Métis rebellions against the Canadian government: the Red River Rebellion of 1869–70 and the North-West Rebellion of 1885. Following the latter, he was hanged for high treason. Riel remains an ambiguous and controversial figure in <a href="History%20of%20Canada">Canadian history</a>, and Brown's depiction maintains that ambiguity.

Riel is depicted as charismatic. He is Montréal-educated and speaks English, which makes him a natural leader to the Métis, though his leadership is flawed—he ignores the military advice of his peers in battle, placing his faith in God that the Métis will defeat the Canadians. Brown depicts him as having a <a href="Messiah%20complex">messianic complex</a> and possibly having schizophrenia. He is unsure of himself, averse to bloodshed, and easily convinced to flee to the U.S. to avoid capture.

Macdonald (1815–91) was the first <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister of Canada</a>, in office 1867–73, and again 1878–91. Brown depicts the Prime Minister in the role of scheming villain and <a href="caricature">caricature</a>s his features in an absurd manner, giving him an extremely oversized nose and showing him as a drunk. He is a man of ambitions and will not let anyone stand in the way of his legacy. In the appendix, however, Brown discloses that he does not see Macdonald as the villain he has portrayed in the book. Brown's distrust of <a href="big%20government">big government</a> leads him to push the conspiracy theory side of the story to Macdonald's detriment, but, in the end, he states that he "would rather have lived in a state run by John A. Macdonald than one run by Louis Riel".

"Louis Riel" is noted for its emotional restraint, and intentionally flat and expository dialogue. To critic Rich Kreiner the book "has been rigorously scrubbed of staged drama and crowd-pleasing effects". It avoids manipulation of the reader by invoking sympathy or sentiment. Brown takes a distanced approach and relies faithfully on his source material—he focuses on the concrete and corporeal and eschews techniques of speculation such as thought balloons. This includes his presentation of Riel's mystical experiences, which Brown presents plainly and without interpretation of its reality or lack thereof.

The book makes frequent deliberate use of silent panels, focused on imagery with the narrative moved forward by the characters' actions. Riel's "despairs over the decisions he makes" are expressed through pictures, as Brown had come to believe that historical comics had been too "narration-heavy". He wanted "Louis Riel" "to show what the medium is capable of", and made use of greater panel-to-panel continuity. While the grid of panels gives a feeling of page symmetry, the pages are not composed as a unit—scenes change anywhere on the page with little regard to page layout.

Printed on yellowish paper, each page conforms strictly to a rhythmic six-panel grid, in contrast to the free placement of panels that characterized Brown's <a href="Chester%20Brown%27s%20autobiographical%20comics">autobiographical period</a>. Tone and mood are set by the composition of the panels, as during Riel's trial when all tonal variation is dropped, and the white figures are placed against a heavy black background, which emphasizes the claustrophobic atmosphere.

Brown makes the language barriers that separate the characters visual by having Riel drop the letter "h" in his dialogue (e.g. "over t'e last several days") and by putting French-language dialogue in ⟨<a href="Bracket%23Angle%20brackets%20or%20chevrons%20%E2%9F%A8%20%E2%9F%A9">chevron brackets</a>⟩ and <a href="Cree%20language">Cree language</a> dialogue in ⟨⟨double-chevrons⟩⟩. He shows Riel, who was an educated and sophisticated speaker of French, struggling with English. These touches emphasize that English was not yet a dominant language in the regions in which the story unfolds. Brown uses consistent semantics in his <a href="speech%20balloon">speech balloon</a>s; the size and weight of the dialogue varies according to speech patterns, and sound effects vary according to how close they are to the reader.

Brown's drawing style had always changed from project to project. He frequently cited <a href="Harold%20Gray">Harold Gray</a> of "<a href="Little%20Orphan%20Annie">Little Orphan Annie</a>" as the primary influence on the drawing style of "Louis Riel"—restrained artwork which avoids extreme closeups, and blank-eyed characters with large bodies, small heads, and oversized noses. Gray's drawing and compositional style was well suited to the subject of "Louis Riel". Gray often used his strip as a public platform for politics, and "Louis Riel" was also very public and outward-looking. This approach is in great contrast to the inward-looking comics Brown had previously been known for—notably his autobiographical work. His <a href="Hatching">cross-hatching</a> style was reminiscent of the editorial cartoonists of Riel's time. Gray's outdoor scenes were inspired by the Illinois plains of Gray's youth, terrain similar to that of Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

Brown also acknowledges significant debts to <a href="Jaxon">Jack Jackson</a>'s historical comics, <a href="Herg%C3%A9">Hergé</a>'s "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Tintin">The Adventures of Tintin</a>", and the extremely exaggerated style of <a href="Larry%20Gonick">Larry Gonick</a>'s "<a href="The%20Cartoon%20History%20of%20the%20Universe">Cartoon History of the Universe</a>". He says he referred to <a href="Jack%20Hamm">Jack Hamm</a>'s "How to Draw Animals" when drawing the horses that appear frequently throughout the book, which were rendered running with their legs splayed, as an artist may have depicted them in the days before the influence of <a href="Eadweard%20Muybridge">Eadweard Muybridge</a>'s photographs of bodies in motion. Brown drew each of the 1325 panels separately on watercolour paper on a block of wood he placed on his lap in lieu of a <a href="Drawing%20board">drawing table</a>, which allowed him seamlessly to rearrange, insert, and delete panels as he saw fit. The drawings were <a href="Inker">finished</a> using both a thin <a href="ink%20brush">ink brush</a> (no larger than size 0) and <a href="dip%20pen">dip pen</a> with a <a href="Speedball%20%28art%20products%29">Hunt</a> 102 <a href="nib%20%28pen%29">nib</a> and black ink.

When he began "Louis Riel", Brown had increasingly been making use of notes and appendices in his work, beginning with his researching and annotating the 1994 comics essay, "My Mom was a Schizophrenic". He added appendices to the 1998 collection of short strips, "<a href="The%20Little%20Man%20%28comics%29">The Little Man</a>", and the 2002 reprinting of "<a href="I%20Never%20Liked%20You">I Never Liked You</a>". In "Louis Riel", the appendix totalled 23 pages, along with a bibliography and an index. <a href="Alan%20Moore">Alan Moore</a>'s use of extensive end notes in his and <a href="Eddie%20Campbell">Eddie Campbell</a>'s "<a href="From%20Hell">From Hell</a>", another fictional reconstruction of a historical event, influenced Brown's appendices. In the comics essay "Dance of the Gull Catchers" which closes the "From Hell" appendices, Moore metaphorically reveals to the reader the myriad choices he could have made from the available historical evidence when putting together his version of the <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a> story.

Allowing him to "tell the best story and tell the truth", Brown's notes were self-reflexive, and drew attention to the artistic choices he made when putting together the book. Brown makes explicit the inaccuracies in the book, as when he realized his drawings of William McDougall did not match up with descriptions of him by biographers as a "portly" and "heavily built man". Brown chose not to redraw McDougall's scenes, deciding he "could live with that level of inaccuracy". He also admits that he deliberately changed some of the historical details, as when he has Prime Minister Macdonald in talks with the Hudson's Bay Company in London—Macdonald was not in London at that time and did not directly participate in the negotiations. In other instances, Brown noted where he paid special care to historical details: the dialogue of <a href="Trial%20of%20Louis%20Riel">Riel's trial</a> comes directly from court transcripts. Brown makes clear in his notes the amount of research undertaken for the book, emphasizing both its authenticity and his desire to show the different aspects of Riel's ambiguous story. Many of his changes were made for space considerations, as he intended to limit the book to about two hundred pages.

The notes range from nearly insignificant details to major discrepancies and deliberate distortions. They have a self-deprecatory tone that is common in North American comics, tracing its roots to the awkwardly self-aware <a href="underground%20comix">underground comix</a> of the 1960s and 1970s. They also reveal Brown's process in shaping the story from conflicting sources. He acknowledges some of the more capricious details. He explains he was not committed to the conspiracy theory he presented, but included it in order to present Macdonald in a certain light: "[V]illains are fun in a story", he said, and he was "trying to tell this tale in an engaging manner". He also included a "Major-General <a href="Thomas%20Bland%20Strange">Thomas Bland Strange</a>" in an 1885 meeting at which the general was not actually present. Brown explains that he included Strange because he was amused by the Major-General's name.

Brown originally meant "Louis Riel" to be published in book form, but his publisher, Chris Oliveros, convinced him to serialize it first. <a href="Drawn%20and%20Quarterly">Drawn and Quarterly</a> published the ten comic-book instalments from 1999 until 2003. Brown was granted <a href="Canadian%20dollar">CA$</a>6000 by the <a href="Canada%20Council">Canadian Council for the Arts</a> in 2001 to assist in its completion. The full volume appeared in hardcover in 2003 and softcover in 2006. The book sold out its first printing in two months, went through multiple printings, and had sold fifty thousand copies by the beginning of 2011. The original serialization sold poorly, which made the book's success a surprise.

The comic book and the collection both came with an extensive appendix, and the collection came with a bibliography and an index, all hand-lettered by Brown. The collection's appendix came to 22 pages.

In the original serialization, as the series progressed the influence of Harold Gray became stronger. The characters' heads became smaller while their bodies and hands grew larger, with Riel appearing "like the <a href="Hulk">Hulk</a> in a wool suit" after his hilltop religious revelation. Brown redrew many of the earlier drawings to make them consistent with the later ones in the collected edition. He added backgrounds, redrew, added or deleted panels to improve page rhythms or make chapter divisions cleaner, and reshaped or relettered word ballons. Dialogue remained intact for the most part, although the slur "frog" for the French-speaking Métis was replaced with "half-breed".

In 2012, Drawn and Quarterly first began offering comics in <a href="e-book">e-book</a> format, prompted in part by Brown. His "Louis Riel" and "<a href="Paying%20for%20It">Paying for It</a>" were the first two books made available, though Brown is a print-lover who professes little interest in e-books, or computers in general. The non-exclusive deal was made with Toronto-based <a href="Kobo%20Inc.">Kobo Inc.</a> A tenth-anniversary edition in 2013 included sketches and other supplemental material.

French and Italian editions appeared in 2004—the Italian from <a href="Coconino%20Press">Coconino Press</a> and the French from the Belgian publisher <a href="Casterman">Casterman</a>. To appeal to francophones in Europe, where Riel is not well known, Casterman had the book titled "Louis Riel: l'insurgé" (""Louis Riel: Rebel""). The Montreal-based publisher <a href="La%20Past%C3%A8que">La Pastèque</a> obtained the rights to the book and re-released it as "Louis Riel" with a different cover in 2012.

Though not the first work of biography in comics, Louis Riel was the first completed of its length and depth. The book sold well, and became the first graphic novel to reach Canada's non-fiction bestseller list. A critical and commercial success, it was especially popular with libraries and schools. Comics academic Jeet Heer states that it has perhaps sold more copies in Canada than any other graphic novel. "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>" called it "a strong contender for the best graphic novel ever", "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine included it in its annual Best Comix list in 2003, and, in 2009, the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" placed it on its list of the ten best books of "The Century So Far". It is regularly cited as being at the forefront of a trend in historical graphic novels, along with <a href="Art%20Spiegelman">Art Spiegelman</a>'s "<a href="Maus">Maus</a>" and <a href="Marjane%20Satrapi">Marjane Satrapi</a>'s "<a href="Persepolis%20%28comics%29">Persepolis</a>".

Especially in Canada, "Louis Riel" brought Brown out of the fringes into the mainstream, and also attracted more serious attention to graphic novels. It was the first work of comics to receive a grant from the Canada Council for the Arts (although Brown's libertarian politics have led him to condemn the government for handing out grants), and helped pave the way for the Council's special category for graphic novels. The book was <a href="Option%20%28filmmaking%29">optioned</a> for a movie by <a href="Bruce%20McDonald%20%28director%29">Bruce McDonald</a> and another film director, though the project never started filming.

Researching Riel had a significant impact on Brown's thinking. When he started the book, he considered himself an <a href="Anarchism">anarchist</a>. His intention was to write an anti-government book, and had a bias in Riel's favour—despite what Brown considered Riel's own political conservatism—as Riel opposed the government. Over the course of drawing the book, he came to sympathize more with Macdonald. His reading led him in 1998 to "The Noblest Triumph: Property and Prosperity Through the Ages" by <a href="Tom%20Bethell">Tom Bethell</a>, which led him change his own politics to favour <a href="libertarianism">libertarianism</a>. He later ran for parliament as representative of the <a href="Libertarian%20Party%20of%20Canada">Libertarian Party of Canada</a>, to the dismay of his friends. At one point, after Brown had started drawing the book, he tried to rewrite the script to reflect his changed perspective, but found it too difficult and stayed with the original script. He revealed his new beliefs only in the appendix.

Reviewer Dennis Duffy commended Brown's research, but stated Brown "often cheats" in assigning forethought to Macdonald's action unattested in historical documents. Critic Rich Kreiner found that Brown's disengaged approach to "Louis Riel" invited a <a href="Reader-response%20criticism">reader-response</a> approach to reading it. As an example, it was the impetus for an in-depth, three-part interview conducted by <a href="Dave%20Sim">Dave Sim</a> in the pages of his comic book "<a href="Cerebus%20the%20Aardvark">Cerebus</a>", which Sim uses as an opportunity to apply his own idiosyncratic views to an interpretation of events in Brown's book.

The Montreal-based RustWerk ReFinery adapted the book in 2016 as "Louis Riel: A Comic-Strip Stage Play". The bilingual play uses black-and-white cut-out puppets, live actors, and shadow imagery.

CM Punk

Phillip Jack Brooks (born October 26, 1978), better known by the <a href="ring%20name">ring name</a> CM Punk, is an American <a href="mixed%20martial%20artist">mixed martial artist</a>, comic book writer and retired <a href="Professional%20wrestling">professional wrestler</a>. He is currently signed to both the <a href="Ultimate%20Fighting%20Championship">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a> (UFC), where he competes in the <a href="Welterweight%20%28MMA%29">welterweight</a> division, and to <a href="Cage%20Fury%20Fighting%20Championships">Cage Fury Fighting Championships</a> (CFFC), where he works as a commentator. He is perhaps best known for his time in <a href="WWE">WWE</a>, where he is recognized as the <a href="List%20of%20WWE%20Champions">sixth longest reigning WWE Champion of all-time</a>.

Brooks began his professional wrestling career on the American <a href="independent%20circuit">independent circuit</a>, primarily with <a href="Ring%20of%20Honor">Ring of Honor</a> (ROH) until 2005, when he signed with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). During his 15-year career, Brooks won the <a href="WWE%20Championship">WWE Championship</a> twice, WWE's <a href="World%20Heavyweight%20Championship%20%28WWE%29">World Heavyweight Championship</a> three times, and the <a href="ECW%20World%20Heavyweight%20Championship">ECW</a> and <a href="ROH%20World%20Championship">ROH World Championship</a>s once each. By winning WWE's <a href="World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship%20%28WWE%29">World Tag Team Championship</a> (with <a href="Kofi%20Kingston">Kofi Kingston</a>) and <a href="WWE%20Intercontinental%20Championship">Intercontinental Championship</a>, he became WWE's <a href="Triple%20Crown%20%28professional%20wrestling%29%23WWE">19th Triple Crown Champion</a> and the fastest to achieve this feat, in 203 days. He was voted WWE Superstar of the Year at the <a href="2011%20Slammy%20Awards">2011 Slammy Awards</a>, and <a href="PWI%20Wrestler%20of%20the%20Year">Wrestler of the Year</a> in 2011 and 2012 by readers of "<a href="Pro%20Wrestling%20Illustrated">Pro Wrestling Illustrated</a>".

Brooks used the CM Punk moniker his entire career, and consistently portrayed the <a href="Gimmick%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">character</a> of an outspoken, sharp-tongued, <a href="anti-establishment">anti-establishment</a>, <a href="straight%20edge">straight edge</a> <a href="wikt%3A%20iconoclastic">iconoclast</a>. Most of the straight edge principles he portrayed, such as not drinking <a href="Alcoholic%20beverage">alcohol</a> or not taking <a href="Recreational%20drug%20use">recreational drugs</a>, are his <a href="real%20life">real life</a> views. Depending on his alignment as a <a href="Face%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">hero</a> or <a href="Heel%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">villain</a>, he emphasized different aspects of the straight edge culture to garner the desired audience <a href="Heat%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">reaction</a>.

After becoming disgruntled in WWE, Punk retired from professional wrestling in 2014. He pursued a career in mixed martial arts and was signed by the UFC in December of that year. His first professional fight took place on September 10, 2016, at <a href="UFC%20203">UFC 203</a> against <a href="Mickey%20Gall">Mickey Gall</a>, where he was defeated via submission in the first round. He lost his second bout to Mike Jackson via unanimous decision on June 9, 2018, at <a href="UFC%20225">UFC 225</a>.

Brooks was born in <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>, and raised in nearby <a href="Lockport%2C%20Illinois">Lockport, Illinois</a>. He is one of five children—his father was an engineer, while his mother was a homemaker. Brooks' father struggled with <a href="alcoholism">alcoholism</a> which inspired him to become <a href="straight%20edge">straight edge</a> from an early age. He attended <a href="Lockport%20Township%20High%20School">Lockport Township High School</a>.

Brooks' first venture into wrestling was a stint in a <a href="backyard%20wrestling">backyard wrestling</a> federation called the Lunatic Wrestling Federation with his friends and brother Mike Brooks in the mid-late 1990s. Brooks first started using the <a href="ring%20name">ring name</a> CM Punk when he was put into a <a href="tag%20team">tag team</a> named The Chick Magnets with CM Venom after another performer skipped out on the <a href="Card%20%28sports%29">card</a>. Unlike his friends, Punk genuinely wanted to be a wrestler and saw it as more than simple fun. When the promotion started taking off, doing shows out of a warehouse in <a href="Mokena%2C%20Illinois">Mokena, Illinois</a>, Punk found out that his brother Mike had embezzled thousands of dollars from the small company, causing them to become estranged and not have spoken since.

Brooks soon left the federation and enrolled as a student at the Steel Dominion wrestling school in Chicago, where he was trained by <a href="Ace%20Steel">Ace Steel</a>, Danny Dominion and Kevin Quinn to become a professional wrestler. As part of the training, he wrestled at Steel Domain Wrestling in St. Paul, Minnesota. It was in the Steel Domain that he met Scott Colton, who soon adopted the stage name <a href="Colt%20Cabana">Colt Cabana</a>. Punk and Cabana became best friends and spent most of their early career together working in the same <a href="Independent%20circuit">independent</a> promotions, as both opponents and tag team partners. In the independents, along with fellow Steel Domain graduates Colt Cabana, Chucke E. Smooth, <a href="Adam%20Pearce">Adam Pearce</a> and <a href="Manager%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">manager</a> Dave Prazak, Punk formed an <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20stable">alliance</a> named the Gold Bond Mafia.

Punk's home <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20promotion">promotion</a> for his early career was considered to be the <a href="Independent%20Wrestling%20Association%20Mid-South">Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South</a> (IWA Mid-South). During Punk's time in IWA Mid-South, he had high-profile feuds with Colt Cabana and <a href="Chris%20Hero">Chris Hero</a> while also rising to the top of the roster winning the <a href="IWA%20Mid-South%20Light%20Heavyweight%20Championship">IWA Mid-South Light Heavyweight Championship</a> twice and the <a href="IWA%20Mid-South%20Heavyweight%20Championship">IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship</a> on five separate occasions, beating wrestlers like <a href="A.J.%20Styles">A.J. Styles</a>, Cabana and <a href="Eddie%20Guerrero">Eddie Guerrero</a> in matches for the heavyweight championship. Punk's feud with Hero included a 55-minute <a href="Tables%2C%20Ladders%2C%20and%20Chairs%20match">Tables, Ladders and Chairs (TLC) match</a>, a 93-minute <a href="two%20out%20of%20three%20falls%20match">two out of three falls match</a> and several 60-minute time limit draws. From July 2003 until May 2004, Punk refused to wrestle for IWA Mid-South, explaining this as a protest to <a href="Ian%20Rotten">Ian Rotten</a>'s mistreatment of Chris Hero in the company. However, Hero has stated he believes there were other reasons and Rotten's treatment of him was just an excuse by Punk to stop working for the company. Punk eventually returned to IWA Mid-South and continued to perform as a wrestler and commentator for them until July 2005.

Punk's matches with Colt Cabana led him to being hired by the <a href="Ring%20of%20Honor">Ring of Honor</a> (ROH) promotion. Initially, Punk joined ROH as a <a href="face%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">face</a>, but quickly turned <a href="Heel%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">heel</a> in a <a href="Feud%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">feud</a> with <a href="Raven%20%28wrestler%29">Raven</a> that featured numerous variants of <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23No%20disqualification%20match">no disqualification matches</a>. Their rivalry was rooted in Punk's straight-edge lifestyle, with him likening Raven to his alcoholic father; it lasted most of 2003 and was considered one of ROH's top feuds of the year. Their rivalry was settled at The Conclusion in November 2003, where Punk defeated Raven in a <a href="steel%20cage%20match">steel cage match</a>.

Punk started climbing the ranks of ROH, including coming in second at the Second Anniversary Show during the tournament to crown the first <a href="ROH%20Pure%20Championship">ROH Pure Champion</a>, losing to A.J. Styles in the finals and winning the <a href="ROH%20World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship">ROH Tag Team Championship</a> twice with Colt Cabana as The Second City Saints (Punk and Cabana defeated the <a href="Briscoe%20Brothers">Briscoe Brothers</a> to win the championship both times). Circa October 2003, Punk was hired as the first head trainer of the <a href="ROH%20Wrestling%20Academy">Ring of Honor wrestling school</a>, having previously been a trainer for the Steel Domain and Primetime Wrestling.

In 2004, Punk faced off against <a href="ROH%20World%20Championship">ROH World Champion</a> <a href="Samoa%20Joe">Samoa Joe</a> for the championship in a three-match series. On June 12 at World Title Classic, the first match resulted in a 60-minute time limit draw when neither Punk nor Joe could pin or cause the other to submit in the 60 minutes. On October 16 at Joe vs. Punk II, they wrestled to a second 60-minute draw. In addition to "Joe vs. Punk II" becoming Ring of Honor's best-selling DVD at the time, the match received a <a href="5-star%20match">five-star rating</a> by <a href="Dave%20Meltzer">Dave Meltzer</a>'s "<a href="Wrestling%20Observer%20Newsletter">Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a>". It was the first match in North America to receive a five-star rating in seven years, the last one being the <a href="Hell%20in%20a%20Cell">Hell in a Cell</a> match between <a href="Shawn%20Michaels">Shawn Michaels</a> and <a href="The%20Undertaker">The Undertaker</a> at in 1997. Joe ended the series by defeating Punk in the third and final match on December 4 at All-Star Extravaganza 2 in which there was a no-time-limit stipulation.
After a try-out match on May 9, 2005 which aired May 15, where he lost to <a href="Val%20Venis">Val Venis</a> on the "<a href="WWE%20Heat">Sunday Night Heat</a>" show, Punk accepted a deal offered by <a href="World%20Wrestling%20Entertainment">World Wrestling Entertainment</a> (WWE) in June. Though he had accepted the deal, Punk defeated <a href="Austin%20Aries">Austin Aries</a> to win the ROH World Championship on June 18 at Death Before Dishonor III. Immediately after the match, Punk proceeded to become a villain and started a storyline where he threatened to bring the ROH World Championship to WWE with him. For weeks, Punk teased the ROH locker room and the ROH fans as well as mocking the championship he possessed, going so far as to sign his WWE contract on it. During the storyline, referred to by ROH as the "Summer of Punk", <a href="Mick%20Foley">Mick Foley</a> made several ROH appearances, attempting to convince Punk to do the right thing and defend the title on his way out. On August 12, Punk lost the ROH World Championship to <a href="Jamie%20Noble">James Gibson</a> in a <a href="Three%20Way%20Dance">four corner elimination match</a> which also involved Samoa Joe and <a href="Christopher%20Daniels">Christopher Daniels</a>. Punk's final scheduled match in ROH took place at Punk: The Final Chapter on August 13, against long-time friend Colt Cabana in a <a href="two%20out%20of%20three%20falls%20match">two out of three falls match</a>, which he lost.

Punk made a special appearance at the ROH show Unscripted II on February 11, 2006, when the original card had to be scrapped due to <a href="Low%20Ki">Low Ki</a> leaving ROH the week prior. In addition, most of the ROH roster contracted to TNA were pulled from the show because of a snowstorm that TNA officials thought might prevent performers from reaching the TNA's <a href="Against%20All%20Odds%20%282006%29">Against All Odds</a> event scheduled the next day. In the main event, Punk teamed with <a href="Daniel%20Bryan">Bryan Danielson</a> to defeat Adam Pearce and <a href="Jimmy%20Rave">Jimmy Rave</a> in a <a href="tag%20team%20match">tag team match</a>.

While wrestling for Ring of Honor, Punk joined the wrestling promotion <a href="Total%20Nonstop%20Action%20Wrestling">NWA:Total Nonstop Action</a>, later known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), in which he was paired with <a href="Julio%20Dinero">Julio Dinero</a> as members of Raven's TNA alliance <a href="Raven%27s%20Nest%23The%20Gathering">The Gathering</a>.

Shortly before a TNA show on February 25, 2004, Punk had a physical scuffle with <a href="Teddy%20Hart">Teddy Hart</a> outside of a restaurant that was broken up by <a href="Sabu%20%28wrestler%29">Sabu</a>. The scuffle reportedly stemmed from an ROH show in which Hart performed <a href="Teddy%20Hart%23Ring%20of%20Honor%20and%20Total%20Nonstop%20Action%20Wrestling%20%282003%E2%80%932004%29">three unplanned spots</a> putting several other wrestlers in danger of injury. Around the time of the scuffle, Punk and Dinero stopped appearing on TNA shows, leading to speculation he was fired for the incident. However, Punk said the scuffle had no bearing on his TNA career. Brooks said the reason he and Dinero stopped appearing on <a href="List%20of%20Impact%20Wrestling%20pay-per-view%20events">TNA's pay-per-view events</a> was that TNA officials believed that he and Dinero had not connected with the fans as villains, having turned against the popular Raven and instead formed a villainous tag team managed by <a href="James%20Mitchell%20%28manager%29">James Mitchell</a>. The officials decided that since the team was not working as villains, the storyline would be put on hold indefinitely, and thus had no work for Punk or Dinero. Punk officially quit TNA in March 2004 during the <a href="Ring%20of%20Honor%23History">Rob Feinstein controversy</a> after having a dispute with the TNA offices over his ability to compete in ROH following a TNA order that their contracted wrestlers were to no longer wrestle in ROH.

In September 2005, Punk was assigned to <a href="Ohio%20Valley%20Wrestling">Ohio Valley Wrestling</a>, a WWE <a href="Farm%20team%23Professional%20wrestling">developmental territory</a>. He made his debut as a heel on September 8 in a <a href="dark%20match">dark match</a>, where he, <a href="Nigel%20McGuinness">Nigel McGuinness</a> and <a href="Paul%20Burchill">Paul Burchill</a> were defeated by <a href="Deuce%20%28wrestler%29">Deuce Shade</a>, <a href="Elijah%20Burke">Elijah Burke</a> and Seth Skyfire. On September 26 in his OVW television debut, Punk suffered a ruptured eardrum and broken nose after Danny Inferno hit him with an <a href="Botch%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">overly</a> <a href="Stiff%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">stiff</a> <a href="Punch%20%28combat%29">right hand</a>. Despite the injury, Punk finished the match and quickly recovered.
On November 9, Punk became the <a href="OVW%20Television%20Championship">OVW Television Champion</a> after defeating <a href="Kenny%20Dykstra">Ken Doane</a>, which immediately led to a feud between Punk and <a href="Brent%20Albright">Brent Albright</a>, who had previously been feuding with Doane for the Television Championship and had lost his chance to wrestle Doane after Punk hit him with a chair so he himself could wrestle Doane. They wrestled in series of matches, including one that ended in overtime with Albright having Punk submit to Albright's finisher, the <a href="Fujiwara%20armbar">Crowbar</a>, but Punk was able to keep the championship as he had not agreed to the extra time. On January 4, 2006, Punk lost the OVW Television Championship during a <a href="Three%20Way%20Dance">three-way dance</a> among himself, Albright and Doane. Doane was injured halfway through the match and was replaced by <a href="Damien%20Sandow">Aaron "The Idol" Stevens</a>. Punk submitted to Albright's Crowbar and was eliminated, but he returned later in the match to distract Albright, allowing Stevens to <a href="Pin%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">pin</a> Albright and become the new OVW Television Champion. Albright and Punk then briefly teamed, but they became opponents again after Punk denied Albright the respect he demanded and proceeded to continually "punk him out". This feud continued for weeks with Punk always coming out on top until a <a href="glossary%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23Double%20turn">double turn</a> occurred on February 1, when Albright turned heel during a tag team match, allowing the <a href="Spirit%20Squad">Spirit Squad</a> to attack Punk, turning him face. After <a href="Matt%20Cappotelli">Matt Cappotelli</a> vacated the <a href="OVW%20Heavyweight%20Championship">OVW Heavyweight Championship</a> because of a <a href="Astrocytoma">brain tumor</a> in February, a tournament was held to crown a new champion and Punk lost to Albright in the finals. Punk and Albright continued their feud, with Albright becoming more unstable and paranoid about maintaining his championship after several close call matches against Punk, resulting in acts such as threatening <a href="Maria%20Kanellis">Maria</a>. On May 3, Punk defeated Albright in a <a href="strap%20match">strap match</a> to win the OVW Heavyweight Championship. As champion, Punk retained the title in matches against opponents such as <a href="Shad%20Gaspard">Shad Gaspard</a>, <a href="Ken%20Anderson%20%28wrestler%29">Ken Kennedy</a>, <a href="Johnny%20Jeter">Johnny Jeter</a> and <a href="The%20Miz">Mike "The Miz" Mizanin</a>.

On July 28, Punk and Seth Skyfire defeated <a href="Cryme%20Tyme">Shad Gaspard and the Neighborhoodie</a> to win the <a href="OVW%20Southern%20Tag%20Team%20Championship">OVW Southern Tag Team Championship</a> at a <a href="house%20show">house show</a>. They lost the tag team championship on August 2 to <a href="Deuce%20%27n%20Domino">Deuce Shade and "Domino" Cliff Compton</a> after an injured Skyfire tagged in an already injured Punk. This altercation led to a feud between Punk and Skyfire after a rematch for the tag team championship on August 7 in which a healthy Punk purposefully tagged in an injured Skyfire to be beaten by Shade and Compton. On August 30, a match was scheduled to take place between Punk and Skyfire for the OVW Heavyweight Championship. However, prior to the match Skyfire was attacked by Charles "The Hammer" Evans, with whom Skyfire had also been feuding and was replaced in the match by Chet Jablonski who pinned Punk to win the OVW Heavyweight Championship. As Punk no longer possessed the championship, OVW no longer required him and he was removed from the roster and brought up to the WWE roster full-time. Punk continued to make sporadic appearances for OVW such as on their 400th TV episode until WWE and OVW ended their developmental partnership on February 7, 2008.

On June 24, 2006, Punk made his <a href="ECW%20%28WWE%20brand%29">ECW</a> debut during a house show at the former <a href="Asylum%20Arena">ECW Arena</a>, defeating <a href="Stevie%20Richards">Stevie Richards</a>. He made his TV debut on the July 4 "<a href="ECW%20on%20Sci%20Fi">ECW on Sci Fi</a>", cutting a brief pre-taped <a href="Pop%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">promo</a> about his <a href="straight%20edge">straight edge</a> lifestyle emphasizing the disciplinary aspects of being drug and alcohol free. Although he had retained the straight edge <a href="Gimmick%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">gimmick</a>, he now had a <a href="Muay%20Thai">Muay Thai</a> training background. Punk made his TV wrestling debut on August 1 at the <a href="Hammerstein%20Ballroom">Hammerstein Ballroom</a>, defeating <a href="Justin%20Credible">Justin Credible</a>. Punk established himself in ECW by going undefeated, defeating opponents such as <a href="C.%20W.%20Anderson">Christopher W. Anderson</a>, Stevie Richards and <a href="Shannon%20Moore">Shannon Moore</a>.

Soon after, Punk began feuding with <a href="Mike%20Knox">Mike Knox</a> after Knox's girlfriend <a href="Kelly%20Kelly">Kelly Kelly</a> was seen to have feelings for Punk. Punk defeated Knox in their first singles match as well as the rematch, after which Kelly Kelly celebrated Punk's victory over her boyfriend. Punk then teamed with <a href="D-Generation%20X">D-Generation X</a> and the <a href="Hardy%20Boyz">Hardy Boyz</a> in their <a href="Survivor%20Series%20%282006%29">Survivor Series</a> match against <a href="Rated-RKO">Rated-RKO</a>, Knox, <a href="John%20Morrison%20%28wrestler%29">Johnny Nitro</a> and <a href="Gregory%20Helms">Gregory Helms</a>, a match in which all the participants on DX's side survived elimination. On December 3 at December to Dismember, Punk participated in the Elimination Chamber match for the <a href="ECW%20World%20Heavyweight%20Championship">ECW World Championship</a>, but he was the first person eliminated by <a href="Rob%20Van%20Dam">Rob Van Dam</a>.
Following the event, Punk entered into a feud with <a href="Bob%20Holly">Hardcore Holly</a>, who ended Punk's six-month unbeaten streak in singles competition on January 9, 2007. Punk went on to feud with <a href="Matt%20Striker">Matt Striker</a>, who gave him his second singles loss since being in ECW on January 30. Punk then qualified for the <a href="Money%20in%20the%20Bank%20ladder%20match%232007">Money in the Bank ladder match</a> at <a href="WrestleMania%2023">WrestleMania 23</a> by defeating Johnny Nitro, but lost the match in his <a href="WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> debut on April 1. On April 10, Punk turned heel by joining the <a href="New%20Breed%20%28ECW%29">New Breed</a> alliance after several weeks in which both the New Breed and the <a href="ECW%20Originals">ECW Originals</a> had attempted to recruit him. However, two weeks later he betrayed the New Breed during a <a href="Six-man%20tag%20team%20match">four-on-four</a> <a href="Survivor%20Series%20Match">elimination match</a> between the New Breed and ECW Originals by kicking New Breed leader Elijah Burke in the back of the head and costing them the match, after which Punk proceeded to deliver his finisher, the "<a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Go%202%20Sleep">Go to Sleep</a>", on Burke and sarcastically apologized before leaving the ring alone, turning <a href="face%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">face</a> again. On May 20 at <a href="Judgment%20Day%20%282007%29">Judgment Day</a>, Punk defeated Burke in his first singles match on a <a href="List%20of%20WWE%20pay-per-view%20events">WWE pay-per-view event</a>. Punk then went on to <a href="One%20Night%20Stand%20%282007%29">One Night Stand</a> on June 3 and teamed up with <a href="Tommy%20Dreamer">Tommy Dreamer</a> and <a href="The%20Sandman%20%28wrestler%29">The Sandman</a> in a <a href="tables%20match">tables match</a> to defeat the New Breed and end the storyline.

When ECW World Champion <a href="Bobby%20Lashley">Bobby Lashley</a> was <a href="2007%20WWE%20draft">drafted</a> to <a href="Raw%20%28WWE%20brand%29">Raw</a> and stripped of the championship, a tournament to declare a new champion was held. On June 24, Punk was scheduled to face <a href="Chris%20Benoit">Chris Benoit</a> in the finals at , but Benoit was hastily replaced by Johnny Nitro when Benoit <a href="No%20show%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">no showed</a> after <a href="Chris%20Benoit%20double%20murder%20and%20suicide">killing his family and self</a>. Nitro subsequently defeated Punk for the vacant ECW Championship. Punk won another shot at the title at <a href="The%20Great%20American%20Bash%20%282007%29">The Great American Bash</a> against Nitro, who had changed his moniker to John Morrison by this point, but he was defeated again by Morrison at the event on July 22. The following week on "ECW," Punk challenged Elijah Burke and Tommy Dreamer in a <a href="Triple%20Threat%20match">triple threat match</a> to determine the next competitor in Morrison's <a href="The%20Dirt%20Sheet">15 Minutes of Fame Challenge</a> in which Punk came out victorious. A week later on "ECW", Punk defeated Morrison to earn an ECW Championship title match on August 26 at <a href="SummerSlam%20%282007%29">SummerSlam</a>, where he lost when Morrison used the ropes for leverage.

At the September 1 "ECW" taping, Punk defeated Morrison in a last chance title match to win the ECW Championship. In the following months, Punk went on to have successful title defenses against the likes of Elijah Burke, <a href="Viscera%20%28wrestler%29">Big Daddy V</a> via disqualification and <a href="The%20Miz">The Miz</a>. On November 6, Punk retained the ECW Championship in a match against Morrison following The Miz's interference. On November 18 at <a href="Survivor%20Series%20%282007%29">Survivor Series</a>, Punk retained the title in a triple threat match against The Miz and John Morrison. On January 22, 2008, Punk lost the ECW Championship to <a href="Chavo%20Guerrero%2C%20Jr.">Chavo Guerrero</a> in a no disqualification match after <a href="Edge%20%28wrestler%29">Edge</a> performed a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Spear">spear</a> on him, ending his reign at 143 days.

On March 30, 2008 at <a href="WrestleMania%20XXIV">WrestleMania XXIV</a>, Punk won the Money in the Bank ladder match after defeating <a href="Carly%20Col%C3%B3n">Carlito</a>, <a href="Chris%20Jericho">Chris Jericho</a>, John Morrison, <a href="Montel%20Vontavious%20Porter">Montel Vontavious Porter</a>, <a href="Ken%20Anderson%20%28wrestler%29">Mr. Kennedy</a> and <a href="Shelton%20Benjamin">Shelton Benjamin</a>.

On June 23, Punk was <a href="WWE%20draft">drafted</a> to the <a href="Raw%20%28WWE%20brand%29">Raw</a> brand during the <a href="2008%20WWE%20draft">2008 WWE draft</a>. In his first night on "Raw" the following week, Punk cashed in his Money in the Bank contract after <a href="Dave%20Bautista">Batista</a> beat down <a href="World%20Heavyweight%20Championship%20%28WWE%29">World Heavyweight Champion</a> Edge and won the title, making his first defense later that same night against <a href="John%20Layfield">John Bradshaw Layfield</a>, who had challenged him shortly after his win. Punk continued to hold and defend the title until <a href="Unforgiven%20%282008%29">Unforgiven</a>, when he was attacked by <a href="The%20Legacy%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">The Legacy</a> and Orton finished the assault by <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Punt">punting</a> Punk in the head before the <a href="Championship%20scramble">Championship Scramble</a> match on September 7, ending his reign at 69 days. Punk could not participate in the match due to the attack and so forfeited the title, being replaced by Chris Jericho, who won the match and the title. On the September 15 episode of "Raw", Punk received his title rematch, but he failed to regain the title in a steel cage match against Jericho.
On the October 27 episode of "Raw", Punk and <a href="Kofi%20Kingston">Kofi Kingston</a> defeated Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase to win the <a href="World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship%20%28WWE%29">World Tag Team Championship</a>. The duo were members of Team Batista at <a href="Survivor%20Series%20%282008%29">Survivor Series</a>, where their team lost to Team Orton on November 23. Punk then entered in a number one contender <a href="WWE%20Intercontinental%20Championship">Intercontinental Championship</a> tournament, defeating <a href="Gene%20Snitsky">Snitsky</a> and John Morrison in the first two rounds. Punk and Kingston lost the World Tag Team Championship to <a href="John%20Morrison%20and%20The%20Miz">John Morrison and The Miz</a> on December 13 at a live event. The next day at <a href="Armageddon%20%282008%29">Armageddon</a>, Punk defeated <a href="Rey%20Mysterio">Rey Mysterio</a> to win the tournament. On the January 5, 2009, episode of "Raw", Punk received his title match against <a href="William%20Regal">William Regal</a>, which ended in a <a href="Disqualification%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">disqualification</a> when Regal grabbed the referee's jersey. Due to this, <a href="Stephanie%20McMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a> awarded Punk a rematch the following week on "Raw", but this time it was himself that was disqualified. McMahon awarded him another rematch, a no disqualification match on the January 19 episode of "Raw", where Punk won the match and the title. With this win, Punk became the <a href="Triple%20Crown%20%28professional%20wrestling%29%23List%20of%20WWE%20Triple%20Crown%20Champions">19th WWE Triple Crown Champion</a> and the fastest to accomplish the feat, shattering <a href="Kevin%20Nash">Kevin Nash</a>'s old record at 203 days. Punk lost the title on the March 9 "Raw" to John Bradshaw Layfield. On April 5 at <a href="WrestleMania%20XXV">WrestleMania XXV</a>, Punk won the <a href="Money%20in%20the%20Bank%20ladder%20match">Money in the Bank ladder match</a> and became the first person to win the match twice. On April 13 during the <a href="2009%20WWE%20draft">2009 WWE draft</a>, Punk was drafted from Raw to <a href="SmackDown%20%28WWE%20brand%29">SmackDown</a>. In the period after the draft, Punk feuded with <a href="Umaga%20%28wrestler%29">Umaga</a> over Umaga's repeated surprise attacks while Punk was attempting to cash in his Money in the Bank contract, ultimately resulting in a <a href="Strap%20match">Samoan strap match</a> at <a href="Extreme%20Rules%20%282009%29">Extreme Rules</a>, which was won by Punk.

At the end of the event on June 7, Punk cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to defeat <a href="Jeff%20Hardy">Jeff Hardy</a> for the World Heavyweight Championship right after Hardy won the title from <a href="Edge%20%28wrestler%29">Edge</a> in a <a href="ladder%20match">ladder match</a>. Punk made his first successful title defense in a triple threat match against both Edge and Hardy on the June 15 episode of "Raw". On June 28 at <a href="WWE%20The%20Bash">The Bash</a>, Punk retained the title even though he lost to Hardy by disqualification after kicking the <a href="Referee%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">referee</a>. As part of the <a href="Kayfabe">storyline</a>, Punk injured his eye and said that he could not see the referee, but Hardy called his eye injury into question, believing it to be feigned, with Punk turning heel and claiming to be the moral superior of those who support Hardy due to his drug-free lifestyle. On July 26 at <a href="Night%20of%20Champions%20%282009%29">Night of Champions</a>, Punk lost the title to Hardy. Their feud continued through <a href="SummerSlam%20%282009%29">SummerSlam</a> on August 23, when Punk regained the title in a TLC match only to be attacked by <a href="The%20Undertaker">The Undertaker</a>.

On the August 28 episode of "SmackDown", Punk concluded his program with Hardy and achieved his <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20booker">booked</a> goal of excising him from WWE, defeating Hardy in a steel cage match wherein the <a href="Loser%20Leaves%20Town%20match">loser agreed to leave the company</a>. On September 13 at <a href="WWE%20Breaking%20Point">Breaking Point</a>, Punk defeated The Undertaker in a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Variations%20of%20singles%20matches">submission match</a> to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. Undertaker originally won the match with his "<a href="Gogoplata%23Use%20in%20professional%20wrestling">Hell's Gate</a>" submission hold, but <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20authority%20figures%23General%20Managers%202">SmackDown General Manager</a> <a href="Theodore%20Long">Theodore Long</a> restarted the match after stating that the ban that former SmackDown General Manager <a href="Vickie%20Guerrero">Vickie Guerrero</a> had placed on the move was still in effect and Punk won the match with his "<a href="Professional%20wrestling%20holds%23Anaconda%20vise">Anaconda Vise</a>" when referee <a href="Scott%20Armstrong%20%28wrestler%29">Scott Armstrong</a> called for the bell despite Undertaker never submitting. The feud between the two continued and on October 4 at <a href="Hell%20in%20a%20Cell%20%282009%29">Hell in a Cell</a> he lost the World Heavyweight Championship to The Undertaker in a <a href="Hell%20in%20a%20Cell">Hell in a Cell</a> match. Punk lost two subsequent rematches for the World Heavyweight Championship against The Undertaker on "SmackDown" and on October 25 at <a href="Bragging%20Rights%20%282009%29">Bragging Rights</a> in a fatal four-way match also involving Batista and <a href="Rey%20Mysterio">Rey Mysterio</a>.

His character took on a more sinister direction on the November 27 episode of "SmackDown" when Punk revealed that he had converted <a href="Luke%20Gallows">Luke Gallows</a>, who had previously been portrayed as the mentally incompetent wrestler Festus, to the straight-edge lifestyle which had rid him of his mental troubles. Continuing to espouse his straight-edge philosophy, Punk began to present himself as a cult-like <a href="salvation">savior</a> to the crowd, growing the hair on his head, face and chest in an allusion to <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus</a>. Through January 2010, Punk began to convert <a href="Plant%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">planted</a> members of the audience to a straight-edge lifestyle, making them take a pledge of allegiance to him and shaving their head as a sign of renewal and devotion. After converting many people who were not seen again, convert <a href="Serena%20Deeb">Serena</a> began accompanying Punk and Gallows to form <a href="The%20Straight%20Edge%20Society">The Straight Edge Society</a>. As well as leading this alliance, Punk was also the mentor of "<a href="WWE%20NXT">NXT</a>" rookie <a href="Darren%20Young">Darren Young</a> who flirted with the idea of becoming straight edge before refusing just before his head was to be shaved. On the December 14 episode of "Raw", Punk competed in a tournament to crown the <a href="Slammy%20Award%232009%20Slammy%20Awards">2009 Superstar of the Year</a>, but he lost to <a href="John%20Cena">John Cena</a> by <a href="Submission%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">submission</a> in the first round.

Punk continued to show messianic traits, frequently giving sermons including during the annual <a href="Royal%20Rumble%20%282010%29">Royal Rumble match</a> in January 2010 as well as during an <a href="Elimination%20Chamber%20%282010%29">Elimination Chamber</a> match in February 2010 at both of the eponymous pay-per-view events. In the Elimination Chamber match, Punk was eliminated by Rey Mysterio, whom he had feuding with leading into the event. Tensions escalated as Mysterio prevented him from winning a Money in the Bank qualifying match, causing Punk to interrupt Mysterio's celebration of his daughter's ninth birthday. Mysterio challenged Punk to a street fight at <a href="WrestleMania%20XXVI">WrestleMania XXVI</a>, but he lost to Gallows and Punk added the stipulation that if Rey lost against him at WrestleMania XXVI, he would join the Straight Edge Society. At the event on March 28, Punk lost to Mysterio, sparking a rematch on April 25 at <a href="Extreme%20Rules%20%282010%29">Extreme Rules</a> where Punk would have to shave his head like his disciples if he lost, but he won this match after interference from a fourth member of the Straight Edge Society who kept his face covered. On May 23 at <a href="Over%20the%20Limit%20%282010%29">Over The Limit</a>, a third and final match between Punk and Mysterio was booked with both stipulations reactivated, but he lost and was subsequently shaved bald.

Embarrassed by being shaved bald as he considered himself always pure unlike his followers, Punk began wearing a mask to hide his baldness. On June 20 at <a href="WWE%20Fatal%204-Way">Fatal 4-Way</a>, Punk challenged for the World Heavyweight Championship against Mysterio, <a href="Big%20Show">Big Show</a> and the champion <a href="Jack%20Swagger">Jack Swagger</a>, but he was unsuccessful when he was attacked by <a href="Kane%20%28wrestler%29">Kane</a>, who was accusing various people of attacking The Undertaker. On the July 16 episode of "SmackDown", Punk was finally unmasked by Big Show while healing from an arm injury. The following week on "SmackDown", Show also unmasked the anonymous member of The Straight Edge Society, who was revealed to be <a href="Joey%20Mercury">Joey Mercury</a>. This led to a <a href="Handicap%20match">four-on-one handicap</a> on August 15 at <a href="SummerSlam%20%282010%29">SummerSlam</a>, where Big Show defeated the entire Straight Edge Society after Punk abandoned his teammates. On September 19 at <a href="Night%20of%20Champions%20%282010%29">Night of Champions</a>, Punk lost to Big Show in a <a href="singles%20match">singles match</a>. Following this, Serena was released from WWE while Mercury became injured, severely thinning The Straight Edge Society as Gallows began showing signs of dissension too, but Punk defeated him on the "SmackDown" episode which aired on September 24, ending the group.

On October 11, Punk was traded back to the Raw brand after being swapped with Edge and took part in the interbrand tag team match on October 24 at <a href="Bragging%20Rights%20%282010%29">Bragging Rights</a> after injuring <a href="Evan%20Bourne">Evan Bourne</a> to win a place, but his team lost. It was reported later that he was suffering with a hip injury that would stop him from competing. To keep a presence on television, he began commentating on "Raw" from November 22.

At the end of December, Punk left the commentary team after assaulting John Cena on "Raw" and "SmackDown" with a chair. Punk later revealed that his motives for the attacks were that he had joined and assumed control of <a href="The%20Nexus%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">The Nexus</a>. Punk then made each member of the group prove themselves worthy of a spot, with some instead choosing to join <a href="The%20Corre">The Corre</a>, which had been started by former Nexus leader <a href="Wade%20Barrett">Wade Barrett</a> on SmackDown.

In January 2011, Punk and The Nexus cost Orton his match with <a href="The%20Miz">The Miz</a> for the WWE Championship at the <a href="Royal%20Rumble%20%282011%29">Royal Rumble</a> as a revenge for Orton prematurely ending Punk's first World Heavyweight Championship reign in 2008. In turn, Orton responded by taking out all of the New Nexus members by punting them in the head, leaving Punk alone as the sole surviving member of the group. This led to a <a href="WrestleMania%20XXVII">WrestleMania XXVII</a> match on April 3 and a <a href="Last%20Man%20Standing%20match">Last Man Standing match</a> on May 1 at <a href="Extreme%20Rules%20%282011%29">Extreme Rules</a>, both of which Punk lost.

In June 2011, after pinning WWE Champion John Cena on "Raw", <a href="Rey%20Mysterio">Rey Mysterio</a> at <a href="WWE%20Capitol%20Punishment">Capitol Punishment</a>, and finally <a href="Alberto%20Del%20Rio">Alberto Del Rio</a> again in a No. 1 contendership match all within one week, Punk revealed that his contract was to expire on July 17 at <a href="Money%20in%20the%20Bank%20%282011%29">Money in the Bank</a> and vowed to leave the company with the <a href="WWE%20Championship">WWE Championship</a>. After making a scathing yet highly acclaimed on-air <a href="shoot%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">speech</a> concerning the way in which WWE is run and its owner <a href="Vince%20McMahon">Vince McMahon</a>, Punk was given a storyline suspension from televised WWE events. Punk would be reinstated on Cena's insistence. Upon his return, Punk ceased to appear with the remaining members of The Nexus and the group quietly dissolved that month, turning Punk face. At Money in the Bank, Punk defeated Cena to become the WWE Champion on his final night under contract with WWE. The match received a five-star rating from Dave Meltzer, marking Punk's second performance to attain a five-star rating.

On July 21, Punk made a surprise appearance at a joint WWE–<a href="Mattel">Mattel</a> panel at <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic-Con">San Diego Comic-Con</a>, where he mocked new Chief Operating Officer <a href="Triple%20H">Triple H</a> and offered WWE Championship tournament finalist Rey Mysterio a match for the WWE Championship as long as it was in Punk's hometown in Chicago. Punk appeared at July 23's <a href="All%20American%20Wrestling">All American Wrestling</a> show, showing respect to <a href="Gregory%20Iron">Gregory Iron</a>, a wrestler with <a href="cerebral%20palsy">cerebral palsy</a>. Mysterio won the WWE Championship tournament on the July 25 episode of "Raw" only to lose it to Cena later that night, but after Cena's victory Punk returned and <a href="wikt%3Aupstage%23Verb">upstaged</a> the new WWE Champion's celebration while also entering into a title dispute. Triple H later upheld both Punk and Cena's claims to the WWE Championship as legitimate and scheduled the two to a match at <a href="SummerSlam%20%282011%29">SummerSlam</a> to decide the undisputed WWE Champion. At the event on August 14, Punk won, but he lost the title minutes later to Alberto Del Rio, who had cashed in his Money in the Bank contract after <a href="Kevin%20Nash">Kevin Nash</a> attacked Punk.

The night after SummerSlam, Punk accused Nash of conspiring with Triple H to keep Punk away from the WWE Championship. After repeated confrontations, Nash and Punk demanded to face each other at <a href="Night%20of%20Champions%20%282011%29">Night of Champions</a>, to which Triple H acquiesced, but after Punk's repeated verbal attacks towards him and his wife <a href="Stephanie%20McMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a>, Triple H booked himself to replace Nash. At the event on September 18, Punk lost a no disqualification match after Nash, <a href="The%20Miz">The Miz</a> and <a href="Ron%20Killings">R-Truth</a> attacked both men. Miz and Truth also attacked Punk on October 2 at <a href="Hell%20in%20a%20Cell%20%282011%29">Hell in a Cell</a> after he lost a WWE Championship triple threat Hell in a Cell match. Punk attempted to avenge this by teaming with Triple H against Miz and Truth on October 23 at <a href="Vengeance%20%282011%29">Vengeance</a>, but he lost again due to Nash attacking Triple H. This helped transition Punk's anti-establishment voice from Triple H to <a href="John%20Laurinaitis">John Laurinaitis</a>, who became the <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20authority%20figures%23General%20Managers">interim Raw General Manager</a>. Punk balked at Laurinaitis' promotion and verbally attacked him as a dull <a href="Sycophant">yes man</a>.
On the October 31 episode of "Raw", Punk strong-armed his way into a match with Del Rio at <a href="Survivor%20Series%20%282011%29">Survivor Series</a>, regaining the WWE Championship at the event on November 20. Punk went on to defend the title through the end of the year, retaining in a rematch with Del Rio on the November 28 episode of "Raw" and against both Del Rio and The Miz in a triple threat TLC match on December 18 at . On the December 26 episode of "Raw", Punk was defeated by <a href="Dolph%20Ziggler">Dolph Ziggler</a> in a <a href="gauntlet%20match">gauntlet match</a> and as a result Ziggler became the number one contender to the WWE Championship. The following week on "Raw", Punk was defeated by Ziggler by <a href="countout">countout</a> after Laurinaitis interfered, retaining the championship as a result. Intermeddling from Laurinaitis caused Punk to lose to Ziggler throughout January, which ultimately led to Punk attacking Laurinaitis in retaliation. At the <a href="Royal%20Rumble%20%282012%29">Royal Rumble</a> on January 29, 2012, Punk successfully defended his title against Ziggler despite Laurinaitis acting as the <a href="Referee%20%28professional%20wrestling%29%23Special%20outside%20referee">outside enforcer</a>.

On the January 30 episode of "Raw", the returning <a href="Chris%20Jericho">Chris Jericho</a> attacked Punk and <a href="Daniel%20Bryan">Daniel Bryan</a> during their <a href="Champion%20vs.%20Champion%20match">champion vs. champion match</a>, giving Bryan the win. The following week on "Raw", Jericho explained his actions by dismissing the WWE roster as imitations of himself and singling out Punk for calling himself "the best in the world", a moniker Jericho used the last time he was in WWE. Their rivalry continued through <a href="Elimination%20Chamber%20%282012%29">Elimination Chamber</a> on February 19, when Punk retained the WWE Championship in the namesake structure, but while four competitors were eliminated Jericho was unable to continue the match after being kicked out of the chamber by Punk, causing temporary injury. The next night on "Raw", Jericho earned a match against Punk on April 1 at <a href="WrestleMania%20XXVIII">WrestleMania XXVIII</a><ref name="Raw SuperShow 2/20/12 Results"></ref> and in a bid to psychologically unsettle him revealed Punk's father was an alcoholic and alleged that his sister was a drug addict, asserting that Punk's straight edge philosophy was paranoia to avoid the same vices and vowing to make Punk turn to alcohol by winning the title from him. John Laurinaitis added the stipulation that the WWE Championship could change hands via disqualification, which led to Jericho inciting Punk into using a weapon, but Punk resisted and retained the title. On the April 2 and 9 episodes of "Raw", Punk retained the WWE Championship against <a href="Mark%20Henry">Mark Henry</a> after losing to him via countout and disqualification, being attached by Jericho following both matches and doused with alcohol. On the April 16 episode of "Raw", Punk pinned Henry in a no disqualification, no countout match to retain the title. After repeated altercations, the feud between Jericho and Punk culminated in a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Hardcore-based%20variations">Chicago street fight</a> on April 29 at <a href="Extreme%20Rules%20%282012%29">Extreme Rules</a>, where Punk defeated Jericho to retain the WWE Championship.

On May 20 at <a href="Over%20the%20Limit%20%282012%29">Over the Limit</a>, Punk retaining the title against Daniel Bryan after reversing Bryan's submission hold the "<a href="Professional%20wrestling%20holds%23Crossface">"Yes!" Lock</a>" into a pinning combination as the pinfall saved Punk from his own submission only moments later. Shortly before Over the Limit, Bryan interfered in a non-title match between Punk and <a href="Kane%20%28wrestler%29">Kane</a> to frame Punk for attacking Kane with a steel chair, starting a three-way rivalry. On the June 1 episode of "SmackDown", a WWE Championship match between Punk and Kane ended in a double disqualification after Bryan attacked both men. Meanwhile, Bryan's jilted ex-girlfriend <a href="AJ%20Lee">AJ Lee</a> turned her affections to both Punk and Kane. This feud culminated in a triple threat match on June 17 at <a href="No%20Way%20Out%20%282012%29">No Way Out</a>, where Punk managed to retain the title after AJ distracted Kane. On July 15 at <a href="Money%20in%20the%20Bank%20%282012%29">Money in the Bank</a>, Punk defetead Bryan in a no disqualification match with AJ as special guest referee to retain the title.

On July 23 at "<a href="WWE%20Raw%201000">Raw 1000</a>", Punk defended the title against Money in the Bank winner John Cena and lost by disqualification after interference from <a href="Big%20Show">Big Show</a>. When the night's special guest <a href="Dwayne%20Johnson">The Rock</a>—who had interrupted Punk earlier to announce he would wrestle for the WWE Championship at the <a href="Royal%20Rumble%20%282013%29">Royal Rumble</a> in January 2013—intervened to save Cena from Big Show's assault, Punk attacked him, turning heel in the process. Punk justified his actions the following week on "Raw", explaining he was tired of people like Cena and Rock overshadowing him when the WWE Champion should be the focus of the company, asserting himself further soon after by disrupting a number one contender's match between Cena and Big Show. As a result, both men were entered into the title match against Punk on August 19 at <a href="SummerSlam%20%282012%29">SummerSlam</a>, where he successfully retained the title by pinning Big Show after both Punk and Cena submitted Big Show at the same time and Raw General Manager AJ Lee restarted the match. In the following weeks on "Raw", Punk demanded respect from people like AJ Lee, <a href="Jerry%20Lawler">Jerry Lawler</a> and <a href="Bret%20Hart">Bret Hart</a> and eventually aligned with <a href="Paul%20Heyman">Paul Heyman</a> in his feud with Cena. On September 16 at <a href="Night%20of%20Champions%20%282012%29">Night of Champions</a>, Punk retained the WWE Championship after he fought Cena to a <a href="Draw%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">draw</a>. Punk continued to feud with Cena despite the latter's arm injury, rejecting the requests of <a href="Mick%20Foley">Mick Foley</a> and <a href="Jim%20Ross">Jim Ross</a> to pick him as his <a href="Hell%20in%20a%20Cell%20%282012%29">Hell in a Cell</a> opponent and leading to a brawl with WWE Chairman <a href="Vince%20McMahon">Vince McMahon</a>. Cena was eventually pulled from the title match and replaced by <a href="Ryback%20%28wrestler%29">Ryback</a>, whom Punk would defeat at the event on October 28 in a Hell in a Cell match with help from referee <a href="Brad%20Maddox">Brad Maddox</a> to retain the title and also ending Ryback's thirty-eight match undefeated streak.
The next night on "Raw", a furious Mick Foley confronted Punk for refusing to pick John Cena as his Hell in a Cell opponent, leading the two to agree to meet at <a href="Survivor%20Series%20%282012%29">Survivor Series</a> in a <a href="Survivor%20Series%20Match">traditional five-on-five elimination tag team match</a> with Punk choosing Alberto Del Rio, <a href="Cody%20Rhodes">Cody Rhodes</a>, <a href="Damien%20Sandow">Damien Sandow</a> and The Miz for his own team. However, Punk was replaced as captain by Dolph Ziggler the following week on "Raw" and was instead booked in a triple threat WWE Championship match against John Cena and Ryback instead by Vince McMahon. At the event on November 18, Punk won the match by pinning Cena following interference from the debuting faction called <a href="The%20Shield%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">The Shield</a>, allowing him to retain the WWE Championship and hold the championship for a full year. On December 4, Punk underwent surgery to repair a partially torn <a href="Meniscus%20%28anatomy%29">meniscus</a>, removing him from his title match against Ryback on December 16 at . Despite his injury, Punk became the longest reigning WWE Champion in the past 25 years on December 5, when he hit 381 days, surpassing John Cena's 380-day reign. Punk returned to in-ring action on the January 7, 2013, episode of "Raw", retaining the WWE Championship against Ryback in a TLC match following interference from The Shield.
On January 27 at the Royal Rumble, Punk defended the WWE Championship against The Rock in a match stipulated that if The Shield interfered, Punk would be stripped of the title. Punk originally pinned The Rock to retain after The Shield put Rock through a table while the arena lights were out, leading Vince McMahon to come out and announce that Punk would be stripped of the title, but he instead restarted the match at The Rock's request which Punk lost, ending his reign at 434 days. WWE recognized this reign as the longest world championship reign in WWE of the "modern era" until <a href="WWE%20Universal%20Championship">Universal Champion</a> <a href="Brock%20Lesnar">Brock Lesnar</a> broke that record in June 2018. Punk received a title rematch with Rock on February 17 at <a href="Elimination%20Chamber%20%282013%29">Elimination Chamber</a>, stipulated that The Rock would lose the title if he was disqualified or counted out, but Punk was pinned by Rock after miscommunication with Heyman. On the February 25 episode of "Raw", Punk faced Royal Rumble winner John Cena for his number one contendership to the WWE Championship, but he lost.

In March 2013, Punk set his sights on ending <a href="The%20Streak%20%28wrestling%29">The Undertaker's undefeated WrestleMania streak</a> in an effort to "take something away from the fans" as he believed they had taken the WWE title away from him, defeating Big Show, Randy Orton and <a href="Sheamus">Sheamus</a> in a fatal four-way match to officially earn the right to face <a href="The%20Undertaker">The Undertaker</a>. After the death of <a href="Paul%20Bearer">Paul Bearer</a>, a storyline involving Punk regularly <a href="Spite%20%28sentiment%29">spiting</a> The Undertaker through displays of flippancy and disrespect towards Bearer's death began, including Punk stealing Bearer's trademark urn. On April 7 at <a href="WrestleMania%2029">WrestleMania 29</a>, Punk was defeated by The Undertaker, who took back the urn. On the April 15 episode of "Raw", Punk addressed the crowd and after briefly recalling his historic championship reign, walked out of the arena. After Chris Jericho pressured Heyman about Punk. challenging him to match at <a href="Payback%20%282013%29">Payback</a> on who between the two of them was the "best in the world", Punk made his return by defeating Jericho at the event on June 16. The next night on "Raw", Punk told Heyman to no longer accompany him to his matches and was later attacked by Heyman's client <a href="Brock%20Lesnar">Brock Lesnar</a>, thus turning Punk face again. Afterward, Heyman promised Punk that he did not send Lesnar to attack him and that he still considered Punk his best friend, stating that any problem Punk and Lesnar had with each other was between them. On July 14 at <a href="Money%20in%20the%20Bank%20%282013%29">Money in the Bank</a>, Punk lost the WWE Championship Money in the Bank ladder match after Heyman turned on him and attacked him. The next night on "Raw", Heyman claimed that without him, Punk was no longer the "Best in the World" before unleashing Lesnar on Punk. Punk and Lesnar brawled for several weeks until <a href="SummerSlam%20%282013%29">SummerSlam</a> on August 18, when Punk lost to Lesnar in a No Disqualification match after Heyman interfered.
Punk then turned his sights to Heyman's other client, Intercontinental Champion <a href="Curtis%20Axel">Curtis Axel</a>. On September 15 at <a href="Night%20of%20Champions%20%282013%29">Night of Champions</a>, Punk faced Axel and Heyman in a no disqualification two-on-one handicap elimination match in which he made Axel submit, leaving only Heyman left, but he lost the match after <a href="Ryback">Ryback</a> interfered and put him through a table. On October 6 at <a href="Battleground%20%282013%29">Battleground</a>, Punk defeated Ryback after executing a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Low%20blow">low blow</a> while the referee was distracted by Heyman attempting to interfere in the match. On the October 14 episode of "Raw", Punk defeated Axel in a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Beat%20the%20Clock%20challenge%20match">Beat the Clock challenge match</a> to determine the stipulation for his rematch with Ryback at <a href="Hell%20in%20a%20Cell%20%282013%29">Hell in a Cell</a>, which Punk chose to be a two-on-one handicap match in the Hell in a Cell also involving Heyman. At the event on October 27, Punk defeated Heyman and Ryback by pinning the latter and after the match performing a "Go to Sleep" on Heyman at the top of the cell to exact his revenge, ending their storyline.

Punk moved on to a feud with <a href="The%20Wyatt%20Family">The Wyatt Family</a> and formed an alliance with <a href="Daniel%20Bryan">Daniel Bryan</a>, with the duo defeating Harper and Rowan in a tag team match on November 24 at <a href="Survivor%20Series%20%282013%29">Survivor Series</a>. The next night on "Raw", Punk was attacked by The Shield while attempting to save Bryan from being "taken hostage" by The Wyatt Family. Punk then insinuated that <a href="The%20Authority%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">The Authority</a> ordered the attack, which resulted in the Director of Operations <a href="Kane%20%28wrestler%29">Kane</a> booking Punk in a three-on-one handicap match against The Shield at . At the event on December 15, Punk won the match after Reigns accidentally performed a spear on Ambrose. After further altercations between Punk and Kane, Kane made Punk the first entrant in the annual <a href="Royal%20Rumble%20%282014%29">Royal Rumble</a> <a href="Royal%20Rumble%20match">match</a> on January 26, 2014. Near the end of match, Kane, who was already eliminated earlier in the match by Punk, eliminated Punk from the outside and proceeded to perform on him a <a href="chokeslam">chokeslam</a> through the announce table.

Punk did not appear on the January 27 episode of "Raw", nor did he appear at the "SmackDown" taping on Tuesday despite being advertised for the event. By Wednesday, WWE.com stopped advertising Punk for future events. "The Wrestling Observer" reported that on Monday and prior to "Raw" he had <a href="Legit%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">legitimately</a> walked out after telling <a href="Vince%20McMahon">Vince McMahon</a> and <a href="Triple%20H">Triple H</a> that he was "going home". On February 20 during a <a href="conference%20call">conference call</a> to investors, McMahon said Punk was "taking a <a href="sabbatical">sabbatical</a>". On the March 3 episode of "Raw", WWE acknowledged Punk's absence on television when the show started with Punk's entrance music playing, only for former manager <a href="Paul%20Heyman">Paul Heyman</a> to walk out. WWE proceeded to remove Punk from footage of their promotional videos. This lasted until the first half of July, where WWE used footage of Punk to promote the <a href="WWE%20Network">WWE Network</a>. In an interview published in late May, Punk was asked how it felt "to be retired at 35" and replied that "it feels good". On July 15, WWE.com moved Punk from the active roster to the alumni page without releasing a statement. On the same day, Punk thanked his fans without mentioning WWE. In late July, Punk said that he was "never ever" going to return to wrestling.
On an episode of <a href="Colt%20Cabana">Colt Cabana</a>'s "Art of Wrestling" <a href="podcast">podcast</a> released in November 2014, Punk broke his silence regarding his exit from WWE. In a detailed interview, Punk said that he was suspended for two months after walking out on the company in January and that after the suspension ended, nobody from WWE contacted him. Punk also told that when he reached out to them for unpaid royalties, he was given a run-around by company executives until he was handed his termination papers and was fired by WWE on his wedding day in June 2014. The manner of firing was the last straw for Punk, stating that he would never return to WWE and that following a legal settlement with WWE there would be no further working relationship between them. The settlement included Punk giving WWE permission to sell his remaining merchandise.

Punk cited his health as the main reason he left WWE, describing that in his final months in the company he had been working through an untreated and potentially fatal <a href="methicillin-resistant%20Staphylococcus%20aureus">MRSA</a> infection, broken ribs, injured knees and multiple concussions, including one at the 2014 Royal Rumble, as well as having lost his appetite and ability to sleep well. Punk felt that WWE was pressuring and rushing him to wrestle before he had fully recovered. According to Punk, he found a lump on his back in November 2013 and it was diagnosed as a fatty deposit by Dr. Chris Amann, who refused to remove it despite Punk's requests. The week after Punk left WWE, his wife <a href="AJ%20Lee">April Mendez</a> convinced him to get the lump checked by her doctor. The doctor diagnosed it as a MRSA infection and told Punk that he could have died due to ignoring it for such a long time. Punk had the doctor evacuate the infection, describing it as the worst pain in his life, but said that once it was treated and he was on stronger medication, he was able to sleep better than he had in months.

Other sources of unhappiness Punk had with WWE were his failure to main event a WrestleMania, being paid less than the other wrestlers in the three biggest matches of WrestleMania 29, doing favors for Vince McMahon and not being owed back, being "creatively stifled" and feeling that there were no long-term plans for wrestlers other than <a href="John%20Cena">John Cena</a> as well as receiving less pay and not getting answers as to how the advent of the <a href="WWE%20Network">WWE Network</a> would affect wrestlers' salaries. Lastly, Punk described having left with "zero passion" for wrestling and described himself at the time of the interview to be the happiest in many years.

Less than a week later when Vince McMahon was interviewed on "<a href="Stone%20Cold%20Steve%20Austin%23Other%20media">The Steve Austin Show</a>" via the WWE Network, McMahon apologized to Punk for the manner of his termination, which he regarded as a coincidence due to a lack of communication within the organization. McMahon said that he was open to working with Punk again. In a second "Art of Wrestling" podcast, Punk rejected McMahon's apology as insincere and a "publicity stunt" as McMahon did not contact him directly to apologize and could have apologized earlier.

Punk adopted his real-life following of the <a href="straight%20edge">straight edge</a> movement as a major attribute of his professional wrestling character. The character utilizes different elements of Punk's personality and beliefs of the straight edge movement dependent on his alignment. While portraying a crowd favorite, Punk's character tends to be that of Punk's normal personality, largely indifferent to others who drink <a href="Alcoholic%20beverage">alcohol</a>, <a href="smoking">smoke</a> tobacco, partake in <a href="recreational%20drug%20use">recreational drug use</a> or have <a href="Promiscuity">promiscuous</a> <a href="Human%20sexual%20activity">sexual behavior</a>, but emphasizing the social discipline involved with personally <a href="Abstinence">abstaining</a> from these behaviors. Conversely, his villainous personality tends to be that of one who is <a href="Hardline%20%28subculture%29">hardline</a> or <a href="Straight%20edge%231990s">militant straight edge</a>, exemplifying the elitist attitudes and superiority complexes—defined by Punk's common mantra during villainous-themed <a href="Promos%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">promos</a> that, because he is straight edge, he is "better than you". Punk performs the straight edge symbol of crossing his arms in an X formation while having the letter X written on the back of his hands, usually drawn on his wrist tape. During his WWE career, Punk also incorporated a belligerently <a href="anti-establishment">anti-establishment</a> and <a href="Anti-corporate%20activism">anti-corporate</a> attitude into his persona.
Originally, the initials CM in his ring name represented the phrase "Chick Magnet", the name of the tag team he was in as a <a href="Backyard%20wrestling">backyard wrestler</a>. However, Punk later changed CM into a <a href="pseudo-acronym">pseudo-acronym</a>, declaring that it has no meaning, though when asked since he has taken to making up meanings that fit the initials, going so far as to make up long stories to explain the origins that do not match the actual origin story at all. Since beginning this practice, Punk has stated CM stands among others for "<a href="Cookie%20Monster">Cookie Monster</a>", "Cookie Master", "<a href="%23Professional%20wrestling%20highlights">Crooked Moonsault</a>", "<a href="Chuck%20Mosley">Chuck Mosley</a>", "<a href="Mr.%20Burns">Charles Montgomery</a>", "<a href="Charles%20Manson">Charles Manson</a>" and "Chicago Made".

During his entrance, Punk yells "It's clobberin' time!", a reference to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> <a href="hardcore%20punk">hardcore punk</a> band <a href="Sick%20of%20It%20All">Sick of It All</a> who wrote a song with the same name and <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel's</a> <a href="fictional%20character">fictional character</a> <a href="Thing%20%28comics%29">The Thing</a>.

An integral part of Punk are the numerous <a href="tattoo">tattoo</a>s that adorn his body, some of which have become symbols associated with Punk as well as <a href="mantra">mantra</a>s and declarations that have been integrated into his gimmick. The tattoos as a whole, due to their large quantity and variety, have also become an attribute identifiable to Punk. The most important of the individual tattoos in Punk's character—whether through association, symbol, or mantra—are the following:

At <a href="UFC%20181">UFC 181</a>, on December 6, 2014, Punk announced that he had signed a multi-fight contract with <a href="Ultimate%20Fighting%20Championship">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a> (UFC). When asked if he would compete under his ring name or birth name, he told the "<a href="Las%20Vegas%20Sun">Las Vegas Sun</a>": "I've come this far with CM Punk. That's what people know. I'm trying to stick with that. I'm not shying away from it. I'm not ashamed of it". His UFC profile lists him as CM Punk.

In January 2015, Punk began training under <a href="Duke%20Roufus">Duke Roufus</a> at Roufusport MMA Academy. In June 2015, Punk moved to Milwaukee to be closer to the Roufusport gym while still retaining his home in Chicago. Later, it was announced that Punk would compete in the welterweight division. In October 2015, Roufus announced that Punk had suffered a shoulder injury, delaying his UFC debut until the next calendar year. On February 6, 2016, it was announced that Punk would face <a href="Mickey%20Gall">Mickey Gall</a> in his first professional mixed martial arts (MMA) contest, but he was diagnosed with a <a href="herniated%20disc">herniated disc</a> and underwent surgery days later.

Punk's UFC and MMA debut against Gall took place on September 10 at <a href="UFC%20203">UFC 203</a>. The event was held at the <a href="Quicken%20Loans%20Arena">Quicken Loans Arena</a>, the same venue where Punk left WWE and retired from professional wrestling. He lost via <a href="rear%20naked%20choke">rear naked choke</a> at 2:14 of the first round. He was paid a disclosed $500,000.

Punk's second professional bout took place at <a href="UFC%20225">UFC 225</a> on June 9, 2018, in his hometown of Chicago, where he lost to Mike Jackson via unanimous decision. After the bout, UFC president <a href="Dana%20White">Dana White</a> said that Punk would probably not fight for the UFC again.

On November 8, 2018, it was announced that Punk had signed with the <a href="Cage%20Fury%20Fighting%20Championships">Cage Fury Fighting Championships</a> (CFFC) promotion (a UFC affiliate) as a commentator. His first event was CFFC 71 on December 14 and it was streamed live on <a href="UFC%20Fight%20Pass">UFC Fight Pass</a>.

House of Plantagenet

The House of Plantagenet () was a <a href="Dynasty">royal house</a> which originated from the lands of <a href="Anjou">Anjou</a> in France. The name Plantagenet is used by modern historians to identify four distinct royal houses: the <a href="Angevin%20kings%20of%20England">Angevins</a>, who were also <a href="counts%20of%20Anjou">counts of Anjou</a>; the main body of the Plantagenets following the loss of Anjou; and the Plantagenets' two <a href="cadet%20branch">cadet branch</a>es, the houses of <a href="House%20of%20Lancaster">Lancaster</a> and <a href="House%20of%20York">York</a>. The family held the <a href="English%20throne">English throne</a> from 1154, with the accession of <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a>, until 1485, when <a href="Richard%20III">Richard III</a> died in battle.

Under the Plantagenets, England was transformed – although this was only partly intentional. The Plantagenet kings were often forced to negotiate compromises such as <a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a>. These constrained royal power in return for financial and military support. The king was no longer just the most powerful man in the nation, holding the prerogative of judgement, feudal tribute and warfare. He now had defined duties to the realm, underpinned by a sophisticated justice system. A distinct national identity was shaped by conflict with the French, Scots, Welsh and Irish, and the establishment of English as the primary language.

In the 15th century, the Plantagenets were defeated in the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a> and beset with social, political and economic problems. Popular revolts were commonplace, triggered by the denial of numerous freedoms. English nobles raised private armies, engaged in private feuds and openly defied <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">Henry VI</a>.

The rivalry between the House of Plantagenet's two cadet branches of York and Lancaster brought about the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>, a decades-long fight for the English succession, culminating in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bosworth%20Field">Battle of Bosworth Field</a> in 1485, when the reign of the Plantagenets and the <a href="England%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">English Middle Ages</a> both met their end with the death of King Richard III. <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII</a>, of Lancastrian descent, became king of England; five months later, he married <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20York">Elizabeth of York</a>, thus ending the Wars of the Roses, and giving rise to the <a href="House%20of%20Tudor">Tudor dynasty</a>. The Tudors worked to centralise English royal power, which allowed them to avoid some of the problems that had plagued the last Plantagenet rulers. The resulting stability allowed for the <a href="English%20Renaissance">English Renaissance</a>, and the advent of <a href="early%20modern%20Britain">early modern Britain</a>.

<a href="Richard%20of%20York%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20York">Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York</a>, adopted Plantagenet as his family name in the 15th century. "Plantegenest" (or "Plante Genest") had been a 12th-century nickname for his ancestor <a href="Geoffrey%20Plantagenet%2C%20Count%20of%20Anjou">Geoffrey</a>, <a href="Count%20of%20Anjou">Count of Anjou</a> and <a href="Duke%20of%20Normandy">Duke of Normandy</a>. One of many popular theories suggests the <a href="Cytisus%20scoparius">common broom</a>, in <a href="medieval%20Latin">medieval Latin</a>, as the source of the nickname. It is uncertain why Richard chose this specific name, although during the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a> it emphasised Richard's status as Geoffrey's patrilineal descendant. The retrospective usage of the name for all of Geoffrey's male-line descendants was popular during the subsequent <a href="Tudor%20dynasty">Tudor dynasty</a>, perhaps encouraged by the further legitimacy it gave to Richard's great-grandson, <a href="Henry%20VIII">Henry VIII</a>. It was only in the late 17th century that it passed into common usage among historians.

 is French for "from <a href="Anjou">Anjou</a>". The three Angevin kings were <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a>, <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I</a> and <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">John</a>. "Angevin" can also refer to the period of history in which they reigned. Many historians identify the Angevins as a distinct English royal house. "Angevin" is also used in reference to any sovereign or government derived from Anjou. As a noun, it refers to any native of Anjou or an Angevin ruler, and specifically to other <a href="counts%20and%20dukes%20of%20Anjou">counts and dukes of Anjou</a>, including the ancestors of the three kings who formed the English royal house; their cousins, who held the crown of <a href="King%20of%20Jerusalem%23House%20of%20Anjou">Jerusalem</a>; and to unrelated members of the French royal family who were later granted the titles and formed different dynasties, such as the <a href="Capetian%20House%20of%20Anjou">Capetian House of Anjou</a> and the <a href="House%20of%20Valois-Anjou">Valois House of Anjou</a>. Consequently, there is disagreement between those who consider <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a> to be the first Plantagenet monarch, and those who do not distinguish between Angevins and Plantagenets and therefore consider the first Plantagenet to be Henry II.

The term "Angevin Empire" was coined by <a href="Kate%20Norgate">Kate Norgate</a> in 1887. There was no known contemporary collective name for all of the territories under the rule of the Angevin Kings of England. This led to circumlocutions such as "our kingdom and everything subject to our rule whatever it may be" or "the whole of the kingdom which had belonged to his father". The "Empire" portion of "Angevin Empire" has been controversial, especially as these territories were not subject to any unified laws or systems of governance, and each retained its own laws, traditions, and feudal relationships. In 1986 a convention of historians concluded that there had not been an Angevin state, and therefore no "<a href="Angevin%20Empire">Angevin Empire</a>", but that the term (French for "Plantagenet area") was acceptable. Nonetheless, historians have continued to use "Angevin Empire".

The later <a href="counts%20of%20Anjou">counts of Anjou</a>, including the Plantagenets, descended from <a href="Geoffrey%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20G%C3%A2tinais">Geoffrey II, Count of Gâtinais</a>, and his wife <a href="Ermengarde%20of%20Anjou%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Burgundy">Ermengarde of Anjou</a>. In 1060 the couple inherited the title via <a href="cognatic%20kinship">cognatic kinship</a> from <a href="House%20of%20Ingelger">an Angevin family</a> that was descended from a noble named <a href="Ingelger">Ingelger</a>, whose recorded history dates from 870.

During the 10th and 11th centuries, power struggles occurred between rulers in northern and western France including those of Anjou, <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>, <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>, <a href="Poitou">Poitou</a>, <a href="Blois">Blois</a>, <a href="Maine%20%28province%29">Maine</a>, and the kings of France. In the early 12th century Geoffrey of Anjou married <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Empress Matilda</a>, <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">King Henry I</a>'s only surviving legitimate child and heir to the English throne. As a result of this marriage, Geoffrey's son <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a> inherited the English throne as well as Norman and Angevin titles, thus marking the beginning of the Angevin and Plantagenet dynasties.

The marriage was the third attempt of Geoffrey's father, <a href="Fulk%20V%2C%20Count%20of%20Anjou">Fulk V, Count of Anjou</a>, to build a political alliance with Normandy. He first espoused his daughter, <a href="Matilda%20of%20Anjou">Alice</a>, to <a href="William%20Adelin">William Adelin</a>, Henry I's heir. After William drowned in the wreck of the "<a href="White%20Ship">White Ship</a>" Fulk married another of his daughters, <a href="Sibylla%20of%20Anjou">Sibylla</a>, to <a href="William%20Clito">William Clito</a>, son of Henry I's older brother, <a href="Robert%20Curthose">Robert Curthose</a>. Henry I had the marriage annulled to avoid strengthening William's rival claim to Normandy. Finally Fulk achieved his goal through the marriage of Geoffrey and Matilda. Fulk then passed his titles to Geoffrey and became <a href="King%20of%20Jerusalem">King of Jerusalem</a>.

When Henry II was born in 1133, his grandfather, Henry I, was reportedly delighted, saying that the boy was "the heir to the kingdom". The birth reduced the risk that the king's realm would pass to his son-in-law's family, which might have occurred if the marriage of Matilda and Geoffrey had proved childless. The birth of a second son, also named <a href="Geoffrey%2C%20Count%20of%20Nantes">Geoffrey</a>, increased the likelihood that, in accordance with French custom, Henry would receive the English maternal inheritance and Geoffrey the Angevin paternal inheritance. This would separate the realms of England and Anjou. In order to secure an orderly succession, Geoffrey and Matilda sought more power from Henry I, but quarrelled with him after the king refused to give them power that might be used against him. When he died in December 1135, the couple were in Anjou, allowing Matilda's cousin <a href="Stephen%2C%20King%20of%20England">Stephen</a> to seize the crown of England. Stephen's contested accession initiated the widespread civil unrest later called the Anarchy.

Count Geoffrey had little interest in England. Instead he commenced a ten-year war for the duchy of Normandy, but it became clear that to bring this conflict to a successful conclusion Stephen would need to be challenged in England so in 1139 Matilda and her half-brother, <a href="Robert%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Robert</a> invaded England. From the age of nine, Henry was repeatedly sent to England to be the male figurehead of the campaigns, since it became apparent that he would become king if England was conquered. In 1141 Stephen was captured at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lincoln%20%281141%29">Battle of Lincoln</a> and later exchanged for Robert who had also been captured. Geoffrey continued the conquest of Normandy and in 1150 transferred the duchy to Henry while retaining the primary role in the duchy's government.

Three events allowed the Angevins' successful termination of the conflict:

Of Henry's siblings, <a href="William%20FitzEmpress">William</a> and Geoffrey died unmarried and childless, but the tempestuous marriage of Henry and Eleanor, who already had two daughters (<a href="Marie%20of%20France%2C%20Countess%20of%20Champagne">Marie</a> and <a href="Alix%20of%20France">Alix</a>) through her first marriage to King Louis, produced eight children in thirteen years:
Henry also had illegitimate children with several mistresses, possibly as many as twelve. These children included <a href="Geoffrey%20%28archbishop%20of%20York%29">Geoffrey</a>, <a href="William%20Longesp%C3%A9e%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">William</a>, Peter and four children who died young by <a href="Alys%20of%20France%2C%20Countess%20of%20Vexin">Alys</a>, the daughter of Louis VII, while she was betrothed to his son Richard. William's many competencies and importance as a royal bastard led to a long and illustrious career.

Henry reasserted and extended previous suzerainties to secure possession of his inherited realm. In 1162 he attempted to re-establish what he saw as his authority over the English Church by appointing his friend <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a> as <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> upon the death of the incumbent archbishop, <a href="Theobald%20of%20Bec">Theobald</a>. Becket's defiance as Archbishop alienated the king and his counsellors. Henry and Becket had repeated disputes over issues such as church tenures, the marriage of Henry's brother, and taxation. Henry reacted by getting Becket and other English bishops to recognise sixteen ancient customs in writing for the first time in the <a href="Constitutions%20of%20Clarendon">Constitutions of Clarendon</a>, governing relations between the king, his courts and the church. When Becket tried to leave the country without permission, Henry tried to ruin him by filing legal cases relating to Becket's previous tenure as chancellor. Becket fled and remained in exile for five years. Relations later improved, and Becket returned, but they declined again when Henry's son was crowned as <a href="coregent">coregent</a> by the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, which Becket perceived as a challenge to his authority. Becket later excommunicated those who had offended him. When he received this news, Henry said: "What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk." Four of Henry's knights killed Becket in <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a> after Becket resisted a failed arrest attempt. Henry was widely considered complicit in Becket's death throughout Christian Europe. This made Henry a pariah; in penance, he walked barefoot into Canterbury Cathedral, where he was severely whipped by monks.

From 1155 Henry claimed that <a href="Pope%20Adrian%20IV">Pope Adrian IV</a> had given him authorisation to reform the Irish church by assuming control of Ireland, but Professor Anne Duggan's research indicates that the <a href="Laudabiliter">Laudabiliter</a> is a falsification of an existing letter and that was not in fact Adrian's intention. It originally allowed Henry's brother William some territory. Henry did not personally act on this until 1171 by which time William was already dead. He invaded Ireland to assert his authority over knights who had accrued autonomous power after they recruited soldiers in England and Wales and colonised Ireland with his permission. Henry later gave Ireland to his youngest son, John. In 1172 Henry gave John the castles of <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Chinon">Chinon</a>, <a href="Loudun">Loudun</a> and <a href="Mirebeau">Mirebeau</a> as a wedding gift. This angered Henry's eighteen-year-old son, <a href="Henry%20the%20Young%20King">Henry the Young King</a>, who believed these were his. A <a href="Revolt%20of%201173%E2%80%931174">rebellion</a> by Henry II's wife and three eldest sons ensued. <a href="Louis%20VII%20of%20France">Louis VII of France</a> supported the rebellion. <a href="William%20the%20Lion">William the Lion</a>, king of the Scots, and others joined the revolt. After eighteen months, Henry subdued the rebels. In <a href="Le%20Mans">Le Mans</a> in 1182, Henry II gathered his children to plan a <a href="partible%20inheritance">partible inheritance</a>: his eldest surviving son, Henry, would inherit England, Normandy and Anjou; Richard (his mother's favourite) would inherit the Duchy of Aquitaine; <a href="Geoffrey%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany">Geoffrey</a> would inherit Brittany; and John would inherit Ireland. This resulted in further conflict. The younger Henry rebelled again, but died of <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>. Geoffrey died in 1186 after an accident in a tournament. In 1189, Richard and <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20France">Philip II of France</a> reasserted their various claims exploiting the aging Henry's failing health. Henry was forced to accept humiliating peace terms, including naming Richard his sole heir. The old King died two days later, defeated and miserable. French and English contemporary moralists viewed this fate as retribution for the murder of Becket; even his favourite legitimate son, John, had rebelled although the constantly loyal illegitimate son Geoffrey remained with Henry until the end.

Following Richard's coronation he quickly put the kingdom's affairs in order and departed on a Crusade for the Middle East. Opinion of Richard has fluctuated. Although he was respected for his military leadership and courtly manners, he had rejected and humiliated the sister of the king of France, deposed the king of Cyprus and later sold the island, he made enemies on the <a href="Third%20Crusade">Third Crusade</a> such as <a href="Leopold%20V%2C%20Duke%20of%20Austria">Leopold V, Duke of Austria</a> by showing disrespect to his banners as well as refusing to share the spoils of war, and was rumoured to have arranged the assassination of <a href="Conrad%20of%20Montferrat">Conrad of Montferrat</a>. His ruthlessness was demonstrated by his <a href="Massacre%20at%20Ayyadieh">massacre of 2,600 prisoners in Acre</a>. He obtained victories during the Third Crusade, but failed to capture <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. According to <a href="Steven%20Runciman">Steven Runciman</a> Richard was "a bad son, a bad husband and a bad king". <a href="Jonathan%20Riley-Smith">Jonathan Riley-Smith</a> described him as "vain ... devious and self-centred". In an alternate view <a href="John%20Gillingham">John Gillingham</a> points out that for centuries Richard was considered a model king.

Returning from the crusade with a small band of followers, Richard was captured by Leopold and was passed to <a href="Henry%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Henry VI</a>. Henry held Richard captive for eighteen months (1192–1194) while his mother raised the ransom, valued at 100,000 <a href="Mark%20%28currency%29%23England%20and%20Scotland">marks</a>. In Richard's absence, Philip II overran large portions of Normandy and John acquired control of Richard's English lands. After returning to England, Richard forgave John and re-established his authority in England. He left again in 1194 and battled Philip for five years, attempting to regain the lands seized during his captivity. When close to complete victory, he was injured by an arrow during a siege and died ten days later.

Richard's failure to provide an heir caused a succession crisis and conflict between supporters of the claim of his nephew, <a href="Arthur%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany">Arthur</a>, and John. <a href="Guillaume%20des%20Roches">Guillaume des Roches</a> led the magnates of Anjou, Maine, and Touraine declaring for Arthur. Once again Philip II of France attempted to disturb the Plantagenet territories on the European mainland by supporting his vassal Arthur's claim to the English crown. John won a significant victory while preventing Arthur's forces from capturing his mother, seizing the entire rebel leadership at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mirebeau">Battle of Mirebeau</a> and his sister <a href="Eleanor%2C%20Fair%20Maid%20of%20Brittany">Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany</a>. Foolishly John disregarded his allies' opinions on the fate of the prisoners, many of them their neighbours and kinsmen. Instead he kept his prisoners so vilely and in such evil distress that it seemed shameful and ugly to all those who were with him and who saw this cruelty' according to the <a href="L%27Histoire%20de%20Guillaume%20le%20Marechal">L'Histoire de Guillaume le Marechal</a>. As a result of John's behaviour the powerful Thouars, Lusignan, and des Roches families rebelled and John lost control of Anjou, Maine, Touraine, and northern Poitou. His son, King Henry III, maintained the claim to the Angevin territories until December 1259 when he formally surrendered them and in return was granted Gascony as duke of Aquitaine and a vassal of the king of France. John's reputation was further damaged by the rumour, described in the <a href="Margam%20Abbey">Margam annals</a>, that while drunk he himself had murdered Arthur and if not true it is almost certain John ordered the killing. There are two contrasting schools of thought explaining the sudden collapse of John's position. <a href="J.%20C.%20Holt">Sir James Holt</a> suggests this was the inevitable result of superior French resources. <a href="John%20Gillingham">John Gillingham</a> identifies diplomatic and military mismanagement and points out that Richard managed to hold the Angevin territory with comparable finances. Nick Barratt has calculated that Angevin resources available for use in the war were 22 per cent less than those of Phillip, putting the Angevins at a disadvantage.

By 1214 John had re-established his authority in England and planned what Gillingham has called a grand strategy to recapture Normandy and Anjou. The plan was that John would draw the French from <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, while another army, under his nephew <a href="Otto%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Otto IV</a>, the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, and his half-brother William attacked from the north. He also brought his niece Eleanor of Brittany, aiming to establish her as Duchess of Brittany. The plan failed when John's allies were defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bouvines">Battle of Bouvines</a>. Otto retreated and was soon overthrown, William was captured by the French and John agreed to a five-year truce. (From then on John also gave up the claim to Brittany of Eleanor and had her confined for life.) John's defeat weakened his authority in England, and his barons forced him to agree to the <a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a>, which limited royal power. Both sides failed to abide by the terms of the Magna Carta, leading to the <a href="First%20Barons%27%20War">First Barons' War</a>, in which rebellious barons invited <a href="Louis%20VIII%20of%20France">Prince Louis</a>, the husband of <a href="Blanche%20of%20Castile">Blanche</a>, Henry II's granddaughter, to invade England. Louis did so but in October 1216, before the conflict was conclusively ended, John died. The official website of the British Monarchy presents John's death as the end of the Angevin dynasty and the beginning of the Plantagenet dynasty.

All subsequent English monarchs were descendants of the Angevin line via John, who had five legitimate children with <a href="Isabella%20of%20Angoul%C3%AAme">Isabella</a>:

John also had illegitimate children with several mistresses. These children probably included nine sons called <a href="Richard%20FitzRoy">Richard</a>, Oliver, Henry, Osbert Gifford, Geoffrey, John FitzJohn or Courcy, Odo or Eudes FitzRoy, Ivo, Henry, Richard the constable of <a href="Wallingford%20Castle">Wallingford Castle</a> and three daughters called <a href="Joan%2C%20Lady%20of%20Wales">Joan</a>, Matilda the abbess of Barking and Isabella la Blanche. Joan was the best known of these, since she married Prince <a href="Llewelyn%20the%20Great">Llewelyn the Great</a> of Wales.

<a href="William%20Marshal%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke</a>, was appointed regent for the nine-year-old King Henry on King John's death. Thereafter, support for Louis declined, and he renounced his claims in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Lambeth">Treaty of Lambeth</a> after Marshal's victories at the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Lincoln%20%281217%29">Lincoln</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Sandwich%20%281217%29">Sandwich</a> in 1217. The Marshal regime issued an amended Magna Carta as a basis for future government. Despite the Treaty of Lambeth, hostilities continued and Henry was forced to compromise with the newly crowned Louis VIII of France and Henry's stepfather, <a href="Hugh%20X%20of%20Lusignan">Hugh X of Lusignan</a>. They both overran much of Henry's remaining continental lands, further eroding the Angevins' power on the continent. In his political struggles, Henry perceived many similarities between himself and England's patron saint, <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>. Consequently, he named his first son Edward and built the existing magnificent shrine for the Confessor.

In early 1225 a great council approved a tax of £40,000 to dispatch an army, which quickly retook Gascony. During an assembly feudal prerogatives of the king were challenged by the barons, bishops and magnates who demanded that the king reissue the "Magna Carta" and the Charter of the Forest in exchange for support. Henry declared that the charters were issued of his own "spontaneous and free will" and confirmed them with the royal seal, giving the new <a href="Magna%20Carta%23The%20Great%20Charter%201225">Great Charter</a> and the Charter of the Forest of 1225 much more authority than any previous versions.

Henry III had nine children:


Henry was bankrupted by his military expenditure and general extravagance. The pope offered Henry's brother <a href="Richard%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Cornwall">Richard</a> the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sicily">Kingdom of Sicily</a>, but the military cost of displacing the incumbent <a href="Frederick%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Frederick</a> was prohibitive. <a href="Matthew%20Paris">Matthew Paris</a> wrote that Richard stated: "You might as well say, 'I make you a present of the moon – step up to the sky and take it down'." Instead, Henry purchased the kingdom for his son Edmund, which angered many powerful barons. The barons led by Henry's brother-in-law Simon de Montfort forced him to agree to the <a href="Provisions%20of%20Oxford">Provisions of Oxford</a>, under which his debts were paid in exchange for substantial reforms. In France, with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281259%29">Treaty of Paris</a>, Henry formally surrendered the territory of his Angevin ancestors to <a href="Louis%20IX%20of%20France">Louis IX of France</a>, receiving in return the title duke of Aquitaine and the territory of Gascony as a vassal of the French king. 

Disagreements between the barons and the king intensified. The barons, under <a href="Simon%20de%20Montfort%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester</a>, captured most of southeast England in the <a href="Second%20Barons%27%20War">Second Barons' War</a>. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lewes">Battle of Lewes</a> in 1264, Henry and Prince Edward were defeated and taken prisoner. De Montfort assembled the <a href="Montfort%27s%20Parliament">Great Parliament</a>, recognized as the first Parliament because it was the first time the cities and boroughs had sent representatives. Edward escaped, raised an army and defeated and killed de Montfort at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Evesham">Battle of Evesham</a> in 1265. Savage retribution was inflicted upon the rebels, and authority restored to Henry. With the realm now peaceful, Edward left England to join Louis IX on the <a href="Ninth%20Crusade">Ninth Crusade</a>; he was one of the last crusaders. Louis died before Edward's arrival, but Edward decided to continue. The result was disappointing; Edward's small force only enabled him to capture <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">Acre</a> and launch a handful of raids. After surviving an assassination attempt, Edward left for Sicily later in the year, never to participate in a crusade again. When Henry III died, Edward acceded to the throne; the barons swore allegiance to him even though he did not return for two years.

Edward I married <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Castile">Eleanor of Castile</a>, daughter of <a href="Ferdinand%20III%20of%20Castile">King Ferdinand of Castile</a>, a great grandson of Henry II through his second daughter Eleanor in 1254. Edward and Eleanor had sixteen children; five daughters survived to adulthood, but only one son survived Edward:


Following Eleanor's death in 1290, Edward married <a href="Margaret%20of%20France%2C%20Queen%20of%20England">Margaret of France</a>, daughter of <a href="Philip%20III%20of%20France">Philip III of France</a>, in 1299. Edward and Margaret had two sons, who both lived to adulthood, and a daughter who died as a child:


Evidence for Edward's involvement in legal reform is hard to find but his reign saw a major programme of legal change. Much of the drive and determination is likely to have come from the king and his experience of the baronial reform movement of the late 1250s and early 1260s. With the <a href="Statutes%20of%20Mortmain">Statutes of Mortmain</a>, Edward imposed his authority over the Church; the statutes prohibited land donation to the Church, asserted the rights of the Crown at the expense of traditional feudal privileges, promoted the uniform administration of justice, raised income and codified the legal system. His military campaigns left him in heavy debt and when <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20France">Philip IV of France</a> confiscated the Duchy of <a href="Gascony">Gascony</a> in 1294, Edward needed funds to wage war in France. When Edward summoned a precedent-setting <a href="Model%20Parliament">assembly</a> in order to raise more taxes for military finance, he included lesser landowners and merchants. The resulting parliament included barons, clergy, knights, and burgesses for the first time.

On his accession, Edward I sought to organise his realm, enforcing his claims to primacy in the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>. <a href="Llywelyn%20ap%20Gruffudd">Llywelyn ap Gruffudd</a> claimed to rule <a href="North%20Wales">North Wales</a> "entirely separate from" England but Edward viewed him to be "a rebel and disturber of the peace". Edward's determination, military experience and skilful naval manoeuvres ended what was to him rebellion. The invasion was executed by one of the largest armies ever assembled by an English king, comprising Anglo-Norman cavalry and Welsh archers and laying the foundation for future victories in France. Llywelyn was driven into the mountains, later dying in battle. The <a href="Statute%20of%20Rhuddlan">Statute of Rhuddlan</a> established England's authority over Wales, and Edward's son was proclaimed the first English <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a> upon his birth. Edward spent vast sums on his two Welsh campaigns with a large portion of it spent on a network of castles.

Edward asserted that the <a href="List%20of%20Scottish%20monarchs">king of Scotland</a> owed him feudal allegiance, and intended to unite the two nations by marrying his son <a href="Edward%20II%20of%20England">Edward</a> to <a href="Margaret%2C%20Maid%20of%20Norway">Margaret</a>, the sole heir of King <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Scotland">Alexander III</a>. When Margaret died in 1290, <a href="Competitors%20for%20the%20Crown%20of%20Scotland">competition for the Scottish crown</a> ensued. By invitation of Scottish magnates, Edward I resolved the dispute, ruling in favour of <a href="John%20Balliol">John Balliol</a>, who duly swore loyalty to him and became king. Edward insisted that he was Scotland's sovereign and possessed the right to hear appeals against Balliol's judgements, undermining Balliol's authority. Balliol allied with France in 1295; Edward invaded Scotland the following year, deposing and exiling Balliol.

Edward was less successful in Gascony, which was overrun by the French. With his resources depleting, Edward was forced to reconfirm the Charters, including Magna Carta, to obtain the necessary funds. In 1303 the French king restored Gascony to Edward by signing the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281303%29">Treaty of Paris</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="William%20Wallace">William Wallace</a> rose in Balliol's name and recovered most of Scotland. Wallace was defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Falkirk%20%281298%29">Battle of Falkirk</a>, after which <a href="Robert%20the%20Bruce">Robert the Bruce</a> rebelled and was crowned king of Scotland. Edward died while travelling to Scotland for another campaign.

King Edward II's coronation oath on his succession in 1307 was the first to reflect the king's responsibility to maintain the laws that the community "shall have chosen" ( in French). He was not unpopular initially but faced three challenges: discontent over the financing of wars; his household spending; and the role of his <a href="favourite">favourite</a> <a href="Piers%20Gaveston">Piers Gaveston</a>. When Parliament decided that Gaveston should be exiled the king was left with no choice but to comply. Edward engineered Gaveston's return, but was forced to agree to the appointment of <a href="Ordainers">Ordainers</a>, led by his cousin <a href="Thomas%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Lancaster">Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster</a>, to reform the royal household with Piers Gaveston exiled again. When Gaveston returned again to England, he was abducted and executed after a mock trial. The ramifications of this drove Thomas and his adherents from power. Edward's humiliating defeat by Bruce at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bannockburn">Battle of Bannockburn</a>, confirming Bruce's position as an independent king of Scots, leading to Lancaster being appointed head of the king's council. Edward finally repealed the Ordinances after defeating and executing Lancaster at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Boroughbridge">Battle of Boroughbridge</a> in 1322.

The French monarchy asserted its rights to encroach on Edward's legal rights in Gascony. Resistance to one judgement in <a href="Saint-Sardos%2C%20Lot-et-Garonne">Saint-Sardos</a> resulted in Charles IV declaring the duchy forfeit. Charles's sister, <a href="Isabella%20of%20France">Queen Isabella</a>, was sent to negotiate and agreed a treaty that required Edward to pay homage in France to Charles. Edward resigned Aquitaine and Ponthieu to his son <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward</a>, who travelled to France to give homage in his stead. With the English heir in her power, Isabella refused to return to England unless Edward II dismissed his favourites, and she became the mistress of <a href="Roger%20Mortimer%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20March">Roger Mortimer</a>. The couple invaded England and, with <a href="Henry%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Lancaster">Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster</a>, captured the king. Edward II abdicated on condition that his son would inherit the throne rather than Mortimer. Although there is no historical record of the cause of death, he is popularly believed to have been murdered at Berkeley Castle by having a red-hot poker thrust into his bowels. A coup by Edward III ended four years of control by Isabella and Mortimer. Mortimer was executed. Though removed from power, Isabella was treated well, and lived in luxury for the next 27 years.

In 1328 <a href="Charles%20IV%20of%20France">Charles IV of France</a> died without a male heir. Queen Isabella made a claim to throne of France on behalf of her son Edward on the grounds that he was a <a href="matrilineal">matrilineal</a> grandson of Philip IV of France. However, the precedents set by Philip V's succession over his niece <a href="Joan%20II%20of%20Navarre">Joan II of Navarre</a> and Charles IV's succession over his nieces meant that the senior grandson of Philip III in the male line, Phillip of Valois, became king. Not yet in power, Edward paid homage to Phillip as Duke of Aquitaine.

In 1337 Phillip confiscated Aquitaine and Ponthieu from Edward alleging he was harbouring Phillip's fugitive cousin and enemy, <a href="Robert%20III%20of%20Artois">Robert of Artois</a>. In response, Edward proclaimed himself king of France to encourage the Flemish to rise in open rebellion against the French king. The conflict, later known as the Hundred Years' War, included a significant English naval victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sluys">Battle of Sluys</a>, and a victory on land at <a href="Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy">Crécy</a>, leaving Edward free to capture the important port of <a href="Calais">Calais</a>. A subsequent victory against Scotland at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Neville%27s%20Cross">Battle of Neville's Cross</a> resulted in the capture of <a href="David%20II%20of%20Scotland">David II</a> and reduced the threat from Scotland. The <a href="Black%20Death%20in%20England">Black Death</a> brought a halt to Edward's campaigns by killing perhaps a third of his subjects. The only Plantagenet known to have died from the Black Death was Edward III's daughter <a href="Joan%20of%20England%20%281335%E2%80%931348%29">Joan</a> in <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>.
<a href="Edward%2C%20the%20Black%20Prince">Edward, the Black Prince</a> resumed the war with destructive <a href="chevauch%C3%A9e">chevauchée</a>s starting from Bordeaux. His army was caught by a much larger French force at <a href="Poitiers">Poitiers</a>, but the ensuing <a href="Battle%20of%20Poitiers">battle</a> was a decisive English victory resulting in the capture of <a href="John%20II%20of%20France">John II of France</a>. John agreed a <a href="Second%20Treaty%20of%20London">treaty</a> promising the French would pay a four million écus ransom. The subsequent <a href="Treaty%20of%20Br%C3%A9tigny">Treaty of Brétigny</a> was demonstrably popular in England, where it was both ratified in parliament and celebrated with great ceremony. To reach agreement, clauses were removed that would have had Edward renounce his claim to the French crown in return for territory in Aquitaine and the town of Calais. These were entered in another agreement to be effected only after the transfer of territory by November 1361 but both sides prevaricated over their commitments for the following nine years. Hostages from the Valois family were held in London while John returned to France to raise his ransom. Edward had restored the lands of the former Angevin Empire holding Normandy, Brittany, Anjou, Maine and the coastline from <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> to Spain. When the hostages escaped back to France, John was horrified that his word had been broken and returned to England, where he eventually died.

Fighting in the Hundred Years' War spilled from the French and Plantagenet lands into surrounding realms, including the dynastic conflict in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castile</a> between Peter of Castile and <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20Castile">Henry II of Castile</a>. The Black Prince allied himself with Peter, defeating Henry at the <a href="Battle%20of%20N%C3%A1jera">Battle of Nájera</a>. Edward and Peter fell out when Peter was unable to reimburse Edward's military expenses leaving him bankrupt. The Plantagenets continued to interfere, and <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster">John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster</a>, the Black Prince's brother, married Peter's daughter <a href="Constance%20of%20Castile%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Lancaster">Constance</a>, claiming the Crown of Castile in her name. He invaded with an army of 5000 men. Fighting was inconclusive before Gaunt agreed a treaty with <a href="John%20I%20of%20Castile">King Juan of Castile</a>. Terms of the treaty included the marriage of John of Gaunt's daughter <a href="Catherine%20of%20Lancaster">Katherine</a> to Juan's son, <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20Castile">Enrique</a>.

<a href="Charles%20V%20of%20France">Charles V of France</a> maintained the terms of the treaty of Brétigny but encouraged others in Aquitaine to challenge the authority of the Plantagenets in Aquitaine. The prince, who had suffered a debilitating illness for nearly a decade which often restricted his movement to being carried in a litter, returned to England, where he soon died. John of Gaunt assumed leadership in France with limited success, and peace negotiations over several years were inconclusive.

The marriage of Edward III and <a href="Philippa%20of%20Hainault">Philippa of Hainault</a> produced thirteen children and thirty-two grandchildren:
Edward's long reign had forged a new national identity, reinforced by Middle English beginning to establish itself as the spoken and written language of government. As a result, he is considered by many historians in cultural respects the first 'English' post-conquest ruler.

The Black Prince's ten-year-old son succeeded as <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">Richard II of England</a> on the death of his grandfather, nominally exercising all the powers of kingship supported by various councils. His government levied <a href="Taxation%20in%20medieval%20England">poll taxes</a> to finance military campaigns and combined with the poor state of the economy resulted in the <a href="Peasants%27%20Revolt">Peasants' Revolt</a> in 1381, followed by brutal reprisals against the rebels.

The king's uncle <a href="Thomas%20of%20Woodstock%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester</a>, <a href="Richard%20FitzAlan%2C%2011th%20Earl%20of%20Arundel">Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel</a>, and <a href="Thomas%20de%20Beauchamp%2C%2012th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick</a>, became known as the <a href="Lords%20Appellant">Lords Appellant</a> when they sought to impeach five of the king's favourites and restrain what was increasingly seen as tyrannical and capricious rule. Later they were joined by <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">Henry Bolingbroke</a>, the son and heir of John of Gaunt, and <a href="Thomas%20de%20Mowbray%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk</a>. Initially, they were successful in establishing a commission to govern England for one year, but they were forced to rebel against Richard, defeating an army under <a href="Robert%20de%20Vere%2C%20Duke%20of%20Ireland">Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford</a>, at the skirmish of <a href="Radcot%20Bridge%20%28Battle%29">Radcot Bridge</a>.

Richard was reduced to a figurehead with little power. As a result of the <a href="Merciless%20Parliament">Merciless Parliament</a>, de Vere and <a href="Michael%20de%20la%20Pole%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Suffolk">Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk</a>, who had fled abroad, were sentenced to death in their absence. <a href="Alexander%20Neville">Alexander Neville, Archbishop of York</a>, had all his possessions confiscated. Several of Richard's council were executed. On John of Gaunt's return from Spain, Richard was able to re-establish his power, having Gloucester murdered in captivity in Calais. Warwick was stripped of his title. Bolingbroke and Mowbray were exiled.

When John of Gaunt died in 1399, Richard disinherited John's son, Henry, who invaded England in response with a small force that quickly grew in numbers. Meeting little resistance, Henry deposed Richard to have himself crowned Henry IV of England. Richard died in captivity early the next year, probably murdered, bringing an end to the main Plantagenet line. None of Henry's heirs were free from challenge on the grounds of not being the true heir of Richard II and that the Lancastrian dynasty had gained the throne by an act of usurpation.

Henry married his Plantagenet cousin <a href="Mary%20de%20Bohun">Mary de Bohun</a>, who was paternally descended from Edward I and maternally from Edmund Crouchback. They had seven children:


Henry went to convoluted legal means to justify his succession. Many Lancastrians asserted that his mother had had legitimate rights through her descent from <a href="Edmund%20Crouchback">Edmund Crouchback</a>, who it was claimed was the elder son of Henry III of England, set aside due to deformity. As the great-grandson of <a href="Lionel%20of%20Antwerp%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Clarence">Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence</a>, <a href="Edmund%20Mortimer%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20March">Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March</a>, was the heir presumptive to Richard II and Henry used multiple rationales stressing his Plantagenet descent, divine grace, powerful friends, and Richard's misgovernment. In fact Mortimer never showed interest in the throne. The later marriage of his sister <a href="Anne%20de%20Mortimer">Anne</a> to <a href="Richard%20of%20Conisburgh%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Cambridge">Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge</a> consolidated this claim to the throne with that of the more junior <a href="House%20of%20York">House of York</a>. Henry planned to resume war with France, but was plagued with financial problems, declining health and frequent rebellions. He defeated a Scottish invasion, a serious rebellion by <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland</a> in the North and <a href="Owain%20Glynd%C5%B5r">Owain Glyndŵr</a>'s rebellion in Wales. Many saw it as a punishment from God when Henry was later struck down with unknown but chronic illnesses.

Henry IV died in 1413. His son and successor, <a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">Henry V of England</a>, aware that <a href="Charles%20VI%20of%20France">Charles VI of France</a>'s mental illness had caused instability in France, invaded to assert the Plantagenet claims and won a near total victory over the French at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Agincourt">Battle of Agincourt</a>. In subsequent years Henry recaptured much of Normandy and secured marriage to <a href="Catherine%20of%20Valois">Catherine of Valois</a>. The resulting <a href="Treaty%20of%20Troyes">Treaty of Troyes</a> stated that Henry's heirs would inherit the throne of France, but conflict continued with <a href="Charles%20VII%20of%20France">the Dauphin</a>. When Henry died in 1422, his nine-month-old son succeeded him as <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">Henry VI of England</a>. During the minority of Henry VI the war caused political division among his Plantagenet uncles, Bedford, <a href="Humphrey%20of%20Lancaster%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester</a>, and <a href="Cardinal%20Beaufort">Cardinal Beaufort</a>. Humphrey's wife was accused of treasonable <a href="necromancy">necromancy</a> after two astrologers in her employ unwisely, if honestly, predicted a serious illness would endanger Henry VI's life, and Humphrey was later arrested and died in prison.

Depopulation stemming from the Black Death led to increased wages, static food costs and a resulting improvement in the standard of living for the peasantry. However, under Henry misgovernment and harvest failures depressed the English economy to a pitiful state known as the <a href="Great%20Slump%20%2815th%20century%29">Great Slump</a>. The economy was in ruins by 1450, a consequence of the loss of France, piracy in the channel and poor trading relations with the <a href="Hanseatic%20League">Hanseatic League</a>. The economic slowdown began in the 1430s in the north of the country, spreading south in the 1440s, with the economy not recovering until the 1480s. It was also driven by multiple harvest failures in the 1430s and disease amongst livestock, which drove up the price of food and damaged the wider economy. Certain groups were particularly badly affected: cloth exports fell by 35 per cent in just four years at the end of the 1440s, collapsing by up to 90 per cent in some parts of the South-West. The Crown's debts reached £372,000, Henry's deficit was £20,000 per annum, and tax revenues were half those of his father.

Edward III made his fourth son Edmund the first <a href="duke%20of%20York">duke of York</a> in 1362. Edmund was married to Isabella, a daughter of King Peter of Castile and <a href="Mar%C3%ADa%20de%20Padilla">María de Padilla</a> and the sister of Constance of Castile, who was the second wife of Edmund's brother John of Gaunt. Both of Edmund's sons were killed in 1415. <a href="Richard%20of%20Conisburgh%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Cambridge">Richard</a> became involved in the <a href="Southampton%20Plot">Southampton Plot</a>, a conspiracy to depose Henry V in favour of Richard's brother-in-law Edmund Mortimer. When Mortimer revealed the plot to the king, Richard was executed for treason. Richard's childless older brother <a href="Edward%20of%20Norwich%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20York">Edward</a> was killed at the Battle of Agincourt later the same year. <a href="Constance%20of%20York">Constance of York</a> was Edmund's only daughter and was an ancestor of Queen <a href="Anne%20Neville">Anne Neville</a>. The increasingly interwoven Plantagenet relationships were demonstrated by Edmund's second marriage to <a href="Joan%20Holland">Joan Holland</a>. Her sister <a href="Alianore%20Holland%2C%20Countess%20of%20March">Alianore Holland</a> was mother to Richard's wife, Anne Mortimer. <a href="Margaret%20Holland">Margaret Holland</a>, another of Joan's sisters, married <a href="John%20Beaufort%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Somerset">John of Gaunt's son</a>. She later married <a href="Thomas%20of%20Lancaster%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Clarence">Thomas of Lancaster</a>, John of Gaunt's grandson by King Henry IV. A third sister, <a href="Eleanor%20Holland%2C%20Countess%20of%20Salisbury">Eleanor Holland</a>, was mother-in-law to <a href="Richard%20Neville%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury</a>John's grandson by his daughter <a href="Joan%20Beaufort%2C%20Countess%20of%20Westmorland">Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland</a>. These sisters were all granddaughters of Joan of Kent, the mother of Richard II, and therefore Plantagenet descendants of Edward I.

Edmund's son Richard was married to Anne Mortimer, the daughter of <a href="Roger%20Mortimer%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20March">Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March</a> and <a href="Alianore%20Holland">Eleanor Holland</a> and great-granddaughter of Edward III's second surviving son Lionel. Anne died giving birth to their only son in September 1411. Richard's execution four years later left two orphans: <a href="Isabel%20of%20Cambridge%2C%20Countess%20of%20Essex">Isabel</a>, who married into the Bourchier family, and a son who was also called Richard. Although his earldom was forfeited, Richard (the father) was not <a href="attainder">attainted</a>, and the four-year-old orphan Richard was his heir. Within months of his father's death, Richard's childless uncle, Edward Duke of York, was killed at Agincourt. Richard was allowed to inherit the title of Duke of York in 1426. In 1432 he acquired the earldoms of March and Ulster on the death of his maternal uncle Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, who had died campaigning with Henry V in France, and the earldom of Cambridge which had belonged to his father. Being descended from Edward III in both the maternal and the paternal line gave Richard a significant claim to the throne if the Lancastrian line should fail, and by <a href="cognatic%20primogeniture">cognatic primogeniture</a> arguably a superior claim. He emphasised the point by being the first to assume the Plantagenet surname in 1448. Having inherited the March and Ulster titles, he became the wealthiest and most powerful noble in England, second only to the king himself. Richard married <a href="Cecily%20Neville%2C%20Duchess%20of%20York">Cecily Neville</a>, a granddaughter of John of Gaunt, and had thirteen or possibly fifteen children:

When Henry VI had a mental breakdown, Richard was named regent, but the birth of a male heir resolved the question of succession. When Henry's sanity returned, the court party reasserted its authority, but Richard of York and the Nevilles defeated them at a skirmish called the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20St%20Albans">First Battle of St Albans</a>. The ruling class was deeply shocked and reconciliation was attempted. York and the Nevilles fled abroad, but the Nevilles returned to win the <a href="Battle%20of%20Northampton%20%281460%29">Battle of Northampton</a>, where they captured Henry. When Richard of York joined them he surprised Parliament by claiming the throne and forcing through the <a href="Act%20of%20Accord">Act of Accord</a>, which stated that Henry would remain as king for his lifetime, but would be succeeded by York. Margaret found this disregard for her son's claims unacceptable, and so the conflict continued. York was killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wakefield">Battle of Wakefield</a> and his head set on display at <a href="Micklegate%20Bar">Micklegate Bar</a> along with those of <a href="Edmund%2C%20Earl%20of%20Rutland">Edmund, Earl of Rutland</a>, and Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, who had been captured and beheaded. The Scottish queen <a href="Mary%20of%20Guelders">Mary of Guelders</a> provided Margaret with support but London welcomed York's son <a href="Edward%20IV%20of%20England">Edward, Earl of March</a> and Parliament confirmed that Edward should be made king. He was crowned after consolidating his position with victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Towton">Battle of Towton</a>.

Edward's preferment of the former Lancastrian-supporting Woodville family, following his marriage to <a href="Elizabeth%20Woodville">Elizabeth Woodville</a>, led Warwick and Clarence to help Margaret depose Edward and return Henry to the throne. Edward and <a href="Richard%20III%20of%20England">Richard, Duke of Gloucester</a>, fled, but on their return, Clarence switched sides at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Barnet">Battle of Barnet</a>, leading to the death of the Neville brothers. The subsequent <a href="Battle%20of%20Tewkesbury">Battle of Tewkesbury</a> brought the demise of the last of the male line of the Beauforts. The battlefield execution of <a href="Edward%20of%20Westminster%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales</a>, and the later probable murder of Henry VI extinguished the House of Lancaster.

By the mid-1470s, the victorious House of York looked safely established, with seven living male princes: Edward IV and his two sons, his brother George and George's son, his brother Richard and Richard's son. Edward and Elizabeth Woodville themselves had ten children, seven of whom survived him:

Dynastic infighting and misfortune quickly brought about the demise of the House of York. <a href="George%20Plantagenet%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Clarence">George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence</a>, plotted against his brother and was executed. Following Edward's premature death in 1483, his brother Richard had Parliament declare Edward's two sons illegitimate on the pretext of an alleged prior pre-contract to <a href="Lady%20Eleanor%20Talbot">Lady Eleanor Talbot</a>, leaving Edward's marriage invalid. Richard seized the throne, and the <a href="Princes%20in%20the%20Tower">Princes in the Tower</a> were never seen again. Richard's son predeceased him and Richard was killed in 1485 after an invasion of foreign mercenaries led by <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry Tudor</a>, who claimed the throne through his mother <a href="Margaret%20Beaufort%2C%20Countess%20of%20Richmond%20and%20Derby">Margaret Beaufort</a>. Tudor assumed the throne as Henry VII, founding the Tudor dynasty and bringing the Plantagenet line of kings to an end.

When Henry Tudor seized the throne there were eighteen Plantagenet descendants who might today be thought to have a stronger hereditary claim, and by 1510 this number had been increased further by the birth of sixteen Yorkist children. Henry mitigated this situation with his marriage to <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20York">Elizabeth of York</a>. She was the eldest daughter of Edward IV, and all their children were his cognatic heirs. Indeed, <a href="Polydore%20Vergil">Polydore Vergil</a> noted Henry VIII's pronounced resemblance to his grandfather Edward: "For just as Edward was the most warmly thought of by the English people amongst all English kings, so this successor of his, Henry, was very much like him in general appearance, in greatness of mind and generosity and for that reason was the most acclaimed and approved of all."

This did not deter <a href="Margaret%20of%20York">Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy</a>Edward's sister and Elizabeth's auntand members of the de la Pole familychildren of Edward's sister and <a href="John%20de%20la%20Pole%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Suffolk">John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk</a> from frequent attempts to destabilise Henry's regime. Henry imprisoned Margaret's nephew <a href="Edward%20Plantagenet%2C%2017th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Edward, Earl of Warwick</a>, the son of her brother George, in the Tower of London, but in 1487 Margaret financed a rebellion led by <a href="Lambert%20Simnel">Lambert Simnel</a> pretending to be Edward. <a href="John%20de%20la%20Pole%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Lincoln">John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln</a>, joined the revolt, probably anticipating that it would further his own ambitions to the throne, but he was killed in the suppression of the uprising at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stoke%20Field">Battle of Stoke Field</a> in 1487. Warwick was implicated by two further failed invasions supported by Margaret using <a href="Perkin%20Warbeck">Perkin Warbeck</a> pretending to be Edward IV's son Richard of Shrewsbury, and Warbeck's later planned escape for them both; Warwick was executed in 1499. Edward's execution may simply have been a precondition for the marriage of <a href="Arthur%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Arthur, Prince of Wales</a> to <a href="Katherine%20of%20Aragon">Katherine of Aragon</a> in 1501.

John de la Pole's attainder meant that his brother Edmund inherited their father's titles, but much of the wealth of the duchy of Suffolk was forfeit. Edmund did not possess sufficient finances to maintain his status as a duke, so as a compromise he accepted the title of earl of Suffolk. Financial difficulties led to frequent legal conflicts and Edmund's indictment for murder in 1501. He fled with his brother Richard, while their remaining brother, William, was imprisoned in the Towerwhere he would remain until his death 37 years lateras part of a general suppression of Edmund's associates <a href="Philip%20I%20of%20Castile">Philip the Fair</a> had been holding Edmund and in 1506 he returned him to Henry. Edmund was imprisoned in the Tower. In 1513, he was executed after Richard de la Pole, whom <a href="Louis%20XII%20of%20France">Louis XII of France</a> had recognised as king of England the previous year, claimed the kingship in his own right. Richard, known as the White Rose, plotted an invasion of England for years but was killed in 1525 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pavia">Battle of Pavia</a> while fighting as the captain of the French <a href="landsknechts">landsknechts</a> during <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20I%20of%20France">François I of France</a>'s invasion of Italy.

Warwick's sister, and therefore Edward IV's niece, <a href="Margaret%20Pole%2C%20Countess%20of%20Salisbury">Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury</a>, was executed by Henry VIII in 1541. By then, the cause was more religious and political rather than dynastic. The attainder of her father, <a href="George%20Plantagenet%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Clarence">Clarence</a>, was a legal bar to any claims to the throne by his children. Additionally her marriage, arranged by Henry VII, to <a href="Sir%20Richard%20Pole">Sir Richard Pole</a>, his half-cousin and trusted supporter, was not auspicious. Nevertheless, it did allow the couple to be closely involved in court affairs. Margaret's fortunes improved under Henry VIII and in February 1512 she was restored to the <a href="Earl%20of%20Salisbury">earldom of Salisbury</a> and all the Warwicks' lands. This made her the first and, apart from <a href="Anne%20Boleyn">Anne Boleyn</a>, the only woman in 16th-century England to hold a peerage title in her own right.

Her daughter <a href="Ursula%20Pole%2C%20Baroness%20Stafford">Ursula</a> married the son of <a href="Edward%20Stafford%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham">Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham</a>. Buckingham's fall after arguments with the king over property, and Margaret's open support for <a href="Catherine%20of%20Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a> and <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Princess Mary</a> began the Poles' estrangement from the king. Hope of reconciliation was dashed by "De unitate", the letter that Margaret's son <a href="Reginald%20Pole">Reginald Pole</a> wrote to Henry VIII, in which Reginald declared his opposition to the royal supremacy. In 1538 evidence came to light that Pole family members in England had been in communication with Reginald. Margaret's sons <a href="Geoffrey%20Pole">Geoffrey</a> and <a href="Henry%20Pole%2C%201st%20Baron%20Montagu">Henry</a> were arrested for treason along with several friends and associates, including Henry's wife and brother-in-law<a href="Sir%20Edward%20Neville">Edward Neville</a>. Among those arrested was the king's cousin <a href="Henry%20Courtenay%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Exeter">Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter</a>, his wife and 11-year-old son. Courteney's wife was released two years later, but their son spent 15 years in the Tower until Queen Mary released him. Except for the surviving Geoffrey Pole, all the others implicated were beheaded.

Margaret was attainted. The possibility of an invasion involving Reginald via her south coast estates and her embittered relationship with Henry VIII precluded any chance of pardon. However, the decision to execute her seems a spontaneous, rather than a premeditated, act. According to the Calendar of State Papers her execution was botched at the hands of "a wretched and blundering youth ... who literally hacked her head and shoulders to pieces in the most pitiful manner". In 1886 she was beatified by Pope <a href="Leo%20XIII">Leo XIII</a> on the grounds she had laid down her life for the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a> "and for the truth of the orthodox Faith".

Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, combined multiple lines of Plantagenet descent: from Edward III by his son Thomas of Woodstock, from Edward III via two of his Beaufort grandchildren, and from Edward I from Joan of Kent and the <a href="Holland%20family">Holland family</a>. His father failed in his rebellion against Richard III in 1483 but was restored to his inheritance on the reversal of his father's attainder late in 1485. His mother married Henry VII's uncle <a href="Jasper%20Tudor">Jasper Tudor</a>, and his wardship was entrusted to the king's mother, <a href="Lady%20Margaret%20Beaufort">Lady Margaret Beaufort</a>. In 1502, during Henry VII's illness, there was debate as to whether Buckingham or Edmund de la Pole should act as regent for Henry VIII. There is no evidence of continuous hostility between Buckingham and Henry VIII, but there is little doubt of the duke's dislike of <a href="Thomas%20Wolsey">Thomas Wolsey</a>, whom he believed to be plotting to ruin the old nobility. Therefore, Henry VIII instructed Wolsey to watch Buckingham, his brother <a href="Henry%20Stafford%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Wiltshire">Henry Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire</a>, and three other peers. Neither Henry VIII nor his father planned to destroy Buckingham because of his lineage and Henry VIII even allowed Buckingham's son and heir, <a href="Henry%20Stafford%2C%201st%20Baron%20Stafford">Henry Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford</a>, to marry Ursula Pole, giving the Staffords a further line of royal blood descent. Buckingham himself was arrested in April 1521; he was found guilty on 16 May and executed the next day. Evidence was provided that the duke had been listening to prophecies that he would be king and that the Tudor family lay under God's curse for the execution of Warwick. This was said to explain Henry VIII's failure to produce a male heir. Much of this evidence consisted of ill-judged comments, speculation and bad temper, but it underlined the threat presented by Buckingham's descent.

As late as 1600, with the Tudor succession in doubt, older Plantagenet lines remained as possible claimants to a disputed throne, and religious and dynastic factors gave rise to complications. <a href="Thomas%20Wilson%20%28record%20keeper%29">Thomas Wilson</a> wrote in his report "The State of England, Anno Domini 1600" that there were 12 "competitors" for the succession. At the time of writing (about 1601), Wilson had been working on intelligence matters for <a href="Thomas%20Sackville%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Dorset">Lord Buckhurst</a> and <a href="Sir%20Robert%20Cecil">Sir Robert Cecil</a>.
The alleged competitors included five descendants of Henry VII and Elizabeth, including the eventual successor <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I of England</a>, but also seven from older Plantagenet lines:

<a href="Ranulph%20Crewe">Ranulph Crewe</a>, <a href="Lord%20Chief%20Justice%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Chief Justice of the King's Bench</a>, argued that by 1626 the House of Plantagenet could not be considered to remain in existence in a speech during the Oxford Peerage case, which was to rule on who should inherit the <a href="Earl%20of%20Oxford">earldom of Oxford</a>. It was referred by <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I of England</a> to the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>, who called for judicial assistance. Crewe said:

I have labored to make a covenant with myself, that affection may not press upon judgment; for I suppose there is no man that hath any apprehension of gentry or nobleness, but his affection stands to the continuance of a house so illustrious, and would take hold of a twig or twine-thread to support it. And yet time hath his revolutions; there must be a period and an end to all temporal things – finis rerum – an end of names and dignities, and whatsoever is terrene; and why not of <a href="De%20Vere%20family">de Vere</a>? For where is <a href="Bohun%20family">Bohun</a>? Where is <a href="House%20of%20Mowbray">Mowbray</a>? Where is <a href="Mortimer">Mortimer</a>? Nay, which is more, and most of all, where is Plantagenet? They are entombed in the urns and sepulchres of mortality! yet let the name of de Vere stand so long as it pleaseth God.
