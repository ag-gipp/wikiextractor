Joseph Desha

Joseph Desha (December 9, 1768 – October 11, 1842) was a <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. Representative</a> and the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Kentucky">ninth</a> <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">governor</a> of the U.S. state of <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. After the <a href="Edict%20of%20Fontainebleau">revocation of the Edict of Nantes</a>, Desha's <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> ancestors fled from France to <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, where Desha was born. Eventually, Desha's family settled near present-day <a href="Gallatin%2C%20Tennessee">Gallatin, Tennessee</a>, where they were involved in many skirmishes with the <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Indians</a>. Two of Desha's brothers were killed in these encounters, motivating him to volunteer for "Mad" <a href="Anthony%20Wayne">Anthony Wayne</a>'s campaign against the Indians during the <a href="Northwest%20Indian%20War">Northwest Indian War</a>. Having by then resettled in <a href="Mason%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Mason County, Kentucky</a>, Desha parlayed his military record into several terms in the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">state legislature</a>.

In 1807, Desha was elected to the first of six consecutive terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. A <a href="Democratic-Republican%20Party">Democratic-Republican</a>, he was considered a <a href="war%20hawk">war hawk</a>, supporting the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. In 1813, he volunteered to serve in the war and commanded a <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Thames">Battle of the Thames</a>. Returning to Congress after the war, he was the only member of the Kentucky congressional delegation to oppose the unpopular <a href="Compensation%20Act%20of%201816">Compensation Act of 1816</a>. Nearly every other member of the delegation was defeated for reelection after the vote, but Desha's opposition to the act helped him retain his seat. He did not seek reelection in 1818, and made an unsuccessful run for governor in 1820, losing to <a href="John%20Adair">John Adair</a>. By 1824, the <a href="Panic%20of%201819">Panic of 1819</a> had ruined Kentucky's economy, and Desha made a second campaign for the governorship almost exclusively on promises of relief for the state's large debtor class. He was elected by a large majority, and debt relief partisans captured both houses of the General Assembly. After the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a> overturned debt relief laws favored by Desha and the majority of the legislature, the legislators abolished the court and created a replacement court, to which Desha appointed several debt relief partisans. The existing court refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the move, and during a period known as the <a href="Old%20Court%20%E2%80%93%20New%20Court%20controversy">Old Court – New Court controversy</a>, two <a href="court%20of%20last%20resort">courts of last resort</a> existed in the state.

Although popular when elected, Desha's reputation was damaged by two controversies during his term. The first was his role in the ouster of <a href="Horace%20Holley%20%28minister%29">Horace Holley</a> as president of <a href="Transylvania%20University">Transylvania University</a>. While the religious conservatives on the university's board opposed Holley because they considered him too liberal, Desha's opposition was primarily based on Holley's friendship with <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>, one of Desha's political enemies. After Desha bitterly denounced Holley in an address to the legislature in late 1825, Holley resigned. Desha's reputation took a further hit after his son, Isaac, was charged with murder. Partially because of Desha's influence as governor, two guilty verdicts were overturned. After the younger Desha unsuccessfully attempted suicide while awaiting a third trial, Governor Desha issued a <a href="pardon">pardon</a> for his son. These controversies, along with an improving economy, propelled Desha's political foes to victory in the legislative elections of 1825 and 1826. They abolished the so-called "Desha court" over Desha's veto, ending the court controversy. In a final act of defiance, Desha threatened to refuse to vacate the <a href="Old%20Governor%27s%20Mansion%20%28Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky%29">governor's mansion</a>, although he ultimately acquiesced without incident, ceding the governorship to his successor, <a href="National%20Republican%20Party">National Republican</a> <a href="Thomas%20Metcalfe%20%28Kentucky%29">Thomas Metcalfe</a>. At the expiration of his term, he retired from public life and ultimately died at <a href="Payne-Desha%20House">his son's home</a> in <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Kentucky">Georgetown, Kentucky</a>, on October 11, 1842.

Joseph Desha was born to Robert and Eleanor (Wheeler) Desha in <a href="Monroe%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Monroe County, Pennsylvania</a>, on December 9, 1768. He was of part French <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> ancestry, and his ancestors had fled from France to <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> after the <a href="Edict%20of%20Fontainebleau">revocation of the Edict of Nantes</a>, which had largely protected the Huguenots from religious persecution. He obtained a limited education in the state's rural schools. In July 1781, Desha's family relocated to <a href="Fayette%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Fayette County, Kentucky</a>, and the following year, they settled in what was then known as Cumberland district near the present-day city of <a href="Gallatin%2C%20Tennessee">Gallatin, Tennessee</a>. Desha's younger brother, <a href="Robert%20Desha">Robert</a>, would later represent <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>.

Like most frontier settlers, the Desha family frequently found themselves in conflict with American <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indians</a> after moving to Tennessee, and between the ages of 15 and 22, Joseph Desha volunteered in several military campaigns against them. In one such campaign, two of his brothers were killed while fighting alongside him. Following the war, Desha lived with <a href="William%20Whitley">William Whitley</a> in the town of <a href="Crab%20Orchard%2C%20Kentucky">Crab Orchard, Kentucky</a>. He married Margaret "Peggy" Bledsoe in December 1789. The couple had thirteen children over the course of their marriage. In 1792, the family moved to Mason County, Kentucky, where Desha worked as a farmer. In 1794, he served in the <a href="Northwest%20Indian%20War">Northwest Indian War</a> under Lieutenant <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a>. He participated in General "Mad" <a href="Anthony%20Wayne">Anthony Wayne</a>'s rout of the Indians at the August 20 <a href="Battle%20of%20Fallen%20Timbers">Battle of Fallen Timbers</a>.

Desha entered politics in 1797, when he was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a>. When the House debated the <a href="Kentucky%20Resolutions">Kentucky Resolutions</a> in 1798, he chaired the <a href="Committee%20of%20the%20Whole">Committee of the Whole</a>. He again served in the House from 1799 to 1802, and was elected to the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">Kentucky Senate</a> from 1802 to 1807. Concurrent with his legislative career, he continued to serve in the state militia. On January 23, 1798, he was appointed as a <a href="major">major</a> in the 29th Regiment. He was promoted to <a href="colonel">colonel</a> on March 23, 1799, and on September 5, 1805, he was promoted to <a href="brigadier%20general">brigadier general</a> and given command of the 7th Brigade of the Kentucky Militia. On December 24, 1806, he was made a <a href="major%20general">major general</a>, remaining with the 7th Brigade.

Desha was elected without opposition to the first of six consecutive terms in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1807. Though he was known as a capable orator, he did not speak often, claiming it was best "to think much and speak but little." He opposed renewing the charter of the <a href="First%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">First Bank of the United States</a> because most of the bank's investors were foreigners. Specifically, he was concerned about the fact King <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a> of Great Britain was a major shareholder. (It was thought by many that the British monarch was on the verge of madness at this time.) The bank's charter ultimately was not renewed in 1811.
Early in his career, Desha advocated an adequate army to defend American territory from Great Britain and France. He supported President <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>'s <a href="Embargo%20Act%20of%201807">Embargo Act of 1807</a> and related enforcement legislation. He was considered a <a href="war%20hawk">war hawk</a>, and <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House Speaker</a> <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>, a fellow Kentuckian and leader of the War Hawks in the House, selected him to serve on the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Affairs">House Foreign Relations Committee</a> during the <a href="12th%20United%20States%20Congress">Twelfth Congress</a> (1811–13). Consistent with Clay's expectations, Desha consistently supported the war measures brought before the House, including bills to arm merchant ships, increase the number of regular troops in U.S. Army, and authorize President <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> to accept volunteer units for military service. Proclaiming his dissatisfaction with <a href="Macon%27s%20Bill%20Number%201">Macon's Bill Number 1</a>, he maintained that all embargoes and sanctions would fail as long as "the British have a Canada or a Nova Scotia on the continent of America", although he acknowledged the high cost in both money and lives that annexation of Canada would entail. On June 4, 1812, he voted in favor of a declaration of war on Great Britain, officially beginning the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>.

Desha returned to Kentucky after the congressional session. He responded to Governor <a href="Isaac%20Shelby">Isaac Shelby</a>'s call for volunteers to serve in William Henry Harrison's campaign into <a href="Upper%20Canada">Upper Canada</a>. He was commissioned a major general and given command of the 2nd Division of Kentucky militia. The 3,500-man division, composed of the 2nd and 5th Brigades and the 11th Regiment, assembled on the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> at <a href="Newport%2C%20Kentucky">Newport, Kentucky</a>. They joined Harrison in forcing the British retreat from <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> and held the Indian allies of the British off his left flank during the American victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Thames">Battle of the Thames</a> on October 5, 1813. According to historian <a href="Bennett%20H.%20Young">Bennett H. Young</a>, Desha's old friend William Whitley had a premonition of his own death the night before the battle and gave his rifle and powderhorn to Desha, asking him to convey it to his widow, along with a message of his affection. Whitley was indeed killed in the fighting the following day.

Desha resumed his service in Congress at its next term. He was disappointed at the decision not to pursue the annexation of Upper Canada and to ignore British impressment of American mariners in favor of pursuing peace with the British. Ultimately, he was dissatisfied with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Ghent">Treaty of Ghent</a> that ended the war. When William Henry Harrison was being considered by Congress for the position of <a href="Commanding%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">general-in-chief</a> in late 1813 and early 1814, Desha opposed giving him the title because he claimed that Harrison had determined not to pursue British General <a href="Henry%20Procter%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Henry Procter</a> following the Battle of the Thames and had only done so after strenuous urging by Isaac Shelby. Desha's charge was a contributing factor in Congress's decision to remove Harrison's name from a <a href="Thanks%20of%20Congress">resolution of thanks</a> for service in the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Northwest%20%28United%20States%29">Northwest Army</a> and withhold from him a <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a>. Both Harrison and Shelby denied Desha's account, and as the issue began to damage Desha's reelection chances, he partially recanted his story. He claimed that he had only told some friends that Harrison was wary of pursuit during a council of war held at <a href="Sandwich%2C%20Ontario">Sandwich, Ontario</a>, after the battle, but that he had not personally witnessed a disagreement over the pursuit between Harrison and Shelby.

Desha gradually became more conservative after his return to the House, consistently resisting expansion of the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a>. He also opposed <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a>'s request to maintain a standing peacetime army of 20,000 men. Desha argued that a large standing army provided the advocates of a larger federal government with an excuse to increase taxes, and proposed that the standing army should consist of only 6,000 men. A coalition of <a href="Federalist%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Federalists</a> and conservative Democratic-Republicans in the House united to adopt Desha's suggestion by a vote of 75–65. The version of the bill passed by the Senate, however, required a standing army of 15,000 men. The legislation was referred to a conference committee, which ultimately adopted a compromise of 10,000 men.

During the <a href="Fourteenth%20Congress">Fourteenth Congress</a> (1815–17), he was the only member of the twelve-member Kentucky congressional delegation to oppose the <a href="Compensation%20Act%20of%201816">Compensation Act of 1816</a>. The act, sponsored by fellow Kentuckian <a href="Richard%20Mentor%20Johnson">Richard Mentor Johnson</a>, modified congressional compensation, paying each member a flat salary of $1,500 a year instead of a $6 "per diem" while Congress was in session. The measure proved extremely unpopular with the electorate. Every member of the Kentucky delegation that voted for the bill – excepting Johnson and Henry Clay, who were both extremely popular – lost his congressional seat, either because he did not seek reelection or because he was defeated by another candidate.

Desha served as <a href="chairman">chairman</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Oversight%20and%20Government%20Reform">Committee on Public Expenditures</a> during the <a href="15th%20United%20States%20Congress">Fifteenth Congress</a> (1817–19). On March 14, 1818, he voted with the minority against a resolution introduced by <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>'s <a href="William%20Lowndes%20%28congressman%29">William Lowndes</a> asserting Congress's power to appropriate federal funds for the construction of <a href="internal%20improvements">internal improvements</a>. He did not run for reelection in 1818.

Desha was one of four candidates who sought the governorship of Kentucky in 1820. In the aftermath of the <a href="Panic%20of%201819">Panic of 1819</a> – the first major financial crisis in United States history – the primary issue of the campaign was debt relief. Sitting governor <a href="Gabriel%20Slaughter">Gabriel Slaughter</a> had lobbied for some measures favored by the state's large debtor class, particularly punitive taxes against the branches of the <a href="Second%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Second Bank of the United States</a> in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a> and <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington</a>. The <a href="Second%20Party%20System">Second Party System</a> had not yet developed, but there were nonetheless two opposing factions that arose around the debt relief issue. The first – primarily composed of <a href="land%20speculation">land speculators</a> who had bought large land parcels on credit and were unable to repay their debts due to the financial crisis – was dubbed the Relief Party or faction and favored more legislation favorable to debtors. Opposed to them was the Anti-Relief Party or faction; it was composed primarily of the state's aristocracy, many of whom were creditors to the land speculators and demanded that their contracts be adhered to without interference from the government. They claimed that no government intervention could effectively aid the debtors and that attempts to do so would only prolong the economic depression.

Although Desha was clearly aligned with the Relief faction, the faction's leader was <a href="John%20Adair">John Adair</a>, a veteran of the War of 1812 whose popularity was augmented because of his very public defense of the Kentuckians who served under him at the <a href="Battle%20of%20New%20Orleans">Battle of New Orleans</a> against charges of cowardice by <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>. Adair won a close election with 20,493 votes, besting <a href="William%20Logan%20%28Kentuckian%29">William Logan</a>'s 19,947 votes, Desha's 12,418 votes, and Anthony Butler's 9,567 votes. Relief partisans also secured control of both houses of the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a>. Much debt relief legislation was passed during Adair's term, but as his term neared expiration, the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a> struck down one popular and expansive debt relief law as unconstitutional, ensuring that debt relief would again be the central issue in the upcoming gubernatorial election.

With Adair constitutionally ineligible to seek a second consecutive term, Desha was the first candidate to publicly declare his intention to seek the governorship in 1824. He began his campaign in late 1823 and faced little opposition until <a href="Christopher%20Tompkins">Christopher Tompkins</a> declared his candidacy in May 1824. Tompkins was a little-known judge from <a href="Bourbon%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Bourbon County</a> who vehemently held to the principles of the Anti-Relief faction. Colonel William Russell, a military veteran of 50 years, also sought to carry the mantle of the Anti-Relief faction. While not as eloquent or well-versed in the faction's rhetoric, he had few political enemies and his military career brought him great respect among the electorate.

While Tompkins and his supporters primarily campaigned through the state's newspapers, most of which supported the Anti-Relief faction, Desha traveled the state making stump speeches. Offering no specific platform, he focused exclusively on the idea that he opposed "judicial usurpation" and believed "all power belonged to the people". He was generally acknowledged as the candidate of the Relief Party, but historian Arndt M. Stickles has noted that he used Anti-Relief rhetoric in some counties. Desha attacked Tompkins' record as a judge, claiming that he had consistently supported the Second Bank of the United States and the current Court of Appeals. This, Desha said, put him in direct and open opposition to the state's farmers and ensured that, if he were elected, the state would be governed by the judicial branch, not the governor. Desha claimed the state's newspapers persecuted him the same way the Anti-Relief party persecuted debtors. He also charged that Tompkins was not the true choice of the Anti-Relief party, but only gained its support by being the first candidate with that position to announce his candidacy. Backers of Russell, who consistently ran a distant third in voter support, agreed with this claim, saying Tompkins had joined the race before a date that had been previously agreed on among Anti-Relief candidates, giving him an unfair advantage over Russell.

Anti-Relief partisans opened many lines of attack against Desha. They said his refusal to articulate a specific campaign platform showed that he was trying to be all things to all people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for <a href="William%20H.%20Crawford">William H. Crawford</a> while serving as a <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">presidential elector</a> in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201816">1816</a>, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.

Although Desha was universally acknowledged as the leading candidate during the early months of the campaign, as election day approached, some began to doubt whether he could withstand the withering attacks of the Anti-Relief Party. The "Frankfort Argus", a pro-Desha newspaper, remained confident, however, predicting that the Relief candidate would win by a margin of 4-to-1. On election day, Desha secured a comfortable victory, receiving 38,378 votes, nearly 60% of the votes cast, and carrying large majorities even in some strongly Anti-Relief counties. Tompkins garnered 22,499 votes, with his support concentrated mostly in Central Kentucky. Russell finished third with 3,900 votes. Desha and his allies in the General Assembly interpreted the victory as a mandate from the voters to aggressively pursue their debt relief agenda.

On November 4, 1824, just months after the election, the state capitol building was destroyed by a fire. Some furnishings and records were saved, but the four-year-old building was a total loss. When <a href="Gilbert%20du%20Motier%2C%20Marquis%20de%20Lafayette">Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette</a> toured the United States in 1825, a new capitol had not yet been constructed and the <a href="Old%20Governor%27s%20Mansion%20%28Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky%29">governor's mansion</a> was too small to host a proper reception, so the governor had to entertain the dignitary at Weisiger's Tavern.

Desha's major accomplishment as governor was in the area of internal improvements. In 1825, he convinced the legislature to fund the creation of the <a href="Louisville%20and%20Portland%20Canal">Louisville and Portland Canal</a> on the <a href="Falls%20of%20the%20Ohio">Falls of the Ohio</a>. The canal opened in 1830, and proved very profitable, so much so that Desha lamented the fact that the state had split the cost of the project – and consequently, its profits – with the federal government and private investors. He also urged state investment in a <a href="Toll%20road">turnpike</a> joining <a href="Maysville%2C%20Kentucky">Maysville</a> to Louisville via Lexington. He advocated using excess money earmarked for education to construct hard-surfaced roads in the state, but the General Assembly was less responsive to this suggestion.

Kentucky historian <a href="Thomas%20D.%20Clark">Thomas D. Clark</a> wrote that Desha "made rash promises to relieve the horde of bankrupt voters ... promises on which he had to deliver." His first address to the legislature was critical of the judiciary in general, especially the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a>'s recent decision in the case of "<a href="Green%20v.%20Biddle">Green v. Biddle</a>" which held that land claims granted by Virginia in the District of Kentucky prior to Kentucky becoming a separate state took precedence over those later granted by the state of Kentucky if the two were in conflict. Encouraged by Desha's strong stance against the judiciary, Relief partisans set about removing the judges on the Court of Appeals who had earlier struck down their debt relief legislation. The first punitive measure proposed against the offending judges was to reduce their salaries to 25 cents per year, but this course was quickly abandoned. Next, legislators attempted to remove the judges by address, but they found they lacked the necessary two-thirds majority in both houses to effect this removal.

Finally, on December 9, 1824, the Kentucky Senate passed a measure repealing the legislation that created the Kentucky Court of Appeals and establishing a new <a href="court%20of%20last%20resort">court of last resort</a> in the state. The bill was sent to the House, and a vigorous debate ensued on December 23. During the debate, which continued past midnight, Desha appeared on the floor of the chamber to lobby legislators to support the bill and actually <a href="Previous%20question">moved the previous question</a> to end debate, which was, in the words of Kentucky historian <a href="Lowell%20H.%20Harrison">Lowell H. Harrison</a>, a "flagrant violation of House rules". The House passed the bill by a vote of 54–43, and Desha signed it immediately.
On January 10, 1825, Desha appointed four justices to the new court. He chose his <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20of%20Kentucky">Secretary of State</a>, former <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senator</a> <a href="William%20T.%20Barry">William T. Barry</a>, as chief justice. The other three members were Lexington lawyer James Haggin, Circuit Judge John Trimble (brother of Supreme Court Justice <a href="Robert%20Trimble">Robert Trimble</a>), and Benjamin Patton. Of the new court – called by detractors the "Desha court" – Barry "seems to have been the only one who had in a measure an even show in experience, prestige, and ability to rank as a jurist with the old-court justices", according to Stickles. Achilles Sneed, clerk of the Old Court, refused to surrender the court's records to <a href="Francis%20P.%20Blair">Francis P. Blair</a>, clerk of the New Court, so Blair took the records from Sneed's office by force, and Sneed was fined 10 <a href="Pound%20sterling">pounds</a> for <a href="contempt%20of%20court">contempt of court</a> because of his refusal to cooperate. The Old Court continued to hear cases in a Frankfort church, while the New Court occupied the official court chambers. Neither recognized the other, and both claimed to be the legitimate court of last resort in the state. Most of the state's lawyers and judges were supporters of the Old Court and continued to practice before them and abide by their mandates, but others chose to acknowledge the New Court as legitimate.

Although Desha and his entire administration campaigned on behalf of New Court candidates during the legislative elections of 1825, Old Court supporters regained the state House and evenly split the Senate between Old and New Court supporters. Desha's message to the newly reconstituted General Assembly remained critical of banks and the judiciary, but urged legislators to seek a compromise to resolve the court question. Stickles records that Desha was sincere in his desire for a compromise, albeit one that would save face for the New Court Party. He promised that, if the legislature would again authorize appointment of a new set of judges, he would appoint them equally from both parties. Another plan would have expanded the court to six judges, with three appointed from each party. One legislator proposed that all members of both courts resign, along with Desha, <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">lieutenant governor</a> <a href="Robert%20B.%20McAfee">Robert B. McAfee</a>, and all the legislators in the General Assembly, essentially allowing the state government to reset itself. This bill passed the House but was killed in the Senate. The House passed a measure to restore the Old Court, but the Senate deadlocked on the measure and McAfee, the presiding officer in the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote to defeat it.

By 1826, the economic climate in the state had improved significantly. Seeing the resultant upsurge in Old Court support, two of the four New Court justices resigned. Desha offered the appointments to three different individuals, all of whom ignored or rejected them. <a href="John%20Telemachus%20Johnson">John Telemachus Johnson</a> finally accepted the appointment in April 1826, and the New Court met with only three justices during its 1826 term. In the August 1826 elections, the Old Court Party won majorities of 56–44 in the House and 22–16 in the Senate. Desha again encouraged the legislators to compromise to resolve the court impasse. The Old Court majorities in both houses, however, completely repudiated the New Court, passing a bill to restore the Old Court and overturn all legislation related to the New Court. Desha <a href="veto">veto</a>ed the bill, and scolded the legislators for passing a blatantly partisan bill as opposed to a compromise measure. The General Assembly overrode Desha's veto on January 1, 1827. In a conciliatory move, the Senate confirmed Desha's appointment of <a href="George%20M.%20Bibb">George M. Bibb</a>, a New Court partisan, to a position on the re-empowered Old Court after <a href="John%20Boyle%20%28congressman%29">John Boyle</a> resigned to accept a federal judgeship in November 1826.

Governor Desha's reputation was further tarnished because of a pardon issued to his son. On November 2, 1824, <a href="Isaac%20B.%20Desha">Isaac B. Desha</a> had brutally murdered Francis Baker, a <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>an who was visiting Kentucky. On November 24, 1824, <a href="John%20Rowan%20%28Kentucky%29">John Rowan</a>, one of the governor's allies in the General Assembly, introduced legislation ordering the <a href="Fleming%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Fleming County</a> Circuit Court to convene a special session on January 17, 1825, for Isaac Desha's trial and providing that the accused should have the option to request a <a href="change%20of%20venue">change of venue</a> to <a href="Harrison%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Harrison County</a> at that time. Miles from the scene of the murder, Harrison County was the governor's home county, and he possessed a great deal of influence with officials there. Governor Desha appeared before the legislative committee considering the bill on November 26 and asked that they report it favorably to the full legislature. This was done, and the bill was approved on December 4, 1824.

At his trial in December, Isaac Desha requested the change of venue; the case was transferred to Harrison County and scheduled for early January. John Trimble was scheduled to hear the case, but Governor Desha appointed him to the New Court of Appeals following the "abolishment" of the Old Court in late 1824. Trimble personally appealed to Judge George Shannon of Lexington to hear the case. Governor Desha assembled a formidable defense team for his son, including his newly appointed Secretary of State, William T. Barry; John Rowan, who had just been elected to the U.S. Senate; and former congressmen <a href="William%20Brown%20%28congressman%29">William Brown</a> and T. P. Taul. William K. Wall and future Congressman <a href="John%20Chambers%20%28politician%29">John Chambers</a> – the <a href="Commonwealth%27s%20Attorney">Commonwealth's Attorney</a>s for Harrison and Fleming counties, respectively – collaborated with attorney Martin P. Marshall to prosecute the case. Governor Desha attended each day of the proceedings, seated with the defense counsel.

Despite the best efforts of his father to secure a favorable venue, judge, and defense team, on January 31, 1825, the jury convicted Isaac Desha of murder and sentenced him to <a href="Hanging">hang</a>. Rowan immediately requested a new trial upon grounds of jury interference, and Shannon granted the request on February 10. Jury selection proved problematic, occupying at least parts of four terms of the Harrison County Circuit Court. In September 1825, a jury was finally empaneled. The judge, Harry O. Brown, had been temporarily appointed to his position by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. Desha was again found guilty, and sentenced to hang on July 14, 1826. Judge Brown overturned the verdict because the prosecution had not proven that the murder took place in Fleming County, as alleged in the <a href="indictment">indictment</a> against Desha. The state argued that this was of no consequence, since a change of venue had already been granted, but the judge's ruling stood, and Governor Desha's reputation took a further hit.

In July 1826, Isaac Desha, free on <a href="bail">bail</a> while awaiting a third trial and apparently in a highly intoxicated state, attempted suicide by cutting his own throat. Physicians saved his life by reconnecting his severed <a href="Vertebrate%20trachea">windpipe</a> with a silver tube. He recovered, and in June 1827, faced a third trial. During the June term of the court, Desha's lawyers used a number of <a href="peremptory%20challenge">peremptory challenge</a>s to again prevent the court from empaneling a <a href="jury">jury</a>. The judge ordered him held without bail until the next session of the court, but Governor Desha, who was present at the proceedings, stood and issued a pardon for his son, as well as lambasting the judge in a lengthy impromptu speech. Some accounts hold that the governor immediately resigned upon granting the pardon, but the official records reflect no such action.

Following his release, Isaac Desha traveled to <a href="Texas">Texas</a> under an alias, where he robbed and killed another man. He was identified based on family resemblance and the silver pipe that had earlier saved his life. After being arrested, he confessed to both murders. He died of a fever the day before his trial in August 1828.

Another controversial issue during Desha's tenure was his disdain for Horace Holley, president of Transylvania University. From the time Holley assumed the post of president in 1818, the university had risen to national prominence and attracted well-qualified and well-respected faculty members such as <a href="Constantine%20Samuel%20Rafinesque">Constantine Samuel Rafinesque</a>, <a href="Daniel%20Drake">Daniel Drake</a>, <a href="Charles%20Caldwell%20%28physician%29">Charles Caldwell</a>, William T. Barry, and <a href="Jesse%20Bledsoe">Jesse Bledsoe</a>. However, Holley's <a href="New%20England">New England</a> <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> beliefs were too liberal for the tastes of many in Kentucky. Many called Holley an <a href="infidel">infidel</a> and charged that he was a drinker and a gambler. He was criticized for spending time at the horse races and for furnishing his home with <a href="nude%20%28art%29">nude</a> <a href="Classical%20sculpture">classical statues</a>.

Desha was drawn into the Holley controversy during the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201824">1824 presidential election</a>. When no candidate achieved a majority of the electoral votes cast, the contest was resolved by the U.S. House of Representatives. Desha and the New Court partisans in the General Assembly instructed the state's congressional delegation to cast their votes for Andrew Jackson, but the delegation, led by House Speaker Henry Clay, defied these instructions and voted instead for <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a>. Because of this vote, Clay, a trustee for Transylvania and supporter of Holley, became Desha's political enemy. Desha's hostility for Transylvania and Holley worsened when, in the aftermath of the Isaac Desha trial, a student at Transylvania delivered a speech critical of the governor in the university's chapel. Although Holley was present for the speech, Transylvania historian John D. Wright, Jr. wrote that he did not know the student's topic beforehand and after hearing the speech, made no effort to condone its content. It was Holley's practice, however, to allow students to speak openly about current political matters, regardless of which position they took. Desha maintained that, because Holley had not silenced the student, he was at fault for tacitly condoning disrespectful criticism of the state's chief executive.

Desha vehemently attacked Transylvania and Holley in his annual message to the General Assembly in November 1825. He claimed that the university had not made wise use of the public funding allocated to it by previous Assemblies, noting in particular that Holley's salary as president exceeded his own. Finally, Desha claimed that under Holley, Transylvania had become too elitist and could not be otherwise, given the high cost of attendance. Holley, who had traveled to Frankfort to speak with Desha and the legislature, was present for Desha's speech. Afterward, he decided instead to return to Lexington and tender his resignation. Sympathetic members of the university's board of trustees convinced Holley to remain for another year. Kentucky historian <a href="James%20C.%20Klotter">James C. Klotter</a> opined that, with Holley's departure, "perhaps the state's best chance for a world-class university had passed."

The numerous controversies of Desha's term severely damaged his reputation. Harrison recorded that a visitor to Kentucky remarked in 1825, "[Desha] is said by some to possess talents; I have never been furnished with evidence." Harrison further noted that "[b]y 1828, many Kentuckians would have agreed with that assessment."

Desha supported William T. Barry, the Democratic-Republican gubernatorial nominee, to succeed him. Early reports showed Barry leading his opponent, <a href="National%20Republican%20Party">National Republican</a> <a href="Thomas%20Metcalfe%20%28Kentucky%29">Thomas Metcalfe</a>, but the final margin favored Metcalfe. Not only did Desha not agree with Metcalfe politically, he believed that the governorship should go to a high-born aristocrat. Although Metcalfe was the son of a Revolutionary War soldier, his nickname of "Old Stone Hammer" indicated his pride in his trade of <a href="masonry">masonry</a>, which was considered a common profession.

Due to a constitutional quirk, Metcalfe's term was scheduled to begin eight days before the expiration of Desha's. Desha charged that Metcalfe was not allowing him to finish out his term and threatened not to vacate the governor's mansion until his term officially ended. Clark records as legend that, after drinking heavily at a local tavern, Metcalfe and some of his supporters formed a mob and went to the governor's mansion to evict him by force. Accounts in the local newspapers of the time instead record that the Deshas left the mansion peacefully without intervention by Metcalfe.

At the expiration of his term as governor, Desha retired from public life to his farm in Harrison County. During the final years of his life, Desha and his wife Margaret moved to <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Kentucky">Georgetown, Kentucky</a>, where one of his sons, a physician, lived. Desha died at <a href="Payne-Desha%20House">his home</a> in Georgetown, Kentucky, on October 11, 1842, and was buried on the grounds. The state erected a monument over his grave. In 1880, both Desha's body and the monument were moved to <a href="Georgetown%20Cemetery%20%28Georgetown%2C%20Kentucky%29">Georgetown Cemetery</a>.

M-553 (Michigan highway)

M-553 is a north–south <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> in the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper Peninsula</a> (UP) of the US state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. It connects <a href="M-35%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-35</a> near <a href="Gwinn%2C%20Michigan">Gwinn</a> with the Marquette Bypass, an <a href="controlled-access%20highway">expressway</a> carrying <a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20in%20Michigan">US Highway 41</a> (US 41) and <a href="M-28%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-28</a> in <a href="Marquette%2C%20Michigan">Marquette</a>. M-553 connects Marquette with <a href="Sawyer%20International%20Airport">Sawyer International Airport</a> at the <a href="unincorporated%20community">unincorporated community</a> of <a href="K.I.%20Sawyer%20AFB%2C%20Michigan">K.I. Sawyer AFB</a>, the former site of a <a href="US%20Air%20Force">US Air Force</a> base, in the Sands Plains area of Marquette County. The intersection with CR 480 in <a href="Sands%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Sands Township</a>, known locally as the Crossroads, is the site of several businesses. North of this location, M-553 runs through some hilly terrain around a local ski hill.

The trunkline was originally County Road 553 (CR 553) in <a href="Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan">Marquette County</a>. CR 553 dates back to the 1930s, was fully paved in the 1940s, and a segment of the roadway was relocated in the 1950s. During the early 1990s, the City of Marquette extended one of their streets, McClellan Avenue, southward to connect to CR 553. The <a href="county%20road">county road</a> was transferred from the Marquette County Road Commission (MCRC) to the jurisdiction of the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT) on October 1, 1998. MDOT assigned most of the former county road the M-553 designation after the transfer was complete. One section that was less than a mile (about 1.4 km) was given the M-554 designation. This <a href="%23Related%20trunkline">related trunkline</a> was <a href="unsigned%20highway">unsigned by the state</a> with only city street signs to indicate its existence. In 2005, control of various roadways was exchanged between the City of Marquette and MDOT, and M-553 was extended through the city. At the same time, M-554 <a href="decommissioned%20highway">was turned over</a> to the city's jurisdiction.

M-553 begins as a two-lane rural highway east of Gwinn at an intersection with <a href="M-35%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-35</a> in the community of New Swanzy. From there it runs north through some commercial properties into the Sands Plains, a sandy area sparsely covered with <a href="Jack%20Pine">Jack Pine</a>s. The highway runs through an intersection with <a href="M-94%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-94</a> near the west gate of the former <a href="K.%20I.%20Sawyer%20Air%20Force%20Base">K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base</a>. In this area, the trunkline is parallel to a line of the <a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">Canadian National Railway</a> which connects mines of the <a href="Marquette%20Iron%20Range">Marquette Iron Range</a> to <a href="Escanaba%2C%20Michigan">Escanaba</a>. M-553 crosses over the rail line west of the runway at the Sawyer International Airport located at the former Air Force base. On the north side of the airport, M-553 intersects Kelly Johnson Memorial Drive, the airport access road named for <a href="Kelly%20Johnson%20%28engineer%29">Clarence "Kelly" Johnson</a>, who was a noted aviation engineer at <a href="Lockheed%20Corporation">Lockheed</a> who helped design the <a href="Lockheed%20SR-71%20Blackbird">SR-71 "Blackbird"</a> reconnaissance aircraft and member of the International Aerospace Hall of Fame. The trunkline continues farther through woodlands and turns to the northwest. M-553 passes the Marquette County Fairgrounds and reaches CR 480 at the Crossroads area just north of the Sands Plains and the Blueberry Ridge ski trail; the area around the intersection has several businesses.
North of the intersection, M-553 passes some residential subdivisions in the northern end of <a href="Sands%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Sands Township</a>. As the highway continues northward, the landscape transitions into hilly, wooded terrain. The trunkline descends through a series of curves, first to the northwest and then a steep downhill curve, known locally as Glass' Corrner, northeasterly alongside the <a href="Marquette%20Mountain">Marquette Mountain</a> ski area. The highway enters the city of Marquette and runs past the front of the ski resort's chalet before crossing the <a href="Carp%20River%20%28Marquette%20County%29">Carp River</a>. North of the river, the roadway ascends part of the west side of Mount Mesnard before leveling off near the intersection with Division Street. Past that intersection, M-553 follows McClellan Avenue as a four-lane boulevard divided by a <a href="center%20turn%20lane">center turn lane</a> through a residential area on the south side of the city. The trunkline passes between the Superior Hills Elementary School to the east and the Marquette Golf and Country Club to the west. There is a pedestrian bridge over the roadway adjacent to the school, and north of the overpass the center turn lane ends. With few exceptions, the adjacent properties in this area do not have direct access to the highway. M-553 descends one last hill and terminates at a <a href="Michigan%20left">Michigan left</a> intersection with the US 41/M-28 <a href="Limited-access%20road">expressway</a>; McClellan Avenue continues north of the terminus through a business district to a residential area.
Like other state trunkline highways, M-553 is maintained by MDOT. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a>, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that, on average, 3,615 vehicles between the M-35 and M-94 junctions, and 10,021 vehicles north of Division Street, used the highway daily. No section of M-553 is listed on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.

The first roadway along the route of the modern M-553 was a county road; it was first shown on maps by 1936. At the time, the northern half of this county road was "improved", meaning it was gravel or stone, while the southern half was an earthen road. The southern end started in downtown Gwinn at the time. The northern half was paved during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>; a new road was paved immediately east of Gwinn, shifting the road out of town. The remainder of CR 553 was paved by the middle of 1946. At the time, CR 553 ran north from New Swanzy along what is now Marshall Drive to the county airport; the roadway continued north of the airport along the present course except through the Sands area, where it ran to the east, and ended at a terminus on the south side of Marquette at Pioneer Road and Division Street. In 1953, the county road commission relocated CR 553 near the county airport to eliminate a rail crossing and a pair of tight turns.

The county entered into negotiations with the <a href="US%20Air%20Force">US Air Force</a> to lease the county airport for use as an Air Force Base in 1954; a lease was signed on January 24, 1955, and the base was active the next year. In the mid-1960s, the rail line and roadway in the area were moved to go around a section of the runway complex's cargo ramps; this relocation also added a new rail line crossing to CR 553. In 1975, residents of a <a href="trailer%20park">trailer park</a> on Pioneer Road and city officials asked the county road commission to reconfigure the intersection between the county road, Division Street and Pioneer Road to reduce accidents.
In 1976, the MCRC shifted the southern end of CR 553 westward to its current alignment from K.I. Sawyer AFB to New Swanzy so that the road crossed the railroad in a different location, using a bridge instead of the previous <a href="grade%20separation">at-grade crossing</a>. Later in the decade, another section of the roadway was realigned through Sands Township; this segment was moved by 1979 south of the Crossroads area. The southern end of this project was completed by 1981, and the roadway directly angled northwesterly instead of utilizing a long sweeping curve between the road to the south and the new road to the north. Later in 1986, the roadway carrying CR 553 over the <a href="Carp%20River%20%28Marquette%20County%29">Carp River</a> was washed away during spring flooding; the county had to replace the culverts that supported the road with new ones, forcing a temporary road closure. The bridge over the rail line near the Air Force Base had weakened sufficiently by December 1988 that the MCRC had to lower the truck weight limits for the structure from for single-unit trucks and for double- or triple-unit trucks; repairs to the structure were planned for the following year.

The City of Marquette started planning an extension of McClellan Avenue southward to CR 553 in the 1970s. When the projects were started in the 1990s, the goal was to reroute traffic and relieve congestion in town. By April 1994, the street had been extended south from the retail corridor along the business loop north of the Marquette Bypass to the Superior Hills Elementary School. Funding at that time was in place for the extension only as far as Pioneer Road. The last segment between Pioneer Road and CR 553 was held up over environmental clearances and funding; there were some <a href="wetlands">wetlands</a> in the path of the proposed construction. The <a href="United%20States%20Congress">US Congress</a> initially denied funding for the extension in 1993, but they approved funding for this section of the McClellan Avenue project later in 1994 while the environmental assessments were being reviewed. In 1995, a <a href="passing%20lane">passing lane</a> was approved to run uphill southbound approaching Glass' Corner in a project funded by the federal government based on MDOT recommendations.

The city and county continued to improve CR 553 and McClellan Avenue during 1996. The county closed the road between the Carp River and the Crossroads starting in June 1996. During the closure, they built the previously approved passing lane for southbound traffic headed uphill near Marquette Mountain; the project was completed on November 1, 1996. By the end of that month, the city had the necessary environmental approvals and cleared the land needed for the last southward extension of McClellan Avenue; construction crews were working on blasting rock, drainage and other earthworks for the project.
Local business owners near the intersection between McClellan Avenue and the Marquette Bypass petitioned the city and MDOT in November 1996 to reconfigure the intersection, calling it "confusing", "dangerous" and "inconvenient". The intersection was configured as a <a href="Michigan%20left">Michigan left</a> design when McClellan Avenue was extended southward past the expressway in 1994. Transportation planners defended the design, saying that the intersection was actually safer than several others in the city, even if its unique status made it unfamiliar to local drivers. Michigan left intersections are common in the <a href="Lower%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Lower Peninsula</a>, but this intersection was the first in the UP built that way.

In 1993, the federal government announced plans to close <a href="K.%20I.%20Sawyer%20Air%20Force%20Base">K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base</a> in 1995. The after effects of the base closure were the impetus for a December 1996 study by UP counties on the designation of a north–south highway corridor in the region to help fuel redevelopment at the base; the study would help MDOT and the counties prioritize transportation funding. When the local study group completed its report in June 1997, CR 553 was included with M-35 and US 41 as part of the primary north–south traffic corridor in the Central Upper Peninsula. The group cited the redevelopment efforts at the former air force base for the designation. The McClellan Avenue extension was finished the following September, and CR 553 was realigned to flow into the south end of McClellan. Instead of curving to the northeast in the area, the county road turned northward and a T-shaped intersection was built to reconnect CR 553 with the remainder of its routing into South Marquette, requiring the county road to make a right-angle turn.

As part of Governor <a href="John%20Engler">John Engler</a>'s "Build Michigan II" plan in the late 1990s, about of roadway were investigated as potential candidates for state maintenance as part of the Rationalization plan. Included in these queries were county roads 553, 460 and 462; the latter two roadways connected east–west across the former base. Traffic to and from the base was increasing as a byproduct of economic redevelopment at K.I. Sawyer, and if the state took control of the roadways, they would be marked on the state map like other state trunklines, further benefiting redevelopment. Local officials were concerned at the time because at least one proposal included a total of of roads, one-third of the county's primary county road network. The MCRC manager was concerned that such a transfer could impact the level of funding the commission received for the maintenance of the roads that would remain under county jurisdiction.

The three county roads were transferred to state jurisdiction on October 1, 1998. MDOT renumbered the two roads across K.I. Sawyer as an extension of M-94, and designated M-553 along most of CR 553. The latter highway designation then terminated at the southern end of McClellan Avenue in the city of Marquette; the remainder of CR 553 to the intersection with Pioneer Road and Division Street was given the M-554 moniker by the state.

The city and local residents expressed safety issues concerning pedestrians at Marquette Mountain in 2000, and driveways access was consolidated by MDOT in a construction project while a specific pedestrian crossing was installed by the ski hill owner. The Carp River flooded on April 16, 2002, washing out the roadway where M-553 crossed the river. The washout sent "tons of sediment" into the river, impacting the fish habitat before the Central Lake Superior Watershed Partnership could assist MDOT to stabilize the banks. Before the event, the highway had crossed the water body using two , oval metal culverts. The flood waters overwhelmed these culverts and washed away a section of roadway. MDOT budgeted $750,000 (equivalent to $ in ) that May to rebuild the river crossing using a concrete bridge instead.
In April 2005, the City of Marquette initially agreed to exchange jurisdiction over a number of roadways with MDOT. These transfers placed former <a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20Business%20%28Marquette%2C%20Michigan%29">Business US 41</a> (Bus. US 41) and M-554 under city jurisdiction; at the same time, the state would take over a section of McClellan Avenue to extend M-553 to its current northern terminus at the Marquette Bypass. One of the city's requests in negotiating the transfer was to have MDOT defer to city zoning ordinances along McClellan Avenue regarding driveway access and snowmobile access. The transfers were made official on October 11, 2005, and signage was updated on November 9.

Because of the transfer, MDOT initiated a speed study to determine what speed limits should apply on the extension. The McClellan Avenue section of M-553 was placed under a temporary traffic control order leaving the limit in place. A <a href="school%20zone">school zone</a> was considered near the Superior Hills Elementary school. In 2009, the speed limit along McClellan Avenue was raised to . The school zone was implemented in December 2011, reducing the speed limit to for two 40-minute periods during the morning and afternoon. The reduced speed limit is indicated by a set of flashing lights installed in December 2011.

MDOT started construction of a new 20-space commuter parking lot at the southern terminus of M-553 at M-35 on August 11, 2008, as part of an effort to offer expanded ride-sharing opportunities in Marquette County. Another carpool lot was added at the Crossroads when MDOT partnered with the restaurant there. The state paved the gravel parking lot, and the business allowed the installation of signs.

In 2012, MDOT identified a section of M-553 known as Glass' Corner as one of the more dangerous stretches of highway in the state. Short sight distances and the end of a southbound uphill passing lane immediately before the curve have resulted in serious accidents. In the short term, the department announced additional signage to warn motorists approaching this section. An audit also recommended the installation of street lighting by Sands Township. Another intermediate-term proposal is to reduce the speed limit from , an action that would require the involvement of the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Police">Michigan State Police</a>. MDOT is seeking funding for a project to straighten some of the curves and decrease the roadway's grade. Work was expected to cost $5 million and be completed by 2017 at the time. No progress at funding the Glass' Corner project has been made, and it is not listed in MDOT's 2016–2021 five-year transportation plan nor the draft for the 2017–2022 plan.

M-554 was a short <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> in the city of <a href="Marquette%2C%20Michigan">Marquette</a> that follows what is now a part of Division Street. The southern terminus was at the intersection with M-553 and McClellan Avenue. From there, the highway ran just under a mile (1.4 km) within Marquette in a tree-lined section of the city that is relatively flat; the roadway that carried the M-554 designation has a few gentle curves. At the intersection with Pioneer Road and Division Street, the M-554 designation ended, and the roadway continued as Division Street. The only signage present along the route to indicate the highway number was the street signs erected by the City of Marquette Department of Public Works; MDOT never posted the standard <a href="reassurance%20marker">reassurance marker</a>s along the road, leaving M-554 as an <a href="unsigned%20highway">unsigned highway</a>, although at least one map manufacturer included the highway on its maps.

When CR 553 was transferred from the county to the state on October 1, 1998, one segment was not included in the routing for M-553; that section between the McClellan Avenue and Pioneer Road intersections was numbered M-554 by MDOT. The City of Marquette approved a plan to accept jurisdiction of M-554 from MDOT in April 2005; the plan also affected two other roads (<a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20Business%20%28Marquette%2C%20Michigan%29">Bus. US 41</a> and M-553). On October 10, 2005, the city and the state exchanged jurisdiction of the three roadways in Marquette. The signage was changed on November 9, 2005, reflecting the changeover of M-554 and Bus. US 41 to the city's control and McClellan Avenue to the state's control. This change ended the existence of M-554. Since the transfer, the former M-554 is now part of an extended Division Street.

It was built from 1928 to 1930 as the corporate headquarters of the <a href="IG%20Farben">IG Farben</a> conglomerate, then the world's largest chemical company and the world's fourth-largest company overall.

The building's original design in the <a href="Modern%20architecture">modernist</a> <a href="New%20Objectivity">New Objectivity</a> style was the subject of a competition which was eventually won by the architect <a href="Hans%20Poelzig">Hans Poelzig</a>. On its completion, the complex was the <a href="List%20of%20largest%20buildings%20in%20the%20world">largest office building</a> in Europe and remained so until the 1950s. The IG Farben Building's six square wings retain a modern, spare elegance, despite its mammoth size. It is also notable for its <a href="paternoster">paternoster</a> elevators.

The building was the headquarters for production administration of <a href="dye">dye</a>s, <a href="pharmaceutical%20drug">pharmaceutical drug</a>s, <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, lubricating oil, explosives, and <a href="methanol">methanol</a>, and for research projects relating to the development of <a href="synthetic%20oil">synthetic oil</a> and <a href="synthetic%20rubber">rubber</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Notably IG Farben scientists discovered the first <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>, fundamentally reformed medical research and "opened a new era in medicine." After World War II, the IG Farben Building served as the headquarters for the <a href="Supreme%20Allied%20Commander">Supreme Allied Command</a> and from 1949 to 1952 the High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG). Notably <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> had his office in the building. It became the principal location for implementing the <a href="Marshall%20Plan">Marshall Plan</a>, which supported the post-war reconstruction of Europe. The 1948 <a href="Frankfurt%20Documents">Frankfurt Documents</a>, which led to the creation of a <a href="West%20Germany">West German</a> state allied with the western powers, were signed in the building. The IG Farben Building served as the headquarters for the <a href="U.S.%20V%20Corps">US Army's V Corps</a> and the Northern Area Command (NACOM) until 1995. It was also the headquarters of the <a href="CIA">CIA</a> in Germany. During the early Cold War, it was referred to by US authorities as the Headquarters Building, United States Army Europe (USAREUR); the US Army renamed the building the General <a href="Creighton%20W.%20Abrams">Creighton W. Abrams</a> Building in 1975. It was informally referred to as "<a href="The%20Pentagon">The Pentagon</a> of Europe."

In 1995, the US Army transferred the IG Farben Building to the German government, and it was purchased by the state of <a href="Hesse">Hesse</a> on behalf of the <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20Goethe%20University%20of%20Frankfurt%20am%20Main">University of Frankfurt</a>. Renamed the Poelzig Building in honour of its architect, the building underwent a restoration and was opened as part of the university in 2001. It is the central building of the West End Campus of the university, which also includes over a dozen other buildings built after 2001.

The IG Farben Building was developed on land known as the Grüneburggelände. In 1837, the property belonged to the <a href="Mayer%20Amschel%20Rothschild%20family">Rothschild</a> family. It was part of the "Affensteiner Feld", an area in the north of today's <a href="Westend%20%28Frankfurt%20am%20Main%29">Frankfurt Westend District</a>. The name Affenstein derives from an ancient Christian memorial that once stood here on the road outside Frankfurt. It was known as the "Avestein" as in Ave Maria but in the local Frankfurt dialect it was called the "Affe Stein". 
In 1864, the city's <a href="psychiatric%20hospital">psychiatric hospital</a> was erected on the site. Here, Dr <a href="Heinrich%20Hoffmann%20%28author%29">Heinrich Hoffman</a> hired <a href="Alois%20Alzheimer">Alois Alzheimer</a> to work in the hospital, where they both explored progressive methods of treating the mentally ill. The <a href="Gr%C3%BCneburgpark">Grüneburgpark</a> was established in 1880 on the larger western part of the site.

<a href="IG%20Farben">IG Farben</a> acquired the property in 1927 to establish its headquarters there. In the 1920s, IG Farben (full German name "Interessen Gemeinschaft Farbenindustrie Aktiengesellschaft") was the world's largest drug, chemical and dye conglomerate. Frankfurt was chosen because of its centrality and its accessibility by air and land.

In August 1928, Professor <a href="Hans%20Poelzig">Hans Poelzig</a> won a limited competition to design the building, among five selected architects, notably beating <a href="Ernst%20May">Ernst May</a>, the then Head of Urban Design for Frankfurt.

Work on the foundations began in late 1928, and in mid-1929 construction started on the steel frame. The building was completed in 1930 after only 24 months, by employing rapid-setting concrete, new construction materials and a round-the-clock workforce. Later in 1930, the Frankfurt director of horticulture <a href="Max%20Bromme">Max Bromme</a> and the artists' group <a href="Bornimer%20Kreis">Bornimer Kreis</a> developed designs for the 14 hectares of parkland that surrounded the building. The grounds, and the complex as a whole, were completed in 1931 at a total cost of 24 million <a href="Reichsmark">Reichsmark</a> (equivalent to million €).

After completion, the building was the headquarters of IG Farben for 15 years. IG Farben was an indispensable part of the German industrial base from its establishment in 1925, and the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical company. Although IG Farben had been reviled on the far right and accused of being an "international capitalist Jewish company", the company nonetheless remained a large government contractor under Nazi Party rule.

During World War II, the surrounding neighbourhood was devastated, but the building itself was left largely intact (and inhabited by the homeless citizens of a <a href="Bombing%20of%20Frankfurt%20am%20Main%20in%20World%20War%20II">bomb-ravaged Frankfurt</a>). In March 1945, Allied troops occupied the area and the IG Farben Building became the American headquarters of General <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>. Eisenhower's office was where he received many important guests; including <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">General de Gaulle</a>, <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Montgomery%20of%20Alamein">Field Marshal Montgomery</a> and <a href="Georgy%20Zhukov">Marshal Zhukov</a>. It was there that he signed the "Proclamation No. 2", which determined which parts of the country would be within the <a href="Allied%20Occupation%20Zones%20in%20Germany">American zone</a>. Eisenhower vacated the building in December 1945 but his office was still used for special occasions: the <a href="constitution%20of%20Hesse">constitution of the state of Hesse</a> was signed there, the West German <a href="Ministerpr%C3%A4sident">Ministerpräsident</a> received his commission to compile the "Grundgesetz" (<a href="Basic%20Law%20for%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany">German constitution</a>) and the administration of the "Wirtschaftsrat der Bizone" (Economic Council of the <a href="Bizone">Bizone</a>) was also located there.

From 1945 to 1947, the IG Farben Building was the location of the Supreme Headquarters, Allied European Forces, and was the headquarters for the US occupation forces and <a href="Military%20Governor%20of%20the%20U.S.%20Occupation%20Zone%20in%20Germany">Military Governor</a>. On May 10, 1947, permanent orders to military personnel prohibited further reference to the building as the "IG Farben Building", and instead called for it to be referred to as "The Headquarters Building, European Command". The United States High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG) and his staff occupied the building from 1949 to 1952.

After 1952, the building served as the European centre of the American armed forces and the headquarters of the <a href="U.S.%20V%20Corps">U.S. V Corps</a>. It later became the headquarters for the Northern Area Command until 1994. The IG Farben Building was also the headquarters of the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</a> in Germany, which led to its sobriquet 'the Pentagon of Europe'. On April 16, 1975, the US Army renamed the building the General Creighton W. Abrams Building. The renaming did not have full authority in law, because the US was technically leasing the building from the German government and thus was not the rightful owner.

On May 11, 1972, three bombs were set off by the West German terrorist group "Rote Armee Fraktion" (Red Army Faction, i.e., the <a href="Baader-Meinhof%20Group">Baader-Meinhof Group</a>). Two bombs went off in a rotunda in the rear entrance of the IG Farben building, and a third exploded in a smaller building behind the IG Farben building that was serving as the US Military's officer's club. Lt. Col. Paul Bloomquist was killed by the last bomb, and dozens of Americans and Germans were injured. The IG Farben building was attacked again by the same group in 1976 and 1982. Consequently, the publicly accessible adjoining park became part of a restricted military zone which also included the military living quarters and work areas at the rear of the building.

Following <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a>, the US government announced plans to fully withdraw its troops from Frankfurt, Germany by 1995, at which time control of the entire site would be restored to the German Federal Government. It was suggested that the building could become the location for the <a href="European%20Central%20Bank">European Central Bank</a>. In 1996, the state of Hesse bought the building and associated land for the <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20Goethe%20University%20of%20Frankfurt%20am%20Main">University of Frankfurt</a>. The buildings were refurbished at a cost of 50 Million German Mark (about US $26M or 25M €), by the <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>-based architecture practice <a href="Dissing%2BWeitling">Dissing+Weitling</a> and were handed over to the university. The complex now houses the Westend Campus of the university, which includes the departments of Philosophy, History, Theology, Classical Philology, Art and Music, Modern Languages and Linguistics, Cultural and Civilization Studies, the Center for North American Studies and the Fritz-Bauer-Institute.

Even in 1995 the association of the building with Nazism had been hard to shake off, despite its outstanding 1920s architecture. "<a href="Der%20Spiegel">Der Spiegel</a>" wrote about the "Smell of Guilt" after its public opening in 1995, but also that the building itself did not deserve the bad reputation. Only with the departure of the Americans, the subsequent renovations, and the use of the building by the university has the building's association with the Third Reich in the popular consciousness receded.

The university's tenancy of the building sparked a debate regarding the name of the building. Former University President Werner Meissner had started the controversy by proposing to name it the "Poelzig-Ensemble" "(Poelzig-Complex)". Members of the university insisted on confronting the building's history by retaining its original name, the "IG Farben Building".
Meissner's successor, <a href="Rudolf%20Steinberg">Rudolf Steinberg</a>, upheld the decision to retain the name, but he did not enforce a uniform nomenclature within the university's administration. The university's senate finally settled the discussions in July 2014 by keeping the official name "I.G.-Farbenhaus" (IG Farben Building).

By 2004 the university set up a permanent exhibition inside the building, and a memorial <a href="IG%20Farben%20Building%23Text%20of%20memorial%20plaque">plaque</a>—for the <a href="Slave%20labor">slave labourers</a> of IG Farben and those who had perished by Zyklon B gas—was installed on the front of the building. After 10 years of debate the Senate of the University agreed in 2014 to name a place on the new campus's southern end after the former slave labourer <a href="Norbert%20Wollheim">Norbert Wollheim</a>.

Behind the IG Farben Building, the state of Hessen intends to build "Europe's most modern campus" to accommodate the remaining departments of the University's old Bockenheim campus, law, business, social sciences, child development, and the arts.
As of 2018, there are several new buildings finished. Construction of the students' union building and of the faculty building for linguistics, cultures, and arts has begun. The last step to complete the new university campus will be the relocation of the main library within the 2020s.

In 1928, IG Farben was the world's fourth-largest company and its largest chemical company. Consequently, the space requirements for the building were for one of the largest office buildings ever constructed. It was designed in the "<a href="New%20Objectivity%20%28architecture%29">New Objectivity</a>" style.

IG Farben did not want a specifically '<a href="Bauhaus">Bauhaus</a>' styled building—it wanted:

The 250-metre long and 35-metre tall building has nine floors, but the height of the ground floor varies (4.6–4.2 m). This variation is reflected in the roof line which looks taller at the wings than the spine. The volume of the building is 280,000 m³, constructed from 4,600 tonnes of <a href="steel%20frame">steel frame</a> with brick infill and floors constructed of hollow blocks to provide over 55740 m² of usable office space". The façade is clad with 33,000 m² <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt</a> <a href="Travertine">Travertine</a> marble, punctuated in bands of windows decreasing in height with each storey. Only at the corners are the glazed strips interrupted for emphasis. The top storey is lit from skylights rather than banded glazing and has a very low ceiling height. It forms a clear building conclusion. In the mid-'50s, this upper storey housed a military affiliate radio station (MARS). Until the 1950s, the building was the largest and most modern office building in Europe.

The IG Farben Building consists of six wings, connected by a gently curved, central corridor. This arrangement provides all of the offices with sufficient natural light and ventilation. This design approach for large complexes offers an alternative to the "hollow rectangle" schemes of the time, with their typical inner courtyards. The prototype of this form is the <a href="Cadillac%20Place">General Motors Building</a> in <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> (1917–21) by <a href="Albert%20Kahn%20%28architect%29">Albert Kahn</a>. The building presents a very large and weighty façade to the front, but this effect is reduced by the concave form.

The main entrance is at the axial centre of the building, comprising a temple-like <a href="portico">portico</a> standing in front of the doors—a relatively common motif of administration buildings of the time. The entrance arrangement is regarded by some people as slightly pompous: the entrance and lift doors are of bronze, and the ceiling and walls of the porch are clad in bronze plate and copper <a href="frieze">frieze</a>s. The inner lobby has two curved staircases with a sheet aluminum treatment, and marble walls with a zigzag pattern. The axial centre at the rear of the building has a round glazed façade; here, the view of the buildings at the rear of the site (the "casino") is maximised by the curved walls that afford vistas to the subsidiary buildings 100 m distant, separated from the main building by parkland and a pool. During the American occupation of the building, this rotunda housed a small kiosk; later, it was used as a conference room. Nowadays, it is called the <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> room and accommodates a café.

The <a href="paternoster%20lift">paternoster lift</a>s that serve the nine floors are famous, and are popular with the university students. After the recent restoration, the university has pledged to preserve them in perpetuity.

Behind the rotunda is an oblong pool with a "Nymphenskulptur" (German:Nymph sculpture) at the water's edge created by <a href="Fritz%20Klimsch">Fritz Klimsch</a> entitled "Am Wasser". Behind it stands a flat building on a hill with a terrace—the casino of IG Farben and the Officers Club of the US Army ("The Terrace Club"), which now houses a refectory and lecture-rooms.

A number of unconfirmed rumours concern the complex:

December to Dismember (2006)

December to Dismember (2006) was a <a href="professional%20wrestling">professional wrestling</a> <a href="pay-per-view">pay-per-view</a> (PPV) <a href="List%20of%20WWE%20pay-per-view%20events">event</a> produced by <a href="WWE">World Wrestling Entertainment</a> (WWE), which took place on December 3, 2006, at the <a href="James%20Brown%20Arena">James Brown Arena</a> in <a href="Augusta%2C%20Georgia">Augusta, Georgia</a>. Professional wrestling is a type of <a href="sports%20entertainment">sports entertainment</a> in which theatrical events are combined with a competitive sport. The buildup to the matches and the scenarios that took place before, during, and after the event, were planned by WWE's <a href="List%20of%20World%20Wrestling%20Entertainment%20employees%23Creative%20writers">script writers</a>. The event starred <a href="List%20of%20World%20Wrestling%20Entertainment%20employees">wrestlers</a> from the <a href="ECW%20%28WWE%20brand%29">ECW</a> <a href="WWE%20Brand%20Extension">brand</a>: storyline expansions of the promotion where employees are assigned to wrestling brands under the WWE banner. Despite it being an ECW brand pay-per-view, wrestlers from the <a href="Raw%20%28WWE%20brand%29">Raw</a> and <a href="SmackDown%20%28WWE%20brand%29">SmackDown!</a> brands also worked on the pay-per-view. Its name was derived from the <a href="December%20to%20Dismember%20%281995%29">December to Dismember</a> event held by the original <a href="Extreme%20Championship%20Wrestling">Extreme Championship Wrestling</a> in 1995.

The <a href="Main%20event">main attraction</a> on the event <a href="Card%20%28sports%29">card</a> was an Extreme <a href="Elimination%20Chamber">Elimination Chamber</a> match for the <a href="ECW%20Championship">ECW World Championship</a>. It featured wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by a steel structure of chain and girders. The six participants were defending champion <a href="Big%20Show">Big Show</a>, <a href="Bobby%20Lashley">Bobby Lashley</a>, <a href="Rob%20Van%20Dam">Rob Van Dam</a>, <a href="Bob%20Holly">Hardcore Holly</a>, <a href="CM%20Punk">CM Punk</a> and <a href="Test%20%28wrestler%29">Test</a>. Lashley won the match and the ECW World Championship after <a href="Pin%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">pinning</a> Big Show following a <a href="Spear%20%28wrestling%29">spear</a>. The featured bout on the <a href="Card%20%28sports%29">undercard</a> was a <a href="tag%20team">tag team</a> bout between <a href="Hardy%20Boyz">The Hardys</a> (real-life brothers <a href="Matt%20Hardy">Matt</a> and <a href="Jeff%20Hardy">Jeff</a>) and <a href="MNM%20%28wrestling%29">MNM</a> (<a href="Adam%20Birch">Joey Mercury</a> and <a href="John%20Morrison%20%28wrestler%29">Johnny Nitro</a>), in which The Hardys were victorious.

The event had an attendance of 4,800 and received about 90,000 pay-per-view buys, with 55,000 of them domestic buys—the lowest buyrate in WWE history until the introduction of the <a href="WWE%20Network">WWE Network</a> in 2014. Although it was scheduled to be held again in 2007, the show was canceled after all pay-per-view events became tri-branded, which meant that there would be pay-per-view events with the entire roster on two consecutive weeks.

Outside of the weekly "<a href="ECW%20on%20Syfy">ECW on Sci Fi</a>" broadcast, one of WWE's primary television programs, the pay-per-view received little buildup on both "<a href="WWE%20Raw">Raw</a>" and "<a href="WWE%20SmackDown">SmackDown!</a>" television shows, as WWE concentrated more on advertising the <a href="Survivor%20Series%20%282006%29">Survivor Series</a> pay-per-view that aired one week prior to December to Dismember. At this time, the main storyline on the Raw <a href="WWE%20Brand%20Extension">brand</a> featured <a href="tag%20team">tag team</a>s, <a href="D-Generation%20X">D-Generation X</a> and <a href="Rated-RKO">Rated-RKO</a>, and the SmackDown! brand's main storyline featured <a href="Dave%20Batista">Batista</a> and <a href="World%20Heavyweight%20Championship%20%28WWE%29">World Heavyweight Champion</a> <a href="Booker%20Huffman">King Booker</a>. The buildup for December to Dismember began in the middle of October. (six weeks before the event occurred) This was the only ECW brand exclusive pay-per-view WWE produced before the decision was made to have all three brands featured on future pay-per-views .

The <a href="Card%20%28sports%29">main event</a> at December to Dismember featured an <a href="Elimination%20Chamber">Extreme Elimination Chamber match</a> for the ECW Championship. On the October 24, 2006 episode of "ECW", Rob Van Dam defeated the <a href="ECW%20Championship">ECW World Champion</a>, Big Show for the second consecutive time. Per the stipulation, if Van Dam were to defeat the Big Show again, in a <a href="ladder%20match">ladder match</a>, he could then choose a time to face the Big Show for the ECW Championship. Van Dam chose to have his title shot at the December to Dismember pay-per-view. Authority figure, <a href="Paul%20Heyman">Paul Heyman</a>, authorized Van Dam's decision and added him to the Extreme Elimination Chamber contest for the ECW Championship along with Big Show and four other ECW superstars. The remaining four participants for the Extreme Elimination Chamber match were decided through standard singles matches. The first person to qualify for the match was <a href="Sabu%20%28wrestler%29">Sabu</a>, who defeated <a href="Kevin%20Fertig">Kevin Thorn</a> on the October 31, 2006 episode of "ECW". The following week, CM Punk and Test qualified by defeating <a href="Mike%20Knox">Mike Knox</a> and <a href="Tommy%20Dreamer">Tommy Dreamer</a>, respectively. The final place was to be given to <a href="Hardcore%20Holly">Hardcore Holly</a> in a contract signing segment on the November 14, 2006 episode of "ECW". As Holly was making his way to the ring, <a href="Bobby%20Lashley">Bobby Lashley</a>, a wrestler from the SmackDown! brand, attacked Holly and signed his contract himself to gain the sixth and final place in the Extreme Elimination Chamber. Although the six spots in the bout were filled, Heyman announced a <a href="Hardcore%20wrestling">Extreme Rules</a> match, between Van Dam and Holly, on the November 21, 2006 episode of "ECW". If Holly were to defeat Van Dam he would take his place in the Extreme Elimination Chamber; Van Dam however, won the match and cemented his place in the Extreme Elimination Chamber. Van Dam continued gaining momentum going into December to Dismember pay-per-view, as he, along with team members Sabu, Lashley, <a href="John%20Cena">John Cena</a> and <a href="Glenn%20Jacobs">Kane</a> defeated the team of Big Show, Test, <a href="Eddie%20Fatu">Umaga</a>, <a href="Dave%20Finlay">Finlay</a> and <a href="Montel%20Vontavious%20Porter">Montel Vontavious Porter</a> in a 5-on-5, elimination tag team match, at the Survivor Series pay-per-view. On the final episode of "ECW", before December to Dismember, Van Dam defeated Sabu. Later in the show, CM Punk faced Test, but both men were counted out in their bout. In the main event, Big Show was disqualified in his match against Lashley as Test and Heyman's <a href="Basham%20Brothers%23ECW%20%282006-2007%29">Security Force</a> (<a href="Doug%20Basham">Doug</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Hollie">Danny Basham</a>) assaulted Lashley.
The other main rivalry heading into December to Dismember was between the <a href="Hardy%20Boyz">Hardy Boyz</a> and <a href="MNM%20%28wrestling%29">MNM</a> (Joey Mercury, Johnny Nitro and <a href="Melina%20Perez">Melina</a>). Unlike the Extreme Elimination Chamber rivalry, this one did not include <a href="List%20of%20ECW%20%28WWE%29%20alumni">ECW superstars</a> and only featured members of the Raw and SmackDown! brands, making the pay-per-view non-exclusive to ECW, spanning all three WWE brands. The buildup to the match between them began when Nitro and <a href="Jeff%20Hardy">Jeff Hardy</a> started to feud over the <a href="WWE%20Intercontinental%20Championship">Intercontinental Championship</a> on "Raw". The two competed in several different types of matches, including a ladder match. The Hardy Boyz had just teamed up for the first time since 2002, when they defeated <a href="Tony%20Mamaluke">Tony Mamaluke</a> and <a href="James%20Maritato">Little Guido Maritato</a> on an episode of "ECW". At Survivor Series, The Hardy Boyz, along with D-Generation X and CM Punk defeated the team of Nitro, Rated-RKO (<a href="Edge%20%28wrestler%29">Edge</a> and <a href="Randy%20Orton">Randy Orton</a>), Mike Knox and <a href="Gregory%20Helms">Gregory Helms</a> in a traditional Survivor Series team elimination match. The next day at the December to Dismember <a href="News%20conference">press conference</a>, The Hardy Boyz announced an open challenge for the pay-per-view. Later that night on "Raw", Nitro accepted the challenge, announcing the return of Mercury and the "one night only" reformation of MNM. On the following episode of "ECW", MNM attacked The Hardy Boyz after they defeated <a href="Elijah%20Burke">Elijah Burke</a> and <a href="Sylvester%20Terkay">Sylvester Terkay</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="New%20Age%20Outlaws%23Voodoo%20Kin%20Mafia%20%282006%E2%80%932008%29">Voodoo Kin Mafia</a>, a tag team from the <a href="Total%20Nonstop%20Action%20Wrestling">Total Nonstop Action Wrestling</a> (TNA) <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20promotion">promotion</a>, issued a statement via the TNA website stating that they had accepted The Hardy Boyz open challenge for December to Dismember. However, Voodoo Kin Mafia did not turn up at the event, and WWE never acknowledged their challenge. Only two matches were officially announced for the pay-per-view before it aired.

Before the event went live on pay-per-view, <a href="Stevie%20Richards">Stevie Richards</a> defeated <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Goguen">René Duprée</a> in a <a href="dark%20match">dark match</a>, a non-televised match used to generate excitement in the crowd.

The first match that aired was the tag team encounter between MNM and The Hardy Boyz. After a back and forth match, which lasted over 20 minutes, MNM performed a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20double-team%20maneuvers%23Flapjack%20DDT">flapjack DDT</a> on Jeff. During a <a href="Pin%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">pinfall</a> attempt, <a href="Matt%20Hardy">Matt Hardy</a> made the save and performed a <a href="Neckbreaker">double neckbreaker</a> on both members of MNM. Jeff then <a href="Swanton%20bomb">Swanton bomb</a>ed Nitro and made the winning pin. 

Next was <a href="Matt%20Striker">Matt Striker</a> versus <a href="Balls%20Mahoney">Balls Mahoney</a> in a "Striker's Rules" match, a match with "no gouging of the eyes, no pulling of the hair, no maneuvers off the top rope and, most importantly, no foul language". Mahoney won the match after he performed a <a href="spinebuster">spinebuster</a> and pinned Striker for the victory.
After the match between Balls Mahoney and Matt Striker, Sabu was depicted as being injured backstage and unable to compete in the Extreme Elimination Chamber match. In reality, however, it was rumored that Sabu had animosity surrounding him backstage and was said to be uninterested at television tapings. Rumors evolved stating that WWE viewed Sabu as being "useless" in normal matches and that he could only perform in matches that included "stunts and tables and they [WWE] don't respect him because of that". This was reportedly part of the reason he had been scripted to be easily defeated by Umaga on an episode of "Raw" a few weeks earlier. WWE chairman <a href="Vince%20McMahon">Vince McMahon</a> wanted to put Holly in Sabu's place, so Lashley would have more villains to overcome. Heyman was legitimately unhappy with the decision, saying that Sabu's high-flying wrestling would be "the ideal showcase" inside the Extreme Elimination Chamber. The fans inside the James Brown Arena chanted "bullshit" during the segment.

In the second tag-team match of the night, <a href="Elijah%20Burke">Elijah Burke</a> and Sylvester Terkay defeated <a href="The%20Full%20Blooded%20Italians">F.B.I.</a> members Little Guido Maritato and Tony Mamaluke. Burke pinned Mamaluke after performing a <a href="The%20Stroke%20%28wrestling%20maneuver%29">Forward Russian legsweep</a> on him and gaining the pinfall. After the match, Terkay performed a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20throws%23Muscle%20buster">Muscle Buster</a> on Maritato. During this match, the fans inside the James Brown Arena chanted "<a href="Total%20Nonstop%20Action%20Wrestling">TNA, TNA</a>" (a reference to WWE's rival professional wrestling promotion, as well as two of their performers utilizing moves used by TNA wrestlers, <a href="Jeff%20Jarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a> and <a href="Samoa%20Joe">Samoa Joe</a>, respectively).

A standard match between <a href="Shawn%20Daivari">Daivari</a> and Tommy Dreamer followed with <a href="The%20Great%20Khali">The Great Khali</a> accompanying Daivari to the ring but was ejected from ringside early on for interfering. After Daivari won the match using a <a href="Pin%20%28professional%20wrestling%29%23Roll-up">roll-up</a>, Khali came back out to the ring and gave Dreamer a <a href="Two-handed%20chokeslam">chokebomb</a>. <a href="Emergency%20medical%20technician">EMTs</a> came out to help Dreamer get up, but he ended up getting up on his own and headed backstage.

The next match of the night was an <a href="Mixed%20tag%20team%20match">intergender tag team match</a>, with Kevin Thorn and <a href="Shelly%20Martinez">Ariel</a> against Mike Knox and <a href="Kelly%20Kelly">Kelly Kelly</a>. Before the match began, Kelly Kelly was shown wishing CM Punk, her on-screen crush, luck for the main event. The end of the match came when Knox abandoned Kelly Kelly in the ring and Ariel performed a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Legsweep">legsweep</a>, a variation of a takedown, on Kelly Kelly before covering her for the win. Following the match, Ariel and Thorn attempted to attack Kelly Kelly, before <a href="The%20Sandman%20%28wrestler%29">The Sandman</a> interrupted and hit Thorn repeatedly with a <a href="Shinai">kendo stick</a>.

The main event was the Extreme Elimination Chamber for the ECW World Championship. After a segment earlier in the event showed an injured Sabu was unable to compete in the match, it was decided that Hardcore Holly would take his spot in the ECW Championship match. Before the match began, Paul Heyman announced the rules of the match and explained that each superstar had a weapon with them in each of their pods. Before entering the ring, Heyman had a conversation backstage with Big Show, that was unseen by television viewers, with him revealing that for the first time in his professional career he was not motivated to give the promo. Rob Van Dam and Hardcore Holly were the first superstars to begin the match and one of the other four competitors were then released from their pod every five minutes afterward. The first person to be released from his pod was CM Punk, who entered the match with a steel chair in hand. Test then followed, five minutes after him, with a <a href="Crowbar%20%28tool%29">crowbar</a>. Punk was the first eliminated from the match, after Van Dam performed a <a href="Frog%20splash">Five Star Frog Splash</a> from the top <a href="turnbuckle">turnbuckle</a> and covered him for the 3-count. Moments later, Test charged and delivered a <a href="big%20boot">big boot</a> to Holly, eliminating him. Van Dam was the third person eliminated, after Test delivered a <a href="diving%20elbow%20drop">diving elbow drop</a> from the top of a pod and pinned him. When it was Bobby Lashley's turn, his pod wouldn't open, he could not exit it because Heyman's Security Force had bolted the door shut. Lashley then used the table that was with him to smash through the pod, allowing him to escape. He then delivered a <a href="Spear%20%28wrestling%29">spear</a> to Test to eliminate him. Big Show, was the final man to exit his pod and had a <a href="baseball%20bat">baseball bat</a> wrapped in <a href="barbed%20wire">barbed wire</a> in tow. Lashley was able to block Big Show's swing of the barbed wire bat with a folding chair and then threw him into the pod, causing him to bleed. Lashley managed to reverse a <a href="chokeslam">chokeslam</a> into a <a href="DDT%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">DDT</a> and then delivered a spear to win the match and become the new ECW Champion.

Not long after December to Dismember, Big Show was offered a long-term contract extension by WWE, reported to be around <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>1 million a year. He declined the offer, however, reasoning he was burned out and hurting physically. On the first episode of "ECW" to air after December to Dismember, Show and Lashley would compete in a rematch for the ECW Championship. The Big Show lost, thus ending their storyline feud, and he announced his retirement from wrestling, although he made his return in 2008 at <a href="No%20Way%20Out%20%282008%29">No Way Out</a>.

After the storyline feud with Big Show ended, Lashley entered a short program with Rob Van Dam, which led to Van Dam earning a title match on the January 2, 2007 episode of "ECW". The match between the two ended in a No Contest after Test interfered during the bout. Test's interference led to a storyline with the champion, leading to a title match at the <a href="Royal%20Rumble%20%282007%29">Royal Rumble</a>, which Lashley won.

Less than 24 hours after the <a href="pay-per-view">pay-per-view</a>, WWE announced on their official website that Vince McMahon had sent Heyman home, citing "slumping television ratings and a disgruntled talent roster as causes for Mr. Heyman's dismissal". Heyman and McMahon clashed on the plane to the <a href="North%20Charleston%20Coliseum">North Charleston Coliseum</a> and after a producers' meeting, Heyman was escorted from the Coliseum and sent home. He was also immediately pulled from ECW's <a href="List%20of%20World%20Wrestling%20Entertainment%20employees%23Creative%20writers">creative team</a> after the altercation. McMahon was attempting to put the blame on Heyman for the poorly received pay-per-view, and after a meeting with Vince and <a href="Stephanie%20McMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a>, Heyman <a href="Legit%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">legitimately</a> left World Wrestling Entertainment but remained under contract. Heyman was against the decision of Lashley being <a href="Booking%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">booked</a> to win the ECW Championship, and instead wanted to have CM Punk win it, a decision McMahon disliked. This situation was cited by Punk in <a href="CM%20Punk%23WWE%20Champion%20.282011.E2.80.932013.29">his controversial shoot promo in 2011</a>, in which he referred to the idea as one in which "Heyman saw something in Punk that nobody else wanted to admit." In an early 2008 interview with "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>", Heyman gave more details on how he would have booked the Extreme Elimination Chamber main-event, which included having Punk enter first and quickly eliminating Big Show via submission. According to the interview, McMahon nixed the idea, but Big Show liked the direction Heyman was heading, and was eager for the opportunity to "make" a rising star like Punk. He also stated that he kept going to McMahon on the night of the pay-per-view to say that "The people are going to throw this back in our face". Upset at how the event turned out, Tommy Dreamer and Stevie Richards both asked after the event to be released from their contracts. Both requests were refused by McMahon and WWE's Vice President of Talent Relations <a href="John%20Laurinaitis">John Laurinaitis</a>.

Critics had a negative reaction to the pay-per-view, with the only match that received praise being the Hardy Boyz versus MNM tag team match. <a href="Canadian%20Online%20Explorer">Slam! Sports</a> rated the pay-per-view 4 out of 10 stars, stating, "the two matches that were promoted saved this thing from being a debacle". In the 2006 <a href="List%20of%20Wrestling%20Observer%20Newsletter%20awards">Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards</a>, the event was voted the "worst major wrestling show of the year".

Buckton Castle

Buckton Castle was a <a href="medieval">medieval</a> <a href="enclosure%20castle">enclosure castle</a> near <a href="Carrbrook">Carrbrook</a> in <a href="Stalybridge">Stalybridge</a>, <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>, England. It was surrounded by a stone <a href="curtain%20wall%20%28fortification%29">curtain wall</a> and a ditch wide by deep. Buckton is one of the earliest stone castles in North West England and only survives as buried remains overgrown with heather and peat. It was most likely built and demolished in the 12th century. The earliest surviving record of the site dates from 1360, by which time it was lying derelict. The few finds retrieved during archaeological investigations indicate that Buckton Castle may not have been completed.

In the 16th century, the site may have been used as a beacon for the <a href="Pilgrimage%20of%20Grace">Pilgrimage of Grace</a>. During the 18th century, the castle was of interest to treasure hunters following rumours that gold and silver had been discovered at Buckton. The site was used as an anti-aircraft decoy site during the Second World War. Between 1996 and 2010, Buckton Castle was investigated by archaeologists as part of the Tameside Archaeology Survey, first by the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit then the University of Salford's Centre for Applied Archaeology. The project involved <a href="community%20archaeology%23Community%20archaeology%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">community archaeology</a>, and more than 60 volunteers took part. The castle, close to the Buckton Vale Quarry, is a <a href="Scheduled%20Monuments%20in%20Greater%20Manchester">Scheduled Ancient Monument</a>.

Buckton Castle lies above sea level on Buckton Hill, a steep <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> ridge (). To the south and west are the valleys of the Carr Brook and <a href="River%20Tame%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">River Tame</a> respectively. Buckton Vale Quarry is close to the east of the castle, while the town of <a href="Stalybridge">Stalybridge</a> is about south-west of the site. To the north and north-east of the castle are areas of moorland with heather and peat. The site may have been chosen to allow the castle's garrison to guard the Tame Valley.

During the Middle Ages, Buckton Castle was at the eastern end of Cheshire. The county shares its western border with Wales. Both the castle and valley were in the medieval <a href="manorialism">manor</a> of <a href="Tintwistle">Tintwistle</a>. A manor was a division of land administered by a <a href="Lord%20of%20the%20Manor">Lord of the Manor</a> or his representative; in Tintwistle's case, it was part of the larger lordship of <a href="Longdendale">Longdendale</a>.

Compared to <a href="Herefordshire">Herefordshire</a> and <a href="Shropshire">Shropshire</a>, which were also on the Anglo-Welsh border, Cheshire has far fewer castles per square kilometre. Most of the county's castles are close to the western border where the historically richer parts of Cheshire are concentrated. The county is mostly lowland, and <a href="Beeston%20Castle">Beeston</a> is the only other castle in the area that rises as prominently above the surrounding landscape. According to the archaeologist Rachel Swallow, <a href="hilltop%20castle">hilltop castle</a>s in the area, which include Buckton, Beeston, <a href="Halton%20Castle">Halton</a> and <a href="Mold%20Castle">Mold</a>, are "predominantly a symbol of significant offensive and elite personal power in these landscapes".

The earliest castles in England typically were constructed from timber, at least when they were first built, as building in stone was more expensive. <a href="Paleoenvironmental">Paleoenvironmental</a> evidence shows that between the 9th and 11th centuries, the area where Buckton Castle would later be built was cleared of woodland. This left little timber, and may partly explain why stone was used as a building material. It became more common to use stone in 12th-century castles, and Buckton is amongst the earliest masonry castles in North West England.

Buckton Castle was probably built in the 12th century and there are three identifiable periods of medieval activity at the site: the initial construction phase, in which the ditch was dug and the curtain wall and gatehouse built; the re-cutting of the ditch and further building work behind the curtain wall; and finally deliberate demolition (<a href="slighting">slighting</a>). Little datable material has been recovered from the site – four <a href="sherd">sherd</a>s of Pennine Gritty Ware broadly date to the late 12th century.

As is the case with many castles – especially of the 12th century – there is no record of how much it cost to build Buckton Castle. Based on comparison to <a href="Peveril%20Castle">Peveril Castle</a> in Derbyshire, where construction of the <a href="Keep">great tower</a> in 1175–1177 cost £184 according to the <a href="Pipe%20Rolls">Pipe Rolls</a>, it is estimated that the work at Buckton would have cost around £100. This was close to the <a href="median">median</a> annual income for a <a href="baron">baron</a> in 1200.

Partly because of the cost and partly because Cheshire was a <a href="County%20palatine">palatine county</a> in which the earl had authority over who was permitted to build castles, it is likely that the castle was built by one of the earls of Chester. Compared to other English counties along the Anglo-Welsh border, Cheshire has fewer castles per square kilometre, indicating that the earl may have limited castle building. The construction of the castle may have been prompted by the earls' involvement in <a href="the%20Anarchy">the Anarchy</a>, a civil war during <a href="Stephen%2C%20King%20of%20England">King Stephen's</a> reign in the middle of the 12th century, or the <a href="Revolt%20of%201173%E2%80%9374">Revolt of 1173–74</a> against <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a>.

During the Anarchy, David I of Scotland gained control of most of northern England, including the parts of Lancashire, prompting the construction of Buckton Castle to serve as a safeguard for Cheshire. After the Anarchy, many castles were slighted to restore England to its state before the conflict, which may explain why Buckton was demolished. Alternatively, it could have been slighted after the Revolt of 1173–74 to punish the earl of Chester for taking part in a war against the king. While it is likely the earls of Chester built the castle, it is possible it could have been built by <a href="William%20de%20Neville">William de Neville</a> when he held the lordship of Longdendale under the earl between 1181 and 1186, though he may not have had the financial means to do so.

The dearth of artefacts recovered from Buckton Castle and the lack of finely finished stonework indicate that the site was never finished, but the re-cutting of the ditch suggests either an extended period of occupancy or abandonment followed by repairs to the fortifications.

An estate survey from 1360 recorded that "there is one ruined castle called Buckeden and of no value"; this is the earliest surviving reference to the castle. At the time, the lordship of Longdendale was the property of <a href="Edward%2C%20the%20Black%20Prince">Edward, the Black Prince</a>, and the castle was derelict. The site of the castle may have been used as a beacon in the 16th century, first during the <a href="Pilgrimage%20of%20Grace">Pilgrimage of Grace</a> of 1536–37, and later in the 1580s when the country was under threat of invasion from Spain, particularly with the <a href="Spanish%20Armada">Spanish Armada</a> in 1588. This usage may have been reprised in 1803 when a beacon hut is recorded near <a href="Mossley">Mossley</a>, a settlement less than a mile west of the castle.

In the 18th century, people began <a href="treasure%20hunting">treasure hunting</a> at Buckton Castle. While the hunting was largely unsuccessful, in 1767 one such venture discovered a gold necklace and a silver vessel, though these artefacts have since been lost. This prompted the interest of local <a href="antiquarian">antiquarian</a>s, several of whom visited in the 18th and 19th centuries, often drawing plans of the castle. Since 1924, the castle has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, which is intended to protect important archaeological sites from change; this was probably to protect the castle from Buckton Vale Quarry as it expanded. During the Second World War <a href="Starfish%20site">Starfish site</a>s were built as decoys for bombing raids. Nine were built around Manchester, including one close to Buckton Castle. At this time a brick hut was built over part of the castle ditch. The Starfish site went out of use in 1943.

In the 20th century it was suggested that Buckton Castle may have been an <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> <a href="hillfort">hillfort</a>, but a study of hillforts in Cheshire and Lancashire found that Buckton was topographically different from these sites and therefore unlikely to have been built in the Iron Age. Excavation in 1998 demonstrated that the site was medieval, with no sign of earlier activity. The archaeologists <a href="D.%20J.%20Cathcart%20King">D. J. Cathcart King</a> and <a href="Leslie%20Alcock">Leslie Alcock</a> suggested that the castle was a <a href="ringwork">ringwork</a> – a type of fortification where earthworks formed an integral part of the defence. This was before excavation established that the first phase of the castle was a curtain wall and the earthworks seen today are the result of the collapse of the structure and accumulation of soil on top. Buckton is now understood to be an enclosure castle, with stone walls forming the key defence.

The Tameside Archaeology Survey began in 1990, carried out by the University of Manchester Archaeology Unit with more than £500,000 of funding from <a href="Tameside%20Metropolitan%20Borough%20Council">Tameside Council</a>; £300,000 of this was directed towards the excavations at Buckton Castle. A topographical survey and trial excavations were carried out in 1996 and 1998 to record the castle earthworks and examine a possible outer bailey. The latter was revealed to be a 20th-century feature, probably related to nearby mining activity. Illegal digging by unknown parties in 1999 and 2002 necessitated remedial work and <a href="Shovel%20test%20pit">test pitting</a>. In 2007, full-scale excavations at Buckton Castle began with the aim of establishing the date and history of the site. Across three seasons – 2007, 2008, and 2010 – trenches were opened across the ditch, the northern entrance, the gap in the circuit of earthworks on the south side, the interior, and the curtain wall.

The University of Manchester Archaeological Unit closed in July 2009, and the Tameside Archaeology Survey, along with the work at Buckton Castle, was transferred to the new Centre for Applied Archaeology at the University of Salford. Brian Grimsditch directed the excavations throughout. More than 60 <a href="community%20archaeology%23Community%20archaeology%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">volunteers</a> were involved in the excavations between 2007 and 2010, including people from the <a href="Tameside%20Archaeological%20Society">Tameside Archaeological Society</a>, the <a href="South%20Trafford%20Archaeological%20Group">South Trafford Archaeological Group</a>, the <a href="South%20Manchester%20Archaeological%20Research%20Team">South Manchester Archaeological Research Team</a>, and students from several universities.

Buckton was a small highland <a href="enclosure%20castle">enclosure castle</a> with a sandstone <a href="curtain%20wall%20%28fortification%29">curtain wall</a>; nothing survives above ground. It is roughly oval and measures , covering an area of . The castle is surrounded by a ditch apart from the south-west part where the steep slope of the hill makes the ditch unnecessary. When the ditch was dug some of the material was used to raise the interior of the castle by .

Buckton is similar in size to <a href="Clitheroe%20Castle">Clitheroe Castle</a>'s inner enclosure, which is also oval () and has a curtain wall. Clitheroe was also built on a rocky peak and the small size of its great tower may be due to its naturally defensible position and location in an economically deprived area.

Buckton Castle was entered through a <a href="gatehouse">gatehouse</a> in the north-west measuring . The east side was occupied by the gate passage and the west by a chamber. Though the structure no longer survives above ground, it was probably at least two storeys tall. Constructed in the 12th century, Buckton's gatehouse was the earliest in North West England, and was one of six stone gatehouses in the region that were built in the 12th or 13th centuries: Buckton, <a href="Egremont%20Castle">Egremont</a>, <a href="Brough%20Castle">Brough</a>, Clitheroe, <a href="Carlisle%20Castle">Carlisle's</a> inner gatehouse, and the Agricola Tower at <a href="Chester%20Castle">Chester</a>. They are broadly similar in size, and take the form of a gate passage piercing a single tower with rooms in the floors above. Buckton's gatehouse differs slightly in having the passage offset to one side.

In the 1770s, the antiquarian <a href="Thomas%20Percival%20%28antiquarian%29">Thomas Percival</a> recorded a <a href="water%20well">well</a> within the castle, close to the south curtain, and walls of buildings inside the castle still standing to a height of . A plan created by the Saddleworth Geological Society in 1842 recorded a ruined structure within the castle's south-east area in addition to the well Percival noted. Trenches in the castle's interior did not reveal the structures on the plans from the 18th and 19th centuries, although the discovery of a <a href="posthole">posthole</a> indicates there was activity in this area. The gap in the southern part of the curtain wall – not evident in the 1842 plan by the Saddleworth Geological Society – was probably created in the 19th century. There is a feature resembling a spoil heap, consisting of pieces of sandstone. This may have been a by-product from the construction of the castle. Nothing remains of Buckton Castle above ground today, and until the late 20th century, vegetation obscured the existence of a stone structure.

Banksia aquilonia

Banksia aquilonia, commonly known as the northern banksia, is a <a href="tree">tree</a> in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a> native to north <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> on Australia's northeastern coastline. With an average height of , it has narrow glossy green leaves up to long and high pale yellow flower spikes, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, appearing in autumn. As the spikes age, their flowers fall off and they develop up to 50 <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a>, each of which contains two seeds.

<a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> described the plant in his 1981 <a href="monograph">monograph</a> of the genus "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" as a <a href="Variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> of "<a href="Banksia%20integrifolia">Banksia integrifolia</a>", but later reclassified it as a separate species. Genetic studies show it to be related to "<a href="Banksia%20plagiocarpa">Banksia plagiocarpa</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20oblongifolia">Banksia oblongifolia</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20robur">Banksia robur</a>". The species is found in wet <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest and rainforest margins on sandy soils. "Banksia aquilonia" regenerates after <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a> by regrowing from <a href="epicormic%20shoot">epicormic buds</a> under its bark. It is rarely cultivated.

"Banksia aquilonia" grows as a tall shrub or small tree up to high, though plants up to have been recorded. It has hard, fissured, grey bark, and narrow elliptic or <a href="wikt%3Alanceolate">lanceolate</a> leaves measuring long by wide with <a href="wikt%3Aentire">entire</a> (straight) <a href="Leaf%23Edge%20%28margin%29">margins</a> and acute tips. They are a smooth shiny green above and white below with a prominent <a href="wikt%3Amidrib">midrib</a> covered in red-brown hair. The brownish new growth appears in summer. The plant is in bloom from March to June. Flowers occur in "Banksia" characteristic vertical flower spike, an <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a> made up of hundreds of pairs of flowers densely packed in a <a href="helix">spiral</a> around a woody axis. "B. aquilonia" flower spike is a pale yellow colour, roughly cylindrical, high, and up to in diameter. The tubular <a href="perianth">perianth</a>s of the individual flowers are long. These open at maturity (<a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>) to release the <a href="style%20%28botany%29">styles</a>. All old flower parts fall away as up to 50 oval follicles develop on the bare woody spike. The follicles measure long, high, and wide. Furry at first, they become smooth with age and open when ripe, and their two half-oval valves split to release the one or two seeds they contain. The <a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a> dark grey-brown to black seeds sandwich a <a href="Seed%20separator">woody separator</a>. Measuring long, they are made up of a wedge-shaped seed body, long by wide. The woody separator is the same shape as the seed, with an impression where the seed body lies next to it. Seedlings have bright obovate green <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s around long. Juvenile leaves are narrower, measuring long and wide, and often have serrate (toothed) margins.

Although the inflorescences of "Banksia aquilonia" are similar to "B. integrifolia", the leaves are marked in their differences—the midrib on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs and the leaves are <a href="phyllotaxis">spirally arranged</a> on the branches rather than in whorls as in all "B. integrifolia" subspecies. It was these differences that George felt were distinctive enough for it to be separate it as a full species from "B. integrifolia". The overall <a href="habit%20%28biology%29">habit</a> of a "Banksia aquilonia" tree resembles that of "B. integrifolia", though is generally smaller. The southernmost populations of "B. aquilonia" are separated from the northernmost "B. integrifolia" occurrence by , hence location is helpful in identification.

Field volunteers for "<a href="The%20Banksia%20Atlas">The Banksia Atlas</a>" recorded plants with large adult and juvenile leaves up to long along the Tully to Mission Beach Road, and a population of smaller shrub-sized plants to high with small narrow leaves long and wide at Coronation Lookout in <a href="Wooroonooran%20National%20Park">Wooroonooran National Park</a>, plants with normal <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> occurring further down the mountain.

"Banksia aquilonia" was first described by <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> in 1981 as a <a href="Variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> of "<a href="Banksia%20integrifolia">Banksia integrifolia</a>" (coast banksia), from a specimen collected at Witts Lookout in Crystal Creek National Park south of <a href="Ingham%2C%20Queensland">Ingham</a> on 12 April 1975. The species name is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> adjective "aquilonius", meaning "northern", as it was the most northerly form of "B. integrifolia". In 1996 <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published a <a href="Cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis of "Banksia" based on morphology, in which this <a href="taxon">taxon</a> stood out as the only member of "B. integrifolia" to be both morphologically and geographically distinct from other infraspecific taxa. They also noted that there were no intermediate plants between what was then known as "B. integrifolia" var. "aquilonia" and other populations of "B. integrifolia". On this basis they would have liked to promote it to species rank, but did not because their inferred <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> suggested that this taxon arose from within "B. integrifolia". They were unwilling to render "B. integrifolia" <a href="paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a> by elevating this taxon to species rank, and they were equally unwilling to elevate all four varieties to species rank, since the others all had significant overlaps in distribution and morphology. Therefore, they simply promoted all four to subspecies rank. This example has since been held up as an interesting case study on how the concept of "species" should be defined, as it presents the problem of "a monophyletic group comprising a paraphyletic basal group of incompletely differentiated geographic forms within which is nested at least one divergent, <a href="autapomorphy">autapomorphic</a> taxon that invites treatment as a species."

George promoted it to species rank on the basis of its distinctive leaf arrangement and midrib in 1996. Thus its full name with author citation is ""Banksia aquilonia" (A.S.George) A.S.George". It is placed in subgenus <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"Banksia"</a>, section <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"Banksia"</a> and series "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Salicinae">Salicinae</a>". Its placement within "Banksia" may be summarised as follows:

Despite initially assigning "Banksia aquilonia" to be variety of "B. integrifolia", George noted that it had affinities with the then newly described species "<a href="Banksia%20plagiocarpa">Banksia plagiocarpa</a>", with which it co-occurs on and near <a href="Hinchinbrook%20Island">Hinchinbrook Island</a> in north Queensland.

Since 1998, American botanist <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for "Banksia" and "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra">Dryandra</a>". Their analyses suggest a <a href="phylogenetics">phylogeny</a> that differs greatly from George's <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> arrangement. "Banksia aquilonia" formed a <a href="clade">clade</a> with "B. plagiocarpa", "B. oblongifolia" and "B. robur", rather than "B. integrifolia". Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus "Banksia" by merging "Dryandra" into it, and published <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B." subg. "Spathulatae"</a> for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus "B." subg. "Banksia" was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. aquilonia" is placed in "B." subg. "Spathulatae".

Common names include northern banksia, white banksia, honeysuckle or white bottlebrush. A local aboriginal name is "jingana", in the <a href="Dyirbal%20language">Jirrbal</a> and <a href="Dyirbal%20language">Girramay</a> languages.

"Banksia aquilonia" occurs in coastal areas of northern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> from the <a href="Cedar%20Bay%20National%20Park">Cedar Bay National Park</a> to <a href="Paluma%20Range%20National%20Park">Paluma Range National Park</a>, in areas with an annual rainfall of . It occurs from near sea level to an altitude of , in a variety of habitats and aspects. It grows in wet <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest or rainforest margins, on plateaus, ridges, slopes and low-lying swampy areas on sandy or rocky soils, generally of granitic origin, or sometimes clay. It commonly grows with tree species such as the pink bloodwood ("<a href="Corymbia%20intermedia">Corymbia intermedia</a>"), forest red gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20tereticornis">Eucalyptus tereticornis</a>"), swamp turpentine ("<a href="Lophostemon%20suaveolens">Lophostemon suaveolens</a>"), forest oak ("<a href="Allocasuarina%20torulosa">Allocasuarina torulosa</a>"), and black sheoak ("<a href="Allocasuarina%20littoralis">A. littoralis</a>"), and <a href="understorey">understorey</a> species such as coin spot wattle ("<a href="Acacia%20cincinnata">Acacia cincinnata</a>") and yellow wattle ("<a href="Acacia%20flavescens">A. flavescens</a>"). Much of its lowland habitat in the <a href="Wet%20Tropics%20of%20Queensland">Wet Tropics</a> has been degraded or fragmented. Although the range overlaps with "B. dentata", the two species are not known to occur together.

"Banksia aquilonia" regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from <a href="epicormic%20shoot">epicormic buds</a> under its bark. Regeneration from <a href="Basal%20shoot">root suckers</a> has also been recorded. Unlike many banksia species which release their seed after bushfires, "Banksia aquilonia" sets seed when the follicles mature.

Banksia inflorescences are energy-rich sources of food, and "B. aquilonia" nectar is a likely food item of the endangered <a href="mahogany%20glider">mahogany glider</a> ("Petaurus gracilis"), as well as many other mammals and birds. Avian species observed visiting the flower spikes include the <a href="bridled%20honeyeater">bridled honeyeater</a>, <a href="white-cheeked%20honeyeater">white-cheeked honeyeater</a>, <a href="eastern%20spinebill">eastern spinebill</a> and <a href="rainbow%20lorikeet">rainbow lorikeet</a>.

"Banksia aquilonia" adapts readily to cultivation in humid or temperate climates, but is rarely cultivated. A fast-growing plant, it can grow in <a href="Soil%20pH">acidic soils</a> from pH 3.5 to 6.5. <a href="Plant%20propagation">Propagation</a> is generally by seed, and plants flower at four to six years of age. Vegetative propagation is possible from semi-hardened <a href="Cutting%20%28plant%29">cuttings</a> of pencil thickness. The flower spikes attract birds to the garden. It can also be grown in a pot, with its branches heavily <a href="Pruning">pruned</a> to keep foliage dense.

Pilot (Smallville)

The pilot episode of the television series "<a href="Smallville">Smallville</a>" premiered on <a href="The%20WB%20Television%20Network">The WB</a> on October 16, 2001. It was written by series developers <a href="Alfred%20Gough">Alfred Gough</a> and <a href="Miles%20Millar">Miles Millar</a>, and directed by <a href="David%20Nutter">David Nutter</a>. The "Smallville" <a href="television%20pilot">pilot</a> introduces the characters of <a href="Clark%20Kent%20%28Smallville%29">Clark Kent</a>, an orphaned alien with superhuman abilities, and his friends and family who live in the fictional town of <a href="Smallville%20%28comics%29">Smallville, Kansas</a>. It follows Clark as he first learns of his alien origins, and attempts to stop a vengeful student from killing Smallville High School students. The episode introduces many themes that were designed to run either the course of the season or the entire series, such as the triangular relationships of the main characters.

Production was set in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, used for its "middle America" landscape, with five months devoted to casting the right actors in the lead roles. Filming for the pilot officially began four days after the last actor was cast for the series. When time constraints would not allow the production crew to physically create the sets, <a href="computer-generated%20imagery">computer-generated imagery</a> was used to digitally insert set pieces into a scene. When the series premiere was broadcast, it broke several of The WB's viewership records. It was generally well received by critics, and was nominated for various awards, winning two.

The episode begins in 1989 when a <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a> hits Smallville; at the same time a small spacecraft, containing an alien boy, crashes in front of <a href="Jonathan%20and%20Martha%20Kent">Jonathan and Martha Kent</a>'s (played by <a href="John%20Schneider%20%28screen%20actor%29">John Schneider</a> and <a href="Annette%20O%27Toole">Annette O'Toole</a>) truck. They adopt the superhumanly powerful child and name him Clark. Gough and Millar use this opening scene to establish that the three lead characters of the series, Clark, Lana and Lex, share a common bond—they are all without one or both parents: Clark is the only survivor of his homeworld; Lana's parents are killed in the meteor shower; and Lex is alienated from his father, <a href="Lionel%20Luthor">Lionel Luthor</a> (<a href="John%20Glover%20%28actor%29">John Glover</a>), after being rendered bald by the meteor blast.

The episode jumps forward twelve years to when Clark (<a href="Tom%20Welling">Tom Welling</a>) is trying to find his identity. He is unable to handle being told of his alien origins and runs away from home. Although he is attracted to <a href="Lana%20Lang%20%28Smallville%29">Lana Lang</a> (<a href="Kristin%20Kreuk">Kristin Kreuk</a>), he cannot get close to her without falling over in pain because she wears a necklace made of meteor rock (<a href="kryptonite">kryptonite</a>), which is a radioactive fragment of Clark's destroyed homeworld. This was a concept Gough and Millar devised to establish a reason for Clark's clumsiness. In other media, it is usually portrayed as an act he puts on to deceive people of his true identity. But Clark and Lana do share an intimate moment at a cemetery, where Lana is visiting the grave of her parents. In such scenes, Gough and Millar created a theme of loneliness through the life stories of Clark and Lana. Lana's boyfriend, <a href="Characters%20of%20Smallville%23Whitney%20Fordman">Whitney Fordman</a> (<a href="Eric%20Johnson%20%28actor%29">Eric Johnson</a>), becomes jealous of Clark and Lana's friendship and ties Clark to a <a href="scarecrow">scarecrow</a> pole, using Lana's necklace, indirectly, to subdue Clark. This image of Clark, in just his <a href="Boxer%20shorts">underwear</a> and a red "S" painted on his chest, stretches back to Gough and Millar's foundation for the series, which was about taking Clark down to the basic elements of the <a href="Superman">Superman</a> character.

In the second strand of the story, <a href="Lex%20Luthor%20%28Smallville%29">Lex Luthor</a> (<a href="Michael%20Rosenbaum">Michael Rosenbaum</a>) and Clark develop a "<a href="yin%20and%20yang">yin and yang</a>" relationship. Clark first saves Lex from drowning when they get into a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saves Clark when he is strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite. Jeremy Creek (Adrian McMorran)—who was mutated by the meteor rocks, gaining special powers—puts the three former jocks, who tied him to a scarecrow pole during the meteor shower, into comas. He sets out to kill everyone attending the school's dance, after witnessing Clark experience the same hazing he did, but Clark is able to arrive in time to stop him.

Gough and Millar had five months for casting, but their primary focus was on finding an actor to play Clark Kent. They received Kristin Kreuk's audition tape for the role of Lana Lang and liked it so much that they immediately showed her to the network. Tom Welling, after twice turning down the producers' attempts to get him to audition for the role of Clark Kent, eventually accepted the opportunity to be part of the show. It was David Nutter who finally convinced Welling to read the script for the pilot, after finding Welling's picture in a photo album at the casting director's office. Welling's manager did not want him to take the role because it could hurt his feature film career, but Welling liked the script and agreed to come in for an audition. Welling's reason for turning down the role was because the producers were keeping quiet on what the show was really about, which left him with the impression the show was going to be "Superman in high school", something he did not want to do. Nutter promised to let Welling read the script "if" he came in and auditioned. After auditioning, Welling was given the script to read, which he thought was "amazing". For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene, from the pilot, with Kristin Kreuk; the network thought they had "great chemistry". No one could agree on which actors had the best audition for Lex Luthor. Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice, and, believing he did not take his first audition seriously, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene from the pilot. He indicated all the places to be funny, charismatic, or menacing, and performed so well that everyone agreed he was "the guy".

John Schneider was brought in to play Jonathan Kent. Schneider was already well known as <a href="Bo%20Duke">Bo Duke</a> from "<a href="The%20Dukes%20of%20Hazzard">The Dukes of Hazzard</a>", and Gough believed Schneider's experience from "The Dukes of Hazzard" added believability to the idea that he could have grown up running a farm. <a href="Cynthia%20Ettinger">Cynthia Ettinger</a> was originally cast as Martha Kent, but during filming it was generally agreed—Ettinger included—that she was not right for the role. Annette O'Toole, who previously portrayed Lana Lang in "<a href="Superman%20III">Superman III</a>", and who was fresh off the recent cancellation of her television series "<a href="The%20Huntress%20%28TV%20series%29">The Huntress</a>", was cast in Ettinger's place, reshooting the scenes Ettinger had filmed.

Eric Johnson, after auditioning for the roles of Lex and Clark, was cast as Lana Lang's boyfriend Whitney Fordman. Johnson only spent one day filming his scenes for the pilot. <a href="Allison%20Mack">Allison Mack</a> toyed with the idea of auditioning for the role of Lana Lang but chose instead to audition for the role of <a href="Chloe%20Sullivan">Chloe Sullivan</a>. The character was created just for the series and was intended to add <a href="Ethnic%20group">ethnic</a> diversity to the cast, but part of the reason Gough and Millar chose to cast Mack, against their initial intentions to give the character an ethnic background, was because they were impressed with Allison Mack's "rare ability to deliver large chunks of expositionary dialogue conversationally". <a href="Sam%20Jones%20III">Sam Jones III</a>, who plays <a href="Pete%20Ross">Pete Ross</a>, was the last of the series regulars to be cast. Gough and Millar saw Jones four days before they began filming for the pilot. In the comics, Pete Ross is <a href="Caucasian%20race">Caucasian</a>, and the producers chose to cast Jones, who is <a href="African-American">African-American</a>, against the mythology.

Once Warner Bros. Television secured the rights to the show, Gough and Millar set out to write the script and find a director for the pilot. Gough and Millar were fans of director David Nutter's previous work; they considered him to be a "preeminent pilot director". David Nutter joined the project because he wanted to make a pilot that respected the audience but that was still fun and smart. Nutter also believes in creating shows that appeal to a wide variety of audiences. He wanted the final scene for the pilot, in which Clark fantasizes about dancing with Lana, to express the show's essence. According to Welling, "It brings them close—not as close as Clark would like, but at the end of [this] episode, he imagines that he's with her and can really see it happening."

Production was initially slated to take place in Australia, but <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a> had more of the "middle America" feel for which the creators were looking. The area offered a site for the Kent farm, including their barn, and the city itself doubled as <a href="Superman%27s%20Metropolis">Metropolis</a>. Vancouver provided a cheaper shooting location, and was in the same <a href="time%20zone">time zone</a> as <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles</a>. Filming began in March 2001; Nutter spent sixteen days on main unit filming and an additional five days for <a href="Second%20unit%20director">second unit filming</a>. Time constraints forced Nutter to film strictly from <a href="Adrien%20Van%20Viersen">Adrien Van Viersen</a>'s 150–page <a href="Storyboard%23Film">storyboard</a> when filming the opening meteor shower scene.
Much of the look for "<a href="Smallville">Smallville</a>" came from Millar, who wanted the epitome of "Smalltown, USA". Construction coordinator Rob Maier explained, "It had to be cleaner than clean, nicer than nice, more beautiful than it would be in the real world. All of the people in Smallville are beautiful; all of the colors are bright and sharp." For the Kent farm, Nutter wanted to have "an old world sensibility and tone". For the pilot, the production crew only built a kitchen and dining room to represent the Kent home. All the exterior shots of the farm were taken at the Andalinis farm, owned by a local couple who also gave the crew permission to paint their <a href="forest%20green">forest green</a> house <a href="yellow">yellow</a>. Since the Vancouver farm already had a barn, the production crew only had to build a loft with stairs leading up to it.

Exterior shots of the Luthor Mansion were shot at the <a href="Hatley%20Park%20National%20Historic%20Site">Hatley Castle</a> in <a href="Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia">Victoria</a>, two hours west of Vancouver by ferry. Time constraints forced scenes, which were shot from multiple angles, to sometimes be shot at separate locations. A scene involving Whitney (Eric Johnson) and Lana (Kristin Kreuk) sitting on her porch was shot at two different locations. Close-ups of Whitney were shot under a football stadium, while close-ups of Lana were shot in a potato-processing factory. Unable to shoot at the house being used as the Lang residence, the crew built Lana's front porch inside a <a href="Sewage%20treatment">sewage processing facility</a> for the final scene of the episode where Lana walks up the stairs to her house. The local sewage treatment facility is also the site for the LuthorCorp pesticide plant, which Lex was sent to Smallville to manage. The crash site of Clark's ship was shot at the sandpits where "<a href="Mission%20to%20Mars">Mission to Mars</a>" was filmed. Smallville's Main Street was filmed in both the town of <a href="Merritt%2C%20British%20Columbia">Merritt</a>, which is three hours east of Vancouver, and in the town of <a href="Cloverdale%2C%20British%20Columbia">Cloverdale</a>. Most of the filming took place in Cloverdale, since the town had a long stretch of vacant buildings that could double as Smallville's Main Street. When the production crew came to film the opening teaser, they had to decorate the town with ribbons and balloons, as well as paint some of the buildings to attain Millar's idea of "Smalltown, USA". Two sets were built just for the pilot. The Kent storm cellar was built as a cover set inside the farm's barn. For the cemetery scene between Clark and Lana, production designer Bernard Hides built the entire cemetery from scratch in an empty field.

On-set <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">computer-generated effects</a> for the pilot were done by Thomas Special Effects. Certain scenes, because of time and money, had to be created digitally. The opening sequence showing the destruction of the <a href="water%20tower">water tower</a> by a meteor was created on the computer. A persistent problem during production was the lack of cornfields. As realistic corn was a necessity for a show based in <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, this became a problem for the filmmakers. Over 10,000 stalks of corn were grown in a greenhouse for the pilot, but they only grew two feet high, which was not usable to the crew. The day the crew was filming the scene for Clark's landing there were no cornfields in the surrounding area. The cornfields had to be digitally added. Digital corn was a common substitute for the undersized corn that was grown, but for scenes where digital corn was not an option, six hundred stalks of fake corn were flown in from a manufacturer in <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>. Other digital effects include the flattened cornfield where Lex was caught in a meteorite blast. Some scenes required physical effects, instead of computer imagery. When Lex drives his car off a bridge and hits Clark, the stunt performer, who doubled as <a href="Wolverine%20%28character%29">Wolverine</a> in the film "<a href="X-Men%20%28film%29">X-Men</a>", was literally hit by the car as it went over the bridge.

"Pilot" premiered on <a href="The%20WB%20Television%20Network">The WB</a> on October 16, 2001. 8.4 million viewers watched the pilot's debut, breaking The WB's record for highest ratings for a new series. The pilot broke The WB's ratings record for the 18–49 male demographic, with 3.9 million viewers; it became the third-highest rated debut for the overall adult 18–49 demographic, with an average 3.8 million viewers. The premiere also finished first with viewers age 12–34, leading Warner Bros. President of Entertainment Jordan Levin to credit the series with invigorating the network's Tuesday night lineup. The pilot won an <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> for Sound Editing; it had also been nominated for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Special%20Visual%20Effects">Visual Effects</a> but lost to <a href="UPN">UPN's</a> "". The special effects team won a <a href="Leo%20Awards">Leo Award</a> for Best Visual Effects in a Dramatic Series. Casting directors Deedee Bradley, Coreen Mayrs, and Barbara Miller were nominated for an <a href="Casting%20Society%20of%20America">Artios Award</a> for their work on the pilot. The pilot was nominated for two <a href="Golden%20Reel%20Award%20%28Motion%20Picture%20Sound%20Editors%29">Golden Reel Awards</a>, one for <a href="Sound%20effect">Effects</a> & <a href="Foley%20%28film%20production%29">Foley</a> Sound Editing and one for Music Sound Editing. Peter Wunstorf was also nominated for an <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Cinematographers">American Society of Cinematographers</a> <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Cinematographers%23Award%20categories">Award</a> for his work on the pilot. The pilot, along with the second episode "Metamorphosis", was released in Canada as a special pilot movie. The episodes were altered on the DVD; formatted in 1.78 widescreen, and presented with no opening segment and an alternate closing. It also contained the same special features present in the DVD box set of the first season.

The pilot received favorable reviews upon its release. <a href="Rob%20Owen%20%28journalist%29">Rob Owen</a> of the <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> "Post-Gazette" thought it was a "respectful addition to Superman lore" and had "all the markings of a super series". Owen noted the Christ-like imagery of the scene, stating, "Is it any wonder Clark gets tied up there since Superman, too, was 'sent to save us'?" Echoing Owen, DVD Verdict noted the same symbolism: Superman is, in a way, the secular pop culture stand-in for Jesus Christ, a messiah figure for our generation. The series makes this theme explicit in its pilot episode, in which Clark is symbolically 'crucified' in a cornfield. That striking bit of symbolism becomes the central preoccupation of the series; Clark is the savior who sacrifices all for the greater good of humanity, and "<a href="Smallville">Smallville</a>" shows us how he comes to accept and embrace that role. Elizabeth White of "Media Life" believed the show had potential to be a big hit for The WB but felt it needed to survive not only its time slot—Tuesdays at 9:00 <a href="12-hour%20clock">p.m.</a> (<a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29">EST</a>)—but also the audience's expectations of "what Superman should be". "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>"'s Robert Bianco was a bit more mixed in his criticism. Bianco stated, "For all its innovations, there's also something rehashed and repetitive about "Smallville"... shows often look more familiar at the outset than they do as they progress. There's talent and intelligence at work in "Smallville". Given time, maybe they'll find a more distinctive voice." Jeremy Conrad, from "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>", swore to himself that he would never watch "Smallville", because he was a "huge Superman fan" and he did not like the idea the creators would be making changes to the Superman mythology. After viewing the pilot, Conrad stated, "It's a very solid start to the series, and one of the better pilot episodes I've seen in a while." In <a href="The%20Futon%20Critic">The Futon Critic</a>'s 50 best episodes of 2001 rankings, the pilot was placed 31st, with Brian Ford Sullivan stating, ""Smallville" opened us to a surprisingly fresh take on the Superman myth-this time showing us the humble beginnings of a young Clark Kent."

<a href="The%20CW%20Television%20Network">The CW</a> re-aired the pilot on Friday, April 8, 2011 in preparation for the series finale. The episode was watched by 1.55 million viewers and achieved a 0.5 Adults 18-49 rating, despite only 92% coverage.

Bradley Joseph

Bradley Joseph (born 1965) is an American composer, arranger, and producer of contemporary instrumental music. His compositions include works for orchestra, quartet, and solo piano, while his musical style ranges from "quietly pensive mood music to a rich orchestration of classical depth and breadth".

Active since 1983, Joseph has performed in front of millions of people around the world. He played various instruments in rock bands throughout the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwest</a> until 1989 when <a href="Greece">Greek</a> composer <a href="Yanni">Yanni</a> hired him for his core band after hearing a tape of his original compositions. He was a featured concert keyboardist with Yanni through six major tours, most recently in 2003 for the 60-city "<a href="Ethnicity%20%28album%29">Ethnicity</a>" tour. He appears in the multi-platinum album and concert film, "<a href="Live%20at%20the%20Acropolis">Live at the Acropolis</a>". Joseph also spent five years as <a href="musical%20director">musical director</a> and lead keyboardist for <a href="Sheena%20Easton">Sheena Easton</a>, including a 1995 performance on "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show%20with%20Jay%20Leno">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a>".

Joseph is the founder of the Robbins Island Music label. His solo career began when he independently released "<a href="Hear%20the%20Masses">Hear the Masses</a>," featuring many of his Yanni bandmates. This debut was followed by "<a href="Rapture%20%28Bradley%20Joseph%20album%29">Rapture</a>", an instrumental album recorded with a 50-piece orchestra in which Joseph wrote and conducted all of the scores. It was released on the <a href="Narada%20Productions">Narada</a> label and reached <a href="Zone%20Music%20Reporter">ZMR</a> Airwaves Top 30. A number of subsequent recordings including "<a href="Christmas%20Around%20the%20World">Christmas Around the World</a>" and "<a href="One%20Deep%20Breath">One Deep Breath</a>" also held positions on ZMR's Top 100 radio chart, with the most recent being "<a href="Paint%20the%20Sky">Paint the Sky</a>" which debuted at #15 in April 2013. "Paint the Sky" was nominated for Best Neo-Classical Album in the 10th annual ZMR Music Awards. He has produced numerous CDs/DVDs and piano books. His music is included in multiple various-artist compilation albums including the 2008 release of "".

Bradley Joseph was born in <a href="Bird%20Island%2C%20Minnesota">Bird Island, Minnesota</a> and raised in <a href="Willmar%2C%20Minnesota">Willmar, Minnesota</a>, graduating from Willmar Senior High School in 1983. He learned how to play piano from a how-to piano book he found in the piano bench. One morning his father taught him how to play a boogie-woogie blues tune and by nightfall he could play the entire piece. He started playing classical piano at age eight, taking lessons for a year and a half but was self-taught thereafter. While in junior high, he took a concert field trip where he saw <a href="Buddy%20Rich">Buddy Rich</a> perform. He recalls, "I sat in the first row and when Buddy's sax player stood up to take his first solo something just clicked — the world closed in around me. I felt the power of music and knew that it was something special, a gift to be shared." Joseph played piano for the jazz band and choir in high school, and trombone through high school and college. When he picked up the horn, he got a whole new perspective on music, gaining insight into all the different <a href="timbre">timbre</a>s available, which was invaluable to him when he started working with orchestras. The first band he was in was a wedding dance band which allowed him to gain experience in every different style of music from polkas to rock and roll to jazz classics. After attending <a href="Minnesota%20State%20University%20Moorhead">Moorhead State University</a> as a music major, he led some of his own bands around the area that toured Midwest nightclubs. He played sax and guitar in some of these earlier bands but left them to concentrate on just the piano/keyboards. Later, he started performing with guitarist <a href="Dugan%20McNeill">Dugan McNeill</a>, whose <a href="U2">U2</a>-like group was signed to Polygram. McNeill and <a href="Yanni">Yanni</a> had once played together in the technopop band <a href="Chameleon%20%28American%20band%29">Chameleon</a> in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In 1989, Joseph recorded his first demo tape and sent it off to Greek composer <a href="Yanni">Yanni</a>, who was looking for someone to replace keyboardist <a href="John%20Tesh">John Tesh</a>, as Tesh was launching his own solo career. When Yanni heard Joseph's compositions and arrangements, he was hired over the phone to join his core band, without ever meeting. 

After moving to <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> at age 23, he composed, arranged, and performed alongside Yanni for more than six years, performing in-concert with a number of notable symphony orchestras, touring throughout the U.S. and abroad as Yanni gained worldwide fame. His first show was at the Starplex in Dallas with the <a href="Dallas%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Dallas Symphony Orchestra</a> filming a video project. "It was a real trial by fire for me", said Joseph. "First show + 10,000 people + TV cameras equals NERVOUS." He told Jane Fredericksen of the "St. Croix Valley Press" that "It was a big jump, you don't really realize it at the time, but there's no in-between — going from playing nightclubs to arenas." Some of these early tours included the "<a href="Reflections%20of%20Passion">Reflections of Passion</a>", "<a href="In%20Celebration%20of%20Life">Revolution in Sound</a>", "<a href="Dare%20to%20Dream%20%28Yanni%20album%29">Dare to Dream</a>", "<a href="In%20My%20Time">Yanni Live, The Symphony Concerts</a>" 1993 and 1994 concert tours, as well as a performance in Germany that was broadcast throughout Europe and seen by 30 to 40 million viewers. Joseph appears on the 1994 multi-platinum album and video, "<a href="Live%20at%20the%20Acropolis">Live at the Acropolis</a>." He recounts, "When I reflect back over the years, one of the high points that stand out include performing at the Acropolis with Yanni. Imagine all these different cultures coming together with the challenges of language, equipment, travel, and weather problems. I still picture the police running their dogs through the dressing rooms to sniff out any bomb possibilities right before the show. People still come up to me and comment how that show has affected their lives."

In the band, Joseph covered a lot of the keyboard parts that Yanni could not for lack of hands in the shows. He assisted with the task of managing the 30 or more synthesizers onstage, and helped layer with the orchestra to create a "full-bodied, live-effect sound". He did have to adjust some parts that did not work well in a live situation and worked extensively on programming sounds for all keyboardists. Joseph said that "Yanni gave us musicians a great deal of freedom to expand the music as well. If you listen to the original recordings he did and what we ended up with in our live recordings, you can really hear the musician's input." He readily credits Yanni's role in his professional development, and for five years of irreplaceable experiences and memories.

Between tours, Joseph worked extensively in recording studios on music ranging from rock and pop to rhythm and blues and orchestration with numerous artists from <a href="RCA">RCA</a>, <a href="Epic%20Records">Epic</a>, <a href="Warner%20Brothers">Warner Brothers</a>, and <a href="Polygram%20Records">Polygram Records</a>, in addition to performing in an elaborate national keyboard show tour with various musicians. In 2003, he returned for the 60-city "<a href="Ethnicity%20%28album%29">Ethnicity</a>" tour.

Joseph also performed with <a href="Sheena%20Easton">Sheena Easton</a> for four years as her <a href="Musical%20director">co-musical director</a> and lead keyboardist. He went from Yanni to Easton and back to Yanni in a few years. "It was a great transition from Yanni because it made me musically aware again", he said in reference to Easton's <a href="Rhythm%20and%20Blues">R&B</a> style. "I went back to where I started but it felt like a new invention."

In a 1995 interview, he said that after five years of touring with Yanni and working on his own debut album, he needed a break. Yanni was still building his career and maintained a hectic concert schedule. Working with Easton, on the other hand, was "the best of both worlds". "She just adopted a baby and is pretty settled in", said Joseph. Tour venues with her included Japan, Indonesia, Puerto Rico, and the United States, as well as routine appearances in <a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada">Las Vegas</a> and <a href="Atlantic%20City">Atlantic City</a>. In March 1995, he appeared with her on "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show%20with%20Jay%20Leno">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a>" when she performed her new single at the time, "My Cherie".

In 1994, between world tours, Joseph released his debut album, "<a href="Hear%20the%20Masses">Hear the Masses</a>", a self-produced, self-published release under the More Core Records label consisting of 10 original compositions. He invited most of the Yanni band to contribute. They include <a href="Charlie%20Adams%20%28drummer%29">Charlie Adams</a> (drums, percussion); <a href="Ric%20Fierabracci">Ric Fierabracci</a> (fretless bass); <a href="Jeanette%20Clinger">Jeanette Clinger</a> (vocals); and <a href="Grammy">Grammy</a>-winning violinist <a href="Charlie%20Bisharat">Charlie Bisharat</a>. Other guest artists include Larry Preston (guitar); and Terry Brau — featured on numerous Bradley Joseph recordings — playing trumpet, saxophone, and <a href="fluegelhorn">fluegelhorn</a>.

Joseph's style attracted the attention of <a href="Narada%20Productions">Narada Productions</a>, a <a href="Virgin%20Records">Virgin Records</a> subsidiary, via the <a href="World-Wide%20Web">World Wide Web</a>. A representative for Narada came across his website and downloaded some music. This sparked their interest and resulted in signing Joseph to a multi-record deal, according to Peter Spellman of the <a href="Berklee%20College%20of%20Music">Berklee College of Music</a>. The outcome was "<a href="Rapture%20%28Bradley%20Joseph%20album%29">Rapture</a>", containing intimate piano pieces, quartets, and full orchestral works. It reached ZMR's "Airwaves Top 30" at No. 15 in July 1997. This album was recorded at a number of different studios including <a href="Captain%20and%20Tennille">Captain and Tennille</a>'s studio in <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles</a>, and <a href="Pachyderm%20Studio">Pachyderm Studio</a> in <a href="Cannon%20Falls%2C%20Minnesota">Cannon Falls, Minnesota</a>. In addition to a core band including <a href="Charlie%20Adams%20%28drummer%29">Charlie Adams</a> on percussion, <a href="Charlie%20Bisharat">Charlie Bisharat</a> on violin, and Steven Trochlil on clarinet, Joseph brought in a 50-piece orchestra, and conducted and wrote all the scores. Ken Moore of the "Naples Daily News" cites, "Joseph's music is backed by 15 talented musicians, some playing three or more different instruments, that make up a symphony of sounds ranging from quietly pensive mood music to a rich orchestration of classical depth and breadth." "Wind and Wire Magazine" contributor, Michael Debbage, recalls, "It was the year 1997 and New Age music had already peaked commercially as the interest and exposure seemed to lag. The genres main labels – Narada, Windham Music, and Higher Octave – were beginning to explore worldly themes versus the warm, earthly, acoustic themes that prior artists had established. It appeared that the abundance of new artists was becoming a dying breed. An exception to the rule was Bradley Joseph, who released his first mainstream album "Rapture" to glorious reviews, and to this day it remains his <a href="wikt%3Atour%20de%20force">tour de force</a>." One of Joseph's compositions, "<a href="The%20Glen%20%28Bradley%20Joseph%20song%29">The Glen</a>", was written solely for the album "<a href="Stories%20%28Narada%20Artist%20Collection%29">Stories, a Narada Artist Collection</a>", and is now also featured on "<a href="20%20Years%20of%20Narada%20Piano">20 Years of Narada Piano</a>". His works are included in other Narada compilation projects as well.

Although Joseph said that working with Narada was a great experience music-wise, he did not like the lack of control over the end product, and asked to be released from his contract. He started Robbins Island Music in 1998, composing, producing, and distributing his own recordings. "<a href="Solo%20Journey">Solo Journey</a>" was released and consists of eleven soft piano compositions that are based on mood and not on melody. It is characterized by Debbage as being a "scaled down introspective, ... and while simplistic was still breath-taking".

Later releases include "<a href="Christmas%20Around%20the%20World">Christmas Around the World</a>" reaching <a href="Zone%20Music%20Reporter">ZMR's</a> Top 100 Radio Playlist; and "<a href="One%20Deep%20Breath">One Deep Breath</a>" also holding a position on ZMR's Top 100 Radio Chart for over six months. Bill Binkelman writes that while he doubts fans of Liquid Mind or other mainly electronic new age music artists would wholly embrace the overt romanticism of piano-led tracks like 'Dancers Waltz' or 'Dreamer's Lullaby', there is definite appeal on the album for fans of adult contemporary piano pieces, as well as for lovers of the more minimal approach to new age music." Reviewing for "<a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a>", Jim Brenholts describes "One Deep Breath" as a set of smooth adult contemporary pieces in which Joseph adds "world music flair and inspirational touches". "The vocal expressions by Clystie Whang and Joseph have devotional qualities that weave through the atmospheres and soundscapes smoothly." 

Joseph returned as a featured instrumentalist during Yanni's 2003 "<a href="Ethnicity%20%28album%29">Ethnicity</a>" world tour, and wrote his sixth album on stage after sound checks. "<a href="The%20Journey%20Continues%20%28Bradley%20Joseph%20album%29">The Journey Continues</a>", a sequel to "Solo Journey", features Joseph on solo piano. Debbage writes, "The magical world of movies has a knack for exploring sequels. There is the beauty and beast effect when taking this pathway. The creative beauty allows the viewers to see the continued growth of its characters. The beastly aspect of this exploration is the Hollywood exploitation of an almost guaranteed return on its investment with no regard for its creative progression that usually sees diminishing returns. Bradley Joseph has decided to walk this tightrope by following up with "Solo Journey" that was released back in 2000. I am glad to report that "The Journey Continues" is entrenched in beauty, holding up well to its predecessor."

Subsequent releases include "<a href="For%20the%20Love%20of%20It%20%28album%29">For the Love of It</a>", "<a href="Piano%20Love%20Songs">Piano Love Songs</a>", and "<a href="Hymns%20and%20Spiritual%20Songs%20%28album%29">Hymns and Spiritual Songs</a>". On these albums, Joseph arranges piano, orchestra, and soft rhythms to cover melodies such as "<a href="I%27ll%20Never%20Fall%20in%20Love%20Again">I'll Never Fall in Love Again</a>" (<a href="Burt%20Bacharach">Burt Bacharach</a>), "<a href="Fields%20of%20Gold">Fields of Gold</a>" (<a href="Sting%20%28musician%29">Sting</a>), and "<a href="Ellens%20dritter%20Gesang">Ave Maria</a>" (<a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a>). He has produced numerous CD and DVD projects designed for pets in a "" series. He has also produced a four-CD set of Nature Sounds and has published many of his compositions in sheet music form. His music is used throughout the DVD, "Isle Royale Impressions Volume II", containing video footage by Carl TerHaar of scenery and wildlife from the <a href="Isle%20Royale%20National%20Park">Isle Royale National Park</a> in Michigan.

In April 2013, Joseph released his first album of original compositions in 10 years entitled "<a href="Paint%20the%20Sky">Paint the Sky</a>" which debuted at #15 on ZMR's Top 100 Radio Chart. It is self-described as "piano instrumentals with a cinematic feel". He received requests from listeners to do another CD with original compositions that incorporate lush orchestration along with the piano, similar to "Hear The Masses" and "Rapture". Kathy Parsons of "MainlyPiano" states that "Joseph is obviously a very versatile musician, and there are a lot of influences and musical styles that meld together to make "Paint the Sky" an exceptional musical experience." Michael Debbage of "MainlyPiano" writes that "Paint the Sky" represents Joseph’s most complete recording since his landmark album "Rapture". He goes on to say that "whether you have enjoyed Joseph’s more spatial recordings or his deeper embellished adventures, "Paint the Sky" essential is a musical rainbow of where Joseph has been and where he can potential go."

Joseph was named one of the ""Ten Outstanding Young Minnesotans"" (TOYM) of 2004 by the Minnesota <a href="Jaycees">Jaycees</a>. In April 2008 he was presented the "WPS Foundation Arts and Academics Hallmarks of Pride" award for outstanding achievements by an alumnus. His music has been on Billboard charts, #1 on <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, #1 on <a href="ITunes">ITunes</a>, and top 40 for Sirius satellite radio.

Joseph's music has been heard in regular <a href="spin%20%28radio%29">rotation</a> in the United States and Canada by more than 160 major radio networks including <a href="XM%20Satellite%20Radio">XM</a> and <a href="Sirius%20Satellite%20Radio">Sirius</a> satellite radio, <a href="DMX%20%28music%29">DMX</a>; in the United Kingdom including <a href="RT%C3%89%20lyric%20fm">RTÉ lyric fm</a>; as well as airwaves in Japan, Spain, China, South-East Asia, Thailand, Germany, Switzerland, and Russia. Airlines such as <a href="Aerom%C3%A9xico">Aeroméxico</a>, <a href="AirTran%20Airways">AirTran</a>, <a href="Frontier%20Airlines">Frontier</a>, <a href="JetBlue%20Airways">JetBlue</a>, and <a href="ExpressJet%20Airlines">ExpressJet</a> feature his music in their in-flight music programs. <a href="The%20Weather%20Channel%20%28United%20States%29">The Weather Channel</a> also utilizes his compositions during the "Local on the 8s" segments, and the song "<a href="Hear%20the%20Masses">Friday's Child</a>" is included in their 2008 compilation release, "".

"Paint the Sky" (2013) was nominated for Best <a href="Neoclassical%20new%20age">Neo-Classical</a> Album in the 10th annual ZMR Music Awards.

Having experienced both avenues of recording on a <a href="Major%20record%20labels">major label</a> and later choosing to be an <a href="Independent%20music">independent artist</a>, a combination of musicianship with business know-how has helped give Joseph staying power in the notoriously competitive world of music. He spends most of his time writing songs, composing arrangements, making recordings, and publishing and distributing his works. "I'm my own boss. I can do what I want. I can change directions", he told <a href="West%20Central%20Tribune">West Central Tribune</a>'s Anne Polta. As an independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled, Joseph said. "A lot of musicians don't learn the business. You just have to be well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand publishing. You have to understand how you make money, what's in demand, what helps you make the most out of your talent." "I couldn't license my music if it wasn't mine", he said. "It has allowed me to create CDs. It separates you from the million other great players."

In an interview with author Cicily Janus, Joseph commented that his perspective has changed a great deal from when he was younger. He said, "Everything I did was focused on making good music and being a great musician, not running a business. Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses." But some artists just want to be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. He advises, "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time. All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything." He explains, "Time and persistence has shown me that I can succeed at sharing my art with others as a musician while running my own music business. And that kind of success is as good as I could have ever wished for."

When asked by Wheeler what brought him back to Minnesota after living in Los Angeles and traveling around the world, Joseph replied, "The first thing business people say is 'First and foremost, if you want to be successful, live where you want to live'." He grew up there and family were important to him. When he decided to become a solo artist he wanted to be comfortable in his environment and moved back.

In an interview with "Indie Journal", Joseph said that when writing music he prefers to concentrate on the melody first, stating, "Basically, I write from a two-person standpoint. First, I let the song take hold and I put down the idea as a raw emotional statement. Then I let it breathe and come back, approaching from more of an objective point of view. This allows me to rediscover the true meaning I intended in the beginning, shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener." This same concept is explained again in a taped interview with the "Government Television Network" with Joseph explaining that a lot of times he may only come up with part of a melody. Then he would let it rest and come back to it and see if it feels right. Then he would start "building around it", like putting a car together - start with a frame and then start building things around it. Musically, he tries to connect a common bridge between such exhilarating feelings as performing at the Acropolis, to the emotions each and every one feels every day. "In the end, a good melody will always stand the test of time", says Joseph.

Debbage comments, "One strength of Bradley Joseph as an artist has been his keen ability to write inspiring music with appropriately titled songs that express that thought non-verbally". Joseph explained to Janus that, "Through instrumental music, I'm allowed to come up with musical ideas that allow the listener to create their own impression of my song. If you add lyrics about a girl in the song, the listener doesn't have a choice of what the song is about, it's told to them. My musical writings allow me to express anything. It's easier for me to tell a story of something I've encountered this way than to verbalize it. And my feelings are explored more in my compositions compared to what I could ever say in a few sentences." He believes that "music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts, thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words." He also believes that the spiritual aspect of creating is to "find something deep within yourself that can only be created by you"..."Your spiritual self cannot be copied and that's why it's so significant in life and music", he says. Parsons goes on to say, "The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph's sound, but his musical voice is his own." Yanni once said, "Bradley, your extreme sensitivity is your greatest gift". Joseph later realized what Yanni meant was that he needed that as a composer, that it was a crucial component "to be sensitive to what you see and to be able to apply that to music".

Polta reports that he often references the past when he names his songs and his music is frequently reminiscent of his rural <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> roots. "Wind Farmer" was inspired by childhood visits to a relative's farm near <a href="Olivia%2C%20Minnesota">Olivia</a>, and his company, Robbins Island Music, is named after a city park in <a href="Willmar%2C%20Minnesota">Willmar</a>.

Joseph employs a variety of instruments to compose including the <a href="Korg%20Triton">Korg Triton</a> music workstation, Korg SG-1 piano, and occasionally <a href="Korg%20M1">Korg M1</a>. Rack units have included <a href="Roland%20JD-800">Roland JD-800</a>, and <a href="Roland%20JV-1080">Roland JV-1080</a> which he says is "great for string layers". The <a href="Alesis">Alesis D4</a>, Yamaha SY22, and <a href="Yamaha%20TG77">Yamaha TG77</a> which has "some nice ethereal textures" have been utilized; working also with <a href="E-mu%20Systems">E-mu Systems</a> Proteus 1, Proteus 2, and the E-5000 sampler because it is "easy to use and has a great library". Acoustic pianos vary, <a href="Yamaha%20%28piano%29">Yamaha</a> and <a href="B%C3%B6sendorfer">Bösendorfer</a> were used for the 1997 album, "Rapture".

Joseph's musical style and direction have varied over time, having released more than two hundred original compositions and arrangements since 1994. "When I write it, it just kind of moves, because where I am in life is different", Joseph said. "So as I get older, it kind of changes."

Joseph's recordings can offer full orchestrations such as in "Hear the Masses" and "Rapture" that combine smooth jazz with contemporary instrumental themes. A review of "Rapture" from "New Age Voice" states Joseph "paints romantic pictures in sound with voices and instruments that escalate from quiet, intimate passages to big, energetic movements". "The arrangements are structured so that the trumpet can lead a line out on 'Be Still' signaling an introspective sort of mood; yet the strings swell on 'The Passage' engulfing the listener in an ocean of sound." "Even cuts that start quiet, such as 'Healing the Hollow Man' or 'Blue Rock Road' ebb and flow between quiet moments and crescendos."
In contrast, albums such as "Solo Journey" and "The Journey Continues" are considered to be "stripped back and basic" by Debbage, with the latter featuring "Joseph and his piano with no additional clutter". "There is color in the songs via their understated melodies." As examples, Debbage describes Joseph as using a chord progression that translates into a strolling rhythm in the song "The Road Ahead". "Solo Piano Publications" contributor, Kathy Parsons, writes, "...'The Long, Last Mile' starts out with a bittersweet melody, and then builds in intensity and complexity with cello, winds, and ethereal sounds intertwining around the piano. Then it breaks off, and the opening melody returns."

For the 2002 album "One Deep Breath", Joseph combines "structured melodic pieces and free-form ambient compositions", which "departs dramatically from the previous more explosive and dynamic music on his first two recordings, "Hear the Masses" and "Rapture"". Binkelman writes, "It is an album with two distinct 'feels' to it: the more serene new age/ambient soundscapes that bookend the inner tracks and the more radio-friendly and mainstream music in-between." For instance, the song "Dance of Life" was inspired by <a href="Anton%C3%ADn%20Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k">Antonín Dvořák</a>'s opera, "<a href="Rusalka%20%28opera%29">Rusalka</a>". It is a bit more straightforward in its piano presentation, and will probably appeal the most to hardcore fans of solo instrumental music, says "Instrumental Weekly". Then the album closes with its title track, "One Deep Breath", that "floats and meanders for more than ten minutes, bringing in ocean sounds". It is "far and away the most ambient of everything else to be found here", and is "stunning, both in its execution and how radical a change it is from what has come before".

Debbage depicts "A Minnesota Snowfall" from "Christmas Around the World" as taking "a more naked, bare-boned <a href="ballad">ballad</a> approach". While discussing "<a href="Classic%20Christmas%20%28Bradley%20Joseph%20album%29">Classic Christmas</a>", Gerry Grzyb, chairman of the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh sociology department, states that Joseph's usual approach is to play the carol straight, and then add his own twists. "... he's very effective at that—he doesn't stray as far as a jazz or classical organ improviser might, but he does keep the interest up." Grzyb says that the same applies to Joseph's earlier "Christmas Around the World" CD, which he found even more interesting because of the use of other instrumental sounds.

Joseph has also produced numerous CDs that include cover arrangements for piano and orchestra. The 2009 release of "<a href="Suites%20%26amp%3B%20Sweets">Suites & Sweets</a>" features compositions by <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>, <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>, <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a>, and other classical composers. Joseph told Fredericksen that he, "took the best parts and movements out of those classical songs … and made it soft and calm all the way through."

After requests from listeners for Joseph to do another CD with original compositions that incorporate lush orchestration along with the piano, similar to "Hear The Masses" and "Rapture", Joseph released "<a href="Paint%20the%20Sky">Paint the Sky</a>" in April 2013. It is self-described as "piano instrumentals with a cinematic feel". John P. Olsen of "New Age Music World" writes that ""Paint The Sky" ...is best expressed by the near even number of songs with upbeat melodies and lively rhythms, with the balance centered by a light, casual relaxed atmosphere...with importance given to melodic rhythm and phrasing." In another review of "Paint the Sky", Bill Binkelman of "Wind and Wire" says that "Joseph is one of the very best artists when it comes to crafting piano instrumentals augmented by the spot-on application of an assortment of keyboard embellishments, from standard orchestral accompaniment to more textural/new age elements". Kathy Parsons of "MainlyPiano" states "The thirteen pieces ...range from tender to majestic. Several pieces are solo piano and others are orchestrated with keyboards to give a vibrant, cinematic effect."

About this album, Binkelman describes the song "Inside the Stars" as "an uptempo, joyous lead piano melody accented by bouncy rhythms played on kit drums, thumping bass, and tambourine plus superlative orchestral strings". Michael Debagge of "MainlyPiano" states that "the optimism of this album is felt immediately courtesy of the buoyancy of 'Inside The Stars', filled with Joseph's nifty piano work more in the vein of <a href="Bruce%20Hornsby">Bruce Hornsby</a>, then layered in strings and percussion work".

In an in-depth analysis of the composition "In Dreams Awake", Binkelman opines that this song bears a strong contemporary classical influence and that some people might even hear strains of <a href="Philip%20Glass">Philip Glass</a>' music. He says there is an exultant feel to the melody, but because Joseph maintains absolute control of nuance and shading the song never descends into overblown melodrama or bombast. As the track progresses, the mood and style shifts into a more identifiable new age motif, with more textural synths, bell tones and bell trees, and a more pronounced sweeping sensation of subdued grandeur. The Glass-like motif returns for the song's finale. Parsons characterizes this same song as "a concept piece that begins with an intense and intriguing theme for cello or viola and strings. Building as it evolves, it never takes a breath until near the end of the theme. From there, the piece becomes dreamy and ambient, "floating effortlessly" on keyboard sounds until the original strings re-enter, increasing to the intensity of the first theme". At the same time, Debbage notes "...the multi-movements found on the challenging 'In Dreams Awake'..." and says that it "...opens with an extended piece of strings that almost appear to be battling against each other, only to move into a beautiful dreamy midsection to once again return to the more chaotic strings, much like our nonsensical dreams".

Binkleman goes on to say that the song "Into the Big Blue" should instantly call <a href="Aaron%20Copland">Aaron Copland</a> to mind – it has the same BIG orchestral/cinematic sound to it, along with Copland-esque western rhythm and melodic motifs. Similarly, Debbage states that this song brings to mind the musical opening theme of that old western television show "<a href="The%20Big%20Valley">The Big Valley</a>".

In reference to the song "Secrets of the Sun", Binkelman describes "lush strings and gorgeous new age synths with the piano melody here brimming with a blend of the ethereal and the romantic with a dash of wistfulness besides". The synth sounds remind him a little of <a href="Ray%20Lynch">Ray Lynch</a>. Parsons details this as "much calmer and more graceful with a piano melody and keyboard enhancements". Debbage writes that "the remainder of the album is filled with Joseph's uncanny ability to compose elegant and emotive ballads. Back track to 'Secrets Of The Sun' that gently sways in the piano and string arrangements with similar results found on 'The Edge Of My Heart'.

Generally, Joseph's music gets airplay in the <a href="Soft%20adult%20contemporary">adult contemporary</a>, <a href="smooth%20jazz">smooth jazz</a>, <a href="easy%20listening">easy listening</a>, and <a href="beautiful%20music">beautiful music</a> radio formats, and while some is classified in the <a href="New-age%20music">new age</a> genre, he considers <a href="Instrumental%20music">contemporary instrumental</a> to fit his style of playing the best. In discussing "Rapture", John Blake of "<a href="The%20Atlanta%20Journal-Constitution">The Atlanta Journal</a>" notes that often new age music sounds as if it should be played in a supermarket. The songs can sound like musical cotton candy — soft, airy and ultimately uninteresting. "For the most part, Bradley's music doesn't make that mistake." "The music is cinematic, filled with introspective piano solos, swelling violins, and a hypnotic song pacing that allows the listener to daydream." Along the same line, Michael Debbage of "Mainly Piano" says that "Rapture" almost single-handedly gave a sense of hope that there was much more that the New Age genre could offer. Cicily Janus remarks that, "Although Bradley has been, at times, pigeon holed into an offshoot of jazz, his message through his music is universal in its appeal and soothing qualities."

Banksia epica is a <a href="shrub">shrub</a> that grows on the south coast of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>. A spreading bush with wedge-shaped serrated leaves and large creamy-yellow flower spikes, it grows up to 3½ metres (11½ ft) high. It is known only from two isolated populations in the remote south east of the <a href="States%20and%20territories%20of%20Australia">state</a>, near the western edge of the <a href="Great%20Australian%20Bight">Great Australian Bight</a>. Both populations occur among coastal <a href="heath%20%28habitat%29">heath</a> on <a href="cliff-top%20dune">cliff-top dune</a>s of <a href="Silicon%20dioxide">siliceous</a> sand.

One of the most recently described "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" species, it was probably seen by <a href="Edward%20John%20Eyre">Edward John Eyre</a> in 1841, but was not collected until 1973, and was only recognised as a distinct <a href="species">species</a> in 1988. There has been very little research on the species since then, so knowledge of its ecology and cultivation potential is limited. It is placed in <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Cyrtostylis">"Banksia" ser. "Cyrtostylis"</a>, alongside its close relative, the well-known and widely cultivated "<a href="Banksia%20media">B. media</a>" (southern plains banksia).

"Banksia epica" grows as a spreading bushy shrub with many branches, from 30 centimetres to 3½ metres (1–11½ ft) tall. It has grey, fissured bark, and dark green, wedge-shaped leaves, 1½ to 5 centimetres (½–2 in) long and 6 to 15 millimetres (– in) wide, with serrated <a href="Leaf%23Margins%20%28edge%29">margins</a>.
Flowers occur in "Banksia"s characteristic "flower spike", an <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a> made up of hundreds of pairs of flowers densely packed in a <a href="helix">spiral</a> round a woody axis. "B. epica"s flower spike is yellow or cream-yellow in colour, cylindrical, 9 to 17 centimetres (3½–6½ inches) tall and around 6 centimetres (2½ inches) in diameter. In bud, it may have green-grey or brownish <a href="pollen%20presenter">pollen presenter</a>s, not unlike "<a href="Banksia%20robur">B. robur</a>" (swamp banksia). Each flower consists of a tubular <a href="perianth">perianth</a> made up of four fused <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s, and one long wiry <a href="carpel">style</a>. Characteristic of its taxonomic section, the styles of "B. epica" are straight rather than hooked. The style ends are initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but break free at <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>. The fruiting structure is a stout woody "cone" embedded with up to 50 <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a>; old withered flower parts persist on the "cones", giving them a hairy appearance. The follicles have an attractive purple hue.

"Banksia epica" is similar in appearance to its close relative "B. media", from which it differs in having slightly shorter leaves and larger flowers. In addition, the persistent flower parts on "B. epica"s fruiting structures are curled and point upwards, whereas they are straight and point downwards on "B. media".

The first European to see "B. epica" was probably <a href="Edward%20John%20Eyre">Edward John Eyre</a>, the first explorer of the area, who recorded "stunted specimens" of "Banksia" as he was nearing the western edge of the Great Australian Bight on 1 May 1841:

Eyre is thought to have been passing through the <a href="Toolinna%20Cove">Toolinna Cove</a> sand patch at the time of writing. "B. epica" and "B. media" are the only "Banksia" species that occur at that location, and both have a form and habit that accords with Eyre's description. As he did not collect specimens, it is impossible to determine what species he saw.

The first <a href="herbarium">herbarium</a> collection of "B. epica" was not made until October 1973, when <a href="Ernest%20Charles%20Nelson">Ernest Charles Nelson</a> visited Toolinna Cove to collect specimens for a taxonomic revision of "<a href="Adenanthos">Adenanthos</a>". Nelson was stimulated to make that revision from an interest in the problem of disjunct plant distributions in southern Australia, and therefore collected specimens of a range of plant species. On 22 October, he collected a specimen of "B. epica" in old flower, but incorrectly identified it as "B. media", and later lodged it in the <a href="herbarium">herbarium</a> at <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> under that name.

In 1985, two volunteer field collectors for "<a href="The%20Banksia%20Atlas">The Banksia Atlas</a>" project, John and Lalage Falconer of <a href="Esperance%2C%20Western%20Australia">Esperance</a>, became convinced that there were three "Banksia" species rather than two at <a href="Point%20Culver">Point Culver</a>. Returning to the locality on 9 January 1986, they collected leaves and old flowers of what they thought was an undescribed species. The specimens did indeed suggest that a new species had been discovered, but they were not sufficient for formal publication. Early in May the following year, John Falconer drove over 2000 kilometres on unsealed tracks from <a href="Warburton%2C%20Western%20Australia">Warburton</a> to Point Culver and back again, in order to collect fresh flowers and fruit of the purported new species. <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> then began preparing a formal description of the species. During his research, he discovered that Nelson's Toolinna Cove specimen was also referable to the undescribed species. In the absence of any genuine "B. media" specimens from Toolinna Cove, George inferred that only "B. epica" occurred there, and that Eyre must have sighted "B. epica" in 1841. In 1988, he published a formal description of the species, naming it "Banksia epica" in reference to the two "epic" journeys of Eyre and Falconer. Thus the species' full name is "Banksia epica" A.S.George. It was later established that both "B. epica" and "B. media" occur at Toolinna Cove.

George placed "B. epica" in <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subg. "Banksia"</a>, because its inflorescences are typical "Banksia" flower spikes; <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"B." sect. "Banksia"</a> because of its straight <a href="style%20%28botany%29">styles</a>; and <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Cyrtostylis">"B." ser. "Cyrtostylis"</a> because it has slender flowers. He considered its closest relatives to be "<a href="Banksia%20praemorsa">B. praemorsa</a>" (cut-leaf banksia) and "B. media", both of which have shorter flowers and smaller pollen-presenters than "B. epica". In addition, "B. praemorsa" differs in having a hairless perianth, and "B. media" has larger, more undulate leaves.

In 1996, <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published the results of a <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis of <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> characters of "Banksia". They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. George's "B." ser. "Cyrtostylis" was found to be "widely <a href="polyphyly">polyphyletic</a>", as six of the fourteen taxa in that series occurred singly in locations throughout Thiele and Ladiges' <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a>. The remaining eight formed a <a href="clade">clade</a> that further resolved into two subclades, with "B. epica" appeared in one of them:
Thiele and Ladiges preferred to give series rank to the subclades, rather than the entire clade, so they transferred the taxa of the second clade into <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Ochraceae">"B." ser. "Ochraceae"</a>, retaining only the taxa of the first clade in "B." ser. "Cyrtostylis". "B. epica"s placement under <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement</a> may be summarised as follows:

The arrangement of Thiele and Ladiges was not accepted by George, and was discarded in his 1999 revision. 
Under <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">George's 1999 arrangement</a>, "B. epica"s placement was as follows:

Since 1998, <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for the subtribe <a href="Banksiinae">Banksiinae</a>. His analyses suggest a <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements. With respect to "B. epica", however, Mast's results accord closely with the arrangement of Thiele and Ladiges, placing it in a <a href="polytomous">polytomous</a> clade corresponding exactly with Thiele and Ladiges' "B." ser. "Cyrtostylis".

Early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring "Dryandra" to "Banksia", and publishing "B." subg. "Spathulatae" for the species having spoon-shaped <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s; in this way they also redefined the <a href="autonym%20%28botany%29">autonym</a> <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subg. "Banksia"</a>. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. epica" is placed in "B." subg. "Banksia".

"Banksia epica" is known only from two populations in eastern parts of the <a href="Esperance%20Plains">Esperance Plains</a> region of the <a href="South%20West%20Botanical%20Province">South West Botanical Province</a>, near the western edge of the Great Australian Bight. The main population occurs about 30 kilometres (20 mi) west of Point Culver; there were over 2000 plants there when surveyed in June 1989. A smaller population occurs about 70 kilometres (45 mi) further east at Toolinna Cove; when surveyed in August 1991, this locality had around 350 plants. This latter population represents the easternmost limit of the western "Banksia" species; east of Toolinna Cove no "Banksia" species occurs for over 900 kilometres (550 mi).

In both localities, "B. epica" occurs among <a href="Heath%20%28habitat%29">heath</a> on <a href="cliff-top%20dune">cliff-top dune</a>s of deep, white <a href="silica">siliceous</a> <a href="sand">sand</a> over <a href="limestone">limestone</a>. It co-occurs with "B. media" in both localities, and "B. praemorsa" is also present at Point Culver. Toolinna Cove sand is somewhat <a href="alkaline">alkaline</a>, making "B. epica" and "B. media" the only "Banksia" species that grow in alkaline soil.

These two localities are unusual in having cliff-top dunes of siliceous sand: cliff-top dunes are an unusual <a href="topography">topographic</a> formation, and nearly all soil in the area is <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a>. As "Banksia" species are intolerant of calcareous soils, and are not adapted to long range <a href="biological%20dispersal">seed dispersal</a>, the two populations of "B. epica" appear to be reproductively isolated. Nelson has suggested that there was once a continuous strip of siliceous sand along the coast, providing an extensive and unfragmented habitat for "B. epica"; <a href="sea%20level%20rise">rises</a> in the <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a> had submerged this strip, leaving only the cliff-top dunes as suitable habitat. The fact that the resultant isolated populations have not perceptibly <a href="speciation">speciated</a> since then suggests that the species has been fragmented for only a short time, perhaps only since the <a href="Last%20Glacial%20Maximum">Last Glacial Maximum</a>.

<a href="Pollinator">Pollinator</a>s of "B. epica" include "<a href="Phylidonyris%20novaehollandiae">Phylidonyris novaehollandiae</a>" (New Holland honeyeater) and "<a href="Acanthiza%20chrysorrhoa">Acanthiza chrysorrhoa</a>" (yellow-rumped thornbill). No other pollinators have been recorded, but the species is poorly surveyed, and studies of other "Banksia" species have consistently indicated a wide range of <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> and <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> pollinators. For example, a survey of the closely related and co-occurring "B. media" found that "honeyeater birds and marsupial nectarivores were abundant in the study area and most carried the pollen of "Banksia media" while it flowered.… Self-pollination and pollination by insects clearly also play major roles in seed production."

Like most other <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>, "B. epica" has <a href="proteoid%20root">proteoid root</a>s, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These enhance <a href="solubility">solubilisation</a> of <a href="nutrient">nutrient</a>s, allowing nutrient <a href="mineral%20uptake">uptake</a> in low-nutrient soils such as the <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>-deficient native soils of <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. The species lacks a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>, so is thought to be killed by fire. Like most "Banksia" species, however, it is adapted to release its <a href="aerial%20seed%20bank">aerial seed bank</a> following a bushfire, so populations regenerate rapidly. It is highly susceptible to "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>" dieback.

Because so few populations are known, "B. epica" has been listed on the <a href="Department%20of%20Environment%20and%20Conservation%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Department of Environment and Conservation</a>'s <a href="Declared%20Rare%20and%20Priority%20Flora%20List">Declared Rare and Priority Flora List</a> as "Priority Two – Poorly Known Taxa""; and as 2RC under the <a href="ROTAP">ROTAP</a> system (rare but not currently endangered or vulnerable, and having a range less than 100 km). It is not considered to be under threat, however, because both known populations occur within the <a href="Nuytsland%20Nature%20Reserve">Nuytsland Nature Reserve</a>, and are undisturbed and healthy. Furthermore, the area in which it occurs is poorly surveyed, so it is possible that other populations exist.

"B. epica" is fairly new to cultivation. Kevin Collins of the Banksia Farm in <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany, Western Australia</a> is said to have pioneered its cultivation, growing it in loamy clay or sandy gravel. It showed good tolerance for alkaline soils in those conditions, and has also succeeded in sandy, alkaline soil near the coast between <a href="Mandurah%2C%20Western%20Australia">Mandurah</a> and <a href="Kwinana%2C%20Western%20Australia">Kwinana</a>. The <a href="Australian%20National%20Botanic%20Gardens">Australian National Botanic Gardens</a> in Canberra has also had some success in cultivating the species. Seeds were sown in February 1996, and planted out in November 1997; seedlings planted into sections without good drainage died, but two seedlings that were planted into a section with excellent drainage were about a metre tall by 2002, and flowering prolifically.

Propagation is by seed or cuttings. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 14 to 49 days to <a href="germinate">germinate</a>. In the absence of further information specific to "B. epica", George recommends that cultivated plants be treated as for "B. media" and "B. praemorsa", both of which require a sunny position in well drained soil, and tolerate only light pruning not below the green foliage.

Irreplaceable

"Irreplaceable" is a song recorded by American singer <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a> for her second studio album, "<a href="B%27Day%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20album%29">B'Day</a>" (2006). The song was written by <a href="Ne-Yo">Shaffer "Ne-Yo" Smith</a>, <a href="Stargate%20%28production%20team%29">Tor Erik Hermansen, Mikkel, S. Eriksen</a>, <a href="Espionage%20%28production%20team%29">Espen Lind, Amund Bjørklund</a>, Beyoncé and produced by <a href="Stargate%20%28production%20team%29">Stargate</a> and Beyoncé. "Irreplaceable" was originally a <a href="country%20music">country</a> record; it was re-arranged as a mid-<a href="tempo">tempo</a> <a href="ballad">ballad</a> with pop and R&B influences by modifying the vocal arrangements and instrumentation. During the production and recording sessions, Beyoncé and Ne-Yo wanted to create a record which people of either gender could relate to. The song's lyrics are about the breakdown of a relationship with an unfaithful man and the song contains a message about <a href="Women%27s%20rights">female empowerment</a>.

Following the moderate chart performances of "<a href="D%C3%A9j%C3%A0%20Vu%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20song%29">Déjà Vu</a>" and "<a href="Ring%20the%20Alarm">Ring the Alarm</a>", "Irreplaceable" was released internationally on October 23, 2006 as the album's second <a href="single%20%28music%29">single</a>, and the third in the United States on December 5, 2006. The single was released through <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>. "<a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a>" and "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" placed it on their lists of Best Songs of the 2000s. "Irreplaceable" won several awards, including Best R&B/Soul Single at the 2007 <a href="Soul%20Train%20Music%20Awards">Soul Train Music Awards</a>. It was nominated for the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Record%20of%20the%20Year">Record of the Year</a> award at the <a href="50th%20Grammy%20Awards">50th Grammy Awards</a>.

The single became Beyoncé's fourth number-one in the U.S., was "B'Day"s most successful release, and remained at the top of the U.S. <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> chart for ten consecutive weeks. "Irreplaceable" was the twenty-fifth most successful song of the 2000s (decade) in the U.S., and was <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">certified</a> double-platinum by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA). It became Beyoncé's second single to achieve 200 million audience impressions in 2006. She is the second singer to achieve this feat in the U.S., the first having been <a href="Mariah%20Carey">Mariah Carey</a> in 2005. "Irreplaceable" peaked at number one in Australia, at number four in the United Kingdom, and reached the top twenty in several European countries. "Irreplaceable" was 2007's tenth best-selling digital single with over 4.6 million copies sold worldwide.

The single's accompanying <a href="music%20video">music video</a> was directed by <a href="Anthony%20Mandler">Anthony Mandler</a> and served as the debut performance of Beyoncé's all-female band, Suga Mama. The video was included on the 2007 "<a href="B%27Day%20Anthology%20Video%20Album">B'Day Anthology Video Album</a>", and a video edit was produced for "Irreemplazable", the Spanish version of the song. It won the Video of the Year award at the 2007 <a href="Black%20Entertainment%20Television">Black Entertainment Television</a> (BET) Awards, and was nominated for the <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Video%20of%20the%20Year">MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year</a> at the <a href="2007%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2007 Awards</a>. "Irreplaceable" has regularly featured in Beyoncé's tours and live performances since 2006. The <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Composers%2C%20Authors%20and%20Publishers">American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers</a> (ASCAP) recognized the song as one of the most performed of 2007 at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards.

"Irreplaceable" was written for <a href="Chrisette%20Michele">Chrisette Michele</a>. Production team <a href="Stargate%20%28production%20team%29">Stargate</a> and singer-songwriter <a href="Ne-Yo">Ne-Yo</a> had written for Beyoncé's second album "B'Day", but Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate said that they might not have gone in the direction they did on the song. The tune did not suit Beyoncé's voice, and Ne-Yo wrote the lyrics from a male perspective, although it was not based upon his personal experiences. Ne-Yo wrote the song in the <a href="country%20music">country</a> style, thinking of country singers <a href="Shania%20Twain">Shania Twain</a> and <a href="Faith%20Hill">Faith Hill</a> during the sessions. When Ne-Yo heard them playing the song with a <a href="guitar">guitar</a>, he thought it sounded like country music. But when the drums were incorporated into the music, it was brought to an <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> vibe, and Ne-Yo considered making an R&B-country western music song instead.

When the team worked with Ne-Yo, they recorded the song with a male vocalist. However, they thought a female vocalist would be more suitable, and Ne-Yo also thought that it was empowering for a woman to sing it. Eriksen of Stargate said it was an <a href="Artists%20and%20repertoire">A&R</a> person who suggested that the song would work better when sung by a woman. Two labels wanted the song. While Beyoncé worked on material for "B'Day", she was pleased with the <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demo</a> of the "Irreplaceable" that was presented to her. However, "Irreplaceable" did not seem to fit on "B'Day", which was supposed to be "a hard-hitting club album". <a href="Swizz%20Beatz">Swizz Beatz</a>, who was working on the album, declared that Beyoncé would be crazy not to include the song on the record. Beyoncé asked for changes to the song, including the addition of drums, vocal arrangements, and singing in a higher register than the demo. <a href="Espen%20Lind">Espen Lind</a> and Amund Bjørklund, from the Norwegian production team <a href="Espionage%20%28production%20team%29">Espionage</a>, wrote the <a href="Chord%20progression">chord structure</a> and the guitar part. In an interview with <a href="MTV">MTV</a>, Ne-Yo said, "Beyoncé had some stuff that she wanted to get off her chest", while aiming to make a record that women could relate to, in keeping with the theme of the album.

The recording was engineered by Jim Caruana and mixed by Jason Goldstein at <a href="Sony%20Music%20Studios">Sony Music Studios</a> in New York City. Goldstein was hired to mix "B'Day". He said: "This song was really simple to mix. It was produced by Stargate and the sounds are really good and they all made sense, and there was lots of room for all the instruments." Goldstein used a board <a href="Equalization%20%28audio%29">equalizer</a> for the drums' treatment. For the acoustic guitars, he used the <a href="Analogue%20electronics">analogue</a> <a href="Flanging">flanger</a> of a <a href="TC%20Electronic">TC 1210</a> spatial expander "to sweeten the sound" and to give them "a little bit more spread". Goldstein thought "Irreplaceable" sounded "a bit old-school"; an <a href="eighth%20note">eighth note</a> <a href="Delay%20%28audio%20effect%29">delay</a> <a href="Echo%23In%20music">echo</a> was placed on the song's <a href="lead%20vocalist">lead vocal</a> at 341ms, using the <a href="Line%206%20%28company%29">"Echo Farm"</a> <a href="Plug-in%20%28computing%29">plug-in</a> software. For the backing vocals, Goldstein used "Echo Farm" with a <a href="quarter%20note">quarter note</a> delay at 682ms and Sony's "Oxford Dynamics" <a href="Audio%20compression%20%28data%29">compressor</a>/<a href="limiter">limiter</a> in dual-mono mode.

The compressor was placed in Classic setting, to emulate the <a href="LA-2A%20Leveling%20Amplifier">LA-2A</a> <a href="leveler">leveling amplifier</a>, and the Warmth button used to add harmonics. "Oxford Dynamics" was used for the bass in a different setting. Goldstein passed the final mix through the "Oxford EQ" and "Inflator" plug-ins. <a href="Pro%20Tools">Pro Tools</a> software was used to print the <a href="Aux-send">aux track</a> into a <a href="44%2C100%20Hz">44.1kHz</a>/<a href="24-bit">24-bit</a> CD and then into a 24-bit <a href="Audio%20mastering">CD master</a>. After the sessions for "Irreplaceable" ended, Hermansen said that "everyone felt they had captured something special and that Beyoncé had done the track justice", but there were still concerns that urban radio might not play the song as it featured acoustic guitars and had more of a pop appeal. "But then it became the biggest urban record ... ever," [Hermansen] said.

A controversy arose over the writing credits on "Irreplaceable". Ne-Yo told MTV: "Apparently Beyoncé was at a show somewhere and right before the song came on she said, 'I wrote this for all my ladies' and then the song came on ... The song is a co-write. I wrote the lyrics, I wrote all the lyrics. Beyoncé helped me with the melodies and the harmonies and the vocal arrangement and that makes it a co-write. Meaning my contribution and her contribution made that song what it is." In 2011, Ne-Yo said that he wrote the song for himself, but thought that it would be better suited for Beyoncé. Some of Beyoncé's fans read Ne-Yo's remark as disrespectful towards her. However, he clarified his comment later through <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>, writing, "I said I originally wrote the song for me. ... Once I realized how the song comes across if sung by a guy, that's when I decided to give it away."

"Irreplaceable" is a mid-<a href="tempo">tempo</a> <a href="ballad">ballad</a> with <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> and R&B influences. Written in the <a href="key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="B-flat%20major">B major</a>, the <a href="beat%20%28music%29">beat</a> is set in <a href="time%20signature">common time</a> and moves at a moderate 88 beats per minute. Beyoncé's <a href="vocal%20range">vocal range</a> in the song spans nearly two and a half <a href="octave">octave</a>s, from B to E. While most of the songs on the album are aggressive and <a href="Glossary%20of%20musical%20terminology">uptempo</a>, her voice on "Irreplaceable" is toned down. "Irreplaceable" uses a gently strummed acoustic guitar, following the B–F–Cm–E <a href="Chord%20%28music%29">chord</a> series. Hermansen and Eriksen combined the classic chord progression on an acoustic guitar, a modern-sounding <a href="Roland%20TR-808">808</a> drum beat and cellos. Al Shipley of "<a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus Magazine</a>" noted that the guitar strum can be found in <a href="Rihanna">Rihanna</a>'s 2007 single "<a href="Hate%20That%20I%20Love%20You">Hate That I Love You</a>", a song co-produced by Stargate and Ne-Yo. Rob Sheffield of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" wrote that <a href="Chris%20Brown">Chris Brown</a>'s 2007 single "<a href="With%20You%20%28Chris%20Brown%20song%29">With You</a>", another Stargate-produced song, also features the same element. He wrote, "'With You' is the convincer, even if you can instantly tell that producer Stargate was just trying to roll out 'Irreplaceable' one more time." while "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine wrote that it "leans a bit too heavily" to the song.
Jim DeRogatis of the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" wrote that "Irreplaceable" resembles ballads sung by <a href="Whitney%20Houston">Whitney Houston</a>. Spence D. of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> wrote that the song was inspired by <a href="Aretha%20Franklin">Aretha Franklin</a>'s work since "Irreplaceable" consists of several variations in <a href="guttural">guttural</a>s and octave range. The lyrics of "Irreplaceable" concern the breakdown of a woman's relationship with her boyfriend after she discovers his infidelity, and the song "sounds a lot like a statement of independence". Sarah Rodman of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" wrote, "With a heretofore unknown grasp of nuance, Beyonce combines heartache, bravado, and anger as she tells a cad he's far from irreplaceable—and that, in fact, her new man will be arriving momentarily." Hermansen said that "Irreplaceable" is a song that "people from all walks of life can enjoy". Beyoncé said that the song is "a little honest", and, "... basically we can't forget our power and our worth. And sometimes you're so in love, you forget that. And sometimes you feel like you're not being appreciated. And sometimes they forget that they can be replaced."

The song's lyrics are constructed in the verse-pre-chorus-chorus form. It begins with guitar strumming, and Beyoncé sings the <a href="Hook%20%28music%29">hook</a>-<a href="Introduction%20%28music%29">intro</a>, "To the left, to the left: everything you own in a box to the left". In bar seven, she sings the first verse, arguing with her boyfriend about the indifference of their relationship, and tells him to walk away. The pre-chorus and chorus follow, "You must not know 'bout me ... I can have another you by tomorrow / I could have another you in a minute ... Don't you ever for a second get to thinking / You're irreplaceable". In the second verse, Beyoncé recollects the moment she discovered her boyfriend's infidelity. The same pattern leads to the second chorus. Towards the end, Beyoncé sings the <a href="bridge%20%28music%29">bridge</a>, where she tells her lover, "Replacing you is so easy". The song closes with an <a href="Ad%20libitum">ad-libbed</a> chorus. "The Boston Globe" noted that Beyoncé sings some parts of it in a higher register "that complements the lyrics' wounded sensibility".

During the production of "Irreplaceable", Hermansen thought that the track would not receive radio play because of the acoustic guitars, and deemed the song too pop-oriented. Hermansen did not expect "Irreplaceable" to conform to any genre. Despite his prediction, the song became successful on <a href="urban%20contemporary">urban</a> charts. It was played in New York and on country radio stations. Shortly after the release of "Irreplaceable", Beyoncé told MTV: "I love 'Irreplaceable'. I think it's important to have those songs. I've had so many people come up to me in tears, saying, 'I experienced my first breakup. If it wasn't for the song, I wouldn't be strong enough to not call. I wouldn't know how much I'm worth.' I'm happy to be a part of that."

Jody Rosen of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" noted "Irreplaceable" to be "a lilting tune unlike anything Beyoncé has ever performed". Sarah Rodman of "The Boston Globe" wrote that the song is "gentle but maddeningly hook-y". Spence Abbott of IGN wrote that "Irreplaceable" and "Resentment" go for "a much more traditional contemporary R&B vibe" than any of the previous tracks on "B'Day", making them stand out as if they were recorded separately from the rest of the album.

Roger Friedman of <a href="Fox%20News%20Channel">Fox News Channel</a> wrote that "Irreplaceable" is a "clever ballad" and the most memorable track on "B'Day". He added that it has the most potential of catching on with fans quickly, and that it is the only song on the album that "you might actually want to sing along to". Mike Joseph of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> commented that "'Irreplaceable' tellingly, was co-written by Ne-Yo, who may not be the powerhouse vocalist Beyonce is, but has significantly stronger songwriting skills. It's the best song on the album—perhaps Ms. Knowles should take a hint." Tim Finney of "<a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a>", called "Irreplaceable" the best song on "B'Day" and praised its overall production, writing:

Before, Beyoncé's approach to heartbreak was always literal, her voice and her words declaiming her feelings with a studied earnestness that at times was difficult to believe, let alone connect with. 'Irreplaceable' is the first song in which Beyoncé lies to herself, and the way her voice perfectly betrays that lie (revealing a giveaway tremble in the stiff upper lip of the lyrics) simultaneously renders it her most sophisticated and her most honest performance to date.
Mark Edward Nero ranked it as the ninth best R&B song of 2006, and wrote, "This song has modern-day classic written all over it." "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" listed it 18 on their list of best songs of 2006. Staff members of "Pitchfork Media" ranked the song on their list of The Top 100 Tracks of 2006 at number 45. Shaheem Reid, Jayson Rodriguez and Rahman Dukes of MTV News placed the song at number 3 on their year-end list of 27 Essential R&B Songs of 2007.

In 2009, Ryan Schreiber ranked "Irreplaceable" at number 183 on his list of Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s (decade). Barry Schwartz of "Stylus" Magazine wrote that "Irreplaceable" recaptured Beyoncé's 2003 debut single "<a href="Crazy%20in%20Love">Crazy in Love</a>"'s near-perfection, describing it as "gentle but defiant", and further wrote, "Through some breezy strums and a sweet plaintive melody Beyonce delivers her most genuinely emotional vocal to date, equal parts vulnerable, upset, pissed off, vindictive, resigned, and apathetic." "Rolling Stone" ranked the song at number 60 on its list of 100 Best Songs of the 2000s.

"Irreplaceable" won the award for Best R&B/Soul Single, Female, at the 2007 <a href="Soul%20Train%20Music%20Awards">Soul Train Music Award</a>, and the 'Favorite Song' award at the 2007 <a href="Nickelodeon%20Kids%27%20Choice%20Awards">Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards</a>.

"Irreplaceable" was <a href="music%20video%20director">directed</a> by <a href="Anthony%20Mandler">Anthony Mandler</a>, who co-directed the video of "Get Me Bodied". The video features the debut performance of Beyoncé's all-female band, Suga Mama, who also appeared in the "<a href="Green%20Light%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20song%29">Green Light</a>" music video. Her acting-then-ex-boyfriend in the video is model <a href="Bobby%20Roache">Bobby Roache</a>, who played police officer for the "Ring the Alarm" music video and warrior during <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a> and Beyoncé's live performance at the 2006 Fashion Rocks show. The video was included on the 2007 "<a href="B%27Day%20Anthology%20Video%20Album">B'Day Anthology Video Album</a>", and a video edit was produced for "Irreemplazable". Part of the video which shows Beyoncé dancing in silhouette in front of a glass door is inspired by a <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a> movie. Late in January 2008, "Irreemplazable" premiered on the MiTRL, a video countdown show on the bilingual channel MTV Tr3s.

The music video follows the storyline of the song's lyrics. "She told me to pack up all my stuff, I'm getting kicked out—the video starts off like that", said Roache. It opens with Beyoncé filing her nails in silence, as her ex-partner packs up his property, as Beyoncé orders him to leave. Mid-way in the video, Beyoncé follows her then-ex-boyfriend outside the house and leans on a 2007 <a href="Jaguar%20XK">Jaguar XK</a>. She appears to be pretentiously caressing him; only for the audience to find out that she is repossessing things she bought for him. He leaves her and the car, about to ride off in a taxi. Between cuts, Beyoncé manages herself in front of a mirror; putting on a lipstick, wearing huge curlers and a high-waisted skirt. There are additional beats mixed to the arrangement for the video version that can be heard, when Beyoncé sings with her all-female band, Suga Mama, towards the end. It ends with Beyoncé greeting her new boyfriend at the front door.

At the 2007 Soul Train Music Awards, the video was nominated for the <a href="Soul%20Train%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20R%26amp%3BB/Soul%20or%20Rap%20Music%20Video">Michael Jackson Award for Best R&B/Soul or Rap Music Video</a>, but lost to rapper (and husband) Jay-Z's "<a href="Show%20Me%20What%20You%20Got">Show Me What You Got</a>" video. The video received two nominations for Best Female Artist and Video of the Year at the <a href="MTV%20Australia%20Video%20Music%20Awards%202007">2007 MTV Australia Video Music Awards</a>.

Footage of Beyoncé's performance at the <a href="Staples%20Center">Staples Center</a>, Los Angeles was included on "<a href="The%20Beyonc%C3%A9%20Experience%20Live">The Beyoncé Experience Live!</a>" DVD (2007), and the deluxe edition of "I Am...

A writer of "Billboard" magazine commented that their cover was "ethereal". Ray Rahman of "Entertainment Weekly" described the cover as "really good!... Krauss also has a teen-pop background thanks to her Rubyblue days, so it's actually not that surprising that she can find her away around a Top 40 single so well." However, Maura Johnston of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" gave a negative review for the cover, saying: "Krauss sighs her way through the song, turning her voice into a mew that sounds like she was trying to sing along with the radio while not being heard by her roommates or anyone else outside of a six-inch radius... Also, some of the guitar chords are a bit off... it's sorta disappointing."

In 2007, <a href="Gregory%20and%20the%20Hawk">Gregory and the Hawk</a>, <a href="Taylor%20Swift">Taylor Swift</a>, and Filipina singer <a href="Sabrina%20%28Filipino%20singer%29">Sabrina</a> covered "Irreplaceable".

Regulamentul Organic (, "Organic Regulation"; ; ) was a <a href="Constitution%20of%20Romania">quasi-constitutional</a> <a href="organic%20law">organic law</a> enforced in 1834–1835 by the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Imperial Russian</a> authorities in <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a> and <a href="Wallachia">Wallachia</a> (the two <a href="Danubian%20Principalities">Danubian Principalities</a> that were to become the basis of the modern <a href="Romania">Romanian state</a>). The document partially confirmed the traditional government (including rule by the "<a href="hospodar">hospodar</a>s") and set up a common Russian <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a> which lasted until 1854. The "Regulament" itself remained in force until 1858. <a href="Conservatism">Conservative</a> in its scope, it also engendered a period of unprecedented reforms which provided a setting for the <a href="Westernization">Westernization</a> of the local society. The "Regulament" offered the two Principalities their first common system of government.

The two principalities, owing <a href="tribute">tribute</a> and progressively ceding political control to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> since the <a href="Romania%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, had been subject to frequent Russian interventions as early as the <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281710%E2%80%931711%29">Russo-Turkish War (1710–1711)</a>, when a Russian army penetrated Moldavia and <a href="List%20of%20Russian%20rulers">Emperor</a> <a href="Peter%20I%20of%20Russia">Peter the Great</a> probably established links with the Wallachians. Eventually, the Ottomans enforced a tighter control on the region, effected under <a href="Phanariotes">Phanariote</a> "hospodars" (who were appointed directly by the <a href="Ottoman%20Porte">Porte</a>). Ottoman rule over the region remained contested by competition from Russia, which, as an <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox</a> empire with claim to a <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> heritage, exercised notable influence over locals. At the same time, the Porte made several concessions to the rulers and boyars of Moldavia and Wallachia, as a means to ensure the preservation of its rule.

The <a href="Treaty%20of%20K%C3%BC%C3%A7%C3%BCk%20Kaynarca">Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca</a>, signed in 1774 between the Ottomans and Russians, gave Russia the right to intervene on behalf of Eastern Orthodox Ottoman subjects in general, a right which it used to sanction Ottoman interventions in the Principalities in particular. Thus, Russia intervened to preserve reigns of "hospodars" who had lost Ottoman approval in the context of the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> (the "<a href="casus%20belli">casus belli</a>" for the <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281806%E2%80%931812%29">1806–12 conflict</a>), and remained present in the Danubian states, vying for influence with the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a>, well into the 19th century and annexing Moldavia's <a href="Bessarabia">Bessarabia</a> in 1812.

Despite the influx of <a href="Greeks%20in%20Romania">Greeks</a>, arriving in the Principalities as a new <a href="bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a> favored by the "hospodars", the traditional <a href="Estates%20of%20the%20realm">Estates of the realm</a> (the "<a href="Sfatul%20boieresc">Divan</a>") remained under the tight control of a number of high <a href="boyar">boyar</a> families, who, while intermarrying with members of newly arrived communities, opposed reformist attempts – and successfully preserved their <a href="Privilege%20%28legal%20ethics%29">privilege</a>s by appealing against their competitors to both <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> and <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>.
In the last decades of the 18th century, the growing strategic importance of the region brought about the establishment of <a href="consul%20%28representative%29">consulates</a> representing European powers directly interested in observing local developments (Russia, the Austrian Empire, and <a href="France">France</a>; later, <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">British</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussian</a> ones were opened as well). An additional way for consuls to exercise particular policies was the awarding of a privileged status and protection to various individuals, who were known as "<a href="sudi%C8%9Bi">sudiți</a>" ("subjects", in the language of the time) of one or the other of the foreign powers.

A seminal event occurred in 1821, when the rise of Greek <a href="nationalism">nationalism</a> in various parts of the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> in connection with the <a href="Greek%20War%20of%20Independence">Greek War of Independence</a> led to occupation of the two states by the <a href="Filiki%20Eteria">Filiki Eteria</a>, a Greek <a href="secret%20society">secret society</a> who sought, and initially obtained, Russian approval. A mere takeover of the government in Moldavia, the Eterist expedition met a more complex situation in Wallachia, where a <a href="Regent">regency</a> of high boyars attempted to have the anti-Ottoman Greek nationalists confirm both their rule and the rejection of Phanariote institutions. A compromise was achieved through their common support for <a href="Tudor%20Vladimirescu">Tudor Vladimirescu</a>, an <a href="Oltenia">Oltenia</a>n "<a href="Vladimirescu%27s%20Pandur">pandur</a>" leader who had already instigated an <a href="Wallachian%20uprising%20of%201821">anti-Phanariote rebellion</a> (as one of the Russian "sudiți", it was hoped that Vladimirescu could assure Russia that the revolt was not aimed against its influence). However, the eventual withdrawal of Russian support made Vladimirescu seek a new agreement with the Ottomans, leaving him to be executed by an alliance of Eterists and weary locals (alarmed by his new anti-boyar program); after the Ottomans invaded the region and crushed the Eteria, the boyars, still perceived as a third party, obtained from the Porte an end to the Phanariote system

The first reigns through locals – <a href="Ioan%20Sturdza">Ioniță Sandu Sturdza</a> as <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Moldavia">Prince of Moldavia</a> and <a href="Grigore%20IV%20Ghica">Grigore IV Ghica</a> as <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Wallachia">Prince of Wallachia</a> – were, in essence, short-lived: although the <a href="clientelism">patron-client relation</a> between Phanariote "hospodars" and a foreign ruler was never revived, Sturdza and Ghica were deposed by the Russian military intervention during the <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%2C%201828%E2%80%931829">Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829</a>. Sturdza's time on the throne was marked by an important internal development: the last in a series of constitutional proposals, advanced by boyars as a means to curb princely authority, ended in a clear conflict between the rapidly decaying class of low-ranking boyars (already forming the upper level of the <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a> rather than a segment of the traditional nobility) and the high-ranking families who had obtained the decisive say in politics. The proponent, <a href="Ionic%C4%83%20T%C4%83utu">Ionică Tăutu</a>, was defeated in the "Divan" after the Russian consul sided with the conservatives (expressing the official view that the <a href="mixed%20government">aristocratic-republican</a> and <a href="Liberalism%20and%20radicalism%20in%20Romania">liberal</a> aims of the document could have threatened international conventions in place).

On October 7, 1826, the Ottoman Empire — anxious to prevent Russia's intervention in the Greek Independence War — negotiatied with it a new status for the region in <a href="Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi">Akkerman</a>, one which conceded to several requests of the inhabitants: the resulting "<a href="Akkerman%20Convention">Akkerman Convention</a>" was the first official document to nullify the principle of Phanariote reigns, instituting seven-year terms for new princes elected by the respective "Divans", and awarding the two countries the right to engage in unrestricted <a href="international%20trade">international trade</a> (as opposed to the tradition of limitations and Ottoman <a href="protectionism">protectionism</a>, it only allowed Istanbul to impose its priorities in the <a href="grain%20trade">grain trade</a>). The convention also made the first mention of new "Statutes", enforced by both powers as governing documents, which were not drafted until after the war – although both Sturdza and Ghica had appointed commissions charged with adopting such projects.

The Russian military presence on the Principalities' soil was inaugurated in the first days of the war: by late April 1828, the Russian army of <a href="Peter%20Wittgenstein">Peter Wittgenstein</a> had reached the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> (in May, it entered present-day <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>). The campaign, prolonged for the following year and coinciding with devastating <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a> and <a href="cholera">cholera</a> epidemics (which together killed around 1.6% of the population in both countries), soon became a drain on local economy: according to British observers, the Wallachian state was required to indebt itself to European creditors for a total sum of ten million "<a href="piastre">piastre</a>s", in order to provide for the Russian army's needs. Accusations of widespread plunder were made by the French author <a href="Marc%20Girardin">Marc Girardin</a>, who travelled in the region during the 1830s; Girardin alleged that Russian troops had confiscated virtually all cattle for their needs, and that Russian officers had insulted the political class by publicly stating that, in case the supply in oxen was to prove insufficient, boyars were to be tied to carts in their place – an accusation backed by <a href="Ion%20Ghica">Ion Ghica</a> in his recollections. He also recorded a mounting dissatifaction with the new rule, mentioning that peasants were especially upset by the continuous maneuvers of troops inside the Principalities' borders. Overall, <a href="Russophilia">Russophilia</a> in the two Principalities appears to have suffered a major blow. Despite the confiscations, statistics of the time indicated that the pace of growth in heads of cattle remained steady (a 50% growth appears to have occurred between 1831 and 1837).

The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Adrianople%20%281829%29">Treaty of Adrianople</a>, signed on September 14, 1829, confirmed both the Russian victory and the provisions of the Akkerman Convention, partly amended to reflect the Russian political ascendancy over the area. Furthermore, Wallachia's southern border was settled on the Danube <a href="thalweg">thalweg</a>, and the state was given control over the previously Ottoman-ruled ports of <a href="Br%C4%83ila">Brăila</a>, <a href="Giurgiu">Giurgiu</a>, and <a href="Turnu%20M%C4%83gurele">Turnu Măgurele</a>. The freedom of commerce (which consisted mainly of grain exports from the region) and freedom of navigation on the river and on the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> were passed into law, allowing for the creation of <a href="naval%20fleet">naval fleet</a>s in both Principalities in the following years, as well as for a more direct contact with European traders, with the confirmation of the Moldavia and Wallachia's commercial privileges first stipulated at Akkerman (alongside the tight links soon established with Austrian and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Piedmont-Sardinia">Sardinian</a> traders, the first French ships visited Wallachia in 1830).

Russian occupation over Moldavia and Wallachia (as well as the Bulgarian town of <a href="Silistra">Silistra</a>) was prolonged pending the payment of <a href="war%20reparation">war reparation</a>s by the Ottomans. <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Russia">Emperor</a> <a href="Nicholas%20I%20of%20Russia">Nicholas I</a> assigned <a href="Fyodor%20Petrovich%20Pahlen">Fyodor Pahlen</a> as governor over the two countries before the actual peace, as the first in a succession of three "Plenipotentiary Presidents of the Divans in Moldavia and Wallachia", and official supervisor of the two commissions charged with drafting the "Statutes". The bodies, having for secretaries <a href="Gheorghe%20Asachi">Gheorghe Asachi</a> in Moldavia and <a href="Barbu%20Dimitrie%20%C8%98tirbei">Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei</a> in Wallachia, had resumed their work while the cholera epidemic was still raging, and continued it after Pahlen had been replaced with <a href="Pyotr%20Zheltukhin">Pyotr Zheltukhin</a> in February 1829.

The post-Adrianople state of affairs was perceived by many of the inhabitants of Wallachia and Moldavia as exceptionally abusive, given that Russia confiscated both of the Principalities' <a href="treasury">treasuries</a>, and that Zheltukhin used his position to interfere in the proceedings of the commission, nominated his own choice of members, and silenced all opposition by having anti-Russian boyars expelled from the countries (including, notably, <a href="Iancu%20V%C4%83c%C4%83rescu">Iancu Văcărescu</a>, a member of the Wallachian "<a href="Sfatul%20boieresc">Divan</a>" who had questioned his methods of government). According to the <a href="radicalism%20%28historical%29">radical</a> Ghica, "General Zheltukhin [and his subordinates] defended all Russian abuse and injustice. Their system consisted in never listening to complaints, but rather rushing in with accusations, so as to inspire fear, so as the plaintiff would run away for fear of not having to endure a harsher thing than the cause of his [original] complaint". However, the same source also indicated that this behaviour was hiding a more complex situation: "Those who nevertheless knew Zheltukhin better… said that he was the fairest, most honest, and most kind of men, and that he gave his cruel orders with an aching heart. Many gave assurance that he had addressed to the emperor heart-breaking reports on the deplorable state in which the Principalities were to be found, in which he stated that Russia's actions in the Principalities deserved the scorn of the entire world".

The third and last Russian governor, <a href="Pavel%20Kiselyov">Pavel Kiselyov</a> (or "Kiseleff"), took office on October 19, 1829, and faced his first major task in dealing with the last outbreaks of plague and cholera, as well as the threat of <a href="famine">famine</a>, with which he dealt by imposing <a href="quarantine">quarantine</a>s and importing grain from <a href="Odessa">Odessa</a>. His administration, lasting until April 1, 1834, was responsible for the most widespread and influential reforms of the period, and coincided with the actual enforcement of the new legislation. The earliest of Kiselyov's celebrated actions was the convening of the Wallachian "Divan" in November 1829, with the assurance that abuses were not to be condoned anymore.

"Regulamentul Organic" was adopted in its two very similar versions on July 13, 1831 (<a href="Old%20Style%20and%20New%20Style%20dates">July 1, OS</a>) in Wallachia and January 13, 1832 (January 1, OS) in Moldavia, after having minor changes applied to it in Saint Petersburg (where a second commission from the Principalities, presided by <a href="Mihail%20Sturdza">Mihail Sturdza</a> and <a href="Alexandru%20Vilara">Alexandru Vilara</a>, assessed it further). Its <a href="ratification">ratification</a> by <a href="Ottoman%20Dynasty">Sultan</a> <a href="Mahmud%20II">Mahmud II</a> was not a requirement from Kiselyov's perspective, who began enforcing it as a "<a href="fait%20accompli">fait accompli</a>" before this was granted. The final version of the document sanctioned the first local government abiding by the principles of <a href="separation%20of%20powers">separation</a> and <a href="balance%20of%20powers">balance of powers</a>. The "<a href="hospodars">hospodars</a>", elected for life (and not for the seven-year term agreed in the "<a href="Convention%20of%20Akkerman">Convention of Akkerman</a>") by an Extraordinary Assembly which comprised <a href="representation%20%28politics%29">representatives</a> of merchants and <a href="guild">guild</a>s, stood for the <a href="executive%20%28government%29">executive</a>, with the right to nominate ministers (whose offices were still referred to using the <a href="Historical%20Romanian%20ranks%20and%20titles">traditional titles of courtiers</a>) and <a href="public%20official">public official</a>s; "hospodars" were to be voted in office by an <a href="electoral%20college">electoral college</a> with a confirmed majority of high-ranking boyars (in Wallachia, only 70 persons were members of the college).
Each National Assembly (approximate translation of "Adunarea Obștească"), inaugurated in 1831–2, was a <a href="legislature">legislature</a> itself under the control of high-ranking boyars, comprising 35 (in Moldavia) or 42 members (in Wallachia), voted into office by no more than 3,000 electors in each state; the <a href="judiciary">judiciary</a> was, for the very first time, removed from the control of "hospodars". In effect, the "Regulament" confirmed earlier steps leading to the eventual <a href="separation%20of%20church%20and%20state">separation of church and state</a>, and, although <a href="Romanian%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a> church authorities were confirmed a privileged position and a political say, the religious institution was closely supervised by the government (with the establishment of a quasi-<a href="salary%20expense">salary expense</a>).

A <a href="tax%20reform">fiscal reform</a> ensued, with the creation of a <a href="Tax%20per%20head">poll tax</a> (calculated per family), the elimination of most <a href="indirect%20tax">indirect tax</a>es, annual <a href="state%20budget">state budget</a>s (approved by the Assemblies) and the introduction of a <a href="civil%20list">civil list</a> in place of the "hospodars"' personal treasuries. New methods of <a href="bookkeeping">bookkeeping</a> were regulated, and the creation of <a href="national%20bank">national bank</a>s was projected, but, like the adoption of national <a href="fixed%20currency">fixed currencies</a>, was never implemented.

According to the historian <a href="Nicolae%20Iorga">Nicolae Iorga</a>, "The [boyar] <a href="oligarchy">oligarchy</a> was appeased [by the "Regulament"'s adoption]: a beautifully harmonious modern form had veiled the old <a href="Romania%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">medieval</a> structure…. The "<a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a>"… held no influence. As for the peasant, he lacked even the right to administer his own <a href="commune%20in%20Romania">commune</a>, he was not even allowed to vote for an Assembly deemed, as if in jest, «national»." Nevertheless, conservative boyars remained suspicious of Russian tutelage, and several expressed their fear that the regime was a step leading to the creation of a regional "<a href="guberniya">guberniya</a>" for the Russian Empire. Their mistrust was, in time, reciprocated by Russia, who relied on "hospodars" and the direct intervention of its consuls to push further reforms. Kiselyov himself voiced a plan for the region's <a href="annexation">annexation</a> to Russia, but the request was dismissed by his superiors.

Beginning with the reformist administration of Kiselyov, the two countries experienced a series of profound changes, political, social, as well as cultural.

Despite underrepresentation in politics, the <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a> swelled in numbers, profiting from a growth in trade which had increased the status of merchants. Under continuous competition from the "<a href="sudi%C8%9Bi">sudiți</a>", traditional guilds ("bresle" or "isnafuri") faded away, leading to a more competitive, purely <a href="capitalism">capitalist</a> environment. This nevertheless signified that, although the traditional <a href="Greeks%20in%20Romania">Greek</a> competition for <a href="Romanians">Romanian</a> merchants and artisans had become less relevant, locals continued to face one from Austrian subjects of various nationalities, as well as from a sizeable <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Romania">immigration of Jews</a> from the <a href="Galicia%20%28Central%20Europe%29">Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria</a> and Russia – prevented from settling in the countryside, Jews usually became keepers of <a href="inn">inn</a>s and <a href="tavern">tavern</a>s, and later both bankers and <a href="leasehold%20estate">leaseholders of estates</a>. In this context, an anti-<a href="Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20Romania">Catholic</a> sentiment was growing, based, according to <a href="Keith%20Hitchins">Keith Hitchins</a>, on the assumption that Catholicism and Austrian influence were closely related, as well as on a widespread preference for <a href="secularism">secularism</a>.
The Romanian middle class formed the basis for what was to become the <a href="Liberalism%20in%20Romania">liberal electorate</a>, and accounted for the <a href="xenophobia">xenophobic</a> discourse of the <a href="National%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Romania%2C%201875%29">National Liberal Party</a> during the latter's first decade of existence (between 1875 and <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>).

Urban development occurred at a very fast pace: overall, the urban population had doubled by 1850. Population estimates for <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, the capital of Wallachia, were about 70,000 inhabitants in 1831, 60,000 in 1851, and about 120,000 in 1859. For <a href="Ia%C8%99i">Iași</a>, the capital of Moldavia, the estimates were 60,000 inhabitants for 1831, 70,000 for 1851, and about 65,000 for 1859. <a href="Br%C4%83ila">Brăila</a> and <a href="Giurgiu">Giurgiu</a>, Danube ports returned to Wallachia by the Ottomans, as well as Moldavia's <a href="Gala%C8%9Bi">Galați</a>, grew from the grain trade to become prosperous cities. Kiselyov, who had centered his administration on Bucharest, paid full attention to its development, improving its infrastructure and services and awarding it, together with all other cities and towns, a local administration ("see <a href="History%20of%20Bucharest">History of Bucharest</a>"). <a href="Public%20works">Public works</a> were carried out in the urban sphere, as well as in the massive expansion of the transport and communications system.

The success of the grain trade was secured by a conservative take on property, which restricted the right of peasants to exploit for their own gain those plots of land they leased on boyar <a href="estate%20%28land%29">estates</a> (the "Regulament" allowed them to consume around 70% of the total harvest per plot leased, while boyars were allowed to use a third of their estate as they pleased, without any legal duty toward the neighbouring peasant workforce); at the same time, small properties, created after <a href="Constantine%20Mavrocordatos">Constantine Mavrocordatos</a> had abolished <a href="serfdom">serfdom</a> in the 1740s, proved less lucrative in the face of competition by large estates – boyars profited from the consequences, as more landowning peasants had to resort to leasing plots while still owing "<a href="corv%C3%A9e">corvée</a>s" to their lords. Confirmed by the "Regulament" at up to 12 days a year, the "corvée" was still less significant than in other parts of Europe; however, since peasants relied on cattle for alternative food supplies and financial resources, and <a href="pasture">pasture</a>s remained the exclusive property of boyars, they had to exchange right of use for more days of work in the respective boyar's benefit (as much as to equate the corresponding "corvée" requirements in <a href="Central%20Europe">Central Europe</a>an countries, without ever being enforced by laws). Several laws of the period display a particular concern in limiting the right of peasants to evade "corvées" by paying their equivalent in currency, thus granting the boyars a workforce to match a steady growth in grain demands on foreign markets.

In respect to pasture access, the "Regulament" divided peasants into three wealth-based categories: "fruntași" ("foremost people"), who, by definition, owned 4 <a href="working%20animal">working animal</a>s and one or more cows (allowed to use around 4 <a href="hectare">hectare</a>s of pasture); "mijlocași" ("middle people") – two working animals and one cow (around 2 hectares); "codași" ("backward people") – people who owned no property, and not allowed the use of pastures.

At the same time, the major <a href="demography">demographic</a> changes took their toll on the countryside. For the very first time, food supplies were no longer abundant in front of a <a href="population%20growth">population growth</a> ensured by, among other causes, the effective measures taken against epidemics; rural–urban migration became a noticeable phenomenon, as did the relative increase in <a href="urbanization">urbanization</a> of traditional rural areas, with an explosion of settlements around established <a href="fair">fair</a>s.
These processes also ensured that <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">industrialization</a> was minimal (although <a href="factory">factories</a> had first been opened during the <a href="Phanariotes">Phanariotes</a>): most revenues came from a highly productive agriculture based on peasant labour, and were invested back into agricultural production. In parallel, hostility between agricultural workers and landowners mounted: after an increase in <a href="lawsuit">lawsuit</a>s involving leaseholders and the decrease in quality of "corvée" outputs, resistance, hardened by the examples of <a href="Tudor%20Vladimirescu">Tudor Vladimirescu</a> and various "<a href="hajduk">hajduk</a>s", turned to <a href="sabotage">sabotage</a> and occasional violence. A more serious incident occurred in 1831, when around 60,000 peasants protested against projected <a href="conscription">conscription</a> criteria; Russian troops dispatched to quell the revolt killed around 300 people.

The most noted cultural development under the "Regulament" was Romanian <a href="Romantic%20nationalism">Romantic nationalism</a>, in close connection with <a href="Francophile">Francophilia</a>. <a href="Modernization">Institutional modernization</a> engered a renaissance of the <a href="intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a>. In turn, the concept of "<a href="nation">nation</a>" was first expanded beyond its coverage of the boyar category, and more members of the privileged displayed a concern in solving problems facing the peasantry: although rarer among the high-ranking boyars, the interest was shared by most <a href="progressivism">progressive</a> political figures by the 1840s.
Nationalist themes now included a preoccupation for the <a href="Origin%20of%20the%20Romanians">Latin origin of Romanians</a> and the common (but since discarded) reference to the entire region as "<a href="Dacia">Dacia</a>" (first notable in the title of <a href="Mihail%20Kog%C4%83lniceanu">Mihail Kogălniceanu</a>'s "<a href="Dacia%20Literar%C4%83">Dacia Literară</a>", a short-lived Romantic <a href="literary%20magazine">literary magazine</a> published in 1840). As a trans-border notion, "Dacia" also indicated a growth in Pan-Romanian sentiment – the latter had first been present in several boyar requests of the late 18th century, which had called for the union of the two <a href="Danubian%20Principalities">Danubian Principalities</a> under the protection of European powers (and, in some cases, under the rule of a foreign prince). To these was added the circulation of fake documents which were supposed to reflect the text of "<a href="Capitulations%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">Capitulations</a>" awarded by the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> to its Wallachian and Moldavian <a href="vassal">vassal</a>s in the <a href="Romania%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, claiming to stand out as proof of rights and privileges which had been long neglected ("see also <a href="Islam%20in%20Romania">Islam in Romania</a>").

<a href="Education%20in%20Romania">Education</a>, still accessible only to the wealthy, was first removed from the domination of the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek language</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Hellenism</a> upon the disestablishment of Phanariotes sometime after 1821; the attempts of <a href="Gheorghe%20Laz%C4%83r">Gheorghe Lazăr</a> (at the <a href="Saint%20Sava%20College">Saint Sava College</a>) and <a href="Gheorghe%20Asachi">Gheorghe Asachi</a> to engender a transition towards <a href="Romanian%20language">Romanian-language</a> teaching had been only moderately successful, but Wallachia became the scene of such a movement after the start of <a href="Ion%20Heliade%20R%C4%83dulescu">Ion Heliade Rădulescu</a>'s teaching career and the first issue of his newspaper, "<a href="Curierul%20Rom%C3%A2nesc">Curierul Românesc</a>". Moldavia soon followed, after Asachi began printing his highly influential magazine "<a href="Albina%20Rom%C3%A2neasc%C4%83">Albina Românească</a>". The "Regulament" brought about the creation of new schools, which were dominated by the figures of <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>n Romanians who had taken exile after expressing their dissatifaction with <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian</a> rule in their homeland – these teachers, who usually rejected the adoption of French cultural models in the otherwise <a href="conservatism">conservative</a> society (viewing the process as an unnatural one), counted among them <a href="Ioan%20Maiorescu">Ioan Maiorescu</a> and <a href="August%20Treboniu%20Laurian">August Treboniu Laurian</a>.
Another impetus for nationalism was the Russian-supervised creation of small <a href="standing%20army">standing armies</a> (occasionally referred to as "<a href="militia">militia</a>s"; "see <a href="Moldavian%20military%20forces">Moldavian military forces</a> and <a href="Wallachian%20military%20forces">Wallachian military forces</a>"). The Wallachian one first maneuvered in the autumn of 1831, and was supervised by Kiselyov himself. According to <a href="Ion%20Ghica">Ion Ghica</a>, the prestige of military careers had a relevant tradition: "Only the arrival of the Muscovites [sic] in 1828 ended [the] young boyars' sons flighty way of life, as it made use of them as commissioners ("mehmendari") in the service of Russian generals, in order to assist in providing the troops with [supplies]. In 1831 most of them took to the sword, signing up for the national militia."
The <a href="Westernization">Westernization</a> of Romanian society took place at a rapid pace, and created a noticeable, albeit not omnipresent, <a href="generation%20gap">generation gap</a>. The paramount cultural model was the French one, following a pattern already established by contacts between the region and the <a href="French%20Consulate">French Consulate</a> and <a href="First%20French%20Empire">First Empire</a> (attested, among others, by the existence of a Wallachian plan to <a href="petition">petition</a> <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, whom locals believed to be a descendant of the <a href="List%20of%20Byzantine%20Emperors">Byzantine Emperors</a>, with a complaint against the Phanariotes, as well as by an actual anonymous petition sent in 1807 from Moldavia). This trend was consolidated by the French cultural model partly adopted by the Russians, a growing mutual sympathy between the Principalities and France, increasingly obvious under the French <a href="July%20Monarchy">July Monarchy</a>, and, as early as the 1820s, the enrolment of young boyars in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>ian educational institutions (coupled with the 1830 opening of a French-language school in Bucharest, headed by <a href="Jean%20Alexandre%20Vaillant">Jean Alexandre Vaillant</a>). The young generation eventually attempted to curb French borrowings, which it had come to see as endangering its nationalist aspirations.

In 1834, despite the founding documents' requirements, Russia and the Ottoman Empire agreed to appoint the first two "<a href="hospodar">hospodar</a>s" (instead of providing for their election), as a means to ensure both the monarchs' support for a moderate pace in reforms and their allegiance in front of conservative boyar opposition. The choices were <a href="Alexandru%20II%20Ghica">Alexandru II Ghica</a> (the stepbrother of the previous monarch, <a href="Grigore%20IV%20Ghica">Grigore IV</a>) as <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Wallachia">Prince of Wallachia</a> and <a href="Mihail%20Sturdza">Mihail Sturdza</a> (a distant cousin of <a href="Ioan%20Sturdza">Ioniță Sandu</a>) as <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Moldavia">Prince of Moldavia</a>. The two rulers (generally referred to as "Domnii regulamentare" – "statutory" or "regulated reigns"), closely observed by the Russian <a href="consul%20%28representative%29">consuls</a> and various Russian technical advisors, soon met a vocal and unified opposition in the Assemblies and elsewhere.

Immediately after the confirmation of the "Regulament", Russia had begun demanding that the two local Assemblies each vote an "Additional Article" ("Articol adițional") – one preventing any modification of the texts without the common approval of the courts in Istanbul and Saint Petersburg. In Wallachia, the issue turned into scandal after the pressure for adoption mounted in 1834, and led to a four-year-long standstill, during which a nationalist group in the legislative body began working on its own project for a constitution, proclaiming the Russian <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a> and Ottoman <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a> to be over, and <a href="self-determination">self-determination</a> with guarantees from all European Powers of the time. The <a href="radicalism%20%28historical%29">radical</a> leader of the movement, <a href="Ion%20C%C3%A2mpineanu">Ion Câmpineanu</a>, maintained close contacts with <a href="Poles">Polish</a> nobleman <a href="Adam%20Jerzy%20Czartoryski">Adam Jerzy Czartoryski</a>'s <a href="Union%20of%20National%20Unity">Union of National Unity</a> (as well as with other European nationalists Romantics); after the "Additional Article" passed due to Ghica's interference and despite boyar protests, Câmpineanu was forced to abandon his seat and take refuge in Central Europe (until being arrested and sent back by the Austrians to be imprisoned in Bucharest). From that point on, opposition to Ghica's rule took the form of <a href="Freemasonry">Freemason</a> and "<a href="carbonari">carbonari</a>"-inspired <a href="conspiracy%20%28political%29">conspiracies</a>, formed around young politicians such as <a href="Mitic%C4%83%20Filipescu">Mitică Filipescu</a>, <a href="Nicolae%20B%C4%83lcescu">Nicolae Bălcescu</a>, <a href="Eftimie%20Murgu">Eftimie Murgu</a>, <a href="Ion%20Ghica">Ion Ghica</a>, <a href="Christian%20Tell">Christian Tell</a>, <a href="Dimitrie%20Macedonski">Dimitrie Macedonski</a>, and <a href="Cezar%20Bolliac">Cezar Bolliac</a> (all of whom held Câmpineanu's ideology in esteem) — in 1840, Filipescu and most of his group (who had tried in vain to profit from the Ottoman crisis engendered by <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20of%20Egypt">Muhammad Ali</a>'s rebellion) were placed under arrest and imprisoned in various locations.
Noted abuses against the <a href="rule%20of%20law">rule of law</a> and the consequent threat of rebellion made the Ottoman Empire and Russia withdraw their support for Ghica in 1842, and his successor, <a href="Gheorghe%20Bibescu">Gheorghe Bibescu</a>, reigned as the first and only prince to have been elected by any one of the two Assemblies. In Moldavia, the situation was less tense, as Sturdza was able to calm down and manipulate opposition to Russian rule while introducing further reforms.
In 1848, upon the outbreak of the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848">European revolutions</a>, <a href="Liberalism%20in%20Romania">liberalism</a> consolidated itself into more overt opposition, helped along by contacts between Romanian students with the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848%20in%20France">French movement</a>. Nevertheless, the <a href="1848%20Moldavian%20revolution">Moldavian revolution</a> of late March 1848 was an abortive one, and led to the return of Russian troops on its soil. <a href="1848%20Wallachian%20revolution">Wallachia's revolt</a> was successful: after the "<a href="Proclamation%20of%20Islaz">Proclamation of Islaz</a>" on June 21 sketched a new legal framework and <a href="land%20reform">land reform</a> with an end to all "<a href="corv%C3%A9e">corvée</a>s" (a program acclaimed by the crowds), the conspirators managed to topple Bibescu, who had by then dissolved the Assembly, without notable violence, and established a Provisoral Government in Bucharest.

The new executive, orchestrating the public burning of the "Regulament" in September, attempted to play Ottoman interests against Russian ones, trying to obtain backing from the <a href="Ottoman%20Porte">Porte</a>; the relative initial success was rendered void after Russian diplomats pressured <a href="Ottoman%20Dynasty">Sultan</a> <a href="Abd-ul-Mejid%20I">Abd-ul-Mejid I</a> to intervene in their place (and thus not risk losing yet more control over the region to a more determined Russian expedition). A Russian occupation over Wallachia soon joined the Ottoman one (begun on September 18), and both lasted until April 1851; in 1849, the two powers signed the <a href="Convention%20of%20Balta%20Liman">Convention of Balta Liman</a>, which asserted the right of the Porte to nominate "hospodars" for seven-year terms.

The <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a> again brought the two countries under Russian military administration, inaugurated in 1853. The "hospodars" of the period, <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Moldavia">Prince</a> <a href="Grigore%20Alexandru%20Ghica">Grigore Alexandru Ghica</a> in Moldavia and <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Wallachia">Prince</a> <a href="Barbu%20Dimitrie%20%C8%98tirbei">Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei</a> in Wallachia, were removed from their thrones, and the region was governed by the Russian general <a href="Aleksandr%20Ivanovich%20Budberg">Aleksandr Ivanovich Budberg</a>.

As the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> remained a secondary theatre of war, the two Principalities were taken over by a neutral Austrian administration in September 1854 – part of a settlement between the Porte and Russia (the Austrians remained until 1857). Grigore Ghica and Știrbei were returned to the thrones in the same year, and completed the last series of reforms carried under the terms of the "Regulament". The most far-reaching among these were the ones concerning <a href="Slavery%20in%20Romania">Roma slavery</a>. In Moldavia, Romas were liberated, without a period of transition, on December 22, 1855; the change was more gradual in Wallachia, where measures to curb trade had been taken earlier, and where the decision to ban the ownership of slaves was taken by Știrbei on February 20, 1856. Concerned by worsening boyar-peasant relations, Știrbei, who governed without an Assembly (and had instead appointed his own "Divan"), enacted measures to improve the situation in the countryside, and ultimately enforced <a href="employment">contract-based</a> work as the rule on estates (whereby peasants who were not indebted after five years in service could leave the land they were working on).
This was the moment when the call for union of the two Principalities began to be voiced with confidence, and the two monarchs showed more or less approval for the designs of the unionist "<a href="Partida%20Na%C8%9Bional%C4%83">Partida Națională</a>" (created by 1848 revolutionaries who had returned from exile).

The war ended with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281856%29">Treaty of Paris</a> (March 30, 1856), which placed the countries, still as Ottoman vassals, under the protectorate of all European Powers (the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="Second%20French%20Empire">French Empire</a>, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Piedmont-Sardinia">Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a>, Austria, and, never again completely, Russia). The protector states had to decide on a compromise formula for the projected union; the Ottomans demanded and obtained, in contradiction with the "Regulament", the removal of both "hospodars" from their thrones, pending elections for the <a href="ad%20hoc%20Divans">ad hoc Divans</a>. The outcome remained disputed until the election of <a href="Alexandru%20Ioan%20Cuza">Alexandru Ioan Cuza</a>, who reigned as first "<a href="Domnitor">Domnitor</a>" of the "United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia", the basis of modern <a href="Romania">Romania</a>.

Seacology

Seacology is a <a href="Nonprofit%20organization">nonprofit</a> <a href="501%28c%29%20organization">501(c)(3)</a> charitable organization headquartered in <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley, California</a>, that works to preserve island <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s and cultures around the world. Founded in 1991, it began with the work of <a href="Ethnobotany">ethnobotanist</a> <a href="Paul%20Alan%20Cox">Paul Alan Cox</a>, who researched tropical plants and their medicinal value in the village of <a href="Falealupo">Falealupo</a> in <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a> during the mid-1980s. When the villagers were pressured into selling <a href="logging">logging</a> rights to their <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> in 1988 to build a new school, Cox and his wife offered to help secure funds for the new school in return for an agreement with the villagers to protect their forest. With the help of his friends and family, Cox secured the funds within six months, later earning him and the village chief, <a href="Fuiono%20Senio">Fuiono Senio</a>, the <a href="Goldman%20Environmental%20Prize">Goldman Environmental Prize</a> for their efforts. Word spread throughout the islands, and with increasing demand for similar projects, Cox, along with Bill Marré and Ken Murdock, decided to form Seacology and expand their work internationally. For the first few years, the organization operated on a volunteer basis. <a href="Duane%20Silverstein">Duane Silverstein</a> became the first employee in 1999, and headquarters were relocated to Berkeley, not far from his residence.

Because of the high risk of extinction for island <a href="fauna">fauna</a> and the decline in <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a> ecosystems, Seacology's primary focus is projects in which villagers sign contracts under which they agree to help protect either terrestrial or marine habitat for a specified time in return for new buildings or services. The operations are low-cost, averaging around <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>20,000 to $25,000. Construction is done with local labor and sometimes without the use of machinery. Seacology selects its projects by reviewing the recommendations of its field representatives and its scientific advisory board.

By mid-2018, Seacology had initiated more than 300 projects globally, and helped preserve of marine habitat and of terrestrial habitat. At the same time, they had helped construct new facilities and provided programs including educational materials, vital medical services, and environmental training. In addition to helping local people on islands like those in <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>, the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, and many others, their projects have helped protect <a href="Mangrove">mangrove forests</a>, <a href="sea%20turtle">sea turtle</a>s, <a href="dugong">dugong</a>s, and one of the <a href="The%20World%27s%2025%20Most%20Endangered%20Primates">rarest primates in the world</a>: the <a href="Hainan%20black%20crested%20gibbon">Hainan black crested gibbon</a>. Seacology also awards an annual Seacology Prize to indigenous islanders for their efforts in conservation and cultural preservation. The organization helps support island communities by fostering <a href="ecotourism">ecotourism</a>, and has helped raise emergency funds following destructive <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a>s and other natural disasters. Its budget is modest, and it does not compensate its board members. It has won awards from <a href="Yahoo%21">Yahoo!</a> and "<a href="Travel%20%2B%20Leisure">Travel + Leisure</a>" magazine, and has been featured in the music video "<a href="What%20About%20Now%20%28Daughtry%20song%29">What About Now</a>" by the American rock band <a href="Daughtry%20%28band%29">Daughtry</a>.

Seacology was founded in 1991 by <a href="Ethnobotany">ethnobotanist</a> <a href="Paul%20Alan%20Cox">Paul Alan Cox</a> in Hawaii using prize money and consulting fees resulting from his efforts to preserve of <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> outside the village of <a href="Falealupo">Falealupo</a> on the island of <a href="Savai%27i">Savai'i</a> in <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a>. He later recorded these events in his book, "Nafanua: Saving the Samoan Rain Forest". Cox began his work in Samoa in 1973 during his first <a href="Missionary%20%28LDS%20Church%29">Mormon missionary service</a>, at which time he learned from local people about the medicinal properties of the native plants. After working with local communities in other rainforests, Cox returned to Samoa in 1984 with his family. His aim was to find a cure for <a href="cancer">cancer</a>, which had claimed the life of his mother earlier that year. In return for the help of the local healers (called "fofo"), Cox offered to share the revenue generated by his research with the local villages. Over time, his research identified five new drugs, including the therapeutic agent <a href="prostratin">prostratin</a>, a potential treatment for <a href="HIV">HIV</a>. Prostratin was isolated in a concoction made from the bark of the local mamala tree ("<a href="Homalanthus%20nutans">Homalanthus nutans</a>") and shared with him by a healer named Epenesa Mauigoa, who used it to treat <a href="hepatitis">hepatitis</a>. Cox set up <a href="Royalty%20payment">royalty</a> agreements to ensure that the Samoans will share in the revenue.
In 1988, his research was threatened when the <a href="Samoan%20government">Samoan government</a> pressured the village of Falealupo to pay $65,000 for a new school, warning that if the village did not provide a new school within a year, they would withdraw the teachers from the village, leaving the children without an opportunity for a formal education. Shortly after receiving this notice from government, a foreign-owned logging company offered the village exactly $65,000 to <a href="Logging">log</a> the entire surrounding Falealupo. Lacking a source of revenue, the villages eventually sold the logging rights to the forest, but when Cox learned of the situation and witnessed the logging for himself, he immediately sought an explanation from the <a href="Elder%20%28administrative%20title%29">village elders</a> and then requested that they halt the logging so that he could raise money for the school. Despite initial skepticism, Cox convinced the high chief, <a href="Fuiono%20Senio">Fuiono Senio</a>, who then helped persuade the rest of the elders. Senio then drew his <a href="machete">machete</a> and raced to halt the logging.

The new school was built after Cox and his wife, Barbara, were able to raise the money in six months partly by mortgaging their house. Cox also obtained financial support from others and took over payments on the mortgage for the school. Verne Read, a businessman and financial supporter of <a href="Bat%20Conservation%20International">Bat Conservation International</a>, took over payments on the mortgage for the school. <a href="Ken%20Murdock">Ken Murdock</a>, founder of the herbal company <a href="Nature%27s%20Way%20Products%2C%20Inc.">Nature's Way</a>, and <a href="Rex%20Maughan">Rex Maughan</a>, owner of <a href="Forever%20Living%20Products">Forever Living Products</a>, funded the construction of the school and repaid the loggers for their $20,000 advance. During a tribal ceremony held in February 1989, Cox, along with the village chiefs ("<a href="fa%27amatai">matai</a>") signed "The Falealupo Covenant", which legally protected the forest for 50 years in exchange for their help. During the ceremony, the village chiefs also bestowed chief's titles on Murdock and Maughan and proclaimed that Cox was a <a href="reincarnation">reincarnation</a> of their god, <a href="Nafanua">Nafanua</a>, because like Nafanua, he did not come from Samoa and both had fought to protect the village and the forest. The title bestowed upon him made Cox responsible for the well-being of the village and obligated that he return to visit.
In 1992, Cox and his friends had finished helping the Samoan villagers at Falealupo, as well as nearby <a href="Tafua">Tafua</a>, which encountered the same problem. Prior to that, Murdock, who later became Seacology's President, suggested continuing their work by seeking out more villages with which they could exchange projects for marine and forest <a href="Nature%20reserve">reserves</a>. As demand among island villages grew, Bill Marré, a business consultant and executive coach who later became a member of the Board of Trustees and the Chairman's Advisory Council, suggested establishing a <a href="nonprofit%20organization">nonprofit organization</a> to continue their work. He suggested the name "Seacology" to reflect the organization's focus on island conservation, and helped cofound the nonprofit in 1991, along with Cox and Murdock. Using his own funds, Marré paid the costs of starting the organization and covered its administrative costs for the first three years. Together with his assistant, Marré helped advertise Seacology by giving lectures at schools and universities, visiting other island nations, and writing articles about the work for the local media.

In Falealupo, Seacology continued their work, funding projects with a total of $485,000 as of 2005. When <a href="cyclone%20Ofa">cyclone Ofa</a> destroyed the primary school at Falealupo in 1990, Seacology helped raise funds to rebuild it. The school was completely rebuilt again in 1991 following <a href="Cyclone%20Val">Cyclone Val</a>. Several years after completing the school, the organization helped establish trails and build a rainforest information center, followed in 1997 by an elevated <a href="canopy%20walkway">canopy walkway</a> as part of an <a href="ecotourism">ecotourism</a> project to help generate income for the people and provide funds for a retirement system for the village elders. The walkway has since become one of Samoa's leading tourist attractions, and was yielding an average of $1,000 each month for the community in 2001—bringing in more money than the villagers would have earned from selling their forest. Satisfied with the results, the villagers at Falealupo declared that they would honor the contract they had made with Cox to protect the forest forever, rather than just 50 years. In 1997, both Cox and Senio, the village chief, shared the <a href="Goldman%20Environmental%20Prize">Goldman Environmental Prize</a> for their work.

For the first six years of its existence, Seacology operated as a volunteer organization with no employees. Four years after being founded, Seacology's administrative office moved to Ken Murdock's office. The office moved again in 1999 to <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley, California</a> after Cox offered a job to <a href="Duane%20Silverstein">Duane Silverstein</a>—then the Executive Director of the <a href="Goldman%20Fund">Goldman Fund</a>, which had previously honored Cox with the Goldman Environmental Prize. Silverstein had been inspired by the work Cox had done in Samoa, and agreed to take the position of Executive Director of Seacology under the condition that the office be relocated to within walking distance of his house.

In 2007, Seacology became an international organization with greater visibility, despite their small staff. International affiliate programs, such as Seacology Germany and Seacology Japan were created to help raise funds to support island projects. The following year, Seacology U.K. was created, followed by Seacology Scandinavia in 2009. For its global efforts, Seacology has received several awards, including the Global Vision Award in "<a href="Travel%20%2B%20Leisure">Travel + Leisure</a>", the Blue Award in "<a href="Islands%20Magazine">Islands Magazine</a>", and <a href="Yahoo%21">Yahoo!</a>'s Pick for Good in September 2006.

The organization has received numerous awards, most recently the Prince’s Prize for Innovative Nonprofits Laureate, awarded by <a href="Albert%20II%2C%20Prince%20of%20Monaco">Albert II, Prince of Monaco</a>.

Seacology is a nonprofit organization that works to preserve both island habitats and cultures by exchanging services for local assistance and cooperation with conservation efforts. As of 2000, it was reported to be the only conservation organization to focus entirely on island preservation. Seacology has <a href="501%28c%29%283%29">501(c)(3)</a> status (providing federal income tax deductions for some donors) because it is a charitable, non-profit organization. According to its mission statement on its website, "Seacology searches for win-win situations where both the local environment is protected and islanders receive some tangible benefit for doing so."

Islands constitute a large portion of the world's surface. Combined, the largest 125 islands cover an area the size of Europe, and if the economic zones that include marine resources (found within a few miles of shore) are included, islands make up one-sixth of the Earth's surface area and hold half of all marine species. Scientific surveys have shown that <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a>s are declining rapidly due to <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>, <a href="Blast%20fishing">dynamite</a> and <a href="cyanide%20fishing">cyanide fishing</a>, and <a href="marine%20pollution">marine pollution</a>. According to <a href="Evolution">evolutionary biologist</a> <a href="E.%20O.%20Wilson">E. O. Wilson</a>, bird species that are <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> to islands face a greater risk of extinction—40 times greater than on the continents. At least 255 island bird species have become extinct since the appearance of humans, with 158 lost during <a href="prehistory">prehistory</a> and 97 lost between 1600 and 1994. In comparison, between 17 and 20 species of continental birds became extinct between 1600 and 1994. Because the small land area of islands can only support small populations, the biggest threat to endemic wildlife is <a href="Habitat%20destruction">habitat loss</a>. Other threats include direct exploitation (<a href="hunting">hunting</a> and <a href="Wildlife%20trade">pet trade</a>), disease, and <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>.

To save island habitats around the world, Seacology staff initiate projects by first holding meetings with local villagers to determine their needs. These needs often include schools, a community center, solar energy, or freshwater delivery. Once their needs are determined, Seacology makes a deal with the local community, offering to provide the needed service in return for a forest reserve or a no-take fishing area around a coral reef. Facilities such as schools and community centers are built using local labor, and Seacology provides approximately $20,000 for supplies and to facilitate the construction. Seacology has field representatives stationed around the world who monitor and report the progress of the projects in their region, as well as seek new projects in their respective regions or islands. New project suggestions are reviewed by the Board of Directors. The Scientific Advisory Board provide additional recommendations, based on the latest research.

In addition to their projects, Seacology played an active role in the creation of the <a href="National%20Park%20of%20American%20Samoa">National Park of American Samoa</a> through the work of their scientists and donors. In 2008, Seacology started its Carbon Offset Fund, where donations of $40.00 went directly towards <a href="renewable%20energy">renewable energy</a> and <a href="reforestation">reforestation</a> projects. That same year, they collaboratively funded the creation of a nursery run by the <a href="non-governmental%20organization">non-governmental organization</a> (NGO) <a href="Azafady">Azafady</a> in <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> to raise 3,000 seedlings of the endangered palm "<a href="Dypsis%20saintelucei">Dypsis saintelucei</a>". The two organizations have also collaborated to protect the <a href="Manafiafy%20Forest">Manafiafy Forest</a> in southeastern Madagascar. In <a href="Bunaken">Bunaken</a> and <a href="Manado">Manado</a>, Seacology was involved in testing a new method of restoring coral reef, which involved planting white ceramic modules that were shaped like 3-dimensional snowflakes to maximize the surface area for corals to grow.

According to their 2016 Annual Report, Seacology has funded over 276 projects globally. The island communities that have aided in these efforts have collectively received facilities, including schools, community centers, and other important structures. Educational materials, vital medical services, and environmental training have been provided in many programs.
When projects are agreed upon with an island community, local rituals often coincide with the start of the project, particularly in the Pacific Islands, where a common custom involves drinking <a href="kava">kava</a>, a mildly narcotic drink made from the ground-up root of a pepper plant. The ritual is hundreds of years old, and has been described by the Seacology staff as being relaxing, especially because of the friendly environment. Seacology staff often dress in local attire. The villagers perform dances, and the staff are invited to join in, often to the amusement of the villagers.

When the projects begin, the work is done without machines, with supplies being shipped on small boats and then carried by hand from the beach. Project costs range between $5,000 and $150,000, although the average is between $20,000 and $25,000. The <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>s that result from these deals typically involve a 20- to 30-year commitment. Seacology hopes that during that time the local people grow to respect these resources and ideally progress to a point where they are less dependent on natural resources. According to marine biologist <a href="Mark%20Erdmann">Mark Erdmann</a>, in a worst-case scenario, if the people violate the contract and destroy the habitat, Seacology will have still made a difference in their lives through its low-cost investment, whereas larger conservation organizations might invest large sums of money but through not addressing the immediate needs of the people, if the project fails, both lose that investment and not have helped the community.

In one of Seacology's projects, villagers in <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a> refused a $700,000 offer by foreign businessmen to buy one of the islands and signed an agreement that prohibited development for 20 years and established a 10-year no-take fishing reserve encompassing around the island. On the island of <a href="Kendhoo">Kendhoo</a>, part of the <a href="Baa%20Atoll">Baa Atoll</a> in the <a href="Maldives">Maldives</a>, Seacology paid $30,000 in 2003 to build a kindergarten in exchange for a ban on harvesting <a href="endangered%20sea%20turtles">endangered sea turtle</a> eggs, which the government did not prohibit. In the <a href="Trang%20Province">Trang Province</a> of <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, another project helps protect the habitat of <a href="seagrass">seagrass</a> beds and mangrove forest to provide habitat for endangered marine mammals called <a href="dugong">dugong</a>s ("Dugong dugon"). In 2003, Seacology and a Chinese organization worked together to form an agreement with the people of <a href="Hainan">Hainan Island</a> where in return for scholarships for nearly 200 middle-school children, the people would stop cutting down the trees around <a href="Hainan%20Bawangling%20National%20Nature%20Reserve">Hainan Bawangling National Nature Reserve</a>, home to one of the rarest <a href="primate">primate</a>s in the world, the <a href="Hainan%20black%20crested%20gibbon">Hainan black crested gibbon</a> ("Nomascus nasutus hainanus") and the nearly extinct subspecies of <a href="Eld%27s%20deer">Eld's deer</a> ("Panolia eldii") found on Hainan. In a project on <a href="C%C3%A1t%20B%C3%A0%20Island">Cát Bà Island</a> in Vietnam, the organization helped protect the <a href="white-headed%20langur">golden-headed langur</a>, another one of the <a href="The%20World%27s%2025%20Most%20Endangered%20Primates">world's most endangered primates</a>, by paying cash and helping establish exclusive harvesting and fishing rights for the local people in return for their efforts in patrolling the beaches and forests for poachers. In 1999, Seacology began work to establish a new national park around Mt. Angavokely, near <a href="Antananarivo">Antananarivo</a> in Madagascar. The mountain is home to 120 species of endangered <a href="Orchidaceae">orchids</a> and several medicinal herbs, including "<a href="Helichrysum%20gymnocephalum">Helichrysum gymnocephalum</a>", which is used as an antiseptic and treatment for bronchitis; "<a href="Secneicia%20faujasiodides">Secneicia faujasiodides</a>", which is used for healing wounds; "<a href="Psiadia%20altissima">Psiadia altissima</a>", which is used to treat <a href="eczema">eczema</a>; "<a href="Bryophyllum%20proliferum">Bryophyllum proliferum</a>", which is used to treat coughing; and "<a href="Brachylaena%20ramiflora">Brachylaena ramiflora</a>", which is used to lower <a href="Malaria">malarial fever</a>.

In 2015, Seacology launched its largest-ever project, a $3.4 million initiative to protect all of <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>'s remaining <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> forests and restore many degraded ones. Through Sri Lanka-based NGO Sudeesa (also known as the Small Fishers Federation of Lanka), Seacology is funding a significant expansion of that organization's existing microloan and job-training programs. In exchange, the beneficiaries of these programs must agree to assist in protecting their local mangrove habitats. The training is designed in part to give low-income women in these communities alternatives to harvesting mangroves, a subsistence activity that has contributed to the forests' degradation. The project also established three large nursery facilities to grow several species of mangroves, to be replanted in areas previously cleared for aquaculture and other unsustainable development, as well as several areas destroyed during the <a href="Sri%20Lankan%20Civil%20War">Sri Lankan Civil War</a>.

The effort is endorsed by the government of Sri Lanka, which has agreed to assist with demarcating the country's mangroves. The Sri Lankan navy has assisted with the effort to replant mangroves in several deforested areas, and President <a href="Maithripala%20Sirisena">Maithripala Sirisena</a> has attended several Sudeesa functions, including the opening of a museum funded by the project designed to educate visitors about the mangrove ecosystem's ecological and economic importance. In 2018, the project was named as one of 15 winners of the climate action award given by Momentum For Change, a project of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Framework%20Convention%20on%20Climate%20Change">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a>. Sri Lanka was also selected by the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a> to lead a new committee to advise the 53-country organization on best practices for mangrove conservation.

Following the success of its first nationwide project, Seacology is considering a similar effort in another island country.

Created by cofounder Bill Marré in 1992 and underwritten by Ken Murdock in honor of his mother, the Seacology Prize is awarded each year to an indigenous islander based on achievements in island conservation and cultural preservation. Many of the award recipients are people who risk their lives and wellbeing to preserve their culture and environment but receive little or no public recognition for their work. The prize includes a reward of $10,000.

In 2010, it was awarded to Rabary Desiré from Matsobe-Sud in Madagascar for his forest conservation efforts in <a href="Belaoka%20Marovato">Belaoka Marovato</a> in northeastern Madagascar. Rabary, an ecotour and research guide, had created his own forest reserve, called Antanetiambo (meaning "on the high hill"), and planned to use his prize money to fund reforestation efforts, develop tourist facilities, and expand the reserve. Another winner of the Seacology Prize was the Icelandic filmmaker and former reporter for <a href="R%C3%9AV">RÚV</a> <a href="%C3%93mar%20Ragnarsson">Ómar Ragnarsson</a>, who won the award in 2008 for his efforts in preserving the highlands of Iceland. In 2017, the prize was awarded to Filipino environmentalist and philanthropist <a href="Gina%20Lopez">Gina Lopez</a> for her brave battle against multi-million mining corporations in the Philippines, which led to a massive public discourse and perception against mining in island ecosystems.

In response to the growing demand for ecotourism, Seacology opened up its fundraising expeditions to the public in 2006. These trips include destinations like Fiji, and offer both unusual travel opportunities and a means to help improve the quality of life for the indigenous people. The experiences have been described as "moving" because of the close personal interactions with the local people. Some tours visit locations seldom visited by Westerners. On the tours, Seacology encourages travelers to explore the culture and economy by trying local foods.

Following the <a href="2002%20Bali%20bombings">2002 Bali bombings</a>, Silverstein reported that tourism fell by over 90 percent on the island of <a href="Bali">Bali</a>, mostly due to <a href="Sensationalism">sensational media reporting</a>. He was in Bali a few days after the attack and reported that he saw little or no risk to tourists in the Muslim villages of the region.

Following the <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">2004 Indian Ocean tsunami</a>, Seacology established a tsunami relief fund to help four impacted communities with which the organization had previously completed projects. Following the model of their projects, the Seacology staff asked the local people what they needed to rebuild their economy and infrastructure. In <a href="Kiralakele">Kiralakele</a>, <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, the people requested fishing nets and boats. The people of <a href="Kadachang">Kadachang Village</a> in the <a href="Andaman%20Islands">Andaman Islands</a> requested goats and chickens. On Kendhoo in the Maldives, the tsunami had destroyed the local plant life, so seedlings were needed in order to restore the environment. In Trang Province, Thailand, basic structural repair was requested. Seacology emphasized that it would repair and replace the projects that had been damaged or destroyed in the tsunami.

As of late 2005, Seacology had raised $261,716 for the relief work, with all of it going directly to fund the efforts. All donors received details of how the money was spent, as well as photos of the work. The <a href="California%20Association%20of%20Nonprofits">California Association of Nonprofits</a> later honored Seacology for the relief work with their Achievement in Innovation Award.

Previous work by Seacology in the region had helped minimize the damage caused by the tsunami. Seacology Prize recipient Anuradha Wickramasinghe from Sri Lanka noted that the mangrove forests that were preserved shielded the community, whereas nearby villages that had cleared their mangroves to create industrial <a href="shrimp%20farm">shrimp farm</a>s had not fared so well. Mangroves also buffered Kadachang Village in the hard-hit Andaman Islands; the village suffered little loss of human life or structural damage compared to the nation's capital city of <a href="Port%20Blair">Port Blair</a>.

Following the <a href="2009%20Samoa%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">2009 Samoa tsunami</a>, Seacology once again started a tsunami relief effort. They helped Samoan villages by providing new water tanks and pipelines, and also helped to clean up mangroves and inshore coral reefs that were littered with debris from nearby motels.

Seacology is a small nonprofit, with only eight full-time staff, and as a result has little <a href="Overhead%20%28business%29">overhead costs</a> and operates on a modest budget. Its <a href="Employer%20Identification%20Number">tax identification number</a> is 87-0495235. According to Silverstein, its annual budget for all of its staff and office expenditures is significantly lower than the median compensation for business <a href="chief%20executive%20officer">chief executive officer</a>s (CEOs) alone. Board members receive no compensation and are not reimbursed for the costs of attending board meetings. Unlike other environmental groups, Seacology does not offer memberships, which further reduces its expenditures. Staff answer the phone instead of using automated answering services, and Seacology respects donor privacy and is compliant with the <a href="Children%27s%20Online%20Privacy%20Protection%20Act">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</a> (COPPA).

In 2014, Seacology reported $2,309,541 in donations and grants and a total of $2,335,266 when other revenue was included. Its expenses that year totaled $1,656,772 with $286,981 going toward fundraising and $130,329 supporting management and other general expenses. Financial support comes mostly from individuals, foundations, and companies such as <a href="Nu%20Skin%20Enterprises">Nu Skin Enterprises</a>, which pays annual royalties for the plant-based cosmetic formulas Cox developed for facial creams and other skincare products. Board members also contribute a sizable portion of the annual budget, donating a minimum of $10,000 per year to the organization.

Seacology is governed by its Board of Directors, which consists of corporate leaders who share a commitment to island conservation and the preservation of island cultures. Paul Alan Cox is the Chairman of Seacology. He received his <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">PhD</a> from <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>, and served as a professor at <a href="Brigham%20Young%20University">Brigham Young University</a>, the <a href="Swedish%20University%20of%20Agricultural%20Sciences">Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences</a>, and <a href="Uppsala%20University">Uppsala University</a>. Cox served as the Director of the <a href="National%20Tropical%20Botanical%20Garden">National Tropical Botanical Garden</a> (NTBG) for seven years, and as of 2011, he is the Executive Director of the Institute for Ethnomedicine, which is affiliated with the NTBG. His research interests include island plant ecology and ethnobotany of island cultures, and he has published more than 150 scientific papers and reviews. For his research on new <a href="Herbalism">medicinal plants</a>, he was named one of eleven "Heroes of Medicine" by "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time"</a>" magazine. Cox is an advocate of <a href="indigenous%20peoples">indigenous peoples</a>, and has learned several island languages.
The Executive Director of Seacology is Duane Silverstein, who for 18 years prior to joining the organization acted as the Executive Director of the Goldman Fund and headed the Goldman Environmental Prize. He has written articles that have appeared in "<a href="Asian%20Geographic">Asian Geographic</a>" as well as various <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba diving</a> magazines, and he is a National Fellow of <a href="The%20Explorers%20Club">The Explorers Club</a>. Silverstein has met with heads of state around the world, including several presidents of the United States, as well as several <a href="Secretary-General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">Secretaries-General of the United Nations</a>. In addition to having his work covered in newspapers and periodicals, including "Time" magazine, the "<a href="Bangkok%20Post">Bangkok Post</a>", and the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>", he was also selected as an "All-Stars Among Us" in "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" magazine, for which he was honored at the <a href="2009%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game</a>. In 2008, Silverstein and Seacology were briefly featured alongside several organizations in the music video for "<a href="What%20About%20Now%20%28Daughtry%20song%29">What About Now</a>" by the American rock band <a href="Daughtry%20%28band%29">Daughtry</a>. In 2010, Silverstein was awarded the one of the <a href="Jefferson%20Awards%20for%20Public%20Service">Jefferson Awards for Public Service</a> and also was given the 2010 Coastal Hero Award by "<a href="Sunset%20%28magazine%29">Sunset</a>" magazine.

The vice chair of Seacology is Ken Murdock, who also founded the herbal company Nature's Way after his mother was cured of a serious illness with an herbal medicine. Murdock played a key role in the creation of Seacology, and Nature's Way covered Seacology's administrative costs for three years. Murdock has volunteered in Samoa, during which time he resided on <a href="Manu%27a">Manu'a</a> and learned the local language.

The Scientific Advisory Board of Seacology includes island <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> specialists, whose research focuses on the conservation of oceanic and terrestrial <a href="Island%20ecology">island ecosystems</a>. The Scientific Advisory Board generates recommendations for new conservation projects based on the latest research available. Among the eleven members are researcher and <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a> winner <a href="Jared%20Diamond">Jared Diamond</a>, <a href="Entomology">entomologist</a> and evolutionary biologist E. O. Wilson, and <a href="Oceanography">oceanographer</a> <a href="Sylvia%20Earle">Sylvia Earle</a>. As the founder of Seacology, Cox is also a member of the advisory board.

Diamonds Are Forever (novel)

Diamonds Are Forever is the <a href="List%20of%20James%20Bond%20novels%20and%20short%20stories">fourth novel</a> by the English author <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a> to feature his fictional British <a href="Secret%20Intelligence%20Service">Secret Service</a> agent <a href="James%20Bond%20%28literary%20character%29">James Bond</a>. Fleming wrote the story at his <a href="Goldeneye%20%28estate%29">Goldeneye estate</a> in Jamaica, inspired by a "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">Sunday Times</a>" article on diamond smuggling. The book was first published by <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a> in the United Kingdom on 26 March 1956.

The story centres on Bond's investigation of a diamond-smuggling operation that originates in the mines of <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a> and runs to Las Vegas. Along the way Bond meets and falls in love with one of the members of the smuggling gang, <a href="Tiffany%20Case">Tiffany Case</a>. Much of Fleming's background research formed the basis for his non-fiction 1957 book "<a href="The%20Diamond%20Smugglers">The Diamond Smugglers</a>". "Diamonds Are Forever" deals with international travel, marriage and the transitory nature of life.

As with Fleming's previous novels, "Diamonds Are Forever" received broadly positive reviews at the time of publication. The story was serialised in the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip. In 1971 it was adapted into the <a href="Diamonds%20Are%20Forever%20%28film%29">seventh Bond film</a> in the <a href="James%20Bond%20in%20film">series</a> and was the last <a href="Eon%20Productions">Eon Productions</a> film to star <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a> as Bond.

The British <a href="Secret%20Intelligence%20Service">Secret Service</a> agent <a href="James%20Bond%20%28literary%20character%29">James Bond</a> is sent on an assignment by his superior, <a href="M%20%28James%20Bond%29">M</a>. Acting on information received from <a href="Special%20Branch">Special Branch</a>, M tasks Bond with infiltrating a smuggling ring transporting diamonds from mines in the <a href="Crown%20colony">Crown colony</a> of Sierra Leone to the United States. Bond must infiltrate the smugglers' pipeline to uncover those responsible. Using the identity of "Peter Franks", a country house burglar turned diamond smuggler, he meets <a href="Tiffany%20Case">Tiffany Case</a>, an attractive gang member who has developed an antipathy towards men after being gang-raped as a teenager.
Bond discovers that the ring is operated by the Spangled Mob, a ruthless American gang run by the brothers Jack and Seraffimo Spang. He follows the trail from London to New York. To earn his fee for carrying the diamonds he is instructed by a gang member, Shady Tree, to bet on a rigged horse race in nearby <a href="Saratoga%20Race%20Course">Saratoga</a>. There Bond meets <a href="Felix%20Leiter">Felix Leiter</a>, a former <a href="CIA">CIA</a> agent working at <a href="Pinkerton%20National%20Detective%20Agency">Pinkertons</a> as a private detective investigating crooked horse racing. Leiter bribes the jockey to ensure the failure of the plot to rig the race, and asks Bond to make the pay-off. When he goes to make the payment, he witnesses two homosexual thugs, <a href="Mr.%20Wint%20and%20Mr.%20Kidd">Wint and Kidd</a>, attack the jockey.

Bond calls Tree to enquire further about the payment of his fee and is told to go to the Tiara Hotel in Las Vegas. The Tiara is owned by Seraffimo Spang and operates as the headquarters of the Spangled Mob. Spang also owns an old Western ghost town, named Spectreville, restored to be his own private holiday retreat. At the hotel Bond finally receives payment through a rigged blackjack game where the dealer is Tiffany. After winning the money he is owed he disobeys his orders from Tree by continuing to gamble in the casino and wins heavily. Spang suspects that Bond may be a 'plant' and has him captured and tortured at Spectreville. With Tiffany's help he escapes from Spectreville aboard a railway <a href="Handcar">push-car</a> with Seraffimo Spang in pursuit aboard an old Western train. Bond changes the points and re-routes the train onto a dead-end, and shoots Spang before the resulting crash. Assisted by Leiter, Bond and Tiffany go via California to New York, where they board the <a href="RMS%20Queen%20Elizabeth">RMS "Queen Elizabeth"</a> to travel to London, a relationship developing between them as they go. Wint and Kidd observe their embarkation and follow them on board. They kidnap Tiffany, planning to kill her and throw her overboard. Bond rescues her and kills both gangsters; he makes it look like a <a href="murder-suicide">murder-suicide</a>.

Tiffany subsequently informs Bond of the details of the pipeline. The story begins in Africa where a dentist bribes miners to smuggle diamonds in their mouths; he extracts the gems during routine appointments. From there, the dentist takes the diamonds to a rendezvous with a German helicopter pilot. Eventually the diamonds go to Paris and then on to London. There, after telephone instructions from a contact known as ABC, Tiffany meets a person who explains how the diamonds will be smuggled to New York City. After returning to London—where Tiffany moves into Bond's flat—Bond flies to <a href="Freetown">Freetown</a> in Sierra Leone, and then to the next diamond rendezvous. With the collapse of the rest of the pipeline, Jack Spang (who turns out to be ABC) shuts down his diamond-smuggling pipeline by killing its participants. Spang himself is killed when Bond shoots down his helicopter.

By mid 1954 the author <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a> had published two novels—"<a href="Casino%20Royale%20%28novel%29">Casino Royale</a>" (1953) and "<a href="Live%20and%20Let%20Die%20%28novel%29">Live and Let Die</a>" (1954)—and had a third, "<a href="Moonraker%20%28novel%29">Moonraker</a>", being edited and prepared for production. That year he read a story in "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" about diamond smuggling from Sierra Leone. He considered this story as the possible basis for a new novel and, through an old school friend, he engineered a meeting with <a href="Percy%20Sillitoe">Sir Percy Sillitoe</a>, the ex-head of <a href="MI5">MI5</a>, then working in a security capacity for the diamond-trading company <a href="De%20Beers">De Beers</a>. The material Fleming gathered was used in both "Diamonds Are Forever" and "<a href="The%20Diamond%20Smugglers">The Diamond Smugglers</a>", a non-fiction book published in 1957.

After Fleming's friend, <a href="William%20Stephenson">William Stephenson</a>, sent him a magazine article about the spa town of Saratoga Springs, Fleming flew to the US in August 1954, where he met his friends Ivar Bryce and <a href="Ernest%20Cuneo">Ernest Cuneo</a>; the three travelled to the town in New York State. There, Fleming and Cuneo visited a mud-bath: en route to an up-market establishment they took the wrong directions and ended up at a run-down outlet, which became the inspiration for the Acme Mud and Sulphur Baths scene in the book. Fleming met the rich socialite, <a href="William%20Woodward%2C%20Jr.">William Woodward, Jr.</a>, who drove a <a href="Studillac">Studillac</a>—a <a href="Studebaker">Studebaker</a> with a powerful <a href="Cadillac">Cadillac</a> engine. According to Henry Chancellor, "the speed and comfort of it impressed Ian, and he shamelessly appropriated this car" for the book. Woodward was killed by his wife shortly afterwards—she claimed she mistook him for a prowler—and when "Diamonds Are Forever" was published, it was dedicated to Bryce, Cuneo and "the memory of W. W. Jr., at Saratoga, 1954 and 55".

Fleming also travelled to Los Angeles with Cuneo, visiting the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department%23Counter%20Terrorism%20and%20Special%20Operations%20Bureau">Los Angeles Police Intelligence</a> headquarters, where they met Captain James Hamilton, who provided Fleming with information on the <a href="American%20Mafia">Mafia</a> organisation in the US. From Los Angeles Fleming travelled to Las Vegas, where he stayed at the <a href="Sands%20Hotel%20and%20Casino">Sands Hotel</a>; he interviewed the hotel owner, <a href="Jack%20Entratter">Jack Entratter</a>, where he learnt the background to the security systems and methods of cheating that he used in the novel.

Fleming wrote "Diamonds Are Forever" at his <a href="Goldeneye%20%28estate%29">Goldeneye estate</a> in Jamaica in January and February 1955. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in "<a href="Hansom%20Books">Books and Bookmen</a>" magazine, in which he said: "I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." On completion Fleming wrote to his friend Hilary Bray:

He returned to London with the completed 183-page typescript in March that year; he had earlier settled on a title, which he based on an advertisement slogan "A Diamond is Forever" in the American edition of "<a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>".

Although Fleming provides no dates within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom have written books on behalf of <a href="Ian%20Fleming%20Publications">Ian Fleming Publications</a>—have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the <a href="List%20of%20James%20Bond%20novels%20and%20short%20stories">novel series</a> as a whole. Chancellor put the events of "Diamonds Are Forever" in 1954; Griswold is more precise, and considers the story to have taken place in July and August 1953.

Fleming had previously travelled to the US on the RMS "Queen Elizabeth"; the experience provided background information for the final four chapters of the novel. His trip had included a railway journey on the "<a href="Super%20Chief">Super Chief</a>", during which he and Cuneo had visited the cab to meet the driver and engineer, and an excursion on the "<a href="20th%20Century%20Limited">20th Century Limited</a>", both of which gave information Fleming used for Spang's train, the "Cannonball". Fleming had a long-standing interest in trains and following his involvement in a near-fatal crash associated them with danger. In addition to "Diamonds Are Forever", he used them in "Live and Let Die", "<a href="From%20Russia%2C%20with%20Love%20%28novel%29">From Russia, with Love</a>" and "<a href="The%20Man%20with%20the%20Golden%20Gun%20%28novel%29">The Man with the Golden Gun</a>".

As with several others of his works, Fleming appropriated the names of people he knew for the story's characters. The name of one of Fleming's two travelling companions from the US, Ernest Cuneo, was used as Ernie Cureo, Bond's taxi-driving ally in Las Vegas, and one of the homosexual villains, "Boofy" Kidd, was named after one of Fleming's close friends—and a relative of his wife—<a href="Arthur%20Gore%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Arran">Arthur Gore, 8th Earl of Arran</a>, known to his friends as "Boofy". Arran, an advocate of the relaxation of the British laws relating to homosexuality, heard about the use of his name before publication and complained to Fleming about it, but was ignored and the name was retained for the novel. During his trip to America Fleming had come across the name Spang—old German for "maker of shoe buckles"—which he appropriated for the villainous brothers.

The writer <a href="Jonathan%20Kellerman">Jonathan Kellerman</a>'s introduction to the 2006 edition of "Diamonds Are Forever" describes Bond as a "surprisingly ... complex" character who, in contrast with the cinematic representation, is "nothing other than human. ... Fleming's Bond makes mistakes and pays for them. He feels pain and regret." The novelist <a href="Raymond%20Benson">Raymond Benson</a>—who later wrote a series of Bond novels—writes that the character develops in "Diamonds Are Forever", building on Fleming's characterisation in his previous three novels. This growth arises through Bond's burgeoning relationship with the book's main female character, Tiffany Case. He falls in love; the first time he has done so since <a href="Vesper%20Lynd">Vesper Lynd</a> in "Casino Royale". According to Benson, Tiffany is portrayed as tough, but lonely and insecure, and "is Fleming's first fully developed female character." The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and <a href="Tony%20Bennett%20%28sociologist%29">Tony Bennett</a> write that many of the main female characters in Fleming's novels are uncommon, and Tiffany—along with <a href="Pussy%20Galore">Pussy Galore</a> from "<a href="Goldfinger%20%28novel%29">Goldfinger</a>" and <a href="Honeychile%20Rider">Honeychile Rider</a> from "<a href="Dr.%20No%20%28novel%29">Dr. No</a>"—has been "damaged ... sexually" having previously been raped. The effect of the trauma has led to Tiffany working for the villain, which allows Bond to complete his mission, and align her to a more honest lifestyle.

The literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek observes that "Diamonds Are Forever" along with "Goldfinger" and "The Man with the Golden Gun" have gangsters as antagonists rather than as spies; the novel is the only one in the Bond canon without a connection to the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. Panek, comparing the gangsters to Bond's normal adversaries, identifies them as "merely incompetent gunsels" when compared with the British agent, who can eliminate them with relative ease. The essayist <a href="Umberto%20Eco">Umberto Eco</a> sees the Spangs as being a forerunner of the <a href="SPECTRE">SPECTRE</a> organisation Fleming uses in his later novels. <a href="Kingsley%20Amis">Kingsley Amis</a>, who later wrote a Bond novel, considered that there was "no decent villain", while Eco judges three of the villains—the two Spang brothers and Winter—as physically abnormal, as many of Bond's adversaries are. Anthony Synnott, in his examination of aesthetics in the Bond novels, also considers that the gangster Michael "Shady" Tree fits into the abnormal category, as he is a red-haired hunchback with "a pair of china eyes that were so empty and motionless that they might have been hired by a taxidermist".

"Diamonds Are Forever" opens with a passage in which a scorpion hunts and eats its prey, and is subsequently killed by one of the diamond couriers. Eco sees this "cleverly presented" beginning as similar to the opening of a film, remarking that "Fleming abounds in such passages of high technical skill". When the writer <a href="William%20Plomer">William Plomer</a> was proof-reading the manuscript he saw literary merit, and wrote to Fleming that the passages relating to the racing stables at Saratoga were "the work of a serious writer". Kellerman considers that "Fleming's depiction of Las Vegas in the '50s is wickedly spot on and one of the finest renditions of time and place in contemporary crime fiction. The story is robust and complex."

Fleming used well-known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism, which Amis called "the Fleming effect". Amis describes "the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond's world ... [is] bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced." Benson considers that in "Diamonds Are Forever" the use of detail is "rich and flamboyant" which allows an "interesting and amusing" description of the US. Benson considers a weakness of the book to be a lack of structural development, although this is compensated by character development; Kellerman also believes the novel to be "rich in characterization".

Benson analyses Fleming's writing style and identifies what he describes as the "Fleming Sweep": a stylistic point that sweeps the reader from one chapter to another using 'hooks' at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next: Benson feels that the sweep in "Diamonds Are Forever" was "at full force" in the novel, which "maintain[s] a constant level of excitement" as a result.

According to Benson the main theme of "Diamonds Are Forever" is expressed in the title, with the permanency of the gemstones held in contrast to other aspects of the story, particularly love and life. Towards the end of the novel Fleming uses the lines "Death is forever. But so are diamonds", and Benson sees the gems as a metaphor for death and Bond as the "messenger of death".

The journalist and author <a href="Christopher%20Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a> observes that "the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that, although superficially devoted to the Anglo-American war against communism, they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans"; Benson sees that "Diamonds Are Forever" contains examples of Fleming's feelings of superiority towards American culture, including his description of the sleaziness of Las Vegas. Amis, in his exploration of Bond in "<a href="The%20James%20Bond%20Dossier">The James Bond Dossier</a>", pointed out that Leiter is

The cultural historian <a href="Jeremy%20Black%20%28historian%29">Jeremy Black</a> points to the theme of international travel in "Diamonds Are Forever", which was still a novelty to most people in Britain at the time. This travel between a number of a locations exacerbates one of the problems identified by Black: that there was no centre to the story. In contrast to the other novels in the Bond canon, where "Casino Royale" had Royale, "From Russia, with Love" had Istanbul and "Dr. No" had Jamaica, "Diamonds Are Forever" had multiple locations and two villains and there was "no megalomaniac fervour, no weird self-obsession, at the dark centre of the plot".

According to Fleming's biographer, <a href="Andrew%20Lycett">Andrew Lycett</a>, after the novel was completed, Fleming added four extra chapters "almost as an afterthought", detailing the events on the "Queen Elizabeth". This introduced the question of marriage, and allowed Fleming to discuss matrimony through his characters, with Bond telling Case "Most marriages don't add two people together. They subtract one from the other." Lycett opines that the addition was because of the state of Fleming's own marriage which was going through a bad time.

"Diamonds Are Forever" was published on 26 March 1956 by <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a> with a cover designed by Pat Marriott. As with the three previous Bond books, the first edition of 12,500 copies sold out quickly; the US edition was published in October 1956 by <a href="Macmillan%20Publishers%20%28United%20States%29">Macmillan</a>. The novel was serialised in "The Daily Express" newspaper from 12 April 1956 onwards—the first of Fleming's novels he had sold to the newspaper—which led to an overall rise in the sales of the novels. From November 1956 sales of "Diamonds Are Forever", and Fleming's other novels, all rose following the visit of the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Sir Anthony Eden</a>, to Fleming's Goldeneye estate to recuperate following the <a href="Suez%20Crisis">Suez Crisis</a>; Eden's stay was much reported in the British press. The book received boosts in sales in 1962 when <a href="Eon%20Productions">Eon Productions</a> adapted "Dr. No" for the cinema, and in 1971 when "Diamonds Are Forever" was produced for the big screen. In February 1958 <a href="Pan%20Books">Pan Books</a> published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 68,000 copies before the end of the year. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.

<a href="Julian%20Symons">Julian Symons</a>, reviewing "Diamonds Are Forever" in "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>", thought that Fleming had some enviable qualities as a writer, including "a fine eye for places ... an ability to convey his own interest in the mechanics of gambling and an air of knowledgeableness". Symons also saw defects in Fleming's style, including "his inability to write convincing dialogue". For Symons, the novel was Fleming's "weakest book, a heavily padded story about diamond smuggling", where "the exciting passages are few".

<a href="Milward%20Kennedy">Milward Kennedy</a> of <a href="The%20Guardian">"The Manchester Guardian"</a>, thought that Fleming was "determined to be as tough as Chandler, if a little less lifelike", while <a href="Maurice%20Richardson">Maurice Richardson</a>, in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", considered Bond "one of the most cunningly synthesised heroes in crime-fiction". Richardson wrote how "Fleming's method is worth noting, and recommending: he does not start indulging in his wilder fantasies until he has laid down a foundation of factual description." Elements of a review by <a href="Raymond%20Chandler">Raymond Chandler</a> for "The Sunday Times" were used as advertising for the novel; Chandler wrote that it was "about the nicest piece of book-making in this type of literature which I have seen for a long time ... Mr. Fleming writes a journalistic style, neat, clean, spare and never pretentious".

Writing in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Anthony%20Boucher">Anthony Boucher</a>—described by Fleming's biographer <a href="John%20Pearson%20%28author%29">John Pearson</a> as "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—was mixed in his review, thinking that "Mr. Fleming's handling of American and Americans is well above the British average", although he felt that "the narrative is loose-jointed and weakly resolved", while Bond resolves his assignments "more by muscles and luck than by any sign of operative intelligence".

"Diamonds Are Forever" was adapted as a daily <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a> for the "Daily Express" newspaper, and syndicated around the world. The original adaptation ran from 10 August 1959 to 30 January 1960. The strip was written by <a href="Henry%20Gammidge">Henry Gammidge</a> and illustrated by <a href="John%20McLusky">John McLusky</a>.

The novel was loosely adapted in a 1971 film starring Sean Connery and directed by <a href="Guy%20Hamilton">Guy Hamilton</a>. "Diamonds Are Forever" was the final Bond film undertaken by Sean Connery with Eon Productions, although he returned to the role of Bond twelve years later with <a href="Kevin%20McClory">Kevin McClory</a>'s Taliafilm company for "<a href="Never%20Say%20Never%20Again">Never Say Never Again</a>".

In July 2015 "Diamonds Are Forever" was broadcast on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a>, starring <a href="Toby%20Stephens">Toby Stephens</a> as Bond; it was directed by <a href="Martin%20Jarvis%20%28actor%29">Martin Jarvis</a>.

Battle of the Tenaru

The Battle of the Tenaru, sometimes called the Battle of the Ilu River or the Battle of Alligator Creek, was a land battle between the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> and <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> ground forces that took place on August 21, 1942 on the island of <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> during the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific campaign</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The battle was the first major Japanese land offensive during the <a href="Guadalcanal%20campaign">Guadalcanal campaign</a>.

In the battle, U.S. Marines, under the overall command of U.S. <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="Alexander%20Vandegrift">Alexander Vandegrift</a>, repulsed an assault by the "First Element" of the "Ichiki" Regiment, under the command of Japanese Colonel <a href="Kiyonao%20Ichiki">Kiyonao Ichiki</a>. The Marines were defending the Lunga perimeter, which guarded <a href="Henderson%20Field%20%28Guadalcanal%29">Henderson Field</a>, which was captured by the Allies in landings on Guadalcanal on August 7. Ichiki's unit was sent to Guadalcanal in response to the Allied landings with the mission of recapturing the airfield and driving the Allied forces off the island.

Underestimating the strength of Allied forces on Guadalcanal, which at that time numbered about 11,000 personnel, Ichiki's unit conducted a nighttime frontal assault on Marine positions at Alligator Creek on the east side of the Lunga perimeter. Ichiki's assault was defeated with heavy losses. The Marines counterattacked Ichiki's surviving troops after daybreak, killing many more. All but 128 of the original 917 of the Ichiki Regiment's First Element died.

The battle was the first of three separate major land offensives by the Japanese in the Guadalcanal campaign. The Japanese realized after Tenaru that Allied forces on Guadalcanal were much greater in number than originally estimated and sent larger forces to the island for their subsequent attempts to retake Henderson Field.

On August 7, 1942, U.S. forces landed on Guadalcanal, <a href="Tulagi">Tulagi</a>, and <a href="Florida%20Islands">Florida Islands</a> in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as <a href="Military%20base">bases</a> for threatening the <a href="materiel">supply</a> routes between the U.S. and <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, and to secure the islands as starting points for a <a href="Military%20campaign">campaign</a> with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> while also supporting the Allied <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>. The landings initiated the six-month-long <a href="Guadalcanal%20campaign">Guadalcanal campaign</a>.

Taking the Japanese by surprise, the Allied landing forces accomplished their initial objectives of <a href="Battle%20of%20Tulagi%20and%20Gavutu-Tanambogo">securing Tulagi</a> and nearby small islands, as well as an airfield under construction at <a href="Lunga%20Point">Lunga Point</a> on Guadalcanal, by nightfall on August 8. That night, as the transports unloaded, the Allied warships screening the transports were surprised and defeated by an Imperial fleet of seven <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s and one <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>, commanded by Japanese Vice Admiral <a href="Gunichi%20Mikawa">Gunichi Mikawa</a>. One Australian and three U.S. cruisers were sunk and one other U.S. cruiser and two destroyers were damaged in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Savo%20Island">Battle of Savo Island</a>. Turner withdrew all remaining Allied naval forces by the evening of August 9 without unloading all of the heavy equipment, provisions, and troops from the transports, although most of the divisional artillery was landed, consisting of thirty-two 75 mm and 105 mm howitzers. Only five days worth of rations were landed.

The Marines ashore on Guadalcanal initially concentrated on forming a defense perimeter around the airfield, moving the landed supplies within the perimeter, and finishing the airfield. Vandegrift placed his 11,000 troops on Guadalcanal in a loose perimeter around the Lunga Point area. In four days of intense effort, the supplies were moved from the landing beach into dispersed dumps within the perimeter. Work began on the airfield immediately, mainly using captured Japanese equipment. On August 12, the airfield was named <a href="Honiara%20International%20Airport">Henderson Field</a> after Major <a href="Lofton%20Henderson">Lofton Henderson</a>, a Marine aviator who had been killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a>. Captured Japanese stock increased the total supply of food to 14 days worth. To conserve the limited food supplies, the Allied troops were limited to two meals per day.

In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a> assigned the Imperial Japanese Army's 17th Army, a <a href="corps">corps</a>-sized command based at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> and under the command of Lieutenant-General <a href="Harukichi%20Hyakutake">Harukichi Hyakutake</a>, with the task of retaking Guadalcanal from Allied forces. The 17th Army, currently heavily involved with the Japanese campaign in New Guinea, had only a few units available to send to the southern Solomons area. Of these units, the 35th Infantry Brigade under Major General <a href="Kiyotake%20Kawaguchi">Kiyotake Kawaguchi</a> was at <a href="Palau">Palau</a>, the 4th (Aoba) Infantry Regiment was in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, and the 28th (Ichiki) Infantry Regiment, under the command of <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> Kiyonao Ichiki, was at sea en route to Japan from <a href="Guam">Guam</a>. The different units began to move towards Guadalcanal immediately, but Ichiki's regiment, being the closest, arrived first.

An aerial <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> of the U.S. Marine positions on Guadalcanal on August 12 by one of the senior Japanese staff officers from Rabaul sighted few U.S. troops in the open and no large ships in the waters nearby, convincing Imperial Headquarters that the Allies had withdrawn the majority of their troops. In fact, none of the Allied troops had been withdrawn. Hyakutake issued orders for an advance unit of 900 troops from Ichiki's regiment to be landed on Guadalcanal by fast warship to immediately attack the Allied position and reoccupy the airfield area at Lunga Point. The remaining personnel in Ichiki's regiment would be delivered to Guadalcanal by slower transport later. At the major Japanese naval base at <a href="Chuuk%20State">Truk</a>, which was the staging point for delivery of Ichiki's regiment to Guadalcanal, Colonel Ichiki was briefed that 2,000–10,000 U.S. troops were holding the Guadalcanal <a href="beachhead">beachhead</a> and that he should, "avoid frontal attacks."

Ichiki and 916 of his regiment's 2,300 troops, designated the "First Element" and carrying seven days' supply of food, were delivered to Taivu Point, about east of Lunga Point, by six destroyers at 01:00 on August 19. Ichiki was ordered to scout the American positions and wait for the remainder of his force to arrive. Known as the "Ichiki Butai" (Ichiki Detachment), they were an elite and battle-seasoned force but as was about to be discovered, they were heavily stricken with "<a href="victory%20disease">victory disease</a>" – overconfidence due to previous success. Ichiki was so confident in the superiority of his men that he decided to destroy the American defenders before the remaining majority of his force arrived, even writing in his journal ""18 August, landing; 20 August, march by night and battle; 21 August, enjoyment of the fruit of victory"". He concocted a brazenly simple plan: march straight down the beach and through the American defenses. Leaving about 100 personnel behind as a rear guard, Ichiki marched west with the remaining 800 men of his unit and made camp before dawn about east of the Lunga perimeter. The U.S. Marines at Lunga Point received <a href="military%20intelligence">intelligence</a> that a Japanese landing had occurred and took steps to find out exactly what was happening.

Reports to Allied forces from patrols of Solomon Islanders, including retired Sergeant Major <a href="Jacob%20C.%20Vouza">Jacob C. Vouza</a> of the <a href="British%20Solomon%20Islands%20Protectorate%20Constabulary">British Solomon Islands Protectorate Constabulary</a>, under the direction of <a href="Martin%20Clemens">Martin Clemens</a>, a <a href="coastwatchers">coastwatcher</a> and officer in the <a href="British%20Solomon%20Islands%20Protectorate%20Defence%20Force">British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force</a> (BSIPDF), along with Allied intelligence from other sources, indicated that Japanese troops were present east of Lunga Point. To investigate further, on August 19, a Marine patrol of 60 men and four native scouts, commanded by U.S. Marine <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%29">Captain</a> Charles H. Brush, marched east from the Lunga Perimeter.

At the same time, Ichiki sent forward his own patrol of 38 men, led by his communications officer, to reconnoiter Allied troop dispositions and establish a forward communications base. Around 12:00 on August 19 at <a href="Koli%20Point">Koli Point</a>, Brush's patrol sighted and <a href="ambush">ambush</a>ed the Japanese patrol, killing all but five of its members, who escaped back to Taivu. The Marines suffered three dead and three wounded.

Papers discovered on the bodies of some of the Japanese officers in the patrol revealed that they belonged to a much larger unit and showed detailed intelligence of U.S. Marine positions around Lunga Point. The papers did not, however, detail exactly how large the Japanese force was or whether an attack was imminent.

Now anticipating an attack from the east, the U.S. Marine forces, under the direction of General Vandegrift, prepared their defenses on the east side of the Lunga perimeter. Several official U.S. military histories identify the location of the eastern defenses of the Lunga perimeter as emplaced on the <a href="Tenaru%20River">Tenaru River</a>. The Tenaru River, however, was actually located further to the east. The river forming the eastern boundary of the Lunga perimeter was actually the Ilu River, nicknamed Alligator Creek by the Marines, a double misnomer: there are no alligators in the Solomons, only crocodiles, and Alligator "Creek" was a tidal <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a> separated from the ocean by a <a href="Bar%20%28landform%29">sandbar</a> about in width and about long.

Along the west side of Alligator Creek, Colonel <a href="Clifton%20B.%20Cates">Clifton B. Cates</a>, commander of the <a href="U.S.%201st%20Marine%20Regiment">1st Marine Regiment</a>, deployed his 1st (<a href="Leonard%20B.%20Cresswell">LtCol Cresswell</a>) and 2nd battalions (<a href="Edwin%20A.%20Pollock">LtCol Pollock</a>). To help further defend the Alligator Creek sandbar, Cates deployed 100 men from the 1st Special Weapons Battalion with two <a href="M3%2037%20mm%20gun">37mm</a> anti-tank guns equipped with <a href="canister%20shot">canister shot</a>. Marine divisional artillery, consisting of both <a href="75%20mm%20Gun%20%28US%29">75mm</a> and <a href="M101%20howitzer">105mm guns</a>, pre-targeted locations on the east side and sandbar areas of Alligator Creek, and forward artillery observers emplaced themselves in the forward Marine positions. The Marines worked all day on August 20 to prepare their defenses as much as possible before nightfall.

Learning of the annihilation of his patrol, Ichiki quickly sent forward a <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> to bury the bodies and followed with the rest of his troops, marching throughout the night of August 19 and finally halting at 04:30 on August 20 within a few miles of the U.S. Marine positions on the east side of Lunga Point. At this location, he prepared his troops to attack the Allied positions that night.

Just after midnight on August 21, Ichiki's main body of troops arrived at the east bank of Alligator Creek and were surprised to encounter the Marine positions, not having expected to find U.S. forces located that distance from the airfield. Nearby U.S. Marine listening posts heard "clanking" sounds, human voices, and other noises before withdrawing to the west bank of the creek. At 01:30 Ichiki's force opened fire with <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s and <a href="Mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortars</a> on the Marine positions on the west bank of the creek, and a first wave of about 100 Imperial soldiers charged across the sandbar towards the Marines.

Marine machine gun fire and <a href="Canister%20shot">canister rounds</a> from the 37 mm cannons killed most of the Japanese soldiers as they crossed the sandbar. A few of the Japanese soldiers reached the Marine positions, engaged in <a href="hand%20to%20hand%20combat">hand to hand combat</a> with the defenders, and captured a few of the Marine front-line emplacements. Also, Japanese machine gun and rifle fire from the east side of the creek killed several of the Marine machine-gunners. A company of Marines, held in reserve just behind the front line, attacked and killed most, if not all, of the remaining Japanese soldiers that had breached the front line defenses, ending Ichiki's first assault about an hour after it had begun.

At 02:30 a second wave of about 150 to 200 Japanese troops again attacked across the sandbar and was again almost completely wiped out. At least one of the surviving Imperial officers from this attack advised Ichiki to withdraw his remaining forces, but Ichiki declined to do so.

As Ichiki's troops regrouped east of the creek, Japanese mortars bombarded the Marine lines. The Marines answered with 75 mm artillery barrages and mortar fire into the areas east of the creek. At about 05:00, another wave of Japanese troops attacked, this time attempting to flank the Marine positions by wading through the ocean surf and attacking up the beach into the west bank area of the creek bed. The Marines responded with heavy machine gun and artillery fire along the beachfront area, again causing heavy casualties among Ichiki's attacking troops and causing them to abandon their attack and withdraw back to the east bank of the creek. For the next couple of hours, the two sides exchanged rifle, machine gun, and artillery fire at close range across the sandbar and creek.

In spite of the heavy losses his force had suffered, Ichiki's troops remained in place on the east bank of the creek, either unable or unwilling to withdraw. At daybreak on August 21, the commanders of the U.S. Marine units facing Ichiki's troops conferred on how best to proceed, and they decided to counterattack. The 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, under <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="Leonard%20B.%20Cresswell">Leonard B. Cresswell</a>, crossed Alligator Creek upstream from the battle area, enveloped Ichiki's troops from the south and east, cutting off any avenue for retreat, and began to "compress" Ichiki's troops into a small area in a coconut grove on the east bank of the creek.

Aircraft from Henderson Field strafed Japanese soldiers that attempted to escape down the beach and, later in the afternoon, five Marine <a href="M3%20Stuart">M3 Stuart</a> tanks attacked across the sandbar into the coconut grove. The tanks swept the coconut grove with machine gun and canister cannon fire, as well as rolling over the bodies, both alive and dead, of any Japanese soldiers unable or unwilling to get out of the way. When the tank attack was over, Vandegrift wrote that, "the rear of the tanks looked like meat grinders."

By 17:00 on August 21, Japanese resistance had ended. Colonel Ichiki was either killed during the final stages of the battle, or performed ritual suicide (<a href="seppuku">seppuku</a>) shortly thereafter, depending on the account. As curious Marines began to walk around looking at the battlefield, some wounded Japanese troops shot at them, killing or wounding several Marines. Thereafter, Marines shot and/or bayonetted any Japanese soldier lying on the ground that moved, although about 15 injured and unconscious Japanese soldiers were taken prisoner. About 30 of the Japanese troops escaped to rejoin their regiment's rear echelon at Taivu Point.

For the U.S. and its allies, the victory in the Tenaru battle was psychologically significant in that Allied soldiers, after a series of defeats by Japanese Army units throughout the Pacific and east Asia, now knew that they could defeat the Imperial Armies in a land battle. The battle also set another precedent that would continue throughout the war in the Pacific, which was the reluctance of defeated Japanese soldiers to surrender and their efforts to continue killing Allied soldiers, even as the Japanese soldiers lay dying on the battlefield. On this subject <a href="Alexander%20Vandegrift">Vandegrift</a> remarked, "I have never heard or read of this kind of fighting. These people refuse to surrender. The wounded wait until men come up to examine them...and blow themselves and the other fellow to pieces with a hand grenade." <a href="Robert%20Leckie%20%28author%29">Robert Leckie</a>, a Guadalcanal veteran, recalls the aftermath of the battle in his book "Helmet For My Pillow", "Our regiment had killed something like nine hundred of them. Most lay in clusters or heaps before the gun pits commanding sandspit, as though they had not died singly but in groups. Moving among them were the souvenir hunters, picking their way delicately as though fearful of booby traps, while stripping the bodies of their possessions."

The battle was also psychologically significant in that Imperial soldiers believed in their own invincibility and superior spirit. By August 25, most of Ichiki's survivors reached Taivu Point and radioed Rabaul to tell 17th Army headquarters that Ichiki's detachment had been "almost annihilated at a point short of the airfield." Reacting with disbelief to the news, Japanese Army headquarters officers proceeded with plans to deliver additional troops to Guadalcanal to reattempt to capture Henderson Field. The next major Japanese attack on the Lunga perimeter occurred at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Edson%27s%20Ridge">Battle of Edson's Ridge</a> about three weeks later, this time employing a much larger force than had been employed in the Tenaru battle.

The Battle of the Tenaru is a key part of the 1945 biographical film on <a href="Al%20Schmid">Al Schmid</a>, "<a href="Pride%20of%20the%20Marines">Pride of the Marines</a>". The brunt of the Japanese assault was borne by Marines Cpl. <a href="Lee%20Diamond">Lee Diamond</a>, PFC. <a href="John%20Rivers%20%28US%20Marine%29">John Rivers</a> and Pvt. <a href="Albert%20Schmid">Albert Schmid</a>. The three were credited with 200 Japanese <a href="killed%20in%20action">killed in action</a> (KIA). Awarded the <a href="Navy%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Navy Cross</a> (America's second highest decoration) for their actions, the trio paid dearly. Rivers lost his life, while Schmid and Diamond suffered horrendous wounds. Schmid lost sight in one eye and was left with very little in the other. Shot in his arm early in the fight, Diamond's arms and hands were also ripped by the same grenade which blinded Schmid. In 2010, the battle became the climax of the first episode of <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s and <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a>' miniseries, "<a href="The%20Pacific%20%28miniseries%29">The Pacific</a>".

The Fox and the Hound (novel)

The Fox and the Hound is a 1967 novel written by American novelist <a href="Daniel%20P.%20Mannix">Daniel P. Mannix</a> and illustrated by <a href="John%20Schoenherr">John Schoenherr</a>. It follows the lives of Tod, a <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a> raised by a human for the first year of his life, and Copper, a half-<a href="bloodhound">bloodhound</a> dog owned by a local hunter, referred to as the Master. After Tod causes the death of the man's favorite hound, man and dog relentlessly hunt the fox, against the dual backdrops of a changing human world and Tod's normal life in hunting for food, seeking a mate, and defending his <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territory</a>. As preparation for writing the novel, Mannix studied foxes, both tame and wild, a wide variety of hunting techniques, and the ways hounds appear to track foxes, seeking to ensure his characters acted realistically.

The novel won the <a href="Dutton%20Animal%20Book%20Award">Dutton Animal Book Award</a> in 1967, which resulted in its publication on September 11 that year by <a href="E.P.%20Dutton">E.P. Dutton</a>. It was a 1967 "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest">Reader's Digest</a>" Book Club selection and a winner of the <a href="Athenaeum%20Literary%20Award">Athenaeum Literary Award</a>. It was well received by critics, who praised its detail and Mannix's writing style. <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Productions">Walt Disney Productions</a> purchased the film rights for the novel when it won the Dutton award, though did not begin production on an adaptation until 1977. Heavily modified from the source material, Disney's "<a href="The%20Fox%20and%20the%20Hound">The Fox and the Hound</a>" was released to theaters in July 1981 and became a box office success.

Copper, a <a href="bloodhound">bloodhound</a> crossbred, was once the favorite among his Master's pack of hunting dogs in a rural country area. However, he now feels threatened by Chief, a younger, faster <a href="Black%20and%20Tan%20Coonhound">Black and Tan Coonhound</a>. Copper hates Chief, who is taking Copper's place as pack leader. During a bear hunt, Chief protects the Master when the bear turns on him, while Copper is too afraid of the bear to confront him. The Master ignores Copper to heap praise on Chief and Copper's hatred and jealousy grow.

Tod is a <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a> kit, raised as a pet by one of the human hunters who killed his mother and litter mates. Tod initially enjoys his life, but when he reaches sexual maturity he returns to the wild. During his first year, he begins establishing his <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territory</a>, and learns evasion techniques from being hunted by local farm dogs. One day, he comes across the Master's house and discovers that his presence sends the chained pack of dogs into a frustrated frenzy. He begins to delight in taunting them, until one day when Chief breaks his chain and chases him. The Master sees the dog escape and follows with Copper. As Chief skillfully trails the fox, Tod flees along a railroad track while a train is approaching, waiting to jump to safety until the last minute. Chief is killed by the train.

With Chief buried and Master crying over a dead dog he trains Copper to ignore all foxes except for Tod. Over the span of the two animals' lives, man and dog hunt the fox, the Master using over a dozen hunting techniques in his quest for revenge. With each hunt, both dog and fox learn new tricks and methods to outsmart each other, Tod always escaping in the end. Tod mates with an older, experienced vixen who gives birth to a litter of kits. Before they are grown, the Master finds the den and gasses the kits to death. That winter, the Master sets out <a href="leg%20hold%20traps">leg hold traps</a>, which Tod carefully learns how to spring, but the vixen is caught and killed. In January, Tod takes a new mate, with whom he has another litter of kits. The Master uses a "still hunting" technique, in which he sits very quietly in the wood while playing a rabbit call to draw out the foxes. With this method, he kills the kits; then by using the sound of a wounded fox kit, he is also able to draw out and kill Tod's mate.

As the years pass, the rural area gives way to a more urbanized setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures change—life-bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and in an odd way he looks forward to it as the only aspect of his old life that remains.

The Master spends most of his time drinking alcohol, and people begin trying to convince him to move into a nursing home, where no dogs are allowed. One summer, an outbreak of <a href="rabies">rabies</a> spreads through the fox population. After one infected fox attacks a group of human children, the same people approach the Master and ask his help in killing the foxes. He uses traps and poison to try to kill as many foxes as possible; however, the poison also kills domestic animals. After a human child dies from eating it, the humans remove all of the poison, then the Master organizes a hunt in which large numbers of people line up and walk straight into the woods, flushing out foxes to be shot. The aging Tod escapes all three events, as well as an attempt at <a href="coursing">coursing</a> him with <a href="greyhounds">greyhounds</a>.

One morning, after Tod's escape from the greyhounds, the Master sends Copper on the hunt. After he picks up the fox's trail, Copper relentlessly pursues him throughout the day and into the next morning. Tod finally drops dead of exhaustion, and Copper collapses on top of him, close to death himself. The Master nurses Copper back to health, and both enjoy their new popularity, but after a few months the excitement over Copper's accomplishment dies down. The Master is left alone again, and returns to drinking. He is once again asked to consider living in a nursing home, and this time he agrees. Crying, he takes his shotgun from the wall, leads Copper outside, and pets him gently before ordering him to lie down. He covers the dog's eyes as Copper licks his hand trustingly.

Desiring a realistic depiction of <a href="vulpine">vulpine</a> behavior and habits, Mannix spent more than a year studying the behaviors of a mated pair of foxes that he kept at his home. He stated that they were "so tame [that he] could turn them loose and watch them hunt, fight, make love, and live an almost normal life." Additionally, he studied wild foxes and interviewed trappers, hunters, game wardens, and "Masters of Hounds" to learn what they felt foxes would and would not do. In the novel's <a href="postscript">postscript</a>, Mannix discusses this research. To defend his novel against charges of improbability, he recounts his observations of wild foxes and discusses other people's stories about fox behavior. Regarding the actions Tod takes in eluding the hunters, he details both witnessing wild foxes performing such acts and stories others shared with him that he used as a basis for some of the story's events. For example, he notes that while people have told him that foxes do not really run among sheep or cattle herds to escape hounds, he himself used to watch them do just that from his bedroom window. In the case of a fox running along train tracks as a train is approaching, Mannix drew on a story told to him by a master of hunting in the area of Whitford Sales—near <a href="Thorndale%2C%20Pennsylvania">Thorndale, Pennsylvania</a>—who had to stop hunting in the area because of a fox who consistently killed pursuing hounds on the <a href="Trenton%20Cutoff">Trenton Cutoff</a> using this method.

Mannix felt it was nearly impossible for any writer to escape imparting some <a href="anthropomorphism">anthropomorphism</a> in such a novel, as a human must guess at the way an animal's mind may work and what motivations it may have. He felt animals think differently from humans, though are capable of <a href="reason">reason</a> on a "rudimentary level compared to a human." In explaining his descriptions of hunting, he said it was hard to decide how a hound with non-human scenting ability interprets and responds to scents while tracking another animal.

The last chapter of the novel, covering Copper's last hunt of Tod, was based on the story of Boston, a fourteen-month-old bloodhound–<a href="foxhound">foxhound</a> mix, and Old Baldy, a red fox known by hunters for having outrun numerous packs of hounds put on his trail. Mannix originally read the story in a "Recreation" magazine article, which stated that in December 1887, near the <a href="James%20River">James River</a> in Virginia, Boston hunted a fox referred to as Baldy for a day and a half, covering of terrain. According to Mannix, Boston and Baldy died together, and were buried together once found. In the "Recreation" article, although Boston survived he never fully recovered and died when he was only three years old. Copper himself was based on the favorite hunting dog of Bee Dee Adkins, a nationally renowned trainer of hunting dogs with whom Mannix hunted. Some of the novel's human characters were based on the lives and mannerisms on locals living in <a href="Oro%20Valley">Oro Valley</a>, a suburb of Tucson, Arizona.

In 1967, <a href="E.%20P.%20Dutton">E. P. Dutton</a> selected Mannix's unpublished novel as the 1967 winner of its annual "<a href="Dutton%20Animal%20Book%20Award">Animal Book Award</a>"—an international competition open to new authors in which an editorial panel evaluates submissions to find the "best book-length work of adult fiction or nonfiction on animals". Along with a cash prize of $10,000, the company obtained the publication rights for the novel, releasing it in hardback form on September 11 that year. The novel was published in the United States by Dutton and in Canada by <a href="Clarke%2C%20Irwin%20%26amp%3B%20Company">Clarke, Irwin and Company</a>, simultaneously. A reprint by <a href="Pocket%20Books">Pocket Books</a> followed in 1971. The novel has been released in twelve other countries, including Finland in 1968 by <a href="Otava%20%28publisher%29">Otava</a>, and in Germany by <a href="Hoffmann%20und%20Campe">Hoffmann und Campe</a>.

"The Fox and the Hound" was selected as a <a href="Reader%27s%20Digest">Reader's Digest</a> Book Club selection in 1967 and an abridged version was printed in the fourth volume of the publisher's <a href="Reader%27s%20Digest%20Condensed%20Books">Condensed Books</a> series. The same year, it was awarded the Athenaeum Literary Award.

The "<a href="Booklist">Booklist</a>" called the novel one of "the highest level of books about animals" and praised its combination of "brilliant psychology, writing of rare beauty, and little-known hunting and animal lore". According to the "Booklist", "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>" gave the novel its "highest recommendation" and referred to it as a "marvelous evocation of the animal world". Reviewing the novel for "Best Sellers" magazine, William B. Hill considered it a "corking good novel", praising it for its "simplicity and straightforwardness" with the dog and fox being "real" rather than allegories for social issues. While he felt the novel was overly detailed in a few places, as a whole he considered the story "credible, almost all fascinating" and the characters entertaining.

Robert Ramsey of the <a href="Placerville%2C%20California">Placerville, California</a>, "Mountain Democrat" thought the book worthy of winning the Dutton award, characterizing the narrative as "always interesting" and principal characters Tod and Copper as "unforgettable", while praising Mannix's "ability to enter into the world of animals and portray it". A reviewer for the "Catholic Library World" considered it a "memorable and delightful reading experience" written by a man "who knows the ways of foxes". Author and <a href="Sportsperson">sportsman</a> Richard Alden Knight praised the novel, stating that it "surpasses any writing I have ever encountered on the thinking processes of animals" and that the story of a duel between natural enemies is "told well and written with feeling". A reviewer for the "<a href="Reading%20Eagle">Reading Eagle</a>" felt Mannix wrote well enough to make a reader feel like they were the characters Tod and Copper and that the story was "really exciting" due to the "dramatic opposition" of the two animals.

<a href="Walt%20Disney%20Pictures">Walt Disney Pictures</a> purchased the film rights to "The Fox and the Hound" when it was awarded the Dutton Animal Book Award. Production on a film adaptation began in 1977 and it would become the most expensive animated film produced at the time, at a cost of $12 million. To craft the film, then Disney CEO Ron Miller decided to mainly use new talent to make their debuts with the film, as the pioneers of the company, referred to as the "Nine Old Men", were nearing retirement. The animators and screenplay writers were primarily new, as were the film directors <a href="Art%20Stevens">Art Stevens</a>, Ted Berman, and <a href="Richard%20Rich%20%28director%29">Richard Rich</a>. It would be the last film <a href="Ollie%20Johnston">Ollie Johnston</a>, <a href="Frank%20Thomas%20%28animator%29">Frank Thomas</a>, and <a href="Woolie%20Reitherman">Woolie Reitherman</a>, considered "legends" of Disney, would work on. However, the transition between the old guard and the new resulted in arguments over how to handle the film. Reitherman had his own ideas on the designs and layouts that should be used; however, the newer team backed Stevens, except <a href="Don%20Bluth">Don Bluth</a>, who felt Disney's work was stale. Bluth walked out, taking eleven others with him, and formed his own animation studio. The exodus of the animators forced the cancellation of the film's original Christmas 1980 premiere while new artists were hired.

Along the way, the story was greatly modified to make it more suitable as a <a href="family%20film">family film</a>. By the time it was completed in 1981, the film had changed into a chronicle of the unlikely friendship of two creatures, who should be natural enemies and who learn society sometimes tries to determine their roles despite their better impulses. In the original screenplay, Chief was slated to die the same as in the novel, but Stevens did not want to have an on-screen death and modified the film so that he survived.

The film premiered theatrically in the United States on July 10, 1981. It was an immediate success, grossing $39,900,000 to become the 14th top film of the year. It was subsequently re-released theatrically on March 25, 1988, and saw its first home video release on March 1, 1994.

Slate industry in Wales

The existence of a slate industry in Wales is attested since the <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman period</a>, when <a href="slate">slate</a> was used to <a href="roof">roof</a> the fort at <a href="Segontium%20Roman%20Fort">Segontium</a>, now <a href="Caernarfon">Caernarfon</a>. The slate industry grew slowly until the early 18th century, then expanded rapidly until the late 19th century, at which time the most important slate producing areas were in northwest <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, including the <a href="Penrhyn%20Quarry">Penrhyn Quarry</a> near <a href="Bethesda%2C%20Wales">Bethesda</a>, the <a href="Dinorwic%20Quarry">Dinorwic Quarry</a> near <a href="Llanberis">Llanberis</a>, the <a href="Nantlle%20Valley">Nantlle Valley</a> quarries, and <a href="Blaenau%20Ffestiniog">Blaenau Ffestiniog</a>, where the slate was <a href="slate%20industry">mined</a> rather than <a href="quarry">quarried</a>. Penrhyn and Dinorwig were the two largest slate quarries in the world, and the <a href="Oakeley%20Quarry">Oakeley mine</a> at Blaenau Ffestiniog was the largest slate mine in the world. Slate is mainly used for roofing, but is also produced as thicker slab for a variety of uses including flooring, worktops and <a href="headstone">headstone</a>s.

Up to the end of the 18th century, slate was extracted on a small scale by groups of quarrymen who paid a royalty to the landlord, carted slate to the ports, and then shipped it to England, Ireland and sometimes France. Towards the close of the century, the landowners began to operate the quarries themselves, on a larger scale. After the government abolished slate duty in 1831, rapid expansion was propelled by the building of <a href="narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge railway</a>s to transport the slates to the ports.

The <a href="slate%20industry">slate industry</a> dominated the economy of north-west Wales during the second half of the 19th century, but was on a much smaller scale elsewhere. In 1898, a work force of 17,000 men produced half a million tons of slate. A bitter industrial dispute at the Penrhyn Quarry between 1900 and 1903 marked the beginning of its decline, and the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> saw a great reduction in the number of men employed in the industry. The <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> and <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> led to the closure of many smaller quarries, and competition from other roofing materials, particularly <a href="tile">tile</a>s, resulted in the closure of most of the larger quarries in the 1960s and 1970s. Slate production continues on a much reduced scale.

The slate industry in North Wales is on the tentative <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> list whilst Welsh slate has been designated by the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Geological%20Sciences">International Union of Geological Sciences</a> as a <a href="Global%20Heritage%20Stone%20Resource">Global Heritage Stone Resource</a>.

The slate deposits of Wales belong to three geological series: <a href="Cambrian">Cambrian</a>, <a href="Ordovician">Ordovician</a> and <a href="Silurian">Silurian</a>. The Cambrian deposits run south-west from Conwy to near <a href="Criccieth">Criccieth</a>; these deposits were quarried in the Penrhyn and Dinorwig quarries and in the Nantlle Valley. There are smaller outcrops elsewhere, for example on <a href="Anglesey">Anglesey</a>. The Ordovician deposits run south-west from <a href="Betws-y-Coed">Betws-y-Coed</a> to <a href="Porthmadog">Porthmadog</a>; these were the deposits mined at Blaenau Ffestiniog. There is another band of Ordovician slate further south, running from Llangynnog to <a href="Aberdyfi">Aberdyfi</a>, quarried mainly in the <a href="Corris">Corris</a> area, with a few outcrops in south-west Wales, notably <a href="Pembrokeshire">Pembrokeshire</a>. The Silurian deposits are mainly further east in the <a href="River%20Dee%2C%20Wales">Dee</a> valley and around <a href="Machynlleth">Machynlleth</a>.

The virtues of slate as a building and roofing material have been recognized since the Roman period. The Roman fort at Segontium, Caernarfon, was originally roofed with tiles, but the later levels contain numerous slates, used for both roofing and flooring. The nearest deposits are about five miles (8 km) away in the Cilgwyn area, indicating that the slates were not used merely because they were available on-site. During the mediaeval period, there was small-scale quarrying of slate in several areas. The <a href="Cilgwyn%20quarry">Cilgwyn quarry</a> in the Nantlle Valley dates from the 12th century, and is thought to be the oldest in Wales. The first record of slate quarrying in the neighbourhood of the later Penrhyn Quarry was in 1413, when a rent-roll of Gwilym ap Griffith records that several of his tenants were paid 10 pence each for working 5,000 slates. <a href="Aberllefenni%20Slate%20Quarry">Aberllefenni Slate Quarry</a> may have started operating as a slate mine as early as the 14th century. The earliest confirmed date of operating dates from the early 16th century when the local house Plas Aberllefenni was roofed in slates from this quarry.

Transport problems meant that the slate was usually used fairly close to the quarries. There was some transport by sea. A poem by the 15th century poet <a href="Guto%27r%20Glyn">Guto'r Glyn</a> asks the <a href="Dean%20%28religion%29">Dean</a> of <a href="Bangor%2C%20Wales">Bangor</a> to send him a shipload of slates from Aberogwen, near Bangor, to <a href="Rhuddlan">Rhuddlan</a> to roof a house at Henllan, near <a href="Denbigh">Denbigh</a>. The wreck of a wooden ship carrying finished slates was discovered in the <a href="Menai%20Strait">Menai Strait</a> and is thought to date from the 16th century. By the second half of the 16th century, there was a small export trade of slates to Ireland from ports such as <a href="Beaumaris%2C%20Anglesey">Beaumaris</a> and Caernarfon. Slate exports from the Penrhyn estate are recorded from 1713 when 14 shipments totalling 415,000 slates were sent to <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>. The slates were carried to the ports by pack-horses, and later by carts. This was sometimes done by women, the only female involvement in what was otherwise an exclusively male industry.

Until the late 18th century, slate was extracted from many small pits by small partnerships of local men, who did not own the capital to expand further. The quarrymen usually had to pay a rent or royalty to the landlord, though the quarrymen at Cilgwyn did not. A letter from the agent of the Penrhyn estate, John Paynter, in 1738 complains that competition from Cilgwyn was affecting the sales of Penrhyn slates. The Cilgwyn slates could be extracted more cheaply and sold at a higher price. Penrhyn introduced larger sizes of slate between 1730 and 1740, and gave these sizes the names which became standard. These ranged from "Duchesses", the largest at by , through "Countesses", "Ladies" and "Doubles" to the smallest "Singles".

Methusalem Jones, previously a quarryman at Cilgwyn, began to work the Diffwys quarry at Blaenau Ffestiniog in the 1760s, which became the first large quarry in the area. The large landowners were initially content to issue "take notes", allowing individuals to quarry slates on their lands for a yearly rent of a few <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s and a royalty on the slates produced. The first landowner to take over the working of slates on his land was the owner of the Penrhyn estate, <a href="Richard%20Pennant">Richard Pennant</a>, later <a href="Baron%20Penrhyn">Baron Penrhyn</a>. In 1782, the men working quarries on the estate were bought out or ejected, and Pennant appointed James Greenfield as agent. The same year, Lord Penrhyn opened a new quarry at Caebraichycafn near Bethesda, which as Penrhyn Quarry would become the largest slate quarry in the world. By 1792, this quarry was employing 500 men and producing 15,000 <a href="ton">ton</a>s of slate per year. At Dinorwig, a single large partnership took over in 1787, and in 1809 the landowner, <a href="Thomas%20Assheton%20Smith%20%281752%E2%80%931828%29">Thomas Assheton Smith</a> of <a href="Vaynol">Vaynol</a>, took the management of the quarry into his own hands. The Cilgwyn quarries were taken over by a company in 1800, and the scattered workings at all three locations were amalgamated into a single quarry. The first <a href="steam%20engine">steam engine</a> to be used in the slate industry was a pump installed at the Hafodlas quarry in the Nantlle Valley in 1807, but most quarries relied on <a href="hydropower">hydropower</a> to drive machinery.

Wales was by now producing more than half the United Kingdom's output of slate, 26,000 tons out of a total UK production of 45,000 tons in 1793. In July 1794, the government imposed a 20% tax on all slate carried coastwise, which put the Welsh producers at a disadvantage compared to inland producers who could use the <a href="Canals%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">canal network</a> to distribute their product. There was no tax on slates sent overseas, and exports to the United States gradually increased. The Penrhyn Quarry continued to grow, and in 1799 Greenfield introduced the system of "galleries", huge terraces from 9 metres to 21 metres in depth. In 1798, Lord Penrhyn constructed the horse-drawn Llandegai Tramway to transport slates from Penrhyn Quarry, and in 1801 this was replaced by the <a href="narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge</a> <a href="Penrhyn%20Quarry%20Railway">Penrhyn Quarry Railway</a>, one of the earliest railway lines. The slates were transported to the sea at <a href="Port%20Penrhyn">Port Penrhyn</a> which had been constructed in the 1790s. The <a href="Padarn%20Railway">Padarn Railway</a> was opened in 1824 as a tramway for the Dinorwig Quarry, and converted to a railway in 1843. It ran from Gilfach Ddu near Llanberis to Port Dinorwic at <a href="Y%20Felinheli">Y Felinheli</a>. The <a href="Nantlle%20Railway">Nantlle Railway</a> was built in 1828 and was operated using horse-power to carry slate from several slate quarries in the Nantlle Valley to the harbour at Caernarfon.

In 1831 slate duty was abolished, and this helped to produce a rapid expansion in the industry, particularly since the duty on <a href="tile">tile</a>s was not abolished until 1833. The <a href="Ffestiniog%20Railway">Ffestiniog Railway</a> line was constructed between 1833 and 1836 to transport slate from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the coastal town of Porthmadog, where it was loaded onto ships. The railway was graded so that loaded <a href="slate%20waggon">slate waggon</a>s could be run by gravity downhill all the way from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the port. The empty waggons were hauled back up by horses, which travelled down in <a href="Dandy%20waggon">'dandy' waggons</a>. This helped expansion at the Blaenau Ffestiniog quarries, which had previously had to cart the slate to <a href="Maentwrog">Maentwrog</a> to be loaded onto small boats and taken down the <a href="River%20Dwyryd">River Dwyryd</a> to the estuary, where it was transferred to larger vessels. There was further expansion at Blaenau when <a href="John%20Whitehead%20Greaves">John Whitehead Greaves</a>, who had been running the Votty quarry since 1833, took a lease on the land between this quarry and the main Ffestiniog to <a href="Betws-y-Coed">Betws-y-Coed</a> road. After years of digging he struck the famous Old Vein in 1846 in what became the <a href="Llechwedd%20quarry">Llechwedd quarry</a>. A <a href="Great%20Fire%20of%20Hamburg">fire which destroyed a large part of Hamburg in 1842</a> led to a demand for slate for rebuilding, and Germany became an important market, particularly for Ffestiniog slate.

In 1843, the Padarn Railway became the first quarry railway to use steam locomotives, and the transport of slate by train rather than by ship was made easier when the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">London and North Western Railway</a> built branches to connect Port Penrhyn and Port Dinorwic to the main line in 1852. The <a href="Corris%20Railway">Corris Railway</a> opened as the horse-worked Corris, Machynlleth & River Dovey Tramroad in 1859, connecting the slate quarries around Corris and Aberllefenni with wharves on the estuary of the <a href="River%20Dyfi">River Dyfi</a>. The Ffestiniog Railway converted to steam in 1863, and the <a href="Talyllyn%20Railway">Talyllyn Railway</a> was opened in 1866 to serve the <a href="Bryn%20Eglwys">Bryn Eglwys</a> quarry above the village of <a href="Abergynolwyn">Abergynolwyn</a>. Bryn Eglwys grew to be one of the largest quarries in mid Wales, employing 300 men and producing 30% of the total output of the Corris district. The <a href="Whitland%20and%20Cardigan%20Railway">Cardigan Railway</a> was opened in 1873, partly to carry slate traffic, and enabled the <a href="Glogue">Glogue</a> quarry in Pembrokeshire to grow to employ 80 men.

<a href="Mechanization">Mechanization</a> was gradually introduced to make most aspects of the industry more efficient, particularly at Blaenau Ffestiniog where the Ordovician slate was less brittle than the Cambrian slate further north, and therefore easier to work by machine. The slate mill evolved between 1840 and 1860, powered by a single <a href="line%20shaft">line shaft</a> running along the building and bringing together operations such as sawing, planing and dressing. In 1859, John Whitehead Greaves invented the Greaves sawing table to produce blocks for the splitter, then in 1856 introduced a rotary machine to dress the split slate. The splitting of the blocks to produce roofing slates proved resistant to mechanization, and continued to be done with a mallet and chisel. An extra source of income from the 1860s was the production of "slab", thicker pieces of slate which were planed and used for many purposes, for example flooring, tombstones and <a href="billiards%20table">billiard tables</a>.

The larger quarries could be highly profitable. The "Mining Journal" estimated in 1859 that the Penrhyn quarries produced an annual <a href="net%20profit">net profit</a> of <a href="Pound%20sterling">GB£</a>100,000, and the Dinorwig Quarry £70,000 a year. From 1860 onwards slate prices rose steadily. Quarries expanded and the population of the quarrying districts increased, for example the population of Ffestiniog parish increased from 732 in 1801 to 11,274 in 1881. Total Welsh production reached 350,000 tons a year by the end of the 1860s. Of this total, over 100,000 tons came from the Bethesda area, mainly from the Penrhyn Quarry. Blaenau Ffestiniog produced almost as much, and the Dinorwig Quarry alone produced 80,000 tons per year. The Nantlle Valley quarries produced 40,000 tons, while the remainder of Wales outside these areas produced only about 20,000 tons per year. By the late 1870s, Wales was producing 450,000 tons of slate per year, compared with just over 50,000 tons for the rest of the United Kingdom, which then included Ireland. In 1882, 92% of the United Kingdom's production was from Wales with the quarries at Penrhyn and Dinorwig producing half of this between them. Alun Richards comments on the importance of the slate industry:

The prosperity of the slate industry led to the growth of a number of other associated industries. <a href="Shipbuilding">Shipbuilding</a> increased at a number of coastal locations, particularly at Porthmadog, where 201 ships were built between 1836 and 1880. Engineering companies were set up to supply the quarries, notably <a href="De%20Winton">De Winton</a> at Caernarfon. In 1870, De Winton built and equipped an entire workshop for the Dinorwig Quarry, with machinery powered by overhead shafting that in its turn was driven by the largest <a href="water%20wheel">water-wheel</a> in the United Kingdom, over 50 <a href="foot%20%28length%29">feet</a> in diameter.

There were several different categories of worker in the quarries. The quarrymen proper, who made up just over 50% of the workforce, worked the slate in partnerships of three, four, six or eight, known as "bargain gangs". A gang of four typically consisted of two "rockmen" who would blast the rock to produce blocks, a splitter, who would split the blocks with hammer and chisel, and a dresser. A "rybelwr" would usually be a boy learning his trade, who would wander around the galleries offering assistance to the gangs. Sometimes a gang would give him a block of slate to split. Other groups were the "bad rockmen" who usually worked in crews of three, removing unworkable rock from the face, and the "rubbish men" who cleared the waste rock from the galleries and built the tips of waste which surrounded the quarry. One ton of saleable slate could produce up to 30 tons of waste.

The bad rockmen and rubbish men were usually paid by the ton of material removed, but the quarrymen were paid according to a more complicated system. Part of the payment was determined by the number of slates the gang produced, but this could vary greatly according to the nature of the rock in the section allocated to them. The men would therefore be paid an extra sum of "poundage" per pound's worth of slate produced. "Bargains" were let by the setting steward, who would agree a price for a certain area of rock. If the rock in the bargain allocated to a gang was poor, they would be paid a higher poundage, while good rock meant a lower poundage. The first Monday of every month was "bargain letting day" when these agreements were made between men and management. The men had to pay for their ropes and chains, for tools and for services such as sharpening and repairing. Subs (advances) were paid every week, everything being settled up on the "day of the big pay". If conditions had not been good, the men could end up owing the management money. This system was not finally abolished until after the Second World War.

Because of this arrangement, the men tended to see themselves as independent contractors rather than employees on a wage, and <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a>s were slow to develop. There were grievances however, including unfairness in setting bargains and disputes over days off. The North Wales Quarrymen's Union (NWQMU) was formed in 1874, and the same year there were disputes at Dinorwig and then at Penrhyn. Both these disputes ended in victory for the workers, and by May 1878, the union had 8,368 members. One of the founders of the union, Morgan Richards, described in 1876 the conditions when he started work in the quarries forty years before:

In 1879, a period of twenty years of almost uninterrupted growth came to an end, and the slate industry was hit by a <a href="recession">recession</a> which lasted until the 1890s. Management responded by tightening rules and making it more difficult for the men to take time off. <a href="Labor%20relations">Labour relations</a> were worsened by differences in language, religion and politics between the two sides. The owners and top managers at most of the quarries were English-speaking, <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> and <a href="Tory">Tory</a>, while the quarrymen were <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh-speaking</a> and mainly <a href="Nonconformism">Nonconformist</a> and <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a>. Negotiations between the two sides usually involved the use of interpreters. In October 1885, there was a dispute at Dinorwig over the curtailing of holidays which led to a <a href="Lockout%20%28industry%29">lock-out</a> lasting until February 1886. At the Penrhyn Quarry, <a href="George%20Sholto%20Gordon%20Douglas-Pennant%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Penrhyn">George Sholto Gordon Douglas-Pennant</a> took over from his father <a href="Edward%20Gordon%20Douglas-Pennant%2C%201st%20Baron%20Penrhyn">Edward Gordon Douglas-Pennant</a> in 1885, and in 1886 appointed E. A. Young as chief manager. A more stringent management regime was introduced, and relations with the workforce deteriorated. This culminated in the suspension of 57 members of the union committee and 17 other men in September 1896, leading to a <a href="Strike%20action">strike</a> which lasted eleven months. The men were eventually obliged to go back to work, essentially on the management's terms, in August 1897. This strike became known as "The Penrhyn Lockout".

There was an upturn in trade in 1892, heralding another period of growth in the industry. This growth was mainly at Blaenau Ffestiniog and in the Nantlle Valley, where the workforce at Penyrorsedd reached 450. Slate production in Wales peaked at over half a million tons in 1898, with 17,000 men employed in the industry. A second lock-out or strike at the Penrhyn Quarry began on 22 November 1900 and lasted for three years. The causes of the dispute were complex, but included the extension of a system of contracting out parts of the quarry. The quarrymen, instead of arranging their own bargains, would find themselves working for a contractor. The union's funds for <a href="strike%20pay">strike pay</a> were inadequate, and there was a great deal of hardship among the 2,800 workers. Lord Penrhyn reopened the quarry in June 1901, and about 500 men returned to work, to be castigated as "traitors" by the remainder. Eventually the workers were forced to return to work in November 1903 on terms laid down by Lord Penrhyn. Many of the men considered to have been prominent in the union were not re-employed, and many of those who had left the area to seek work elsewhere did not return. The dispute left a lasting legacy of bitterness in the Bethesda area.

The loss of production at Penrhyn led to a temporary shortage of slates and kept prices high, but part of the shortfall was made up by imports. French exports of slate to the UK increased from 40,000 tons in 1898 to 105,000 tons in 1902. After 1903 there was a depression in the slate industry which led to reductions in pay and job losses. New techniques in tile manufacture had reduced costs, making tiles more competitive. Eight Ffestiniog quarries closed between 1908 and 1913, and the Oakley dismissed 350 men in 1909. R. Merfyn Jones comments:

The First World War hit the slate industry badly, particularly in Blaenau Ffestiniog where exports to <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a> had been an important source of income. Cilgwyn, the oldest quarry in Wales, closed in 1914, though it later reopened. In 1917, slate quarrying was declared a non-essential industry and a number of quarries were closed for the remainder of the war. The demand for new houses after the end of the war brought back a measure of prosperity; in the slate mines of Blaenau Ffestiniog production was almost back to 1913 levels by 1927, but in the quarries the output was still well below the pre-war level. The Great Depression in the 1930s led to cuts in production, with exports particularly hard hit.

The quarries and mines made increasing use of mechanization from the start of the 20th century, with <a href="electricity">electricity</a> replacing steam and water as a power source. The Llechwedd Quarry introduced its first electrical plant in 1891, and in 1906, a <a href="Hydroelectricity">hydro-electric</a> plant was opened in Cwm Dyli, on the lower slopes of <a href="Snowdon">Snowdon</a>, which supplied electricity to the largest quarries in the area. The use of electric saws and other machinery reduced the hard manual labour involved in extracting the slate, but produced much more slate dust than the old manual methods, leading to an increased incidence of <a href="silicosis">silicosis</a>. The work was also dangerous in other ways, with the blasting operations responsible for many deaths. A government enquiry in 1893 found that the death rate for underground workers in the slate mines was 3.23 per thousand, higher than the rate for <a href="Coal%20mining">coal miners</a>.

The outbreak of World War II in 1939 led to a severe drop in trade. Part of the Manod (Cwt-y-Bugail) mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog was used to store art treasures from the <a href="National%20Gallery%2C%20London">National Gallery</a> and the <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a>. The number of men employed in the slate industry in North Wales dropped from 7,589 in 1939 to 3,520 by the end of the war. In 1945, total production was only 70,000 tons a year, and fewer than 20 quarries were still open compared with 40 before the war. The Nantlle Valley had been particularly hard hit, with only 350 workers employed in the entire district, compared with 1,000 in 1937. Demand for slate was dropping as tiles were increasingly used for roofing, and imports from countries such as <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>, France and Italy were increasing. There was some increased demand for slates to repair bombed buildings after the end of the war, but the use of slate for new buildings was banned, apart from the smallest sizes. This ban was lifted in 1949.

Total production of slate in Wales declined from 54,000 tons in 1958 to 22,000 tons in 1970. The <a href="Diphwys%20Casson%20Quarry">Diffwys</a> quarry at <a href="Blaenau%20Ffestiniog">Blaenau Ffestiniog</a> closed in 1955 after almost two centuries of operation. The nearby Votty and Bowydd quarries closed in 1963. In 1969, the <a href="Dinorwig%20Quarry">Dinorwig Quarry</a> was closed, and over 300 quarrymen lost their jobs. The following year the <a href="Dorothea%20Quarry">Dorothea Quarry</a> in the <a href="Nantlle%20Valley">Nantlle Valley</a> and the <a href="Braichgoch%20Slate%20Mine">Braichgoch Slate Mine</a> near <a href="Corris">Corris</a> announced their closure. The Oakeley mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog closed in 1971, but was later reopened by another company. By 1972, the number of men employed in the North Wales slate industry was down to under 1,000. There was little alternative employment in the slate-producing areas, and the closures resulted in high unemployment and a drop in population as younger people moved away to find work. In 1979, after a long struggle, the government recognized <a href="silicosis">silicosis</a> as an industrial disease meriting compensation. There was an increase in demand for slate in the 1980s, and although this came too late for many quarries there was still some production in the Blaenau Ffestiniog area at the Oakeley, Llechwedd and Cwt-y-Bugail quarries, though the bulk of roofing slate production was at the Penrhyn Quarry. Further mechanization was introduced, with a computerized <a href="laser">laser</a> beam being used to aid the sawing of the slate blocks.

The <a href="Penrhyn%20Quarry">Penrhyn Quarry</a> is still producing slate, though at a much reduced capacity from its heyday at the end of the 19th century. In 1995, it accounted for almost 50% of UK production. It is currently owned and operated by Welsh Slate Ltd (part of the Breedon Group ). It was previously owned by the Lagan Group, which also owned and carried out some operations at the Oakeley quarry at Blaenau Ffestiniog, the Pen yr Orsedd quarry in the Nantlle Vale, and the Cwt-y-Bugail quarry. In March 2010 the company announced its decision to mothball the Oakeley quarry because of subsidence at the site.

The Greaves Welsh Slate Company produces roofing slates and other slate products from Llechwedd, and work also continues at the Berwyn Quarry near <a href="Llangollen">Llangollen</a>. The final large-scale underground working to close was Maenofferen, associated with the Llechwedd tourist mine, in 1999: part of this site, now effectively amalgamated with Votty / Bowydd, is still worked by untopping. The <a href="Wales%20Millennium%20Centre">Wales Millennium Centre</a> in <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> uses waste slate in many different colours in its design: purple slate from Penrhyn, blue from Cwt-y-Bugail, green from Nantlle, grey from Llechwedd, and black from Corris.

Part of the Dinorwig Slate Quarry is now within the Padarn Country Park, and the other part houses the <a href="Dinorwig%20power%20station">Dinorwig power station</a> in caverns under the old quarry workings. The <a href="National%20Slate%20Museum">National Slate Museum</a> is located in some of the quarry workshops. The museum has displays including Victorian slate-workers' cottages that once stood at Tanygrisiau near Blaenau Ffestiniog. As well as many exhibits, it has the multi-media display "To Steal a Mountain", showing the lives and work of the men who quarried slate here. The museum has the largest working water wheel in the United Kingdom, which is available for viewing via several walkways, and a restored incline formerly used to carry slate waggons uphill and downhill.

In Blaenau Ffestiniog, the <a href="Llechwedd%20Slate%20Caverns">Llechwedd Slate Caverns</a> have been converted into a visitor attraction. Visitors can travel on the Miners' Tramway or descend into the Deep Mine, via a <a href="funicular%20railway">funicular railway</a> which uses an old incline, to explore this former slate mine and learn how slate was extracted and processed and about the lives of the miners. The Deep Mine, opened in 1979, is accessed by Britain's steepest passenger railway, with a gradient of 1:1.8 or 30°. In the chambers, formed by slate extraction, sound and light is used to tell the story of the mine and mining. The Braichgoch slate mines at Corris have been converted into a tourist attraction named "King Arthur's Labyrinth" where visitors are taken underground by boat along a subterranean river. They then walk through the caverns to see audiovisual presentations of the <a href="King%20Arthur">Arthurian</a> legends and stories from the <a href="Mabinogion">Mabinogion</a> and the tales of <a href="Taliesin">Taliesin</a>. The Llwyngwern slate quarry near <a href="Machynlleth">Machynlleth</a> is now the site of the <a href="Centre%20for%20Alternative%20Technology">Centre for Alternative Technology</a>. A number of the railways which carried the slates to the ports have been restored as tourist attractions, for example the Ffestiniog Railway and the Talyllyn Railway.

The Welsh slate industry was essentially a Welsh-speaking industry. Most of the workforce in the main slate-producing areas of North Wales were drawn from the local area, with little immigration from outside Wales. The industry had a considerable influence on the culture of the area and on that of Wales as a whole. The "caban", the cabin where the quarrymen gathered for their lunch break, was often the scene of wide-ranging discussions, which were often formally minuted. A surviving set of <a href="minutes">minutes</a> from a "caban" at the Llechwedd mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog for 1908–10 records discussions on <a href="Disestablishmentarianism">Church Disestablishment</a>, <a href="Protectionism">tariff reform</a> and other political topics. <a href="Eisteddfod">Eisteddfod</a>au were held, poetry composed and discussed and most of the larger quarries had their own <a href="Brass%20band">band</a>, with the Oakley band particularly famous. Burn calculates that there are around fifty men judged worthy of an entry in the "<a href="Dictionary%20of%20Welsh%20Biography">Dictionary of Welsh Biography</a>" who started their working lives as slate quarrymen, compared to only four owners, though obviously there was also a distinct disparity in the numbers of the two groups.

A number of <a href="Literature%20of%20Wales%20%28Welsh%20language%29">Welsh writers</a> have drawn on the lives of the quarrymen for their material, for example the novels of T. Rowland Hughes. "Chwalfa", translated into English as "Out of their night" (1954), has the Penrhyn Quarry dispute as a background, while "Y cychwyn", translated as "The beginning" (1969), follows the <a href="apprenticeship">apprenticeship</a> of a young quarryman. Several novels by <a href="Kate%20Roberts%20%28author%29">Kate Roberts</a>, the daughter of a quarryman, give a picture of the area around Rhosgadfan, where the slate industry was on a smaller scale and many of the quarrymen were also smallholders. Her novel "<a href="Traed%20mewn%20cyffion">Traed mewn cyffion</a>" (1936), translated as "Feet in chains" (2002), gives a vivid picture of the struggles of a quarrying family in the period between 1880 and 1914. "Y Chwarelwr" ("The Quarryman") produced in 1935 was the first Welsh-language film. It showed various aspects of a slate quarryman's life at Blaenau Ffestiniog.

Imagination (magazine)

Imagination was an American <a href="fantasy%20fiction%20magazine">fantasy</a> and <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a> first published in October 1950 by <a href="Raymond%20Palmer">Raymond Palmer</a>'s <a href="Clark%20Publishing%20Company">Clark Publishing Company</a>. The magazine was sold almost immediately to Greenleaf Publishing Company, owned by <a href="William%20Hamling%20%28publisher%29">William Hamling</a>, who published and edited it from the third issue, February 1951, for the rest of the magazine's life. Hamling launched a sister magazine, Imaginative Tales, in 1954; both ceased publication at the end of 1958 in the aftermath of major changes in US magazine distribution due to the liquidation of <a href="American%20News%20Company">American News Company</a>.

The magazine was more successful than most of the numerous science fiction titles launched in the late 1940s and early 1950s, lasting a total of 63 issues. Despite this success, the magazine had a reputation for low-quality <a href="space%20opera">space opera</a> and adventure fiction, and modern literary historians refer to it in dismissive terms. Hamling consciously adopted an editorial policy oriented toward entertainment, asserting in an early issue that "science fiction was never meant to be an educational "tour de force"". Few of the stories from "Imagination" have received recognition, but it did publish <a href="Robert%20Sheckley">Robert Sheckley</a>'s first professional sale, "Final Examination", in the May 1952 issue, and also printed fiction by <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>, <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a> and <a href="John%20Wyndham">John Wyndham</a>.

American science fiction magazines first appeared in the 1920s with the appearance of "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", a <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> published by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>. The beginnings of science fiction as a separately marketed genre can be traced to this time, and by the end of the 1930s the field was undergoing its first boom, but <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and its attendant paper shortages led to the demise of several titles. By the late 1940s the market began to recover again. From a low of eight active magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 in 1950, and a further 22 had commenced publication by 1954. "Imagination" was launched in the middle of this publishing boom.

The groundwork was laid in 1947, when Clark Publishing, the company that would publish the first issue of "Imagination", was incorporated in <a href="Evanston%2C%20Illinois">Evanston, Illinois</a>, by <a href="Raymond%20Palmer">Raymond Palmer</a>. He worked for <a href="Ziff-Davis">Ziff-Davis</a> as the editor of "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>" and did not leave until the end of 1949, but he launched two magazines under the Clark name before that date: "<a href="Fate%20%28magazine%29">Fate</a>", in the spring of 1948, and "<a href="Other%20Worlds%20%28magazine%29">Other Worlds</a>", the first issue of which was dated November 1949. Both of these magazines listed their editor as "Robert N. Webster", a pseudonym Palmer adopted while he was still at Ziff-Davis because of the conflict of interest. The second issue of "Other Worlds" reported that Webster and Palmer were going to edit together; by the third issue, dated March 1950, the pretense had been dropped and although there was no <a href="masthead%20%28publishing%29">masthead</a> listing the editor, the editorial was simply signed "Rap" (for "Raymond A. Palmer"). At the 1949 <a href="Worldcon">World Science Fiction Convention</a> in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, held over the weekend of 3–5 September, Palmer announced that he had left Ziff-Davis and described his plans for Clark Publishing. He also met and hired <a href="Bea%20Mahaffey">Bea Mahaffey</a>, a 21-year-old science fiction fan attending her first convention, as his assistant editor.

With "Fate" and "Other Worlds" launched, Palmer began to plan for a new magazine, to be called "Imagination". Material for the first two issues had been assembled by mid-1950, but in the early summer Palmer fell down his basement stairs and was left paralyzed from the waist down. While he was hospitalized, much of the work of editing both "Other Worlds" and "Imagination" was done by Mahaffey, who coped well, despite her inexperience. An assistant, Marge Budwig Saunder, was hired to read the <a href="slush%20pile">slush pile</a> and help out. The magazine's first issue, dated October 1950 on a planned bi-monthly schedule, appeared on news stands 1 August 1950. However, in September that year, Ziff-Davis made the decision to move to New York from Chicago; Palmer promptly contacted <a href="William%20Hamling%20%28publisher%29">William Hamling</a>, who did not want to relocate and suggested that Hamling take over "Imagination". Like Palmer, Hamling had made preparations to leave Ziff-Davis by establishing a separate publishing company, Greenleaf Publishing, and in November 1950 Hamling left Ziff-Davis and became "Imagination"'s editor and publisher.

In 1954 Hamling started a companion magazine, "<a href="Imaginative%20Tales">Imaginative Tales</a>"; in addition, his company Greenleaf Publishing was the publisher of "<a href="Rogue%20%28magazine%29">Rogue</a>", a men's magazine modelled after "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>". In 1957 the liquidation of <a href="American%20News%20Company">American News Company</a>, a major distributor, meant that many magazines had to scramble to find new distributors. Independent distributors often required that the magazines be monthly, and that they be in a larger format than the digest-size common in science fiction magazines. The larger format required higher revenue to be profitable, but in many cases it proved impossible to attract the additional advertising income that would have kept the magazines afloat. By the end of 1958, many titles had disappeared as a result, with "Imagination" one of the victims; Hamling closed down both "Imagination" and its sister magazine to invest the money in "Rogue" instead. The last issue of "Imagination" was October 1958, the 63rd issue, while "Imaginative Tales", retitled "Space Travel", ceased with the November 1958 issue. There was no indication in either magazine that the end had come, though the last issue of "Imagination" omitted its letter, book review and pen-pal columns, all of which had appeared regularly in prior issues.

Circulation figures were not required to be published annually until the 1960s, so the actual circulation figures are not known. For comparison, the more successful "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20and%20Science%20Fiction">Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</a>", which had been launched the previous year, is known to have had a circulation of just under 60,000 copies for its first issue, dated Fall 1949.

The cover story for the first issue was "The Soul Stealers" by Chester S. Geier, a regular in the Ziff-Davis magazines "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>" and "<a href="Fantastic%20Adventures">Fantastic Adventures</a>". The story was a <a href="science%20fantasy">science fantasy</a> tale of Leeta, a beautiful woman from another dimension stealing the souls of men to try to save her father. The cover illustration, by <a href="Hannes%20Bok">Hannes Bok</a>, showed Leeta on her flying steed. Other contributors included <a href="Rog%20Phillips">Rog Phillips</a>, another prolific magazine author, and <a href="Kris%20Neville">Kris Neville</a>, whose first story had been published only the year before. Neville's work appeared regularly in the first few years of the magazine; other prolific contributors included <a href="Dwight%20V.%20Swain">Dwight V. Swain</a>, <a href="Daniel%20F.%20Galouye">Daniel F. Galouye</a> and <a href="Milton%20Lesser">Milton Lesser</a>. <a href="Edmond%20Hamilton">Edmond Hamilton</a>'s work also appeared frequently towards the end of the magazine's life. The magazine often contained a long novel as the lead attraction.

In addition to less well-known regulars, some more prominent writers occasionally appeared. <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>'s "The Fire Balloons" was published in the April 1951 issue, under the title "'…In This Sign'"; the story was later incorporated into Bradbury's <a href="fixup">fixup</a>s, "<a href="The%20Martian%20Chronicles">The Martian Chronicles</a>" and "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20Man">The Illustrated Man</a>". <a href="Robert%20Sheckley">Robert Sheckley</a>'s first story, "Final Examination", appeared in the May 1952 issue. Other well-known authors who were published in "Imagination" include <a href="Poul%20Anderson">Poul Anderson</a>, John Wyndham (as "John Beynon"), <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a>, <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>, <a href="Harlan%20Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a>, Robert A. Heinlein, <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a> and <a href="Robert%20Silverberg">Robert Silverberg</a>.

"Imagination" is generally thought of by historians of science fiction as one of the weaker magazines of the 1950s, despite its relative longevity. <a href="Donald%20H.%20Tuck">Donald Tuck</a>, in his "Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy", dismissed the novels it published, saying, "not many were noteworthy, most being in the interplanetary/space opera/adventure field", and <a href="Brian%20Stableford">Brian Stableford</a>, a science fiction writer and critic, described it as dealing "primarily in routine space opera." <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a>, writing under the pseudonym "William Atheling, Jr.", which he used for some of his critical writing, remarked that it was a "widely unread" magazine. Hamling's editorial policy was consciously slanted against intellectualism. In the November 1951 issue he commented that "science fiction was never meant to be an educational "tour de force". The so-called "adult" story is nothing more than an attempt to show the reader how dumb he is and how smart the editor is." "Imagination"'s approach, he said, was to publish entertainment: "What we need is a little relaxation. And entertaining reading is one way to get it." Some readers agreed with Hamling; a 1952 issue of "Rhodomagnetic Digest", a <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>, contains approving commentary on Hamling's editorial by Gregg Calkins, a fan of the period.

Starting with the April 1951 issue, a regular column on science fiction fandom began, titled "Fandora's Box". It was written by <a href="Mari%20Wolf">Mari Wolf</a>, an active fan, for five years, and was taken over by <a href="Robert%20Bloch">Robert Bloch</a> from June 1956 through the end. The column had an excellent reputation, and was one of the few such columns in the professional magazines. Every issue carried an editorial, and a letter column appeared in every issue but the very last. A book review column began in June 1953, and appeared in every issue except the last one. It was initially by Mark Reinsberg, and was taken over by Henry Bott in May 1954 after two months in which both reviewers contributed to the column. A "Cosmic Pen Club" column, where fans could post requests for pen-pals, began in February 1957; as with the book reviews it appeared regularly, excepting only the last issue. Beginning in September 1951, the inside front cover was often used for an "Introducing the Author" feature, with short pieces by and about a writer or artist who appeared in the issue. These included photographs of the authors in question, a feature not typically found in other magazines. Among the better-known authors featured were Heinlein, Evan Hunter and Philip K. Dick. "Introducing the Author" skipped four issues from October 1954 to January 1955, and ceased altogether with the April 1956 issue. One issue, May 1953, included pictures from that year's World Science Fiction in Chicago, rather than a feature about an author. The most frequently appearing cover artists were Harold W. McCauley, Lloyd Rognan, <a href="Malcolm%20Smith%20%28artist%29">Malcolm Smith</a> and William Terry.

"Imagination" was <a href="digest%20size">digest size</a> (7.5 × 5.5 inches or 19.1 × 14.0 cm) for its first 17 issues, and then shrank slightly to a short digest size (7.25 × 5.5 inches or 18.4 × 14.0 cm) for the rest of its run, a further 46 issues. The volume number rose by one at the start of each calendar year, regardless of the number of issues. Volume 1, 1950, contained only two issues; subsequent volumes contained five to twelve issues, depending on frequency of publication. The overall issue number was printed on the spine (an unusual practice) along with the volume number. The first issue had a publication date of October 1950, and the schedule was bimonthly through the September 1952 issue except that June 1951 was followed by September 1951. The next four issues were dated October 1952, December 1952, January 1953 and February 1953, and then a monthly run began with April 1953 that lasted without a break until the July 1955 issue. The next issue was October 1955, which inaugurated another bimonthly period that ran with perfect regularity until the last issue, October 1958. The price remained at 35 cents throughout.

The title of the magazine was initially "Imagination: Stories of Science and Fantasy"; it changed with the October 1955 issue to "Imagination: Science Fiction", though this change was only on the cover and spine and was never reflected on the masthead.

The first 28 issues were 166 pages long. The page count dropped to 134 with the April 1954 issue and stayed at that length for the remainder of the run. The cover layout initially strongly resembled that of "Other Worlds" but was changed with the fifth issue, June 1951, to have a white background banner for the title. This format was retained for the rest of the magazine's life, with occasional slight variations such as using a different color for the banner background. The spine also changed from a colored spine with pale lettering, which was similar to the spine style used by "Other Worlds", to a white spine with red or blue lettering.

The publisher was Clark Publishing Company for the first two issues. The editor for those issues was Raymond Palmer, but as he was hospitalized much of the work was done by Bea Mahaffey. As a result, these two issues are sometimes indexed with Mahaffey as editor. With the third issue, Greenleaf Publishing Company became the publisher and William Hamling took over as editor, a position he retained throughout the magazine's life.

Sheshi

Maaibre Sheshi (also Sheshy) was a ruler of areas of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> during the <a href="Second%20Intermediate%20Period%20of%20Egypt">Second Intermediate Period</a>. The dynasty, chronological position, duration and extent of his reign are uncertain and subject to ongoing debate. The difficulty of identification is mirrored by problems in determining events from the end of the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> to the <a href="Hyksos%23Theoretical%20invasion">arrival of the Hyksos</a> in Egypt. Nonetheless, Sheshi is, in terms of the number of artifacts attributed to him, the best-attested king of the period spanning the end of the Middle Kingdom and the Second Intermediate period; roughly from <a href="circa">c.</a> 1800 BC until 1550 BC. Hundreds of <a href="Scarab%20%28artifact%29">scaraboid seals</a> bearing his name have been found throughout Canaan, Egypt, Nubia, and as far away as Carthage, where some were still in use 1500 years after his death.

Three competing hypotheses have been put forth for the dynasty to which Sheshi belonged. <a href="Egyptologist">Egyptologist</a>s such as <a href="Nicolas%20Grimal">Nicolas Grimal</a>, <a href="William%20C.%20Hayes">William C. Hayes</a>, and <a href="Donald%20B.%20Redford">Donald B. Redford</a> believe he should be identified with <a href="Salitis">Salitis</a>, founder of the <a href="Fifteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">15th Dynasty</a> according to historical sources and king of the <a href="Hyksos">Hyksos</a> during their invasion of Egypt. Salitis is credited with 19 years of reign and would have lived sometime between c. 1720 BC and 1650 BC. The Egyptologist <a href="William%20Ayres%20Ward">William Ayres Ward</a> and the archaeologist Daphna Ben-Tor propose that Sheshi was a Hyksos king and belongs to the second half of the 15th Dynasty, reigning between <a href="Khyan">Khyan</a> and <a href="Apepi%20%28pharaoh%29">Apophis</a>. Alternatively, <a href="Manfred%20Bietak">Manfred Bietak</a> has proposed that Sheshi was a vassal of the Hyksos, ruling over some part of Egypt or Canaan. The very existence of such vassals is debated. Finally, Sheshi could be a ruler of the early <a href="Fourteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">14th Dynasty</a>, a line of kings of Canaanite descent ruling over of the Eastern Nile Delta immediately before the arrival of the Hyksos. Proponents of this theory, such as <a href="Kim%20Ryholt">Kim Ryholt</a> and Darrell Baker, credit Sheshi with 40 years of reign starting "c". 1745 BC.

Ryholt proposed that Sheshi allied his kingdom with the <a href="Kerma%20Culture">Kushites</a> in <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a> via a dynastic marriage with the Nubian princess <a href="Tati%20%28queen%29">Tati</a>. Ryholt further posits that the son of Sheshi and Tati was Nehesy, whose name means "The Nubian", whom he believes succeeded Sheshi to the throne as the pharaoh <a href="Nehesy">Nehesy Aasehre</a>.

The <a href="Nomen%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">nomen</a> of Sheshi is inscribed on over two hundred <a href="Scaraboid%20seal">scarab seals</a>, which constitute the sole attestations of his reign. The number of scarabs attributed to Sheshi is paralleled in number only by those bearing the <a href="Prenomen%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">prenomen</a> "Maaibre", meaning ""The righteous one is the heart of <a href="Ra">Ra</a>"". Based on the close stylistic similarities between both groups of scarabs as well as their otherwise unmatched numbers, the consensus among Egyptologists is that Maaibre was the prenomen of Sheshi.
Consequently, Maaibre Sheshi is the best attested ruler of the Second Intermediate Period in terms of the number of artefacts attributed to him, with 396 seals and two seal impressions showing his nomen or prenomen. This figure is three times higher than the 123 seals attributed to the next best attested king of the period, <a href="Yakbim%20Sekhaenre">Yakbim Sekhaenre</a>.

In addition to these seals, <a href="Manfred%20Bietak">Manfred Bietak</a> has suggested that a scarab discovered in <a href="Avaris">Avaris</a> and inscribed with the name of a king ""<a href="Shenshek">Shenshek</a>"" should probably be attributed to Sheshi. This conclusion is rejected by <a href="Kim%20Ryholt">Kim Ryholt</a> and Darrell Baker, who believe that Shenshek was a separate king.

Over 80 percent of the seals attributed to Maaibre Sheshi are of unknown provenance, but the remaining 20 percent have been found throughout Egypt, <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a> and <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>, indicating widespread trade and diplomatic contacts during Sheshi's reign.

Important finds include seals from <a href="Tel%20Lachish">Lachish</a>, <a href="Gezer">Gezer</a>, <a href="Jericho">Jericho</a>, <a href="Tel%20Michal">Tel Michal</a>, <a href="Amman">Amman</a> and <a href="Tall%20al-Ajjul">Tell el-Ajjul</a> in Canaan. In Lower Egypt, three seals have been unearthed in <a href="Leontopolis%20%28Heliopolis%29">Tell el-Yahudiya</a> and <a href="Pithom">Tell el-Mashkuta</a> and a further eight are from the wider Delta region. Four seals originate from <a href="Saqqara">Saqqara</a> and a further five from the Middle Egyptian sites of Abusir el-Melek, Kom Medinet Ghurab, <a href="Hebenu">Kom el-Ahmar</a> and Deir Rifa. To the south, in Upper Egypt, a total of twenty seals are known from <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a>, <a href="Hu%2C%20Egypt">Hu</a>, <a href="Thebes%2C%20Egypt">Thebes</a>, <a href="Elephantine">Elephantine</a>, <a href="Esna">Esna</a> and <a href="Edfu">Edfu</a>,
In Nubia, seals of Sheshi have been found in the Egyptian fortresses of <a href="Uronarti">Uronarti</a> and <a href="Mirgissa">Mirgissa</a> and otherwise in <a href="Temple%20of%20Dakka">Dakka</a>, <a href="Kerma">Kerma</a>, , <a href="Aniba%20%28Nubia%29">Aniba</a>, Masmas, <a href="Faras">Faras</a>, Ukma, Akasha and <a href="Sa%C3%AF%20%28island%29">Sai</a>.
Finally, two seal impressions of Sheshi have been found in <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a>, in a context dated archeologically to the 2nd-century BC.

The seals of Sheshi are now scattered in many different museums, including the <a href="Israel%20Museum">Israel Museum</a>, <a href="Petrie%20Museum">Petrie Museum</a>, <a href="Ashmolean">Ashmolean</a>, <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>, <a href="Walters%20Art%20Museum">Walters Art Museum</a>, <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> and the <a href="Egyptian%20Museum">Egyptian Museum of Cairo</a>.

No historical attestation of Sheshi is known for certain. Sheshi is absent from the <a href="Turin%20King%20List">Turin canon</a>, a list of kings written on papyrus during the <a href="Nineteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Ramesside period</a> and which serves as the primary historical source for the second intermediate period. This is because the section of the papyrus covering the 13th to 17th Dynasties is heavily damaged and the problem of Sheshi's chronological position cannot be resolved from the document.

It is unclear whether Sheshi is mentioned in the "<a href="Manetho%23Aegyptiaca">Aegyptiaca</a>", a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of <a href="Ptolemy%20II">Ptolemy II</a> (283–246 BC) by the Egyptian priest <a href="Manetho">Manetho</a>. Indeed, the "Aegyptiaca" only reports <a href="Hellenization">Hellenized</a> names for Egyptian pharaohs and the identification of Sheshi with any particular name remains controversial.

Finally, Aharon Kempinski and <a href="Donald%20B.%20Redford">Donald B. Redford</a> have proposed that Sheshi is the historical figure that gave rise to the Biblical <a href="Sheshai">Sheshai</a>, one of the <a href="Anakim">Anakim</a> living in <a href="Hebron">Hebron</a> at the time of the <a href="Joshua%23Conquest%20of%20Canaan">conquest of Canaan</a> by the Hebrews according to . <a href="David%20Rohl">David Rohl</a> goes even further and explicitly equates Sheshi with Sheshai.

Three competing hypotheses have been proposed regarding the dynasty to which Sheshi belonged.

<a href="William%20C.%20Hayes">William C. Hayes</a>, <a href="Nicolas%20Grimal">Nicolas Grimal</a>, Redford, and Peter Clayton identify Sheshi with <a href="Salitis">Salitis</a> (also known as Saites). According to the "Aegyptiaca", Salitis was the founder of the <a href="Hyksos">Hyksos</a> <a href="Fifteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">15th Dynasty</a>. Alternatively, Bietak and Janine Bourriau have proposed that Salitis should be identified with <a href="Sakir-Har">Sakir-Har</a>, a poorly known ruler of the second intermediate period who, in contrast to Sheshi, is known to have borne the title of "Hyksos".

If Sheshi is to be equated with Salitis, then the seals of Sheshi discovered in Nubia suggest that the Hyksos allied themselves with the Nubians against the native Egyptian <a href="Thirteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">13th Dynasty</a> as soon as they arrived in the Nile Delta, an event which Grimal places c. 1720 BC. Grimal envisions Sheshi's kingdom as comprising the entire Nile Delta and the Nile valley north of <a href="Gebelein">Gebelein</a>. According to Manetho as reported by <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a> in "<a href="Against%20Apion">Against Apion</a>", Salitis reigned from <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis</a>, and fortified the existing town of Avaris, which was to become the Hyksos' seat of power.

Grimal and Hayes further equate Sheshi with <a href="Sharek">Sharek</a>, a king whose sole attestation is found on a stone slab detailing the <a href="genealogy%20of%20Ankhefensekhmet">genealogy of Ankhefensekhmet</a>, a priest who lived at the end of the <a href="22nd%20Dynasty">22nd Dynasty</a> c. 750 BC, some 900 years after Sheshi's estimated lifetime.

<a href="William%20Ayres%20Ward">William Ayres Ward</a> and the archaeologist Daphna Ben-Tor rely on <a href="Seriation%20%28archaeology%29">seriations</a> of the seals of Sheshi and other kings of the second intermediate period to date Sheshi to the second half of the 15th Dynasty, between the great Hyksos pharaohs <a href="Khyan">Khyan</a> and <a href="Apepi%20%28pharaoh%29">Apophis</a>.

<a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20von%20Beckerath">Jürgen von Beckerath</a> is less assertive about Sheshi's identity and assigns him to his combined <a href="Fifteenth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">15th</a>/<a href="Sixteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">16th</a> Dynasty, where he regroups Hyksos rulers whose chronological position is uncertain together with kings whom he sees as vassals of the Hyksos. Von Beckerath's analysis relies on the hypothesis that Manetho's 16th Dynasty comprised minor rulers of the Nile Delta region, called lesser Hyksos, who served the great Hyksos kings of the 15th Dynasty such as Khyan and Apophis.

For Manfred Bietak, the large number of attestations of Sheshi suggests that he was an important Hyksos ruler, yet his inclusion in the 15th Dynasty may be doubtful given the total absence of monuments attributable to him. Thus, Bietak concludes that Sheshi should be placed in a group of West Semitic rulers who coexisted with the 15th Dynasty, possibly as vassals or partly independently from it, and some of whom even bore the title of "Hyksos".

The existence of lesser Hyksos kings in Egypt is currently debated. Ryholt has shown that a statement in <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>' epitome of the "Aegyptiaca" indicating that the Hyksos had vassals contains a corruption of Manetho's original text. Thus, he rejects the hypothesis that the 16th Dynasty comprised vassals of the Hyksos and maintains instead that it was a native Egyptian dynasty independently reigning over the Theban region between the fall of the 13th Dynasty and the advent of the <a href="Seventeenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">17th Dynasty</a>.
These conclusions on the 16th Dynasty have been accepted by many scholars, including Ben-Tor, <a href="James%20Peter%20Allen">James Peter Allen</a>, Susan Allen, Baker and Redford. Yet, for both Redford and Bietak "without doubt, there were, under the umbrella of the fifteenth dynasty rulers, a series of vassals in southern and coastal Palestine, in Middle Egypt, and in Thebes. ... Such was the political system of the Hyksos, and typical of the <a href="Amorites">Amorite kingdoms</a> in Syria and the city-states in Palestine".

Ryholt and Baker reject the identification of Sheshi as a 15th Dynasty ruler.
Ryholt observes that early Hyksos kings, such as <a href="Sakir-Har">Sakir-Har</a> and Khyan, are known to have adopted the title "<a href="Heqa%20khasewet">Heqa khasewet</a>" meaning "ruler of the foreign countries", a title which Sheshi did not bear. In addition, the later of these two kings, Khyan, only adopted an Egyptian <a href="prenomen">prenomen</a> during the second half of his reign—a practice that was followed by subsequent Hyksos kings. In contrast, if Sheshi is to be identified with Maaibre, then Sheshi bore a prenomen. This implies either that he was a Hyksos king reigning after Khyan, in contradiction with Khyan's known successors Apophis and <a href="Khamudi">Khamudi</a> and the fact that Sheshi did not bear the title of "Heqa khasewet"; or that he belonged to another dynasty.

Consequently, Ryholt suggests that Sheshi was actually a <a href="Fourteenth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">14th Dynasty</a> ruler, the 14th Dynasty being a line of kings of Canaanite descent possibly ruling over the Eastern Nile Delta immediately before the arrival of the Hyksos 15th Dynasty. Many Egyptologists accept the existence of the 14th Dynasty based on archaeological evidence and on the fact that circa 50 kings are recorded in the Turin canon between the 13th Dynasty and the later Hyksos rulers. At the opposite, Redford proposed that these 50 kings constitute the genealogy of the Hyksos rulers and that the 14th Dynasty is chimerical.

Based on a seriation of the scarab seals of the Second Intermediate Period available in 1900, <a href="George%20Willoughby%20Fraser">George Willoughby Fraser</a> was able to date Sheshi's reign to "a short dynasty before the Hyksos invasion". More recently, Ryholt obtained a similar result using his own seriation and places Sheshi before <a href="Yaqub-Har">Yaqub-Har</a> and the great Hyksos rulers Khyan and Apophis and after Yakbim Sekhaenre, <a href="Ya%27ammu%20Nubwoserre">Ya'ammu Nubwoserre</a>, <a href="Qareh">Qareh Khawoserre</a> and <a href="Aahotepre">'Ammu Ahotepre</a>. Rolf Krauss independently reached the same conclusion. Given that the earliest 14th Dynasty ruler mentioned on the Turin canon is <a href="Nehesy">Nehesy</a>, a king who left several attestations of his reign in the Delta region, and that there is only space for one predecessor for Nehesy on the canon, Ryholt concludes that the earlier document from which the canon was copied had a <a href="Lacuna%20%28manuscripts%29">lacuna</a> preceding Nehesy. Such lacunae are noted as "wsf" on the canon and could cover any number of kings. Thus, Ryholt sees no obstacle with having Sheshi succeed 'Ammu Ahotepre and immediately precede Nehesy.

Ryholt dates Sheshi's reign to the mid 18th century BC. His main argument is the presence of seals of Sheshi and of two kings of the mid 13th Dynasty <a href="Sekhemrekhutawy%20Khabaw">Sekhemrekhutawy Khabaw</a> and <a href="Djedkheperew">Djedkheperew</a> in the Egyptian fort of Uronarti in Nubia. The fort of Uronarti was abandoned at some point in the 13th Dynasty, an event which Ryholt dates to the reign of Djedkheperew given the lack of seals attributable to subsequent kings. Ryholt thus proposes that Sheshi reigned from c. 1745 BC until 1705 BC and was a contemporary of Khabaw and Djedkheperew.

Ryholt's hypothesis regarding Sheshi comes with his dating the start of the 14th Dynasty around 1805 BC, over 90 years earlier than accepted by most Egyptologists. They propose instead that the 14th Dynasty emerged during the two decades of <a href="Merneferre%20Ay">Merneferre Ay</a>'s reign, which is dated to between 1700 BC and 1660 BC, depending on the scholar. Ay is the last 13th Dynasty pharaoh to be attested in Lower Egypt, and most scholars, therefore, contend that he abandoned <a href="Itjtawy">Itjtawy</a>, the capital of Egypt since the reign of <a href="Amenemhat%20I">Amenemhat I</a> (c. 1980 BC), in favor of Thebes as he lost control of the Delta region to the 14th Dynasty.

If Sheshi is to be identified with Salitis, the founder of the 15th Dynasty after Manetho, then he would have lived around 1650 BC, the date agreed upon by most Egyptologists, including Ryholt, for the arrival of the Hyksos in Egypt. If Sheshi lived during the second half of the 15th Dynasty between the reigns of Khyan and Apophis as Ben-Tor and Ward favor then Sheshi would have reigned c. 1600 BC.

The Egyptologists identifying Sheshi with Salitis follow Josephus, <a href="Sextus%20Julius%20Africanus">Sextus Julius Africanus</a> and Eusebius who report that Manetho credited Salitis with 19 years of reign in his "Aegyptiaca". Ryholt relies instead on a statistical method and estimates the duration of Sheshi's reign to have been between 20 and 53 years. The method consists in tallying the seals of Yakbim Sekhaenre, Ya'ammu Nubwoserre, Qareh Khawoserre and 'Ammu Ahotepre with those of Sheshi. Then, knowing that the first four of these kings reigned for at least c. 30 years, implies that they have left between 7.5 and 20 seals per year on throne. Consequently, Sheshi's nearly 400 scarabs would correspond to 20 to 53 years, which Ryholt gives as c. 40 years.

Ryholt proposes that Sheshi had at least two consorts; Tati with whom he fathered his successor pharaoh Nehesy, and an unknown queen with whom he fathered a prince Ipqu. Ryholt reached this conclusion on noting that scarabs of queen Tati and Princes Ipqu and Nehesy bear stylistic markers which are found on those of Sheshi and thus that they must have been contemporaries. In addition, "Tati" is attested as a feminine Nubian name in earlier <a href="execration%20texts">execration texts</a>, which would explain the peculiar name of Nehesy meaning "the Nubian". For Ryholt, Sheshi's motivation behind a dynastic marriage with a <a href="Kerma%20Culture">Kushite</a> princess was to ally his kingdom with the Nubians. Ryholt's hypothesis concerning Nehesy may be vindicated by a number of scarabs giving Nehesy the titles of "king's son" and of "eldest king son", indicating that Nehesy's father was a king as well. In addition, both Nehesy and Ipqu bore the titles of "king's son of Ra", a conflation of the titles "son of Ra" and "king's son", which could indicate that they were appointed junior coregents by Sheshi.

These conclusions are shared by Baker but rejected by Ben-Tor, who argues not only that Nehesy reigned before Sheshi but also that the Nehesy referred to as "king's son" was a later Hyksos prince. In 2005 a stele of Nehesy was discovered in the fortress city of <a href="Tjaru">Tjaru</a>, the starting point of the "Way of Horus", the major road leading out of Egypt into Canaan. The stele shows a "king's son Nehesy" offering oil to the god <a href="Banebdjedet">Banebdjedet</a> and also bears an inscription mentioning the "king's sister <a href="Tany">Tany</a>". A woman with this name and title is known from other sources around the time of the Hyksos pharaoh Apophis c. 1570 BC. This suggests that the "king's son Nehesy" of the stela lived c. 1570 BC as well, over 100 years after King Nehesy's estimated lifetime. This could be confirmed by Ben-Tor's observation that the scarabs referring to the "king's son Nehesy" are different in style from those referring to king Nehesy. In this situation, the "king's son Nehesy" would be a Hyksos prince different from the better-known king Nehesy.

Jack the Ripper

Jack the Ripper was an unidentified <a href="serial%20killer">serial killer</a> generally believed to have been active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the <a href="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</a> district of <a href="London">London</a> in 1888. In both the criminal case files and contemporary journalistic accounts, the killer was called the Whitechapel Murderer and Leather Apron.

Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End of London</a> whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations. The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge. Rumours that the murders were connected intensified in September and October 1888, and letters were received by media outlets and <a href="Scotland%20Yard">Scotland Yard</a> from a writer or writers purporting to be the murderer. The name "Jack the Ripper" originated in a <a href="Dear%20Boss%20letter">letter</a> written by someone claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media. The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax and may have been written by journalists in an attempt to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers' circulation. The <a href="From%20Hell%20letter">"From Hell" letter</a> received by <a href="George%20Lusk">George Lusk</a> of the <a href="Whitechapel%20Vigilance%20Committee">Whitechapel Vigilance Committee</a> came with half of a preserved human kidney, purportedly taken from one of the victims. The public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer known as "Jack the Ripper", mainly because of the extraordinarily brutal nature of the murders, and because of media treatment of the events.

Extensive newspaper coverage bestowed widespread and enduring international notoriety on the Ripper, and the legend solidified. A police investigation into a series of eleven brutal <a href="Whitechapel%20murders">killings in Whitechapel</a> up to 1891 was unable to connect all the killings conclusively to the murders of 1888. Five victims—<a href="Mary%20Ann%20Nichols">Mary Ann Nichols</a>, <a href="Annie%20Chapman">Annie Chapman</a>, <a href="Elizabeth%20Stride">Elizabeth Stride</a>, <a href="Catherine%20Eddowes">Catherine Eddowes</a>, and <a href="Mary%20Jane%20Kelly">Mary Jane Kelly</a>—are known as the "canonical five" and their murders between 31 August and 9 November 1888 are often considered the most likely to be linked. The murders were never solved, and the legends surrounding them became a combination of genuine historical research, folklore, and <a href="pseudohistory">pseudohistory</a>. The term "ripperology" was coined to describe the study and analysis of the Ripper cases. There are now over one hundred <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper%20suspects">hypotheses about the Ripper's identity</a>, and the murders have inspired <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper%20in%20fiction">many works of fiction</a>.

In the mid-19th century, Britain experienced an influx of <a href="Irish%20diaspora">Irish immigrants</a> who swelled the populations of the major cities, including the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End of London</a>. From 1882, Jewish refugees from <a href="pogrom">pogrom</a>s in <a href="Tsardom%20of%20Russia">Tsarist Russia</a> and other areas of <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a> emigrated into the same area. The parish of <a href="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</a> in London's East End became increasingly overcrowded. Work and housing conditions worsened, and a significant economic underclass developed. Robbery, violence, and alcohol dependency were commonplace, and the endemic poverty drove many women to prostitution. In October 1888, London's <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police Service</a> estimated that there were 62 brothels and 1,200 women working as prostitutes in Whitechapel. The economic problems were accompanied by a steady rise in social tensions. Between 1886 and 1889, frequent demonstrations led to police intervention and public unrest, such as <a href="Bloody%20Sunday%20%281887%29">that of 13 November 1887</a>. Anti-semitism, crime, <a href="Nativism%20%28politics%29">nativism</a>, racism, social disturbance, and severe deprivation influenced public perceptions that Whitechapel was a notorious den of immorality. In 1888, such perceptions were strengthened when a series of vicious and grotesque murders attributed to "Jack the Ripper" received unprecedented coverage in the media.

The large number of attacks against women in the East End during this time adds uncertainty to how many victims were killed by the same person. Eleven separate murders, stretching from 1888 to 1891, were included in a London <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police Service</a> investigation and were known collectively in the police docket as the "<a href="Whitechapel%20murders">Whitechapel murders</a>". Opinions vary as to whether these murders should be linked to the same culprit, but five of the eleven Whitechapel murders, known as the "canonical five", are widely believed to be the work of Jack the Ripper. Most experts point to deep throat slashes, abdominal and genital-area mutilation, removal of internal organs, and progressive facial mutilations as the distinctive features of the Ripper's "<a href="modus%20operandi">modus operandi</a>". The first two cases in the Whitechapel murders file, those of <a href="Emma%20Elizabeth%20Smith">Emma Elizabeth Smith</a> and <a href="Martha%20Tabram">Martha Tabram</a>, are not included in the canonical five.

Smith was robbed and sexually assaulted in <a href="Osborn%20Street">Osborn Street</a>, Whitechapel, on 1888. A blunt object was inserted into her <a href="vagina">vagina</a>, rupturing her <a href="peritoneum">peritoneum</a>. She developed <a href="peritonitis">peritonitis</a> and died the following day at <a href="London%20Hospital">London Hospital</a>. She said that she had been attacked by two or three men, one of whom was a teenager. The attack was linked to the later murders by the press, but most authors attribute it to gang violence unrelated to the Ripper case.

Tabram was killed on 7 August 1888; she had suffered 39 stab wounds. The savagery of the murder, the lack of obvious motive, and the closeness of the location (George Yard, Whitechapel) and date to those of the later Ripper murders led police to link them. The attack differs from the canonical murders in that Tabram was stabbed rather than slashed at the throat and abdomen, and many experts do not connect it with the later murders because of the difference in the wound pattern.

The canonical five Ripper victims are <a href="Mary%20Ann%20Nichols">Mary Ann Nichols</a>, <a href="Annie%20Chapman">Annie Chapman</a>, <a href="Elizabeth%20Stride">Elizabeth Stride</a>, <a href="Catherine%20Eddowes">Catherine Eddowes</a>, and <a href="Mary%20Jane%20Kelly">Mary Jane Kelly</a>.

Nichols' body was discovered at about on Friday 1888 in Buck's Row (now <a href="Durward%20Street">Durward Street</a>), Whitechapel. The throat was severed by two cuts, and the lower part of the abdomen was partly ripped open by a deep, jagged wound. Several other incisions on the abdomen were caused by the same knife.

Chapman's body was discovered at about on Saturday 1888 near a doorway in the back yard of 29 <a href="Hanbury%20Street">Hanbury Street</a>, <a href="Spitalfields">Spitalfields</a>. As in the case of Mary Ann Nichols, the throat was severed by two cuts. The abdomen was slashed entirely open, and it was later discovered that the <a href="uterus">uterus</a> had been removed. At the inquest, one witness described seeing Chapman at about with a dark-haired man of "shabby-genteel" appearance.

Stride and Eddowes were killed in the early morning of Sunday 1888. Stride's body was discovered at about in Dutfield's Yard, off Berner Street (now <a href="Henriques%20Street">Henriques Street</a>) in Whitechapel. The cause of death was one clear-cut incision which severed the main artery on the left side of the neck. The absence of mutilations to the abdomen has led to uncertainty about whether Stride's murder should be attributed to the Ripper or whether he was interrupted during the attack. Witnesses thought that they saw Stride with a man earlier that night but gave differing descriptions: some said that her companion was fair, others dark; some said that he was shabbily dressed, others well-dressed.

Eddowes' body was found in <a href="Mitre%20Square">Mitre Square</a> in the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>, three-quarters of an hour after Stride's. The throat was severed and the abdomen was ripped open by a long, deep, jagged wound. The left kidney and the major part of the uterus had been removed. A local man named <a href="Joseph%20Lawende">Joseph Lawende</a> had passed through the square with two friends shortly before the murder, and he described seeing a fair-haired man of shabby appearance with a woman who may have been Eddowes. His companions were unable to confirm his description. Eddowes' and Stride's murders were later called the "double event". Part of Eddowes' bloodied apron was found at the entrance to a tenement in Goulston Street, Whitechapel. Some writing on the wall above the apron piece became known as the <a href="Goulston%20Street%20graffito">Goulston Street graffito</a> and seemed to implicate a Jew or Jews, but it was unclear whether the graffito was written by the murderer as he dropped the apron piece, or was merely incidental. Such graffiti were commonplace in Whitechapel. <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Police%20of%20the%20Metropolis">Police Commissioner</a> <a href="Charles%20Warren">Charles Warren</a> feared that the graffito might spark <a href="Anti-semitism">anti-semitic</a> riots and ordered it washed away before dawn.

Kelly's mutilated and disembowelled body was discovered lying on the bed in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, off <a href="Dorset%20Street%2C%20London">Dorset Street, Spitalfields</a>, at on Friday 1888. The throat had been severed down to the spine, and the abdomen almost emptied of its organs. The heart was missing.

The canonical five murders were perpetrated at night, on or close to a weekend, either at the end of a month or a week (or so) after. The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded, except for that of Stride, whose attacker may have been interrupted. Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's uterus was taken; Eddowes had her uterus and a kidney removed and her face mutilated; and Kelly's body was eviscerated and her face hacked away, though only her heart was missing from the crime scene.

Historically, the belief that these five crimes were committed by the same man is derived from contemporary documents that link them together to the exclusion of others. In 1894, Sir <a href="Melville%20Macnaghten">Melville Macnaghten</a>, Assistant <a href="Chief%20Constable">Chief Constable</a> of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police Service</a> and Head of the <a href="Criminal%20Investigation%20Department">Criminal Investigation Department</a> (CID), wrote a report that stated: "the Whitechapel murderer had 5 victims—& 5 victims only". Similarly, the canonical five victims were linked together in a letter written by police surgeon <a href="Thomas%20Bond%20%28British%20physician%29">Thomas Bond</a> to <a href="Robert%20Anderson%20%28police%20official%29">Robert Anderson</a>, head of the London CID, on 1888. Some researchers have posited that some of the murders were undoubtedly the work of a single killer but an unknown larger number of killers acting independently were responsible for the others. Authors Stewart P. Evans and <a href="Donald%20Rumbelow">Donald Rumbelow</a> argue that the canonical five is a "Ripper myth" and that three cases (Nichols, Chapman, and Eddowes) can be definitely linked but there is less certainty over Stride and Kelly. Conversely, others suppose that the six murders between Tabram and Kelly were the work of a single killer. Dr Percy Clark, assistant to the examining pathologist <a href="George%20Bagster%20Phillips">George Bagster Phillips</a>, linked only three of the murders and thought that the others were perpetrated by "weak-minded individual[s] ... induced to emulate the crime". Macnaghten did not join the police force until the year after the murders, and his memorandum contains serious factual errors about possible suspects.

Kelly is generally considered to be the Ripper's final victim, and it is assumed that the crimes ended because of the culprit's death, imprisonment, institutionalisation, or emigration. The Whitechapel murders file details another four murders that happened after the canonical five: those of Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, the Pinchin Street torso, and Frances Coles.

Mylett was found strangled in Clarke's Yard, High Street, <a href="Poplar%2C%20London">Poplar</a> on 1888. There was no sign of a struggle, and the police believed that she had accidentally hanged herself on her collar while in a drunken stupor or committed suicide. Nevertheless, the inquest jury returned a verdict of murder.

McKenzie was killed on 17 July 1889 by severance of the left <a href="external%20carotid%20artery">carotid artery</a>. Several minor bruises and cuts were found on the body, discovered in Castle Alley, Whitechapel. One of the examining pathologists, <a href="Thomas%20Bond%20%28British%20physician%29">Thomas Bond</a>, believed this to be a Ripper murder, though his colleague <a href="George%20Bagster%20Phillips">George Bagster Phillips</a>, who had examined the bodies of three previous victims, disagreed. Later writers are also divided between those who think that her murderer copied the Ripper's "modus operandi" to deflect suspicion from himself, and those who ascribe it to the Ripper.

"The Pinchin Street torso" was a headless and legless torso of an unidentified woman found under a railway arch in Pinchin Street, Whitechapel, on 1889. It seems probable that the murder was committed elsewhere and that parts of the dismembered body were dispersed for disposal.

Coles was killed on 13 February 1891 under a railway arch at Swallow Gardens, Whitechapel. Her throat was cut but the body was not mutilated. <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper%20suspects%23James%20Thomas%20Sadler">James Thomas Sadler</a> was seen earlier with her and was arrested by the police, charged with her murder, and briefly thought to be the Ripper. He was discharged from court for lack of evidence on 1891.

In addition to the eleven Whitechapel murders, commentators have linked other attacks to the Ripper. In the case of "Fairy Fay", it is unclear whether the attack was real or fabricated as a part of Ripper lore. "Fairy Fay" was a nickname given to a victim allegedly found on 1887 "after a stake had been thrust through her abdomen", but there were no recorded murders in Whitechapel at or around Christmas 1887. "Fairy Fay" seems to have been created through a confused press report of the murder of Emma Elizabeth Smith, who had a stick or other blunt object shoved into her vagina. Most authors agree that the victim "Fairy Fay" never existed.

Annie Millwood was admitted to Whitechapel workhouse infirmary with stab wounds in the legs and lower torso on 1888. She was discharged but died from apparently natural causes aged 38 on 1888. She was later postulated as the Ripper's first victim, but the attack cannot be linked definitely. Another supposed early victim was Ada Wilson, who reportedly survived being stabbed twice in the neck on 1888. Annie Farmer resided at the same lodging house as Martha Tabram and reported an attack on 1888. She had a superficial cut on her throat, but it was possibly self-inflicted.

"The <a href="Whitehall%20Mystery">Whitehall Mystery</a>" was a term coined for the discovery of a headless torso of a woman on 1888 in the basement of the new <a href="Norman%20Shaw%20Buildings">Metropolitan Police headquarters</a> being built in <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a>. An arm belonging to the body was previously discovered floating in the <a href="river%20Thames">river Thames</a> near <a href="Pimlico">Pimlico</a>, and one of the legs was subsequently discovered buried near where the torso was found. The other limbs and head were never recovered and the body was never identified. The mutilations were similar to those in the Pinchin Street case, where the legs and head were severed but not the arms. The Whitehall Mystery and the Pinchin Street case may have been part of a series of murders called the "<a href="Thames%20Torso%20Murders%20of%201887%E2%80%931889">Thames Mysteries</a>", committed by a single serial killer dubbed the "Torso killer". It is debatable whether Jack the Ripper and the "Torso killer" were the same person or separate serial killers active in the same area. The "modus operandi" of the Torso killer differed from that of the Ripper, and police at the time discounted any connection between the two. Elizabeth Jackson was a prostitute whose various body parts were collected from the river Thames over a three-week period in June 1889. She may have been another victim of the "Torso killer".

John Gill, a seven-year-old boy, was found murdered in <a href="Manningham%2C%20Bradford">Manningham, Bradford</a>, on 1888. His legs had been severed, his abdomen opened, his intestines drawn out, and his heart and one ear removed. The similarities with the murder of Mary Kelly led to press speculation that the Ripper had killed him. The boy's employer, milkman William Barrett, was twice arrested for the murder but was released due to insufficient evidence. No one else was ever prosecuted.

<a href="Carrie%20Brown%20%28murder%20victim%29">Carrie Brown</a> (nicknamed "Shakespeare", reportedly for quoting <a href="Shakespeare%27s%20sonnets">Shakespeare's sonnets</a>) was strangled with clothing and then mutilated with a knife on 1891 in New York City. Her body was found with a large tear through her groin area and superficial cuts on her legs and back. No organs were removed from the scene, though an ovary was found upon the bed, either purposely removed or unintentionally dislodged. At the time, the murder was compared to those in Whitechapel, though the Metropolitan Police eventually ruled out any connection.

The surviving police files on the Whitechapel murders allow a detailed view of investigative procedure in the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>. A large team of policemen conducted house-to-house inquiries throughout Whitechapel. Forensic material was collected and examined. Suspects were identified, traced, and either examined more closely or eliminated from the inquiry. Modern police work follows the same pattern. More than 2,000 people were interviewed, "upwards of 300" people were investigated, and 80 people were detained.

The investigation was initially conducted by the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police</a> Whitechapel (H) Division <a href="Criminal%20Investigation%20Department">Criminal Investigation Department</a> (CID) headed by Detective Inspector <a href="Edmund%20Reid">Edmund Reid</a>. After the murder of Nichols, Detective Inspectors <a href="Frederick%20Abberline">Frederick Abberline</a>, <a href="Henry%20Moore%20%28police%20officer%29">Henry Moore</a>, and <a href="Walter%20Simon%20Andrews">Walter Andrews</a> were sent from Central Office at <a href="Scotland%20Yard">Scotland Yard</a> to assist. The <a href="City%20of%20London%20Police">City of London Police</a> were involved under Detective Inspector James McWilliam after the Eddowes murder, which occurred within the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>. The overall direction of the murder enquiries was hampered by the fact that the newly appointed head of the CID <a href="Robert%20Anderson%20%28police%20official%29">Robert Anderson</a> was on leave in Switzerland between and , during the time when Chapman, Stride, and Eddowes were killed. This prompted <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Police%20of%20the%20Metropolis">Metropolitan Police Commissioner</a> Sir <a href="Charles%20Warren">Charles Warren</a> to appoint Chief Inspector <a href="Donald%20Swanson">Donald Swanson</a> to coordinate the enquiry from Scotland Yard.
A group of volunteer citizens in <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">London's East End</a> called the <a href="Whitechapel%20Vigilance%20Committee">Whitechapel Vigilance Committee</a> patrolled the streets looking for suspicious characters, partly because of dissatisfaction with the police effort. They petitioned the government to raise a reward for information about the killer, and hired private detectives to question witnesses independently.

Butchers, slaughterers, surgeons, and physicians were suspected because of the manner of the mutilations. A surviving note from Major Henry Smith, Acting Commissioner of the <a href="City%20of%20London%20Police">City Police</a>, indicates that the alibis were investigated of local butchers and slaughterers, with the result that they were eliminated from the inquiry. A report from Inspector Swanson to the Home Office confirms that 76 butchers and slaughterers were visited, and that the inquiry encompassed all their employees for the previous six months. Some contemporary figures, including <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of the cattle boats that plied between London and mainland Europe. Whitechapel was close to the <a href="London%20Docks">London Docks</a>, and usually such boats docked on Thursday or Friday and departed on Saturday or Sunday. The cattle boats were examined but the dates of the murders did not coincide with a single boat's movements and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out.

At the end of October, Robert Anderson asked police surgeon <a href="Thomas%20Bond%20%28British%20physician%29">Thomas Bond</a> to give his opinion on the extent of the murderer's surgical skill and knowledge. The opinion offered by Bond on the character of the "Whitechapel murderer" is the earliest surviving <a href="Offender%20profiling">offender profile</a>. Bond's assessment was based on his own examination of the most extensively mutilated victim and the <a href="Autopsy">post mortem</a> notes from the four previous canonical murders. He wrote:

Bond was strongly opposed to the idea that the murderer possessed any kind of scientific or anatomical knowledge, or even "the technical knowledge of a butcher or horse slaughterer". In his opinion, the killer must have been a man of solitary habits, subject to "periodical attacks of homicidal and erotic <a href="mania">mania</a>", with the character of the mutilations possibly indicating "<a href="satyriasis">satyriasis</a>". Bond also stated that "the homicidal impulse may have developed from a revengeful or brooding condition of the mind, or that religious mania may have been the original disease but I do not think either hypothesis is likely".

There is no evidence of any sexual activity with any of the victims, yet psychologists suppose that the penetration of the victims with a knife and "leaving them on display in sexually degrading positions with the wounds exposed" indicates that the perpetrator derived sexual pleasure from the attacks. This view is challenged by others who dismiss such hypotheses as insupportable supposition.

The concentration of the killings around weekends and public holidays and within a few streets of each other has indicated to many that the Ripper was in regular employment and lived locally. Others have thought that the killer was an educated upper-class man, possibly a doctor or an aristocrat who ventured into Whitechapel from a more well-to-do area. Such theories draw on cultural perceptions such as fear of the medical profession, mistrust of modern science, or the exploitation of the poor by the rich. Suspects proposed years after the murders include virtually anyone remotely connected to the case by contemporary documents, as well as many famous names who were never considered in the police investigation. Everyone alive at the time is now dead, and modern authors are free to accuse anyone "without any need for any supporting historical evidence". Suspects named in contemporary police documents include three in Sir <a href="Melville%20Macnaghten">Melville Macnaghten</a>'s 1894 memorandum, but the evidence against them is circumstantial at best.

There are many and varied theories about the identity and profession of Jack the Ripper, but authorities are not agreed upon any of them, and the number of named suspects reaches over one hundred.

Over the course of the Ripper murders, the police, newspapers, and others received hundreds of letters regarding the case. Some were well-intentioned offers of advice for catching the killer, but the vast majority were useless.

Hundreds of letters claimed to have been written by the killer himself, and three of these in particular are prominent: the <a href="Dear%20Boss%20letter">"Dear Boss" letter</a>, the <a href="Saucy%20Jacky%20postcard">"Saucy Jacky" postcard</a> and the <a href="From%20Hell%20letter">"From Hell" letter</a>.

The "Dear Boss" letter, dated , was <a href="postmark">postmark</a>ed 1888. It was received that day by the <a href="Central%20News%20Agency%20%28London%29">Central News Agency</a>, and was forwarded to <a href="Scotland%20Yard">Scotland Yard</a> on . Initially it was considered a hoax, but when Eddowes was found three days after the letter's postmark with one ear partially cut off, the letter's promise to "clip the ladys (<a href="sic">sic</a>) ears off" gained attention. Eddowes' ear appears to have been nicked by the killer incidentally during his attack, and the letter writer's threat to send the ears to the police was never carried out. The name "Jack the Ripper" was first used in this letter by the signatory and gained worldwide notoriety after its publication. Most of the letters that followed copied this letter's tone. Some sources claim that another letter dated 1888 was the first to use the name "Jack the Ripper", but most experts believe that this was a fake inserted into police records in the 20th century.

The "Saucy Jacky" postcard was postmarked 1888 and was received the same day by the Central News Agency. The handwriting was similar to the "Dear Boss" letter. It mentions that two victims were killed very close to one another: "double event this time", which was thought to refer to the murders of Stride and Eddowes. It has been argued that the letter was posted before the murders were publicised, making it unlikely that a crank would have such knowledge of the crime, but it was postmarked more than 24 hours after the killings took place, long after details were known and being published by journalists and talked about by residents of the area.

The "From Hell" letter was received by <a href="George%20Lusk">George Lusk</a>, leader of the <a href="Whitechapel%20Vigilance%20Committee">Whitechapel Vigilance Committee</a>, on 1888. The handwriting and style is unlike that of the "Dear Boss" letter and "Saucy Jacky" postcard. The letter came with a small box in which Lusk discovered half of a kidney, preserved in "spirits of wine" (<a href="ethanol">ethanol</a>). Eddowes' left kidney had been removed by the killer. The writer claimed that he "fried and ate" the missing kidney half. There is disagreement over the kidney; some contend that it belonged to Eddowes, while others argue that it was a macabre practical joke. The kidney was examined by Dr <a href="Thomas%20Horrocks%20Openshaw">Thomas Openshaw</a> of the <a href="Royal%20London%20Hospital">London Hospital</a>, who determined that it was human and from the left side, but (contrary to false newspaper reports) he could not determine any other biological characteristics. Openshaw subsequently also received <a href="Openshaw%20Letter">a letter signed "Jack the Ripper"</a>.

Scotland Yard published facsimiles of the "Dear Boss" letter and the postcard on , in the ultimately vain hope that someone would recognise the handwriting. Charles Warren explained in a letter to <a href="Godfrey%20Lushington">Godfrey Lushington</a>, Permanent <a href="Under-Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Home%20Department">Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department</a>: "I think the whole thing a hoax but of course we are bound to try & ascertain the writer in any case." On 1888, <a href="George%20Robert%20Sims">George R. Sims</a> in the Sunday newspaper "<a href="Sunday%20Referee">Referee</a>" implied scathingly that the letter was written by a journalist "to hurl the circulation of a newspaper sky high". Police officials later claimed to have identified a specific journalist as the author of both the "Dear Boss" letter and the postcard. The journalist was identified as Tom Bullen in a letter from Chief Inspector <a href="John%20Littlechild">John Littlechild</a> to George R. Sims dated 1913. A journalist called Fred Best reportedly confessed in 1931 that he and a colleague at "The Star" had written the letters signed "Jack the Ripper" to heighten interest in the murders and "keep the business alive".

The Ripper murders mark an important watershed in the treatment of crime by journalists. Jack the Ripper was not the <a href="Serial%20killer%23History">first serial killer</a>, but his case was the first to create a worldwide media frenzy. Tax reforms in the 1850s had enabled the publication of inexpensive newspapers with wider circulation. These mushroomed in the later Victorian era to include mass-circulation newspapers as cheap as a halfpenny, along with popular magazines such as "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20Police%20News">The Illustrated Police News</a>" which made the Ripper the beneficiary of previously unparalleled publicity.

After the murder of Nichols in early September, the "<a href="Manchester%20Guardian">Manchester Guardian</a>" reported that: "Whatever information may be in the possession of the police they deem it necessary to keep secret ... It is believed their attention is particularly directed to ... a notorious character known as 'Leather Apron'." Journalists were frustrated by the unwillingness of the CID to reveal details of their investigation to the public, and so resorted to writing reports of questionable veracity. Imaginative descriptions of "Leather Apron" appeared in the press, but rival journalists dismissed these as "a mythical outgrowth of the reporter's fancy". <a href="John%20Pizer">John Pizer</a>, a local Jew who made footwear from leather, was known by the name "Leather Apron" and was arrested, even though the investigating inspector reported that "at present there is no evidence whatsoever against him". He was soon released after the confirmation of his alibis.

After the publication of the "Dear Boss" letter, "Jack the Ripper" supplanted "Leather Apron" as the name adopted by the press and public to describe the killer. The name "Jack" was already used to describe another fabled London attacker: "<a href="Spring-heeled%20Jack">Spring-heeled Jack</a>", who supposedly leapt over walls to strike at his victims and escape as quickly as he came. The invention and adoption of a nickname for a particular killer became standard media practice with examples such as <a href="the%20Axeman%20of%20New%20Orleans">the Axeman of New Orleans</a>, the <a href="Boston%20Strangler">Boston Strangler</a>, and the <a href="Beltway%20sniper%20attacks">Beltway Sniper</a>. Examples derived from Jack the Ripper include the <a href="Joseph%20Vacher">French Ripper</a>, the <a href="Peter%20K%C3%BCrten">Düsseldorf Ripper</a>, the <a href="Anthony%20Hardy">Camden Ripper</a>, the <a href="Blackout%20Ripper">Blackout Ripper</a>, <a href="Jack%20the%20Stripper">Jack the Stripper</a>, the <a href="Peter%20Sutcliffe">Yorkshire Ripper</a>, and the <a href="Andrei%20Chikatilo">Rostov Ripper</a>. Sensational press reports combined with the fact that no one was ever convicted of the murders have confused scholarly analysis and created a legend that casts a shadow over later serial killers.

The nature of the murders and of the victims drew attention to the poor living conditions in the East End and galvanised public opinion against the overcrowded, unsanitary slums. In the two decades after the murders, the worst of the slums were cleared and demolished, but the streets and some buildings survive and the legend of the Ripper is still promoted by guided tours of the murder sites. <a href="Ten%20Bells%20%28public%20house%29">The Ten Bells</a> public house in <a href="Commercial%20Street%2C%20London">Commercial Street</a> was frequented by at least one of the victims and was the focus of such tours for many years. In 2015, the <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper%20Museum">Jack the Ripper Museum</a> opened in east London.

In the immediate aftermath of the murders and later, "Jack the Ripper became the children's bogey man." Depictions were often phantasmic or monstrous. In the 1920s and 1930s, he was depicted in film dressed in everyday clothes as a man with a hidden secret, preying on his unsuspecting victims; atmosphere and evil were suggested through lighting effects and shadowplay. By the 1960s, the Ripper had become "the symbol of a predatory aristocracy", and was more often portrayed in a top hat dressed as a gentleman. <a href="The%20Establishment">The Establishment</a> as a whole became the villain, with the Ripper acting as a manifestation of upper-class exploitation. The image of the Ripper merged with or borrowed symbols from horror stories, such as <a href="Dracula">Dracula</a>'s cloak or <a href="Victor%20Frankenstein">Victor Frankenstein</a>'s organ harvest. The fictional world of the Ripper can fuse with multiple genres, ranging from <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> to <a href="Assault%21%20Jack%20the%20Ripper">Japanese erotic horror</a>.

In addition to the contradictions and unreliability of contemporary accounts, attempts to identify the real killer are hampered by the lack of surviving forensic evidence. DNA analysis on extant letters is inconclusive; the available material has been handled many times and is too contaminated to provide meaningful results. There have been mutually incompatible claims that <a href="DNA%20profiling">DNA evidence</a> points conclusively to <a href="Aaron%20Kosminski%23DNA%20evidence">two</a> suspects, and the <a href="Scientific%20method">methodology</a> of both has also been criticised.

Jack the Ripper features in <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper%20fiction">hundreds of works of fiction</a> and works which straddle the boundaries between fact and fiction, including the Ripper letters and a hoax <a href="Diary%20of%20Jack%20the%20Ripper">Diary of Jack the Ripper</a>. The Ripper appears in novels, short stories, poems, comic books, games, songs, plays, operas, television programmes, and films. More than 100 non-fiction works deal exclusively with the Jack the Ripper murders, making it one of the most written-about true-crime subjects. The term "ripperology" was coined by <a href="Colin%20Wilson">Colin Wilson</a> in the 1970s to describe the study of the case by professionals and amateurs. The periodicals "Ripperana", "Ripperologist", and "Ripper Notes" publish their research.

There is no waxwork figure of Jack the Ripper at <a href="Madame%20Tussauds">Madame Tussauds</a>' <a href="Chamber%20of%20Horrors%20%28Madame%20Tussauds%29">Chamber of Horrors</a>, unlike murderers of lesser fame, in accordance with their policy of not modelling persons whose likeness is unknown. He is instead depicted as a shadow. In 2006, <a href="BBC%20History">"BBC History" magazine</a> and its readers selected Jack the Ripper as the worst Briton in history.

The Acra (also spelled or Akra, from , or חקרה) was a fortified compound in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> built by <a href="Antiochus%20IV%20Epiphanes">Antiochus Epiphanes</a>, ruler of the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a>, following his sack of the city in 168 <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a>. The fortress played a significant role in the events surrounding the <a href="Maccabees%23The%20revolt">Maccabean Revolt</a> and the formation of the <a href="Hasmonean%20Kingdom">Hasmonean Kingdom</a>. It was destroyed by <a href="Simon%20Thassi">Simon Thassi</a> during this struggle.

The exact location of the Acra, critical to understanding Hellenistic Jerusalem, had been a matter of lengthy discussions. Historians and archaeologists had proposed various sites around Jerusalem, relying mainly on conclusions drawn from literary evidence. This approach began to change in the light of excavations which commenced in the late 1960s. New discoveries had prompted reassessments of the ancient literary sources, Jerusalem's geography and previously discovered artifacts. <a href="Yoram%20Tsafrir">Yoram Tsafrir</a> had interpreted a masonry joint in the southeastern corner of the <a href="Temple%20Mount">Temple Mount</a> platform as a clue to the Acra's possible position. During <a href="Benjamin%20Mazar">Benjamin Mazar</a>'s 1968 and 1978 excavations adjacent to the south wall of the Mount, features were uncovered which may have been connected with the Acra, including barrack-like rooms and a huge <a href="cistern">cistern</a>. In November 2015 the <a href="Israel%20Antiquities%20Authority">Israel Antiquities Authority</a> announced the likely discovery of the Acra in a different location, south-west of the Temple Mount and north-west of the <a href="City%20of%20David">City of David</a>.

The Ancient Greek term "acra" was used to describe other fortified structures during the Hellenistic period. The Acra is often called the Seleucid Acra to distinguish it from references to the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Baris">Ptolemaic Baris</a> as an "acra" and from the later quarter in Jerusalem which inherited the name Acra.

Following <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>'s death in 323 BCE, <a href="Judea">Judea</a> was contested between the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Egypt">Ptolemaic Kingdom</a> in Egypt, and the Seleucid Empire based in Syria and Mesopotamia. Seleucid emperor <a href="Antiochus%20III%20the%20Great">Antiochus III</a>'s victory over Egypt in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Panium">Battle of Panium</a> brought Judea under Seleucid control. The <a href="Jews">Jewish</a> population of Jerusalem had aided Antiochus during his siege of the Baris, the fortified base of Jerusalem's Egyptian garrison. Their support was rewarded with a charter affirming Jewish religious autonomy, including barring foreigners and impure animals from the <a href="Second%20Temple">Temple's precincts</a>, and an allocation of official funds for the maintenance of certain religious rituals in the Temple. Despite being allowed religious freedom, many Jews were enticed by and adopted elements of the prestigious and influential Greek lifestyle. The imperial culture offered a route to political and material advancement, and this led to the formation of Hellenistic elites among the Jewish population. <a href="Hellenization">Hellenization</a> produced tensions between observant Jews and their brethren who had assimilated Greek culture.
<a href="Antiochus%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIV%20Epiphanes">Antiochus IV Epiphanes</a> ascended the Seleucid throne in 175 BCE. Shortly afterward, Epiphanes was petitioned by <a href="Jason%20%28high%20priest%29">Jason</a> for appointment to the position of <a href="Kohen%20Gadol">High Priest</a> of <a href="Israel">Israel</a>—an office occupied by his brother <a href="Onias%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII">Onias III</a>. Jason, himself thoroughly Hellenized, furthermore promised to increase the tribute paid by the city and to establish within it the infrastructure of a Greek <a href="Polis">Polis</a>, including a <a href="Gymnasium%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">gymnasium</a> and an <a href="Ephebeum%23E">ephebion</a>. Jason's petition was granted, yet after a 42-month rule he was ousted by Antiochus and forced to flee to <a href="Ammon">Ammon</a>. In the meantime, Antiochus IV had launched two invasions of Egypt, in 170 BCE and again in 169 BCE, and routed the Ptolemaic armies. Antiochus' victories were short-lived. His intent to unify the Seleucid and Ptolemaic kingdoms alarmed the rapidly expanding <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman state</a>, which demanded that he withdraw his forces from Egypt. With Antiochus engaged in Egypt, a false rumor spread in Jerusalem that he had been killed. In the ensuing uncertainty, Jason gathered a force of 1,000 followers and attempted to take Jerusalem by storm. Although the attack was repulsed, when word of the fighting reached Antiochus in Egypt, he suspected his Judean subjects of exploiting his setback as an opportunity to revolt. In 168 BCE, Antiochus IV Epiphanes marched on and sacked Jerusalem, looting the temple treasury and killing thousands of its residents. Reversing his father's policy, Antiochus IV issued decrees outlawing traditional Jewish rites and persecuting observant Jews. Temple rituals were discontinued, Jewish observance of <a href="Shabbat">Sabbath</a> prohibited, and <a href="Brit%20milah">circumcision</a> outlawed.

To consolidate his hold on the city, monitor events on the Temple Mount and safeguard the Hellenized faction in Jerusalem, Antiochus stationed a Seleucid garrison in the city:

The name Acra derived from the Greek <a href="acropolis">acropolis</a> and signified a lofty fortified place overlooking a town. In Jerusalem, the word came to symbolize anti-Jewish paganism: a fortress of the "impious and wicked". Dominating both the city and the surrounding countryside, it was occupied not only by a Greek garrison but by their Jewish confederates as well.

The Seleucid suppression of Jewish religious life met with considerable resistance among the native population. While Antiochus was occupied in the east during 167 BCE, a rural priest, <a href="Mattathias">Mattathias</a> of <a href="Modiin">Modiin</a>, raised a rebellion against the empire. Both the Seleucid administration and the local Hellenized faction failed to grasp the magnitude of the revolt. In 164 BCE <a href="Judas%20Maccabaeus">Judas Maccabaeus</a> liberated Jerusalem and reconsecrated the Temple. Although the surrounding city had fallen, the Acra and its inhabitants held out. Maccabaeus besieged the fortress, whose inhabitants sent an appeal to the Seleucid king (now <a href="Antiochus%20V%20Eupator">Antiochus V</a>) for assistance. A Seleucid army was dispatched to put down the revolt. When it laid siege to <a href="Battle%20of%20Beth%20Zur">Beth-Zur</a>, Maccabaeus was forced to abandon his siege of the Acra and face Antiochus in battle. In the subsequent <a href="Battle%20of%20Beth%20Zechariah">Battle of Beth-Zechariah</a>, the Seleucids won their first victory over the <a href="Maccabees">Maccabees</a>, and Maccabaeus was forced to withdraw. Spared from capitulation, the Acra persisted as a Seleucid stronghold for 20 more years during which it weathered several <a href="Hasmonean">Hasmonean</a> attempts to oust the Greek garrison.

Judas was killed in 160 BCE and succeeded by his brother <a href="Jonathan%20Apphus">Jonathan</a>, who attempted to build a barrier to cut off the Acra's supply line. Jonathan had already assembled the manpower required for the task when he was forced to confront the invading army of Seleucid general <a href="Diodotus%20Tryphon">Diodotus Tryphon</a> at <a href="Beit%20She%27an">Beth Shan (Scythopolis)</a>. Having invited Jonathan to a friendly conference, Tryphon had him seized and murdered. Jonathan was succeeded by another brother, Simon, who besieged and finally captured the Acra in 141 BCE.

Two sources provide information about the ultimate fate of the Acra, although their accounts are contradictory in places. According to Josephus, Simon razed the Acra after ousting its inhabitants, and then quarried the hill on which it had stood to render it lower than the temple, purge the city of its evil memory and deny it to any future occupier of Jerusalem. The account appearing in <a href="1%20Maccabees">1 Maccabees</a> paints a different picture:

Thus in this version, Simon did not immediately demolish the Acra, but instead had it occupied and may even have resided within it himself. 1 Maccabees does not mention its ultimate fate. The fortress had been built as an internal checkpoint to monitor and control Jerusalem and its population. If situated in the <a href="City%20of%20David">City of David</a> as most scholars agree, its location would have added very little to Jerusalem's defenses against external threats. It may have fallen out of use and been dismantled around the end of the 2nd century BCE following the construction of the <a href="Hasmonean%20Baris">Hasmonean Baris</a> and Hasmonean Palace in Jerusalem's upper city.

The location of the Acra is important for understanding how events unfolded in Jerusalem during the struggle between Maccabean and Seleucid forces. This has been the subject of debate among modern scholars. The most detailed ancient description of the nature and location of the Acra is found in <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a>' "<a href="Antiquities%20of%20the%20Jews">Antiquities of the Jews</a>", where it is described as residing in the Lower City, upon a hill overlooking the Temple enclosure:

The location of the "lower part of the city", elsewhere referred to as the "Lower City", at the time of Josephus (1st century CE) is accepted to be Jerusalem's south-eastern hill, the original urban center traditionally known as the <a href="City%20of%20David">City of David</a>. Lying to the south of the Temple Mount, however, the area exposed today is significantly lower than the Mount itself. The top of the Mount is approximately above the ground level at the southern retaining wall of the later <a href="Temple%20Mount%23Achaemenid%20Persian%2C%20Hasmonean%20periods%2C%20and%20Herod%E2%80%99s%20expansion">Herodian-era</a> expansion of the Temple enclosure. The elevation decreases to the south of this point. Josephus, a native of Jerusalem, would have been well aware of this discrepancy, yet is nevertheless able to explain it away by describing how Simon had razed both the Acra and the hill on which it had stood. Archaeological research south of the Temple Mount, however, has failed to locate any evidence for such large-scale quarrying. On the contrary, excavations in the region have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium BCE down to Roman times, casting doubt on the suggestion that during Hellenistic times the area was significantly higher than it was at the time of Josephus or that a large hill had been cleared away. This had led many researchers to disregard Josephus' account and his placing of the Acra, and suggest several alternate locations. Since 1841, when <a href="Edward%20Robinson%20%28scholar%29">Edward Robinson</a> proposed the area near the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Sepulchre">Church of the Holy Sepulchre</a> as the site of the Acra, at least nine different locations in and around the <a href="Old%20City%20%28Jerusalem%29">Old City of Jerusalem</a> have been put forward.

Several researchers have attempted to place the Acra in the Upper City on Jerusalem's western hill, within the area currently occupied by the Old City's <a href="Jewish%20Quarter%20%28Jerusalem%29">Jewish Quarter</a>. These propositions seek to locate the Acra within "Antiochia", the Hellenistic polis established in Jerusalem according to <a href="2%20Maccabees">2 Maccabees</a>. This conjectural new city would have been <a href="hippodamic">hippodamic</a> in plan and therefore would have required a flat expanse of land which only the western hill could have provided. Furthermore, the eastern edge of the hill is adjacent to the Temple Mount and higher in altitude—two characteristics attributed to the Seleucid citadel.

Opponents of this proposed location point out that there is very little archaeological or historical evidence supporting the establishment of a Hellenistic polis within Jerusalem, let alone sited on the western hill which appears to have been only sparsely populated during the Hellenistic period. Excavations in today's Jewish Quarter display evidence of habitation from the <a href="First%20Temple%20Period">First Temple Period</a>, as well as renewed Hasmonean and <a href="Herod%20the%20Great">Herodian</a> settlement, but scant evidence of Hellenistic occupation. Research into the dispersal of stamped <a href="Rhodian">Rhodian</a> <a href="amphorae">amphorae</a> handles has revealed that over 95% of these handles found in Jerusalem were excavated from the City of David, indicating the city had not yet expanded to the western hill during Seleucid rule. Furthermore, the western hill is separated from the Temple Mount and the City of David by the steep <a href="Tyropoeon%20Valley">Tyropoeon Valley</a>—a distinct tactical disadvantage for any force that may have been required to intervene in events within the temple precincts or heavily populated eastern sectors of Jerusalem.

The Acra was not the first Hellenistic stronghold in Jerusalem. Sources indicate that an earlier citadel, the Ptolemaic Baris, had also occupied a location overlooking the Temple's precincts. Although the exact location of the Baris is still debated, it is generally accepted to have stood north of the Temple Mount on the site later occupied by the <a href="Antonia%20Fortress">Antonia Fortress</a>. The Baris fell to Antiochus III at the turn of the 2nd century BCE and is absent from all accounts of the Maccabean Revolt. Despite the narratives which have the Acra constructed within a very short time-span, it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege. These factors, coupled with references in which the Baris was itself called an "acra", have led some to suggest that the Baris and the Acra were in fact the same structure. Although both 1 Maccabees and Josephus seem to describe the Acra as a new construction, this may not have been the case. "Antiquities of the Jews" 12:253 may be translated to give the sense that the "impious or wicked" had "remained" rather than "dwelt" in the citadel, which could be taken to mean that the Acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the Macedonian garrison was new.

<a href="Koen%20Decoster">Koen Decoster</a> proposes that Josephus wrote of "a citadel in the lower part of the city" to an audience that would have been familiar with the Jerusalem of the 1st century CE—a city that did feature two citadels: the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace. As Josephus' Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill, "a citadel in the lower city" could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley, including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it. In his view, this is the place Josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the Acra.

Opponents of a northern location counter that this site is not supported by the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center. Unlike its predecessor and successor citadels, it was not meant as a defence against external threat, but rather to oversee the inhabited Jewish parts of the city, a role incompatible with a proposed northern location.

The available sources do indicate the Acra stood south of the temple, and because 1 Maccabees is a contemporaneous account of the Maccabean revolt, its account of the Acra (1:35–38) is considered the most reliable. Josephus provides an unlikely account of the razing of a hill on which the Acra had stood, yet his description of the end of the <a href="First%20Jewish%E2%80%93Roman%20War">Great Revolt</a> (70 CE) provides additional evidence for it being located south of the Temple Mount:

As the other buildings mentioned in the account all stood to the south in the Lower City, this also places the Acra there. This account attests to the persistence of the name "Acra" in this part of Jerusalem many years after Hellenistic rule ended and its citadels had been overthrown, and it can also be seen as referring not to a distinct building but rather to an entire region of the city. Indeed, several clauses in 1 Maccabees may be read as making a similar point:

These suggest that, after the sacking of Jerusalem by Antiochus IV in 168 BCE, at least part of the City of David to the south of the Temple Mount was rebuilt as a fortified Hellenistic quarter of Jerusalem. More than a citadel, it was a Macedonian colony where Jewish renegades and supporters of the new regime lived. This is also supported by archaeological evidence, including Rhodian amphorae handles and 18 box graves found on the eastern slope of the City of David. The latter are dated to the early 2nd century CE, and are uncharacteristic of <a href="Second%20Temple">Second Temple</a> era Jewish burial practices, yet similar to other known Hellenistic graveyards such as the one in <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">Acre (Ptolemais)</a>.

Even if the name "Acra" were applied to an entire Hellenistic quarter rather than to just a fortress, it is likely that a citadel would have stood within that compound to billet the Macedonian garrison which occupied it. It was normal for a Hellenistic city to have a fortified stronghold at or near the highest point of its walled area. Thus, whether a part of a larger enclave or independent of its surroundings, a citadel probably did stand at the northern tip of the City of David just south of the Temple Mount. Archaeologists have tried to use finds from excavations conducted in the area to pinpoint this citadel's precise location.

<a href="Yoram%20Tsafrir">Yoram Tsafrir</a> has attempted to place the Acra underneath the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount enclosure. Tsafrir points to a straight vertical seam in the enclosure's eastern masonry wall as evidence of different periods of construction. North of the seam is an early section of the wall built of large <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a> blocks. These blocks have faces with drafted margins around a prominent <a href="Boss%20%28architecture%29">boss</a> and are laid in homogeneous header and <a href="Stretcher%20bond">stretcher</a> courses, one above the other. This style of construction is Hellenistic and distinct from the Herodian construction apparent south of the seam. Although the exact dating of this construction in uncertain, Tsafrir believes it is a remnant of the Acra's foundations which were later incorporated into <a href="Herod%20the%20Great">Herod the Great</a>'s extension of the Temple platform. As further proof, Tzafrir also points to significant similarity between construction methods evident north of the seam, including the use of trapezoid-shaped stones, with the methods employed in the Seleucid city of <a href="Perga">Perga</a> in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>. 1 Macabees 1:30 attributes construction of the Acra to Apollonius, Antiochus III's "chief collector" (, "Sar Hamissim"), which appears to be an ancient mistranslation or his original title as chief (, "Sar") of the <a href="Mysians">Mysians</a>, a people of Asia Minor.

<a href="Meir%20Ben-Dov">Meir Ben-Dov</a> believed that the Acra stood just south of the <a href="Huldah%20Gates">Huldah Gates</a> of the southern wall of the Herodian Temple Mount platform. Benjamin Mazar's excavations of the <a href="Ophel">Ophel</a>, the area adjoining the southern portion of the platform, have unearthed the foundations of a massive structure and a large cistern, both possibly dating to the Hellenistic period. These have been tentatively identified as remnants of the Acra, with the structure, featuring rows of small interconnected rooms, believed to be the remains of a barracks. These had been demolished and built over during the Hasmonean period, matching the descriptions in Josephus. The Hasmonean constructions were, in turn, flattened to create a public square fronting the main gates to the Temple platform during the Herodian renovations.

Several cisterns under the Temple Mount itself have also been proposed as possible remnants of the Seleucid citadel. These include a cistern shaped like an E, the northern edge of which is adjacent to the proposed southern line of the Temple Mount precinct before its Herodian expansion. This has been identified as the "be'er haqar" or "bor heqer" mentioned in the <a href="Mishnah">Mishnah</a>, Erubin Tract 10.14, and commonly translated, perhaps incorrectly, as the "cold well".

Additional evidence for the existence of the Acra may come from the chance discovery, published by , of a fragmentary Greek inscription in the Old City of Jerusalem. The inscription is a fragment from the top of a sandstone stele and contains what may be an oath taken by soldiers stationed in the Acra, although the reading of the name "Acra" in the text has been contested.

In November 2015 the Israel Antiquities Authority announced the probable discovery of the Acra. According to archaeologists <a href="Doron%20Ben-Ami">Doron Ben-Ami</a>, Yana Tchekhanovets and Salome Cohen, excavating the <a href="Givati%20Parking%20Lot%20dig">Givati parking lot</a> adjacent to the City of David, they had unearthed a complex of rooms and fortified walls they identified as the Acra. This places it slightly south of previous suggested locations on the Ophel. Finds include fortification walls, a watchtower measuring 4 by 20 meters, and a <a href="glacis">glacis</a>. Bronze arrowheads, lead sling-stones and <a href="ballista">ballista</a> stones were unearthed at the site, stamped with a trident, the emblem of Antiochus IV Epiphanes. These are indicative of the military nature of the site and the efforts to take it. The excavation also yielded coins from the reigns of Antiochus IV through Antiochus VII, as well as a multitude of stamped Rhodian <a href="amphora">amphora</a> handles.

The Givati location has been questioned due to its being too low on the hill to overlook the Temple Mount, as described in literary sources.

Cyclol

The cyclol hypothesis is the first <a href="tertiary%20structure">structural model</a> of a <a href="protein%20folding">folded</a>, <a href="globular%20protein">globular</a> <a href="protein">protein</a>. It was developed by <a href="Dorothy%20Maud%20Wrinch">Dorothy Wrinch</a> in the late 1930s, and was based on three assumptions. Firstly, the hypothesis assumes that two <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide groups</a> can be crosslinked by a cyclol reaction (Figure 1); these crosslinks are "covalent" analogs of "non-covalent" <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s between peptide groups. These reactions have been observed in the <a href="ergoline">ergopeptides</a> and other compounds. Secondly, it assumes that, under some conditions, amino acids will naturally make the maximum possible number of cyclol crosslinks, resulting in cyclol molecules (Figure 2) and cyclol fabrics (Figure 3). These cyclol molecules and fabrics have never been observed. Finally, the hypothesis assumes that globular proteins have a <a href="tertiary%20structure">tertiary structure</a> corresponding to <a href="Platonic%20solid">Platonic solid</a>s and <a href="semiregular%20polyhedron">semiregular polyhedra</a> formed of cyclol fabrics with no free edges. Such "closed cyclol" molecules have not been observed either.

Although later data demonstrated that this original model for the <a href="protein%20structure">structure of globular proteins</a> needed to be amended, several elements of the cyclol model were verified, such as the cyclol reaction itself and the hypothesis that <a href="hydrophobic%20interaction">hydrophobic interaction</a>s are chiefly responsible for <a href="protein%20folding">protein folding</a>. The cyclol hypothesis stimulated many scientists to research questions in protein structure and chemistry, and was a precursor of the more accurate models hypothesized for the <a href="DNA">DNA double helix</a> and <a href="secondary%20structure">protein secondary structure</a>. The proposal and testing of the cyclol model also provides an excellent illustration of <a href="empirical">empirical</a> <a href="falsifiability">falsifiability</a> acting as part of the <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a>.

By the mid-1930s, <a href="analytical%20ultracentrifugation">analytical ultracentrifugation</a> studies by <a href="Theodor%20Svedberg">Theodor Svedberg</a> had shown that proteins had a well-defined chemical structure, and were not aggregations of small molecules. The same studies appeared to show that the molecular weight of proteins fell into a few well-defined classes related by integers, such as "M" = 23 <a href="atomic%20mass%20unit">Da</a>, where "p" and "q" are nonnegative integers. However, it was difficult to determine the exact molecular weight and number of amino acids in a protein. Svedberg had also shown that a change in solution conditions could cause a protein to disassemble into small subunits, now known as a change in <a href="quaternary%20structure">quaternary structure</a>.

The <a href="primary%20structure">chemical structure</a> of <a href="protein">protein</a>s was still under debate at that time. The most accepted (and ultimately correct) hypothesis was that proteins are linear <a href="polypeptide">polypeptide</a>s, i.e., unbranched <a href="polymer">polymer</a>s of <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s linked by <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide bond</a>s. However, a typical protein is remarkably long—hundreds of <a href="amino%20acid">amino-acid residues</a>—and several distinguished scientists were unsure whether such long, linear <a href="macromolecule">macromolecule</a>s could be stable in solution. Further doubts about the <a href="primary%20structure">polypeptide nature of proteins</a> arose because some <a href="enzymes">enzymes</a> were observed to cleave proteins but not peptides, whereas other <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s cleave peptides but not folded proteins. Attempts to synthesize proteins in the test tube were unsuccessful, mainly due to the <a href="Chirality%20%28chemistry%29">chirality</a> of amino acids; naturally occurring proteins are composed of only "left-handed" amino acids. Hence, alternative chemical models of proteins were considered, such as the diketopiperazine hypothesis of <a href="Emil%20Abderhalden">Emil Abderhalden</a>. However, no alternative model had yet explained why proteins yield only amino acids and peptides upon hydrolysis and proteolysis. As clarified by <a href="Kaj%20Ulrik%20Linderstrom-Lang">Linderstrøm-Lang</a>, these proteolysis data showed that <a href="denaturation%20%28biochemistry%29">denatured proteins</a> were polypeptides, but no data had yet been obtained about the structure of folded proteins; thus, denaturation could involve a chemical change that converted folded proteins into polypeptides.

The process of protein <a href="Denaturation%20%28biochemistry%29">denaturation</a> (as distinguished from <a href="coagulation">coagulation</a>) had been discovered in 1910 by <a href="Harriette%20Chick">Harriette Chick</a> and <a href="Charles%20James%20Martin%20%28scientist%29">Charles Martin</a>, but its nature was still mysterious. <a href="Mortimer%20Louis%20Anson">Tim Anson</a> and <a href="Alfred%20Mirsky">Alfred Mirsky</a> had shown that denaturation was a "reversible, two-state process" that results in many chemical groups becoming available for chemical reactions, including cleavage by enzymes. In 1929, <a href="Hsien%20Wu">Hsien Wu</a> hypothesized correctly that denaturation corresponded to protein unfolding, a purely conformational change that resulted in the exposure of amino-acid side chains to the solvent. Wu's hypothesis was also advanced independently in 1936 by Mirsky and <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a>. Nevertheless, protein scientists could not exclude the possibility that denaturation corresponded to a "chemical" change in the protein structure, a hypothesis that was considered a (distant) possibility until the 1950s.

<a href="X-ray%20crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a> had just begun as a discipline in 1911, and had advanced relatively rapidly from simple salt crystals to crystals of complex molecules such as <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a>. However, even the smallest proteins have over 1000 atoms, which makes determining their structure far more complex. In 1934, <a href="Dorothy%20Crowfoot%20Hodgkin">Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin</a> had taken crystallographic data on the structure of the small protein, <a href="insulin">insulin</a>, although the structure of that and other proteins were not solved until the late 1960s. However, pioneering <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> <a href="fiber%20diffraction">fiber diffraction</a> data had been collected in the early 1930s for many natural <a href="fibrous%20protein">fibrous protein</a>s such as wool and hair by <a href="William%20Astbury">William Astbury</a>, who proposed rudimentary models of <a href="secondary%20structure">secondary structure</a> elements such as the <a href="alpha%20helix">alpha helix</a> and the <a href="beta%20sheet">beta sheet</a>.

Since <a href="protein%20structure">protein structure</a> was so poorly understood in the 1930s, the physical interactions responsible for stabilizing that structure were likewise unknown. <a href="William%20Astbury">Astbury</a> hypothesized that the structure of <a href="fibrous%20protein">fibrous protein</a>s was stabilized by <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s in β-sheets. The idea that <a href="globular%20protein">globular protein</a>s are also stabilized by hydrogen bonds was proposed by <a href="Dorothy%20Jordan%20Lloyd">Dorothy Jordan Lloyd</a> in 1932, and championed later by <a href="Alfred%20Mirsky">Alfred Mirsky</a> and <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a>. At a 1933 lecture by Astbury to the Oxford Junior Scientific Society, physicist <a href="Frederick%20Charles%20Frank">Frederick Frank</a> suggested that the fibrous protein α-keratin might be stabilized by an alternative mechanism, namely, "covalent" crosslinking of the <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide bond</a>s by the cyclol reaction above. The cyclol crosslink draws the two peptide groups close together; the N and C atoms are separated by ~1.5 <a href="Angstrom">Å</a>, whereas they are separated by ~3 <a href="Angstrom">Å</a> in a typical <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>. The idea intrigued <a href="J.%20D.%20Bernal">J. D. Bernal</a>, who suggested it to the mathematician <a href="Dorothy%20Maud%20Wrinch">Dorothy Wrinch</a> as possibly useful in understanding protein structure.

<a href="Dorothy%20Maud%20Wrinch">Wrinch</a> developed this suggestion into a full-fledged model of <a href="protein%20structure">protein structure</a>. The basic cyclol model was laid out in her first paper (1936). She noted the possibility that <a href="polypeptide">polypeptide</a>s might cyclize to form closed rings (<a href="cyclic%20peptide">true</a>) and that these rings might form internal crosslinks through the cyclol reaction (also true, although rare). Assuming that the cyclol form of the <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide bond</a> could be more stable than the amide form, Wrinch concluded that certain cyclic <a href="peptide">peptide</a>s would naturally make the maximal number of cyclol bonds (such as cyclol 6, Figure 2). Such cyclol molecules would have hexagonal symmetry, if the <a href="chemical%20bond">chemical bond</a>s were taken as having the same length, roughly 1.5 <a href="Angstrom">Å</a>; for comparison, the N-C and C-C bonds have the lengths 1.42 Å and 1.54 Å, respectively.

These rings can be extended indefinitely to form a cyclol fabric (Figure 3). Such fabrics exhibit a long-range, quasi-crystalline order that Wrinch felt was likely in proteins, since they must pack hundreds of residues densely. Another interesting feature of such molecules and fabrics is that their <a href="amino%20acid">amino-acid</a> side chains point axially upwards from only one face; the opposite face has no side chains. Thus, one face is completely independent of the <a href="primary%20sequence">primary sequence</a> of the peptide, which Wrinch conjectured might account for sequence-independent properties of proteins.

In her initial article, Wrinch stated clearly that the cyclol model was merely a "working hypothesis", a potentially valid model of proteins that would have to be checked. Her goals in this article and its successors were to propose a well-defined testable model, to work out the consequences of its assumptions and to make predictions that could be tested experimentally. In these goals, she succeeded; however, within a few years, experiments and further modeling showed that the cyclol hypothesis was untenable as a model for globular proteins.

In two tandem Letters to the Editor (1936), Wrinch and Frank addressed the question of whether the cyclol form of the peptide group was indeed more stable than the amide form. A relatively simple calculation showed that the cyclol form is significantly "less" stable than the amide form. Therefore, the cyclol model would have to be abandoned unless a compensating source of energy could be identified. Initially, Frank proposed that the cyclol form might be stabilized by better interactions with the surrounding solvent; later, Wrinch and <a href="Irving%20Langmuir">Irving Langmuir</a> hypothesized that hydrophobic association of nonpolar sidechains provides stabilizing energy to overcome the energetic cost of the cyclol reactions.

The lability of the cyclol bond was seen as an "advantage" of the model, since it provided a natural explanation for the properties of <a href="Denaturation%20%28biochemistry%29">denaturation</a>; reversion of cyclol bonds to their more stable amide form would open up the structure and allows those bonds to be attacked by <a href="protease">protease</a>s, consistent with experiment. Early studies showed that proteins <a href="Denaturation%20%28biochemistry%29">denatured</a> by <a href="pressure">pressure</a> are often in a different state than the same proteins denatured by high <a href="temperature">temperature</a>, which was interpreted as possibly supporting the cyclol model of denaturation.

The Langmuir-Wrinch hypothesis of hydrophobic stabilization shared in the downfall of the cyclol model, owing mainly to the influence of <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a>, who favored the hypothesis that protein structure was stabilized by <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s. Another twenty years had to pass before hydrophobic interactions were recognized as the chief driving force in protein folding.

In her third paper on cyclols (1936), Wrinch noted that many "physiologically active" substances such as <a href="steroid">steroid</a>s are composed of fused hexagonal rings of carbon atoms and, thus, might be <a href="steric%20complementarity">sterically complementary</a> to the face of cyclol molecules without the <a href="amino%20acid">amino-acid</a> side chains. Wrinch proposed that steric complementarity was one of chief factors in determining whether a small molecule would bind to a protein.

Wrinch speculated that proteins are responsible for the synthesis of all biological molecules. Noting that cells digest their proteins only under extreme starvation conditions, Wrinch further speculated that life could not exist without proteins.

From the beginning, the cyclol reaction was considered as a covalent analog of the <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>. Therefore, it was natural to consider hybrid models with both types of bonds. This was the subject of Wrinch's fourth paper on the cyclol model (1936), written together with <a href="Dorothy%20Jordan%20Lloyd">Dorothy Jordan Lloyd</a>, who first proposed that globular proteins are stabilized by hydrogen bonds. A follow-up paper was written in 1937 that referenced other researchers on hydrogen bonding in proteins, such as <a href="Maurice%20Loyal%20Huggins">Maurice Loyal Huggins</a> and <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a>.

Wrinch also wrote a paper with <a href="William%20Astbury">William Astbury</a>, noting the possibility of a keto-enol isomerization of the >CH and an amide carbonyl group >C=O, producing a crosslink >C-C(OH)< and again converting the oxygen to a hydroxyl group. Such reactions could yield five-membered rings, whereas the classic cyclol hypothesis produces six-membered rings. This keto-enol crosslink hypothesis was not developed much further.

In her fifth paper on cyclols (1937), Wrinch identified the conditions under which two planar cyclol fabrics could be joined to make an angle between their planes while respecting the chemical bond angles. She identified a mathematical simplification, in which the non-planar six-membered rings of atoms can be represented by planar "median hexagon"s made from the midpoints of the chemical bonds. This "median hexagon" representation made it easy to see that the cyclol fabric planes can be joined correctly if the <a href="dihedral%20angle">dihedral angle</a> between the planes equals the tetrahedral bond angle δ = arccos(-1/3) ≈ 109.47°.

A large variety of closed polyhedra meeting this criterion can be constructed, of which the simplest are the <a href="truncated%20tetrahedron">truncated tetrahedron</a>, the <a href="truncated%20octahedron">truncated octahedron</a>, and the <a href="octahedron">octahedron</a>, which are <a href="Platonic%20solid">Platonic solid</a>s or <a href="semiregular%20polyhedron">semiregular polyhedra</a>. Considering the first series of "closed cyclols" (those modeled on the truncated tetrahedron), Wrinch showed that their number of amino acids <a href="quadratic%20growth">increased quadratically</a> as 72"n", where "n" is the index of the closed cyclol "C". Thus, the "C" cyclol has 72 residues, the "C" cyclol has 288 residues, etc. Preliminary experimental support for this prediction came from <a href="Max%20Bergmann">Max Bergmann</a> and <a href="Carl%20Niemann">Carl Niemann</a>, whose amino-acid analyses suggested that proteins were composed of integer multiples of 288 <a href="amino%20acid">amino-acid</a> residues ("n"=2). More generally, the cyclol model of globular proteins accounted for the early <a href="analytical%20ultracentrifugation">analytical ultracentrifugation</a> results of <a href="Theodor%20Svedberg">Theodor Svedberg</a>, which suggested that the <a href="molecular%20weight">molecular weight</a>s of proteins fell into a few classes related by integers.

The cyclol model was consistent with the general properties then attributed to folded proteins. (1) Centrifugation studies had shown that folded proteins were significantly denser than water (~1.4 <a href="gram">g</a>/<a href="liter">mL</a>) and, thus, tightly packed; Wrinch assumed that dense packing should imply "regular" packing. (2) Despite their large size, some proteins crystallize readily into symmetric crystals, consistent with the idea of symmetric faces that match up upon association. (3) Proteins bind metal ions; since metal-binding sites must have specific bond geometries (e.g., octahedral), it was plausible to assume that the entire protein also had similarly crystalline geometry. (4) As described above, the cyclol model provided a simple "chemical" explanation of <a href="Denaturation%20%28biochemistry%29">denaturation</a> and the difficulty of cleaving folded proteins with proteases. (5) Proteins were assumed to be responsible for the synthesis of all biological molecules, including other proteins. Wrinch noted that a fixed, uniform structure would be useful for proteins in templating their own synthesis, analogous to the <a href="James%20D.%20Watson">Watson</a>-<a href="Francis%20Crick">Francis Crick</a> concept of DNA templating its own replication. Given that many biological molecules such as <a href="carbohydrate">sugars</a> and <a href="sterol">sterol</a>s have a hexagonal structure, it was plausible to assume that their synthesizing proteins likewise had a hexagonal structure. Wrinch summarized her model and the supporting molecular-weight experimental data in three review articles.

Having proposed a model of globular proteins, Wrinch investigated whether it was consistent with the available structural data. She hypothesized that bovine tuberculin protein (523) was a "C" closed cyclol consisting of 72 residues and that the digestive <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> <a href="pepsin">pepsin</a> was a "C" closed cyclol of 288 residues. These residue-number predictions were difficult to verify, since the methods then available to measure the mass of proteins were inaccurate, such as <a href="analytical%20ultracentrifugation">analytical ultracentrifugation</a> and chemical methods.

Wrinch also predicted that <a href="insulin">insulin</a> was a "C" closed cyclol consisting of 288 residues. Limited X-ray crystallographic data were available for insulin which Wrinch interpreted as "confirming" her model. However, this interpretation drew rather severe criticism for being premature. Careful studies of the Patterson diagrams of insulin taken by <a href="Dorothy%20Crowfoot%20Hodgkin">Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin</a> showed that they were roughly consistent with the cyclol model; however, the agreement was not good enough to claim that the cyclol model was confirmed.

The cyclol fabric was shown to be implausible for several reasons. <a href="Hans%20Neurath">Hans Neurath</a> and Henry Bull showed that the dense packing of side chains in the cyclol fabric was inconsistent with the experimental density observed in protein films. <a href="Maurice%20Loyal%20Huggins">Maurice Huggins</a> calculated that several non-bonded atoms of the cyclol fabric would approach more closely than allowed by their <a href="van%20der%20Waals%20radius">van der Waals radii</a>; for example, the inner H and C atoms of the lacunae would be separated by only 1.68 <a href="Angstrom">Å</a> (Figure 5). Haurowitz showed chemically that the outside of proteins could not have a large number of hydroxyl groups, a key prediction of the cyclol model, whereas Meyer and Hohenemser showed that cyclol condensations of amino acids did not exist even in minute quantities as a transition state. More general chemical arguments against the cyclol model were given by Bergmann and Niemann and by <a href="Albert%20Neuberger">Neuberger</a>. Infrared spectroscopic data showed that the number of carbonyl groups in a protein did not change upon hydrolysis, and that intact, folded proteins have a full complement of amide carbonyl groups; both observations contradict the cyclol hypothesis that such carbonyls are converted to hydroxyl groups in folded proteins. Finally, proteins were known to contain <a href="proline">proline</a> in significant quantities (typically 5%); since proline lacks the amide hydrogen and its nitrogen already forms three covalent bonds, proline seems incapable of the cyclol reaction and of being incorporated into a cyclol fabric. An encyclopedic summary of the chemical and structural evidence against the cyclol model was given by Pauling and Niemann. Moreover, a supporting piece of evidence—the result that all proteins contain an integer multiple of 288 <a href="amino%20acid">amino-acid</a> residues—was likewise shown to be incorrect in 1939.

Wrinch replied to the steric-clash, free-energy, chemical and residue-number criticisms of the cyclol model. On steric clashes, she noted that small deformations of the bond angles and bond lengths would allow these steric clashes to be relieved, or at least reduced to a reasonable level. She noted that distances between non-bonded groups within a single molecule can be shorter than expected from their <a href="van%20der%20Waals%20radius">van der Waals radii</a>, e.g., the 2.93 <a href="Angstrom">Å</a> distance between methyl groups in hexamethylbenzene. Regarding the free-energy penalty for the cyclol reaction, Wrinch disagreed with Pauling's calculations and stated that too little was known of intramolecular energies to rule out the cyclol model on that basis alone. In reply to the chemical criticisms, Wrinch suggested that the model compounds and simple bimolecular reactions studied need not pertain to the cyclol model, and that steric hindrance may have prevented the surface hydroxyl groups from reacting. On the residue-number criticism, Wrinch extended her model to allow for other numbers of residues. In particular, she produced a "minimal" closed cyclol of only 48 residues, and, on that (incorrect) basis, may have been the first to suggest that the <a href="insulin">insulin</a> monomer had a molecular weight of roughly 6000 <a href="atomic%20mass%20unit">Da</a>.

Therefore, she maintained that the cyclol model of globular proteins was still potentially viable and even proposed the cyclol fabric as a component of the <a href="cytoskeleton">cytoskeleton</a>. However, most protein scientists ceased to believe in it and Wrinch turned her scientific attention to mathematical problems in <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a>, to which she contributed significantly. One exception was physicist <a href="Gladys%20Anslow">Gladys Anslow</a>, Wrinch's colleague at <a href="Smith%20College">Smith College</a>, who studied the <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> <a href="absorption%20%28electromagnetic%20radiation%29">absorption</a> spectra of proteins and peptides in the 1940s and allowed for the possibility of cyclols in interpreting her results. As the <a href="primary%20structure">sequence</a> of insulin began to be determined by <a href="Frederick%20Sanger">Frederick Sanger</a>, Anslow published a three-dimensional cyclol model with sidechains, based on the backbone of Wrinch's 1948 "minimal cyclol" model.

The downfall of the overall cyclol model generally led to a rejection of its elements; one notable exception was <a href="J.%20D.%20Bernal">J. D. Bernal</a>'s short-lived acceptance of the Langmuir-Wrinch hypothesis that <a href="protein%20folding">protein folding</a> is driven by hydrophobic association. Nevertheless, cyclol bonds were identified in small, naturally occurring <a href="cyclic%20peptide">cyclic peptide</a>s in the 1950s.

Clarification of the modern terminology is appropriate. The classic cyclol reaction is the addition of the NH amine of a <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide group</a> to the C=O carbonyl group of another; the resulting compound is now called an azacyclol. By analogy, an oxacyclol is formed when an OH hydroxyl group is added to a peptidyl carbonyl group. Likewise, a thiacyclol is formed by adding an SH thiol moiety to a peptidyl carbonyl group.

The oxacyclol <a href="alkaloid">alkaloid</a> <a href="ergotamine">ergotamine</a> from the <a href="fungus">fungus</a> "Claviceps purpurea" was the first identified cyclol. The cyclic depsipeptide serratamolide is also formed by an oxacyclol reaction. Chemically analogous cyclic thiacyclols have also been obtained. Classic azacyclols have been observed in small molecules and tripeptides. Peptides are naturally produced from the reversion of azacylols, a key prediction of the cyclol model. Hundreds of cyclol molecules have now been identified, despite <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a>'s calculation that such molecules should not exist because of their unfavorably high <a href="energy">energy</a>.

After a long hiatus during which she worked mainly on the mathematics of <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a>, Wrinch responded to these discoveries with renewed enthusiasm for the cyclol model and its relevance in biochemistry. She also published two books describing the cyclol theory and small peptides in general.

The cyclol model of protein structure is an example of <a href="empirical">empirical</a> <a href="falsifiability">falsifiability</a> acting as part of the <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a>. An original <a href="hypothesis">hypothesis</a> is made that accounts for unexplained experimental observations; the consequences of this hypothesis are worked out, leading to predictions that are tested by experiment. In this case, the key hypothesis was that the cyclol form of the peptide group could be favored over the amide form. This hypothesis led to the predictions of the cyclol-6 molecule and the cyclol fabric, which in turn suggested the model of semi-regular polyhedra for globular proteins. A key testable prediction was that a folded protein's carbonyl groups should be largely converted to hydroxyl groups; however, spectroscopic and chemical experiments showed that this prediction was incorrect. The cyclol model also predicts a high lateral density of amino acids in folded proteins and in films that does not agree with experiment. Hence, the cyclol model could be rejected and the search begun for new hypotheses of <a href="protein%20structure">protein structure</a>, such as the models of the <a href="alpha%20helix">alpha helix</a> proposed in the 1940s and 1950s.

It is sometimes argued that the cyclol hypothesis should never have been advanced, because of its "a priori" flaws, e.g., its steric clashes, its inability to accommodate <a href="proline">proline</a>, and the high <a href="Thermodynamic%20free%20energy">free energy</a> disfavoring the cyclol reaction itself. Although such flaws rendered the cyclol hypothesis "implausible", they did not make it "impossible". The cyclol model was the first well-defined structure proposed for globular proteins, and too little was then known of intramolecular forces and protein structure to reject it immediately. It neatly explained several general properties of proteins and accounted for then-anomalous experimental observations. Although generally incorrect, some elements of the cyclol theory were eventually verified, such as the cyclol reactions and the role of <a href="hydrophobe">hydrophobic interactions</a> in <a href="protein%20folding">protein folding</a>. A useful comparison is the <a href="Bohr%20model">Bohr model</a> of the <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> <a href="atom">atom</a>, which was considered implausible from its inception, even by its creator, yet led the way to the ultimately correct theory of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. Similarly, <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a> proposed a well-defined model of <a href="DNA">DNA</a> that was likewise implausible yet thought-provoking to other investigators.

Conversely, the cyclol model is an example of an incorrect scientific theory of great <a href="symmetry">symmetry</a> and <a href="beauty">beauty</a>, two qualities that can be regarded as signs of "obviously true" scientific theories. For example, the <a href="James%20D.%20Watson">Watson</a>-<a href="Francis%20Crick">Crick</a> <a href="double%20helix">double helix</a> model of <a href="DNA">DNA</a> is sometimes said to be "obvious" because of its plausible <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>ing and symmetry; nevertheless, other, less symmetrical structures of DNA are favored under different conditions. Similarly, the beautiful theory of <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a> was considered by <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> as not needing experimental verification; yet even this theory will require revision for consistency with <a href="quantum%20field%20theory">quantum field theory</a>.

Three-dollar piece

The three-dollar piece was a gold coin produced by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> from 1854 to 1889. Authorized by the Act of February 21, 1853, the coin was designed by Mint Chief Engraver <a href="James%20B.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BLongacre">James B. Longacre</a>. The <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> bears a representation of <a href="Liberty%20%28goddess%29">Lady Liberty</a> wearing a headdress of a <a href="Indian%20princess">Native American princess</a> and the reverse a wreath of <a href="maize">corn</a>, <a href="wheat">wheat</a>, <a href="cotton">cotton</a>, and <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a>.

In 1851, Congress had authorized a silver <a href="three-cent%20piece">three-cent piece</a> so that postage stamps of that value could be purchased without using the widely disliked <a href="Large%20cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">copper cents</a>. Two years later, a bill was passed which authorized a three-dollar coin. By some accounts, the coin was created so larger quantities of stamps could be purchased. Longacre, in designing the piece, sought to make it as different as possible from the <a href="quarter%20eagle">quarter eagle</a> or $2.50 piece, striking it on a thinner <a href="planchet">planchet</a> and using a distinctive design.

Although over 100,000 were struck in the first year, the coin saw little use. It circulated somewhat on the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a>, where gold and silver were used to the exclusion of paper money, but what little place it had in commerce in the <a href="Eastern%20United%20States">East</a> was lost in the economic disruption of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, and was never regained. The piece was last struck in 1889, and Congress ended the series the following year. Although many dates were struck in small numbers, the rarest was produced at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a> in 1870 (1870-S); only one is known with certainty to exist.

In 1832, New York Congressman <a href="Campbell%20P.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BWhite">Campbell P. White</a> sought a means of returning American gold coins to circulation—as gold was overvalued with respect to silver by the government, gold coins had been routinely exported since the start of the 19th century. White's solution was to have the <a href="Dollar%20coin%20%28United%20States%29">silver dollar</a> and gold <a href="eagle%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">eagle</a> struck at full value, but to have smaller gold and silver coins, including a $3 piece, which contained less than their face value in metal. Although Congress, in passing the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201834">Coinage Act of 1834</a>, made adjustments to the ratio between gold and silver, it did not authorize a $3 coin at that time.

The Act of March 3, 1845 authorized the first United States postage stamps and set the rate for local prepaid letters at five cents. In the years following, this rate was seen as too high and an impediment to commerce. Accordingly, Congress on March 3, 1851 authorized both a three-cent stamp and a <a href="three-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">three-cent silver coin</a>. Kentucky Representative <a href="Richard%20Henry%20Stanton">Richard Henry Stanton</a> believed that the need to make change from a silver <a href="half%20dime">half dime</a> with large copper <a href="large%20cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">cents</a> might defeat the new scheme, writing to <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Mint Director</a> <a href="Robert%20Maskell%20Patterson">Robert M. Patterson</a> that "reduced postage [rates] depended on a three-cent coin for use in those states where copper does not circulate." According to numismatic historian <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, "the main purpose of the new 3¢ piece would be to buy postage stamps without using the unpopular, heavy, and often filthy copper cents.

By 1853, silver was overvalued with respect to gold. This was due to large discoveries of gold, especially in California, and silver was heavily exported. To correct this situation, Secretary of the Treasury <a href="Thomas%20Corwin">Thomas Corwin</a> advocated reducing the precious-metal content of most silver coins to prevent their export. The opposition to the bill was led by Tennessee Representative <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, who believed that Congress had no authority to alter the gold/silver price ratio and, if it did, it should not exercise it. Nevertheless, Congress passed the bill, which became law on February 21, 1853. That bill also authorized a three-dollar gold coin; according to numismatic writer <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a>, provision for it had been inserted at the behest of gold interests.

According to Breen, Congress believed the new coin "would be convenient for exchange for rolls or small bags of silver 3¢ pieces, and for buying sheets of 3¢ stamps—always bypassing use of copper cents". In 1889, then-Mint Director <a href="James%20P.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BKimball">James P. Kimball</a> wrote that "it is supposed that the three-dollar piece was designed to be a multiple of the three-cent piece, for the convenience of postal transactions". Numismatist Walter Hagans in his 2003 article on the three-dollar coin notes and dismisses the postal explanation, writing "the actual reason for the gold $3 coin was the abundant supply of gold discovered in California." Coin dealer and author <a href="Q.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BDavid%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> notes that "whether or not the $3 denomination was actually necessary or worthwhile has been a matter of debate among numismatists for well over a century."

Much of what is known of the design process for the three-dollar piece is from an August 21, 1858, letter from the Mint's chief engraver, <a href="James%20B.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BLongacre">James B. Longacre</a>, the coin's designer, to the then-Mint director, <a href="James%20Ross%20Snowden">James Ross Snowden</a>. This letter is apparently in response to some criticism, and in it, Longacre discussed his views on coin design, especially regarding the three-dollar piece. He noted that he was initially perplexed as to what to put on the coin; the three-dollar piece was the first time he had been allowed to choose a design. Although he had designed the three-cent piece and other issues before Snowden's directorship, he had been told what to put on those pieces. The coin weighed 64.5 grams, and had a <a href="fineness">fineness</a> of 900.

Longacre noted that although those in charge of coinage design had usually dictated adaptations of Roman or Greek art, for the three-dollar coin, he was minded to create something truly American:

Representations of America as a female Native American, or <a href="Gender%20roles%20among%20the%20indigenous%20peoples%20of%20North%20America">Indian princess</a>, dated back to the 16th century; cartographers would place a native woman, often wearing a feathered headdress, upon their version of the North American continent. This evolved into an image of an Indian queen, then an Indian princess, and although <a href="Columbia%20%28name%29">Columbia</a> eventually came to be the favored female embodiment of the United States, the image of the Indian princess survives in the popular view of such figures as <a href="Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a> and <a href="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</a>.

Some sources suggest that Longacre may have based the features of Liberty on those of his daughter, Sarah. This story would be more often associated with Longacre's <a href="Indian%20Head%20cent">Indian Head cent</a>, but the features of Liberty on both coins (and also the Type I gold dollar, the double eagle, and the three-cent nickel piece) are nearly identical. To help distinguish the new coin from the quarter eagle or $2.50 piece, Longacre used a thinner <a href="planchet">planchet</a>, or blank, to make the piece greater in diameter. He also flattened the planchet of the <a href="gold%20dollar">gold dollar</a> to enlarge it, and gave it the same Indian princess design. The reverse originates Longacre's "agricultural wreath" of corn, tobacco, cotton, and wheat which would also appear on the gold dollar, <a href="Flying%20Eagle%20cent">Flying Eagle cent</a>, and his revised reverse for the <a href="United%20States%20Seated%20Liberty%20coinage">Seated Liberty</a> dime and half dime. This blended the produce of the South and North at a time of intersectional tension. Numismatist Walter Hagans deems the wreathed reverse "as uniquely American as is the Indian maiden on the obverse."

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> stated that "the one area in which Longacre gave free rein to his imagination was in the matter of fancy headdress for his renderings of Liberty. His caps of feathers, his bonnets of freedom, and his starry diadems are a joy to behold." Nevertheless, Vermeule disliked the figure on the obverse, "the princess of the gold coins is a banknote engraver's elegant version of folk art of the 1850s. The plumes or feathers are more like the crest of the Prince of Wales than anything that saw the Western frontier, save perhaps on a music hall beauty."

At the time of the authorization of the three-dollar piece, the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a> administration of <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a> was still in office, but two weeks later, Fillmore was succeeded by <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a>, and Mint Director <a href="George%20N.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BEckert">George N. Eckert</a> yielded his place to <a href="Thomas%20M.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BPettit">Thomas M. Pettit</a>. Longacre submitted two designs to Pettit, and before the latter died on May 31, 1853, he selected one of the two; relief models quickly followed the approval. Longacre's models, both for the obverse and reverse, did not have lettering on them, as the legends and numbers were to be punched once a reduction was made. This allowed them to be used multiple times for different denominations. As Longacre was busy with the reduced-weight silver coins ordered by Congress in the same act that had authorized the three-dollar piece, work on dies did not begin until 1854.

The first three-dollar pieces were 15 <a href="Proof%20coinage">proof coins</a>, delivered to the Secretary of the Treasury, <a href="James%20Guthrie%20%28Kentucky%29">James Guthrie</a>, by Mint Director Snowden on April 28, 1854, most likely for distribution to legislators. The Philadelphia Mint then began the largest production of three-dollar pieces the denomination would ever see. Chief Coiner <a href="Franklin%20Peale">Franklin Peale</a> delivered 23,140 pieces on May 8 and 29,181 pieces four days later. However, after June 8, there was only one further delivery by Peale, on November 10, when the last 22,740 of the mintage of 138,618 were delivered. In addition to the strikings at Philadelphia, there was branch mint production, with 24,000 pieces struck at the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Mint">New Orleans Mint</a> (1854-O) and 1,120 at <a href="Dahlonega%20Mint">Dahlonega</a> (1854-D). A pair of dies was sent from Philadelphia to the <a href="Charlotte%20Mint">Charlotte Mint</a> on June 1, but they were not used. A pair was sent to Dahlonega the same day, arriving on June 10, with gauges and other necessary equipment following on July 15. The coinage of the 1854-D took place in August; the piece is today a rarity as few were put aside and it was not until decades later that mintmarked coins were saved as distinct varieties. Dies were sent to New Orleans in 1855, 1856, 1859, and 1861, only to remain unused; no further strikings took place at any of the three southern branch mints.
Beginning in 1855, the letters of the word "Dollars" were enlarged, following complaints from the public. The same year, coinage began at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a>, where 6,600 were struck as opposed to 50,555 at Philadelphia. Mintages at Philadelphia declined for the remainder of the decade, to 7,036 by 1860; pieces were also struck at San Francisco in 1856, 1857, and 1860. In 1859, early numismatic writer <a href="Montroville%20W.%20Dickeson">Montroville W. Dickeson</a> wrote of the three-dollar piece, "it is very unpopular, being frequently mistaken for a quarter eagle, and often counted as a five-dollar piece. It is exceedingly annoying to that portion of the human family whose vision is dependent on artificial aid, and we think its retirement would meet with public approbation." Perhaps a dozen contemporary numismatists collected three-dollar pieces; those who were serious ordered proof coins from the Mint. Coins in this condition became easier to obtain from Philadelphia as officials responded to the rise in interest in coin collecting which followed the introduction of the <a href="Flying%20Eagle%20cent">Flying Eagle cent</a> in 1857.

The coins saw some circulation in the <a href="Eastern%20United%20States">East</a> and <a href="Midwest%20United%20States">Midwest</a>, at least until 1861, when the economic turmoil caused by the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> caused gold and silver to vanish from commerce there. With gold being hoarded, in December 1861, banks, and subsequently the Treasury, ceased to pay out gold at face value. The three-dollar piece would never return to circulation in the eastern part of the country. On the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a>, where gold and silver remained in use, the coin continued in commerce, and might be occasionally encountered. The San Francisco Mint issues were most commonly seen there. Despite the failure to circulate, three-dollar pieces continued to be struck at Philadelphia as it was the policy of Mint Director <a href="James%20Pollock">James Pollock</a> that each denomination should be struck every year, whether it circulated or not. Some Philadelphia Mint pieces migrated west in payment for transactions, as only gold and silver was acceptable money on the West Coast. Until the <a href="Specie%20Payment%20Resumption%20Act">resumption of specie payments</a> at the end of 1878, gold pieces were only available from the Philadelphia Mint by paying a premium in banknotes. Pieces not sold were stored there.
In 1870, a set of dies for the three-dollar piece was sent from the Bureau of the Mint's Engraving Department at the Philadelphia Mint to San Francisco. On May 14, 1870, <a href="Oscar%20Hugh%20La%20Grange">Oscar Hugh La Grange</a>, superintendent of the San Francisco Mint, sent a telegram to Mint Director Pollock, informing him that dies for the one- and three-dollar pieces had been received, but lacked the customary "S" mint mark, and asking for guidance. The dies were, per Pollock's instructions, returned to Philadelphia, but LaGrange informed Pollock that to secure a three-dollar piece to place in the cornerstone of the new San Francisco Mint building, Coiner J.B. Harmistead had engraved an "S" on the reverse die. It is not certain what became of the piece to be placed in the cornerstone, but Harmistead also struck a piece for himself, which was mounted as jewelry at one time, and the existence of which was not known until 1907. The only unique regular-issue U.S. gold piece by date and mint mark, it last came on the market in 1982, when it sold for $687,500. Today it forms part of the Harry W. Bass, Jr. Collection in the Money Museum of the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a> in <a href="Colorado%20Springs%2C%20Colorado">Colorado Springs</a>. No other three-dollar pieces were struck at San Francisco in 1870; dies were sent there most years between 1861 and 1873, but, with the exception of 1870, were not used.

On January 18, 1873, Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner <a href="Archibald%20Loudon%20Snowden">Archibald Loudon Snowden</a> complained that the "3" in the date, as struck by the Mint, too closely resembled an "8", especially on the smaller-sized denominations. In response, Pollock ordered Chief Engraver <a href="William%20Barber%20%28engraver%29">William Barber</a> to re-engrave the date, opening the arms of the "3" wider on most denominations, including the three-dollar piece. Both the Closed 3 and Open 3 varieties are extremely rare, though the official mintage of 25 pieces for 1873 is understated, since more specimens than that are known to exist. In 1875 and 1876, no pieces were struck for circulation, with only pieces in proof condition being made available to collectors. The official mintage is 20 for 1875 and 45 for 1876, though an unknown number of pieces may have been later illicitly restruck for each date. Numismatic writer R.W. Julian believes that there were no later restrikes, but as proof pieces were not counted until sold, employees substituted common-date pieces when unsold coins were to be melted. These pieces had been made available to the public only as part of a proof set of all gold denominations, at a price of $43 (a premium of $1.50 over face value). Julian suggests that the relatively large mintages of almost 42,000 in 1874 and some 82,000 in 1878 were struck in anticipation of the resumption of specie payments, but when this finally occurred at the end of 1878, "there was a loud yawn from the public and the Mint kept most of the pieces on hand, paying them out slowly as stocking stuffers.

In the 1880s, despite the return of gold to commerce nationwide with the resumption of specie payments at the end of 1878, few three-dollar pieces were coined. There was a small speculative boom by the public in putting aside three-dollar pieces; nevertheless, thousands remained at the Philadelphia Mint. Few were sent to banks; the coins sold for a small premium when banks had some or when they were purchased from exchange brokers. The coins' main use was as gifts, or in jewelry. The pieces were struck only at Philadelphia after the 1870-S rarity, and early numismatist S.H. Chapman noted of the 1879 through 1889 issues, "of the later years of the $3, large numbers were remelted at the Philadelphia Mint." The Mint apparently favored certain Philadelphia dealers in the distribution of the gold dollar, but the three-dollar piece could be obtained without a premium at the cashier's window of the Philadelphia Mint. Large numbers of the 1879 three-dollar piece (mintage 3,000 for circulation), 1880 (1,000), and 1881 (500) were hoarded by early coin collector and dealer Thomas L. Elder, who asked bank tellers to look out for them. Elder could not have obtained them directly from the Mint at the time of issue as he was still a child in 1880, and did not begin collecting coins until 1887.
With the rise of collecting interest in the three-dollar piece in the 1880s, unscrupulous employees at the Philadelphia Mint enriched themselves by illicit striking of earlier-date pieces, including the 1873, 1875, and 1876. Bowers, in his <a href="%3Awikt%3Asylloge">sylloge</a> of the Bass Collection, particularly blames these irregularities on <a href="Oliver%20Bosbyshell">Oliver Bosbyshell</a>, chief coiner at Philadelphia from 1876 to 1885. During that period, quantities of pattern coins, restrikes, and pieces struck in different metals flowed to well-connected collectors and dealers, and Bosbyshell sold a large personal collection of such pieces shortly after leaving office as chief coiner. Although Bosbyshell returned as Philadelphia Mint superintendent from 1889 to 1894, he does not appear to have resumed his illicit activities.

The relatively large mintage of about 6,000 in 1887 was due to a fad sweeping the country whereby men would present their lady friends with a coin with one side ground off and replaced by the woman's initials. Many wealthy suitors preferred to use a gold coin for this presentation. A larger-than-usual number of proof pieces were struck in 1888 and held by the Mint in anticipation of future trades with collectors for items which the Mint desired for <a href="National%20Numismatic%20Collection">its coin collection</a>. The 1888 piece is the most common proof coin in the series, with an official mintage of 200 pieces.

In 1889, Mint Director <a href="James%20P.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BKimball">James P. Kimball</a> sent a letter to the House of Representatives Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures urging the abolition of the three-dollar piece. Kimball wrote, "this is a denomination which serves no useful purpose, its present coinage being in fact limited to its production for cabinet [coin collecting] purposes. The value of over $153,000 in three-dollar pieces still on hand at the Mint at Philadelphia can not be disposed of, owing to the unpopularity of this coin as a circulating medium." The gold dollar and three-dollar piece were not coined after 1889, and were abolished by Congress on September 26, 1890.

In the 1890s, 49,087 three-dollar pieces were melted as obsolete at the Philadelphia Mint. Although no list was kept by years, Bowers suggests that many of the pieces were dated 1874 or 1878 (both years with relatively high mintages), or were from the final years of the series. In the 1890s, they typically commanded a premium of 25 or 50 cents at exchange brokers. In the 1920s, three-dollar pieces sold at a premium when other denominations of gold coinage remained at face value. The 2014 edition of <a href="R.S.%20Yeoman">R.S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" lists the 1854 as the cheapest three-dollar piece in the lowest listed condition (<a href="Coin%20grading">Very Fine or MS-20</a>) at $825. An 1855-S in proof is the record holder in sales price for the denomination, selling at auction in 2011 for $1,322,500.

In 1934, Mint Director <a href="Nellie%20Tayloe%20Ross">Nellie Tayloe Ross</a> wrote in her annual report that a total of 539,792 three-dollar pieces had been coined, of which 452,572 were struck at Philadelphia, 62,350 at San Francisco (not including the 1870-S), 24,000 at New Orleans, and 1,120 at Dahlonega. According to Breen, three-dollar pieces "represent relics of an interesting but abortive experiment; today they are among the most highly coveted of American gold coins". New York coin dealer Norman Stack stated in the 1950s, "All are rare. There is no such thing as a "common" three-dollar gold piece."

Richie Farmer

Richard Dwight "Richie" Farmer (born August 25, 1969) is an American former collegiate basketball player and <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> politician from the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. He served as the Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner from 2004 to 2012 and was the running mate of <a href="David%20L.%20Williams%20%28politician%29">David L. Williams</a> in the <a href="Kentucky%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%202011">2011 gubernatorial election</a>. After leaving office, Farmer was investigated for violating state campaign finance laws and misappropriating state resources and was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison along with a concurrent 12 months in state prison.

A <a href="point%20guard">point guard</a>, Farmer led <a href="Clay%20County%20High%20School">Clay County High School</a> to the 1987 <a href="Sweet%20Sixteen%20%28KHSAA%20State%20Basketball%20Championship%29">Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA) State Basketball Championship</a> and, in 1988, was named <a href="Kentucky%20Mr.%20Basketball">Kentucky Mr. Basketball</a> and Kentucky Associated Press Male High School Athlete of the Year after setting a championship game record with 51 points in a losing effort. Although he was popular state-wide and publicly stated his desire to play collegiate basketball for the <a href="Kentucky%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball">Kentucky Wildcats</a>, Coach <a href="Eddie%20Sutton">Eddie Sutton</a> was reluctant to offer Farmer a scholarship. After Farmer announced that he would visit other colleges and issued a deadline past which he would no longer consider Kentucky without a scholarship offer, Sutton relented and Farmer joined the <a href="University%20of%20Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a>.

Kentucky struggled during Farmer's freshman year, finishing with a 13–19 record, and by mid-season, fans were accusing Sutton of unfairly favoring his son, <a href="Sean%20Sutton">Sean</a>, over Farmer at the point guard position. Sutton resigned in the offseason due to a pay-for-play scandal for which the <a href="NCAA">NCAA</a> banned Kentucky from postseason play for two years. Sutton's replacement, <a href="Rick%20Pitino">Rick Pitino</a>, instituted a rigorous conditioning program and fast-paced style of play that improved Farmer's performance. After spending his junior season as a backup to <a href="Sean%20Woods">Sean Woods</a>, Farmer transitioned to <a href="shooting%20guard">shooting guard</a> and became a starter in the middle of his senior year. Again eligible for postseason competition, the Wildcats won the <a href="Southeastern%20Conference">Southeastern Conference</a> tournament and reached the Regional Finals of the <a href="1992%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1992 NCAA Tournament</a>, losing in overtime on a last-second shot by <a href="Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball">Duke</a>'s <a href="Christian%20Laettner">Christian Laettner</a> in <a href="The%20Shot%20%28Duke%E2%80%93Kentucky%29">a game</a> regarded by many as the greatest college basketball game ever played. The team's seniors – Farmer, Woods, <a href="John%20Pelphrey">John Pelphrey</a>, and <a href="Deron%20Feldhaus">Deron Feldhaus</a> – were dubbed "The Unforgettables", and their jerseys were hung from the rafters of <a href="Rupp%20Arena">Rupp Arena</a> following the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Kentucky%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1991–92 season</a>.

Farmer parlayed his status as a basketball icon into two terms as Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner from 2004 to 2012, winning both elections by large margins. In 2011, <a href="President%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20Senate">Kentucky Senate President</a> David L. Williams tapped Farmer – considered a rising star in the state Republican Party – as his running mate in the gubernatorial election. They were defeated by Democratic Governor <a href="Steve%20Beshear">Steve Beshear</a> and his running mate <a href="Jerry%20Abramson">Jerry Abramson</a>. During the campaign, media reports alleged that Farmer had misused state funds and property as agriculture commissioner and Farmer's successor collaborated with the state auditor to investigate the allegations. As a result, the Executive Branch Ethics Commission charged Farmer with 42 ethics violations – the most against an individual in state history. <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Kentucky">Attorney General</a> <a href="Jack%20Conway%20%28politician%29">Jack Conway</a> also charged Farmer with violating state <a href="Campaign%20finance%20in%20the%20United%20States">campaign finance laws</a>, and a federal <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> followed with five <a href="indictment">indictment</a>s for abuses of power. Farmer initially contested the charges, but later agreed to a <a href="plea%20bargain">plea bargain</a>. On January 14, 2014, Farmer was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison and ordered to pay $120,500 in <a href="restitution">restitution</a> and $65,000 in fines. He served almost 20 months in a satellite camp of the <a href="United%20States%20Penitentiary%2C%20Hazelton">United States Penitentiary, Hazelton</a> near <a href="Bruceton%20Mills%2C%20West%20Virginia">Bruceton Mills, West Virginia</a>, before transitioning to a <a href="halfway%20house">halfway house</a> in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>, on December 18, 2015. He was released from the halfway house on January 21, 2016 and is currently residing in Clay County.

Richard Dwight ("Richie") Farmer, Jr. was born on August 25, 1969, in <a href="Corbin%2C%20Kentucky">Corbin, Kentucky</a>, but grew up in the <a href="eastern%20Kentucky">eastern Kentucky</a> town of <a href="Manchester%2C%20Kentucky">Manchester</a>. He was the second of three children born to Richard and Virginia Farmer. Because of his physical maturity – he reportedly began shaving at age 12 and had begun wearing his trademark mustache by his <a href="Eleventh%20grade">junior year</a> in high school – Farmer was frequently questioned about his age. The left-hander's <a href="vertical%20leap">vertical leap</a> measured in high school. He credited his father, a transportation manager at a local coal mine and a standout <a href="point%20guard">point guard</a> at <a href="Clay%20County%20High%20School">Clay County High School</a> in 1963, with developing his basketball acumen.

As an <a href="eighth%20grade">eighth grade</a>r, Farmer played basketball for his grade school basketball team, as well as the freshman, junior varsity, and varsity teams at Clay County High School. He played sparingly during the varsity team's regular season but received 68 seconds of playing time – scoring 2 points – during the Tigers' victory over <a href="Owensboro%20High%20School">Owensboro High School</a> in the 1984 <a href="Sweet%20Sixteen%20%28KHSAA%20State%20Basketball%20Championship%29">Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA) State Basketball Championship</a>. He also played <a href="American%20football">football</a> on a team that won the county championship that year. He eventually stopped playing football, but continued to play <a href="baseball">baseball</a> – as a <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> and <a href="first%20baseman">first baseman</a> – in addition to basketball until his senior year of high school.

As a freshman, Farmer led his team in scoring during the regular season, averaging 16.4 points per game from the <a href="shooting%20guard">shooting guard</a> position. He also led the Tigers in scoring in each of their three games "en route" to the 13th Region <a href="Kentucky%20High%20School%20Athletic%20Association">Kentucky High School Athletic Association</a> basketball championship. In the opening round of the 1985 KHSAA state tournament, Farmer scored 14 points on 6 of 16 shooting in a win over <a href="Boone%20County%20High%20School">Boone County High School</a>. Then, in back-to-back victories against <a href="Metcalfe%20County%20High%20School">Metcalfe County High School</a> and <a href="Doss%20High%20School">Doss High School</a>, he led his team with 21 and 20 points, respectively, to help Clay County reach the tournament finals. Farmer scored 10 points in Clay County's 65–64 loss to <a href="Hopkinsville%20High%20School">Hopkinsville High School</a> in the championship game. He was the tournament's second-highest scorer with 69 points, one behind Hopkinsville's Lamont Ware, and finished second in the voting for the tournament's Most Valuable Player, which went to Hopkinsville's Wendell Quarles. Only <a href="Apollo%20High%20School%20%28Kentucky%29">Apollo High School</a>'s <a href="Rex%20Chapman">Rex Chapman</a> received more votes for the all-tournament team.

Clay County ranked only behind Owensboro and <a href="Scott%20County%20High%20School">Scott County High School</a> in the "<a href="Lexington%20Herald-Leader">Lexington Herald-Leader</a>"'s 1985–86 preseason coaches poll. During Clay County's 22–6 regular season, Farmer, who moved to the point guard position, averaged 18.6 points, 10 assists, and 8 rebounds per game. The Tigers won the 13th District Title, setting up a matchup with <a href="Pulaski%20County%20High%20School%20%28Kentucky%29">Pulaski County High School</a> in the first round of the KSHAA state tournament. Farmer had scored 30 points in Clay County's regular season matchup with Pulaski County, but his team lost by one point in overtime. In the tournament rematch, Pulaski County held Farmer to 20 points and won 83–78; Coach Dave Fraley credited a defense centered on stopping Farmer for his team's victory.

In the "Lexington Herald-Leader"'s 1986–87 preseason coaches' poll, Clay County was ranked 14th in the state, and Farmer was named one of the state's best 25 players. Farmer led his team in scoring at 23.9 points per game, and Clay County finished the regular season with a record of 28–2 and again won the 13th Region tournament. Farmer scored 19 points and grabbed 5 rebounds in his team's 90–80 victory over <a href="Highlands%20High%20School%20%28Fort%20Thomas%2C%20Kentucky%29">Highlands High School</a> in the KHSAA state tournament's opening round, but his performance was overshadowed by teammate Russell Chadwell's 43 points. In the quarterfinals, Farmer led the Tigers with 19 points, defeating <a href="LaRue%20County%20High%20School">LaRue County High School</a> 62–56 in front of 24,041 spectators at <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington</a>'s <a href="Rupp%20Arena">Rupp Arena</a>, a record crowd for a high school basketball game. In the first half of Clay County's semifinal matchup with <a href="Madison%20Central%20High%20School%20%28Kentucky%29">Madison Central High School</a>, Farmer scored 18 and his younger brother, Russ, added 12 to account for 30 of their team's 39 first-half points. The Tigers' 17-point halftime lead grew to as many as 25 in the second half, and the elder Farmer again led his team with 24 total points in Clay County's 78–58 victory.

The win over Madison Central set up a title game between Clay County and <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a>'s <a href="Ballard%20High%20School%20%28Louisville%2C%20Kentucky%29">Ballard High School</a>. Clay County had only one starter taller than , while Ballard started four players taller than , including star shooting guard <a href="Allan%20Houston">Allan Houston</a>. The game featured 24 ties and 15 lead changes; neither team led by more than four points during regulation. Farmer scored Clay County's last 9 points in regulation, including consecutive go-ahead baskets at 3:19, 2:46, and 0:30. Ballard's Leonard Taylor scored on a put-back basket at the buzzer to tie the score at 65 and force overtime. Clay County never trailed in the overtime, and Farmer's <a href="Jump%20shot%20%28basketball%29">jump shot</a> with 1:44 left put the Tigers in the lead for good. The 76–73 win was Clay County's first-ever KHSAA state championship. Farmer played all 35 minutes of the game and led all scorers with 27 points to go with 6 rebounds and 4 assists. He was named to the all-tournament team, selected the tournament's Most Valuable Player, and given the Ted Sanford Award for citizenship, basketball ability, academic achievement, and sportsmanship. He was also the only underclassman named to the "Lexington Herald-Leader"'s 1987 All-State First Team.

In the summer following his junior year, Farmer was named to the Kentucky Junior All-Star Team, which played exhibition games throughout Europe, including stops in <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>, the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, and <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>. After the European trip, he helped lead Clay County to a 15–0 record in <a href="Amateur%20Athletic%20Union">Amateur Athletic Union</a> play. It was the first AAU season which recognized the <a href="three-point%20field%20goal">three-point field goal</a>, and Farmer made 53 of his 73 three-point attempts. In July 1987, the Kentucky Junior All-Stars finished second to a team from <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> in the Kentucky Prep All-Star Festival at <a href="Memorial%20Coliseum%20%28University%20of%20Kentucky%29">Memorial Coliseum</a> in Lexington; Farmer sat out the championship game with a hand injury he suffered in the previous game.

Clay County was ranked as the top team in the state in the 1987–88 preseason coaches' poll, and Farmer was voted the state's best prep prospect, garnering twice as many votes as second-place prospect Allan Houston. The Tigers started the year 8–0 before suffering their only regular season loss in the first game of the 1987 <a href="Beach%20Ball%20Classic">Beach Ball Classic</a> against <a href="Eau%20Claire%20High%20School%20%28South%20Carolina%29">Eau Claire High School</a>. In Clay County's next game in the Classic, Farmer broke the school's career scoring record, scoring his 2,193rd point in a 76–57 win over <a href="Tulsa%2C%20Oklahoma">Tulsa, Oklahoma</a>'s <a href="Nathan%20Hale%20High%20School%20%28Oklahoma%29">Nathan Hale High School</a>. Gary Gregory, who had held the record since 1974, was in attendance at the game. In the tournament's fifth place game, Farmer scored 33 points and broke the single-game record for assists with 16, besting <a href="Kenny%20Anderson%20%28basketball%29">Kenny Anderson</a>'s year-old record of 13. Clay County defeated <a href="Simi%20Valley%20High%20School">Simi Valley High School</a> 95–91, and Farmer was selected as the tournament's Outstanding Player and named to the all-tournament team.

In the opening round of the January 1988 <a href="Louisville%20Invitational%20Tournament">Louisville Invitational Tournament</a> (LIT), Farmer scored 40 points on 15 of 30 shooting in an 86–82 win over <a href="Pleasure%20Ridge%20Park%20High%20School">Pleasure Ridge Park High School</a>, pushing Clay County's record to 16–1 and setting up another meeting with Allan Houston's Ballard team. Farmer scored 39 points – including 14 of his 15 free throws – and grabbed 12 rebounds in Clay County's 92–88 double overtime victory. In the championship game against <a href="Bardstown%20High%20School">Bardstown High School</a>, Farmer battled through fatigue and a thigh injury to lead his team in scoring with 24 points in an overtime win. In the three-game tournament, Farmer scored 103 points and played all of his team's 105 minutes, while committing only 4 <a href="Turnover%20%28basketball%29">turnovers</a>. He was selected to the all-tournament team and named tournament MVP. Already being recruited by <a href="WKU%20Hilltoppers%20men%27s%20basketball">Western Kentucky</a>, <a href="Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20men%27s%20basketball">Alabama</a>, and <a href="Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20men%27s%20basketball">Notre Dame</a>, Farmer's performances in the Beach Ball Classic and LIT brought notice from <a href="Eastern%20Kentucky%20Colonels%20men%27s%20basketball">Eastern Kentucky</a>, <a href="Wake%20Forest%20Demon%20Deacons%20men%27s%20basketball">Wake Forest</a>, <a href="Auburn%20Tigers%20men%27s%20basketball">Auburn</a>, <a href="Louisville%20Cardinals%20men%27s%20basketball">Louisville</a>, and <a href="Kentucky%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball">Kentucky</a>.

In the 49th District Championship game, Farmer broke Clay County's single-game scoring record with 51 points in a 101–59 win over <a href="Jackson%20County%20High%20School">Jackson County High School</a>. In the 13th Region tournament opener, Farmer scored 40 points as Clay County defeated <a href="Corbin%20High%20School">Corbin High School</a> 75–56. Clay County went on to defeat <a href="Bell%20County%20High%20School">Bell County High School</a> 53–36 in the semifinals and <a href="Knox%20Central%20High%20School">Knox Central High School</a> 73–69 in the finals to once again advance to the KHSAA state tournament. Farmer scored 38 points on 14 of 24 shooting in a victory over <a href="Rowan%20County%20High%20School">Rowan County High School</a> in the tournament's opening round. Four minutes into the Tigers' quarterfinal matchup against LaRue County High School, Farmer scored a three-point basket that tied <a href="Wallace%20Jones">Wallace "Wah Wah" Jones</a>' record for most points scored by a single player in the KHSAA state tournament (223). Farmer went on to break the record, scoring 30 points in a 91–54 win.

Farmer's 18 points in the semifinals against Pleasure Ridge Park helped Clay County to a 92–90 win and a rematch in the title game against Ballard High School. Farmer set a title game record against Ballard, scoring 51 points on 20 of 32 shooting (including 9 of 14 from three-point range), but Clay County lost 88–79. Ron King set the previous title game record in 1969 with 44; only Kelly Coleman's 69-point performance in 1956 bested Farmer's 51 points in a tournament game. He was selected to the all-tournament team, received a Dawahares' Sweet Sixteen Academic Scholarship Award, and was voted the tournament's MVP. Following the state tournament, Farmer said he was contacted by <a href="LSU%20Tigers%20men%27s%20basketball">LSU</a>, <a href="Vanderbilt%20Commodores%20men%27s%20basketball">Vanderbilt</a>, <a href="Virginia%20Cavaliers%20men%27s%20basketball">Virginia</a>, and Indiana in addition to schools who had previously recruited him.

For the season, Farmer averaged 27.1 points, 6.4 rebounds and 8.7 assists per game, all career highs. The only player to play in the KHSAA state tournament five times, he finished his career with records for most points scored (317) and most field goals made (127) for a career in the tournament. He posted a total of 2,793 points in his high school career. He was named <a href="Kentucky%20Mr.%20Basketball">Kentucky Mr. Basketball</a>, Kentucky Associated Press Male High School Athlete of the Year, and was the leading vote-getter for the Kentucky All-State Team, appearing on 160 of 167 ballots. The Clay County <a href="County%20Judge/Executive">Judge/Executive</a> renamed a road outside Farmer's hometown of Machester "Richie Boulevard". In a 1989 "Lexington Herald-Leader" poll of sportswriters and former high school coaches, Farmer was the near-unanimous choice as the best high school player in Kentucky during the 1980s.

In May 1988, Farmer was selected to an AAU all-star team that played an exhibition game in Memorial Coliseum against an all-star team from the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. He scored 17 points in a 107–93 win. In the first of two matchups with Indiana's All-Star team, the Kentucky All-Stars lost 102–82; Farmer had a bad shooting performance, going 5 of 18 from the field, including 2 of 9 from three-point range, for 15 points. In the rematch the following week, Farmer scored 19 points in a 112–100 loss.

Despite Farmer's prolific scoring, recruiters expressed concern about his small stature and lack of quickness. Even while lauding his skills, "Lexington Herald-Leader" sportswriter Mike Fields wrote that Farmer had "heavy legs and slow-going style". Regarding Farmer's size, Fields noted that, despite playing point guard, Farmer consistently <a href="Jump%20ball">jumped center</a> for Clay County and could jump high enough to execute a two-handed <a href="slam%20dunk">slam dunk</a>. The "Herald-Leader"'s Billy Reed compared Farmer to <a href="Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball">Indiana</a>'s <a href="Steve%20Alford">Steve Alford</a>, who overcame doubts about his size, speed, and defense to become the Hoosiers' all-time leading scorer and lead them to an NCAA Championship in <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1987</a>.

Kentucky was believed to be Farmer's school of choice, but coaches remained non-committal about his recruitment. The Wildcats had seven returning guards and <a href="small%20forward">small forward</a>s – Rex Chapman, <a href="Eric%20Manuel">Eric Manuel</a>, <a href="Deron%20Feldhaus">Deron Feldhaus</a>, <a href="Derrick%20Miller">Derrick Miller</a>, <a href="John%20Pelphrey">John Pelphrey</a>, <a href="Johnathon%20Davis%20%28basketball%29">Johnathon Davis</a>, and <a href="Sean%20Sutton">Sean Sutton</a> – and two signed recruits at those positions – <a href="Sean%20Woods">Sean Woods</a> and <a href="Chris%20Mills%20%28basketball%29">Chris Mills</a>. Conversely, four of their five frontcourt players – <a href="Winston%20Bennett">Winston Bennett</a>, <a href="Rob%20Lock">Rob Lock</a>, <a href="Cedric%20Jenkins">Cedric Jenkins</a> and <a href="Richard%20Madison">Richard Madison</a> – were graduating, and lone frontcourt signee <a href="Shawn%20Kemp">Shawn Kemp</a> had not yet <a href="Proposition%2048%20%28NCAA%29">qualified academically</a>. On March 21, 1988, Farmer told a Lexington television station that he would no longer consider Kentucky if they did not offer him a scholarship by the weekend. A week later, the "Lexington Herald-Leader" reported that coach <a href="Eddie%20Sutton">Eddie Sutton</a> extended the offer but that Farmer planned to take official visits to Western Kentucky and Vanderbilt, and would host an in-home visit with LSU coach <a href="Dale%20Brown%20%28basketball%29">Dale Brown</a> before deciding whether to accept Sutton's offer.

In April, Farmer played shooting guard for the North team in the Kentucky Derby Festival Classic. He scored 14 points on 5 of 12 shooting and grabbed 3 rebounds, but his team lost to the South team 134–125. Among his teammates in the Classic was Kentucky signee Sean Woods, who told the "Lexington Herald-Leader" that he and Farmer had become good friends and that he hoped Farmer would choose to play for the Wildcats. The paper also reported that Farmer had narrowed his list of potential college choices to three: Western Kentucky, LSU, and Kentucky. Farmer took an official visit to Western Kentucky the weekend of April 9, 1988, but on April 14, the second day of the April signing period, he held a press conference at his high school gymnasium to announce that he had signed a <a href="National%20Letter%20of%20Intent">National Letter of Intent</a> with Kentucky. He told the assembled crowd, "[Playing for Kentucky has] been a dream of mine as long as I can remember. Even before kindergarten, I always wanted to play for Kentucky."

By the time Farmer arrived at Kentucky, the roster had been decimated. Standout shooting guard Rex Chapman entered the <a href="1988%20NBA%20Draft">1988 NBA Draft</a>, ending his collegiate eligibility. Sophomore Eric Manuel was held out of basketball activities pending the outcome of an investigation into his <a href="ACT%20%28test%29">ACT</a> scores. Signees Shawn Kemp and Sean Woods failed to qualify academically, and Chris Mills was under investigation by the NCAA for cash allegedly sent to his father by assistant coach <a href="Dwane%20Casey">Dwane Casey</a> in violation of the Association's amateurism rules. A viral illness forced Farmer to miss about a third of the team's preseason practices. Once he was able to practice, Coach Eddie Sutton related that he lacked the conditioning to finish most practices. The "Lexington Herald-Leader"'s <a href="Jerry%20Tipton">Jerry Tipton</a> later reported that Farmer had to leave practice half an hour early two days a week to attend his American History class. Sutton also opined that Farmer's high school competition was inferior to that of <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> native Mills, but Farmer's high school coach pointed out that, during Farmer's senior season, 20 of his team's games were against teams ranked in the top 20 in their respective states.

In his first collegiate game, against <a href="Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball">Duke</a>, Farmer played 7 minutes and <a href="air%20ball">air ball</a>ed his only shot. After an early season loss to Notre Dame in the Big Four Classic dropped the Wildcats' record to 2–3, Sutton noted that Farmer, Sean Sutton, and <a href="LaRon%20Ellis">LaRon Ellis</a> had all missed practice time with <a href="influenza">the flu</a>. After managing just 17 points in the Wildcats' first five games, Farmer scored 10 points in 20 minutes in the team's sixth game against <a href="Northwestern%20State%20Demons%20basketball">Northwestern State</a>. With 12 seconds to go in the game and Kentucky trailing 84–82, Farmer was whistled for an intentional foul on Northwestern State's Roman Banks while trying to draw a <a href="Personal%20foul%20%28basketball%29%23Charging%20and%20blocking">charge</a> on an inbounds play. Banks maintained that Farmer had tugged Banks toward him and fallen down, attempting to draw the call, but Farmer and Sutton both denied the alleged chicanery. Banks hit one of two free throws, and Farmer missed a potentially game-tying three-point shot at the buzzer, dropping the Wildcats to 2–4 on the season. Farmer followed up with a 15-point performance in a win against <a href="Western%20Carolina%20Catamounts%20men%27s%20basketball">Western Carolina</a>. In the <a href="Kentucky%20Invitational%20Tournament">Kentucky Invitational Tournament</a>, where Kentucky lost its opening round game to <a href="Bowling%20Green%20Falcons%20men%27s%20basketball">Bowling Green</a> before winning the third-place game against <a href="Marshall%20Thundering%20Herd%20men%27s%20basketball">Marshall</a>, Farmer scored 12 points in each game.

Farmer's sudden increase in scoring prompted complaints from the fan base that Sutton disliked Farmer and was limiting his minutes out of favoritism for his son, Sean. Some fans began to <a href="Booing">boo</a> when Sutton, the team's starting point guard, returned to the game to replace Farmer. Farmer maintained that Sutton had treated him fairly, and Sutton cited lack of practice time as the reason for Farmer's limited playing time; in early January 1989, local media reported that Farmer had been limited in practice due to right knee pain. Questions about Farmer's playing time continued into <a href="Southeastern%20Conference">Southeastern Conference</a> play, even as Farmer's scoring also dropped off. By late January, Sutton publicly complained about the need for more scoring from the bench, which had produced only 29 points in the team's previous seven games. "Lexington Herald-Leader" columnist Billy Reed wrote: "Richie simply isn't ready to play at this level yet".

Before a January game against <a href="Georgia%20Bulldogs%20men%27s%20basketball">Georgia</a>, two-time former <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">governor</a> <a href="Happy%20Chandler">A. B. "Happy" Chandler</a> presented Farmer with the 1988 Kentucky Sportsman of the Year Award. The youngest person and first high school athlete ever to win the award, Farmer finished ahead of former Kentucky guard <a href="Pat%20Riley">Pat Riley</a>, who had just coached the <a href="NBA">NBA</a>'s <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a> to a second consecutive championship.

With the Wildcats' record sitting at 11–13 overall and 6–6 in conference play headed into a February road game against conference leader LSU, Farmer remained in Lexington with a combination of a stomach virus and the flu. Teammates LaRon Ellis, Chris Mills, and Derrick Miller had also been ill, but all recovered in time to make the trip. Farmer shot just 2 of 14 in limited minutes in the month of February. In Kentucky's final home game of the season, Farmer hit a three-pointer – his only points of the game – with two seconds left to lift the Wildcats to a 70–69 win over <a href="Ole%20Miss%20Rebels%20men%27s%20basketball">Ole Miss</a>. The following game, Farmer missed a potentially game-winning jump shot at the buzzer in a 68–67 loss at <a href="Mississippi%20State%20Bulldogs%20men%27s%20basketball">Mississippi State</a> to end the Wildcats' regular season. In its first game of the Southeastern Conference Tournament the next week, Kentucky lost to Vanderbilt 77–63 in a game where Farmer missed all four of his field goal attempts. Finishing with a 13–19 record – the team's worst record since the 1926-27 season – the Wildcats were not invited to any postseason tournament. At the team's annual postseason awards banquet, Farmer received the free throw award.

Between Farmer's freshman and sophomore years, the NCAA banned Eric Manuel from playing in any further NCAA games because of questions about the legitimacy of his ACT scores and levied a two-year postseason ban, a one-year ban on televised games, and scholarship reductions against Kentucky as punishment for payments allegedly made to the father of Chris Mills. Mills was ruled ineligible to play at Kentucky and transferred to <a href="Arizona%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball">Arizona</a>; Sean Sutton and LaRon Ellis also transferred to other schools in the wake of the sanctions. Eddie Sutton resigned and was replaced by <a href="New%20York%20Knicks">New York Knicks</a> head coach <a href="Rick%20Pitino">Rick Pitino</a>. After recruit Henry Thomas suffered an off-season injury to his <a href="anterior%20cruciate%20ligament">anterior cruciate ligament</a>, Kentucky was left with just 8 scholarship players, none of whom were taller than .
Pitino and newly hired strength and conditioning coach <a href="Ray%20Oliver">Rock Oliver</a> instituted an intensive conditioning program. The "Lexington Herald-Leader" noted that Farmer lost in the off-season, reducing his weight to , and Pitino praised his improved speed and endurance. Pitino also brought <a href="Billy%20Donovan">Billy Donovan</a> – who played point guard on Pitino's teams at <a href="Providence%20Friars%20men%27s%20basketball">Providence</a> – to Kentucky as a graduate assistant to mentor the team's two point guards, Farmer and Sean Woods (now academically eligible).

The team's first intra-squad scrimmage showcased Pitino's fast-paced, three-point-heavy style; the two teams combined to shoot 98-of-175 from the field, including 23-of-57 from three, as the Blue team defeated the White team 145–85. Farmer led the White team (the projected reserves) in scoring with 26 points, including 5-of-13 shooting from three-point range. In the next scrimmage, played at Farmer's alma mater, Clay County High School, Farmer scored 32 points, but the White team lost to the Blue team again, 125–117. The teams again combined for 175 shots, and Pitino said before the game that he wanted both teams to exceed 120 points. Farmer sat out much of the second half of the final scrimmage due to illness but scored 17 points on 5-of-16 shooting in a 124–120 victory for the White team.

After Kentucky's second game of the year – a 71–69 loss at Indiana – Pitino noted that Farmer, who had 4 points and 4 assists in the game, was benefiting from extra one-on-one coaching sessions with Donovan. In a December 19, 1989, victory against <a href="Furman%20Paladins%20men%27s%20basketball">Furman</a>, Farmer attempted 7 three-pointers – tied for second-most in the game – as the Wildcats set an NCAA record for most three-pointers attempted in a game with 47, besting their own record of 41 set earlier in the month against <a href="Tennessee%20Tech%20Golden%20Eagles%20men%27s%20basketball">Tennessee Tech</a>. A week later, Farmer set a career-high in points with 21 – including three made three-pointers – as the Wildcats set records for the most three-pointers made in a single game (21) and most points ever scored against <a href="North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20men%27s%20basketball">North Carolina</a>, but lost the game 121–110. After the game, Pitino opined that Farmer "holds back a little bit" and noted that he would expect Farmer to work hard in the off-season to reach his potential. The Wildcats closed out 1989 with a closer-than-expected 86–79 loss against eighth-ranked Louisville, but local sportswriter John McGill said Farmer had his best game to date with 10 points, 9 assists and 3 steals off the bench.

In a January 20, 1990, contest against conference foe <a href="Tennessee%20Volunteers%20basketball">Tennessee</a>, Pitino benched senior shooting guard Derrick Miller to start the second half, giving his spot to Farmer. Farmer, who had no assists and 4 turnovers in nine minutes during the first half, responded with 7 assists and only one turnover in the second half. Miller, who entered the game with 17:38 left, scored 17 points in the second half as the Wildcats turned a 44–39 halftime deficit into a 95–83 win. Miller credited Pitino's decision to bring him off the bench in the second half with taking the pressure off him and helping him get more comfortable in the game. After a mid-week loss to Auburn, Pitino announced that he would move Farmer into the starting lineup, replacing Sean Woods, for the Wildcats' January 27 contest against Ole Miss. "We will change the lineup to try to get more concentration. We'll try Richie Farmer at the point and see what we get out of that. Right now we're not getting too much out of that position," Pitino told reporters during an SEC teleconference. In a 98–79 victory, Farmer tallied 11 points, 2 assists and no turnovers in 24 minutes; Woods registered 8 points, 4 assists, and 2 turnovers in 23 minutes off the bench. Pitino said practice performance would determine whether Woods or Farmer would start the Wildcats' next game against <a href="Mississippi%20State%20Bulldogs%20basketball">Mississippi State</a>, and he ultimately decided to return Woods to the starting rotation.

On February 15, 1990, in front of a record 24,301 fans at Rupp Arena, Farmer hit six consecutive free throws to help Kentucky overcome a career-high 41 points by LSU's <a href="Mahmoud%20Abdul-Rauf">Chris Jackson</a> and pull within a half-game of first place in the SEC with a 100–95 win. Farmer entered the game after Sean Woods fouled out with 1:54 left, and with Kentucky leading by two with just over a minute left, LSU coach Dale Brown instructed his team to foul Farmer on each Kentucky possession to conserve the game clock and regain possession of the ball. "We felt Farmer did not have much experience, and he was playing a little tight," Brown said after the game. Told of Brown's instructions to foul Farmer – the team's best free throw shooter at 86% – during a post-game interview, Pitino expressed surprise. "[Brown] said he purposely wanted to foul Richie Farmer? What was his reason? ... If I had to pick a guy to shoot it in front of 50,000 people with your life at stake, it's going to be Richie Farmer shooting that free throw."

Less than two minutes into a subsequent game at Alabama, Farmer and walk-on Tony Cooper both left the bench when Kentucky's Reggie Hanson and Alabama's <a href="Robert%20Horry">Robert Horry</a> engaged in a fist-fight. Hansen, Horry and Cooper were all ejected, but Farmer was not. Asked about the difference in penalties for Cooper and Farmer, official Don Ferguson admitted he did not want to hurt Kentucky's shallow rotation any further by ejecting another regular contributor. As a token of appreciation to the fans, after the Wildcats' February 24 "<a href="Senior%20day">Senior Day</a>" win over Auburn, Pitino called his players back onto the floor and presented the individual awards usually reserved for the team's annual awards banquet. Farmer received the "Best Free Throw Shooter" award. For the season, he averaged 7.0 points per game. Fans and the media nicknamed the team "Pitino's Bombinos" for their fast-paced offense that relied heavily on the three-point shot, which contrasted sharply with the more deliberate offensive schemes run by Pitino's immediate predecessors, <a href="Joe%20B.%20Hall">Joe B. Hall</a> and Eddie Sutton.

In September 1990, Farmer had a disagreement with strength coach Rock Oliver, returned home to Manchester, and considered leaving the Kentucky basketball team. Pitino, who was away from campus on a recruiting visit, called Farmer and scheduled a meeting with him for the following weekend, after which Farmer decided to return to the team. Pitino characterized the incident as "a case of someone getting down and needing a couple of hugs to get their spirits lifted a little bit". Pitino later added that he thought the transfer of point guard <a href="Travis%20Ford">Travis Ford</a> from <a href="Missouri%20Tigers%20men%27s%20basketball">Missouri</a> – bringing additional competition in the backcourt for the 1991–92 season – may have played into Farmer's brief departure.

Pitino expressed uncertainty entering the season about who would replace Derrick Miller as the team's starting shooting guard. Farmer was the leading candidate until suffering a bruised kidney during a public intra-squad scrimmage in early November and reaggravating the injury during another public scrimmage days later. Sophomore <a href="Jeff%20Brassow">Jeff Brassow</a> got the start for the Wildcats in their season opening win against <a href="Penn%20Quakers%20men%27s%20basketball">Penn</a>. Farmer scored 12 points off the bench – one of six Wildcats with double-digit points – but left the game with 3:17 remaining after taking an inadvertent elbow in the back. In the next game against <a href="Cincinnati%20Bearcats%20men%27s%20basketball">Cincinnati</a>, Farmer briefly replaced starter Sean Woods at point guard after Woods committed eight turnovers in the first half, but Farmer fared little better, committing two turnovers and uncharacteristically missing two consecutive free throws. In the second half, after Woods picked up his fourth foul, Farmer entered the game and provided steady leadership to preserve a 75–71 win. In the Wildcats' third game of the year – a win over Notre Dame in the Big Four Classic – Farmer led the team in scoring with 19 points on 7-of-11 shooting; he added 4 assists and 2 steals against no turnovers in 23 minutes of play.

Prior to Kentucky's December 15 matchup against <a href="Chattanooga%20Mocs%20basketball">Chattanooga</a>, Pitino publicly contemplated starting Farmer in place of Sean Woods at point and either <a href="Carlos%20Toomer">Carlos Toomer</a> or <a href="Jody%20Thompson%20%28basketball%29">Jody Thompson</a> at shooting guard instead of Brassow. The day of the game, he announced Farmer would make the second start of his career at shooting guard alongside Woods at point. Although he tied with Pelphrey for a team-high 17 points, Farmer returned to the bench for the following game against Indiana because Pitino felt he didn't have the size to defend the Hoosiers' bigger guards.

In a December 22, 1990, win against in-state rival Western Kentucky, Farmer posted a new career high with 22 points, despite missing his first five three-point attempts of the game. He would not approach such scoring numbers again until a February 3, 1991, contest against Georgia, when he scored 16 points after seeing extended minutes due to Woods being in foul trouble. Farmer suffered a <a href="black%20eye">black eye</a> during the game, which was notable for its physicality. "<a href="Messenger-Inquirer">Messenger-Inquirer</a>" sportswriter Jake Jennings also noted that Farmer relied on drives to the basket to score, as opposed to his usual penchant for shooting three-point shots.

Before Kentucky's February 13 game against Tennessee, Woods was hospitalized with an "acute viral illness". Farmer started in his place, tallying 14 points and 7 rebounds in an 85–74 win. Although Farmer also started the next game against Ole Miss, just 48 seconds into the game his knee made contact with an opponent's knee, sending him to the locker room and Woods into the game. Farmer returned to score a team-high 21 points, but also suffered a scratched eye, in a win that gave Kentucky the best record in the SEC; Woods logged 9 points and 7 assists in almost 24 minutes of action off the bench. Woods returned to the starting lineup in Kentucky's next game at Vanderbilt, but Farmer remained a starter as well, replacing Jeff Brassow at shooting guard. He scored 13 of his team-high 19 in the first half, but Kentucky lost the game 98–87. Pitino characterized Farmer as "exhausted" in the second half, playing heavy minutes in relief of Woods, who managed only 15 minutes before fouling out. Two games later, Farmer hit four of his first five shots – including three 3-pointers – and finished with a team-high 16 in a win against Alabama. Farmer notched 20 points – one behind team leader <a href="Jamal%20Mashburn">Jamal Mashburn</a> – in Kentucky's final game of the season, a 114–93 win over Auburn. The win pushed Kentucky to a conference-best 14–4 record, but an SEC rule forbade declaring a team the regular season champion if they were ineligible for postseason play, as Kentucky was.

Farmer was one of five players to average double-digit points per game (10.1); it was the first time since Kentucky's 1977–78 championship team that so many players had averaged double-digit scoring. At the team's postseason awards banquet, Farmer received the Free Throw Award for the third straight year and was also named the team's Most Improved Player. Pitino named the four rising seniors – Farmer, Pelphrey, Woods, and Feldhaus – co-captains for the upcoming season.

Shortly after the team's first practice in October 1991, Pitino again commented on Farmer's improved conditioning, calling it his "biggest surprise" of the early practices. He also announced that seniors Sean Woods and John Pelphrey would join Jamal Mashburn in the starting lineup – as the team's point guard, small forward, and power forward, respectively – while senior Deron Feldhaus would reprise his "<a href="sixth%20man">sixth man</a>" role from the previous season. Farmer was projected to compete with junior college transfer Dale Brown for the starting shooting guard spot. At the team's annual <a href="Midnight%20Madness%20%28basketball%29">Midnight Madness</a> scrimmage, Farmer joined the announced starters and sophomore <a href="Gimel%20Martinez">Gimel Martinez</a> on the Blue team, which defeated the White team 67–54. Farmer had 18 points, including 4 of 6 made three-point baskets. Forbidden from holding off-campus scrimmages by new NCAA regulations, Kentucky played its only public preseason scrimmage in Memorial Coliseum; Farmer joined the White team, scoring 21 points on 6-of-12 shooting in a losing effort.

Suffering from the flu, Farmer did not play in the Wildcats' season-opening win against <a href="West%20Virginia%20Mountaineers%20men%27s%20basketball">West Virginia</a> in the <a href="NIT%20Season%20Tip-Off">Preseason NIT</a>. He played in the following game, but missed all seven of his shots as Kentucky was eliminated from the tournament by <a href="Pitt%20Panthers%20men%27s%20basketball">Pitt</a> 85–67, the team's worst home loss since 1988. Farmer came off the bench in the Wildcats' next game – a 90–69 win over <a href="UMass%20Minutemen%20basketball">UMass</a> – but matched his career-high with 22 points, including a perfect 10-of-10 from the free throw line; he saw extended minutes in the game due to a season-ending knee injury to Jeff Brassow. UMass coach <a href="John%20Calipari">John Calipari</a> called Farmer "the difference in the game".

During the non-conference season, Farmer made notable plays late in important games, including a game-clinching rebound against Indiana and a key three-pointer in the waning minutes of a game against Ohio. In a January 2, 1992, game against Notre Dame, Farmer entered the game after just three minutes when starter Dale Brown sprained his ankle. In the first half, he equaled his career high of 22 points – including five three-point baskets – en route to a new career-high of 28 in a 91–70 victory. This performance notwithstanding, complaints from the fan base about Farmer's lack of playing time – he averaged 17.7 minutes per game through early February – grew louder and eventually became the subject of media interest. In January, two of Kentucky's smaller newspapers printed articles on the subject – one speculating that Pitino was intentionally holding Farmer back so Farmer's popularity wouldn't eclipse his own. Kentucky <a href="Beat%20reporting">beat writer</a> Jerry Tipton addressed the topic at length in a "Lexington Herald-Leader" column on February 8, drawing a rebuke from Pitino, who called the issue a "non-story".

In late January, shortly before the Tipton article appeared, Pitino decided to start Farmer against Ole Miss. He believed starting Woods and bringing Brown off the bench would allow him to have one of his two best defenders on the floor more often; he also believed Farmer's height would not be a liability against Ole Miss' smaller starting guards. Farmer scored 10 points on 4-of-10 shooting and led the team with 6 rebounds in a 96–78 victory. Pitino then decided to start Farmer and fellow reserve Deron Feldhaus in Kentucky's next game against LSU, hoping to draw Tigers center <a href="Shaquille%20O%27Neal">Shaquille O'Neal</a> farther from the basket by starting better shooters. The strategy was not successful – Farmer shot 2-of-9 and Feldhaus 1-of-10 in a 74–53 loss – but Pitino announced that Farmer would continue to start because he was exhibiting more shooting confidence than Kentucky's other guards. Farmer responded with 16 points, including four 3-pointers, in an 85–67 victory over Auburn. He continued to start for the Wildcats for the rest of the regular season, culminating in a Senior day win against Tennessee, when he scored 11 of Kentucky's first 16 points and saw extended minutes after fellow senior Sean Woods was ejected for fighting with the Volunteers' <a href="Jay%20Price">Jay Price</a>.

With the team's probation over, Farmer and the other three seniors played in their first – and only – postseason games in the 1991–92 season. After an opening round win against Vanderbilt in the SEC Tournament in <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham, Alabama</a>, Kentucky won its third meeting of the season with LSU 80–74 in the second round; the Tigers were without star center Shaquille O'Neal, who was suspended for fighting with Tennessee's <a href="Carlus%20Groves">Carlus Groves</a> in his team's opening round victory. In the finals, Kentucky faced three-time defending tournament champion Alabama, which was without forward <a href="Andre%20Perry%20%28basketball%29">Andre Perry</a>, who suffered a broken foot in the semifinals against Arkansas. Star sophomore Jamal Mashburn led all scorers with 28 points on 12-of-14 shooting, en route to an 80–54 victory and tournament Most Valuable Player honors. Mashburn, who shot 26-for-31 in the Wildcats' three tournament games, said of his performance, "At the beginning of the season, I told the four seniors 'this is the only thing I can give you. I can't give you any presents, but I can give you an SEC championship. We gave them a present they really deserved."

Kentucky was seeded second in the East Region of the <a href="1992%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1992 NCAA Tourment</a>. The Wildcats held a narrow 62–59 lead with 8:25 to play in their first round matchup against <a href="Colonial%20Athletic%20Association">Colonial Athletic Association</a> champion <a href="Old%20Dominion%20Monarchs%20basketball">Old Dominion</a> when Farmer hit a layup that keyed a decisive four-and-a-half-minute, 15–2 run, helping Kentucky to an 88–69 victory. Kentucky's next game, against <a href="Iowa%20State%20Cyclones%20men%27s%20basketball">Iowa State</a>, was decided at the free throw line. Kentucky was called for 29 fouls in the game, and Iowa State hit 34-of-38 free throws, but in the final 1:27 of the game, Kentucky shot 14 free throws – making 11 – to win the game 106–98. Farmer, who finished with 14 points, hit four consecutive free throws in the final minute of the game. After the game, Pitino commented, "If not for Richie Farmer, we don't win the game." In the regional semifinals, the Wildcats faced a rematch with third-seeded UMass. After the Minutemen cut a 20-point Kentucky lead to 2 with almost six minutes remaining in the game, UMass coach John Calipari was whistled for a technical foul for leaving the <a href="coach%27s%20box">coach's box</a> while arguing that one of his players had been fouled on a loose ball rebound; Farmer, who finished with 7 points, made the resulting free throws, starting an 11–2 run that helped Kentucky to an 87–77 win.

In the regional finals, Kentucky trailed top-seeded Duke by 12 in the second half, but battled back to force overtime. With 2.1 seconds left in overtime, Sean Woods hit a running bank shot to put Kentucky up one. Then, Duke's <a href="Christian%20Laettner">Christian Laettner</a> caught a long inbounds pass, faked right, and hit a shot at the buzzer to give Duke the 104–103 victory. <a href="The%20Shot%20%28Duke%E2%80%93Kentucky%29">The game</a>, which ended Farmer's playing career, is widely regarded as one of the greatest college basketball games of all time. Duke coach <a href="Mike%20Krzyzewski">Mike Krzyzewski</a> later recalled, "The thing I'll always remember about that game is Richie Farmer's face as the ball went in. That, to me, helped me to have a better understanding of that game. ... To me, that was the deepest emotion that was on the court, the emotion that was on Richie Farmer's face." Describing the impact of the game, Jerry Tipton wrote, "On one fateful night, the Cats obliterated any lingering association with $1,000 packages and academic fraud. Alluring images of courage, honest effort and heartracing excitement became symbols of UK basketball." Local media gave the seniors the nickname "The Unforgettables". Collectively, they were voted as the "Lexington Herald-Leader"'s 1992 Sportsmen of the Year.
At the team's annual awards night, Farmer won the award for fewest turnovers per minute played (32 in 705 minutes), but the free throw award – won by Farmer the previous three years – went to Gimel Martinez. Athletics director <a href="C.%20M.%20Newton">C. M. Newton</a> surprised the four seniors by hanging their jerseys in the rafters at Rupp Arena. In so doing, he violated the standards for the honor set by former athletics director <a href="Cliff%20Hagan">Cliff Hagan</a>. Those guidelines held that honorees must have completed a degree from the university and be at least 10 years removed from the end of their athletic eligibility. Newton cited the seniors' "unusual and outstanding contributions" to the program as reasons to make an exception to the standards, adding, "I won't say there never will be another exception, but the likelihood of another is not great." Sportscaster <a href="Cris%20Collinsworth">Cris Collinsworth</a> protested Newton's action because it honored the seniors before other program standouts like <a href="Kyle%20Macy">Kyle Macy</a> and <a href="Rick%20Robey">Rick Robey</a>.

After the season, the four seniors participated in a 21-city barnstorming tour of the state, playing against a group of local players in each city. At the game in Farmer's hometown of Manchester, Farmer scored 107 points for the seniors' team before switching to the Clay County team for the remainder of the game, hitting an additional three-pointer for a total of 30. Pelphrey hit a three to give the seniors – without Farmer – a 179–176 lead with 25 seconds left in the game, and the three seniors triple-teamed Farmer to prevent him from getting a shot off to tie the game. Twenty percent of the proceeds from each game benefited local charities, and another twenty percent of the total proceeds from the tour was divided between the University of Kentucky Library Fund, <a href="Big%20Brothers%20Big%20Sisters%20of%20America">Big Brothers Big Sisters</a>, and AIDS Volunteers of Lexington.

In August 1992, Antex Publishing of Lexington released Farmer's <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a> entitled "Richie". In addition to the standard printing, the publisher offered a special edition of the book in which direct quotes from Farmer were rendered in blue type, similar to the words of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> in <a href="red%20letter%20edition">red letter edition</a>s of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>. Long-time Wildcats radio broadcaster <a href="Cawood%20Ledford">Cawood Ledford</a> wrote the book's <a href="foreword">foreword</a>. By the end of October, the book had sold 30,000 copies, and a second printing from the publisher was ordered. Farmer participated in several book signings across the state, as well as filming television advertisements for local products and conducting speaking engagements for dental insurance provider <a href="Delta%20Dental">Delta Dental</a> to promote good oral health in his native eastern Kentucky.

Farmer continued taking classes at Kentucky with support from the Cawood Ledford Scholarship fund – designated to help University of Kentucky athletes who have exhausted their athletic eligibility finish their degrees – and in 1995, earned a <a href="bachelor%20of%20science">bachelor of science</a> degree with a double major in agricultural economics and agribusiness management. After graduation, he briefly worked in <a href="sport%20marketing">sports marketing</a> in Lexington before returning to Manchester to join his father in the insurance business. In addition to selling insurance, Farmer also got his securities license to sell annuities, and eventually rose to become vice-president of Kentucky Financial Group.

On April 15, 1998, Farmer married Rebecca Ann Morgan. The couple had three sons – Richard III ("Trey") and Ryan, born on November 30 in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and Tate, born in 2001.

Farmer was inducted into the KHSAA Hall of Fame in 1998 and the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame in 2002. He was one of 88 inaugural members of the University of Kentucky Athletics Hall of Fame in 2005 and one of 16 inaugural members of the Kentucky High School Basketball Hall of Fame in 2012. "The Unforgettables" were honored on a limited edition collector's bottle of <a href="Maker%27s%20Mark">Maker's Mark</a> <a href="Bourbon%20whiskey">bourbon</a> in 2007.

On January 28, 2003, Farmer announced he would seek the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> nomination for Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner. In his announcement, he acknowledged that he had never operated a farm, but noted that he knew many farmers and held a degree in an agriculture-related field. Ellen Williams, chair of the state's Republican Party, said Farmer's candidacy would bring "star quality" to a down-ballot race (i.e. state offices other than governor and lieutenant governor). No Republican had been elected to any of those offices since 1967.

Farmer waited until three weeks before the <a href="primary%20election">primary election</a> to begin seriously campaigning and focused on population centers such as Lexington, Louisville, <a href="Bowling%20Green%2C%20Kentucky">Bowling Green</a>, and the <a href="Northern%20Kentucky">Northern Kentucky</a> area, where Republican voters were more concentrated. At that time, campaign finance reports showed that Farmer had spent about half of the $36,055 raised for his campaign, while his opponent, Leonard "Buck" Beasley, had raised only $450 and spent nothing. While he proposed no major changes to the operation of the agriculture department, Farmer emphasized teamwork as a means to improve the state's agricultural sector, cited the need to find new markets for Kentucky agricultural products, and expressed a desire to improve the public perception of the agriculture industry, saying "Farmers have a great story to tell, and I will use any name recognition I have gained through my experience with UK basketball to help them tell it." He also raised the possibility of engaging other former basketball players to promote the work of the agriculture department and indicated that he would lobby to have half of Kentucky's allocation of the <a href="Tobacco%20Master%20Settlement%20Agreement">Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement</a> directed to the state's Agriculture Development Board.

With 109,742 votes – 79 percent of the total cast – Farmer garnered more votes than any other Republican candidate for any office on the ballot "en route" to winning the nomination. The victory set up a general election contest against Democratic nominee Alice Woods Baesler, a state agriculture department aide and wife of former <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Congressman</a> and Kentucky basketball player <a href="Scotty%20Baesler">Scotty Baesler</a>. Bolstered by his significantly higher name recognition, Farmer led an early July <a href="SurveyUSA">SurveyUSA</a> poll 61% to 33% over Baesler. Baesler charged that Farmer was unqualified for the job of agriculture commissioner and that his high poll numbers and convincing primary victory were driven by his popularity as a basketball player, criticizing him for featuring his status as a member of "The Unforgettables" in his campaign literature. Farmer responded that his college degree qualified him to be agriculture commissioner and said his need to continue his day job to support his family often kept him away from the campaign trail where he could expound more on his ideas for running the Department of Agriculture.

At an August debate in <a href="Owensboro%2C%20Kentucky">Owensboro</a>, Farmer proposed the cross-promotion of Kentucky agricultural products and the <a href="List%20of%20Kentucky%20state%20parks">state park system</a>, awarding points for buying Kentucky produced groceries that could be redeemed for souvenirs and perks during stays at state parks. On October 21, "<a href="The%20Kentucky%20Post">The Kentucky Post</a>" gave Baesler its endorsement, contrasting her experience running a farm and her involvement with the agriculture department to Farmer's lack of agriculture experience and frequent absence at campaign events. Later that week, the "Lexington Herald-Leader" also endorsed Baesler, and followed up the next day with an article noting that, as of October 3, nearly one-third of the $87,825.20 Farmer had spent during the campaign went to relatives – including his parents, brother, sister, and in-laws – for salaries and campaign-related reimbursements. Interviewed by phone, Farmer responded, "[My family has] probably worked 60, 70, 80 hours a week campaigning for me trying to get me elected. I don't think we have done anything wrong." Richard Beliles, chairman of campaign finance watchdog Common Cause of Kentucky, said Farmer's actions were not illegal but were "rather odd". Farmer overcame the bad press, however, to take the election by a vote of 575,049 to 466,321.

In April 2004, Farmer announced the formation of a committee to study the effectiveness of state owned and operated <a href="farmer%27s%20markets">farmer's markets</a>. In June 2005, he was elected secretary of the <a href="Southern%20Association%20of%20State%20Departments%20of%20Agriculture">Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture</a>; in 2007, he was elected president of the organization. Farmer also sought to prevent an outbreak of <a href="vesicular%20stomatitis%20virus">vesicular stomatitis virus</a> in the state's horses and cattle by banning the import of animals from 20 western counties where the virus was known to have infected animals. On Farmer's advice, Governor <a href="Ernie%20Fletcher">Ernie Fletcher</a> requested that the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a> designate Kentucky as an agricultural disaster area after <a href="April%202007%20nor%27easter">an April 2007 cold snap</a> devastated the state's fruit and wheat crops; the designation made Kentucky farmers eligible for low-interest federal loans to help compensate for their lost crop revenue.

In December 2004, Kentucky's Registry of Election Finance, the agency that enforces the state's campaign finance laws, hired Farmer's sister, Rhonda F. Gray, who had previously served as chair of her brother's campaign for agriculture commissioner. Registry chair John Rogers maintained that Gray was hired on her own merits, and Gray promised to recuse herself from any work that might involve her brother's future campaigns. The following May, "The Kentucky Post" published excerpts from an email from Dick Murgatroyd, Fletcher's deputy chief of staff, to Transportation Cabinet officials asking them to find a job for Farmer's brother-in-law, Jamie Gray; the email indicated that Murgatroyd was responsible for finding jobs for both James and Rhonda Gray. Gray was later hired as an administrative specialist in the Transportation Cabinet. Farmer denied any involvement in the hiring decisions beyond submitting recommendations for both candidates. In July, Murgatroyd was <a href="indictment">indicted</a> on 19 counts of violating the state's <a href="merit%20system">merit system</a> by making politically motivated hires, including that of Jamie Gray. A transportation official testified in September that Farmer had declined one job for Gray because the salary was too low and had negotiated a higher salary on the job Gray eventually got. Farmer called the claims "ludicrous" and "simply not true".

Following the resignation of <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Lieutenant Governor</a> <a href="Steve%20Pence">Steve Pence</a> in June 2006, Farmer was mentioned as a possible running mate for Fletcher in his <a href="Kentucky%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%202007">upcoming re-election campaign</a>, but Fletcher chose <a href="Robbie%20Rudolph">Robbie Rudolph</a> instead, and Farmer announced his intent to seek re-election as agriculture commissioner. In the Republican primary, Farmer faced Don Stosberg, a former budget analyst for Kentucky's <a href="Legislative%20Research%20Commission">Legislative Research Commission</a>. Again, Farmer was criticized for failing to appear at several campaign events; Stosberg told the "Lexington Herald-Leader", "[Farmer is] famous for three things: shooting three-point shots, not returning phone calls and not showing up." Farmer responded that he was carrying out the duties of his office during his absences from the events. Farmer countered his absences by outspending his opponent 35-to-1, investing a reported $102,000 in his campaign. Farmer captured 85% of the vote, defeating Stosberg by a vote of 155,576 to 26,897. Name recognition played a role in both parties' primaries: Farmer enjoyed high name recognition from his days as a basketball player, while the Democratic nominee, David Lynn Williams, had a name similar to that of <a href="President%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20Senate">Kentucky Senate President</a> <a href="David%20L.%20Williams%20%28politician%29">David L. Williams</a>.

Shortly after the primary election, Williams made a series of politically unsavvy remarks in an interview published by a weekly online magazine devoted to Kentucky agricultural issues; among the gaffes were calling the state agricultural development board and long-time Kentucky Democratic Senator <a href="Wendell%20H.%20Ford">Wendell H. Ford</a> "a bunch of damn liars". State Democratic chairman <a href="Jonathan%20Miller%20%28Kentucky%20politician%29">Jonathan Miller</a> called Williams' statements "offensive" and said that several of the party's executive committee members desired to have Williams removed as the party's candidate.

In June, Williams was arrested on <a href="misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a> charges of <a href="menacing">menacing</a>, <a href="disorderly%20conduct">disorderly conduct</a>, and <a href="harassment">harassment</a> for allegedly threatening his niece, who was the city clerk of <a href="Glasgow%2C%20Kentucky">Glasgow, Kentucky</a>, because she did not produce records he had requested under Kentucky's <a href="Freedom%20of%20information%20in%20the%20United%20States">open records law</a>. His trial was not scheduled until after the election.

By October, a <a href="Research%202000">Research 2000</a> poll showed Farmer leading the race 54%–35%, with 11% undecided, and campaign finance documents showed that Farmer had spent $57,075 of the $168,650 he raised for his general election campaign, while Williams had raised and spent less than $1,000. The "Lexington Herald-Leader" made no endorsement in the race, stating that Farmer's lack of knowledge was obvious during his first term, but that he "looks like a farm-policy genius" compared to Williams. On election day, Farmer set a record for the most votes received in an election for a constitutional office in Kentucky, garnering 641,789 (64%) to Williams' 363,188 (36%). During his victory speech, Farmer denied rumors that he was considering switching his affiliation to the Democratic Party.

Farmer asked <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Agriculture">U.S. Agriculture Secretary</a> <a href="Tom%20Vilsack">Tom Vilsack</a> for declarations of agricultural disasters in the wake of an <a href="January%202009%20Central%20Plains%20and%20Midwest%20ice%20storm">ice storm in January 2009</a> that endangered the state's livestock and <a href="2010%20Tennessee%20floods">flooding</a> that affected <a href="Kentucky%20Lake">Kentucky Lake</a> in 2010, damaging large portions of the state's corn, soybean, and wheat crops. In December 2010, he launched a joint investigation with Democratic <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Kentucky">Attorney General</a> <a href="Jack%20Conway%20%28politician%29">Jack Conway</a> into claims that the Eastern Livestock company had not paid Kentucky cattlemen for $130 million in livestock.

Farmer was <a href="Term%20limits%20in%20the%20United%20States">limited to two terms</a> by the <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">Kentucky Constitution</a>, and in October 2009, the "Lexington Herald-Leader" reported that he was "in discussions" about running for governor in the <a href="Kentucky%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%202011">2011 election</a>. In August 2010, Farmer announced that he would be "running for something" in the upcoming election and would announce his plans within weeks after the <a href="Kentucky%20State%20Fair">Kentucky State Fair</a>. The "Lexington Herald-Leader" speculated that Farmer could run for governor, <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20of%20Kentucky">secretary of state</a>, or lieutenant governor on a ticket with Senate President David Williams. On September 1, 2010, Williams and Farmer announced that they would run as a ticket for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively.

Shortly after the announcement, Farmer began to face criticism for his use of state funds during <a href="Great%20Recession">difficult economic times</a> that resulted in <a href="austerity">austerity</a> measures in most state government agencies. One such criticism involved the attendance of Farmer and three aides at the Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture's 2010 annual meeting in <a href="Saint%20Croix%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">St. Croix</a> at a cost of $10,000. Another involved the approval of merit raises for eleven agriculture department employees in 2010 when workers in all other state government agencies received no <a href="cost%20of%20living">cost of living</a> salary increases and were required to take six unpaid <a href="furlough">furlough</a> days. A department spokesman said the employees had taken on responsibilities for multiple jobs left unfilled by attrition. "The thought process was that this was more cost-effective than hiring new people," the spokesman said. Every constitutional officer in the state also donated a day's salary to the state treasury or to a charity on each of the mandatory furlough days, but Farmer refused, saying he opposed the entire concept of furlough days for government workers. After significant public criticism, Farmer apologized and decided to donate six days' worth of his salary to charity.

Farmer was also criticized for his management of the agriculture department's vehicle fleet. Late in his first term, Farmer had removed the vehicles used by the Agriculture Department from the state fleet, opting to have department officials manage them separately. In 2010, the <a href="Bluegrass%20Institute%20for%20Public%20Policy%20Solutions">Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions</a>, a <a href="free%20market">free market</a> <a href="think%20tank">think tank</a>, criticized the department's management of the vehicles under its control, citing the frequency with which the department's vehicles were being replaced. The "Lexington Herald-Leader" noted in 2010 that the department's fleet had grown from 178 to 206 vehicles since 2007 while the state's fleet had shrunk by 5%, and that all but three of the department's vehicles were fewer than four years old. A department spokesman defended the moves, citing decreased maintenance costs and higher resale values of vehicles being replaced. The "Lexington Herald-Leader" noted that such incidents could undermine Williams and Farmer's traditional Republican message of the need for less government spending.

Farmer's wife Rebecca filed for divorce on April 5, 2011, claiming in court documents that she had no access to the family's finances except the salary she earned as a teacher's aide. On April 12, Farmer petitioned the court to dismiss his wife's divorce petition, contesting the idea that their marriage was irretrievably broken. The divorce proceedings were put on hold by mutual consent on May 26, 2011, but in a July 12 hearing, Farmer's wife asked that the judge schedule a trial date; the judge ordered mediation within 30 days instead. The mediation failed, and a trial date was set for November 22, shortly after the gubernatorial election. A second round of mediation shortly before the scheduled hearing resulted in a settlement between the parties; terms of the settlement were kept private.

In the Republican gubernatorial primary, the Williams-Farmer ticket defeated businessman <a href="Phil%20Moffett">Phil Moffett</a> and former <a href="Jefferson%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Jefferson County</a> Judge/Executive <a href="Bobbie%20Holsclaw">Bobbie Holsclaw</a>. Williams and Farmer had led in opinion polling throughout the entire campaign, and neither opposing slate was able to raise enough money to engage in statewide television advertising; despite this, Williams and Farmer received only 68,502 votes, 48.2% of those cast. Holsclaw won the voting in her home county of Jefferson, which contains the city of Louisville and is the state's most populous. Moffett, a <a href="Tea%20Party%20movement">Tea Party</a> favorite, carried the second most populous county, <a href="Fayette%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Fayette</a> (which contains Lexington), as well as heavily-populated <a href="Daviess%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Daviess</a>, <a href="McCracken%20County%2C%20Kentucky">McCracken</a>, and <a href="Warren%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Warren</a> counties, and several counties in Northern and Central Kentucky.

Questions about Farmer's use of taxpayer funds continued to dog him throughout the general election campaign. Democrats demanded that Farmer reimburse the state for hotel expenses charged to the state while Farmer was conducting outreach activities at the KHSAA state basketball tournament and the Kentucky State Fair, both located fewer than from his home. In May, the office of Democratic State Auditor <a href="Crit%20Luallen">Crit Luallen</a> notified the <a href="Internal%20Revenue%20Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> that Farmer had failed to report personal use of his state vehicle as income. A spokesman for Farmer's office said that the personal mileage had been tracked, but a department employee had failed to forward it to the state Personnel Cabinet for reporting; he added that Farmer would file amended tax documents and have deductions taken from his wages to settle the tax liability. The state Democratic Party filed an ethics complaint against Farmer in September based on an anonymous email sent to the Personnel Cabinet claiming that, after work hours, Farmer directed an agriculture department employee to purchase a small refrigerator with state funds and deliver it to Farmer's house. A department spokesman said Farmer spent a substantial amount of time working from a home office in 2010 due to a back injury and that the refrigerator had been moved to department offices in 2011.

Beshear and Abramson easily defeated Farmer and Williams, carrying 90 of <a href="List%20of%20counties%20in%20Kentucky">Kentucky's 120 counties</a>. Days later, the "Lexington Herald-Leader" reported that Farmer had placed his girlfriend in a non-merit agriculture department job on October 31, 2011. Williams confirmed that the woman was Farmer's girlfriend, but denied knowledge that she had been put on the state payroll. Farmer defended the hiring, saying his girlfriend was qualified for the job, which involved administrative and clerical tasks, and that his legal team had assured him that he had followed all appropriate hiring regulations. Farmer's successor, Republican <a href="James%20Comer%20%28politician%29">James Comer</a>, fired Farmer's girlfriend a day after being sworn into office.

Five days after Farmer left office, Comer announced that he had requested a full audit of the department by newly elected Democratic State Auditor <a href="Adam%20Edelen">Adam Edelen</a>. Among the items Comer asked Edelen to investigate were 171 items of missing agriculture department property valued at about $334,000 and another 103 items worth about $146,000 that were supposed to be returned to the state as surplus but could not be accounted for. A week later, Farmer returned some of the missing items.

Comer and Edelen released the report on their joint probe on April 30, 2012. It detailed a "toxic culture of entitlement" in the agriculture department under Farmer, charging that he had required state employees to conduct personal errands while on the clock, failed to report gifts in excess of $200 as required by state ethics laws, and signed timesheets authorizing payment to friends in the department – including his girlfriend – who had performed very little if any work. Edelen confirmed that his investigation indicated that laws had been broken, and the report was turned over to the state attorney general for investigation. Minutes after the report was released, Farmer's lawyer made a public statement in which he opined, "I don't see anything in this audit report that any law-enforcement agency is going to be excited about." He conceded that Farmer had declined to be interviewed during the investigation but felt it was unfair that Farmer was not given a chance to review or comment on the final report prior to its release.

A week after the audit results were released, Kentucky's Executive Branch Ethics Commission reported that Farmer was the only constitutional officer who had failed to file a required disclosure of his 2011 finances by the required April 16 deadline. Farmer's attorney said the omission was "simply a matter of oversight on Richie's part given with [sic] what all has been going on." Days later, First National Bank of Manchester filed a foreclosure suit against Farmer, alleging that no payments had been made on his $300,000 home mortgage since January 2012. Under terms of his pending divorce, Farmer was solely responsible for the mortgage on the house. The divorce was finalized in July, and on September 24, 2012, the house was sold at auction after Farmer was not successful in selling it himself. Earlier that week, a judge denied Farmer's request to reduce his <a href="child%20support">child support</a> payments, which were based on his salary as agriculture commissioner. Farmer, who had not been employed since leaving office in January 2012, told the court that the investigation into his tenure as agriculture commissioner had made it difficult to find employment. The judge found that Farmer was "voluntarily underemployed", although he suspended the child support payments for the months of September and October 2012 in light of Farmer's recovery from an August 30 <a href="hip%20replacement">hip replacement</a> surgery. On November 9, 2012, the "Lexington Herald-Leader" reported that Farmer had found employment at a car dealership in Manchester.

On March 18, 2013, the Kentucky Executive Branch Ethics Commission charged Farmer with 42 state ethics violations, the most ever registered against a single individual; the previous high was 16. Most of the charges against him stemmed from the previous year's auditor's report, but previously unreported charges included conspiring with his sister Rhonda, who was also charged, to falsify records submitted to Rhonda's employer, the Registry of Election Finance. Farmer's girlfriend was also charged for falsifying timesheets. These charges were followed by five indictments by a federal <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> on April 19, 2013, alleging four counts of converting state funds and property to personal use and one count of soliciting a bribe in exchange for a state grant. U.S. Attorney Kerry B. Harvey said a federal investigation revealed that Farmer had created jobs in the department for his friends and girlfriend, who conducted personal errands for Farmer – including "building a basketball court for Farmer, placing flooring in Farmer's attic and organizing Farmer's personal effects" – while on the clock. He also said that Farmer had kept some of the gifts ordered in conjunction with the 2008 Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture conference for his own use and allowed his family to stay in hotel rooms reserved for agriculture department employees at the Kentucky State Fair. The indictment did not specify what bribe was sought in exchange for a grant to conduct an <a href="all-terrain%20vehicle">all-terrain vehicle</a> safety class, but the charges from the state Ethics Commission mentioned that Farmer had received three all-terrain vehicles in exchange for awarding unspecified state grants. A "Lexington Herald-Leader" report noted that the indictment only included events from 2008 forward because the <a href="statute%20of%20limitation">statute of limitation</a>s had expired for any actions prior to 2008.

Farmer <a href="plea">pled</a> not guilty to all five federal charges on April 25, 2013. He was released on his own <a href="recognizance">recognizance</a>, and his trial date was set for July 2. <a href="United%20States%20magistrate%20judge">U.S. Magistrate</a> Robert Wier denied Farmer's request to leave the country in May to celebrate his girlfriend's 40th birthday in <a href="Canc%C3%BAn">Cancún</a>, <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>. Wier also ordered the recently unemployed Farmer to seek employment, surrender his <a href="passport">passport</a>, and remain within the state until the trial. In response to Farmer's lawyer's request to delay the trial until February 2014 – a request the prosecution called "excessive" – Judge <a href="Gregory%20Frederick%20Van%20Tatenhove">Gregory Van Tatenhove</a> rescheduled the trial for October 22.

On September 5, 2013, Farmer's attorney filed a motion to allow Farmer to change his plea to guilty and announced that Farmer had reached a <a href="plea%20bargain">plea bargain</a> to settle all federal and state charges against him. Farmer would have faced maximum penalties of $250,000 and 10 years in prison for each federal charge against him. Instead, in exchange for his guilty plea, prosecutors agreed to pursue a sentence of 21 to 27 months in federal prison and $120,500 in <a href="restitution">restitution</a> of the $450,000 Farmer was accused of misappropriating. Additionally, Farmer pleaded guilty to one state charge of violating campaign finance laws in exchange for a sentence of no more than one year, served concurrently with his federal sentence. Finally, Farmer acknowledged to the Executive Branch Ethics Commission 35 of the 42 violations he had been charged with, resulting in $65,000 in fines, the most ever levied by the commission. Farmer's attorney indicated that U.S. Attorney Kerry Harvey and <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Kentucky">Kentucky Attorney General</a> <a href="Jack%20Conway%20%28politician%29">Jack Conway</a> had been pursuing additional indictments against Farmer when the plea bargain was reached. Although still restricted from leaving the state, Farmer was allowed to remain free pending sentencing.

Van Tatenhove sentenced Farmer to 27 months in federal prison on January 14, 2014. He recommended that the sentence be served at the <a href="Federal%20Correctional%20Institution%2C%20Manchester">Federal Correctional Institution in Manchester</a>, Farmer's hometown, but the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Prisons">Federal Bureau of Prisons</a> opted to assign him to the <a href="United%20States%20Penitentiary%2C%20Hazelton">United States Penitentiary, Hazelton</a> near <a href="Bruceton%20Mills%2C%20West%20Virginia">Bruceton Mills, West Virginia</a>. The "Lexington Herald-Leader" noted that Farmer's inmate number, 16226-032, was reminiscent of his college jersey number, 32.

Originally scheduled to report to prison on March 18, Farmer was granted a one-week delay by Van Tatenhove to watch his son, Trey, play for Clay County High School in the KHSAA basketball tournament. Clay County lost that game to <a href="Covington%20Catholic%20High%20School">Covington Catholic High School</a> 80-78 in the first round of the tournament. Van Tatenhove insisted that he granted the delay in deference to the Farmer family, not as a special favor for Farmer himself. On March 25, 2014, Farmer reported to the satellite camp of the Hazelton prison to begin serving his sentence. He was imprisoned for almost 20 months, transitioned to a <a href="halfway%20house">halfway house</a> in Lexington on December 18, 2015, and was released on January 21, 2016.

In May 2016, Farmer filed for <a href="Chapter%207%2C%20Title%2011%2C%20United%20States%20Code">Chapter 7 bankruptcy</a>. His petition stated that he was unemployed and owed $385,745 in debts – including $120,000 in restitution to the state and $15,000 in <a href="child%20support">child support</a> that are ineligible for bankruptcy forgiveness – against $24,259 in assets. He was reportedly renting a home in Clay County from his parents and driving a car they owned. On March 22, 2018, Farmer was arrested in <a href="Laurel%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Laurel County, Kentucky</a>, for <a href="driving%20under%20the%20influence">driving under the influence</a>.

Gold dollar

The gold dollar or gold one-dollar piece is a <a href="gold%20coin">gold coin</a> that was struck as a regular issue by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> from 1849 to 1889. The coin had three types over its lifetime, all designed by Mint Chief Engraver <a href="James%20B.%20Longacre">James B. Longacre</a>. The Type 1 issue has the smallest diameter of any United States coin minted to date.

A gold <a href="Dollar%20coin%20%28United%20States%29">dollar coin</a> had been proposed several times in the 1830s and 1840s, but was not initially adopted. <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> was finally galvanized into action by the increased supply of <a href="bullion">bullion</a> caused by the <a href="California%20gold%20rush">California gold rush</a>, and in 1849 authorized a gold dollar. In its early years, silver coins were being hoarded or exported, and the gold dollar found a ready place in commerce. Silver again circulated after Congress in 1853 required that new coins of that metal be made lighter, and the gold dollar became a rarity in commerce even before federal coins vanished from circulation because of the economic disruption caused by the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>.

Gold did not again circulate in most of the nation until 1879; once it did, the gold dollar did not regain its place. In its final years, it was struck in small numbers, causing speculation by hoarders. It was also in demand to be mounted in jewelry. The regular issue gold dollar was last struck in 1889; the following year, Congress ended the series.

Damaged common date gold dollars tend to be worth anywhere from melt value to about $110 USD (as of 2017); common dates of higher circulated grades sell for about $200 USD while rarer coins in high grades can be worth up to many thousands.

In proposing his plan for a mint and a coinage system, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a> <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> in 1791 proposed that the <a href="dollar%20coin%20%28United%20States%29">one-dollar denomination</a> be struck both as a gold coin, and as one of silver, representative of the two metals which he proposed be made <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a>. Congress followed Hamilton's recommendation only in part, authorizing a silver dollar, but no coin of that denomination in gold.

In 1831, the first gold dollar was minted, at the private mint of <a href="Christopher%20Bechtler">Christopher Bechtler</a> in North Carolina. Much of the gold then being produced in the United States came from the mountains of North Carolina and Georgia, and the dollars and other small gold coins issued by Bechtler circulated through that region, and were now and then seen further away. Additional one-dollar pieces were struck by August Bechtler, Christopher's son.

Soon after the Bechtlers began to strike their private issues, Secretary of the Treasury <a href="Levi%20Woodbury">Levi Woodbury</a> became an advocate of having the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Mint of the United States</a> ("Mint", when described as an institution) strike the one-dollar denomination in gold. He was opposed by the <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Mint Director</a>, <a href="Robert%20Maskell%20Patterson">Robert M. Patterson</a>. Woodbury persuaded President <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> to have <a href="pattern%20coin">pattern coin</a>s struck. In response, Patterson had Mint Second Engraver <a href="Christian%20Gobrecht">Christian Gobrecht</a> break off work on <a href="Gobrecht%20dollar">the new design</a> for the silver one-dollar coin and work on a pattern for the gold dollar. Gobrecht's design featured a <a href="pileus%20%28hat%29">Liberty cap</a> surrounded by rays on one side, and a palm branch arranged in a circle with the denomination, date, and name of the country on the other.

Consideration was given to including the gold dollar as an authorized denomination in the revisionary legislation that became the <a href="Mint%20Act%20of%201837">Mint Act of 1837</a>. The Philadelphia newspaper "<a href="Public%20Ledger%20%28Philadelphia%29">Public Ledger</a>", in December 1836, supported a gold dollar, stating that "the dollar is the smallest gold coin that would be convenient, and as it would be eminently so, neither silver nor paper should be allowed to take its place." Nevertheless, after Mint Director Patterson appeared before a congressional committee, the provision authorizing the gold dollar was deleted from the bill.

In January 1844, North Carolina Representative <a href="James%20Iver%20McKay">James Iver McKay</a>, the chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Ways%20and%20Means">Committee on Ways and Means</a>, solicited the views of Director Patterson on the gold dollar. Patterson had more of Gobrecht's pattern dollar struck to show to committee members, again advising against a coin that if issued would be only about a half inch (13 mm) in diameter. He told Treasury Secretary <a href="John%20C.%20Spencer">John C. Spencer</a> that the only gold coins of that size in commerce, the Spanish and Colombian half-escudos, were unpopular and had not been struck for more than twenty years. This seemed to satisfy the committee as nothing more was done for the time, and when a gold dollar was proposed again in 1846, McKay's committee recommended against it.

Even before 1848, record amounts of gold were flowing to American mints to be struck into coin, but the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a> vastly increased these quantities. This renewed calls for a gold dollar, as well as for a higher denomination than the <a href="eagle%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">eagle</a> ($10 piece), then the largest gold coin. In January 1849, McKay introduced a bill for a gold dollar, which was referred to his committee. There was much discussion in the press about the proposed coin; one newspaper published a proposal for an <a href="wiktionary%3AAnnular">annular</a> gold dollar; that is, with a hole in the middle to increase its small diameter. McKay amended his legislation to provide for a <a href="double%20eagle">double eagle</a> ($20 gold coin) and wrote to Patterson, who replied stating that the annular gold dollar would not work, and neither would another proposal to have dollar piece consisting of a gold plug in a silver coin. Nevertheless, Gobrecht's successor as chief engraver, <a href="James%20B.%20Longacre">James B. Longacre</a>, prepared patterns, including some with a square hole in the middle.

McKay got his fellow Democrat, New Hampshire Senator <a href="Charles%20G.%20Atherton">Charles Atherton</a>, to introduce the bill to authorize the gold dollar and the double eagle in the Senate on February 1, 1849—Atherton was chairman of the <a href="Senate%20Finance%20Committee">Senate Finance Committee</a>. McKay introduced a version into the House on February 20; debate began the same day. The dollar was attacked by congressmen from the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a>, then in the minority, on the grounds that it would be too small, would be counterfeited and in bad light might be mistakenly spent as a <a href="half%20dime">half dime</a>, the coins being similar in size. McKay did not respond substantively, but stated that if no one wanted these denominations, they would not be called for at the Mint, and would not be coined. Pennsylvania Representative <a href="Joseph%20Ingersoll">Joseph Ingersoll</a>, a Whig, spoke against the bill, noting that Patterson opposed the new denominations, and that the idea had been repeatedly turned down, whenever considered. Another Whig, Massachusetts's <a href="Charles%20Hudson%20%28Massachusetts%29">Charles Hudson</a>, related that Patterson had sent a real and a counterfeit gold dollar to his committee and the majority of members had been unable to tell the difference. McKay made no answer to these claims, but others did, including New York Congressman <a href="Henry%20Nicoll%20%28politician%29">Henry Nicoll</a>, who assured the House that the counterfeiting allegations were greatly exaggerated. The point was, he indicated, that the double eagle and gold dollar were wanted by the public, and, in the case of the gold dollar could help money circulate in small communities where banknotes were not accepted. Connecticut Representative <a href="John%20A.%20Rockwell">John A. Rockwell</a>, a Whig, tried to <a href="table%20%28parliamentary%20procedure%29">table</a> the bill, but his motion was defeated. The bill passed easily, and met only minimal opposition in the Senate, becoming law on March 3, 1849.

The officers at the Philadelphia Mint, including Chief Coiner <a href="Franklin%20Peale">Franklin Peale</a>, were mostly the friends and relations of Director Patterson. The outsider in their midst was Chief Engraver <a href="James%20B.%20Longacre">James B. Longacre</a>, successor to Gobrecht (who had died in 1844). A former copper-plate engraver, Longacre had been appointed through the political influence of South Carolina Senator <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a>.

When Longacre began work on the two new coins in early 1849, he had no one to assist him. Longacre wrote the following year that he had been warned by a Mint employee that one of the officers (undoubtedly Peale) planned to undermine the chief engraver's position by having the work of preparing designs and dies done outside Mint premises. Accordingly, when the gold coin bill became law, Longacre apprised Patterson that he was ready to begin work on the gold dollar. The Mint Director agreed, and after viewing a model of the head on the obverse, authorized Longacre to proceed with preparation of dies. According to Longacre,

The Type 1 gold dollar depicts a head of <a href="Liberty%20%28goddess%29">Liberty</a>, facing left, with a coronet or tiara on her head bearing her name. Her hair is gathered in a bun; she is surrounded by 13 stars representing the original states. The reverse features the date and denomination within a wreath, with the name of the nation near the rim.

Contemporary reviews of the Type 1 design were generally favorable. The "New York Weekly Tribune" on May 19, 1849 described the new dollar as "undoubtedly the neatest, tiniest, lightest, coin in this country ... it is too delicate and beautiful to pay out for potatoes, and sauerkraut, and salt pork. Oberon might have paid Puck with it for bringing the blossom which bewitched Titania." "Willis' Bank Note List" stated that "there is no probability of them ever getting into general circulation; they are altogether too small." The "North Carolina Standard" hoped that they would be struck at the <a href="Charlotte%20Mint">Charlotte Mint</a> and circulated locally to eliminate the problem of small-denomination bank notes from out of state. Coin dealer and numismatic author <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> notes that the head of Liberty on the Type 1 dollar is a scaled-down version of that on the double eagle, and "a nicely preserved gold dollar is beautiful to behold".

Mint records indicate the first gold dollars were produced on May 7, 1849; Longacre's diary notes state instead that the first were struck on May 8. A few coins in <a href="proof%20coin">proof condition</a> were struck on the first day, along with about 1,000 for circulation. There are five major <a href="Numismatic%20terminology%23V">varieties</a> of the 1849 gold dollar from Philadelphia, made as Longacre continued to fine-tune the design. Mintmarked <a href="coin%20die">dies</a> were sent by Longacre's Engraving Department at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> to the branch mints at Charlotte, <a href="Dahlonega%20Mint">Dahlonega</a> (in Georgia), and <a href="New%20Orleans%20Mint">New Orleans</a>; coins struck at the branches resemble some of the types issued from Philadelphia, depending on when the dies were produced. Of the coins struck at the branch mints in 1849, only pieces struck at Charlotte (1849-C) exist in multiple varieties; most are of what is dubbed the "Closed Wreath" variety. Approximately five of the 1849-C Open Wreath are known; one, believed the finest surviving specimen, sold at auction for $690,000 in 2004, remaining a record for the gold dollar series as of 2013. One of the changes made during production was the inclusion of Longacre's initial "L" on the truncation of Liberty's neck, the first time a U.S. coin intended for full-scale production had borne the initial of its designer. All issues beginning in 1850 bear the Closed Wreath. Beginning in 1854, the gold dollar was also struck at the new <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a>.

The continued flow of gold from California made silver expensive in terms of gold, and U.S. silver coins began to flow out of the country for melting in 1849, a flow that accelerated over the next several years as the price of the metal continued to rise. By 1853, a thousand dollars in silver coin contained $1,042 worth of bullion. As silver coins vanished, the gold dollar became the only federal coin in circulation between the <a href="Large%20cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">cent</a> and the <a href="quarter%20eagle">quarter eagle</a> ($2.50 piece). As such, it was struck in large numbers and widely circulated. According to Bowers in his book on the denomination, "the years 1850 to 1853 were the high-water mark of the gold dollar, the glory years of the denomination when the little gold coins took the place of half dollars and silver dollars in everyday transactions." This time came to an end in 1853 when Congress passed an act reducing the weight of most silver coins, allowing new issues of them to circulate.

As early as 1851, New York Congressman <a href="William%20Duer%20%28U.S.%20Congressman%29">William Duer</a> alleged that Patterson had made the gold dollar too small in diameter on purpose to provoke criticism. Patterson retired that year after 16 years in his position, and under his successor, <a href="George%20N.%20Eckert">George N. Eckert</a>, annular gold dollar and half dollar patterns were struck. "Public Ledger" reported that although gold dollars would not be struck in annular form, gold half dollars would be, to help fill the need for change. With the new <a href="Presidency%20of%20Franklin%20Pierce">Pierce administration</a>, <a href="Thomas%20M.%20Pettit">Thomas M. Pettit</a> took office as Mint Director on March 31, 1853. In April, Treasury Secretary <a href="James%20Guthrie%20%28Kentucky%29">James Guthrie</a> wrote to Pettit that there were complaints that the gold dollar was too small, often lost or mistaken for a small silver coin, and enquired about reports that the Mint had experimented with annular dollars. Pettit replied, stating that none had been preserved, but enclosed a silver piece of equivalent size. He noted that while there would be technical difficulties in the production of the annular dollar, these could be overcome. In a letter dated May 10, Pettit proposed an oval-shaped holed piece, or an angular-shaped coin, which would lessen the production problems. Pettit died suddenly on May 31; Guthrie did not let the issue fall, but queried Pettit's replacement, <a href="James%20Ross%20Snowden">James Ross Snowden</a>, concerning the issue on June 7. As U.S. coins were required to bear some device emblematic of liberty, the secretary hoped that artists could be found who could find some such design for an annular coin.
The Act of February 21, 1853, that had lightened the silver coins also authorized a gold <a href="three-dollar%20piece">three-dollar piece</a>, which began to be produced in 1854. To ensure that the three-dollar piece was not mistaken for other gold coins, it had been made thinner and wider than it would normally be, and Longacre put a distinctive design with an <a href="Indian%20princess">Indian princess</a> on it. Longacre adapted both the technique and the design for the gold dollar, which was made thinner, and thus wider. An adaptation of Longacre's princess for the larger gold coin was placed on the dollar, and a similar agricultural wreath on the reverse. The idea of making the gold dollar larger in this way had been suggested in Congress as early as 1852, and had been advocated by Pettit, but Guthrie's desire for an annular coin stalled the matter. In May 1854, Snowden sent Guthrie a letter stating that the difficulties with an annular coin, especially in getting the coins to eject properly from the press, were more than trivial.

Nevertheless, the Type 2 gold dollar (as it came to be known) proved unsatisfactory as the mints had difficulty in striking the new coin so that all details were brought out. This was due to the high relief of the design—the three Southern branch mints especially had trouble with the piece. Many of the Type 2 pieces quickly became illegible, and were sent back to Philadelphia for melting and recoinage. On most surviving specimens, the "85" in the date is not fully detailed. The Type 2 gold dollar was struck only at Philadelphia in 1854 and 1855, at the three Southern branch mints in the latter year, and at San Francisco in 1856, after the design was designated for replacement. To correct the problems, Longacre enlarged the head of Liberty, making it a scaled-down version of the three-dollar piece, and moved the lettering on the obverse closer to the rim. This improved the metal flow and design sharpness so much that early numismatic scholars assumed the reverse was also altered, though in fact no change was made and the Type 2 and Type 3 reverses are identical.

The Type 2 and 3 gold dollars depict Liberty as a Native American princess, with a fanciful feathered headdress not resembling any worn by any Indian tribe. This image is an inexact copy of the design Longacre had made for the three-dollar piece, and is one of a number of versions of Liberty that Longacre created based on the "Venus Accroupie" or "Crouching Venus", a sculpture then on display in a Philadelphia museum. For the reverse, Longacre adapted the "agricultural wreath" he had created for the reverse of the three-dollar piece, composed of cotton, corn, tobacco, and wheat, blending the produce of North and South. This wreath would appear, later in the 1850s, on the <a href="Flying%20Eagle%20cent">Flying Eagle cent</a>.

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> deprecated the Indian princess design used by Longacre for the obverses of the Types 2 and 3 gold dollar, and for the three-dollar piece, "the 'princess' of the gold coins is a banknote engraver's elegant version of folk art of the 1850s. The plumes or feathers are more like the crest of the Prince of Wales than anything that saw the Western frontiers, save perhaps on a music hall beauty."

The gold dollar continued to be produced in the late 1850s, though mintages declined from the figures of two million or more each year between 1850 and 1854. Only about 51,000 gold dollars were produced in 1860, with over two-thirds of that figure at Philadelphia, just under a third at San Francisco, and 1,566 at Dahlonega. Roughly a hundred are known of the last, creating one of the great rarities from Dahlonega in the series.
The other candidate for the rarest from that mint is the 1861-D, with an estimated mintage of 1,000 and perhaps 45 to 60 known. Two pairs of dies were shipped from Philadelphia to Dahlonega on December 10, 1860; they arrived on January 7, 1861, two weeks before Georgia voted to secede from the Union, as the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> began. Under orders from Governor <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Brown">Joseph E. Brown</a>, state militia secured the mint, and at some point, small quantities of dollars and <a href="half%20eagle">half eagle</a>s were produced. Records of how many coins were struck and when have not survived. Since dies crack in time, and all the mints were supplied with them from Philadelphia, coining could not last, and in May 1861, coins and supplies remaining at Dahlonega were turned over to the treasury of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>, which Georgia had by then joined. Gold coins with a total <a href="face%20value">face value</a> of $6 were put aside for assay. Normally, they would have been sent to Philadelphia to await the following year's meeting of the <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">United States Assay Commission</a>, when they would be available for testing. Instead, these were sent to the initial Confederate capital of <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery, Alabama</a>, though what was done with them there, and their ultimate fate, are unknown. The rarity of the 1861-D dollar, and the association with the Confederacy, make it especially prized.

Dahlonega, like the other two branch mints in the South, closed its doors after the 1861 strikings. It and the Charlotte facility never reopened; the New Orleans Mint again struck coins from 1879 to 1909, but did not strike gold dollars again. After 1861, the only issuance of gold dollars outside Philadelphia was at San Francisco, in 1870.

The outbreak of the Civil War shook public confidence in the Union, and citizens began hoarding <a href="commodity%20money">specie</a>, gold and silver coins. In late December 1861, banks and then the federal Treasury stopped paying out gold at face value. By mid-1862, all federal coins, even the base metal cent, had vanished from commerce in much of the country. The exception was the Far West, where for the most part, only gold and silver were acceptable currencies, and paper money traded at a discount. In the rest of the nation, gold and silver coins could be purchased from banks, exchange agents, and from the Treasury for a premium in the new <a href="United%20States%20Note">greenbacks</a> the government began to issue to fill the gap in commerce and finance the war.

Since gold did not circulate in the United States (except on the West Coast) in the <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">postwar period</a>, much of the production of coins of that metal in the United States was double eagles for export. Accordingly, although 1,361,355 gold dollars were struck in 1862—the last time production would exceed a million—the mintage fell to 6,200 in 1863 and remained low for the rest of the coin's existence, excepting 1873 and 1874. The Mint felt it improper to suspend coinage of a coin authorized by Congress, and issued <a href="proof%20coinage">proof coins</a> (generally a few dozen to the tiny numismatic community) from specially-polished dies, also producing enough circulation strikes so that the proof coins would not be unduly rare. In 1873 and 1874, old and worn gold dollars held by the government were melted and recoined, generating large mintages of that denomination. This was done in anticipation of the <a href="Specie%20Payment%20Resumption%20Act">resumption of specie payments</a>, which did not occur until the end of 1878. Once specie again circulated at face value, the gold dollar found no place in commerce amid large quantities of silver coinage, either released from hoarding or newly struck by the Mint. The government expected that the resumption of specie payments would cause the dollar and other small gold coins to circulate again, but the public, allowed to redeem paper currency, continued to use it as more convenient than coins.

In the 1870s and 1880s, public interest grew in the low-mintage gold dollar. Collecting coins was becoming more popular, and a number of numismatists put aside some gold dollars and hoped for increases in value. The Mint most likely channeled its production through some favored Philadelphia dealers, though proof coins could be purchased for $1.25 at the cashier's window at the Philadelphia facility. Banks charged a premium for circulation strikes. They were popular in the jewelry trade, mounted into various items. The coins were often exported to China or Japan, where such jewelry was made. The dollars were often damaged in the process; the Mint refused to sell into this trade and did its best to hinder it. Nevertheless, Mint officials concluded that jewelers were successful at getting the majority of each issue. Proof mintages exceeded 1,000 by 1884, and remained above that mark for the remainder of the series, numbers likely inflated by agents of jewelers, willing to pay the Mint's premium of $.25 per coin. Another use for the gold dollar was as a holiday gift; after its abolition the <a href="quarter%20eagle">quarter eagle</a> became a popular present.

<a href="James%20Pollock">James Pollock</a>, in his final report as Mint Director in 1873, advocated limiting striking of gold dollars to depositors who specifically requested it. "The gold dollar is not a convenient coin, on account of its small size, and it suffers more proportionately from abrasion than larger coins." His successors called for its abolition, with <a href="James%20P.%20Kimball">James P. Kimball</a>, before he left office in 1889, writing to Congress that except as jewelry, "little practical use has been found for this coin". Later that year, the new director, <a href="Edward%20O.%20Leech">Edward O. Leech</a>, issued a report stating that the gold dollar "is too small for circulation, and ... [is] used almost exclusively for the purposes of ornament. The last year in which the gold dollar was struck was 1889. Congress abolished the gold dollar, along with the <a href="three-cent%20nickel">three-cent nickel</a> and three-dollar piece, by the Act of September 26, 1890.

A total of 19,499,337 gold dollars were coined, of which 18,223,438 were struck at Philadelphia, 1,004,000 at New Orleans, 109,138 at Charlotte, 90,232 at San Francisco and 72,529 at <a href="Dahlonega%20Mint">Dahlonega</a>. According to an advertisement in the February 1899 issue of "<a href="The%20Numismatist">The Numismatist</a>", gold dollars brought $1.80 each, still in demand as a birthday present and for jewelry. That journal in 1905 carried news of a customer depositing 100 gold dollars into a bank; the teller, aware of the value, credited the account with $1.60 per coin. In 1908, a dealer offered $2 each for any quantity. As coin collecting became a widespread pastime in the early 20th century, gold dollars became a popular specialty, a status they retain. The 2014 edition of <a href="R.S.%20Yeoman">R.S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" rates the least expensive gold dollar in <a href="coin%20grading">very fine</a> condition (VF-20) at $300, a value given for each of the Type 1 Philadelphia issues from 1849 to 1853. Those seeking one of each type will find the most expensive to be a specimen of the Type 2, with the 1854 and 1855 estimated at $350 in that condition; the other two types have dates valued at $300 in that grade.

The gold dollar had a brief resurrection during the period of <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">Early United States commemorative coins</a>. Between 1903 and 1922 nine different issues were produced, with a total mintage of 99,799. These were minted for various public events, did not circulate, and none used Longacre's design.

Euryoryzomys emmonsae

Euryoryzomys emmonsae, also known as Emmons' rice rat or Emmons' oryzomys, is a <a href="rodent">rodent</a> from the <a href="Amazon%20rainforest">Amazon rainforest</a> of Brazil in the genus "<a href="Euryoryzomys">Euryoryzomys</a>" of the family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a>. Initially misidentified as "<a href="Euryoryzomys%20macconnelli">E. macconnelli</a>" or "<a href="Euryoryzomys%20nitidus">E. nitidus</a>", it was formally described in 1998. A rainforest species, it may be <a href="scansorial">scansorial</a>, climbing but also spending time on the ground. It lives only in a limited area south of the <a href="Amazon%20River">Amazon River</a> in the state of <a href="Par%C3%A1">Pará</a>, a distribution that is apparently unique among the <a href="muroid">muroid</a> rodents of the region.

"Euryoryzomys emmonsae" is a relatively large <a href="rice%20rat">rice rat</a>, weighing , with a distinctly long tail and relatively long, tawny brown fur. The skull is slender and the <a href="incisive%20foramen">incisive foramina</a> (openings in the bone of the <a href="palate">palate</a>) are broad. The animal has 80 <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s and its <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a> is similar to that of other "Euryoryzomys". Its <a href="conservation%20status">conservation status</a> is assessed as "<a href="Data%20Deficient">Data Deficient</a>", but <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a> may pose a threat to this species.

In 1998, <a href="Guy%20Musser">Guy Musser</a>, Michael Carleton, Eric Brothers, and Alfred Gardner reviewed the <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> of species previously lumped under ""<a href="Oryzomys%20capito">Oryzomys capito</a>"" (now classified in the genera "<a href="Hylaeamys">Hylaeamys</a>", "<a href="Euryoryzomys">Euryoryzomys</a>", and "<a href="Transandinomys">Transandinomys</a>"). They described the new species "Oryzomys emmonsae" on the basis of 17 specimens from three locations in the state of <a href="Par%C3%A1">Pará</a> in northern Brazil; these animals had been previously identified as "Oryzomys macconnelli" (now "<a href="Euryoryzomys%20macconnelli">Euryoryzomys macconnelli</a>") and then as "Oryzomys nitidus" (now "<a href="Euryoryzomys%20nitidus">Euryoryzomys nitidus</a>"). The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> honors <a href="Louise%20H.%20Emmons">Louise H. Emmons</a>, who, among other contributions to Neotropical mammalogy, collected three of the known examples of the species in 1986, including the <a href="holotype">holotype</a>. The new species was placed in what they termed the ""Oryzomys nitidus" group", which also included "O. macconelli", "O. nitidus", and "<a href="Euryoryzomys%20russatus">O. russatus</a>".

In 2000, James Patton, <a href="Maria%20Nazareth%20F.%20da%20Silva">Maria da Silva</a>, and Jay Malcolm reported on mammals collected at the <a href="Rio%20Juru%C3%A1">Rio Juruá</a> in western Brazil. In this report, they provided further information on the "Oryzomys" species reviewed by Musser and colleagues, including <a href="DNA%20sequence">sequence</a> data from the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial</a> <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b"</a> gene. Their analysis reaffirmed that "O. emmonsae" was a distinct species and found that it was closest to "O. macconnelli" and "O. russatus", differing from both by about 12% in the cytochrome "b" sequence; "O. nitidus" was more distantly related, differing by 14.7%. The average sequence difference between the three "O. emmonsae" individuals studied was 0.8%.

In 2006, an extensive <a href="morphology%20%28anatomy%29">morphological</a> and <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetic</a> analysis by Marcelo Weksler showed that species then placed in the genus "<a href="Oryzomys">Oryzomys</a>" did not form a single, cohesive (<a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a>) group; for example, "O. macconnelli", "<a href="Euryoryzomys%20lamia">O. lamia</a>" (placed under "O. russatus" by Musser and colleagues) and "O. russatus" clustered together in a single natural group (<a href="clade">clade</a>), but were not closely related to the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of "Oryzomys", the <a href="marsh%20rice%20rat">marsh rice rat</a> ("O. palustris"). Later in 2006, Weksler and colleagues described several new genera to accommodate species previously placed in "Oryzomys", among which was "<a href="Euryoryzomys">Euryoryzomys</a>" for the ""O. nitidus" complex", including "O. emmonsae".

Thus, the species is now known as "Euryoryzomys emmonsae". As a species of "Euryoryzomys", it is classified within the <a href="tribe%20%28taxonomy%29">tribe</a> <a href="Oryzomyini">Oryzomyini</a> ("rice rats"), which includes over a hundred species, mainly from South and Central America. Oryzomyini in turn is part of the subfamily <a href="Sigmodontinae">Sigmodontinae</a> of family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a>, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.

"Euryoryzomys emmonsae" is a fairly large, long-tailed rice rat with long, soft fur. The hairs on the back are long. It generally resembles "E. nitidus" in these and other characters, but has a longer tail. "E. macconnelli" is slightly larger and has longer and duller fur. In "E. emmonsae", the upperparts are tawny brown, but a bit darker on the head because many hairs have black tips. The hairs of the underparts are gray at the bases and white at the tips; overall, the fur appears mostly white. In most specimens, there is a patch on the chest where the gray bases are absent. The longest of the <a href="vibrissa">vibrissa</a>e (whiskers) of the face extend slightly beyond the ears. The eyelids are black. The ears are covered with small, yellowish brown hairs and appear dark brown overall. The feet are covered with white hairs above and brown below. There are six <a href="Paw%23Common%20characteristics">pads</a> on the <a href="plantar">plantar</a> surface, but the <a href="hypothenar">hypothenar</a> is reduced. The <a href="ungual%20tufts">ungual tufts</a>, tufts of hair which surround the bases of the claws, are well-developed. The tail is like the body in color above, and mostly white below, but in the nearest the tail tip it is brown below.

Compared to "E. nitidus" and "E. macconnelli", the skull is relatively small and slender. It has broad and short <a href="incisive%20foramen">incisive foramina</a> (perforations of the <a href="palate">palate</a> between the <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s and the <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>) and lacks <a href="sphenopalatine%20vacuities">sphenopalatine vacuities</a> which perforate the <a href="mesopterygoid%20fossa">mesopterygoid fossa</a>, the gap behind the end of the palate. The animal is similar to other members of the genus in the pattern of the <a href="artery">arteries</a> of the head. The <a href="alisphenoid%20strut">alisphenoid strut</a>, an extension of the <a href="alisphenoid">alisphenoid</a> bone which separates two <a href="foramen">foramina</a> (openings) in the skull (the <a href="masticatory-buccinator%20foramen">masticatory-buccinator foramen</a> and the <a href="foramen%20ovale%20accessorium">foramen ovale accessorium</a>) is rarely present; its presence is more frequent in "E. nitidus". The <a href="capsular%20process">capsular process</a>, a raising of the bone of the <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw) behind the third molar, houses the back end of the lower incisor in most "Euryoryzomys", but is absent in "E. emmonsae" and "E. macconnelli". Traits of the teeth are similar to those of "E. nitidus" and other "Euryoryzomys".

The <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a> includes 80 <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s with a total of 86 major arms (2n = 80; <a href="karyotype%23Fundamental%20number">FN</a> = 86). The <a href="X%20chromosome">X chromosome</a> is <a href="centromere%23Subtelocentric">subtelocentric</a> (with one pair of long arms and one pair of short arms) and the <a href="Y%20chromosome">Y chromosome</a> is <a href="acrocentric">acrocentric</a> (with only one pair of arms, or with a minute second pair). Among the <a href="autosome">autosome</a>s (non-sex chromosomes), the four <a href="centromere%23Centromere%20positions">metacentric</a> or <a href="submetacentric">submetacentric</a> (with two pairs of arms as long as or not much shorter than the other) pairs of chromosomes are small, and the 35 pairs of acrocentrics range from large to small. Some of those have a minute second pair of arms and could also be classified as subtelocentric, which would raise FN to 90. This karyotype is similar to other known karyotypes of members of "Euryoryzomys".

In thirteen specimens measured by Musser, head and body length ranges from , tail length (12 specimens only) from , hindfoot length from , ear length (three specimens only) from , and body mass from .

The known distribution of "Euryoryzomys emmonsae" is limited to a portion of the Amazon rainforest south of the <a href="Amazon%20River">Amazon River</a> in the state of Pará, between the <a href="Rio%20Xingu">Xingu</a> and <a href="Rio%20Tocantins">Tocantins</a> rivers, but the limits of its range remain inadequately known. No other South American rainforest <a href="muroid">muroid</a> rodent is known to have a similar distribution. Musser and colleagues reported it from three locations and Patton and others added a fourth; in some of those it occurs together with "E. macconnelli" or "<a href="Hylaeamys%20megacephalus">Hylaeamys megacephalus</a>".

Specimens of "E. emmonsae" for which detailed habitat data are available were caught in "viny forest", a <a href="microhabitat">microhabitat</a> that often included much bamboo. All were captured on the ground, some in bamboo thickets and another under a log. Musser and colleagues speculated that "E. emmonsae" may be <a href="scansorial">scansorial</a>, spending time both on the ground and climbing in vegetation, like the similarly long-tailed rice rat "<a href="Cerradomys%20subflavus">Cerradomys subflavus</a>".

The <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> currently lists "Euryoryzomys emmonsae" as "<a href="Data%20Deficient">Data Deficient</a>" because it is so poorly known. It may be threatened by deforestation and logging, but occurs in at least one <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>, the <a href="Tapirap%C3%A9-Aquiri%20National%20Forest">Tapirapé-Aquiri National Forest</a>.

Lundomys

Lundomys molitor, also known as Lund's amphibious rat or the greater marsh rat, is a <a href="List%20of%20semiaquatic%20tetrapods">semiaquatic</a> rat <a href="species">species</a> from southeastern <a href="South%20America">South America</a>.

Its distribution is now restricted to <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> and nearby <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, but it previously ranged northward into <a href="Minas%20Gerais">Minas Gerais</a>, Brazil, and southward into eastern <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. The Argentine form may have been distinct from the living form from Brazil and Uruguay. "L. molitor" is a large <a href="rodent">rodent</a>, with the head and body length averaging , characterized by a long tail, large hindfeet, and long and dense fur. It builds nests above the water, supported by reeds, and it is not currently threatened.

Its external <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> is similar to that of "<a href="Holochilus%20brasiliensis">Holochilus brasiliensis</a>", and over the course of its complex <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history it has been confused with that species, but other features support its placement in a distinct <a href="genus">genus</a>, Lundomys. Within the family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a> and subfamily <a href="Sigmodontinae">Sigmodontinae</a>, it is a member of a group of specialized <a href="Oryzomyini">oryzomyine</a> rodents that also includes "<a href="Holochilus">Holochilus</a>", "<a href="Noronhomys">Noronhomys</a>", "<a href="Carletonomys">Carletonomys</a>", and "<a href="Pseudoryzomys">Pseudoryzomys</a>".

"Lundomys molitor" was first described in 1888 by Danish zoologist <a href="Herluf%20Winge">Herluf Winge</a>, who reviewed the materials <a href="Peter%20Wilhelm%20Lund">Peter Wilhelm Lund</a> had collected in the caves of <a href="Lagoa%20Santa%2C%20Minas%20Gerais">Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais</a>, Brazil. Winge used four specimens for his description, including two skull fragments and an isolated <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> (upper jaw) from the cave chamber Lapa da Escrivania Nr. 5 and a <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw) from Lapa da Serra das Abelhas, but the latter later turned out to be from a different species, probably "<a href="Gyldenstolpia%20fronto">Gyldenstolpia fronto</a>". Lund named the animal "Hesperomys molitor" and placed it in the same genus ("<a href="Hesperomys">Hesperomys</a>") as what is now "<a href="Pseudoryzomys">Pseudoryzomys simplex</a>" and two species of "<a href="Calomys">Calomys</a>". Subsequently, it was rarely mentioned in the literature on South American rodents; those authors who did mention it placed it in either "<a href="Oryzomys">Oryzomys</a>" or "Calomys".

In 1926, American zoologist Colin Campbell Sanborn collected some rodents in Uruguay, which he identified as "Holochilus vulpinus" (currently "Holochilus brasiliensis") in his 1929 report on the collection. When his successor at the <a href="Field%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Field Museum of Natural History</a>, <a href="Philip%20Hershkovitz">Philip Hershkovitz</a>, reviewed "Holochilus" in 1955, he recognized that the series from Uruguay contained two species, one close to the forms of "Holochilus" found across much of South America, and another unique to Uruguay and southern Brazil; he named the latter as a new species, "Holochilus magnus". Hershkovitz identified "Holochilus" as one of the members of a "sigmodont" group of American rodents, also including "<a href="cotton%20rat">Sigmodon</a>", "<a href="Reithrodon">Reithrodon</a>", and "<a href="Neotomys">Neotomys</a>", on the basis of its flat-crowned <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>, which are <a href="lophodont">lophodont</a> (the crown consists of transverse ridges). In 1981, "H. magnus" was also recognized in the <a href="Late%20Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a> of <a href="Buenos%20Aires%20Province">Buenos Aires Province</a>, Argentina, and in 1982 it was recorded from Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil.

In a 1980 article, Argentine zoologist Elio Massoia recognized the resemblance between Winge's "Hesperomys molitor" and Hershkovitz's "Holochilus magnus", and recommended that the former be reclassified as a species of "Holochilus", "Holochilus molitor". When American zoologists Voss and Carleton restudied Winge's material in a 1993 paper, they were unable to find any consistent differences between the two and accordingly considered them to pertain to the same species. In addition, they reviewed the differences between this species and other "Holochilus" and concluded that these were significant enough to place the former in a distinct genus, which they named "Lundomys" after Lund, who had collected the original material. Since then, the species has been known as "Lundomys molitor".

In the same paper in which they described "Lundomys", Voss and Carleton also, for the first time, diagnosed the tribe <a href="Oryzomyini">Oryzomyini</a> in a <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetically</a> valid way. Previously, Oryzomyini had been a somewhat loosely defined group defined among others by a long <a href="palate">palate</a> and the presence of a crest known as the <a href="mesoloph">mesoloph</a> on the upper molars and <a href="mesolophid">mesolophid</a> on the lower molars; this crest is absent or reduced in "Holochilus" and "Lundomys". Voss and Carleton recognized five <a href="synapomorphy">synapomorphies</a> for the group, all of which are shared by "Lundomys"; the placement in Oryzomyini of "Lundomys" and of three other genera—"Holochilus", "Pseudoryzomys", and "<a href="Zygodontomys">Zygodontomys</a>"—which also lack complete mesoloph(id)s has been universally supported since.

Voss and Carleton had found some support for a close relationship between "Holochilus", "Lundomys", and "Pseudoryzomys" within Oryzomyini. In subsequent years, the related species "<a href="Holochilus%20primigenus">Holochilus primigenus</a>" and "<a href="Noronhomys">Noronhomys vespuccii</a>" were discovered, providing additional evidence for this grouping. The allocation of the former, which is similar to "Lundomys" in features of the dentition, to "Holochilus" is controversial, and placement as a second species of "Lundomys" has been suggested as an alternative. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of oryzomyines by Marcelo Weksler, published in 2006, supported a close relationship among "Lundomys", "Holochilus", and "Pseudoryzomys"; the other species of the group were not included. Data from the sequence of the <a href="RBP3">IRBP</a> gene supported a closer relationship between "Holochilus" and "Pseudoryzomys", with "Lundomys" more distantly related, but <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> data placed "Holochilus" and "Lundomys" closer together, as did the combined analysis of both morphological and IRPB data. Subsequently, "<a href="Carletonomys">Carletonomys cailoi</a>" was described as an additional relative of "Holochilus" and "Lundomys".

"Lundomys molitor" is among the largest living oryzomyines, rivaled only by some large forms of "<a href="Holochilus">Holochilus</a>" and "<a href="Nectomys">Nectomys</a>", but it is substantially smaller than some of the recently extinct <a href="rodents%20of%20the%20Caribbean%23Leeward%20Islands">Antillean species</a>, such as ""<a href="Ekbletomys%20hypenemus">Ekbletomys hypenemus</a>"" and "<a href="Megalomys%20desmarestii">Megalomys desmarestii</a>". Unlike in "<a href="Holochilus%20brasiliensis">Holochilus brasiliensis</a>", which occurs in the same area, the tail is longer than the head and body. It is sparsely haired and dark, and there is no difference in color between the upper and lower side. The coat, which is long, dense, and soft, is yellow–brown at the sides, but becomes darker on the upperparts and lighter on the underparts. The large hindfeet are characterized by conspicuous <a href="interdigital%20webbing">interdigital webbing</a>, but they lack <a href="ungual%20tuft">tufts of hair</a> on the digits and several of the <a href="paw%23Common%20characteristics">pads</a> are reduced. As in some other semiaquatic oryzomyines, <a href="natatory%20fringe">fringes of hair</a> are present along the <a href="plantar">plantar</a> margins and between some of the digits. The forefeet also lack tufts on the digits and show very long claws, a character unique among oryzomyines. The female has four pairs of <a href="mammary%20gland">teats</a>, and the <a href="gallbladder">gall bladder</a> is absent, both important characters of oryzomyines. The head and body length is , averaging , the tail length is 195 to 255 mm (7.68 to 10.04 mm), averaging , and the length of the hindfoot is , averaging .

The front part of the skull is notably broad. As in "Holochilus", the <a href="zygomatic%20plate">zygomatic plate</a>, the flattened front portion of the <a href="zygomatic%20arch">cheek bone</a>, is expansive and produced into a spinous process at the anterior margin. The <a href="jugal">jugal</a> bone is small, but less reduced than in "Holochilus". The <a href="interorbital%20region">interorbital region</a> of the skull is narrow and flanked by high beads. The <a href="incisive%20foramen">incisive foramina</a>, which perforate the palate between the <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s and the upper molars, are long, extending between the molars. The palate itself is also long, extending beyond the posterior margin of the maxillary bones, and it is perforated near the third molars by conspicuous <a href="posterolateral%20palatal%20pit">posterolateral palatal pit</a>s. As in all oryzomyines, the <a href="squamosal">squamosal</a> bone lacks a suspensory process that contacts the <a href="tegmen%20tympani">tegmen tympani</a>, the roof of the <a href="tympanic%20cavity">tympanic cavity</a>, but "Lundomys" is unusual in that the squamosal and the tegmen tympani usually overlap when viewed from the side. In the mandible, the <a href="angular%20process">angular</a> and <a href="coronoid%20process%20of%20the%20mandible">coronoid processes</a> are less well-developed than in "Holochilus". The <a href="capsular%20process">capsular process</a> of the lower incisor, a slight raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, near the coronoid process, is small. The two <a href="masseteric%20ridge">masseteric ridge</a>s, to which some of the chewing muscles are attached, are entirely separate, joining only at their anterior edges, which are located below the first molar.

The molars are slightly more high-crowned (<a href="hypsodont">hypsodont</a>) than in most oryzomyines, and many of the accessory crests are reduced, but they are sharply distinct from the highly <a href="synapomorphy">derived</a>, hypsodont molars of "Holochilus". The main cusps are located opposite each other and have rounded edges. The enamel folds do not extend past the midlines of the molars. The mesoloph, an accessory crest on the upper molars that is usually well-developed in oryzomyines, is present but short on the first and second upper molar; it is much more reduced in "Holochilus" and "Pseudoryzomys". The corresponding structure on the lower molars, the mesolophid, is present on the first and second molars in "Lundomys", but absent in both "Holochilus" and "Pseudoryzomys". Another accessory crest, the <a href="anteroloph">anteroloph</a>, is present, though small, on the first upper molar in "Lundomys", but entirely absent in both other genera. As in "Holochilus" and "Pseudoryzomys", the anterior cusp on the first lower molar, the <a href="anteroconid">anteroconid</a>, contains a deep pit. Each of the three upper molars has three <a href="Dental%20anatomy%23Anatomic%20landmarks">roots</a>; unlike in both "Holochilus" and "Pseudoryzomys", the first upper molar lacks an accessory fourth root. The first lower molar has four roots, including two small accessory roots located between larger anterior and posterior roots. The second molar has either two or three roots, with the anterior root split into two smaller roots in some specimens.

The <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a> contains 52 <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s with a total of 58 major arms (2n = 52, <a href="Fundamental%20number">FN</a> = 58). The non-sex chromosomes (autosomes) are mostly <a href="acrocentric">acrocentric</a>, having a long and a short arm, or <a href="telocentric">telocentric</a>, having only one arm, but there are also three large <a href="centromere%23Metacentric">metacentric</a> pairs, which have two major arms, and a small metacentric pair. The <a href="Y%20chromosome">Y chromosome</a> is metacentric and the <a href="X%20chromosome">X chromosome</a> is variable, ranging from nearly metacentric to acrocentric in five specimens studied.

"Lundomys molitor" has been found as a living animal only in Uruguay and nearby <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a>; records of live specimens from eastern Argentina and Lagoa Santa, <a href="Minas%20Gerais">Minas Gerais</a>, have not been confirmed. It is rarely encountered, and has been collected in only one location in Rio Grande do Sul, but this may be due to insufficient efforts to locate it, rather than genuine rarity. Its distribution is generally limited to areas with mean winter temperatures over , mean annual temperatures over , annual rainfall over , and a long rainy season averaging over 200 days. It is usually found in swamps or near streams.

<a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> fossils have been found throughout its current range and beyond it. In Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul, the <a href="Lujanian">Lujanian</a> (Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene) <a href="Sopas%20Formation">Sopas Formation</a> has yielded remains of "L. molitor", in addition to such other mammals as the extinct saber-toothed cat "<a href="Smilodon%20populator">Smilodon populator</a>" and species of "<a href="Glyptodon">Glyptodon</a>", "<a href="Macrauchenia">Macrauchenia</a>", and "<a href="Toxodon">Toxodon</a>". The <a href="type%20locality%20%28biology%29">type locality</a>, Lagoa Santa, lies far northeast of the nearest record of live "L. molitor"; there, it is known only from three skull fragments from a cave known as Laga da Escrivania Nr. 5. This cave also contains numerous remains of members of the extinct South American <a href="megafauna">megafauna</a>, such as <a href="ground%20sloth">ground sloth</a>s, <a href="litopterna">litopterna</a>ns, <a href="gomphothere">gomphothere</a>s, and <a href="Glyptodontidae">glyptodonts</a>, in addition to 16 species of <a href="Cricetidae">cricetid</a> rodents, but it is not certain that all remains from this cave are from the same age.

Remains of "Lundomys" have been found at six Pleistocene localities in <a href="Buenos%20Aires%20Province">Buenos Aires Province</a>, Argentina, which suggests a warm and humid paleoclimate there. The oldest deposits, at <a href="Bajo%20San%20Jos%C3%A9">Bajo San José</a>, date to <a href="Marine%20Isotopic%20Stage%2011">Marine Isotopic Stage 11</a>, about 420,000 to 360,000 years ago, while younger specimens from other localities are as little as 30,000 years old. The younger Argentine "Lundomys" specimens are subtly distinct from living "Lundomys" in some features of the first lower molar and may represent a distinct species. One lower first molar of this form has length 3.28 mm. Because the Bajo San José material does not contain lower first molars, it is impossible to determine whether this material also pertains to the later Argentine "Lundomys" form. The morphology of the upper and lower jaw precludes an identification as "<a href="Holochilus%20primigenus">Holochilus primigenus</a>", a fossil species with molar traits almost identical to those of "Lundomys". The length of the upper toothrow of one specimen from this locality is and the length of the upper first molar is , slightly smaller than in living "Lundomys", which ranges from in four specimens

"Lundomys molitor" is semiaquatic in habits, spending much of its time in the water, and is active during the night. An excellent swimmer, it is even more specialized for swimming than is "Holochilus". It builds a spherical <a href="nest">nest</a> among reeds in up to deep water, usually about above the water. The material for the nest, which is in diameter and 9 to 11 cm (about 4 in) in height, comes from the surrounding reeds. Its wall consists of three layers, surrounding a central chamber, which is connected to the water by a ramp, also composed of reeds. Nests built by members of the related genus "Holochilus" are similar in many details. Several dissected <a href="stomach">stomach</a>s contained green plant material, suggesting that it is <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a>, like "Holochilus". A female caught in April was pregnant with three embryos, which were about long. The <a href="mite">mite</a>s "<a href="Gigantolaelaps%20wolffsohni">Gigantolaelaps wolffsohni</a>" and "<a href="Amblyomma%20dubitatum">Amblyomma dubitatum</a>" have been found on specimens of "L. molitor" in Uruguay. Other rodents found in association with it include "<a href="Scapteromys%20tumidus">Scapteromys tumidus</a>", "<a href="Oligoryzomys%20nigripes">Oligoryzomys nigripes</a>", "<a href="Reithrodon%20auritus">Reithrodon auritus</a>", "<a href="Akodon%20azarae">Akodon azarae</a>", "<a href="Oxymycterus%20nasutus">Oxymycterus nasutus</a>", and "Holochilus brasiliensis".

The species' conservation status is currently assessed as "least concern" by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>, reflecting a relatively wide distribution and the absence of evidence for a decline in populations. Several of the areas where it occurs are protected, but the <a href="habitat%20destruction">destruction of its habitat</a> may pose a threat to its continued existence.

Pseudoryzomys

Pseudoryzomys simplex, also known as the Brazilian false rice rat or false oryzomys, is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="rodent">rodent</a> in the family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a> from south-central <a href="List%20of%20mammals%20of%20South%20America">South America</a>. It is found in lowland <a href="Tropical%20and%20subtropical%20grasslands%2C%20savannas%2C%20and%20shrublands">palm savanna and thorn scrub</a> <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s. It is a medium-sized species, weighing about , with gray–brown fur, long and narrow hindfeet, and a tail that is about as long as the head and body. The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">IUCN</a> has assessed its conservation status as being of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>, although almost nothing is known about its diet or reproduction.

The <a href="monotypic">only species</a> in the <a href="genus">genus</a> Pseudoryzomys, its closest living relatives are the large rats "<a href="Holochilus">Holochilus</a>" and "<a href="Lundomys">Lundomys</a>", which are <a href="List%20of%20semiaquatic%20tetrapods">semiaquatic</a>, spending much of their time in the water. The three genera share several <a href="Character%20%28biology%29">characters</a>, including specializations towards a semiaquatic lifestyle, such as the presence of membranes between the digits (<a href="interdigital%20webbing">interdigital webbing</a>), and a reduction in the complexity of the <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a> crowns, both of which are at incipient stages in "Pseudoryzomys". Together, they form a unique assemblage within the <a href="Oryzomyini">oryzomyine</a> tribe, a very diverse group including over one hundred species, mainly in South America. This tribe is part of the subfamily <a href="Sigmodontinae">Sigmodontinae</a> and family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a>, which include many more species, mainly from Eurasia and the Americas. "Pseudoryzomys simplex" was independently described in 1888 on the basis of <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> cave specimens from Brazil (as "Hesperomys simplex"); and in 1921 on the basis of a live specimen from Paraguay (as "Oryzomys wavrini"). This was confirmed in 1991 that both names pertained to the same species.

"Pseudoryzomys simplex" has had a complex <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history. It was first described in 1888 by Danish zoologist <a href="Herluf%20Winge">Herluf Winge</a>, who reviewed the materials <a href="Peter%20Wilhem%20Lund">Peter Wilhem Lund</a> had collected in the caves of <a href="Lagoa%20Santa%2C%20Minas%20Gerais">Lagoa Santa</a>, <a href="Minas%20Gerais">Minas Gerais</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>. Winge described the species as "Hesperomys simplex", and placed it in the same genus ("<a href="Hesperomys">Hesperomys</a>") as the species now called "<a href="Lundomys">Lundomys molitor</a>" and two species now placed in "<a href="Vesper%20mouse">Calomys</a>". Like most <a href="Lund%27s%20mammals%20of%20Lagoa%20Santa">other species</a> Winge proposed, "H. simplex" was mostly ignored in the systematic literature, but from 1952 it was used briefly, in the combination ""Oecomys simplex"", for an "<a href="Oecomys">Oecomys</a>" species from central Brazil. In his 1960 review of "Oecomys", <a href="Field%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Field Museum</a> mammalogist <a href="Philip%20Hershkovitz">Philip Hershkovitz</a> denied any affinities between "simplex" and "Oecomys", noting that various features of the "H. simplex" skull illustrated by Winge instead suggested affinities to the <a href="Phyllotini">phyllotine</a> or <a href="Sigmodontini">sigmodont</a> groups.

In 1921, renowned British <a href="Mammalogy">mammalogist</a> <a href="Oldfield%20Thomas">Oldfield Thomas</a> described "Oryzomys wavrini" as a new species of "<a href="Oryzomys">Oryzomys</a>" from Paraguay. In the next decades, it was viewed as an aberrant species of "Oryzomys" (then used in a much broader sense than now), but it was moved to a separate genus, named "Pseudoryzomys", by Hershkovitz in 1959, who noted that although it is similar to "<a href="marsh%20rice%20rat">Oryzomys palustris</a>" in appearance, other features suggest it is more closely related to "<a href="Phyllotis">Phyllotis</a>". Thus, he viewed the animal as a member of the phyllotine group of rodents, which includes "Calomys" and "Phyllotis", not of the <a href="Oryzomyini">oryzomyine</a> group, which includes "Oryzomys", and his opinion was mostly accepted in the next few decades. Scientific knowledge of the rare "Pseudoryzomys wavrini"—only three specimens were known when Hershkovitz described the genus "Pseudoryzomys" in 1959—increased in the following years, and in 1975 the <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>n population was named as a separate <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, "Pseudoryzomys wavrini reigi", because Bolivian animals are slightly larger and darker than those from Paraguay.

In 1980, Argentinean zoologist Elio Massoia suggested that Winge's "Hesperomys simplex" and the living "Pseudoryzomys wavrini" are in fact the same species. In a 1991 study, American zoologists Voss and Myers confirmed this suggestion after re-examining Winge's material, finding no appreciable differences among specimens of "H. simplex" and "P. wavrini". Since then, the species has been known as "Pseudoryzomys simplex" (Winge, 1888), because "simplex" is the oldest <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> for the animal; "Oryzomys wavrini" Thomas, 1921, and "Pseudoryzomys wavrini reigi" Pine and Wetzel, 1975, are <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">junior synonym</a>s. Voss and Myers also re-evaluated the relationships of "Pseudoryzomys"; they considered it closer to oryzomyines than to phyllotines, but declined to formally place it in Oryzomyini in the absence of explicit <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> justification for such a placement.

When Voss and Carleton formally characterized Oryzomyini two years later, they did place "Pseudoryzomys" in the group, even though it lacks complete <a href="mesoloph">mesoloph</a>(id)s. The mesoloph is an accessory crest on the upper molars and the mesolophid is the corresponding structure on the lower molars. Only a few other animals now considered oryzomyines lack complete mesoloph(id)s, but they are absent in various non-oryzomyines, some of which had previously been regarded as close relatives of the oryzomyines that lack them. Oryzomyines with and without complete mesoloph(id)s share various other characters, however, including presence of <a href="mammae">mammae</a> on the chest, absence of a gall bladder, and some characters of the skull, suggesting that they form one natural, <a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a> group. Oryzomyini is now one of several <a href="tribe%20%28taxonomy%29">tribes</a> recognized within the <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a> <a href="Sigmodontinae">Sigmodontinae</a>, which encompasses hundreds of species found across South America and into southern North America. Sigmodontinae itself is the largest subfamily of the family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a>, other members of which include <a href="vole">vole</a>s, <a href="lemming">lemming</a>s, <a href="hamster">hamster</a>s, and <a href="Peromyscus">deermice</a>, all mainly from Eurasia and North America.

Several <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> studies published during the 1990s and 2000s supported a close relationship between "Pseudoryzomys" and two other oryzomyines with reduced or absent mesoloph(id)s, "Lundomys" and "<a href="Holochilus">Holochilus</a>". The extinct genera "<a href="Noronhomys">Noronhomys</a>" and "<a href="Carletonomys">Carletonomys</a>", described in 1999 and 2008 respectively, were also recognized as members of the group. In 2006, a broad <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> and <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> phylogenetic study of Oryzomyini provided further support for the relationship between "Holochilus", "Lundomys", and "Pseudoryzomys". Within this group, morphological data supported a closer relationship between "Holochilus" and "Lundomys" to the exclusion of "Pseudoryzomys", but DNA sequence data favored a clustering between "Holochilus" and "Pseudoryzomys" to the exclusion of "Lundomys"; among all oryzomyines, this was the only case where relationships which received strong support from morphological and DNA sequence data conflicted. Together, the three genera form part of a large group of oryzomyines ("<a href="Oryzomyini%23clade%20D">clade D</a>"), which contains tens of other species. Several of those display some adaptations to life in the water, being partially <a href="aquatic%20animal">aquatic</a>, as do "Pseudoryzomys" and its relatives. Morphological data indicate that the genus "<a href="Oryzomys">Oryzomys</a>" is the closest relative of the group that includes "Pseudoryzomys", but DNA sequence data from the nuclear <a href="RBP3">IRBP</a> gene did not support this relationship; <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent</a> adaptations towards a semiaquatic lifestyle may explain the morphological support for a relation between "Oryzomys" and the other three genera.
"Pseudoryzomys simplex" is a nondescript, medium-sized rat with long, soft fur. The upperparts are gray–brown and the underparts are <a href="buff%20%28color%29">buff</a>; the color changes gradually over the body. The small ears are covered with short hairs. The tail is as long as or slightly longer than the head and body, and is dark above and light below. Despite the presence of short hairs, the scales on the tail are clearly visible. The hairs on the feet are pale. The hindfeet are long and narrow and have five toes, the first and fifth of which are short. <a href="Interdigital%20webbing">Webbing</a> is present between the second, third, and fourth toes, but the membranes are not as large as in "Lundomys" or "Holochilus". The <a href="ungual%20tufts">tufts of hair</a> on the toes and several of the <a href="Paw%23Common%20characteristics">pads</a> are reduced, other common characteristics of semiaquatic oryzomyines. The head-body length is , tail length , hindfeet length , ear length and body mass .
The female has four pairs of <a href="teat">teat</a>s, including one on the chest and three on the belly, and the <a href="gall%20bladder">gall bladder</a> is absent, both important characters of Oryzomyini. As is characteristic of Sigmodontinae, "Pseudoryzomys" has a complex penis, with the <a href="baculum">baculum</a> (penis bone) displaying large protuberances at the sides. In the <a href="cartilage">cartilaginous</a> part of the baculum, the central digit is smaller than those at the sides.

The skull, which is short at the front, shows some typical oryzomyine characters. The <a href="palate">palate</a> is long, extending past the molars and the <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a>ry bones. The <a href="alisphenoid%20strut">alisphenoid strut</a>, which in some sigmodontines separates two <a href="foramina%20of%20the%20skull">foramina</a> (openings) in the skull, is absent. The <a href="squamosal">squamosal</a> bone lacks a suspensory <a href="process%20%28anatomy%29">process</a> contacting the <a href="tegmen%20tympani">tegmen tympani</a>, the roof the <a href="tympanic%20cavity">tympanic cavity</a>. The front part is short.

The <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal</a> bones end bluntly close to the hindmost extent of the <a href="premaxillary">premaxillary</a> bones. The narrow <a href="interorbital%20region">interorbital region</a>, located between the eyes, converges towards the front and is flanked by low beads. The <a href="interparietal">interparietal</a> bone, located in the roof of the skull on the braincase, is nearly as wide as the <a href="frontal%20bone">frontals</a>, but does not reach the squamosals.

The <a href="incisive%20foramen">incisive foramina</a>, which perforate the palate between the <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s and the <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>, are long and narrow, extending between the first molars. The back margins of the <a href="zygomatic%20plate">zygomatic plate</a>s, the flattened front portions of the <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a>es (cheekbones), are located before the first molars. Like its close relatives "Lundomys" and "Holochilus", "Pseudoryzomys" has spinous processes on its zygomatic plates. These genera also share relatively simple <a href="posterolateral%20palatal%20pit">posterolateral palatal pit</a>s, perforations of the palate near the third molar. Unlike "Holochilus" and "Lundomys", however, "Pseudoryzomys" has a flat palate, lacking a ridge on the middle that extends along the length of the palate. The <a href="parapterygoid%20fossa">parapterygoid fossa</a>e, which are located behind the third molars, are excavated beyond the level of the palate, but not as deeply as in "Holochilus" and "Lundomys". The <a href="mastoid">mastoid</a> skull bone contains a conspicuous opening, as in most oryzomyines.

The <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw) is short and deep. The <a href="mental%20foramen">mental foramen</a>, an opening at the front of the mandible, just before the first molar, opens to the side. The <a href="capsular%20process">capsular process</a> of the lower incisor, a raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, is well developed. The two <a href="masseteric%20ridge">masseteric ridge</a>s, to which some of the chewing muscles are attached, are entirely separate, joining only at their front edges, which are located below the first molar.

As in all oryzomyines except "Holochilus" and its close relatives, the molars are <a href="brachyodont">brachyodont</a>, low-crowned, and <a href="bunodont">bunodont</a>, with the cusps extending higher than the central parts of the molars. They are characterized by strong cusps and absence or reduction of accessory crests. The cusps of the upper molars are opposite, but in the lower molars the labial (outer) cusps are slightly further to the front than the lingual (inner) ones. On the upper first molar, one accessory ridge, the <a href="anteroloph">anteroloph</a>, is lacking, but another, the <a href="mesoloph">mesoloph</a>, is present. Unlike in most other oryzomyines, however, which have mesolophs reaching the labial margin of the molar, the mesolophs of "Pseudoryzomys" are short and protrude only slightly from the middle of the molar. The corresponding structure in the lower molars, the <a href="mesolophid">mesolophid</a>, is completely absent. The hindmost valley between cusps on the lower first molar, the <a href="posteroflexid">posteroflexid</a>, is severely reduced, foreshadowing its loss in "Lundomys" and "Holochilus". A number of molar traits support "Pseudoryzomys"s relationship with "Holochilus" and "Lundomys", forming steps in the transition from the complex, low-crowned generalized oryzomyine molar pattern to the simpler, high-crowned pattern of "Holochilus".

As in all oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side; in addition, the first upper molar in "Pseudoryzomys" and some other species has another labial root. The first lower molar has large roots at the front and back of the tooth and two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two roots at the front, one labial and one lingual, and another at the back.

"Pseudoryzomys" has 19 or 20 <a href="thoracic%20vertebrae">thoracic</a> (chest) and <a href="lumbar%20vertebrae">lumbar vertebrae</a>, 13 of which bear <a href="rib">rib</a>s, as is characteristic of oryzomyines. The first ribs contact both the <a href="vertebra%20prominens">seventh</a> cervical (neck) vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra, an important character of the <a href="Sigmodontinae">Sigmodontinae</a>. Unlike in most sigmodontines, including "Holochilus" and "Lundomys", the fourth lumbar vertebra lacks the processes known as <a href="anapophyses">anapophyses</a>. There are three or four <a href="sacral%20vertebrae">sacral</a> and about 29 <a href="caudal%20vertebrae">caudal</a> (tail) vertebrae. Between the second and third caudal vertebrae, separate bones called <a href="hemal%20arches">hemal arches</a> are present. These display a spinous process at the back, as in both "Holochilus" and "Lundomys". On the <a href="humerus">humerus</a>, the upper arm bone, the <a href="entepicondylar%20foramen">entepicondylar foramen</a> is absent, as in all members of the <a href="Sigmodontinae">Sigmodontinae</a>; in some other cricetids, it perforates the far (distal) end of the humerus.

The <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a> generally includes 56 <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s with a total of 54 major arms (2n = 56, FN = 54) in specimens from both Bolivia and Brazil; a poorly prepared Paraguayan specimen seems to have a similar karyotype. In this karyotype, all <a href="autosome">autosome</a>s (non-sex chromosomes) are <a href="acrocentric">acrocentric</a> (with one arm so short as to be almost invisible). However, in two specimens from the Brazilian states of <a href="Tocantins">Tocantins</a> and <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28state%29">São Paulo</a>, one pair of autosomes contains both an acrocentric and a <a href="Centromere%23Metacentric">metacentric</a> chromosome (with two equally long arms), yielding an FN of 55. One arm of the metacentric chromosome consists entirely of <a href="heterochromatin">heterochromatin</a>. Apparently, a whole heterochromatic arm was added to this chromosome; cases of similar variation are known from the rodents "<a href="Peromyscus">Peromyscus</a>", "<a href="Clyomys">Clyomys</a>", and "<a href="Thaptomys">Thaptomys</a>". Both <a href="sex%20chromosome">sex chromosome</a>s are acrocentric, and <a href="X%20chromosome">X</a> is larger than <a href="Y%20chromosome">Y</a>. In addition to heterochromatin near the <a href="centromere">centromere</a>, the Y chromosome contains two large blocks of heterochromatin on its long arm. The karyotype is closely similar to that of "<a href="Holochilus%20brasiliensis">Holochilus brasiliensis</a>".

"Pseudoryzomys simplex" is known from northeastern Argentina, probably south to about <a href="30th%20parallel%20south">30°S</a>, northward through western <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a> to eastern <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and from there eastward through Brazil in the states of <a href="Mato%20Grosso">Mato Grosso</a>, <a href="Goi%C3%A1s">Goiás</a>, Tocantins, <a href="Minas%20Gerais">Minas Gerais</a>, São Paulo, <a href="Bahia">Bahia</a>, and far in the northeast, <a href="Alagoas">Alagoas</a> and <a href="Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a>. Paraguayan animals are somewhat smaller than those from Bolivia and Brazil and those from Bolivia have darker fur than Paraguayan specimens, but these differences are not considered significant enough to recognize <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>. Certain <a href="bat">bat</a>s show a similar pattern of variation: they are smaller and paler in the <a href="Gran%20Chaco">Chaco</a> region, which includes much of Paraguay. Two specimens from Paraguay, collected apart, differed by 1.4% in the sequence of the <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b"</a> gene, but nothing is known about genetic variation in other parts of the range. The species has long been rare in collections; in 1991, Voss and Myers could use less than 50 specimens for their study of the species, including Lund's fragmentary material from Lagoa Santa.

A fragmentary lower jaw of ""Pseudoryzomys" aff. "P. simplex"" (i.e., an unnamed species close to "Pseudoryzomys simplex") is known from a cave deposit in <a href="Cueva%20Tixi">Cueva Tixi</a>, <a href="Buenos%20Aires%20Province">Buenos Aires Province</a>, Argentina, outside the current distribution of the species. It is dated from the first millennium CE. The jaw's <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> agrees with that of "P. simplex", but the toothrow is relatively long (5.78 mm; 4.61 to 5.60 mm in three specimens of "P. simplex") and the first molar is relatively narrow (1.28 mm; 1.30 to 1.40 mm in five "P. simplex").

"P. simplex" inhabits <a href="Tropical%20and%20subtropical%20grasslands%2C%20savannas%2C%20and%20shrublands">open, usually humid tropical and subtropical lowlands</a>. In Argentina, it is mainly a species of the eastern Chaco and in Brazil it is found in the <a href="Cerrado">Cerrado</a> and <a href="Caatinga">Caatinga</a>. Most specimens for which habitat data are known were caught on the ground in humid grassland, some in seasonally flooded areas; an Argentinean specimen was captured in dense swamp vegetation. It is terrestrial and semiaquatic, living on the ground but also spending time in the water.

Nothing is known about behavior or diet. "P. simplex" has frequently been found in <a href="pellet%20%28ornithology%29">pellets</a> of the <a href="barn%20owl">barn owl</a> ("Tyto alba") and also in those of the <a href="great%20horned%20owl">great horned owl</a> ("Bubo virginianus"). It is a preferred prey of the <a href="maned%20wolf">maned wolf</a> ("Chrysocyon brachyurus").

The species is not known to be threatened and its conservation status is classified as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">IUCN</a>. It is a widely distributed species without substantial threats to its continued existence, but degradation of its habitat may endanger some populations. It was assessed as "potentially vulnerable" in Argentina.

The coin was designed by <a href="Laura%20Gardin%20Fraser">Laura Gardin Fraser</a> and <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a>, and <a href="United%20States%20commemorative%20coin">commemorates</a> those who traveled the <a href="Oregon%20Trail">Oregon Trail</a> and settled the Pacific Coast of the United States in the mid-19th century. Struck over a lengthy period in small numbers per year, the many varieties produced came to be considered a ripoff by coin collectors, and led to the end, for the time, of the <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">commemorative coin series</a>.

Ohio-born <a href="Ezra%20Meeker">Ezra Meeker</a> had traveled the Trail with his family in 1852 and spent the final two decades of his long life before his death in 1928 publicizing the Oregon Trail, that it should not be forgotten. In 1926, at age 95, he appeared before a Senate committee, requesting that the government issue a commemorative coin that could be sold to raise money for markers to show where the Trail had been. The coin had originally been thought of by Idahoans, led by Dr. Minnie Howard, seeking to further preservation work at <a href="Fort%20Hall">Fort Hall</a>; Meeker broadened the idea. Congress authorized six million half dollars, and placed no restriction on when or at what mint the coins would be struck. Meeker's <a href="Oregon%20Trail%20Memorial%20Association">Oregon Trail Memorial Association</a> (OTMA) had tens of thousands of pieces struck in 1926 and 1928, and did not sell them all. Nevertheless, most years between 1933 and 1939, it had small quantities of the half dollar coined, in some years from all three operating mints to produce <a href="mint%20mark">mintmarked</a> varieties, and raised prices considerably.

Collectors complained that some of the issues were controlled by coin dealers, and individual collectors had to pay high prices. Public protests followed, and in 1939 Congress ended the series. Despite the complaints, the OTMA had difficulty in selling the coins, and they remained available from the OTMA's successor organization as late as 1953. Just over 260,000 of the 6,000,000 authorized coins were struck, of which about 60,000 were melted. The US commemorative coin struck over the longest period, the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar has been widely praised for its design.

In the middle years of the 19th century, before the completion of the <a href="first%20transcontinental%20railroad">transcontinental railroad</a> in 1869 made travel easier, hundreds of thousands of people journeyed along the <a href="Oregon%20Trail">Oregon Trail</a> to settle the Far West of the United States. Not all who began the journey reached their destination as there was much suffering and death along the way—by one estimate, 20,000 people lie in unmarked graves.

Ohio-born farmer <a href="Ezra%20Meeker">Ezra Meeker</a> (1830–1928) traveled the Oregon Trail in 1852; he and his young wife and infant child went by ox-drawn wagon from Iowa to <a href="Oregon%20Territory">Oregon Territory</a>. In his old age, he came to believe that the Oregon Trail, and the sacrifice of those who had died along it, were being forgotten. Amid considerable publicity as one of the last survivors of the pioneers who had blazed the way west, Meeker retraced his route along the Trail between 1906 and 1908. The Trail had in some places disappeared, swallowed up by town and farm, and in his journeys, he sought to find where he had passed, seeking to have historical markers erected. He took his ox team and wagon across the nation to publicize his cause, parking his rig in front of the White House where he met President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>. In New York, he crossed the <a href="Brooklyn%20Bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a>. In 1910, he and his oxen participated in the <a href="Tournament%20of%20Roses%20Parade">Tournament of Roses Parade</a> in Pasadena. In the succeeding years, he traveled the route by oxcart, automobile, and, at age 93 in 1924, airplane, attempting to further his cause, and seeking federal recognition and funding for his efforts.

The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar stemmed from various efforts by Idahoans who favored the preservation of the site of <a href="Fort%20Hall">Fort Hall</a>, an important way station on the Trail. The idea was sparked by the issuance of the 1925 <a href="Stone%20Mountain%20Memorial%20half%20dollar">Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar</a>, which caused Mabel Murphy, wife of an Idaho newspaperman, to propose to her husband the striking of an Oregon Trail coin, the profits from which could be used for historic preservation. Her husband, D.T. Murphy, on April 16, 1925 dutifully published an editorial, "Oregon Trail Covered Wagon Half Dollars" in the "<a href="Idaho%20State%20Journal">Idaho State Journal</a>". Mrs. Murphy would not live to see the coin issued, dying November 30, 1925 of tuberculosis.

The idea for the coin was brought up again when civic activists in <a href="Pocatello%2C%20Idaho">Pocatello, Idaho</a>, led by Dr. <a href="Minnie%20Howard">Minnie Howard</a>, sought ideas for funding a monument on the site of Fort Hall. Insurance salesman F.C. McGowan displayed a Stone Mountain piece, "Yes. Coinage. Like this!" Howard and her colleagues pursued the idea. Meeker did as well once he heard of it, forming the <a href="Oregon%20Trail%20Memorial%20Association">Oregon Trail Memorial Association</a>, ("OTMA" or "the Association") a national organization, which could also receive the half dollars, and sell them at a profit.

By 1925, Congress was reluctant to authorize more commemorative coins; twelve pieces had been issued between 1920 and 1925, and many legislators felt that coins were being allowed that "commemorate[d] events of local and not national interest". The entire mintages of commemoratives were sold at face value to the sponsoring organizations designated in the authorizing acts. These groups then sold the coins to the public at a premium, thus raising money for causes that Congress had deemed worthy. Made cautious by a series of unsuccessful issues, Congress rejected a number of proposals for special coins in early 1926. Among these were pieces to honor the completion of the <a href="Lincoln%20Highway">Lincoln</a> and <a href="Victory%20Highway">Victory Highway</a>s, and a proposal to commemorate the centennial of the birth of American composer <a href="Stephen%20Foster">Stephen Foster</a>.

The bill authorizing the Oregon Trail Memorial <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a> was first introduced in the House of Representatives on January 25, 1926 by Washington Congressman <a href="John%20Franklin%20Miller%20%28Washington%20representative%29">John Franklin Miller</a>, who had previously been mayor of Seattle. Meeker was living in Seattle while Miller was mayor, having moved from his previous home in <a href="Puyallup%2C%20Washington">Puyallup</a>. According to local historian Bert Webber in his 1986 monograph on the coin, "there is little doubt that Mr. Miller was influenced to propose this coin by Ezra Meeker." A hearing was held before the House Coinage Committee on March 3; Meeker testified. The bill was reported favorably, and then passed by the full House on April 5, 1926. The bill was not opposed in the House of Representatives, though one member, Michigan Congressman <a href="Louis%20Cramton">Louis Cramton</a>, asked several questions before it passed by <a href="unanimous%20consent">unanimous consent</a>. According to an October 2013 article in "<a href="The%20Numismatist">The Numismatist</a>", "Congress was no match for Meeker".
On April 26, 1926, the 95-year-old Meeker appeared before the Senate's Committee on Banking and Currency. Treasury Secretary <a href="Andrew%20W.%20Mellon">Andrew W. Mellon</a> had filed a letter opposing commemorative coin issues, except those of national importance. Meeker, in his testimony, argued that the Trail issue would be of such importance. The OTMA board considered whether to seek amendment of the bill to the alternative suggested by Mellon, a commemorative medal. In part because of Howard's urging, they decided to stay with the coin. The bill for the half dollar was reported without recommendation, but was passed by the Senate on May 10. Meeker met with President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> to ensure it would be signed, which it was on May 17, 1926 as Public Law 325, authorizing the issuance of up to 6,000,000 half dollars. President Calvin Coolidge signed the bill on the White House lawn; Meeker was present at the <a href="signing%20ceremony">signing ceremony</a> and was photographed shaking hands with President Coolidge.

The bill required that the Association pay for the half dollars at par, and that the <a href="coining%20%28mint%29">dies</a> and other costs of preparation not be at the expense of the United States. The figure of six million was the largest in American commemorative history, exceeding the five million for the Stone Mountain issue. Congress placed no restriction on which mint should strike the coins, and did not put a time limit on the authorization. According to numismatists Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a> in their encyclopedia of US commemoratives, the bill passed "possibly because the stated purpose was nationalistic rather than obscurely local". Coin dealer and author <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> states that "on the surface the motivation seemed to be good enough ... doubtless many American citizens had family ties to the famous migration".

Meeker wanted the new half dollars struck as quickly as possible; he was planning another journey west on the Trail, and wanted to be able to sell the coins along the way. The Association initially contacted <a href="Chester%20Beach">Chester Beach</a>, credited with the design of the 1923 <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine%20Centennial%20half%20dollar">Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar</a>, to sculpt the new coin, but he was unavailable, though he prepared sketches.

The OTMA tried to reach agreement with <a href="Gutzon%20Borglum">Gutzon Borglum</a>, designer of the Stone Mountain piece, but he wanted too much money and time. Ulric Stonewall Jackson Dunbar, who had played a minor role in the <a href="Columbian%20half%20dollar">Columbian half dollar</a> of 1892–93, was willing, but lacked the national reputation the Association felt the coin's sculptor needed. After receiving suggestions from the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Society">American Numismatic Society</a>, the Association turned to the husband-and-wife team of <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a> and <a href="Laura%20Gardin%20Fraser">Laura Gardin Fraser</a>. James Fraser had designed the <a href="Buffalo%20nickel">Buffalo nickel</a>; Laura Gardin Fraser had created several commemorative coins, including the Grant Centennial dollar and half dollar. It chose the Frasers at the urging of Minnie Howard, who felt that James Fraser's work dealt with the West, and might make manifest, in his coin design, the importance of the migration by covered wagon. The Association determined upon a design concept of a map showing the Oregon Trail on one side, and on the other a man leading an ox-drawn wagon, with his wife and infant child riding. Although he is not formally commemorated by the coin, the man was meant to be Meeker.

James Fraser designed the "wagon" <a href="Obverse%20and%20reverse">"side"</a> while Laura Fraser designed the "Indian side" and converted both into relief models. Meeker pestered Laura Fraser to complete the modeling, as he wanted the half dollars available for sale at an upcoming event. She completed the work by July 30, 1926, when she wrote to enquire where she should send the designs for endorsement by the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>. This body since 1921 had been tasked with advising the Secretary of the Treasury on coinage design. She sent photographs of her models to the commission's offices. On August 5, 1926, commission chairman <a href="Charles%20Moore%20%28Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts%29">Charles Moore</a> responded enthusiastically, informing her that not only had the commission endorsed the designs, but they were having the prints framed for their meeting room. To save time, the hubs from which coinage dies could be prepared were made by the <a href="Medallic%20Art%20Company">Medallic Art Company</a> of New York, which had made reductions from plaster models to hubs for several commemorative issues. The resulting hubs were sent to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>, where working dies for the issue were made. A <a href="compass%20rose">compass rose</a> on the Indian side, included in Laura Fraser's models, does not appear on the issued coin, though the reason for the change is not known.

The "wagon side" designed by James Fraser depicts a <a href="Conestoga%20wagon">Conestoga wagon</a> drawn by two oxen, heading into an extremely large setting sun, with resplendent rays. The designers' initials appear behind the wagon; five stars appear below the vehicle, though what they represent is uncertain. Swiatek and Breen suggested that they represent five states and territories through which pioneers would have passed.

The "Indian side" designed by Laura Fraser features a dramatically rendered Native American, standing erect with outstretched arm in what Vermeule describes as a gesture of peace. The Indian was added by the Frasers to the original map design concept endorsed by the OTMA. Swiatek and Breen noted that the Indian's "position has been irreverently compared to that of a traffic policeman demanding 'Halt!' " Such statements were made from the time of issue; "The Numismatist" in November 1926 stated that the Indian's left hand "is upraised as if warning the people of the East of the perils and hardship of the Trail". Meeker's 1928 obituary in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" averred that the Indian was "standing with hands upraised to stop the white man's progress westward". The Native American wears a headdress, has a blanket and bow, and is superimposed on a map of the United States, with a line of Conestoga wagons heading west. The design is carried to the rim of the coin; <a href="Hudson%20Bay">Hudson Bay</a> is visible in the upper right.

The Frasers' design for the half dollar has been widely admired. Swiatek and Breen deemed the issue "one of the greatest artistic triumphs ever to be released by the Mint". Numismatic historian <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a> called the coin "the most beautiful as well as the most truly 'American' U.S. coin. It testifies to the fact that authentic genius, even when trammeled by the necessities of a modern, mechanical mint, can transform our coinage into a work of art."

According to Webber, "during the final stages of manufacture, [Meeker] kept heckling the mint to 'hurry up' ". The Philadelphia Mint struck 48,000 pieces in September 1926, plus 30 reserved for inspection by the 1927 <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">United States Assay Commission</a>. Meeker peddled them along his route at $1 each. The difference between the face value and the sale price was to pay the cost for historical markers along the Trail, and to renovate the <a href="Whitman%20Mission%20National%20Historic%20Site">Whitman Mission</a> in Washington state. The 1926 piece was later dubbed by the Association the "Ezra Meeker Issue". The first piece struck was presented to Meeker; its whereabouts are not known, while the second, presented to Howard, rests in the <a href="Idaho%20State%20Historical%20Museum">Idaho State Historical Museum</a>.

With the initial quantity committed (75 pieces were returned to the mint, most likely because they were damaged or misstruck), the Association requested that more pieces be produced. A hundred thousand were coined at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a> in October and November, bearing the <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a> S (1926-S). The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar thus became the first commemorative coin struck at multiple mints; Bowers notes that this set "a precedent which would be expanded and abused in the years to come". According to Swiatek and Breen, "the Association ... [was] expecting that the collectors who bought 1926 Philadelphia coins would turn out in similar or greater numbers for the second variety". Although a few thousand quickly sold, the market for the half dollars proved saturated, and tens of thousands remained at the mint pending payment. On December 29, 1926, Meeker celebrated his 96th birthday in New York; he was presented with 96 Oregon Trail Memorial half dollars by the Association.

Despite the many unsold 1926-S half dollars still in the government's hands, the Association sought the issuance of 1927-dated half dollars; this was refused by the Treasury Department (of which the Bureau of the Mint was a part) due to the backlog. In 1928, 50,000 more were struck at the Philadelphia Mint. Meeker continued his exploits: he was presented with 97 coins on his birthday in December 1927 by the Association and brought his half dollars to the visitor's gallery of the <a href="New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a>, though he was refused permission to go onto the floor. In April 1928, Meeker wrote to the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a>, urging its coin-collecting members to purchase both the 1926 and 1926-S pieces. Nevertheless, although Meeker organized a national campaign to sell the coins, the OTMA lost $10,000 by his efforts, due to office and other expenses. "The aged pioneer did not appear to be that good with money".

Meeker was given a truck chassis and money to modify it into a wagon-topped vehicle by <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a> in 1928 for yet another Trail trip. Ford offered to make the vehicle more comfortable for Meeker if he brought it to the Ford factory in <a href="Dearborn%2C%20Michigan">Dearborn, Michigan</a>. Accordingly, when he left New York in August 1928 on another journey, planning to sell half dollars along the way, he headed directly for Michigan. He arrived ill, and was hospitalized, almost dying there. He was able to return home, disgruntled at having missed voting in the election (he supported the successful Republican candidate, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Commerce">Secretary of Commerce</a> <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>, for president) for the first time since 1853. At his home in Washington state, Meeker again became ill in November, and died December 3, 1928, three and a half weeks before his 98th birthday. He was buried in a cemetery in Puyallup, a place he had helped settle. Meeker's headstone bears a plaque reproducing the wagon side of the half dollar.

After Meeker's death, the OTMA selected <a href="Howard%20R.%20Driggs">Howard R. Driggs</a>, a professor of English education at <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a> as his successor, and elected a new board of directors, which worked to clear the debt Meeker had accrued. Coins on hand continued to be sold. It was able to persuade President Hoover to proclaim the Covered Wagon Centennial in 1930, the hundredth anniversary both of Meeker's birth and of the first wagon train leaving St. Louis for the <a href="Oregon%20country">Oregon country</a>. One means of selling coins the Association devised was a campus-wide drive at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>, alma mater of Association executive director Lorne W. Buckley, in October 1930 to raise money for Trail markers. More than 600 coins were sold.

Most 1928 Oregon Trail Memorial half dollars remained in the hands of the Treasury for several years after their striking, though the Association purchased an estimated 1,000 for sale to the public. This impoundment by the government generated interest in the coin collecting community—several letters to the editor appeared in "The Numismatist", enquiring as to the coins's fate. One collector followed up with the Philadelphia Mint; Acting Superintendent Fred H. Chaffin replied that the coins were being held there for the Association, and were dated 1928. The OTMA had a financial crisis in 1931, and was planning to close its doors, but operations continued, with headquarters moved from its Manhattan office to Driggs's home in <a href="Bayside%2C%20Queens">Bayside, Queens</a>. The Association marketed the 1928 coins as the "<a href="Jedediah%20Smith">Jedediah Smith</a> Issue".

In early 1933, Driggs sought the issuance of more half dollars on behalf of the OTMA, writing to the acting Mint Director, <a href="Mary%20Margaret%20O%27Reilly">Mary Margaret O'Reilly</a>. and then to Treasury Secretary <a href="William%20H.%20Woodin">William H. Woodin</a>. Driggs wanted 5,000 of the 1928 and 5,000 new half dollars struck at Denver (1933-D), proposing to exchange 10,000 half dollars dated 1926. All the coins held by the government, including those acquired by the exchange, were to be melted. This was approved, and the pieces were duly struck at the <a href="Denver%20Mint">Denver Mint</a>, the first commemorative coins ever struck at Denver.

The Association had turned to the <a href="John%20Walter%20Scott">Scott Stamp and Coin Company</a> of New York to market the coins. Scott was able to sell some of the 1928 half dollars. These actions have been interpreted negatively by numismatic scholars: Q. David Bowers alleges that Scott's representative, Wayte Raymond, proposed melting most of the issue to create an artificial scarcity, and that the company "desired to capitalize on the gullibility of collectors and their need to complete sets by having more varieties coined. Scott figured that if additional Oregon Trail half dollars could be minted with the date 1933 they could be sold effectively at the <a href="Century%20of%20Progress%20Exposition">Century of Progress Exposition</a> held that year in Chicago." Swiatek and Breen noted, "through God only knows what manner of political manipulation, the Oregon Trail Memorial Association managed to obtain approval of a new 1933 Denver issue" for sale at the exposition.

A total of 5,250 of the 1933-D were struck, of which approximately five were reserved for the Assay Commission and 242 were eventually returned for melting. Bowers believes that the returned pieces were likely defective, rather than unsold. The Association dubbed the 1933-D the "Century of Progress Exposition Issue"; both the 1928 and the 1933-D half dollars were sold for $2 each. However, the 1928 could be obtained for $1.75 by anyone who had recently bought two or more of the 1926 issues, and could be purchased for as little as $1.10 each by purchasing 10 of the 1926-dated coins.

With the relative success of the 1933-D issue, the Association ordered 7,000 more in 1934, also struck at Denver. These were dubbed the "Fort Hall, <a href="Fort%20Laramie">Fort Laramie</a> and <a href="Jason%20Lee%20%28missionary%29">Jason Lee</a> Issue" and were also sold by Scott, for $2. These also were not paid for by the OTMA, but were an exchange for 1926-S half dollars—the distribution figure of 83,055 for the 1926-S equals 100,000 for the OTMA plus 55 assay pieces minus 17,000 returned in exchange for the 1933-D and 1934-D pieces.

The resurrected Oregon Trail issue became controversial in the collecting community, with a large number of coin clubs passing resolutions against the reissues; the president of the American Numismatic Association called for commemorative coins to be sold only by the Mint, not by private organizations. Driggs protested against the resolutions, copies of which were sent to federal authorities. Nevertheless, the 1935-S pieces he had requested of the Mint, and dies for which were prepared, were never struck, perhaps because of the indignation of collectors. Other reasons have been postulated for the lack of an issue in 1935: in a 1937 monograph quoted by Bowers, early coin dealer B. Max Mehl speculated that it took Scott two years to dispose of the 1934-D pieces.

Beginning in 1934, organizations and individuals saw small-mintage commemoratives, struck at multiple mints over the course of years, as an opportunity for profit. Congress authorized several issues in 1934, including the Texas Centennial half dollar, meant to honor the centennial of <a href="Texas%20Independence">Texas Independence</a> in 1936, but struck from 1934 to 1938, after 1934 at all three mints each year. More new commemoratives followed in 1935, and over 20 in 1936. These issues included the <a href="Cincinnati%20Musical%20Center%20half%20dollar">Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar</a>, issued to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cincinnati as a center of music, although nothing out of the ordinary is known to have taken place in that city's musical life in 1886.

Numismatist Arlie R. Slabaugh, in his volume on US commemorative coins, discussed the marketing practices of the 1930s:

On December 30, 1935, Driggs wrote to O'Reilly, who with the appointment of <a href="Nellie%20Tayloe%20Ross">Nellie Tayloe Ross</a> as Mint Director had resumed her position as Assistant Mint Director, seeking the issuance of 5,000 Oregon Trail coins to be struck at San Francisco (1936-S) to celebrate the centennial of the arrival of missionary <a href="Marcus%20Whitman">Marcus Whitman</a> and his wife in the <a href="Walla%20Walla%20River">Walla Walla Valley</a>. O'Reilly and other officials did not immediately answer and Driggs wrote again in March 1936, Chaffin, again acting superintendent at Philadelphia, responded that the dies had been prepared and sent to San Francisco. The coins were sent at Driggs' request to Scott's in New York. In May, Driggs asked that 10,000 more be struck at Philadelphia, and this was done. These were sold at the height of the commemorative coin boom. Some of the 1936 and 1936-S pieces were sold by Scott, others by the Association through a New York City mail drop, in either case at an initial price of $1.60 per half dollar. Six each of the 1936 and 1936-S were struck in addition to the requested quantities, for assay.

In June 1936, Herbert G. West, head of the Whitman Centennial Celebration, wrote to Driggs informing him that his group had sought and failed to gain (unusually for 1936) a commemorative half dollar to finance its activities. West wanted Driggs to order a special issue of the Oregon Trail commemorative for the Whitman organization to sell. Driggs was non-committal, first telling West that he hoped they might still be successful in gaining their own half dollar, and then that a special issue would be difficult to get as the mints had shut down for the summer. He eventually agreed to give the Whitman group a thousand 1936-S half dollars, on condition they not be sold for less than $1.60 so as not to undercut the OTMA's sales efforts. In fact, Driggs suggested a sale price of $2, which was what the Whitman organization sold them for. These were dubbed the "Whitman Centennial Issue", or the "Whitman Mission Issue". Most of the 1936 pieces struck at Philadelphia were sold by the means of a mailing to Scott's customer list. Some portion of each of the issues between 1933 and 1937 were reserved for sale by patriotic organizations.

The 1937 issue was distributed only by the Association as the deal with Scott had been ended. A total of 12,000 pieces (plus eight for the Assay Commission) were struck at Denver, and were sold at $1.60. No special name was given to the issue. Coin dealer Mehl wondered in 1937, "the 1936 Philadelphia Mint coin is now retailing at $5 and the San Francisco Mint at $10. Where will this thing stop? I don't know."

The 1938 coins, again without a special name, were struck at all three mints, the first time that had been done for the Oregon Trail coins in one year. Six thousand (plus pieces for the Assay Commission) were struck at each mint, and the issue was sold in sets of three, for $6.25. The same practice was followed in 1939, but the price was raised to $7.50 a set and the mintage reduced to 3,000 coins, plus the assay pieces. According to Swiatek and Breen, these sets were also bought up by speculators, and individual collectors often had to pay double or triple the issue price to secure a set. The coins did not sell out instantly; the OTMA's accounting records reveal that nine months after the 1938 coins were put on sale, the organization still had almost half the issue available. Similarly, by October 1939, the Association had sold only 8,283 half dollars dated that year, less than the 9,000 available for sale. Nevertheless, collectors sent letters of protest to congressmen and to the Treasury Department. On August 5, 1939, Congress acted, passing legislation that put an end to all commemorative issues authorized before March 1939. Swiatek and Breen observed that if Congress had not intervened, "there would probably be Oregon Trail coins dated 1980".

A total of 264,419 Oregon Trail Memorial half dollars were struck, of which approximately 174 were intended for the Assay Commission, and 61,317 were melted. Accordingly, a total of 202,928 were issued to the public. The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar was the commemorative coin struck for the longest period. According to <a href="R.S.%20Yeoman">R.S. Yeoman</a>'s 2018 deluxe edition of "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>", the cheapest Oregon Trail coins are the 1926 and 1926-S at $135 in Almost Uncirculated. The 1939 pieces are listed only as a set and in <a href="Mint%20state">Mint State</a> condition (uncirculated), beginning at $1,350.

The Oregon Trail Memorial Association became part of the newly formed American Pioneer Trails Association (APTA) in 1940, a group meant to be broader in scope than the OTMA. A 1942 joint financial statement of both organizations reveals that it still held 7,212 half dollars. It was selling 1936 and 1937-D half dollars in 1943. A letter to the editor in the September 1943 issue of "The Numismatist" stated that the group was selling the pieces at $5 to finance stakes made of Oregon wood with which to mark the Trail. The sum of five dollars, which included membership, paid for a coin at a time, the letter noted, when the pieces were selling at $1.50 from dealers.

Minnie Howard was still in 1947 trying to secure the site of Fort Hall, and as part of that effort got Idaho Senator <a href="Henry%20Dworshak">Henry Dworshak</a> to introduce legislation allowing the issuance of more Oregon Trail half dollars to benefit Howard's Idaho organization. No sooner had he done so, on February 26, than President <a href="Harry%20Truman">Harry Truman</a> announced his opposition to various coin bills that had been introduced. Acting Treasury Secretary E.F. Foley wrote in opposition, tracing the history between the OTMA and the Treasury Department, "Coins were ordered to be minted and left in the mints". The Banking Committee opposed the bill, and it failed. According to a November 2014 article in "The Numismatist", "With the efforts in the 1940s, the Oregon Trail half dollar, having seen its sunrise in Pocatello, met its sunset there as well."

Driggs led the APTA until his death at age 89 in 1963, but it became less active in his final years. He retained at least some half dollars, notifying the Mint in 1953 that the APTA was the successor to the OTMA, and still had half dollars for sale. After his death, over fifty Oregon Trail half dollars were found among his effects. Other groups have carried the APTA's missions of Trail preservation and the building of monuments. In 1963, two years before Howard's death, the City of Pocatello erected a replica of Fort Hall in a park. The actual site, however, remains undeveloped, with an inconspicuous marker.

No commemorative coins were struck between 1939 and 1945. When authorizations resumed after the war, issues in honor of <a href="Booker%20T.%20Washington">Booker T. Washington</a> and <a href="George%20Washington%20Carver">George Washington Carver</a> were sold, in some years, in low-mintage sets of coins from all three mints. After 1954, when the last such pieces were struck, the Treasury Department did not again support a non-circulating commemorative until 1982, when a half dollar in honor of the 250th anniversary of the birth of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> was issued. The Washington half dollar was distributed by the Mint, with profits applied to the reduction of <a href="United%20States%20national%20debt">the national debt</a>. Bowers writes, "this time around[, striking of commemorative coins] would not be on behalf of private or local interests".

In the past, numismatic writers have described the Association and its activities harshly. Bowers states that the Oregon Trail coins "are beautiful, but circumstances surrounding their issuance leave much to be desired". Slabaugh noted that "Artistically, this is my favorite commemorative coin. But from an ethical standpoint, it is not." Swiatek and Breen wrote that the Association's "activities in exploiting coin collectors and the general public eventually led to the unpopularity of commemoratives in Congress and ultimately to adamant Treasury Department opposition to any further commemorative issues, no matter how worthy the cause to be memorialized, no matter who represented the sponsoring commissions". According to Bowers, "as far as I know, the financial benefits which provided the reason for issuing the half dollars, 'to rescue the various important points along the old trail from oblivion,' to erect 'suitable monuments, memorial and otherwise,' etc., never came to pass, at least not from money provided by the sale of the coins." These, however, did not have the benefit of examining OTMA records. Following the opening of Driggs's papers for research at <a href="Southern%20Utah%20University">Southern Utah University</a>, an October 2013 article in "The Numismatist" concluded that though many documents, such as the arrangements with Scott's, are missing from his records, what there is "seems consistent with Driggs wanting to use the coins to finance the marking of the Oregon Trail, not to line his own pockets".

A small number of coins from each year and mint were put aside for inspection by the following year's Assay Commission; the above figures include such pieces. This accounts for the variance from the even thousand mintages in 1933 and after.

Isopogon anemonifolius

Isopogon anemonifolius, commonly known as broad-leaved drumsticks, is a shrub of the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a> that is found only in eastern <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> in <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. It occurs naturally in <a href="woodland">woodland</a>, open forest, and <a href="heath">heath</a>land on <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> soils. "I. anemonifolius" usually ranges between 1 and 1.5 metres (3–5 feet) in height, generally being smaller in exposed heathland. Its leaves are divided and narrow, though broader than those of the related "<a href="Isopogon%20anethifolius">Isopogon anethifolius</a>", and have a purplish tinge during the cooler months. The yellow flowers appear during late spring or early summer and are displayed prominently. They are followed by round grey cones, which give the plant its common name "drumsticks". The small hairy seeds are found in the old flower parts.

A long-lived plant reaching an age of up to 60 years, "I. anemonifolius" resprouts from its woody base, known as a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>, after <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a>. Seedlings appear in the year following a fire. Although "I. anemonifolius" was collected by <a href="Daniel%20Solander">Daniel Solander</a> in 1770, it was not <a href="Species%20description">described</a> until 1796 by <a href="Richard%20Salisbury">Richard Salisbury</a>. Several varieties have been named, though none are now recognised as distinct. It was first cultivated in the United Kingdom in 1791. "I. anemonifolius" grows readily in the garden if located in a sunny or part-shaded spot with sandy soil and good drainage.

"Isopogon anemonifolius" grows as a woody <a href="shrub">shrub</a> to in height, but is restricted to around on exposed <a href="heath">heath</a>s and headlands. The leaves are long and fork after into three segments, and then often fork a second time. The leaf tips are pointed. Leaves can vary markedly on single plants, though some leaves are undivided. Leaf surfaces are generally smooth, though occasionally covered with fine hair. Its flat leaves distinguish it from the terete (round in cross section) leaves of "<a href="Isopogon%20anethifolius">Isopogon anethifolius</a>"; they are also broader, at wide compared with the 1 mm ( in) wide leaves of the latter species. The new growth and leaves of "I. anemonifolius" may be flushed red to purple in colour, particularly in winter. The globular <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s appear any time from July to January, being most abundant in October. They are in diameter, and grow terminally at the tips of branches, or occasionally axillary (arising on short stems off branches). The individual flowers are around long. They are straight stalkless structures arising from a basal scale. The <a href="perianth">perianth</a>, a tube that envelopes the flower's sexual organs, splits into four segments, revealing a thin delicate <a href="Stigma%20%28botany%29%23Style">style</a> that is tipped with the <a href="Stigma%20%28botany%29">stigma</a>. At the ends of the four perianth segments are the male <a href="pollen">pollen</a>-bearing structures known as <a href="stamen">anthers</a>. Arranged in a spiral pattern, the flowers open from the bottom of the flowerhead inwards. Flowering is followed by the development of the round <a href="infructescence">fruiting cones</a>, which have a diameter of . The seed-bearing nuts are small—up to across—and lined with hairs.

Swedish naturalist <a href="Daniel%20Solander">Daniel Solander</a>, after collecting a specimen at <a href="Botany%20Bay">Botany Bay</a> in 1770 on the <a href="First%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook">first voyage of Captain James Cook</a>, was the first to write of this species. He gave it the name "Leucadendron apiifolium", but never officially <a href="Species%20description">described</a> it. The specific epithet referred to the similarity of its leaves to "<a href="Apium">Apium</a>" (celery).

In 1796 English botanist <a href="Richard%20Anthony%20Salisbury">Richard Salisbury</a> published a formal description of the species, from a specimen collected in Port Jackson (Sydney). He gave it the name "Protea anemonifolia", the specific epithet derived from "anemone" and "folium", the latter meaning "leaf", highlighting the resemblance of its leaves to those of <a href="anemone">anemone</a>s. The common name "drumsticks" is derived from their globular cones.

In 1799, the Spanish botanist <a href="Antonio%20Jos%C3%A9%20Cavanilles">Antonio José Cavanilles</a> described "Protea tridactylides", later identified as a <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> by Salisbury and the English horticulturalist <a href="Joseph%20Knight%20%28horticulturist%29">Joseph Knight</a>. Salisbury founded the new genus "Atylus" in 1807 to remove this and other species from "Protea", but did not make proper combinations for them in the new genus. It gained its current name in 1809 when it was redescribed as the anemone-leaved isopogon ("Isopogon anemonefolius") in the controversial work "<a href="On%20the%20cultivation%20of%20the%20plants%20belonging%20to%20the%20natural%20order%20of%20Proteeae">On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae</a>", published under Knight's name but written by Salisbury. Scottish naturalist Robert Brown had written of the genus "<a href="Isopogon">Isopogon</a>" but Salisbury and Knight had hurried out their work before Brown's. Brown's description appeared in his paper "On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae", subsequently published as "On the Proteaceae of Jussieu" in the "Transactions of the Linnean Society" in 1810.

In 1891, German botanist <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> published "<a href="Revisio%20generum%20plantarum">Revisio generum plantarum</a>", his response to what he perceived as a lack of method in existing nomenclatural practice. He revived the genus "Atylus" on the grounds of priority, and correctly made the combination "Atylus anemonifolius". However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus "Isopogon" was <a href="conserved%20name">nomenclaturally conserved</a> over "Atylus" by the <a href="International%20Botanical%20Congress">International Botanical Congress</a> of 1905.

Several <a href="Variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a> have been described but have been synonymised with "I. anemonifolius" or recognised as distinct species. Brown described varieties "glaber", identified by wholly smooth leaves and branches, and "pubescens", with leaves and branches covered in fine pale grey hairs, in 1830. English botanist <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> tentatively described variety "pubiflorus" in his 1870 work "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>". He queried that it may have been from Sydney, and had a slightly hairy perianth. These are not regarded as distinct. Victorian Government botanist <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Mueller">Ferdinand von Mueller</a> described "I. anemonifolius" var. "tenuifolius" in 1870, now recognised as "<a href="Isopogon%20prostratus">I. prostratus</a>". Australian botanist <a href="Edwin%20Cheel">Edwin Cheel</a> described forma "simplicifolia" in 1923, from collections from <a href="Mount%20Victoria%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Mount Victoria</a> and <a href="Hornsby%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Hornsby</a>. He described it as having mostly unlobed (simple) leaves compared with the typical form. His variety "ceratophylloides" is now a separate species, "<a href="Isopogon%20petiolaris">I. petiolaris</a>".

"I. anemonifolius" is found along the east coast of New South Wales, from near the Victorian border almost to (and possibly reaching) Queensland. It is most common between <a href="Smoky%20Cape">Smoky Cape</a> and <a href="Ulladulla">Ulladulla</a>. There is an outlying population in the vicinity of <a href="Torrington%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Torrington</a> in the <a href="New%20England%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">New England</a> region. Within the <a href="Sydney%20Basin">Sydney Basin</a>, the annual rainfall is 800 to 1400 mm (30–50 in). It occurs naturally from sea level to 1200 m (4000 ft) and is found on low-nutrient <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> soils in heathland and dry <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> <a href="woodland">woodland</a>, particularly along ridges or tops of hills. Typical woodland trees it is associated with include the scribbly gums "<a href="Eucalyptus%20haemastoma">Eucalyptus haemastoma</a>" and "<a href="Eucalyptus%20sclerophylla">E. sclerophylla</a>", yertchuk ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20consideniana">E. consideniana</a>"), yellow bloodwood ("<a href="Corymbia%20eximia">Corymbia eximia</a>"), red bloodwood ("<a href="Corymbia%20gummifera">C. gummifera</a>") and smooth-barked apple ("<a href="Angophora%20costata">Angophora costata</a>"), and heathland plants such as rusty banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20oblongifolia">Banksia oblongifolia</a>"), swamp banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20paludosa">B. paludosa</a>"), mountain devil ("<a href="Lambertia%20formosa">Lambertia formosa</a>"), conesticks ("<a href="Petrophile%20pulchella">Petrophile pulchella</a>"), tick bush ("<a href="Kunzea%20ambigua">Kunzea ambigua</a>"), forest oak ("<a href="Allocasuarina%20torulosa">Allocasuarina torulosa</a>") and "<a href="Hakea%20laevipes">Hakea laevipes</a>".

"I. anemonifolius" is a long-lived plant, with a lifespan of 60 years. It resprouts from its woody base, known as a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>, around two months after being burnt in a <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a>. The resultant new growth takes around two years to flower again, with older plants with larger lignotubers able to put on new growth more quickly. "I. anemonifolius" is slow-growing; a 1990 field study in <a href="Brisbane%20Water%20National%20Park">Brisbane Water National Park</a> found that the lignotuber grew at a rate of 0.173 cm per existing cm of lignotuber per year, yielding a lignotuber of around in diameter at 10 years of age and 5 cm (2 in) diameter at 20 years of age. The largest lignotubers found had a diameter of 40 cm (16 in).

Plants need a lignotuber of around diameter to survive low intensity fires. Plants are able to resprout after more intense fires at around 15 years of age. "I. anemonifolius" is also <a href="serotiny">serotinous</a>—the seeds are held on the plant as a canopy-based seedbank and are released after fire. Most seedlings arise within a year of a bushfire, and very few are seen at other times. The seedbank is most productive between 25 and 35 years after a previous fire. However seedlings may be outcompeted by seedlings of obligate seeder species. The seeds of "I. anemonifolius" fall directly to the ground or are blown a short distance by wind. Young plants flower about seven years after germinating from seed. Repeated bushfire intervals of less than 10 years' duration are likely to result in both reduced survival of older plants and <a href="recruitment%20%28biology%29">recruitment</a> of seedlings, possibly leading to local extinction in 50 years. Intervals of at least 12–13 years for low intensity fires and 15 years for hotter fires are needed for population stability.

<a href="Leaf%20spot">Leaf spot</a>ting is caused by the fungus "<a href="Vizella">Vizella</a>". Flower buds may be damaged by <a href="weevil">weevil</a>s.

"I. anemonifolius" was first cultivated in the United Kingdom in 1791. Knight reported that it flowered and set seed there. With attractive foliage and prominently displayed flowers and cones, "I. anemonifolius" adapts readily to cultivation; plants can be grown in <a href="rock%20garden">rock garden</a>s or as borders, or as a <a href="Container%20garden">pot plant</a>. Garden plants can be variable, with either upright or spreading habits; and some maintaining a naturally compact habit without pruning. It grows readily in a sandy well-drained soil in a sunny or part-shaded position. The species is suited to <a href="hardiness%20zone">USDA hardiness zones</a> 9 to 11. It is hardy in frosts and dry spells, but produces more flowers with extra moisture. It can be pruned heavily once established.

<a href="Plant%20propagation">Propagation</a> is by seed or <a href="Cutting%20%28plant%29">cuttings</a> of hardened growth less than a year old. The seed can be collected from the cones and stored; they are best sown in spring or autumn. The stems and flowers are long-lasting if put in water. The flowers, cones and foliage are used in the cut-flower industry.

"Isopogon" 'Woorikee 2000' is a selected <a href="Dwarfing">dwarf form</a> of "I. anemonifolius", propagated by <a href="Bill%20Molyneux">Bill Molyneux</a> of Austraflora Nursery in Victoria. It produces abundant flowerheads. <a href="Plant%20Breeders%20Rights">Plant Breeders Rights</a> were granted in Australia in 1997 and the cultivar became commercially available in 1999. Another dwarf cultivar, 'Little Drumsticks', is also sold.

Don't Say You Love Me (M2M song)

"Don't Say You Love Me" is the debut single by <a href="M2M%20%28band%29">M2M</a>, a Norwegian pop duo consisting of singers <a href="Marion%20Raven">Marion Raven</a> and <a href="Marit%20Larsen">Marit Larsen</a>. The song first appeared on <a href="Radio%20Disney">Radio Disney</a> before its official US radio and single release in October 1999. It was released on the soundtrack to the film "" in November 1999 and appears in the film's <a href="closing%20credits">closing credits</a>. The song was featured on M2M's debut album, "<a href="Shades%20of%20Purple">Shades of Purple</a>" (2000), and also appeared on their compilation album "" (2003).

The song received positive reviews. <a href="Chuck%20Taylor%20%28writer%20and%20editor%29">Chuck Taylor</a> from "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" said it was "absolutely enchanting" and would appeal to both young and mature listeners. It reached number 2 in Norway, number 4 in both Australia and New Zealand, number 16 in the UK and number 21 on the US <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>. It was <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">certified</a> gold in the US and Australia and remained M2M's biggest hit. M2M performed the song on episodes of the TV series "<a href="One%20World%20%28TV%20series%29">One World</a>", "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Pops">Top of the Pops</a>" and "<a href="Disney%20Channel%20in%20Concert">Disney Channel in Concert</a>". Two similar music videos were released for the song, with one showing clips from " Pokémon: The First Movie".

<a href="Marion%20Raven">Marion Raven</a> and <a href="Marit%20Larsen">Marit Larsen</a> come from <a href="L%C3%B8renskog">Lørenskog</a> in the district east of <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>. They met when they were five years old and became best friends, discovering they had similar interests in music. They began singing together and performing in musical productions. The duo released a <a href="Children%27s%20music">children's</a> album, "Synger Kjente Barnesanger" ("Sing Famous Children's Songs"), in 1996 under the band name Marit & Marion, when Larsen was 11 and Raven was 12 years old. The album was nominated for a <a href="Spellemannprisen">Spellemannprisen</a> award. After the album's release they started writing their own pop songs and sent <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demo</a> recordings out; one of the demos ended up at <a href="Atlantic%20Records">Atlantic Records</a> and they were signed to a worldwide contract in 1998. They held a competition for fans to come up with a new name for their duo, and one girl suggested M2M. Raven and Larsen were 14 and 15 years old, respectively, when they recorded the tracks from their debut album "<a href="Shades%20of%20Purple">Shades of Purple</a>", including their debut single, "Don't Say You Love Me".
The music and lyrics were written by Raven, Larsen, <a href="Peter%20Zizzo">Peter Zizzo</a> and Jimmy Bralower. It was produced by Zizzo and Bralower and was <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> by <a href="Tom%20Lord-Alge">Tom Lord-Alge</a>. "Don't Say You Love Me" is performed in a <a href="Time%20signature">4/4 time signature</a> at a moderately slow <a href="tempo">tempo</a> of 100 beats per minute. Raven and Larsen alternate singing lead vocals for the first two verses, and then sing harmony together during the choruses. For most of the song, the verses are in the <a href="Key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="C-sharp%20minor">C♯ minor</a> and the choruses are in the <a href="Relative%20key">relative major</a> key of <a href="E%20major">E major</a>. The final chorus has a <a href="Modulation%20%28music%29">key change</a> to <a href="F-sharp%20major">F♯ major</a>. The song's prominent instruments are <a href="electric%20piano">electric piano</a> and <a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic guitar</a>, with <a href="Scratching">record scratching</a> sounds layering the production in the chorus in a style akin to <a href="Hanson%20%28band%29">Hanson</a>'s "<a href="MMMBop">MMMBop</a>". The final chorus repeats with ad-libbed background vocals until the song <a href="Fade%20%28audio%20engineering%29">fades out</a>.

Lyrically, the song is about getting "the rules straight on a budding relationship: Slow down and don't say you love me until you give me some time and get to know me." According to musicologist Jon Mikkel Broch Ålvik, "Don't Say You Love Me" is the "thinking person's <a href="teen%20pop">teen pop</a>." Ålvik rejects a superficial interpretation that the lyrics are a "moralistic message of <a href="Sexual%20abstinence">abstinence</a>", arguing instead that M2M "signal a stance that sounds considered and assured rather than prudish" and that the song is a statement of "burgeoning <a href="Agency%20%28philosophy%29">agency</a>." The song has been described as <a href="bubblegum%20pop">bubblegum pop</a> music with similar lyrical qualities to songs by <a href="girl%20group">girl group</a>s of the 1960s, while also having more influence from <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> and <a href="singer-songwriter">singer-songwriter</a> genres than was typical for other teen pop songs of the late 1990s.

There is a slight difference in lyrics between the version used in "" version and the one released on "Shades of Purple". The "Shades of Purple" version includes the line "you start kissing me, what's that about?" In the "Pokémon" version, the lyric is "you said you love me, what's that about?" When asked about the lyric change in an interview, M2M replied "the "Pokémon" people didn't find it appropriate to have kissing in the lyrics, because it was for younger kids. We think [the lyric change] was stupid. The original version is on ["Shades of Purple"], and that's the one we wanted to go with." M2M had not heard of "<a href="Pok%C3%A9mon">Pokémon</a>" until the song was chosen for the soundtrack, as the franchise was not yet popular in Norway.

"Don't Say You Love Me" appeared in "The List", an episode in the TV series "<a href="Felicity%20%28TV%20series%29">Felicity</a>" that aired in the US on 3 October 1999 and reached an audience of 5million people, helping to generate interest in the song. On 10 October it appeared in the "<a href="Jack%20%26amp%3B%20Jill%20%28TV%20series%29">Jack & Jill</a>" episode "Moving On". The song was already being played on <a href="Radio%20Disney">Radio Disney</a> before it made its official US debut on 26 October 1999. The single was released on both CD and <a href="Compact%20Cassette">Compact Cassette</a>. Within a month, more than 100 US top-40 radio stations were playing the song; by 10 November it was the sixth-most requested song on New York radio stations. The song appeared during the <a href="closing%20credits">closing credits</a> of the film "Pokémon: The First Movie" and on the film's soundtrack; both the film and soundtrack were released in the US on 10 November 1999. "Don't Say You Love Me" was the debut single from the album. The single first entered the charts in the US on 20 November, by which time more than 400,000 units had already been shipped to record stores.

Despite the success in the US, in November 1999 it was reported that the single would not be released in the duo's home country of Norway until the following year, as Warner Music Norway wanted to wait until both the "Pokémon" film and soundtrack were released in Europe to capitalise on the exposure. The single was released in Norway on radio on 24 November, and by 11 January it was on sale in Norway and 25 other countries in Europe, the Americas, Asia and Oceania. It was expected to be released in the remaining European countries by the end of the month, though European countries where the single had not yet been released were already playing the song on the radio. The song was popular in Southeast Asia, receiving heavy airplay in Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore, and also in South America; in late May 2000 in Mexico it was the best selling foreign song and the second best selling song overall. On 12 January it was featured in the episode of "<a href="Beverly%20Hills%2C%2090210">Beverly Hills, 90210</a>", "Tainted Love". The song was released in Japan on 25 January, in Spain on 22 February, and in the UK on 20 March on <a href="East%20West%20Records">East West Records</a>. It appeared on "Shades of Purple", which was released in Europe in mid-February and the US on 7 March, and in 2003 it appeared on the album "".

<a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> gave a positive review, calling the song one of the "impossibly touching" tracks on "Shades of Purple" that "sets the standard" for the rest of the album. <a href="Chuck%20Taylor%20%28writer%20and%20editor%29">Chuck Taylor</a> from "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" said the song would appeal to both the young and mature listeners as it "neatly walks the line between pure pop and the cusp of the adult top 40". He added the song was "Absolutely enchanting in its youthful vocal and meaty series of <a href="Hook%20%28music%29">hooks</a>". Michael Paoletta, also from "Billboard", called the song an "infectious pop rocker", adding that "what's most dazzling about the track is the vocal verve of the girls' <a href="Harmonization">harmonizing</a>." Heather Phares from <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> referred to the song as "sweet yet down-to-earth pop". Marius Lillelien, the director of the Norwegian radio station "<a href="NRK%20P3">NRK P3</a>", said "It's a very well-written, well-produced pop song, they're young and potentially the largest Norwegian pop success ever. The song is best suited to an audience aged 10–16, but in my opinion it won't scare away older listeners". "Don't Say You Love Me" was nominated for the year's best song at the 2000 Spellemannprisen awards, though it lost to "Propaganda" by <a href="Briskeby">Briskeby</a>.

In the US, "Don't Say You Love Me" entered the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> at number 72, later peaking at number 21. It also reached number 40 on both the <a href="Latin%20Pop%20Airplay">Latin Pop Airplay</a> and <a href="Tropical%20Songs">Tropical Songs</a> charts. The single sold 39,000 copies in the week preceding 27 November, and had sold 580,000 units by May 2000. It reached number 2 in Norway and number 4 in both Australia and New Zealand. It made the top 10 in Finland, the top 20 in Canada, the UK, Ireland, Sweden and the Netherlands, the top 40 in Italy and Belgium and the top 80 in Germany, France and Switzerland. It was <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">certified</a> gold in the US on 6 December 1999 and in Australia in 2000.

"Don't Say You Love Me" was M2M's biggest hit and is their most recognisable song. While their next single, "<a href="Mirror%20Mirror%20%28M2M%20song%29">Mirror Mirror</a>", was a top 40 single in Australia and Canada, and reached number 62 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, "Don't Say You Love Me" would remain M2M's only top-40 hit in the US, and their only hit at all in many other countries. The song has been called a <a href="one-hit%20wonder">one-hit wonder</a>. While speaking favourably of the duo, in 2014 Abby Devora from <a href="MTV">MTV</a> ranked M2M and the song at number 2 on her list "9 Girl Group One-Hit Wonders You Need To Remember Right Now". Jessica Booth from Gurl.com included the duo and song in her 2012 list "Flashback: 15 Old-School Girl Singers We Miss", calling the song "ridiculously catchy". Kaitlin Cubria from Teen.com listed the duo and song in her 2014 list of "12 forgotten girl groups from the '90s/'00s that are worth your time." In 2014 Nathan Jolly from "<a href="MAX%20%28Australian%20TV%20channel%29">MAX</a>" said it was "one of those few pop songs that is happiness incarnate despite being a 'back the fuck off, dude' anthem".

The video was directed by <a href="Nigel%20Dick">Nigel Dick</a> and was filmed from 4 to 6 October 1999 at the Mission Tiki <a href="drive-in%20theatre">drive-in theatre</a> in <a href="Montclair%2C%20California">Montclair, California</a>. In the video, Raven sings the song while she is in a car with a boy, while Larsen sings and plays the guitar in front of another car. This footage is mixed with M2M singing together at the drive-in, people dancing, the <a href="projectionist">projectionist</a> struggling with his malfunctioning equipment, and the <a href="concession%20stand">concession stand</a> worker who has an overflowing <a href="popcorn%20maker">popcorn maker</a>. When the popcorn stand explodes, M2M continue to perform surrounded by people as popcorn rains down. Air cannons were used to fire 200 garbage bin-sized bags of popcorn into the air to create the raining popcorn effect. In the US the music video made its premiere on 24 October on <a href="The%20WB">The WB</a> following that night's screening of "<a href="7th%20Heaven%20%28TV%20series%29">7th Heaven</a>". It began airing on <a href="The%20Box%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">The Box</a> and <a href="Much%20%28TV%20channel%29">MuchMusic</a> in early November 1999 and began airing on MTV on 15 November.

Two similar versions of the video were released. In one, clips from "Pokémon: The First Movie" are played on the screen at the drive in theatre. In the other version, fewer images of the screen are shown; when they are seen the "Pokémon" images are replaced with either clips of Raven and Larsen singing the song or words such as "M2M" and "<a href="Intermission">Intermission</a>". The "Pokémon" version of the video uses the censored lyrics, while the other one uses the album version of the song. The "Pokémon" version was included on the DVD of the film, while the other version was included on the bonus disc in "The Day You Went Away: The Best of M2M".

To promote the single Raven and Larsen made a six-stop tour of <a href="shopping%20mall">shopping mall</a>s in the <a href="Northeastern%20United%20States">Northeastern US</a> between 21 August and 2 October; it was their first tour under the name M2M. On 9 November 1999, the day before "Pokémon: The First Movie" was released, M2M performed the song live at the Warner Bros. Studio Store on <a href="Fifth%20Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a>, <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, in front of fans and a large media presence. To promote the single M2M also toured Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan before returning to Norway on 24 November. They performed the song on the episode "Band on the Run" of the TV series "<a href="One%20World%20%28TV%20series%29">One World</a>", which aired on 27 November, and on 31 March 2000 they performed it on "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Pops">Top of the Pops</a>". M2M performed the song live at <a href="Walt%20Disney%20World">Walt Disney World</a>'s <a href="Epcot">Epcot</a> park on 12 February 2000. This performance was recorded and appeared on an episode of <a href="Disney%20Channel%20in%20Concert">Disney Channel in Concert</a> on 29 April, which focused on both M2M and <a href="BBMak">BBMak</a>. As their biggest hit, "Don't Say You Love Me" was a popular song during live performances. In December 2001 the song was performed as an <a href="Encore%20%28concert%29">encore</a>, along with "<a href="Everything%20You%20Do">Everything You Do</a>", in front of a crowd of 4,000 at an M2M concert in <a href="Kuala%20Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a>.

Raven and Larsen ceased performing as M2M in 2002, and both went on to pursue solo careers; Larsen is known for performing a <a href="country%20music">country music</a> version of the song during solo performances. The <a href="Filipinos">Filipino</a> acoustic pop duo <a href="Krissy%20%26amp%3B%20Ericka">Krissy & Ericka</a> covered the song on their 2009 self-titled album.

The European version of the single contained the <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">B-side</a> track "The Feeling is Gone", one of three tracks recorded for "Shades of Purple" which were left off the US version of the album. The standard US version featured the "Pokémon: The First Movie" instrumental score "Mewtwo Strikes Back Suite" as the B-side.

Hurricane Gordon (2006)

Hurricane Gordon was the first <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> since 1992 to affect the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> while <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">retaining</a> tropical characteristics. The eighth tropical storm, third hurricane, and first major hurricane of the <a href="2006%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2006 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, Gordon formed on September 10 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It gradually matured into a hurricane as it tracked northward, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) early on September 14 while located about southeast of <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. After becoming nearly stationary, Gordon weakened to minimal hurricane status, although it re-intensified after accelerating to the east. It weakened again after moving over cooler waters, and passed through the Azores on September 20. Shortly thereafter, it became an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> and subsequently affected Spain, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.

The only land area affected while Gordon was tropical – the Azores – sustained little damage, in spite of wind gusts reaching hurricane force on <a href="Santa%20Maria%20Island%20%28Azores%29">Santa Maria Island</a>. Impact was much more significant from the storm in its extratropical phase. In Spain, wind gusts reached along the northwest coast and left 100,000 people without power. Five people in the country sustained storm-related injuries. Further north, the storm brought a surge of tropical air to Ireland and the United Kingdom, contributing to record warm temperatures. In <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, high winds left 120,000 people without power and caused one injury.

On September 1, a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> exited the west coast of Africa and quickly showed signs of organization. It possessed a <a href="low%20pressure%20area">low pressure area</a> and some <a href="convection%20%28meteorology%29">convection</a> as the system moved generally westward. The <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> (NHC) first pinpointed the system as an area for potential development late on September 2 while it was about west-southwest of <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a>. However, an upper-level <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> associated with the developing <a href="Hurricane%20Florence%20%282006%29">Hurricane Florence</a> to its west increased <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> across the region, which prevented significant <a href="tropical%20cyclogenesis">tropical cyclone development</a> over the next week. However, on September 5, the NHC noted the potential for the storm system to organize into a tropical depression within the next several days, but its close proximity to Florence continued to stall its strengthening. By September 9, the trough moved far enough away from the system to allow wind shear to relent, signalling an increase in convective thunderstorm activity. At around 1800 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> that day, the system developed into a tropical depression about east-northeast of the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>.

Upon developing, the depression, small in physical size, moved slowly west-northwestward. Initially, the NHC faced difficulties in forecasting the future of the system due to the potential for resumed strong wind shear, as well as uncertainty in its path of direction. It gradually organized and intensified, and based on observations from the <a href="Hurricane%20Hunters">Hurricane Hunters</a>, the NHC assessed the depression as a tropical storm late on September 11; upon doing so, they <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20naming">gave it the name</a> Gordon. As it strengthened, Gordon developed more substantial <a href="outflow%20%28meteorology%29">outflow</a> and increasing <a href="tropical%20cyclone%23Physical%20structure">banding features</a>. On September 12, the storm slowed and turned toward the north through a weakness in the <a href="subtropical%20ridge">subtropical ridge</a> created by Florence. Wind shear decreased further, and the storm's convection became more symmetric with an intermittent <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye feature</a> in the center. Based on the presence of the eye and estimates from satellite imagery, it is estimated that Gordon intensified into a hurricane early on September 13.
After becoming a hurricane, Gordon underwent <a href="rapid%20deepening">rapid deepening</a> as the eye became better defined and more intense. In 24 hours, the winds increased by to a peak intensity of 120 mph (195 km/h) early on September 14, while located about southeast of <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. This made Gordon a major hurricane, as well as a Category 3 on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">Saffir-Simpson scale</a>, the first of 2006. As it curved to the northeast, the hurricane maintained its peak intensity for about 24 hours, during which the eye decreased in size and the eyewall convection weakened. Afterward, Gordon began weakening due to moving over an area of cooler water temperatures. On September 15, the trough that was previously guiding the hurricane moved further away, allowing the ridge to build to the north and causing Gordon's motion to become nearly stationary. Increased wind shear imparted further weakening, and the hurricane's slow motion resulted in <a href="upwelling">upwelling</a> – the motion of cooler water to the ocean's surface. On September 17, a building ridge to the east caused Gordon to begin a steady northeast motion. By that time, the convection had diminished significantly and the winds weakened to minimal hurricane-force. One NHC forecast predicted <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical transition</a> to occur within 48 hours.
On September 18, Hurricane Gordon began accelerating to the northeast around a strengthening ridge, and later toward the east as guided by a trough. Wind shear decreased, which allowed for convection to redevelop near the eye. Unexpectedly, the hurricane began restrengthening, despite moving over slightly cooler waters; instability from cooler upper-level temperatures allowed for the reintensification. Despite continued forecasts of a weakening trend, Gordon's resiliency presented a rare threat – the first since <a href="Hurricane%20Charley%20%281992%29">Hurricane Charley</a> in 1992 – to the Azores, a <a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a> in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. At about 0600 UTC on September 19, the hurricane attained its secondary peak intensity of about 485 mi (775 km) west-southwest of the Azores. By that time, the cyclone consisted of a solid ring of convection around a contracting eye. Shortly thereafter, Gordon began steadily weakening due to the combination of increasing wind shear and even cooler water temperatures. Its motion became just south of due east, causing the strongest winds to remain south of the islands. At around 0900 UTC on September 20, Gordon passed through the Azores between the islands of Santa Maria and <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Miguel%20Island">São Miguel</a>, producing hurricane-force wind gusts on the former island. At the time, its sustained winds were estimated around , which remained south of any landmasses. The cloud pattern had become less organized and more ragged. 

After passing the Azores, Gordon began interacting with an approaching cold front. Early on September 21, it completed the transition into an extratropical storm while simultaneously weakening below hurricane-force, located about west-northwest of the west coast of <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>. The cyclone maintained its identity as the system turned sharply northeastward and later northward, after passing about 100 mi (160 km) northwest of the <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> province of <a href="Galicia%20%28Spain%29">Galicia</a>. Its forward motion accelerated to about , steered by another extratropical storm, while still maintaining sustained winds of . After moving along the west coast of <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, the extratropical remnants of Gordon turned to the northwest and intensified to hurricane-force winds. It turned to the southwest and later to the southeast, completing a large cyclonic loop before dissipating on September 24 to the south of Ireland.

Late on September 18, while Gordon was beginning to accelerate to the northeast, a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches">tropical storm watch</a> was issued for all of the Azores. The hurricane was expected to weaken to tropical storm-force before affecting the islands. When it became apparent that Gordon would continue intensifying, a hurricane warning replaced the watch about 27 hours before the strongest winds affected the region. The advance of the storm forced the closure of all schools in the region. Concurrently, officials increased the number of emergency workers on stand-by. The two westernmost islands – <a href="Corvo%20Island">Corvo</a> and <a href="Flores%20Island%20%28Azores%29">Flores</a> – were placed under a red alert, the highest on a four-level scale, which indicated the greatest threat for severe weather. The remainder of the archipelago was placed on low alert. Ultimately, the Azores escaped significant damage as the hurricane passed farther south than expected. Overall impact was limited to toppled trees and power lines, leaving portions of Santa Maria Island without electrical service. Santa Maria recorded sustained winds of , with gusts to .
In Portugal, coastal regions were put under a yellow alert, the second lowest level, since the extratropical remnants of Gordon were expected to produce rough seas and heavy rains. In Spain, the Galicia region was placed on red alert by authorities in anticipation of the storm. Classes on September 21 were also suspended by the regional education ministry. Eleven other regions of Spain, extending as far east as <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> and as far south as <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>, received lower levels of warning. The storm's threat also prompted the cancellation or delay of flights along the coast. While passing northwest of Spain, the remnants of Gordon produced strong wind gusts, reaching at Punta Candieira in Galicia on the country's northwest coast. The nearby city of <a href="A%20Coru%C3%B1a">A Coruña</a> recorded sustained winds of , while further inland, a station near Madrid reported winds of 65 mph (107 km/h). Along the coast, waves reached 23 ft (7 m) in height, while rainbands dropped heavy precipitation, including a total of 2.58 in (65.5 mm) in <a href="Canfranc">Canfranc</a>. Wind-blown debris injured four people in the country, and a fifth storm-related injury occurred as the result of a tree falling onto an occupied vehicle. The winds downed trees, traffic lights, and power lines, leaving about 100,000 people without power. Throughout <a href="Galicia%20%28Spain%29">Galicia</a>, total monetary losses reached <a href="Euro">€</a>3 million (<a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>3.8 million; 2006 USD).

Stormy conditions threatened to affect the <a href="2006%20Ryder%20Cup">2006 Ryder Cup</a> in <a href="Straffan">Straffan</a>, <a href="County%20Kildare">County Kildare</a>, <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> at the <a href="K%20Club">K Club</a>, and September 25 was set aside as an additional "reserve day". The club's media center was briefly evacuated, and one woman at the event was injured after being struck by a tree branch broken by the storm. The remnants of Gordon caused stormy conditions that left at least 5,000 people without power in eastern and southern Ireland. One electric company had over 400 workers on duty to restore power in affected areas. High winds blowing down trees were responsible for power outages which affected 126,000 people in <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>.

The remnants of Gordon affected the United Kingdom with strong winds, including gusts to in the <a href="Isles%20of%20Scilly">Isles of Scilly</a> off the southwest coast and on the mainland. The storm interfered with an archaeological excavation undertaken by <a href="Time%20Team">Time Team</a> at <a href="Mount%20Murray">Mount Murray</a> on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Mann">Isle of Mann</a>, which was broadcast as part of the first episode of the <a href="Time%20Team%20%28series%2014%29">14th series</a>. The storm system produced heavy precipitation and thunderstorms that caused localized flooding. <a href="Wainfleet%2C%20Lincolnshire">Wainfleet, Lincolnshire</a> recorded 1.66 in (42.2 mm) of rainfall, of which almost half fell within the span of an hour. High winds delayed rail service, and in <a href="Dawlish">Dawlish</a>, the rail line was damaged by coastal flooding. More than 1,000 homes were left without power in <a href="Truro">Truro</a>, <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>. The storm brought moist air northward that contributed to record warm temperatures across portions of the UK.

Rock Springs massacre

The Rock Springs massacre, also known as the Rock Springs Riot, occurred on September 2, 1885, in the present-day United States city of <a href="Rock%20Springs%2C%20Wyoming">Rock Springs</a> in <a href="Sweetwater%20County">Sweetwater County</a>, <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>. The riot, and resulting massacre of immigrant Chinese miners by white immigrant miners, was the result of racial prejudice toward the Chinese miners, who were perceived to be taking jobs from the white miners. The <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Coal%20Department">Union Pacific Coal Department</a> found it economically beneficial to give preference in hiring to Chinese miners, who were willing to work for lower wages than their white counterparts, angering the white miners. When the rioting ended, at least 28 Chinese miners were dead and 15 were injured. Rioters burned 78 Chinese homes, resulting in approximately US$150,000 in property damage ($ in present-day terms).

Tension between <a href="Caucasian%20race">whites</a> and <a href="Chinese%20immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">Chinese immigrants</a> in the late 19th century <a href="American%20West">American West</a> was particularly high, especially in the decade preceding the violence. The massacre in Rock Springs was one among several instances of violence culminating from years of <a href="Sinophobia">anti-Chinese</a> sentiment in the United States. The 1882 <a href="Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act">Chinese Exclusion Act</a> suspended Chinese immigration for ten years, but not before thousands of immigrants came to the American West. Most Chinese immigrants to <a href="Wyoming%20Territory">Wyoming Territory</a> took jobs with the railroad at first, but many ended up employed in coal mines owned by the <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railroad">Union Pacific Railroad</a>. As Chinese immigration increased, so did anti-Chinese sentiment on the part of whites. The <a href="Knights%20of%20Labor">Knights of Labor</a>, one of the foremost voices against Chinese immigrant labor, formed a chapter in Rock Springs in 1883, and most rioters were members of that organization. However, no direct connection was ever established linking the riot to the national Knights of Labor organization.

In the immediate aftermath of the riot, <a href="United%20States%20Army">federal troops</a> were deployed in Rock Springs. They escorted the surviving Chinese miners, most of whom had fled to <a href="Evanston%2C%20Wyoming">Evanston, Wyoming</a>, back to Rock Springs a week after the riot. Reaction came swiftly from the era's publications. In Rock Springs, the local newspaper endorsed the outcome of the riot, while in other Wyoming newspapers, support for the riot was limited to sympathy for the causes of the white miners. The massacre in Rock Springs touched off a wave of anti-Chinese violence, especially in the <a href="Puget%20Sound%20region">Puget Sound</a> area of <a href="Washington%20Territory">Washington Territory</a>.

Chinese immigration to the United States at that time was neither uniform nor widespread. <a href="John%20Randolph%20Tucker%20%28politician%29">J. R. Tucker</a>, writing for "<a href="The%20North%20American%20Review">The North American Review</a>" in 1884, stated that the vast majority of the nearly 100,000 Chinese immigrants resided within the <a href="American%20West">American West</a>: California, <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, and the <a href="Washington%20Territory">Washington Territory</a>. The U.S. Minister to China, <a href="George%20Seward">George Seward</a>, had asserted similar numbers in "<a href="Scribner%27s%20Magazine">Scribner's Magazine</a>" five years earlier.

The first jobs Chinese laborers took in Wyoming were on the railroad, working for the <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railroad">Union Pacific company</a> (UP) as <a href="right-of-way%20%28railroad%29">maintenance-of-way</a> workers. Chinese workers soon became an asset to Union Pacific and worked along UP lines and in UP coal mines from <a href="Laramie%2C%20Wyoming">Laramie</a> to Evanston. Most Chinese workers in Wyoming ended up working in <a href="Sweetwater%20County">Sweetwater County</a>, but a large number settled in <a href="Carbon%20County%2C%20Wyoming">Carbon</a> and <a href="Uinta%20County">Uinta</a> counties. Most Chinese people in the area were men working in the mine. Racism against Chinese immigrants was widespread and largely uncontroversial at the time. Tucker, in the aforementioned 1884 article, referred to Asian immigrants as "...the Asiatic race, alien in blood, habits, and civilization". He also noted, "Chinese are the chief element in this Asiatic population."

In 1874–75, after labor unrest disrupted coal production, the Union Pacific Coal Department hired Chinese laborers to work in their coal mines throughout southern Wyoming. Even so, the Chinese population rose slowly at first; however, where there were Chinese immigrants, they were generally concentrated in one area. At Red Desert, a remote section camp in Sweetwater County, there were 20 inhabitants, of whom 12 were Chinese. All 12 were laborers who worked under an American foreman. To the east of <a href="Red%20Desert%20%28Wyoming%29">Red Desert</a> was another remote section camp, Washakie. An American section foreman lived there amongst 23 others, including 13 Chinese laborers and an Irish crew foreman. In the various section camps along the main line of the Union Pacific Railroad, Chinese workers far outnumbered any other nationality. Though the 79 Chinese in Sweetwater County in 1870 represented only 4% of the total population, they were, again, concentrated. In Rock Springs and Green River, the largest towns along the UP line, there were no Chinese residents reported in 1870.

Throughout the 1870s, the Chinese population in Sweetwater County and all of Wyoming steadily increased. During the decade, Wyoming's total population rose from 9,118 to 20,789. In the 1870 <a href="U.S.%20Census">U.S. Census</a>, what the government today calls "Asian and Pacific Islanders" represented 143 members of the population of Wyoming. The increase during the 1870s was the largest percentage increase in the Asian population of Wyoming of any decade since; the increase represented a 539% jump in the Asian population. By 1880, most Chinese residents in Sweetwater County lived in Rock Springs. At that time, Wyoming was home to 914 "Asians"; that number fell significantly during the 1880s to 465.

Although most Chinese workers in 1880 were employed in the coal mines around Wyoming and Sweetwater County, the Chinese in Rock Springs worked mostly in occupations outside of mining. In addition to Chinese laborers and miners, a professional gambler, a priest, a cook, and a barber resided in the city. In <a href="Green%20River%2C%20Wyoming">Green River, Wyoming</a>, there was a Chinese doctor. Chinese servants and waiters found work in Green River and in <a href="Fort%20Washakie">Fort Washakie</a>. In <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20Wyoming">Atlantic City</a>, <a href="Miner%27s%20Delight%2C%20Wyoming">Miner's Delight</a>, and <a href="Red%20Canyon%20%28Fremont%20County%2C%20Wyoming%29">Red Canyon, Wyoming</a>, Chinese gold miners were employed. However, the majority of the 193 Chinese residing in Sweetwater County by 1880 worked in the coal mines or on the railroad.

The riot was the result of a combination of racial prejudice and general resentment against Union Pacific. In 1882, the <a href="Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act">Chinese Exclusion Act</a> required that "... from and after the expiration of ninety days next after the passage of this act, and until the expiration of ten years next after the passage of this act, the coming of Chinese laborers to the United States be, and the same is hereby, suspended; and during such suspension it shall not be lawful for any Chinese laborer to come." In the years preceding the Rock Springs massacre, the importation of Chinese labor was seen as a "system worse than slavery". The white miners at Rock Springs, being mostly <a href="Cornwall">Cornish</a>, Irish, <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a>, and Welsh immigrants, believed lower-paid Chinese laborers drove down their wages.

The Chinese at Rock Springs were aware of the animosity and rising racial tension with white miners, but had not taken any precautions, as no prior events indicated there would be any race riots. Underlying the outbreak of violence were racism and resentment of the policies of the Union Pacific Coal Department. Until 1875, the mines in Rock Springs were worked by whites; in that year, a strike occurred, and the strikers were replaced with Chinese <a href="strikebreaker">strikebreaker</a>s less than two weeks after the strike began. The company resumed mining with 50 white miners and 150 Chinese miners in its employ. As more Chinese arrived in Rock Springs, bitterness from the white miners increased. At the time of the massacre, there were about 150 white miners and 331 Chinese miners in Rock Springs.

In the two years before the massacre, a "Whitemen's Town" was established in Rock Springs. By 1883, the Knights of Labor organized a chapter in Rock Springs. The Knights were one of the major groups which spearheaded opposition to Chinese labor during the 1880s; in 1882, the Knights had worked for the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act. No evidence has been uncovered to prove that the national Knights of Labor organization was behind the massacre at Rock Springs. In August 1885, notices were posted from Evanston to Rock Springs, demanding the expulsion of Chinese immigrants, and on the evening of September 1, 1885, one day before the violence, white miners in Rock Springs held a meeting about the Chinese immigrants. It was rumored that threats were made that night against the Chinese, according to immigrants then residing there.

At 7:00 a.m. on September 2, 1885, ten white men, in ordinary garb and miner's uniforms, arrived at coal pit number six at the Rock Springs mine. They declared that the Chinese laborers had no right to work in a particularly desirable "room" in the mine; miners were paid by the ton, thus location was important to the miners. A fight broke out, and two Chinese workers at pit number six were badly beaten. One of the Chinese workers later died due to his injuries. The white miners, most of whom were members of the <a href="Knights%20of%20Labor">Knights of Labor</a>, walked out of the mine.

After the work stoppage at pit number six, more white miners assembled near the town. They marched to Rock Springs by way of the railroad, carrying firearms. At about 10:00 a.m., the bell in the Knights of Labor meeting hall tolled, and the miners inside the building joined the already large group. There were white miners who opted to go to saloons instead of joining the gathering mob, but by 2:00 p.m., the saloons and grocers were persuaded by a Union Pacific official to close.

With the saloons and grocers closed, about 150 men, armed with <a href="Winchester%20rifle">Winchester rifle</a>s, moved toward <a href="Chinatown">Chinatown</a> in Rock Springs. They moved in two groups and entered Chinatown by crossing separate bridges. The larger group entered by way of the railroad bridge and was divided into squads, a few of which remained standing on the opposite side of the bridge outside Chinatown. The smaller group entered by way of the town's plank bridge.

Squads from the larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a position at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the <a href="pump%20house">pump house</a>. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown. They warned the Chinese they had one hour to pack up and leave town. After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot and fell to the ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went. The smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.

As the white miners moved into Chinatown, the Chinese became aware of the riot and that Leo Dye Bah and Yip Ah Marn, residents from the west and east sides of Chinatown, had already been killed. As the news of the murders spread, the Chinese fled in fear and confusion. They ran in every direction: up the hill behind coal pit number three; others, along the base of the hill at coal pit number four; others still, from the eastern end of town, fled across <a href="Bitter%20Creek%20%28Wyoming%29">Bitter Creek</a> to the opposite hill; and more fled the western end of Chinatown across the base of the hill to the right of coal pit number five. The mob came from three directions by this time, from the east and west ends of town and from the wagon road. The Chinese immigrants present at the Rock Springs massacre presented their own grisly account of the <a href="m%C3%AAl%C3%A9e">mêlée</a> to the Chinese consul in New York City: 

By 3:30 p.m. the massacre was well under way. A group of women in Rock Springs had gathered at the plank bridge, where they stood and cheered on the rampage. Two of the women reportedly fired shots at the Chinese. As the riot wore on into the night, the Chinese miners scattered into the hills, lying in the grass to hide. Between four and nine p.m., rioters set fire to the camp houses belonging to the coal company. By nine p.m., all but one Chinese camp house was burned completely. In all, 79 Chinese homes were destroyed by fire. Damage to Chinese-owned property was estimated at around $147,000.

Some Chinese died on the banks of Bitter Creek as they fled, others near the railroad bridge as they attempted to escape Chinatown. The rioters threw Chinese bodies into the flames of burning buildings. Other Chinese immigrants, who had hidden in their houses instead of fleeing, were murdered, and then their bodies were burned with their houses. Those who could not run, including the sick, were burned alive in their camp houses. Many of the Chinese who were burned in their houses apparently tried "to dig a hole in the cellar to hide themselves. But the fire overtook them when about half way in the hole, burning their lower limbs to a crisp and leaving the upper trunk untouched." One remaining Chinese immigrant was found dead in a laundry house in Whitemen's Town, his home demolished by rioters.

The attacks at Rock Springs were extraordinarily violent, revealing a long-held, almost "<a href="feral">feral</a>", hatred of the victims. The sheer brutality of the violence "startled" the entire country. Besides those who were burned alive, Chinese miners were scalped, mutilated, <a href="Human%20branding">branded</a>, decapitated, dismembered, and hanged from gutter spouts. One of the Chinese miners' penis and testicles were cut off and toasted in a nearby saloon as a "trophy of the hunt". The events amounted to racial terrorism.

There were 28 "confirmed deaths", and at least 15 miners were wounded. But various sources assert that 40 to 50 fatalities might be a more accurate number, as some of those who fled were never accounted for. The Chinese consul in New York City compiled a <a href="List%20of%20victims%20of%20the%20Rock%20Springs%20massacre">detailed list of the massacre's victims</a>.




In the days following the riot, surviving Chinese immigrants in Rock Springs fled and were picked up by Union Pacific trains. By September 5, almost all survivors were in <a href="Evanston%2C%20Wyoming">Evanston, Wyoming</a>, west of Rock Springs. Once there, they were subjected to threats of murder and other crimes; Evanston was another area in Wyoming where anti-Chinese sentiment was high.

Rumors of the return of the Chinese to Rock Springs circulated immediately after the riots. On September 3, the "Rock Springs Independent" published an editorial which confirmed the rumors of "the return", as a few Chinese began to trickle back into town to search for valuables. "The Independent" said of the return of Chinese laborers to Rock Springs, "It means that Rock Springs is killed, as far as white men are concerned, if such program is carried out." The massacre was defended in the local newspaper, and, to an extent, in other western newspapers. In general, however, Wyoming newspapers disapproved of the acts of the massacre while supporting the cause of white miners.

Wyoming's territorial Governor <a href="Francis%20E.%20Warren">Francis E. Warren</a> visited Rock Springs on September 3, 1885, the day after the riot, to make a personal assessment. After his trip to Rock Springs, Warren traveled to Evanston, where he sent telegrams to U.S. President <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> appealing for federal troops. Back in Rock Springs, the riot had calmed, but the situation was still unstable. Two companies of the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>'s <a href="7th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">7th Infantry</a> arrived on September 5, 1885. One company, under the command of a Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, was stationed in Evanston, Wyoming; the other, under a Colonel Chipman, was stationed in Rock Springs. At <a href="Murray%2C%20Utah%23A%20new%20settlement">Camp Murray</a>, <a href="Utah%20Territory">Utah Territory</a>, Colonel <a href="Alexander%20McDowell%20McCook">Alexander McDowell McCook</a> was ordered to augment the garrison sent to Wyoming with six more companies.

On September 9, 1885, one week after the massacre, six companies of soldiers arrived in <a href="Wyoming%20Territory">Wyoming</a>. Four of the six companies then escorted the Chinese back to Rock Springs. Once back in Rock Springs, the Chinese laborers found scorched tracts of land where their homes once stood. The mining company had buried only a few dead; others remained lying in the open, mangled, decomposing, and partially eaten by dogs, hogs, or other animals.

The situation in Rock Springs was stabilized as early as September 15, when Warren first requested the removal of federal troops, but the mines at Rock Springs remained closed for a time. On September 30, 1885, white miners, mostly <a href="Finnish%20people">Finnish</a> immigrants who were members of the Knights of Labor, walked out of mines in <a href="Carbon%20County%2C%20Wyoming">Carbon County, Wyoming</a>, in protest of the company's continued use of Chinese miners. In Rock Springs, the white miners were not back at work in late September, because the company still used Chinese labor. Rock Springs steadily became quieter, and, on October 5, 1885, emergency troops, except for two companies, were removed. However, the temporary posts of Camp Medicine Butte, established in Evanston, and of Camp Pilot Butte, in Rock Springs, remained long after the riot. Camp Pilot Butte closed in 1899 after the onset of the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>.

The labor strike was unsuccessful, and the miners went back to work within a couple of months. The national Knights of Labor organization refused to support the Carbon strike and the hold out by white miners in Rock Springs following the Rock Springs Riot. The organization avoided supporting the miners along the <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railroad">Union Pacific Railroad</a>, because it did not want to be seen as condoning the violence at Rock Springs. When the <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Coal%20Department">Union Pacific Coal Department</a> reopened the mines, it fired 45 white miners connected to the violence.

After the riot in Rock Springs, sixteen men were arrested, including Isaiah Washington, a member-elect to the territorial legislature. The men were taken to jail in <a href="Green%20River%2C%20Wyoming">Green River</a>, where they were held until after a Sweetwater County <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> refused to bring indictments. In explaining its decision, the grand jury declared that there was no cause for legal action, stating, in part: "We have diligently inquired into the occurrence at Rock Springs. ... [T]hough we have examined a large number of witnesses, no one has been able to testify to a single criminal act committed by any known white person that day."

Those arrested as suspects in the riot were released a little more than a month later, on October 7, 1885. On their release, they were "...met ... by several hundred men, women and children, and treated to a regular <a href="ovation">ovation</a>", according to "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>". The defendants in the Rock Springs case enjoyed the same broad community consent that <a href="Lynching">lynch mob</a>s often received. No person or persons were ever convicted in the violence at Rock Springs.

After the riot, the <a href="U.S.%20government">U.S. government</a> hesitated to make amends to the Chinese for the massacre. In China, the <a href="governor-general">governor-general</a> of the <a href="Guangdong">Guangdong</a> region suggested that Americans in China might be the target of revenge for the events in Rock Springs. The American envoy to China, <a href="Charles%20Harvey%20Denby">Charles Harvey Denby</a>, and others in the diplomatic corps reported rising anti-American sentiment in Hong Kong and in <a href="Guangzhou">Canton</a>, Guangdong, following the riot. American diplomats warned their government that the backlash from the massacre could ruin U.S. trade with China; they also reported that <a href="British%20Empire">British</a> merchants and newspapers in China were encouraging the Chinese to "stand up for their oppressed countrymen in America." Denby advised that U.S. Secretary of State <a href="Thomas%20F.%20Bayard">Thomas Bayard</a> obtain compensation for the victims of the massacre.

The <a href="United%20States%20government">United States government</a> agreed to pay compensation for the damaged property but not for the actual victims of the massacre, although Bayard was inclined to resist the requests for payments. In a letter to the minister of China's Washington <a href="legation">legation</a> dated February 18, 1886, he expressed a personal view that the violence against Chinese immigrants was precipitated by their resistance to <a href="cultural%20assimilation">cultural assimilation</a>, and that racism against Chinese was typically found among other immigrants rather than the majority of the populace: Denby's predictions caused Bayard to seek a Congressionally appropriated <a href="indemnity">indemnity</a>. At Bayard's urging, the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> provided <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>147,748.74 as an indemnity. The compensation was made as a monetary gift and not as a legal decree of responsibility for the massacre and the outcome amounted to a minor diplomatic victory for China.

Correspondence between Wyoming's territorial Governor, Francis Warren, and Union Pacific officials during Warren's term in office indicate that he petitioned the company for years to clear the titles on land he owned. He condemned the riot as "the most brutal and damnable outrage that ever occurred in any country."

After the riot, rhetoric and reaction came from publications and key political figures concerning the events. "The New York Times" blasted the city of Rock Springs in the first of at least two editorials on the topic, stating, "the appropriate fate for a community of this kind would be that of <a href="Sodom%20and%20Gomorrah">Sodom and Gomorrah</a>". In another "Times" editorial on November 10, 1885, the paper continued to assail not only the residents of Rock Springs who were involved in the violence, but those who stood by and let the mob continue its behavior. Newspapers in Wyoming, such as the "Cheyenne Tribune" and the "<a href="Laramie%20Boomerang">Laramie Boomerang</a>", reacted with sympathy toward the white miners. The "Boomerang" stated it "regretted" the riot but found extenuating circumstances surrounding the violence.

In addition to newspapers, anti-Chinese sentiment and stereotypes came from other publications. Religious publications, such as "Baptist Missionary Magazine", depicted the Chinese as "heathens." "The Chautauquan: A Weekly Newsmagazine" characterized the Chinese as weak and defenseless, stating in its coverage of the massacre: "To murder an industrious <a href="Chinaman%20%28term%29">Chinaman</a> is the same kind of fiendish work as the murder of women and children – it is equally a violation of the rights of the defenceless."

<a href="Knights%20of%20Labor">Knights of Labor</a> leader <a href="Terence%20Powderly">Terence Powderly</a> wrote in a letter to W.W. Stone (excerpts of which he included in a report to the U.S. Congress) that, "It is not necessary for me to speak of the numerous reasons given for the opposition to this particular race – their habits, religion, customs and practices ..." Powderly blamed the "problem" of Chinese immigration on the failings of the 1882 Exclusion Act. He faulted lax law enforcement, not those involved in the riots, for the attacks at Rock Springs. Powderly wrote that the U.S. Congress should stop "winking at violations of this statute" and reform the laws which barred Chinese immigration, which he believed could have prevented incidents such as "the recent assault upon the Chinese at Rock Springs".

In December 1885, U.S. President <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> presented his <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union">State of the Union</a> report to Congress, and in it, his reaction to the Rock Springs massacre. Cleveland's report pointed out that the United States was interested in good relations with China. He stated, "All of the power of this government should be exhorted to maintain the amplest good faith towards China in the treatment of these men, and the inflexible sternness of the law ... must be insisted upon ... race prejudice is the chief factor to originating these disturbances".

The massacre at Rock Springs led to other incidents of anti-Chinese aggression, primarily in Washington Territory, though there were incidents in Oregon and other states as well. Near <a href="Newcastle%2C%20Washington">Newcastle, Washington</a> a mob of whites burned down the barracks of 36 Chinese coal miners. Throughout the <a href="Puget%20Sound%20region">Puget Sound</a> area, Chinese workers were driven out of communities and subject to violence in Washington cities and towns, including <a href="Tacoma%2C%20Washington">Tacoma</a>, <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, <a href="Newcastle%2C%20Washington">Newcastle</a>, and <a href="Issaquah%2C%20Washington">Issaquah</a>. Chinese workers were driven out of other Washington towns, but sources indicated, as early as 1891, that the above events were specifically connected to the wave of violence touched off at Rock Springs.

The wave of anti-Chinese violence in the western United States following the Rock Springs Riot spread further, to the state of Oregon. Mobs drove Chinese workers out of small towns throughout the state in late 1885 and mid-1886. Other states reported incidents as well: As far away as <a href="Augusta%2C%20Georgia">Augusta, Georgia</a>, anger was expressed against the Chinese in response to the massacre at Rock Springs. According to "The New York Times", the rioting in Rock Springs fueled the desire of anti-Chinese Georgians in Augusta to air their grievances.

The Rock Springs massacre was seen by observers at the time, and by historians today, as the worst and most significant instance of anti-Chinese violence in the 19th century United States. The riot received widespread media coverage from publications such as "<a href="National%20Police%20Gazette">The National Police Gazette</a>" and "The New York Times". Among the events of anti-Chinese violence in the American west, the Rock Springs massacre is considered the most widely publicized.

Today, nearly all historians hold the view that the prime factor which contributed to the riot was <a href="racism">race prejudice</a>. However, a 1990 work on the Rock Springs massacre, written by journalist <a href="Craig%20Storti">Craig Storti</a>, marginalized the racial factor and put a stronger emphasis on the economic factors which contributed to violence. His book, "Incident at Bitter Creek: The Rock Springs Massacre", was widely criticized in reviews, though Storti stated he represented the historical record as it stood. There were labor considerations that contributed to the violence in Rock Springs, though they are generally seen as less significant. The use of Chinese workers by the railroad during an 1875 strike created widespread resentment among the white miners, which continued to build until the Rock Springs massacre. Storti's book described anti-Chinese racism as "pervasive" even while downplaying its significance to the riot. The view that the Chinese refused to
<a href="Americanization%20%28immigration%29">assimilate into American culture</a> was held historically and still carries some weight in present-day interpretations of the historical record.

Present-day Rock Springs has a population pushing 20,000. The former settlement is a full-fledged city. The area that once encompassed Camp Pilot Butte is located on the north bank of Bitter Creek, in the northwest part of the city. The camp covered acres of Union Pacific property; the parade ground was in the center of a present-day city block bounded by Soulsby Street on the west, Pilot Butte Avenue on the east, Bridger Avenue on the north and Elias Avenue on its south. In 1973, the area where the army post once existed was listed on the U.S. <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> as a <a href="historic%20district">historic district</a>. At that time, there were only two remaining original structures. The two buildings were owned by the Saints Cyril and Methodius Catholic Church in Rock Springs. The buildings are no longer extant, and the property is no longer listed on the National Register. The area that was once Chinatown, just north of where Camp Pilot Butte once stood, had a public elementary school built over part of it. In general, the locations in Rock Springs associated with the massacre have been surrounded and absorbed by the city's growth.

A Weekend in the City

A Weekend in the City is the second studio album by British <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a> band <a href="Bloc%20Party">Bloc Party</a>. It was recorded at <a href="Grouse%20Lodge">Grouse Lodge</a> Studios in <a href="Westmeath">Westmeath</a>, Ireland, in mid-2006 and was produced by <a href="Jacknife%20Lee">Jacknife Lee</a>. The album was refined and <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> at several locations in London at the end of 2006. It was released on 24 January 2007 in Japan and in the first week of February in the rest of the world, with <a href="Wichita%20Recordings">Wichita Recordings</a> as the primary label. The album peaked at number two on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a> and on the <a href="Irish%20Albums%20Chart">Irish Albums Chart</a>. In the United States, it entered the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> at number 12.

Bloc Party worked to craft an album that distanced them from the conventional guitar band set-up by incorporating more electronically processed beats and additional instrumentation. Computer programs were extensively used to enrich and amend recorded takes, while a <a href="string%20section">string sextet</a> was hired to perform on some of the tracks. The subject matter of <a href="frontman">frontman</a> and chief lyricist <a href="Kele%20Okereke">Kele Okereke</a>'s lyrics for "A Weekend in the City" covers issues such as drug use, sexuality, and terrorism. The album's three original singles, "<a href="The%20Prayer%20%28Bloc%20Party%20song%29">The Prayer</a>", "<a href="I%20Still%20Remember">I Still Remember</a>", and "<a href="Hunting%20for%20Witches">Hunting for Witches</a>", address these themes respectively.

Bloc Party's new musical directions and more forthright lyrics either impressed or alienated critics. Reviewers generally treated "A Weekend in the City" as an important stepping stone for the band members in their quest for musical maturity, while "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" included it in its list of the "1000 Albums To Hear Before You Die". In November 2007, the album was re-released globally—with the final single, "<a href="Flux%20%28song%29">Flux</a>", as a bonus track—to coincide with Bloc Party's extensive touring schedule.

All band members of Bloc Party conceived "A Weekend in the City" during 2005 while on tour in support of their critically acclaimed debut album "<a href="Silent%20Alarm">Silent Alarm</a>". Despite missing their home city of London, the quartet became increasingly disillusioned with the culture in the area each time they sporadically returned. Band member <a href="Gordon%20Moakes">Gordon Moakes</a> has noted, "The contrast we saw between being away on tour and being home ... we would see that London wasn't changing really and that the people we'd grown up with were part of that." Okereke wrote many songs in 2005 and early 2006 and used a concept he called "Urbanite Relaxation" to expand upon the themes of life and leisure in the <a href="metropolis">metropolis</a>. The band recorded around 30 <a href="soundcheck">soundcheck</a>s for the initial lyrics using a <a href="MiniDisc">MiniDisc</a> player. The rest of the tracks were written in April 2006 before they entered the studio recording process.

The band members drew up a shortlist of possible producers in early 2006, which included <a href="dance%20music">dance music</a>-oriented staff such as <a href="Chemical%20Brothers">Chemical Brothers</a> <a href="sound%20engineer">sound engineer</a> Steve Dub and high-profile producers like <a href="Garret%20%26quot%3BJacknife%26quot%3B%20Lee">Garret "Jacknife" Lee</a>. At the time, Moakes told "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" that the album would hopefully include electronic, processed beats and a sound in the vein of <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="Radiohead">Radiohead</a> and <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a> ensemble <a href="TV%20on%20the%20Radio">TV on the Radio</a>. Bloc Party wanted to expand their sonic palette without losing the musical "jerkiness" of "Silent Alarm". They selected Lee—who had worked with world-renowned act <a href="U2">U2</a> and indie rock band <a href="Snow%20Patrol">Snow Patrol</a>—based on the rapport that developed between the two parties while recording the demo song "I Still Remember", which later appeared in "A Weekend in the City".

Moakes has explained the choice of producer by stating that the band members were looking to work with someone who could help them craft an accomplished album, "although as much as anything it's about finding someone who you'd want to spend six weeks in an enclosed space with". Before the studio sessions, Bloc Party listened to varied musical sources, from composers <a href="Philip%20Glass">Philip Glass</a>, <a href="Gy%C3%B6rgy%20Ligeti">György Ligeti</a>, and <a href="Krzysztof%20Penderecki">Krzysztof Penderecki</a> to urban artists <a href="Amerie">Amerie</a> and <a href="Missy%20Elliott">Missy Elliott</a>. The band members were largely disillusioned with the evolution of contemporary guitar music and aimed to re-create the highly stylised production values of <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> and <a href="hip-hop">hip-hop</a> records, while relying on an atmosphere similar to <a href="neo-classical%20music">neo-classical music</a>.

In mid-2006, Bloc Party travelled to Lee's Grouse Lodge Studios in Westmeath, Ireland, to record "A Weekend in the City". The band members initially worked by experimenting with their respective instruments and sound check arrangements. Moakes additionally focused on using different types of synthesiser. All parties soon moved to the main recording room, a large area with "a lot of natural ambience" according to sound engineer Tom McFall. A makeshift booth was built around the back of the drum kit to reduce any sonic interference, while a roof was sometimes used over drummer Matt Tong to isolate a pure sound. Different types of microphones were used for each component of the drum kit. The <a href="microphone">miking</a> scheme was crucial to prepare the drum tracks for the <a href="loop%20%28music%29">looping</a> and processing Lee planned using production program <a href="Logic%20Pro">Logic</a>.

The band worked by setting up all the instruments with only a single <a href="power%20amplifier">power amplifier</a>. McFall has pointed out that distorted and heavily <a href="dynamic%20range%20compression">compressed</a> mics were used to capture some of the room's ambience "to add a bit of grit" to the instrumental tracks; the recordings were often processed further using distressors, special types of compressor noted for their distinctively aggressive sound. The production staff tried other unconventional effects once the basic tracks were recorded. The band sometimes performed while Tong's kit was <a href="reamping">re-amped</a> and played sections live while a brick was placed on the <a href="sustain%20pedal">sustain pedal</a> of a piano to capture the vibrations during the performances. During the six weeks at Grouse Lodge, Bloc Party tried multiple versions of songs and, at times, attempted playing live alongside recorded versions of the same track.

Lee recorded everything using <a href="Digital%20Audio%20Workstation">Digital Audio Workstation</a> <a href="Pro%20Tools">Pro Tools</a> and treated the parts as individual stereo files in Logic. The drum and guitar tracks were processed using computers. Much of the synthesiser-sounding parts of the album were generated by <a href="Russell%20Lissack">Russell Lissack</a>'s lead guitar following his extensive use of <a href="guitar%20pedal">pedal</a> effects. Lee added the live string, synth, <a href="drum%20machine">drum machine</a>, <a href="sample%20%28music%29">sample</a>, and ambient noise tracks to create an expansive, hyper-<a href="stereophonic%20sound">stereophonic</a> final product. After finishing the instrumental album, Bloc Party left Ireland to continue touring. Okereke later returned to Lee's studio to add the vocal tracks to the album; he has noted that he tried to "convey <a href="range%20%28music%29">range</a> and <a href="dynamics%20%28music%29">dynamics</a>" rather than simply yelp the lyrics. Several track names were changed following the voice sessions: "Merge on the Freeway" became "Song for Clay (Disappear Here)", "A Prayer to the Lord" was renamed "The Prayer", "Wet" became "On", and "Perfect Teens" was renamed "Where Is Home?".

Bloc Party confirmed a preliminary track list of 13 songs in August 2006; this included future bonus tracks "England" and "We Were Lovers". A low-quality <a href="ripping">rip</a> of "A Weekend in the City" was <a href="internet%20leak">leaked</a> in November and showed a track list of 11 songs. Wichita Recordings did not comment, but the band members were quoted as being worried about a reduction in the potential impact of the album's content and sales. Bloc Party started a promotional tour of North America the same month with <a href="Panic%21%20at%20the%20Disco">Panic! at the Disco</a>, but cut it short after three concerts when Tong suffered a <a href="pneumothorax">collapsed lung</a>. The focus was changed to interviews throughout the world to explain the album's stylised lyrics and composition in the run-up to its release.

Final tweaks on the album were completed in December 2006 in London. A high-quality version was leaked in January 2007 and its contents were confirmed by Okereke. Journalists who obtained an official copy of the album's final mix suggested that it featured <a href="electronic%20music">electronically</a> tampered rock soundscapes in the vein of Radiohead, <a href="New%20Order%20%28band%29">New Order</a>, and <a href="Bj%C3%B6rk">Björk</a>. Bloc Party previewed "A Weekend in the City" in its entirety on 24 January 2007 at the <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> Old Firestation, a performance which coincided with the Japanese release of the album. The first single, "The Prayer", was released on 29 January. The band performed at a special <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a> showcase at <a href="Maida%20Vale%20Studios">Maida Vale Studios</a> on 30 January as a precursor to a February promotional tour of the UK.

The album was released in the rest of the world in the first week of February. The title comes as a tangent to the central theme of the album, "the living noise of a metropolis". The <a href="cover%20art">cover art</a> is part of "A Modern Project" by German photographer <a href="Rut%20Blees%20Luxemburg">Rut Blees Luxemburg</a>, famous for her night <a href="cityscape">cityscape</a>s of London and for the cover art of <a href="The%20Streets">The Streets</a>' "<a href="Original%20Pirate%20Material">Original Pirate Material</a>". The photograph is an aerial image of <a href="Westway%20%28London%29">London's Westway</a>, which shows the road and the adjacent sports pitches lit by the <a href="sodium%20light">sodium glow</a> of street lamps, and was chosen because the band believed "it was important we captured London breathing". Luxemburg has explained that "in this picture you can see how intricately and optimistically public space in the city is shared".

Okereke's lyrics attempt to juxtapose the monotonous events—nights out on club dancefloors and waiting for a train—with the seemingly epic experiences—terrorist attacks and racial angst—witnessed in a city environment. The direct narrative approach divided reviewers. <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s Tom Young concluded, "Some will appreciate Kele's openness and revel in his philosophical focus on modern lives ... others will be too distracted by questionable content such as ... lines about <a href="sudoku">sudoku</a> to take Okereke's grumbles into consideration." Okereke has conceded that he was disappointed with the abstraction in "Silent Alarm"; he used <a href="The%20Smiths">The Smiths</a> as inspiration to try to make a personal album with "a real centre". The lyricist has noted, "I wanted it to be a snapshot, a frozen moment in time. Like in a city, with thousands of stories going on at once, layered on top of each other ... Although I might be speaking through the voice of a character, I'm still expressing, perhaps, my sentiments."
The words to "Where Is Home?" begin at the funeral of <a href="Murder%20of%20Christopher%20Alaneme">Christopher Alaneme</a>, a black teenager stabbed to death in Kent in April 2006 in a racially motivated attack. Okereke has described him as a "cousin" due to their Nigerian mothers' close friendship. The track castigates right-wing newspapers for perpetuating a hysterical fear of black youths in hoodies, an action which often leads to opportunities being denied to the <a href="Black%20British">Black British</a> community at large. Populist media is also the target of "Hunting for Witches" (with the right-wing tabloid "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" being singled out for criticism), whose subject matter is terrorism, namely the <a href="7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings">7 July 2005 London bombings</a>. Okereke has stated, "I guess the point about the song for me is post-<a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11th</a>, the media has really traded on fear and the use of fear in controlling people."
Two songs, "Kreuzberg" and "I Still Remember", explore sexuality and homosexuality; the former is an account of promiscuity in the <a href="Kreuzberg">Berlin area of the same name</a>, while the latter details an unrequited crush of a boy for his schoolmate.

The leading track, "Song for Clay (Disappear Here)", was inspired by "<a href="Less%20Than%20Zero%20%28novel%29">"Less Than Zero"</a>", a novel by <a href="Bret%20Easton%20Ellis">Bret Easton Ellis</a> which depicts excessive hedonism and its effects on individuals. The song title references the protagonist Clay and a billboard in the book which displays the phrase "Disappear Here", while the action is relocated to Les Trois Garçons restaurant in <a href="Shoreditch">Shoreditch</a>, East London. "Waiting for the 7.18" provides an escapist counterpoint by mentioning a trip to <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a> following disillusionment with working life in the capital. The fifth song on "A Weekend in the City", "Uniform", references London again and criticises the youth subculture in the area. It is directly inspired by <a href="Douglas%20Rushkoff">Douglas Rushkoff</a>'s "Merchants of Cool" documentary, which details the corporate exploitation of popular culture by advertisement companies.

Okereke read <a href="Guy%20Debord">Guy Debord</a>'s "The Society of the Spectacle" and <a href="Henri%20Lefebvre">Henri Lefebvre</a>'s "Critique of Everyday Life", works which analyse how people experience leisure in modern societies, and was inspired to pen several songs which detail the drug and drink culture present in a metropolis. "The Prayer" is based on drug use during nights out in clubs, while "On" specifies the effects and after-effects of <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a>. Okereke tried to treat the tracks as explanations of people's actions, rather than moralising tales; he has stated, "In a time when so many people feel they can't communicate or feel hemmed in, I can see the appeal of cocaine." "Sunday" details the morning-after hangover following a drunken and promiscuous night out, while "SRXT" takes the form of a suicide note following the loneliness and despair of hedonism in the metropolis. The album closer is named after Seroxat, a trade name for the <a href="antidepressant">antidepressant</a> <a href="paroxetine">paroxetine</a>, and was crafted following the suicide attempts of two of Okereke's friends after they left university in 2005.

"A Weekend in the City" is largely built around a mix of distorted and layered guitars, electronic elements, and multilayered vocals. The creation of compositions required a high level of technical proficiency and led to songs "tinged with discord". The opening section of "Song for Clay (Disappear Here)" includes a bare <a href="falsetto">falsetto</a>, while "Hunting for Witches" starts with a <a href="John%20Cage">John Cage</a>-like <a href="collage">collage</a> of spliced voices from random radio broadcasts as its main rhythm. The rest of the second track makes extensive use of guitar pedal effects and includes a heavily distorted riff. Moakes has pointed out that the original sound check of "Waiting for the 7.18" was a <a href="ballad">ballad</a> with a simple rhythmic pattern on the <a href="glockenspiel">glockenspiel</a> before the band members added a <a href="drum%20and%20bass">drum and bass</a> section to its second half. "Kreuzberg", "I Still Remember", and "Sunday" are the few songs to provide a counterpoint to the musical manipulation on the rest of the album by having more conventional indie rock arrangements; Moakes has called the compositions "lush, without being too syrupy".

In "A Weekend in the City", layered vocals are often used to resemble choral sections, for example in the middle of "The Prayer" and throughout "Uniform", which has over 100 stacked vocal tracks. "SRXT" is a <a href="chimes">chiming</a> ballad directly inspired by <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a>'s "<a href="Before%20and%20after%20Science%23Track%20listing">By This River</a>" and incorporates double-tracked lead and <a href="background%20vocals">background vocals</a>. Synthetic aspects—drum machines, synths, and computer <a href="glitches">glitches</a>—were included as integral parts of compositions. "The Prayer" is built around a computer sample and includes <a href="MTV%20Base">MTV Base</a>-inspired <a href="urban%20contemporary">urban contemporary</a> beats and a prominent <a href="guitar%20solo">guitar solo</a> towards the end. "On" is also a computer-reworked live <a href="take">take</a>. Half of the song was recorded as a series of loops of drum beats and bass guitar chords. The recorded take was split in two to make up the first and last quarters of the track, while the middle section was intentionally left blank for the band to improvise in. "On" is one of two songs, together with "Where Is Home?", to use a string sextet. The latter track includes erratic rhythms and clashing guitars.

Media response to "A Weekend in the City" was mixed, but generally positive; aggregating website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> reports a <a href="standard%20score">normalised</a> rating of 65% based on 30 critical reviews. Louis Pattison of "<a href="NME">NME</a>" described the album as "tender and reflective, edgy and embittered; a difficult and emotional beast that jolts with nervous electricity" and pointed out that its notable achievement is that it finds moments of genuine contentment amidst "a maelstrom of anger and confusion". <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a>'s Heather Phares did not find the album as immediate as Bloc Party's earlier work, but noted that "its gradual move from <a href="social%20alienation">alienation</a> to connection and hope is just as bold as "Silent Alarm", and possibly even more resonant". <a href="Drowned%20in%20Sound">Drowned in Sound</a>'s Mike Diver called it "dirty, dishevelled, unsure and paranoid; fearful, easily distracted, boisterous and ashamed; reckless, wild, nervous and terrified; graceful, thought-provoking, clumsy and contradictory ... and very nearly perfect." Jeff Miller of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" concluded, "For Bloc Party, "Silent Alarm" was a baby step and this is a giant leap."

Michael Endelman of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" was less receptive and stated, "Too often, the music on "A Weekend in the City" is less memorable than the ambitious subject matter." <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>, reviewing for "Rolling Stone", suggested that the album fails because it lacks "killer choruses", while Sia Michel of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that the multitracked vocals and baroque effects do not have "the wiry catchiness" of Bloc Party's previous work. Mike Schiller of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> commented that the sonic direction the band had moved to was unsuited to the members' musical strengths, while Dorian Lynskey of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" stated "grand statements are not earnest frontman Kele Okereke's forte...there's barely a song that isn't kneecapped by one of Okereke's lyrical clangers".

The album was named by "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" in its unnumbered shortlist of the best releases of 2007. It figured in several other end-of-year best album lists, notably, at number eight by <a href="Gigwise">Gigwise</a>, at number nine by "<a href="Hot%20Press">Hot Press</a>", and at number ten by "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>". "The Guardian" included "A Weekend in the City" in its "1000 Albums To Hear Before You Die" list compiled in November 2007 and praised the band's "ambitious indie soundscapes packing a sizeable political punch".

"A Weekend in the City" was a commercial success and entered the UK Albums Chart, the Irish Albums Chart, and the <a href="ARIA%20Charts">Australian Albums Chart</a> at number two. The album was listed at number 56 on the end-of-year UK Albums Chart for 2007 and was certified <a href="gold%20album">Gold</a> by the <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">British Phonographic Industry</a>. In the US, it sold 47,726 copies in its first week of release and entered the "Billboard" 200 at number twelve, a marked improvement on predecessor "Silent Alarm" which had only made number 114 when it was released in 2005. The album also topped the <a href="Billboard%20Top%20Independent%20Albums">"Billboard" Top Independent Albums</a>. According to <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a>, it had sold 148,000 copies in the US by August 2008. More than one million copies have been sold worldwide.

The first single, "The Prayer", became Bloc Party's highest charting song on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> and on the <a href="Irish%20Singles%20Chart">Irish Singles Chart</a> to date by peaking at number four and number 18 respectively. The song reached number 20 in Australia and is the band's only <a href="Australian%20Singles%20Chart">Australian Singles Chart</a> career entry. The next single and the first US release from the album, "I Still Remember", entered the <a href="Hot%20Modern%20Rock%20Tracks">Hot Modern Rock Tracks</a> at number 24 and became the band's highest charting US single to date. The third single, "Hunting for Witches", failed to chart in the US, but peaked at number 22 in the UK.

Bloc Party started a lengthy promotional world tour for "A Weekend in the City" in March 2007, which included concerts in Japan, the US—where they also headlined at the <a href="SXSW">SXSW</a> Festival in Austin, Texas—Canada, and Italy. A few UK performances in mid-April were followed by a month-long headlining tour with <a href="Biffy%20Clyro">Biffy Clyro</a>, which covered most of mainland Europe.

The World Ends with You

The World Ends with You is an <a href="action%20role-playing%20game">action role-playing game</a> with <a href="urban%20fantasy">urban fantasy</a> elements developed by <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a> and <a href="Jupiter%20%28company%29">Jupiter</a> for the <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a>. Set in the modern-day <a href="Shibuya%2C%20Tokyo">Shibuya</a> shopping district of Tokyo, "The World Ends with You" features a distinctive art style inspired by Shibuya and its youth culture. Development was inspired by elements of Jupiter's previous game, "". It was released in Japan in July 2007, and in <a href="PAL%20region">PAL region</a>s and North America in April 2008. Later, an enhanced port to accommodate the game for mobile devices ported by <a href="h.a.n.d.">h.a.n.d.</a> was released in 2012, while an enhanced port for the <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> was released worldwide in 2018 under the title The World Ends with You: Final Remix.

In the game, Neku Sakuraba and his allies are forced to participate in a game that will determine their fate. The battle system uses many of the unique features of the Nintendo DS, including combat that takes place on both screens, and attacks performed by certain motions on the <a href="touchscreen">touchscreen</a> or by shouting into the microphone. Elements of Japanese youth culture, such as fashion, food, and cell phones, are key aspects of the missions.

"The World Ends with You" received positive reviews, praising the graphics, soundtrack, and integration of gameplay into the Shibuya setting. The few common complaints were related to the steep learning curve of the battle system as well as the imprecise touch-screen controls. In the week of its release, the game was the second best-selling DS title in Japan, and the top selling DS title in North America. <a href="Shiro%20Amano">Shiro Amano</a>, writer and artist of the "Kingdom Hearts" <a href="manga">manga</a>, later created a manga based on the video game.

The game takes place in a fictional version of the <a href="Shibuya%2C%20Tokyo">Shibuya</a> shopping district in Tokyo, Japan. While everyday life goes on in the Realground (RG), the chosen dead are brought to an <a href="Plane%20%28metaphysics%29">alternate plane of existence</a> called the Underground (UG). The UG is also the venue for the Reapers' Game. By offering their most treasured possession to enter the Game, the dead gain the chance to contest for the prize: to be brought back to life or to transcend to a higher form of spiritual existence. Most of those who choose to transcend become Reapers, the opponents of players in future Games. Lasting a week, each Game is a contest to judge the worth of humanity. Players set out to accomplish objectives under the rules created by the Composer, who is a god-like entity who maintains Shibuya. Another Reaper, the Conductor, tasks other Reapers to obstruct the players' efforts. Failure to complete a mission will disperse the mind and spirit of the player or Reaper, thus erasing his or her existence.

A player in the UG is invisible to the living in the RG, though one can sometimes read and influence their thoughts. The UG is frequented by creatures called "Noise", which are attracted by the negative feelings of the living. To progress in the Reapers' Game, players are often required to defeat Noise by killing or "erasing" them. However, each Noise exists in two parallel universes (or "zones") simultaneously, and can only be defeated by two players simultaneously fighting and defeating the Noise from these separate zones. In order to do this, Players are required to form a pact with another Player to survive the Noise. Players receive assignments via text messages sent to their <a href="mobile%20phone">cell phones</a>, and their right hands are imprinted with a countdown indicating the time left in the mission. After a day's mission is complete, the remaining players find themselves at the start of the next day's mission, having no sense of the time that has passed in between.

The player assumes the role of , an asocial teenage boy who claims he does not "get" people, and rarely interacts with others. Computer-controlled characters make up the rest of the cast, which includes Players who are paired with Neku. In the first Game, Neku is paired with , a teenage girl who takes on the form of her best friend, as her physical appearance was her price of entry for the Game. In the second Game, Neku's partner is an intelligent and sly teenage boy, , who prefers to be called . Neku's final partner is , an ex-Reaper who calls himself . Beat became a Reaper to find a way to bring his younger sister, (nicknamed ), back to life. Rhyme had sacrificed herself to save her brother from a Noise attack. , the Producer, bound her soul to a pin from which her Noise could be summoned, and gave it to Beat. The final Game Master, , crushes her Noise form and transformed it back into a pin.

Besides the Composer and the Conductor, there are other high-ranking Reapers. For each week of the Game, Game Masters are assigned by the Conductor to lead the opposition to the Players. Of the Game Masters opposing Neku, is the most dangerous. He willingly circumvents the rules in an attempt to supplant the Composer. Participating in the Games with the aim of earning promotions for their performance, the Reapers' goal is to ascend to the highest form of spiritual existence, the Angels. Angels supervise the Games and if the stakes of a Game are particularly high, they send down one of their own to serve as the Producer. For the three weeks of the game's story, Sanae Hanekoma is the Producer. Disguised as a Shibuya cafe owner, he guides new players and narrates the "Secret Reports" that are obtained by completing additional missions after completing the game.

The game's story follows Neku over the course of the three weeks that he plays the Game, paired with partners Shiki, Joshua, and Beat for each week, respectively. Neku is confused at first, lacking knowledge of how he died or how he arrived at the UG. As he develops friendships with his partners, he starts to understand the rules of the Game. After the first week, only Shiki is allowed to return to the living, and she promises to meet Neku at the statue of <a href="Hachiko">Hachiko</a>. He also recovers his entry fee, which was his memories, except for the events leading up to his death. However, Shiki has become what Neku values most, and she is used as his new entry fee for the second week; in addition, Beat defects to the Reapers hoping to find a way to revive Rhyme after she sacrifices herself to save him. During the second week Neku recalls small details of his death; eventually, he recognizes that he was shot at by Sho Minamimoto, one of the Reapers he faced during the Game. At the end of the second week, Joshua seemingly sacrifices himself to save Neku from an explosion created by Minamimoto.

However, because Joshua was never actually dead, the Game is nullified and Neku is forced to play the game a third time. His entry fee this time is all of the other players, meaning Neku cannot form any pacts and stands no chance against the Noise. However, Beat immediately defects from the Reapers and rejoins Neku. Neku and Beat find that the Reapers and the entire population of Shibuya are wearing special red pins that brainwash them into thinking the same harmonious thoughts. Without any missions to complete, the two venture to the fabled "Shibuya River", which Joshua was looking for during the second week. At the river, they find , the Game's Conductor. Kitaniji explains that he created the red pins in an attempt to remake Shibuya, which the Composer challenged him to do. If he fails, both he (as his price for losing the Game) and Shibuya will be erased.

At that moment, Joshua reappears and reveals himself to be the Composer. Joshua returns the missing part of Neku's memory of death: Joshua himself shot Neku, choosing him to be his <a href="wikt%3Aproxy">proxy</a> in his challenge with Kitaniji. Minamimoto, who had been trying to usurp the position of Composer, was trying to kill Joshua in his weakened state as a human. After Kitanji fails to defeat Neku by using his friends against him, Joshua gives Neku one last challenge: To fire upon Joshua to determine the fate of Shibuya. Neku is too conflicted to make a choice, and is shot down by Joshua. Neku finds himself once again at the <a href="Pedestrian%20scramble">scramble crossing</a>, confused by events, but alive this time.

The game's credits show scenes seven days later in the RG. As Neku walks from Udagawa to Hachiko to meet Beat, Rhyme, and Shiki, he discusses how the past three weeks have changed him for the better. In a statement directed at an absent Joshua, Neku says that although he will not forgive him for what he has done, he trusts him. Neku then asks if Joshua will be present at Hachiko as well. Secret reports that can be obtained by completing additional missions after beating the game reveal that Joshua, after seeing the change in personality of Neku over the weeks of playing the game, decides to spare Shibuya, now believing the city to be ideal. The game ends with Neku abandoning his headphones, before a title card appears entitled ""The World Begins with You"".

The "Final Remix" version of the game adds new storyline content taking place after the main game. Neku and Beat awaken in a geographically distorted alternate version of Shibuya, and are assigned a mission to escape Shibuya within 24 hours. Accompanied by a Reaper named Coco Atarashi, the two begin to make their way through the alternate Shibuya while encountering Shiki and Rhyme along the way. As they progress, Neku has visions of a city being destroyed and a strange girl with Shiki's stuffed animal, as well as what seem to be distorted flashbacks of his own death and Rhyme's sacrifice. When Rhyme sacrifices herself to save Beat in a manner identical to Neku's vision, Neku realizes that he is having visions of the future. Neku and Beat arrive at Mr. Hanekoma's cafe, and he reveals that the Shibuya they have been traversing is one giant Noise created by Coco. Neku and Beat defeat the Noise and return to reality. An enraged Coco shoots Neku dead, but is driven off by Joshua. Joshua meets with Mr. Hanekoma to discuss recent events; they reveal that Shinjuku has been erased and Noise are starting to appear in the RG, and that the strange girl from Neku's visions was a survivor of the incident who they theorize caused Neku's visions and was helping him along. Elsewhere, Coco plots to continue using Neku for her plans and resurrects Minamimoto to serve as his partner.

"The World Ends with You" is an <a href="action%20role-playing%20game">action role-playing game</a>, arranged into three chapters based on the three weeks that Neku is involved in the Reaper's Game, with each chapter further divided by each day of the week. The player controls Neku and his partner as they explore Shibuya to complete each day's mission. Although most missions require completion within a certain time for Neku and his partner, this timer is not correlated to the passage of time for the player.

Shibuya is divided into several districts, some of which may be inaccessible on certain days or blocked by a wall that can only be removed by satisfying the request of a nearby Reaper, such as erasing Noise symbols, putting on a certain brand of clothing, or bringing an item. Neku can scan the area by activating a special pin. This scan reveals the thoughts of the <a href="non-player%20character">non-player character</a>s in the Realground and <a href="meme">meme</a>s, which may help to progress the plot. The scan also reveals random Noise symbols that drift about the area, or in some cases, float around a specific character. The player initiates a battle by touching Noise symbols; each symbol constitutes one round of battle. Selecting more than one Noise symbol at a time results in a multi-round battle (referred to in-game as multiple noise "reductions") that gradually increases in difficulty with each round, but conversely leads to greater rewards upon success. Altering the difficulty of the Noise and the amount of health for Neku and his partner also alter the benefits conferred.

Each district has fashion trends that affect gameplay. By wearing pins or clothing from the more popular brands in that district, items' effects will be improved; wearing the least fashionable items will do the opposite, and items from brands in between are not affected. However, the player can increase a brand's popularity in one district by repeatedly fighting battles in that district while wearing items of that brand. The player can enter shops to buy new pins, clothes, and food items that are gradually consumed during battles to improve the characters' basic attributes.

After completing the game, the player can return to any day in the story and play those events again, keeping the characters' current statistics and inventory. "Secret Reports", written segments that reveal background elements of the story, can be unlocked through this mode by completing specific missions during each day. Completing the game allows the player to access "Another Day" from the game's menus, an additional day of missions that explains certain events related to the main storyline. "The World Ends with You" has one <a href="minigame">minigame</a> called "Tin Pin Slammer" (or "Marble Slash") that can be played against computer opponents or with up to 3 others via a wireless connection. "Tin Pin Slammer" is similar to the marble game <a href="marble%20%28toy%29%23Gameplay">ringer</a> in that each player attempts to use their pins one at a time to knock the other players' pins off the gameboard.

"The World Ends with You" features "psych pins", decorative <a href="award%20pin">pins</a> which possess powers that only Neku can activate while wearing them. Psych pins are used for combat, for "Tin Pin Slammer/Marble Slash", or as trade value for money or equipment. Most pins, particularly those used in combat, can become more powerful as the player accumulates "Pin Points" (PP) which can also lead to evolution of the pins into more potent versions. Pin Points are commonly earned through battle, but can also be earned through a period of inactivity with the game, or by interacting with other DS players or randomly if none are found. Each of these methods influences the growth of pins within the game.

The game's combat system is called the "Stride Cross Battle System". The combat takes place across both screens on the DS, with Neku on the touchscreen and his partner on the top screen, representing the different "zones" of the same local area; the two characters battle the same enemies that exist in both "zones" simultaneously. Neku and his partner are synchronized during battle; they share the same health bar so that even if one character does not take any damage, the pair can fail in battle if the other takes too much. A green "light puck" will pass between the characters during battle; by alternating battle between the character who possesses the puck, damage is increased. The movement of the light puck is determined by the "sync ratio" between Neku and his partner; the puck stays longer with the character with higher ratios. The player can equip Neku and his partner with clothing that can alter the light puck's speed. The light puck also has the ability to magnify Neku and his partner's attacks as long as when they hold the puck, they are not attacked by an enemy and can continue this in a volley.

The player controls Neku by performing touchscreen actions based on the currently equipped pins. These actions may include slashing across an enemy, tapping the screen rapidly to fire bullets, holding down on an enemy to inflict damage or shouting into the microphone to cause a full screen attack. Other pins need to be touched to activate them, such as for health restoration. Each pin has a limited number of uses before it must recharge for a certain time. Other pins may only be used a fixed number of times during a series of battles, and do not recharge until the battle sequence is over. Neku can only be equipped with a maximum of two pins at the game's start; this can eventually be upgraded to a maximum of six.

Neku's partner on the top screen can be controlled by the player using the face buttons, although players can use options to have the computer assist them. Each of Neku's partners has a card game-based mechanic; for example, Shiki's card game requires the player to match face-down <a href="Zener%20cards">Zener cards</a>. The partner can make a basic attack after the player navigates through a pathway of arrows to select one of several shown cards using the directional pad or face buttons. By navigating to a card that fits within the card game rules, the player earns a star. Once enough stars are collected, the player can launch a powerful "Fusion" attack using both Neku and his partner through the "Harmonizer Pin" that appears on the upper right of the touchscreen (assuming that the player has not rearranged where it's displayed). The player can also help the partner character dodge attacks.

In the game's releases on single screen systems (mobile and Switch), the Battle System has been modified to reflect the lack of a second screen. The current partner instead acts as a separate pin among Neku's other pins, which the player can call in to perform attacks by similar touchscreen actions like tapping on an enemy or slashing down on one. The player must balance the use of the partner pin with Neku's own attacks, going to their partner repeatedly to build up towards the Fusion attack. The Fusion attack is launched by tapping the partner pin on screen; the player then has a limited period to complete card-based minigames to build up a damage multiplier. For example with Shiki as their partner, the player is shown one Zener card, along with a number of other Zener cards that are shown face-up for a moment before being turned over. The player must select those face-down cards that were matches for the shown Zener card. The Switch version further offers a co-operative mode, where a second player, using a Joy-Con, has control over the partner character and a limited set of pin attacks during battle.

"The World Ends with You" was developed by the same team that created the "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20%28series%29">Kingdom Hearts</a>" series, with input from <a href="Jupiter%20%28company%29">Jupiter</a>, the company that developed "". The development of the game started two and a half years before its Japanese release, during the development of "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20II">Kingdom Hearts II</a>" and the end of development of "Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories". At that time, Nintendo had announced the DS, but it was not yet on the market; <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a> asked the team to make a game specifically for the handheld system. The creative team—consisting of Tatsuya Kando (director), Tomohiro Hasegawa (co-director), Takeshi Arakawa (planning director), and <a href="Tetsuya%20Nomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a> (character design)—were able to experience the DS during the "Touch DS" event in November 2004. From this demonstration, they had envisioned a version of "Chain of Memories" in which the card game aspects would be present on the bottom screen and an action role-playing game on the top. As they continued to work on the game, the developers realized that they wanted to use the touchscreen more, to make "a game that can only be played on the DS". However, they also encountered the problem that by focusing heavily on the touchscreen, the top screen would be ignored. From this, the idea of the dual screen battle system arose. Several other options were explored for the top-screen game, including command-based battles or a music game, but once they reviewed the game from the eyes of the player, they ultimately settled on the card-game approach with the player having the option to control the game if they wanted to. Even with the completion of the Japanese version of the game, the team felt the dual screen system was too much for overseas audiences, and attempted to change the card-game mechanic into a special meter that would fill up with normal attacks from Neku, but this was not completed in time for release. However, the team was able to alter the "information overload" of the numerous tutorials at the start of the game in the North American release, reducing the amount of text presented as well as allowing the tutorials to be skipped. The "Active Encounter" system, the ability for the player to select when and how to go into battle, was developed specifically to avoid the issues of "<a href="Grind%20%28gaming%29">grinding</a>" that are common with most standard RPG systems. While they included the mechanics of being able to scan non-playable characters to see their thoughts, the team was not able to integrate this mechanic more into the game.

In addition to creating unique gameplay, the designers wanted to build the game around a real location. Initially, they had planned to use a large number of locations across the entire world as the setting. They narrowed down the settings to specific cities due to practicality issues. Ultimately, Kando selected Shibuya as the main setting within the first year of development, despite concerns that overseas players would find the setting unfamiliar. The team wanted to make sure the city was represented accurately within the game, and went on "location hunts" onto building rooftops without permission to get photographs. The layout of Shibuya was duplicated for the game, retaining the real-world landmarks while rebranding the names of stores and buildings for copyright reasons; for example, the <a href="109%20%28department%20store%29">109 Building</a> was renamed to be the "104 Building", while one of the busiest <a href="Starbucks">Starbucks</a>, adjacent to the <a href="scramble%20crossing">scramble crossing</a>, was renamed "Outback Cafe". The success of the game has led to fans going on tours of the district to match physical locations in Shibuya with those in the game. The selection of Shibuya led to the incorporation of much of the game's other features, including food, clothing, and cell phone usage. The team initially thought of the idea of using <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a> around Shibuya as the source of the player's power in the game but had difficulty representing it; this led to the creation of the psych pins used in the game.

The team decided to stay with two-dimensional graphics instead of three-dimensional graphics, believing it would help differentiate themselves from other Square Enix titles as well as better represent their vision for the game. When first approached with the task of creating the art for the game, background art director Takayuki Ohdachi thought the modern-day setting would be too boring, and opted to use highly skewed and angular images of Shibuya to avoid this; the rest of the creative team found this approach to fit the game quite well. For combat, the background of the top screen was selected for visual interest, while the bottom touchscreen background was designed to emphasize the gameplay. Ohdachi was also responsible for the artwork for the psych pins, and used a mix of <a href="pop%20art">pop art</a> and tribal designs for the various graphics. Character designs were handled by Tetsuya Nomura and Gen Kobayashi. Character designs were made to match with the real-world Tokyo setting, after which their outfits were designed based on the character's personality. Kobayashi was also in charge of designing the game's non-player characters and noted how most designs made it to the final product. Hasegawa was responsible for creating the designs for the Noise creatures, and wanted to have them recognizable as creatures before they decay into skeletons. In keeping with the theme of human emotion in the game, Hasegawa selected creatures that conveyed such feelings, such as wolves and crows. Representation of the Noise in the game required drawing the 2D sprites from several angles to match the action on screen as well as using <a href="rotoscoping">rotoscoping</a> on pre-rendered sprites, and took several iterations between Square Enix and Jupiter to make sure that the sprites' art matched the style of game, with Kando making the two-hour trip between Tokyo and Kyoto weekly to check on the progress.

The developers knew that for the story they wanted to "throw the player right in the action, with things he had to do without explanation" in addition to creating a sense of urgency and mystery for the player. They developed an initial draft of the game's plot and gave it to script writer Sachie Hirano and scenario event planner Yukari Ishida to expand on. The returned version was very close to the initial vision for the game's story. However, there were still difficulties in filling out the story, only achieving some smooth development about halfway through the process, and even then, there were still changes made just prior to creating the master image for the game. Several inconsistencies with the game's story were found in the final quality checks that had to be resolved. The Square Enix localization team, while translating most of the dialog and interface items into English and other European languages, preserved many Japanese elements to avoid losing the culture of the game. The team was also limited by the size of the dialog balloons used within game, and took several steps to avoid losing the meaning of the story within the game.

As "The World Ends with You" focuses on the character of Neku Sakuraba, in order to create a believable story the developers put a lot of focus on his development, such as how he would feel, what thoughts lie behind his actions, how he interacted with other characters, and how the people around him feel about him. The developers included aspects and daily concerns, hoping that they could be things that players would have to deal with their personal lives and therefore would let them relate with Neku.

The Japanese title, translated as "It's a Wonderful World", was not used internationally due to copyright issues. Instead, the game was released in North America and Europe under the name "The World Ends with You". The game was officially announced on September 13, 2006 by Square Enix, and premiered at the 2006 <a href="Tokyo%20Game%20Show">Tokyo Game Show</a> two weeks later. On December 5, 2007, Square Enix announced that the game would be released for Europe and Australia in April 2008, while a similar announcement was made for a North American release on December 17, 2007.

A special "Wonderful World" edition of the "Gloss Silver" <a href="Nintendo%20DS%20Lite">Nintendo DS Lite</a> was created and sold as a bundle with the game as part of its Japanese release. The game's early plot was adapted into a two-chapter one-shot manga by <a href="Shiro%20Amano">Shiro Amano</a>, published over two issues of "<a href="Monthly%20Sh%C5%8Dnen%20Gangan">Monthly Shōnen Gangan</a>". In North America, the manga has been released online via the Square Enix Members website, along with mobile phone ring tones. Both Nomura and Tatsuya Kando stated that they hoped they would be given the opportunity to create a sequel to the game. Neku, Shiki, Joshua, Beat, and Rhyme appear in the video game "" as non-playable characters who are challenged to a task similar to the Reapers' Game. The cameos are the first non-Disney and non-"Final Fantasy" characters to appear in the "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>" franchise.

The soundtrack to "The World Ends with You" was composed and produced by <a href="Takeharu%20Ishimoto">Takeharu Ishimoto</a>. The game's music encompasses many genres, combining <a href="rock%20music">rock</a>, <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a>, and <a href="electronica">electronica</a> and was designed to fit the various moods of Shibuya. The song appearing during the credits of the game is "<a href="Lullaby%20for%20You">Lullaby for You</a>" by <a href="J-pop">Japanese pop</a> artist, <a href="Jyongri">Jyongri</a>. Vocal artists featured in the game include Sawa Kato, Makiko Noda, Leah, Ayuko Tanaka, Mai Matsuda, Wakako, Hanaeryca, Cameron Strother, Andy Kinlay, Nulie Nurly, and Londell "Taz" Hicks. The developers used <a href="CRI%20Middleware">CRI Middleware</a>'s Kyuseishu Sound Streamer, a compression algorithm normally used for voice-overs, to compress the soundtrack and fit more songs on the game media, while replacing full motion video cutscenes with <a href="Adobe%20Flash">Flash</a>-style animations to save more space. The <a href="ADX%20%28file%20format%29">ADX</a>-compressed soundtrack and cutscene audio on the final version of the game take up approximately one-fourth (42 of 128 total <a href="Megabytes">MB</a>) of the game media.

The official soundtrack of the game, was released in Japan on August 22, 2007 and is on sale in most English-language <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a>s. This release, however, does not include the four tracks unique to localizations outside Japan and is simply a digital version of the Japanese soundtrack. Three of the tracks, "Someday", "Calling" and "Twister", were later remixed for the 2012 <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> title, "". "Calling" and "Twister" were also remixed for downloadable tracks for "".

A revised soundtrack, "The World Ends With You - Crossover", was released on September 20, 2012. It includes the original tracks from the DS game, remixes of "Calling", "Someday" and "Twister" from "Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance", and the remixes from the iOS version.

Square Enix, however, released the digital 6-track <a href="extended%20play">EP</a> on June 25, 2008 through the Japanese iTunes Store. This release contains the four songs unique to the international version of the game, along with the English version of "Owari-Hajimari" and a remix of "Twister". A 19-track version of the album was given a physical CD and iTunes release on July 30, 2008.

A port for mobile devices, entitled "The World Ends with You: Solo Remix", was released on iOS on August 27, 2012, and on Android on June 26, 2014. This version of the game was developed by Square Enix's mobile development team and <a href="h.a.n.d.">h.a.n.d.</a> within the course of the year. The game's combat system was reworked to accommodate the lack of a second screen, as described in the above Gameplay section.

In addition to combat changes, the "Solo Remix" includes redrawn high-definition sprites and is optimized for the Retina display of iOS devices. The original soundtrack and additional remixes of these songs are included. Wireless and social media features are also included: the Tin Pin Slammer can be played with other players via wireless connections, and the game can connect with the player's social media applications to display these as scanned thoughts from non-player characters within the game. The "Solo Remix" version features a remixed soundtrack from the original DS release. New assets at the conclusion of the iOS game hint at a possible sequel, but no confirmation has been made by Square Enix. The iOS version of the game was pulled from the iOS App Store in February 2015 due to an issue that prevented the game from working with the iOS 8 operating system launched in September 2014, though the Android version remained available. It returned to the App Store in June 2015.

A port for the <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a>, entitled "The World Ends with You: Final Remix", was announced in January 2018 and released on October 12, 2018. The port, based on the mobile "Solo Remix" version and with additional development from Square Enix and h.a.n.d., includes a new control system adapted for the Switch, specifically allowing for the use of the <a href="Joy-Con">Joy-Con</a> in addition to the touch-screen and optional co-op support for Neku's partner. An additional new scenario was added to this version.

"The World Ends with You" received positive reviews and has been commercially successful. "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" named the game its Handheld Game of the Month award for May 2008. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> gave "The World Ends with You" its Editors' Choice Award, and named it the DS Game of the Month for April. In Japan, the game premiered as the second-best selling DS title during the week of July 27, 2007. Nearly 193,000 units were sold in Japan by the end of 2007. "The World Ends with You" sold 43,000 copies during April 2008 in North America. The first shipment of the game sold out mid-May and a second shipment was made in mid-June 2008. The game was the top-selling DS title the week of its release and again two weeks later. As of September 30, 2008, "The World Ends With You" has sold approximately 140,000 copies in North America and 20,000 copies in Europe.

Critics praised the departure from other popular titles such as Square Enix's "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>" and "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>" series. Both the graphical presentation and the soundtrack were very well received. Reviews also commented that, initially, the character designs were too similar to previous Square Enix titles and may be off-putting to some though in the Shibuya setting they were "absolutely in their element." Some reviewers also complained that the Stride Cross Battle System was too complex for new players; <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>'s review felt the "sink or swim" reliance on learning the complex battle system was a significant stumbling block for the game. "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" noted that the <a href="Stylus%20%28computing%29">stylus</a> input was imprecise, often mistaking movement and attack actions. On the other hand, the system was praised for its approach, and for the ability to alter the difficulty of the system within the game. Neku Sakuraba's character arc was praised by several reviewers, such as <a href="G4%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">G4TV</a> editor Jonathan Hunt, who praised his growth from a "mute teenager" to a "civil human". <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>'s review summarized that the game is much more than the sum of its parts: "By all rights, "The World Ends With You" should be an annoying disaster, a bundle of tired gimmicks and trite clichés. Yet somehow all the things that should be unbearable fall into place and create a game that's far more unique, interesting, and addictive than it has any right to be."

"The World Ends with You" won several awards from <a href="IGN">IGN</a>.com, including best <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> role-playing game, best story for a Nintendo DS game, best new <a href="intellectual%20property">IP</a> for the DS, and the best Nintendo DS game of the year. It was also nominated for other awards, including best original score for a Nintendo DS game and best artistic design for a Nintendo DS game. It was ranked as the tenth best game of the 2000s released on a <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> system by <a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>.

"The World Ends with You: Solo Remix" received a score of 9.5 and an Editor's Choice from IGN, who praised the port and its additions, although criticized its price point and lack of universal compatibility (the iPhone/iPod Touch and iPad versions of the game must be purchased separately.) <a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a> also criticized the high price and lack of universal compatibility as 'indefensible', though it praised the port for its controls, saying "in many ways, it feels more suited to (the iPad) than it ever did on the DS."

Pierre Rossier

Pierre Joseph Rossier (16 July 1829 – 22 october 1886) was a pioneering Swiss photographer whose <a href="Albumen%20print">albumen</a> photographs, which include <a href="Stereoscope">stereographs</a> and <a href="Carte%20de%20visite">cartes-de-visite</a>, comprise portraits, cityscapes, and landscapes. He was commissioned by the London firm of "<a href="Negretti%20and%20Zambra">Negretti and Zambra</a>" to travel to Asia and document the progress of the Anglo-French troops in the <a href="Second%20Opium%20War">Second Opium War</a> and, although he failed to join that military expedition, he remained in Asia for several years, producing the first <a href="Photography%20in%20China">commercial photographs</a> of China, the Philippines, Japan and Siam (now Thailand). He was the first professional photographer in Japan, where he trained <a href="Ueno%20Hikoma">Ueno Hikoma</a>, <a href="Maeda%20Genz%C5%8D">Maeda Genzō</a>, <a href="Horie%20Kuwajir%C5%8D">Horie Kuwajirō</a>, as well as lesser known members of the first generation of Japanese photographers. In Switzerland he established <a href="photographic%20studio">photographic studio</a>s in <a href="Fribourg">Fribourg</a> and <a href="Einsiedeln%2C%20Switzerland">Einsiedeln</a>, and he also produced images elsewhere in the country. Rossier is an important figure in the early history of photography not only because of his own images, but also because of the critical impact of his teaching in the early days of Japanese photography.

Until very recently, little was known about Rossier; even his given name was a mystery. In his own time he was sometimes referred to as "P. Rossier" and at other times as "M. Rossier". Documents discovered in the <a href="Fribourg">Fribourg</a> town archives finally proved that his given name was Pierre, and it can be assumed that the "M" in "M. Rossier" stood for "". He was long thought to be from France and while he was in Japan he was even referred to as an "Englishman"; however, recent research has revealed that Rossier was Swiss, born on 16 July 1829 in Grandsivaz, a small village in the <a href="Canton%20of%20Fribourg">Canton of Fribourg</a>. He was the fourth of ten children of a farming family of modest means. At the age of sixteen he became a teacher at a school in a neighbouring village, but by 1855 he was issued a passport to visit France and England to work as a photographer.

At some point after leaving Switzerland and arriving in England, Rossier was commissioned by the firm of "<a href="Negretti%20and%20Zambra">Negretti and Zambra</a>" to travel to China to photograph the Second Opium War (1858–1860). It may be that the firm considered Rossier's Swiss citizenship an asset for such a voyage, that his country's neutrality might help him find passage aboard either British or French ships. Taking into account the high costs and uncertainty incurred by the firm and the potential hazards for Rossier himself, this was an important commission.

Rossier was in Hong Kong in 1858, and he soon began taking photographs, mostly in and around Canton (now <a href="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>). In November 1859 "Negretti and Zambra" published a set of fifty of Rossier's views, including <a href="Stereoscope">stereographs</a>. These received favourable reviews in photographic periodicals of the day. In 1858 or 1859 Rossier travelled to the Philippines where he visited and photographed the <a href="Taal%20Volcano">Taal Volcano</a>. Rossier was in Japan by 1859, producing photographs first in <a href="Nagasaki%2C%20Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>, then in <a href="Kanagawa%20Prefecture">Kanagawa</a>, <a href="Yokohama">Yokohama</a> and <a href="Edo">Edo</a> (now Tokyo); he was the first professional photographer to arrive in Japan. One of the photographs Rossier took during the summer of 1859, while in Nagasaki, was a portrait of <a href="Philipp%20Franz%20von%20Siebold">Philipp Franz von Siebold</a>'s son <a href="Alexander%20von%20Siebold">Alexander</a> and a group of <a href="samurai">samurai</a> from the <a href="Nabeshima%20clan">Nabeshima clan</a>.

At the end of June 1860, Rossier was in Shanghai, and it is likely that he visited the city in an attempt to gain permission to accompany the Anglo-French military expedition that had already arrived in northern China and thereby fulfill his commission to document the Second Opium War. If so, he was unsuccessful; both forces had already hired photographers to document the mission. The British forces were accompanied by the photographers <a href="Felice%20Beato">Felice Beato</a> and <a href="John%20Papillon">John Papillon</a>, and the French by <a href="Antoine%20Fauchery">Antoine Fauchery</a>, Lieutenant-Colonel Du Pin, and possibly also by <a href="Louis%20Legrand%20%28photographer%29">Louis Legrand</a>. Although Rossier failed even to embark on the mission he had been hired to document, he remained in East Asia for some time longer.

By October 1860, Rossier had returned to Nagasaki, where he took photographs of the harbour on behalf of the British Consul, <a href="George%20S.%20Morrison%20%28diplomat%29">George S. Morrison</a>, for which Rossier was paid $70. Although Rossier's photographs of Japan were advertised by "Negretti and Zambra" on at least two occasions in 1860, the firm did not publish them until October or November 1861. Five of Rossier's views of Japan appeared earlier, in <a href="George%20Smith%20%28bishop%29">George Smith</a>'s book, "Ten Weeks in Japan", in April 1861, and that July, eight of Rossier's Japan photographs appeared in the form of <a href="lithography">lithograph</a>s in Henry Arthur Tilley's book, "Japan, the Amoor, and the Pacific". An 1861 edition of the <a href="Illustrated%20London%20News">Illustrated London News</a> included several engravings under the collective title "Domestic Life in China", the images having been taken from Rossier's stereographs. One of the photographs "Negretti and Zambra" had advertised in 1860 became the first commercial photograph taken in Japan to be published, and is the earliest known <a href="hand-colouring">hand-coloured</a> Japanese photograph.

Thanks to a number of documents of the time, it is now certain that "Negretti and Zambra"'s photographs of China and Japan were taken by Rossier, but for many years it was thought that they might have been taken by either <a href="Walter%20B.%20Woodbury">Walter B. Woodbury</a>, who also had dealings with "Negretti and Zambra" but was based in Batavia (now <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>), or <a href="Abel%20Gower">Abel Gower</a>, who was an amateur photographer in Japan. The <a href="Leiden%20University">Leiden University</a> photograph collection includes a portrait, allegedly of Gower, signed "P. Rossier", and in 1859 Rossier and Gower shared passage aboard "HMS Sampson" from Nagasaki to Edo.

Rossier first arrived in Japan in 1859, at a time when early experiments in photography were being conducted in <a href="Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB">Kyūshū</a>, particularly in Nagasaki. The city was the centre of "<a href="rangaku">rangaku</a>", the study of Western science, and it was here that physicians <a href="Jan%20Karel%20van%20den%20Broek">Jan Karel van den Broek</a> and <a href="J.%20L.%20C.%20Pompe%20van%20Meerdervoort">J. L. C. Pompe van Meerdervoort</a> were instrumental in teaching their Japanese students not only medicine but also <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a> and photography. Neither Van den Broek nor Pompe van Meerdervoort was an experienced photographer, and their attempts to produce photographs were largely failures. Nevertheless, in turn they taught <a href="collodion%20process">wet-collodion process</a> photography to Keisai Yoshio, Furukawa Shumpei, Kawano Teizō, <a href="Maeda%20Genz%C5%8D">Maeda Genzō</a>, <a href="Ueno%20Hikoma">Ueno Hikoma</a>, and <a href="Horie%20Kuwajir%C5%8D">Horie Kuwajirō</a>, among others.

On his arrival in Japan, Rossier presumably introduced himself as a photographer despatched to Japan by "Negretti and Zambra", perhaps thereby inspiring a misconception, for while he remained in the country he was often referred to as an "English" photographer. In Nagasaki, Rossier was assisted in his work by Maeda Genzō, who had been instructed to accompany the "Englishman" and to further learn photography. With Maeda and other students escorting him around the city, Rossier took photographs of priests, beggars, the audience of a <a href="sumo">sumo</a> match, the foreign settlement, and the group portrait of Alexander von Siebold and <a href="samurai">samurai</a>. Rossier believed that Pompe van Meerdervoort's failures in photography were due to a lack of the necessary chemicals and so he provided Maeda with a letter of recommendation to procure photographic apparatus and chemicals from a source in Shanghai. Both Maeda and Furukawa bought lenses, chemicals and albumen paper through Rossier.

At this time, Ueno Hikoma and Horie Kuwajirō also received photographic instruction from Rossier. Apparently Ueno had originally intended to learn not only the practice of photography but also the manufacture of cameras. The encounter with Rossier seems to have convinced Ueno to pursue photography as a career, but he was so overwhelmed by the technology of the camera that he quickly dropped the notion of making one himself. Within a few months, he and Horie had purchased a French camera and chemicals, thereafter launching their independent photographic careers.

Although Rossier's time in Japan was brief and the surviving photographic legacy of his sojourn is scant, he nevertheless had a lasting impact on photography in the country.

In 1861, Rossier was in Siam, where he assisted the French <a href="zoology">zoologist</a> <a href="Marie%20Firmin%20Bocourt">Firmin Bocourt</a> by taking <a href="ethnography">ethnographic</a> portraits for the latter's scientific expedition of 1861–1862, and in 1863, "Negretti and Zambra" issued a series of 30 stereographic portraits and landscapes taken in Siam that are almost certainly the work of Rossier. In February 1862, Rossier was again in Shanghai, where he sold his cameras and other photographic equipment before embarking for Europe. During his time in Asia it is possible that Rossier photographed in India; "Negretti and Zambra" issued a series of views of India at about the same time as Rossier's China views.

Rossier returned to Switzerland in early 1862 and, in October 1865, married Catharine Barbe Kaelin (1843–1867). The couple had a son, Christophe Marie Pierre Joseph, who was born on 30 July 1866. Catharine died on 4 April 1867.

Rossier maintained a <a href="photographic%20studio">photographic studio</a> in Fribourg until at least 1876 and he also had a studio in <a href="Einsiedeln%2C%20Switzerland">Einsiedeln</a>. During the 1860s and 1870s, he produced a number of stereographs and <a href="Carte%20de%20visite">cartes-de-visite</a> comprising portraits and views of Fribourg, Einsiedeln and other places in Switzerland. An 1871 advertisement in the French-language Fribourg newspaper offered photographs by Rossier of religious paintings by the artist Melchior Paul von Deschwanden. In 1872, Rossier applied for a passport to travel to France where he may have produced photographs. At some point between 1871 and 1884, he married again. His second wife, Marie Virginie Overney, was employed as a household servant by the landlords of his studio. They had a son, Joseph Louis, who was born in Paris on 16 March 1884, and who went on to own a café in <a href="Vevey">Vevey</a>, Switzerland. He died in 1927.

Pierre Rossier died in Paris some time between 1883 and 1898.

Examples of Rossier's views of Switzerland are held in several institutions and private collections in that country. Rossier took the first commercial photographs of China and Japan, and they are now quite rare. He complained at times of the adverse effects of the climate on his photographic chemicals and some of his negatives may have been damaged en route to London from Asia. Though his surviving images are scarce, his importance to the early history of photography in Asia is great. Before his arrival in Japan in 1859, Japanese students of photography had struggled to produce satisfactory images, but Rossier's experience, instruction, and contacts with suppliers of photographic materials were extremely helpful in the development of an autonomous photographic tradition in Japan.

It occurs naturally in <a href="woodland">woodland</a>, open forest and <a href="heath">heath</a>land on <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> soils. An upright shrub, it can reach to 3 m (10 ft) in height, with <a href="terete">terete</a> leaves that are divided and narrow. The yellow flowers appear from September to December and are prominently displayed. They are followed by round grey cones, which give the plant its common name of "drumsticks". The small hairy seeds are found in the old flower parts.

"Isopogon anethifolius" regenerates after <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a> by resprouting from its woody base, known as a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>, as well as from seed. It was <a href="Species%20description">described</a> by <a href="Richard%20Salisbury">Richard Salisbury</a> in 1796, and was first grown in the United Kingdom the same year. One of the easiest members of the genus "<a href="Isopogon">Isopogon</a>" to grow in cultivation, "I. anethifolius" grows readily in the garden if located in a sunny or part-shaded spot with sandy soil and good drainage.

"Isopogon anethifolius" is a <a href="shrub">shrub</a> usually between high with an upright <a href="Habit%20%28biology%29">habit</a> (tall and thin with mostly vertical stems). It generally grows taller in more sheltered areas such as <a href="woodland">woodland</a>s, and shorter in more exposed areas. The stems are reddish in colour, and new growth in winter is tinged with reddish and tan tones. The leaves are <a href="terete">terete</a> (round in cross section) and less than 1 mm ( in) in diameter. They branch once or twice in their length. The globular yellow flowerheads, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, appear at the ends of branches in spring and early summer (September to December), though occasionally at other times of year. These are up to in diameter. The individual flowers arise out of the central woody globe in a spiral pattern, and are around long. They are straight stalkless structures that originate from a scale on the globe, composed of a tubular structure known as the <a href="perianth">perianth</a>, which envelopes the flower's sexual organs. The perianth splits into four segments, revealing a thin delicate style that is tipped with the stigma. At the ends of the four perianth segments are the male <a href="pollen">pollen</a>-bearing structures known as anthers. Arranged in a spiral pattern, the flowers open from the outer/bottom of the flowerhead inwards. The egg-shaped grey cones are revealed as the old flower parts fall away, and are up to 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter. The seed-bearing nuts are small—up to across—and lined with hairs. The seed weighs around .

The terete leaves readily distinguish "Isopogon anethifolius" from other members of the genus, which have flat leaves and are greater than 1 mm ( in) across. On a microscopic level, the supporting <a href="ground%20tissue">ground tissue</a> of "I. anethifolius" differs from some of its genus by its irregular misshapen <a href="sclereids">sclereids</a> (thick-walled cells that make up part of the ground tissue) and contorted cell body.

"Isopogon anethifolius" was among the plants collected by English botanist <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Joseph Banks</a> and Swedish naturalist <a href="Daniel%20Solander">Daniel Solander</a> on 5 May 1770 at <a href="Botany%20Bay">Botany Bay</a> during the <a href="First%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook">first voyage of Captain James Cook</a>. A drawing by Scottish artist <a href="Sydney%20Parkinson">Sydney Parkinson</a> was the source for a subsequent painting by <a href="James%20Britten">James Britten</a>, published in 1905.
English botanist <a href="Richard%20Anthony%20Salisbury">Richard Salisbury</a> described this species in 1796 as "Protea anethifolia", from a specimen collected in <a href="Port%20Jackson">Port Jackson</a> (Sydney). The species name is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> words "anethum" "dill" and "folium" "leaf", from the resemblance of its leaves to those of <a href="Dill">the herb</a>. The common name is variously written as "narrowleaf-", "narrow-leaf-", or "narrow-leafed drumsticks". The common name "drumsticks" is derived from the globular cones of the members of the genus.

In 1799, the Spanish botanist <a href="Antonio%20Jos%C3%A9%20Cavanilles">Antonio José Cavanilles</a> described "Protea acufera", later identified as a <a href="synonyms%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> by Salisbury and Robert Brown. "I. anethifolius" gained its current name in 1809 when it was redescribed as the dill-leaved isopogon ("Isopogon anethifolius") by English plantsman <a href="Joseph%20Knight%20%28horticulturist%29">Joseph Knight</a> in his controversial work "<a href="On%20the%20cultivation%20of%20the%20plants%20belonging%20to%20the%20natural%20order%20of%20Proteeae">On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae</a>". Robert Brown had written of the genus "<a href="Isopogon">Isopogon</a>" but Knight had hurried out his work before Brown's. Brown's description appeared in his paper "<a href="On%20the%20natural%20order%20of%20plants%20called%20Proteaceae">On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae</a>" in the "Transactions of the Linnean Society" in 1810.

French naturalist <a href="Michel%20Gandoger">Michel Gandoger</a> described four <a href="taxon">taxa</a> in 1919 that he regarded as similar to (but distinct from) "I. anethifolius". "I. confertus" was a plant from <a href="Rylstone%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Rylstone</a> on the <a href="Central%20Tablelands">Central Tablelands</a>, which he distinguished by its crowded leaves that were long. "I. eriophorus" was a plant with more scattered leaves that were long. He described "I. globosus" from the Port Jackson district on the basis of round (rather than oval) infructescences (cones), and "I. virgatulus" from <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>. All four were subsequently synonymised with "I. anethifolius". Gandoger described 212 taxa of Australian plants, almost all of which turned out to be species already described.

The 1891 publication "<a href="Revisio%20generum%20plantarum">Revisio generum plantarum</a>" was German botanist <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a>'s response to what he perceived as poor method in existing nomenclatural practice. Because "Isopogon" was based on "<a href="Isopogon%20anemonifolius">Isopogon anemonifolius</a>", and that species had already been placed by Salisbury in the segregate genus "Atylus" in 1807, Kuntze revived the latter genus on the grounds of <a href="Principle%20of%20Priority">priority</a>, and made the <a href="Combinatio%20nova">new combination</a> "Atylus anethifolius". However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus "Isopogon" was <a href="conserved%20name">nomenclaturally conserved</a> over "Atylus" by the <a href="International%20Botanical%20Congress">International Botanical Congress</a> of 1905.

Like all species in the genus "Isopogon", "I. anethifolius" has 13 <a href="haploid">haploid</a> chromosomes.

"Isopogon anethifolius" is found only in New South Wales, where it occurs in the <a href="Sydney%20Basin">Sydney Basin</a> and surrounds, from <a href="Braidwood%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Braidwood</a> northwards to Mount Coricudgy in <a href="Wollemi%20National%20Park">Wollemi National Park</a>. The annual rainfall in these areas ranges from 900 to 1600 mm (35–60 in). The species occurs naturally from sea level to 1200 m (4000 ft) altitude and is found on <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> in <a href="heath">heath</a>land and dry <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> woodland. Typical trees it is associated with include the scribbly gums "<a href="Eucalyptus%20haemastoma">Eucalyptus haemastoma</a>" and "<a href="Eucalyptus%20sclerophylla">E. sclerophylla</a>" and silvertop ash ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20sieberi">E. sieberi</a>"), open forest plants such as soft geebung ("<a href="Persoonia%20mollis">Persoonia mollis</a>"), and heathland plants such as heath banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20ericifolia">Banksia ericifolia</a>"), dwarf she-oak ("<a href="Allocasuarina%20nana">Allocasuarina nana</a>") and Wingello grevillea ("<a href="Grevillea%20molyneuxii">Grevillea molyneuxii</a>").

"Isopogon anethifolius" resprouts from its woody base, known as a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>, after <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a>. It is also <a href="serotiny">serotinous</a>—the seeds are held on the plant as a <a href="canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a>-based <a href="Soil%20seed%20bank">seedbank</a> and are released after fire. These then fall directly to the ground or are blown a short distance by wind. Plants resprouting from the lignotuber can flower in around two and a half years, while seedlings take around three and a half years.

<a href="Leaf%20spot">Leaf spot</a>ting is caused by the fungus "<a href="Vizella">Vizella</a>". Flower buds may be damaged by <a href="weevil">weevil</a>s.

"Isopogon anethifolius" was first cultivated in the United Kingdom in 1796. Along with "<a href="Isopogon%20dawsonii">Isopogon dawsonii</a>", it is the easiest member of the genus to grow. The fine foliage, red stems, bright yellow flowers in spring and distinctive drumsticks afterwards make "I. anethifolius" an appealing garden plant. It has potential as a screening plant (its dense foliage can be used for privacy). It prefers <a href="Soil%20pH">acidic soil</a> with extra water, though it does not tolerate <a href="Waterlogging%20%28agriculture%29">waterlogging</a>. A part-shaded position is the preferred location, though "I. anethifolius" grows readily in full sun. Plants can withstand frosts to . Fertiliser applied in spring assists growth. Young plants can grow long stems that eventually droop, and respond well to <a href="pruning">pruning</a>. The species can be propagated by cuttings or seeds, which <a href="Germination">germinate</a> after 30 to 60 days. Flowering can take several years from seed. Western Australian "Isopogon" species including "<a href="Isopogon%20cuneatus">I. cuneatus</a>" and "<a href="Isopogon%20latifolius">I. latifolius</a>" have been grafted onto rootstocks of this species. The flowers, cones and foliage are used in the <a href="Cut%20flowers">cut-flower</a> industry.

Live and Let Die (novel)

Live and Let Die is the second novel in <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a>'s <a href="James%20Bond%20%28literary%20character%29">James Bond</a> <a href="List%20of%20James%20Bond%20novels%20and%20short%20stories">series of stories</a>, and is set in London, the US and Jamaica. It was first published in the UK by <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a> on 5 April 1954. Fleming wrote the novel at his <a href="Goldeneye%20%28estate%29">Goldeneye estate</a> in Jamaica before his first book, <a href="Casino%20Royale%20%28novel%29">"Casino Royale"</a>, was published; much of the background came from Fleming's travel in the US and knowledge of Jamaica.

The story centres on Bond's pursuit of "Mr Big", a criminal who has links to the American criminal network, the world of <a href="Haitian%20Vodou">voodoo</a> and <a href="SMERSH%20%28James%20Bond%29">SMERSH</a>—an arm of the Russian secret service—all of which are threats to the West. Bond becomes involved in the US through Mr Big's smuggling of 17th-century gold coins from British territories in the Caribbean. The novel deals with the themes of the ongoing East-West struggle of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>—including British and American relations, Britain's position in the world, race relations and the struggle between good and evil.

As with "Casino Royale", "Live and Let Die" was broadly well received by the critics. The initial print run of 7,500 copies quickly sold out and a second print run was ordered within the year. US sales, when the novel was released there a year later, were much slower. Following a <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a> adaptation in 1958–59 by <a href="John%20McLusky">John McLusky</a> in the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>", the novel was adapted in 1973 as the <a href="Live%20and%20Let%20Die%20%28film%29">eighth film</a> in the <a href="Eon%20Productions">Eon Productions</a> Bond series and the first to star <a href="Roger%20Moore">Roger Moore</a> as Bond. Major plot elements from the novel were also incorporated into the Bond films <a href="For%20Your%20Eyes%20Only%20%28film%29">"For Your Eyes Only"</a> in 1981 and "<a href="Licence%20to%20Kill">Licence to Kill</a>" in 1989.

The British <a href="Secret%20Intelligence%20Service">Secret Service</a> agent <a href="James%20Bond%20%28literary%20character%29">James Bond</a> is sent by his superior, <a href="M%20%28James%20Bond%29">M</a>, to New York City to investigate "Mr Big", real name Buonaparte Ignace Gallia. Bond's target is an agent of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> <a href="counterintelligence">counterintelligence</a> organisation <a href="SMERSH%20%28James%20Bond%29">SMERSH</a>, and an underworld <a href="Haitian%20Vodou">voodoo</a> leader who is suspected of selling 17th-century gold coins in order to finance Soviet spy operations in America. These gold coins have been turning up in <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a> and Florida and are suspected of being part of a treasure that was buried in Jamaica by the pirate <a href="Henry%20Morgan">Sir Henry Morgan</a>.

In New York Bond meets up with his counterpart in the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</a>, <a href="Felix%20Leiter">Felix Leiter</a>. The two visit some of Mr Big's nightclubs in Harlem, but are captured. Bond is interrogated by Mr Big, who uses his fortune-telling employee, Solitaire (so named because she excludes men from her life), to determine if Bond is telling the truth. Solitaire lies to Mr Big, supporting Bond's cover story. Mr Big decides to release Bond and Leiter, and has one of Bond's fingers broken. On leaving, Bond kills several of Mr Big's men, while Leiter is released with minimal physical harm by a gang member, sympathetic because of a shared appreciation of jazz.

Solitaire later leaves Mr Big and contacts Bond; the couple travel by train to <a href="St.%20Petersburg%2C%20Florida">St. Petersburg, Florida</a>, where they meet Leiter. While Bond and Leiter are scouting one of Mr Big's warehouses used for storing exotic fish, Solitaire is kidnapped by Mr Big's minions. Leiter later returns to the warehouse by himself, but is either captured and fed to a shark or tricked into standing on a trap door over the shark tank through which he falls; he survives, but loses an arm and a leg. Bond finds him in their safe house with a note pinned to his chest "He disagreed with something that ate him". Bond then investigates the warehouse himself and discovers that Mr Big is smuggling gold coins by hiding them in the bottom of fish tanks holding poisonous tropical fish, which he is bringing into the US. He is attacked in the warehouse by "the Robber", Mr Big's gunman, and in the resultant gunfight Bond outwits the Robber and causes him to fall into the shark tank.

Bond continues his mission in Jamaica, where he meets a local fisherman, Quarrel, and John Strangways, the head of the local MI6 station. Quarrel gives Bond training in <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba diving</a> in the local waters. Bond swims through shark- and barracuda-infested waters to Mr Big's island and manages to plant a <a href="limpet%20mine">limpet mine</a> on the hull of his yacht before being captured once again by Mr Big. Bond is reunited with Solitaire; the following morning Mr Big ties the couple to a line behind his yacht and plans to drag them over the shallow <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a> and into deeper water so that the sharks and barracuda that he attracts in to the area with regular feedings will eat them.

Bond and Solitaire are saved when the limpet mine explodes seconds before they are dragged over the reef: though temporarily stunned by the explosion and injured on the coral, they are protected from the explosion by the reef and Bond watches as Mr Big, who survived the explosion, is killed by the sharks and barracuda. Quarrel then rescues the couple.

Between January and March 1952 the journalist <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a> wrote "<a href="Casino%20Royale%20%28novel%29">Casino Royale</a>", his first novel, at his <a href="Goldeneye%20%28estate%29">Goldeneye estate</a> in Jamaica. Fleming conducted research for "Live and Let Die", and completed the novel before "Casino Royale" was published in January 1953, four months before his second book was published. Fleming and his wife Ann flew to New York before taking the <a href="Silver%20Meteor">Silver Meteor</a> train to St. Petersburg in Florida and then flying on to Jamaica. In doing so they followed the same train route Fleming had taken with his friend Ivar Bryce in July 1943, when Fleming had first visited the island.

Once Fleming and his wife arrived at Goldeneye, he started work on the second Bond novel. In May 1963 he wrote an article for "Books and Bookmen" magazine describing his approach to writing, in which he said: "I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." As he had done with "Casino Royale", Fleming showed the manuscript to his friend, the writer <a href="William%20Plomer">William Plomer</a>, who reacted favourably to the story, telling Fleming that "the new book held this reader like a limpet mine & the denouement was shattering". On a trip to the US in May 1953 Fleming used his five-day travelling time on <a href="RMS%20Queen%20Elizabeth">RMS "Queen Elizabeth"</a> to correct the proofs of the novel.

Fleming intended the book to have a more serious tone than his <a href="debut%20novel">debut novel</a>, and he initially considered making the story a meditation on the nature of evil. The novel's original title, "The Undertaker's Wind", reflects this; the undertaker's wind, which was to act as a metaphor for the story, describes one of Jamaica's winds that "blows all the bad air out of the island".

The literary critic Daniel Ferreras Savoye considers the titles of Fleming's novels to have importance individually and collectively; "Live and Let Die", he writes, "turns an expression of collective wisdom, in this case fraternal and positive, into its exact opposite, suggesting a materialistic <a href="Epistemology">epistemological</a> outlook, individualistic and lucid". This is in keeping with the storyline in that Bond brings order without which "the world would quickly turn into the dystopian, barbarian reality feared by <a href="Thomas%20Hobbes">[Thomas] Hobbes</a> and celebrated by <a href="Marquis%20de%20Sade">[Marquis] de Sade</a>."

Although Fleming provided no dates within his novels, two writers have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the <a href="List%20of%20James%20Bond%20novels%20and%20short%20stories">novel series</a> as a whole. John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom have written books on behalf of <a href="Ian%20Fleming%20Publications">Ian Fleming Publications</a>—put the events of "Live and Let Die" in 1952; Griswold is more precise, and considers the story to have taken place in January and February that year.

Much of the novel draws from Fleming's personal experiences: the opening of the book, with Bond's arrival at New York's <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport">Idlewild Airport</a> was inspired by Fleming's own journeys in 1941 and 1953, and the warehouse at which Leiter is attacked by a shark was based on a similar building Fleming and his wife had visited in St. Petersburg, Florida on their recent journey. He also used his experiences on his two journeys on the Silver Meteor as background for the route taken by Bond and Solitaire.

Some of Fleming's friends had their names used in the story, with Ivar Bryce giving his name to the alias used by Bond, while another friend, Tommy Leiter, found his surname being used for Felix Leiter; Ivar Bryce's middle name of Felix was used for Leiter's first name, while John Fox-Strangways saw part of his surname being used for the name of the MI6 station chief in Jamaica. Fleming also used the name of the local Jamaican <a href="Rufous-throated%20solitaire">Rufous-throated solitaire</a> bird as the name of the book's main female character.
Fleming's experiences on his first scuba dive with <a href="Jacques%20Cousteau">Jacques Cousteau</a> in 1953 provided much of the description of Bond's swim to Mr Big's boat, while the concept of limpet-mining is probably based on the wartime activities of the elite <a href="Decima%20Flottiglia%20MAS">10th Light Flotilla</a>, a unit of Italian navy frogmen. Fleming also used, and extensively quoted, information about voodoo from his friend <a href="Patrick%20Leigh%20Fermor">Patrick Leigh Fermor</a>'s 1950 book "The Traveller's Tree", which had also been partly written at Goldeneye.

Fleming had a long-held interest in pirates, from the novels he read as a child, through to films such as "<a href="Captain%20Blood%20%281935%20film%29">Captain Blood</a>" (1935) with <a href="Errol%20Flynn">Errol Flynn</a>, which he enjoyed watching. From his Goldeneye home on Jamaica's northern shore, Fleming had visited <a href="Port%20Royal">Port Royal</a> on the south of the island, which was once the home port of Sir Henry Morgan, all of which stimulated Fleming's interest. For the background to Mr Big's treasure island, Fleming appropriated the details of Cabritta Island in <a href="Port%20Maria">Port Maria</a> Bay, which was the true location of Morgan's hoard.

Fleming builds the main character in "Live and Let Die" to make Bond come across as more human than in "Casino Royale", becoming "a much warmer, more likeable man from the opening chapter", according to the American novelist <a href="Raymond%20Benson">Raymond Benson</a>, who between 1997 and 2002 wrote a series of Bond novels and short stories. Savoye sees the introduction of a vulnerable side to Bond, identifying the agent's tears towards the end of the story as evidence of this. Similarly, over the course of the book, the American character Leiter develops and also emerges as a more complete and human character and his and Bond's friendship is evident in the story. Despite the relationship, Leiter is again subordinate to Bond. While in "Casino Royale" his role was to provide technical support and money to Bond, in "Live and Let Die" the character is secondary to Bond, and the only time he takes the initiative, he loses an arm and a leg, while Bond wins his own battle with the same opponent. Although Fleming had initially intended to kill Leiter off in the story, his American literary agent protested, and the character was saved.

Quarrel was Fleming's ideal concept of a black person, and the character was based on his genuine liking for Jamaicans, whom he saw as "full of goodwill and cheerfulness and humour". The relationship between Bond and Quarrel was based on a mutual assumption of Bond's superiority. Fleming described the relationship as "that of a Scots laird with his head stalker; authority was unspoken and there was no room for servility".

Fleming's villain was physically abnormal—as many of Bond's later adversaries were. Mr Big is described as being intellectually brilliant, with a "great football of a head, twice the normal size and very nearly round" and skin which was "grey-black, taut and shining like the face of a week-old corpse in the river". For Benson, "Mr Big is only an adequate villain", with little depth to him. According to the literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek, in his examination of 20th century British spy novels, "Live and Let Die" showed a departure from the "gentleman crook" that showed in much earlier literature, as the intellectual and organisational skills of Mr Big were emphasised, rather than the behavioural. Within Mr Big's organisation, Panek identifies Mr Big's henchmen as "merely incompetent gunsels" whom Bond can eliminate with relative ease.

Benson analysed Fleming's writing style and identified what he described as the "Fleming Sweep": a stylistic point that sweeps the reader from one chapter to another using 'hooks' at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next: Benson felt that the "Fleming Sweep never achieves a more engaging rhythm and flow" than in "Live and Let Die". The writer and academic <a href="Kingsley%20Amis">Kingsley Amis</a>—who also subsequently wrote a Bond novel—disagrees, and thinks that the story has "less narrative sweep than most". Parker considers the novel possibly Fleming's best, as it has a tight plot and is well paced throughout; he thinks the book "establishes the winning formula" for the stories that follow.

Savoye, comparing the structure of "Live and Let Die" with "Casino Royale", believes that the two books have open narratives which allow Fleming to continue with further books in the series. Savoye finds differences in the structure of the endings, with "Live and Let Die"s promise of future sexual encounters between Bond and Solitaire to be more credible than "Casino Royale"s ending, in which Bond vows to battle a super-criminal organisation.

Within the novel Fleming uses elements that are "pure Gothic", according to the essayist <a href="Umberto%20Eco">Umberto Eco</a>. This includes the description of Mr Big's death by shark attack, in which Bond watches as "Half of The Big Man's left arm came out of the water. It had no hand, no wrist, no wrist watch." Eco considers that this is "not just an example of macabre sarcasm; it is an emphasis on the essential by the inessential, typical of the ""." Benson considers that Fleming's experiences as a journalist, and his eye for detail, add to the verisimilitude displayed in the novel.

"Live and Let Die", like other Bond novels, reflects the changing roles of Britain and America during the 1950s and the perceived threat from the Soviet Union to both nations. Unlike "Casino Royale", where Cold War politics revolve around British-Soviet tensions, in "Live and Let Die" Bond arrives in Harlem to protect America from Soviet agents working through the <a href="Black%20Power%20movement">Black Power movement</a>. In the novel America was the Soviet objective and Bond comments "that New York 'must be the fattest atomic-bomb target on the whole face of the world'."

"Live and Let Die" also gave Fleming a chance to outline his views on what he saw as the increasing American colonisation of Jamaica—a subject that concerned both him and his neighbour <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a>. While the American Mr Big was unusual in appropriating an entire island, the rising number of American tourists to the islands was seen by Fleming as a threat to Jamaica; he wrote in the novel that Bond was "glad to be on his way to the soft green flanks of Jamaica and to leave behind the great hard continent of Eldollarado."

Bond's briefing also provides an opportunity for Fleming to offer his views on race through his characters. "M and Bond ... offer their views on the ethnicity of crime, views that reflected ignorance, the inherited racialist prejudices of London clubland", according to the cultural historian <a href="Jeremy%20Black%20%28historian%29">Jeremy Black</a>. Black also points out that "the frequency of his references and his willingness to offer racial stereotypes [was] typical of many writers of his age". The writer <a href="Louise%20Welsh">Louise Welsh</a> observes that ""Live and Let Die" taps into the paranoia that some sectors of white society were feeling" as the civil rights movements challenged prejudice and inequality. That insecurity manifested itself in opinions shared by Fleming with the intelligence industry, that the American <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> was a communist front. The communist threat was brought home to Jamaica with the 1952 arrest of the Jamaican politician <a href="Alexander%20Bustamante">Alexander Bustamante</a> by the American authorities while he was on official business in <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, despite the fact that he was avowedly anti-communist. During the course of the year local Jamaican political parties had also expelled members for being communists.

Friendship is another prominent element of "Live and Let Die", where the importance of male friends and allies shows through in Bond's relationships with Leiter and Quarrel. The more complete character profiles in the novel clearly show the strong relationship between Bond and Leiter, and this provides a strengthened motive for Bond to chase Mr Big in revenge for the shark attack on Leiter.

"Live and Let Die" continues the theme Fleming examined in "Casino Royale", that of evil or, as Fleming's biographer, <a href="Andrew%20Lycett">Andrew Lycett</a>, describes it, "the banality of evil". Fleming uses Mr Big as the vehicle to voice opinions on evil, particularly when he tells Bond that "Mister Bond, I suffer from boredom. I am prey to what the early Christians called '<a href="accidie">accidie</a>', the deadly lethargy that envelops those who are sated." This allowed Fleming to build the Bond character as a counter to the accidie, in what the writer saw as a <a href="Manichaean">Manichaean</a> struggle between good and evil. Benson considers evil as the main theme of the book, and highlights the discussion Bond has with <a href="List%20of%20James%20Bond%20allies%23Ren%C3%A9%20Mathis">René Mathis</a> of the French <a href="Deuxi%C3%A8me%20Bureau">Deuxième Bureau</a> in "Casino Royale", in which the Frenchman predicts Bond will seek out and kill the evil men of the world.

"Live and Let Die" was published in hardback by Jonathan Cape on 5 April 1954 and, as with "Casino Royale", Fleming designed the cover, which again featured the title lettering prominently. It had an initial print run of 7,500 copies which sold out, and a reprint of 2,000 copies was soon undertaken; by the end of the first year, a total of over 9,000 copies had been sold. In May 1954 "Live and Let Die" was banned in Ireland by the Irish <a href="Censorship%20in%20the%20Republic%20of%20Ireland">Censorship of Publications Board</a>. Lycett observed that the ban helped the general publicity in other territories. In October 1957 <a href="Pan%20Books">Pan Books</a> issued a paperback version which sold 50,000 copies in the first year.

"Live and Let Die" was published in the US in January 1955 by Macmillan; there was only one major change in the book, which was that the title of the fifth chapter was changed from "Nigger Heaven" to "Seventh Avenue". Sales in the US were poor, with only 5,000 copies sold in the first year of publication.

Philip Day of "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" noted "How wincingly well Mr Fleming writes", while the reviewer for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", thought that "[t]his is an ingenious affair, full of recondite knowledge and horrific spills and thrills – of slightly sadistic excitements also – though without the simple and bold design of its predecessor". Elizabeth L Sturch, writing in "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>", observed that Fleming was "without doubt the most interesting recent recruit among thriller-writers" and that "Live and Let Die" "fully maintains the promise of ... "Casino Royale"." Tempering her praise of the book, Sturch thought that "Mr Fleming works often on the edge of flippancy, rather in the spirit of a highbrow", although overall she felt that the novel "contains passages which for sheer excitement have not been surpassed by any modern writer of this kind". The reviewer for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" felt that "the book is continually exciting, whether it takes us into the heart of Harlem or describes an underwater swim in shark-infested waters; and it is more entertaining because Mr Fleming does not take it all too seriously himself". George Malcolm Thompson, writing in "<a href="The%20Evening%20Standard">The Evening Standard</a>", believed "Live and Let Die" to be "tense; ice-cold, sophisticated; <a href="Peter%20Cheyney">Peter Cheyney</a> for the carriage trade".

Writing in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Anthony%20Boucher">Anthony Boucher</a>—a critic described by Fleming's biographer, <a href="John%20Pearson%20%28author%29">John Pearson</a>, as "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—thought that the "high-spots are all effectively described ... but the narrative is loose and jerky". Boucher concluded that "Live and Let Die" was "a lurid meller contrived by mixing equal parts of Oppenheim and Spillane". In June 1955 <a href="Raymond%20Chandler">Raymond Chandler</a> was visiting the poet <a href="Stephen%20Spender">Stephen Spender</a> in London when he was introduced to Fleming, who subsequently sent Chandler a copy of "Live and Let Die". In response, Chandler wrote that Fleming was "probably the most forceful and driving writer of what I suppose still must be called thrillers in England".

"Live and Let Die" was adapted as a daily <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a> which was published in "<a href="Daily%20Express">The Daily Express</a>" newspaper and syndicated around the world. The adaptation ran from 15 December 1958 to 28 March 1959. The adaptation was written by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by <a href="John%20McLusky">John McLusky</a>, whose drawings of Bond had a resemblance to <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a>, the actor who portrayed Bond in "<a href="Dr.%20No%20%28film%29">Dr. No</a>" three years later.

Before "Live and Let Die" had been published, the producer <a href="Alexander%20Korda">Alexander Korda</a> had read a proof copy of the novel. He thought it was the most exciting story he had read for years, but was unsure whether it was suitable for a film. Nevertheless, he wanted to show the story to the directors <a href="David%20Lean">David Lean</a> and <a href="Carol%20Reed">Carol Reed</a> for their impressions, although nothing came of Korda's initial interest. In 1955, following the television broadcast of an adaptation of Fleming's earlier novel" <a href="Casino%20Royale%20%28Climax%21%29">Casino Royale</a>", <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> expressed an interest in "Live and Let Die", and offered $500 for an <a href="Option%20%28filmmaking%29">option</a>, against $5,000 if the film was made. Fleming thought the terms insufficient and turned them down.

"<a href="Live%20and%20Let%20Die%20%28film%29">Live and Let Die</a>", a film based loosely on the novel starring <a href="Roger%20Moore">Roger Moore</a> as Bond, was released in 1973, which played on the cycle of <a href="blaxploitation">blaxploitation</a> films produced at the time. The film was directed by <a href="Guy%20Hamilton">Guy Hamilton</a>, produced by <a href="Albert%20R.%20Broccoli">Albert R. Broccoli</a> and <a href="Harry%20Saltzman">Harry Saltzman</a>, and is the eighth in the <a href="Eon%20Productions">Eon Productions</a> <a href="List%20of%20James%20Bond%20films">Bond series</a>. Some scenes from the novel were depicted in later Bond films, including the sequence of Bond and Solitaire being dragged behind Mr Big's boat, which was used in the film "<a href="For%20Your%20Eyes%20Only%20%28film%29">For Your Eyes Only</a>", while Felix Leiter was not fed to a shark until "<a href="Licence%20to%20Kill">Licence to Kill</a>", which also faithfully adapts "Live and Let Die"s shoot-out in the warehouse.

Donald Hardman

<a href="Air%20Chief%20Marshal">Air Chief Marshal</a> Sir James Donald Innes Hardman, (21 December 1899 – 2 March 1982), known as Donald Hardman, was a senior <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> commander. He began his flying career as a <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighter</a> pilot in World War I, achieving nine victories to become an <a href="Flying%20ace">ace</a>. During World War II, Hardman held senior staff and operational posts. He was <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> (CAS) of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) from 1952 to 1954, after which he served as a member of the British <a href="Air%20Council">Air Council</a> until retiring in 1958.

Born in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, Hardman joined the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> in 1917 and was posted to France the following year. He flew <a href="Sopwith%20Dolphin">Sopwith Dolphin</a>s with <a href="No.%2019%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 19 Squadron</a>, earning the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> for his fighting skills. Between the wars he served with <a href="No.%2031%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 31 Squadron</a> in India and <a href="No.%20216%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 216 Squadron</a> in Egypt. A <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> at the outbreak of World War II, Hardman was attached to the <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> for several years before being posted in 1944 to <a href="South-East%20Asian%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South East Asia</a>, where he commanded No. 232 (Transport) Group during the <a href="Burma%20campaign">Burma campaign</a>. He was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in 1940 and a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in 1945, and was also <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a>.

Finishing the war an <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a>, Hardman served successively as Assistant Chief of the Air Staff, Commandant of <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Bracknell">RAF Staff College, Bracknell</a>, and Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of <a href="RAF%20Home%20Command">Home Command</a>, prior to becoming RAAF CAS in January 1952. He was appointed a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath</a> the same year. As CAS he was responsible for reorganising the RAAF's <a href="RAAF%20area%20commands">geographically based command-and-control system</a> into a functional structure. Returning to Britain, he became <a href="Air%20Member%20for%20Supply%20and%20Organisation">Air Member for Supply and Organisation</a> in May 1954, and was promoted to <a href="air%20chief%20marshal">air chief marshal</a> the following year. He was raised to <a href="Knight%20Grand%20Cross%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire</a> in January 1958, shortly before his retirement.

Born on 21 December 1899 in <a href="Oldham%2C%20Lancashire">Oldham, Lancashire</a>, James Donald Innes Hardman was the son of a master cotton-spinner, also named James, and his wife Wilhelmina. The younger James, known as Donald, attended <a href="Malvern%20College">Malvern College</a>. He began his military career in 1916 as a seventeen-year-old <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a> in the <a href="Artists%20Rifles">Artists Rifles</a>—part of the <a href="London%20Regiment">London Regiment</a>—and joined the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> (RFC) early the following year. Hardman was commissioned a temporary <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> on 10 May 1917 and confirmed in his rank on 21 July.

Prevented initially from seeing combat because of his youth, Hardman was eventually posted to <a href="No.%2019%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 19 Squadron</a> on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in February 1918, just as the unit was completing its conversion from <a href="SPAD%20S.VII">SPAD S.VII</a>s to <a href="Sopwith%20Dolphin">Sopwith Dolphin</a>s. He achieved his first aerial victory in May 1918. On 28 September, Hardman was promoted from <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> to temporary <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a>, and appointed as one of No. 19 Squadron's <a href="flight%20commander">flight commander</a>s. He scored two victories in one <a href="sortie">sortie</a> on 30 October 1918, when he led twelve Dolphins escorting <a href="Airco%20DH.9">DH.9</a> bombers of <a href="No.%2098%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 98 Squadron</a> to <a href="Mons">Mons</a>; in a dogfight that resulted in the loss of ten British aircraft, Hardman sent two German <a href="Fokker%20D.VII">Fokker D.VII</a>s down in flames. His "cool judgment and skill in leading" during this action earned him the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>; the award was promulgated on 11 February 1919. Hardman's final wartime tally was nine victories. The life expectancy for even an experienced RFC pilot on the Western Front was as little as three weeks; years later, Hardman admitted that he was still surprised he had survived.

Hardman's commission was terminated on 8 March 1919; the following year he commenced an economics degree at <a href="Hertford%20College%2C%20Oxford">Hertford College, Oxford</a>. On 18 October 1921, he joined the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) with a short-service commission as a <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a>, and was posted to <a href="British%20Raj">India</a>'s <a href="North-West%20Frontier%20Province%20%281901%E2%80%9355%29">North-West Frontier</a> in 1922. He served with <a href="No.%2031%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 31 Squadron</a>, an <a href="army%20cooperation">army cooperation</a> unit flying <a href="Bristol%20F.2%20Fighter">Bristol Fighters</a>. Hardman's commission was made permanent on 30 September 1925. Returning to Britain, he joined <a href="No.%2016%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 16 Squadron</a>, which operated Bristol Fighters out of <a href="Old%20Sarum">Old Sarum</a>, in September 1926. Hardman was promoted to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> on 1 July 1927, and attended the Armament and Gunnery School, <a href="Eastchurch">Eastchurch</a>, in 1928. He was then posted to the headquarters staff of <a href="No.%2022%20Group%20RAF">No. 22 (Army Co-operation) Group</a>, <a href="Farnborough%2C%20Hampshire">South Farnborough</a>.

On 8 July 1930, Hardman married Dorothy Ursula Ashcroft Thompson at <a href="St%20George%27s%2C%20Hanover%20Square">St George's, Hanover Square</a>, in London; the couple had two sons and a daughter. In September the following year, he was posted to <a href="Heliopolis%20%28Cairo%20suburb%29">Heliopolis</a>, Egypt, to serve with <a href="No.%20216%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 216 Squadron</a>. Tasked with bombing and transport duties, the squadron operated <a href="Vickers%20Victoria">Vickers Victoria</a>s and pioneered the air route from <a href="Lagos">Lagos</a> to <a href="Khartoum">Khartoum</a> in 1934. Returning to Britain, Hardman entered the <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">RAF Staff College, Andover</a>, in January 1935. After graduating, he was promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> on 1 February 1936. He served for the next two years as Staff Officer for Armament at No. 23 (Training) Group in <a href="Grantham">Grantham</a>. Hardman entered the British Army's <a href="Staff%20College%2C%20Camberley">Staff College, Camberley</a>, in January 1938, and was promoted to <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> on 1 January 1939.

At the onset of World War II, Hardman was sent to France with the RAF element of the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29">British Expeditionary Force</a>. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">Fall of France</a> in 1940, he served on the headquarters staff of No. 22 Group and was liaison officer with the British Army's Eastern Command, before taking charge of the Directorate of Military Co-operation—later the Directorate of Operations (Tactical)—at the <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a>. He was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> on 11 July 1940 for "distinguished services rendered in recent operations", and <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> on 1 January 1941. On 1 March 1941, he was promoted temporary <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>.

Hardman was promoted temporary <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> on 1 October 1944, and substantive group captain on 1 December. He was assigned to <a href="Far%20East%20Air%20Force%20%28Royal%20Air%20Force%29">Air Command South East Asia</a> (ACSEA) as the deputy commander—and RAF component commander—of the Combat Cargo Task Force (CCTF). Comprising RAF, <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a>, and <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> elements, CCTF was responsible for supplying the <a href="Fourteenth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Fourteenth Army</a> in <a href="Burma%20Campaign">Burma</a>. Hardman's final wartime posting, commencing in February 1945, was as <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> No. 232 (Transport) Group in <a href="Comilla">Comilla</a>, India (now Bangladesh). The group comprised the squadrons that formerly made up the RAF component of CCTF. Hardman described the Burma campaign as "a striking illustration of a fact new in warfare—namely that air power can be used to transport, supply and support ground troops entirely independent of ground channels. This has been South-East Asia's contribution to the art of war." He was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> on 5 July 1945 for "gallant and distinguished services in connection with the operations in Burma". The US government awarded him the <a href="Bronze%20Star%20Medal">Bronze Star</a>; permission to wear the decoration was gazetted on 15 March 1946.

Hardman was promoted to acting <a href="air%20vice-marshal">air vice-marshal</a> on 1 October 1945. He remained in South-East Asia following the cessation of hostilities, taking over as Air Officer in Charge of Administration for ACSEA (later Air Command Far East) in January 1946. After his return to Britain he was appointed to several senior posts in the RAF including, successively, Assistant Chief of the Air Staff (Operations) in May 1947, Commandant of <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Bracknell">RAF Staff College, Bracknell</a>, in January 1949, and Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of <a href="RAF%20Home%20Command">Home Command</a> in September 1951. Hardman's wartime rank of air commodore became substantive on 1 October 1946, and this was followed by substantive promotion to air vice-marshal on 1 July 1948. He was raised to acting <a href="air%20marshal">air marshal</a> on 1 October 1951.

On 14 January 1952, Hardman was appointed <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> (CAS) of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF), succeeding Air Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, who had served ten years in the position. The decision by Australia's <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a>, to appoint an RAF officer caused resentment in the RAAF. This was compounded when Menzies stated his reason as being that there was "no RAAF officer of sufficient age, or operational experience, to take the post of Chief of the Air Staff", which appeared to ignore the wartime records of such figures as <a href="John%20McCauley%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">John McCauley</a> and <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a>. "<a href="The%20Daily%20Mirror%20%28Australia%29">The Daily Mirror</a>" in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> was one of several media outlets to voice a "stern protest" over the matter. Menzies also felt that he could justify the appointment of an outsider on the grounds that the RAAF's <a href="RAAF%20area%20commands">geographically based command-and-control system</a> needed reorganisation along functional lines, a system with which a senior RAF member would be familiar. Britain's CAS, Marshal of the Royal Air Force <a href="John%20Slessor">Sir John Slessor</a>, was, somewhat reluctantly, responsible for fulfilling the Australian Government's request for a suitable officer. In putting forward Hardman as the "outstanding candidate" for the Australian post, Slessor tried to avoid what he called "the follies of some years ago", referring to Air Chief Marshal <a href="Charles%20Burnett%20%28RAF%20officer%29">Sir Charles Burnett</a>'s controversial tenure as CAS on secondment from the RAF early in World War II.

Hardman made two major changes to the structure of the Air Force to streamline command and control: integrating RAAF Headquarters, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, with the <a href="Department%20of%20Air%20%28Australia%29">Department of Air</a>, and supplanting the geographical area commands with three functional organisations, namely <a href="RAAF%20Home%20Command">Home</a> (operational), <a href="RAAF%20Training%20Command">Training</a>, and <a href="RAAF%20Maintenance%20Command">Maintenance Commands</a>. The functional command system has been described by historian Alan Stephens as Hardman's "major legacy to the RAAF". While doing away with the area command structure that had been favoured by Jones, Hardman carried on his predecessor's support for the local aircraft industry. He also formed a policy agreement with the <a href="Chief%20of%20Navy%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Naval Staff</a>, Vice Admiral <a href="John%20Augustine%20Collins">Sir John Collins</a>, covering joint responsibility and cooperation for maritime warfare. During Hardman's term as CAS, <a href="No.%2078%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 78 (Fighter) Wing</a> was re-equipped with RAF <a href="de%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BHavilland%20Vampire">de Havilland Vampire</a> jet fighters to garrison Malta and support British operations in the Mediterranean. He was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath</a> in the <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a> promulgated on 5 June 1952, and raised to substantive air marshal on 1 July.
As a protege of Slessor, Hardman proclaimed: "An air force without bombers isn't an air force". He maintained that the only way to attain "true and enduring air superiority" was by attacking the enemy's vital centres, which included its means of producing fighters. He recommended that the RAAF purchase one of Britain's <a href="Nuclear%20weapon">nuclear-capable</a> "<a href="V%20bomber">V bomber</a>s"—the <a href="Vickers%20Valiant">Vickers Valiant</a>, <a href="Handley%20Page%20Victor">Handley Page Victor</a>, or <a href="Avro%20Vulcan">Avro Vulcan</a>—though this never eventuated, and Australia's jet bomber remained the <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a> until the long-delayed introduction of the <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111C">General Dynamics F-111C</a> in 1973. Towards the end of his tenure as CAS, Hardman gave an interview in which he criticised <a href="Australian%20Army">Army</a> and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Navy</a> operations against a backdrop of continuing interservice rivalry for the defence budget. He was quoted as saying: "The Air Force in this country, for either defence or offence, is the only force worth while. It can be sent anywhere in the world to the point where it can do most good and be rapidly switched to any other point." In contrast to the initial disquiet at his appointment, upon his departure from Australia Hardman was described by "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" as "the outstanding CAS in the RAAF's history", a "brilliant organiser", and a "master of the theory of air power". He was succeeded by McCauley on 18 January 1954.

Hardman returned to Britain on the <a href="SS%20Himalaya">SS "Himalaya"</a>, and joined the British <a href="Air%20Council">Air Council</a> as <a href="Air%20Member%20for%20Supply%20and%20Organisation">Air Member for Supply and Organisation</a> on 1 May 1954, succeeding Air Chief Marshal <a href="John%20Whitworth-Jones">Sir John Whitworth-Jones</a>. In December, he represented the Air Council at No. 78 Wing's farewell parade in Malta, reminding the personnel gathered that he had been present at the wing's march through Sydney in July 1952, prior to its departure for the Mediterranean. He was promoted to <a href="air%20chief%20marshal">air chief marshal</a> on 1 April 1955. In July 1956, he presented a Squadron Standard to his old unit, No. 19 Squadron. That October, he presided over the inquiry into the <a href="1956%20London%20Heathrow%20Avro%20Vulcan%20crash">fatal crash of Vulcan "XA897"</a> at <a href="Heathrow%20Airport">Heathrow Airport</a> after its maiden round-the-world flight, the only survivors of the six crew members being the pilot and Air Marshal <a href="Harry%20Broadhurst">Sir Harry Broadhurst</a>. Hardman was succeeded as Air Member for Supply and Organisation by Air Chief Marshal <a href="Walter%20Dawson%20%28RAF%20officer%29">Sir Walter Dawson</a> on 1 January 1958, and was raised to <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire</a> the same day. He retired from the RAF on 29 January.

Hardman joined the board of New Electronic Products Ltd in May 1959. In February 1963, he succeeded Air Chief Marshal <a href="Douglas%20Evill">Sir Douglas Evill</a> as the <a href="RAF%20Benevolent%20Fund">RAF Benevolent Fund</a>'s honorary county representative for <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>. Sir Donald Hardman died on 2 March 1982, while holidaying in <a href="Estoril">Estoril</a>, Portugal, and was survived by his wife and children.

Appearing in late summer and autumn, <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> are found in <a href="deciduous%20forest">deciduous woodlands</a> on clay or chalky soils, or nearby parklands, sometimes in the form of <a href="fairy%20ring">fairy ring</a>s. Solid in shape, they resemble members of the genus "<a href="Tricholoma">Tricholoma</a>". The ivory to light grey-brown <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is up to 20 cm (8 in) across with a margin that is rolled inward. The sinuate <a href="gill%20%28mushroom%29">gill</a>s are pale and often yellowish, becoming pink as the <a href="spore">spore</a>s develop. The thick whitish <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> has no <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a>.

When young, it may be mistaken for the <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> St George's mushroom ("<a href="Calocybe%20gambosa">Calocybe gambosa</a>") or the miller ("<a href="Clitopilus%20prunulus">Clitopilus prunulus</a>"). It has been responsible for many cases of <a href="mushroom%20poisoning">mushroom poisoning</a> in Europe. "E. sinuatum" causes primarily <a href="gastrointestinal%20problem">gastrointestinal problem</a>s that, though not generally life-threatening, have been described as highly unpleasant. Delirium and depression are uncommon <a href="sequela">sequela</a>e. It is generally not considered to be lethal, although one source has reported deaths from the consumption of this mushroom.

The saga of this species' name begins in 1788 with the publication of part 8 of <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pierre%20Bulliard">Jean Baptiste Bulliard</a>'s "Herbier de la France". In it was plate 382, representing a mushroom which he called "<a href="Agaricus">Agaricus</a> lividus". In 1872, <a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Quélet</a> took up a species which he called ""<a href="Entoloma">Entoloma</a> lividus" Bull."; although all subsequent agree that this is a fairly clear reference to Bulliard's name, Quélet gave a description that is generally considered to be that of a different species from Bulliard's. In the meantime, 1801 had seen the description of "Agaricus sinuatus" by <a href="Christian%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christian Persoon</a> in his "<a href="Synopsis%20Methodica%20Fungorum">Synopsis Methodica Fungorum</a>". He based that name on another plate (number 579) published in the last part of Bulliard's work, and which the latter had labelled "agaric sinué". German mycologist <a href="Paul%20Kummer">Paul Kummer</a> reclassified it as "Entoloma sinuatum" in 1871.

For many years Quélet's name and description were treated as valid because Bulliard's name antedated Persoon's. However, in 1950, a change in the "<a href="International%20Code%20of%20Botanical%20Nomenclature">International Code of Botanical Nomenclature</a>" (termed the Stockholm Code, after the city where the International Botanical Congress was being held) caused only names on fungi published after 1801 or 1821 (depending on their type) to be valid. This meant that suddenly Bulliard's name was no longer a valid name, and now it was Persoon's name that had priority. Nonetheless it was a well-known name, and the already chaotic situation caused by a change to a famous Latin name was further complicated by another of Quélet's suggestions. He had in 1886 proposed a new, broader genus that included all pink-gilled fungi with <a href="Lamella%20%28mycology%29%23Classification">adnate or sinuate gills</a> and angular spores: "Rhodophyllus". These two approach to genus placement, using either "Rhodophyllus" or "Entoloma", coexisted for many decades, with mycologists and guidebooks following either; <a href="Henri%20Romagnesi">Henri Romagnesi</a>, who studied the genus for over forty years, favoured "Rhodophyllus", as initially did <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a>. However, most other authorities have tended to favour "Entoloma", and Singer conceded the name was far more widely used and adopted it for his "Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy" text in 1986.

In the meantime, it had been widely accepted that the 1950 change to the Stockholm Code caused more problems than they solved, and in 1981, the Sydney Code reinstated the validity of pre-1801 names, but created the status of <a href="sanctioned%20name">sanctioned name</a> for those used in the foundational works of Persoon and <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a>. Thus "Entoloma sinuatum", which Fries had sanctioned, still had to be used for the species described by Quélet even though Bulliard's name was the older one. At about the same time, <a href="Machiel%20Noordeloos">Machiel Noordeloos</a> re-examined Bulliard's name in more details, and discovered that not only was it <a href="Illegitimate%20name">illegitimate</a> (and thus not available for use) because <a href="William%20Hudson%20%28botanist%29">William Hudson</a> had already used it ten years earlier for a different species, but Bulliard's illustration was clearly not an "Entoloma", but a species of "<a href="Pluteus">Pluteus</a>", a genus that is only distantly related to "Entoloma". As this made Quélet's name definitely unusable for the "Entoloma", and because at the time he and Romagnesi believed there were ground to treat Quélet's ""E. lividum"" and Persoon's "E. sinuatum" as separate species, he had to coin a third name for Quélet's species: "Entoloma eulividum". He however later changed his mind on this issue, combining again his own "Entoloma eulividum" and "E. sinuatum", so that Persoon's name is now universally recognised. Because it was previously widely used and Quélet had provided a good description and illustration (which, the proposer argued, was better considered as a new species rather than a mere placement of Bulliard's name in another genus), a proposal was made in 1999 to <a href="Conserved%20name">conserve</a> "Entoloma lividum" and thus restore its use. However, it failed because "E. sinuatum" had already been in use (if not universally) for many years and was thus a well-known name for the species.
The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "sinuatum" is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "wavy", referring to the shape of the cap, while the generic name is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words "entos/ἐντός" "inner" and "lóma/λῶμα" "fringe" or "hem" from the inrolled margin. The specific epithet "lividum" was derived from the Latin word "līvǐdus" "lead-coloured". The various <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s include livid entoloma, livid agaric, livid pinkgill, leaden entoloma, lead poisoner, and grey pinkgill. In the <a href="Dijon">Dijon</a> region of France it was known as "le grand empoisonneur de la <a href="C%C3%B4te-d%27Or">Côte-d'Or</a>" ("the great poisoner of "Côte d'Or""). Quélet himself, who was poisoned by the fungus, called it "the miller's purge", akin to another common name of false miller.

Within the large genus "Entoloma", which contains around 1500 species, "E. sinuatum" has been classically placed in the <a href="section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "Entoloma" within the <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "Entoloma", as it is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus. A 2009 study analysing <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a>s and spore <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> found it to lie in a rhodopolioid <a href="clade">clade</a> with (among other species) "<a href="Entoloma%20sordidulum">E. sordidulum</a>", "<a href="Entoloma%20politum">E. politum</a>" and "<a href="Entoloma%20rhodopolium">E. rhodopolium</a>", and most closely related to "E." sp. 1. This rhodopolioid clade lay within a crown "Entoloma" clade.

The largest member of its genus, "Entoloma sinuatum" has an imposing <a href="epigeous">epigeous</a> (aboveground) <a href="fruiting%20body">fruiting body</a> (basidiocarp), bearing a <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> 6–20 cm (–6 in) wide, though diameters of 30 cm (10 in) have been recorded. It is convex to flat, often with a blunt <a href="umbo%20%28mycology%29">umbo</a> in its centre and wavy margins, ivory white to light grey-brown in colour, and darkening with age. The distant <a href="Lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are sinuate (notched at their point of attachment to the <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>) to almost free, generally (but not always) yellowish white before darkening to pink and then red. Interspersed between the gills are lamellulae (short gills that do not extend completely from the cap margin to the stipe). When viewed from beneath, a characteristic groove colloquially known as a "moat" can be seen in the gill pattern circumnavigating the stalk. The <a href="form%20%28botany%29">form</a> lacking yellow colour on the gills is rare but widespread, and has been recorded from Austria, France and the Netherlands.

The stout white stipe lacks a <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> and is anywhere from 4 to 20 cm (1.6–6 in) high, and 0.5–4 cm (0.2–1.6 in) in diameter. It may be bulbous at the base. The taste is mild, although it may be unpleasant. The mushroom's strong and unusual odour can be hard to describe; it may smell of flour, though is often unpleasant and <a href="wikt%3Arancid">rancid</a>. The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is reddish-brown, with angular spores 8–11 × 7–9.5 <a href="micrometre">μm</a>, roughly six-sided and globular in shape. The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> are four-spored and clamped. The gill edge is fertile, and <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> are absent.

Confusion with the highly regarded miller or sweetbread mushroom ("<a href="Clitopilus%20prunulus">Clitopilus prunulus</a>") is a common cause of poisoning in France; the latter fungus has a greyish-white downy cap and whitish decurrent gills which turn pink with maturity. Young fruit bodies of "Entoloma sinuatum" can also be confused with St George's mushroom ("<a href="Calocybe%20gambosa">Calocybe gambosa</a>"), although the gills of the latter are crowded and cream in colour, and the clouded agaric ("<a href="Clitocybe%20nebularis">Clitocybe nebularis</a>"), which has whitish decurrent gills and an unusual odour. To complicate matters, it often grows near these edible species. Its overall size and shape resemble members of the genus "<a href="Tricholoma">Tricholoma</a>", although the spore colour (white in "Tricholoma", pinkish in "Entoloma") and shape (angular in "Entoloma") help distinguish it. The rare and edible all-white dovelike tricholoma ("<a href="Tricholoma%20columbetta">T. columbetta</a>") has a satiny cap and stem and a faint, not mealy, odour. "E. sinuatum" may be confused with "<a href="Clitocybe%20multiceps">Clitocybe multiceps</a>" in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> of North America, although the latter has white spores and generally grows in clumps. A casual observer may mistake it for an edible field mushroom ("<a href="Agaricus%20campestris">Agaricus campestris</a>"), but this species has a ring on the stipe, pink gills that become chocolate-brown in maturity, and a dark brown spore print. The poorly known North American species "<a href="Entoloma%20albidum">E. albidum</a>" resembles "E. sinuatum" but is likewise poisonous.

"Entoloma sinuatum" is fairly common and widespread across North America as far south as <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>. It also occurs throughout Europe and the British Isles including Ireland, though it is more common in southern and central parts of Europe than the northwest. In Asia, it has been recorded in the Black Sea region, and <a href="Ad%C4%B1yaman%20Province">Adıyaman Province</a> in Turkey, Iran, and northern <a href="Yunnan">Yunnan</a> in China.

The fruit bodies of "E. sinuatum" grow solitarily or in groups, and have been found forming <a href="fairy%20ring">fairy ring</a>s. Fruit bodies appear mainly in autumn, and also in summer in North America, while in Europe the season is reported as late summer and autumn. They are found in <a href="temperate%20deciduous%20forest">deciduous woodlands</a> under <a href="oak">oak</a>, <a href="beech">beech</a>, and less commonly <a href="birch">birch</a>, often on clay or <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a> (chalky) soils, but they may spread to in parks, fields and grassy areas nearby. Most members of the genus are <a href="Saprotrophic%20nutrition">saprotrophic</a>, although this species has been recorded as forming an <a href="Mycorrhiza%23Ectomycorrhiza">ectomycorrhizal</a> relationship with willow ("<a href="Salix">Salix</a>").

This fungus has been cited as being responsible for 10% of all <a href="mushroom%20poisoning">mushroom poisoning</a>s in Europe. For example, 70 people required hospital treatment in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> alone in 1983, and the fungus accounted for 33 of 145 cases of mushroom poisoning in a five-year period at a single hospital in <a href="Parma">Parma</a>. Poisoning is said to be mainly <a href="human%20gastrointestinal%20tract">gastrointestinal</a> in nature; symptoms of <a href="diarrhoea">diarrhoea</a>, vomiting and headache occur 30 minutes to 2 hours after consumption and last for up to 48 hours. Acute liver toxicity and psychiatric symptoms like mood disturbance or <a href="delirium">delirium</a> may occur. Rarely, symptoms of depression may last for months. At least one source reports there have been fatalities in adults and children. Hospital treatment of poisoning by this mushroom is usually <a href="palliative%20care">supportive</a>; <a href="antispasmodic">antispasmodic</a> medicines may lessen <a href="wikt%3Acolic">colicky</a> abdominal cramps and <a href="Activated%20carbon%23Medical%20applications">activated charcoal</a> may be administered early on to bind residual toxin. <a href="Intravenous%20therapy">Intravenous</a> fluids may be required if dehydration has been extensive, especially with children and the elderly. <a href="Metoclopramide">Metoclopramide</a> may be used in cases of recurrent vomiting once gastric contents are emptied. The identity of the toxin(s) is unknown, but <a href="chemical%20analysis">chemical analysis</a> has established that there are <a href="alkaloid">alkaloid</a>s present in the mushroom.

A study of <a href="trace%20element">trace element</a>s in mushrooms in the eastern <a href="Black%20Sea%20Region">Black Sea Region</a> of Turkey found "E. sinuatum" to have the highest levels of <a href="copper">copper</a> (64.8 ± 5.9 μg/g <a href="Dry%20matter">dried material</a>—insufficient to be toxic) and <a href="zinc">zinc</a> (198 μg/g) recorded. Caps and stalks tested in an area with high levels of <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> in southeastern Poland showed it to <a href="bioaccumulation">bioaccumulate</a> much higher levels of mercury than other fungi. The element was also found in high levels in the <a href="humus">humus</a>-rich substrate. "Entoloma sinuatum" also accumulates <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>-containing compounds. Of the roughly 40 μg of arsenic present per gram of fresh mushroom tissue, about 8% was <a href="arsenite">arsenite</a> and the other 92% was <a href="arsenate">arsenate</a>.

Banded sugar ant

The banded sugar ant ("Camponotus consobrinus"), also known as the sugar ant, is a species of ant native to <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. A member of the genus "<a href="Camponotus">Camponotus</a>" in the subfamily <a href="Formicinae">Formicinae</a>, it was <a href="species%20description">described</a> by German entomologist <a href="Wilhelm%20Ferdinand%20Erichson">Wilhelm Ferdinand Erichson</a> in 1842. Its common name refers to the ant's liking for sugar and sweet food, as well as the distinctive orange-brown band that wraps around its <a href="Gaster%20%28insect%20anatomy%29">gaster</a>.

The ant is <a href="Polymorphism%20%28biology%29">polymorphic</a> and relatively large, with two different castes of workers: major workers (also known as soldiers), and minor workers. These two group of workers measure around in length, while the queen ants are even larger. Mainly nocturnal, banded sugar ants prefer a <a href="mesic%20habitat">mesic habitat</a>, and are commonly found in forests and woodlands. They also occur in urban areas, where they are considered a household pest. The ant's diet includes <a href="honeydew%20%28secretion%29">sweet secretions</a> that are retrieved from <a href="aphid">aphid</a>s and other insects that it tends. This species is a competitor of the <a href="meat%20ant">meat ant</a> ("Iridomyrmex purpureus"), and food robbery and nest-plugging is known to occur between these two ants. Workers prey on insects, killing them with a spray of <a href="formic%20acid">formic acid</a>. Banded sugar ants are preyed upon by other ants, echidnas, and birds. The eggs of this species were consumed by <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australians</a>.

The banded sugar ant was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> by German entomologist <a href="Wilhelm%20Ferdinand%20Erichson">Wilhelm Ferdinand Erichson</a>, who named it "Formica consobrina" in 1842. The <a href="holotype">holotype</a> specimen is a queen collected from <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, which is now housed in the <a href="Museum%20f%C3%BCr%20Naturkunde">Museum für Naturkunde</a> in Berlin. "Formica consobrina" was later moved to the genus "Camponotus" as "Camponotus consobrinus", by entomologist <a href="Julius%20Roger">Julius Roger</a> in 1863. In 1933, American entomologist <a href="William%20Morton%20Wheeler">William Morton Wheeler</a> described some subspecies and variants of the banded sugar ant. These subspecies were "C. consobrinus lividipes" and "C. consobrinus nigriceps", while the variants were "C. consobrinus var. obniger" and "C. consobrinus var. perthianus". Some of these classifications were short-lived; "C. consobrinus nigriceps" was later revived as a full species in 1934 as "<a href="Camponotus%20nigriceps">C. nigriceps</a>", while "C. consobrinus lividipes" was synonymised with "C. consobrinus". "C. consobrinus lividipes" was treated as a subspecies for "C. nigriceps" in 1985, now known as "C. nigriceps lividipes". In 1996 "C. consobrinus perthianus" was synonymised with "C. nigriceps", and "C. consobrinus var. obniger" was synonymised with "C. consobrinus".

The <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> is derived from the Latin word "consobrina", meaning "cousin". This is in reference to its similar appearance with the species "<a href="Camponotus%20herculeanus">C. herculeanus</a>".

The ant is a member of the "Camponotus nigriceps" <a href="Species%20complex">species group</a>, which also includes "<a href="Camponotus%20clarior">C. clarior</a>", "<a href="Camponotus%20dryandrae">C. dryandrae</a>", "<a href="Camponotus%20eastwoodi">C. eastwoodi</a>", "<a href="Camponotus%20loweryi">C. loweryi</a>", "<a href="Camponotus%20longideclivis">C. longideclivis</a>", "C. nigriceps", "<a href="Camponotus%20pallidiceps">C. pallidiceps</a>" and "<a href="Camponotus%20prostans">C. prostans</a>". The species is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the banded sugar ant or sugar ant due to its attraction to sweet food and the orange-brown band that is present on its <a href="Gaster%20%28insect%20anatomy%29">gaster</a>.

Banded sugar ants appear in different forms, varying from in length, making them a large species. Banded sugar ants are <a href="Polymorphism%20%28biology%29">polymorphic</a>, and colonies have two types of workers: minor workers and major workers that have different size ranges. The two <a href="Eusociality">castes</a> can be identified easily, due to the workers being smaller and more slender, while the soldiers are larger and more robust. Both castes carry a set of powerful <a href="Mandible%20%28insect%20mouthpart%29">mandibles</a>. Queen ants are the largest ants in the colony. Banded sugar ants come in a variety of colours, possibly due to ecological rather than genetic influences. For example, humidity, insolation and temperature may all affect the colour of an individual.

Female banded sugar ants are easily recognised by their black head, orange <a href="Thorax%20%28insect%20anatomy%29">thorax</a> and the orange-brown band that wraps around their gaster. Males of the species are completely black. The dark sides of the thorax and legs are ferruginous (rusty in colour). The <a href="Antenna%20%28biology%29">scape</a> (the base of the antenna) and <a href="mandibles">mandibles</a> are black, and the head is wider than the thorax. The thorax is longer than its total width and slightly compressed, and the gaster is covered with tiny black dots. Erect <a href="setae">setae</a> are golden in colour and absent under the head but present on the <a href="mesosoma">mesosoma</a>. The setae on the <a href="Arthropod%20leg%23Tibia">tibia</a> and scape are shorter than those on the mesosoma. The <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Anterior%20and%20posterior">anterior</a> of the gaster is lighter in colour compared to the <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Anterior%20and%20posterior">posterior</a>, and the <a href="Dorsum%20%28anatomy%29">dorsum</a> of the mesosoma is outlined and curved. A worker's <a href="Metathorax">metanotum</a> is absent and the eyes are bulging, while a soldier's metanotum is noticeable and the eyes are flat. The wings on the queen are dark, and the <a href="Glossary%20of%20entomology%20terms%23S%E2%80%93Z">stigmata</a> and nerves are yellow. While many ant species have a <a href="metapleural%20gland">metapleural gland</a>, the gland is not present in the banded sugar ant; the number of <a href="Malpighian%20tubule%20system">malpighian tubules</a> in workers is 21.

The related black-headed sugar ant ("Camponotus nigriceps") has a similar appearance and may be mistaken for a banded sugar ant. Black-headed sugar ants are lighter in colour than banded sugar ants and the orange-brown band is absent from their gaster.

The banded sugar ant is one of the most widely distributed ants in Australia, but is most commonly found in south-east Australia. It occurs along the north-east coast of <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, from <a href="Charters%20Towers">Charters Towers</a> in the north to <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> in the south. The ant is widespread in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, the <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Australian Capital Territory</a>, <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> and Tasmania. In <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>, it is a common household pest in <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, and populations are mostly found in the south-east of the state while the species is absent in the north-west. The banded sugar ant's presence in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> has yet to be verified. These ants are found in urban areas, eucalypt forests, <a href="dry%20sclerophyll">dry sclerophyll</a> woodland, grasslands and heaths, preferring a <a href="mesic%20habitat">mesic habitat</a>. In the drier regions of Australia, the banded sugar ant is absent and is usually replaced by "Camponotus nigriceps". Banded sugar ants have been recorded from elevations ranging from .

Nests are found in a variety of sites, including holes in wood, roots of plants, twigs of trees and shrubs, between rocks, in the soil, and under paving stones. Sometimes, banded sugar ant colonies form small mounds, which are less than 20 cm (8 in) in diameter and usually funnel-shaped and <a href="Ephemerality">ephemeral</a>. Mounds are not constructed in undisturbed regions where <a href="land%20degradation">land degradation</a> has not occurred. Instead, the entrance of a nest consists of a smooth-walled vertical shaft that is in diameter. Chambers in the nest have a similar appearance to the nest entrance (shaft-like walls), and the floors within the chambers are typically in length with an arched roof that is in height. Excavated <a href="meat%20ant">meat ant</a> nests show that banded sugar ants will also inhabit them.

Banded sugar ants are the dominant group of <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a> ants in their range. Workers are mostly encountered at dusk when they are foraging for food on marked trails or on "<a href="Casuarina">Casuarina</a>" and "<a href="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a>" trees. These ants also forage during the day, but they are more frequently seen at night. They are also more active during the warmer seasons, especially summer. Banded sugar ants use multiple social techniques to make other ants follow them to a food source; this includes a worker carrying another worker, <a href="tandem%20running">tandem running</a>, or simply leaving a <a href="Trail%20pheromone">pheromone trail</a> to the source. Around 2–35% of foraging workers engage in tandem running.

Banded sugar ants will often attack the nests of other ant species at random, while ignoring other ants nearby. They use their mandibles to hold opponents, and use <a href="formic%20acid">formic acid</a> to kill them. Foraging workers use <a href="Sensory%20cue%23Visual%20Cues">visual cues</a> to help them find their way around, or to let them determine that they are lost; workers will identify landmarks they are familiar with to orientate themselves. When provoked, an individual banded sugar ant will lift up its abdomen and use its large mandibles to fend off an attacker. If further provoked, it can defend itself by spraying formic acid from its abdomen to deter predators.
A common competitor of sugar ants are <a href="meat%20ant">meat ant</a>s, which have been observed blocking banded sugar ant nesting holes with pebbles and soil to prevent them from leaving their nest during the early hours of the day. The ants counter this by preventing meat ants from leaving their nest by blocking their nesting holes with debris, a behaviour known as nest-plugging. If meat ant nests are encroached by trees or other shade, banded sugar ants may invade and take over the nest, since the health of the colony may deteriorate from overshadowing. Members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is placed in a suitable area, while invading banded sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material. In a 1999 study, "<a href="Pogonoscopus%20myrmex">Pogonoscopus myrmex</a>" leafhoppers were placed in a banded sugar ant colony to test the reaction of <a href="Symbiosis">non-host</a> ants. These leafhoppers were attacked, suggesting no symbiotic relationship between the two.

<a href="Starlings">Starlings</a> have been observed to rub banded sugar ants on their feathers and skin, a behaviour known as <a href="Anting%20%28bird%20activity%29">anting</a>.

Banded sugar ants are <a href="omnivores">omnivores</a> and feed on sweet substances. They tend plant-eating insects such as <a href="aphid">aphid</a>s, and feed on the <a href="honeydew%20%28secretion%29">fluids</a> they secrete. Honeydew secretions are produced from the anus of the aphid, which is later provided to the ants. This behaviour is mutually beneficial to both organisms, as the ants protect the aphids from predation and the aphids provides a nutritious liquid to the ants. Banded sugar ants also tend the larvae of the southern purple azure butterfly ("<a href="Ogyris%20genoveva">Ogyris genoveva</a>"). They are visitors to flowers of "<a href="Eucalyptus%20globulus">Eucalyptus globulus</a>" trees, where they can act as pollinators. They may be seen at night foraging under lights in urban areas for arthropod prey, such as termites and the southern cattle tick ("<a href="Rhipicephalus%20microplus">Rhipicephalus microplus</a>"). During the night, banded sugar ants are known to "rob" food sources excreted by <a href="Hemiptera">Hemiptera</a> insects that are fed on by meat ants during the day. Banded sugar ants and meat ants tend to nest near one another, and areas where the two ants forage have shorter foraging periods due to interference between the species. However, banded sugar ants are nocturnal while meat ants are not, so foraging periods are extended by one or two hours if no interference occurs.

Banded sugar ants have been found in the feces of the <a href="short-beaked%20echidna">short-beaked echidna</a> ("Tachyglossus aculeatus"), and non-passerine birds are known to predate them. The blackish blindsnake ("<a href="Ramphotyphlops%20nigrescens">Ramphotyphlops nigrescens</a>") follows trails laid by banded sugar ants, possibly to locate them as potential prey. Blindsnakes are also known to consume the brood of this species. <a href="Nematode">Nematode</a>s are a parasite to banded sugar ant larvae, as several <a href="mermithergate">mermithergate</a> larvae were described. Infected individuals are recognisable by their swollen gasters; for example, uninfected ants measuring in length have a gaster length of while the gaster of infected individuals who are similar in size is . Some specimens collected had gasters so swollen that the intersegmental-membrane was exposed.

Like all ants, banded sugar ants begin life as eggs. If the egg is fertilised, the ant becomes a female; if not, it will become a male. They develop through <a href="complete%20metamorphosis">complete metamorphosis</a>, meaning that they pass through a larval and pupal stage before emerging as adults.

Although most banded sugar ant colonies are <a href="Gyne">monogynous</a> (a nest that contains a single queen), some have been found to be <a href="Gyne">polygynous</a>, where a colony will have multiple queens; this is the fourth "Camponotus" species that is recognized as exhibiting polygyny. In polygynous colonies, queens are not territorial and free-mixing of offspring is observed. Despite the homogeneous environmental factors, however, different family lineages are strongly correlated with ant caste, suggesting caste is largely genetically determined. Nests containing a single queen are <a href="monandrous">monandrous</a>, where a queen will only mate once with a male. Not much is known about their <a href="nuptial%20flight">nuptial flight</a>, although virgin queens and males (<a href="alate">alate</a>s) were observed mating in South Australia in January; and in early December in Southeast Queensland (2017). This hints that banded sugar ants will mate during mid-summer, and colony foundation occurs at this time. Ideal conditions for nuptial flight is on warm days during the afternoon at temperatures of 20–25 °C (68–77 °F), which is when the alates begin to swarm. A colony can be long-lived, with queens living for seven years or more. The black carpenter ant ("<a href="Camponotus%20pennsylvanicus">Camponotus pennsylvanicus</a>") is known to adopt larvae and pupae from banded sugar ant colonies.

Workers that belong to different matrilines (female ancestry) appear significantly different from each other in size. Matrilines are also said to influence caste determination within the species.

The banded sugar ant is considered a household pest and is occasionally seen in houses at night, capable of damaging furniture and fittings by chewing the wood; <a href="carbon%20disulphide">carbon disulphide</a> is used to treat and remove a banded sugar ant nest. These ants do not pose any threat to humans, as they are incapable of stinging and can only spray formic acid, however, the larger soldiers are capable of inflicting a painful bite with their powerful jaws, and the formic acid they spray is <a href="corrosive%20substance">corrosive</a> to human skin. The eggs of this species were consumed by the <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Australian Aborigines</a>.

Victoria Cross for New Zealand

The Victoria Cross for New Zealand (VC) is a <a href="military%20decoration">military decoration</a> awarded for valour or gallantry in the presence of the enemy to members of the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Defence%20Force">New Zealand Armed Forces</a>. It may be awarded to a person of any <a href="Military%20rank">rank</a> in any service and civilians under military command, and is presented to the recipient by the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20New%20Zealand">Governor-General of New Zealand</a> during an investiture held at <a href="Government%20House%2C%20Wellington">Government House, Wellington</a>. As the highest award for gallantry in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> it takes precedence over all other <a href="Post-nominal%20letters">postnominals</a> and medals.

The Victoria Cross for New Zealand was established in 1999 when New Zealand created a new award system that replaced several Commonwealth honours with New Zealand awards. It has been awarded once, on 2 July 2007 to Corporal <a href="Willie%20Apiata">Willie Apiata</a> for actions in 2004.

The original British <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> was introduced in 1856 by <a href="Victoria%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> to reward acts of valour during the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>. That medal had been awarded 25 times to 24 individual military personnel from New Zealand; <a href="Charles%20Upham">Captain Charles Upham</a> receiving a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a>. Only 14 medals have been awarded since the end of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. The medal is made from the <a href="gunmetal">gunmetal</a> of a weapon supposedly captured at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Sevastopol%20%281854%E2%80%931855%29">siege of Sevastopol</a>, but several historians have since questioned the true origin of the gunmetal. Originally all <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> recipients were issued with the same award, but over the last 50 years, some Commonwealth countries have introduced separate award systems; three of these retain "Victoria Cross" as part of the name of the highest award for gallantry.

The original <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> was created by <a href="Victoria%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> in 1856 to recognise incidents of gallantry that were unconnected with a man's lengthy or meritorious service. She signed a Royal Warrant on 29 January 1856 that officially instituted the VC. The order was retroactive to 1854 to recognise acts of valour during the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>.

The Australian and New Zealand Victoria Crosses are made from the same gunmetal as the originals. It was originally intended that the VCs would be cast from the <a href="bronze">bronze</a> <a href="wikt%3Acascabel">cascabels</a> of two <a href="cannon">cannon</a> that were captured from the Russians at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Sevastopol%20%281854%E2%80%931855%29">siege of Sevastopol</a>. The historian John Glanfield has since shown that the metal used for VCs is in fact from Chinese cannon not Russian, and their origin is a mystery.

The barrels of the cannon in question are stationed outside the Officers' Mess at the <a href="Royal%20Artillery%20Barracks">Royal Artillery Barracks</a> at <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a>. The remaining portion of the only remaining cascabel, weighing 10 kilograms (385 oz), is stored in a vault maintained by 15 Regiment <a href="Royal%20Logistic%20Corps">Royal Logistic Corps</a> at <a href="MoD%20Donnington">MoD Donnington</a>. It can only be removed under armed guard. It is estimated that approximately 80 to 85 more VCs could be cast from this source. A single company of jewellers, <a href="Hancocks">Hancocks of London</a>, has been responsible for the production of every VC.

In the last 60 years several <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> countries have introduced their own honours systems, separate from the <a href="British%20Honours%20System">British Honours System</a>. Australia, Canada and New Zealand have each introduced their own decorations for gallantry and bravery, replacing British decorations such as the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> with their own awards. Most Commonwealth countries, however, still recognise some form of the VC as their highest decoration for valour.

Australia was the first Commonwealth nation to create its own VC, on 15 January 1991. Although it is a separate award, its appearance is identical to its British counterpart. Canada followed suit when in 1993 Queen Elizabeth signed Letters Patent creating the Canadian VC, which is also similar to the British version, except that the legend has been changed from to the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> . The New Zealand and Australian awards are still made by the jewellers Hancocks from the gunmetal used for the originals. The Canadian Victoria Cross also includes metal from the same cannon, along with copper and other metals from all regions of Canada.

New Zealand was the third country to create the VC as part of its own honours system. On 21 September 1999, Prime Minister <a href="Jenny%20Shipley">Jenny Shipley</a> announced that the Queen had approved the formal institution of a <a href="New%20Zealand%20gallantry%20awards">new range of Royal awards</a> to recognise acts of gallantry and bravery performed by New Zealanders. The awards were designed to be the final major element in the development of a distinct New Zealand Royal honours system.

The start of the process came with proposals released in 1995 by the "Honours Advisory Committee" that reviewed the honours system. Until May 1996, New Zealand made recommendations for various British awards for acts of gallantry performed during military operations and acts of bravery by civilians including the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> and <a href="George%20Cross">George Cross</a>. However, the British Government's review and simplification of their awards system provided an ideal opportunity for New Zealand to also develop a unique and simplified system.

The Victoria Cross for New Zealand is identical to the original design. The decoration is a <a href="cross%20patt%C3%A9e">cross pattée</a>, high, wide, bearing a crown surmounted by a lion, and the inscription . This was originally to have been , until it was changed on the recommendation of <a href="Victoria%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>, who thought some might erroneously consider that only the recipients of the VC were brave in battle. The decoration, suspension bar and link weigh about 27 grams (0.87 <a href="troy%20ounce">troy ounce</a>s).

The cross is suspended by a ring from a <a href="serif">serif</a>fed "V" to a bar ornamented with laurel leaves, through which the ribbon passes. The reverse of the suspension bar is engraved with the recipient's name, rank, number and unit. On the reverse of the medal is a circular panel on which the date of the act for which it was awarded is engraved in the centre. The ribbon is crimson, 38 millimetres (1.5 inches) wide. Although the warrants state the colour as being red it is described by most commentators as being crimson or "wine-red".

The Victoria Cross for New Zealand is awarded for 

The power of awarding the medal officially resides with the <a href="Queen%20of%20New%20Zealand">Queen of New Zealand</a>. The Royal Warrant states that the "Awards of a New Zealand Gallantry Award and of a Bar to an Award shall be made by Us, Our Heirs and Successors, only on a recommendation by Our Prime Minister of New Zealand or a Minister of the Crown acting for Our Prime Minister." As with the original Victoria Cross any recommendations pass through the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Defence%20Force">New Zealand Defence Force</a> chain of command to the <a href="Minister%20of%20Defence%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Minister of Defence</a>.

The original Victoria Cross had been awarded to <a href="List%20of%20New%20Zealand%20Victoria%20Cross%20recipients">24 New Zealanders</a>. Thirteen of these awards were for action in the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. The Victoria Cross for New Zealand has been awarded once. It was officially announced on 2 July 2007 that Corporal <a href="Willie%20Apiata">Willie Apiata</a> of the <a href="Special%20Air%20Service%20of%20New%20Zealand">NZ SAS</a> was awarded the Victoria Cross for New Zealand for his actions in saving the life of a "comrade under heavy fire from opposing forces" during the Afghanistan conflict in 2004. Apiata received his medal from <a href="Governor-General%20of%20New%20Zealand">Governor-General</a> <a href="Anand%20Satyanand">Anand Satyanand</a> at a ceremony held at <a href="Government%20House%2C%20Wellington">Government House, Wellington</a> on 26 July 2007.

Brill Tramway

The Brill Tramway, also known as the Quainton Tramway, Wotton Tramway, Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad and Metropolitan Railway Brill Branch, was a six-mile (10 km) rail line in the <a href="Aylesbury%20Vale">Aylesbury Vale</a>, <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>, England. It was privately built in 1871 by the <a href="Richard%20Plantagenet%20Campbell%20Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">3rd Duke of Buckingham</a> as a <a href="Horsecar">horse tram</a> line to help transport goods between his lands around <a href="Wotton%20House">Wotton House</a> and the national rail network. Lobbying from the nearby village of <a href="Brill%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Brill</a> led to its extension to Brill and conversion to passenger use in early 1872. Two locomotives were bought but the line had been built for horses and thus trains travelled at an average speed of .

In 1883, the Duke of Buckingham planned to upgrade the route to main line standards and extend the line to <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, creating the shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford. Despite the backing of the wealthy <a href="Ferdinand%20de%20Rothschild">Ferdinand de Rothschild</a>, investors were deterred by costly tunnelling. In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed in which the line would be built to a lower standard and avoid tunnelling. In anticipation, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad.

Although the existing line had been upgraded in 1894, the extension to Oxford was never built. Instead, operation of the Brill Tramway was taken over by London's <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a> and Brill became one of its two north-western termini. The line was rebuilt in 1910, and more advanced locomotives were introduced, allowing trains to run faster. The population of the area remained low, and the primary income source remained the carriage of goods to and from farms. Between 1899 and 1910 other lines were built in the area, providing more direct services to London and the north of England. The Brill Tramway went into financial decline.

In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway became the <a href="Metropolitan%20line">Metropolitan line</a> of <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Transport</a>. The Brill Tramway became part of the London Underground, despite Quainton Road being from London and not underground. London Transport aimed to concentrate on electrification and improvement of passenger services in London and saw little possibility that routes in Buckinghamshire could become viable passenger routes. In 1935 the Brill Tramway closed. The infrastructure was dismantled and sold. Little trace remains other than the former <a href="junction%20station">junction station</a> at <a href="Quainton%20Road%20railway%20station">Quainton Road</a>, now the <a href="Buckinghamshire%20Railway%20Centre">Buckinghamshire Railway Centre</a>.
<a href="Brill%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Brill</a> is a small village at the top of the high <a href="Brill%20Hill">Brill Hill</a> in the <a href="Aylesbury%20Vale">Aylesbury Vale</a> in northern <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>, northeast of <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, and north-west of <a href="London">London</a>. It was the only population centre in <a href="Bernwood%20Forest">Bernwood Forest</a>, a forest owned by English monarchs as a hunting ground. Traditionally believed to have been the home of <a href="Lud%20son%20of%20Heli">King Lud</a>, <a href="Brill%20Palace">Brill Palace</a> was a seat of the <a href="Mercian%20kings">Mercian kings</a>, the home of <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>, and an occasional residence of the monarchs of England until at least the reign of <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a> (1216–1272). Although a centre for manufacture of pottery and bricks, Brill was a long way from major roads or rivers, and separated by hills from Oxford. It remained small and isolated. In the 1861 census it had a population of 1,300.

<a href="Richard%20Plantagenet%20Campbell%20Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville</a>, the only son of <a href="Richard%20Plantagenet%20Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">Richard Plantagenet Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos</a>, was born on 10 September 1823. By the mid-19th century the family was in financial difficulty. The family's estates and their London home at <a href="Buckingham%20House%2C%20Pall%20Mall">Buckingham House</a> (No. 91 <a href="Pall%20Mall%2C%20London%23Later%20history">Pall Mall</a>) were sold and the family seat of <a href="Stowe%20House">Stowe House</a> seized by bailiffs as security and its contents sold. Over of the family's estates were sold to meet debts.

The only property in the control of the Grenville family was the small ancestral home of <a href="Wotton%20House">Wotton House</a> and its associated lands around <a href="Wotton%20Underwood">Wotton Underwood</a> near Brill. The Grenvilles looked for ways to maximise profits from their remaining farmland around Wotton, and to seek opportunities in heavy industry and engineering. Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville (titled <a href="Marquess%20of%20Chandos">Marquess of Chandos</a> following the death of his grandfather <a href="Richard%20Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos</a> in 1839) was appointed chairman of the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">London and North Western Railway</a> (LNWR) on 27 May 1857. After the death of his father on 29 July 1861 he became 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, and resigned from chairmanship of the LNWR, returning to Wotton House to manage the family's estates. His efforts to pay debts incurred by his father earned praise from Prime Minister <a href="Benjamin%20Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a>, and in 1875 he was appointed <a href="Governor%20of%20Madras">Governor of Madras</a>, serving until 1880.

On 15 June 1839 entrepreneur and former <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="Buckingham%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Buckingham</a>, <a href="Sir%20Harry%20Verney%2C%202nd%20Baronet">Sir Harry Verney, 2nd Baronet</a>, opened the <a href="Cheddington%20to%20Aylesbury%20Line">Aylesbury Railway</a>. Built under the direction of <a href="Robert%20Stephenson">Robert Stephenson</a>, it connected the <a href="London%20and%20Birmingham%20Railway">London and Birmingham Railway</a>'s <a href="Cheddington%20railway%20station">Cheddington railway station</a> on the <a href="West%20Coast%20Main%20Line">West Coast Main Line</a> to <a href="Aylesbury%20High%20Street%20railway%20station">Aylesbury High Street railway station</a> in eastern Aylesbury, the first station in the Aylesbury Vale. On 1 October 1863 the <a href="Wycombe%20Railway">Wycombe Railway</a> opened a branch from <a href="Princes%20Risborough%20railway%20station">Princes Risborough railway station</a> to <a href="Aylesbury%20railway%20station">Aylesbury railway station</a> on the western side of Aylesbury, leaving Aylesbury as the terminus of two small and unconnected branch lines.

Meanwhile, north of Aylesbury the <a href="Buckinghamshire%20Railway">Buckinghamshire Railway</a> was being built by Sir Harry Verney. The scheme consisted of a line running southwest to northeast from Oxford to <a href="Bletchley">Bletchley</a> and a second southeast from <a href="Brackley">Brackley</a> via <a href="Buckingham">Buckingham</a> to join the Oxford–Bletchley line halfway along its length. The first section opened on 1 May 1850, and the whole on 20 May 1851. The Buckinghamshire Railway intended to extend the line south to the station at Aylesbury but the extension was not built.

On 6 August 1860 the <a href="Aylesbury%20and%20Buckingham%20Railway">Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway</a>, with the 3rd Duke (then still Marquess of Chandos) as chairman and Sir Harry Verney as deputy chairman, was incorporated by Act of Parliament to connect the Buckinghamshire Railway (now operated by the LNWR) to Aylesbury. The 2nd Duke ensured the new route ran via <a href="Quainton">Quainton</a>, near his estates around Wotton, instead of a more direct route via <a href="Pitchcott">Pitchcott</a>. Beset by financial difficulties, the line took over eight years to build, eventually opening on 23 September 1868. The new line was connected to the Wycombe Railway's Aylesbury station, and joined the Buckinghamshire Railway where the Oxford–Bletchley line and the line to Buckingham met. A <a href="junction%20station">junction station</a> was built. With no nearby town after which to name the new station, it was named <a href="Verney%20Junction%20railway%20station">Verney Junction railway station</a> after Sir Harry. Aylesbury now had railway lines to the east, north and southwest, but no line southeast towards London and the Channel ports.

With a railway near the border of Wotton House estate, the 3rd Duke decided to build a small-scale agricultural railway to connect the estate to the railway. His intended route ran on his own land other than a small stretch west of the Aylesbury and Buckingham line. This land was owned by the Winwood Charity Trust, an operator of <a href="almshouse">almshouse</a>s in Quainton of which the Duke was a trustee. The Duke agreed to pay an annual rent of £12 (about £ in 2019), in return for permission to run trains. With the consent of the Winwood Charity the route did not require Parliamentary approval, and construction could begin immediately.

The Duke envisaged a <a href="tramway%20%28industrial%29">tramway</a> west from <a href="Quainton%20Road%20railway%20station">Quainton Road railway station</a> across his Wotton estate. The line was intended for transport of construction materials and agricultural produce and not for passengers. It would not have a junction with the Aylesbury and Buckingham railway but would have its own station at Quainton Road at a right angle to the A&B's line. A <a href="turntable%20%28rail%29">turntable</a> at the end of the tramway would link to a spur from the A&B's line. The line was to run roughly southwest from Quainton Road to <a href="Wotton%20%28Metropolitan%20Railway%29%20railway%20station">Wotton</a> near Wotton Underwood. Just west of the station at Wotton the line split. One section would run west to <a href="Wood%20Siding%20railway%20station">Wood Siding</a> near Brill. A short stub called Church Siding would run northwest into Wotton Underwood itself, terminating near the parish church, and a siding would run north to a coal siding near <a href="Kingswood%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Kingswood</a>. The branch to Kingswood was routed to pass a pond, to allow the horses working the line to drink.

<a href="Ralph%20Augustus%20Jones">Ralph Augustus Jones</a> was appointed Manager of the project, and construction began on 8 September 1870. Twenty labourers from the Wotton estate who would otherwise have been unemployed following harvest were employed six days a week to build the line, each paid 11 s per week. They carried out all the construction except laying the track, which was by the specialists, Lawford & Houghton. The line was built using the cheapest materials and winding around hills to avoid expensive earthworks. Ballast was a mix of burnt clay and ash. The stations were crude earth banks high, held in place by wooden planks. As the Duke intended that the line be worked only by <a href="horsecar">horse-drawn carriages</a>, the line was built with <a href="baulk%20road">longitudinal sleepers</a> to reduce the risk of horses tripping. A diameter turntable was installed at Quainton Road to link the tramway to the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway.

On 1 April 1871 the section between Quainton Road and Wotton was formally opened by the Duke of Buckingham in a ceremony in which coal from the first goods wagon to arrive at Wotton was distributed to the poor. At its opening the line was unnamed, although it was referred to as "The Quainton Tramway" in internal correspondence. The extension from Wotton to Wood Siding was complete by 17 June 1871; the opening date of the northern branch to Kingswood is not recorded, but it was not fully open in February 1873. The London and North Western Railway began a dedicated service from Quainton Road, with three vans a week of milk collected from the Wotton estate shipped to the London terminus at <a href="Broad%20Street%20railway%20station%20%28England%29">Broad Street</a>. The only passengers were estate employees and people accompanying livestock.

The Duke and Jones intended to run no more than one train on each section of the line so the line was not built with <a href="passing%20loop">passing loop</a>s or signalling. When more than one horse-drawn train or locomotive was in operation, the Tramway operated a <a href="Token%20%28railway%20signalling%29">token</a> system using colour-coded staffs to ensure only one train could be on a section. Drivers between Quainton Road and Wotton carried a blue staff, those on west of Wotton and the Kingswood siding a red staff.

On 26 August 1871 an excursion ran from Wood Siding to London hauled by the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> (GWR). It carried around 150 people, for a total of 105 passenger fares (with each child counted as half an adult), and was drawn by horses between Wood Siding and Quainton Road and by locomotive from Quainton Road to Aylesbury where the carriages were attached to the 7.30 am GWR service via Princes Risborough to London, arriving at 10.00 am. The experiment was not a success. Sharp overhanging branches posed a danger to passengers and had to be cut back in the week before the excursion. The day was wet and ticket sales were lower than expected. The return from London to Quainton Road was delayed in <a href="Slough">Slough</a>, and the excursion arrived back at Wood Siding at 2.00 am.
The surveyors designing the line had worked on the assumption that the wagons would have a load on each wheel of and had designed the line accordingly. As it turned out, the four-wheeled wagons used had an average weight of and each carried of goods, meaning this limit was regularly exceeded. The coal wagons used on the line weighed each and carried of coal, meaning a load on each wheel of .

As well as damaging the track the loads strained the horses, and soon the line began to suffer with <a href="derailment">derailment</a>s, particularly in wet weather. On 20 October 1871 Jones wrote to the Duke that "The traffic is now becoming so heavy that I would, most respectfully, venture to ask your Grace to consider the subject as to whether an Engine would not be the least expensive and most efficient power to work it."

In late 1871 residents of Brill petitioned the Duke to extend the route to Brill and open a passenger service. The Duke agreed; it is likely he had already planned passenger services to Brill, as correspondence from early 1871 mentions passenger facilities at "the Brill terminus". In January 1872 a scheduled passenger timetable was published and the line was named the "Wotton Tramway". (Although officially named the "Wotton Tramway", it was commonly known as the "Brill Tramway" from the time of its conversion to passenger use.) The new terminus of <a href="Brill%20railway%20station">Brill railway station</a>, at the foot of Brill Hill approximately north of the town, opened in March 1872. Although it was now a passenger railway, goods traffic continued to be the primary purpose of the line. The line was heavily used to ship bricks from the brickworks around Brill, and cattle and milk from farms on the Wotton estate. By 1875 the line was carrying around of milk each year. The inbound delivery of <a href="linseed%20cake">linseed cake</a> to the dairy farms and of coal to the area's buildings were also important. The line began to carry manure from London to the area's farms, carrying in 1872. The tramway also opened a <a href="cartage">cartage</a> business to handle the onward shipment of goods and parcels unloaded at Brill and Wotton stations.
With horses unable to cope, Jones and the Duke decided to convert at least part of the railway for <a href="locomotive">locomotive</a>s. The lightly laid track with longitudinal sleepers limited them to , and it was thus necessary to use the lightest locomotives possible. Two <a href="traction%20engine">traction engine</a>s converted for railway use were bought from <a href="Aveling%20and%20Porter">Aveling and Porter</a> for £398 (about £ in 2019) each. They were chosen for weight and reliability, and had a top speed on the level of . They took 95–98 minutes between Brill and Quainton Road, an average of . With an unusual configuration in which a flywheel drove chains which in turn drove the wheels, the locomotives were noisy and were nicknamed "Old Chainey" by locals.

The first of the new locomotives, given serial number 807 by Aveling and Porter and numbered 1 by the Tramway, was delivered to Wotton station on 27 January 1872. On the day of its delivery, the now-redundant horses had been sent away. Nobody at Wotton could operate the locomotive so a horse had to be hired from Aylesbury until the driver arrived. After the delivery of the second locomotive on 7 September 1872, all passenger services were drawn by locomotive except on Thursdays, when locomotives were replaced by horses to allow for maintenance. The line carried 104 passengers in January 1872, rising to 224 in April, and 456 in August 1872.

With steam came the need for water. Plans to dig a well near Wotton came to nothing, and the Duke's expedient of drawing water from a pond near Quainton Road did not impress the pond's owner. By March 1872 Jones recorded that "The party to whom the pond near the Quainton Station belongs is making complaints about our having water and I expect he will be using force to prevent our getting any". A wooden water tower was built at Brill station, and a large water tower known as the Black Tank was built in the fork of the main line and Church Siding.

While the engines proved adequate, they were slow. On 6 February 1872, Jones timed one as taking 41 minutes to travel roughly from Quainton Road to Wotton hauling 42 tons (43 t). They were also low-powered, and when pulling a heavy load their front wheels would lift off the track. The Duke's cost-cutting led to poor maintenance of track and equipment, and the service was often interrupted by derailments and accidents.
In 1876 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway raised its prices for coal haulage. All coal hauled on the Tramway needed to pass along the A&BR from Verney Junction or Aylesbury and Jones had to raise prices to cover the surcharge or keep prices stable despite the loss of profits. Road-hauled coal from <a href="Bicester">Bicester</a> was already undercutting the Tramway and the unreliable engines had given the Tramway a poor reputation. Jones kept prices fixed and absorb the increased costs, wrecking the Tramway's already declining business.

In 1873 the 3rd Duke attempted to have the Wotton Tramway recognised as a railway, and <a href="William%20Yolland">William Yolland</a> inspected the line in April 1873. The <a href="Railway%20Regulation%20Act%201844">Railway Regulation Act 1844</a> defined minimum standards of travel, one of which was that the trains travel at an average of , which the Aveling and Porter locomotives could not manage. None of the stopping places had adequate station buildings, and the line had no signals. Yolland permitted the line to continue as a tramway, but refused to recognise it as a railway.

By the mid-1870s the slow locomotives and their unreliability and inability to handle heavy loads were major problems. In 1874 <a href="Ferdinand%20de%20Rothschild">Ferdinand de Rothschild</a> bought a site near <a href="Waddesdon%20Road%20railway%20station">Waddesdon station</a> from <a href="John%20Spencer-Churchill%2C%207th%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough</a>, for his planned <a href="Waddesdon%20Manor">Waddesdon Manor</a>. Jones and the Duke recognised that construction would increase the haulage of heavy goods and that the engines would not cope.

Engineer <a href="William%20Gordon%20Bagnall">William Gordon Bagnall</a> had established the locomotive firm of <a href="W.%20G.%20Bagnall">W. G. Bagnall</a> in 1875. Bagnall wrote to the Duke offering to hire his first locomotive for trials. On 18 December 1876 the locomotive, "Buckingham", was delivered. It entered service on 1 January 1877, mainly on the steep section of the line between Wotton and Brill. Although Jones was unhappy with some aspects of "Buckingham", he recognised the improvement and ordered a locomotive from Bagnall for £640 (about £ in 2019). "Wotton" was delivered on 28 December 1877 and "Buckingham" was returned to Bagnall in February 1878.

"Buckingham" and "Wotton" were more reliable than the Aveling and Porter engines. With modern locomotives on the Brill–Quainton Road route (the Kingswood branch generally remained worked by horses, and occasionally by the Aveling and Porter engines), traffic rose. The figure for milk traffic rose from 40,000 gallons carried in 1875 to 58,000 gallons (260,000 l; 70,000 US gal) in 1879, and in 1877 the Tramway carried 20,994 <a href="long%20ton">tons</a> (21,331 t) of goods. In early 1877 it appeared on "<a href="George%20Bradshaw%23Bradshaw%27s%20railway%20timetables">Bradshaw</a>" maps and from May 1882 "Bradshaw" listed the timetable.
Despite frequent derailments, low speed meant Wotton Tramway had a good safety record. The locomotives occasionally ran over stray sheep, and on 12 September 1888 sparks from one of the Aveling and Porter engines blew back into one of the train's <a href="cattle%20truck">cattle truck</a>s, igniting the straw bedding and badly burning two cows. The line had one serious accident, in which Ellen Maria Nickalls, a servant at Wotton House, was struck by a locomotive near Church Siding and killed. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death, absolving driver James Challis.

Jones increased scheduled passenger journeys from two to three each day in each direction. With locomotives generally occupied with goods, many passenger services were drawn by horse. While the increased passenger journeys boosted revenues, the Tramway no longer owned enough horses and had to hire them. By 1881 the passenger service was losing £11(about £ in 2019) a month, although reduced use of locomotives lowered maintenance costs. Although reliability had improved, services were still slow. Horse-drawn passenger services took 60–70 minutes to travel between Quainton Road and Brill. The locomotive-hauled <a href="mixed%20train">mixed train</a>s, with frequent stops to load and unload, were timetabled at 1 to 2 hours to make the same journey, slower than walking.

Jones hoped to increase passenger revenue by promoting Brill as a spa. The <a href="chalybeate%20spring">chalybeate spring</a>s of <a href="Dorton%20Spa">Dorton Spa</a> outside Brill were known for supposed healing powers, and a resort had been built around the Spa in the 1830s, featuring a modern pump house and eight baths, set in of parkland. Despite the redevelopment and the building of modern hotels in Brill, Dorton Spa was unfashionable and by the late 19th century was little used. Jones and the Spa's owners hoped Queen Victoria would visit during her 1890 stay at Waddesdon Manor and thus boost Brill as a spa town. Although such a visit was arranged, Victoria changed her mind and visited the spa at <a href="Cheltenham">Cheltenham</a> instead. The spa traffic never materialised.

In 1876 Ferdinand de Rothschild began work on Waddesdon Manor, a short distance south of the Tramway's station at Waddesdon (later renamed Waddesdon Road). The top of Lodge Hill, a landmark, was levelled to provide a site and sloping drives were cut into the hill to provide access to the construction site. Transport of materials was by horse, but the contractors had to get enormous stone blocks up the hill. Rothschild's contractors built a line, known as the Winchendon Branch, which turned off the Tramway between Waddesdon and <a href="Westcott%20railway%20station">Westcott</a> stations and ran south to the foot of Lodge Hill. From there a <a href="cable%20tram">cable tram</a> ran on <a href="narrow%20gauge">narrow gauge</a> rails up the hill to a <a href="gully">gully</a> close to the building site. Materials were hauled along the cable tramway in tubs by a steam-powered winch. The Winchendon Branch was hastily and cheaply built; after one of the Tramway's locomotives derailed there on 5 July 1876 Jones refused to allow his engines on it, and from then on materials were hauled along the branch by horses.

The building of Waddesdon Manor generated huge business for the Tramway. Large numbers of bricks from Poore's Brickworks at Brill were shipped. By July 1877 the entire output of the brickworks was going to supply the Waddesdon Manor works, with 25,000 bricks a week being used. Additional bricks were also shipped via Quainton Road, along with 7,000 tons (7,100 t) of <a href="Bath%20Stone">Bath Stone</a> from <a href="Corsham">Corsham</a>. The manor also required power and in 1883 a <a href="gasworks">gasworks</a> was built to the west. A siding from Westcott station ran south to the gasworks, to carry coal. Waddesdon Manor chose not to use the Tramway for supplying coal to the gasworks and the siding was abandoned in 1886.

Waddesdon Manor was complete in 1889, 13 years after construction began. The Winchendon Branch closed and the track was removed. The gasworks remained operational, although supplied by road, until its closure during the coal shortage of 1916. It was demolished shortly afterwards. The track of the disused siding remained until at least 1916.

Although Poore's Brickworks was well established, Jones believed there was potential profit in the Duke of Buckingham's capitalising on his access to a railway line by becoming directly involved in brickmaking. Trials with Brill clay in 1883 proved positive, and in April 1885 Jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10 million bricks a year. It was decided that 5 million bricks per year was a realistic figure, with bricks to be manufactured in kilns between Brill and Wood Siding stations and shipped down the Tramway to the national network. Progress was slow and obstructed by the local authority.

Few records survive of the Brill Brick and Tile Works, as it came to be called, but it was operational by 1895. Jones (1974) says the siding to the brickworks opened with the extension to Brill, implying that Brill Brick and Tile Works existed in early 1872. This is almost certainly incorrect; no mention of the sidings is made in the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the Brill Brick and Tile Works exists in any source earlier than 1895. The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had to be shipped by road from Poore's to Brill or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, implying there was no works capable of making high numbers of bricks along the Tramway.

Brill Brick and Tile Works could not compete with the larger and better-connected brickworks at <a href="Calvert%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Calvert</a> and declined. The brickworks finally closed in the early 20th century. The building was taken over by the W. E. Fenemore workshop, making <a href="Loader%20%28equipment%29">hay loaders</a>, before being converted into a <a href="Lumber%20yard">timber yard</a> in the 1920s.

Although the introduction of the Bagnall locomotives and the traffic generated by the works at Waddesdon Manor had boosted the route's fortunes, it remained in serious financial difficulty. The only connection with the national railway network was by way of the turntable at Quainton Road. The 3rd Duke of Buckingham chaired the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway but its management regarded the Tramway as a nuisance. In the 1870s it charged disproportionately high fees for through traffic between the Tramway and the main line with the intention of forcing the Tramway out of business. Relations deteriorated between Jones and J. G. Rowe, Secretary and Traffic Manager of the A&B. The A&B's trains at Quainton Road would miss connections with the Tramway, causing milk shipped to Quainton to become unsellable, to the extent that Jones began unloading milk at Waddesdon and shipping it to Aylesbury by road. Although Jones asked the Duke to intervene relations remained poor; in 1888 Rowe blocked the telegraph along the Tramway, and in one meeting Jones and Rowe threatened violence.

Jones sought legal advice and was told that the Duke would probably win a legal action against the A&BR. The A&BR was in such a precarious financial position that any successful legal action against them would likely have forced the line through Quainton Road to close, severing the Tramway's connection with the national network altogether. Meanwhile, local dairy farmers began to switch to beef and butter, causing a drop in milk transport. From its peak of 20,994 tons carried in 1877, goods traffic fell in each of the next four years, dropping to 9,139 tons (9,286 t) in 1881.
Many of the passengers using the Tramway continued their journey by way of the A&BR line; in 1885, 5,192 passengers changed trains between the A&BR and the Tramway at Quainton Road. Jones suggested that the A&BR subsidise the Tramway's service to the sum of £25 (about £ in 2019) per month to allow passenger services to continue, but the A&BR agreed to pay only £5 (about £ in 2019) per month. By the mid-1880s the Tramway was finding it difficult to cover the operating expenses of either goods or passenger operations.

<a href="Euston%20railway%20station">Euston railway station</a> opened in 1837, the first railway station connecting London with the industrial heartlands of the West Midlands and Lancashire. Railways were banned by a Parliamentary commission from operating in London itself and the station was built on the northern boundary. Other termini north of London followed at <a href="London%20Paddington%20station">Paddington</a> (1838), <a href="Bishopsgate%20railway%20station">Bishopsgate</a> (1840), <a href="Fenchurch%20Street%20railway%20station">Fenchurch Street</a> (1841), <a href="London%20King%27s%20Cross%20railway%20station">King's Cross</a> (1852) and <a href="St%20Pancras%20railway%20station">St Pancras</a> (1868). All were outside the built-up area, making them inconvenient.

<a href="Charles%20Pearson">Charles Pearson</a> (1793–1862) had proposed an underground railway connecting the City of London with the main line rail termini in around 1840. In 1854 he commissioned the first traffic survey, determining that each day 200,000 walked into the City, 44,000 travelled by omnibus, and 26,000 in private carriages. A Parliamentary Commission backed Pearson's proposal over other schemes. Despite concerns about vibration causing subsidence of buildings, the problems of compensating the many thousands whose homes were destroyed during digging of the tunnel, and fears that the tunnelling might break into Hell, construction began in 1860. On 9 January 1863 the line opened as the <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a> (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway.

The MR grew steadily, extending its own services and acquiring other local railways north and west of London. In 1872 <a href="Edward%20Watkin">Edward Watkin</a> (1819–1901) was appointed Chairman. A director of many railway companies, he wanted to unify a string of companies to create a single line from Manchester via London to an intended <a href="Channel%20Tunnel">Channel Tunnel</a> and on to France. In 1873 Watkin negotiated to take control of the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the section of the former Buckinghamshire Railway north from Verney Junction to Buckingham. He planned to extend the MR north from London to Aylesbury and extend the Tramway southwest to Oxford, creating a route from London to Oxford. Rail services between Oxford and London were poor, and although still roundabout, the scheme would have formed the shortest route from London to Oxford, Aylesbury, Buckingham and Stratford-upon-Avon. The Duke of Buckingham was enthusiastic and authorisation was sought from Parliament. Parliament did not share the enthusiasm and in 1875 the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire Union Railway Bill was rejected. Watkin did receive consent in 1881 to extend the MR to Aylesbury.

With extension to Aylesbury approved, the Duke of Buckingham in March 1883 announced his own scheme to extend the Brill Tramway to Oxford. The turntable at Quainton Road would be replaced with a junction to the south of the existing turntable to allow through running of trains. The stretch from Quainton Road to Brill would be straightened and improved to main line standards, and Waddesdon Road and Wood Siding stations would close. From Brill, the line would pass in a tunnel through Muswell Hill to the south of Brill, and on via <a href="Boarstall">Boarstall</a> before crossing from Buckinghamshire into Oxfordshire at <a href="Stanton%20St.%20John">Stanton St. John</a>. From Stanton St. John the line would stop on the outskirts of Oxford at <a href="Headington">Headington</a>, terminating at a station to be built in the back garden of 12 High Street, <a href="St%20Clement%27s%2C%20Oxford">St Clement's</a>, near <a href="Magdalen%20Bridge">Magdalen Bridge</a>. The proposal included a separate set of rails to be provided where the old and new routes ran together, to allow the existing Wotton Tramway to continue to operate independently if it saw fit, but given the Duke's involvement in the new scheme it is unlikely he intended to use this option.

At the line would have been by far the shortest route between Oxford and Aylesbury, compared with via the GWR (which had absorbed the Wycombe Railway), and via the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the LNWR. The Act authorising the scheme received <a href="Royal%20Assent">Royal Assent</a> on 20 August 1883, and the new Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company was created, including the Duke of Buckingham, Ferdinand de Rothschild and Harry Verney among its directors. The scheme caught the attention of the expansionist Metropolitan Railway, who paid for the survey. Despite powerful backers, the expensive Muswell Hill tunnel deterred investors. Ferdinand de Rothschild promised to lend money in return for guarantees that the rebuilt line would include a passenger station at Westcott, and that the Duke would press the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway to open a station at the nearest point to Waddesdon Manor. <a href="Waddesdon%20railway%20station">Waddesdon Manor railway station</a> opened on 1 January 1897.

Despite cash from Rothschild, the company could not raise sufficient investment to begin construction of the Oxford extension, and had only been given a five-year window by Parliament in which to build it. On 7 August 1888, less than two weeks before the authorisation was to expire, the directors of the Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company received Royal Assent for a revised and cheaper version. To be called the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad (O&AT), the new scheme envisaged the extension's being built to the same light specifications as the existing tramway. To avoid expensive earthworks and tunnelling, the line would parallel a road out of Brill, despite the considerable gradients involved. The entire route would be single track, other than passing places, and the Oxford terminus was to be in <a href="George%20Street%2C%20Oxford">George Street</a>, nearer the edge of the city. Jones was sceptical and felt that it unlikely to recoup its construction costs.

On 26 March 1889 the 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos died, aged 65. A special train brought his body from London to Quainton Road, and from Quainton he was taken to Stowe for the service, and on to the family vault at Wotton. Five carriages provided by the London and North Western Railway carried mourners to Church Siding, near Wotton Underwood's church. Another carried a company of the <a href="Royal%20Buckinghamshire%20Yeomanry">Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry</a>, associated with the Grenville family and the upkeep of which had helped bankrupt the second duke. (This second train was delayed on the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway, arriving late to the burial.)

The Dukedom was inherited only in the male line. As the 3rd Duke had three daughters but no son, the title became <a href="Extinction%20%28peerage%29">extinct</a>. The 1st Duke was also <a href="Earl%20Temple%20of%20Stowe">Earl Temple of Stowe</a>, a title which descended through heirs of his relatives should the male line become extinct. Consequently, on the 3rd Duke's death this title, with most of the Wotton estate, passed to his nephew <a href="William%20Temple-Gore-Langton%2C%204th%20Earl%20Temple%20of%20Stowe">William Temple-Gore-Langton</a> who became the 4th Earl Temple.

By this time construction of the MR extension from London to Aylesbury was underway, and on 1 July 1891 the MR absorbed the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway. Sir Harry Verney died on 12 February 1894, and on 31 March 1894 the MR took over services on the A&BR from the GWR. On 1 July 1894 the MR extension to Aylesbury was completed, giving the MR a unified route from London to Verney Junction. The MR embarked on upgrading and rebuilding stations along the line.

Construction of the route from Brill to Oxford had not begun. Further Acts of Parliament were granted in 1892 and 1894 varying the route slightly and allowing electrification, but no building was carried out other than surveying. On 1 April 1894, the proposed extension to Oxford still intended, the O&AT exercised a clause of the 1888 Act and took over the Wotton Tramway. Jones was retained as general Manager and work began on upgrading the line for the extension.

The track from Quainton Road to Brill was relaid with improved rails on standard <a href="Sleeper%20%28rail%29">transverse sleepers</a>. The former longitudinal sleepers were used as fence posts and guard rails. The stations, little more than earth banks, were replaced with wooden platforms. Waddesdon, Westcott, Wotton and Brill were fitted with buildings housing a booking office, waiting rooms and toilets, while Wood Siding station had a small waiting room "with shelf and drawer". Church Siding was not included and was removed from the timetable.

The Kingswood branch was not included in the rebuilding, and retained its original 1871 track. Two <a href="Manning%20Wardle">Manning Wardle</a> locomotives, "Huddersfield" and "Earl Temple", came into use on the line at around this time. "Huddersfield" had been built in 1876 and originally named "Prestwich"; "Earl Temple" was identical to "Huddersfield" other than having a covered cab. The Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad could not afford the price when "Earl Temple" was delivered and the Earl bought it with his own money and rented it to the O&AT. In 1895 two new passenger carriages, each accommodating 40 passengers, were bought from the Bristol Wagon and Carriage Company. In 1896 "Huddersfield" was withdrawn, and in 1899 replaced with a new Manning Wardle locomotive named "Wotton No. 2", at which time "Earl Temple" was renamed "Brill No. 1".
The rebuilding reduced journeys between Quainton Road and Brill to between 35 and 43 minutes. From 1895 the Tramway ran four passenger services in each direction on weekdays. The population of the area remained low, and in 1901 Brill had a population of only 1206. Passenger traffic remained insignificant and in 1898 passenger receipts were only £24 per month (about £ in 2019).

Meanwhile, the MR were rebuilding and resiting Quainton Road station, freeing space for a direct link between the former Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the O&AT to be built. A curve between the lines opened on 1 January 1897, allowing through running between the two lines.

With through running between the lines in place, in June 1899 the MR inspected the O&AT's carriages and locomotives, and had serious concerns. The original passenger carriage began as a horse tram and was shabby internally, and unsafe as part of a longer train. The passenger carriage from the 1870s was in a poor condition. The 1895 Bristol passenger carriages were unfit owing to their light construction. Eight of the O&AT's nine goods wagons did not comply with <a href="Railway%20Clearing%20House">Railway Clearing House</a> standards and could not be used on other lines. On 4 October 1899 the MR loaned the O&AT an eight-wheeled 70 seat passenger carriage. As this had been built for the MR's standard height platforms rather than the O&AT's low platforms, 80–100 ft (24–30 m) of each platform on the Tramway was raised to standard height to accommodate the MR carriage.

The Metropolitan and the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company were cooperating closely by 1899. Although the line had been upgraded in preparation for the Oxford extension and had been authorised as a railway in 1894, construction on the extension had yet to begin. On 27 November John Bell, Watkin's successor as Chairman of the MR, leased the line from the O&AT for £600 (about £ in 2019) a year with an option to buy the line. From 1 December 1899, the MR took over all operations. Jones stayed as Manager. The O&AT's decrepit passenger coach, a relic of Wotton Tramway days, was removed from its wheels and used as a <a href="platelayer">platelayer</a>'s hut at Brill station. An elderly <a href="Brown%2C%20Marshalls%20and%20Co.%20Ltd.">Brown, Marshalls and Co</a> passenger coach replaced it, and a section of each platform was raised to accommodate the higher doors of this coach using earth and old railway sleepers.

On 28 March 1902 the 4th Earl Temple died aged 55, succeeded by Algernon William Stephen Temple-Gore-Langton, 5th Earl Temple of Stowe. The Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company, which by now did nothing except collect £600 annual rent from the MR, pay the Winwood Charity Trust rent for their land near Quainton Road crossed by the rails, and pay Earl Temple an annual dividend of £400, remained independent under the control of the 4th Earl's trustees.

The MR sold all but one of the dilapidated goods wagons to the <a href="Llanelly%20and%20Mynydd%20Mawr%20Railway">Llanelly and Mynydd Mawr Railway</a>, replacing them with five eight-wheeled carriages built in 1865–66. The MR considered the Manning Wardle locomotives unreliable and from early 1903 they were replaced by a pair of <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway%20D%20Class">Metropolitan Railway D Class</a> engines, although they were not sold until 1911. The heavy D Class locomotives damaged the track, and in 1910 the track between Quainton Road and Brill was relaid to MR standards, using track removed from the inner London MR route but considered adequate for a rural branch line. Following this upgrading, the speed limit was increased to .

The Kingswood branch was again not upgraded, and still retained its 1871 track. It was abandoned at the end of 1915, and the track removed in 1920. In 1911 Brill Brick and Tile Works closed, and the siding to the brickworks was removed, with the exception of the rails on the level crossing which in 1984 were still in place, albeit tarmacked over. On the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in 1914, Brill became a centre for training cadets, who were housed in Wotton House and ferried in trains of five passenger coaches.
The Metropolitan Railway was unhappy with the performance and safety of the D Class locomotives and sold them between 1916 and 1922. With much of their route close to London now electrified the MR had surplus steam locomotives, and two <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway%20A%20Class">Metropolitan Railway A Class</a> locomotives, numbers 23 (built 1866) and 41 (built 1869), were transferred to the route. Built by <a href="Beyer%2C%20Peacock%20and%20Company">Beyer, Peacock and Company</a> from 1864, the A Class had been the first locomotives owned by the Metropolitan (in 1863, the first year of operation, the MR had used engines loaned from the GWR). Although the most advanced locomotives regularly to work the route, the A Class predated all other rolling stock on the Tramway. The two locomotives operated for a week at a time. Occasionally, the MR substituted other similar locomotives.

Four services per day operated, taking around 40 minutes from one end to the other in 1900, falling to 32 minutes by 1931 after the upgrading of the route and the introduction of the A Class locomotives.

On 1 February 1903 Jones retired and control was taken over directly by the Metropolitan Railway. Jones died on 14 April 1909, surviving to see the railway network in the Aylesbury Vale reach its greatest extent.

In 1893 another of Edward Watkin's railways, the <a href="Manchester%2C%20Sheffield%20and%20Lincolnshire%20Railway">Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway</a>, had been authorised to build a new line, from its existing station at <a href="Annesley%20railway%20station">Annesley</a> in <a href="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a>, south to Quainton Road. Watkin had intended to run services from Manchester and Sheffield via Quainton Road and along the Metropolitan Railway to the MR's station at <a href="Baker%20Street%20tube%20station">Baker Street</a>. Following Watkin's retirement in 1894, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway obtained permission for a separate station near Baker Street at <a href="Marylebone%20station">Marylebone</a>, and the line was renamed the <a href="Great%20Central%20Railway">Great Central Railway</a> (GCR). The new line joined the existing MR just north of Quainton Road on the Verney Junction branch, and opened to passengers on 15 March 1899. Many of the bricks used in the building of the Great Central Railway were supplied by the Brill Brick and Tile Works and shipped along the Tramway, providing a significant revenue boost to the O&AT.

Following Watkin's retirement relations between the Great Central Railway and the Metropolitan Railway deteriorated badly. The GCR route to London ran over MR lines from Quainton Road to London, and to reduce reliance on the shaky goodwill of the MR, GCR General Manager <a href="William%20Pollitt">William Pollitt</a> decided to create a link with the Great Western Railway to create a second route into London. In 1899 the <a href="Great%20Western%20and%20Great%20Central%20Joint%20Railway">Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway</a> began construction of a new line, commonly known as the Alternative Route, to link the GWR's existing station at Princes Risborough to the new Great Central line. The line ran from Princes Risborough north to meet the Great Central at <a href="Grendon%20Underwood">Grendon Underwood</a>, about north of Quainton Road. The new line was to cross the Tramway on a bridge immediately east of Wotton station, although no intersection was built between the lines. Although the lines did not connect, a temporary siding was built from the Tramway onto the embankment of the new line, and used for the transport of construction materials and the removal of spoil from the works during the building of the new line. Although formally an independent company, in practice the line was operated as a part of the Great Central Railway.

The new line was planned as a through route and was not intended to have any stations of its own, but in 1904 it was decided to build two stations on it. A new station, also named <a href="Wotton%20%28GCR%29%20railway%20station">Wotton</a>, was built immediately to the south of the existing Wotton station. On 2 April 1906 the new route opened to passengers. The two Wotton stations were very close together, and the same <a href="stationmaster">stationmaster</a> was responsible for both.

In 1910 the new <a href="Bicester%20cut-off">Bicester cut-off</a> line of the GWR <a href="Chiltern%20Main%20Line">Chiltern Main Line</a> opened, allowing trains from London to Birmingham to bypass a long curve through Oxford. The new line was routed directly through Wood Siding, although no interchange station was built. The GWR ran in a cutting beneath the existing station; Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908–1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the GWR's line. The new line included the station named <a href="Brill%20and%20Ludgershall%20railway%20station">Brill and Ludgershall</a>, which in reality was considerably further from Brill than the existing Brill station.

With the opening of the new routes, the Tramway for the first time suffered serious competition. Although further from Brill than the Tramway's station, the GWR's station provided a fast and direct route to the GWR's London terminus at Paddington. The Great Central Railway's station at Wotton, and the other Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway station at <a href="Akeman%20Street%20railway%20station">Akeman Street</a>, provided fast and direct routes to both Paddington and to the Great Central's new London terminus at Marylebone, without the need to change trains at Quainton Road. In addition, following the end of the First World War motorised road transport grew rapidly, drawing passenger and goods traffic away from the railways. The Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company repeatedly tried to persuade the Metropolitan Railway to buy the line outright, but the MR declined. In July 1923 the O&AT tried to sell the line to the GWR and to the <a href="Electric%20and%20Railway%20Finance%20Corporation">Electric and Railway Finance Corporation</a>, but was rebuffed by both.

On 1 July 1933, the Metropolitan Railway, along with London's other underground railways, aside from the short <a href="Waterloo%20%26amp%3B%20City%20Railway">Waterloo & City Railway</a>, was taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a> (LPTB). Thus, despite Brill and Verney Junction being and over two hours travel from the City of London, the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad and the former Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway became parts of the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> network. The locomotives and carriages were repainted with London Transport's <a href="Johnston%20Sans">Johnston Sans</a> emblem.

By this time, the route from Quainton Road to Brill was in severe decline. Competition from the newer lines and from improving road haulage had drawn away much of the tramway's custom, and the trains would often run without a single passenger. The A Class locomotives were now 70 years old, and the track itself was poorly maintained. Trains, once again, were regularly derailing on the line.

<a href="Frank%20Pick">Frank Pick</a>, Managing Director of the <a href="Underground%20Electric%20Railways%20Company%20of%20London">Underground Group</a> from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, aimed to move the network away from freight services, and to concentrate on the electrification and improvement of the core routes in London. He saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes, concluding that at least £2,000 (about £ in 2019) per year would be saved by closing the Brill branch.

On 1 June 1935, the London Passenger Transport Board gave the required six months notice to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company that it intended to terminate operations on the tramway.

To fulfil their obligations, London Transport formally inspected the line on 23 July 1935. The inspection was carried out with great speed, the special train taking just 15 minutes to travel the length of the line from Brill to Quainton Road. The inspection confirmed that the closure process was to proceed.

The last scheduled passenger service left Quainton Road in the afternoon of 30 November 1935. Hundreds of people gathered, and a number of members of the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Railway%20Society">Oxford University Railway Society</a> travelled from Oxford in an effort to buy the last ticket. Accompanied by firecrackers and <a href="Detonator%20%28railway%29">fog signals</a>, the train ran the length of the line to Brill, where the passengers posed for a photograph.

Late that evening, a two-coach staff train pulled out of Brill, accompanied by a band playing <a href="Auld%20Lang%20Syne">Auld Lang Syne</a> and a white flag. The train stopped at each station along the route, picking up the staff, documents and valuables from each. At 11.45 pm the train arrived at Quainton Road, greeted by hundreds of locals and railway enthusiasts. At the stroke of midnight, the rails connecting the tramway to the Metropolitan Railway main line were ceremonially severed.

Following the withdrawal of London Transport services the Metropolitan Railway's lease was voided and at midnight on 1 December 1935 the railway and stations reverted to the control of the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company. The O&AT Board by now had only three members: the 5th Earl Temple, the Earl's agent Robert White, and the former Brill hay-loader manufacturer W. E. Fenemore.
Although at the time of the closure there was some speculation that the O&AT would continue to operate the tramway as a <a href="mineral%20railway">mineral railway</a>, with no funds and no rolling stock of its own, the O&AT was unable to operate the line. On 2 April 1936, the entire infrastructure of the stations was sold piecemeal at auction. Excluding the houses at Westcott and Brill, which were sold separately, the auction raised £72 7s (about £ in 2019) in total. The Ward Scrap Metal Company paid £7,000 (about £ in 2019) for the rails, with the exception of those at Quainton Road which were retained as a siding.

With the stations at Wood Siding and Brill closed, and the GWR's <a href="Brill%20and%20Ludgershall%20railway%20station">Brill and Ludgershall railway station</a> inconveniently sited, the GWR opened a new station on the Chiltern Main Line near to Brill at <a href="Dorton%20Halt%20railway%20station">Dorton Halt</a> on 21 June 1937.

On 5 January 1937, the board of the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad met for the last time. On 5 February 1937 a <a href="winding%20up">winding up</a> petition was presented to the High Court, and on 24 March 1937 Mr W. E. Fisher was appointed <a href="Liquidator%20%28law%29">liquidator</a>. On 11 November 1940 Fisher was formally discharged, and the O&AT officially ceased to exist.

After closure, the line was largely forgotten. Because it had been built on private land without an Act of Parliament, few records of it prior to the Oxford extension schemes exist in official archives. At least some of the rails remained in place in 1940, as records exist of their removal during the building of <a href="RAF%20Westcott">RAF Westcott</a>. Other than the station buildings at Westcott and Quainton Road almost nothing survives of the tramway, although much of the route can still be traced by a double line of hedges. The former trackbed between Quainton Road and Waddesdon Road is now a public footpath known as the Tramway Walk.

After the death of the 3rd Duke of Buckingham the family archives, including the records of the Brill Tramway, were sold to the <a href="The%20Huntington%20Library">Huntington Library</a> in California. In 1968 the London Underground Railway Society launched a fundraising appeal to <a href="microfilm">microfilm</a> the relevant material, and in January 1971 the microfilms were opened to researchers at the University of London Library (now <a href="Senate%20House%20Library">Senate House Library</a>).

In the 1973 documentary "<a href="Metro-land%20%28TV%29">Metro-land</a>", <a href="John%20Betjeman">John Betjeman</a> spoke of a 1929 visit to Quainton Road, and of watching a train depart for Brill: "The steam ready to take two or three passengers through oil-lit halts and over level crossings, a rather bumpy journey".
Wotton station on the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway, which in 1923 had been taken over by the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a>, remained open (albeit little used and served by only two trains per day in each direction) until 7 December 1953, when the station was abandoned. The bridge that had formerly carried the GW&GCJR over the tramway at Wotton was demolished in 1970, and the former GW&GCJR station was converted to a private house.

Both Dorton Halt and Brill and Ludgersall stations were closed on 7 January 1963 and trains no longer stop, although the line through them remains in use by trains between <a href="Princes%20Risborough%20railway%20station">Princes Risborough</a> and <a href="Bicester%20North%20railway%20station">Bicester North</a>. Quainton Road station was bought in 1969 by members of the London Railway Preservation Society to use as a permanent base, and now houses the <a href="Buckinghamshire%20Railway%20Centre">Buckinghamshire Railway Centre</a>. The station is still connected to the railway network and used by freight trains and occasional special passenger services, but no longer has a scheduled passenger service. There are no longer any open railway stations in the areas formerly served by the tramway. Plans have been proposed by the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre to rebuild and reopen a stretch of the tramway as a <a href="heritage%20railway">heritage railway</a>.
