Coinage Act of 1873

The Coinage Act of 1873 or Mint Act of 1873, <a href="Statutes%20at%20Large">17 Stat. 424</a>, was a general revision of the laws relating to the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Mint of the United States</a>. In abolishing the right of holders of silver bullion to have their metal struck into fully legal tender <a href="Seated%20Liberty%20dollar">dollar coins</a>, it ended <a href="bimetallism">bimetallism</a> in the United States, placing the nation firmly on the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>. Because of this, the act became contentious in later years, and was denounced by some as the "Crime of '73".

By 1869, the Mint Act of 1837 was deemed outdated, and Treasury Secretary <a href="George%20Boutwell">George Boutwell</a> had Deputy <a href="Comptroller%20of%20the%20Currency">Comptroller of the Currency</a> <a href="John%20Jay%20Knox">John Jay Knox</a> undertake a draft of a revised law, which was introduced into Congress by Ohio Senator <a href="John%20Sherman">John Sherman</a>. Due to the high price of silver, little of that metal was presented at the Mint, but Knox and others foresaw that development of the <a href="Comstock%20Lode">Comstock Lode</a> and other rich silver-mining areas would lower the price, causing large quantities of silver dollars to be struck and the gold standard to be endangered. During the almost three years the bill was pending before Congress, it was rarely mentioned that it would end bimetallism, though this was not concealed. Congressmen instead debated other provisions. The legislation, in addition to ending the production of the silver dollar, abolished three low-denomination coins. The bill became the Act of February 12, 1873, with the signature of President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>.

When silver prices dropped in 1876, producers sought to have their bullion struck at the Mint, only to learn that this was no longer possible. The matter became a major political controversy that lasted the remainder of the century, pitting those who valued the deflationary gold standard against those who believed <a href="free%20silver">free coinage of silver</a> to be necessary for economic prosperity. Accusations were made that the passage of the act had been secured through corruption, though there is little evidence of this. The gold standard was explicitly enacted into law in 1900, and was completely abandoned by the U.S. in 1971.

The <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201792">Mint Act of 1792</a> established the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Mint of the United States</a>. The Mint, in its first decades, only coined gold and silver in response to deposits of that metal by citizens, returning the bullion to the depositor in the form of coins. Either gold or silver could be presented for conversion into currency, as both metals were a <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a>, a dollar was equal to both a legally defined weight of silver, and another legally defined quantity of gold. Having a currency be defined in terms of two different metals is called <a href="bimetallism">bimetallism</a>. Such a system may experience instability as the price of gold and silver on the world market changes, and this took place in the first decades after 1792, as the relative values of gold and silver in Europe changed. At that time, gold or silver U.S. coins were rarely seen in the nation, as they were heavily exported because of such shifts—most pieces in circulation were foreign in origin.

In 1834, Congress made a dollar worth slightly less, thus lightening U.S. gold and silver coins (known collectively as <a href="Commodity%20money">specie</a>), making them uneconomical to export, and they were seen more often in commerce within the U.S. With this greater circulation, Congress re-examined the existing statutes relating to the Mint, and found many provisions to be obsolete. It enacted the <a href="Mint%20Act%20of%201837">Mint Act of 1837</a>, a thorough revision of the statutes relating to the Mint. New provisions included the establishment of a bullion fund, allowing depositors to be paid without waiting for their metal to go through the coining process. The ratio of value between equivalent weights of gold and silver was adjusted slightly, allowing coins of both metals to circulate within the U.S.
When silver prices rose relative to gold as a reaction to the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a>, silver coinage was worth more than face value, and rapidly flowed overseas for melting. Despite vocal opposition led by Tennessee Representative (and future president) <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, the precious metal content of smaller silver coins was reduced in 1853, allowing them to circulate. Until then, depositors of silver could choose to have their bullion struck into silver coins of any denomination of five cents or above; the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201853">Act of 1853</a> lightened the silver coins from the <a href="half%20dime">half dime</a> to the <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a> and eliminated the right of the depositor to have silver struck into those denominations. Depositors could still choose to have silver struck into <a href="Seated%20Liberty%20dollar">dollar coins</a>, but since there was more than a dollar's worth of silver in a dollar coin, it was more profitable to sell the bullion to manufacturers and jewelers. So long as silver prices remained high, this effectively placed the United States on the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>.

Although the Mint rarely received deposits of silver for striking into coins after 1853, it purchased silver bullion using the new lightweight silver coins at above-market prices. This was illegal, as Congress had ordered that the new lightweight coins only be purchasable using gold, a provision intended to limit quantities sold to actual demand. As the silver pieces had a legal tender limit of $5, if excessive numbers were circulated, they might choke commerce. This in fact occurred, and merchants and bankers complained that the legal tender limit was causing them to have to sell accumulations at a discount to brokers.

The glut was replaced with a shortage when most federal coins were hoarded amid the economic chaos of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>. Slowest to vanish was the base-metal <a href="Indian%20Head%20cent">cent</a>, which only had value because government said it did, and at that time, confidence in government was shaken. Eventually, it too vanished from circulation and commanded a premium for change. A variety of makeshifts replaced the vanished coins, such as <a href="Fractional%20currency%20%28United%20States%29">fractional currency</a> and <a href="Civil%20War%20token">merchant's tokens</a>. Beginning in 1864, Congress began to authorize base metal coins that would not be hoarded. It reduced the weight of the cent, causing it to be made of bronze, and also required a <a href="Two-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%29">two-cent piece</a> of the same metal. The following year saw the initiation of the <a href="three-cent%20nickel">three-cent nickel</a> and in 1866, the <a href="nickel%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">five-cent nickel</a> (today simply known as the nickel) began production. The two-cent piece, initially popular, saw declining mintages as the public preferred the smaller, more convenient nickel coins.

<a href="United%20States%20Note">Greenbacks</a>, which were backed by neither silver nor gold but by the credit of the United States, and which were necessitated by vast wartime expenditures, had helped to finance the war. In the late 1860s, politicians disagreed about how quickly to have the government resume paying out gold and silver in payment of its obligations. Treasury Secretary <a href="Hugh%20McCulloch">Hugh McCulloch</a> felt the best way to return to that practice was to withdraw the greenbacks as quickly as possible, and he did so until stopped by Congress, which felt his contractionist stand was hurting the economy. More and more silver was being mined in the Far West. Falls in the price of the metal made the option of depositing silver at the Mint in exchange for coin more attractive, and mintages of the silver dollar rose considerably in the late 1860s and into the 1870s. The silver dollar was fully legal tender, and some officials worried that the increased deposits would cause silver to drive gold from circulation as predicted by <a href="Gresham%27s%20law">Gresham's law</a>, endangering the gold standard.

As it had been two decades since much silver was regularly deposited for striking into coins, the fact that the United States had been on a bimetallic standard since 1792 was often forgotten. The gold standard was seen as the only possible choice, and many people assumed that the United States was on that standard, which had been adopted by strong nations like the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> (1816) and the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> (1871).

Losses of nearly $250,000 at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a> had concerned the Treasury, and, in 1866, McCullough sent <a href="John%20Jay%20Knox%20Jr.">John Jay Knox</a>, a Treasury employee, on a special investigatory mission. Knox found that informalities in transferring bullion between various officers of that mint had led to inconsistent sets of accounts, but due to the lack of receipts kept, it was not possible to pinpoint who was to blame. In 1869, Knox, by then Deputy <a href="Office%20of%20the%20Comptroller%20of%20the%20Currency">Comptroller of the Currency</a>, was sent by McCullough's successor <a href="George%20S.%20Boutwell">George Boutwell</a> to investigate other Mint facilities, discovering severe irregularities and large government losses at the New York <a href="Assay%20office%23US%20assay%20offices">Assay Office</a>. Knox again discovered a dearth of proper accounting procedures, and that officials there had trouble finding a copy of the Mint's regulations.

In 1867, an <a href="international%20monetary%20conferences">international monetary conference</a> was held in Paris to discuss how to have gold coins of various countries struck to a <a href="Latin%20Monetary%20Union">common standard</a>. Slight adjustments to the British gold <a href="Sovereign%20%28British%20coin%29">sovereign</a> and to the five-dollar gold piece (or <a href="half%20eagle">half eagle</a>) would make each equal to 25 francs, and it was proposed that the British and Americans make those changes while France began striking a 25-franc piece. None of this ever came to fruition, but in January 1868, Ohio Senator <a href="John%20Sherman">John Sherman</a> introduced legislation to place the United States formally on the gold standard, to eliminate silver as a legal tender, and to implement the recommendations of the conference.

Knox, in his 1866 report, had recommended a thorough revision of the laws pertaining to the Mint, and in January 1870, Secretary Boutwell instructed him to prepare a draft. In this, Knox had the assistance of former Mint Director <a href="Henry%20Linderman">Henry Linderman</a>, who then held a roving commission for the Treasury Department; Linderman would in 1873 become the first director of the Bureau of the Mint.

Knox completed a draft bill, intended to repeal many antiquated legal provisions, and to rewrite others. He proposed to eliminate the standard silver dollar (he proposed a lightweight silver dollar that would have a low legal tender limit), move the office of the Director of the Mint from Philadelphia to Washington, eliminate the Mint's charge to strike gold bullion (then .5 percent), and abolish the office of Treasurer at the mints and assay offices, transferring its functions to the superintendent. In drafting the bill, Knox consulted with a number of former Mint officers besides Linderman, such as former directors <a href="James%20Ross%20Snowden">James Ross Snowden</a> and <a href="Robert%20Maskell%20Patterson">Robert M. Patterson</a>, as well as former Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner <a href="Franklin%20Peale">Franklin Peale</a>. Mint Director <a href="James%20Pollard">James Pollard</a> submitted the bill to Congress on April 25, 1870.

Sherman introduced the bill on April 28, 1870, and it was referred to the <a href="Senate%20Finance%20Committee">Senate Finance Committee</a>, of which he was chairman. He did not seek its passage in that session of Congress, as lawmakers were busy with other financial legislation. The bill attracted next to no newspaper attention throughout the period of almost three years it was under consideration, though monetary experts and others watched its progress closely. On January 9, 1871, Sherman brought the bill to the Senate floor for debate. That it abolished the silver dollar, and thus bimetallism, was not discussed, as senators focused on the omission of the coinage charge (the fee for the Mint's services in converting bullion to money). This was of importance to the Senate—especially members from the Far West—because it affected what mining companies and refiners (an important economic interest) could get for their product. Sherman offered an amendment to retain the coinage charge, but it was attacked by Western senators as an unjust tax on miners and refiners of gold, and the amendment was defeated, 26–23. On January 10, the bill passed the Senate, 36–14, with Sherman voting against his own bill. It was then sent to the House of Representatives and referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures from which it was briefly brought forth on February 25 by Pennsylvania's <a href="William%20D.%20Kelley">William D. Kelley</a>, the chairman, before being recommitted to committee. The bill was not considered by the House during the remainder of the <a href="41st%20Congress">41st Congress</a>, which expired on March 3, 1871, and the Senate-passed bill died with it.

Kelley reintroduced the bill in the House when Congress reconvened in December 1871. Chairman Kelley was from Philadelphia, and was influenced by industrialist <a href="Joseph%20Wharton">Joseph Wharton</a>, who owned a nickel refinery in nearby <a href="Camden%2C%20New%20Jersey">Camden, New Jersey</a>, from which the Mint purchased, without competitive bidding, much of the metal for the three-cent and five-cent base metal coins. The bill at that time proposed that the cent, then made of bronze, be made of nickel alloy as well—when it was debated on January 9, 1872, Wharton's interest was an immediate target. Kelley was quizzed by New York Representative <a href="Clarkson%20Nott%20Potter">Clarkson Potter</a>, who called the bill "this Pennsylvania contrivance" which would give "a monopoly to the gentleman in Pennsylvania [Wharton]." Another New Yorker, <a href="Dwight%20Townsend">Dwight Townsend</a>, moved to scuttle the bill in disgust over how long it was taking to pass; his motion on voice vote would have succeeded, but there was no <a href="quorum">quorum</a> and it failed on a roll call vote. On January 10, Missouri Congressman <a href="James%20Robinson%20McCormick">James R. McCormick</a>, who represented nickel producers in his home state, introduced an amendment for competitive bidding for nickel purchases by the Mint. Rather than accede to McCormick's amendment, Kelley sent the bill back to committee.

When the bill was brought back to the House floor on April 9, 1872, it was managed by Massachusetts Representative <a href="Samuel%20Hooper">Samuel Hooper</a>, chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Financial%20Services">House Committee on Banking and Currency</a>. He went through the bill section by section, and stated the bill would place the United States on the gold standard. In the ensuing debate, other representatives, including Potter and Kelley, showed their understanding of that. The bill now provided for competitive nickel bidding, but was again withdrawn, this time by Hooper, after Kelley accused Potter of trying to benefit New York bullion merchants. This fracas caused other New Yorkers to oppose the bill. On May 27, Hooper presented a substitute bill, which he got passed, 110–13, without it even being read. Among the changes that the House made to Knox's bill were a slight increase in weight of the subsidiary silver coins (the <a href="dime%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">dime</a>, <a href="quarter%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">quarter dollar</a>, and half dollar), making a dollar in them weigh .

The bill then awaited Congress reconvening in December. Early in that month, Secretary Boutwell issued his annual report, calling for the passage of the legislation. On the 16th, the bill was referred to Sherman's committee. It emerged without the plan to make the cent from copper-nickel, and with the lightweight silver dollar replaced with a <a href="Trade%20dollar">Trade dollar</a> intended for commerce in the Far East, having limited legal tender status in the U.S. The bill was reported back to the Senate on January 7, 1873. It was debated there on the 17th.

One topic of discussion was the bill's requirement that an eagle appear on larger U.S. coins. Linderman had requested an amendment to require that gold and silver coins bear a statement of their weight and fineness, which would mean sacrificing the eagle. California's <a href="Eugene%20Casserly">Eugene Casserly</a> opposed the amendment, which was sponsored by Sherman, stating "it will hardly be possible to think of a half dollar or a quarter dollar as being such a coin without the eagle upon it". The eagle was saved when the amendment failed, 24 in favor and 26 against. Casserly was less successful with an amendment to remove entirely the reduced coinage charge of .2 percent, which failed. Sherman moved the bill along as quickly as he could, and it passed without a recorded vote. The House initially refused to agree to the Trade dollar; representatives of both houses, led by Sherman and Potter, met in a <a href="conference%20committee">conference committee</a>, and the House acceded to the Senate amendment for the Trade dollar. The bill passed both houses without further debate, and was signed by President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> on February 12, 1873. At no point in its almost three-year journey through the legislative process did the bill provide for the retention of the standard silver dollar, into which depositors could have their bullion coined.

When, several years after its passage, the 1873 law became a political issue, some of those involved in enacting it, including Sherman and Linderman, stated that there had been no intent to end bimetallism in the elimination of the authority for private citizens to have silver bullion coined into dollars. They argued that the 1853 legislation had ended the practice of having bullion struck into smaller-denomination coins; the 1873 act simply rectified an omission and eliminated a coin with a low mintage that did not circulate. They were not always consistent in their denials: Boutwell wrote in his memoirs that "in 1873 I had come to believe that it was wise for every nation to recognize, establish, and maintain the gold standard ... hence it was that I determined to abandon the idea of a double [i.e., bimetallic] standard.

Within a few years, the idea that the omission of the silver dollar from the Coinage Act had not been with intent to place the United States on the gold standard became the establishment position. Part of this was in reaction against the conspiracy theories that were circulating about the "Crime of '73", as advocates of bimetallism called the act. This was accepted by many historians well into the 20th century. Neil Carothers, in his 1930 history of small-denomination U.S. currency, wrote that "many others have demonstrated that this was not a corrupt or surreptitious action by the enemies of silver. The elimination of the standard silver dollar was simply in the interests of clarifying the coinage law ... Not one party to the passage of the law of 1873 recognized the significance of the abolition of the legally existing double standard." According to historian <a href="Allen%20Weinstein">Allen Weinstein</a>, "Silver's demonetization, according to the traditional account, came as an unplanned if fortunate by-product of a complex and largely technical revision of the mint laws in the Coinage Act of 1873."

Economist <a href="Milton%20Friedman">Milton Friedman</a> wrote, "what is not open to question is that the standard silver dollar was omitted from the list of coins to be minted intentionally, in full knowledge of the likely consequences, and in the belief that those consequences were desirable." He cited Walter T. K. Nugent's 1968 book, "Money and American Society, 1865—1880",

Knox and Linderman were both personally familiar with mining conditions in the Far West. They knew that the amount of bullion produced was only going to increase, and would likely drop the price of silver below the level ($1.2929 per troy ounce) at which the metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money. In his explanatory statement accompanying his draft bill, Knox explained the discontinuance of the silver dollar would mean the United States was no longer a bimetallic nation. Boutwell, in his 1872 annual report, urged Congress to end the coinage of silver from private deposits, lest the government take a loss from paying out gold in exchange for the silver dollars, and ultimately having to melt them when they could not be circulated. According to Nugent, "Were Knox, Linderman, Boutwell, Sherman, and others aware of what they were doing when they planned to drop the silver dollar? It is inconceivable that they were not; Knox's statement was explicit. But did they urge it because they feared a drop in silver prices? No one made an explicit statement to that effect, but it was undoubtedly the case."

The Director of the Mint had always been located at the Philadelphia Mint, with the other mints and assay offices governed by superintendents of whom the director was in charge. The 1873 act moved the office to Washington, where the director supervised the new Bureau of the Mint and remained in charge of all mints and assay offices. The Mint Director required appointment by the president and confirmation by the Senate and served a term of five years (unless removed by the president). Henceforth, the Philadelphia Mint would be under the immediate control of a superintendent, like the other mints. The act also formally made the bureau part of the Department of the Treasury. The Mint of the United States had originally reported directly to the president but over time legislation had made it subject to control by the Treasury Secretary.

Little change was made to the officers of the mints, other than adding a superintendent for Philadelphia (Pollock would be the first incumbent), and abolishing the office of Treasurer at each facility. In addition to the superintendent, each mint had as officers the Assayer, the Melter and Refiner, and the Coiner; each was required to post a bond to indemnify the government against losses during their tenure of office, and each was responsible for part of the coining process. Philadelphia also had an Engraver (sometimes Chief Engraver), responsible for preparing coinage dies and designs, though the Director of the Mint could, with the agreement of the Treasury Secretary, hire outside artists to design coins. The provision allowing for the hiring of outside artists was inserted at the suggestion of former director Patterson. The act set the salaries and bonding requirements for the officers, and required them to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, as was the case under both the 1792 and 1837 acts. It also set forth the procedures for appointment of an acting officer or Director of the Mint, in the case of the incumbent's temporary absence.

Sections 14 to 16 of the act set forth the coins authorized to be struck by the Mint Bureau. This is the part of the act that would later prove contentious, as it omitted the standard silver dollar, since 1853 the only coin into which depositors of silver bullion could have their metal struck. It did allow for a Trade dollar, of higher weight than the old coin, that depositors could have their silver made into, but the legal tender of this and all silver coins was limited to $5—the old silver dollar had an unlimited legal tender. All gold coins had unlimited legal tender, and the act made provision for the redemption of gold coin <a href="Abrasion%20%28mechanical%29">abraded</a> below normal weight at full value, if twenty years or more old and if still containing 99.5 percent or more of the authorized weight. Lightweight gold coin that did not meet these qualifications would have the loss in value fall upon the depositor.

Also eliminated by the 1873 act were the two-cent piece, three-cent silver and half dime. Although the first two coins circulated little, the half dime was still being heavily struck by the San Francisco Mint for use in the Far West, where paper money was disfavored. The coins authorized by the 1873 act were the cent, <a href="three-cent%20nickel">three-cent nickel</a>, five-cent nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar, <a href="Trade%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">Trade dollar</a>, <a href="gold%20dollar">gold dollar</a>, <a href="quarter%20eagle">quarter eagle</a>, <a href="three-dollar%20piece">three-dollar piece</a>, <a href="half%20eagle">half eagle</a>, <a href="eagle%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">eagle</a>, and <a href="double%20eagle">double eagle</a>.

The act prescribed the specifications of each coin. No change was made to the bronze composition of the cent. The dime, quarter, and half dollar were made slightly heavier so that a dollar in these coins would weigh , in a nod to the metric system—the five-cent nickel already weighed . It required that the obverse of each American coin be emblematic of Liberty, and that an eagle must appear on the reverse, except for the small-diameter cent, three-cent nickel, five-cent nickel, dime, gold dollar, and three-dollar piece, on which an eagle could not appear. It required the use of the country's name on the reverse, and of "E Pluribus Unum" somewhere on the coin. It allowed the motto "In God We Trust" to appear on American coinage—continuing permission granted in the Act of March 3, 1865, which had authorized the three-cent nickel. The 1873 law allowed for the redemption of current or obsolete base-metal coinage by the Treasury when presented in lots of $20 or more, continuing a provision enacted in 1871.

Further provisions in this part of the act allowed depositors of silver bullion to receive their metal back in the form of bars or in Trade dollars. It forbade deposit of silver for striking into other coins, but allowed the Mint, for two years, to purchase silver bullion with silver coins at Philadelphia and at the New York Assay Office. This practice, although illegal under the 1853 act, had long been permitted by Mint Directors.

The annual <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a> met at the Philadelphia Mint in most years from 1797 to 1980, when it was abolished. Consisting of government officials and members of the public, it tested the gold and silver coins issued by the Mint to ensure they met standards.

The 1837 act had designated the judge of the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Eastern%20District%20of%20Pennsylvania">United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Attorney">United States Attorney</a> for that district, and the Collector of the Port of Philadelphia as members "ex officio" of the Assay Commission. The Coinage Act of 1873 kept the judge as a member, but omitted the other two, substituting the Comptroller of the Currency and the assayer of the New York <a href="Assay%20office">Assay office</a>. Under the 1837 act, the president was allowed to appoint members of the public each year, and this continued under the new legislation. The 1873 law also prescribed a detailed procedure for taking samples from each delivery by that mint's Coiner, sealing them in envelopes and transmitting them to Philadelphia, where the Assay Commission met each February.

This part of the Coinage Act also provided as to how the Coiner should settle accounts, for internal testing of coins outside the auspices of the Assay Commission, and continued the bullion fund, allowing depositors of gold or silver to receive coins or other payment without having to wait for the actual metal they had deposited to go through the coining process. The mints were required to have a set of weights conforming to the official weight weighing one troy pound purchased by the U.S. minister in London in 1827, and to have the ones at Philadelphia tested in the presence of the Assay Commission each year.

Sections 51 to 53 regulated matters that had proved controversial in past decades. Section 51 required all obverse dies (containing the date on most denominations) to be destroyed at the conclusion of each year. Under Director Snowden in the 1850s, the Mint had restruck rare early-dated coins to sell or exchange with collectors. Medals of a national nature could be struck at Philadelphia under Section 52, but private medals were forbidden. Until 1854, the year in which he was fired by President <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a>, Peale had conducted a controversial medals business on the premises of the Philadelphia Mint. Section 53 required the bureau's profits from <a href="seigniorage">seigniorage</a> to be deposited in the Treasury and forbade the Mint from paying expenses or salaries from that money. Under Director Patterson (retired 1851), the Mint had retained such earnings, and spent them without congressional oversight.

The assay offices were regulated by sections 54 through 60, under the control of the Director of the Mint. Each office would be governed in a manner similar to the mints, with a superintendent in charge and two subordinate officers: an Assayer and a Melter and Refiner. Sections 61 to 64 forbade counterfeiting, intentional lightening of coins to secure metal, and other offenses, and prescribed the punishments for them. Section 65 is a transition provision, setting an April 1, 1873 effective date, as well as providing that the current Director of the Mint (Pollock) would become superintendent at Philadelphia, and the occupants of the office of Treasurer at each mint (abolished by the legislation) would become Assistant Treasurers of the United States. Section 66 names each mint and assay office, and Section 67 names the legislation as the "Coinage Act of one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three".

The abolition of the half dime, still circulating in the Far West, led to shortages of small change there. Congress tried to address this with the unpopular <a href="twenty-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">twenty-cent piece</a>, which was struck for circulation only in 1875 and 1876 and was rejected by the public for its similarity to the quarter dollar. The Western United States was not fully supplied with small change until the Mint began striking cents there in 1908 and five-cent nickels in 1912. The Trade dollar, struck principally to compete with Mexican dollars in the Far East trade, failed to gain full acceptance in the Orient. Many were returned to (or never left) the United States. As they could be purchased at a discount, they were popular among employers, who placed them in workers' pay packets. In 1876, Congress revoked even the limited legal tender status they enjoyed; in 1878, the Mint stopped striking them except for collectors, and even that limited issue ceased after 1885. In 1887, Congress allowed a six-month window during which they could be redeemed for other currency, provided they had not been <a href="seal%20%28East%20Asia%29">chopmarked</a> by Asian merchants.
As Friedman noted, if the price of silver had remained high, the exclusion of the silver dollar from the 1873 act would have been irrelevant. By 1874, the effect of the new mines in the Far West, and the sale of silver in Germany following its demonetization there, combined to force the price of silver down. Silver producers had not been aware of the statutory change, and only learned of it when they sought to present silver at the mints for coining. According to numismatic historian <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a>, "an agitation followed, during which several pious Congressmen feigned ignorance of the repeal, maintaining it had been worked into the Mint bill surreptitiously." One Delaware manufacturer wrote to his senator, <a href="Thomas%20F.%20Bayard">Thomas F. Bayard</a>, in 1878, "at the beginning ... I was totally ignorant of all that related to the silver question—so much in fact that (I find now like almost everyone else not excluding Congressmen!) I did not know Silver had been demonetized."

A severe depression, the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a>, began in the same year as passage of the act, and persisted for much of the decade. Many in the United States came to believe the gold standard too rigid to deal with economic hard times like those, and sought to restore bimetallism. The inflation caused by such a policy would enable debtors to repay what they owed more easily. The price of silver continued to fall—the silver in a dollar in the new metric-weight subsidiary silver coins was worth only $.75 by mid-1876, though the price recovered some after that.

In early 1875, Congress passed a bill for the <a href="Specie%20Payment%20Resumption%20Act">resumption of specie payments</a> (that is, in gold and silver coin)—effective in 1879. Friedman stated that had it not been for the 1873 act, resumption would have been on the effective basis of a silver standard, which he viewed as a good thing, allowing for more economic stability and "almost surely would have avoided" the downturn of the early 1890s known as the <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a>.
Support for bimetallism grew in the 1870s, and resulted in the passage of the <a href="Bland%E2%80%93Allison%20Act">Bland–Allison Act</a> of February 28, 1878, over the veto of President <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a>. This legislation required the Treasury to purchase millions of dollars' worth of silver bullion each month, and coin it into <a href="Morgan%20dollar">silver dollars</a>—the denomination was restored as a legal tender, except when gold was specified by law or private contract. Renewed support for silver led to the passage of the <a href="Sherman%20Silver%20Purchase%20Act">Sherman Silver Purchase Act</a> of 1890, greatly increasing the silver purchases, and requiring the Treasury to pay for them in banknotes that could be redeemed for gold. Over the next three years, $132,000,000 in gold was withdrawn from the Treasury, and amid another depression President <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> secured the repeal of the silver purchase act.

The <a href="free%20silver">free silver</a> movement reached its height with the <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201896">1896 campaign</a> of former Nebraska representative <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>, who won the Democratic nomination for president after his <a href="Cross%20of%20Gold%20speech">Cross of Gold speech</a>, which decried the gold standard, electrified the <a href="1896%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1896 Democratic National Convention</a>. Bryan was defeated in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201896">the election</a> by former Ohio governor <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a>, and in 1900, Congress passed the <a href="Gold%20Standard%20Act">Gold Standard Act</a>, placing that standard into law. The gold standard was departed from for many purposes by President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a>'s New Deal administration, and completely ended by President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> in 1971.

"<a href="The%20Atlanta%20Journal-Constitution">The Atlanta Constitution</a>" on April 1, 1873, reported the passage of the Coinage Act. It noted the abolition of the two-cent piece and the authorization of the Trade dollar, but did not mention the ending of the standard silver dollar. There was no widespread objection to the 1873 act until 1876. Several factors combined to bring forth protest then: tight <a href="Monetary%20policy">money policies</a> by the Treasury in preparation for the resumption of specie payments, a more precipitous drop in the price of silver than had hitherto been the case, and widespread use of Trade dollars after their rejection in the Chinese market. At the same time, the <a href="Comstock%20Lode">Comstock Lode</a> and other Western mining areas were producing record amounts of silver. With a depression still ongoing, silver began to be seen as a means of inflating the currency and stimulating the economy.

Beginning in March 1876, former newspaper editor George Weston published letters asserting that bimetallism was mandated by the Constitution, and questioning how the Coinage Act had passed. Sympathetic newspapers began to suggest that the legislation had been enacted through corruption for the benefit of wealthy capitalists. On August 5, 1876, Missouri Congressman <a href="Richard%20P.%20Bland">Richard P. Bland</a> (soon to be known as "Silver Dick") told the House of Representatives, "The act of February 12, 1873 was a fraud, because its title gave no clue to the real intent of the act. The record shows that the act was stealthily passed, without reconsideration and without debate." In 1878, Congressman Kelley, who had introduced the bill into the House, stated, "I was ignorant of the fact it would demonetize the silver dollar".

Often blamed by those who deemed the act a crime was British financial writer <a href="Ernest%20Seyd">Ernest Seyd</a>, who had given advice as to the text of the bill, as attested by Congressman Hooper on the House floor in 1872. Seyd, according to this theory, was the agent of a group of British holders of American bonds, who had sent Seyd to America with ₤100,000 (then about $550,000) to bribe congressmen into demonetizing silver. Kelley denied this had taken place, but the story stuck, and became a common belief in the silver movement. In 1890, Seyd's corrupt involvement was asserted on the floor of the House of Representatives by Arkansas's <a href="Thomas%20C.%20McRae">Thomas C. McRae</a>. Seyd was in fact an ardent bimetallist who strongly objected to the American demonetization of silver. He had submitted, at Hooper's request, an analysis of the bill in the course of which he advocated retaining the silver dollar as a legal tender.

The earliest use of the phrase "Crime of 1873" in congressional debate was by Colorado Senator <a href="Henry%20M.%20Teller">Henry M. Teller</a>, who on July 10, 1890, stated, "the fight for free coinage [of silver] is on, and it will stay on, too, till the will of the people shall be heard in the enactment of a law that shall put silver back where it belongs and where it would have been but for the blunder or the crime of 1873". The act had long been referred to as a "crime" without the exact phrase being used; in one 1889 speech, Nevada Senator <a href="William%20Morris%20Stewart">William M. Stewart</a> called it a "crime" seven times. He had voted for it in 1873.

Colorado River

The Colorado River is one of the principal <a href="river">river</a>s (along with the <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a>) in the <a href="Southwestern%20United%20States">Southwestern United States</a> and <a href="Northern%20Mexico">northern Mexico</a>. The river drains an expansive, arid <a href="drainage%20basin">watershed</a> that encompasses parts of seven U.S. and two Mexican states. Starting in the central <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> of <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, the river flows generally southwest across the <a href="Colorado%20Plateau">Colorado Plateau</a> and through the <a href="Grand%20Canyon">Grand Canyon</a> before reaching <a href="Lake%20Mead">Lake Mead</a> on the <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>–<a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> border, where it turns south toward the <a href="Mexico%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">international border</a>. After entering Mexico, the Colorado approaches the mostly dry <a href="Colorado%20River%20Delta">Colorado River Delta</a> at the tip of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20California">Gulf of California</a> between <a href="Baja%20California">Baja California</a> and <a href="Sonora">Sonora</a>.

Known for its dramatic canyons, whitewater rapids, and eleven <a href="National%20parks%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. National Parks</a>, the Colorado River and its tributaries are a vital source of water for 40 million people. The river and its tributaries are controlled by an extensive system of dams, reservoirs, and aqueducts, which in most years divert its entire flow for agricultural <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a> and domestic water supply. Its large flow and steep gradient are used for generating <a href="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectric power</a>, and its major dams regulate <a href="Peaking%20power%20plant">peaking power</a> demands in much of the <a href="Intermountain%20West">Intermountain West</a>. Intensive water consumption has dried up the lower of the river, which has rarely reached the sea since the 1960s.

Beginning with small bands of nomadic <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a>s, <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native Americans</a> have inhabited the Colorado River basin for at least 8,000 years. Between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago, the watershed was home to large agricultural civilizations – considered some of the most sophisticated indigenous North American cultures – which eventually declined due to a combination of severe drought and poor land use practices. Most native peoples that inhabit the region today are descended from other groups that settled there beginning about 1,000 years ago. <a href="Europe">Europe</a>ans first entered the Colorado Basin in the 16th century, when explorers from Spain began mapping and claiming the area, which became part of Mexico upon its independence in 1821. Early contact between Europeans and Native Americans was generally limited to the <a href="North%20American%20fur%20trade">fur trade</a> in the headwaters and sporadic trade interactions along the lower river.

After most of the Colorado River basin became part of the U.S. in 1846, much of the river's course was still the subject of myths and speculation. Several expeditions charted the Colorado in the mid-19th century – one of which, led by <a href="John%20Wesley%20Powell">John Wesley Powell</a>, was the first to run the rapids of the Grand Canyon. American explorers collected valuable information that was later used to develop the river for navigation and water supply. Large-scale settlement of the lower basin began in the mid- to late-19th century, with <a href="steamboat">steamboat</a>s providing transportation from the Gulf of California to landings along the river that linked to wagon roads to the interior. Starting in the 1860s, gold and silver strikes drew prospectors to parts of the upper Colorado River basin.

Large engineering works began around the start of the 20th century, with major guidelines established in a series of international and U.S. interstate treaties known as the "Law of the River". The U.S. federal government was the main driving force behind the construction of dams and aqueducts, although many state and local water agencies were also involved. Most of the major dams were built between 1910 and 1970; the system keystone, <a href="Hoover%20Dam">Hoover Dam</a>, was completed in 1935. The Colorado is now considered among the most controlled and litigated rivers in the world, with every drop of its water fully allocated.

The <a href="environmental%20movement">environmental movement</a> in the American Southwest has opposed the damming and diversion of the Colorado River system because of detrimental effects on the ecology and natural beauty of the river and its tributaries. During the construction of <a href="Glen%20Canyon%20Dam">Glen Canyon Dam</a>, environmental organizations vowed to block any further development of the river, and a number of later dam and aqueduct proposals were defeated by citizen opposition. As demands for Colorado River water continue to rise, the level of human development and control of the river continues to generate controversy.

The Colorado begins at <a href="La%20Poudre%20Pass">La Poudre Pass</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Rocky%20Mountains">Southern Rocky Mountains</a> of Colorado, at just under above sea level. After a short run south, the river turns west below <a href="Grand%20Lake%20%28Colorado%29">Grand Lake</a>, the largest natural lake in the state. For the first of its course, the Colorado carves its way through the mountainous <a href="Colorado%20Western%20Slope">Western Slope</a>, a sparsely populated region defined by the portion of the state west of the <a href="Continental%20Divide%20of%20the%20Americas">Continental Divide</a>. As it flows southwest, it gains strength from many small tributaries, as well as larger ones including the <a href="Blue%20River%20%28Colorado%29">Blue</a>, <a href="Eagle%20River%20%28Colorado%29">Eagle</a> and <a href="Roaring%20Fork%20River">Roaring Fork</a> rivers. After passing through <a href="De%20Beque%20Canyon">De Beque Canyon</a>, the Colorado emerges from the Rockies into the <a href="Grand%20Valley%20%28Colorado-Utah%29">Grand Valley</a>, a major farming and ranching region where it meets one of its largest tributaries, the <a href="Gunnison%20River">Gunnison River</a>, at <a href="Grand%20Junction%2C%20Colorado">Grand Junction</a>. Most of the upper river is a swift whitewater stream ranging from wide, the depth ranging from , with a few notable exceptions, such as the Blackrocks <a href="Reach%20%28geography%29">reach</a> where the river is nearly deep. In a few areas, such as the marshy Kawuneeche Valley near the headwaters and the Grand Valley, it exhibits <a href="Braided%20stream">braided</a> characteristics.

Arcing northwest, the Colorado begins to cut across the eponymous <a href="Colorado%20Plateau">Colorado Plateau</a>, a vast area of high desert centered at the <a href="Four%20Corners">Four Corners</a> of the southwestern United States. Here, the climate becomes significantly drier than that in the Rocky Mountains, and the river becomes entrenched in progressively deeper gorges of bare rock, beginning with <a href="Ruby%20Canyon">Ruby Canyon</a> and then <a href="Westwater%20Canyon">Westwater Canyon</a> as it enters <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, now once again heading southwest. Farther downstream it receives the <a href="Dolores%20River">Dolores River</a> and defines the southern border of <a href="Arches%20National%20Park">Arches National Park</a>, before passing <a href="Moab%2C%20Utah">Moab</a> and flowing through "The Portal", where it exits the Moab Valley between a pair of sandstone cliffs.

In Utah, the Colorado flows primarily through the "<a href="Entrada%20Sandstone">slickrock</a>" country, which is characterized by its narrow canyons and unique "folds" created by the tilting of sedimentary rock layers along faults. This is one of the most inaccessible regions of the continental United States. Below the confluence with the <a href="Green%20River%20%28Colorado%20River%29">Green River</a>, its largest tributary, in <a href="Canyonlands%20National%20Park">Canyonlands National Park</a>, the Colorado enters <a href="Cataract%20Canyon">Cataract Canyon</a>, named for its dangerous rapids, and then <a href="Glen%20Canyon">Glen Canyon</a>, known for its arches and erosion-sculpted <a href="Navajo%20sandstone">Navajo sandstone</a> formations. Here, the <a href="San%20Juan%20River%20%28Colorado%20River%29">San Juan River</a>, carrying runoff from the southern slope of Colorado's <a href="San%20Juan%20Mountains">San Juan Mountains</a>, joins the Colorado from the east. The Colorado then enters northern <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>, where since the 1960s <a href="Glen%20Canyon%20Dam">Glen Canyon Dam</a> near <a href="Page%2C%20Arizona">Page</a> has flooded the Glen Canyon reach of the river, forming <a href="Lake%20Powell">Lake Powell</a> for water supply and <a href="hydroelectricity">hydroelectricity</a> generation.
In Arizona, the river passes <a href="Lee%27s%20Ferry">Lee's Ferry</a>, an important crossing for early explorers and settlers and since the early 20th century the principal point where Colorado River flows are measured for apportionment to the seven U.S. and two Mexican states in the basin. Downstream, the river enters <a href="Marble%20Canyon">Marble Canyon</a>, the beginning of the <a href="Grand%20Canyon">Grand Canyon</a>, passing under the <a href="Navajo%20Bridge">Navajo Bridge</a>s on a now southward course. Below the confluence with the <a href="Little%20Colorado%20River">Little Colorado River</a>, the river swings west into Granite Gorge, the most dramatic portion of the Grand Canyon, where the river cuts up to into the Colorado Plateau, exposing some of the oldest visible rocks on Earth, dating as long ago as 2 billion years. The of the river that flow through the Grand Canyon are largely encompassed by <a href="Grand%20Canyon%20National%20Park">Grand Canyon National Park</a> and are known for their difficult whitewater, separated by pools that reach up to in depth.

At the lower end of Grand Canyon, the Colorado widens into <a href="Lake%20Mead">Lake Mead</a>, the largest reservoir in the continental United States, formed by <a href="Hoover%20Dam">Hoover Dam</a> on the border of Arizona and <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>. Situated southeast of metropolitan <a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada">Las Vegas</a>, the dam is an integral component for management of the Colorado River, controlling floods and storing water for farms and cities in the lower Colorado River basin. Below the dam the river passes under the <a href="Mike%20O%27Callaghan%E2%80%93Pat%20Tillman%20Memorial%20Bridge">Mike O'Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge</a> – which at nearly above the water is the highest concrete <a href="arch%20bridge">arch bridge</a> in the Western Hemisphere – and then turns due south towards Mexico, defining the Arizona–Nevada and Arizona–<a href="California">California</a> borders.
After leaving the confines of the <a href="Black%20Canyon%20of%20the%20Colorado">Black Canyon</a>, the river emerges from the Colorado Plateau into the <a href="Lower%20Colorado%20River%20Valley">Lower Colorado River Valley</a> (LCRV), a desert region dependent on irrigation agriculture and tourism and also home to several major <a href="Indian%20reservation">Indian reservation</a>s. The river widens here to a broad, moderately deep waterway averaging wide and reaching up to across, with depths ranging from . Before <a href="River%20engineering%23Channelization">channelization</a> of the Colorado in the 20th century, the lower river was subject to frequent course changes caused by seasonal flow variations. <a href="Joseph%20C.%20Ives">Joseph C. Ives</a>, who surveyed the lower river in 1861, wrote that "the shifting of the channel, the banks, the islands, the bars is so continual and rapid that a detailed description, derived from the experiences of one trip, would be found incorrect, not only during the subsequent year, but perhaps in the course of a week, or even a day."

The LCRV is one of the most densely populated areas along the river, and there are numerous towns including <a href="Bullhead%20City%2C%20Arizona">Bullhead City, Arizona</a>, <a href="Needles%2C%20California">Needles, California</a>, and <a href="Lake%20Havasu%20City%2C%20Arizona">Lake Havasu City, Arizona</a>. Here, many diversions draw from the river, providing water for both local uses and distant regions including the <a href="Salt%20River%20Valley">Salt River Valley</a> of Arizona and metropolitan <a href="Southern%20California">Southern California</a>. The last major U.S. diversion is at <a href="Imperial%20Dam">Imperial Dam</a>, where over 90 percent of the river's remaining flow is moved into the <a href="All-American%20Canal">All-American Canal</a> to irrigate California's <a href="Imperial%20Valley">Imperial Valley</a>, the most productive winter agricultural region in the United States.

Below Imperial Dam, only a small portion of the Colorado River makes it beyond <a href="Yuma%2C%20Arizona">Yuma, Arizona</a>, and the confluence with the intermittent <a href="Gila%20River">Gila River</a> – which carries runoff from western <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> and most of Arizona – before defining about of the <a href="Mexico%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Mexico–United States border</a>. At <a href="Morelos%20Dam">Morelos Dam</a>, the entire remaining flow of the Colorado is diverted to irrigate the <a href="Mexicali%20Valley">Mexicali Valley</a>, among Mexico's most fertile agricultural lands. Below <a href="San%20Luis%20R%C3%ADo%20Colorado">San Luis Río Colorado</a>, the Colorado passes entirely into Mexico, defining the <a href="Baja%20California">Baja California</a>–<a href="Sonora">Sonora</a> border; in most years, the stretch of the Colorado between here and the Gulf of California is dry or a trickle formed by irrigation return flows. The <a href="Hardy%20River">Hardy River</a> provides most of the flow into the <a href="Colorado%20River%20Delta">Colorado River Delta</a>, a vast alluvial floodplain covering about of northwestern Mexico. A large <a href="estuary">estuary</a> is formed here before the Colorado empties into the Gulf about south of Yuma. Before 20th-century development dewatered the lower Colorado, a major <a href="tidal%20bore">tidal bore</a> was present in the delta and estuary; the first historical record was made by the <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>n missionary in Spanish service Father <a href="Ferdinand%20Kon%C5%A1%C4%8Dak">Ferdinand Konščak</a> on July 18, 1746. During <a href="spring%20tide">spring tide</a> conditions, the tidal bore – locally called "El Burro" – formed in the estuary about <a href="Montague%20Island%20%28Baja%20California%29">Montague Island</a> in Baja California and propagated upstream.

The Colorado is joined by over 25 significant tributaries, of which the Green River is the largest by both length and discharge. The Green River takes drainage from the <a href="Wind%20River%20Range">Wind River Range</a> of west-central Wyoming, from Utah's <a href="Uinta%20Mountains">Uinta Mountains</a>, and from the Rockies of northwestern Colorado. The Gila River is the second longest and drains a greater area than the Green, but has a significantly lower flow because of a more arid climate and larger diversions for irrigation and cities. Both the Gunnison and San Juan rivers, which derive most of their water from Rocky Mountains snowmelt, contribute more water than the Gila contributed naturally.

In its natural state, the Colorado River poured about into the Gulf of California each year, amounting to an average flow rate of . Its flow regime was not at all steady – indeed, "prior to the construction of federal dams and reservoirs, the Colorado was a river of extremes like no other in the United States." Once, the river reached peaks of more than in the summer and low flows of less than in the winter annually. At <a href="Topock%2C%20Arizona">Topock, Arizona</a>, about upstream from the Gulf, a maximum historical <a href="Discharge%20%28hydrology%29">discharge</a> of was recorded in 1884 and a minimum of was recorded in 1935. In contrast, the regulated discharge rates on the lower Colorado River below Hoover Dam rarely exceed or drop below . Annual runoff volume has ranged from a high of in 1984 to a low of in 2002, although in most years only a small portion of this flow, if any, reaches the Gulf.
Between 85 and 90 percent of the Colorado River's discharge originates in snowmelt, mostly from the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and Wyoming. The three major upper tributaries of the Colorado – the Gunnison, Green, and San Juan – alone deliver almost per year to the main stem, mostly from snowmelt. The remaining 10 to 15 percent comes from a variety of sources, principally groundwater <a href="Baseflow">base flow</a> and summer <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a> storms. The latter often produces heavy, highly localized floods on lower tributaries of the river, but does not often contribute significant volumes of runoff. Most of the annual runoff in the basin occurs with the melting of Rocky Mountains <a href="snowpack">snowpack</a>, which begins in April and peaks during May and June before exhausting in late July or early August.

Flows at the mouth of the river have steadily declined since the beginning of the 20th century, and in most years after 1960 the Colorado River has run dry before reaching the Pacific Ocean. Irrigation, industrial, and municipal diversions, evaporation from reservoirs, natural runoff, and likely climate change, have all contributed to this substantial reduction in flow, threatening the water supply for the future. For example, the Gila River – formerly one of the Colorado's largest tributaries – contributes little more than a trickle in most years due to use of its water by cities and farms in central Arizona. The average flow rate of the Colorado at the northernmost point of the Mexico–United States border (NIB, or Northerly International Boundary) is about , per year – less than a tenth of the natural flow – due to upstream water use. Below this point, the remaining flow is diverted to irrigate the Mexicali Valley, leaving a dry riverbed from <a href="Morelos%20Dam">Morelos Dam</a> to the sea that is supplemented by intermittent flows of irrigation drainage water. There have been exceptions, however, namely in the early to mid-1980s, when the Colorado once again reached the sea during several consecutive years of record-breaking precipitation and snowmelt. In 1984, so much excess runoff occurred that some , or , poured into the sea.

The <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> (USGS) operates or has operated 46 <a href="stream%20gauge">stream gauge</a>s to measure the discharge of the Colorado River, ranging from the headwaters near Grand Lake to the Mexico–U.S. border. The tables at right list data associated with eight of these gauges. River flows as gauged at Lee's Ferry, Arizona, about halfway along the length of the Colorado and below Glen Canyon Dam, are used to determine water allocations in the Colorado River basin. The average discharge recorded there was approximately , per year, from 1921 to 2010. This figure has been heavily affected by upstream diversions and reservoir evaporation, especially after the completion of the <a href="Colorado%20River%20Storage%20Project">Colorado River Storage Project</a> in the 1970s. Prior to the completion of Glen Canyon Dam in 1964, the average discharge recorded between 1912 and 1962 was , per year.

The <a href="drainage%20basin">drainage basin</a> or watershed of the Colorado River encompasses of southwestern North America, making it the seventh largest on the continent. About , or 97 percent of the watershed, is in the United States. The river and its tributaries drain most of western Colorado and New Mexico, southwestern <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, eastern and southern Utah, southeastern Nevada and California, and nearly all of Arizona. The areas drained within Baja California and Sonora are very small and do not contribute measurable runoff. Most of the basin is arid, defined by the <a href="Sonoran%20Desert">Sonoran</a> and <a href="Mojave%20Desert">Mojave</a> deserts and the expanse of the Colorado Plateau, although significant expanses of forest are found in the Rocky Mountains; the Kaibab, <a href="Aquarius%20Plateau">Aquarius</a>, and <a href="Markagunt%20Plateau">Markagunt</a> plateaus in southern Utah and northern Arizona; the <a href="Mogollon%20Rim">Mogollon Rim</a> through central Arizona; and other smaller mountain ranges and <a href="sky%20island">sky island</a>s. Elevations range from sea level at the Gulf of California to at the summit of <a href="Uncompahgre%20Peak">Uncompahgre Peak</a> in Colorado, with an average of across the entire basin.

Climate varies widely across the watershed. Mean monthly high temperatures are in the upper basin and in the lower basin, and lows average , respectively. Annual precipitation averages , ranging from over in some areas of the Rockies to just along the Mexican reach of the river. The upper basin generally receives snow and rain during the winter and early spring, while precipitation in the lower basin falls mainly during intense but infrequent summer thunderstorms brought on by the <a href="North%20American%20Monsoon">North American Monsoon</a>.
As of 2010, approximately 12.7 million people lived in the Colorado River basin. <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix</a> in Arizona and Las Vegas in Nevada are the largest metropolitan areas in the watershed. Population densities are also high along the lower Colorado River below Davis Dam, which includes Bullhead City, Lake Havasu City, and Yuma. Other significant population centers in the basin include <a href="Tucson%2C%20Arizona">Tucson, Arizona</a>; <a href="St.%20George%2C%20Utah">St. George, Utah</a>; and Grand Junction, Colorado. Colorado River basin states are among the fastest-growing in the U.S.; the population of Nevada alone increased by about 66 percent between 1990 and 2000 as Arizona grew by some 40 percent.

The Colorado River basin shares drainage boundaries with many other major watersheds of North America. The Continental Divide of the Americas forms a large portion of the eastern boundary of the watershed, separating it from the basins of the <a href="Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone River</a> and the <a href="Platte%20River">Platte River</a> – both tributaries of the <a href="Missouri%20River">Missouri River</a> – on the northeast, and from the headwaters of the <a href="Arkansas%20River">Arkansas River</a> on the east. Both the Missouri and Arkansas rivers are part of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> system. Further south, the Colorado River basin borders on the <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a> drainage, which along with the Mississippi flows to the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, as well as a series of <a href="endorheic%20basin">endorheic</a> (closed) drainage basins in southwestern New Mexico and extreme southeastern Arizona.

For a short stretch, the Colorado watershed meets the drainage basin of the <a href="Snake%20River">Snake River</a>, a tributary of the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>, in the Wind River Range of western Wyoming. Southwest of there, the northern divide of the Colorado watershed skirts the edge of the <a href="Great%20Basin">Great Basin</a>, bordering on the closed drainage basins of the <a href="Great%20Salt%20Lake">Great Salt Lake</a> and the <a href="Sevier%20River">Sevier River</a> in central Utah, and other closed basins in southern Utah and Nevada. To the west in California, the Colorado River watershed borders on those of small closed basins in the Mojave Desert, the largest of which is the <a href="Salton%20Sea">Salton Sea</a> drainage north of the Colorado River Delta. On the south, the watersheds of the <a href="Sonoyta%20River">Sonoyta</a>, <a href="Concepci%C3%B3n%20River">Concepción</a>, and <a href="Yaqui%20River">Yaqui</a> rivers, all of which drain to the Gulf of California, border that of the Colorado.

As recently as the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> period about 100 million years ago, much of western North America was still part of the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. Tectonic forces from the collision of the <a href="Farallon%20Plate">Farallon Plate</a> with the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American Plate</a> pushed up the Rocky Mountains between 50 and 75 million years ago in a mountain-building episode known as the <a href="Laramide%20orogeny">Laramide orogeny</a>. The Colorado River first formed as a west-flowing stream draining the southwestern portion of the range, and the uplift also diverted the Green River, once a tributary of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>, west towards the Colorado. About 30 to 20 million years ago, volcanic activity related to the orogeny led to the <a href="Mid-Tertiary%20ignimbrite%20flare-up">Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up</a>, which created smaller formations such as the <a href="Chiricahua%20Mountains">Chiricahua Mountains</a> in Arizona and deposited massive amounts of volcanic ash and debris over the watershed. The Colorado Plateau first began to rise during the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>, between about 55 and 34 million years ago, but did not attain its present height until about 5 million years ago, about when the Colorado River established its present course into the Gulf of California.

The time scale and sequence over which the river's present course and the Grand Canyon were formed is uncertain. Before the Gulf of California was formed around 12 to 5 million years ago by faulting processes along the boundary of the North American and <a href="Pacific%20Plate">Pacific</a> plates, the Colorado flowed west to an outlet on the Pacific Ocean – possibly <a href="Monterey%20Bay">Monterey Bay</a> on the Central California coast, and may have played a role in the formation of the <a href="Monterey%20Canyon">Monterey submarine canyon</a>. Crustal extension in the <a href="Basin%20and%20Range%20Province">Basin and Range Province</a> began about 20 million years ago and the modern <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a> began forming about 10 million years ago, eventually diverting the Colorado southwards towards the Gulf. As the Colorado Plateau continued to rise between 5 and 2.5 million years ago, the river maintained its ancestral course (as an <a href="antecedent%20stream">antecedent stream</a>) and began to cut the Grand Canyon. Antecedence played a major part in shaping other peculiar geographic features in the watershed, including the Dolores River's bisection of <a href="Paradox%20Valley">Paradox Valley</a> in Colorado and the Green River's cut through the Uinta Mountains in Utah.
Sediments carried from the plateau by the Colorado River created a vast delta made of more than of material that walled off the northernmost part of the gulf in approximately 1 million years. Cut off from the ocean, the portion of the gulf north of the delta eventually evaporated and formed the <a href="Salton%20Sink">Salton Sink</a>, which reached about below sea level. Since then the river has changed course into the Salton Sink at least three times, transforming it into <a href="Lake%20Cahuilla">Lake Cahuilla</a>, which at maximum size flooded up the valley to present-day <a href="Indio%2C%20California">Indio, California</a>. The lake took about 50 years to evaporate after the Colorado resumed flowing to the Gulf. The present-day Salton Sea can be considered the most recent incarnation of Lake Cahuilla, though on a much smaller scale.

Between 1.8 million and 10,000 years ago, massive flows of <a href="basalt">basalt</a> from the <a href="Uinkaret%20volcanic%20field">Uinkaret volcanic field</a> in northern Arizona dammed the Colorado River within the Grand Canyon. At least 13 <a href="lava%20dam">lava dam</a>s were formed, the largest of which was more than high, backing the river up for nearly to present-day Moab, Utah. The lack of associated sediment deposits along this stretch of the Colorado River, which would have accumulated in the impounded lakes over time, suggests that most of these dams did not survive for more than a few decades before collapsing or being washed away. Failure of the lava dams caused by erosion, leaks and <a href="cavitation">cavitation</a> caused catastrophic floods, which may have been some of the largest ever to occur in North America, rivaling the late-<a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> <a href="Missoula%20Floods">Missoula Floods</a> of the northwestern United States. Mapping of flood deposits indicate that crests as high as passed through the Grand Canyon, reaching peak discharges as great as .

The first humans of the Colorado River basin were likely <a href="Paleo-Indian">Paleo-Indian</a>s of the <a href="Clovis%20culture">Clovis</a> and <a href="Folsom%20Complex">Folsom</a> cultures, who first arrived on the Colorado Plateau about 12,000 years ago. Very little human activity occurred in the watershed until the rise of the <a href="Desert%20Archaic%20Culture">Desert Archaic Culture</a>, which from 8,000 to 2,000 years ago constituted most of the region's human population. These prehistoric inhabitants led a generally nomadic lifestyle, gathering plants and hunting small animals (though some of the earliest peoples hunted larger mammals that became extinct in North America after the end of the Pleistocene epoch). Another notable early group was the <a href="Fremont%20culture">Fremont culture</a>, whose peoples inhabited the Colorado Plateau from 2,000 to 700 years ago. The Fremont were likely the first peoples of the Colorado River basin to domesticate crops and construct masonry dwellings; they also left behind a large amount of rock art and <a href="petroglyph">petroglyph</a>s, many of which have survived to the present day.

Beginning in the early centuries A.D., Colorado River basin peoples began to form large agriculture-based societies, some of which lasted hundreds of years and grew into well-organized civilizations encompassing tens of thousands of inhabitants. The <a href="Ancient%20Puebloan">Ancient Puebloan</a> (also known as <a href="Anasazi">Anasazi</a> or Hisatsinom) people of the Four Corners region were descended from the Desert Archaic culture. The Puebloan people developed a complex distribution system to supply drinking and irrigation water in <a href="Chaco%20Culture%20National%20Historical%20Park">Chaco Canyon</a> in northwestern New Mexico.

The Puebloans dominated the basin of the San Juan River, and the center of their civilization was in Chaco Canyon. In Chaco Canyon and the surrounding lands, they built more than 150 multi-story pueblos or "great houses", the largest of which, <a href="Pueblo%20Bonito">Pueblo Bonito</a>, is composed of more than 600 rooms. The <a href="Hohokam">Hohokam</a> culture was present along the middle Gila River beginning around 1 A.D. Between 600 and 700 A.D. they began to employ irrigation on a large scale, and did so more prolifically than any other native group in the Colorado River basin. An extensive system of irrigation canals was constructed on the Gila and <a href="Salt%20River%20%28Arizona%29">Salt</a> rivers, with various estimates of a total length ranging from and capable of irrigating . Both civilizations supported large populations at their height; the Chaco Canyon Puebloans numbered between 6,000 and 15,000 and estimates for the Hohokam range between 30,000 and 200,000.

These sedentary peoples heavily exploited their surroundings, practicing logging and harvesting of other resources on a large scale. The construction of irrigation canals may have led to a significant change in the morphology of many waterways in the Colorado River basin. Prior to human contact, rivers such as the Gila, Salt and <a href="Chaco%20Wash">Chaco</a> were shallow perennial streams with low, vegetated banks and large <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>s. In time, <a href="flash%20flood">flash flood</a>s caused significant downcutting on irrigation canals, which in turn led to the entrenchment of the original streams into <a href="Arroyo%20%28creek%29">arroyos</a>, making agriculture difficult. A variety of methods were employed to combat these problems, including the construction of large dams, but when a megadrought hit the region in the 14th century A.D. the ancient civilizations of the Colorado River basin abruptly collapsed. Some Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley of central New Mexico and south-central Colorado, becoming the predecessors of the <a href="Hopi">Hopi</a>, <a href="Zuni%20people">Zuni</a>, <a href="Laguna%20people">Laguna</a> and <a href="Acoma%20people">Acoma</a> people in western New Mexico. Many of the tribes that inhabited the Colorado River basin at the time of European contact were descended from Puebloan and Hohokam survivors, while others already had a long history of living in the region or migrated in from bordering lands.

The <a href="Navajo%20people">Navajo</a> were an <a href="Athabaskan%20languages">Athabaskan</a> people who migrated from the north into the Colorado River basin around 1025 A.D. They soon established themselves as the dominant Native American tribe in the Colorado River basin, and their territory stretched over parts of present-day Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado – in the original homelands of the Puebloans. In fact, the Navajo acquired agricultural skills from the Puebloans before the collapse of the Pueblo civilization in the 14th century. A profusion of other tribes have made a continued, lasting presence along the Colorado River. The <a href="Mohave%20people">Mohave</a> have lived along the rich bottomlands of the lower Colorado below Black Canyon since 1200 A.D. They were fishermen – navigating the river on rafts made of reeds to catch <a href="Gila%20trout">Gila trout</a> and <a href="Colorado%20pikeminnow">Colorado pikeminnow</a> – and farmers, relying on the annual floods of the river rather than irrigation to water their crops. <a href="Ute%20people">Ute people</a>s have inhabited the northern Colorado River basin, mainly in present-day Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, for at least 2,000 years, but did not become well established in the Four Corners area until 1500 A.D. The <a href="Apache%20people">Apache</a>, <a href="Cocopah">Cocopah</a>, <a href="Halchidhoma">Halchidhoma</a>, <a href="Havasupai%20people">Havasupai</a>, <a href="Hualapai%20people">Hualapai</a>, <a href="Maricopa%20people">Maricopa</a>, <a href="Pima%20people">Pima</a>, and <a href="Quechan">Quechan</a> are among many other groups that live along or had territories bordering on the Colorado River and its tributaries.

Beginning in the 17th century, contact with Europeans brought significant changes to the lifestyles of Native Americans in the Colorado River basin. Missionaries sought to convert indigenous peoples to Christianity – an effort sometimes successful, such as in <a href="Eusebio%20Kino">Father Eusebio Francisco Kino</a>'s 1694 encounter with the "docile Pimas of the Gila Valley [who] readily accepted Kino and his Christian teachings". From 1694 to 1702 Kino would explore the Gila and Colorado Rivers to determine if California was an island or peninsula. The Spanish introduced sheep and goats to the Navajo, who came to rely heavily on them for meat, milk and wool. By the mid-16th century, the Utes, having acquired horses from the Spanish, introduced them to the Colorado River basin. The use of horses spread through the basin via trade between the various tribes and greatly facilitated hunting, communications and travel for indigenous peoples. More warlike groups such as the Utes and Navajos often used horses to their advantage in raids against tribes that were slower to adopt them, such as the <a href="Goshute">Goshute</a>s and <a href="Southern%20Paiute">Southern Paiute</a>s.
The gradual influx of European and American explorers, fortune seekers and settlers into the region eventually led to conflicts that forced many Native Americans off their traditional lands. After the acquisition of the Colorado River basin from Mexico in the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a> in 1846, U.S. military forces commanded by <a href="Kit%20Carson">Kit Carson</a> forced more than 8,000 Navajo men, women and children from their homes after a series of unsuccessful attempts to confine their territory, many of which were met with violent resistance. In what is now known as the Long Walk of the Navajo, the captives were marched from Arizona to <a href="Fort%20Sumner">Fort Sumner</a> in New Mexico, and many died along the route. Four years later, the Navajo signed a treaty that moved them onto a reservation in the Four Corners region that is now known as the <a href="Navajo%20Nation">Navajo Nation</a>. It is the largest Native American reservation in the United States, encompassing with a population of over 180,000 as of 2000.

The Mohave were expelled from their territory after a series of minor skirmishes and raids on <a href="wagon%20train">wagon train</a>s passing through the area in the late 1850s, culminating in an 1859 battle with American forces that concluded the <a href="Mohave%20War">Mohave War</a>. In 1870, the Mohave were relocated to a <a href="Fort%20Mojave%20Indian%20Reservation">reservation at Fort Mojave</a>, which spans the borders of Arizona, California and Nevada. Some Mohave were also moved to the <a href="Colorado%20River%20Indian%20Reservation">Colorado River Indian Reservation</a> on the Arizona–California border, originally established for the Mohave and <a href="Chemehuevi">Chemehuevi</a> people in 1865. In the 1940s, some Hopi and Navajo people were also relocated to this reservation. The four tribes now form a geopolitical body known as the <a href="Colorado%20River%20Indian%20Tribes">Colorado River Indian Tribes</a>.

Water rights of Native Americans in the Colorado River basin were largely ignored during the extensive water resources development carried out on the river and its tributaries in the 19th and 20th centuries. The construction of dams has often had negative impacts on tribal peoples, such as the Chemehuevi when their riverside lands were flooded after the completion of <a href="Parker%20Dam">Parker Dam</a> in 1938. Ten Native American tribes in the basin now hold or continue to claim water rights to the Colorado River. The U.S. government has taken some actions to help quantify and develop the water resources of Native American reservations. The first federally funded irrigation project in the U.S. was the construction of an irrigation canal on the Colorado River Indian Reservation in 1867. Other water projects include the <a href="Navajo%20Indian%20Irrigation%20Project">Navajo Indian Irrigation Project</a>, authorized in 1962 for the irrigation of lands in part of the Navajo Nation in north-central New Mexico. The Navajo continue to seek expansion of their water rights because of difficulties with the water supply on their reservation; about 40 percent of its inhabitants must haul water by truck many miles to their homes. In the 21st century, they have filed legal claims against the governments of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah for increased water rights. Some of these claims have been successful for the Navajo, such as a 2004 settlement in which they received a allotment from New Mexico.

During the 16th century, the Spanish began to explore and colonize western North America. An early motive was the search for the <a href="Seven%20Cities%20of%20Gold">Seven Cities of Gold</a>, or "Cibola", rumored to have been built by Native Americans somewhere in the desert Southwest. According to a <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> publication, it is likely that <a href="Francisco%20de%20Ulloa">Francisco de Ulloa</a> was the first European to see the Colorado River when in 1536 he sailed to the head of the Gulf of California. <a href="Francisco%20V%C3%A1squez%20de%20Coronado">Francisco Vásquez de Coronado</a>'s 1540–1542 expedition began as a search for the fabled Cities of Gold, but after learning from natives in New Mexico of a large river to the west, he sent <a href="Garc%C3%ADa%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20C%C3%A1rdenas">García López de Cárdenas</a> to lead a small contingent to find it. With the guidance of Hopi Indians, Cárdenas and his men became the first outsiders to see the Grand Canyon. Cárdenas was reportedly unimpressed with the canyon, assuming the width of the Colorado River at and estimating -tall rock formations to be the size of a man. After failing at an attempt to descend to the river, they left the area, defeated by the difficult terrain and torrid weather.
In 1540, <a href="Hernando%20de%20Alarc%C3%B3n">Hernando de Alarcón</a> and his fleet reached the mouth of the river, intending to provide additional supplies to Coronado's expedition. Alarcón may have sailed the Colorado as far upstream as the present-day California–Arizona border. Coronado never reached the Gulf of California, and Alarcón eventually gave up and left. <a href="Melchior%20D%C3%ADaz">Melchior Díaz</a> reached the delta in the same year, intending to establish contact with Alarcón, but the latter was already gone by the time of Díaz's arrival. Díaz named the Colorado River "Rio del Tizon" ("Firebrand River") after seeing a practice used by the local natives for warming themselves. The name "Tizon" lasted for the next 200 years. The name "Rio Colorado" ("Red River") was first applied to the Colorado by <a href="Eusebio%20Kino">Father Eusebio Francisco Kino</a> in his maps and written reports resulting from his explorations to the Colorado River Delta and his discovery that California was not an island but a peninsula (1700-1702). Kino's 1701 map, "Paso por Tierra a la California," is the first known map to label the river as the Colorado.

During the 18th and early 19th centuries, many Americans and Spanish believed in the existence of the <a href="Buenaventura%20River%20%28legend%29">Buenaventura River</a>, purported to run from the Rocky Mountains in Utah or Colorado to the Pacific Ocean. The name "Buenaventura" was given to the Green River by <a href="Silvestre%20V%C3%A9lez%20de%20Escalante">Silvestre Vélez de Escalante</a> as early as 1776, but Escalante did not know that the Green drained to the Colorado. Many later maps showed the headwaters of the Green and Colorado rivers connecting with the Sevier River (Rio San Ysabel) and <a href="Utah%20Lake">Utah Lake</a> (Lake Timpanogos) before flowing west through the Sierra Nevada into California. Mountain man <a href="Jedediah%20Smith">Jedediah Smith</a> reached the lower Colorado by way of the Virgin River canyon in 1826. Smith called the Colorado the "Seedskeedee", as the Green River in Wyoming was known to fur trappers, correctly believing it to be a continuation of the Green and not a separate river as others believed under the Buenaventura myth. <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont</a>'s 1843 Great Basin expedition proved that no river traversed the Great Basin and Sierra Nevada, officially debunking the Buenaventura myth.

Between 1850 and 1854 the U. S. Army explored the lower reach of the Colorado River from the Gulf of California, looking for the river to provide a less expensive route to supply the remote post of Fort Yuma. First in November 1850 to January 1851, by its transport <a href="schooner">schooner</a>, <a href="Invincible%20%28schooner%29">"Invincible"</a> under Captain <a href="Alfred%20Henry%20Wilcox">Alfred H. Wilcox</a> and then by its longboat commanded by Lieutenant <a href="George%20Derby">George Derby</a>. Later Lieutenant Derby, in his expedition report, recommended that a shallow draft sternwheel <a href="steamboat">steamboat</a> would be the way to send supplies up river to the fort. 

The next contractors <a href="George%20Alonzo%20Johnson">George Alonzo Johnson</a> with his partner <a href="Benjamin%20M.%20Hartshorne">Benjamin M. Hartshorne</a>, brought two barges and 250 tons of supplies arriving at the river's mouth in February 1852, on the United States transport schooner "<a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28schooner%29">Sierra Nevada</a>" under Captain Wilcox. Poling the barges up the Colorado, the first barge sank with its cargo a total loss. The second was finally, after a long struggle poled up to Fort Yuma, but what little it carried was soon consumed by the garrison. Subsequently, wagons again were sent from the fort to haul the balance of the supplies overland from the estuary through the marshes and woodlands of the Delta. 

At last Derby's recommendation was heeded and in November 1852, the <a href="Uncle%20Sam%20%28sidewheeler%201852%29">"Uncle Sam"</a>, a 65-foot long side-wheel <a href="paddle%20steamer">paddle steamer</a>, built by <a href="Domingo%20Marcucci">Domingo Marcucci</a>, became the first steamboat on the Colorado River. It was brought by the schooner <a href="Capacity%20%28schooner%29">"Capacity"</a> from <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> to the delta by the next contractor to supply the fort, Captain <a href="James%20Turnbull%20%28steamboat%20captain%29">James Turnbull</a>. It was assembled and launched in the estuary, 30 miles above the mouth of the Colorado River. Equipped with only a 20-horsepower engine, the "Uncle Sam" could only carry 35 tons of supplies, taking 15 days to make the first 120-mile trip. It made many trips up and down the river, taking four months to finish carrying the supplies for the fort, improving its time up river to 12 days. Negligence caused it to sink at its dock below Fort Yuma, and was then washed away before it could be raised, in the spring flood of 1853. Turnbull in financial difficulty, disappeared. Nevertheless, he had shown the worth of steamboats to solve Fort Yuma's supply problem. 

George Alonzo Johnson with his partner Hartshorne and a new partner Captain Alfred H. Wilcox (formerly of the "Invincible" and "Sierra Nevada"), formed <a href="George%20A.%20Johnson%20%26amp%3B%20Company">George A. Johnson & Company</a> and obtained the next contract to supply the fort. Johnson and his partners, all having learned lessons from their failed attempts ascending the Colorado and with the example of the "Uncle Sam", brought the parts of a more powerful side-wheel steamboat, the <a href="General%20Jesup%20%28sidewheeler%29">"General Jesup"</a>, with them to the mouth of the Colorado from San Francisco. There it was reassembled at a landing in the upper tidewater of the river and reached Fort Yuma, January 18, 1854. This new boat, capable of carrying 50 tons of cargo, was very successful making round trips from the estuary to the fort in only four or five days. Costs were cut from $200 to $75 per ton. 

<a href="Lorenzo%20Sitgreaves">Lorenzo Sitgreaves</a> led the first <a href="Corps%20of%20Topographical%20Engineers">Corps of Topographical Engineers</a> mission across northern Arizona to the Colorado River (near modern <a href="Bullhead%20City%2C%20Arizona">Bullhead City, Arizona</a>), and down its east bank to the river crossings of the <a href="Southern%20Immigrant%20Trail">Southern Immigrant Trail</a> at <a href="Fort%20Yuma">Fort Yuma</a> in 1851.

The second Corps of Topographical Engineers expedition passed along and crossed the Colorado was the 1853-1854 <a href="Pacific%20Railroad%20Survey">Pacific Railroad Survey</a> expedition along the 35th parallel north from <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> to <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, led by Lt. <a href="Amiel%20Weeks%20Whipple">Amiel Weeks Whipple</a>.

George A. Johnson was instrumental in getting the support for Congressional funding a military expedition up the river. With those funds Johnson expected to provide the transportation for the expedition but was angry and disappointed when the commander of the expedition Lt. <a href="Joseph%20Christmas%20Ives">Joseph Christmas Ives</a> rejected his offer of one of his steamboats. Before Ives could finish reassembling his steamer in the delta, George A. Johnson set off from Fort Yuma on December 31, 1857, conducting his own exploration of the river above the fort in his steamboat <a href="General%20Jesup%20%28sidewheeler%29">"General Jesup"</a>. He ascended the river in twenty one days as far as the first rapids in <a href="Pyramid%20Canyon">Pyramid Canyon</a>, over above Fort Yuma and above the modern site of <a href="Davis%20Dam">Davis Dam</a>. Running low on food he turned back. As he returned he encountered Lieutenant Ives, Whipple's assistant, who was leading an expedition to explore the feasibility of using the Colorado River as a navigation route in the Southwest. Ives and his men used a specially built steamboat, the shallow-draft <a href="Explorer%20%28sternwheeler%29">U.S.S. "Explorer"</a>, and traveled up the river as far as Black Canyon. He then took a small boat up beyond the canyon to <a href="Fortification%20Rock">Fortification Rock</a> and <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Wash">Las Vegas Wash</a>. After experiencing numerous groundings and accidents and having been inhibited by low water in the river, Ives declared: "Ours has been the first, and will doubtless be the last, party of whites to visit this profitless locality. It seems intended by nature that the Colorado River, along the greater portion of its lonely and majestic way, shall be forever unvisited and undisturbed."

Until 1866, <a href="El%20Dorado%20Canyon%20%28Nevada%29">El Dorado Canyon</a> was the actual head of navigation on the Colorado River. In that year Captain <a href="Robert%20T.%20Rogers">Robert T. Rogers</a>, commanding the steamer <a href="Esmerelda%20%28sternwheeler%29">"Esmeralda"</a> with a barge and ninety tons of freight, reached <a href="Callville%2C%20Nevada">Callville, Nevada</a>, on October 8, 1866. Callville remained the head of navigation on the river until July 7, 1879, when Captain <a href="J.%20A.%20Mellon">J. A. Mellon</a> in the <a href="Gila%20%28sternwheeler%29">"Gila"</a> left El Dorado Canyon landing, steamed up through the rapids in Black Canyon, making record time to Callville and tied up overnight. Next morning he to steamed up through the rapids in <a href="Boulder%20Canyon%20%28Colorado%20River%29">Boulder Canyon</a> to reach the mouth of the Virgin River at <a href="Rioville%2C%20Nevada">Rioville</a> July 8, 1879. From 1879 to 1887, Rioville, Nevada was the high water Head of Navigation for the steamboats and the mining company <a href="sloop">sloop</a> <a href="Sou%27Wester%20%28sloop%29">Sou'Wester</a> that carried the <a href="salt">salt</a> needed for the reduction of <a href="silver">silver</a> ore from there to the mills at El Dorado Canyon.

Up until the mid-19th century, long stretches of the Colorado and Green rivers between Wyoming and Nevada remained largely unexplored due to their remote location and dangers of navigation. Because of the dramatic drop in elevation of the two rivers, there were rumors of huge waterfalls and violent rapids, and Native American tales strengthened their credibility. In 1869, one-armed Civil War veteran <a href="John%20Wesley%20Powell">John Wesley Powell</a> led <a href="Powell%20Geographic%20Expedition%20of%201869">an expedition</a> from <a href="Green%20River%2C%20Wyoming">Green River Station</a> in Wyoming, aiming to run the two rivers all the way down to <a href="St.%20Thomas%2C%20Nevada">St. Thomas, Nevada</a>, near present-day Hoover Dam. Powell and nine men – none of whom had prior whitewater experience – set out in May. After braving the rapids of the <a href="Gates%20of%20Lodore">Gates of Lodore</a>, Cataract Canyon and other gorges along the Colorado, the party arrived at the mouth of the Little Colorado River, where Powell noted down arguably the most famous words ever written about the Grand Canyon of the Colorado:

On August 28, 1869, three men deserted the expedition, convinced that they could not possibly survive the trip through the Grand Canyon. They were killed by Native Americans after making it to the rim of the canyon; two days later, the expedition ran the last of the Grand Canyon rapids and reached St. Thomas. Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In what is perhaps a twist of irony, modern-day Lake Powell, which floods Glen Canyon, is also named for their leader.

Starting in the latter half of the 19th century, the lower Colorado below Black Canyon became an important <a href="Steamboats%20of%20the%20Colorado%20River">waterway for steamboat commerce</a>. In 1852, the <a href="Uncle%20Sam%20%28sidewheeler%201852%29">"Uncle Sam"</a> was launched to provide supplies to the <a href="U.S.%20Army">U.S. Army</a> outpost at <a href="Fort%20Yuma">Fort Yuma</a>. Although this vessel accidentally foundered and sank early in its career, commercial traffic quickly proliferated because river transport was much cheaper than hauling freight over land. Navigation on the Colorado River was dangerous because of the shallow channel and flow variations, so the first sternwheeler on the river, the "Colorado" of 1855, was designed to carry while drawing less than of water. The <a href="tidal%20bore">tidal bore</a> of the lower Colorado also presented a major hazard; in 1922, a -high wave swamped a ship bound for Yuma, killing between 86 and 130 people. Steamboats quickly became the principal source of communication and trade along the river until competition from railroads began in the 1870s, and finally the construction of dams along the lower river in 1909, none of which had locks to allow the passage of ships.
During the <a href="Manifest%20Destiny">Manifest Destiny</a> era of the mid-19th century, American pioneers settled many western states but generally avoided the Colorado River basin until the 1850s. Under <a href="Brigham%20Young">Brigham Young</a>'s grand vision for a "vast empire in the desert", (the <a href="State%20of%20Deseret">State of Deseret</a>) <a href="Mormon">Mormon</a> settlers were among the first whites to establish a permanent presence in the watershed, <a href="Santa%20Clara%2C%20Utah">Fort Clara or Fort Santa Clara</a>, in the winter of 1855-1856 along the <a href="Santa%20Clara%20River%20%28Utah%29">Santa Clara River</a>, tributary of the Virgin River. In the lower Colorado mining was the primary spur to economic development, copper mining in southwestern New Mexico Territory the 1850s then the <a href="Steamboats%20of%20the%20Colorado%20River%23Mohave%20War%20and%20the%20first%20gold%20rush%20on%20the%20Colorado">Mohave War and a gold rush on the Gila River</a> in 1859, the <a href="Steamboats%20of%20the%20Colorado%20River%23El%20Dorado%20Canyon%20Rush">El Dorado Canyon Rush</a> in 1860 and <a href="Steamboats%20of%20the%20Colorado%20River%23Colorado%20River%20Gold%20Rush">Colorado River Gold Rush</a> in 1862.

In 1860, anticipating the American Civil War, the Mormons established a number of settlements to grow cotton along the Virgin River in <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20Utah">Washington County, Utah</a>. From 1863 to 1865, Mormon colonists founded <a href="St.%20Thomas%2C%20Nevada">St. Thomas</a> and other colonies on the <a href="Muddy%20River%20%28Nevada%29">Muddy</a> and Virgin rivers in northwestern <a href="Arizona%20Territory">Arizona Territory</a>, (now <a href="Clark%20County%2C%20Nevada">Clark County, Nevada</a>). <a href="Stone%27s%20Ferry%2C%20Nevada">Stone's Ferry</a> was established by these colonists on the Colorado at the mouth of the Virgin River to carry their produce on a wagon road to the mining districts of <a href="Mohave%20County%2C%20Arizona">Mohave County, Arizona</a> to the south. Also, in 1866, a <a href="steamboat">steamboat</a> landing was established at <a href="Callville%2C%20Nevada">Callville</a>, intended as an outlet to the Pacific Ocean via the Colorado River, for Mormon settlements in the Great Basin. These settlements reached a peak population of about 600 before being abandoned in 1871, and for nearly a decade these valleys became a haven for outlaws and cattle rustlers. One Mormon settler <a href="Daniel%20Bonelli">Daniel Bonelli</a>, remained, operating the ferry and began mining salt in nearby mines, bring it in barges, down river to El Dorado Canyon where it was used to process silver ore. From 1879 to 1887, <a href="Colorado%20Steam%20Navigation%20Company">Colorado Steam Navigation Company</a> steamboats carried the salt, operating up river in the high spring flood waters, through <a href="Boulder%20Canyon%20%28Colorado%20River%29">Boulder Canyon</a>, to the landing at <a href="Rioville%2C%20Nevada">Rioville</a> at the mouth of the Virgin River. From 1879 to 1882 the Southwestern Mining Company, largest in El Dorado Canyon, brought in a 56-foot <a href="sloop">sloop</a> the <a href="Sou%27Wester%20%28sloop%29">Sou'Wester</a> that sailed up and down river carrying the salt in the low water time of year until it was wrecked in the Quick and Dirty Rapids of Black Canyon.
Mormons founded settlements along the <a href="Duchesne%20River">Duchesne River</a> Valley in the 1870s, and populated the Little Colorado River valley later in the century, settling in towns such as <a href="St.%20Johns%2C%20Arizona">St. Johns, Arizona</a>. They also established settlements along the Gila River in central Arizona beginning in 1871. These early settlers were impressed by the extensive ruins of the Hohokam civilization that previously occupied the Gila River valley, and are said to have "envisioned their new agricultural civilization rising as the mythical "phoenix" bird from the ashes of Hohokam society". The Mormons were the first whites to develop the water resources of the basin on a large scale, and built complex networks of dams and canals to irrigate wheat, oats and barley in addition to establishing extensive sheep and cattle ranches.

One of the main reasons the Mormons were able to colonize Arizona was the existence of <a href="Jacob%20Hamblin">Jacob Hamblin</a>'s ferry across the Colorado at <a href="Lee%27s%20Ferry">Lee's Ferry</a> (then known as Pahreah Crossing), which began running in March 1864. This location was the only section of river for hundreds of miles in both directions where the canyon walls dropped away, allowing for the development of a transport route. <a href="John%20Doyle%20Lee">John Doyle Lee</a> established a more permanent ferry system at the site in 1870. One reason Lee chose to run the ferry was to flee from Mormon leaders who held him responsible for the <a href="Mountain%20Meadows%20Massacre">Mountain Meadows Massacre</a>, in which 120 emigrants in a wagon train were killed by <a href="Nauvoo%20Legion">a local militia</a> disguised as Native Americans. Even though it was located along a major travel route, Lee's Ferry was very isolated, and there Lee and his family established the aptly named <a href="Lonely%20Dell%20Ranch%20Historic%20District">Lonely Dell Ranch</a>. In 1928, the ferry sank, resulting in the deaths of three men. Later that year, the Navajo Bridge was completed at a point downstream, rendering the ferry obsolete.

Gold strikes from the mid-19th to early 20th centuries played a major role in attracting settlers to the upper Colorado River basin. In 1859, a group of adventurers from Georgia discovered gold along the Blue River in Colorado and established the mining boomtown of <a href="Breckenridge%2C%20Colorado">Breckenridge</a>. During 1875, even bigger strikes were made along the <a href="Uncompahgre%20River">Uncompahgre</a> and <a href="San%20Miguel%20River%20%28Colorado%29">San Miguel</a> rivers, also in Colorado, and these led to the creation of <a href="Ouray%2C%20Colorado">Ouray</a> and <a href="Telluride%2C%20Colorado">Telluride</a>, respectively. Because most gold deposits along the upper Colorado River and its tributaries occur in <a href="lode">lode</a> deposits, extensive mining systems and heavy machinery were required to extract them. Mining remains a substantial contributor to the economy of the upper basin and has led to <a href="acid%20mine%20drainage">acid mine drainage</a> problems in some regional streams and rivers.

Prior to 1921, the upper Colorado River above the confluence with the Green River in Utah had assumed various names. Fathers Dominguez and Escalante named it Rio San Rafael in 1776. Through the mid-1800s, the river between Green River and the Gunnison River was most commonly known as the Grand River. The river above the junction with the Gunnison River, however, was known variously as the Bunkara River, the North Fork of the Grand River, the Blue River, and the Grand River. The latter name did not become consistently applied until the 1870s.

In 1921, U.S. Representative <a href="Edward%20T.%20Taylor">Edward T. Taylor</a> of Colorado petitioned the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Energy%20and%20Commerce">Congressional Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce</a> to rename the Grand River as the Colorado River. Taylor saw the fact that the Colorado River started outside the border of his state as an "abomination". On July 25, the name change was made official in House Joint Resolution 460 of the <a href="66th%20United%20States%20Congress">66th Congress</a>, over the objections of representatives from Wyoming, Utah, and the USGS, which noted that the Green River was much longer and had a larger drainage basin above its confluence with the Grand River, although the Grand contributed a greater flow of water.

Today, between 36 and 40 million people depend on the Colorado River's water for agricultural, industrial and domestic needs. <a href="Southern%20Nevada%20Water%20Authority">Southern Nevada Water Authority</a> called the Colorado River one of the "most controlled, controversial and litigated rivers in the world". Over 29 major dams and hundreds of miles of canals serve to supply thirsty cities, provide irrigation water to some 4 million acres (1.6 million hectares), and meet <a href="peaking%20power">peaking power</a> demands in the Southwest, generating more than 12 billion <a href="Kilowatt%20hour">kWh</a> of hydroelectricity each year. Often called "America's <a href="Nile">Nile</a>", the Colorado is so carefully managed – with basin reservoirs capable of holding four times the river's annual flow – that each drop of its water is used an average of 17 times in a single year.

One of the earliest water projects in the Colorado River basin was the <a href="Grand%20Ditch">Grand Ditch</a>, a diversion canal that sends water from the <a href="Never%20Summer%20Mountains">Never Summer Mountains</a>, which would naturally have drained into the headwaters of the Colorado River, to bolster supplies in Colorado's <a href="Front%20Range%20Urban%20Corridor">Front Range Urban Corridor</a>. Constructed primarily by Japanese and Mexican laborers, the ditch was considered an engineering marvel when completed in 1890, delivering across the Continental Divide each year. Because roughly 75 percent of Colorado's precipitation falls west of the Rocky Mountains while 80 percent of the population lives east of the range, more of these <a href="interbasin%20water%20transfer">interbasin water transfer</a>s, locally known as transmountain diversions, followed. While first envisioned in the late 19th century, construction on the <a href="Colorado-Big%20Thompson%20Project">Colorado-Big Thompson Project</a> (C-BT) did not begin until the 1930s. The C-BT now delivers more than 11 times the Grand Ditch's flow from the Colorado River watershed to cities along the Front Range.

Meanwhile, large-scale development was also beginning on the opposite end of the Colorado River. In 1900, entrepreneurs of the <a href="California%20Development%20Company">California Development Company</a> (CDC) looked to the Imperial Valley of southern California as an excellent location to develop agriculture irrigated by the waters of the river. Engineer <a href="George%20Chaffey">George Chaffey</a> was hired to design the <a href="Alamo%20Canal">Alamo Canal</a>, which split off from the Colorado River near <a href="Pilot%20Knob%20%28Imperial%20County%2C%20California%29">Pilot Knob</a>, curved south into Mexico, and dumped into the <a href="Alamo%20River">Alamo River</a>, a dry arroyo which had historically carried flood flows of the Colorado into the Salton Sink. With a stable year-round flow in the Alamo River, irrigators in the Imperial Valley were able to begin large-scale farming, and small towns in the region started to expand with the influx of job-seeking migrants. By 1903, more than in the valley were under cultivation, supporting a growing population of 4,000.

It was not long before the Colorado River began to wreak havoc with its erratic flows. In autumn, the river would drop below the level of the canal inlet, and temporary brush diversion dams had to be constructed. In early 1905, heavy floods destroyed the headworks of the canal, and water began to flow uncontrolled down the canal towards the Salton Sink. On August 9, the entire flow of the Colorado swerved into the canal and began to flood the bottom of the Imperial Valley. In a desperate gamble to close the breach, crews of the <a href="Southern%20Pacific%20Railroad">Southern Pacific Railroad</a>, whose tracks ran through the valley, attempted to dam the Colorado above the canal, only to see their work demolished by a flash flood. It took seven attempts, more than $3 million, and two years for the railroad, the CDC, and the federal government to permanently block the breach and send the Colorado on its natural course to the gulf – but not before part of the Imperial Valley was flooded under a lake, today's <a href="Salton%20Sea">Salton Sea</a>. After the immediate flooding threat passed, it was realized that a more permanent solution would be needed to rein in the Colorado.

In 1922, six U.S. states in the Colorado River basin signed the <a href="Colorado%20River%20Compact">Colorado River Compact</a>, which divided half of the river's flow to both the Upper Basin (the drainage area above Lee's Ferry, comprising parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming and a small portion of Arizona) and the Lower Basin (Arizona, California, Nevada, and parts of New Mexico and Utah). Each was given rights to of water per year, a figure believed to represent half of the river's minimum flow at Lee's Ferry. This was followed by a U.S.–Mexico treaty in 1944, allocating of Colorado River water to the latter country per annum. Arizona refused to ratify the Colorado River Compact in 1922 because it feared that California would take too much of the lower basin allotment; in 1944 a compromise was reached in which Arizona would get a firm allocation of , but only if California's allocation was prioritized during drought years. These and nine other decisions, compacts, federal acts and agreements made between 1922 and 1973 form what is now known as the Law of the River.
On September 30, 1935, the <a href="United%20States%20Bureau%20of%20Reclamation">United States Bureau of Reclamation</a> (USBR) completed Hoover Dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River. Behind the dam rose Lake Mead, the largest artificial lake in the U.S., capable of holding more than two years of the Colorado's flow. The construction of Hoover was a major step towards stabilizing the lower channel of the Colorado River, storing water for irrigation in times of drought, and providing much-needed flood control as part of a program known as the Boulder Canyon Project. Hoover was the tallest dam in the world at the time of construction and also had the world's largest hydroelectric power plant. Flow regulation from Hoover Dam opened the doors for rapid development on the lower Colorado River; Imperial and Parker dams followed in 1938, and Davis Dam was completed in 1950.

Completed in 1938 some above Yuma, Imperial Dam diverts nearly all of the Colorado's flow into two irrigation canals. The All-American Canal, built as a permanent replacement for the Alamo Canal, is so named because it lies completely within the U.S., unlike its ill–fated predecessor. With a capacity of over , the All-American is the largest irrigation canal in the world, supplying water to of California's Imperial Valley. Because the valley's warm and sunny climate lends to a year-round growing season in addition to the large water supply furnished by the Colorado, the Imperial Valley is now one of the most productive agricultural regions in North America. In 1957, the USBR completed a second canal, the Gila Gravity Main Canal, to irrigate about in southwestern Arizona with Colorado River water as part of the Gila Project.
The Lower Basin states also sought to develop the Colorado for municipal supplies. Central Arizona initially relied on the Gila River and its tributaries through projects such as the <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt%20Dam">Theodore Roosevelt</a> and <a href="Coolidge%20Dam">Coolidge</a> Dams – completed in 1911 and 1928, respectively. Roosevelt was the first large dam constructed by the USBR and provided the water needed to start large-scale agricultural and urban development in the region. The <a href="Colorado%20River%20Aqueduct">Colorado River Aqueduct</a>, which delivers water nearly from near Parker Dam to 10 million people in the <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> metropolitan area, was completed in 1941. The <a href="San%20Diego%20Aqueduct">San Diego Aqueduct</a> branch, whose initial phase was complete by 1947, furnishes water to nearly 3 million people in <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> and its suburbs. The Las Vegas Valley of Nevada experienced rapid growth in part due to Hoover Dam construction, and Las Vegas had tapped a pipeline into Lake Mead by 1937. Nevada officials, believing that groundwater resources in the southern part of the state were sufficient for future growth, were more concerned with securing a large amount of the dam's power supply than water from the Colorado; thus they settled for the smallest allocation of all the states in the Colorado River Compact.

Through the early decades of the 20th century, the Upper Basin states, with the exception of Colorado, remained relatively undeveloped and used little of the water allowed to them under the Colorado River Compact. Water use had increased significantly by the 1950s, and more water was being diverted out of the Colorado River basin to the Front Range corridor, the <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a> area in Utah, and the Rio Grande basin in New Mexico. Such projects included the Roberts Tunnel, completed in 1956, which diverts per year from the Blue River to the city of Denver, and the <a href="Fryingpan-Arkansas%20Project">Fryingpan-Arkansas Project</a>, which delivers from the <a href="Fryingpan%20River">Fryingpan River</a> to the Arkansas River basin each year. Without the addition of surface water storage in the upper basin, there was no guarantee that the upper basin states would be able to use the full amount of water given to them by the compact. There was also the concern that drought could impair the upper basin's ability to deliver the required past Lee's Ferry per year as stipulated by the compact. A 1956 act of Congress cleared the way for the USBR's Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP), which entailed the construction of large dams on the Colorado, Green, Gunnison and San Juan Rivers.

The initial blueprints for the CRSP included two dams on the Green River within <a href="Dinosaur%20National%20Monument">Dinosaur National Monument</a>'s <a href="Echo%20Park%20%28Colorado%29">Echo Park Canyon</a>, a move criticized by both the <a href="U.S.%20National%20Park%20Service">U.S. National Park Service</a> and environmentalist groups such as the <a href="Sierra%20Club">Sierra Club</a>. Controversy reached a nationwide scale, and the USBR dropped its plans for the Dinosaur dams in exchange for a dam at <a href="Flaming%20Gorge%20Dam">Flaming Gorge</a> and a raise to an already-proposed dam at Glen Canyon. The famed opposition to Glen Canyon Dam, the primary feature of the CRSP, did not build momentum until construction was well underway. This was primarily because of Glen Canyon's remote location and the result that most of the American public did not even know of the existence of the impressive gorge; the few who did contended that it had much greater scenic value than Echo Park. Sierra Club leader <a href="David%20Brower">David Brower</a> fought the dam both during the construction and for many years afterwards until his death in 2000. Brower strongly believed that he was personally responsible for the failure to prevent Glen Canyon's flooding, calling it his "greatest mistake, greatest sin".

Agricultural and urban growth in Arizona eventually outstripped the capacity of local rivers; these concerns were reflected in the creation of a Pacific Southwest Water Plan in the 1950s, which aimed to build a project that would permit Arizona to fully utilize its allotment of the river. The Pacific Southwest Water Plan was the first major proposal to divert water to the Colorado Basin from other river basins – namely, from the wetter northwestern United States. It was intended to boost supplies for the Lower Basin states of Arizona, California and Nevada as well as Mexico, thus allowing the Upper Basin states to retain native Colorado River flows for their own use. Although there was still a surplus of water in the Colorado Basin during the mid-20th century, the Bureau of Reclamation predicted, correctly, that eventually population growth would outstrip the available supply and require the transfer of water from other sources.

The original version of the plan proposed to divert water from the <a href="Trinity%20River%20%28California%29">Trinity River</a> in northern California to reduce Southern California's dependence on the Colorado, allowing more water to be pumped, by exchange, to central Arizona. Because of the large amount of power that would be required to pump Colorado River water to Arizona, the CAP originally included provisions for hydroelectric dams at <a href="Bridge%20Canyon%20Dam">Bridge Canyon</a> and <a href="Marble%20Canyon%20Dam">Marble Canyon</a>, which would have flooded large portions of the Colorado within the Grand Canyon and dewatered much of the remainder. When these plans were publicized, the environmental movement – still reeling from the Glen Canyon controversy – successfully lobbied against the project. As a result, the Grand Canyon dams were removed from the CAP agenda, the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park were extended to preclude any further development in the area, and the pumping power was replaced by the building of the coal-fired <a href="Navajo%20Generating%20Station">Navajo Generating Station</a> near Page, Arizona, in 1976. The resulting <a href="Central%20Arizona%20Project">Central Arizona Project</a> (CAP) irrigates more than and provides municipal supplies to over 5 million people from Phoenix to Tucson using water from the Colorado River.

Historically, the Colorado <a href="Sediment%20transport">transported</a> from of sediment or silt to the Gulf of California each year – second only to the Mississippi among North American rivers. This sediment nourished wetlands and riparian areas along the river's lower course, particularly in its delta, once the largest desert estuary on the continent. Currently, the majority of sediments carried by the Colorado River are deposited at the upper end of Lake Powell, and most of the remainder ends up in Lake Mead. Various estimates place the time it would take for Powell to completely fill with silt at 300 to 700 years. Dams trapping sediment not only pose damage to river habitat but also threaten future operations of the Colorado River reservoir system.

Reduction in flow caused by dams, diversions, water for thermoelectric power stations, and <a href="evaporation">evaporation</a> losses from reservoirs – the latter of which consumes more than 15 percent of the river's natural runoff – has had severe ecological consequences in the Colorado River Delta and the Gulf of California. Historically, the delta with its large freshwater outflow and extensive salt marshes provided an important breeding ground for aquatic species in the Gulf. Today's desiccated delta, at only a fraction of its former size, no longer provides suitable habitat, and populations of fish, shrimp and sea mammals in the gulf have seen a dramatic decline. Since 1963, the only times when the Colorado River has reached the ocean have been during <a href="El%20Ni%C3%B1o">El Niño</a> events in the 1980s and 1990s.

Reduced flows have led to increases in the concentration of certain substances in the lower river that have impacted water quality. Salinity is one of the major issues and also leads to the corrosion of pipelines in agricultural and urban areas. The lower Colorado's salt content was about 50 parts per million (ppm) in its natural state, but by the 1960s, it had increased to well over 2000 ppm. By the early 1970s, there was also serious concern about salinity caused by salts leached from local soils by irrigation drainage water, which were estimated to add of excess salt to the river per year. The <a href="Colorado%20River%20Basin%20Salinity%20Control%20Program">Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act</a> was passed in 1974, mandating conservation practices including the reduction of saline drainage. The program reduced the annual load by about , but salinity remains an ongoing issue. In 1997, the USBR estimated that saline irrigation water caused crop damages exceeding $500 million in the U.S. and $100 million in Mexico. Further efforts have been made to combat the salt issue in the lower Colorado, including the construction of a <a href="desalination%20plant">desalination plant</a> at Yuma. In 2011, the seven U.S. states agreed upon a "Plan of Implementation", which aims to reduce salinity by per year by 2030. In 2013, the Bureau of Reclamation estimated that around $32 million was spent each year to prevent around 1.2 million tons of salt from entering and damaging the Colorado River.

Agricultural runoff containing pesticide residues has also been concentrated in the lower river in greater amounts. This has led to fish kills; six of these events were recorded between 1964 and 1968 alone. The pesticide issue is even greater in streams and water bodies near agricultural lands irrigated by the <a href="Imperial%20Irrigation%20District">Imperial Irrigation District</a> with Colorado River water. In the Imperial Valley, Colorado River water used for irrigation overflows into the <a href="New%20River%20%28Mexico-United%20States%29">New</a> and Alamo rivers and into the Salton Sea. Both rivers and the sea are among the most polluted bodies of water in the United States, posing dangers not only to aquatic life but to contact by humans and migrating birds. Pollution from agricultural runoff is not limited to the lower river; the issue is also significant in upstream reaches such as Colorado's Grand Valley, also a major center of irrigated agriculture.

Large dams such as Hoover and Glen Canyon typically release water from lower levels of their reservoirs, resulting in stable and relatively cold year-round temperatures in long reaches of the river. The Colorado's average temperature once ranged from at the height of summer to near freezing in winter, but modern flows through the Grand Canyon, for example, rarely deviate significantly from . Changes in temperature regime have caused declines of native fish populations, and stable flows have enabled increased vegetation growth, obstructing riverside habitat. These flow patterns have also made the Colorado more dangerous to recreational boaters; people are more likely to die of hypothermia in the colder water, and the general lack of flooding allows rockslides to build up, making the river more difficult to navigate.

In the 21st century, there has been renewed interest in restoring a limited water flow to the delta. In November 2012, the U.S. and Mexico reached an agreement, known as Minute 319, permitting Mexico storage of its water allotment in U.S. reservoirs during wet years, thus increasing the efficiency with which the water can be used. In addition to renovating irrigation canals in the Mexicali Valley to reduce leakage, this will make about per year available for release to the delta on average. The water will be used to provide both an annual base flow and a spring "pulse flow" to mimic the river's original snowmelt-driven regime. The first pulse flow, an eight-week release of , was initiated on March 21, 2014, with the aim of revitalising of <a href="wetland">wetland</a>. This pulse reached the sea on May 16, 2014, marking the first time in 16 years that any water from the Colorado flowed into the ocean, and was hailed as "an experiment of historic political and ecological significance" and a landmark in U.S.–Mexican cooperation in conservation. The pulse will be followed by the steady release of over the following three years, just a small fraction of its average flow before damming.

When the Colorado River Compact was drafted in the 1920s, it was based on barely 30 years of streamflow records that suggested an average annual flow of past Lee's Ferry. Modern studies of <a href="tree%20ring">tree ring</a>s revealed that those three decades were probably the wettest in the past 500 to 1,200 years and that the natural long-term annual flow past Lee's Ferry is probably closer to , as compared to the natural flow at the mouth of . This has resulted in more water being allocated to river users than actually flows through the Colorado. Droughts have exacerbated the issue of water over-allocation, including the <a href="Texas%20drought%20of%20the%201950s">Texas drought of the 1950s</a>, which saw several consecutive years of notably low water and has often been used in planning for "a worst-case scenario".
The most severe drought on record began in the early 21st century, in which the river basin produced normal or above-average runoff in only four years between 2000 and 2012. Major reservoirs in the basin dropped to historic lows, with Lake Powell falling to just one-third of capacity in early 2005, the lowest level on record since 1969, when the reservoir was still in the process of filling. The watershed is experiencing a warming trend, which is accompanied by earlier snowmelt and a general reduction in precipitation. A 2004 study showed that a 1–6 percent decrease of precipitation would lead to runoff declining by as much as 18 percent by 2050. Average reservoir storage declined by at least 32 percent, further crippling the region's water supply and hydropower generation. A study by the <a href="Scripps%20Institution%20of%20Oceanography">Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a> in 2008 predicted that both Lake Mead and Lake Powell stand an even chance of dropping to useless levels or "dead pool" by 2021 if current drying trends and water usage rates continue.

In late 2010, Lake Mead dropped to just above the first "drought trigger" elevation, a level at which Arizona and Nevada would have to begin rationing water as delineated by the Colorado River Compact. Despite above-average runoff in 2011 that raised the immense reservoir more than , record drought conditions returned in 2012 and 2013. Reservoir levels were low enough at the beginning of water year 2014 that the Bureau of Reclamation cut releases from Lake Powell by – the first such reduction since the 1960s, when Lake Powell was being filled for the first time. This resulted in Lake Mead dropping to its lowest recorded level since 1937, when it was first being filled. Rapid development and economic growth further complicate the issue of a secure water supply, particularly in the case of California's senior water rights over those of Nevada and Arizona: in case of a reduction in water supply, Nevada and Arizona would have to endure severe cuts before any reduction in the California allocation, which is also larger than the other two combined. Although stringent water conservation measures have been implemented, the threat of severe shortfalls in the Colorado River basin continues to increase each year.

After a much lower-than-average snowpack in the 2018 water year, Bureau of Reclamation officials projected the odds of an official shortage declaration in 2020 at 52 percent, in 2021 at 64 percent, and in 2022 at 68 percent.

The Colorado River and its tributaries often nourish extensive corridors of <a href="riparian%20zone">riparian</a> growth as they traverse the arid desert regions of the watershed. Although riparian zones represent a relatively small proportion of the basin and have been affected by engineering projects and river diversion in many places, they have the greatest biodiversity of any habitat in the basin. The most prominent riparian zones along the river occur along the lower Colorado below Davis Dam, especially in the Colorado River Delta, where riparian areas support 358 species of birds despite the reduction in freshwater flow and invasive plants such as <a href="Tamarix">tamarisk</a> (salt cedar). Reduction of the delta's size has also threatened animals such as jaguars and the <a href="vaquita">vaquita</a> porpoise, which is endemic to the gulf. Human development of the Colorado River has also helped to create new riparian zones by smoothing the river's seasonal flow, notably through the Grand Canyon.
More than 1,600 species of plants grow in the Colorado River watershed, ranging from the <a href="creosote%20bush">creosote bush</a>, <a href="saguaro%20cactus">saguaro cactus</a>, and <a href="Joshua%20tree">Joshua tree</a>s of the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts to the forests of the Rocky Mountains and other uplands, composed mainly of <a href="ponderosa%20pine">ponderosa pine</a>, <a href="subalpine%20fir">subalpine fir</a>, <a href="Douglas-fir">Douglas-fir</a> and <a href="Engelmann%20spruce">Engelmann spruce</a>. Before logging in the 19th century, forests were abundant in high elevations as far south as the Mexico–U.S. border, and runoff from these areas nourished abundant grassland communities in river valleys. Some arid regions of the watershed, such as the upper Green River valley in Wyoming, Canyonlands National Park in Utah and the <a href="San%20Pedro%20River%20%28Arizona%29">San Pedro River</a> valley in Arizona and Sonora, supported extensive reaches of grassland roamed by large mammals such as <a href="American%20bison">buffalo</a> and <a href="pronghorn">antelope</a> as late as the 1860s. Near Tucson, Arizona, "where now there is only powder-dry desert, the grass once reached as high as the head of a man on horse back".

Rivers and streams in the Colorado basin were once home to 49 species of native fish, of which 42 were <a href="endemic%20species">endemic</a>. Engineering projects and river regulation have led to the extinction of four species and severe declines in the populations of 40 species. <a href="Bonytail%20chub">Bonytail chub</a>, <a href="razorback%20sucker">razorback sucker</a>, Colorado pikeminnow, and <a href="humpback%20chub">humpback chub</a> are among those considered the most at risk; all are unique to the Colorado River system and well adapted to the river's natural silty conditions and flow variations. Clear, cold water released by dams has significantly changed characteristics of habitat for these and other Colorado River basin fishes. A further 40 species that occur in the river today, notably the <a href="brown%20trout">brown trout</a>, were introduced during the 19th and 20th centuries, mainly for sport fishing.

Famed for its dramatic rapids and canyons, the Colorado is one of the most desirable <a href="whitewater">whitewater</a> rivers in the United States, and its <a href="Grand%20Canyon">Grand Canyon</a> section – run by more than 22,000 people annually – has been called the "granddaddy of rafting trips". Grand Canyon trips typically begin at <a href="Lee%27s%20Ferry">Lee's Ferry</a> and take out at <a href="Diamond%20Creek%20%28Arizona%29">Diamond Creek</a> or <a href="Lake%20Mead">Lake Mead</a>; they range from one to eighteen days for commercial trips and from two to twenty-five days for private trips. Private (noncommercial) trips are extremely difficult to arrange because the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> limits river traffic for environmental purposes; people who desire such a trip often have to wait more than 10 years for the opportunity.

Several other sections of the river and its tributaries are popular whitewater runs, and many of these are also served by commercial outfitters. The Colorado's Cataract Canyon and many reaches in the Colorado headwaters are even more heavily used than the Grand Canyon, and about 60,000 boaters run a single section above <a href="Radium%2C%20Colorado">Radium, Colorado</a>, each year. The upper Colorado also includes many of the river's most challenging rapids, including those in Gore Canyon, which is considered so dangerous that "boating is not recommended". Another section of the river above Moab, known as the Colorado "Daily" or "Fisher Towers Section", is the most visited whitewater run in Utah, with more than 77,000 visitors in 2011 alone. The rapids of the Green River's Gray and <a href="Desolation%20Canyon">Desolation</a> Canyons and the less difficult "<a href="Goosenecks%20State%20Park">Goosenecks</a>" section of the lower San Juan River are also frequently traversed by boaters.

Eleven U.S. national parks – Arches, <a href="Black%20Canyon%20of%20the%20Gunnison%20National%20Park">Black Canyon of the Gunnison</a>, <a href="Bryce%20Canyon%20National%20Park">Bryce Canyon</a>, Canyonlands, <a href="Capitol%20Reef%20National%20Park">Capitol Reef</a>, Grand Canyon, <a href="Mesa%20Verde%20National%20Park">Mesa Verde</a>, <a href="Petrified%20Forest%20National%20Park">Petrified Forest</a>, <a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20National%20Park">Rocky Mountain</a>, <a href="Saguaro%20National%20Park">Saguaro</a>, and <a href="Zion%20National%20Park">Zion</a> – are in the watershed, in addition to many national forests, state parks, and recreation areas. Hiking, backpacking, camping, skiing, and fishing are among the multiple recreation opportunities offered by these areas. Fisheries have declined in many streams in the watershed, especially in the Rocky Mountains, because of polluted runoff from mining and agricultural activities. The Colorado's major reservoirs are also heavily traveled summer destinations. Houseboating and water-skiing are popular activities on Lakes Mead, Powell, Havasu, and Mojave, as well as <a href="Flaming%20Gorge%20Reservoir">Flaming Gorge Reservoir</a> in Utah and Wyoming, and <a href="Navajo%20Reservoir">Navajo Reservoir</a> in New Mexico and Colorado. Lake Powell and surrounding <a href="Glen%20Canyon%20National%20Recreation%20Area">Glen Canyon National Recreation Area</a> received more than two million visitors per year in 2007, while nearly 7.9 million people visited Lake Mead and the <a href="Lake%20Mead%20National%20Recreation%20Area">Lake Mead National Recreation Area</a> in 2008. Colorado River recreation employs some 250,000 people and contributes $26 billion each year to the Southwest economy.

Mayan languages

The Mayan languages form a <a href="language%20family">language family</a> spoken in <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a> and northern <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>. Mayan languages are spoken by at least 6 million <a href="Maya%20peoples">Maya peoples</a>, primarily in <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="Belize">Belize</a> and <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a>. In 1996, Guatemala formally recognized 21 Mayan languages by name, and Mexico <a href="Languages%20of%20Mexico">recognizes</a> eight more within its territory.

The Mayan language family is one of the best-documented and most studied in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>. Modern Mayan languages descend from the <a href="Proto-Mayan%20language">Proto-Mayan language</a>, thought to have been spoken at least 5,000 years ago; it has been partially <a href="historical%20linguistics">reconstructed</a> using the <a href="comparative%20method%20%28linguistics%29">comparative method</a>. The proto-Mayan language diversified into at least six different branches: the Huastecan, Quichean, Yucatecan, Qanjobalan, Mamean and Chʼolan–Tzeltalan branches.

Mayan languages form part of the <a href="Mesoamerican%20language%20area">Mesoamerican language area</a>, an <a href="sprachbund">area of linguistic convergence</a> developed throughout millennia of interaction between the peoples of Mesoamerica. All Mayan languages display the basic diagnostic traits of this linguistic area. For example, all use <a href="relational%20noun">relational noun</a>s instead of <a href="preposition">preposition</a>s to indicate spatial relationships. They also possess <a href="grammar">grammatical</a> and <a href="linguistic%20typology">typological</a> features that set them apart from other languages of Mesoamerica, such as the use of <a href="Ergative%E2%80%93absolutive%20language">ergativity</a> in the grammatical treatment of verbs and their subjects and objects, specific inflectional categories on verbs, and a special <a href="Lexical%20category">word class</a> of "positionals" which is typical of all Mayan languages.

During the <a href="pre-Columbian%20era">pre-Columbian era</a> of <a href="Mesoamerican%20chronology">Mesoamerican history</a>, some Mayan languages were written in the <a href="Logogram">logo-syllabic</a> <a href="Maya%20script">Maya script</a>. Its use was particularly widespread during the <a href="Maya%20civilization%23Classic%20period%20%28c.%20250%E2%80%93900%20AD%29">Classic period</a> of Maya civilization (c. 250–900). The surviving corpus of over 10,000 known individual Maya inscriptions on buildings, monuments, pottery and bark-paper <a href="Maya%20codices">codices</a>, combined with the rich postcolonial <a href="Mesoamerican%20literature">literature in Mayan languages</a> written in the <a href="Latin%20script">Latin script</a>, provides a basis for the modern understanding of pre-Columbian history unparalleled in the Americas.

Mayan languages are the descendants of a <a href="proto-language">proto-language</a> called Proto-Mayan or, in Kʼicheʼ Maya, "Nabʼee Mayaʼ Tzij" ("the old Maya Language"). The Proto-Mayan language is believed to have been spoken in the Cuchumatanes highlands of central Guatemala in an area corresponding roughly to where Qʼanjobalan is spoken today. The earliest proposal was that of which identified the Chiapas-Guatemalan highlands as the likely "cradle" of Mayan languages was published by the German antiquarian and scholar <a href="Karl%20Sapper">Karl Sapper</a>. <a href="Terrence%20Kaufman">Terrence Kaufman</a> and John Justeson have reconstructed more than 3000 lexical items for the proto-Mayan language.

According to the prevailing classification scheme by <a href="Lyle%20Campbell">Lyle Campbell</a> and Terrence Kaufman, the first division occurred around 2200 BCE, when Huastecan split away from Mayan proper after its speakers moved northwest along the <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20of%20Mexico">Gulf Coast of Mexico</a>. Proto-Yucatecan and Proto-Chʼolan speakers subsequently split off from the main group and moved north into the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a>. Speakers of the western branch moved south into the areas now inhabited by Mamean and Quichean people. When speakers of proto-Tzeltalan later separated from the Chʼolan group and moved south into the <a href="Chiapas%20highlands">Chiapas highlands</a>, they came into contact with speakers of <a href="Mixe%E2%80%93Zoque%20languages">Mixe–Zoque languages</a>. According to an alternative theory by Robertson and <a href="Stephen%20D.%20Houston">Houston</a>, Huastecan stayed in the Guatemalan highlands with speakers of Chʼolan–Tzeltalan, separating from that branch at a much later date than proposed by Kaufman.

In the Archaic period (before 2000 BCE), a number of <a href="loanword">loanword</a>s from Mixe–Zoquean languages seem to have entered the proto-Mayan language. This has led to hypotheses that the early Maya were dominated by speakers of Mixe–Zoquean languages, possibly the <a href="Olmec">Olmec</a>. In the case of the <a href="Xincan%20language">Xincan</a> and <a href="Lencan%20languages">Lencan languages</a>, on the other hand, Mayan languages are more often the source than the receiver of loanwords. Mayan language specialists such as Campbell believe this suggests a period of intense contact between Maya and the <a href="Lenca%20people">Lencan</a> and <a href="Xinca%20people">Xinca people</a>, possibly during the Classic period (250–900).

During the Classic period the major branches began diversifying into separate languages. The split between Proto-Yucatecan (in the north, that is, the Yucatán Peninsula) and Proto-Chʼolan (in the south, that is, the Chiapas highlands and <a href="Pet%C3%A9n%20Basin">Petén Basin</a>) had already occurred by the Classic period, when most extant <a href="%23Glyphic%20writing">Maya inscriptions</a> were written. Both variants are attested in hieroglyphic inscriptions at the <a href="List%20of%20Maya%20sites">Maya sites</a> of the time, and both are commonly referred to as "<a href="Classic%20Maya%20language">Classic Maya language</a>". Although a single prestige language was by far the most frequently recorded on extant hieroglyphic texts, evidence for at least five different varieties of Mayan have been discovered within the hieroglyphic corpus—an Eastern Chʼolan variety found in texts written in the southern Maya area and the highlands, a Western Chʼolan variety diffused from the Usumacinta region from the mid-7th century on, a Yucatecan variety found in the texts from the Yucatán Peninsula, a Tzeltalan variety found in the Western Lowlands (i.e. Toniná, Pomona), and possibly a highland Maya language belonging to Kʼichean major within texts painted on Nebaj ceramics. The reason why only few linguistic varieties are found in the glyphic texts is probably that these served as <a href="prestige%20dialect">prestige dialect</a>s throughout the Maya region; hieroglyphic texts would have been composed in the language of the elite.

Stephen Houston, John Robertson and David Stuart have suggested that the specific variety of Chʼolan found in the majority of Southern Lowland glyphic texts was a language they dub "Classic Chʼoltiʼan", the ancestor language of the modern <a href="Ch%CA%BCorti%CA%BC%20language">Chʼortiʼ</a> and <a href="Ch%CA%BColti%CA%BC%20language">Chʼoltiʼ language</a>s. They propose that it originated in western and south-central Petén Basin, and that it was used in the inscriptions and perhaps also spoken by elites and priests. However, Mora-Marín has argued that traits shared by Classic Lowland Maya and the Chʼoltiʼan languages are retentions rather than innovations, and that the diversification of Chʼolan in fact post-dates the classic period. The language of the classical lowland inscriptions then would have been proto-Chʼolan.

During the Spanish colonization of Central America, all <a href="Indigenous%20languages%20of%20the%20Americas">indigenous</a> languages were eclipsed by <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, which became the new prestige language. The use of Mayan languages in many important domains of society, including administration, religion and literature, came to an end. Yet the Maya area was more resistant to outside influence than others, and perhaps for this reason, many Maya communities still retain a high proportion of <a href="monolingual">monolingual</a> speakers. The Maya area is now dominated by the Spanish language. While a number of Mayan languages are <a href="moribund%20language">moribund</a> or are considered <a href="endangered%20language">endangered</a>, others remain quite viable, with speakers across all age groups and native language use in all domains of society.

As Maya archaeology advanced during the 20th century and <a href="nationalist">nationalist</a> and ethnic-pride-based ideologies spread, the Mayan-speaking peoples began to develop a shared <a href="ethnic">ethnic</a> identity as Maya, the heirs of the <a href="Maya%20civilization">Maya civilization</a>.

The word "Maya" was likely derived from the postclassical Yucatán city of <a href="Mayapan">Mayapan</a>; its more restricted meaning in pre-colonial and colonial times points to an origin in a particular region of the Yucatán Peninsula. The broader meaning of "Maya" now current, while defined by linguistic relationships, is also used to refer to ethnic or cultural traits. Most Mayans identify first and foremost with a particular ethnic group, e.g. as "Yucatec" or "Kʼicheʼ"; but they also recognize a shared Maya kinship. Language has been fundamental in defining the boundaries of that kinship. Fabri writes: "The term Maya is problematic because Maya peoples do not constitute a homogenous identity. Maya, rather, has become a strategy of self-representation for the Maya movements and its followers. The Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG) finds twenty-one distinct Mayan languages." This pride in unity has led to an insistence on the distinctions of different Mayan languages, some of which are so closely related that they could easily be referred to as <a href="dialects">dialects</a> of a single language. But, given that the term "dialect" has been used by some with <a href="Racism">racialist</a> overtones in the past, as scholars made a spurious distinction between Amerindian "dialects" and European "languages", the preferred usage in Mesoamerica in recent years has been to designate the linguistic varieties spoken by different ethnic group as separate languages.

In Guatemala, matters such as developing standardized orthographies for the Mayan languages are governed by the <a href="Academia%20de%20Lenguas%20Mayas%20de%20Guatemala">Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala</a> (ALMG; Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages), which was founded by Maya organisations in 1986. Following the 1996 <a href="Guatemalan%20Civil%20War">peace accords</a>, it has been gaining a growing recognition as the regulatory authority on Mayan languages both among Mayan scholars and the Maya peoples.

The Mayan language family has no demonstrated <a href="Genetic%20relationship%20%28linguistics%29">genetic relationship</a> to other language families. Similarities with some languages of Mesoamerica are understood to be due to diffusion of linguistic traits from neighboring languages into Mayan and not to common ancestry. Mesoamerica has been proven to be an area of substantial linguistic diffusion.

A wide range of proposals have tried to link the Mayan family to other language families or <a href="language%20isolate">isolates</a>, but none is generally supported by linguists. Examples include linking Mayan with the <a href="Uru%E2%80%93Chipaya%20languages">Uru–Chipaya languages</a>, <a href="Mapuche%20language">Mapuche</a>, the Lencan languages, <a href="Pur%C3%A9pecha%20language">Purépecha</a> and <a href="Huave%20language">Huave</a>. Mayan has also been included in various <a href="Hokan%20languages">Hokan</a> and <a href="Penutian%20languages">Penutian</a> hypotheses. The linguist <a href="Joseph%20Greenberg">Joseph Greenberg</a> included Mayan in his highly controversial <a href="Amerind%20languages">Amerind hypothesis</a>, which is rejected by most <a href="historical%20linguistics">historical linguists</a> as unsupported by available evidence.

Writing in 1997, <a href="Lyle%20Campbell">Lyle Campbell</a>, an expert in Mayan languages and historical linguistics, argued that the most promising proposal is the "<a href="Macro-Mayan%20languages">Macro-Mayan</a>" hypothesis, which posits links between Mayan, the <a href="Mixe%E2%80%93Zoque%20languages">Mixe–Zoque languages</a> and the <a href="Totonacan%20languages">Totonacan languages</a>, but more research is needed to support or disprove this hypothesis. In 2015, Campbell noted that recent evidence presented by David Mora-Marin makes the case for a relationship between Mayan and Mixe-Zoquean languages "much more plausible".

The Mayan family consists of thirty languages. Typically, these languages are grouped into 5-6 major subgroups (Yucatecan, Huastecan, Chʼolan–Tzeltalan, Qʼanjobʼalan, Mamean, and Kʼichean).
The Mayan language family is extremely well documented, and its internal genealogical classification scheme is widely accepted and established, except for some minor unresolved differences.

One point still at issue is the position of Chʼolan and Qʼanjobalan–Chujean. Some scholars think these form a separate Western branch (as in the diagram below). Other linguists do not support the positing of an especially close relationship between Chʼolan and Qʼanjobalan–Chujean; consequently they classify these as two distinct branches emanating directly from the proto-language. An alternative proposed classification groups the Huastecan branch as springing from the Chʼolan–Tzeltalan node, rather than as an outlying branch springing directly from the proto-Mayan node.

Studies estimate that Mayan languages are spoken by more than 6 million people. Most of them live in Guatemala where depending on estimates 40%-60% of the population speaks a Mayan language. In Mexico the Mayan speaking population was estimated at 2.5 million people in 2010, whereas the Belizean speaker population figures around 30,000.

The Chʼolan languages were formerly widespread throughout the Maya area, but today the language with most speakers is <a href="Ch%CA%BCol%20language">Chʼol</a>, spoken by 130,000 in Chiapas. Its closest relative, the <a href="Chontal%20Maya%20language">Chontal Maya language</a>, is spoken by 55,000 in the state of <a href="Tabasco">Tabasco</a>. Another related language, now endangered, is <a href="Ch%CA%BCorti%CA%BC%20language">Chʼortiʼ</a>, which is spoken by 30,000 in Guatemala. It was previously also spoken in the extreme west of <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a> and <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a>, but the Salvadorian variant is now extinct and the Honduran one is considered moribund. <a href="Ch%CA%BColti%CA%BC%20language">Chʼoltiʼ</a>, a sister language of Chʼortiʼ, is also extinct. Chʼolan languages are believed to be the most conservative in vocabulary and phonology, and are closely related to the <a href="Classic%20Maya%20language">language of the Classic-era inscriptions</a> found in the Central Lowlands. They may have served as prestige languages, coexisting with other dialects in some areas. This assumption provides a plausible explanation for the geographical distance between the Chʼortiʼ zone and the areas where Chʼol and Chontal are spoken.

The closest relatives of the Chʼolan languages are the languages of the Tzeltalan branch, <a href="Tzotzil%20language">Tzotzil</a> and <a href="Tzeltal%20language">Tzeltal</a>, both spoken in Chiapas by large and stable or growing populations (265,000 for Tzotzil and 215,000 for <a href="Tzeltal%20people">Tzeltal</a>). Tzeltal has tens of thousands of monolingual speakers.

<a href="Q%CA%BCanjob%CA%BCal%20language">Qʼanjobʼal</a> is spoken by 77,700 in Guatemala's <a href="Huehuetenango">Huehuetenango</a> department, with small populations elsewhere. The region of Qʼanjobalan speakers in Guatemala, due to genocidal policies during the <a href="Guatemalan%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> and its close proximity to the <a href="Guatemala%E2%80%93Mexico%20border">Mexican border</a>, was the source of a number of refugees. Thus there are now small Qʼanjobʼal, Jakaltek, and Awakatek populations in various locations in Mexico, the United States (such as <a href="Tuscarawas%20County%2C%20Ohio">Tuscarawas County, Ohio</a> and Los Angeles, California), and, through postwar resettlement, other parts of Guatemala. <a href="Jakaltek%20language">Jakaltek</a> (also known as Poptiʼ) is spoken by almost 100,000 in several municipalities of <a href="Huehuetenango">Huehuetenango</a>. Another member of this branch is <a href="Akatek%20language">Akatek</a>, with over 50,000 speakers in <a href="San%20Miguel%20Acat%C3%A1n">San Miguel Acatán</a> and <a href="San%20Rafael%20La%20Independencia">San Rafael La Independencia</a>.

<a href="Chuj%20language">Chuj</a> is spoken by 40,000 people in Huehuetenango, and by 9,500 people, primarily refugees, over the border in Mexico, in the municipality of <a href="La%20Trinitaria%2C%20Mexico">La Trinitaria</a>, <a href="Chiapas">Chiapas</a>, and the villages of Tziscau and Cuauhtémoc. <a href="Tojolabal%20language">Tojolabʼal</a> is spoken in eastern Chiapas by 36,000 people.

The Quichean–Mamean languages and dialects, with two sub-branches and three subfamilies, are spoken in the <a href="Guatemalan%20Highlands">Guatemalan highlands</a>.

<a href="Q%CA%BCeqchi%CA%BC%20language">Qʼeqchiʼ</a> (sometimes spelled Kekchi), which constitutes its own sub-branch within Quichean–Mamean, is spoken by about 800,000 people in the southern <a href="Pet%C3%A9n%20%28department%29">Petén</a>, <a href="Izabal%20Department">Izabal</a> and <a href="Alta%20Verapaz">Alta Verapaz</a> departments of Guatemala, and also in Belize by 9,000 speakers. In El Salvador it is spoken by 12,000 as a result of recent migrations.

The <a href="Uspantek%20language">Uspantek language</a>, which also springs directly from the Quichean–Mamean node, is native only to the <a href="Uspant%C3%A1n">Uspantán</a> "<a href="Municipalities%20of%20Guatemala">municipio</a>" in the department of <a href="Quich%C3%A9%20%28department%29">El Quiché</a>, and has 3,000 speakers.

Within the Quichean sub-branch <a href="K%CA%BCiche%CA%BC%20language">Kʼicheʼ (Quiché)</a>, the Mayan language with the largest number of speakers, is spoken by around 1,000,000 <a href="K%CA%BCiche%CA%BC%20people">Kʼicheʼ Maya</a> in the <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>n highlands, around the towns of <a href="Chichicastenango">Chichicastenango</a> and <a href="Quetzaltenango">Quetzaltenango</a> and in the <a href="Sierra%20de%20los%20Cuchumatanes">Cuchumatán mountains</a>, as well as by urban emigrants in <a href="Guatemala%20City">Guatemala City</a>. The famous Maya mythological document, "<a href="Popol%20Vuh">Popol Vuh</a>", is written in an antiquated Kʼicheʼ often called <a href="Classical%20K%CA%BCiche%CA%BC%20language">Classical Kʼicheʼ (or Quiché)</a>. The <a href="K%CA%BCiche%CA%BC%20Kingdom%20of%20Q%CA%BCumarkaj">Kʼicheʼ culture</a> was at its pinnacle at the time of the Spanish conquest. <a href="Q%CA%BCumarkaj">Qʼumarkaj</a>, near the present-day city of <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20del%20Quich%C3%A9">Santa Cruz del Quiché</a>, was its economic and ceremonial center. <a href="Achi%20language">Achi</a> is spoken by 85,000 people in <a href="Cubulco">Cubulco</a> and <a href="Rabinal">Rabinal</a>, two "municipios" of <a href="Baja%20Verapaz">Baja Verapaz</a>. In some classifications, e.g. the one by <a href="Lyle%20Campbell">Campbell</a>, Achi is counted as a form of Kʼicheʼ. However, owing to a historical division between the two ethnic groups, the Achi Maya do not regard themselves as Kʼicheʼ. The <a href="Kaqchikel%20language">Kaqchikel language</a> is spoken by about 400,000 people in an area stretching from Guatemala City westward to the northern shore of <a href="Lago%20de%20Atitl%C3%A1n">Lake Atitlán</a>. <a href="Tz%CA%BCutujil%20language">Tzʼutujil</a> has about 90,000 speakers in the vicinity of Lake Atitlán. Other members of the Kʼichean branch are <a href="Sakapultek%20language">Sakapultek</a>, spoken by about 15,000 people mostly in <a href="El%20Quich%C3%A9">El Quiché</a> department, and <a href="Sipakapense%20language">Sipakapense</a>, which is spoken by 8,000 people in <a href="Sipacapa">Sipacapa</a>, <a href="San%20Marcos%20%28department%29">San Marcos</a>.

The largest language in the Mamean sub-branch is <a href="Mam%20language">Mam</a>, spoken by 478,000 people in the departments of San Marcos and Huehuetenango. <a href="Awakatek%20language">Awakatek</a> is the language of 20,000 inhabitants of central <a href="Aguacat%C3%A1n">Aguacatán</a>, another municipality of Huehuetenango. <a href="Ixil%20language">Ixil</a> (possibly three different languages) is spoken by 70,000 in the "<a href="Ixil%20Triangle">Ixil Triangle</a>" region of the <a href="Quich%C3%A9%20%28department%29">department of El Quiché</a>. <a href="Tektitek%20language">Tektitek</a> (or Teko) is spoken by over 6,000 people in the municipality of Tectitán, and 1,000 refugees in Mexico. According to the Ethnologue the number of speakers of Tektitek is growing.

The Poqom languages are closely related to Core Quichean, with which they constitute a Poqom-Kʼichean sub-branch on the Quichean–Mamean node. <a href="Poqomchi%CA%BC%20language">Poqomchiʼ</a> is spoken by 90,000 people in <a href="Purulh%C3%A1">Purulhá</a>, <a href="Baja%20Verapaz">Baja Verapaz</a>, and in the following municipalities of <a href="Alta%20Verapaz">Alta Verapaz</a>: <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20Verapaz">Santa Cruz Verapaz</a>, <a href="San%20Crist%C3%B3bal%20Verapaz">San Cristóbal Verapaz</a>, <a href="Tactic%20%28municipality%29">Tactic</a>, <a href="Tamah%C3%BA">Tamahú</a> and <a href="Tucur%C3%BA">Tucurú</a>. <a href="Poqomam%20language">Poqomam</a> is spoken by around 49,000 people in several small pockets in <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>.

<a href="Yucatec%20Maya%20language">Yucatec Maya</a> (known simply as "Maya" to its speakers) is the most commonly spoken Mayan language in <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>. It is currently spoken by approximately 800,000 people, the vast majority of whom are to be found on the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a>. It remains common in <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20%28state%29">Yucatán</a> and in the adjacent states of <a href="Quintana%20Roo">Quintana Roo</a> and <a href="Campeche">Campeche</a>.

The other three Yucatecan languages are <a href="Mopan%20language">Mopan</a>, spoken by around 10,000 speakers primarily in <a href="Belize">Belize</a>; <a href="Itza%CA%BC%20language">Itzaʼ</a>, an extinct or moribund language from Guatemala's Petén Basin; and <a href="Lacandon%20language">Lacandón</a> or Lakantum, also severely endangered with about 1,000 speakers in a few villages on the outskirts of the <a href="Selva%20Lacandona">Selva Lacandona</a>, in <a href="Chiapas">Chiapas</a>.

<a href="Wastek%20language">Wastek</a> (also spelled Huastec and Huaxtec) is spoken in the Mexican states of <a href="Veracruz">Veracruz</a> and <a href="San%20Luis%20Potos%C3%AD">San Luis Potosí</a> by around 110,000 people. It is the most divergent of modern Mayan languages. <a href="Chicomuceltec">Chicomuceltec</a> was a language related to Wastek and spoken in <a href="Chiapas">Chiapas</a> that became extinct some time before 1982.

<a href="Proto-Mayan">Proto-Mayan</a> (the common ancestor of the Mayan languages as reconstructed using the <a href="comparative%20method">comparative method</a>) has a predominant CVC syllable structure, only allowing consonant clusters across syllable boundaries. Most Proto-Mayan roots were "monosyllabic" except for a few disyllabic nominal roots.
Due to subsequent vowel loss many Mayan languages now show complex consonant clusters at both ends of syllables. Following the reconstruction of <a href="Lyle%20Campbell">Lyle Campbell</a> and <a href="Terrence%20Kaufman">Terrence Kaufman</a>, the Proto-Mayan language had the following sounds. It has been suggested that proto-Mayan was a "tonal language", based on the fact that four different contemporary Mayan languages have tone (Yucatec, Uspantek, San Bartolo Tzotzil and Mochoʼ), but since these languages each can be shown to have innovated tone in different ways, Campbell considers this unlikely.

The classification of Mayan languages is based on changes shared between groups of languages. For example, languages of the western group (such as Huastecan, Yucatecan and Chʼolan) all changed the Proto-Mayan <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a> * into , some languages of the eastern branch retained (Kʼichean), and others changed it into or, word-finally, (Mamean). The shared innovations between Huastecan, Yucatecan and Chʼolan show that they separated from the other Mayan languages before the changes found in other branches had taken place.

The palatalized <a href="plosive">plosive</a>s and are not found in any of the modern families. Instead they are reflected differently in different branches, allowing a reconstruction of these phonemes as palatalized plosives. In the eastern branch (Chujean-Qʼanjobalan and Chʼolan) they are reflected as and . In Mamean they are reflected as and and in Quichean as and . Yucatec stands out from other western languages in that its palatalized plosives are sometimes changed into and sometimes .

The Proto-Mayan velar nasal * is reflected as in the eastern branches (Quichean–Mamean), in Qʼanjobalan, Chʼolan and Yucatecan, in Huastecan, and only conserved as in Chuj and Jakaltek.

Vowel quality is typically classified as having monophthongal vowels. In traditionally diphthongized contexts, Mayan languages will realize the V-V sequence by inserting a hiatus-breaking glottal stop or glide insertion between the vowels. Some Kʼichean-branch languages have exhibited developed diphthongs from historical long vowels, by breaking /e:/ and /o:/.

The <a href="morphology%20%28linguistics%29">morphology</a> of Mayan languages is simpler than that of other Mesoamerican languages, yet its <a href="morphology%20%28linguistics%29">morphology</a> is still considered <a href="Agglutinative%20language">agglutinating</a> and <a href="polysynthetic%20language">polysynthetic</a>. Verbs are marked for <a href="Grammatical%20aspect">aspect</a> or <a href="Grammatical%20tense">tense</a>, the <a href="Grammatical%20person">person</a> of the <a href="subject%20%28grammar%29">subject</a>, the person of the <a href="object%20%28grammar%29">object</a> (in the case of <a href="transitive%20verb">transitive verb</a>s), and for <a href="Grammatical%20number">plurality</a> of person. Possessed nouns are marked for person of possessor. In Mayan languages, nouns are not marked for case and gender is not explicitly marked. Inanimate nouns are not gendered, but, if necessary, the gender of animate nouns may be specified by the prefix.

Proto-Mayan is thought to have had a basic <a href="verb%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93subject">verb–object–subject</a> word order with possibilities of switching to <a href="verb%E2%80%93subject%E2%80%93object">VSO</a> in certain circumstances, such as complex sentences, sentences where object and subject were of equal animacy and when the subject was definite. Today Yucatecan, Tzotzil and Tojolabʼal have a basic fixed VOS word order. Mamean, Qʼanjobʼal, Jakaltek and one dialect of Chuj have a fixed VSO one. Only Chʼortiʼ has a basic <a href="subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object">SVO</a> word order. Other Mayan languages allow both VSO and VOS word orders.

In many Mayan languages, counting requires the use of <a href="numeral%20classifiers">numeral classifiers</a>, which specify the class of items being counted; the numeral cannot appear without an accompanying classifier. Some Mayan languages, such as Kaqchikel, do not use numeral classifiers. Class is usually assigned according to whether the object is animate or inanimate or according to an object's general shape. Thus when counting "flat" objects, a different form of numeral classifier is used than when counting round things, oblong items or people. In some Mayan languages such as Chontal, classifiers take the form of affixes attached to the numeral; in others such as Tzeltal, they are free forms. Jakaltek has both numeral classifiers and noun classifiers, and the noun classifiers can also be used as pronouns.

The meaning denoted by a noun may be altered significantly by changing the accompanying classifier. In Chontal, for example, when the classifier "-tek" is used with names of plants it is understood that the objects being enumerated are whole trees. If in this expression a different classifier, "-tsʼit" (for counting long, slender objects) is substituted for "-tek", this conveys the meaning that only sticks or branches of the tree are being counted:

The morphology of Mayan nouns is fairly simple: they inflect for number (plural or singular), and, when possessed, for person and number of their possessor. Pronominal possession is expressed by a set of possessive prefixes attached to the noun, as in Kaqchikel "ru-kej" "his/her horse". Nouns may furthermore adopt a special form marking them as possessed. For nominal possessors, the possessed noun is inflected as possessed by a third-person possessor, and followed by the possessor noun, e.g. Kaqchikel "ru-kej ri achin" "the man's horse" (literally "his horse the man"). This type of formation is a main diagnostic trait of the <a href="Mesoamerican%20Linguistic%20Area">Mesoamerican Linguistic Area</a> and recurs throughout <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>.

Mayan languages often contrast alienable and <a href="inalienable%20possession">inalienable possession</a> by varying the way the noun is (or is not) marked as possessed. Jakaltek, for example, contrasts inalienably possessed ' "my photo (in which I am depicted)" with alienably possessed ' "my photo (taken by me)". The prefix "we-" marks the first person singular possessor in both, but the absence of the "-e" possessive suffix in the first form marks inalienable possession.

Mayan languages which have <a href="preposition">preposition</a>s at all normally have only one. To express location and other relations between entities, use is made of a special class of "<a href="relational%20noun">relational noun</a>s". This pattern is also recurrent throughout Mesoamerica and is another diagnostic trait of the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area. In Mayan most relational nouns are metaphorically derived from body parts so that "on top of", for example, is expressed by the word for "head".

Relational nouns are possessed by the constituent that is the reference point of the relation, and the relational noun names the relation. Thus in Mayan one would say "the mountain's head" (literally "its head the mountain") to mean "on (top of) the mountain". Thus in the Classical Quiché of the "<a href="Popol%20Vuh">Popol Vuh</a>" we read "u-wach ulew" "on the earth" (literally "its face the earth").

Mayan languages are <a href="ergative%E2%80%93absolutive%20language">ergative</a> in their <a href="morphosyntactic%20alignment">alignment</a>. This means that the subject of an intransitive verb is treated similarly to the object of a transitive verb, but differently from the subject of a transitive verb.

Mayan languages have two sets of affixes that are attached to a verb to indicate the person of its arguments. One set (often referred to in Mayan grammars as set B) indicates the person of subjects of intransitive verbs, and of objects of transitive verbs. They can also be used with adjective or noun predicates to indicate the subject.
Another set (set A) is used to indicate the person of subjects of transitive verbs (and in some languages, such as Yucatec, also the subjects of intransitive verbs, but only in the incompletive aspects), and also the possessors of nouns (including relational nouns).
In addition to subject and object (agent and patient), the Mayan verb has affixes signalling aspect, tense, and mood as in the following example:

<a href="Grammatical%20tense">Tense</a> systems in Mayan languages are generally simple. Jakaltek, for example, contrasts only past and non-past, while Mam has only future and non-future. <a href="grammatical%20aspect">Aspect</a> systems are normally more prominent. <a href="Grammatical%20mood">Mood</a> does not normally form a separate system in Mayan, but is instead intertwined with the tense/aspect system. Kaufman has reconstructed a tense/aspect/mood system for proto-Mayan that includes seven aspects: incompletive, progressive, completive/punctual, imperative, potential/future, optative, and perfective.

Mayan languages tend to have a rich set of <a href="grammatical%20voice">grammatical voice</a>s. Proto-Mayan had at least one passive construction as well as an <a href="Antipassive%20voice">antipassive</a> rule for downplaying the importance of the agent in relation to the patient. Modern Kʼicheʼ has two antipassives: one which ascribes focus to the object and another that emphasizes the verbal action. Other voice-related constructions occurring in Mayan languages are the following: <a href="mediopassive%20voice">mediopassive</a>, incorporational (incorporating a direct object into the verb), instrumental (promoting the instrument to object position) and referential (a kind of <a href="applicative%20voice">applicative</a> promoting an indirect argument such as a <a href="benefactive">benefactive</a> or recipient to the object position).

In Mayan languages, words are usually viewed as belonging to one of four classes: verbs, statives, adjectives, and nouns.

Statives are a class of <a href="predicate%20%28grammar%29">predicative</a> words expressing a quality or state, whose syntactic properties fall in between those of verbs and adjectives in Indo-European languages. Like verbs, statives can sometimes be inflected for person but normally lack inflections for tense, aspect and other purely verbal categories. Statives can be adjectives, positionals or numerals.

Positionals, a class of <a href="root%20%28linguistics%29">root</a>s characteristic of, if not unique to, the Mayan languages, form stative adjectives and verbs (usually with the help of suffixes) with meanings related to the position or shape of an object or person. Mayan languages have between 250 and 500 distinct positional roots:

In these three Qʼanjobʼal sentences,the positionals are "telan" ("something large or cylindrical lying down as if having fallen"), "woqan" ("person sitting on a chairlike object"), and "xoyan" ("curled up like a rope or snake").

Compounding of noun roots to form new nouns is commonplace; there are also many morphological processes to derive nouns from verbs. Verbs also admit highly productive <a href="Derivation%20%28linguistics%29">derivational</a> affixes of several kinds, most of which specify transitivity or voice.

Some Mayan languages allow incorporation of noun stems into verbs, either as direct objects or in other functions. However, there are few affixes with <a href="adverb">adverb</a>ial or modal meanings.

As in other Mesoamerican languages, there is widespread metaphorical use of roots denoting body parts, particularly to form locatives and relational nouns such as Tzeltal/Tzotzil "tiʼ na" "door" (lit. "mouth of house"), or Kaqchikel "chi ru-pam" "inside" (lit. "mouth its-stomach").

A number of <a href="loanword">loanword</a>s of Mayan or potentially Mayan origins are found in other languages, principally <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, <a href="English%20language">English</a>, and some neighboring <a href="Mesoamerican%20languages">Mesoamerican languages</a>. In addition, Mayan languages borrowed words, especially from Spanish.

A Mayan loanword is "<a href="cigar">cigar</a>". is Mayan for "tobacco" and means "to smoke tobacco leaves". This is the most likely origin for cigar and thus cigarette.

The English word "<a href="hurricane">hurricane</a>", which is a borrowing from the Spanish word is considered to be related to the name of Maya storm deity <a href="Huracan">Jun Raqan</a>. However, it is probable that the word passed into European languages from a <a href="Cariban%20languages">Cariban language</a> or <a href="Ta%C3%ADno%20language">Taíno</a>.

 The complex script used to write Mayan languages in pre-Columbian times and known today from engravings at several Maya archaeological sites has been deciphered almost completely. The script is a mix between a logographic and a syllabic system.

In colonial times Mayan languages came to be written in a script derived from the Latin alphabet; orthographies were developed mostly by missionary grammarians. Not all modern Mayan languages have standardized orthographies, but the Mayan languages of Guatemala use a standardized, Latin-based phonemic spelling system developed by the <a href="Academia%20de%20Lenguas%20Mayas%20de%20Guatemala">Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala</a> (ALMG). Orthographies for the languages of Mexico are currently being developed by the <a href="Instituto%20Nacional%20de%20Lenguas%20Ind%C3%ADgenas">Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas</a> (INALI).

The pre-Columbian <a href="Maya%20civilization">Maya civilization</a> developed and used an intricate and fully functional <a href="writing%20system">writing system</a>, which is the only <a href="Mesoamerican%20writing%20systems">Mesoamerican script</a> that can be said to be almost fully deciphered. Earlier-established civilizations to the west and north of the Maya homelands that also had scripts recorded in surviving inscriptions include the <a href="Zapotec%20civilization">Zapotec</a>, <a href="Olmec">Olmec</a>, and the <a href="Zoque%20languages">Zoque</a>-speaking peoples of the southern <a href="Veracruz">Veracruz</a> and western Chiapas area—but their scripts are as yet largely undeciphered. It is generally agreed that the Maya writing system was adapted from one or more of these earlier systems. A number of references identify the undeciphered <a href="Olmec%20hieroglyphs">Olmec script</a> as its most likely precursor.

In the course of the deciphering of the Maya hieroglyphic script, scholars have come to understand that it was a fully functioning writing system in which it was possible to express unambiguously any sentence of the spoken language. The system is of a type best classified as <a href="logosyllabary">logosyllabic</a>, in which symbols (<a href="glyph">glyph</a>s or "<a href="grapheme">grapheme</a>s") can be used as either <a href="logogram">logogram</a>s or <a href="syllable">syllable</a>s. The script has a complete <a href="syllabary">syllabary</a> (although not all possible syllables have yet been identified), and a Maya scribe would have been able to write anything <a href="phonetic">phonetic</a>ally, syllable by syllable, using these symbols.

At least two major Mayan languages have been confidently identified in hieroglyphic texts, with at least one other language probably identified. An archaic language variety known as <a href="Classic%20Maya%20language">Classic Maya</a> predominates in these texts, particularly in the Classic-era inscriptions of the southern and central lowland areas. This language is most closely related to the Chʼolan branch of the language family, modern descendants of which include Chʼol, Chʼortiʼ and Chontal. Inscriptions in an early Yucatecan language (the ancestor of the main surviving <a href="Yucatec%20language">Yucatec language</a>) have also been recognised or proposed, mainly in the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a> region and from a later period. Three of the four extant <a href="Maya%20codices">Maya codices</a> are based on Yucatec. It has also been surmised that some inscriptions found in the <a href="Chiapas%20highlands">Chiapas highlands</a> region may be in a Tzeltalan language whose modern descendants are Tzeltal and Tzotzil. Other regional varieties and dialects are also presumed to have been used, but have not yet been identified with certainty.

Use and knowledge of the Maya script continued until the 16th century <a href="Spanish%20conquest%20of%20Yucat%C3%A1n">Spanish conquest</a> at least. Bishop <a href="Diego%20de%20Landa%20Calder%C3%B3n">Diego de Landa Calderón</a> of the <a href="Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Yucat%C3%A1n">Catholic Archdiocese of Yucatán</a> prohibited the use of the written language, effectively ending the Mesoamerican tradition of literacy in the native script. He worked with the Spanish colonizers to destroy the bulk of Mayan texts as part of his efforts to <a href="religious%20conversion">convert</a> the locals to <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> and away from what he perceived as <a href="pagan">pagan</a> idolatry. Later he described the use of hieroglyphic writing in the religious practices of Yucatecan Maya in his "<a href="Relaci%C3%B3n%20de%20las%20cosas%20de%20Yucat%C3%A1n">Relación de las cosas de Yucatán</a>".

Colonial orthography is marked by the use of "c" for /k/ (always hard, as in "cic" /kiik/), "k" for /q/ in Guatemala or for /kʼ/ in the Yucatán, "h" for /x/, and "tz" for /ts/; the absence of glottal stop or vowel length (apart sometimes for a double vowel letter for a long glottalized vowel, as in "uuc" /uʼuk/), the use of "u" for /w/, as in "uac" /wak/, and the variable use of "z, ç, s" for /s/. The greatest difference from modern orthography, however, is in the various attempts to transcribe the ejective consonants.

In ca. 1550, Francisco de la Parra invented distinctive letters for ejectives in the Mayan languages of Guatemala, the "<a href="tresillo">tresillo</a>" and "<a href="cuatrillo">cuatrillo</a>" (and derivatives). These were used in all subsequent Franciscan writing, and are occasionally seen even today. In 1605, Alonso Urbano doubled consonants for ejectives in <a href="Otomi%20language">Otomi</a> ("pp, tt, ttz, cc / cqu"), and similar systems were adapted to Mayan. Another approach, in Yucatec, was to add a bar to the letter, or to double the stem.
<nowiki>*</nowiki>Only the stem of 𝕡 is doubled, but that is not supported by Unicode.

A ligature ꜩ for "tz" is used alongside ꜭ and ꜫ. The Yucatec convention of "dz" for is retained in Maya family names such as <a href="Dzib">Dzib</a>.

Since the colonial period, practically all Maya writing has used a <a href="Latin%20script">Latin alphabet</a>. Formerly these were based largely on the <a href="Spanish%20alphabet">Spanish alphabet</a> and varied between authors, and it is only recently that standardized alphabets have been established. The first widely accepted alphabet was created for Yucatec Maya by the authors and contributors of the "Diccionario Maya Cordemex", a project directed by <a href="Alfredo%20Barrera%20V%C3%A1squez">Alfredo Barrera Vásquez</a> and first published in 1980. Subsequently, the <a href="Guatemalan%20Academy%20of%20Mayan%20Languages">Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages</a> (known by its Spanish acronym ALMG), founded in 1986, adapted these standards to 22 Mayan languages (primarily in Guatemala). The script is largely phonemic, but abandoned the distinction between the apostrophe for ejective consonants and the glottal stop, so that ejective and the non-ejective sequence (previously "tʼ "and "t7") are both written "tʼ." Other major Maya languages, primarily in the Mexican state of Chiapas, such as Tzotzil, Tzeltal, Chʼol, and Tojolabʼal, are not generally included in this reformation, and are sometimes written with the conventions standardized by the Chiapan "State Center for Indigenous Language, Art, and Literature" (CELALI), which for instance writes "ts" rather than "tz" (thus Tseltal and Tsotsil). In Mexico, names of archaeological sites and other items of historical record retain the colonial spellings, rather than the revised orthography.

One element of the revised orthographies that is not widely accepted, especially outside the Guatemalan context, is the conversion of proper nouns (such as names of archaeological sites, modern settlements, and cultures). Thus, the "Cordemex" continues to use the term "Yucatán" (rather than "Yukatan") in its preface, despite the fact that its orthography does not utilize a "c", and most scholarly archaeological texts continue to print the original spellings for archaeological sites and cultures that have been canonized in the literature over the centuries.

From the classic language to the present day, a body of literature has been written in Mayan languages. The earliest texts to have been preserved are largely monumental inscriptions documenting rulership, succession, and ascension, conquest and calendrical and astronomical events. It is likely that other kinds of literature were written in perishable media such as <a href="Mayan%20codices">codices</a> made of <a href="amate">bark</a>, only four of which have survived the ravages of time and the campaign of destruction by Spanish missionaries.

Shortly after the <a href="Spanish%20conquest%20of%20Mexico">Spanish conquest</a>, the Mayan languages began to be written with Latin letters. Colonial-era literature in Mayan languages include the famous "<a href="Popol%20Vuh">Popol Vuh</a>", a mythico-historical narrative written in 17th century Classical Quiché but believed to be based on an earlier work written in the 1550s, now lost. The "<a href="T%C3%ADtulo%20de%20Totonicap%C3%A1n">Título de Totonicapán</a>" and the 17th century theatrical work the "<a href="Rabinal%20Ach%C3%AD">Rabinal Achí</a>" are other notable early works in Kʼicheʼ, the latter in the <a href="Achi%20language">Achí dialect</a>. The "<a href="Annals%20of%20the%20Cakchiquels">Annals of the Cakchiquels</a>" from the late 16th century, which provides a historical narrative of the Kaqchikel, contains elements paralleling some of the accounts appearing in the "Popol Vuh". The historical and prophetical accounts in the several variations known collectively as the books of <a href="Chilam%20Balam">Chilam Balam</a> are primary sources of early Yucatec Maya traditions. The only surviving book of early lyric poetry, the <a href="Songs%20of%20Dzitbalche">Songs of Dzitbalche</a> by Ah Bam, comes from this same period.

In addition to these singular works, many early grammars of indigenous languages, called ""artes"", were written by priests and friars. Languages covered by these early grammars include Kaqchikel, Classical Quiché, Tzeltal, Tzotzil and Yucatec. Some of these came with indigenous-language translations of the Catholic catechism.

While Mayan peoples continued to produce a rich oral literature in the postcolonial period (after 1821), very little written literature was produced in this period.

Because indigenous languages were excluded from the education systems of Mexico and Guatemala after independence, Mayan peoples remained largely illiterate in their native languages, learning to read and write in Spanish, if at all. However, since the establishment of the Cordemex and the Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages (1986), native language literacy has begun to spread and a number of indigenous writers have started a new tradition of writing in Mayan languages. Notable among this new generation is the Kʼicheʼ poet <a href="Humberto%20Ak%CA%BCab%CA%BCal">Humberto Akʼabʼal</a>, whose works are often published in dual-language Spanish/Kʼicheʼ editions, as well as Kʼicheʼ scholar <a href="Luis%20Enrique%20Sam%20Colop">Luis Enrique Sam Colop</a> (1955–2011) whose translations of the <a href="Popol%20Vuh">Popol Vuh</a> into both Spanish and modern Kʼicheʼ achieved high acclaim.

In 2007, the Tussauds Group was purchased by <a href="The%20Blackstone%20Group">The Blackstone Group</a> which merged it with <a href="Merlin%20Entertainments">Merlin Entertainments</a>; Warwick Castle was then sold to <a href="Nick%20Leslau">Nick Leslau</a>'s investment firm Prestbury Group under a sale and leaseback agreement. Merlin continues to operate the site under a renewable 35-year lease.

Warwick Castle is situated in the town of Warwick, on a <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> <a href="Cliff">bluff</a> at a bend of the River Avon. The river, which runs below the castle on the east side, has eroded the rock the castle stands on, forming a cliff. The river and cliff form natural defences. When construction began in 1068, four houses belonging to the <a href="History%20of%20Coventry%23Early%20history">Abbot of Coventry</a> were demolished to provide space. The castle's position made it strategically important in safeguarding the Midlands against rebellion. During the 12th century, King <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a> was suspicious of <a href="Roger%20de%20Beaumont%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Roger de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Warwick</a>. To counter the earl's influence, Henry bestowed <a href="Geoffrey%20de%20Clinton">Geoffrey de Clinton</a> with a position of power rivalling that of the earl. The lands he was given included <a href="Kenilworth%20Castle">Kenilworth</a> – a castle of comparable size, cost, and importance, founded by Clinton – which is about to the north. Warwick Castle is about from <a href="Warwick%20railway%20station">Warwick railway station</a> and less than from junction 15 of the <a href="M40%20motorway">M40 motorway</a>; it is also close to <a href="Birmingham%20Airport">Birmingham Airport</a>.

An Anglo-Saxon <a href="burh">burh</a> was established on the site in 914; with fortifications instigated by <a href="%C3%86thelfl%C3%A6d">Æthelflæd</a>, daughter of <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>. The burh she established was one of ten which defended <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a> against the invading <a href="Danes%20%28Germanic%20tribe%29">Danes</a>. Its position allowed it to dominate the <a href="Fosse%20Way">Fosse Way</a>, as well as the river valley and the crossing over the River Avon. Though the motte to the south-west of the present castle is now called "Ethelfleda's Mound" ('Ethelfleda' being an alternative form of Æthelflæd), it is in fact part of the later Norman fortifications, and not of Anglo-Saxon origin.

It was also at this time that what is now <a href="Warwick%20School">Warwick School</a> was founded in the castle - making it arguably the oldest boys' school in the country. It still resides just over the river Avon, but a stone's throw away, and visible from all of the castle's towers.

After the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman conquest of England</a>, William the Conqueror established a <a href="motte-and-bailey">motte-and-bailey</a> castle at Warwick in 1068 to maintain control of the Midlands as he advanced northwards. Building a castle in a pre-existing settlement could require demolishing properties on the intended site. In the case of Warwick, the least recorded of the 11 urban castles in the <a href="Domesday%20Book">1086 survey</a>, four houses were torn down to make way for the castle. A motte-and-bailey castle consists of a mound – on which usually stands a <a href="keep">keep</a> or tower – and a bailey, which is an enclosed courtyard. William appointed <a href="Henry%20de%20Beaumont%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Henry de Beaumont</a>, the son of a powerful Norman family, as <a href="constable">constable</a> of the castle. In 1088, Henry de Beaumont was made the first <a href="Earl%20of%20Warwick">Earl of Warwick</a>. He founded the Church of All Saints within the castle walls by 1119; the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Bishop of Worcester</a>, believing that a castle was an inappropriate location for a church, removed it in 1127–28.

In 1153, the wife of <a href="Roger%20de%20Beaumont%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Roger de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Warwick</a>, was tricked into believing that her husband was dead, and surrendered control of the castle to the invading army of <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry of Anjou</a>, later King Henry II of England. According to the "<a href="Deeds%20of%20King%20Stephen">Gesta Regis Stephani</a>", a 12th-century historical text, Roger de Beaumont died upon hearing the news that his wife had handed over the castle. King Henry II later returned the castle to the Earls of Warwick, as they had been supporters of his mother, <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Empress Matilda</a>, in <a href="The%20Anarchy">The Anarchy</a> of 1135–1154.
During the reign of King Henry II (1154–89), the motte-and-bailey was replaced with a stone keep castle. This new <a href="archaeological%20phase">phase</a> took the form of a shell keep with all the buildings constructed against the <a href="Curtain%20wall%20%28fortification%29">curtain wall</a>. During the <a href="Revolt%20of%201173%E2%80%931174">Barons' Rebellion of 1173–74</a>, the Earl of Warwick remained loyal to King Henry II, and the castle was used to store provisions. The castle and the lands associated with the earldom passed down to the Beaumont family until 1242. When <a href="Thomas%20de%20Beaumont%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Thomas de Beaumont, 6th Earl of Warwick</a> died, the castle and lands passed to his sister, <a href="Margaret%20de%20Newburg%2C%20Countess%20of%20Warwick">Margaret de Beaumont, 7th Countess of Warwick in her own right</a>. Her first husband, John Marshal, died soon after, and while she looked for a suitable husband, the castle was in the ownership of King <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III of England</a>. When she married John du Plessis in December 1242, the castle was returned to her. During the <a href="Second%20Barons%27%20War">Second Barons' War</a> of 1264–67, <a href="William%20Maudit%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">William Maudit, 8th Earl of Warwick</a>, was a supporter of King Henry III. The castle was taken in a surprise attack by the forces of <a href="Simon%20de%20Montfort%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester</a>, from <a href="Kenilworth%20Castle">Kenilworth Castle</a> in 1264. According to 15th-century chronicler <a href="John%20Rous%20%28historian%29">John Rous</a>, the walls along the northeastern side of Warwick Castle were <a href="slighting">slighted</a>, so "that it should be no strength to the king". Maudit and his countess were taken to Kenilworth Castle and were held there until a ransom was paid. After the death of William Maudit in 1267, the title and castle passed to his nephew, <a href="William%20de%20Beauchamp%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick</a>. Following William's death, Warwick Castle passed through seven generations of the Beauchamp family, who, over the next 180 years, were responsible for most of the additions made to the castle. In 1312, <a href="Piers%20Gaveston%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Cornwall">Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall</a>, was captured by <a href="Guy%20de%20Beauchamp%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick</a>, and imprisoned in Warwick Castle, until his execution on 9 June 1312. A group of <a href="magnate">magnate</a>s led by the Earl of Warwick and <a href="Thomas%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Lancaster">Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster</a>, accused Gaveston of stealing the royal treasure.

Under <a href="Thomas%20de%20Beauchamp%2C%2011th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl</a>, the castle defences were significantly enhanced in 1330–60 on the north eastern side by the addition of a <a href="gatehouse">gatehouse</a>, a <a href="barbican">barbican</a> (a form of fortified gateway), and a tower on either side of the reconstructed wall, named Caesar's Tower and Guy's Tower. The Watergate Tower also dates from this period.
Caesar's and Guy's Towers are residential and may have been inspired by French models (for example <a href="Bricquebec">Bricquebec</a>). Both towers are <a href="machicolation">machicolated</a> and Caesar's Tower features a unique double parapet. The two towers are also vaulted in stone on every storey. Caesar's Tower contained a grim basement <a href="dungeon">dungeon</a>; according to local legend dating back to at least 1644 it is also known as Poitiers Tower, either because prisoners from the <a href="Battle%20of%20Poitiers">Battle of Poitiers</a> in 1356 may have been imprisoned there, or because the ransoms raised from the battle helped to pay for its construction. The gatehouse features <a href="murder%20holes">murder holes</a>, two <a href="drawbridge">drawbridge</a>s, a gate, and <a href="portcullis">portcullis</a>es – gates made from wood or metal. The towers of the gatehouse were machicolated.

The facade overlooking the river was designed as a symbol of the power and wealth of the Beauchamp earls and would have been "of minimal defensive value"; this followed a trend of 14th-century castles being more statements of power than designed exclusively for military use.

The line of the Beauchamp Earls ended in 1449 when <a href="Anne%20de%20Beauchamp%2C%2015th%20Countess%20of%20Warwick">Anne de Beauchamp, 15th Countess of Warwick</a>, died. <a href="Richard%20Neville%2C%2016th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Richard Neville, the "Kingmaker"</a>, became the next Earl of Warwick through his wife's inheritance of the title. During the summer of 1469, Neville rebelled against King <a href="Edward%20IV%20of%20England">Edward IV of England</a> and imprisoned him in Warwick Castle. Neville attempted to rule in the King's name; however, constant protests by the King's supporters forced the Earl to release King Edward IV. Neville was subsequently killed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Barnet">Battle of Barnet</a>, fighting against the King in 1471 during the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>. Warwick Castle then passed from Neville to his son-in-law, <a href="George%20Plantagenet%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Clarence">George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence</a> (brother of King Edward IV). George Plantagenet was executed in 1478, and his lands passed onto his son, <a href="Edward%20Plantagenet%2C%2017th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick</a>; however, Edward Plantagenet was only two when his father died, so his lands were taken in the custody of <a href="The%20Crown">The Crown</a>. He was placed under attainder, and so could not inherit the throne, by King <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII of England</a>, being held by the King for fourteen years in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> until he was executed for <a href="high%20treason">high treason</a> in 1499, supposedly for conspiring to escape with the 'pretender' <a href="Perkin%20Warbeck">Perkin Warbeck</a>. Edward was the last Earl of Warwick of the title's first creation.

In the early 1480s, King <a href="Richard%20III%20of%20England">Richard III of England</a> (the other son-in-law of Neville) instigated the construction of two gun towers, Bear and Clarence Towers, which were left unfinished on his death in 1485; with their own well and ovens, the towers were an independent stronghold from the rest of the castle, possibly in case of mutiny by the <a href="garrison">garrison</a>. With the advent of gunpowder, the position of Keeper of the Artillery was created in 1486.
When <a href="antiquary">antiquary</a> <a href="John%20Leland%20%28antiquary%29">John Leland</a> visited the castle some time between 1535 and 1543, he noted that:

While in the care of The Crown, Warwick Castle underwent repairs and renovations using about 500 loads of stone. The castle, as well as lands associated with the earldom, was in Crown care from 1478 until 1547, when they were granted to <a href="John%20Dudley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland">John Dudley</a> with the second creation of the title the Earl of Warwick. When making his appeal for ownership of the castle Dudley said of the castle's condition: "... the castle of its self is not able to lodge a good baron with his train, for all the one side of the said castle with also the dungeon tower is clearly ruinated and down to the ground".

Warwick Castle had fallen into decay due to its age and neglect, and despite his remarks Dudley did not initiate any repairs to the castle. <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth I</a> visited the castle in 1566 during a <a href="Royal%20Entry">tour of the country</a>, and again in 1572 for four nights. A timber building was erected in the castle for her to stay in, and <a href="Ambrose%20Dudley%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick</a>, left the castle to the Queen during her visits. When Ambrose Dudley died in 1590 the title of Earl of Warwick became extinct for the second time. A survey from 1590 recorded that the castle was still in a state of disrepair, noting that lead had been stolen from the roofs of some of the castle's buildings, including the chapel. In 1601 Sir Fulke Greville remarked that "the little stone building there was, mightily in decay ... so as in very short time there will be nothing left but a name of Warwick". Greville was granted Warwick Castle by King James I in 1604.

In the 17th century the grounds were turned into a garden. The castle's defences were enhanced in the 1640s to prepare the castle for action in the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>. <a href="Robert%20Greville%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Brooke">Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke</a>, was a <a href="Roundhead">Parliamentarian</a>, and <a href="Cavalier">Royalist</a> forces laid siege to the castle. Warwick Castle withstood the siege and was later used to hold prisoners taken by the Parliamentarians.

The conversion of the castle coincided with a period of decline in the use of castles during the 15th and 16th centuries; many were either being abandoned or converted into comfortable residences for the gentry. In the early 17th century, <a href="Robert%20Smythson">Robert Smythson</a> was commissioned to draw a plan of the castle before any changes were made. In 1604, the ruinous castle was given to Sir Fulke Greville by <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">King James I</a> and was converted into a country house. Whilst the castle was undergoing repairs, it was peripherally involved in the <a href="Gunpowder%20Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a> of 1605. The conspirators involved awaited news of their plot in <a href="Dunchurch">Dunchurch</a> in Warwickshire. When they discovered the plot had failed they stole cavalry horses from the stables at Warwick Castle to help in their escape. When the title of Earl of Warwick was created for the third time in 1618, the Greville family were still in possession of Warwick Castle. Fulke Greville spent over £20,000 (£ as of ). renovating the castle; according to <a href="William%20Dugdale">William Dugdale</a>, a 17th-century antiquary, this made it "a place not only of great strength but extraordinary delight, with most pleasant gardens, walks and thickets, such as this part of England can hardly parallel". 

On 1 September 1628 Fulke Greville was murdered in <a href="Holborn">Holborn</a> by his <a href="manservant">manservant</a>: Ralph Haywood—a "gentleman"—who stabbed the baron twice after discovering he had been left only £8,000 in Greville's will. Greville died from his wounds four weeks later.
Under <a href="Robert%20Greville%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Brooke">Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke</a>, Warwick Castle's defences were enhanced from January to May 1642 in preparation for attack during the <a href="First%20English%20Civil%20War">First English Civil War</a>. The garden walls were raised, <a href="Glossary%20of%20architecture%23B">bulwarks</a>—barricades of beams and soil to mount artillery—were constructed and gunpowder and wheels for two <a href="cannon">cannon</a>s were obtained. Robert Greville was a <a href="Roundhead">Parliamentarian</a>, and on 7 August 1642 a <a href="Cavalier">Royalist</a> force laid <a href="siege">siege</a> to the castle. Greville was not in the castle at the time and the garrison was under the command of Sir Edward Peyto. <a href="Spencer%20Compton%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Northampton">Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton</a>, <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20Warwickshire">Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire</a> commanded the <a href="Cavalier">Royalist</a> force. <a href="William%20Dugdale">William Dugdale</a>, acting as a herald, called for the garrison commander to surrender the castle, but he was refused. The besieging army opened fire on the castle, to little effect. According to <a href="Richard%20Bulstrode">Richard Bulstrode</a>:

The siege was lifted on 23 August 1642 when the garrison was relieved by the forces of <a href="Robert%20Devereux%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Essex">Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex</a>, and the Royalists were forced to retreat to <a href="Worcester">Worcester</a>. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Edgehill">Battle of Edgehill</a> in 1642 – the first pitched battle of the English Civil War – prisoners were held in Caesar's and Guy's Towers. During the <a href="Second%20English%20Civil%20War">Second English Civil War</a> prisoners were again held at the castle, including those from the <a href="Battle%20of%20Worcester">Battle of Worcester</a> in 1651. A garrison was maintained in the castle complete with artillery and supplies from 1643 to 1660, at its strongest it numbered 302 soldiers. In 1660 the <a href="English%20Council%20of%20State">English Council of State</a> ordered the castle governor to disband the garrison and hand over the castle to Robert Greville, 4th Baron Brooke. The state apartments were found to be outmoded and in poor repair. Under Roger and William Hurlbutt, master carpenters of Warwick, extensive modernization of the interiors was undertaken, 1669–78. To ensure that they would be in the latest taste, William was sent down to Dorset to make careful notes of the interiors recently finished at <a href="Kingston%20Lacy">Kingston Lacy</a> for Sir Ralph Bankes to designs by <a href="Roger%20Pratt%20%28architect%29">Sir Roger Pratt</a>. On 4 November 1695 the castle was in sufficient state to host a visit by <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">King William III</a>.
<a href="Francis%20Greville%2C%208th%20Baron%20Brooke">Francis Greville, 8th Baron Brooke</a>, undertook a renewed programme of improvements to Warwick Castle and its grounds. The 8th Baron Brooke was also bestowed with the title Earl of Warwick in 1759, the fourth creation of the title. With the recreation of the title, the castle was back in the ownership of the earls of Warwick. <a href="Daniel%20Garrett">Daniel Garrett</a>'s work at Warwick is documented in 1748; <a href="Howard%20Colvin">Howard Colvin</a> attributed to him the <a href="Gothic%20Revival">Gothick</a> interior of the Chapel. <a href="Lancelot%20Brown">Lancelot "Capability" Brown</a> had been on hand since 1749. Brown, who was still head gardener at Stowe at the time and had yet to make his reputation as the main exponent of the <a href="English%20landscape%20garden">English landscape garden</a>, was called in by Lord Brooke to give Warwick Castle a more "natural" connection to its river. Brown simplified the long narrow stretch by sweeping it into a lawn that dropped right to the riverbank, stopped at each end by bold clumps of native trees. A serpentine drive gave an impression of greater distance between the front gates and the castle entrance.

<a href="Horace%20Walpole">Horace Walpole</a> saw Brown's maturing scheme in 1751 and remarked in a letter: "The castle is enchanting. The view pleased me more than I can express; the river Avon tumbled down a cascade at the foot of it. It is well laid out by one Brown who has set up on a few ideas of <a href="William%20Kent">Kent</a> and <a href="Philip%20Southcote">Mr Southcote</a>."

In 1754 the poet <a href="Thomas%20Gray">Thomas Gray</a>, a member of Walpole's Gothicising circle, commented disdainfully on the activity at the castle:

Gray's mention of Argyle Buildings, Westminster, London, elicited a connotation of an inappropriately modern Georgian urban development, for the buildings in Argyll Street were a speculation to designs of <a href="James%20Gibbs">James Gibbs</a>, 1736–40.

Greville commissioned Italian painter <a href="Canaletto">Antonio Canaletto</a> to paint Warwick Castle in 1747, while the castle grounds and gardens were undergoing landscaping by Brown. Five paintings and three drawings of the castle by Canaletto are known, making it the artist's most often represented building in Britain. Canaletto's work on Warwick Castle has been described as "unique in the history of art as a series of views of an English house by a major continental master". As well as the gardens, Greville commissioned Brown to rebuild the exterior entrance porch and stairway to the Great Hall. Brown also contributed Gothick designs for a wooden bridge over the Avon (1758). He was still at work on Warwick Castle in 1760. Timothy Lightoler was responsible for the porch being extended and extra rooms added adjacent to it in 1763–69. and during the same years William Lindley provided a new Dining Room and other interior alterations. In 1786–88 the local builder William Eboral was commissioned to build the new greenhouse conservatory, with as its principal ornament the <a href="Warwick%20Vase">Warwick Vase</a>, recently purchased in Rome.

In 1802 <a href="George%20Greville%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">George Greville, 2nd Earl of Warwick</a> of the new creation, had debts amounting to £115,000 (£ as of ). The earl's estates, including Warwick Castle, were given to the <a href="Earl%20of%20Galloway">Earl of Galloway</a> and <a href="John%20FitzPatrick%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Upper%20Ossory">John FitzPatrick, 2nd Earl of Upper Ossory</a>, in 1806, but the castle was returned to the earls of Warwick in 1813. The Great Hall was reroofed and repaired in Gothic taste in 1830–31 by <a href="Ambrose%20Poynter">Ambrose Poynter</a>. <a href="Anthony%20Salvin">Anthony Salvin</a> was responsible for restoring the Watergate Tower in 1861–63. The castle was extensively damaged by a fire in 1871 that started to the east of the Great Hall. Although the Great Hall was gutted, the overall structure was unharmed. Restoration and reparations carried out by Salvin during 1872–75 were subsidised by donations from the public, which raised a total of £9,651 (£ as of ).

Individuals had been visiting the castle since the end of the 17th century and this grew in importance through the 19th century. In 1858 <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> visited the <a href="George%20Greville%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">4th earl</a> with great local celebrations. However, by 1885 it would appear the visitors were becoming a nuisance as the earl closed the castle to visitors, causing consternation in the town. A local report stated, "One day last week eight American visitors who were staying at one of the principal hotels left somewhat hurriedly in consequence of their being unable to gain admission to the castle". It soon re-opened again and by 1900 had a ticket office and was employing a permanent guide. By 1936 <a href="Arthur%20Mee">Arthur Mee</a> was enthusing not just that "these walls have seen something of the splendour of every generation of our [English] story", with rooms "rich in treasure beyond the dreams of avarice" but also that "their rooms are open to all who will". The collection of armoury on display at Warwick Castle is regarded as second only to that of the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>.

Through the 20th century successive earls expanded its tourism potential until, in 1978, after 374 years in the Greville family, it was sold to a media and entertainment company, <a href="the%20Tussauds%20Group">the Tussauds Group</a> for £1.3 million, who opened it as a tourist attraction. Tussauds performed extensive restorations to the castle and grounds. In 12 of the apartments open to tourists since the Tussauds Group takeover, a number of wax figures of historic individuals is presented. The persons depicted were guests at the 1898 weekend party hosted by Frances Countess of Warwick; the principal guest was the Prince of Wales, later <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>. The furniture in those rooms is said to be authentic to the period.

In 2001, Warwick Castle was named one of Britain's "Top 10 historic houses and monuments" by the British Tourist Authority; the list included <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>, <a href="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>, and <a href="Edinburgh%20Castle">Edinburgh Castle</a>. Warwick Castle was recognised as Britain's best castle by the "Good Britain Guide 2003". Around this time it was getting in excess of half a million visitors a year.

After the March 2007 sale of the castle's owner, The Tussauds Group, to <a href="The%20Blackstone%20Group">The Blackstone Group</a>, the site was operated by <a href="Merlin%20Entertainments">Merlin Entertainments</a>, a division of that corporation. In July of that year, Warwick Castle was sold to the Prestbury Group
but continued to be operated by Merlin under a renewable 35-year lease.

The castle is protected against unauthorised change as a <a href="Scheduled%20Ancient%20Monument">Scheduled Ancient Monument</a> in recognition of its status as a "nationally important" <a href="archaeological%20site">archaeological site</a> or historic building, and is a Grade I <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> together with its boundary walls, stables, conservatory, mill and lodge.

On 23 June 2006, a £20,000 stained glass window was damaged by teenage vandals and a ceremonial sword stolen, recovered soon after.

In June 2005, Warwick Castle became home to one of the world's largest working <a href="siege%20engine">siege engine</a>s. The <a href="trebuchet">trebuchet</a> is tall, made from over 300 pieces of oak and weighs . It sits on the riverbank below the castle.

The machine was built with drawings from the Danish <a href="living%20history">living history</a> museum <a href="Middelaldercentret">Middelaldercentret</a>, who, in 1989, were the first to recreate a fully functioning trebuchet. It was built in <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> with expertise from the Danish museum.

The trebuchet takes eight men half an hour to load and release. The process involves four men running in tall <a href="treadwheel">treadwheel</a>s to lift the counterweight, weighing , into the air. It is designed to be capable of hurling projectiles of up to distances of up to and as high as .

On 21 August 2006, the trebuchet claimed the record as the most powerful siege engine of its type when it sent a projectile weighing a distance of at a speed of , beating the previous record held by the trebuchet at Middelaldercentret in Denmark.

On 10 April 2015 a thatched boathouse caught fire shortly after a burning cannonball was fired by the trebuchet. It was reported that a spark from the cannonball had started the blaze although a castle spokeswoman said the cause had not yet been established. Hundreds of tourists were evacuated from the castle, but the spokeswoman said they were not at any risk. "The Daily Telegraph" described the boathouse as "historic", "medieval" and dating to 1896, when the <a href="Francis%20Greville%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">5th Earl</a> had it built to house an electric boat.

Other tourist attractions include "Flight of the Eagles'" (a bird show, featuring <a href="bald%20eagles">bald eagles</a>, <a href="vultures">vultures</a>, and <a href="sea%20eagle">sea eagles),</a> archery displays, Jousting,"The Trebuchet Show" and "The Sword in the Stone Show". The Castle is also home to "The Castle Dungeon", a live actor experience similar to that of "London Dungeons". Warwick Castle is the subject of many ghost stories. One such instance is that of Fulke Greville who is said to haunt the Watergate Tower despite having been murdered in Holborn. The castle's reputation for being haunted is used as a tourist attraction with events such as "Warwick Ghosts Alive", a live-action show telling the story of Fulke Greville's murder. Musical events at the castle have included <a href="Carol%20%28music%29">carolling</a>, with performances by bands such as the <a href="Royal%20Spa%20Brass">Royal Spa Brass</a>.

At times during Summer 2018, the castle offered its War of the Roses event with jousting and other action. On certain dates in August, Dragon Slayer evenings were scheduled, with dining, a projection light show, pyrotechnics, fire jousting and live action stunts.

The current castle, built in stone during the reign of King Henry II, is on the same site as the earlier Norman motte-and-bailey castle. A <a href="keep">keep</a> used to stand on the motte which is on the south west of the site, although most of the structure now dates from the post-medieval period. In the 17th century the motte was landscaped with the addition of a path. The <a href="Ward%20%28fortification%29">bailey</a> was incorporated into the new castle and is surrounded by stone curtain walls.

When Warwick Castle was rebuilt in the reign of King Henry II it had a new layout with the buildings against the curtain walls. The castle is surrounded by a dry moat on the northern side where there is no protection from the river or the old motte; the perimeter of the walls is long by wide. The two entrances to castle are in the north and west walls. There was originally a <a href="drawbridge">drawbridge</a> over the moat in the north east. In the centre of the north west wall is a gateway with Clarence and Bears towers on either side; this is a 15th-century addition to the fortifications of the castle. The residential buildings line the eastern side of the castle, facing the River Avon. These buildings include the great hall, the library, bedrooms, and the chapel.

Over its 950 years of history Warwick Castle has been owned by 36 different individuals, plus four periods as crown property under seven different monarchs. It was the family seat of three separate creations of the Earls of Warwick, and has been a family home for members of the Beaumont, Beauchamp, Neville, Plantagenet, Dudley and Greville families. The first creation of the Earldom specifically included the right of inheritance through the female line, so the castle three times had a woman (or girl) as the owner. Eleven of the owners were under 20 when they inherited, including a girl aged two and a boy aged three. At least three owners died in battle, two were executed and one murdered. Every century except the 21st has seen major building work or adaptations at the castle.

Formal gardens belonging to Warwick Castle were first recorded in 1534. Landscaping in the 17th century added spiral paths to the castle motte during Fulke Greville's programme of restoration. Francis Greville commissioned Lancelot Brown to re-landscape the castle grounds; he began working on the grounds and park in 1749 and had completed his work by 1757, having spent about £2,293 (£ as of ). on the project. The gardens cover . <a href="Robert%20Marnock">Robert Marnock</a> created formal gardens in the castle's grounds in 1868–69.
Started in 1743 and originally known as Temple Park, Castle Park is located to the south of the castle. Its original name derived from the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Knights Templar</a>, who used to own a <a href="manorialism">manor</a> in Warwick. Houses around the perimeter of the park were demolished and the land they stood on incorporated into the park. Attempts to make profits from the park in the late 18th century included leasing it for grazing, growing wheat, and keeping sheep.

A water-powered mill in the castle grounds was probably built under Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick. By 1398 the mill had been relocated to just outside the eastern castle walls, on the west bank of the River Avon. Both mills were subject to flooding. By 1644, an engine house had been added to the mill. The mill was reused as an electricity generating plant after it had stopped being used to grind, but once Warwick Castle was fitted with <a href="mains%20electricity">mains electricity</a> in 1940, the mill was no longer required and was dismantled in 1954. Adjacent to the mill is <a href="The%20Mill%20Garden">The Mill Garden</a> which is privately owned but open to the public. Interesting views of the castle can be seen from this garden.

Frigatebird

Frigatebirds (also listed as "frigate bird", "frigate-bird", "frigate", "frigate-petrel") are a <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> of <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s called Fregatidae which are found across all <a href="tropical">tropical</a> and subtropical oceans. The five extant species are classified in a single genus, Fregata. All have predominantly black plumage, long, deeply forked tails and long hooked bills. Females have white underbellies and males have a distinctive red <a href="gular%20pouch">gular pouch</a>, which they inflate during the breeding season to attract females. Their wings are long and pointed and can span up to , the largest wing area to body weight ratio of any bird.

Able to soar for weeks on wind currents, frigatebirds spend most of the day in flight hunting for food, and roost on trees or cliffs at night. Their main prey are fish and <a href="squid">squid</a>, caught when chased to the water surface by large predators such as <a href="tuna">tuna</a>. Frigatebirds are referred to as <a href="Kleptoparasitism">kleptoparasites</a> as they occasionally rob other seabirds for food, and are known to snatch seabird chicks from the nest. Seasonally monogamous, frigatebirds nest <a href="Bird%20colony">colonially</a>. A rough nest is constructed in low trees or on the ground on remote islands. A single egg is laid each breeding season. The duration of parental care is among the longest of any bird species; frigatebirds are only able to breed every other year.

The Fregatidae are a <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a> to <a href="Suloidea">Suloidea</a> which consists of <a href="cormorant">cormorant</a>s, <a href="darter">darter</a>s, <a href="gannet">gannet</a>s, and <a href="Booby">boobies</a>. Three of the five extant species of frigatebirds are widespread, (the <a href="Magnificent%20frigatebird">magnificent</a>, <a href="Great%20frigatebird">great</a> and <a href="lesser%20frigatebird">lesser frigatebird</a>s) while two are endangered (the <a href="Christmas%20Island%20frigatebird">Christmas Island</a> and <a href="Ascension%20Island%20frigatebird">Ascension Island frigatebird</a>s) and restrict their breeding habitat to one small island each. The oldest fossils date to the early <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>, around 50 million years ago. Classified in the genus "<a href="Limnofregata">Limnofregata</a>", the three species had shorter, less-hooked bills and longer legs, and lived in a freshwater environment.

The term "Frigate Bird" itself was used in 1738 by the English naturalist and illustrator <a href="Eleazar%20Albin">Eleazar Albin</a> in his "A Natural History of the Birds". The book included an illustration of the male bird showing the red <a href="gular%20pouch">gular pouch</a>. Like the genus name, the English term is derived from the French mariners' name for the bird "la frégate"—a <a href="frigate">frigate</a> or fast warship. The etymology was mentioned by French naturalist <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Du%20Tertre">Jean-Baptiste Du Tertre</a> when describing the bird in 1667.

<a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> encountered frigatebirds when passing the <a href="Cape%20Verde%20Islands">Cape Verde Islands</a> on his first voyage across the Atlantic in 1492. In his journal entry for 29 September he used the word "rabiforçado", modern Spanish "rabihorcado" or forktail. In the Caribbean frigatebirds were called Man-of-War birds by English mariners. This name was used by the English explorer <a href="William%20Dampier">William Dampier</a> in his book "An Account of a New Voyage Around the World" published in 1697:
The Man-of-War (as it is called by the English) is about the bigness of a Kite, and in shape like it, but black; and the neck is red. It lives on Fish yet never lights on the water, but soars aloft like a Kite, and when it sees its prey, it flys down head foremost to the Waters edge, very swiftly takes its prey out of the Sea with his Bill, and immediately mounts again as swiftly; never touching the Water with his Bill. His Wings are very long; his feet are like other Land-fowl, and he builds on Trees, where he finds any; but where they are wanting on the ground.

Frigatebirds were grouped with <a href="cormorant">cormorant</a>s, and <a href="Sulidae">sulids</a> (<a href="gannet">gannet</a>s and <a href="booby">boobies</a>) as well as pelicans in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Pelecanus" by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in 1758 in the <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">tenth edition</a> of his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>". He described the distinguishing characteristics as a straight bill hooked at the tip, linear nostrils, a bare face, and fully webbed feet. The genus "Fregata" was defined by French naturalist <a href="Bernard%20Germain%20de%20Lac%C3%A9p%C3%A8de">Bernard Germain de Lacépède</a> in 1799. <a href="Louis%20Jean%20Pierre%20Vieillot">Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot</a> described the genus name "Tachypetes" in 1816 for the <a href="great%20frigatebird">great frigatebird</a>. The genus name "Atagen" had been coined by German naturalist <a href="Paul%20M%C3%B6hring">Paul Möhring</a> in 1752, though this has no validity as it predates the official beginning of <a href="Linnaean%20taxonomy">Linnaean taxonomy</a>.

In 1874, English zoologist <a href="Alfred%20Henry%20Garrod">Alfred Henry Garrod</a> published a study where he had examined various groups of birds and recorded which muscles of a selected group of five they possessed or lacked. Noting that the muscle patterns were different among the steganopodes (classical <a href="Pelecaniformes">Pelecaniformes</a>), he resolved that there were divergent lineages in the group that should be in separate <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">families</a>, including frigatebirds in their own family Fregatidae. Urless N. Lanham observed in 1947 that frigatebirds bore some skeletal characteristics more in common with <a href="Procellariiformes">Procellariiformes</a> than Pelecaniformes, though concluded they still belonged in the latter group (as suborder Fregatae), albeit as an early offshoot. Martyn Kennedy and colleagues derived a <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> based on behavioural characteristics of the traditional Pelecaniformes, calculating the frigatebirds to be more divergent than pelicans from a core group of gannets, <a href="darters">darters</a> and cormorants, and <a href="tropicbirds">tropicbirds</a> the most distant lineage. The classification of this group as the traditional Pelecaniformes, united by feet that are <a href="Bird%20feet%20and%20legs%23Webbing%20and%20lobation">totipalmate</a> (with all four toes linked by webbing) and the presence of a gular pouch, persisted until the early 1990s. The <a href="DNA%E2%80%93DNA%20hybridization">DNA–DNA hybridization</a> studies of <a href="Charles%20Sibley">Charles Sibley</a> and <a href="Jon%20Edward%20Ahlquist">Jon Edward Ahlquist</a> placed the frigatebirds in a lineage with <a href="penguin">penguin</a>s, <a href="loon">loon</a>s, <a href="petrel">petrel</a>s and <a href="albatross">albatross</a>es. Subsequent genetic studies place the frigatebirds as a <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a> to the group <a href="Suloidea">Suloidea</a>, which comprises the gannets and boobies, cormorants and darters. Microscopic analysis of eggshell structure by Konstantin Mikhailov in 1995 found that the eggshells of frigatebirds resembled those of other Pelecaniformes in having a covering of thick microglobular material over the crystalline shells.

Molecular studies have consistently shown that <a href="pelican">pelican</a>s, the namesake family of the Pelecaniformes, are actually more closely related to <a href="heron">heron</a>s, <a href="Threskiornithidae">ibises and spoonbills</a>, the <a href="hamerkop">hamerkop</a> and the <a href="shoebill">shoebill</a> than to the remaining species. In recognition of this, the <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> comprising the frigatebirds and Suloidea was renamed <a href="Suliformes">Suliformes</a> in 2010.

In 1994 the family name Fregatidae, cited as described in 1867 by French naturalists <a href="C%C3%B4me-Damien%20Degland">Côme-Damien Degland</a> and <a href="Z%C3%A9phirin%20Gerbe">Zéphirin Gerbe</a>, was <a href="Conserved%20name">conserved</a> under Article 40(b) of the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">International Code of Zoological Nomenclature</a> in preference to the 1840 description Tachypetidae by <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20von%20Brandt">Johann Friedrich von Brandt</a>. This was because the genus names "Atagen" and "Tachypetes" had been <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonymised</a> with "Fregata" before 1961, resulting in the aligning of family and genus names.

The <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> frigatebird genus "<a href="Limnofregata">Limnofregata</a>" comprises birds whose fossil remains were recovered from prehistoric freshwater environments, unlike the marine preferences of their modern-day relatives. They had shorter less-hooked bills and longer legs, and longer slit-like nasal openings. Three species have been described from fossil deposits in the western United States, two—"L. azygosternon" and "L. hasegawai"—from the <a href="Green%20River%20Formation">Green River Formation</a> (48–52 million years old) and one—"L. hutchisoni"—from the <a href="Wasatch%20Formation">Wasatch Formation</a> (between 53 and 55 million years of age). Fossil material indistinguishable from living species dating to the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> and <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> has been recovered from <a href="Ascension%20Island">Ascension Island</a> (for "F. aquila"), <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena Island</a>, both in the southern Atlantic Ocean, and also from various islands in the Pacific Ocean (for "F. minor" and "F. ariel").

A <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> study of the skeletal and bone morphology of the classical Pelecaniformes and relatives found that the frigatebirds formed a <a href="clade">clade</a> with "Limnofregata". Birds of the two genera have 15 <a href="cervical%20vertebrae">cervical vertebrae</a>, unlike almost all other <a href="Ciconiiformes">Ciconiiformes</a>, Suliformes and Pelecaniformes, which have 17. The age of "Limnofregata" indicates that these lineages had separated by the Eocene.

The <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus is the <a href="Ascension%20frigatebird">Ascension frigatebird</a> ("Fregata aquila"). For many years, the consensus was to recognise only two species of frigatebird, with larger birds as "F. aquila" and smaller as "F. ariel". In 1914 the Australian ornithologist <a href="Gregory%20Mathews">Gregory Mathews</a> delineated five species, which remain valid. Analysis of <a href="Ribosomal%20DNA">ribosomal</a> and <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> indicated that the five species had diverged from a common ancestor only recently—as little as 1.5 million years ago. There are two species pairs, the great and Christmas Island frigatebirds, and the magnificent and Ascension frigatebirds, while the fifth species, the lesser frigatebird, is an early offshoot of the common ancestor of the other four species. Three subspecies of the lesser and five subspecies of the great frigatebird are recognised.

Frigatebirds are large slender mostly black-plumaged seabirds, with the five species similar in appearance to each other. The largest species is the magnificent frigatebird, which reaches in length, with three of the remaining four almost as large. The lesser frigatebird is substantially smaller, at around long. Frigatebirds exhibit marked <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>; females are larger and up to 25 percent heavier than males, and generally have white markings on their underparts. Frigatebirds have short necks and long, slender hooked bills. Their long narrow wings (male wingspan can reach ) taper to points. Their wings have eleven <a href="Primary%20feathers">primary flight feathers</a>, with the tenth the longest and eleventh a vestigial feather only, and 23 <a href="Secondary%20feathers">secondaries</a>. Their tails are deeply forked, though this is not apparent unless the tail is fanned. The tail and wings give them a distinctive 'W' silhouette in flight. The legs and face are fully feathered. The totipalmate feet are short and weak, the webbing is reduced and part of each toe is free.

The bones of frigatebirds are markedly <a href="Skeletal%20pneumaticity">pneumatic</a> (filled with air), making them very light and contribute only 5% to total body weight. The <a href="pectoral%20girdle">pectoral girdle</a> (shoulder joint) is strong as its bones are fused. The pectoral muscles are well-developed, and weigh as much as the frigatebird's feathers—around half the body weight is made up equally of these muscles and feathers. The males have inflatable red-coloured throat pouches called gular pouches, which they inflate to attract females during the mating season. The gular sac is, perhaps, the most striking frigatebird feature. These can only deflate slowly, so males that are disturbed will fly off with pouches distended for some time.

Frigatebirds remain in the air and do not settle on the ocean. They produce very little oil from their <a href="uropygial%20gland">uropygial gland</a>s so their feathers would become sodden if they settled on the surface. In addition, with their long wings relative to body size, they would have great difficulty taking off again.

Frigatebirds are found over tropical oceans, and ride warm <a href="vertical%20draft">updrafts</a> under <a href="cumulus%20cloud">cumulus cloud</a>s. Their range coincides with availability of food such as <a href="flying%20fish">flying fish</a>, and with the <a href="trade%20wind">trade wind</a>s, which provide the windy conditions that facilitate their flying. They are rare vagrants to temperate regions and not found in polar latitudes. Adults are generally sedentary, remaining near the islands where they breed. However, male frigatebirds have been recorded dispersing great distances after departing a breeding colony—one male great frigatebird relocated from Europa Island in the Mozambique Channel to the Maldives away, and a male magnificent frigatebird flew from French Guiana to Trinidad. Great frigatebirds marked with <a href="bird%20ringing">wing tags</a> on Tern Island in the <a href="French%20Frigate%20Shoals">French Frigate Shoals</a> were found to regularly travel the to <a href="Johnston%20Atoll">Johnston Atoll</a>, although one was reported in <a href="Quezon%20City">Quezon City</a> in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>. Genetic testing seems to indicate that the species has fidelity to their site of hatching despite their high mobility. Young birds may disperse far and wide, with distances of up to recorded.

Having the largest wing-area-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, frigatebirds are essentially aerial. This allows them to soar continuously and only rarely flap their wings. One great frigatebird, being tracked by satellite in the Indian Ocean, stayed aloft for two months. They can fly higher than 4,000 meters in freezing conditions. Like <a href="swift">swift</a>s they are able to spend the night on the wing, but they will also return to an island to roost on trees or cliffs. Field observations in the <a href="Mozambique%20Channel">Mozambique Channel</a> found that great frigatebirds could remain on the wing for up to 12 days while foraging. Highly adept, they use their forked tails for steering during flight and make strong deep wing-beats, though not suited to flying by sustained flapping. Frigatebirds bathe and clean themselves in flight by flying low and splashing at the water surface before preening and scratching afterwards. Conversely, frigatebirds do not swim and with their short legs cannot walk well or take off from the sea easily.

The average life span is unknown but in common with seabirds such as the <a href="wandering%20albatross">wandering albatross</a> and <a href="Leach%27s%20storm%20petrel">Leach's storm petrel</a>, frigatebirds are long-lived. In 2002, 35 ringed great frigatebirds were recovered on <a href="Tern%20Island%20%28Hawaii%29">Tern Island</a> in the <a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a>. Of these ten were older than 37 years and one was at least 44 years of age.

Despite having dark plumage in a tropical climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly as they are exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.

Frigatebirds typically breed on remote oceanic islands, generally in colonies of up to 5000 birds. Within these colonies, they most often nest in groups of 10 to 30 (or rarely 100) individuals. Breeding can occur at any time of year, often prompted by commencement of the dry season or plentiful food.

Frigatebirds have the most elaborate mating displays of all seabirds. The male birds take up residence in the colony in groups of up to thirty individuals. They display to females flying overhead by pointing their bills upwards, inflating their red throat pouches and vibrating their outstretched wings, showing the lighter wing undersurfaces in the process. They produce a drumming sound by vibrating their bills together and sometimes give a whistling call. The female descends to join a male she has chosen and allows him to take her bill in his. The pair also engages in mutual "head-snaking".

After copulation it is generally the male who gathers sticks and the female that constructs the loosely woven nest. The nest is subsequently covered with (and cemented by) <a href="guano">guano</a>. Frigatebirds prefer to nest in trees or bushes, though when these are not available they will nest on the ground. A single white egg that weighs up to 6–7% of mother's body mass is laid, and is <a href="Egg%20incubation">incubated</a> in turns by both birds for 41 to 55 days. The <a href="altricial">altricial</a> chicks are naked on hatching and develop a white down. They are continuously guarded by the parents for the first 4–6 weeks and are fed on the nest for 5–6 months. Both parents take turns feeding for the first three months, after which the male's attendance trails off leaving the mother to feed the young for another six to nine months on average. The chicks feed by reaching their heads in their parents' throat and eating the part-regurgitated food. It takes so long to rear a chick that frigatebirds generally breed every other year.

The duration of parental care in frigatebirds is among the longest for birds, rivalled only by the <a href="southern%20ground%20hornbill">southern ground hornbill</a> and some large <a href="Accipitridae">accipitrids</a>. Frigatebirds take many years to reach sexual maturity. A study of great frigatebirds in the Galapagos Islands found that they only bred once they have acquired the full adult plumage. This was attained by female birds when they were eight to nine years of age and by male birds when they were ten to eleven years of age.

Frigatebirds' feeding habits are <a href="Pelagic%20birds">pelagic</a>, and they may forage up to 500 km (310 mi) from land. They do not land on the water but snatch prey from the ocean surface using their long, hooked <a href="beak">bills</a>. They mainly catch small fish such as <a href="flying%20fish">flying fish</a>, particularly the genera "<a href="Exocoetus">Exocoetus</a>" and "<a href="Cypselurus">Cypselurus</a>", that are driven to the surface by predators such as <a href="tuna">tuna</a> and <a href="dolphinfish">dolphinfish</a>, but they will also eat <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s, particularly <a href="squid">squid</a>. <a href="Menhaden">Menhaden</a> of the genus "<a href="Brevoortia">Brevoortia</a>" can be an important prey item where common, and <a href="jellyfish">jellyfish</a> and larger <a href="plankton">plankton</a> are also eaten. Frigatebirds have learned to follow fishing vessels and take fish from holding areas. Conversely tuna fishermen fish in areas where they catch sight of frigatebirds due to their association with large marine predators. Frigatebirds also at times prey directly on eggs and young of other seabirds, including boobies, petrels, <a href="shearwater">shearwater</a>s and terns, in particular the <a href="sooty%20tern">sooty tern</a>.

Frigatebirds will rob other <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s such as boobies, particularly the <a href="red-footed%20booby">red-footed booby</a>, <a href="tropicbird">tropicbird</a>s, shearwaters, petrels, terns, <a href="gull">gull</a>s and even <a href="osprey">osprey</a>s of their catch, using their speed and manoeuvrability to outrun and harass their victims until they regurgitate their stomach contents. They may either assail their targets after they have caught their food or circle high over seabird colonies waiting for parent birds to return laden with food. Although frigatebirds are renowned for their <a href="Kleptoparasitism">kleptoparasitic feeding behaviour</a>, kleptoparasitism is not thought to play a significant part of the diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great frigatebirds stealing from <a href="masked%20booby">masked boobies</a> estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%.

Unlike most other seabirds, frigatebirds drink freshwater when they come across it, by swooping down and gulping with their bills.

Frigatebirds are unusual among seabirds in that they often carry blood parasites. Blood-borne <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a> of the genus "<a href="Haemoproteus">Haemoproteus</a>" have been recovered from four of the five species. Bird lice of the <a href="ischnocera">ischnocera</a>n genus "<a href="Pectinopygus">Pectinopygus</a>" and <a href="amblycera">amblycera</a>n genus "<a href="Colpocephalum">Colpocephalum</a>" and species "<a href="Fregatiella%20aurifasciata">Fregatiella aurifasciata</a>" have been recovered from magnificent and great frigatebirds of the Galapagos Islands. Frigatebirds tended to have more parasitic lice than did boobies analysed in the same study.

A heavy chick mortality at a large and important colony of the magnificent frigatebird, located on <a href="%C3%8Eles%20du%20Conn%C3%A9table">Île du Grand Connétable</a> off French Guiana, was recorded in summer 2005. Chicks showed nodular skin lesions, feather loss and corneal changes, with around half the year's progeny perishing across the colony. An <a href="Alphaherpesvirinae">alphaherpesvirus</a> was isolated and provisionally named "Fregata magnificens" herpesvirus, though it was unclear whether it caused the outbreak or affected birds already suffering malnutrition.

Two of the five species are considered at risk. In 2003, a survey of the four colonies of the critically endangered Christmas Island frigatebirds counted 1200 breeding pairs. As frigatebirds normally breed every other year, the total adult population was estimated to lie between 1800 and 3600 pairs. Larger numbers formerly bred on the island, but the clearance of breeding habitat during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and dust pollution from phosphate mining have contributed to the decrease. The population of the vulnerable Ascension frigatebird has been estimated at around 12,500 individuals. The birds formerly bred on Ascension Island itself, but the colonies were exterminated by <a href="feral%20cat">feral cat</a>s introduced in 1815. The birds continued to breed on a rocky outcrop just off the shore of the island. A program conducted between 2002 and 2004 eradicated the feral cats and a few birds have returned to nest on the island.

The other three species are classified by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> as being of "Least Concern". The populations of all three are large, with that of the magnificent frigatebird thought to be increasing, while the great and lesser frigatebird decreasing. Monitoring populations of all species is difficult due to their movements across the open ocean and low reproductivity. The status of the Atlantic populations of the great and lesser frigatebirds are unknown and possibly extinct.

As frigatebirds rely on large marine predators such as tuna for their prey, overfishing threatens to significantly impact on food availability and jeopardise whole populations. As frigatebirds nest in large dense colonies in small areas, they are vulnerable to local disasters that could wipe out the rare species or significantly impact the widespread ones.

In <a href="Nauru">Nauru</a>, catching frigatebirds was an important tradition still practised to some degree. Donald W. Buden writes: "Birds typically are captured by slinging the weighted end of a coil of line in front of an approaching bird attracted to previously captured birds used as decoys. In a successful toss, the line becomes entangled about the bird's wing and bringing [sic] it to ground." Marine birds including frigatebirds were once harvested for food on Christmas Island but this practice ceased in the late 1970s. Eggs and young of magnificent frigatebirds were taken and eaten in the Caribbean. Great frigatebirds were eaten in the Hawaiian Islands and their feathers used for decoration.

The great frigatebird was venerated by the <a href="Rapa%20Nui%20people">Rapa Nui people</a> on <a href="Easter%20Island">Easter Island</a>; carvings of the birdman <a href="Tangata%20manu">Tangata manu</a> depict him with the characteristic hooked beak and throat pouch. Its incorporation into local ceremonies suggests that the now-vanished species was extant there between the 1800s and 1860s.

Maritime folklore around the time of European contact with the Americas held that frigatebirds were birds of good omen as their presence meant land was near.

There are anecdotal reports of tame frigatebirds being kept across Polynesia and Micronesia in the Pacific. A bird that had come from one island and had been taken elsewhere could be reliably trusted to return to its original home, hence would be used as a speedy way to relay a message there. There is firmer evidence of this practice taking place in the <a href="Gilbert%20Islands">Gilbert Islands</a> and <a href="Tuvalu">Tuvalu</a>.

Black-throated loon

The black-throated loon ("Gavia arctica"), also known as the Arctic loon and the black-throated diver, is a <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a> aquatic bird found in the northern hemisphere, primarily breeding in freshwater lakes in northern Europe and Asia. It winters along sheltered, ice-free coasts of the north-east Atlantic Ocean and the eastern and western Pacific Ocean. This loon was first described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in 1758. It has two subspecies. It was previously considered to be the same species as the <a href="Pacific%20loon">Pacific loon</a>, of which it is traditionally considered to be a <a href="sister%20species">sister species</a>, although this is debated. In a study that used <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial</a> and <a href="Intron">nuclear intron DNA</a>, the black-throated loon was found to be sister to a <a href="clade">clade</a> consisting of the Pacific loon and two sister species, the <a href="common%20loon">common loon</a> and the <a href="yellow-billed%20loon">yellow-billed loon</a>.

The black-throated loon measures about in length and can weigh anywhere from . In breeding plumage, the adult of the nominate subspecies has mostly black upperparts, with the exception of some of the and , which have white squares. The head and hindneck are grey, and the sides white and striped black. Most of the throat is also black, giving this bird the name "black-throated loon". The colour of the throat patch can be used to distinguish the two subspecies; the throat patch of the other subspecies, "G. a. viridigularis", is green. The underparts are mostly white, including the bottom of the throat. The flanks are also white, a feature which can be used to separate this bird from the Pacific loon. When it is not breeding, the black patch on the throat is absent, replaced with white; most of the black lines on the throat are also missing, except those on the bottom sides, and the upperparts are unpatterned with the exception of a few white spots on the . The juvenile is similar to the non-breeding adult, except more brown overall.

The timing of the breeding season is variable; in the southern part of its range, this loon starts breeding in April, whereas in the northern portion, it waits until after the spring thaw. It builds an oval-shaped nest that measures about across, either near the breeding lake or on vegetation emerging from it. The black-throated loon usually lays a clutch of two, rarely one or three, brown-green eggs with dark splotches. After an incubation period of 27 to 29 days, the chick hatches, and is fed a diet of small fish and invertebrates. This contrasts with the mostly fish diet of the adult. To catch this food, it forages by itself or in pairs, very rarely foraging in groups. It dives from the water, going no deeper than . Most dives are successful. Whether or not at least one chick will hatch from a nest is variable, ranging from 30% to 90%. Most failures come from predators and flooding. Overall, the population of this loon is declining, although the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) still rates it as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>, because the population decline is not rapid enough. The black-throated loon is protected under both the <a href="Migratory%20Bird%20Treaty%20Act%20of%201918">Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</a> and the <a href="Agreement%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20African-Eurasian%20Migratory%20Waterbirds">Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</a>.

The black-throated loon, "Gavia arctica", was originally described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> as "Colymbus arcticus" in his 18th-century work, "<a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>". It was moved to the genus "Gavia" by the <a href="American%20Ornithologists%27%20Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a> (AOU) in 1897. The genus name "Gavia" comes from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "sea mew", as used by the ancient Roman naturalist <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>. The specific "arctica" is Latin for "northern" or "Arctic". The name of the subspecies "viridigularis" stems from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "viridis", meaning "green", and the Latin "gularis", meaning "throated", in reference to the green throat of this subspecies. The common name, black-throated loon, stems from its black throat patch. This loon is also called the Arctic loon and the black-throated diver.

There are two subspecies:

"G. a. viridigularis" was considered to be a separate species when described by <a href="Jonathan%20Dwight">Jonathan Dwight</a> in 1918, but a year after, in 1919, <a href="Arthur%20Cleveland%20Bent">Arthur Cleveland Bent</a> suggested that the former species be moved to its current placement as a subspecies. The black-throated loon was previously considered conspecific with the North American <a href="Pacific%20loon">Pacific loon</a>, which was its subspecies, but they have now been <a href="Lumpers%20and%20splitters">split</a> into two species; there was no evidence of the two interbreeding in areas where they occurred together. Furthermore, the architecture of the air sacs in the lungs of the two species are significantly different. This split was done by the AOU in 1985. The phylogeny of this species is debated, the black-throated loon and the Pacific loon traditionally being considered <a href="sister%20species">sister species</a>, whereas a study using <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial</a> and <a href="Intron">nuclear intron DNA</a> supported placing the black-throated loon sister to a <a href="clade">clade</a> consisting of the Pacific loon and the two sister species that are the <a href="common%20loon">common loon</a> and the <a href="yellow-billed%20loon">yellow-billed loon</a>. This latter study is criticized on the basis that it may form a phylogeny on <a href="incomplete%20lineage%20sorting">incomplete lineage sorting</a>. In the former phylogeny, the split between the Pacific loon and the black-throated loon is proposed to have happened about 6.5 million years ago.

The adult black-throated loon is in length with a wingspan and a weight of . The <a href="nominate%20subspecies">nominate subspecies</a> in its has a grey head and hindneck, with a black throat and a large black patch on the foreneck, both of which have a soft purple gloss. The lower throat has a necklace-shaped patch of short parallel white lines. The sides of the throat have about five long parallel white lines that start at the side of the patch on the lower throat and run down to the chest, which also has a pattern of parallel white and black lines. The rest of the , including the centre of the chest, are pure white. The upperparts are blackish down to the base of the wing, where there are a few rows of high contrast white squares that cover the and . There are small white spots on both the lesser and median coverts. The rest of the is a blackish colour. The is paler than the upperwing, and the underwing coverts are white. The tail is blackish. The bill and legs are black, with a pale grey colour on the inner half of the legs. The toes and the webs are grey, the latter also being flesh coloured. The irides are a deep brown-red. The sexes are alike, and the subspecies "viridigularis" is very similar to the nominate except that the former has a green throat patch, instead of black. The subspecies "viridigularis" does still retain a purplish gloss, although it is less than the nominate.

The non-breeding adult differs from the breeding adult in that the cap and the back of the neck are more brownish. The non-breeding adult also lacks the patterned upperparts of the breeding adult, although some of the upperwing coverts do not lose their white spots. This results in the upperparts being an almost unpatterned black from above. The sides of the throat are usually darker at the white border separating the sides of the throat and the front of the throat; most of the time a thin dark necklace between these two areas can be seen. There is white on the sides of the head that are below the eye. The bill is a steel-grey with, similar to the breeding adult, a blackish tip.

The juvenile is similar to the non-breeding adult, but has a browner appearance. It has a buffy scaling on the upperparts that is especially pronounced on the scapulars. The lower face and front of the neck has a diffused brownish tinge. The juvenile does not have the white spots on the wing coverts, and its irides are darker and more dull in colour. The chick hatches with <a href="down%20feathers">down feathers</a> that range in colour from sooty-brown to brownish-grey, usually with a slightly paler head. The abdomen is pale.

The black-throated loon can be distinguished from the Pacific loon by the white on the flanks of the former.

The male, when breeding, vocalizes a loud and rhythmic "oooéé-cu-cloooéé-cu-cloooéé-cu-cluuéé" whistling song. A "áááh-oo" wail can also be heard, and a growling or croaking "knarr-knor", a sound given especially at night. The alarm call at the nest is a rising "uweek".

The black-throated loon has a large range, breeding taking place across northern Europe, Asia, and the <a href="Seward%20Peninsula">Seward Peninsula</a> in Alaska. When breeding, it is found in the area around isolated, deep freshwater lakes larger than , especially those with inlets, as it prefers to face only small stretches of open water. When it is not breeding, this loon moves in a general southward direction and towards ice-free sea, usually wintering in coasts on north-east Atlantic Ocean and those on the eastern and western Pacific Ocean, such as the coasts of Japan. During this time, its habitat is usually inshore waters along sheltered coasts, although it will sometimes be found inland, in places such as the Mediterranean and Black seas.

Like other loons, this bird takes off by pattering on a "runway" of water. While flying, it makes a barking "kwow" <a href="flight%20call">flight call</a>.

This species usually nests on the ground within about of the lake it breeds at. This loon also sometimes nests on vegetation, like "<a href="Arctophila%20fulva">Arctophila fulva</a>", that have emerged from lakes. The nest site is often reused the next year. The nest itself is oval-shaped and built mostly by the female out of heaped plant material like leaves and sticks. The nest measures about across. Families of black-throated loons often move their nest site from the original nest ponds they inhabited to wetlands nearby after the chicks reach two weeks of age. The journey is generally less than .

In the southern portion of its range, this loon starts to breed in April, whereas in the northern parts of its range, it waits until the spring thaw, when there is adequate water for it to take off in. It usually arrives before the lake thaws, in the latter case.

Before copulation, the female hunches its neck and swims close to the shore until it finds a suitable place and then lies down on the shore. The male sometimes adopts the same posture as the female. During this time, the only vocalization made is a one note "hum". During copulation, the male, coming ashore, mounts the female and occasionally flaps its wings loudly. After this, the male returns to the water and itself. The female stays ashore for a maximum of about 23 minutes and usually starts to build the nest.

The black-throated loon lays a clutch of two, very rarely one or three, eggs that are brown-green with darker speckles. These eggs are incubated by both parents for a period of 27 to 29 days, with the female spending the most time out of the sexes incubating. During incubation, this bird turns its eggs. The interval between when they are turned is very irregular, ranging from one minute to about six hours. After they hatch, the mobile young are fed by both parents for a period of weeks. The chicks fledge about 60 to 65 days after hatching, and achieve sexual maturity after two to three years.

Nesting success, whether or not at least one chick will hatch from any given nest, is variable year to year, the rate of success ranging from just under 30% to just more than 90%. For clutches of two eggs, the average nesting success is about 50%, whereas in clutches with only one egg, this rate is about 60%. The nesting success is influenced most by first, predation, and second, flooding. Some of the adults that lose their clutch early in the incubation period renest. Most of the time, only one chick survives to fledge, the other dying within seven days of hatching. In Scotland, a study concluded that a single pair usually fledges a chick, on average, 25% of the time per year. This can be increased, although, by artificial means, such as constructing rafts for loons to nest on. Whether or not there is at least one chick fledged is influenced by the density of fish in the breeding lake; a lake with a higher density of fish usually reduces the chances that a pair will fledge a chick, even though this loon feeds mainly on fish. There are two factors that might contribute to this; the first being that aquatic insects, an alternative food source for chicks, are more dense when there are less fish, and the second being that a higher density of fish means more <a href="northern%20pike">northern pike</a>, a predator of small chicks.

A top predator in the <a href="pelagic%20zone">pelagic zone</a> of some subarctic lakes, this bird feeds on fish and sometimes insects, <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a>s, <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, and plant matter. The black-throated loon usually forages by itself or in pairs, rarely feeding in groups with multiple species. It dives from the water, at depths of no more than . Just before diving, this loon stretches and holds up its neck until it is erect and at full length. It usually jumps slightly upwards before diving. These dives are frequent, with an average of about 1.6 dives per minute. Most dives, about 80% of them, are successful, and those that are successful are usually shorter than those that are unsuccessful, with an average of 17 seconds for each successful dive, and 27 seconds for each unsuccessful dive. These dives usually only result in small items, and those that yield larger pieces of food are usually more than 40 seconds, where this bird catches quick-swimming fish.

When it is breeding, the adult usually feeds away from the nest, foraging either at the opposite end of the breeding or at lakes near the breeding lake. When foraging for newly hatched chicks, the adult forages in the lake that the nest is at or in nearby lakes, returning after a prey item has been caught. When the chicks are older, they usually accompany both of the parents, swimming a few metres behind them. The strategy that predominates immediately after hatching is generally still employed when the chicks are older, but at a reduced rate. The chicks are only fed one item of prey at a time. The young are also able to capture food themselves at least 36 days after hatching, although they are still fed daily up until about 70 days of age.

The diet of black-throated loon chicks varies, the prey in the breeding lake being a major factor. For the first eight days, chicks are usually fed <a href="three-spined%20stickleback">three-spined stickleback</a>s and <a href="common%20minnow">common minnow</a>s if they are found in the breeding lake. If they are not present, then the chicks are brought up mainly on small invertebrates until about eight days, when they are able to take <a href="trout">trout</a> of about in length. Although in these chicks trout makes up the majority of their diet, they are still fed invertebrates in large numbers. In all lakes, <a href="salmonid">salmonid</a>s make up an important part of the chicks' diet after eight days. Salmonids, especially those between , are important in the diets of older chicks. Eels are also an important food for older chicks.

The black-throated loon is sometimes parasitized by "<a href="Eustrongylides%20tubifex">Eustrongylides tubifex</a>", a species of <a href="nematode">nematode</a> that can cause <a href="Eustrongylidosis">Eustrongylidosis</a>. Mammalian predators, such as <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>es and <a href="pine%20marten">pine marten</a>s, are likely the cause of about 40% of clutch losses. Avian predators, such as <a href="hooded%20crow">hooded crow</a>s, also take the eggs of this loon.

Despite the fact that its population is declining, the black-throated loon is listed as a species of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> by the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a>. This is because the species has a large population and an extremely large range, and its decline does not appear to be rapid. In North America, it is protected under the <a href="Migratory%20Bird%20Treaty%20Act%20of%201918">Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</a>, while in Europe and Africa, it is protected under the <a href="Agreement%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20African-Eurasian%20Migratory%20Waterbirds">Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</a>.

<a href="Freshwater%20acidification">Acidification</a> and <a href="Toxic%20heavy%20metal">heavy-metal pollution</a> of the breeding lake possibly threatens this bird. It is also vulnerable to oil pollution, especially when near fishing grounds. Fishing nets are also a cause of mortality. This loon is sensitive to <a href="windfarm">windfarm</a>s near the coast. Overall, the annual mortality rate of the adult black-throated loon is 10%.

Red-throated loon

The red-throated loon (North America) or red-throated diver (Britain and Ireland) ("Gavia stellata") is a <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a> aquatic bird found in the northern hemisphere. The most widely distributed member of the <a href="loon">loon</a> or diver family, it breeds primarily in Arctic regions, and winters in northern coastal waters. Ranging from in length, the red-throated loon is the smallest and lightest of the world's loons. In winter, it is a nondescript bird, greyish above fading to white below. During the breeding season, it acquires the distinctive reddish throat patch which is the basis for its common name. Fish form the bulk of its diet, though amphibians, invertebrates, and plant material are sometimes eaten as well. A <a href="Animal%20sexual%20behavior%23Mating%20systems">monogamous</a> species, the red-throated loon forms long-term <a href="pair%20bond">pair bond</a>s. Both members of the pair help to build the nest, incubate the eggs (generally two per <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a>), and feed the hatched young.

The red-throated loon has a large global population and a significant global range, though some populations are declining. Oil spills, habitat degradation, pollution, and fishing nets are among the major threats this species faces. Natural predators—including various <a href="gull">gull</a> species, and both <a href="Red%20fox">red</a> and <a href="Arctic%20fox">Arctic fox</a>es, will take eggs and young. The species is protected by international treaties.

First described by Danish naturalist <a href="Erik%20Pontoppidan">Erik Pontoppidan</a> in 1763, the red-throated loon is a <a href="monotypic%20taxon">monotypic</a> species, with no distinctive subspecies despite its large <a href="Holarctic">Holarctic</a> range. Pontoppidan initially placed the species in the now-defunct genus "Colymbus", which contained <a href="grebe">grebe</a>s as well as loons. By 1788, German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Reinhold%20Forster">Johann Reinhold Forster</a> realized that grebes and loons were different enough to warrant separate genera, and moved the red-throated loon (along with all other loon species) to its present genus. Its relationship to the four other loons is complex; although all belong to the same genus, it differs from the others in terms of <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>, behaviour, ecology and breeding biology and may be the basal lineage of the genus. It is thought to have <a href="evolution">evolved</a> in the <a href="Palearctic">Palearctic</a>, and then to have expanded into the <a href="Nearctic">Nearctic</a>. Analysis of molecular data together with the fossil record suggests the lineage of the red-throated loon diverged from that giving rise to the other loon species around 21.4 million years ago in the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>. It is also most closely related to the fossil Pliocene species "<a href="Gavia%20howardae">Gavia howardae</a>".

The genus name "Gavia" comes from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "sea mew", as used by ancient Roman naturalist <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a> "stellata" is Latin for "set with stars" or "starry", and refers to the bird's speckled back in its non-breeding <a href="plumage">plumage</a>. Members of the family <a href="Gavidae">Gavidae</a> are known as "loons" in North America and "divers" in Great Britain and Ireland. The <a href="International%20Ornithological%20Congress">International Ornithological Congress</a> uses the name "red-throated loon" for this species. "Diver" refers to the family's underwater method of hunting for prey, while "red-throated" is a straightforward reference to the bird's most distinctive breeding plumage feature. The word "loon" is thought to have derived from the Swedish "lom", the Old Norse or Icelandic "lómr", or the Old Dutch "loen", all of which mean "lame" or "clumsy", and is a probable reference to the difficulty that all loons have in moving about on land. A local name from Willapa Harbor, Washington was "Quaker loon".

Like the other members of its genus, the red-throated loon is well adapted to its <a href="aquatic%20ecosystem">aquatic environment</a>: its dense <a href="bone">bone</a>s help it to submerge, its legs—in their set-back position—provide excellent propulsion, and its body is long and streamlined. Even its sharply pointed bill may help its underwater streamlining. Its feet are large, its front three toes are fully webbed, and its <a href="tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> is flattened, which reduces drag and allows the leg to move easily through the water.

The red-throated loon is the smallest and lightest of the world's loon species, ranging from in length with a <a href="wingspan">wingspan</a>, and weighing . Like all loons, it is long-bodied and short-necked, with its legs set far back on its body. The sexes are similar in appearance, although males tend to be slightly larger and heavier than females. In breeding plumage, the adult has a dark grey head and neck (with narrow black and white stripes on the back of the neck), a triangular red throat patch, white underparts, and a dark grey-brown <a href="bird%20anatomy">mantle</a>. It is the only loon with an all-dark back in breeding plumage. The non-breeding plumage is drabber with the chin, foreneck, and much of the face white, the top of the head and back of the neck grey, and considerable white speckling on the dark mantle. Its <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> is carmine-red to burgundy in color, its legs are black on the outer half and pale on the inner half, and the webs of its feet are pinkish-brown, with darker margins.

Its bill is thin, straight, and sharp, and often held at an uptilted angle. One of the bird's North American <a href="common%20name">folk name</a>s is pegging-awl loon, a reference to its sharply pointed bill, which resembles a sailmaker's <a href="stitching%20awl">awl</a> (a tool also known as a "pegging awl" in <a href="New%20England">New England</a>). Though the colour of the bill changes from black in summer to pale grey in winter, the timing of the colour change does not necessarily correspond to that of the bird's overall plumage change. The <a href="nostrils">nostrils</a> are narrow slits located near the base of the bill.

When it first emerges from its egg, the young red-throated loon is covered with fine soft <a href="down%20feather">down feather</a>s. Primarily dark brown to dark grey above, it is slightly paler on the sides of its head and neck, as well as on its throat, chest, and flanks, with a pale grey lower breast and belly. Within weeks, this first down is replaced by a second, paler set of down feathers, which are in turn replaced by developing juvenile feathers. The juvenile's plumage is similar to that of the adult, though with a few distinguishing features. It has a darker forehead and neck, with heavy speckling on the sides of the neck and the throat. Its back is browner and less speckled, and its underparts are tinged with brown. Its eyes are reddish-brown, and its beak is a pale grey. Though some young birds hold this plumage until mid-winter, many quickly become virtually indistinguishable from adults, except for their paler bills.
In flight, the red-throated loon has a distinctive profile; its small feet do not project far past the end of its body, its head and neck droop below the horizontal (giving the flying bird a distinctly hunchbacked shape) and its thin wings are angled back. It has a quicker, deeper wingbeat than do other loons.

The adult red-throated loon has a number of <a href="bird%20vocalization">vocalisations</a>, which are used in different circumstances. In flight, when passing <a href="conspecific">conspecific</a>s or circling its own pond, it gives a series of rapid yet rhythmic <a href="goose">goose</a>-like cackles—"kaa-kaa-kaa" or "kak-kak-kak", at roughly five calls per second. Its warning call, if disturbed by humans or onshore <a href="predator">predator</a>s, is a short croaking bark. A low-pitched moaning call, used primarily as a contact call between mates and between parents and young, but also during <a href="animal%20sexual%20behavior">copulation</a>, is made with the bill closed. The species also has a short wailing call—"aarOOao...aarOOao..."—which descends slightly in <a href="pitch%20%28music%29">pitch</a> and lasts about a second; due to strong <a href="harmonic">harmonic</a>s surrounding the primary pitch, this meowing call is more musical than its other calls. Another call—a harsh, pulsed cooing that rises and falls in pitch, and is typically repeated up to 10 times in a row—is used in territorial encounters and pair-bonding, and by parent birds encouraging their young to move on land between bodies of water. Known as the "long call", it is often given in duet, which is unusual among the loons; the female's contribution is longer and softer than her mate's.

Young have a shrill closed-bill call, which they use in begging and to contact their parents. They also have a long call used in response to (and similar to that of) the long call of adults.

At medium to close range, an adult red-throated loon in either breeding or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. However, in certain light conditions, at certain times in its moulting cycle, or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another species—most commonly the <a href="black-throated%20loon">black-throated loon</a>, but also occasionally the <a href="great%20crested%20grebe">great crested grebe</a>. It shows more white on the head and neck than does the black-throated loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends to show more white on the flanks as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch on the rear flank (thus resembling the pattern of the black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black-throated.

The red-throated loon breeds primarily in the <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> regions of northern <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> and North America (generally north of 50°N latitude), and winters in northern coastal waters, sometimes in groups of considerable size. More than 4,400 spend the winter in a loose concentration on the eastern part of the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a>, for example. Unlike other loons, it regularly uses very small freshwater lakes as breeding sites. Its small size renders it more versatile, but it is less able to feed on deeper prey. The increase in size and diversity of the remaining species of loons suggests that the benefits of larger size outweigh the limitations.

In North America, it winters regularly along both coasts, ranging as far south as the <a href="Baja%20California%20Peninsula">Baja California Peninsula</a> and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20California">Gulf of California</a> in north-western Mexico; it has been recorded as a <a href="vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> in the interior Mexican state of <a href="Hidalgo%20%28state%29">Hidalgo</a>. Some of its folk names in north-eastern North America—including cape race, cape brace, cape drake and cape racer, as well as <a href="corruption%20%28linguistics%29">corruption</a>s such as scapegrace—originated from its abundance around <a href="Cape%20Race">Cape Race, Newfoundland</a>. In Europe, it breeds in Iceland, northern Scotland, north-western Ireland (a few pairs only), Scandinavia and northern Russia, and winters along the coast as far south as parts of Spain; it also regularly occurs along major inland waterways, including the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a>, <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a> and <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>s, as well as large rivers, lakes and reservoirs. It has occurred as a vagrant as far south as <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a> and <a href="the%20Gambia">the Gambia</a>. In Asia, it breeds in the northern stretches of <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>, and winters along the Pacific coast as far south as <a href="China">China</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>. It has occurred as a vagrant in <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>.

Because its feet are located so far back on its body, the red-throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land, but it can use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast. Young use this method of covering ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water, including rivers and the sea. It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land. If frightened, it may submerge until only its head or bill shows above the surface of the water.

The red-throated loon is a <a href="diurnality">diurnal</a> <a href="bird%20migration">migrant</a>, which travels singly or in loose groups, often high above the water. In eastern North America (and possibly elsewhere), it tends to migrate near the coast rather than farther offshore; Siberian populations travel for hundreds of miles over land en route to their southern European wintering grounds. It is a strong flier, and has been clocked at speeds between . Like all members of its family, the red-throated loon goes through a simultaneous wing <a href="moult">moult</a>, losing all its <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s at once and becoming flightless for a period of three to four weeks. Unlike other loons—which undergo this moult in late winter—the red-throated loon loses its ability to fly sometime between late summer and late autumn.

Like all members of its family, the red-throated loon is primarily a <a href="Piscivore">fish-eater</a>, though it sometimes feeds on <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a>s, <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, <a href="frog">frog</a>s, aquatic <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, <a href="insect">insect</a>s, fish <a href="spawn%20%28biology%29">spawn</a> or even plant material. It seizes rather than spears its prey, which is generally captured underwater. Though it normally dives and swims using only its feet for propulsion, it may use its wings as well if it needs to turn or accelerate quickly. Pursuit dives range from in depth, with an average underwater time of about a minute. Its fish diet increases the red-throated loon's vulnerability to <a href="persistent%20organic%20pollutant">persistent organic pollutant</a>s and <a href="heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metals</a>, both of which <a href="bioaccumulation">bioaccumulate</a>, thus potentially causing greater problems for long-lived species (such as the loon) at or near the top of the <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a>. Its main diet has also led to several of the loon's British folk names, including "<a href="sprat">sprat</a> borer" and "spratoon".

For the first few days after hatching, young red-throated loons are fed aquatic insects and small crustaceans by both parents. After 3–4 days, the parents switch to fish small enough for the young birds to swallow whole. By four weeks of age, the young can eat the same food—of the same size—as their parents do. Young birds may be fed for some time after <a href="fledging">fledging</a>; adults have been seen feeding fish to juveniles at sea and on inland lakes in the United Kingdom, hundreds of kilometres from any breeding areas.

The red-throated loon is a <a href="Animal%20sexual%20behavior%23Mating%20systems">monogamous</a> species which forms long-term pair bonds. Both sexes build the <a href="bird%20nest">nest</a>, which is a shallow <a href="bird%20nest%23Scrape">scrape</a> (or occasionally a <a href="bird%20nest%23Platform">platform</a> of mud and vegetation) lined with vegetation and sometimes a few feathers, and placed within a half-metre (18 in) of the edge of a small pond. The female lays two <a href="bird%20egg">eggs</a> (though <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutches</a> of one and three have also been recorded); they are <a href="avian%20incubation">incubated</a> for 24–29 days, primarily by the female. The eggs, which are greenish or olive-brownish spotted with black, measure and have a mass of , of which 8% is shell. Incubation is begun as soon as the first egg is laid, so they hatch asynchronously. If a clutch is lost (to predation or flooding, for example) before the young hatch, the red-throated loon usually lays a second clutch, generally in a new nest. The young birds are <a href="precocial">precocial</a> upon hatching: downy and mobile with open eyes. Both parents feed them small aquatic invertebrates initially, then small fish for 38–48 days. Parents will perform <a href="distraction%20display">distraction display</a>s to lure predators away from the nest and young. <a href="Ornithology">Ornithologist</a>s disagree as to whether adults carry young on their backs while swimming with some maintaining that they do and others the opposite.

In the wild, the oldest known red-throated loon lived for more than two decades; it was found, oiled and dead, on a beach in Sweden 23 years and 7 months after it had been <a href="bird%20ringing">ringed</a> (banded).

Although the red-throated loon is not a globally threatened species, as it has a large population and a significant range, there are populations which appear to be declining. Numbers counted in <a href="U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> surveys in Alaska show a 53% population decline between 1971 and 1993, for example, and survey count numbers have dropped in continental Europe as well. In <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, on the other hand, the population increased by some 16% between 1994 and 2006, according to surveys done by the <a href="Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Birds">Royal Society for the Protection of Birds</a> and <a href="Scottish%20Natural%20Heritage">Scottish Natural Heritage</a>. In 2002, <a href="Wetlands%20International">Wetlands International</a> estimated a global population of 490,000 to 1,500,000 individuals; global population trends have not been quantified.

The red-throated loon is one of the <a href="species">species</a> to which the "<a href="Agreement%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20African-Eurasian%20Migratory%20Waterbirds">Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</a>" (AEWA) applies; in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>, it is protected by the <a href="Migratory%20Bird%20Treaty%20Act%20of%201918">Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</a>. <a href="Oil%20spill">Oil spill</a>s, <a href="habitat%20degradation">habitat degradation</a>, and <a href="fishing%20net">fishing net</a>s are among the main threats this species faces. Because it tends to migrate close to shore—generally within of land—it may be detrimentally affected by the construction of near-shore <a href="wind%20farm">wind farm</a>s; studies indicate a high level of avoidance of wind farm areas, though deaths due to direct strikes with the turbines appear to be uncommon. High levels of <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> in the environment have led to reproductive failures in some areas, including parts of Sweden. Studies in Sweden have also shown that they may be adversely impacted by the acidification of lakes, as the fish on which they prey are susceptible to low <a href="pH">pH</a>. On the breeding grounds, <a href="Arctic%20fox">Arctic</a> and <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>es are major <a href="predator">predator</a>s of eggs, while <a href="great%20skua">great skua</a>s, <a href="Arctic%20skua">Arctic skua</a>s and various species of "<a href="Larus">Larus</a>" gulls (including <a href="great%20black-backed%20gull">great black-backed gull</a>s and <a href="glaucous%20gull">glaucous gull</a>s) are predators of both eggs and young.

The species is known to serve as host for at least 51 species of <a href="parasitism">parasites</a>, most of which are <a href="nematode">roundworms</a> (nematodes), <a href="digenean">flatworms</a> (digeneans) and <a href="cestode">tapeworms</a> (cestodes) carried internally; a single species of <a href="louse">louse</a> is its only known external parasite. It is also known to sometimes carry significant populations of <a href="diatom">diatom</a>s (microscopic phytoplankton) on its contour feathers. The red-throated loon is susceptible to <a href="avian%20influenza">avian influenza</a> and Type E <a href="botulism">botulism</a>, and is regularly killed by the ingestion of <a href="neurotoxin">neurotoxin</a>s produced by "<a href="red%20tide">red tide</a>" algal blooms. During a 2007 <a href="algal%20bloom">bloom</a>, large numbers of the birds also died of <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a>, after their plumages became matted by a protein byproduct of the <a href="algae">algae</a>, which reduced the insulating properties of their feathers.

Used as a food source since prehistoric times, the red-throated loon is still hunted by <a href="indigenous%20peoples">indigenous peoples</a> in some parts of the world today. Eggs as well as birds are taken, sometimes in significant numbers; during one study on northern <a href="Canada">Canada</a>'s <a href="Igloolik%20Island">Igloolik Island</a>, 73% of all red-throated loon eggs laid within the 10 km (3.9 mi) study site over two breeding seasons were collected by indigenous inhabitants of the island. In some parts of Russia, red-throated loon skins were traditionally used to make caps and various clothing decorations, including collars. The species was also central to the <a href="creation%20myth">creation myth</a>ologies of indigenous groups throughout the Holarctic. According to the myth—which varies only slightly between versions, despite the sometimes-vast distances that separated the groups who believed it—the loon was asked by a great <a href="shaman">shaman</a> to bring up earth from the bottom of the sea. That earth was then used to build the world's dry land.

As recently as the 1800s, the behaviour of the red-throated loon was used to forecast the weather; according to the conventional wisdom of the time, birds flying inland or giving short cries predicted good weather, while those flying out to sea or giving long, wailing cries predicted rain. In the <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a> islands of Scotland, the species is still known as the "rain goose" in deference to its supposed weather-predicting capabilities. The people of the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a> believed that if the red-throated loon miaowed like a cat, then rain was imminent, while a call of "gaa-gaa-gaa" or "turkatrae-turkatrae" predicted fine weather.

Bhutan, Japan, <a href="%C3%85land">Åland</a> (an autonomous region of Finland), and the <a href="Union%20of%20the%20Comoros">Union of the Comoros</a> have issued stamps featuring the red-throated loon.

HMS Endeavour

HMS "Endeavour, also known as HM Bark "Endeavour, was a British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> research vessel that Lieutenant <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a> commanded to <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> on his <a href="First%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook">first voyage of discovery</a> from 1768 to 1771.

She was launched in 1764 as the <a href="Collier%20%28ship%20type%29">collier</a> "Earl of Pembroke", and the navy purchased her in 1768 for a scientific mission to the Pacific Ocean and to explore the seas for the surmised "<a href="Terra%20Australis">Terra Australis</a> Incognita" or "unknown southern land". The navy renamed and commissioned her as "His Majesty's <a href="Barque">Bark</a> Endeavour". She departed <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> in August 1768, rounded <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a>, and reached <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a> in time to observe the 1769 <a href="transit%20of%20Venus">transit of Venus</a> across the Sun. She then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south, stopping at the Pacific islands of <a href="Huahine">Huahine</a>, <a href="Borabora">Borabora</a>, and <a href="Raiatea">Raiatea</a> to allow Cook to claim them for Great Britain. In September 1769, she anchored off New Zealand, the first European vessel to reach the islands since <a href="Abel%20Tasman">Abel Tasman</a>'s "Heemskerck" 127 years earlier.

In April 1770, "Endeavour" became the first ship to reach the east coast of Australia, when Cook went ashore at what is now known as <a href="Botany%20Bay">Botany Bay</a>. "Endeavour" then sailed north along the Australian coast. She narrowly avoided disaster after running aground on the <a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a>, and Cook had to throw her guns overboard to lighten her. He then beached her on the mainland for seven weeks to permit rudimentary repairs to her hull. On 10 October 1770, she limped into port in <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia, Dutch East Indies</a> (now named <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>) for more substantial repairs, her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands that they had visited. She resumed her westward journey on 26 December, rounded the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a> on 13 March 1771, and reached the English port of <a href="Dover">Dover</a> on 12 July, having been at sea for nearly three years.

"Endeavour" was largely forgotten after her epic voyage and spent the next three years sailing to and from the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a>. She was sold into private hands in 1775 and later renamed as "Lord Sandwich"; she was hired as a British troop transport during the <a href="American%20War%20of%20Independence">American War of Independence</a> and was scuttled in a blockade of <a href="Narragansett%20Bay">Narragansett Bay</a>, <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a> in 1778. Her wreck has not been precisely located but is thought to be one of a cluster of five in Newport Harbor. Relics are displayed at maritime museums worldwide, including six of her cannon and an anchor. In September 2018, marine archaeologists announced that they had located what they believed to be the wreck of the ship off the coast of Rhode Island in the United States. 

A <a href="HM%20Bark%20Endeavour%20Replica">replica of "Endeavour"</a> was launched in 1994 and is berthed alongside the <a href="Australian%20National%20Maritime%20Museum">Australian National Maritime Museum</a> in Sydney Harbour. The US <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Endeavour">Space Shuttle Endeavour</a> is named after the ship, and she is depicted on the <a href="New%20Zealand%20fifty-cent%20coin">New Zealand fifty-cent coin</a>.

"Endeavour" was originally the merchant collier "Earl of Pembroke", built by Thomas Fishburn for Thomas Millner, launched in June 1764 from the coal and whaling port of <a href="Whitby">Whitby</a> in <a href="North%20Yorkshire">North Yorkshire</a>, and of a type known locally as the "Whitby Cat". She was <a href="full%20rigged%20ship">ship-rigged</a> and sturdily built with a broad, flat <a href="bow%20%28ship%29">bow</a>, a square <a href="stern">stern</a>, and a long box-like body with a deep <a href="hold%20%28ship%29">hold</a>.

A flat-bottomed design made her well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and allowed her to be <a href="Beach%20%28nautical%29">beached</a> for loading and unloading of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a <a href="dry%20dock">dry dock</a>. Her <a href="Hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a>, internal floors, and <a href="Futtock%20shrouds">futtocks</a> were built from traditional <a href="white%20oak">white oak</a>, her <a href="keel">keel</a> and <a href="stern%20post">stern post</a> from <a href="elm">elm</a>, and her masts from <a href="pine">pine</a> and <a href="fir">fir</a>. Plans of the ship also show a double <a href="keelson">keelson</a> to lock the keel, floors and frames in place.

Some doubt exists about the height of her standing masts (excludes top and gallant masts), as surviving diagrams of "Endeavour" depict the body of the vessel only, and not the mast plan. While her main and foremast standing spars (excludes top and gallant masts) are accepted to be a standard (standards differed from shipyard to shipyard and country to country) , respectively from an annotation on one surviving ship plan <a href="National%20Maritime%20Museum">National Maritime Museum</a> in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594 which records these lengths has the mizzen as "16 yards 29 inches" (((16+(29/36))*0.9144)round1 m). If correct, this would produce an oddly truncated mast a full shorter than the standards of the day. Late 20th-century research suggested the annotation may be a transcription error and should read "19 yards 29 inches" (((19+(29/36))*0.9144)round1 m), which would more closely conform with both the naval standards (which standard?) and the lengths of the other masts.

A more recent critical review of contemporary sources doesn't require a supposed typo in 1771 to explain this shorter measurement for the mizzen whilst at the same time offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height. Sydney Parkinson's sketches and paintings of Cook's Bark "Endeavour" along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark "Endeavour" spar measurements <a href="National%20Maritime%20Museum">National Maritime Museum</a> in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594, and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter mizzen mast was not stepped in the hold/keelson, but instead was stepped in the lower deck 10 ft above this as was sometimes done. This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8– 9 ft below the main mast cap and approx 5.5 ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops (excludes top and gallant masts) from the level of the water line. 

Whereas the shorter mizzen stepped in the hold on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing mizzen cap 18 ft below the main mast cap which is clearly not the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS "Endeavour" off the coast of New Holland, by Samuel Atkins c. 1794 at the top of this page. Zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught NMM ZAZ7844. 

Using these mizzen chainplate angles from this as fitted draught, it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the larboard quarter of "Endeavour" support this theory of the shorter standing mizzen stepped in the lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped in the hold.

The replica standing mizzen is built to this shorter measurement and stepped in the hold on the keelson, as is the model in the <a href="National%20Maritime%20Museum">National Maritime Museum</a> in Greenwich. There is a difference between the height of the mizzen fore-and-aft spar in the contemporary painting of "Earl of Pembroke" before the naval refit of 1768 by Luny (below) and its position on the replica in the photographs, compared to the height of the lowest spars on the fore and mainmasts.

On 16 February 1768, the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> petitioned <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a> to finance a scientific expedition to the Pacific to study and observe the 1769 <a href="transit%20of%20Venus">transit of Venus</a> across the sun. Royal approval was granted for the expedition, and the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> elected to combine the scientific voyage with a confidential mission to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated continent "Terra Australis Incognita" (or "unknown southern land").

The Royal Society suggested command be given to Scottish geographer <a href="Alexander%20Dalrymple">Alexander Dalrymple</a>, whose acceptance was conditional on a <a href="brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> commission as a captain in the Royal Navy. <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> <a href="Edward%20Hawke%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hawke">Edward Hawke</a> refused, going so far as to say he would rather cut off his right hand than give command of a navy vessel to someone not educated as a seaman. In refusing Dalrymple's command, Hawke was influenced by previous insubordination aboard the sloop in 1698, when naval officers had refused to take orders from civilian commander Dr. <a href="Edmond%20Halley">Edmond Halley</a>. The impasse was broken when the Admiralty proposed <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>, a naval officer with a background in mathematics and <a href="cartography">cartography</a>. Acceptable to both parties, Cook was promoted to <a href="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</a> and named as commander of the expedition.
On 27 May 1768, Cook took command of "Earl of Pembroke", valued in March at £2,307. 5s. 6d. but ultimately purchased for £2,840. 10s. 11d. and assigned for use in the Society's expedition. She was refitted at <a href="Deptford%20Dockyard">Deptford</a> on the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> for the sum of £2,294, almost the price of the ship itself. The hull was sheathed and <a href="caulking">caulked</a> to protect against <a href="shipworm">shipworm</a>, and a third internal deck installed to provide cabins, a powder magazine and storerooms. The new cabins provided around of floorspace apiece and were allocated to Cook and the Royal Society representatives: <a href="natural%20history">naturalist</a> <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Joseph Banks</a>, Banks' assistants <a href="Daniel%20Solander">Daniel Solander</a> and <a href="Herman%20Sp%C3%B6ring%2C%20Jr.">Herman Spöring</a>, astronomer <a href="Charles%20Green%20%28astronomer%29">Charles Green</a>, and artists <a href="Sydney%20Parkinson">Sydney Parkinson</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Buchan%20%28artist%29">Alexander Buchan</a>. These cabins encircled the officer's mess. The Great Cabin at the rear of the deck was designed as a workroom for Cook and the Royal Society. On the rear lower deck, cabins facing on to the mate's mess were assigned to Lieutenants <a href="Zachary%20Hickes">Zachary Hickes</a> and <a href="John%20Gore%20%28Royal%20Navy%20captain%29">John Gore</a>, ship's surgeon William Monkhouse, the gunner Stephen Forwood, <a href="Master%20%28naval%29">ship's master</a> Robert Molyneux, and the <a href="captain%27s%20clerk">captain's clerk</a> Richard Orton. The adjoining open mess deck provided sleeping and living quarters for the marines and crew, and additional storage space.

A <a href="longboat">longboat</a>, <a href="pinnace%20%28ship%27s%20boat%29">pinnace</a> and <a href="yawl">yawl</a> were provided as ship's boats, though the longboat was rotten and had to be rebuilt and painted with <a href="white%20lead">white lead</a> before it could be brought aboard. These were accompanied by two privately owned skiffs, one belonging to the <a href="boatswain">boatswain</a> John Gathrey, and the other to Banks. The ship was also equipped with a set of sweeps to allow her to be rowed forward if becalmed or demasted. The refitted vessel was commissioned as "His Majesty's <a href="Barque">Bark</a> the Endeavour", to distinguish her from the 4-gun <a href="Naval%20cutter">cutter</a> .

On 21 July 1768, "Endeavour" sailed to Galleon's Reach to take on armaments to protect her against potentially hostile Pacific island natives. Ten 4-pounder cannons were brought aboard, six of which were mounted on the upper deck and the remainder stowed in the hold. Twelve swivel guns were also supplied, and fixed to posts along the quarterdeck, sides and bow. The ship departed for <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> on 30 July, for provisioning and to board her crew of 85, including 12 <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a>. Cook also ordered that twelve tons of <a href="pig%20iron">pig iron</a> be brought on board as <a href="sailing%20ballast">sailing ballast</a>.

"Endeavour" departed Plymouth on 26 August 1768, carrying 94 people and 18 months of provisions. Livestock on board included pigs, poultry, two greyhounds and a milking goat.

The first port of call was <a href="Funchal">Funchal</a> in the <a href="Madeira%20Islands">Madeira Islands</a>, which "Endeavour" reached on 12 September. The ship was recaulked and painted, and fresh vegetables, beef and water were brought aboard for the next leg of the voyage. While in port, an accident cost the life of master's mate Robert Weir, who became entangled in the anchor cable and was dragged overboard when the anchor was released. To replace him, Cook <a href="shanghaiing">shanghaied</a> a sailor from an American sloop anchored nearby.

"Endeavour" then continued south along the coast of Africa and across the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> to South America, arriving in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> on 13 November 1768. Fresh food and water were brought aboard and the ship departed for <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a>, which she reached during stormy weather on 13 January 1769. Attempts to round the Cape over the next two days were unsuccessful, and "Endeavour" was repeatedly driven back by wind, rain and contrary tides. Cook noted that the seas off the Cape were large enough to regularly submerge the bow of the ship as she rode down from the crests of waves. At last, on 16 January the wind eased and the ship was able to pass the Cape and anchor in the Bay of Good Success on the Pacific coast. The crew were sent to collect wood and water, while Banks and his team gathered hundreds of plant specimens from along the icy shore. On 17 January two of Banks' servants died from cold while attempting to return to the ship during a heavy snowstorm.

"Endeavour" resumed her voyage on 21 January 1769, heading west-northwest into warmer weather. She reached <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a> on 10 April, where she remained for the next three months. The transit of Venus across the Sun occurred on 3 June, and was observed and recorded by astronomer Charles Green from "Endeavour"'s deck.

The transit observed, "Endeavour" departed Tahiti on 13 July and headed northwest to allow Cook to survey and name the <a href="Society%20Islands">Society Islands</a>. Landfall was made at Huahine, Raiatea and Borabora, providing opportunities for Cook to claim each of them as British territories. An attempt to land the pinnace on the <a href="Austral%20Islands">Austral Island</a> of <a href="Rurutu%20%28Austral%20Islands%29">Rurutu</a> was thwarted by rough surf and the rocky shoreline. On 15 August, "Endeavour" finally turned south to explore the open ocean for "Terra Australis Incognita".

In October 1769, "Endeavour" reached the coastline of New Zealand, becoming the first European vessel to do so since <a href="Abel%20Tasman">Abel Tasman</a>'s "Heemskerck" in 1642. Unfamiliar with such ships, the <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori people</a> at Cook's first landing point in <a href="Poverty%20Bay">Poverty Bay</a> thought the ship was a floating island, or a gigantic bird from their mythical homeland of <a href="Hawaiki">Hawaiki</a>. "Endeavour" spent the next six months sailing close to shore, while Cook mapped the coastline and concluded that New Zealand comprised two large islands and was not the hoped-for "Terra Australis". In March 1770, the longboat from "Endeavour" carried Cook ashore to allow him to formally proclaim British sovereignty over New Zealand. On his return, "Endeavour" resumed her voyage westward, her crew sighting the east coast of Australia on 19 April. On 29 April, she became the first European vessel to make landfall on the east coast of Australia, when Cook landed one of the ship's boats on the southern shore of what is now known as <a href="Botany%20Bay">Botany Bay</a>, <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>.
For the next four months, Cook charted the coast of Australia, heading generally northward. Just before 11 pm on 11 June 1770, the ship struck a reef, today called <a href="Endeavour%20Reef">Endeavour Reef</a>, within the <a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a> system. The sails were immediately taken down, a <a href="Kedge%20anchor">kedging anchor</a> set and an unsuccessful attempt was made to drag the ship back to open water. The reef "Endeavour" had struck rose so steeply from the seabed that although the ship was hard aground, Cook measured depths up to less than one ship's length away.

Cook then ordered that the ship be lightened to help her float off the reef. Iron and stone ballast, spoiled stores and all but four of the ship's guns were thrown overboard, and the ship's drinking water pumped out. The crew attached <a href="buoy">buoy</a>s to the discarded guns with the intention of retrieving them later, but this proved impractical. Every man on board took turns on the pumps, including Cook and Banks.

When, by Cook's reckoning, about of equipment had been thrown overboard, on the next high tide a second unsuccessful attempt was made to pull the ship free. In the afternoon of 12 June, the longboat carried out two large bower anchors, and block and tackle were rigged to the anchor chains to allow another attempt on the evening high tide. The ship had started to take on water through a hole in her hull. Although the leak would certainly increase once off the reef, Cook decided to risk the attempt and at 10:20 pm the ship was floated on the tide and successfully drawn off. The anchors were retrieved, except for one which could not be freed from the seabed and had to be abandoned.

As expected the leak increased once the ship was off the reef, and all three working pumps had to be continually manned. A mistake occurred in <a href="Sounding%20line">sounding</a> the depth of water in the hold, when a new man measured the length of a sounding line from the outside plank of the hull where his predecessor had used the top of the cross-beams. The mistake suggested the water depth had increased by about between soundings, sending a wave of fear through the ship. As soon as the mistake was realised, redoubled efforts kept the pumps ahead of the leak.

The prospects if the ship sank were grim. The vessel was from shore and the three ship's boats could not carry the entire crew. Despite this, Joseph Banks noted in his journal the calm efficiency of the crew in the face of danger, contrary to stories he had heard of seamen panicking or refusing orders in such circumstances.

Midshipman Jonathon Monkhouse proposed <a href="fothering">fothering</a> the ship, as he had previously been on a merchant ship which used the technique successfully. He was entrusted with supervising the task, sewing bits of <a href="oakum">oakum</a> and wool into an old sail, which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into the hole in the hull. The effort succeeded and soon very little water was entering, allowing the crew to stop two of the three pumps.
"Endeavour" then resumed her course northward and parallel to the reef, the crew looking for a safe harbour in which to make repairs. On 13 June, the ship came to a broad watercourse that Cook named the <a href="Endeavour%20River">Endeavour River</a>. Cook attempted to enter the river mouth, but strong winds and rain prevented "Endeavour" from crossing the <a href="sandbar">bar</a> until the morning of 17 June. She grounded briefly on a sand spit but was refloated an hour later and <a href="warping%20%28sailing%29">warped</a> into the river proper by early afternoon. The ship was promptly beached on the southern bank and <a href="careening">careened</a> to make repairs to the hull. Torn sails and rigging were also replaced and the hull scraped free of barnacles.

An examination of the hull showed that a piece of coral the size of a man's fist had sliced clean through the timbers and then broken off. Surrounded by pieces of oakum from the fother, this coral fragment had helped plug the hole in the hull and preserved the ship from sinking on the reef.

After waiting for the wind, "Endeavour" resumed her voyage on the afternoon of 5 August 1770, reaching the northernmost point of <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York Peninsula</a> fifteen days later. On 22 August, Cook was rowed ashore to a small coastal island to proclaim British sovereignty over the eastern Australian mainland. Cook christened his landing place <a href="Possession%20Island%20National%20Park">Possession Island</a>, and ceremonial volleys of gunfire from the shore and "Endeavour"s deck marked the occasion.
"Endeavour" then resumed her voyage westward along the coast, picking a path through intermittent shoals and reefs with the help of the pinnace, which was rowed ahead to test the water depth. By 26 August she was out of sight of land, and had entered the open waters of the <a href="Torres%20Strait">Torres Strait</a> between Australia and <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, earlier navigated by <a href="Luis%20V%C3%A1ez%20de%20Torres">Luis Váez de Torres</a> in 1606. To keep "Endeavour"s voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and ordered them to remain silent about where they had been.

After a three-day layover off the island of <a href="Savu">Savu</a>, "Endeavour" sailed on to <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia</a>, the capital of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, on 10 October. A day later lightning during a sudden tropical storm struck the ship, but the rudimentary "electric chain" or <a href="lightning%20rod">lightning rod</a> that Cook had ordered rigged to "Endeavour"s mast saved her from serious damage.

The ship remained in very poor condition following her grounding on the Great Barrier Reef in June. The ship's carpenter, John Seetterly, observed that she was "very leaky – makes from twelve to six inches an hour, occasioned by her main keel being wounded in many places, <a href="false%20keel">false keel</a> gone from beyond the <a href="wikt%3Aamidships">midships</a>. Wounded on her <a href="wikt%3Alarboard">larbord</a> side where the greatest leak is but I could not come at it for the water." An inspection of the hull revealed that some unrepaired planks were cut through to within ⅛ inch (3 mm). Cook noted it was a "surprise to every one who saw her bottom how we had kept her above water" for the previous three-month voyage across open seas.

After riding at anchor for two weeks, "Endeavour" was heaved out of the water on 9 November and laid on her side for repairs. Some damaged timbers were found to be infested with <a href="shipworm">shipworm</a>s, which required careful removal to ensure they did not spread throughout the hull. Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped of shellfish and marine flora, and repainted. Finally, the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and replenishment were completed by Christmas Day 1770, and the next day "Endeavour" weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>.

Though "Endeavour" was now in good condition, her crew were not. During the ship's stay in Batavia, all but 10 of the 94 people aboard had been taken ill with <a href="malaria">malaria</a> and <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>. By the time "Endeavour" set sail on 26 December, seven crew members had died and another forty were too sick to attend their duties. Over the following twelve weeks, a further 23 died from disease and were buried at sea, including Spöring, Green, Parkinson, and the ship's surgeon William Monkhouse.

Cook attributed the sickness to polluted drinking water, and ordered that it be purified with <a href="lime%20%28fruit%29">lime</a> juice, but this had little effect. Jonathan Monkhouse, who had proposed fothering the ship to save her from sinking on the reef, died on 6 February, followed six days later by ship's carpenter John Seetterly, whose skilled repair work in Batavia had allowed "Endeavour" to resume her voyage. The health of the surviving crew members then slowly improved as the month progressed, with the last deaths from disease being three <a href="Ordinary%20seaman">ordinary seamen</a> on 27 February.

On 13 March 1771, "Endeavour" rounded the Cape of Good Hope and made port in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> two days later. Those still sick were taken ashore for treatment. The ship remained in port for four weeks awaiting the recovery of the crew and undergoing minor repairs to her masts. On 15 April, the sick were brought back on board along with ten recruits from Cape Town, and "Endeavour" resumed her homeward voyage. The English mainland was sighted on 10 July and "Endeavour" entered the port of <a href="Dover">Dover</a> two days later.

Approximately one month after his return, Cook was promoted to the rank of <a href="Commander">Commander</a>, and by November 1771 was in receipt of Admiralty Orders for a <a href="Second%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook">second expedition</a>, this time aboard <a href="HMS%20Resolution%20%281771%29">HMS "Resolution"</a>. He was killed during an altercation with Hawaiians at <a href="Kealakekua%20Bay">Kealakekua Bay</a> on 14 February 1779.

While Cook was fêted for his successful voyage, "Endeavour" was largely forgotten. Within a week of her return to England, she was directed to <a href="Woolwich%20Dockyard">Woolwich Dockyard</a> for refitting as a naval transport. Under the command of Lieutenant James Gordon she then made three return voyages to the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a>.

The first, with Joseph Irving as sailing master (replaced by John Dykes at Portsmouth due to illness), was to deliver "sufficient provisions to serve 350 men to the end of the year 1772"; she sailed from Portsmouth on 8 November 1771, but due to terrible weather did not arrive at <a href="Port%20Egmont">Port Egmont</a> (the British base in the Falkland Islands) until 1 March. "Endeavour" sailed from Port Egmont on 4 May in a three-month non-stop voyage until she anchored at Portsmouth.

The second voyage was to reduce the garrison and replace "HM Sloop Hound", John Burr Commander, with a smaller vessel, namely the 36-ton <a href="shallop">shallop</a> "Penguin", commander Samuel Clayton. She was a collapsible vessel and was no sooner built than taken apart, and the pieces were stowed in "Endeavour". "Endeavour" sailed in November with Hugh Kirkland as the sailing master, and additionally the crew of "Penguin", and four ship's carpenters whose job was to reassemble "Penguin" on arrival, which was 28 January 1773. On 17 April "Endeavour" and "Hound" sailed for England with their crew. One of "Penguin's" crew was Bernard Penrose who wrote an account. Samuel Clayton also wrote an account.

The third voyage sailed in January 1774 and her purpose was to evacuate the Falklands entirely as Britain was faced with political difficulties from the American Colonies, the French and the Spanish. The government thought that if British ships and troops were engaged in America, Spain might seize the Falklands, capturing the small garrison at Port Egmont and maybe killing some of them – this, it was feared, would trigger an outcry which might topple the government. "Endeavour" left England in January 1774, and sailed from the Falklands with all the British inhabitants on 23 April, leaving a flag and a plaque.

"Endeavour" was <a href="paid%20off">paid off</a> in September 1774, and in March 1775 was sold by the Navy to shipping magnate <a href="Mather%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">J. Mather</a> for £645. Mather returned her to sea for at least one commercial voyage to <a href="Arkhangelsk">Archangel</a> in Russia.

Once the <a href="American%20War%20of%20Independence">American War of Independence</a> had commenced, the British government needed ships to carry troops and materiel across the Atlantic. In 1775 Mather submitted "Endeavour" as a transport ship, and she was rejected. Thinking that renaming her would fool Deptford Yard, Mather resubmitted "Endeavour" under the name "Lord Sandwich" "Lord Sandwich" was rejected in no uncertain terms: "Unfit for service. She was sold out Service Called "Endeavour" Bark refused before". Repairs were made, and the vessel was accepted in her third submission, under the name "Lord Sandwich 2" as there was already a transport ship called "Lord Sandwich". 

"Lord Sandwich 2," master William Author, sailed on 6 May 1776 from Portsmouth in a fleet of 100 vessels, 68 of which were transports, which was under orders to support Howe's campaign to capture <a href="New%20York%20City">New York.</a> "Lord Sandwich 2" carried 206 men mainly from the Hessian du Corps regiment of <a href="Hessian%20%28soldiers%29">Hessian mercenaries</a>. The crossing was terrible, and two Hessians who were in the same fleet made accounts of the voyage. The scattered fleet assembled at Halifax and then sailed to Sandy Hook where other ships and troops assembled. On 15 August 1776 "Lord Sandwich 2" was anchored at Sandy Hook; also assembled there was "Adventure", which had sailed with "Resolution" on Cook's second voyage, now a storeship, captained by John Hallum. Another ship there at that time was "HMS Siren", captained by Tobias Furneaux, who had commanded "Adventure" on Cook's second voyage.

New York was eventually captured, but <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a> in the hands of the Americans posed a threat as a base for recapturing New York, so in November 1776 a fleet, which included "Lord Sandwich 2" carrying Hessian Troops, set out to take <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>, which was taken but not subdued, and "Lord Sandwich 2" was needed as a <a href="prison%20ship">prison ship</a>.

The surrender of British General <a href="John%20Burgoyne">John Burgoyne</a>'s army at <a href="Battles%20of%20Saratoga">Saratoga</a> brought France into the war, and in the summer of 1778 a <a href="pincer%20movement">pincer</a> plan was agreed to <a href="Battle%20of%20Rhode%20Island%23French%20arrival%20at%20Newport">recapture Newport</a>: the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> would approach overland, and a French Fleet would sail into the harbour. To prevent the latter the British commander, Captain John Brisbane, determined to blockade the bay by sinking surplus vessels at its mouth. Between 3 and 6 August a fleet of Royal Navy and hired craft, including "Lord Sandwich 2", were scuttled at various locations in the Bay. "Lord Sandwich" "2", previously "Endeavour", previously "Earl of Pembroke", was sunk on 4 August 1778.

The owners of the sunken vessels were compensated by the British government for the loss of their ships. The Admiralty valuation for 10 of the sunken vessels recorded that many had been built in Yorkshire, and the details of the "Lord Sandwich" transport matched those of the former "Endeavour" including construction in Whitby, a <a href="Builder%27s%20Old%20Measurement">burthen</a> of 368  tons, and re-entry into Navy service on 10 February 1776. 

In 1834 a letter appeared in the "<a href="Providence%20Journal">Providence Journal</a>" of Rhode Island, drawing attention to the possible presence of the former "Endeavour" on the seabed of the bay. This was swiftly disputed by the British consul in Rhode Island, who wrote claiming that "Endeavour" had been bought from Mather by the French in 1790 and renamed "Liberté". The consul later admitted he had heard this not from the Admiralty, but as hearsay from the former owners of the French ship. It was later suggested "Liberté", which sank off Newport in 1793, was in fact another of Cook's ships, the former HMS "Resolution", or another "Endeavour", a naval <a href="schooner">schooner</a> sold out of service in 1782. A further letter to the "Providence Journal" stated that a retired English sailor was conducting guided tours of a <a href="hulk%20%28ship%20type%29">hulk</a> on the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> as late as 1825, claiming that the ship had once been Cook's "Endeavour."

In 1991 the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (RIMAP) began research into the identity of the thirteen transports sunk as part of the Newport blockade of 1778, including "Lord Sandwich." In 1999 RIMAP discovered documents in the <a href="Public%20Record%20Office">Public Record Office</a> (now called the National Archives) in London confirming that "Endeavour" had been renamed "Lord Sandwich", had served as a troop transport to North America, and had been scuttled at Newport as part of the 1778 fleet of transports.

In 1999 a combined research team from RIMAP and the Australian National Maritime Museum examined some known wrecks in the harbour and in 2000, RIMAP and the ANMM examined a site that appears to be one of the blockade vessels, partly covered by a separate wreck of a 20th-century barge. The older remains were those of a wooden vessel of approximately the same size, and possibly a similar design and materials as "Lord Sandwich" ex "Endeavour". Confirmation that Cook's former ship had indeed been in Newport Harbor sparked public interest in locating her wreck. However, further mapping showed eight other 18th-century wrecks in Newport Harbor, some with features and conditions also consistent with "Endeavour". In 2006 RIMAP announced that the wrecks were unlikely to be raised. In 2016 RIMAP concluded that there was a probability of 80 to 100% that the wreck of "Endeavour" was still in Newport Harbor, probably one of a cluster of five wrecks on the seafloor, and planned to investigate the ships and their artifacts further. They were seeking funds to build facilities for handling and storing recovered objects.

In September 2018 <a href="Fairfax%20Media">Fairfax Media</a> reported that archaeologists from the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project had pinpointed the final resting place of the vessel. The possible discovery was hailed as a "hugely significant moment" in Australian history, but researchers have warned they were yet to "definitively" confirm whether the wreck had been located.

In addition to the search for the remains of the ship herself, there was substantial Australian interest in locating relics of the ship's south Pacific voyage. In 1886, the Working Men's Progress Association of <a href="Cooktown">Cooktown</a> sought to recover the six cannons thrown overboard when "Endeavour" grounded on the Great Barrier Reef. A £300 reward was offered for anyone who could locate and recover the guns, but searches that year and the next were fruitless and the money went unclaimed. Remains of equipment left at Endeavour River were discovered in around 1900, and in 1913 the crew of a merchant steamer erroneously claimed to have recovered an "Endeavour" cannon from shallow water near the Reef.

In 1937, a small part of "Endeavour"'s keel was given to the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Australia">Australian Government</a> by philanthropist <a href="Charles%20Wakefield">Charles Wakefield</a> in his capacity as president of the <a href="Arthur%20Phillip">Admiral Arthur Phillip Memorial</a>. Australian Prime Minister <a href="Joseph%20Lyons">Joseph Lyons</a> described the section of keel as "intimately associated with the discovery and foundation of Australia".

Searches were resumed for the lost Endeavour Reef cannons, but expeditions in 1966, 1967, and 1968 were unsuccessful. They were finally recovered in 1969 by a research team from the American <a href="Academy%20of%20Natural%20Sciences">Academy of Natural Sciences</a>, using a sophisticated <a href="magnetometer">magnetometer</a> to locate the cannons, a quantity of iron ballast and the abandoned bower anchor. Conservation work on the cannons was undertaken by the Australian National Maritime Museum, after which two of the cannons were displayed at its headquarters in Sydney's <a href="Darling%20Harbour">Darling Harbour</a>, and eventually put on display at Botany Bay and the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Australia">National Museum of Australia</a> in Canberra (with a replica remaining at the museum). A third cannon and the bower anchor were displayed at the James Cook Museum in Cooktown, with the remaining three at the <a href="National%20Maritime%20Museum">National Maritime Museum</a> in <a href="London">London</a>, the <a href="Academy%20of%20Natural%20Sciences">Academy of Natural Sciences</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, and the <a href="Museum%20of%20New%20Zealand%20Te%20Papa%20Tongarewa">Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa</a> in <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a>.

"Endeavour"s Pacific voyage was further commemorated in the use of her image on the <a href="Obverse%20and%20reverse">reverse</a> of the <a href="New%20Zealand%20fifty-cent%20coin">New Zealand fifty-cent coin</a>, and in the naming of the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Endeavour">Space Shuttle "Endeavour"</a> in 1989.

In January 1988, to commemorate the <a href="Australian%20Bicentenary">Australian Bicentenary</a> of European settlement in Australia, work began in <a href="Fremantle">Fremantle</a>, <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, on a replica of "Endeavour". Financial difficulties delayed completion until December 1993, and the vessel was not commissioned until April 1994. The replica vessel commenced her maiden voyage in October of that year, sailing to Sydney Harbour and then following Cook's path from Botany Bay northward to Cooktown. From 1996 to 2002, the replica retraced Cook's ports of call around the world, arriving in the original "Endeavour"'s home port of Whitby in May 1997 and June 2002. Footage of waves shot while rounding Cape Horn on this voyage was later used in digitally composited scenes in the 2003 film "".

The replica "Endeavour" visited various European ports before undertaking her final ocean voyage from Whitehaven to <a href="Port%20Jackson">Sydney Harbour</a> on 8 November 2004. Her arrival in Sydney was delayed when she ran aground in Botany Bay, a short distance from the point where Cook first set foot in Australia 235 years earlier. The replica "Endeavour" finally entered Sydney Harbour on 17 April 2005, having travelled , including twice around the world. Ownership of the replica was transferred to the Australian National Maritime Museum in 2005 for permanent service as a <a href="museum%20ship">museum ship</a> in Sydney's Darling Harbour.

A second full-size replica of "Endeavour" was berthed on the <a href="River%20Tees">River Tees</a> in <a href="Stockton-on-Tees">Stockton-on-Tees</a> before being moved to Whitby. While it reflects the external dimensions of Cook's vessel, this replica was constructed with a steel rather than a timber frame, has one less internal deck than the original, and is not designed to go to sea.

The <a href="Russell%2C%20New%20Zealand">Russell</a> Museum, in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Islands">Bay of Islands</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, has a sailing one-fifth scale replica of "Endeavour". It was built in Auckland in 1969 and travelled by trailer throughout New Zealand and Australia before being presented to the museum in 1970.

At <a href="Whitby">Whitby</a> the "Bark Endeavour Whitby" is a scaled-down replica of the original ship. It relies on engines for propulsion and is a little less than half the size of the original. Trips for tourists take them along the coast to <a href="Sandsend">Sandsend</a>.


Other sources give "Endeavour"s length overall as .
In today's terms, this equates to a valuation for "Endeavour" of approximately £265,000 and a purchase price of £326,400.
Provisions loaded at the outset of the voyage included 6,000 pieces of pork and 4,000 of beef, nine tons of bread, five tons of flour, three tons of sauerkraut, one ton of raisins and sundry quantities of cheese, salt, peas, oil, sugar and oatmeal. Alcohol supplies consisted of 250 barrels of beer, 44 barrels of brandy and 17 barrels of rum.
The shanghaiied man was John Thurman, born in New York but a British subject and therefore eligible for involuntary impressment aboard a Royal Navy vessel. Thurman journeyed with "Endeavour" to Tahiti where he was promoted to the position of sailmaker's assistant, and then to New Zealand and Australia. He died of disease on 3 February 1771, during the voyage between Batavia and Cape Town. 
Some of "Endeavour"s crew also contracted an unspecified lung infection. Cook noted that disease of various kinds had broken out aboard every ship berthed in Batavia at the time, and that "this seems to have been a year of General sickness over most parts of India" and in England.
A number of British vessels were sunk in local waters in the days leading up to the 29–30 August 1778, Battle of Rhode Island. These were the four Royal Navy frigates on 5 August along the coast of Aquidneck Island north of Newport: "Juno" 32, "<a href="HMS%20Lark%20%281762%29">Lark</a>" 32, "<a href="HMS%20Orpheus%20%281773%29">Orpheus</a>" 32, and "Cerberus" 28; the Royal Navy sloop of war "Kingsfisher" and galleys "Alarm" and "Spitfire" in the Sakonnet River on 30 July; the Royal Navy frigate "Flora" and sloop of war "Falcon" in Newport Harbour on 9 August; and ten of the thirteen privately owned British transports sunk in Newport Harbour between 3–5 August were "Betty", "Britannia", "Earl of Oxford", "Good Intent", "Grand Duke of Russia", "Lord Sandwich", "Malaga", "Rachel and Mary", "Susanna", and "Union".

Halifax Explosion

The Halifax Explosion was a maritime disaster in <a href="Halifax%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>, Canada, which happened on the morning of 6 December 1917. The Norwegian vessel collided with , a French <a href="cargo%20ship">cargo ship</a> laden with <a href="Explosive%20material">high explosives</a>, in the Narrows, a strait connecting the upper <a href="Halifax%20Harbour">Halifax Harbour</a> to <a href="Bedford%20Basin">Bedford Basin</a>, causing a large explosion on the French freighter that devastated the <a href="Richmond%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Richmond district</a> of Halifax. Approximately 2,000 people were killed by the blast, debris, fires or collapsed buildings, and an estimated 9,000 others were injured. The blast was the <a href="Largest%20artificial%20non-nuclear%20explosions%23Rank%20order%20of%20largest%20conventional%20explosions/detonations%20by%20magnitude">largest man-made explosion</a> at the time, releasing the equivalent energy of roughly .

"Mont-Blanc" was under orders from the French government to carry her cargo of high explosives from <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> via Halifax to <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, France. At roughly 8:45 am, she collided at low speed, approximately one knot (), with the unladen "Imo", chartered by the <a href="Commission%20for%20Relief%20in%20Belgium">Commission for Relief in Belgium</a> to pick up a cargo of relief supplies in New York. On the "Mont-Blanc", the impact shattered benzol barrels stored on deck that leaked vapors which were ignited by sparks from the collision, setting off a fire on board that quickly grew out of control. Approximately 20 minutes later at 9:04:35 am, the "Mont-Blanc" exploded.

Nearly all structures within an 800-metre (half-mile) radius, including the community of Richmond, were obliterated. A <a href="pressure%20wave">pressure wave</a> snapped trees, bent iron rails, demolished buildings, grounded vessels (including "Imo", which was washed ashore by the ensuing <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a>), and scattered fragments of "Mont-Blanc" for kilometres. Across the harbour, in <a href="Dartmouth%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Dartmouth</a>, there was also widespread damage. A tsunami created by the blast wiped out the community of the <a href="Mi%27kmaq">Mi'kmaq</a> <a href="First%20Nation">First Nation</a> who had lived in the <a href="Tufts%20Cove%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Tufts Cove</a> area for generations.

Relief efforts began almost immediately, and hospitals quickly became full. Rescue trains began arriving the day of the explosion from across Nova Scotia and <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a> while other trains from central Canada and the <a href="northeastern%20United%20States">northeastern United States</a> were impeded by blizzards. Construction of temporary shelters to house the many people left homeless began soon after the disaster. The initial judicial inquiry found "Mont-Blanc" to have been responsible for the disaster, but a later appeal determined that both vessels were to blame. There are several memorials to the victims of the explosion in the <a href="North%20End%2C%20Halifax">North End</a>.

Dartmouth lies on the east shore of Halifax Harbour, and Halifax is on the west shore. Halifax and Dartmouth had thrived during times of war; the harbour was one of the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>'s most important bases in North America, a centre for wartime trade, and a home to <a href="privateers">privateers</a> who harried the British Empire's enemies during the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>, the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, and the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>.

The completion of the <a href="Intercolonial%20Railway">Intercolonial Railway</a> and its Deep Water Terminal in 1880 allowed for increased steamship trade and led to accelerated development of the port area, but Halifax faced an economic downturn in the 1890s as local factories lost ground to competitors in central Canada. The British garrison left the city in late 1905 and early 1906. The Canadian government took over the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Dockyard%2C%20Halifax">Halifax Dockyard</a> (now <a href="CFB%20Halifax">CFB Halifax</a>) from the Royal Navy. This dockyard later became the command centre of the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Navy">Royal Canadian Navy</a> upon its founding in 1910.

Just before the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, the Canadian government began a determined, costly effort to develop the harbour and waterfront facilities. The outbreak of the war brought Halifax back to prominence. As the Royal Canadian Navy had virtually no seaworthy ships of its own, the Royal Navy assumed responsibility for maintaining Atlantic trade routes by re-adopting Halifax as its North American base of operations. In 1915, management of the harbour fell under the control of the Royal Canadian Navy under the supervision of Captain Superintendent Edward Harrington Martin; by 1917 there was a growing naval fleet in Halifax, including patrol ships, tugboats, and minesweepers.

The population of Halifax/Dartmouth had increased to between 60,000 and 65,000 people by 1917. Convoys carried men, animals, and supplies to the European theatre of war. The two main points of departure were in Nova Scotia at <a href="Sydney%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Sydney</a>, on <a href="Cape%20Breton%20Island">Cape Breton Island</a>, and Halifax. <a href="Hospital%20ship">Hospital ship</a>s brought the wounded to the city, and a new military hospital was constructed in the city.

The success of <a href="U-boat%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">German U-boat attacks</a> on ships crossing the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> led the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies</a> to institute a <a href="convoy">convoy</a> system to reduce losses while transporting goods and soldiers to Europe. <a href="Merchant%20ships">Merchant ships</a> gathered at Bedford Basin on the northwestern end of the harbour, which was protected by two sets of <a href="anti-submarine%20net">anti-submarine net</a>s and guarded by patrol ships of the Royal Canadian Navy.

The convoys departed under the protection of British <a href="cruisers">cruisers</a> and <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s. A large army <a href="garrison">garrison</a> protected the city with forts, <a href="gun%20battery">gun batteries</a>, and anti-submarine nets. These factors drove a major military, industrial, and residential expansion of the city, and the weight of goods passing through the harbour increased nearly ninefold. All <a href="Neutrality%20%28international%20relations%29">neutral</a> ships bound for ports in North America were required to report to Halifax for inspection.

The Norwegian ship had sailed from the Netherlands en route to New York to take on relief supplies for Belgium, under the command of Haakon From. The ship arrived in Halifax on 3 December for neutral inspection and spent two days in Bedford Basin awaiting refuelling supplies. Though given clearance to leave the port on 5 December, "Imo"s departure was delayed because her coal load did not arrive until late that afternoon. The loading of fuel was not completed until after the anti-submarine nets had been raised for the night. Therefore, the vessel could not weigh anchor until the next morning.

The French cargo ship arrived from New York late on 5 December, under the command of Aimé Le Medec. The vessel was fully loaded with the explosives <a href="Trinitrotoluene">TNT</a> and <a href="picric%20acid">picric acid</a>, the highly flammable fuel <a href="benzole">benzole</a>, and <a href="guncotton">guncotton</a>. She intended to join a slow convoy gathering in Bedford Basin readying to depart for Europe but was too late to enter the harbour before the nets were raised. Ships carrying dangerous cargo were not allowed into the harbour before the war, but the risks posed by German submarines had resulted in a relaxation of regulations.

Navigating into or out of Bedford Basin required passage through a strait called the Narrows. Ships were expected to keep to the <a href="Port%20and%20starboard">starboard</a> (right) side of the channel as they passed oncoming traffic; in other words, vessels were required to pass port to port. Ships were restricted to a speed of within the harbour.

"Imo" was granted clearance to leave Bedford Basin by signals from the guard ship <a href="CSS%20Acadia">HMCS "Acadia"</a> at approximately 7:30 on the morning of 6 December, with Pilot William Hayes on board. The ship entered the Narrows well above the harbour's speed limit in an attempt to make up for the delay experienced in loading her coal. "Imo" met American <a href="Tramp%20trade">tramp steamer</a> SS "Clara" being piloted up the wrong (western) side of the harbour. The pilots agreed to pass starboard-to-starboard. Soon afterwards, "Imo" was forced to head even further towards the Dartmouth shore after passing the <a href="tugboat">tugboat</a> "<a href="Stella%20Maris%20%28ship%29">Stella Maris</a>", which was travelling up the harbour to Bedford Basin near mid-channel. Horatio Brannen, the captain of "Stella Maris", saw "Imo" approaching at excessive speed and ordered his ship closer to the western shore to avoid an accident.

Francis Mackey, an experienced harbour pilot, had boarded "Mont-Blanc" on the evening of 5 December 1917; he had asked about "special protections" such as a guard ship, given the "Mont-Blanc's" cargo, but no protections were put in place. "Mont-Blanc" started moving at 7:30 am on 6 December and was the second ship to enter the harbour as the anti-submarine net between <a href="Georges%20Island%20%28Nova%20Scotia%29">Georges Island</a> and <a href="Pier%2021">Pier 21</a> opened for the morning. "Mont-Blanc" headed towards Bedford Basin on the Dartmouth side of the harbour. Mackey kept his eye on the ferry traffic between Halifax and Dartmouth and other small boats in the area. He first spotted "Imo" when she was about away and became concerned as her path appeared to be heading towards his ship's starboard side, as if to cut him off his own course. Mackey gave a short blast of his ship's signal whistle to indicate that he had the right of way but was met with two short blasts from "Imo", indicating that the approaching vessel would not yield its position. The captain ordered "Mont-Blanc" to halt her engines and angle slightly to starboard, closer to the Dartmouth side of the Narrows. He let out another single blast of his whistle, hoping the other vessel would likewise move to starboard but was again met with a double-blast in negation.
Sailors on nearby ships heard the series of signals and, realizing that a collision was imminent, gathered to watch as "Imo" bore down on "Mont-Blanc". Both ships had cut their engines by this point, but their momentum carried them right on top of each other at slow speed. Unable to ground his ship for fear of a shock that would set off his explosive cargo, Mackey ordered "Mont-Blanc" to steer hard to port (starboard helm) and crossed the bow of "Imo" in a last-second bid to avoid a collision. The two ships were almost parallel to each other, when "Imo" suddenly sent out three signal blasts, indicating the ship was reversing its engines. The combination of the cargoless ship's height in the water and the <a href="Propeller%20walk">transverse thrust</a> of her right-hand propeller caused the ship's head to swing into "Mont-Blanc". "Imo"s prow pushed into the No. 1 hold of "Mont Blanc", on her starboard side.

The collision occurred at 8:45 am. The damage to "Mont Blanc" was not severe, but it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As "Imo"s engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside "Mont-Blanc"s hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly up the side of the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on "Mont-Blanc"s decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of "Mont-Blanc" shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.

Towing two <a href="scow">scow</a>s at the time of the collision, "Stella Maris" responded immediately to the fire, anchoring the barges and steaming back towards Pier 6 to spray the burning ship with their fire hose. The tug's captain, Horatio H. Brannen, and his crew realized that the fire was too intense for their single hose and backed off from the burning "Mont Blanc". They were approached by a whaler from <a href="HMS%20Highflyer%20%281898%29">HMS "Highflyer"</a> and later a steam <a href="Pinnace%20%28ship%27s%20boat%29">pinnace</a> belonging to <a href="HMS%20Niobe%20%281897%29">HMCS "Niobe"</a>. Captain Brannen and Albert Mattison of "Niobe" agreed to secure a line to the French ship's stern so as to pull it away from the pier to avoid setting it on fire. The five-inch (127-millimetre) <a href="hawser">hawser</a> initially produced was deemed too small and orders for a ten-inch (254-millimetre) hawser came down. It was at this point that the blast occurred.

At 9:04:35 am the out-of-control fire on board "Mont-Blanc" set off her highly explosive cargo. The ship was completely blown apart and a powerful <a href="blast%20wave">blast wave</a> radiated away from the explosion at more than per second. Temperatures of and pressures of thousands of atmospheres accompanied the moment of detonation at the centre of the explosion. White-hot shards of iron fell down upon Halifax and Dartmouth. "Mont-Blanc"s forward 90 mm gun, its barrel melted away, landed approximately north of the explosion site near <a href="Albro%20Lake">Albro Lake</a> in Dartmouth, and the shank of her anchor, weighing half a ton, landed south at <a href="Armdale%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Armdale</a>.

A cloud of white smoke rose to over . The shock wave from the blast travelled through the earth at nearly 23 times the <a href="speed%20of%20sound">speed of sound</a> and was felt as far away as <a href="Cape%20Breton%20Island">Cape Breton</a> () and <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Island">Prince Edward Island</a> (). An area of over was completely destroyed by the explosion, and the harbour floor was momentarily exposed by the volume of water that was displaced. A <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a> was formed by water surging in to fill the void; it rose as high as above the high-water mark on the Halifax side of the harbour. "Imo" was carried onto the shore at Dartmouth by the tsunami. The blast killed all but one on the whaler, everyone on the pinnace and 21 of the 26 men on "Stella Maris"; she ended up on the Dartmouth shore, severely damaged. The captain's son, First Mate Walter Brannen, who had been thrown into the hold by the blast, survived, as did four others. All but one of the "Mont-Blanc" crew members survived.

Over 1,600 people were killed instantly and 9,000 were injured, more than 300 of whom later died. Every building within a radius, over 12,000 in total, was destroyed or badly damaged. Hundreds of people who had been watching the fire from their homes were blinded when the blast wave shattered the windows in front of them. Stoves and lamps overturned by the force of the blast sparked fires throughout Halifax, particularly in the <a href="North%20End%2C%20Halifax">North End</a>, where entire city blocks were caught up in the inferno, trapping residents inside their houses. Firefighter Billy Wells, who was thrown away from the explosion and had his clothes torn from his body, described the devastation survivors faced: "The sight was awful, with people hanging out of windows dead. Some with their heads missing, and some thrown onto the overhead telegraph wires." He was the only member of the eight-man crew of the fire engine "Patricia" to survive.

Large brick and stone factories near Pier 6, such as the Acadia Sugar Refinery, disappeared into unrecognizable heaps of rubble, killing most of their workers. The <a href="Nova%20Scotia%20Cotton%20Manufacturing%20Company">Nova Scotia cotton mill</a> located 1.5 km (0.93 mile) from the blast was destroyed by fire and the collapse of its concrete floors. The <a href="Royal%20Naval%20College%20of%20Canada">Royal Naval College of Canada</a> building was badly damaged, and several cadets and instructors maimed. The Richmond Railway Yards and station were destroyed, killing 55 railway workers and destroying and damaging over 500 railway cars. The <a href="North%20Street%20Station%20%28Halifax%29">North Street Station</a>, one of the busiest in Canada, was badly damaged.

The death toll could have been worse had it not been for the self-sacrifice of an Intercolonial Railway dispatcher, <a href="Vince%20Coleman%20%28train%20dispatcher%29">Patrick Vincent (Vince) Coleman</a>, operating at the railyard about from Pier 6, where the explosion occurred. He and his co-worker, William Lovett, learned of the dangerous cargo aboard the burning "Mont-Blanc" from a sailor and began to flee. Coleman remembered that an incoming passenger train from <a href="Saint%20John%2C%20New%20Brunswick">Saint John, New Brunswick</a>, was due to arrive at the railyard within minutes. He returned to his post alone and continued to send out urgent telegraph messages to stop the train. Several variations of the message have been reported, among them this from the <a href="Maritime%20Museum%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Maritime Museum of the Atlantic</a>: "Hold up the train. Ammunition ship afire in harbor making for Pier 6 and will explode. Guess this will be my last message. Good-bye boys." Coleman's message was responsible for bringing all incoming trains around Halifax to a halt. It was heard by other stations all along the Intercolonial Railway, helping railway officials to respond immediately. Passenger Train No. 10, the overnight train from Saint John, is believed to have heeded the warning and stopped a safe distance from the blast at <a href="Rockingham%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Rockingham</a>, saving the lives of about 300 railway passengers. Coleman was killed at his post as the explosion ripped through the city. He was honoured with a <a href="Heritage%20Minute">Heritage Minute</a> in the 1990s, inducted into the <a href="Canadian%20Railway%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Canadian Railway Hall of Fame</a> in 2004, and a new <a href="Halifax%E2%80%93Dartmouth_Ferry_Service">Halifax-Dartmouth Ferry</a> was named for him in 2018. 

First rescue efforts came from surviving neighbours and co-workers who pulled and dug out victims from buildings. The initial informal response was soon joined by surviving policemen, firefighters and military personnel who began to arrive, as did anyone with a working vehicle; cars, trucks and delivery wagons of all kinds were enlisted to collect the wounded. A flood of victims soon began to arrive at the city's hospitals, which were quickly overwhelmed. The new military hospital, Camp Hill, admitted approximately 1,400 victims on 6 December.

Firefighters were among the first to respond to the disaster, rushing to "Mont-Blanc" to attempt to extinguish the blaze before the explosion even occurred. They also played a role after the blast, with fire companies arriving to assist from across Halifax, and by the end of the day from as far away as <a href="Amherst%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Amherst, Nova Scotia</a> () and <a href="Moncton%2C%20New%20Brunswick">Moncton, New Brunswick</a> () on relief trains. <a href="Halifax%20Regional%20Fire%20and%20Emergency">Halifax Fire Department</a>'s West Street Station 2 was the first to arrive at Pier 6 with the crew of the "Patricia", the first motorized fire engine in Canada. In the final moments before the explosion, hoses were being unrolled as the fire spread to the docks. Nine members of the Halifax Fire Department lost their lives performing their duty that day.

Royal Navy cruisers in port sent some of the first organized rescue parties ashore. HMS "Highflyer", along with the <a href="armed%20merchant%20cruiser">armed merchant cruiser</a>s HMS "Changuinola", HMS "Knight Templar" and <a href="HMS%20Calgarian">HMS "Calgarian"</a>, sent boats ashore with rescue parties and medical personnel and soon began to take wounded aboard. A <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">US Coast Guard</a> cutter, , also sent a rescue party ashore. Out at sea, the American cruiser <a href="USS%20Tacoma%20%28CL-20%29">USS "Tacoma"</a> and armed merchant cruiser <a href="SS%20Kronprinz%20Wilhelm">USS "Von Steuben"</a> (formerly SS "Kronprinz Wilhelm") were passing Halifax en route to the United States. "Tacoma" was rocked so severely by the blast wave that her crew went to <a href="general%20quarters">general quarters</a>. Spotting the large and rising column of smoke, "Tacoma" altered course and arrived to assist rescue at 2 pm. "Von Steuben" arrived a half-hour later. The American steamship "Old Colony", docked in Halifax for repairs, suffered little damage and was quickly converted to serve as a hospital ship, staffed by doctors and orderlies from the British and American navy vessels in the harbour.

Dazed survivors immediately feared that the explosion was the result of a bomb dropped from a German plane. Troops at gun batteries and barracks immediately turned out in case the city was under attack, but within an hour switched from defence to rescue roles as the cause and location of the explosion were determined. All available troops were called in from harbour fortifications and barracks to the North End to rescue survivors and provide transport to the city's hospitals, including the two army hospitals in the city.

Adding to the chaos were fears of a potential second explosion. A cloud of steam shot out of ventilators at the ammunition magazine at Wellington Barracks as naval personnel extinguished a fire by the magazine. The fire was quickly put out; the cloud was seen from blocks away and quickly led to rumours that another explosion was imminent. Uniformed officers ordered everyone away from the area. As the rumour spread across the city, many families fled their homes. The confusion hampered efforts for over two hours until fears were dispelled by about noon. Many rescuers ignored the evacuation, and naval rescue parties continued working uninterrupted at the harbour.

Surviving railway workers in the railyards at the heart of the disaster carried out rescue work, pulling people from the harbour and from under debris. The overnight train from Saint John was just approaching the city when hit by the blast but was only slightly damaged. It continued into Richmond until the track was blocked by wreckage. Passengers and soldiers aboard used the emergency tools from the train to dig people out of houses and bandaged them with sheets from the sleeping cars. The train was loaded with injured and left the city at 1:30 with a doctor aboard, to evacuate the wounded to <a href="Truro%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Truro</a>.

Led by <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Nova%20Scotia">Lieutenant Governor</a> <a href="MacCallum%20Grant">MacCallum Grant</a>, leading citizens formed the Halifax Relief Commission at around noon. The committee organized members in charge of organizing medical relief for both Halifax and Dartmouth, supplying transportation, food and shelter, and covering medical and funeral costs for victims. The commission would continue until 1976, participating in reconstruction and relief efforts and later distributing pensions to survivors.

Rescue trains were dispatched from across Atlantic Canada, as well as the northeastern United States. The first left Truro around 10 am carrying medical personnel and supplies, arrived in Halifax by noon and returned to Truro with the wounded and homeless by 3 pm. The track had become impassable after Rockingham, on the western edge of Bedford Basin. To reach the wounded, rescue personnel had to walk through parts of the devastated city until they reached a point where the military had begun to clear the streets. By nightfall, a dozen trains had reached Halifax from the Nova Scotian towns of Truro, <a href="Kentville%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Kentville</a>, Amherst, <a href="Stellarton%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Stellarton</a>, <a href="Pictou">Pictou</a>, and <a href="Sydney%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Sydney</a> and from the New Brunswick towns of <a href="Sackville%2C%20New%20Brunswick">Sackville</a>, <a href="Moncton">Moncton</a> and Saint John.

Relief efforts were hampered the following day by a <a href="blizzard">blizzard</a> that blanketed Halifax with of heavy snow. Trains en route from other parts of Canada and from the United States were stalled in snowdrifts, and telegraph lines that had been hastily repaired following the explosion were again knocked down. Halifax was isolated by the storm, and rescue committees were forced to suspend the search for survivors; the storm aided efforts to put out fires throughout the city.

The exact number killed by the disaster is unknown. The Halifax Explosion Remembrance Book, an official database compiled in 2002 by the <a href="Nova%20Scotia%20Archives%20and%20Records%20Management">Nova Scotia Archives and Records Management</a>, identified 1,950 victims. As many as 1,600 people died immediately in the blast, tsunami, and collapse of buildings. The last body, a caretaker killed at the Exhibition Grounds, was not recovered until the summer of 1919. An additional 9,000 were injured. 1,630 homes were destroyed in the explosion and fires, and another 12,000 damaged; roughly 6,000 people were left homeless and 25,000 had insufficient shelter. The city's industrial sector was in large part gone, with many workers among the casualties and the dockyard heavily damaged.

A mortuary committee chaired by Alderman R. B. Coldwell was quickly formed at <a href="Halifax%20City%20Hall">Halifax City Hall</a> on the morning of the disaster. The Chebucto Road School (now the Maritime Academy of Performing Arts) in <a href="West%20End%2C%20Halifax">Halifax's west end</a> was chosen as a central morgue. A company of the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Engineers">Royal Canadian Engineers</a> (RCE) repaired and converted the basement of the school to serve as a morgue and classrooms to serve as offices for the Halifax coroner. Trucks and wagons soon began to arrive with bodies. Coroner Arthur S. Barnstead took over from Coldwell as the morgue went into operation and implemented a system to carefully number and describe bodies; it was based on the system developed by his father, John Henry Barnstead, to identify victims in 1912.

Many of the wounds inflicted by the blast were permanently debilitating, such as those caused by flying glass or by the flash of the explosion. Thousands of people had stopped to watch the ship burning in the harbour, many from inside buildings, leaving them directly in the path of glass fragments from shattered windows. Roughly 5,900 eye injuries were reported, and 41 people lost their sight permanently.

An estimated c$35 million in damage resulted (c$ million today). About $30 million in financial aid was raised from various sources, including $18 million from the federal government, over $4 million from the British government, and $750,000 from the state of <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>.

Dartmouth was not as densely populated as Halifax and was separated from the blast by the width of the harbour, but still suffered heavy damage. Almost 100 people were estimated to have died on the Dartmouth side. Windows were shattered and many buildings were damaged or destroyed, including the <a href="Oland%20Brewery">Oland Brewery</a> and parts of the Starr Manufacturing Company. <a href="Nova%20Scotia%20Hospital">Nova Scotia Hospital</a> was the only hospital in Dartmouth and many of the victims were treated there.

There were small enclaves of <a href="Mi%27kmaq">Mi'kmaq</a> in and around the coves of Bedford Basin on the Dartmouth shore. Directly opposite to Pier 9 on the Halifax side sat a community in <a href="Tufts%20Cove%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Tufts Cove</a>, also known as Turtle Grove. The settlement, dating back to the 18th century, had been a subject of controversy because white settler landowners wanted to remove the Mi'kmaq residents. In the years and months preceding the explosion, the <a href="Indigenous%20and%20Northern%20Affairs%20Canada">Department of Indian Affairs</a> had been actively trying to force the Mi'kmaq to give up their land, but this had not occurred by the time of the explosion. The fire aboard "Mont-Blanc" drew the attention of many onlookers on both sides of the harbour. The physical structures of the settlement were obliterated by the explosion and tsunami. A precise Mi'kmaq death toll is unknown; records show that nine bodies were recovered, and the settlement was not rebuilt in the wake of the disaster. The Halifax Remembrance Book lists 16 members of the Tufts Cove Community as dead; not all the dead listed as in Tufts Cove were Indigenous. Survivors were housed in a racially segregated building under generally poor conditions and eventually dispersed around Nova Scotia.

The <a href="black%20people">black</a> community of <a href="Africville">Africville</a>, on the southern shores of Bedford Basin adjacent to the <a href="Halifax%20Peninsula">Halifax Peninsula</a>, was spared the direct force of the blast by the shadow effect of the raised ground to the south. Africville's small and frail homes were heavily damaged by the explosion. Families recorded the deaths of five residents. Africville received little of the donated relief funds and none of the progressive reconstruction invested in other parts of the city after the explosion.

Many people in Halifax at first believed the explosion to be the result of a German attack. The <a href="The%20Chronicle%20Herald">"Halifax Herald"</a> continued to propagate this belief for some time, for example reporting that Germans had mocked victims of the explosion. While John Johansen, the Norwegian helmsman of "Imo", was being treated for serious injuries sustained during the explosion, it was reported to the military police that he had been behaving suspiciously. Johansen was arrested on suspicions of being a German spy when a search turned up a letter on his person, supposedly written in German. It turned out that the letter was actually written in Norwegian. Immediately following the explosion, most of the German survivors in Halifax had been rounded up and imprisoned. Eventually the fear dissipated as the real cause of the explosion became known, although rumours of German involvement persisted.

A <a href="judicial%20inquiry">judicial inquiry</a> known as the Wreck Commissioner's Inquiry was formed to investigate the causes of the collision. Proceedings began at the <a href="Halifax%20Court%20House">Halifax Court House</a> on 13 December 1917, presided over by Justice Arthur Drysdale. The inquiry's report of 4 February 1918 blamed "Mont-Blanc"s <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">captain</a>, Aimé Le Médec, the ship's <a href="maritime%20pilot">pilot</a>, Francis Mackey, and Commander F. Evan Wyatt, the Royal Canadian Navy's chief examining officer in charge of the harbour, gates and anti-submarine defences, for causing the collision. Drysdale agreed with Dominion Wreck Commissioner L. A. Demers' opinion that "it was the "Mont-Blanc"s responsibility alone to ensure that she avoided a collision at all costs" given her cargo; he was likely influenced by local opinion, which was strongly anti-French, as well as by the "street fighter" style of argumentation used by "Imo" lawyer Charles Burchell. According to Crown counsel W. A. Henry, this was "a great surprise to most people", who had expected the "Imo" to be blamed for being on the wrong side of the channel. All three men were charged with <a href="manslaughter">manslaughter</a> and <a href="criminal%20negligence">criminal negligence</a> at a preliminary hearing heard by Stipendiary Magistrate Richard A. McLeod, and bound over for trial. A <a href="Nova%20Scotia%20Supreme%20Court">Nova Scotia Supreme Court</a> justice, <a href="Benjamin%20Russell%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">Benjamin Russell</a>, found there was no evidence to support these charges. Mackey was discharged on a writ of "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>" and the charges dropped. The charges against Le Médec were also dismissed. This left only Wyatt to face a grand jury hearing. On 17 April 1918, a jury acquitted him in a trial that lasted less than a day.

Drysdale also oversaw the first civil litigation trial, in which the owners of the two ships sought damages from each other. His decision (27 April 1918) found "Mont-Blanc" entirely at fault. Subsequent appeals to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> (19 May 1919), and the <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Judicial Committee of the Privy Council</a> in London (22 March 1920), determined "Mont-Blanc" and "Imo" were equally to blame for navigational errors that led to the collision. No party was ever convicted for any crime or otherwise successfully prosecuted for any actions that precipitated the disaster.

Efforts began shortly after the explosion to clear debris, repair buildings, and establish temporary housing for survivors left homeless by the explosion. By late January 1918, around 5,000 were still without shelter. A reconstruction committee under Colonel Robert Low constructed 832 new housing units, which were furnished by the Massachusetts-Halifax Relief Fund.

Partial train service resumed from a temporary rail terminal in the city's South End on 7 December. Full service resumed on 9 December when tracks were cleared and the <a href="North%20Street%20Station%20%28Halifax%29">North Street Station</a> reopened. The <a href="Canadian%20Government%20Railways">Canadian Government Railways</a> created a special unit to clear and repair railway yards as well as rebuild railway piers and the Naval Dockyard. Most piers returned to operation by late December and were repaired by January.
The North End Halifax neighbourhood of Richmond bore the brunt of the explosion. In 1917, Richmond was considered a working-class neighbourhood and had few paved roads. After the explosion, the Halifax Relief Commission approached the reconstruction of Richmond as an opportunity to improve and modernize the city's North End. English town planner <a href="Thomas%20Adams%20%28architect%29">Thomas Adams</a> and Montreal architectural firm <a href="Ross%20and%20Macdonald">Ross and Macdonald</a> were recruited to design a new housing plan for Richmond. Adams, inspired by the Victorian <a href="garden%20city%20movement">garden city movement</a>, aimed to provide public access to green spaces and to create a low-rise, low-density and multifunctional urban neighbourhood. The planners designed 326 large homes that each faced a tree-lined, paved boulevard. They specified that the homes be built with a new and innovative fireproof material, blocks of compressed cement called Hydrostone. The first of these homes was occupied by March 1919. Once finished, the <a href="The%20Hydrostone">Hydrostone</a> neighbourhood consisted of homes, businesses and parks, which helped create a new sense of community in the North End of Halifax. It has now become an upscale neighbourhood and shopping district. In contrast, the equally poor and underdeveloped area of Africville was not included in reconstruction efforts.

Every building in the Halifax dockyard required some degree of rebuilding, as did HMCS "Niobe" and the docks themselves; all of the Royal Canadian Navy's minesweepers and patrol boats were undamaged. Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Borden">Robert Borden</a> pledged that the government would be "co-operating in every way to reconstruct the Port of Halifax: this was of utmost importance to the Empire". Captain Symington of USS "Tacoma" speculated that the port would not be operational for months, but a convoy departed on 11 December and dockyard operations resumed before Christmas.

The Halifax Explosion was one of the <a href="largest%20artificial%20non-nuclear%20explosions">largest artificial non-nuclear explosions</a>. An extensive comparison of 130 major explosions by Halifax historian Jay White in 1994 concluded that "Halifax Harbour remains unchallenged in overall magnitude as long as five criteria are considered together: number of casualties, force of blast, radius of devastation, quantity of explosive material, and total value of property destroyed." For many years afterward, the Halifax Explosion was the standard by which all large blasts were measured. For instance, in its report on the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombing of Hiroshima</a>, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" wrote that the explosive power of the <a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a> bomb was seven times that of the Halifax Explosion.

The many eye injuries resulting from the disaster led to better understanding on the part of physicians of how to care for damaged eyes, and "with the recently formed <a href="Canadian%20National%20Institute%20for%20the%20Blind">Canadian National Institute for the Blind</a>, Halifax became internationally known as a centre for care for the blind", according to <a href="Dalhousie%20University">Dalhousie University</a> professor Victoria Allen. The lack of coordinated <a href="Pediatrics">pediatric</a> care in such a disaster was also noted by <a href="William%20E.%20Ladd">William Ladd</a>, a surgeon from Boston who had arrived to help. His insights from the explosion are generally credited with inspiring him to pioneer the specialty of <a href="pediatric%20surgery">pediatric surgery</a> in North America. The Halifax Explosion also inspired a series of health reforms, including around <a href="public%20sanitation">public sanitation</a> and <a href="maternity%20care">maternity care</a>.
Having affected virtually every family and working collective in Halifax, the event was incredibly traumatic for the whole surviving community, so the memory was largely suppressed. After the first anniversary, the city stopped commemorating the explosion for decades. The second official commemoration did not take place before the 50th anniversary in 1967, and even after that, the activities stopped again. Construction began in 1964 on the <a href="Halifax%20North%20Memorial%20Library">Halifax North Memorial Library</a>, designed to commemorate the victims of the explosion. The library entrance featured the first monument built to mark the explosion, the <a href="Halifax%20Explosion%20Memorial%20Sculpture">Halifax Explosion Memorial Sculpture</a>, created by artist <a href="Jordi%20Bonet">Jordi Bonet</a>. The sculpture was dismantled by the Halifax Regional Municipality in 2004 and largely destroyed while in storage. In 2015, the remaining fragments were shipped to Bonet's family in Montreal despite a public campaign to return the sculpture to memorial display. The Halifax Explosion Memorial Bells were built in 1985, relocating memorial <a href="carillon">carillon</a> bells from a nearby church to a large concrete sculpture on Fort Needham Hill, facing the "ground zero" area of the explosion. The Bell Tower is the location of an annual civic ceremony every 6 December. A memorial at the Halifax Fire Station on Lady Hammond Road honours the firefighters killed while responding to the explosion. Fragments of "Mont-Blanc" have been mounted as neighbourhood monuments to the explosion at Albro Lake Road in Dartmouth, at Regatta Point, and elsewhere in the area. Simple monuments mark the mass graves of explosion victims at the <a href="Fairview%20Cemetery%2C%20Halifax%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Fairview Lawn Cemetery</a> and the Bayers Road Cemetery. A Memorial Book listing the names of all the known victims is displayed at the Halifax North Memorial Library and at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, which has a large permanent exhibit about the Halifax Explosion. <a href="Harold%20Gilman">Harold Gilman</a> was commissioned to create a painting memorializing the event; his work, "Halifax Harbour at Sunset", "tells very little about the recent devastation, as the viewpoint is set back so that the harbour appears undisturbed".
<a href="Hugh%20MacLennan">Hugh MacLennan</a>'s novel "<a href="Barometer%20Rising">Barometer Rising</a>" (1941) is set in Halifax at the time of the explosion and includes a carefully researched description of its impact on the city. Following in MacLennan's footsteps, journalist <a href="Robert%20MacNeil">Robert MacNeil</a> penned "<a href="Burden%20of%20Desire">Burden of Desire</a>" (1992) and used the explosion as a metaphor for the societal and cultural changes of the day. MacLennan and MacNeil's use of the romance genre to fictionalize the explosion is similar to the first attempt by <a href="Lieutenant-Colonel%20Frank%20McKelvey%20Bell">Lieutenant-Colonel Frank McKelvey Bell</a>, author of the short novella "<a href="A%20Romance%20of%20the%20Halifax%20Disaster">A Romance of the Halifax Disaster</a>" (1918). This work follows the love affair of a young woman and an injured soldier. Keith Ross Leckie scripted a miniseries entitled "" (2003), which took the title but has no relationship to <a href="Janet%20Kitz">Janet Kitz</a>'s non-fiction book "" (1990). The film was criticized for distortions and inaccuracies.

In 1918, Halifax sent a Christmas tree to the City of <a href="Boston">Boston</a> in thanks and remembrance for the help that the Boston <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> and the Massachusetts Public Safety Committee provided immediately after the disaster. That gift was revived in 1971 by the <a href="Lunenburg%20County%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Lunenburg County</a> Christmas Tree Producers Association, which began an annual donation of a large tree to promote Christmas tree exports as well as acknowledge Boston's support after the explosion. The gift was later taken over by the Nova Scotia Government to continue the goodwill gesture as well as to promote trade and tourism. The tree is <a href="Boston%20Christmas%20Tree">Boston's official Christmas tree</a> and is lit on <a href="Boston%20Common">Boston Common</a> throughout the holiday season. In deference to its symbolic importance for both cities, the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources has specific guidelines for selecting the tree.

Sunderland A.F.C.

Sunderland Association Football Club (, ) is an English professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in the city of <a href="Sunderland">Sunderland</a>, <a href="Tyne%20and%20Wear">Tyne and Wear</a>. Sunderland play in <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a>, the third tier of English football. Since its formation in 1879, the club has won six top-flight (<a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>, now the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>) titles (1892, 1893, 1895, 1902, 1913 and 1936), a total only bettered by five other clubs, and has finished runners-up five times. The club has also won the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> twice (1937 and 1973) and been runners-up twice (1913 and 1992), as well as winning the FA Community Shield in 1936 and being finalists the following year. Sunderland have also been <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">Football League Cup</a> finalists in 1985 and 2014.

Sunderland won their first <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> in 1937 with a 3–1 victory over <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a>, and remained in the top league for 68 successive seasons until they were relegated for the first time in 1958. Sunderland's most notable trophy after the Second World War was their second FA Cup in 1973, when the club secured a 1–0 victory over <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a>. The team has won the second tier title five times in that period and the third tier title once.

Sunderland play their home games at the 49,000-capacity <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater</a> <a href="Stadium%20of%20Light">Stadium of Light</a> having moved from <a href="Roker%20Park">Roker Park</a> in 1997. The original ground capacity was 42,000 which was increased to 49,000 following expansion in 2000. Sunderland have a long-standing rivalry with their neighbouring club <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>, with whom they have contested the <a href="Tyne%E2%80%93Wear%20derby">Tyne–Wear derby</a> since 1898.

The club was founded as "'Sunderland and District Teachers A.F.C".' by <a href="schoolmaster">schoolmaster</a> <a href="James%20Allan%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201857%29">James Allan</a> in what has commonly been believed to be in October 1879. However, evidence suggests that the club was not formally created until a year later, on 25 September 1880. It was renamed as "'Sunderland A.F.C."' and became open to more than just school teachers in October 1880.

Sunderland joined <a href="English%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> for the <a href="1890%E2%80%9391%20Sunderland%20A.F.C.%20season">1890–91 season</a>. They replaced <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke</a>, who had failed to be re-elected, becoming the first new club to join the league since its inauguration in 1888. During the late 19th century, they were declared the "Team of All Talents" by <a href="William%20McGregor%20%28football%29">William McGregor</a>, the founder of the league, after a 7–2 win against <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>. Sunderland won the league championship in the <a href="1891%E2%80%9392%20Sunderland%20A.F.C.%20season">1891–92 season</a>, one season after joining The Football League. The club's 42 points were five clear of nearest rivals <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a>, and this performance led "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" to describe the players as "a wonderfully fine team". Sunderland successfully defended the title the following season, aided by <a href="forward%20%28association%20football%29">centre forward</a> <a href="John%20Campbell%20%28footballer%20born%201870%29">Johnny Campbell</a>, who broke the 30-goal mark for the second time in consecutive seasons. In the process, they became the first team to score 100 goals in a season, a feat not matched until <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20in%20English%20football">1919–20</a>, when <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> set a new record.

Sunderland came close to winning a third successive league championship in the <a href="1893%E2%80%9394%20in%20English%20football">1893–94 season</a>, finishing second behind Aston Villa. However, they regained the title in the <a href="1894%E2%80%9395%20in%20English%20football">1894–95 season</a>, ending the season five points ahead of <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>. After winning the English League Championship, Sunderland played against <a href="Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.">Heart of Midlothian</a>, the champions of the Scottish League, in a game described as the "<a href="1894/95%20World%20Championship">Championship of the World</a>" title match. Sunderland won the game 5–3 and were announced "Champions of the world". Sunderland came close to winning another league title in the <a href="1897%E2%80%9398%20in%20English%20football">1897–98 season</a>, when they finished as runners-up to <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>. That season was their last at <a href="Newcastle%20Road%20%28stadium%29">Newcastle Road</a>, as they moved to <a href="Roker%20Park">Roker Park</a> the following season. After coming second in 1900–01, the club won their fourth league title in the <a href="1901%E2%80%9302%20in%20English%20football">1901–02 season</a>, beating Everton by a three-point margin.

In 1904, Sunderland's management was embroiled in a payment scandal involving player <a href="Andy%20McCombie">Andrew McCombie</a>. The club was said to have given the player £100 (£ today) to help him start his own business, on the understanding that he would repay the money after his benefit game. However, McCombie refused to repay the money, claiming it had been a gift. An investigation conducted by the <a href="The%20Football%20Association">Football Association</a> concluded that the money given to McCombie was part of a "re-signing/win/draw bonus", which violated the Association's rules. Sunderland were fined £250 (£ today), and six directors were suspended for two and a half years for not showing a true record of the club's financial dealings. Sunderland manager <a href="Alex%20Mackie">Alex Mackie</a> was also suspended for three months for his involvement in the affair.

On 5 December 1908, Sunderland achieved their highest ever league win, against north-east rivals Newcastle United. They won the game 9–1; <a href="Billy%20Hogg">Billy Hogg</a> and <a href="George%20Holley">George Holley</a> each scored <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a>s. The club won the league again in 1913, but lost their first <a href="FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> 1–0 to Aston Villa, in a very tough loss. This was the closest the club has come to winning the league title and the FA Cup in the same season. Two seasons later the First World War brought the league to a halt. After the league's resumption, Sunderland came close to winning another championship in the <a href="1922%E2%80%9323%20in%20English%20football">1922–23 season</a>, when they were runners-up to Liverpool. They also came close the following season, finishing third, four points from the top of the league. The club escaped relegation from the First Division by one point in the <a href="1927%E2%80%9328%20in%20English%20football">1927–28 season</a> despite 35 goals from <a href="Dave%20Halliday">Dave Halliday</a>. The point was won in a match against Middlesbrough, and they finished in fifteenth place. Halliday improved his goal scoring to 43 goals in 42 games the following season, an all-time Sunderland record for goals scored in a single season.

The club's sixth league championship came in the <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20in%20English%20football">1935–36</a> season, and they won the FA Cup the following season, after a 3–1 victory against Preston North End at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>. The remainder of the decade saw mid-table finishes, until the league and FA Cup were suspended for the duration of the Second World War. Some football was still played as a morale boosting exercise, in the form of the <a href="Football%20League%20War%20Cup">Football League War Cup</a>. Sunderland were finalists in the tournament in <a href="1942%20Football%20League%20War%20Cup%20Final">1942</a>, but were beaten by <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>.

For Sunderland, the immediate post-war years were characterised by significant spending; the club paid £18,000 (£ today) for <a href="Carlisle%20United%20F.C.">Carlisle United</a>'s <a href="Ivor%20Broadis">Ivor Broadis</a> in January 1949. Broadis was also Carlisle's manager at the time, and this is the first instance of a player transferring himself to another club. This, along with record-breaking transfer fees to secure the services of <a href="Len%20Shackleton">Len Shackleton</a> and Welsh international <a href="Trevor%20Ford">Trevor Ford</a>, led to a contemporary nickname, the "<a href="Bank%20of%20England%20club">Bank of England club</a>". The club finished third in the First Division in <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20in%20English%20football">1950</a>, their highest finish since the 1936 championship.

The late 1950s saw a sharp downturn in Sunderland's fortunes, and the club was once again implicated in a major financial scandal in 1957. Found guilty of making payments to players in excess of the <a href="Salary%20cap">maximum wage</a>, they were fined £5,000 (£ today), and their chairman and three directors were suspended. The following year, Sunderland were <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">relegated</a> from the highest division for the first time in their 68-year league history.

Sunderland's absence from the top flight lasted six years. The club came within one game of promotion back to the First Division in the <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20in%20English%20football">1962–63 season</a>. Sunderland required only a draw in their final game against promotion rivals Chelsea, who had another game left to play after this match, to secure promotion. However, they were defeated, and Chelsea won their last game 7–0 to clinch promotion, finishing ahead of Sunderland on <a href="goal%20average">goal average</a>. After the close call in the previous season, the club was promoted to Division One in 1964 after finishing in second place. Sunderland beat <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> in the final stages of the season, where they clinched promotion with a game to spare. At the end of the decade, they were again relegated to the Second Division after finishing 21st.
Sunderland won their last major trophy in 1973, in a 1–0 victory over <a href="Don%20Revie">Don Revie</a>'s <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a> in the FA Cup Final. A <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> club at the time, Sunderland won the game thanks mostly to the efforts of their goalkeeper <a href="Jimmy%20Montgomery">Jimmy Montgomery</a>, who saved two of Leeds shots at goal in quick succession, one being from hot-shot <a href="Peter%20Lorimer">Peter Lorimer</a>. <a href="Ian%20Porterfield">Ian Porterfield</a> scored a <a href="volley%20%28football%29">volley</a> in the 30th minute to beat Leeds and take the trophy. Since 1973 only two other clubs, <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> in 1976, and <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> in 1980, have equalled Sunderland's achievement of lifting the FA Cup while playing outside the top tier of English football.

By winning the <a href="1973%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1973 FA Cup Final</a>, Sunderland qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a>, the club's only appearance in European competition to date. Sunderland beat <a href="Vasas%20SC">Vasas Budapest</a> 3–0 on <a href="Two-legged%20tie">aggregate</a>, and were drawn against Lisbon club <a href="Sporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal">Sporting</a> in the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%201973%E2%80%9374%23Second%20round">second round</a>. They won the first leg at <a href="Roker%20Park">Roker Park</a> 2–1 but were defeated 2–0 in the away leg, and were knocked out of the competition 3–2 on aggregate. After spending six seasons in the Second Division, Sunderland were promoted to Division One in the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20in%20English%20football">1975–76 season</a>; they topped the table over <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a> by three points. However, Sunderland were relegated the following season back into Division Two, without their FA Cup Final winning manager Bob Stokoe, who had resigned because of health problems at the start of the season. The club celebrated its 100-year centenary in the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20in%20English%20football">1979–80 season</a> with a <a href="testimonial%20match">testimonial</a> against an England XI side, which they lost 2–0.

Sunderland appeared in their first <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> <a href="1985%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">final</a> in 1985, but lost 1–0 to <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a>. In 1987, Sunderland saw one of the lowest points in their history, when they were relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> of the English league for the first time. Under new chairman <a href="Bob%20Murray%20%28businessman%29">Bob Murray</a> and new manager <a href="Denis%20Smith%20%28football%20manager%29">Denis Smith</a>, the club was promoted the following season. In 1990, they were promoted back to the top flight in unusual circumstances. Sunderland lost to <a href="Swindon%20Town%20F.C.">Swindon Town</a> in the play-off final, but Swindon's promotion was revoked after the club was found guilty of financial irregularities and Sunderland were promoted instead. They stayed up for one year before being relegated on the final day of the following season.

Sunderland's next outing in a major final came in <a href="1992%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1992</a> when, as a Second Division club, they returned to the FA Cup final. There was to be no repeat of the heroics of 1973, as Sunderland lost 2–0 to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>.

In 1995, they faced the prospect of a return to the third-tier of English football. <a href="Peter%20Reid">Peter Reid</a> was brought in as manager, and quickly turned things around. Reid's time in charge had a stabilising effect; he remained manager for seven years. After promotion from Division One in the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20in%20English%20football">1995–96 season</a>, Sunderland began their first season in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, but finished third from the bottom and were relegated back to the First Division. In 1997, Sunderland left <a href="Roker%20Park">Roker Park</a>, their home for 99 years. Bearing fond memories of the stadium, former Sunderland player <a href="Len%20Shackleton">Len Shackleton</a> said, "There will never be another place like Roker". The club moved to the <a href="Stadium%20of%20Light">Stadium of Light</a>, a 42,000-seat arena that, at the time, was the largest stadium built in England after the Second World War. The capacity was later increased to 49,000.
Sunderland returned to the Premier League as First Division champions in 1999 with a then-record 105 points. Sunderland's <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20in%20English%20football">1999–2000</a> season started at <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29">Stamford Bridge</a>, where Chelsea beat them 4–0. However, in the return match later in the season Sunderland turned the tables on Chelsea, avenging their 4–0 defeat with a 4–1 win at the Stadium of Light. Sunderland also achieved a 2–1 victory over rivals Newcastle United at St. James' Park, a result which helped bring about the resignation of Newcastle's manager, <a href="Ruud%20Gullit">Ruud Gullit</a>. At the end of the season Sunderland finished seventh, with <a href="Kevin%20Phillips%20%28footballer%29">Kevin Phillips</a> winning the <a href="European%20Golden%20Shoe">European Golden Shoe</a> in his first top-flight season, scoring 30 goals.

Another seventh-place finish in the 2000–01 season was followed by two less successful seasons, and they were relegated to the second-tier with a then-record low 19 points in 2003. Former <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Ireland</a> manager <a href="Mick%20McCarthy">Mick McCarthy</a> took over at the club, and, in 2005, he took Sunderland up as champions for the third time in less than 10 years. However, the club's stay in the top flight was short-lived as Sunderland were once again relegated, this time with a new record-low total of 15 points. McCarthy left the club in mid-season, and he was replaced temporarily by former Sunderland player <a href="Kevin%20Ball">Kevin Ball</a>. The record-low 15-point performance was surpassed in the <a href="Premier%20League%202007%E2%80%9308">2007–08 season</a> by <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a>, who finished on 11 points.

Following Sunderland's relegation from the Premier League, the club was taken over by the Irish <a href="Drumaville%20Consortium">Drumaville Consortium</a>, headed by ex-player <a href="Niall%20Quinn">Niall Quinn</a>, who appointed former <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> captain <a href="Roy%20Keane">Roy Keane</a> as the new manager. Under Keane, the club rose steadily up the table with an unbeaten run of 17 games to win promotion to the Premier League, and were named winners of the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Championship</a> after beating <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a> 5–0 at <a href="Kenilworth%20Road">Kenilworth Road</a> on 6 May 2007. Following an inconsistent start to the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football">2008–09 season</a>, Keane resigned. Before the start of the following campaign, Irish-American businessman <a href="Ellis%20Short">Ellis Short</a> completed a full takeover of the club, and <a href="Steve%20Bruce">Steve Bruce</a> was announced as the next manager on 3 June. One of Bruce's first signings, <a href="Darren%20Bent">Darren Bent</a>, cost a club record fee of £10 million, broken a year later when they bought Ghana international <a href="Asamoah%20Gyan">Asamoah Gyan</a> for around £13 million. Sunderland started the 2010–11 season strongly, but after Bent left for <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> in January 2011 in a deal potentially worth £24 million, a record transfer fee received for the club, they eventually finished 10th — which was still their highest top-flight finish for 10 years.

Short replaced Quinn as chairman in October 2011, with Quinn becoming Director of International Development. Bruce was sacked in November 2011, and replaced by <a href="Martin%20O%27Neill">Martin O'Neill</a>. In February 2012, Quinn left the club with immediate effect. O'Neill was sacked in March 2013 and Italian <a href="Paolo%20Di%20Canio">Paolo Di Canio</a> was announced as his replacement the following day. The appointment prompted the immediate resignation of club Vice Chairman <a href="David%20Miliband">David Miliband</a> due to Di Canio's "past political statements". Sunderland went on to avoid relegation with one game to go. Di Canio was sacked after a poor start to the 2013–14 season, and reports of a complete breakdown in relations with his players. <a href="Gus%20Poyet">Gus Poyet</a> was announced as his replacement, and led Sunderland to the <a href="2014%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">2014 Football League Cup Final</a>, where they were defeated 3–1 by <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. In March 2015 Poyet was sacked, and veteran Dutchman <a href="Dick%20Advocaat">Dick Advocaat</a> was appointed as the club's new head coach, saving the club from relegation. Eight games into the 2015–16 season he resigned from the position. <a href="Sam%20Allardyce">Sam Allardyce</a> was appointed the next manager in October 2015, and the club was again saved from relegation at the end of the season.

In July 2016, Allardyce left the club to be announced as manager for the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">English national team</a>, and former Everton and Manchester United manager <a href="David%20Moyes">David Moyes</a> was appointed as his replacement. Under Moyes, Sunderland made the worst ever start to a Premier League season, taking just two points from their opening 10 matches. The club was relegated to the second tier for the first time in 10 years at the end of the 2016–17 season, finishing bottom of the table with 24 points, and Moyes resigned as manager. In June 2017, goalkeeper <a href="Jordan%20Pickford">Jordan Pickford</a>, a product of Sunderland's academy who joined the club aged eight, was transferred to Everton for a fee of £25 million, rising to a possible £30 million, a record for a British goalkeeper.

Following a poor run of form in the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20EFL%20Championship">2017–18 EFL Championship</a> season (which was documented in the <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a> series "<a href="Sunderland%20%27Til%20I%20Die">Sunderland 'Til I Die</a>"), manager <a href="Simon%20Grayson">Simon Grayson</a> was sacked, and <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Wales</a> head coach <a href="Chris%20Coleman%20%28footballer%29">Chris Coleman</a> replaced him in November 2017. In April 2018, after a second consecutive relegation, this time to <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a>, Coleman was sacked and the club was sold to a group led by <a href="Stewart%20Donald">Stewart Donald</a>, chairman of <a href="Eastleigh%20F.C.">Eastleigh F.C.</a> 

<a href="St%20Mirren%20F.C.">St Mirren</a> manager <a href="Jack%20Ross%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201976%29">Jack Ross</a> was appointed as manager in May 2018 to take charge of what is only the club's second ever season in the third flight of the English football league system.

Sunderland played in an all blue <a href="Kit%20%28association%20football%29">strip</a> from their formation until 1884, when they adopted a red and white halved strip. They assumed the current strip of red and white stripes in the <a href="1887%E2%80%9388%20in%20English%20football">1887–88 season</a>. Their badge included a ship, the upper part of the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Sunderland">Sunderland coat of arms</a>, a black cat, and a football in front of Sunderland's red and white stripes. In 1977 the badge was changed, but still included the ship, football and the background of red and white stripes.

This badge was used until the relocation from Roker Park to the Stadium of Light. To coincide with the move, Sunderland released a new crest divided into four quarters; the upper right and lower left featured their traditional red and white colours, but the ship was omitted. The upper left section features the <a href="Penshaw%20Monument">Penshaw Monument</a> and the lower right section shows the <a href="Wearmouth%20Bridge">Wearmouth Bridge</a>. A colliery wheel at the top of the crest commemorates County Durham's mining history, and the land the Stadium of Light was built on, formerly the <a href="Monkwearmouth%20Colliery">Monkwearmouth Colliery</a>. The crest also contains two lions, the black cats of Sunderland, and a banner displaying the club's motto, "Consectatio Excellentiae", which means "In pursuit of excellence".

Sunderland have had eight grounds throughout their history; the first was at <a href="Blue%20House%20Field">Blue House Field</a> in <a href="Hendon%2C%20Sunderland">Hendon</a> in 1879. The ground was close to the place where Sunderland formed, at Hendon Board School; at that time the rent for use of the ground was £10 (£ today). The club then used a number of fields, one of which was near The Cedars road, before relocating to <a href="Groves%20Field">Groves Field</a> in <a href="Ashbrooke">Ashbrooke</a> in 1882 for one season. The club's third stadium was <a href="Horatio%20Street">Horatio Street</a> in <a href="Roker">Roker</a>, the first Sunderland stadium north of the <a href="River%20Wear">River Wear</a>; the club played a single season there before another move, this time to <a href="Abbs%20Field">Abbs Field</a> in <a href="Fulwell%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Fulwell</a> for two seasons. Abbs Field was notable for being the first Sunderland ground to which they charged admission.

Sunderland moved to <a href="Newcastle%20Road%20%28stadium%29">Newcastle Road</a> in 1886. By 1898, the ground reached a capacity of 15,000 after renovations, and its rent had risen to £100 (£ today) a year. Near the turn of the 20th century, Sunderland needed a bigger stadium. They returned to Roker and set up home in <a href="Roker%20Park">Roker Park</a>. It was opened on 10 September 1898, and the home team played a match the same day against <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, which they won. The stadium's capacity increased to 50,000 after redevelopment with architect <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a> in 1913. Sunderland were nearly bankrupted by the cost of renovating the Main Stand, and Roker Park was put up for sale but no further action was taken. On 8 March 1933, an overcrowded Roker Park recorded the highest ever attendance at a Sunderland match, 75,118 against <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> in a <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> sixth round replay. Roker Park suffered a bombing in 1943, in which one corner of the stadium was destroyed. A <a href="special%20constable">special constable</a> was killed while patrolling the stadium. By the 1990s, the stadium was no longer large enough, and had no room for possible expansion. In January 1990, the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> was released after overcrowding at the <a href="Hillsborough%20Stadium">Hillsborough Stadium</a> resulted in 96 deaths, an incident known as the <a href="Hillsborough%20Disaster">Hillsborough Disaster</a>. The report recommended that all major stadiums must be converted to an all-seater design. As a result, Roker Park's capacity was reduced. It was demolished in 1997 and a housing estate built in its place. 
In 1997, Sunderland moved to their present ground, <a href="Stadium%20of%20Light">Stadium of Light</a> in <a href="Monkwearmouth">Monkwearmouth</a>, which was opened by <a href="Prince%20Andrew%2C%20Duke%20of%20York">Prince Andrew, Duke of York</a>. Built with an original capacity of 42,000, it hosted its first game against Dutch team <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a>. The stadium bears a similar name to the Portuguese club <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a>'s ground <a href="Est%C3%A1dio%20da%20Luz">Estádio da Luz</a>, albeit in a different language. Stadium expansion in 2000 saw the capacity increase to 49,000. A <a href="Davy%20lamp">Davy lamp</a> monument stands outside the stadium, and a miners banner was presented to the club by the <a href="Durham%20Miners%27%20Association">Durham Miners' Association</a>, as a reminder of the <a href="Monkwearmouth%20Colliery">Monkwearmouth Colliery</a> pit the stadium was built on.

Sunderland held the seventh highest average home attendance out of the 20 clubs in the Premier League at the end of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Premier%20League">2013–14</a> season with an average of 41,089, and held the sixth highest average attendance in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Premier%20League">2014–15</a> season with an average of over 43,000. Sunderland fans often sell out allocations for away games: in the 2013–14 season, 9,000 Sunderland fans attended <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a> for the second leg of the Football League Cup semi-final, which they won to go through to the final. At Wembley, London was taken over by thousands of <a href="Mackem">Mackem</a>s, the sights of Covent Garden and Leicester Square were awash with red and white, local shops completely sold out of alcohol but only one arrest was reported by the police. Support is drawn from across the <a href="North%20East%20England">North East</a>, in particular <a href="County%20Durham">County Durham</a>, and beyond. The club has many supporter branches across the world, including the United States, Australia, Canada, Cambodia, and Greece. According to <a href="YouGov">YouGov</a> statistics, supporters of Sunderland predominantly lean to the political <a href="left-wing">left</a>, and often sing "<a href="The%20Red%20Flag">The Red Flag</a>" during games.
Traditionally, Sunderland's main rivals are Newcastle United, with whom they contest the <a href="Tyne%E2%80%93Wear%20derby">Tyne–Wear derby</a>. The club shared a rivalry with the now defunct <a href="Sunderland%20Albion">Sunderland Albion</a> in the 1880s and 1890s, a breakaway club formed by Sunderland's founder James Allan. Sections of fans share a mutual friendship with Dutch club <a href="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a>; this was developed after Wearside shipbuilders found jobs in Rotterdam during the 1970s and 80s.

The club had an official quarterly magazine, called the "Legion of Light", which season ticket holders received at no cost. It was discontinued in January 2017. One of the club's current <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>s is "<a href="A%20Love%20Supreme%20%28Sunderland%29">A Love Supreme</a>". Others in the past have been "It's The Hope I Can't Stand", "It's An Easy One For Norman/It's An Easy One For Given", "Sex and Chocolate", "Wise Men Say" and "The Roker Roar" (later "The Wearside Roar"). In recent years, blogging sites such as "<a href="Roker%20Report">Roker Report</a>" have been popular. A charity, the <a href="Foundation%20of%20Light">Foundation of Light</a>, is affiliated with the club and helps recruit new players into professional football.

Sunderland have recently created affiliations with several African clubs including Ghana's <a href="Asante%20Kotoko%20SC">Asante Kotoko</a>, Egypt's <a href="El-Ittihad%20El-Iskandary">El-Ittihad El-Iskandary</a> and South Africa's <a href="Bidvest%20Wits%20F.C.">Bidvest Wits</a>. Sunderland also have an affiliation with Belgian side <a href="Lierse%20S.K.">Lierse S.K.</a>, allowing the possibility for young African players who would not qualify for a UK work permit to spend three years with Lierse to gain a Belgian passport. In August 2014, Sunderland announced a commercial partnership with <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington D.C.</a> based <a href="MLS">MLS</a> club <a href="D.C.%20United">D.C. United</a>.

Sunderland's official nickname is 'The Black Cats'. The previous nickname, 'The Rokerites', was made redundant after the club left Roker Park for the Stadium of Light in 1997. The new name was decided upon in a public vote that year.

Despite the nickname being made official only relatively recently, the black cat has been used as an emblem of the club throughout most of its history. Photographs exist of players holding a black cat which made Roker Park its home in the 1900s and 1910s, and which was fed and watered by the football club. The club's first official badge featured a black cat sitting prominently in its centre. Since the 1960s the emblem of the Sunderland A.F.C. Supporters Association has been a black cat. A Sunderland supporter, Billy Morris, took a black cat in his top pocket as a good luck charm to the 1937 FA Cup final in which Sunderland brought home the trophy for the first time. Reference has also been made to a "Black Cat Battery", an <a href="Artillery%20battery">Artillery battery</a> based on the <a href="River%20Wear">River Wear</a> during the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>.

As well as club nicknames, names have been used to define memorable periods in the club's history. The "Team of All Talents" moniker was used during Sunderland's successful period in the 1890s, and Sunderland were known as the "<a href="Bank%20of%20England">Bank of England</a> club" during the 1950s. This was in reference to the club's spending in the <a href="transfer%20market">transfer market</a> at the time, which saw the transfer-record broken twice.

The holder of the record for the most league appearances is <a href="Jimmy%20Montgomery">Jimmy Montgomery</a>, having made 527 first team appearances between 1961 and 1976. The club's top league goal scorer is <a href="Charlie%20Buchan">Charlie Buchan</a>, who scored 209 goals from 1911–1925; <a href="Bobby%20Gurney">Bobby Gurney</a> is the record goalscorer over all competitions with 228 goals between 1926 and 1939. <a href="Dave%20Halliday">Dave Halliday</a> holds the record for the most goals scored in a season: 43 in the <a href="1928%E2%80%9329%20in%20English%20football">1928–29 season</a> in the Football League First Division. As of October 2014 <a href="John%20O%27Shea">John O'Shea</a> is the most capped player for the club, making 100 appearances for the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Republic of Ireland</a>.

The club's widest victory margin in the league was in the 9–1 win against Newcastle United in the First Division in 1908. Sunderland's biggest ever win in the FA cup was against Fair field (a non-league team) and the final score was 11–1. Their heaviest defeats in the league were 8–0 against <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> in 1911, <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> in 1968, <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a> in 1982 and <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> in 2014 Sunderland joined the top division in England, <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a>, in the <a href="1890%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football">1890–91 season</a> and were not relegated until <a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20in%20English%20football">1957–58</a> (a span of 67 seasons). In October 2015, Sunderland defeated rivals Newcastle United for the sixth consecutive time, a new record.

Sunderland's record home attendance is 75,200 for a sixth round replay FA Cup match against Derby County on 8 March 1933.

11 Sunderland players have scored 100 goals or more in all competitions. They are as follows:

The biggest transfer fee Sunderland have ever received for one of their players is £30 million for <a href="Jordan%20Pickford">Jordan Pickford</a> who moved to <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> on 1 July 2017. The biggest fee Sunderland have received for a player produced by the Sunderland academy is £30 million for <a href="Jordan%20Pickford">Jordan Pickford</a>, who moved to <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> on 1 July 2017. The biggest transfer fee paid by Sunderland is the eventual £17.1 million for <a href="Didier%20Ibrahim%20Ndong">Didier Ndong</a>, who was bought from <a href="FC%20Lorient">FC Lorient</a> in August 2016.

As of the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Sunderland%20A.F.C.%20season">2018–19 season</a>

The first sponsor to appear on Sunderland kits was Cowie's, the business group of then chairman <a href="Tom%20Cowie">Tom Cowie</a>, between 1983–85. The club was sponsored by the <a href="Vaux%20Breweries">Vaux Breweries</a> between 1985 and 1999, with drink brands such as Lambtons sometimes appearing on kits. Subsequently, the club were sponsored by Sunderland car dealership company Reg Vardy from 1999 to 2007. Sunderland were sponsored by the Irish bookmaker <a href="Boylesports">Boylesports</a>, who signed a four-year contract with the club in 2007 estimated to be worth £8 million. In April 2010, Sunderland signed a two-year shirt sponsorship deal with <a href="Tombola%20%28bingo%20company%29">tombola</a>, a local online bingo company. On 25 June 2012, Sunderland announced the strengthening of their partnership with the Invest in Africa initiative, with the initiative becoming the club's shirt sponsor for two years. The project is closely linked with <a href="Tullow%20Oil">Tullow Oil</a>. However, after a year the club announced a new sponsorship deal with South African company <a href="Bidvest%20Group">Bidvest</a>. On 1 June 2015 Sunderland announced a new sponsorship with <a href="Dafabet">Dafabet</a> to appear on the kits for the following season.

Mistle thrush

The mistle thrush ("Turdus viscivorus") is a bird common to much of Europe, Asia and North Africa. It is a year-round resident in a large part of its range, but northern and eastern populations <a href="bird%20migration">migrate</a> south for the winter, often in small flocks. It is a large <a href="Thrush%20%28bird%29">thrush</a> with pale grey-brown upper parts, a greyish-white chin and throat, and black spots on its pale yellow and off-white under parts. The sexes are similar in <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, and its three <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> show only minimal differences. The male has a loud, far-carrying song which is delivered even in wet and windy weather, earning the bird the old name of stormcock.

Found in open woods, parks, hedges and cultivated land, the mistle thrush feeds on a wide variety of <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, seeds and berries. Its preferred fruits include those of the <a href="Viscum%20album">mistletoe</a>, <a href="holly">holly</a> and <a href="yew">yew</a>. Mistletoe is favoured where it is available, and this is reflected in the thrush's English and scientific names; the plant, a <a href="parasitic">parasitic</a> species, benefits from its seeds being excreted by the thrush onto branches where they can <a href="germinate">germinate</a>. In winter, a mistle thrush will vigorously defend mistletoe clumps or a holly tree as a food reserve for when times are hard.

The open <a href="cup%20nest">cup nest</a> is built against a trunk or in a forked branch, and is fearlessly defended against potential predators, sometimes including humans or cats. The <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a>, typically of three to five eggs, is <a href="Egg%20incubation">incubated</a> for 12–15 days, mainly by the female. The chicks <a href="fledge">fledge</a> about 14–16 days after hatching. There are normally two broods. There was a large range expansion in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and a small decline in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in agricultural practices. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is classified by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> as being of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>.

The mistle thrush was first described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his "<a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">Systema naturae</a>" in 1758 under its current <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">scientific names</a>. "Turdus" is the Latin for "thrush", and "viscivorus", "mistletoe eater", comes from "viscum" "mistletoe" and "vorare", "to devour". The bird's liking for <a href="viscum%20album">mistletoe</a> berries is also indicated by its English name, "mistle" being an old name for the plant.

There are more than 60 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus "Turdus", characterised by rounded heads, longish pointed wings, and usually melodious songs. A <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> study identified the mistle thrush's closest relatives as the similarly plumaged <a href="Song%20thrush">song</a> and <a href="Chinese%20thrush">Chinese thrush</a>es; these three species are early offshoots from the Eurasian lineage of "Turdus" thrushes after they spread north from Africa. They are less closely related to other European thrush species such as the <a href="Common%20blackbird">blackbird</a> ("T. merula") which are descended from ancestors that had colonised the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> islands from Africa and subsequently reached Europe from there.

At least eight <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> have been proposed, but the differences are mainly <a href="cline%20%28biology%29">clinal</a>, with birds of the <a href="nominate%20subspecies">nominate subspecies</a> becoming paler and less densely spotted in the east of the range. The currently accepted subspecies are:
An isolated population in <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a> has sometimes been separated as "T. v. tauricus", but this is not considered to be a valid form. Mistle thrush fossils have been found in <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> deposits from Poland and Sicily.

The mistle thrush is the largest thrush native to Europe. The nominate subspecies measures in length, with a wingspan. It weighs , with an average of around . It has a stocky upright posture when on the ground. It has pale grey-brown upperparts, the chin and throat are greyish-white, and the yellowish-buff breast and off-white belly are marked with round black spots. The spotting becomes denser on the lower chest, giving the appearance of a breast-band. The long tail has white tips on the outer feathers, and the underwing <a href="Covert%20feather">coverts</a> are white. The eyes are dark brown and the bill is blackish with a yellowish base to the lower <a href="mandible">mandible</a>. The legs and feet are yellowish-brown. There are no plumage differences between the sexes. Juveniles are similar to adults, but they have paler upperparts with creamy centres to many of the feathers and smaller spots on the yellowish underparts. By their first winter they are very similar to adults, but the underparts are usually more buff-toned.

The eastern subspecies "T. v. bonapartei" is in length, and therefore slightly larger than the nominate form. It is paler grey above and whiter below, with fewer black spots. Birds of intermediate appearance are seen west of the <a href="Ob%20River">Ob River</a> where the range overlaps with "viscivorus". The southern race "T. v. deichleri" resembles "bonapartei" in appearance, but is closer in size to the nominate "viscivorus", although it has a more slender bill.

Adults have a full <a href="moult">moult</a> after breeding, beginning between late May and the end of June, and completed by early October. Juvenile birds have a partial moult, replacing their head, body, and covert feathers; this is completed by October, although the start of the moult depends on when the chicks hatched.

The mistle thrush is much larger, paler and longer-tailed than the <a href="sympatric">sympatric</a> song thrush. In the western Himalayas it could be confused with both the <a href="Plain-backed%20thrush">plain-backed</a> and the <a href="long-tailed%20thrush">long-tailed thrush</a>es. These are similar to the mistle thrush, but the plain–backed thrush lacks obvious wing bars, is more <a href="rufous">rufous</a> above than its relative, and is barred rather than spotted below. The long-tailed thrush has olive-toned upperparts, bars on its breast and two wing bars. Juvenile mistle thrushes are superficially similar to <a href="White%27s%20thrush">White's thrush</a>, but that species has golden-yellow plumage, scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern.

The male mistle thrush has a loud melodious song with fluted whistles, sounding like "chewee-trewuu ... trureetruuruu" or similar, repeated three to six times, and used to advertise his territory, attract a mate and maintain the pair bond. The tone resembles that of the song thrush or blackbird, but compared to its relatives the mistle thrush's repertoire is less varied and the delivery is slower. The song is, however, much louder, often audible up to 2 km (2,000 yd) away. The song is given from a treetop or other elevated position mainly from November to early June. The male is most vocal in the early morning, and its tendency to sing after, and sometimes during, wet and windy weather led to the old name "stormcock". The song may be heard in any month, although it is uncommon from July to August while the thrush is moulting. The main call, given by both sexes, is a dry chattering "krrrr", louder when it is alarmed or excited. It is often likened to the sound of a football rattle, a form of <a href="ratchet%20%28instrument%29">musical ratchet</a>. There is also a squeaky "tuk" contact call.

The mistle thrush breeds in much of Europe and temperate Asia, although it is absent from the treeless far north, and its range becomes discontinuous in southeast Europe, Turkey and the Middle East. In these warmer southern areas, it tends to be found in the milder uplands and coastal regions. Nominate "T. v. viscivorus" breeds in Europe and in Asia east to the Ob, beyond which it is replaced by "T. v. bonapartei". The southern form "T. v. deichleri" is resident in North Africa, <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a> and <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>.

The mistle thrush is a partial <a href="bird%20migration">migrant</a>: birds from the north and east of the range wintering in the milder areas of Europe and North Africa. Scandinavian and Russian birds start moving south from mid-September onwards, most birds wintering in Europe, western Turkey and the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>. Between mid-October and November, large numbers cross the <a href="Strait%20of%20Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a> and others pass through Cyprus, but there is hardly any migration across the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. Breeding birds in the British Isles and north-west Europe are resident or move only short distances. In the Himalayas, the breeding population moves to nearby lower-altitude sites in winter. Return migration starts mainly from late March, although it can be a month earlier in the Middle East, and northern breeders may not arrive back on their territories until late April or early May. Migration may be by day or night, and typically involves individuals or small groups. Vagrant birds have occurred in the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>, China, <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a>, Iceland, Japan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, <a href="Sikkim">Sikkim</a> and the United Arab Emirates. In the winter 2017/2018 the first record of a mistle thrush for North America was at <a href="Miramichi">Miramichi</a> in <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>.

The mistle thrush is found in a wide range of habitats containing trees, including forests, plantations, hedges and town parks. In the south and east of its range, it inhabits upland <a href="coniferous">coniferous</a> woodland and the range extends above the main <a href="tree%20line">tree line</a> where dwarf <a href="Juniperus%20communis">juniper</a> is present. Breeding occurs at up to in the mountains of North Africa, and occasionally much higher, to . In the highlands of Europe, its preferred altitude is from . More open habitats, such as agricultural land, moors and grassy hills, are extensively used in winter or on migration.

There is evidence that this species has changed its natural habitat in at least parts of its range. In Germany and elsewhere in central Europe, it was found only in coniferous forest until the mid-1920s when its range rapidly expanded, first into farmland, and then to suburbs and urban parks. The reasons for this expansion are unclear. In areas of <a href="intensive%20farming">intensive farming</a>, such as eastern England, <a href="arable%20land">arable land</a> has in turn largely been abandoned in favour of built-up areas with their greater variety of green habitats.

Perhaps the most notable find of the 118th <a href="Christmas%20Bird%20Count">Christmas Bird Count</a> in Canada was a single vagrant Mistle Thrush found in <a href="Miramichi%2C%20New%20Brunswick">Miramichi, New Brunswick</a>. This was the first record for this species in North America. The discovery attracted many birders from Canada and the United States; sightings continued from early December 2017 through late March 2018.

Mistle thrushes are found as individuals or pairs for much of the year, although families forage together in late summer, and groups may merge to form large flocks when food sources are plentiful. It is not uncommon for up to 50 thrushes to feed together at that time of year. They roost at night in trees or bushes, again typically as individuals or pairs, except in late summer or autumn when families may roost together.

The mistle thrush is quite terrestrial, hopping with its head held up and body erect; when excited, it will flick its wings and tail. The flight consists of undulating bounds interspersed with glides.

Mistle thrushes breed in the year subsequent to their hatching; they are <a href="monogamous">monogamous</a> and stay as a pair throughout the year in areas where they are not migratory. Their territories are much larger than those of blackbirds or song thrushes; although the nest territory is only about , around is used for feeding. Territories are normally reoccupied in subsequent years. Territories are larger in woods than in farmland. The male will attack intruders into its breeding area, including <a href="birds%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> and <a href="corvids">corvids</a>, and sometimes cats or humans. Courtship feeding of the female by her partner has sometimes been observed.
Breeding typically commences in mid-March in the south and west of Europe (late February in Britain), but not till early May in Finland. The nest is usually built in a tree in the fork of a branch or against the trunk, although hedges, ledges on buildings and cliff faces may also be used. The nest site may be up to above the ground, although is more typical. The <a href="common%20chaffinch">common chaffinch</a> often nests close to a mistle thrush, the vigilance of the chaffinch and the aggressive behaviour of the thrush benefiting both species. The thrush's nest is a large cup of sticks, dry grass, roots and moss, coated on the inside with a layer of mud and lined with fine grass and leaves. The nest is built by the female, although the male may help. Nests built early in the breeding season may be destroyed by bad weather.

The <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> is typically three to five eggs (range two to six), which are usually whitish-buff or greenish-blue and are spotted with red, purple or brown. The average size of the egg is , and weighs , of which 6% is shell. The eggs are <a href="incubate%20%28bird%29">incubated</a> for 12–15 days, mainly by the female. The chicks are <a href="altricial">altricial</a> and downy, and are fed by both parents. They <a href="fledge">fledge</a> about 14–16 days after hatching. There are normally two broods, except in Siberia, where there is only one, the male feeding the fledglings from the first brood while the female sits on the second clutch. Sometimes the same nest is reused for both broods. The young are dependent on their parents for 15–20 days after fledging.

In a study carried out in Britain, the survival rate for juveniles in their first year is 57 per cent, and the adult annual survival rate is 62 per cent. Life expectancy is typically three years, but the maximum age recorded from <a href="bird%20ringing">bird ringing</a> recoveries is 21 years and 3 months for a bird shot in Switzerland.

Mistle thrushes feed mainly on <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, fruit and berries. Animal prey include earthworms, insects and other <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s, slugs and snails. Snails are sometimes smashed on a stone "anvil", a technique also used by the song thrush. The mistle thrush has been known to kill <a href="slowworms">slowworms</a> and the young of the song thrush, blackbird and <a href="dunnock">dunnock</a>.

Plant food includes the fruits and seeds of bushes and trees, mainly holly, yew, ivy and mistletoe, but also, for example, blackberry, cherry, elder, hawthorn, olive and rose. It may eat the flowers and shoots of grasses and other plants, and will take fallen apples and plums. It forages within its breeding habitat and in open fields, sometimes sharing these feeding areas with <a href="redwing">redwing</a>s or <a href="fieldfare">fieldfare</a>s.

Young birds are initially mainly fed on invertebrates, often collected from low foliage or under bushes rather than in the grassland preferred by the adults. Adults will roam up to 1 km (approximately 1,100 yards) from the nest on pasture or ploughed land. After fledging the young may accompany their parents until the onset of winter. Individuals or pairs will defend one or more fruit-bearing trees throughout the winter, with preference shown for trees which host mistletoe, the parasitic plant from which the bird derives its name. Where mistletoe is not present, holly is the most common tree chosen. Although the thrush normally feeds on the ground and from low bushes, the defence of this resource conserves fruit for later in the season when other food items become scarce. The trees are defended against other thrushes as well as birds such as the <a href="bullfinch">bullfinch</a> and <a href="great%20spotted%20woodpecker">great spotted woodpecker</a>. In milder winters with an abundance of fruit, however, this strategy is less used and thrushes can be observed foraging in flocks. Conversely, in hard winters, the defender may be overwhelmed by large flocks of fieldfares, redwings or <a href="Bohemian%20waxwing">Bohemian waxwing</a>s.

As its name implies, the mistle thrush is important in <a href="plant%20propagation">propagating</a> the mistletoe, an aerial parasite, which needs its seeds to be deposited on the branches of suitable trees. The highly nutritious fruits are favoured by the thrush, which digests the flesh leaving the sticky seeds to be excreted, possibly in a suitable location for germination.

The mistle thrush is predated upon by a wide variety of birds of prey, including the <a href="boreal%20owl">boreal owl</a>, <a href="short-eared%20owl">short-eared owl</a>, <a href="tawny%20owl">tawny owl</a>, <a href="Ural%20owl">Ural owl</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20eagle-owl">Eurasian eagle-owl</a>, <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>, <a href="Common%20kestrel">kestrel</a>, <a href="common%20buzzard">common buzzard</a>, <a href="red%20kite">red kite</a>, <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a>, <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>, and <a href="Eurasian%20sparrowhawk">sparrowhawk</a>. The eggs and chicks may be targeted by <a href="cat">cat</a>s and corvids. Parent birds exhibit fearlessness in defence of their nests, occasionally even attacking humans. The mistle thrush is not normally a host of the <a href="common%20cuckoo">common cuckoo</a>, a <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a>.

External parasites of the mistle thrush include the <a href="hen%20flea">hen flea</a>, the <a href="moorhen%20flea">moorhen flea</a>, the <a href="castor%20bean%20tick">castor bean tick</a> and the brightly coloured <a href="Trombicula%20autumnalis">harvest mite</a>. Internally, they can suffer from parasites including <a href="cestoda">tapeworm</a>, <a href="nematode">nematode</a>s, and "<a href="Syngamus%20merulae">Syngamus merulae</a>" (a species of Gapeworm). Blood parasites can include "<a href="Trypanosoma">Trypanosoma</a>" and "<a href="Plasmodium">Plasmodium</a>" species.

The mistle thrush has an extensive distribution in Europe and western Asia, and its European breeding population is estimated at 9–22.2 million birds. When Asian breeders are added, this gives a global total of 12.2–44.4 million. The species was formerly more restricted in range, and rarely bred even in northern England in the 1700s. It expanded rapidly into lowland and coastal areas of Europe during the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century, colonising areas where it was formerly rare or absent, such as Ireland (where it first bred in 1807), Scotland and the Netherlands. The range also increased in Denmark, Norway, Hungary and Austria.

Although the population now appears to be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is therefore classified by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> as being of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>. The perceived decline may be due to the loss of invertebrate-rich pastures and mixed farms through conversion to arable agriculture or more intensively managed grassland. Adult survival, clutch size and fledging success are all lower in arable landscapes than in areas with extensive pasture. In Finland, the loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline.

<a href="Desiderius%20Erasmus">Desiderius Erasmus</a>'s early sixteenth-century collection of Latin proverbs included "Turdus malum sibi ipse cacat", (the thrush himself excretes his own trouble), which refers to the use of the sticky mistletoe berries favoured by this species as an ingredient in <a href="birdlime">birdlime</a>, used to trap birds. The thrush was seen to be thus spreading the seeds of his own destruction.

"Mistle Thrush and Alpine Chough", by <a href="Giovanni%20da%20Udine">Giovanni da Udine</a>, an artist who worked in <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>'s studio in the 16th century, was a sketch for his "Bird with Garland and Fruit", and this in turn was the basis for a Raphael <a href="fresco">fresco</a> in the <a href="Apostolic%20Palace">Apostolic Palace</a>.

The early <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> poem "The Harmony of Birds" features a thrusshe (mistle thrush) singing the phrase "sanctus, sanctus", distinguishing the bird from the song thrush, the "mauys" or "throstle". The song of the mistle thrush is also described in <a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a>'s "Darkling Thrush" and <a href="Edward%20Thomas%20%28poet%29">Edward Thomas's</a> "The Thrush". The loud call of this common and conspicuous bird also led to many old or local names, including "screech", "shrite" and "gawthrush". Other names, including "stormcock" referred to its willingness to sing in wind and rain. "Holm thrush", "hollin cock" and "holm cock" are based on obsolete names for the holly tree, which may be defended by the thrush in winter for its berries.

In <a href="Frances%20Hodgson%20Burnett">Frances Hodgson Burnett</a>'s "<a href="The%20Secret%20Garden">The Secret Garden</a>", Dickon reassures Mary Lennox that he will keep his knowledge of the garden secret by comparing her to a mistle thrush in defence of its nest, recognising his privilege in sharing her secret: "If tha' was a missel thrush an' showed me where thy nest was, does tha' think I'd tell any one? Not me," he said. "Tha' art as safe as a missel thrush."

"<a href="Stormcock%20%28album%29">Stormcock</a>", released in 1971, is the fifth album by English folk/rock singer-songwriter and guitarist <a href="Roy%20Harper%20%28singer%29">Roy Harper</a>.

The final verse of the <a href="Jethro%20Tull%20%28band%29">Jethro Tull</a> song "Jack-in-the-Green" from their album "<a href="Songs%20from%20the%20Wood">Songs from the Wood</a>" mentions the bird in the lines "Oh, the mistlethrush is coming. Jack, put out the light." The bird also features in the lyrics of <a href="The%20Decemberists">The Decemberists</a>' song "Won't Want For Love (Margaret In The Taiga)" from their 2009 album "<a href="The%20Hazards%20of%20Love">The Hazards of Love</a>": "Mistlethrush, Mistlethrush, Lay me down in the underbrush, My naked feet grow weary with the dusk".

Everglades National Park

Everglades National Park is an American <a href="national%20park">national park</a> that protects the southern twenty percent of the original <a href="Everglades">Everglades</a> in <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. The park is the largest tropical wilderness in the United States, and the largest wilderness of any kind east of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>. An average of one million people visit the park each year. Everglades is the third-largest national park in the <a href="contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous United States</a> after <a href="Death%20Valley%20National%20Park">Death Valley</a> and <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone</a>. <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> declared the <a href="Everglades%20%26amp%3B%20Dry%20Tortugas%20Biosphere%20Reserve">Everglades & Dry Tortugas Biosphere Reserve</a> in 1976, and listed the park as a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> in 1979, while the <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar Convention</a> included the park on its list of <a href="List%20of%20Ramsar%20wetlands%20of%20international%20importance">Wetlands of International Importance</a> in 1987. Everglades is one of only three locations in the world to appear on all three lists.

Most national parks preserve unique geographic features; Everglades National Park was the first created to protect a fragile <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>. The Everglades are a network of wetlands and forests fed by a river flowing per day out of <a href="Lake%20Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a>, southwest into <a href="Florida%20Bay">Florida Bay</a>. The park is the most significant breeding ground for tropical <a href="wading%20bird">wading bird</a>s in North America and contains the largest <a href="Florida%20mangroves">mangrove</a> ecosystem in the Western Hemisphere. Thirty-six <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a> or protected species inhabit the park, including the <a href="Florida%20panther">Florida panther</a>, the <a href="American%20crocodile">American crocodile</a>, and the <a href="West%20Indian%20manatee">West Indian manatee</a>, along with 350 species of birds, 300 species of fresh and saltwater fish, 40 species of mammals, and 50 species of reptiles. The majority of <a href="South%20Florida">South Florida</a>'s fresh water, which is stored in the <a href="Biscayne%20Aquifer">Biscayne Aquifer</a>, is recharged in the park.

Humans have lived for thousands of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 to drain the wetlands and develop the land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed, water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable explosive growth of the <a href="South%20Florida%20metropolitan%20area">South Florida metropolitan area</a>. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal building projects were initiated across South Florida. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in South Florida.

Everglades National Park covers , throughout <a href="Miami-Dade%20County%2C%20Florida">Dade</a>, <a href="Monroe%20County%2C%20Florida">Monroe</a>, and <a href="Collier%20County%2C%20Florida">Collier</a> counties in Florida, at the southern tip of the <a href="Atlantic%20coastal%20plain">Atlantic coastal plain</a>. The elevation typically ranges from 0 to above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>, but a <a href="Calusa">Calusa</a>-built <a href="shell%20mound">shell mound</a> on the <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">Gulf Coast</a> rises above sea level.

The terrain of South Florida is relatively and consistently flat. The <a href="limestone">limestone</a> that underlies the Everglades is integral to the diverse ecosystems within the park. Florida was once part of the African portion of the supercontinent <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>. After it separated, conditions allowed a shallow marine environment to deposit <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a> in sand, shells, and coral to be converted into limestone. Tiny bits of shell, sand, and <a href="bryozoan">bryozoan</a>s compressed over multiple layers forming structures in the limestone called <a href="ooids">ooids</a>, which created permeable conditions that hold water.

The Florida peninsula appeared above sea level between 100,000 and 150,000 years ago. As sea levels rose at the end of the <a href="Wisconsin%20glaciation">Wisconsin ice age</a>, the <a href="water%20table">water table</a> appeared closer to land. Lake Okeechobee began to flood, and convection thunderstorms were created. Vast <a href="peat">peat</a> deposits south of Lake Okeechobee indicate that regular flooding had occurred about 5,000 years ago. Plants began to migrate, subtropical ones from the northern part of Florida, and tropicals carried as seeds by birds from islands in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. The limestone shelf appears to be flat, but there are slight rises—called pinnacles—and depressions caused by the erosion of limestone by the acidic properties of the water. The amount of time throughout the year that water is present in a location in the Everglades determines the type of soil, of which there only two in the Everglades: peat, created by many years of decomposing plant matter, and <a href="marl">marl</a>, the result of dried <a href="periphyton">periphyton</a>, or chunks of algae and microorganisms that create a grayish mud. Portions of the Everglades that remain flooded for more than nine months out of the year are usually covered by peat. Areas that are flooded six months or less are covered by marl. Plant communities are determined by the type of soil and amount of water present.

While they are common in the northern portion of <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, no underground <a href="spring%20%28hydrosphere%29">spring</a>s feed water into the Everglades system. An underground reservoir called the <a href="Floridan%20aquifer">Floridan aquifer</a> lies about below the surface of <a href="South%20Florida">South Florida</a>. The Everglades has an immense capacity for water storage, owing to the permeable limestone beneath the exposed land. Most of the water arrives in the form of rainfall, and a significant amount is stored in the limestone. Water evaporating from the Everglades becomes rain over metropolitan areas, providing the fresh water supply for the region. Water also flows into the park after falling as rain to the north onto the watersheds of the <a href="Kissimmee%20River">Kissimmee River</a> and other sources of Lake Okeechobee, to appear in the Everglades days later. Water overflows Lake Okeechobee into a river wide, which moves almost imperceptibly.

Most of the central region has a <a href="tropical%20savanna%20climate">savanna climate</a> while regions closer to shore have a <a href="tropical%20monsoon%20climate">monsoon climate</a>, mainly the eastern quarter of the park. Both climates are characterized by two seasons: wet and dry. The park's <a href="dry%20season">dry season</a> lasts from December to April, when temperatures vary from and humidity is low. Since water levels are low at that time, animals congregate at central water locations, providing good opportunities for viewing wildlife. During the <a href="wet%20season">wet season</a> from May to November, temperatures are consistently above and <a href="humidity">humidity</a> over 90 percent. Storms can drop of rain at a time, providing half the year's average of of rainfall in just two months.

At the turn of the 20th century common concepts of what should be protected in national parks invariably included formidable geologic features like mountains, geysers, or canyons. As Florida's population began to grow significantly and urban areas near the Everglades were developed, proponents of the park's establishment faced difficulty in persuading the federal government and the people of Florida that the subtle and constantly shifting ecosystems in the Everglades were just as worthy of protection. When the park was established in 1947, it became the first area within the U.S. to protect flora and fauna native to a region as opposed to geologic scenery. The National Park Service recognizes nine distinct interdependent ecosystems within the park that constantly shift in size owing to the amount of water present and other environmental factors.

Freshwater <a href="Slough%20%28hydrology%29">sloughs</a> are perhaps the most common ecosystem associated with Everglades National Park. These drainage channels are characterized by low-lying areas covered in fresh water, flowing at an almost imperceptible per day. <a href="Shark%20River%20%28Florida%29">Shark River Slough</a> and <a href="Taylor%20Slough">Taylor Slough</a> are significant features of the park. <a href="Cladium">Sawgrass</a> growing to a height of or more, and broad-leafed marsh plants, are so prominent in this region that they gave the Everglades its nickname , cemented in the public imagination in the title for <a href="Marjory%20Stoneman%20Douglas">Marjory Stoneman Douglas</a>'s book (1947), which culminated years of her advocacy for considering the Everglades ecosystem as more than a "swamp". Excellent feeding locations for birds, sloughs in the Everglades attract a great variety of waders such as <a href="heron">heron</a>s, <a href="egret">egret</a>s, <a href="roseate%20spoonbill">roseate spoonbill</a>s ("Platalea ajaja"), <a href="ibis">ibis</a>es and <a href="brown%20pelican">brown pelican</a>s ("Pelecanus occidentalis"), as well as <a href="limpkin">limpkin</a>s ("Aramus guarauna") and <a href="snail%20kite">snail kite</a>s that eat <a href="Ampullariidae">apple snails</a>, which in turn feed on the sawgrass. The sloughs' availability of fish, amphibians, and young birds attract a variety of freshwater turtles, <a href="American%20alligator">alligator</a> ("Alligator mississippiensis"), water moccasin ("<a href="Agkistrodon%20piscivorus%20conanti">Agkistrodon piscivorus conanti</a>"), and <a href="eastern%20diamondback%20rattlesnake">eastern diamondback rattlesnake</a> ("Crotalus adamanteus").
Freshwater <a href="marl%20prairie">marl prairie</a>s are similar to sloughs but lack the slow movement of surface water; instead, water seeps through a calcitic mud called <a href="marl">marl</a>. <a href="Algae">Algae</a> and other microscopic organisms form <a href="periphyton">periphyton</a>, which attaches to limestone. When it dries it turns into a gray mud. Sawgrass and other water plants grow shorter in freshwater marl than they do in <a href="peat">peat</a>, the other type of soil in the Everglades which is found where water remains present longer throughout the year. Marl prairies are usually under water from three to seven months of the year, whereas sloughs may remain submerged for longer than nine months and sometimes remain under water from one year to the next. Sawgrass may dominate sloughs, creating a <a href="monoculture">monoculture</a>. Other grasses, such as muhly grass ("<a href="Muhlenbergia%20filipes">Muhlenbergia filipes</a>") and broad-leafed water plants can be found in marl prairies. Animals living in the freshwater sloughs also inhabit marl prairies. Marl prairies may go dry in some parts of the year; alligators play a vital role in maintaining life in remote parts of the Everglades by burrowing in the mud during the dry season, creating pools of water where fish and amphibians survive from one year to the next. Alligator holes also attract other animals who congregate to feed on smaller prey. When the region floods again during the wet season, the fish and amphibians which were sustained in the alligator holes then repopulate freshwater marl prairies.

<a href="South%20Florida%20rocklands%23Rockland%20hammock">Hammocks</a> are often the only dry land within the park. They rise several inches above the grass-covered river and are dominated by diverse plant life consisting of subtropical and tropical trees, such as large southern live oaks ("<a href="Quercus%20virginiana">Quercus virginiana</a>"). Trees often form <a href="canopy%20%28forest%29">canopies</a> under which animals thrive amongst scrub bushes of wild coffee ("<a href="Psychotria">Psychotria</a>"), white indigoberry ("<a href="Randia%20aculeata">Randia aculeata</a>"), poisonwood ("<a href="Metopium%20toxiferum">Metopium toxiferum</a>") and saw palmetto ("<a href="Serenoa%20repens">Serenoa repens</a>"). The park features thousands of these tree islands amid sloughs—which often form the shape of a teardrop when seen from above (see park map) because of the slowly moving water around them—but they can also be found in pineland and mangroves. Trees in the Everglades, including wild tamarind ("<a href="Lysiloma%20latisiliquum">Lysiloma latisiliquum</a>") and gumbo-limbo ("<a href="Bursera%20simaruba">Bursera simaruba</a>"), rarely grow higher than because of wind, fire, and climate.
The plant growth around the hammock base is nearly impenetrable; beneath the canopy hammocks is an ideal habitat for animals. Reptiles (such as various species of snake and <a href="anole">anole</a>) and amphibians (such as the <a href="American%20green%20tree%20frog">American green tree frog</a>, "Hyla cinerea"), live in the hardwood hammocks. Birds such as <a href="barred%20owl">barred owl</a>s ("Strix varia"), <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a>s, <a href="northern%20cardinal">northern cardinal</a>s ("Cardinalis cardinalis"), and <a href="bald%20eagle">southern bald eagle</a>s ("Haliaeetus leucocephalus") nest in hammock trees. Mammal species living in hardwood hammocks include <a href="Florida%20black%20bear">black bear</a>s ("Ursus americanus floridanus"), <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>es ("Vulpes vulpes"), <a href="American%20mink">mink</a>s ("Neovison vison"), <a href="marsh%20rabbit">marsh rabbit</a>s ("Sylvilagus palustris"), <a href="gray%20fox">gray fox</a>es ("Urocyon cinereoargenteus"), <a href="white-tailed%20deer">white-tailed deer</a> ("Odocoileus virginianus"), and the rare, <a href="Critically%20endangered%20species">critically endangered</a> <a href="Florida%20panther">Florida panther</a> ("Puma con color corgi").

<a href="Miami-Dade%20County%2C%20Florida">Miami-Dade County</a> was once covered in of <a href="South%20Florida%20rocklands">pine rockland</a> forests, but most of it was harvested by the <a href="lumber">lumber</a> industry. <a href="South%20Florida%20rocklands%23Pine%20rockland">Pineland</a> ecosystems (or pine rocklands) are characterized by shallow, dry sandy <a href="loam">loam</a> over a limestone <a href="Stratum">substrate</a> covered almost exclusively by slash pines ("<a href="Pinus%20elliottii">Pinus elliottii</a> var. densa"). Trees in this ecosystem grow in <a href="sinkhole">solution holes</a>, where the soft limestone has worn away and filled with soil, allowing plants to take hold. Pinelands require regular maintenance by fire to ensure their existence. South Florida slash pines are uniquely adapted to promote fire by dropping a large amount of dried pine needles and shedding dry bark. Pine cones require heat from fires to open, allowing seeds to disperse and take hold. The trunks and roots of slash pines are resistant to fire. <a href="Prescribed%20burn">Prescribed burn</a>s in these areas take place every three to seven years; without regular fires, hardwood trees begin to grow in this region, and pinelands become recategorized as mixed swamp forests. Most plants in the area bloom about 16 weeks after a fire. Nearly all pinelands have an understory of palm shrubs and a diverse ground covering of wild herbs.

Pine rocklands are considered one of the most threatened habitats in Florida; less than of pineland exist outside the park. Within the park, of pineland are protected. A variety of animal species meet their needs for food, shelter, nesting, and rooking in pine rocklands. Woodpeckers, <a href="eastern%20meadowlark">eastern meadowlark</a>s ("Sturnella magna"), <a href="loggerhead%20shrike">loggerhead shrike</a>s ("Lanius ludovicianus"), <a href="grackle">grackle</a>s, and <a href="northern%20mockingbird">northern mockingbird</a>s ("Mimus polyglottos") are commonly found in pinelands. Black bears and Florida panthers also live in this habitat.

<a href="Taxodium">Cypress</a> trees are <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s that are adapted to live in standing fresh water. They grow in compact structures called cypress domes and in long strands over limestone. Water levels may fluctuate dramatically around cypress domes and strands, so cypresses develop "knees" that protrude from the water at high levels to provide oxygen for the root systems. Dwarf cypress trees grow in drier areas with poorer soil. <a href="Epiphyte">Epiphyte</a>s, such as <a href="Bromeliaceae">bromeliads</a>, Spanish moss ("<a href="Tillandsia%20usneoides">Tillandsia usneoides</a>"), <a href="Orchidaceae">orchids</a> and ferns grow on the branches and trunks of cypress trees. Everglades National Park features twenty-five species of orchids. Tall cypress trees provide excellent nesting areas for birds including <a href="wild%20turkey">wild turkey</a> ("Meleagris gallopavo"), ibis, herons, egrets, <a href="anhinga">anhinga</a>s ("Anhinga anhinga"), and <a href="belted%20kingfisher">belted kingfisher</a> ("Megaceryle alcyon"). Mammals in cypress regions include white-tailed deer, squirrels, <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s, <a href="Virginia%20opossum">opossum</a>s, skunks, swamp rabbits, <a href="North%20American%20river%20otter">river otters</a> ("Lontra canadensis"), and <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>s, as well as small rodents.

<a href="Mangrove">Mangrove</a> trees cover the coastlines of South Florida, sometimes growing inland depending on the amount of salt water present within the Everglades ecosystems. During drier years when less fresh water flows to the coast, mangroves will appear among fresh water plants. When rain is abundant, sawgrass and other fresh water plants may be found closer to the coast. Three species of mangrove trees—red ("<a href="Rhizophora%20mangle">Rhizophora mangle</a>"), black ("<a href="Avicennia%20germinans">Avicennia germinans</a>"), and white ("<a href="Laguncularia%20racemosa">Laguncularia racemosa</a>")—can be found in the Everglades. With a high tolerance of salt water, winds, extreme tides, high temperatures, and muddy soils, mangrove trees are uniquely adapted to extreme conditions. They act as nurseries for many marine and bird species. They are also Florida's first defense against the destructive forces of hurricanes, absorbing flood waters and preventing <a href="coastal%20erosion">coastal erosion</a>. The mangrove system in Everglades National Park is the largest continuous system of mangroves in the world.
Within the <a href="Florida%20mangroves">Florida mangrove</a> systems live 220 species of fish, and a variety of crabs, <a href="crayfish">crayfish</a>, shrimp, <a href="mollusk">mollusk</a>s, and other <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, which serve as the main source of food for many birds. Dozens of bird species use mangroves as nurseries and food stores, including <a href="pelican">pelican</a>s, <a href="grebe">grebe</a>s, <a href="tricolored%20heron">tricolored heron</a>s ("Egretta tricolor"), <a href="gull">gull</a>s, <a href="tern">tern</a>s, hawks and kites, and arboreal birds like <a href="mangrove%20cuckoo">mangrove cuckoo</a>s ("Coccyzus minor"), <a href="yellow%20warbler">yellow warbler</a>s ("Dendroica petechia"), and <a href="white-crowned%20pigeon">white-crowned pigeon</a>s ("Patagioenas leucocephala"). The mangroves also support 24 species of amphibians and reptiles, and 18 species of mammals, including the endangered <a href="green%20sea%20turtle">green turtle</a> ("Chelonia mydas"), <a href="hawksbill%20turtle">hawksbill turtle</a> ("Eretmochelys imbricata"), and <a href="West%20Indian%20manatee">West Indian manatee</a> ("Trichechus manatus").

Coastal lowlands, or wet prairies, are salt water marshes that absorb marine water when it gets high or fresh water when rains are heavy. Floods occur during hurricane and tropical <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a>s when ocean water can rise several feet over the land. Heavy wet seasons also cause floods when rain from the north flows into the Everglades. Few trees can survive in the conditions of this region, but plants—<a href="succulent">succulent</a>s like <a href="Batis%20%28plant%29">saltwort</a> and <a href="Salicornia">glasswort</a>—tolerate salt, brackish water, and desert conditions. Animal life in this zone is dependent upon the amount of water present, but commonly found animals include <a href="Cape%20Sable%20seaside%20sparrow">Cape Sable seaside sparrow</a> ("Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis"), <a href="snail%20kite">Everglades snail kite</a> ("Rostrhamus sociabilis"), <a href="wood%20stork">wood stork</a> ("Mycteria americana"), <a href="eastern%20indigo%20snake">eastern indigo snake</a> ("Drymarchon couperi"), and small mammals such as rats, mice, and rabbits.

The largest body of water within the park is <a href="Florida%20Bay">Florida Bay</a>, which extends from the mangrove swamps of the mainland's southern tip to the <a href="Florida%20Keys">Florida Keys</a>. Over of marine ecosystem lies in this range. <a href="Coral">Coral</a>, <a href="sponge">sponge</a>s, and <a href="seagrass">seagrass</a>es serve as shelter and food for <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s and <a href="Mollusca">mollusks</a>, which in turn are the primary food source for larger marine animals. Sharks, <a href="stingray">stingray</a>s, and <a href="barracuda">barracuda</a>s also live in this ecosystem. Pelicans, <a href="Wader">shorebirds</a>, terns, and <a href="black%20skimmer">black skimmer</a>s ("Rynchops niger") are among the birds frequenting park shorelines. The bay also has its own resident population of <a href="common%20bottlenose%20dolphin">bottlenose dolphin</a> ("Tursiops truncatus").

The bay's many basins are broken up by <a href="Shoal">sandbanks</a> that serve as plentiful <a href="recreational%20fishing">recreational fishing</a> grounds for <a href="Common%20snook">snook</a> ("Centropomus undecimalis"), <a href="Red%20drum">redfish</a> ("Sciaenops ocellatus"), <a href="Cynoscion%20nebulosus">spotted seatrout</a> ("Cynoscion nebulosus)", <a href="Atlantic%20tarpon">tarpon</a> ("Megaflops atlanticus)," <a href="bonefish">bonefish</a> ("Albula vulpes)", and <a href="Permit%20%28fish%29">permit</a> ("Trichinous falcatus)", as well as <a href="Northern%20red%20snapper">snapper</a> (Lutjanus campechanus), <a href="bluegill">bluegill</a> (Lepomis macrochirus), and <a href="Bass%20%28fish%29">bass</a>. Wading birds such as <a href="roseate%20spoonbill">roseate spoonbill</a>s ("Platalea ajaja"), <a href="reddish%20egret">reddish egret</a>s ("Egretta rufescens"), and <a href="Great%20blue%20heron">great white herons</a> ("Ardea herodias occidentalis") have unique subpopulations that are largely restricted to Florida Bay. Other bird species include <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a>s, <a href="cormorant">cormorant</a>s, and <a href="osprey">osprey</a>s. Mammals along the shoreline include <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s, <a href="opossum">opossum</a>s, <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>s, and <a href="fox%20squirrel">fox squirrel</a>s.

Humans likely first inhabited the South Florida region 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. Two tribes of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> developed on the peninsula's southern tip: the <a href="Tequesta">Tequesta</a> lived on the eastern side and the <a href="Calusa">Calusa</a>, greater in numbers, on the western side. The Everglades served as a natural boundary between them. The Tequesta lived in a single large community near the mouth of the <a href="Miami%20River%20%28Florida%29">Miami River</a>, while the Calusa lived in 30 villages. Both groups traveled through the Everglades but rarely lived within them, remaining mostly along the coast.

The diets of both groups consisted mostly of <a href="shellfish">shellfish</a> and fish, small mammals, game, and wild plants. Having access only to soft limestone, most of the tools fashioned by Native Americans in the region were made of shell, bone, wood, and animal teeth; shark teeth were used as cutting blades, and sharpened reeds became arrows and spears. <a href="Shell%20mound">Shell mound</a>s still exist today within the park, giving <a href="archaeologist">archaeologist</a>s and <a href="anthropologist">anthropologist</a>s evidence of the raw materials available to the indigenous people for tool construction. Spanish explorers estimated the number of Tequesta at first contact to be around 800, and Calusa at 2,000; the National Park Service reports there were probably about 20,000 natives living in or near the Everglades when the Spanish established contact in the late 16th century. The Calusa lived in <a href="Social%20hierarchy">social strata</a> and were able to create <a href="canal">canal</a>s, <a href="earthworks%20%28engineering%29">earthwork</a>s, and <a href="earthworks%20%28archaeology%29">shellwork</a>s. The Calusa were also able to resist Spanish attempts at conquest.

The Spanish had contact with these societies and established missions further north, near <a href="Lake%20Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a>. In the 18th century, invading <a href="Creek%20people">Creek</a>s incorporated the dwindling numbers of the Tequesta into their own. Neither the Tequesta nor Calusa tribe existed by 1800. Disease, warfare, and capture for slavery were the reasons for the eradication of both groups. The only evidence of their existence within the park boundaries is a series of shell mounds that were built by the Calusa.

In the early 19th century, <a href="Muscogee">Creeks</a>, escaped African slaves, and other Indians from northern Florida displaced by the <a href="Creek%20War">Creek War</a>, formed the area's <a href="Seminole">Seminole</a> nation. After the end of the <a href="Seminole%20Wars">Seminole Wars</a> in 1842, the Seminoles faced relocation to <a href="Indian%20territory">Indian territory</a> near <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>. A few hundred Seminole hunters and scouts settled within what is today <a href="Big%20Cypress%20National%20Preserve">Big Cypress National Preserve</a>, to escape the forced emigration to the west. From 1859 to about 1930, the Seminoles and <a href="Miccosukee">Miccosukee</a>, a similar but linguistically unique tribe, lived in relative isolation, making their living by trading. In 1928, surveying and construction began on the <a href="Tamiami%20Trail">Tamiami Trail</a>, along the northern border of Everglades National Park. The road bisected the Everglades, introducing a steady, if small, traffic of white settlers into the Everglades.

Some members of the Miccosukee and Seminole tribes continue to live within park boundaries. Management of the park includes approval of new policies and procedures by tribal representatives "in such a manner that they do not conflict with the park purpose".

Following the end of the <a href="Seminole%20Wars">Seminole Wars</a>, Americans began settling at isolated points along the coast in what is now the park, from the <a href="Ten%20Thousand%20Islands">Ten Thousand Islands</a> to <a href="Cape%20Sable">Cape Sable</a>. Communities developed on the two largest pieces of dry ground in the area, on <a href="Chokoloskee%2C%20Florida">Chokoloskee Island</a> and at <a href="Flamingo%2C%20Florida">Flamingo</a> on Cape Sable, both of which established post offices in the early 1890s. Chokoloskee Island is a shell mound, a <a href="midden">midden</a> built roughly 20 feet (6 m) high over thousands of years of occupation by the Calusa. The settlements in Chokoloskee and Flamingo served as trading centers for small populations of farmers, fishermen, and charcoal burners settled in the Ten Thousand Islands. Both settlements and the more isolated homesteads could only be reached by boat until well into the 20th century. <a href="Everglades%20City%2C%20Florida">Everglades City</a>, on the mainland near Chokoloskee, enjoyed a brief period of prosperity when, beginning in 1920, it served as the headquarters for construction of the <a href="Tamiami%20Trail">Tamiami Trail</a>. A dirt road from <a href="Florida%20City%2C%20Florida">Florida City</a> reached Flamingo in 1922, while a <a href="causeway">causeway</a> finally connected Chokoloskee to the mainland's Everglades City in 1956. After the park was established, private property in the Flamingo area was claimed by <a href="eminent%20domain">eminent domain</a>, and the site was incorporated into the park as a visitor center.

Several attempts were made to drain and develop the Everglades in the 1880s. The first canals built in the Everglades did little harm to the ecosystem, as they were unable to drain much of it. <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte%20Broward">Napoleon Bonaparte Broward</a> based the majority of his 1904 campaign for governor on how drainage would create "The Empire of the Everglades". Broward ordered the drainage that took place between 1905 and 1910, and it was successful enough that land developers sold tracts for $30 per acre, settling the town of <a href="Davie%2C%20Florida">Davie</a>, and developing regions in <a href="Lee%20County%2C%20Florida">Lee</a> and Dade counties. The canals also cleared water that made way for agricultural fields growing <a href="sugarcane">sugarcane</a>.

In the 1920s, a population boom in South Florida created the <a href="Florida%20land%20boom%20of%20the%201920s">Florida land boom</a>, which was described by author Michael Grunwald as "insanity". Land was sold before any homes or structures were built on it and in some cases before any plans for construction were in place. New landowners, eager to make good on their investments, hastily constructed homes and small towns on recently drained land. Mangrove trees on the coasts were taken down for better views and replaced with shallow-rooted palm trees. The <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> began construction on larger canals to control the rising waters in the Everglades. Nevertheless, Lake Okeechobee continued to rise and fall, the region was covered with rain, and city planners continued to battle the water. The <a href="1926%20Miami%20Hurricane">1926 Miami Hurricane</a> caused Lake Okeechobee <a href="levee">levee</a>s to fail; hundreds of people south of the lake drowned. Two years later, the <a href="1928%20Okeechobee%20Hurricane">1928 Okeechobee Hurricane</a> claimed 2,500 lives when Lake Okeechobee once again surged over its levees. Politicians who declared the Everglades uninhabitable were silenced when a four-story wall, the <a href="Herbert%20Hoover%20Dike">Herbert Hoover Dike</a>, was built around Lake Okeechobee. This wall effectively cut off the water source from the Everglades.

Following the wall's construction, South Florida endured a drought severe enough to cause serious wildfires in 1939. The influx of humans had a detrimental effect on the plants and animals of the region when melaleuca trees ("<a href="Melaleuca%20quinquenervia">Melaleuca quinquenervia</a>") were introduced to help with drainage, along with <a href="Casuarinaceae">Australian pine</a>s brought in by developers as <a href="windbreak">windbreak</a>s. The region's timber was devastated for lumber supplies. Alligators, birds, frogs, and fish were hunted on a large scale. Entire rookeries of wading birds were shot to collect their plumes, which were used in women's hats in the early 20th century. The largest impact people had on the region was the diversion of water away from the Everglades. Canals were deepened and widened, and water levels fell dramatically, causing chaos in <a href="food%20web">food web</a>s. Salt water replaced fresh water in the canals, and by 1997 scientists noticed that salt water was seeping into the Biscayne Aquifer, South Florida's water source.

In the 1940s, <a href="Marjory%20Stoneman%20Douglas">Marjory Stoneman Douglas</a>, a freelance writer and former reporter for "<a href="The%20Miami%20Herald">The Miami Herald</a>", began to research the Everglades for an assignment about the <a href="Miami%20River%20%28Florida%29">Miami River</a>. She studied the land and water for five years and published "" in 1947, describing the area in great detail, including a chapter on its disappearance. She wrote: "What had been a river of grass and sweet water that had given meaning and life and uniqueness to this enormous geography through centuries in which man had no place here was made, in one chaotic gesture of greed and ignorance and folly, a river of fire." The book has sold 500,000 copies since its publication, and Douglas' continued dedication to ecology conservation earned her the nicknames "Grand Dame of the Everglades", "Grandmother of the Everglades" and "the anti-Christ" for her singular focus at the expense of some political interests. She founded and served as president for an organization called Friends of the Everglades, initially intended to protest the construction of a proposed Big Cypress jetport in 1968. Successful in that confrontation, the organization has grown to over 4,000 members, committed to the preservation of the Everglades. She wrote and spoke about the importance of the Everglades until her death at age 108 in 1998.

Floridians hoping to preserve at least part of the Everglades began to express their concern over diminishing resources in the early 20th century. Royal Palm State Park was created in 1916; it included several trails and a visitor's center several miles from <a href="Homestead%2C%20Florida">Homestead</a>. Miami-based naturalists first proposed that the area become a national park in 1923. Five years later, the Florida state legislature established the Tropical Everglades National Park Commission to study the formation of a protected area. The commission was led by <a href="Ernest%20F.%20Coe">Ernest F. Coe</a>, a land developer turned conservationist, who was eventually nicknamed Father of Everglades National Park. Coe's original plan for the park included more than including <a href="Key%20Largo%2C%20Florida">Key Largo</a> and <a href="Big%20Cypress%20National%20Preserve">Big Cypress</a>, and his unwillingness to compromise almost prevented the park's creation. Various other interests, including land developers and sport hunters, demanded that the size of the park be decreased.

The commission was also tasked with proposing a method to raise the money to purchase the land. The search coincided with the arrival of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> in the United States, and money for land purchase was scarce. The <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> authorized the creation of the new national park on May 30, 1934, but it passed only with a rider that ensured no money would be allotted to the project for at least five years. Coe's passion and <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senator</a> <a href="Spessard%20Holland">Spessard Holland</a>'s politicking helped to fully establish the park, after Holland was able to negotiate of the park, leaving out Big Cypress, Key Largo, the <a href="Turner%20River%20Site">Turner River area</a>, and a tract of land called "The Hole in the Donut" that was too highly valued for agriculture. "Miami Herald" editor John Pennekamp was instrumental in pushing the Florida Legislature to raise $2 million to purchase the private land inside the park boundaries. It was dedicated by President <a href="Harry%20Truman">Harry Truman</a> on December 6, 1947, one month after Marjory Stoneman Douglas' book; "The Everglades: River of Grass" was released. In the same year, several tropical storms struck South Florida, prompting the construction of of canals, sending water unwanted by farmers and residents to the ocean.

The <a href="Central%20and%20Southern%20Florida%20Flood%20Control%20Project">Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project</a> (C&SF) was authorized by Congress to construct more than one thousand miles of canals and flood control structures across South Florida. The C&SF, run by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, established an agricultural area directly south of Lake Okeechobee, and three water conservation areas, all bordered by canals that diverted excess water either to urban areas or into the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico or Florida Bay. South of these manmade regions was Everglades National Park, which had been effectively cut off from its water supply. By the 1960s, the park was visibly suffering. The C&SF was directed to provide enough water to sustain the park; it did not follow through. A proposed airport that would have <a href="Environmental%20Impact%20of%20the%20Big%20Cypress%20Swamp%20Jetport">dire environment effects</a> on Everglades National Park became the center of a battle that helped to initiate the environmental movement into local and national politics. The airport proposal was eventually abandoned, and in 1972 a bill was introduced to curb development in South Florida and ensure the national park would receive the amount of water it needed. Efforts turned to repairing the damage wrought by decades of mismanagement: the Army Corps of Engineers changed its focus in 1990 from constructing dams and canals to constructing "purely environmental projects".

Regions originally included in Ernest Coe's vision for a national park were slowly added over the years to the park or incorporated into other protected areas: <a href="Biscayne%20National%20Park">Biscayne National Park</a>, <a href="Big%20Cypress%20National%20Preserve">Big Cypress National Preserve</a>, <a href="John%20Pennekamp%20Coral%20Reef%20State%20Park">John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park</a> on Key Largo, <a href="Ten%20Thousand%20Islands">Ten Thousand Islands</a> National Wildlife Refuge, and <a href="Florida%20Keys%20National%20Marine%20Sanctuary">Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary</a> were all protected after the park's opening in 1947. Everglades National Park was designated an <a href="International%20Biosphere%20Reserve">International Biosphere Reserve</a> on October 26, 1976. On November 10, 1978, most of the park was declared a <a href="National%20Wilderness%20Preservation%20System">wilderness area</a>. Wilderness designations covered in 2015—about 86 percent of the park. It was listed as a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> on October 24, 1979, and as a <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Wetland of International Importance</a> on June 4, 1987. It was placed on the <a href="List%20of%20World%20Heritage%20in%20Danger">List of World Heritage in Danger</a> from 1993 until 2007 and then again in 2010.

President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> signed the Everglades National Park Protection and Expansion Act on December 13, 1989, that added to the eastern side of the park, closed the park to <a href="airboat">airboat</a>s, directed the Department of the Army to restore water to improve the ecosystems within Everglades National Park, and "Direct(ed) the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Secretary of the Interior</a> to manage the Park in order to maintain the natural abundance, diversity, and ecological integrity of native plants and animals, as well as the behavior of native animals, as part of their ecosystem." Bush remarked in his statement when signing the act, "Through this legislation that river of grass may now be restored to its natural flow of water".

In 2000, <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> approved the <a href="Comprehensive%20Everglades%20Restoration%20Plan">Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan</a> (CERP), a federal effort to restore the Everglades with the objectives of "restoration, preservation and protection of the south Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region", and claiming to be the largest environmental restoration in history. It was a controversial plan; detractors worried that it "relies on uncertain technologies, overlooks water quality, subsidizes damaging growth and delays its environmental benefits". Supporters of the plan included the <a href="National%20Audubon%20Society">National Audubon Society</a>, who were accused by Friends of the Everglades and the Biodiversity Legal Foundation of prioritizing agricultural and business interests.
CERP projects are designed to capture of fresh water every day, store it in underground reservoirs, and release the water to areas within 16 counties in South Florida. Approximately of man-made wetlands are to be constructed to confine contaminated water before it is released to the Everglades, and of canals that divert water away from the Everglades are to be destroyed. During the first five years of implementation, CERP was responsible for the purchase of of land at a cost of $1 billion. The plan aims to spend $10.5 billion over 30 years, combining 50 different projects and giving them 5-year timelines. 

Everglades National Park was directly hit by Hurricanes <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Katrina</a>, <a href="Hurricane%20Wilma">Wilma</a>, and <a href="Hurricane%20Rita">Rita</a> in 2005. Such storms are a natural part of the park's ecosystem; 1960's <a href="Hurricane%20Donna">Hurricane Donna</a> left nothing in the mangroves but "standing dead snags" several miles wide, but 30 years later the area had completely recovered. Predictably, what suffered the most in the park from the 2005 hurricanes were man-made structures. In 2009 the visitors' center and lodge at Flamingo were irreparably damaged by winds and an <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a>; the lodge had been functioning for 50 years when it was torn down: nothing is slated to replace it.

Everglades National Park reported in 2005 a budget of over $28 million. Of that, $14.8 million is granted from the National Park Service, and $13.5 million from various sources including CERP, donations, and other grants. The entry fee for vehicles in 2006 ranged from $10 to $200 for bus tours. Of the nearly one million visitors to Everglades National Park in 2006, more than 38,000 were overnight campers, paying $16 a night or $10 a night for backcountry permits. Visitors spent $2.6 million within the park and $48 million in local economies. More than 900 jobs were sustained or created within or by the park, and the park added value of $35 million to local economies.

The busiest season for visitors is from December to March, when temperatures are lowest and mosquitoes are least active. The park features four visitor centers: on the Tamiami Trail (part of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20in%20Florida">U.S. Route 41</a>) directly west of Miami is the Shark Valley Visitor Center. A fifteen-mile (24 km) round trip path leads from this center to a two-story observation tower. Tram tours are available during the busy season. Closest to <a href="Homestead%2C%20Florida">Homestead</a> on State Road 9336 is the Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center, where a road begins, winding through pine rockland, cypress, freshwater marl prairie, coastal prairie, and mangrove ecosystems. Various hiking trails are accessible from the road, which runs to the Flamingo Visitor Center and marina, open and staffed during the busier time of the year. The Gulf Coast Visitor Center is closest to <a href="Everglades%20City%2C%20Florida">Everglades City</a> on <a href="Florida%20State%20Road%2029">State Road 29</a> along the west coast. The Gulf Coast Visitor Center gives canoers access to the <a href="The%20Everglades%20Wilderness%20Waterway">Wilderness Waterway</a>, a 99-mile (160 km) canoe trail that extends to the Flamingo Visitor Center. The western coast of the park and the <a href="Ten%20Thousand%20Islands">Ten Thousand Islands</a> and the various key islands in Florida Bay are accessible only by boat.

Several walking trails in the park vary in hiking difficulty on Pine Island, where visitors can cross hardwood hammocks, pinelands, and freshwater sloughs. Starting at the Royal Palm Visitor Center, the Anhinga Trail is a half-mile self-guided tour through a sawgrass marsh where visitors can see alligators, marsh and wading birds, turtles, and bromeliads. Its proximity to Homestead and its accessibility make it one of the most visited sites in the park. The nearby Gumbo Limbo Trail is also self-guided, at half-mile long. It loops through a canopy of hardwood hammocks that include gumbo limbo, royal palms ("<a href="Roystonea">Roystonea</a>"), strangler figs ("<a href="Ficus%20aurea">Ficus aurea</a>"), and a variety of epiphytes.

Twenty eight miles (45 km) of trails start near the Long Pine Key campgrounds and wind through Long Pine Key, well-suited for <a href="offroad%20cycling">offroad cycling</a> through the pine rocklands in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area. Two boardwalks allow visitors to walk through a cypress forest at Pa-Hay-O-Kee, which also features a two-story overlook, and another at Mahogany Hammock (referring to "<a href="Swietenia%20mahagoni">Swietenia mahagoni</a>") that takes hikers through a dense forest in the middle of a freshwater marl prairie. Closer to Flamingo, more rugged trails take visitors through mangrove swamps, along Florida Bay. Christian Point Trail, Snake <a href="bight%20%28geography%29">Bight</a> Trail, Rowdy Bend Trail and Coastal Prairie Trail allow viewing of shorebirds and wading birds among the mangroves. Portions of the trails may be impassable depending on the time of year, because of mosquitoes and water levels. Ranger-led tours take place in the busier season only.

Camping is available year-round in Everglades National Park. Camping with some services is available at Long Pine Key, close to the Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center, where 108 sites are accessible by car. Near Flamingo, 234 campsites with some services are also available. <a href="Recreational%20vehicle">Recreational vehicle</a> camping is available at these sites, but not with all necessary services. Back-country permits are required for campsites along the Wilderness Waterway, Gulf Coast sites, and sites in the various keys. Several back-country sites are <a href="chickee">chickee</a>s; others are beach and ground sites.

Low-powered motorboats are allowed in the park; the majority of salt water areas are <a href="wake">no-wake zone</a>s to protect manatees and other marine animals from harm. <a href="Jet%20ski">Jet ski</a>s, airboats, and other motorized personal watercraft are prohibited. Many trails allow kayaks and canoes. A state license is required for fishing. Fresh water licenses are not sold in the park, but a salt water license may be available. Swimming is not recommended within the park boundaries; water moccasins, snapping turtles ("<a href="Chelydra%20serpentina">Chelydra serpentina</a>"), alligators, and crocodiles thrive in fresh water. Sharks, barracuda, and sharp dangerous coral are plentiful in salt water. Visibility is low in both salt water and fresh water areas.

Everglades National Park is an important part of the <a href="Great%20Florida%20Birding%20Trail">Great Florida Birding Trail</a>. It has great biodiversity and many species of birds for bird watching and bird photography also.

Portions of Everglades National Park are ideal for dark sky observations in South Florida. The best viewing locations are in the remote southern and western areas of the Everglades, such as <a href="Flamingo%2C%20Monroe%20County%2C%20Florida">Flamingo</a> and the <a href="Ten%20Thousand%20Islands">Ten Thousand Islands</a>. The Milky Way appears brightest when looking south, toward the least light-polluted areas.

Less than 50 percent of the Everglades which existed prior to drainage attempts remains intact today. Populations of wading birds dwindled 90 percent from their original numbers between the 1940s and 2000s. The diversion of water to South Florida's still-growing metropolitan areas is the Everglades National Park's number one threat. In the 1950s and 1960s, of canals and levees, 150 gates and spillways, and 16 pumping stations were constructed to direct water toward cities and away from the Everglades. Low levels of water leave fish vulnerable to reptiles and birds, and as sawgrass dries it can burn or die off, which in turn kills apple snails and other animals that wading birds feed upon. Populations of birds fluctuate; in 2009, the South Florida Water Management District claimed wading birds across South Florida increased by 335 percent. Following three years of increasing numbers, "The Miami Herald" reported in 2009 that populations of wading birds within the park decreased by 29 percent.

Cities along the west coast of Florida rely on <a href="desalinization">desalinization</a> for fresh water; the quantity demanded is too great for the land to provide. <a href="Nitrate">Nitrate</a>s in the underground water system and high levels of <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> also impact the quality of fresh water the park receives. In 1998, a Florida panther was found dead in Shark Water Slough, with levels of mercury high enough to kill a human. Increased occurrences of <a href="algal%20bloom">algal bloom</a>s and <a href="red%20tide">red tide</a> in <a href="Biscayne%20Bay">Biscayne Bay</a> and Florida Bay have been traced to the amounts of controlled water released from Lake Okeechobee. The brochure given to visitors at Everglades National Park includes a statement that reads, "Freshwater flowing into the park is engineered. With the help of pumps, floodgates, and retention ponds along the park's boundary, the Everglades is presently on life support, alive but diminished."

A series of levees on the park's eastern border marks the line between urban and protected areas, but development into these areas threatens the park system. Florida still attracts nearly a thousand new residents every day, and building residential, commercial and industrial zones near Everglades National Park stresses the water balance and ecosystems within the park. On the park's western border, <a href="Fort%20Myers">Fort Myers</a>, <a href="Naples%2C%20Florida">Naples</a> and <a href="Cape%20Coral">Cape Coral</a> are expanding, but no system of levees exists to mark that border. "<a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic</a>" rated both Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve the lowest-scoring parks in North America, at 32 out of 100. Their scoring system rated 55 parks in terms of <a href="sustainable%20tourism">sustainable tourism</a>, destination quality, and park management. The experts who compiled the results justified the score by stating: "Encroachment by housing and retail development has thrown the precious ecosystem into a tailspin, and if humankind doesn't back off, there will be nothing left of one of this country's most amazing treasures".

Thirty-six federally protected animals live in the park, some of which face grave threats to their survival.

In the United States, the <a href="American%20crocodile">American crocodile</a>'s only habitat is within South Florida. They were once overhunted for their hides. They are protected today from hunting but are still threatened by habitat destruction and injury from vehicle collisions when crossing roads to reach waterways. About 2,000 crocodiles live in Florida, and there are roughly 100 nests in the Everglades and <a href="Biscayne%20National%20Park">Biscayne National Park</a>s. Crocodiles populations in South Florida have increased as has the number of alligators. Crocodiles were reclassified from "endangered" to "threatened" in the United States in 2007.

The <a href="Florida%20panther">Florida panther</a> is one of the most endangered mammals on earth. About 230 live in the wild, primarily in the Everglades and the Big Cypress Swamp. The biggest threats to the panther include habitat destruction from human development, vehicle collisions, <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a> due to their limited gene pool, parasites, diseases, and <a href="mercury%20poisoning">mercury poisoning</a>.

Four Everglade species of sea turtle including the Atlantic green sea turtle, the Atlantic <a href="Hawksbill%20sea%20turtle">hawksbill</a>, the Atlantic loggerhead ("<a href="Caretta%20caretta">Caretta caretta</a>"), and the Atlantic ridley ("<a href="Lepidochelys%20kempii">Lepidochelys kempii</a>") are endangered. Also, the leatherback sea turtle ("<a href="Dermochelys%20coriacea">Dermochelys coriacea</a>") is threatened. Numbers are difficult to determine, since males and juveniles do not return to their birthplace; females lay eggs in the same location every year. Habitat loss, illegal <a href="poaching">poaching</a>, and destructive fishing practices are the biggest threats to these animals.

The range of the <a href="Cape%20Sable%20seaside%20sparrow">Cape Sable seaside sparrow</a> is restricted to Everglades National Park and the Big Cypress Swamp. In 1981 6,656 Cape Sable seaside sparrows were reported in park boundaries, but surveys over 10 years documented a decline to an estimated 2,624 birds by 2002. Attempts to return natural levels of water to the park have been controversial; Cape Sable seaside sparrows nest about a foot off the ground, and rising water levels may harm future populations, as well as threaten the locally endangered <a href="snail%20kite">snail kite</a>. The Everglades snail kite eats <a href="apple%20snail">apple snail</a>s almost exclusively, and the Everglades is the only location in the United States where this <a href="bird%20of%20prey">bird of prey</a> exists. There is some evidence that the population may be increasing, but loss of habitat and food sources keep the estimated number of these birds at several hundred.

The <a href="West%20Indian%20manatee">West Indian manatee</a> has been upgraded from endangered to threatened. Collisions with boats and habitat loss are still its biggest threats.

Fire naturally occurs after lightning storms but takes its heaviest toll when water levels are low. Hardwood hammock and cypress trees are susceptible to heavy damage from fire, and some may take decades to grow back. <a href="Peat">Peat</a> built up over centuries in the marsh can cause fires to burn deep scars in the soil. In 2007, Fred Sklar of the <a href="South%20Florida%20Water%20Management%20District">South Florida Water Management District</a> said: "An extreme drought can be viewed (as) almost as catastrophic as a volcano. It can reshape the entire landscape. It can take 1,000 years to produce two inches of peat, and you can lose those couple of inches in a week."

Rising sea levels caused by <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a> are another threat to the future of the park. Since 1932, ocean levels at <a href="Key%20West">Key West</a> have steadily risen over , which could have disastrous consequences for land so close to the ocean. It is estimated that within 500 years freshwater habitats in the Everglades National Park will be obliterated by salt water, leaving only the northernmost portion of the Everglades. Cost estimates for raising or replacing the Tamiami Trail and <a href="Alligator%20Alley">Alligator Alley</a> with bridges are in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

The introduction of non-native species into South Florida is a considerable problem for the park. Many of the biological controls such as weather, disease, and consumers who naturally limit plants in their native environments do not exist in the Everglades, causing many to grow larger and multiply far beyond their average numbers in their native habitats. Approximately 26 percent of all fish, reptiles, birds, and mammal species in South Florida are exotic—more than in any other part of the U.S.—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world.

Species that adapt the most aggressively to conditions in the Everglades, by spreading quickly or competing with native species that sometimes are threatened or endangered, are called "invasive". Thousands of exotic plant species have been observed in South Florida, usually introduced as ornamental landscaping, but park staff must eradicate such invasive plants as melaleuca tree ("<a href="Melaleuca%20quinquenervia">Melaleuca quinquenervia</a>"), Brazilian pepper ("<a href="Schinus%20terebinthifolius">Schinus terebinthifolius</a>"), and Old World climbing fern ("<a href="Lygodium%20microphyllum">Lygodium microphyllum</a>"). Similarly, animals often do not find the predators or natural barriers to reproduction in the Everglades as they do where they originate, thus they often reproduce more quickly and efficiently. Lobate lac scale insects ("<a href="Paratachardina%20pseudolobata">Paratachardina pseudolobata</a>") kill shrubs and other plants in hardwood hammocks. Bromeliad beetles ("<a href="Metamasius%20callizona">Metamasius callizona</a>") destroy bromeliads and the ecosystems they host.

Walking catfish ("<a href="Clarias%20batrachus">Clarias batrachus</a>") can deplete aquaculture stocks and they carry enteric septicemia. The <a href="Florida%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Conservation%20Commission">Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission</a> (FWC) listed eight "Reptiles of Concern", including the Burmese python ("<a href="Python%20molurus%20bivittatus">Python molurus bivittatus</a>"), focusing on them for their large sizes and aggressive natures, allowing licensed hunters to kill any listed animals in protected areas and sell their meat and hides. <a href="Burmese%20python">Burmese python</a>s, two subspecies of African rock pythons ("<a href="Python%20sebae">Python sebae</a>"; northern and southern), and yellow anacondas ("<a href="Eunectes%20notaeus">Eunectes notaeus</a>") were banned from import into the U.S. in 2012. <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">United States Secretary of the Interior</a> <a href="Ken%20Salazar">Ken Salazar</a> announced the inclusion of these reptiles at Everglades National Park. Exotic species control falls under the management of the <a href="U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a>, which has been compiling and disseminating information about invasive species since 1994. Control of invasive species costs $500 million per year, but of land in South Florida remains infested.

Norma (constellation)

Norma is a small constellation in the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Southern Celestial Hemisphere</a> between <a href="Ara%20%28constellation%29">Ara</a> and <a href="Lupus%20%28constellation%29">Lupus</a>, one of twelve drawn up in the 18th century by <a href="France">French</a> <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a> <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a> and one of several depicting scientific instruments. Its name is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for <a href="T-square">normal</a>, referring to a <a href="surface%20normal">right angle</a>, and is variously considered to represent a <a href="Ruler">rule</a>, a <a href="carpenter%27s%20square">carpenter's square</a>, a <a href="set%20square">set square</a> or a <a href="spirit%20level">level</a>. It remains one of the <a href="88%20modern%20constellations">88 modern constellations</a>.

Four of Norma's brighter stars—Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Eta—make up a square in the field of faint stars. <a href="Gamma2%20Normae">Gamma Normae</a> is the brightest star with an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of 4.0. <a href="Mu%20Normae">Mu Normae</a> is one of the most <a href="luminosity">luminous</a> stars known, with a luminosity between a quarter million and one million times that of the Sun. Four star systems are known to harbour planets. The <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> passes through Norma, and the constellation contains eight <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a>s visible to observers with binoculars. The constellation also hosts Abell 3627, also called the <a href="Norma%20Cluster">Norma Cluster</a>, one of the most massive <a href="galaxy%20cluster">galaxy cluster</a>s known.

Norma was introduced in 1751–52 by <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a> with the French name "l’Équerre et la Règle", "the Square and Rule", after he had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a>. He devised 14 new constellations in uncharted regions of the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Southern Celestial Hemisphere</a> not visible from Europe. All but one honoured instruments that symbolised the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>. Lacaille portrayed the constellations of Norma, <a href="Circinus">Circinus</a> and <a href="Triangulum%20Australe">Triangulum Australe</a>, respectively, as a set square and ruler, a compass, and a surveyor's level in a set of draughtsman instruments, in his 1756 map of the southern stars. The level was dangling from the apex of a triangle, leading some astronomers to conclude he was renaming "l’Équerre et la Règle" to "le Niveau", "the level". In any case, the constellation's name had been shortened and Latinised by Lacaille to "Norma" by 1763.

Norma is bordered by <a href="Scorpius">Scorpius</a> to the north, <a href="Lupus%20%28constellation%29">Lupus</a> to the northwest, Circinus to the west, Triangulum Australe to the south and Ara to the east. Covering 165.3 square degrees and 0.401% of the night sky, it ranks 74th of the 88 constellations in size. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is 'Nor'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of ten segments. In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between −42.27° and −60.44°. The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude <a href="29th%20parallel%20north">29°N</a>.

Lacaille charted and designated ten stars with the <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s Alpha through to Mu in 1756, however his Alpha Normae was transferred into Scorpius and left unnamed by <a href="Francis%20Baily">Francis Baily</a>, before being named <a href="N%20Scorpii">N Scorpii</a> by <a href="Benjamin%20Apthorp%20Gould">Benjamin Apthorp Gould</a>, who felt its brightness warranted recognition. Though Beta Normae was depicted on his star chart, it was inadvertently left out of Lacaille's 1763 catalogue, was likewise transferred to Scorpio by Baily and named <a href="H%20Scorpii">H Scorpii</a> by Gould. Norma's brightest star, <a href="Gamma2%20Normae">Gamma Normae</a>, is only of <a href="apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a> 4.0. Overall, there are 44 stars within the constellation's borders brighter than or equal to <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 6.5.
The four main stars—Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Eta—make up a square in this region of faint stars. <a href="Gamma1%20Normae">Gamma</a> and Gamma Normae are an <a href="Double%20star">optical double</a>, and not a true <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> system. Located 129 ± 1 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s away from Earth, Gamma Normae is a yellow giant of <a href="Stellar%20classification">spectral type</a> G8III around 2 to 2.5 <a href="solar%20mass">times as massive</a> as the Sun. It has swollen to a diameter 10 times that of the Sun and shines with 45 times the Sun's luminosity. It also is half of a close optical double, with a magnitude 10 companion star related by line of sight only. Gamma Normae is a yellow-white supergiant, located much further away at around 1500 light-years from Earth. <a href="Epsilon%20Normae">Epsilon Normae</a> is a <a href="Binary%20star%23Spectroscopic%20binaries">spectroscopic binary</a>, with two <a href="B-type%20main%20sequence%20star">blue-white main sequence stars</a> of almost equal mass and spectral type (B3V) orbiting each other every 3.26 days. There is a third star separated by 22 arcseconds, which has a magnitude of 7.5 and is likely a smaller B-type main sequence star of spectral type B9V. The system is 530 ± 20 light-years distant from Earth, <a href="Eta%20Normae">Eta Normae</a> is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III with an apparent magnitude of 4.65. It shines with a <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> approximately 66 times that of the Sun.

<a href="Iota1%20Normae">Iota Normae</a> is a multiple star system. The AB (mag 5.2 and 5.76) pair orbit each other with a period of 26.9 years; they are 2.77 and 2.71 times as massive as the Sun respectively. The pair are 128 ± 6 light-years distant from Earth. A third component is a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G8V with an apparent magnitude of 8.02.

<a href="Mu%20Normae">Mu Normae</a> is a remote blue supergiant of spectral type O9.7Iab, one of the most luminous stars known, but is partially obscured by distance and <a href="cosmic%20dust">cosmic dust</a>. Uncertainties regarding its distance leave open the possibility that Mu Normae could be between 250,000 and one million times as luminous and up to 60 times as massive as the Sun, though it is more likely to have around 500,000 times the Sun's luminosity and 40 times its mass. It is suspected of being an <a href="Alpha%20Cygni%20variable">Alpha Cygni variable</a>, with a magnitude range of 4.87–4.98. <a href="QU%20Normae">QU Normae</a> is another hot blue-white star that is a variable, ranging from magnitude 5.27 to 5.41 over 4.8 days. Lying near <a href="Eta%20Normae">Eta Normae</a> is <a href="R%20Normae">R Normae</a>, a <a href="Mira%20variable">Mira variable</a>. Its visual magnitude range is 6.5–13.9 and its average period is 507.5 days. Located halfway between Eta Normae and <a href="Gamma%20Circini">Gamma Circini</a> is <a href="T%20Normae">T Normae</a>, another Mira variable. It ranges from magnitude 6.2 to 13.6, with a period of 244 days. <a href="S%20Normae">S Normae</a> is a well-known <a href="Cepheid%20variable">Cepheid variable</a> with a magnitude range of 6.12–6.77 and a period of 9.75411 days. It is located at the centre of the <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> <a href="New%20General%20Catalogue">NGC</a> 6087. It is a yellow-white supergiant of spectral type F8-G0Ib that is 6.3 times as massive as the Sun. A binary, it has a 2.4 <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a> () companion that is a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V. A binary system composed of two wolf-rayet stars, colloquially called <a href="2XMM%20J160050.7%E2%80%93514245">Apep</a>, has been identified as a possible progenitor of a long gamma-ray burst. Located around 8000 light-years distant, it would be the first such in the Milky Way.

<a href="IM%20Normae">IM Normae</a> is one of only ten <a href="recurrent%20nova">recurrent nova</a>e known in the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. It has erupted in 1920 and 2002, reaching magnitude 8.5 from a baseline of 18.3. It was poorly monitored after the first eruption, so it is possible that it erupted in between. Norma hosts two faint <a href="R%20Coronae%20Borealis%20variable">R Coronae Borealis variable</a> stars of magnitude 10—<a href="RT%20Normae">RT Normae</a> and <a href="RZ%20Normae">RZ Normae</a>—rare degenerate stars thought to have formed from the merger of two <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a>s that fade by several magnitudes periodically as they eject large amounts of carbon dust. A faint object of magnitude 16, <a href="QV%20Normae">QV Normae</a> is a high mass <a href="X-ray%20binary">X-ray binary</a> star system 15,000–20,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is composed of a <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a> orbiting a blue-white supergiant approximately 20 times as massive as the Sun. The <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a> from the more massive star is drawn to the magnetic poles of the neutron star, forming an accretion column and producing X-rays. Located 19,000 light-years away, <a href="QX%20Normae">QX Normae</a> is an active <a href="X-ray%20binary%23Low-mass%20X-ray%20binary">low mass X ray binary</a> composed of a neutron star and its companion star that is smaller and cooler than the Sun. The neutron star is 1.74 ± 0.14 times as massive as the Sun, yet its radius is a mere 9.3 ± 1.0 km. <a href="1E161348-5055">1E161348-5055</a> is a neutron star found in the centre of <a href="RCW103">RCW103</a> <a href="supernova%20remnant">supernova remnant</a>. A periodic <a href="X-Ray">X-Ray</a> source with a period of 6.67 hours, it is approximately 2000 years old and 10,000 light-years away from Earth. It is unusual in that it is spinning much too slowly for its young age, behaving instead like a multi-million-year-old star. <a href="SGR%20J1550-5418">SGR J1550-5418</a> is a <a href="soft%20gamma%20repeater">soft gamma repeater</a> (SGR)—a <a href="magnetar">magnetar</a> that is emitting gamma ray flares, located some 30,000 light-years distant from Earth. The rotation period, of approximately 2.07 seconds, is the fastest yet observed for a magnetar. <a href="XTE%20J1550-564">XTE J1550-564</a> is another X-ray binary, this time composed of a large black hole around 10 times as massive as the Sun and a cool orange donor star. The black hole is a <a href="X-ray%20binary%23Microquasar">microquasar</a>, firing off <a href="Astrophysical%20jet">jets</a> of material most likely from its accretion disk.

Four star systems are known to harbour planets. <a href="HD%20330075">HD 330075</a> is a sunlike star around 164 light-years distant that is orbited by a <a href="hot%20Jupiter">hot Jupiter</a> every 3.4 days. Announced in 2004, it was the first planet discovered by the <a href="HARPS">HARPS</a> <a href="spectrograph">spectrograph</a>. <a href="HD%20148156">HD 148156</a> is a star 168 ± 7 light-years distant. Slightly larger and hotter than the Sun, it was found to have a roughly Jupiter-size planet with an orbital period of 2.8 years. <a href="HD%20143361">HD 143361</a> is a binary star system composed of a sunlike star and a faint red dwarf separated by 30.9 AU. A planet roughly triple the mass of Jupiter orbits the brighter star every 1057± 20 days. <a href="HD%20142415">HD 142415</a> is approximately 113 light-years distant and has a Jupiter-sized planet with an orbital period of around 386 days.

Due to its location on the Milky Way, this constellation contains many <a href="deep-sky%20object">deep-sky object</a>s such as <a href="star%20cluster">star cluster</a>s, including eight <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a>s visible through binoculars. <a href="NGC%206087">NGC 6087</a> is the brightest of the <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a>s in Norma with a magnitude of 5.4. It lies in the southeastern corner of the constellation between <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a> and <a href="Zeta%20Arae">Zeta Arae</a>. Thought to be around 100 million years old, it is about 3300 light-years away and is around 14 light-years in diameter. Its brightest member is the <a href="Cepheid%20variable">Cepheid variable</a> <a href="S%20Normae">S Normae</a>. A rich background star field makes it less distinct, though around 36 member stars are visible though a 10 cm telescope at 150x magnification.

Tiruchirappalli

Tiruchirappalli () (<a href="Renaming%20of%20cities%20in%20India">formerly</a> Trichinopoly in English), also called Trichy, is a major <a href="tier%20II%20city">tier II city</a> in the <a href="States%20and%20union%20territories%20of%20India">Indian state</a> of <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> and the administrative headquarters of <a href="Tiruchirappalli%20District">Tiruchirappalli District</a>. Trichy is the fourth largest city as well as the fourth largest <a href="urban%20agglomeration">urban agglomeration</a> in the state. Located south of <a href="Chennai">Chennai</a> and north of <a href="Kanyakumari">Kanyakumari</a>, Tiruchirappalli sits almost at the geographic centre of the state. The <a href="Cauvery%20Delta">Cauvery Delta</a> begins west of the city where the <a href="Kaveri">Kaveri river</a> splits into two, forming the island of <a href="Srirangam">Srirangam</a>, which is now incorporated into the <a href="Tiruchirappalli%20City%20Municipal%20Corporation">Tiruchirappalli City Municipal Corporation</a>. Occupying , the city was home to 916,857 people in 2011.

Tiruchirappalli's <a href="recorded%20history">recorded history</a> begins in the 3rd century BC, when it was under the rule of the <a href="Chola%20Kingdom">Cholas</a>. The city has also been ruled by the <a href="Pandyas">Pandyas</a>, <a href="Pallavas">Pallavas</a>, <a href="Mutharaiyars">Mutharaiyars</a>, <a href="Vijayanagar%20Empire">Vijayanagar Empire</a>, <a href="Nayak%20Dynasty">Nayak Dynasty</a>, the <a href="Nawab%20of%20the%20Carnatic">Carnatic state</a> and the <a href="British%20Raj">British</a>. The most prominent historical monuments in Tiruchirappalli include the <a href="Tiruchirapalli%20Rock%20Fort">Rockfort</a>, the <a href="Srirangam%20Ranganathaswamy%20temple">Ranganathaswamy temple at Srirangam</a> and the <a href="Jambukeswarar%20Temple%2C%20Thiruvanaikaval">Jambukeswarar temple at Thiruvanaikaval</a>. The archaeologically important town of <a href="Uraiyur">Uraiyur</a>, capital of the Early Cholas, is now a suburb of Tiruchirappalli. The city played a critical role in the <a href="Carnatic%20Wars">Carnatic Wars</a> (1746–1763) between the <a href="British%20East%20India%20Company">British</a> and the <a href="French%20East%20India%20Company">French East India companies</a>.

The city is an important educational centre in the state of Tamil Nadu and houses nationally recognised institutions such as <a href="Indian%20Institute%20of%20Management%20Tiruchirappalli">Indian Institute of Management</a> (IIMT), <a href="Indian%20Institute%20of%20Information%20Technology%2C%20Srirangam">Indian Institute of Information Technology</a> (IIIT) and <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Technology%2C%20Tiruchirappalli">National Institute of Technology</a> (NITT). Industrial units such as <a href="Bharat%20Heavy%20Electricals%20Limited">Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited</a> (BHEL), <a href="Golden%20Rock%20Railway%20Workshop">Golden Rock Railway Workshop</a>, <a href="Ordnance%20Factory%20Tiruchirappalli">Ordnance Factory Tiruchirappalli</a> (OFT) and <a href="Heavy%20Alloy%20Penetrator%20Project">Heavy Alloy Penetrator Project</a> (HAPP) have their factories in the city. The presence of a large number of energy equipment manufacturing units in and around the city has earned it the title of "Energy Equipment and Fabrication Capital of India". Tiruchirappalli is internationally known for a brand of "<a href="cheroot">cheroot</a>" known as the <a href="Trichinopoly%20cigar">Trichinopoly cigar</a>, which was exported in large quantities to the United Kingdom during the 19th century.

A major road and railway hub in the state, the city is served by the <a href="Tiruchirappalli%20International%20Airport">Tiruchirappalli International Airport</a> (TRZ) which operates flights to the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>.

According to <a href="Hindu%20mythology">Hindu mythology</a>, Tiruchirappalli derives its name from the three-headed demon "Trishira", who <a href="Tapas%20%28Sanskrit%29">meditated</a> on the Hindu god <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a> near the present-day city to obtain favours from the god. An alternative derivation, not universally accepted, is that the source of the city's name is the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word "Trishirapuram"—"<a href="Trishira">Trishira</a>", meaning "three-headed", and "palli" or "puram" meaning "city".

<a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a> scholar <a href="C.%20P.%20Brown">C. P. Brown</a> has proposed that Tiruchirappalli might be a derivative of the word "Chiruta-palli" meaning "little town". <a href="Orientalists">Orientalists</a> <a href="Henry%20Yule">Henry Yule</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Coke%20Burnell">Arthur Coke Burnell</a> have speculated that the name may derive from a rock inscription carved in the 16th century in which Tiruchirappalli is written as "Tiru-ssila-palli", meaning "holy-rock-town" in Tamil. Other scholars have suggested that the name Tiruchirappalli is a rewording of "Tiru-chinna-palli", meaning "holy little town". The "Madras Glossary" gives the root as "Tiruććināppalli" or the "holy ("tiru") village ("palli") of the "shina" ("<a href="Cissampelos%20pareira">Cissampelos pareira</a>") plant".

Historically, Tiruchirappalli was commonly referred to in English as "Trichinopoly". The shortened forms "Trichy" or "Tiruchi" are used in common parlance and the full name Tiruchirapalli appears in official use by government and quasi-government departments but seldom by the native people.

Tiruchirappalli is one of the oldest inhabited cities in <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>; its earliest settlements date back to the second millennium BC. <a href="Uraiyur">Uraiyur</a>, the capital of the Early Cholas for 600 years from the 3rd century BC onwards, is a suburb of present-day Tiruchirappalli. The city is referred to as Orthoura by the historian <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> in his 2nd-century work "<a href="Geography%20%28Ptolemy%29">Geography</a>". The world's oldest surviving dam, the <a href="Kallanai">Kallanai</a> (Lower Anaicut) about from Uraiyur, was built across the Kaveri River by <a href="Karikala%20Chola">Karikala Chola</a> in the 2nd century AD.

The medieval history of Tiruchirappalli begins with the reign of the Pallava king <a href="Mahendravarman%20I">Mahendravarman I</a>, who ruled over South India in the 6th century AD and constructed the rock-cut cave-temples within the <a href="Tiruchirapalli%20Rock%20Fort">Rockfort</a>. Following the downfall of the Pallavas in the 8th century, the city was conquered by the <a href="Medieval%20Cholas">Medieval Cholas</a>, who ruled until the 13th century.

After the decline of the Cholas, Tiruchirappalli was conquered by the <a href="Pandyan%20Dynasty">Pandyas</a>, who ruled from 1216 until their defeat in 1311 by <a href="Malik%20Kafur">Malik Kafur</a>, the commander of <a href="Allauddin%20Khilji">Allauddin Khilji</a>. The victorious armies of the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a> are believed to have plundered and ravaged the region. The idol of the Hindu god <a href="Ranganatha">Ranganatha</a> in the temple of <a href="Srirangam">Srirangam</a> vanished at about this time and was not recovered and reinstated for more than fifty years. Tiruchirappalli was ruled by the Delhi and <a href="Madurai%20Sultanate">Madurai</a> sultanates from 1311 to 1378, but by the middle of the 14th century the Madurai Sultanate had begun to fall apart. Gradually, the Vijayanagar Empire established supremacy over the northern parts of the kingdom, and Tiruchirappalli was taken by the Vijayanagar prince <a href="Kumara%20Kampana">Kumara Kampanna Udaiyar</a> in 1371. The Vijayanagar Empire ruled the region from 1378 until the 1530s, and played a prominent role in reviving Hinduism by reconstructing temples and monuments destroyed by the previous Muslim rulers. Following the collapse of the Vijayanagar Empire in the early part of the 16th century, the <a href="Madurai%20Nayaks">Madurai Nayak kingdom</a> began to assert its independence. The city flourished during the reign of <a href="Vishwanatha%20Nayak">Vishwanatha Nayak</a> (c. 1529–1564), who is said to have protected the area by constructing the <a href="Teppakulam%2C%20Tiruchirapppalli">Teppakulam</a> and building walls around the Srirangam temple. His successor <a href="Kumara%20Krishnappa%20Nayak">Kumara Krishnappa Nayak</a>a made Tiruchirappalli his capital, and it served as the capital of the Madurai Nayak kingdom from 1616 to 1634 and from 1665 to 1736.

In 1736 the last Madurai Nayak ruler, <a href="Meenakshi%20%28Nayak%20queen%29">Meenakshi</a>, committed suicide, and Tiruchirappalli was conquered by <a href="Chanda%20Sahib">Chanda Sahib</a>. He ruled the kingdom from 1736 to 1741, when he was captured and imprisoned by the <a href="Marathas">Marathas</a> in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Trichinopoly%20%281741%29">siege of Tiruchirappalli (1741)</a> led by general <a href="Raghuji%20Bhonsle">Raghuji Bhonsle</a> under the orders of <a href="Chhattrapati%20Shahu">Chhattrapati Shahu</a>. Chanda Sahib remained prisoner for about eight years before making his escape from the Maratha Empire. Tiruchirappalli was administered by the Maratha general <a href="Murari%20Rao">Murari Rao</a> from 1741 to 1743, when it was acquired by the <a href="Nizam%20of%20Hyderabad">Nizam of Hyderabad</a>, who bribed Rao to hand over the city. Nizam appointed Khwaja Abdullah as the ruler and returned to <a href="Golkonda">Golkonda</a>. When the <a href="Nawab%20of%20the%20Carnatic">Nawab of the Carnatic</a> <a href="Muhammed%20Ali%20Khan%20Wallajah">Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah</a> was dethroned by Chanda Sahib after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ambur">Battle of Ambur</a> (1749), the former fled to Tiruchirappalli, where he set up his base. The subsequent <a href="Siege%20of%20Trichinopoly%20%281751-1752%29">siege of Tiruchirappalli (1751–1752)</a> by Chanda Sahib took place during the <a href="Second%20Carnatic%20War">Second Carnatic War</a> between the <a href="British%20East%20India%20Company">British East India Company</a> and Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah on one side and Chanda Sahib and the <a href="French%20East%20India%20Company">French East India Company</a> on the other. The British were victorious and Wallajah was restored to the throne. During his reign he proposed renaming the city Natharnagar after the Sufi saint <a href="Nathar%20Vali">Nathar Vali</a>, who is thought to have lived there in the 12th century AD. Tiruchirappalli was invaded by <a href="Nanjaraja%20Wodeyar">Nanjaraja Wodeyar</a> in 1753 and <a href="Hyder%20Ali">Hyder Ali</a> of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Mysore">Mysore kingdom</a> in 1780, both attacks repulsed by the troops of the British East India Company. A third invasion attempt, by <a href="Tipu%20Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a>—son of Hyder Ali—in 1793, was also unsuccessful; he was pursued by British forces led by <a href="William%20Medows">William Medows</a>, who thwarted the attack.

The Carnatic kingdom was <a href="Carnatic%20Treaty">annexed by the British</a> in July 1801 as a consequence of the discovery of collusion between Tipu Sultan—an enemy of the British—and <a href="Umdat%20Ul-Umra">Umdat Ul-Umra</a>, son of Wallajah and the <a href="Nawab">Nawab</a> at the time, during the <a href="Fourth%20Anglo-Mysore%20War">Fourth Anglo-Mysore War</a>. Trichinopoly was incorporated into the <a href="Madras%20Presidency">Madras Presidency</a> the same year, and the district of <a href="Trichinopoly%20District">Trichinopoly</a> was formed, with the city of Trichinopoly (or Tiruchirappalli) as its capital.

During the <a href="Company%20Raj">Company Raj</a> and later the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a>, Tiruchirappalli emerged as one of the most important cities in India. According to the <a href="Indian%20census">1871 Indian census</a>—the first in British India—Tiruchirappalli had a population of 76,530, making it the second largest city in the presidency after the capital of Madras. It was known throughout the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> for its unique variety of "cheroot", known as the <a href="Trichinopoly%20cigar">Trichinopoly cigar</a>. Tiruchirappalli was the first headquarters for the newly formed <a href="South%20Indian%20Railway%20Company">South Indian Railway Company</a> in 1874 until its relocation to <a href="Madras">Madras</a> in the early 20th century.

Tiruchirappalli played an active role during the <a href="Indian%20independence%20movement">pre-independence era</a>; there were a number of strikes and non-violent protests during the <a href="Quit%20India%20Movement">Quit India Movement</a>, notably the <a href="1928%20South%20Indian%20Railway%20Strike">South Indian Railway Strike</a> that took place in 1928. The city was the base for the <a href="Vedaranyam%20march">Vedaranyam salt march</a> initiated by <a href="C.%20Rajagopalachari">C. Rajagopalachari</a> in parallel with the <a href="Dandi%20March">Dandi March</a> in 1930. Tiruchirappalli was an epicentre of the <a href="anti-Hindi%20agitations%20of%20Tamil%20Nadu">anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu</a> when a team of Tamil language supporters gathered and organised a rally from the city to Madras in <a href="Anti-Hindi%20agitation%20of%201937%E2%80%9340">1938</a>. Later in 1965, Tiruchirappalli was made the base of the "Madras state Anti-Hindi Conference" convened by C. Rajagopalachari. The population of Tiruchirappalli continued to grow rapidly, achieving a growth rate of 36.9% during the period 1941–51. After independence in 1947, Tiruchirappalli fell behind other cities such as <a href="Salem%2C%20Tamil%20Nadu">Salem</a> and <a href="Coimbatore">Coimbatore</a> in terms of growth. Tiruchirappalli remained a part of <a href="Madras%20State">Madras State</a>, which was renamed Tamil Nadu in 1969. The city underwent extensive economic development in the 1960s with the commissioning of <a href="Bharat%20Heavy%20Electricals%20Limited">Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited</a>. In the early 1980s, <a href="M.%20G.%20Ramachandran">M. G. Ramachandran</a>, then <a href="List%20of%20Chief%20Ministers%20of%20Tamil%20Nadu">Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu</a> drafted a plan to move the state's administrative headquarters to Tiruchirappalli. A <a href="satellite%20town">satellite town</a> was developed near <a href="Navalpattu">Navalpattu</a> on the outskirts of the city, but the proposed move was shelved by successive governments.

Like much of Tamil Nadu, Tiruchirappalli remains prone to communal tensions based on religion and ethnicity. There have been occasional outbreaks of <a href="Attacks%20on%20Sri%20Lankans%20in%20Tamil%20Nadu">violence against Sri Lankans</a>. In 2009, the offices of a Sri Lankan airline were attacked in the city. In September 2012, two groups of Sri Lankan pilgrims who had visited the <a href="Basilica%20of%20Our%20Lady%20of%20Good%20Health">Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health</a> in <a href="Velankanni">Velankanni</a> and the <a href="Poondi%20Madha%20Basilica">Poondi Madha Basilica</a> had their buses attacked in Tiruchirappalli by a group of Tamil activists. Owing to a series of terrorist attacks in Indian cities since 2000, security has been increased at sites such as <a href="Sri%20Ranganathaswamy%20Temple%2C%20Srirangam">Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple</a>.

Tiruchirappalli is the headquarters of the Trichy region of TNEB. The city and its suburbs form the Trichy Metro Electricity Distribution Circle, which is subdivided into six divisions. A chief distribution engineer is stationed at the regional headquarters at <a href="Tennur">Tennur</a>. Water supply is provided by the <a href="Tiruchirappalli%20City%20Municipal%20Corporation">Tiruchirappalli City Corporation</a>. The city gets its drinking water supply from the Kaveri River and 1,470 bore wells linked to 60 service reservoirs in and around the city. Four of the six head works from which the city gets its water supply are maintained by the municipal corporation and the rest by other agencies.

Pollution has been a major concern in Tiruchirappalli. The <a href="Tamil%20Nadu%20Pollution%20Control%20Board">Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board</a> has set up five stations in the city to check the quality of air. As of 2012, about of solid waste are produced in the city every day. Solid waste management in the city is handled by the corporation; places such as the Gandhi Market, Central Bus terminus and the Chathram bus terminus are being monitored by other agencies. The principal landfill is at Ariyamangalam. Waste water management in the Trichy-Srirangam underground drainage (UGD) areas is handled by the <a href="Tamil%20Nadu%20Water%20Supply%20and%20Drainage%20Board">Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board</a> (TWAD) and in other areas by the Tiruchirappalli Municipal Corporation. As of 2013, there were a total of 40,580 UGD connections maintained by the municipal corporation. The high toxicity of the waste water released by the Trichy Distilleries and Chemicals Limited (TDCL) is a major cause of concern for the corporation. The corporation's annual expenditure for the year 2010–11 was estimated to be . In 2013, researchers from Bharathidasan University assessed water quality in the Tiruchirappalli area and concluded that although the quality of the groundwater was suitable for human consumption, the quality of the pond water in the city was "not fit for human usage, agricultural or industrial purposes".

Under the National Urban Sanitation Policy, Tiruchirappalli was ranked sixth in India and first in Tamil Nadu on the basis of sanitation for the year 2009–10. In January 2010, Tiruchirappalli became the first city in India where open defecation was prevented in all its slums. In a 2016 survey conducted by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Urban%20Development">Ministry of Urban Development</a>, as a part of the <a href="Swachh%20Bharat%20Abhiyan">Swachh Bharat Abhiyan</a> campaign, Tiruchirappalli was ranked third in the <a href="Cleanest%20cities%20in%20India">list of cleanest cities in India</a>.

Tiruchirappalli comes under the Tiruchi Telecom District of the <a href="Bharat%20Sanchar%20Nigam">Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited</a> (BSNL), India's state-owned telecom and internet services provider. There are about 20,000 business telephone subscribers in the city. Both Global System for Mobile Communications (<a href="GSM">GSM</a>) and <a href="Code%20division%20multiple%20access">Code division multiple access</a> (CDMA) mobile services are available. BSNL also provides broadband internet services. BSNL began offering wireless internet services with the commencement of <a href="Evolution-Data%20Optimized">Evolution-Data Optimized</a> (EVDO) transmission in 2008. Tiruchirappalli is one of the few cities in India where BSNL's Caller Line Identification (CLI)-based internet service Netone is available. Softnet (STPI), <a href="Tata%20Communications">Tata VSNL</a>, <a href="Bharti%20Airtel">Bharti</a> and <a href="Reliance%20Communications">Reliance</a> are other major broadband internet service providers in the city.

Tiruchirappalli has a passport office, the second in Tamil Nadu, which commenced its operations on 23 March 1983. The office also caters to the needs of seven adjacent districts namely, <a href="Karur%20District">Karur</a>, Nagappattinam, Perambalur, Pudukkottai, Thanjavur, Ariyalur and Tiruvarur.

The most commonly used modes of local transport in Tiruchirappalli are the state government-owned <a href="Tamil%20Nadu%20State%20Transport%20Corporation">Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation</a> (TNSTC) buses, and <a href="auto%20rickshaw">auto rickshaw</a>s. Tiruchirappalli forms a part of the Kumbakonam division of the TNSTC. The city has two major bus termini; <a href="Chatram%20Bus%20Stand">Chatram Bus Stand</a> and <a href="Central%20Bus%20Stand">Central Bus Stand</a>, both of which operate intercity services and local transport to suburban areas.

Tiruchirappalli sits at the confluence of two major National Highways<a href="National%20Highway%2045%20%28India%29">NH 45</a> and <a href="National%20Highway%2067%20%28India%29">NH 67</a>. NH 45 is one of the most congested highways in south India and carries almost 10,000 lorries on the Tiruchirappalli–Chennai stretch every night. Other National Highways originating in the city are <a href="National%20Highway%2045B%20%28India%29">NH 45B</a>, <a href="National%20Highway%20210%20%28India%29">NH 210</a> and <a href="National%20Highway%20227%20%28India%29">NH 227</a>. State highways that start from the city include <a href="State%20Highway%2025%20%28Tamil%20Nadu%29">SH 25</a> and SH 62. Tiruchirappalli has of road maintained by the municipal corporation. A semi-ring road connecting all the National Highways is being constructed to ease traffic congestion in the city. As of 2013, approximately 328,000 two-wheelers, 93,500 cars and 10,000 public transport vehicles operate within the city limits, apart from the 1,500 inter-city buses that pass through Tiruchirappalli daily. Tiruchirappalli suffers from traffic congestion mainly because of its narrow roads and absence of an integrated bus station.

Passenger trains also carry a significant number of passengers from nearby towns. The Great Southern of India Railway Company was established in 1853 with its headquarters at England. In 1859, the company constructed its first railway line connecting Tiruchirappalli and Nagapattinam. The company merged with the Carnatic Railway Company in 1874 to form the <a href="South%20Indian%20Railway%20Company">South Indian Railway Company</a> with Tiruchirappalli as its headquarters. The city retained the position until 1908 when the company's headquarters was transferred to Madras. is the second biggest railway station in Tamil Nadu and one of the busiest in India. It constitutes a <a href="Tiruchirappalli%20railway%20division">separate division</a> of the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20zone">Southern Railway</a>. Tiruchirappalli has rail connectivity with most important cities and towns in India.

Mutual Broadcasting System

The Mutual Broadcasting System (commonly referred to simply as Mutual; sometimes referred to as MBS, Mutual Radio or the Mutual Radio Network) was an <a href="United%20States">American</a> commercial <a href="radio%20network">radio network</a> in operation from 1934 to 1999. In the <a href="Old-time%20radio">golden age of U.S. radio drama</a>, Mutual was best known as the original network home of "<a href="The%20Lone%20Ranger">The Lone Ranger</a>" and "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Superman%20%28radio%29">The Adventures of Superman</a>" and as the long-time radio residence of "<a href="The%20Shadow">The Shadow</a>". For many years, it was a national broadcaster for <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20Mutual">Major League Baseball</a> (including the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star Game</a> and <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a>), the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a>, and <a href="Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football">Notre Dame football</a>. From the mid-1930s and until the retirement of the network in 1999, Mutual ran a highly respected news service accompanied by a variety of popular commentary shows. During the late 1970s, Mutual pioneered the nationwide late night call-in radio show and introduced the country to <a href="Larry%20King">Larry King</a>.

In the early 1970s, acting in much the same style as rival <a href="Cumulus%20Media%20Networks">ABC</a> had <a href="Cumulus%20Media%20Networks%23ABC%20Radio%20Networks">two years earlier</a> (in 1968), Mutual launched four radio networks: <a href="Mutual%20Black%20Network">Mutual Black Network</a> (MBN) (initially launched as "Mutual Reports"), which evolved to today's <a href="American%20Urban%20Radio%20Networks">American Urban Radio Networks</a> (AURN); Mutual Cadena Hispánica (trans. "Mutual Spanish Network"); Mutual Southwest Network, and <a href="Mutual%20Lifestyle%20Radio">Mutual Progressive Network</a> (was later re-branded "Mutual Lifestyle Radio" in 1980, then cancelled in 1983).

Of the four national networks of American radio's classic era, Mutual had for decades the largest number of <a href="Network%20affiliate">affiliate</a>s, but the least certain financial position (which prevented Mutual from expanding into television broadcasting after World War II, as the other three networks did). For the first 18 years of its existence, Mutual was owned and operated as a <a href="cooperative">cooperative</a> (a system similar to that of today's <a href="National%20Public%20Radio">National Public Radio</a>), setting the network apart from its corporate owned competitors. Mutual's member stations shared their own original programming, transmission and promotion expenses, and advertising revenues. From December 30, 1936, when it debuted in the West, the Mutual Broadcasting System had affiliates from coast to coast. Its business structure would change after <a href="General%20Tire">General Tire</a> assumed majority ownership in 1952 through a series of regional and individual station acquisitions.

Once General Tire sold the network in 1957, Mutual's ownership was largely disconnected from the stations it served, leading to a more conventional, top-down model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual as a vehicle for foreign <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a>. The network's reputation was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding years—even leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, <a href="Westwood%20One%20%281976%E2%80%932011%29">Westwood One</a>, which purchased Mutual in 1985, was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire.

Attempts at establishing cooperatively owned radio networks had been made since the 1920s. In 1929, a group of four radio stations in the major markets of New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Detroit organized into a loose confederation known as the Quality Network. Five years later (in 1934), a similar or identical group of stations founded the Mutual Broadcasting System. Mutual's original participating stations were <a href="WOR%20%28AM%29">WOR</a>–<a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark, New Jersey</a>, just outside New York (owned by the <a href="Bamberger%27s%23WOR%20history">Bamberger Broadcasting Service</a>, a division of <a href="Macy%27s">R.H. Macy and Company</a>; in 1949, <a href="WWOR-TV">WOR-TV</a> would begin broadcasting & Bamberger would be renamed General Teleradio, due to <a href="General%20Tire">General Tire & Rubber</a>'s increased investment in the TV station), <a href="WGN%20%28AM%29">WGN</a>–Chicago (owned by WGN Inc., a subsidiary of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>"), <a href="WXYT%20%28AM%29">WXYZ</a>–Detroit (owned by Kunsky-Trendle Broadcasting), and <a href="WLW">WLW</a>–Cincinnati (owned by the Crosley Radio Company). The network was organized on September 29, 1934, with the members contracting for telephone-line transmission facilities and agreeing to collectively enter into contracts with advertisers for their networked shows. WOR and WGN, based in the two largest markets and providing the bulk of the programming, were the acknowledged leaders of the group. On October 29, 1934, Mutual Broadcasting System, Inc. was incorporated, with Bamberger and WGN Inc. each holding 50% of the stock—five each of the ten total shares.

The three national radio networks already in operation—the <a href="CBS">Columbia Broadcasting System</a> and the <a href="NBC">National Broadcasting Company</a>'s <a href="NBC%20Red%20Network">NBC Red</a> and <a href="Blue%20Network">NBC Blue</a>—were corporate controlled: programming was produced by the network (or by advertising agencies of program sponsors that purchased airtime on the network) and distributed to affiliates, most of which were independently owned. In contrast, the Mutual Broadcasting System was run as a true cooperative venture, with programming produced by and shared between the group's members. The majority of the early programming, from WOR and WGN, consisted of musical features and inexpensive dramatic serials. WOR had "<a href="The%20Witch%27s%20Tale">The Witch's Tale</a>", a horror anthology series whose "hunner-an'-thirteen-year-old" narrator invited listeners to "douse all [the] lights. Now draw up to the fire an' gaze into the embers ..."gaaaaze into 'em deep!"... an' soon ye'll be across the seas, in th' jungle land of Africa ... hear that chantin' and them savage drums?" WGN contributed the popular comedy series "<a href="Lum%20and%20Abner">Lum and Abner</a>". Detroit's WXYZ provided "<a href="The%20Lone%20Ranger">The Lone Ranger</a>", which had debuted in 1933 and was already in demand. It is often claimed that Mutual was launched primarily as a vehicle for the Western serial, but "Lum and Abner" was no less popular at the time. What WLW brought was sheer power; billing itself as "The Nation's Station," in May 1934 it had begun night broadcasting at a massive 500,000 watts, ten times the <a href="clear-channel%20station">clear-channel</a> standard.

On May 24, 1935, the network aired its inaugural live event—the first-ever night baseball game, between the <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> and the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a>. In September, WXYZ dropped out to join NBC Blue, though contractual obligations kept "The Lone Ranger" on Mutual, airing three times a week, through spring 1942. The hole in the Detroit market was immediately filled by <a href="CKLW">CKLW</a> in <a href="Windsor%2C%20Ontario">Windsor, Ontario</a>, just across the river. In October, the network began a decades-long run as broadcaster of baseball's World Series, with airtime responsibilities shared between WGN's <a href="Bob%20Elson">Bob Elson</a> and Quin Ryan and WLW's <a href="Red%20Barber">Red Barber</a> (NBC and CBS also carried the series that year; the Fall Classic would air on all three networks through 1938). Mutual broadcast its first Notre Dame football game that autumn as well, beginning another relationship that would last for decades. As an income-generating business, the Mutual network was a modest endeavor at the start: in the first eleven months of 1935, the cooperative garnered $1.1 million in advertising, compared to NBC's $28.3 million and CBS's $15.8 million.

In the fall of 1936, Mutual lost another of its founding members when WLW departed. The network, however, was in the midst of a major expansion: the first outside group of stations to sign on with Mutual was <a href="John%20Shepard%20III">John Shepard</a>'s Colonial Network with its Boston <a href="Flagship%20%28radio%29">flagship station</a>, <a href="WFTQ">WAAB</a>, and thirteen affiliates around New England. There was good reason for this affiliation: Shepard had been involved with the founding of Mutual, and served on its board of directors. Cleveland's <a href="WHKW">WGAR</a> also became an affiliate, as did five Midwestern stations: <a href="KXFN">KWK</a>–St. Louis, Mo.; <a href="KXNO">KSO</a>–Des Moines, Iowa; <a href="WMT%20%28AM%29">WMT</a>–Cedar Rapids, Iowa; <a href="KOIL">KOIL</a>–Omaha, Neb.; and <a href="KFOR%20%28AM%29">KFOR</a>–Lincoln, Neb. The big prize came in December, when the <a href="Don%20Lee%20%28broadcaster%29">Don Lee</a> <a href="Don%20Lee%20Network">Network</a>, the leading regional web on the West Coast, left CBS to become a central participant in Mutual. Don Lee brought its four <a href="owned-and-operated%20station">owned-and-operated station</a>s—<a href="KHJ%20%28AM%29">KHJ</a>–Los Angeles, <a href="KFRC%20%28defunct%29">KFRC</a>–San Francisco, <a href="KLSD">KGB</a>–San Diego, and KDB–Santa Barbara—along with six California affiliates and, via <a href="shortwave">shortwave</a> hookup, two more in Hawaii. Mutual now had a nationwide presence. During 1936, as well, an offer by <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> to purchase the network was apparently made and rejected.

In January 1937, ownership of WAAB was consolidated with that of another Boston station controlled by Shepard: <a href="WRKO">WNAC</a> was flagship of the <a href="Yankee%20Network">Yankee Network</a>, a circuit of New England radio stations whose membership partially overlapped with that of Colonial. Yankee flagship <a href="WRKO">WNAC</a> had been an affiliate of <a href="CBS%20Radio">CBS Radio</a>, changing affiliation to <a href="NBC%20Red">NBC Red</a> later in 1937 when CBS purchased <a href="WEZE">WEEI</a> in that city. The Texas Network soon added twenty-three more stations to the Mutual affiliate roster. WGAR dropped out, but the United Broadcasting Company, part of "<a href="The%20Plain%20Dealer">The Plain Dealer</a>" business, joined with its lead station, <a href="WHK%20%28AM%29">WHK</a>. Within a few years, this new Ohio participant would become one of the network's central members, a shareowner in Mutual. By the end of 1938, Mutual had 74 exclusive affiliates; though the two leading radio network companies discouraged dual hookups, Mutual shared another 25 affiliates with NBC and 5 with CBS. The total of 104 affiliates put Mutual not far behind the leaders. Because of the corporate strength behind NBC and CBS, however, and the fact that the lion's share of the most powerful stations in the country had already signed with them before Mutual's emergence (the exceptional, and soon departed, WLW aside), the cooperative network would be at a permanent disadvantage.

On the programming front, 1936 saw Mutual launch the first network advice show, "The Good Will Hour", hosted by John J. Anthony and sponsored by <a href="physical%20culture">physical culture</a> guru <a href="Bernarr%20Macfadden">Bernarr Macfadden</a>. The program was a new take on "Ask Mister Anthony", which had aired on a local New York station in 1932, "dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code." Anthony, whose real name was Lester Kroll, brought a wealth of relevant experience to his work—he had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments. In July 1937 came the premiere of a seven-part <a href="Les%20Mis%C3%A9rables%20%28radio%20series%29">adaptation of "Les Misérables"</a>, produced, written, and directed by <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a> and featuring many of his <a href="Mercury%20Theatre">Mercury Theatre</a> performers—Mercury's first appearance on the air. September 26, 1937, proved a particularly momentous date: that evening, "<a href="The%20Shadow">The Shadow</a>" came to Mutual. The show would become a mainstay of the network for more than a decade and a half and one of the most popular programs in radio history. For the first year of its Mutual run, Welles provided the voice of The Shadow and his newly created alter ego, Lamont Cranston. He played the part anonymously at first. But, as one chronicler put it, "nothing to do with Welles could remain a secret for very long."

In April 1938, the network picked up "<a href="The%20Green%20Hornet%20%28radio%20series%29">The Green Hornet</a>" from former member WXYZ. Mutual gave the twice-a-week series its first national exposure until November 1939, when it switched to NBC Blue. (The series would return very briefly to Mutual in the fall of 1940). Mutual also provided the national launching pad for <a href="Kay%20Kyser">Kay Kyser</a> and his "<a href="Kay%20Kyser%27s%20Kollege%20of%20Musical%20Knowledge">Kollege of Musical Knowledge</a>" radio show. Kyser's enormous success at Mutual soon allowed his show to move to NBC and its much larger audience. By May 1939, Mutual was broadcasting the <a href="Indianapolis%20500">Indianapolis 500</a>. That autumn, Mutual won exclusive broadcast rights to the World Series. As described in a 1943 Supreme Court ruling upholding the regulatory power of the <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a>, Mutual "offered this program of outstanding national interest to stations throughout the country, including NBC and CBS affiliates in communities having no other stations. CBS and NBC immediately invoked the 'exclusive affiliation' clauses of their agreements with these stations, and as a result thousands of persons in many sections of the country were unable to hear the broadcasts of the games." This was the first example given in the ruling of "abuses" perpetrated by the two leading broadcast companies.

Mutual also began building a reputation as a strong news service, rivaling the industry leaders in quality if not budget. The broadcasts of WOR reporter <a href="Gabriel%20Heatter">Gabriel Heatter</a> from the <a href="Lindbergh%20kidnapping">Lindbergh kidnapping</a> "trial of the century" in 1935, heard over Mutual, were highly regarded; Heatter soon had his own regularly scheduled newscast, aired nationally five nights a week. In 1936, also via WOR, Mutual began broadcasting the reports of news commentator <a href="Raymond%20Gram%20Swing">Raymond Gram Swing</a>, who became one of the country's leading voices on foreign affairs. In November 1937, conservative commentator <a href="Fulton%20Lewis">Fulton Lewis Jr.</a>, heard five nights weekly from Mutual affiliate <a href="WOL%20%28AM%29">WOL</a>, became the first national news personality to broadcast out of Washington, D.C.; he would remain with the network until his death almost three decades later. In 1938, Mutual started rebroadcasting news reports from the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> and English-language newscasts from the European mainland. The network also began employing its own reporters in Europe as the continent headed toward crisis, including John Steele, Waverly Root, Arthur Mann, and Victor Lusinchi. Among these was <a href="Sigrid%20Schultz">Sigrid Schultz</a>, the first accomplished female foreign correspondent to appear on American news radio.

Early in 1940, the corporate organization of Mutual became even more inclusive, as described by scholar Cornelia B. Rose:

Until January, 1940, six groups bore the expense of the network operation in varying degree: stations WGN and WOR owned all the stock of the corporation and guaranteed to make up any deficit; the Colonial Network in New England, the Don Lee System on the Pacific Coast, and the group of stations owned by the Cleveland "Plain Dealer", participated in responsibility for running expenses. A new contract effective February 1, 1940, provides for contributing membership by all the above group[s] plus station CKLW in Detroit-Windsor. These groups now agree to underwrite expenses and become stockholders in the network... An operating board for the network is representatives from each of these groups, together with additional representation appointed by other affiliated stations.
The new cooperative structure was also joined by the owners of <a href="WKRC%20%28AM%29">WKRC</a> in Cincinnati, which had replaced Mutual cofounder WLW in that market. The Mutual corporation now had 100 shares, apportioned as follows:

In 1941, WOR's official city of license was changed to New York. Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by <a href="John%20Shepard%20III">John Shepard III</a>; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to <a href="Worcester%2C%20Massachusetts">Worcester</a>, in central Massachusetts, to avoid <a href="duopoly%20%28broadcasting%29">duopoly</a> restrictions. With <a href="WBZ%20%28AM%29">WBZ</a> taking over the slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, the <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) approved the sale of the Yankee Network—with WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual shares—to the Ohio-based <a href="General%20Tire%20and%20Rubber%20Company">General Tire and Rubber Company</a>.

By 1940, Mutual was already on a par with the industry leaders in terms of affiliate roster size. Still, because Mutual affiliates were mostly in small markets or lesser stations in large ones, the network lagged way behind in advertising revenue—NBC took in eleven times as much as Mutual that year. In 1941, the FCC, calling for NBC to divest one of its two networks, observed that the company "has utilized the Blue to forestall competition with the Red ... Mutual is excluded from, or only lamely admitted to, many important markets." On January 10, 1942, Mutual filed a $10.275 million suit against NBC and its parent company, <a href="RCA">RCA</a>, alleging a conspiracy "hindering and restricting Mutual freely and fairly to compete in the transmission in interstate commerce of nationwide network programs." The FCC's Supreme Court victory in 1943 led to the sale of the Blue Network and Mutual dropping its lawsuit. These developments appear to have been of more symbolic than practical value to Mutual—the transfer of the NBC Blue stations to the new <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Company</a> did little to help Mutual's competitive position. In 1945 it reached 384 affiliates, and by December 1948, Mutual Broadcasting was heard on more than 500 stations in the United States. But this growth did not reflect any ability on Mutual's part to attract leading stations from the corporate-controlled networks. Rather, the FCC had eased its technical standards for local stations, facilitating the establishment of new outlets in small markets: between 1945 and 1952, the number of AM stations rose from around 940 to more than 2,350. It was these new, relatively weak stations Mutual kept picking up. Though by now it had many more affiliates than any other U.S. radio network, for the most part they remained "less desirable in frequency, power, and coverage," as the Supreme Court had put it. For instance, in the postwar era CBS and NBC covered all of North Carolina each with only four stations. Mutual needed fourteen affiliates to deliver comparable statewide coverage.

Late in the decade, there was a brief exploration into the idea of launching a Mutual television network, serious enough to prompt talks with <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> as a potential source of programming talent. In fact, Bamberger Broadcasting's WOR-TV & <a href="WUSA%20%28TV%29">WOIC</a> (the latter a <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> video outlet) maintained letterhead with "Mutual Television" decorating their identifications. Beyond this, there is no confirmation, however, that a cooperative video service was ever seriously considered. The plans never got off the ground and Mutual thus became the only one of the "Big Four" U.S. radio networks not to start (and eventually be dominated by) a television network. While there was no Mutual TV network, this did not mean the group did not have an influence over commercial television's early development. Several Mutual radio affiliates launched their own television stations that would often be affiliated with the television networks of <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>, <a href="NBC">NBC</a>, <a href="CBS">CBS</a> or <a href="DuMont%20Network">DuMont</a>. The cooperative also held the rights to a number of valuable radio properties that made the transition to the new medium, including two of the era's most popular variations on what would later become known as the <a href="tabloid%20talk%20show">tabloid talk show</a> and <a href="reality%20television">"reality" programming</a>: the crabby gabfest "<a href="Leave%20It%20to%20the%20Girls">Leave It to the Girls</a>" and, in particular, "<a href="Queen%20for%20a%20Day">Queen for a Day</a>," which both started on Mutual radio in 1945. Referred to by some as a "misery show," "Queen for a Day" "awarded prizes to women who could come up with the most heart-stabbing stories told by the sick and the downtrodden ... On one show, a mother of nine requested a washing machine to replace one that broke when it fell on her husband and disabled him—and who, by the way, also needed heart surgery." In May 1947, a simulcast version began airing on the Don Lee system's experimental TV station in Los Angeles, W6XAO (later <a href="KCBS-TV">KTSL</a>). It was a smash hit, and by the turn of the decade TV stations all along the coast were broadcasting it to high ratings. In the 1950s, Mutual would stare down NBC for four years as the mighty network sought to take control of the show.

Offscreen, Mutual remained an enterprising broadcaster. In 1940, a program featuring Cedric Foster joined Mutual's respected schedule of news and opinion shows. Foster's claim to fame was as the first daytime commentator to be heard nationally on a daily basis. The network aired that year's <a href="NFL%20Championship%20Game%2C%201940">NFL Championship Game</a> on December 8, the first national broadcast of the annual event. Over the following half decade, Mutual's war coverage held its own with that of the wealthier networks, featuring field correspondents such as Henry Shapiro and Piet Van T Veer and commentators such as <a href="Cecil%20Brown%20%28journalist%29">Cecil Brown</a>, formerly of CBS. At 2:26 p.m. Eastern time, on Sunday, December 7, 1941, Mutual flagship station WOR interrupted a football game broadcast with a news flash reporting the <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor</a>. It was the first public announcement of the attack heard on the U.S. mainland. The first bombs had dropped 63 minutes earlier. In May 1945, Sigrid Schultz reported from one of the last <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">Nazi concentration camps</a> to be discovered, <a href="Ravensbr%C3%BCck%20concentration%20camp">Ravensbrück</a>. The following month, "<a href="Meet%20the%20Press">Meet the Press</a>" premiered with <a href="Martha%20Rountree">Martha Rountree</a> as moderator. For a year and a half in the late 1940s, <a href="William%20Shirer">William Shirer</a> came over from CBS to do current events commentary after his famous falling out with <a href="Edward%20Murrow">Edward Murrow</a>. In 1948, Mutual's four-part series "To Secure These Rights", dramatizing the findings of <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">President Truman</a>'s <a href="President%27s%20Committee%20on%20Civil%20Rights">Committee on Civil Rights</a>, outraged many politicians and the network's own affiliates in the <a href="segregated%20South">segregated South</a>.

In the field of entertainment, Mutual built on the incomparable success of "The Shadow". WGN's "<a href="Chicago%20Theater%20of%20the%20Air">Chicago Theater of the Air</a>", featuring hour-long opera and musical theater productions before a live audience, was broadcast for the first time in May 1940. By 1943, the weekly show was being recorded in front of houses 4,000 strong, gathered to see performances featuring a full orchestra and chorus. "Chicago Theater of the Air" would run on Mutual through March 1955. Mutual provided an early national outlet for the influential, iconoclastic satirist <a href="Henry%20Morgan%20%28humorist%29">Henry Morgan</a>, whose show "Here's Morgan" began its network run in October 1940. Though "The Lone Ranger" moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, within a few months Mutual had another reliable, and no less famous, action hero. "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Superman%20%28radio%29">The Adventures of Superman</a>", picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual launched what would turn into one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as "<a href="Nick%20Carter%20%28literary%20character%29">The Return of Nick Carter</a>" and later retitled "Nick Carter, Master Detective", it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual aired "<a href="The%20New%20Adventures%20of%20Sherlock%20Holmes">The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</a>" starring <a href="Basil%20Rathbone">Basil Rathbone</a> and <a href="Nigel%20Bruce">Nigel Bruce</a>, reprising their roles from the <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal</a> film series. An earlier incarnation of the show had run briefly on the network in 1936; a less starry version would return to Mutual from September 1947 through June 1949. "<a href="The%20Mysterious%20Traveler">The Mysterious Traveler</a>", a proto–"<a href="The%20Twilight%20Zone%20%281959%20TV%20series%29">Twilight Zone</a>" anthology series, aired every week on Mutual from December 1943 until September 1952.

In February 1946, Mutual introduced a quiz show, "<a href="Twenty%20Questions">Twenty Questions</a>", that would run for more than seven years. In October, the detective series "<a href="Let%20George%20Do%20It%20%28radio%29">Let George Do It</a>", starring Bob Bailey, launched as a Mutual/Don Lee presentation; it would also run into the mid-1950s. For two years, starting in 1946 as well, <a href="Steve%20Allen">Steve Allen</a> got his first network exposure on the Mutual/Don Lee morning show "Smile Time", out of Los Angeles's <a href="KHJ%20%28AM%29">KHJ</a>. In February 1947, the religiously oriented "<a href="Family%20Theater">Family Theater</a>" premiered; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars, the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, <a href="Kate%20Smith">Kate Smith</a>, a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual. During most of her initial run at the network, which lasted until September 1951, she had two distinct weekday shows, each 15 minutes long: "Kate Smith Speaks", at noon, and "Kate Smith Sings", later in the hour. The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist <a href="Wyllis%20Cooper">Wyllis Cooper</a> and his highly regarded suspense anthology "<a href="Quiet%2C%20Please">Quiet, Please</a>", which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948. It also aired actor <a href="Alan%20Ladd">Alan Ladd</a>'s similarly lauded drama about a crime-solving mystery novelist, "<a href="Box%2013">Box 13</a>", which ran for precisely a year. Its 52 episodes, which aired every Sunday beginning August 22, 1948, were produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.

Toward the end of 1950, the executors of the estate of Thomas S. Lee (the son of Don Lee, who had died in 1934) decided to liquidate the estate's interests in the broadcasting field. The Don Lee Broadcasting System, with its major station groups KHJ in Los Angeles and <a href="KFRC%20%28defunct%29">KFRC</a> in San Francisco and its shares in the Mutual Broadcasting System, was sold to General Tire (which already had a stake in Mutual via its Yankee Network holdings). Around the same time, Mutual acquired the television broadcast rights to the World Series and All-Star Game for the next six years. Mutual was likely reindulging in TV network dreams or was simply taking advantage of a long-standing business relationship; in either case, Mutual sold the broadcast rights to NBC in time for the following season's games at an enormous profit.

Early in 1952, General Tire purchased General Teleradio from R.H. Macy and Company. With the deal, General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations and the rights to the General Teleradio brand, under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division (Bamberger had previously sold its TV station in the nation's capital, WOIC, to CBS and the "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>"). Most importantly, WOR's founding shares in Mutual, when added to the Yankee and Don Lee holdings, gave General Tire majority control of the network. That same year, NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to "Queen for a Day" from Mutual. As a measure of the afternoon show's success, its audience at its new Los Angeles home, General Teleradio/Don Lee's <a href="KCAL-TV">KHJ-TV</a>, was triple that of the city's six other stations combined. Mutual might not have had a TV network, but it controlled one of the most profitable properties in the early history of commercial television.

Mutual was at this point the largest U.S. radio network in affiliate numbers, by far—it had 560, almost three times as many as its most powerful competitors, CBS (194) and NBC (191). In 1955, General Tire expanded its media holdings by acquiring <a href="RKO%20Pictures">RKO Pictures</a> from <a href="Howard%20Hughes">Howard Hughes</a>, only to close the movie studio a year and a half later (General Teleradio, initially renamed RKO Teleradio Pictures in 1956 after the acquisition, then RKO Teleradio in 1957, would soon be known as <a href="RKO%20General">RKO General</a> by 1958). General Tire also decided to spin off its holdings in Mutual and sell it as a programming service even as it retained the stations that had given it control. Indeed, in 1956, General purchased a governing interest in yet another Mutual shareholder, Western Ontario Broadcasting, and its station in Windsor, CKLW. In July 1957, General Tire sold Mutual to a group led by <a href="Armand%20Hammer">Dr. Armand Hammer</a>.

The network soon changed hands again: in September 1958, it was acquired by the Scranton Corporation. Scranton was under the control of the F.L. Jacobs Company, whose chairman, <a href="Alexander%20Guterma">Alexander Guterma</a>, envisioned a media empire uniting Mutual with another recent purchase, the <a href="Hal%20Roach">Hal Roach</a> movie studio. After being questioned by federal investigators in February 1959 about financial improprieties, Guterma stepped down. Mutual, by this point, was floundering. For some years it had been run by owners who were either uninterested (General Tire, Armand Hammer) or now, as a growing amount of evidence would show, criminal. Mutual was also confronted with the situation the entire radio industry was facing: major advertisers were abandoning radio for television. Commercial rates had been cut. Limited sponsorship packages had been introduced, in which an advertiser could back a show for an abbreviated period rather than an entire season—but there was no reversing the trend. The networks were left with the bills for an increasing number of nonsponsored programs, known in the industry as "sustaining" shows. The loss of mainstay advertisers was accompanied by what historian Ronald Garay describes as the "mass desertion of network radio talent, management and technicians for television ... [T]hese people were taking with them the programming that had popularized the radio networks."

Under its new chairman, <a href="Hal%20Roach%20Jr.">Hal Roach Jr.</a>, F.L. Jacobs put Mutual into <a href="Chapter%2011">Chapter 11</a> bankruptcy. In September 1959, Guterma, Roach, and Garland Culpepper, a Scranton Corp. vice president, were indicted for failing to register as "foreign agents"; they were charged with secretly accepting money from <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a> dictator <a href="Rafael%20Trujillo">Rafael Trujillo</a> that previous January in return for favorable coverage of the country and its government on Mutual news programs. It was never proven that Guterma, who was identified as the primary player on Mutual's side and pleaded no contest to the charge, actually fulfilled his part of the deal and arranged for slanted coverage. Nonetheless, the incident led to a reported 130 stations cutting their affiliation with Mutual. Whether precipitated by the scandal or not, among the stations cutting its ties with Mutual in 1959 was one of the network's two original flagships, WOR. Businessman Albert G. McCarthy, meanwhile, had taken over the network, arranging to settle its debts while seeking an owner interested in running it on an ongoing basis.

Before the Guterma fiasco, the network had maintained its reputation for running a strong news organization. As the conflict on the Korean peninsula began to heat up in mid-1950, Mutual started airing two special reports nightly on the situation, featuring the commentary of Major George Fielding Eliot, military analyst for CBS during World War II. By August, Mutual was represented by six correspondents in Korea, more than ABC or NBC. In June 1958, just a few months before the Scranton takeover, the network had launched a nightly 25-minute newscast, "The World Today", hosted by Westbrook Van Voorhis, famous as the voice of "<a href="The%20March%20of%20Time">The March of Time</a>". On occasion, Mutual's commentary programs made the news: On March 11, 1954, Fulton Lewis Jr. featured <a href="Joseph%20McCarthy">Senator Joseph McCarthy</a> as his guest, two days after the senator's ethics had been called into question on the CBS TV show "<a href="See%20It%20Now">See It Now</a>", hosted by <a href="Edward%20R.%20Murrow">Edward R. Murrow</a>. In his radio interview, McCarthy dismissed Murrow as "the extreme left-wing, bleeding-heart element of television."

By the end of the 1950s, Mutual had forsworn original dramatic programming. Early in the decade, however, it picked up the adventure series "<a href="Challenge%20of%20the%20Yukon">Challenge of the Yukon</a>", which had originated at Mutual cofounder WXYZ in 1938 after the station's departure from the network. The show, subsequently renamed "Sergeant Preston of the Yukon", ran on Mutual from January 1950 until its finale in June 1955. In 1950 as well, Mutual introduced radio listeners to adult science fiction with "<a href="2000%20Plus">2000 Plus</a>", which first aired on March 15, almost a month before the premiere of NBC's similarly themed "<a href="Dimension%20X%20%28radio%20program%29">Dimension X</a>". "The Shadow"'s long run finally ended in December 1954. In November 1957, Mutual aired the final episodes of its last two remaining half-hour original dramatic shows, "<a href="Counterspy%20%28radio%20series%29">Counterspy</a>" and "<a href="Gang%20Busters">Gang Busters</a>", both picked up from other networks earlier in the decade. It would be 1973 before Mutual would broadcast a new dramatic series. In 1955, the famous comedy team <a href="Bob%20and%20Ray">Bob and Ray</a> came over from NBC for a five-day-a-week afternoon show. Kate Smith returned in January 1958 for her final radio series, which ran until August. Sports began to occupy an increasing portion of Mutual's schedule: the network began regularly airing a Major League Baseball "Game of the Day," every day except Sunday. This expansion into daily sports programming would run well into the 1960s. While baseball's World Series and All-Star Game would go to rival NBC in 1957, Mutual secured exclusive national radio rights the following year to Notre Dame football, which would remain a cornerstone for the rest of the network's existence.

In the spring of 1960, the <a href="3M%20Company">3M Company</a> stepped in, purchasing Mutual and restoring much-needed stability to the operation. Despite the recent scandal, Mutual still had 443 affiliates, easily the most of any network. By this time, as historian Jim Cox describes, both Mutual and ABC "had largely wiped their slates clean of most of their network programming—save news and sporting events and a few long-running features". This would characterize Mutual's essential approach for the next three and a half decades, through a further series of ownership changes.

In July 1966, 3M sold the network to a privately held company, Mutual Industries, Inc., headed by John P. Fraim. Upon Mutual Industries's acquisition of Mutual, it was renamed to "Mutual Broadcasting Corporation". The following month, after the death of Mutual stalwart Fulton Lewis Jr., his son Fulton Lewis III took over his Monday-to-Friday, 7 p.m. slot. When <a href="Citadel%20Media">ABC Radio</a> "split" into four demographically targeted networks on January 1, 1968, Mutual unsuccessfully sued to block the move. Meanwhile, the network was undergoing some management instability, with frequent changes at the top: for example, Matthew J. Culligan was Mutual's president from October 1966 to June 1968. He was replaced by Robert R. Pauley, who came over from the ABC radio division, where he had served as president for nearly seven years. But Pauley only lasted a year, and resigned after clashes with the board over the need for cost-cutting, and other decisions with which he disagreed. His replacement was Victor C. Diehm, owner of several Mutual-affiliated radio stations and active on the Mutual Affiliates Advisory Council. But Diehm also did not remain in the position of Mutual's president for very long. Four years later, he was replaced by a new president, a former Miami radio executive named <a href="Twenty-One%20%28game%20show%29%23Aftermath">C. Edward Little</a>. Under Little, Mutual began its own niche programming services, taking advantage, like ABC, of the prevailing FCC requirement that all radio stations, of whatever primary format, regularly air news and public affairs (a responsibility that would be eliminated in the early 1980s).

In 1967, Ohio businessman Daniel H. Overmeyer looked to start his own TV network, and sought a merger with Mutual; the offer was quickly rebuffed, but three Mutual stockholders joined with eleven other investors to buy Overmyer's hookup and rename it the <a href="United%20Network">United Network</a>. The net (and its only offering, "The Las Vegas Show") folded after only a month on the air. On May 1, 1972, the network launched the <a href="Mutual%20Black%20Network">Mutual Black Network</a> (MBN) and the <a href="Mutual%20Spanish%20Network">Mutual Spanish Network</a> (Mutual Cadena Hispánica); each provided 100 five-minute-long news and sports capsules a week, along with other programming. While the Spanish-language service would last only six months, by 1974 MBN had 98 affiliates. It was eventually spun off and acquired by the Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation, leading to the creation of <a href="American%20Urban%20Radio%20Networks">American Urban Radio Networks</a>. Additional targeted services, such as the Mutual Southwest Network and <a href="Mutual%20Lifestyle%20Radio">Mutual Lifestyle Radio</a>, followed from Mutual.

In 1974, Mutual began using its distinctive "Mutualert" network cue tones, or "bee-doops" as they were frequently called. The Mutual "bee-doops" were heard at the beginning and end of Mutual newscasts, programs, and in and out of commercials and network identification breaks. The "bee-doops" were retained by <a href="Westwood%20One%20%281976%E2%80%932011%29">Westwood One</a> for several years after it dissolved Mutual in 1999.
On September 30, 1977, <a href="Amway">Amway</a> bought the network. Soon after the purchase, Mutual began developing what would become the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity. In 1979, Amway purchased <a href="WCFL%20%28AM%29">WCFL</a> from the <a href="Chicago%20Federation%20of%20Labor">Chicago Federation of Labor</a>. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year—950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS. It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.

One of the few primary network programs outside of news and sports that Mutual initiated during this era became one of the most successful in its history: the first nationwide, all-night call-in radio program, which launched on November 3, 1975, with <a href="Herb%20Jepko">Herb Jepko</a> as host. Jepko, who had run a telephone talk show out of <a href="KSL%20%28AM%29">KSL</a> in Salt Lake City for years, so determinedly avoided controversial topics, that some callers simply talked about the weather where they lived. Jepko was briefly succeeded by <a href="Long%20John%20Nebel">Long John Nebel</a> and <a href="Candy%20Jones">Candy Jones</a>, before Mutual tapped a little-known local talk show host at WIOD in Miami. On January 30, 1978, <a href="Larry%20King">Larry King</a> made his national debut on Mutual; by early 1980, King's all-night show was being carried by around 200 stations and was credited with attracting many new affiliates to the network. King continued his Mutual call-in program until 1994, even long after he began appearing on a highly successful program for <a href="CNN">CNN</a> television in 1985. From 1970 through 1977, Mutual was the national radio broadcaster for "<a href="Monday%20Night%20Football%23MNF%20on%20radio">Monday Night Football</a>".

During the 1970s the network carried a daily 5-minute show "This is Liberty Lobby", which espoused far-right extremist views of the <a href="Liberty%20Lobby">Liberty Lobby</a>. At the conclusion of each episode, listeners were invited to get the organization's pamphlet "America First." Charges were made that Benjamin Gilbert, who was a principal owner of the network in the 1970s, had contributed thousands of dollars to the organization.

In 1980, Amway purchased <a href="WEPN%20%28AM%29%23WHN">WHN</a> in New York, giving Mutual a second major-market <a href="owned-and-operated%20station">owned-and-operated station</a>. "On a Country Road", a music show hosted by WHN's Lee Arnold, was introduced and given national distribution. At the beginning of the year, Mutual had begun broadcasting its final drama series, "Mutual Radio Theater", formerly "<a href="Sears%20Radio%20Theater">Sears Radio Theater</a>", which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as part of the anthology series. In 1981, Mutual launched "<a href="Dick%20Clark">Dick Clark</a>'s National Music Survey", a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of Mutual. The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. "Mutual Radio Theater", the network's last ever original dramatic series, aired its final new episode on December 19, 1981. In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL to Statewide Broadcasting. A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to <a href="Doubleday%20%28publisher%29">Doubleday Broadcasting</a>.

In 1985, <a href="Westwood%20One%20%281976%E2%80%932011%29">Westwood One</a>, a major radio production company and <a href="radio%20syndication">syndicator</a>—that is, a budding network—was looking to expand its operations. Westwood and Mutual were a good match: The demographics of Mutual affiliates tended to be adult; most of the stations that bought Westwood's programming, much of it in the pop music field, had substantially younger audiences. Mutual had the news operations that Westwood lacked. And there was Mutual's size; though down from its peak, it still commanded 810 affiliates, a strong second among the Big Four. In September 1985, Amway sold the network to Westwood One for $39 million. "It's a perfect fit," declared Westwood head Norman J. Pattiz. Referring to the united company's ability to give advertisers access to a broad demographic sweep, he called it "a classic case of two plus two equaling five." In 1987, the number got even bigger: Westwood One snapped up Mutual's long-time competitor, the <a href="NBC%23Defining%20radio%27s%20golden%20age">NBC Radio Network</a>, for $50 million. Mutual was now part of a much larger programming service, and its identity was being gradually phased out. In 1993, when Larry King switched his all-night radio show to a shorter daytime version a year before giving it up, the late-night call-in slot went to WCFL alumnus <a href="Jim%20Bohannon">Jim Bohannon</a>; within a few years, it was a Westwood One–branded show. Westwood One was itself taken over by <a href="CBS%20Radio">Infinity Broadcasting</a> in 1994. In a deal announced in June 1996 and completed that December, CBS's new parent company, <a href="Westinghouse%20Electric%20%281886%29">Westinghouse</a>, acquired Infinity for just shy of $5 billion. The direct descendants of the three original U.S. network companies had merged.

By this time, Mutual was little more than a brand name for certain news and sports programming provided by the new conglomerate's Westwood One division. Mutual and NBC Radio newscasters sat back to back in the Westwood One studio, the former main Mutual facility in <a href="Crystal%20City%2C%20Arlington%2C%20Virginia">Crystal City, Virginia</a>. In early 1999, Westwood One announced it was dropping the Mutual name in favor of CNN Radio, which it began distributing through a deal with <a href="Time%20Warner">Time Warner</a>'s <a href="Turner%20Broadcasting%20System">Turner Broadcasting System</a>. A former member of the Mutual news team described the end: "Official time of Mutual Radio's death was Midnight 4/17/99. No tribute, no mention it was the last newscast ... it just died." The Crystal City facility was closed in March 2001, and Westwood's primary operations were transferred to the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.

Some current programming on Westwood One, which is now owned by <a href="Cumulus%20Media">Cumulus Media</a>, can still trace its lineage directly to Mutual. Jim Bohannon remains on the air, hosting his interview/call-in show which is a direct descendant of Herb Jepko's 1975 launch on Mutual. Bohannon also hosted the morning news magazine, "America in the Morning", from its premiere on Mutual in 1984, until he retired from the show in December, 2015. The current incarnation of "<a href="Meet%20the%20Press">Meet the Press</a>", which launched on Mutual in 1945, has a simulcast on Westwood One. A simulcast of TV's "<a href="Larry%20King%20Live">Larry King Live</a>" continued to run until the end of 2009. "Country Countdown USA", founded as a Mutual program after the Westwood One purchase, continues to air in its original format as "<a href="CMT%20Country%20Countdown%20USA">CMT Country Countdown USA</a>".

The radio rights to <a href="Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football">Notre Dame Fighting Irish football</a> were eventually rebranded as a Westwood One product, years before the end of the Mutual network itself. At the conclusion of the 2007 football season, Notre Dame ended its relationship with Westwood One, citing financial reasons, and subsequently announced a deal with <a href="ISP%20Sports">ISP Sports</a>.

Mutual founding stations WOR and WLW are now both under the ownership of <a href="iHeartMedia">iHeartMedia</a>, who operates a network of their own, <a href="Premiere%20Networks">Premiere Networks</a>. WGN syndicates <a href="Orion%20Samuelson">Orion Samuelson</a> farm reports through its Tribune Radio Network, which also carried <a href="Chicago%20Cubs%20Radio%20Network">Chicago Cubs broadcasts</a> until 2014. WOR syndicated some weekend talk programs through the <a href="WOR%20Radio%20Network">WOR Radio Network</a>, and several WLW hosts have been syndicated through Premiere.

Mutual Broadcasting System LLC, based in <a href="Spokane%2C%20Washington">Spokane, Washington</a>, uses the Mutual and <a href="Liberty%20Broadcasting%20System">Liberty</a> names on its two stations, <a href="KTRW">KTRW</a>–Spokane and <a href="KTAC">KTAC</a>–<a href="Ephrata%2C%20Washington">Ephrata</a>. These stations have no connection with the original network. They present <a href="adult%20standards">adult standards</a>, nostalgia, and some Christian programming, using the Mutual name as part of their <a href="old-time%20radio">old-time radio</a> branding.

George I of Greece

George I (, "Geórgios I"; born Prince William of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg; ; 24 December 1845 – 18 March 1913) was <a href="List%20of%20kings%20of%20Greece">King</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Greece%20%28Gl%C3%BCcksburg%29">Greece</a> from 1863 until his assassination in 1913.

Originally a <a href="Danish%20monarchy">Danish prince</a>, George was born in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, and seemed destined for a career in the <a href="Royal%20Danish%20Navy">Royal Danish Navy</a>. He was only 17 years old when he was elected king by the <a href="Hellenic%20Parliament%23History">Greek National Assembly</a>, which had deposed the unpopular former king <a href="Otto%20of%20Greece">Otto</a>. His nomination was both suggested and supported by the <a href="Great%20Powers">Great Powers</a>: the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a>, the <a href="Second%20French%20Empire">Second French Empire</a> and the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>. He married the Russian grand duchess <a href="Olga%20Constantinovna%20of%20Russia">Olga Constantinovna of Russia</a>, and became the first monarch of a <a href="House%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl%C3%BCcksburg">new Greek dynasty</a>. Two of his sisters, <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Alexandra</a> and <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">Dagmar</a>, married into the British and Russian royal families. <a href="King%20Edward%20VII">King Edward VII</a> and <a href="Tsar%20Alexander%20III">Tsar Alexander III</a> were his brothers-in-law and <a href="King%20George%20V">King George V</a> and <a href="Tsar%20Nicholas%20II">Tsar Nicholas II</a> were his nephews.

George's reign of almost 50 years (the longest in <a href="modern%20Greek%20history">modern Greek history</a>) was characterized by territorial gains as <a href="Greece">Greece</a> established its place in pre-<a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> Europe. Britain ceded the <a href="Ionian%20Islands">Ionian Islands</a> peacefully, while <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> was annexed from the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> after the <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281877%E2%80%931878%29">Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)</a>. Greece was not always successful in its territorial ambitions; it was defeated in the <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281897%29">Greco-Turkish War (1897)</a>. During the <a href="First%20Balkan%20War">First Balkan War</a>, after Greek troops had captured much of <a href="Greek%20Macedonia">Greek Macedonia</a>, George was assassinated in <a href="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a>. Compared with his own long tenure, the reigns of his successors <a href="Constantine%20I%20of%20Greece">Constantine</a>, <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Greece">Alexander</a>, and <a href="George%20II%20of%20Greece">George II</a> proved short and insecure.

George was born at the <a href="Yellow%20Palace%2C%20Copenhagen">Yellow Palace</a>, an 18th-century town house at 18 Amaliegade, right next to the <a href="Amalienborg%20Palace">Amalienborg Palace</a> complex in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>. He was the second son and third child of <a href="Christian%20IX%20of%20Denmark">Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg</a> and <a href="Princess%20Louise%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel</a>. Until his accession in Greece, he was known as Prince William, the namesake of his grandfathers <a href="William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl%C3%BCcksburg">William, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg</a>, and <a href="Prince%20William%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">Prince William of Hesse-Kassel</a>.
Although he was of royal blood, his family was relatively obscure and lived a comparatively normal life by royal standards. In 1853, however, George's father was designated the <a href="heir%20presumptive">heir presumptive</a> to the childless King <a href="Frederick%20VII%20of%20Denmark">Frederick VII of Denmark</a>, and the family became princes and princesses of Denmark. George's siblings were <a href="Frederick%20VIII%20of%20Denmark">Frederick</a> (who succeeded their father as King of Denmark), <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Alexandra</a> (who became wife of <a href="King%20Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King Edward VII of the United Kingdom</a> and the mother of <a href="King%20George%20V">King George V</a>), <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">Dagmar</a> (who, as Empress Maria Feodorovna, was consort of <a href="Emperor%20Alexander%20III%20of%20Russia">Emperor Alexander III of Russia</a> and the mother of <a href="Emperor%20Nicholas%20II">Emperor Nicholas II</a>), <a href="Princess%20Thyra%20of%20Denmark">Thyra</a> (who married <a href="Ernest%20Augustus%2C%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Hanover">Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover</a>) and <a href="Prince%20Valdemar%20of%20Denmark">Valdemar</a>.

George's mother tongue was Danish, with English as a second language. He was also taught French and German. He embarked on a career in the <a href="Royal%20Danish%20Navy">Royal Danish Navy</a>, and enrolled as a naval cadet along with his elder brother Frederick. While Frederick was described as "quiet and extremely well-behaved", George was "lively and full of pranks".

Following the overthrow of the Bavarian-born <a href="King%20Otto%20of%20Greece">King Otto of Greece</a> in October 1862, the Greek people had rejected Otto's brother and designated successor <a href="Luitpold%2C%20Prince%20Regent%20of%20Bavaria">Luitpold</a>, although they still favored a monarchy rather than a republic. Many Greeks, seeking closer ties to the pre-eminent world power, <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Great Britain</a>, rallied around <a href="Prince%20Alfred%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh</a>, second son of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a>. British prime minister <a href="Henry%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a> believed that the Greeks were "panting for increase in territory", hoping for a gift of the <a href="Ionian%20Islands">Ionian Islands</a>, which were then a <a href="United%20States%20of%20the%20Ionian%20Islands">British protectorate</a>. The <a href="London%20Conference%20of%201832">London Conference of 1832</a>, however, prohibited any of the Great Powers' ruling families from accepting the crown, and in any event, Queen Victoria was adamantly opposed to the idea. The Greeks nevertheless insisted on holding <a href="Greek%20head%20of%20state%20referendum%2C%201862">a plebiscite</a> in which Prince Alfred received over 95% of the 240,000 votes. There were 93 votes for a Republic and 6 for a Greek. King Otto received one vote.

With Prince Alfred's exclusion, the search began for an alternative candidate. The French favored <a href="Henri%20d%27Orl%C3%A9ans%2C%20duc%20d%27Aumale">Henri d'Orléans, duc d'Aumale</a>, while the British proposed Queen Victoria's brother-in-law <a href="Ernest%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</a>, her nephew <a href="Ernst%20Leopold%2C%204th%20Prince%20of%20Leiningen">Prince Leiningen</a>, and <a href="Maximilian%20I%20of%20Mexico">Archduke Maximilian of Austria</a>, among others. Eventually, the Greeks and Great Powers winnowed their choice to Prince William of Denmark, who had received 6 votes in the plebiscite. Aged only 17, he was elected King of the Hellenes on by the Greek National Assembly under the regnal name of George I. Paradoxically, he ascended a royal throne before his father, who became King of Denmark on 15 November the same year. There were two significant differences between George's elevation and that of his predecessor, Otto. First, he was acclaimed unanimously by the Greek Assembly, rather than imposed on the people by foreign powers. Second, he was proclaimed "King of the Hellenes" instead of "King of Greece", which had been Otto's style.

His ceremonial enthronement in Copenhagen on 6 June was attended by a delegation of Greeks led by First Admiral and Prime Minister <a href="Constantine%20Kanaris">Constantine Kanaris</a>. Frederick VII awarded George the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Elephant">Order of the Elephant</a>, and it was announced that the British government would cede the Ionian Islands to Greece in honor of the new monarch.

The new 17-year-old king toured Saint Petersburg, London and Paris before departing for Greece from the French port of <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a> on 22 October aboard the Greek flagship "Hellas". He arrived in <a href="Athens">Athens</a> on , after docking at <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> the previous day. He was determined not to make the mistakes of his predecessor, so he quickly learned <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>. The new king was seen frequently and informally in the streets of Athens, where his predecessor had only appeared in pomp. King George found the palace in a state of disarray, after the hasty departure of King Otto, and took to putting it right by mending and updating <a href="Old%20Royal%20Palace">the 40-year-old building</a>. He also sought to ensure that he was not seen as too influenced by his Danish advisers, ultimately sending his uncle, <a href="Prince%20Julius%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl%C3%BCcksburg">Prince Julius</a>, back to Denmark with the words, "I will not allow any interference with the conduct of my government". Another adviser, Count <a href="Wilhelm%20Sponneck">Wilhelm Sponneck</a>, became unpopular for advocating a policy of disarmament and tactlessly questioning the descent of modern Greeks from classical antecedents. Like Julius, he was dispatched back to Denmark.

From May 1864, George undertook a tour of the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>, through <a href="Corinth">Corinth</a>, <a href="Argos">Argos</a>, <a href="Tripolitsa">Tripolitsa</a>, <a href="Sparta%20%28modern%29">Sparta</a>, and <a href="Kalamata">Kalamata</a>, where he embarked on the frigate "Hellas". Proceeding northwards along the coast accompanied by British, French and Russian naval vessels, the "Hellas" reached <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a> on 6 June, for the ceremonial handover of the Ionian Islands by the British <a href="List%20of%20Lord%20High%20Commissioners%20of%20the%20Ionian%20Islands">High Commissioner</a>, Sir <a href="Henry%20Storks">Henry Storks</a>.

Politically, the new king took steps to conclude the protracted constitutional deliberations of the Assembly. On 19 October 1864, he sent the Assembly a demand, countersigned by <a href="Constantine%20Kanaris">Constantine Kanaris</a>, explaining that he had accepted the crown on the understanding that a new constitution would be finalized, and that if it was not he would feel himself at "perfect liberty to adopt such measures as the disappointment of my hopes may suggest". It was unclear from the wording whether he meant to return to Denmark or impose a constitution, but as either event was undesirable the Assembly soon came to an agreement.

On 28 November 1864, he took the oath to defend the new <a href="Greek%20Constitution%20of%201864">constitution</a>, which created a unicameral assembly ("Vouli") with representatives elected by direct, secret, <a href="universal%20male%20suffrage">universal male suffrage</a>, a first in modern Europe. A <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> was set up with George deferring to the legitimate authority of the elected officials, although he was aware of the corruption present in elections and the difficulty of ruling a mostly illiterate population. Between 1864 and 1910, there were 21 general elections and 70 different governments.

Internationally, George maintained a strong relationship with his brother-in-law, the Prince of Wales (eventually King Edward VII of the United Kingdom), and sought his help in defusing the recurring and contentious issue of <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, an overwhelmingly Greek island that remained under <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Turk</a> control. Since the reign of Otto, the Greek desire to unite Greek lands in one nation had been a sore spot with the United Kingdom and France, which had embarrassed Otto by occupying the main Greek port <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> to dissuade Greek <a href="irredentism">irredentism</a> during the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>. During the <a href="Cretan%20Revolt%20%281866%E2%80%931869%29">Cretan Revolt (1866–1869)</a>, the Prince of Wales sought the support of British Foreign Secretary <a href="Edward%20Stanley%2C%2015th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Lord Derby</a> to intervene in Crete on behalf of Greece. Ultimately, the Great Powers did not intervene and the Ottomans put down the rebellion.

George first met <a href="Olga%20Constantinovna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia</a> in 1863, when she was 12 years old, on a visit to the court of <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Tsar Alexander II</a> between his election to the Greek throne and his arrival in Athens. They met for a second time in April 1867, when George went to the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> to visit his sister <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">Dagmar</a>, who had married into the Russian imperial family. While George was privately a <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a>, the <a href="House%20of%20Romanov">Romanovs</a> were <a href="Orthodox%20Christians">Orthodox Christians</a> like the majority of Greeks, and George thought a marriage with a Russian grand duchess would re-assure his subjects on the question of his future children's religion. Olga was just 16 years old when she married George at the <a href="Winter%20Palace">Winter Palace</a> in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> on 27 October 1867. After a honeymoon at <a href="Tsarskoye%20Selo">Tsarskoye Selo</a>, the couple left Russia for Greece on 9 November. Over the next twenty years, they had eight children:


As a marriage gift, the Tsar gave George a group of islands in the <a href="Petalioi%20Gulf">Petalioi Gulf</a>, which the family visited on the royal yacht "Amphitrite". George later purchased a country estate, <a href="Tatoi">Tatoi</a>, north of Athens, and on <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a> he built a summer villa called <a href="Mon%20Repos%2C%20Corfu">Mon Repos</a>. George developed Tatoi, building roads and planting grapes for making his own wine, Chateau Décélie. Intent on not letting his subjects know that he missed Denmark, he discreetly maintained a dairy at his palace at Tatoi, which was managed by native Danes and served as a bucolic reminder of his homeland. Queen Olga was far less careful in hiding her nostalgia for her native Russia, often visiting Russian ships at <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> two or three times before they weighed anchor. When alone with his wife, George usually conversed in German. Their children were taught English by their nannies, and when talking with his children he therefore spoke mainly English.

The King was related by marriage to the rulers of Great Britain, Russia and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a>, maintaining a particularly strong attachment to the Prince and Princess of Wales, who visited Athens in 1869. Their visit occurred despite continued lawlessness which culminated in the kidnap of a party of British and Italian tourists, including <a href="Josslyn%20Pennington%2C%205th%20Baron%20Muncaster">Lord and Lady Muncaster</a>. Two female hostages, a child and Lord Muncaster were released, but four of the others were murdered: British diplomat E. H. C. Herbert (the <a href="first%20cousin">first cousin</a> of <a href="Henry%20Herbert%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Carnarvon">Lord Carnarvon</a>), Frederick Vyner (the brother-in-law of <a href="George%20Robinson%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Ripon">Lord Ripon</a>, <a href="Lord%20President%20of%20the%20Council">Lord President of the Council</a>), Italian diplomat Count Boyl di Putifigari, and Mr. Lloyd (an engineer). George's relationships with other ruling houses assisted him and his small country but also often put them at the center of national political struggles in Europe.

From 1864 to 1874, Greece had 21 governments, the longest of which lasted a year and a half. In July 1874, <a href="Charilaos%20Trikoupis">Charilaos Trikoupis</a>, a member of the Greek Parliament, wrote an anonymous article in the newspaper "Kairoi" blaming King George and his advisors for the continuing political crisis caused by the lack of stable governments. In the article, he accused the King of acting like an <a href="Absolute%20monarchy">absolute monarch</a> by imposing <a href="minority%20government">minority government</a>s on the people. If the King insisted, he argued, that only a politician commanding a majority in the "Vouli" could be appointed prime minister, then politicians would be forced to work together more harmoniously in order to construct a coalition government. Such a plan, he wrote, would end the political instability and reduce the large number of smaller parties. Trikoupis admitted to writing the article after a man supposed by the authorities to be the author was arrested, whereupon he was taken into custody himself. After a public outcry, he was released and subsequently acquitted of the charge of "undermining the constitutional order". The following year, the King asked Trikoupis to form a government (without a majority) and then read a speech from the throne declaring that in future the leader of the majority party in parliament would be appointed prime minister.

Throughout the 1870s, Greece kept pressure on the Ottoman Empire, seeking territorial expansion into <a href="Epirus">Epirus</a> and <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>. The <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281877%E2%80%931878%29">Russo-Turkish War</a> of 1877–1878 provided the first potential alliance for the Greek kingdom. George's sister <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">Dagmar</a> was the daughter-in-law of <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II of Russia</a>, and she sought to have Greece join the war. The French and British refused to countenance such an act, and Greece remained neutral. At the <a href="Congress%20of%20Berlin">Congress of Berlin</a> convened in 1878 to determine peace terms for the Russo-Turkish War, Greece staked a claim to Crete, Epirus and Thessaly.

The borders were still not finalized in June 1880 when a proposal very favorable to Greece that included <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a> and <a href="Ioannina">Ioannina</a> was offered by the British and French. When the Ottoman Turks strenuously objected, Prime Minister Trikoupis made the mistake of threatening a mobilization of the <a href="Hellenic%20Army">Hellenic Army</a>. A coincident change of government in France, the resignation of <a href="Charles%20de%20Freycinet">Charles de Freycinet</a> and his replacement with <a href="Jules%20Ferry">Jules Ferry</a>, led to disputes among the Great Powers and, despite British support for a more pro-Greek settlement, the Turks subsequently granted Greece all of Thessaly but only the part of Epirus around <a href="Arta%2C%20Greece">Arta</a>. When the government of Trikoupis fell, the new prime minister, <a href="Alexandros%20Koumoundouros">Alexandros Koumoundouros</a>, reluctantly accepted the new boundaries.
While Trikoupis followed a policy of retrenchment within the established borders of the Greek state, having learned a valuable lesson about the vicissitudes of the Great Powers, his main opponents, the <a href="Nationalist%20Party%20%28Greece%29">Nationalist Party</a> led by <a href="Theodoros%20Deligiannis">Theodoros Deligiannis</a>, sought to inflame the anti-Turkish feelings of the Greeks at every opportunity. The next opportunity arose in 1885 when <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>ns rose in revolt in <a href="Eastern%20Rumelia">Eastern Rumelia</a> and united the province with Bulgaria. Deligiannis rode to victory over Trikoupis in elections that year saying that if the Bulgarians could defy the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Berlin%20%281878%29">Treaty of Berlin</a>, so should the Greeks.

Deligiannis mobilized the <a href="Hellenic%20Army">Hellenic Army</a>, and the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> blockaded Greece. The admiral in charge of the blockade was <a href="Alfred%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh</a>, who had been the first choice of the Greeks to be their king in 1863, and the <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> at the time was <a href="George%20Robinson%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Ripon">Lord Ripon</a>, whose brother-in-law had been murdered in Greece 16 years before. This was not the last time that King George discovered that his family ties were not always to his advantage. Deligiannis was forced to demobilize and Trikoupis regained the premiership. Between 1882 and 1897, Trikoupis and Deligiannis alternated the premiership as their fortunes rose and fell.

George's silver jubilee in 1888 was celebrated throughout the Hellenic world, and Athens was decorated with garlands for the anniversary of his accession on 30 October. Visitors included the <a href="Frederick%20VIII%20of%20Denmark">Crown Prince of Denmark</a>, the <a href="Edward%20VII">Prince</a> and <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Princess of Wales</a>, the Duke and <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Maria%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Duchess of Edinburgh</a>, Grand Dukes <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Sergei%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">Sergei</a> and <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Paul%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">Paul of Russia</a>, and <a href="Ahmed%20Cevad%20Pasha">Djevad Pasha</a> from the Ottoman Empire, who presented the King with two <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian horse</a>s as gifts. Jubilee events in the week of 30 October included balls, galas, parades, a thanksgiving service at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Cathedral%20of%20Athens">Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens</a>, and a lunch for 500 invited guests in a blue and white tent on the <a href="Acropolis%20of%20Athens">Acropolis</a>.

Greece in the last decades of the 19th century was increasingly prosperous and was developing a sense of its role on the European stage. In 1893, the <a href="Corinth%20Canal">Corinth Canal</a> was built by a French company cutting the sea journey from the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> to <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> by . In 1896, the <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a> were revived in Athens, and the Opening Ceremony of the <a href="1896%20Summer%20Olympics">1896 Summer Olympics</a> was presided over by the King. When <a href="Spiridon%20Louis">Spiridon Louis</a>, a shepherd from just outside Athens, ran into the <a href="Panathinaiko%20Stadium">Panathinaiko Stadium</a> to win the <a href="Marathon">Marathon</a> event, the Crown Prince ran down onto the field to run the last thousand yards beside the Greek gold medalist, while the King stood and applauded.

The popular desire to unite all Greeks within a single territory ("<a href="Megali%20Idea">Megali Idea</a>") was never far below the surface and another revolt against Turkish rule erupted in Crete. In February 1897, King George sent his son, <a href="Prince%20George%20of%20Greece">Prince George</a>, to take possession of the island. The Greeks refused an Ottoman offer of an autonomous administration, and Deligiannis mobilized for war. The Great Powers refused to allow the expansion of Greece, and on 25 February 1897 announced that Crete would be under an autonomous administration and ordered the Greek and Ottoman Turk militias to withdraw.

The Turks agreed, but Prime Minister Deligiannis refused and dispatched 1400 troops to Crete under the command of Colonel <a href="Timoleon%20Vassos">Timoleon Vassos</a>. While the Great Powers announced a blockade, Greek troops crossed the Macedonian border and <a href="Abdul%20Hamid%20II">Abdul Hamid II</a> declared <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281897%29">war</a>. The announcement that Greece was finally at war with the Turks was greeted by delirious displays of patriotism and spontaneous parades in honor of the King in Athens. Volunteers by the thousands streamed north to join the forces under the command of Crown Prince Constantine.

The war went badly for the ill-prepared Greeks; the only saving grace was the swiftness with which the Hellenic Army was overrun. By the end of April 1897, the war was lost. The worst consequences of defeat for the Greeks were mitigated by the intervention of the King's relations in Britain and Russia; nevertheless, the Greeks were forced to give up Crete to international administration, and agree to minor territorial concessions in favor of the Turks and an indemnity of 4 million Turkish pounds.

The jubilation with which Greeks had hailed their king at the beginning of the war was reversed in defeat. For a time, he considered abdication. It was not until the King faced down an assassination attempt on 27 February 1898 with great bravery that his subjects again held their monarch in high esteem. Returning from a trip to the beach at <a href="Phaleron">Phaleron</a> in an open carriage, George and his daughter <a href="Princess%20Maria%20of%20Greece%20and%20Denmark">Maria</a> were shot at by two riflemen. The King tried to shield his daughter; both were unhurt though the coachman and a horse were wounded. The gunmen (an Athens clerk called Karditzis and his assistant) fled into the <a href="Hymettus">Hymettus</a> hills but they were spotted and arrested. Both were beheaded at <a href="Nauplia">Nauplia</a>.

Later that year, after continued unrest in Crete, which included the murder of the British vice-consul, Prince George of Greece was made the Governor-General of Crete under the suzerainty of the Sultan, after the proposal was put forward by the Great Powers. Greece was effectively in day-to-day control of Crete for the first time in modern history.

The death of Britain's <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> on 22 January 1901 left King George as the second-longest-reigning monarch in Europe. His always cordial relations with his brother-in-law, the new <a href="Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King Edward VII</a>, continued to tie Greece to Britain. This was abundantly important in Britain's support of King George's son <a href="Prince%20George%20of%20Greece%20and%20Denmark">Prince George</a> as <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Crete">Governor-General of Crete</a>. Nevertheless, Prince George resigned in 1906 after a leader in the Cretan Assembly, <a href="Eleftherios%20Venizelos">Eleftherios Venizelos</a>, campaigned to have him removed.

As a response to the <a href="Young%20Turk%20Revolution">Young Turk Revolution</a> of 1908, Venizelos's power base was further strengthened, and on 8 October 1908 the Cretan Assembly passed a resolution in favor of union despite both the reservations of the Athens government under <a href="Georgios%20Theotokis">Georgios Theotokis</a> and the objections of the Great Powers. The muted reaction of the Athens Government to the news from Crete led to an unsettled state of affairs on the mainland.

In August 1909, a group of army officers that had formed a military league, "<a href="Stratiotikos%20Syndesmos">Stratiotikos Syndesmos</a>", demanded, among other things, that the royal family be stripped of their military commissions. To save the King the embarrassment of removing his sons from their commissions, they resigned them. The military league attempted a <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>, and the King insisted on supporting the duly elected <a href="Hellenic%20Parliament">Hellenic Parliament</a> in response. Eventually, the military league joined forces with Venizelos in calling for a National Assembly to revise the constitution. King George gave way, and <a href="Greek%20legislative%20election%2C%20August%201910">new elections</a> to the revising assembly were held in August 1910. After some political maneuvering, Venizelos became prime minister of a minority government. Just a month later, Venizelos called <a href="Greek%20legislative%20election%2C%20November%201910">new elections</a> for , at which he won an overwhelming majority after most of the opposition parties declined to take part.

Venizelos and the King were united in their belief that the nation required a strong army to repair the damage of the humiliating <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281897%29">defeat of 1897</a>. Crown Prince Constantine was reinstated as Inspector-General of the Army, and later Commander-in-Chief. Under his and Venizelos's close supervision the military was retrained and equipped with French and British help, and new ships <a href="Hellenic%20Navy%23Growth%20of%20the%20Navy%20under%20King%20George">were ordered</a> for the <a href="Hellenic%20Navy">Hellenic Navy</a>. Meanwhile, through diplomatic means, Venizelos had united the Christian countries of the Balkans in opposition to the ailing Ottoman Empire.

When the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Montenegro">Kingdom of Montenegro</a> declared war on Turkey on 8 October 1912, it was joined quickly by <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Serbia</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, and Greece in what is known as the <a href="First%20Balkan%20War">First Balkan War</a>. George was on vacation in Denmark, so he immediately returned to Greece via Vienna, arriving in Athens to be met by a large and enthusiastic crowd on the evening of 9 October. The results of this campaign differed radically from the Greek experience at the hands of the Turks in 1897. The well-trained Greek forces, 200,000 strong, won victory after victory. On 9 November 1912, Greek forces commanded by Crown Prince Constantine rode into <a href="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a>, just a few hours ahead of a Bulgarian division. Three days later King George rode in triumph through the streets of Thessaloniki, the second-largest Greek city, accompanied by the Crown Prince and Venizelos.

As he approached the fiftieth anniversary of his accession, the King made plans to abdicate in favor of his son Constantine immediately after the celebration of his <a href="golden%20jubilee">golden jubilee</a> in October 1913. Just as he did in Athens, George went about Thessaloniki without any meaningful protection force. While out on an afternoon walk near the <a href="White%20Tower%20of%20Thessaloniki">White Tower</a> on 18 March 1913, he was shot at close range in the back by <a href="Alexandros%20Schinas">Alexandros Schinas</a>, who was "said to belong to a Socialist organization" and "declared when arrested that he had killed the King because he refused to give him money". George died instantly, the bullet having penetrated his heart. The Greek government denied any political motive for the assassination, saying that Schinas was an alcoholic vagrant. Schinas was tortured in prison and six weeks later fell to his death from a police station window.

The King's body was taken to Athens on the "Amphitrite", escorted by a flotilla of naval vessels. For three days the coffin of the King, draped in the <a href="Flag%20of%20Denmark">Danish</a> and <a href="Flag%20of%20Greece">Greek flags</a>, lay in the <a href="Metropolitan%20Cathedral%20of%20Athens">Metropolitan Cathedral</a> in Athens before his body was committed to a tomb at his palace in <a href="Tatoi">Tatoi</a>.


The distinctive Greek flag of blue and white cross was first hoisted during the <a href="Greek%20War%20of%20Independence">Greek War of Independence</a> in March 1822. This was later modified so that the shade of blue matched that of the <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>n coat of arms of the first King of Greece, Otto. The shield is emblazoned with the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Denmark%23Royal%20coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> of the <a href="Danish%20Royal%20Family">Danish Royal Family</a>, and the supporters on either side are also adapted from the Danish royal arms. Beneath the shield is the <a href="motto">motto</a> in Greek, Ἰσχύς μου ἡ αγάπη τοῦ λαοῦ ("The people's love is my strength"). Beneath the motto dangles the Grand Cross of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Redeemer">Order of the Redeemer</a>, Greece's premier decoration of honor.

Vasa (ship)

Vasa (or Wasa) is a retired <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a> <a href="warship">warship</a> built between 1626 and 1628. The ship <a href="%3Awikt%3Afounder%23Verb">foundered</a> after sailing about 1,300 m (1,400 yd) into its <a href="maiden%20voyage">maiden voyage</a> on 10 August 1628. It fell into obscurity after most of her valuable <a href="bronze">bronze</a> <a href="cannon">cannon</a>s were salvaged in the 17th century until she was located again in the late 1950s in a busy shipping lane just outside the <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> harbor. Salvaged with a largely intact hull in 1961, it was housed in a temporary museum called Wasavarvet ('The Wasa Shipyard') until 1988 and then moved permanently to the <a href="Vasa%20Museum">Vasa Museum</a> in the <a href="Royal%20National%20City%20Park">Royal National City Park</a> in Stockholm. The ship is one of Sweden's most popular tourist attractions and has been seen by over 35 million visitors since 1961. Since her recovery, "Vasa" has become a widely recognised symbol of the Swedish '<a href="Swedish%20Empire">great power period</a>' and is today a "de facto" standard in the media and among Swedes for evaluating the historical importance of shipwrecks.

The ship was built on the orders of the King of Sweden <a href="Gustavus%20Adolphus%20of%20Sweden">Gustavus Adolphus</a> as part of the military expansion he initiated in a war with <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Poland-Lithuania</a> (1621–1629). It was constructed at the navy yard in Stockholm under a contract with private entrepreneurs in 1626–1627 and armed primarily with bronze cannons cast in Stockholm specifically for the ship. Richly decorated as a symbol of the king's ambitions for Sweden and himself, upon completion she was one of the most powerfully armed vessels in the world. However, "Vasa" was dangerously unstable and top-heavy with too much weight in the upper structure of the hull. Despite this lack of stability she was ordered to sea and foundered only a few minutes after encountering a wind stronger than a breeze.

The order to sail was the result of a combination of factors. The king, who was leading the army in Poland at the time of her maiden voyage, was impatient to see her take up her station as <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the reserve squadron at <a href="%C3%84lvsnabben">Älvsnabben</a> in the Stockholm Archipelago. At the same time the king's subordinates lacked the political courage to openly discuss the ship's problems or to have the maiden voyage postponed. An inquiry was organised by the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20Sweden">Swedish Privy Council</a> to find those responsible for the disaster, but in the end no one was punished.

During the 1961 recovery, thousands of artifacts and the remains of at least 15 people were found in and around the "Vasa"'s hull by <a href="Maritime%20archaeology">marine archaeologists</a>. Among the many items found were clothing, weapons, cannons, tools, coins, cutlery, food, drink and six of the ten sails. The artifacts and the ship herself have provided scholars with invaluable insights into details of naval warfare, shipbuilding techniques and everyday life in early 17th-century Sweden.

During the 17th century, Sweden went from being a sparsely populated, poor, and peripheral northern European kingdom of little influence to one of the <a href="Great%20power">major powers</a> in continental politics. Between 1611 and 1718 it was the dominant power in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a>, eventually gaining territory that encompassed the Baltic on all sides. This rise to prominence in international affairs and increase in military prowess, called "<a href="Swedish%20Empire">stormaktstiden</a>" ('age of greatness' or 'great power period'), was made possible by a succession of able monarchs and the establishment of a powerful centralised government, supporting a highly efficient military organization. Swedish historians have described this as one of the more extreme examples of an early modern state using almost all of its available resources to wage war; the small northern kingdom transformed itself into a <a href="fiscal-military%20state">fiscal-military state</a> and one of the most militarised states in history.

<a href="Gustavus%20Adolphus%20of%20Sweden">Gustavus Adolphus</a> (1594–1632) has been considered one of the most successful Swedish kings in terms of success in warfare. When "Vasa" was built, he had been in power for more than a decade. Sweden was embroiled in a <a href="Polish-Swedish%20War%20%281625%E2%80%931629%29">war with Poland-Lithuania</a>, and looked apprehensively at the development of the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a> in present-day Germany. The war had been raging since 1618 and from a <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> perspective it was not successful. The king's plans for a Polish campaign and for securing Sweden's interests required a strong naval presence in the Baltic.

The navy suffered several severe setbacks during the 1620s. In 1625, a squadron cruising in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Riga">Bay of Riga</a> was caught in a storm and ten ships ran aground and were wrecked. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Oliwa">Battle of Oliwa</a> in 1627, a Swedish squadron was outmaneuvered and defeated by a Polish force and two large ships were lost. "Tigern" ('The Tiger'), which was the Swedish admiral's flagship, was captured by the Poles, and "Solen" ('The Sun') was blown up by her own crew when she was boarded and near capture. In 1628, three more large ships were lost in less than a month; Admiral <a href="Clas%20Fleming%20%28admiral%29">Klas Fleming</a>'s flagship "Kristina" was wrecked in a storm in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Danzig">Gulf of Danzig</a>, "Riksnyckeln" ('Key of the Realm') ran aground at Viksten in the southern archipelago of Stockholm and "Vasa" foundered on her maiden voyage. Gustavus Adolphus was engaged in naval warfare on several fronts, which further exacerbated the difficulties of the navy. In addition to battling the Polish navy, the Swedes were indirectly threatened by Imperial forces that had invaded <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a>. The Swedish king had little sympathy for the Danish king, <a href="Christian%20IV%20of%20Denmark">Christian IV</a>, and Denmark and Sweden had been bitter enemies for well over a century. However, Sweden feared a Catholic conquest of <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> and <a href="Zealand%20%28Denmark%29">Zealand</a>. This would have granted the Catholic powers control over the strategic passages between the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> and the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, which would be disastrous for Swedish interests. As it turned out, the Imperial occupation of Denmark ended before Swedish intervention was necessary, and a squadron assigned to assist Denmark was retasked to help lift the Imperial siege of Stralsund.

Until the early 17th century, the Swedish navy was composed primarily of small to medium-sized ships with a single gundeck, normally armed with 12-pounder and smaller cannons; these ships were cheaper than larger ships and were well-suited for escort and patrol. They also suited the prevailing tactical thinking within the navy, which emphasised boarding as the decisive moment in a naval battle rather than gunnery. The king, who was a keen artillerist, saw the potential of ships as gun platforms, and large, heavily armed ships made a more dramatic statement in the political theater of naval power. Beginning with "Vasa", he ordered a series of ships with two full gundecks, outfitted with much heavier guns. Five such ships were built after "Vasa" ("Äpplet", "Kronan", "Scepter" and "Göta Ark") before the Privy Council cancelled the orders for the others after the king's death in 1632. These ships, especially "Kronan" and "Scepter", were much more successful and served as flagships in the Swedish navy until the 1660s. The second of the so-called "regalskepp" (usually translated as 'royal ships'), "Äpplet" ('The Apple'; the Swedish term for the <a href="globus%20cruciger">globus cruciger</a>), was built simultaneously with "Vasa". The only significant difference between the design of "Vasa" and her sister ship was an increase in width of about a metre (3.1 ft).

In the early 1620s, work at the Stockholm navy yard was led by a pair of Dutch-born entrepreneurs, Antonius Monier and master shipwright <a href="Henrik%20Hybertsson">Henrik Hybertsson</a>, who was usually referred to as 'Master Henrik'. When a new contract for operation of the navy yard was negotiated in the winter of 1624–1625, Monier withdrew and Master Henrik took on a young merchant from Amsterdam, Arendt de Groote, as partner. On 16 January 1625, Henrik and Arendt signed a contract to build four ships, two larger with a <a href="keel">keel</a> length of 128 feet (38 m) and two smaller, with dimensions to match the earlier ship "Gustavus".

Master Henrik and Arendt de Groote began buying the raw materials needed for the first ships in 1625, purchasing timber from individual estates in Sweden as well as buying rough-sawn planking in <a href="Riga">Riga</a>, Königsberg (modern <a href="Kaliningrad">Kaliningrad</a>), and <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>. As they prepared to begin the first of the new ships in the autumn of 1625, Henrik corresponded with the king through the Vice Admiral Fleming about which ship to build first. The loss of ten ships in the Bay of Riga led the king to propose building two ships of a new, medium size as a quick compromise, and he sent a specification for this, a ship which would be 120 feet (35.6 m) long on the keel. Henrik declined, since he had already cut the timber for a large and a small ship. He laid the keel for a larger ship in late February or early March 1626. Master Henrik never saw Vasa completed; he fell ill in late 1625, and by the summer of 1626 he had handed over supervision of the work in the yard to another Dutch shipwright, Henrik 'Hein' Jacobsson. He died in the spring of 1627, probably about the same time as the ship was launched. After the death of Henrik Hybertsson, the responsibility to manage the construct the ship was inherited by his widow <a href="Margareta%20Hybertsson">Margareta Hybertsson</a>.

After launching, work continued on finishing the upper deck, the sterncastle, the <a href="beakhead">beakhead</a> and the rigging. Sweden had still not developed a sizeable sailcloth industry, and material had to be ordered from abroad. In the contract for the maintenance of rigging, French sailcloth was specified, but the cloth for the sails of "Vasa" most likely came from Holland. The sails were made mostly of <a href="hemp">hemp</a> and partly of <a href="flax">flax</a>. The rigging was made entirely of hemp imported from <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a> through Riga. The king visited the shipyard in January 1628 and made what was probably his only visit aboard the ship.

In the summer of 1628, the captain responsible for supervising construction of the ship, Söfring Hansson, arranged for the ship's stability to be demonstrated for the Vice Admiral responsible for procurement, Klas Fleming, who had recently arrived in Stockholm from Prussia. Thirty men ran back and forth across the upper deck to start the ship rolling, but the admiral stopped the test after they had made only three trips, as he feared the ship would capsize. According to testimony by the ship's master, Göran Mattson, Fleming remarked that he wished the king were at home. Gustavus Adolphus had been sending a steady stream of letters insisting that the ship put to sea as soon as possible.

There has been much speculation about whether "Vasa" was lengthened during construction and whether an additional gun deck was added late during the build. Little evidence suggests that "Vasa" was substantially modified after the keel was laid. Ships contemporary to "Vasa" that were elongated were cut in half and new timbers spliced between the existing sections, making the addition readily identifiable, but no such addition can be identified in the hull, nor is there any evidence for any late additions of a second gundeck. The king ordered 72 24-pound cannons for the ship on 5 August 1626, and this was too many to fit on a single gun deck. Since the king's order was issued less than five months after construction started, it would have come early enough for the second deck to be included in the design. The French "Galion du Guise", the ship used as a model for "Vasa", according to Arendt de Groote, also had two gun decks. <a href="3D%20scanner">Laser measurements</a> of "Vasa's" structure conducted in 2007–2011 confirmed that no major changes were implemented during construction, but that the centre of gravity was too high.

"Vasa" was an early example of a warship with two full gun decks, and was built when the theoretical principles of shipbuilding were still poorly understood. There is no evidence that Henrik Hybertsson had ever built a ship like it before, and two gundecks is a much more complicated compromise in seaworthiness and firepower than a single gundeck. Safety margins at the time were also far below anything that would be acceptable today. Combined with the fact that 17th-century warships were built with intentionally high superstructures (to be used as firing platforms), this made "Vasa" a risky undertaking.

"Vasa" was built during a time of transition in naval tactics, from an era when boarding was still one of the primary ways of fighting enemy ships to an era of the strictly organised <a href="ship-of-the-line">ship-of-the-line</a> and a focus on victory through superior gunnery. "Vasa" was armed with powerful guns and built with a high stern, which would act as a firing platform in boarding actions for some of the 300 soldiers she was supposed to carry, but the high-sided hull and narrow upper deck were not optimised for boarding. She was neither the largest ship ever built, nor the one carrying the greatest number of guns. What made her arguably the most powerful warship of the time was the combined weight of shot that could be fired from the cannon of one side: 588 pounds (267 kg), excluding "stormstycken", guns used for firing anti-personnel ammunition instead of solid shot. This was the largest concentration of artillery in a single warship in the Baltic at the time, perhaps in all of northern Europe, and it was not until the 1630s that a ship with more firepower was built. This large amount of naval artillery was placed on a ship that was quite small relative to the armament carried. By comparison, "<a href="USS%20Constitution">USS Constitution</a>", a famous Napoleonic era frigate built 169 years after "Vasa", had roughly the same firepower, but was over 700 <a href="tonnes">tonnes</a> heavier.

The "Constitution", however, belonged to a later era of naval warfare that employed the <a href="line%20of%20battle">line of battle</a>-tactic, where ships fought in single file (or "line ahead") while the group as a whole attempted to present the batteries of one side toward the enemy. The guns would be aimed in the same direction and fire could be concentrated on a single target. In the 17th century, tactics involving organised formations of large fleets had still not been developed. Rather, ships would fight individually or in small improvised groups, and focused on boarding. "Vasa", though possessing a formidable battery, was built with these tactics in mind, and therefore lacked a unified <a href="broadside">broadside</a> with guns that were all aimed in roughly the same direction. Rather, the guns were intended to be fired independently and were arranged according to the curvature of the hull, meaning that the ship would be bristled with artillery in all directions, covering virtually all angles.

Naval gunnery in the 17th century was still in its infancy. Guns were expensive and had a much longer lifespan than any warship. Guns with a lifetime of over a century were not unheard of, while most warships would be used for only 15 to 20 years. In Sweden and many other European countries, a ship would normally not 'own' its guns, but would be issued armament from the armory for every campaign season. Ships were therefore usually fitted with guns of very diverse age and size. What allowed "Vasa" to carry so much firepower was not merely that an unusually large number of guns were crammed into a relatively small ship, but also that the 46 main 24-pounder guns were of a new and standardised lightweight design, cast in a single series at the state gun foundry in Stockholm, under the direction of the Swiss-born founder Medardus Gessus. Two additional 24-pounders, of a heavier and older design, were mounted in the bows, the so-called "<a href="Chase%20gun">bow chasers</a>". Four more heavy guns were intended for the stern, but the cannon foundry could not cast guns as fast as the navy yard could build ships, and "Vasa" waited nearly a year after construction was finished for its armament. When the ship sailed in August 1628, eight of the planned armament of 72 guns had still not been delivered. All cannons during this time had to be made from individually made moulds that could not be reused, but "Vasa's" guns had such uniform precision in their manufacturing that their primary dimensions varied by only a few millimetres, and their bores were almost exactly 146 mm (5.7 in). The remaining armament of "Vasa" consisted of eight 3-pounders, six large caliber "stormstycken" (similar to what the English called <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a>s) for use during boarding actions, and two 1-pound <a href="falconet%20%28cannon%29">falconets</a>. Also included on board were 894 kilograms (1,970 lb) of <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a> and over 1,000 shot of various types for the guns.

As was the custom with warships at the time, "Vasa" was decorated with sculptures intended to glorify the authority, wisdom and martial prowess of the monarch and also to deride, taunt and intimidate the enemy. The sculptures made up a considerable part of the effort and cost of building the ship. The symbolism used in decorating the ship was mostly based on the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> idealization of Roman and Greek antiquity, which had been imported from Italy through German and Dutch artists. Imagery borrowed from Mediterranean antiquity dominates the motifs, but also include figures from the Old Testament and even a few from <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>. Many of the figures are in Dutch <a href="grotesque">grotesque</a> style, depicting fantastic and frightening creatures, including mermaids, <a href="wild%20men">wild men</a>, sea monsters and <a href="Triton%20%28mythology%29">tritons</a>. The decoration inside the ship is much sparser and is largely confined to the steerage and the great cabin, at the after end of the upper gundeck.

Residues of paint have been found on many sculptures and on other parts of the ship. The entire ornamentation was once painted in vivid colors. The sides of the <a href="beakhead">beakhead</a> (the protruding structure below the <a href="bowsprit">bowsprit</a>), the bulwarks (the protective railing around the weather deck), the roofs of the <a href="quarter%20gallery">quarter galleries</a>, and the background of the <a href="Transom%20%28nautical%29">transom</a> (the flat surface at the stern of the ship) were all painted red, while the sculptures were decorated in bright colors, and the dazzling effect of these was in some places emphasised with <a href="gold%20leaf">gold leaf</a>. Previously, it was believed that the background color had been blue and that all sculptures had been almost entirely gilded, and this is reflected in many paintings of "Vasa" from the 1970s to the early 1990s, such as the lively and dramatic drawings of <a href="Bj%C3%B6rn%20Landstr%C3%B6m">Björn Landström</a> or the painting by Francis Smitheman. In the late 1990s, this view was revised and the colors are properly reflected in more recent reproductions of the ship's decoration by maritime painter <a href="Tim%20Thompson%20%28artist%29">Tim Thompson</a> and the 1:10 scale model in the museum. "Vasa" is an example not so much of the heavily gilded sculptures of early <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> art but rather 'the last gasps of the <a href="medieval%20art">medieval</a> sculpture tradition' with its fondness for gaudy colors, in a style that today would be considered extravagant or even vulgar.
The sculptures are carved out of <a href="oak">oak</a>, <a href="pine">pine</a> or <a href="Tilia">linden</a>, and many of the larger pieces, like the huge 3-metre (10 ft) long figurehead lion, consist of several parts carved individually and fitted together with bolts. Close to 500 sculptures, most of which are concentrated on the high stern and its galleries and on the beakhead, are found on the ship. The figure of <a href="Hercules">Hercules</a> appears as a pair of pendants, one younger and one older, on each side of the lower stern galleries; the pendants depict opposite aspects of the ancient hero, who was extremely popular during antiquity as well as in 17th-century European art. On the transom are biblical and nationalistic symbols and images. A particularly popular motif is the lion, which can be found as the <a href="Mascaron%20%28architecture%29">mascarons</a> originally fitted on the insides of the gunport doors, grasping the royal coat of arms on either side, the figurehead, and even clinging to the top of the rudder. Each side of the beakhead originally had 20 figures (though only 19 have actually been found) that depicted <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman emperor</a>s from <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius</a> to <a href="Septimius%20Severus">Septimius Severus</a>. Overall, almost all heroic and positive imagery is directly or indirectly identified with the king and was originally intended to glorify him as a wise and powerful ruler. The only actual portrait of the king, however, is located at the very top of the transom in the stern. Here he is depicted as a young boy with long, flowing hair, being crowned by two <a href="griffin">griffin</a>s representing the king's father, <a href="Charles%20IX%20of%20Sweden">Charles IX</a>.
A team of at least six expert sculptors worked for a minimum of two years on the sculptures, most likely with the assistance of an unknown number of apprentices and assistants. No direct credit for any of the sculptures has been provided, but the distinct style of one of the most senior artists, Mårten Redtmer, is clearly identifiable. Other accomplished artists, like Hans Clausink, Johan Didrichson Tijsen (or "Thessen" in Swedish) and possibly Marcus Ledens, are known to have been employed for extensive work at the naval yards at the time "Vasa" was built, but their respective styles are not distinct enough to associate them directly with any specific sculptures.

The artistic quality of the sculptures varies considerably, and about four distinct styles can be identified. The only artist who has been positively associated with various sculptures is Mårten Redtmer, whose style has been described as 'powerful, lively and naturalistic'. He was responsible for a considerable number of the sculptures. These include some of the most important and prestigious pieces: the figurehead lion, the royal coat of arms, and the sculpture of the king at the top of the transom. Two of the other styles are described as 'elegant ... a little stereotyped and manneristic', and of a 'heavy, leisurely but nevertheless rich and lively style', respectively. The fourth and last style, deemed clearly inferior to the other three, is described as 'stiff and ungainly' and was done by other carvers, perhaps even apprentices, of lesser skill.

On 10 August 1628, Captain Söfring Hansson ordered "Vasa" to depart on her maiden voyage to the naval station at <a href="%C3%84lvsnabben">Älvsnabben</a>. The day was calm, and the only wind was a light breeze from the southwest. The ship was <a href="Warping%20%28sailing%29">warped</a> (hauled by anchor) along the eastern waterfront of the city to the southern side of the harbor, where four sails were set, and the ship made way to the east. The gun ports were open, and the guns were out to fire a salute as the ship left Stockholm.

As "Vasa" passed under the <a href="Lee%20side">lee</a> of the bluffs to the south (what is now <a href="S%C3%B6dermalm">Södermalm</a>), a gust of wind filled her sails, and she <a href="Heel%20%28sailing%29">heeled</a> suddenly to <a href="Port%20%28nautical%29">port</a>. The <a href="Sheet%20%28sailing%29">sheets</a> were cast off, and the ship slowly <a href="Metacentric%20height">righted herself</a> as the gust passed. At Tegelviken, where there is a gap in the bluffs, an even stronger gust again forced the ship onto its port side, this time pushing the open lower gunports under the surface, allowing water to rush in onto the lower gundeck. The water building up on the deck quickly exceeded the ship's minimal ability to right itself, and water continued to pour in until it ran down into the hold; the ship quickly sank to a depth of 32 m (105 ft) only 120 m (390 ft) from shore. Survivors clung to debris or the upper masts, which were still above the surface, to save themselves, and many nearby boats rushed to their aid, but despite these efforts and the short distance to land, 30 people perished with the ship, according to reports. "Vasa" sank in full view of a crowd of hundreds, if not thousands, of mostly ordinary Stockholmers who had come to see the great ship set sail. The crowd included foreign ambassadors, in effect spies of Gustavus Adolphus' allies and enemies, who also witnessed the catastrophe.

The Council sent a letter to the king the day after the loss, telling him of the sinking, but it took over two weeks to reach him in Poland. 'Imprudence and negligence' must have been the cause, he wrote angrily in his reply, demanding in no uncertain terms that the guilty parties be punished. Captain Söfring Hansson, who survived the disaster, was immediately taken for questioning. Under initial interrogation, he swore that the guns had been properly secured and that the crew was sober. A full inquest before a tribunal of members of the Privy Council and Admiralty took place at the <a href="Tre%20Kronor%20%28castle%29">Royal Palace</a> on 5 September 1628. Each of the surviving officers was questioned as was the supervising shipwright and a number of expert witnesses. Also present at the inquest was the Admiral of the Realm, <a href="Carl%20Gyllenhielm">Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm</a>. The object of the inquest was as much or more to find a scapegoat as to find out why the ship had sunk. Whoever the committee might find guilty for the fiasco would face a severe penalty.

Surviving crew members were questioned one by one about the handling of the ship at the time of the disaster. Was it rigged properly for the wind? Was the crew sober? Was the ballast properly stowed? Were the guns properly secured? However, no-one was prepared to take the blame. Crewmen and contractors formed two camps; each tried to blame the other, and everyone swore he had done his duty without fault and it was during the inquest that the details of the stability demonstration were revealed.

Next, attention was directed to the shipbuilders. 'Why did you build the ship so narrow, so badly and without enough bottom that it capsized?' the prosecutor asked the shipwright Jacobsson. Jacobsson stated that he built the ship as directed by Henrik Hybertsson (long since dead and buried), who in turn had followed the specification approved by the king. Jacobsson had in fact widened the ship by 1 foot 5 inches (c. 42 cm) after taking over responsibility for the construction, but construction of the ship was too far advanced to allow further widening.

In the end, no guilty party could be found. The answer Arendt de Groote gave when asked by the court why the ship sank was 'Only God knows'. Gustavus Adolphus had approved all measurements and armaments, and the ship was built according to the instructions and loaded with the number of guns specified. In the end, no-one was punished or found guilty for negligence, and the blame effectively fell on Henrik Hybertsson.

Less than three days after the disaster, a contract was signed for the ship to be raised. However, those efforts were unsuccessful. The earliest attempts at raising "Vasa" by English engineer Ian Bulmer, resulted in righting the ship but also got it more securely stuck in the mud and was most likely one of the biggest impediments to the earliest attempts at recovery. Salvaging technology in the early 17th century was much more primitive than today, but the recovery of ships used roughly the same principles as were used to raise "Vasa" more than 300 years later. Two ships or hulks were placed parallel to either side above the wreck, and ropes attached to several <a href="anchor">anchor</a>s were sent down and hooked to the ship. The two hulks were filled with as much water as was safe, the ropes tightened, and the water pumped out. The sunken ship then rose with the ships on the surface and could be towed to shallower waters. The process was then repeated until the entire ship was successfully raised above water level. Even if the underwater weight of "Vasa" was not great, the mud in which it had settled made it sit more secure on the bottom and required considerable lifting power to overcome. More than 30 years after the ship's sinking, in 1663–1665, Albreckt von Treileben and Andreas Peckell mounted an effort to recover the valuable guns. With a simple <a href="diving%20bell">diving bell</a>, the team of Swedish and Finnish divers retrieved more than 50 of them.

Such activity waned when it became clear that the ship could not be raised by the technology of the time. However, "Vasa" did not fall completely into obscurity after the recovery of the guns. The ship was mentioned in several histories of Sweden and the Swedish Navy, and the location of the wreck appeared on harbor charts of Stockholm in the 19th century. In 1844, the navy officer Anton Ludwig Fahnehjelm turned in a request for salvaging rights to the ship, claiming he had located it. Fahnehjelm was an inventor who designed an early form of light diving suit and had previously been involved in other salvage operations. There were dives made on the wreck in 1895–1896, and a commercial salvage company applied for a permit to raise or salvage the wreck in 1920, but this was turned down. In 1999, a witness also claimed that his father, a petty officer in the Swedish navy, had taken part in diving exercises on "Vasa" in the years before World War I. There is no evidence that anyone visited the wreck site after this until the beginning of the modern "Vasa" project.

In the 333 years that "Vasa" lay on the bottom of Stockholm harbor (called <a href="Stockholms%20str%C3%B6m">Stockholms ström</a>, 'the Stream', in Swedish), the ship and its contents were subject to several destructive forces, first among which were decomposition and erosion. Among the first things to decompose were the thousands of iron bolts that held the <a href="beakhead">beakhead</a> and much of the sterncastle together, and this included all of the ship's wooden sculptures. Almost all of the iron on the ship rusted away within a few years of the sinking, and only large objects, such as anchors, or items made of cast iron, such as cannonballs, survived. Organic materials fared better in the <a href="Hypoxia%20%28environmental%29%23Aquatic%20hypoxia">anaerobic</a> conditions, and so wood, cloth and leather are often in very good condition, but objects exposed to the currents were eroded by the sediment in the water, so that some are barely recognizable. Objects which fell off the hull into the mud after the nails corroded through were well protected, so that many of the sculptures still retain areas of paint and gilding. Of the human remains, most of the soft tissue was quickly consumed by bacteria, fish and crustaceans, leaving only the bones, which were often held together only by clothing, although in one case, hair, nails and brain tissue survived.

The parts of the hull held together by joinery and wooden treenails remained intact for as much as two centuries, suffering gradual erosion of surfaces exposed to the water, unless they were disturbed by outside forces. 
Eventually the entire sterncastle, the high, aft portion of the ship that housed the officers' quarters and held up the transom, gradually collapsed into the mud with all the decorative sculptures. The <a href="quarter%20gallery">quarter galleries</a>, which were merely nailed to the sides of the sterncastle, collapsed fairly quickly and were found lying almost directly below their original locations.
Human activity was the most destructive factor, as the initial salvage efforts, the recovery of the guns, and the final salvage in the 20th century all left their marks. Peckell and Treileben broke up and removed much of the planking of the weather deck to get to the cannons on the decks below. Peckell reported that he had recovered 30 cartloads of wood from the ship; these might have included not just planking and structural details but also some of the sculptures which today are missing, such as the life-size Roman warrior near the bow and the sculpture of <a href="Septimius%20Severus">Septimius Severus</a> that adorned the port side of the <a href="beakhead">beakhead</a>. Since "Vasa" lay in a busy shipping channel, ships occasionally dropped anchor over the ship, and one large anchor demolished most of the upper sterncastle, probably in the 19th century. Construction work in Stockholm harbor usually results in blasting of bedrock, and the resulting tonnes of rubble were often dumped in the harbor; some of this landed on the ship, causing further damage to the stern and the upper deck.

In the early 1950s, amateur <a href="archaeology">archaeologist</a> <a href="Anders%20Franz%C3%A9n">Anders Franzén</a> considered the possibility of recovering wrecks from the cold <a href="brackish">brackish</a> waters of the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> because, he reasoned, they were free from the <a href="shipworm">shipworm</a> "Teredo navalis", which usually destroys submerged wood rapidly in warmer, saltier seas. Franzén had previously been successful in locating wrecks such as "Riksäpplet" and "Lybska Svan", and after long and tedious research he began looking for "Vasa" as well. He spent many years probing the waters without success around the many assumed locations of the wreckage. He did not succeed until, based on accounts of an unknown topographical anomaly just south of the Gustav V dock on <a href="Beckholmen">Beckholmen</a>, he narrowed his search. In 1956, with a home-made, gravity-powered coring probe, he located a large wooden object almost parallel to the mouth of dock on Beckholmen. The location of the ship received considerable attention, even if the identification of the ship could not be determined without closer investigation. Soon after the announcement of the find, planning got underway to determine how to excavate and raise "Vasa". The <a href="Swedish%20Navy">Swedish Navy</a> was involved from the start, as were various museums and the National Heritage board, representatives of which eventually formed the "Vasa" Committee, the predecessor of the "Vasa" Board.
A number of possible recovery methods were proposed, including filling the ship with ping-pong balls and freezing it in a block of ice, but the method chosen by the Vasa Board (which succeeded the Vasa Committee) was essentially the same one attempted immediately after the sinking. Divers spent two years digging six tunnels under the ship for steel cable slings, which were taken to a pair of lifting <a href="Pontoon%20%28boat%29">pontoons</a> at the surface. The work under the ship was extremely dangerous, requiring the divers to cut tunnels through the clay with high-pressure water jets and suck up the resulting slurry with a dredge, all while working in total darkness with hundreds of tonnes of mud-filled ship overhead. A persisting risk was that the wreck could shift or settle deeper into the mud while a diver was working in a tunnel, trapping him underneath the wreckage. The almost vertical sections of the tunnels near the side of the hull could also potentially collapse and bury a diver inside. Despite the dangerous conditions, more than 1,300 dives were made in the <a href="Marine%20salvage">salvage</a> operation without any serious accidents.

Each time the pontoons were pumped full, the cables tightened and the pontoons were pumped out, the ship was brought a metre closer to the surface. In a series of 18 lifts in August and September 1959, the ship was moved from depth of 32 metres (105 ft) to 16 metres (52 ft) in the more sheltered area of Kastellholmsviken, where divers could work more safely to prepare for the final lift. Over the course of a year and a half, a small team of commercial divers cleared debris and mud from the upper decks to lighten the ship, and made the hull as watertight as possible. The gun ports were closed by means of temporary lids, a temporary replacement of the collapsed sterncastle was constructed, and many of the holes from the iron bolts that had rusted away were plugged. The final lift began on 8 April 1961, and on the morning of 24 April, "Vasa" was ready to return to the world for the first time in 333 years. Press from all over the world, television cameras, 400 invited guests on barges and boats, and thousands of spectators on shore watched as the first timbers broke the surface. The ship was then emptied of water and mud and towed to the Gustav V <a href="dry%20dock">dry dock</a> on Beckholmen, where the ship was floated on its own keel onto a concrete pontoon, on which the hull still stands.

From the end of 1961 to December 1988, "Vasa" was housed in a temporary facility called Wasavarvet ('The Vasa Shipyard'), which included exhibit space as well as the activities centred on the ship. A building was erected over the ship on its pontoon, but it was very cramped, making conservation work awkward. Visitors could view the ship from just two levels, and the maximum viewing distance was in most places only a couple of metres, which made it difficult for viewers to get an overall view of the ship. In 1981, the Swedish government decided that a permanent building was to be constructed, and a design competition was organised. The winning design, by the Swedish architects Månsson and Dahlbäck, called for a large hall over the ship in a polygonal, industrial style. Ground was broken in 1987, and "Vasa" was towed into the half-finished <a href="Vasa%20Museum">Vasa Museum</a> in December 1988. The museum was officially opened to the public in 1990.

"Vasa" posed an unprecedented challenge for archaeologists. Never before had a four-story structure, with most of its original contents largely undisturbed, been available for excavation. The conditions under which the team had to work added to the difficulties. The ship had to be kept wet in order that it not dry out and crack before it could be properly conserved. Digging had to be performed under a constant drizzle of water and in a sludge-covered mud that could be more than one metre (approximately three feet) deep. In order to establish find locations, the hull was divided into several sections demarcated by the many structural beams, the decking and by a line drawn along the centre of the ship from stern to bow. For the most part, the decks were excavated individually, though at times work progressed on more than one deck level simultaneously.

"Vasa" had four preserved decks: the upper and lower gun decks, the hold and the <a href="Orlop%20deck">orlop</a>. Because of the constraints of preparing the ship for conservation, the archaeologists had to work quickly, in 13-hour shifts during the first week of excavation. The upper gun deck was greatly disturbed by the various salvage projects between 1628 and 1961, and it contained not only material that had fallen down from the rigging and upper deck, but also more than three centuries of harbor refuse. The decks below were progressively less disturbed. The gundecks contained not just gun carriages, the three surviving cannons, and other objects of a military nature, but were also where most of the personal possessions of the sailors had been stored at the time of the sinking. These included a wide range of loose finds, as well as chests and casks with spare clothing and shoes, tools and materials for mending, money (in the form of low-denomination copper coins), privately purchased provisions, and all of the everyday objects needed for life at sea. Most of the finds are of wood, testifying not only to the simple life on board, but to the generally unsophisticated state of Swedish material culture in the early 17th century. The lower decks were primarily used for storage, and so the hold was filled with barrels of provisions and gunpowder, coils of anchor cable, iron shot for the guns, and the personal possessions of some of the officers. On the orlop deck, a small compartment contained six of the ship's ten sails, rigging spares, and the working parts for the ship's pumps. Another compartment contained the possessions of the ship's carpenter, including a large tool chest.

After the ship itself had been salvaged and excavated, the site of the loss was excavated thoroughly during 1963–1967. This produced many items of rigging tackle as well as structural timbers that had fallen off, particularly from the beakhead and sterncastle. Most of the sculptures that had decorated the exterior of the hull were also found in the mud, along with the ship's anchors and the skeletons of at least four people. The last object to be brought up was the nearly 12-metre-long <a href="longboat">longboat</a>, called "esping" in Swedish, found lying parallel to the ship and believed to have been towed by "Vasa" when she sank.

Many of the more recent objects contaminating the site were disregarded when the finds were registered, but some were the remains of the 1660s salvage efforts and others had their own stories to tell. Among the best known of these was a statue of 20th-century Finnish runner <a href="Paavo%20Nurmi">Paavo Nurmi</a>, which was placed on the ship as a prank by students of <a href="Helsinki%20University%20of%20Technology">Helsinki University of Technology</a> the night before the final lift.

"Vasa" sank because it had very little <a href="initial%20stability">initial stability</a>, which can be thought of as resistance to heeling over under the force of wind or waves acting on the hull. The reason for this is that the distribution of mass in the hull structure and the ballast, guns, provisions, and other objects loaded on board puts too much weight too high in the ship. The <a href="center%20of%20gravity">centre of gravity</a> is too high, and so it takes very little force to make the ship heel over, and there is not enough <a href="righting%20moment">righting moment</a>, force trying to make the ship return to an upright position. The reason that the ship has such a high centre of gravity is not due to the guns. These weighed little over 60 tonnes, or about 5% of the total displacement of the loaded ship. This is relatively low weight and should be bearable in a ship this size. The problem is in the hull construction itself. The part of the hull above the waterline is too high and too heavily built in relation to the amount of hull in the water. The headroom in the decks is higher than necessary for crewmen who were, on average, only 1.67 metres (5 feet 5½ inches) tall, and thus the weight of the decks and the guns they carry is higher above the waterline than needed. In addition, the deck beams and their supporting timbers are over-dimensioned and too closely spaced for the loads they carry, so they contribute too much weight to the already tall and heavy upper works.

The use of different measuring systems on either side of the vessel caused its mass to be distributed asymmetrically, heavier to port. During construction both <a href="Swedish%20feet">Swedish feet</a> and <a href="Amsterdam%20feet">Amsterdam feet</a> were in use by different teams. Archaeologists have found four rulers used by the workmen who built the ship. Two were calibrated in Swedish feet, which had 12 inches, while the other two measured Amsterdam feet, which had 11 inches.

Although the mathematical tools for calculating or predicting stability were still more than a century in the future, and 17th-century scientific ideas about how ships behaved in water were deeply flawed, the people associated with building and sailing ships for the Swedish navy were very much aware of the forces at work and their relationships to each other. In the last part of the inquest held after the sinking, a group of master shipwrights and senior naval officers were asked for their opinions about why the ship sank. Their discussion and conclusions show very clearly that they knew what had happened, and their verdict was summed up very clearly by one of the captains, who said that the ship did not have enough 'belly' to carry the heavy upperworks.

Ship design was not yet a science, but was an empirical process based on experience rather than calculation. Balancing the military need for firepower against the maritime need for seaworthiness resulted in some compromises that would not pass modern standards for stability. A ship with two gundecks was an even more demanding proposition, as the lower tier of gunports had to be uncomfortably close to the water, and there was an unavoidably large amount of weight being carried above the waterline. One of the solutions which became common was graduated armament, in which the guns of the upper decks were progressively lighter. Such an armament, with 24-pounders on the lower gundeck and 12-pounders on the upper gundeck, was considered for "Vasa" in 1627, but eventually the armament plan reverted to the king's original desire of 24-pounders on both decks. "Vasa"s sister ship, "Äpplet", had her upper gundeck 24-pounders changed for 12-pounders early in her career, probably in attempt to improve her stability.

"Vasa" might not have sunk on 10 August 1628, if the ship had been sailed with the gunports closed. Ships with multiple tiers of gunports normally had to sail with the lowest tier closed, since the pressure of wind in the sails would usually push the hull over until the lower gunport sills were under water. For this reason, the gunport lids are made with a double lip which is designed to seal well enough to keep out most of the water. Captain Söfring Hansson had ordered the lower gundeck ports closed once the ship began to take on water, but by then it was too late. If he had done it before he sailed, "Vasa" might not have sunk on that day.

Although "Vasa" was in surprisingly good condition after 333 years at the bottom of the sea, it would have quickly deteriorated if the hull had been simply allowed to dry. The large bulk of "Vasa", over 600 cubic metres (21,000 cu ft) of oak timber, constituted an unprecedented conservation problem. After some debate on how to best preserve the ship, conservation was carried out by impregnation with <a href="polyethylene%20glycol">polyethylene glycol</a> (PEG), a method that has since become the standard treatment for large, waterlogged wooden objects, such as the 16th-century English ship "<a href="Mary%20Rose">Mary Rose</a>". "Vasa" was sprayed with PEG for 17 years, followed by a long period of slow drying, which is not yet entirely complete.

The reason that "Vasa" was so well-preserved was not just that the <a href="shipworm">shipworm</a> that normally devours wooden ships was absent but also that the water of <a href="Stockholms%20str%C3%B6m">Stockholms ström</a> was heavily polluted until the late 20th century. The highly toxic and hostile environment meant that even the toughest microorganisms that break down wood had difficulty surviving. This, along with the fact that "Vasa" had been newly built and was undamaged when she sank, contributed to her conservation. Unfortunately, the properties of the water also had a negative effect. Chemicals present in the water around "Vasa" had penetrated the wood, and the timber was full of the corrosion products from the bolts and other iron objects which had disappeared. Once the ship was exposed to the air, reactions began inside the timber that produced acidic compounds. In the late 1990s, spots of white and yellow residue were noticed on "Vasa" and some of the associated artefacts. These turned out to be <a href="sulfate">sulfate</a>-containing salts that had formed on the surface of the wood when <a href="sulfides">sulfides</a> reacted with atmospheric oxygen. The salts on the surface of "Vasa" and objects found in and around it are not a threat themselves (even if the discolouring may be distracting), but if they are from inside the wood, they may expand and crack the timber from inside. As of 2002, the amount of sulfuric acid in "Vasa"'s hull was estimated to be more than 2 tonnes, and more is continually being created. Enough sulfides are present in the ship to produce another 5,000 kilograms (11,000 lb) of acid at a rate of about 100 kilograms (220 lb) per year; this might eventually destroy the ship almost entirely.

While most of the scientific community considers that the destructive substance responsible for "Vasa"'s long-term decay is sulfuric acid, Ulla Westermark, professor of wood technology at <a href="Lule%C3%A5%20University%20of%20Technology">Luleå University of Technology</a>, has proposed another mechanism with her colleague Börje Stenberg. Experiments done by Japanese researchers show that treating wood with <a href="Polyethylene%20glycol">PEG</a> in an acidic environment can generate <a href="formic%20acid">formic acid</a> and eventually liquify the wood. "Vasa" was exposed to acidic water for more than three centuries, and therefore has a relatively low pH. Samples taken from the ship indicate that formic acid is present, and that it could be one of the multiple causes of a suddenly accelerated rate of decomposition.
The museum is constantly monitoring the ship for damage caused by decay or warping of the wood. Ongoing research seeks the best way to preserve the ship for future generations and to analyze the existing material as closely as possible. A current problem is that the old <a href="oak">oak</a> of which the ship is built has lost a substantial amount of its original strength and the cradle that supports the ship does not match up very well with the distribution of weight and stress in the hull. 'The amount of movement in the hull is worrying. If nothing is done, the ship will most likely capsize again', states Magnus Olofson from the "Vasa" Museum. An effort to secure "Vasa" for the future is under way, in cooperation with the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Royal Institute of Technology</a> and other institutions around the globe.

To deal with the problem of the inevitable deterioration of the ship, the main hall of the "Vasa" Museum is kept at a temperature of and a humidity level of 53%. To slow the destruction by acidic compounds, different methods have been tried. Small objects have been sealed in plastic containers filled with an inert atmosphere of <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> gas, for halting further reactions between sulfides and oxygen. The ship itself has been treated with cloth saturated in a <a href="Base%20%28chemistry%29">basic</a> liquid to neutralise the low pH, but this is only a temporary solution as acid is continuously produced. The original bolts rusted away after the ship sank but were replaced with modern ones that were <a href="galvanization">galvanised</a> and covered with <a href="epoxy">epoxy</a> resin. Despite this, the newer bolts also started to rust and were releasing iron into the wood, which accelerated the deterioration. Those bolts were replaced with bolts made of <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a> between 2011 and 2018.

"Vasa" has become a popular and widely recognised symbol for a historical narrative about the Swedish "stormaktstiden" ('the Great Power-period') in the 17th century, and about the early development of a European <a href="nation%20state">nation state</a>. Within the disciplines of history and <a href="maritime%20archaeology">maritime archaeology</a> the wrecks of large warships from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries have received particularly widespread attention as perceived symbols of a past greatness of the state of Sweden. Among these wrecks, "Vasa" is the single best known example, and has also become recognised internationally, not least through a deliberate use of the ship as a symbol for marketing Sweden abroad. The name "Vasa" has in Sweden become synonymous with sunken vessels that are considered to be of great historical importance, and these are usually described, explained and valued in relation to "Vasa" itself. The Swedish maritime archaeologist Carl-Olof Cederlund, who has been active in the various "Vasa"-projects, has described the phenomenon as "regalskepps-syndromet", 'the royal ship syndrome' (after the term used in the 17th century for the largest warships in the Swedish navy). He associates the 'syndrome' to a nationalist aspect of the <a href="history%20of%20ideas">history of ideas</a> and traditional perceptions about hero-kings and glory through war. The focus of this historical theory lies on the 'great periods' in 'our [Swedish] history' and shares many similarities with the nationalist views of the <a href="Viking%20era">Viking era</a> in the Nordic countries and the praising of Greek and Roman <a href="Classical%20Antiquity">Antiquity</a> in the Western world in general. Cederlund has stressed the ritualised aspects of the widely publicised salvage in 1961 and has compared the modern Vasa Museum with 'a temple in the Classical sense of the word'. The placement of the museum on Djurgården, traditional crown property, and its focus on 'the King's ship' has led him to suggest a description of it as 'The Temple of the Royal Ship'.

"Vasa" has been the subject of hundreds of books, articles and papers on topics ranging from marine archaeology to culinary history. Three children's books about "Vasa" have been written in Swedish and later translated into English, German, Danish, and Norwegian: "The Vasa Saga" by <a href="Bertil%20Almqvist">Bertil Almqvist</a>, "The Vasa Sets Sail" by Mats Wahl (illustrated by <a href="Sven%20Nordqvist">Sven Nordqvist</a>), and "The Vasa Piglet" by Björn Bergenholtz.

"Vasa's" unique status has drawn considerable attention and captured the imagination of more than two generations of scholars, tourists, model builders, and authors. Though historically unfounded, the popular perception of the building of the ship as a botched and disorganised affair (dubbed 'the <a href="Vasa%20syndrome">"Vasa"-syndrome</a>') has been used by many authors of management literature as an educational example of how not to organise a successful business. In "The Tender Ship", <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> engineer <a href="Arthur%20Squires">Arthur Squires</a> used the "Vasa" story as an opening illustration of his thesis that governments are usually incompetent managers of technology projects.
The Vasa Museum has co-sponsored two versions of a documentary about the history and recovery of the ship, both by documentary filmmaker <a href="Anders%20Wahlgren">Anders Wahlgren</a>. The second version is currently shown in the museum and has been released on VHS and DVD with narration in 16 languages. In late 2011, a third "Vasa"-film premiered on Swedish television, with a longer running time and a considerably larger budget (with over 7.5 million kronor provided by <a href="Sveriges%20Television">SVT</a>). An educational computer game, now in its second generation, has been made and is used in the museum and on its website to explain the fundamentals of 17th century ship construction and stability. Several mass-produced model kits and countless custom-built models of the ship have been made. In 1991, a 308-tonne <a href="pastiche">pastiche</a> reproduction of the ship was built in Tokyo to serve as a 650-passenger sightseeing ship. "Vasa" has inspired many works of art, including a gilded Disney-themed parody of the <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a> sculptures on the ship's quarter galleries. Being a popular tourist attraction, "Vasa" is used as a motif for various souvenir products such as T-shirts, mugs, refrigerator magnets, and posters. Commercially produced replicas—such as drinking glasses, plates, spoons, and even a <a href="backgammon">backgammon</a> game—have been made from many of the objects belonging to the crew or officers found on the ship.

Ninety-five Theses

The Ninety-five Theses or Disputation on the Power of Indulgences is a list of propositions for an academic <a href="disputation">disputation</a> written in 1517 by <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>, professor of <a href="Catholic%20moral%20theology">moral theology</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Wittenberg">University of Wittenberg</a>, Germany. They advanced Luther's positions against what he saw as the abuse of the practice of clergy selling <a href="plenary%20indulgence">plenary indulgence</a>s, which were certificates believed to reduce the <a href="Indulgence">temporal punishment</a> in <a href="purgatory">purgatory</a> for <a href="Christian%20views%20on%20sin">sins</a> committed by the purchasers or their loved ones. In the "Theses", Luther claimed that the required by Christ in order for sins to be forgiven involves inner spiritual repentance rather than merely external <a href="Sacrament%20of%20Penance">sacramental confession</a>. He argued that indulgences led Christians to avoid true repentance and sorrow for sin, believing that they could forgo it by purchasing an indulgence. They also, according to Luther, discouraged Christians from giving to the poor and performing other acts of mercy, believing that indulgence certificates were more spiritually valuable. Though Luther claimed that his positions on indulgences accorded with those of <a href="Pope%20Leo%20X">the Pope</a>, the "Theses" challenge a 14th-century <a href="papal%20bull">papal bull</a> stating that the pope could use the <a href="treasury%20of%20merit">treasury of merit</a> and the good deeds of past saints to forgive temporal punishment for sins. The "Theses" are framed as propositions to be argued in debate rather than necessarily representing Luther's opinions, but Luther later clarified his views in the "Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences".

Luther sent the "Theses" enclosed with a letter to <a href="Albert%20of%20Brandenburg">Albert of Brandenburg</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Mainz">Archbishop of Mainz</a>, on 31 October 1517, a date now considered the start of the Reformation and commemorated annually as <a href="Reformation%20Day">Reformation Day</a>. Luther may have also posted the "Theses" on the door of <a href="All%20Saints%27%20Church%2C%20Wittenberg">All Saints' Church</a> and other churches in Wittenberg, in accordance with University custom, on 31 October or in mid-November. The "Theses" were quickly reprinted, translated, and distributed throughout Germany and Europe. They initiated a <a href="pamphlet%20war">pamphlet war</a> with the indulgence preacher <a href="Johann%20Tetzel">Johann Tetzel</a>, which spread Luther's fame even further. Luther's ecclesiastical superiors had him tried for <a href="heresy">heresy</a>, which culminated in his <a href="excommunication%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">excommunication</a> in 1521. Though the "Theses" were the start of the Reformation, Luther did not consider indulgences to be as important as other theological matters which would divide the church, such as and the <a href="On%20the%20Bondage%20of%20the%20Will">bondage of the will</a>. His breakthrough on these issues would come later, and he did not see the writing of the "Theses" as the point at which his beliefs diverged from those of Rome.

<a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>, professor of <a href="Catholic%20moral%20theology">moral theology</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Wittenberg">University of Wittenberg</a> and town preacher, wrote the "Ninety-five Theses" against the contemporary practice of the church with respect to <a href="indulgences">indulgences</a>. In the Roman Catholic Church, practically the only Christian church in Western Europe at the time, indulgences are part of the <a href="Economy%20of%20Salvation">economy of salvation</a>. In this system, when Christians <a href="Christian%20views%20on%20sin">sin</a> and <a href="Sacrament%20of%20Penance">confess</a>, they are forgiven and no longer stand to receive eternal punishment in hell, but may still be liable to temporal punishment. This punishment could be satisfied by the penitent's performing <a href="works%20of%20mercy">works of mercy</a>. If the temporal punishment is not satisfied during life, it needs to be satisfied in <a href="Purgatory">Purgatory</a>. By an indulgence (which may be understood in the sense of "kindness"), this temporal punishment could be lessened. Under abuses of the system of indulgences, clergy benefited by selling indulgences and the <a href="pope">pope</a> gave official sanction in exchange for a fee.
Popes are empowered to grant plenary indulgences, which provide complete satisfaction for any remaining temporal punishment due to sins, and these were purchased on behalf of people believed to be in purgatory. This led to the popular saying, "As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs". Theologians at the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">University of Paris</a> had criticized this saying late in the 15th century. Earlier critics of indulgences included <a href="John%20Wycliffe">John Wycliffe</a>, who denied that the pope had jurisdiction over Purgatory. <a href="Jan%20Hus">Jan Hus</a> and <a href="Hussites">his followers</a> had advocated a more severe system of penance, in which indulgences were not available. <a href="Johannes%20von%20Wesel">Johannes von Wesel</a> had also attacked indulgences late in the 15th century. Political rulers had an interest in controlling indulgences because local economies suffered when the money for indulgences left a given territory. Rulers often sought to receive a portion of the proceeds or prohibited indulgences altogether, as <a href="George%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxony">Duke George</a> did in Luther's <a href="Electoral%20Saxony">Electoral Saxony</a>.

In 1515, <a href="Pope%20Leo%20X">Pope Leo X</a> granted a plenary indulgence intended to finance the construction of <a href="St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">St. Peter's Basilica</a> in Rome. It would apply to almost any sin, including adultery and theft. All other indulgence preaching was to cease for the eight years in which it was offered. Indulgence preachers were given strict instructions on how the indulgence was to be preached, and they were much more laudatory of the indulgence than those of earlier indulgences. <a href="Johann%20Tetzel">Johann Tetzel</a> was commissioned to preach and offer the indulgence in 1517, and his campaign in cities near <a href="Wittenberg">Wittenberg</a> drew many Wittenbergers to travel to these cities and purchase them, since sales had been prohibited in Wittenberg and other Saxon cities.

Luther also had experience with the indulgences connected to <a href="All%20Saints%27%20Church%2C%20Wittenberg">All Saints' Church, Wittenberg</a>. By venerating the large collection of relics at the church, one could receive an indulgence. He had preached as early as 1514 against the abuse of indulgences and the way they cheapened grace rather than requiring true <a href="Repentance%20%28Christianity%29">repentance</a>. Luther became especially concerned in 1517 when his parishioners, returning from purchasing Tetzel's indulgences, claimed that they no longer needed to repent and change their lives in order to be forgiven of sin. After hearing what Tetzel had said about indulgences in his sermons, Luther began to study the issue more carefully, and contacted experts on the subject. He preached about indulgences several times in 1517, explaining that true repentance was better than purchasing an indulgence. He taught that receiving an indulgence presupposed that the penitent had confessed and repented, otherwise it was worthless. A truly repentant sinner would also not seek an indulgence, because they loved God's righteousness and desired the inward punishment of their sin. These sermons seem to have ceased from April to October 1517, presumably while Luther was writing the "Ninety-five Theses". He composed a "Treatise on Indulgences", apparently in early autumn 1517. It is a cautious and searching examination of the subject. He contacted church leaders on the subject by letter, including his superior , <a href="Bishop%20of%20Brandenburg">Bishop of Brandenburg</a>, sometime on or before 31 October, when he sent the "Theses" to Archbishop <a href="Albert%20of%20Brandenburg">Albert of Brandenburg</a>.

The first thesis has become famous. It states, "When our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said, 'Repent,' he willed the entire life of believers to be one of repentance." In the first few theses Luther develops the idea of repentance as the Christian's inner struggle with sin rather than the external system of sacramental confession. Theses 5–7 then state that the pope can only release people from the punishments he has administered himself or through the church's system of penance, not the guilt of sin. The pope can only announce God's forgiveness of the guilt of sin in his name. In theses 14–29, Luther challenged common beliefs about purgatory. Theses 14–16 discuss the idea that the punishment of purgatory can be likened to the fear and despair felt by dying people. In theses 17–24 he asserts that nothing can be definitively said about the spiritual state of people in purgatory. He denies that the pope has any power over people in purgatory in theses 25 and 26. In theses 27–29, he attacks the idea that as soon as payment is made, the payer's loved one is released from purgatory. He sees it as encouraging sinful greed, and says it is impossible to be certain because only God has ultimate power in forgiving punishments in purgatory.
Theses 30–34 deal with the false certainty Luther believed the indulgence preachers offered Christians. Since no one knows whether a person is truly repentant, a letter assuring a person of his forgiveness is dangerous. In theses 35 and 36, he attacks the idea that an indulgence makes repentance unnecessary. This leads to the conclusion that the truly repentant person, who alone may benefit from the indulgence, has already received the only benefit the indulgence provides. Truly repentant Christians have already, according to Luther, been forgiven of the penalty as well as the guilt of sin. In thesis 37, he states that indulgences are not necessary for Christians to receive all the benefits provided by Christ. Theses 39 and 40 argue that indulgences make true repentance more difficult. True repentance desires God's punishment of sin, but indulgences teach one to avoid punishment, since that is the purpose of purchasing the indulgence.

In theses 41–47 Luther criticizes indulgences on the basis that they discourage works of mercy by those who purchase them. Here he begins to use the phrase, "Christians are to be taught..." to state how he thinks people should be instructed on the value of indulgences. They should be taught that giving to the poor is incomparably more important than buying indulgences, that buying an indulgence rather than giving to the poor invites God's wrath, and that doing good works makes a person better while buying indulgences does not. In theses 48–52 Luther takes the side of the pope, saying that if the pope knew what was being preached in his name he would rather St. Peter's Basilica be burned down than "built up with the skin, flesh, and bones of his sheep." Theses 53–55 complain about the restrictions on preaching while the indulgence was being offered.

Luther criticizes the doctrine of the <a href="treasury%20of%20merit">treasury of merit</a> on which the doctrine of indulgences is based in theses 56–66. He states that everyday Christians do not understand the doctrine and are being misled. For Luther, the true treasure of the church is <a href="the%20gospel">the gospel</a> of Jesus Christ. This treasure tends to be hated because it makes "the first last", in the words of <a href="Gospel%20of%20Matthew">Matthew</a> 19:30 and 20:16. Luther uses <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a> and <a href="wordplay">wordplay</a> to describe the treasures of the gospel as nets to catch wealthy people, whereas the treasures of indulgences are nets to catch the wealth of men.
In theses 67–80, Luther discusses further the problems with the way indulgences are being preached, as he had done in the letter to Archbishop Albert. The preachers have been promoting indulgences as the greatest of the graces available from the church, but they actually only promote greed. He points out that bishops have been commanded to offer reverence to indulgence preachers who enter their jurisdiction, but bishops are also charged with protecting their people from preachers who preach contrary to the pope's intention. He then attacks the belief allegedly propagated by the preachers that the indulgence could forgive one who had violated the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>. Luther states that indulgences cannot take away the guilt of even the lightest of <a href="venial%20sins">venial sins</a>. He labels several other alleged statements of the indulgence preachers as blasphemy: that <a href="Saint%20Peter">Saint Peter</a> could not have granted a greater indulgence than the current one, and that the indulgence cross with the <a href="Papal%20coats%20of%20arms">papal arms</a> is as worthy as the cross of Christ.

Luther lists several criticisms advanced by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing rather than his own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory if it is in his power? What should he say to those who ask why anniversary <a href="Requiem">masses for the dead</a>, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the "Theses" by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.

The "Theses" are written as propositions to be argued in a formal academic <a href="disputation">disputation</a>, though there is no evidence that such an event ever took place. In the heading of the "Theses", Luther invited interested scholars from other cities to participate. Holding such a debate was a privilege Luther held as a doctor, and it was not an unusual form of academic inquiry. Luther prepared twenty sets of theses for disputation at Wittenberg between 1516 and 1521. <a href="Andreas%20Karlstadt">Andreas Karlstadt</a> had written a set of such theses in April 1517, and these were more radical in theological terms than Luther's. He posted them on the door of All Saints' Church, as Luther was alleged to have done with the "Ninety-five Theses". Karlstadt posted his theses at a time when the relics of the church were placed on display, and this may have been considered a provocative gesture. Similarly, Luther posted the "Ninety-five Theses" on the eve of <a href="All%20Saints%27%20Day">All Saints' Day</a>, the most important day of the year for the display of relics at All Saints' Church.

Luther's theses were intended to begin a debate among academics, not a popular revolution, but there are indications that he saw his action as prophetic and significant. Around this time, he began using the name "Luther" and sometimes "Eleutherius", Greek for "free", rather than "Luder". This seems to refer to his being free from the scholastic theology which he had argued against earlier that year. Luther later claimed not to have desired the "Theses" to be widely distributed. <a href="Elizabeth%20Eisenstein">Elizabeth Eisenstein</a> has argued that his claimed surprise at their success may have involved self-deception and Hans Hillerbrand has claimed that Luther was certainly intending to instigate a large controversy. At times, Luther seems to use the academic nature of the "Theses" as a cover to allow him to attack established beliefs while being able to deny that he intended to attack church teaching. Since writing a set of theses for a disputation does not necessarily commit the author to those views, Luther could deny that he held the most incendiary ideas in the "Theses". The posting of the Ninety-five Theses and other attacks on the Church were predicated on Luther's developing beliefs about Jesus, salvation by faith alone and his study of biblical prophecies.

On 31 October 1517, Luther sent a letter to the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Mainz">Archbishop of Mainz</a>, Albert of Brandenburg, under whose authority the indulgences were being sold. In the letter, Luther addresses the archbishop out of a loyal desire to alert him to the pastoral problems created by the indulgence sermons. He assumes that Albert is unaware of what is being preached under his authority, and speaks out of concern that the people are being led away from the gospel, and that the indulgence preaching may bring shame to Albert's name. Luther does not condemn indulgences or the current doctrine regarding them, nor even the sermons which had been preached themselves, as he had not seen them firsthand. Instead he states his concern regarding the misunderstandings of the people about indulgences which have been fostered by the preaching, such as the belief that any sin could be forgiven by indulgences or that the guilt as well as the punishment for sin could be forgiven by an indulgence. In a postscript, Luther wrote that Albert could find some theses on the matter enclosed with his letter, so that he could see the uncertainty surrounding the doctrine of indulgences in contrast to the preachers who spoke so confidently of the benefits of indulgences.
It was customary when proposing a disputation to have the theses printed by the <a href="university%20press">university press</a> and publicly posted. No copies of a Wittenberg printing of the "Ninety-five Theses" have survived, but this is not surprising as Luther was not famous and the importance of the document was not recognized. In Wittenberg, the university statutes demand that theses be posted on every church door in the city, but <a href="Philip%20Melanchthon">Philip Melanchthon</a>, who first mentioned the posting of the "Theses", only mentioned the door of All Saints' Church. Melanchthon also claimed that Luther posted the "Theses" on 31 October, but this conflicts with several of Luther's statements about the course of events, and Luther always claimed that he brought his objections through proper channels rather than inciting a public controversy. It is possible that while Luther later saw the 31 October letter to Albert as the beginning of the Reformation, he did not post the "Theses" to the church door until mid-November, but he may not have posted them on the door at all. Regardless, the "Theses" were well-known among the Wittenberg intellectual elite soon after Luther sent them to Albert.

The "Theses" were copied and distributed to interested parties soon after Luther sent the letter to Archbishop Albert. The Latin "Theses" were printed in a four-page <a href="pamphlet">pamphlet</a> in <a href="Basel">Basel</a>, and as <a href="placards">placards</a> in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> and <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>. In all, several hundred copies of the Latin "Theses" were printed in Germany in 1517. in Nuremberg translated them into German later that year, and copies of this translation were sent to several interested parties across Germany, but it was not necessarily printed.

Albert seems to have received Luther's letter with the "Theses" around the end of November. He requested the opinion of theologians at the <a href="University%20of%20Mainz">University of Mainz</a> and conferred with his advisers. His advisers recommended he have Luther prohibited from preaching against indulgences in accordance with the indulgence bull. Albert requested such action from the <a href="Roman%20Curia">Roman Curia</a>. In Rome, Luther was immediately perceived as a threat. In February 1518, Pope Leo asked the head of the <a href="Augustinian%20Hermits">Augustinian Hermits</a>, Luther's <a href="Religious_order%23Christianity">religious order</a>, to convince him to stop spreading his ideas about indulgences. <a href="Sylvester%20Mazzolini">Sylvester Mazzolini</a> was also appointed to write an opinion which would be used in the trial against him. Mazzolini wrote "A Dialogue against Martin Luther's Presumptuous Theses concerning the Power of the Pope", which focused on Luther's questioning of the pope's authority rather than his complaints about indulgence preaching. Luther received a summons to Rome in August 1518. He responded with "Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences", in which he attempted to clear himself of the charge that he was attacking the pope. As he set down his views more extensively, Luther seems to have recognized that the implications of his beliefs set him further from official teaching than he initially knew. He later said he might not have begun the controversy had he known where it would lead. The "Explanations" have been called Luther's first Reformation work.
Johann Tetzel responded to the "Theses" by calling for Luther to be burnt for <a href="heresy">heresy</a> and having theologian <a href="Konrad%20Wimpina">Konrad Wimpina</a> write 106 theses against Luther's work. Tetzel defended these in a disputation before the <a href="University%20of%20Frankfurt%20on%20the%20Oder">University of Frankfurt on the Oder</a> in January 1518. 800 copies of the printed disputation were sent to be sold in Wittenberg, but students of the University seized them from the bookseller and burned them. Luther became increasingly fearful that the situation was out of hand and that he would be in danger. To placate his opponents, he published a "<a href="Sermon%20on%20Indulgences%20and%20Grace">Sermon on Indulgences and Grace</a>", which did not challenge the pope's authority. This pamphlet, written in German, was very short and easy for laypeople to understand. Luther's first widely successful work, it was reprinted twenty times. Tetzel responded with a point-by-point refutation, citing heavily from the Bible and important theologians. His pamphlet was not nearly as popular as Luther's. Luther's reply to Tetzel's pamphlet, on the other hand, was another publishing success for Luther.

Another prominent opponent of the "Theses" was <a href="Johann%20Eck">Johann Eck</a>, Luther's friend and a theologian at the <a href="University%20of%20Ingolstadt">University of Ingolstadt</a>. Eck wrote a refutation, intended for the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Eichst%C3%A4tt">Bishop of Eichstätt</a>, entitled the "Obelisks". This was in reference to the <a href="Dagger%20%28typography%29">obelisks</a> used to mark heretical passages in texts in the Middle Ages. It was a harsh and unexpected personal attack, charging Luther with heresy and stupidity. Luther responded privately with the "Asterisks", titled after the <a href="asterisk">asterisk</a> marks then used to highlight important texts. Luther's response was angry and he expressed the opinion that Eck did not understand the matter on which he wrote. The dispute between Luther and Eck would become public in the 1519 <a href="Leipzig%20Debate">Leipzig Debate</a>.

Luther was summoned by authority of the pope to defend himself against charges of heresy before <a href="Thomas%20Cajetan">Thomas Cajetan</a> at <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a> in October 1518. Cajetan did not allow Luther to argue with him over his alleged heresies, but he did identify two points of controversy. The first was against the fifty-eighth thesis, which stated that the pope could not use the treasury of merit to forgive temporal punishment of sin. This contradicted the papal bull "Unigenitus" promulgated by <a href="Clement%20VI">Clement VI</a> in 1343. The second point was whether one could be assured that they had been forgiven when their sin had been absolved by a priest. Luther's "Explanations" on thesis seven asserted that one could based on God's promise, but Cajetan argued that the humble Christian should never presume to be certain of their standing before God. Luther refused to recant and requested that the case be reviewed by university theologians. This request was denied, so Luther appealed to the pope before leaving Augsburg. Luther was finally <a href="excommunication%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">excommunicated</a> in 1521 after he burned <a href="Exsurge%20Domine">the papal bull</a> threatening him to recant or face excommunication.

The indulgence controversy set off by the "Theses" was the beginning of the Reformation, a <a href="schism">schism</a> in the Roman Catholic Church which initiated profound and lasting social and political change in Europe. Luther later stated that the issue of indulgences was insignificant relative to controversies which he would enter into later, such as his debate with <a href="Erasmus">Erasmus</a> over the <a href="Bondage%20of%20the%20Will">bondage of the will</a>, nor did he see the controversy as important to his intellectual breakthrough regarding <a href="the%20gospel">the gospel</a>. Luther later wrote that at the time he wrote the "Theses" he remained a "<a href="papist">papist</a>", and he did not seem to think the "Theses" represented a break with established Roman Catholic doctrine. But it was out of the indulgences controversy that the movement which would be called the Reformation began, and the controversy propelled Luther to the leadership position he would hold in that movement. The "Theses" also made evident that Luther believed the church was not preaching properly and that this put the laity in serious danger. Further, the "Theses" contradicted the decree of <a href="Pope%20Clement%20VI">Pope Clement VI</a>, that indulgences are the treasury of the church. This disregard for papal authority presaged later conflicts.

31 October 1517, the day Luther sent the "Theses" to Albert, was commemorated as the beginning of the Reformation as early as 1527, when Luther and his friends raised a glass of beer to commemorate the "trampling out of indulgences". The posting of the "Theses" was established in the historiography of the Reformation as the beginning of the movement by <a href="Philip%20Melanchthon">Philip Melanchthon</a> in his 1548 "Historia de vita et actis Lutheri". During the 1617 Reformation Jubilee, the centenary of 31 October was celebrated by a procession to the Wittenberg Church where Luther was believed to have posted the "Theses". An engraving was made showing Luther writing the "Theses" on the door of the church with a gigantic quill. The quill penetrates the head of a lion symbolizing Pope Leo X. In 1668, 31 October was made <a href="Reformation%20Day">Reformation Day</a>, an annual holiday in Electoral Saxony, which spread to other Lutheran lands. 31 October 2017, the 500th Anniversary of Reformation Day, was celebrated with a national public holiday throughout Germany.

Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi

Akagi (<a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a>: 赤城 "Red Castle") was an <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> built for the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN), named after <a href="Mount%20Akagi">Mount Akagi</a> in present-day <a href="Gunma%20Prefecture">Gunma Prefecture</a>. Though she was <a href="Keel%20laying">laid down</a> as an , "Akagi" was converted to an aircraft carrier while still under construction to comply with the terms of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>. The ship was rebuilt from 1935 to 1938 with her original three <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a>s consolidated into a single enlarged flight deck and an <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23I">island</a> superstructure. The second Japanese aircraft carrier to enter service, and the first large or <a href="Fleet%20carrier">"fleet" carrier</a>, "Akagi" and the related <a href="Japanese%20aircraft%20carrier%20Kaga">Kaga</a> figured prominently in the development of the IJN's new carrier striking force doctrine that grouped carriers together, concentrating their air power. This doctrine enabled Japan to attain its strategic goals during the early stages of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> from December 1941 until mid-1942.

"Akagi"s aircraft served in the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a> in the late 1930s. Upon the formation of the <a href="1st%20Air%20Fleet%20of%20the%20Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">First Air Fleet</a> or "Kido Butai" (Striking Force) in early 1941, she became its <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, and remained so for the duration of her service. With other fleet carriers, she took part in the <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Attack on Pearl Harbor</a> in December 1941 and the <a href="battle%20of%20Rabaul%20%281942%29">invasion of Rabaul</a> in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month, her aircraft <a href="Bombing%20of%20Darwin">bombed Darwin, Australia</a>, and assisted in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies%20campaign">conquest of the Dutch East Indies</a>. In March and April 1942, "Akagi" aircraft helped sink a British <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> and an Australian <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean%20raid">Indian Ocean Raid</a>.

After a brief refit, "Akagi" and three other fleet carriers of the "<a href="Kido%20Butai">Kido Butai</a>" participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a> in June 1942. After bombarding American forces on <a href="Midway%20Atoll">the atoll</a>, "Akagi" and the other carriers were attacked by aircraft from Midway and the carriers , , and . <a href="Dive%20bomber">Dive bomber</a>s from "Enterprise" severely damaged "Akagi". When it became obvious she could not be saved, she was <a href="scuttling">scuttled</a> by Japanese destroyers to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. The loss of "Akagi" and three other IJN carriers at Midway was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to the Allies' ultimate victory in the Pacific.

"Akagi" was laid down as an at <a href="Kure%20Naval%20Arsenal">Kure, Japan</a>, on 6 December 1920. The ship was named after <a href="Mount%20Akagi">Mount Akagi</a>, following the <a href="Japanese%20ship-naming%20conventions">Japanese ship-naming conventions</a> for battlecruisers. Construction was halted, however, when Japan signed the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> on 6 February 1922. The treaty placed restrictions on the construction of battleships and battlecruisers although it authorized conversion of two battleship or battlecruiser hulls under construction into aircraft carriers of up to displacement. The IJN had decided, following the launch of its first aircraft carrier, , to construct two larger, faster carriers for operations with major fleet units. The incomplete hulls of and "Akagi" were thus selected for completion as the two large carriers under the 1924 fleet construction program. ¥24.7 million was originally budgeted to complete "Akagi" as a battlecruiser and an estimated ¥8 million had been expended when construction stopped in February 1922. Shortly thereafter, the <a href="Diet%20of%20Japan">Diet</a> approved an additional ¥90 million to complete "Akagi" and "Amagi" as carriers.
Construction of "Akagi" as an aircraft carrier began on 19 November 1923. "Amagi"s hull was damaged beyond economically feasible repair in the <a href="1923%20Great%20Kant%C5%8D%20earthquake">Great Kantō earthquake</a> of 1 September 1923 and was broken up and scrapped. "Akagi", the only remaining member of her class, was launched as a carrier on 22 April 1925 and commissioned at <a href="Kure%20Naval%20Arsenal">Kure Naval Arsenal</a> on 25 March 1927, although trials continued through November 1927. She was the second carrier to enter service with the IJN, after "Hōshō" and before (which replaced "Amagi").

Since "Akagi" was initially conceived as a battlecruiser, the prevailing <a href="Japanese%20ship%20naming%20conventions">ship naming conventions</a> dictated that she (like her sister ships) be named after a mountain. "Akagi" came from <a href="Mount%20Akagi">Mount Akagi</a>, a dormant volcano in the <a href="Kant%C5%8D%20region">Kantō region</a> (the name literally means "red castle"). After she was redesignated as an aircraft carrier, her mountain name remained, in contrast to ships like that were originally built as aircraft carriers, which were named after flying creatures. Her name was previously given to the <a href="Japanese%20gunboat%20Akagi">"Maya"-class gunboat "Akagi"</a>.

"Akagi" was completed at a length of <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>. She had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and, at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>, a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draft</a> of . She displaced at standard load, and at full load, nearly less than her designed displacement as a battlecruiser. Her complement totaled 1,600 crewmembers.

"Akagi" and "Kaga" were completed with three superimposed flight decks, the only carriers ever to be designed so. The British carriers converted from "large light cruisers", , , and , each had two flight decks, but there is no evidence that the Japanese copied the British model. It is more likely that it was a case of convergent evolution to improve <a href="launch%20and%20recovery%20cycle">launch and recovery cycle</a> flexibility by allowing simultaneous launch and recovery of aircraft. "Akagi"s main flight deck was long and wide, her middle flight deck (beginning right in front of the bridge) was only long and her lower flight deck was long. The utility of her middle flight deck was questionable as it was so short that only some lightly loaded aircraft could use it, even in an era when the aircraft were much lighter and smaller than during World War II. The upper flight deck sloped slightly from amidships toward the bow and toward the stern to assist landings and takeoffs for the underpowered aircraft of that time.
As completed, the ship had two main hangar decks and a third auxiliary hangar, giving a total capacity of 60 aircraft. The third and lowest hangar deck was used only for storing disassembled aircraft. The two main hangars opened onto the middle and lower flight decks to allow aircraft to take off directly from the hangars while landing operations were in progress on the main flight deck above. The upper and middle hangar areas totaled about , the lower hangar about . No catapults were fitted. Her forward <a href="Elevator%23Aircraft%20elevators">aircraft lift</a> was offset to starboard and in size. Her aft lift was on the centerline and . The aft elevator serviced the upper flight deck and all three hangar decks. Her <a href="arresting%20gear">arresting gear</a> was an unsatisfactory British longitudinal system used on the carrier "Furious" that relied on friction between the arrester hook and the cables. The Japanese were well aware of this system's flaws, as it was already in use on their first carrier, "Hōshō", but had no alternatives available when "Akagi" was completed. It was replaced during the ship's refit in 1931 with a Japanese-designed transverse cable system with six wires and that was replaced in turn before "Akagi" began her modernization in 1935 by the Kure Model 4 type (Kure shiki 4 gata). There was no island superstructure when the carrier was completed; the carrier was commanded from a space below the forward end of the upper flight deck. The ship carried approximately of <a href="aviation%20fuel">aviation fuel</a> for her embarked aircraft.

As originally completed, "Akagi" carried an air group of 28 <a href="Mitsubishi%20B1M">Mitsubishi B1M3 torpedo bombers</a>, 16 <a href="Nakajima%20A1N">Nakajima A1N</a> fighters and 16 <a href="Mitsubishi%202MR">Mitsubishi 2MR</a> reconnaissance aircraft.

"Akagi" was armed with ten 50-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a> <a href="20%20cm/50%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">20 cm 3rd Year Type No. 1 guns</a>, six in casemates aft and the rest in two twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one on each side of the middle flight deck. They fired projectiles at a rate of 3–6 rounds per minute with a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of ; at 25°, this provided a maximum range between . The turrets were nominally capable of 70° elevation to provide additional <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> fire, but in practice the maximum elevation was only 55°. The slow rate of fire and the fixed 5° loading angle minimized any real anti-aircraft capability. This heavy gun armament was provided in case she was surprised by enemy cruisers and forced to give battle, but her large and vulnerable flight deck, hangars, and superstructure made her more of a target in any surface action than a fighting warship. Carrier doctrine was still evolving at this time and the impracticality of carriers engaging in gun duels had not yet been realized.
The ship carried dedicated anti-aircraft armament of six twin 45-caliber <a href="12%20cm/45%2010th%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">12 cm 10th Year Type gun</a> mounts fitted on <a href="sponson">sponson</a>s below the level of the funnels, where they could not fire across the flight deck, three mounts per side. These guns fired projectiles at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of ; at 45°, this provided a maximum range of , and they had a maximum ceiling of at 75° elevation. Their effective rate of fire was 6–8 rounds per minute.

"Akagi"s <a href="Belt%20armor">waterline armored belt</a> was reduced from and placed lower on the ship than originally designed. The upper part of her <a href="Anti-torpedo%20bulge">torpedo bulge</a> was given of armor. Her <a href="Deck%20%28ship%29">deck armor</a> was also reduced from . The modifications improved the ship's stability by helping compensate for the increased topside weight of the double hangar deck.

In "Akagi" predecessor, "Hōshō", the hot exhaust gases vented by swivelling funnels posed a danger to the ship, and wind-tunnel testing had not suggested any solutions. "Akagi" and "Kaga" were given different solutions to evaluate in real-world conditions. "Akagi" was given two funnels on the starboard side. The larger, forward funnel was angled 30° below horizontal with its mouth facing the sea, and the smaller one exhausted vertically a little past the edge of the flight deck. The forward funnel was fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot exhaust gases and a cover that could be raised to allow the exhaust gases to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea. "Kaga" adopted a version of this configuration when she was modernized during the mid-1930s.

"Akagi" was completed with four Gihon geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a> sets, each driving one propeller shaft, that produced a total of . Steam for these turbines was provided by nineteen Type B Kampon <a href="boiler%20%28steam%20generator%29">boiler</a>s with a working pressure of . Some boilers were oil-fired, and the others used a mix of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> and coal. As a battlecruiser, she was expected to achieve , but the reduction in displacement from increased her maximum speed to , which was reached during her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s on 17 June 1927. She carried of fuel oil and of coal that gave her a range of at .

"Akagi" joined the <a href="Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a> in August 1927 and was assigned to the <a href="First%20Carrier%20Division">First Carrier Division</a> upon its formation on 1 April 1928, serving as the division's flagship under Rear Admiral <a href="Sankichi%20Takahashi">Sankichi Takahashi</a>. The carrier's early career was uneventful, consisting of various training exercises. From 10 December 1928 to 1 November 1929, the ship was captained by <a href="Isoroku%20Yamamoto">Isoroku Yamamoto</a>, future commander of the Combined Fleet.

"Akagi" was reduced to second-class reserve status on 1 December 1931 in preparation for a short refit in which her arresting gear was replaced and her radio and ventilation systems were overhauled and improved. After completion of the refit, "Akagi" became a first-class reserve ship in December 1932. On 25 April 1933, she resumed active service and joined the <a href="Second%20Carrier%20Division">Second Carrier Division</a> and participated in that year's Special Fleet Maneuvers.

At this time, the IJN's carrier doctrine was still in its early stages. "Akagi" and the IJN's other carriers were initially given roles as tactical force multipliers supporting the fleet's battleships in the IJN's "<a href="Kantai%20Kessen">decisive battle</a>" doctrine. In this role, "Akagi's" aircraft were to attack enemy battleships with bombs and torpedoes. Aerial strikes against enemy carriers were later (beginning around 1932–1933) deemed of equal importance, with the goal of establishing <a href="air%20superiority">air superiority</a> during the initial stages of battle. The essential component in this strategy was that the Japanese carrier aircraft must be able to strike first with a massed, preemptive aerial attack. In fleet training exercises, the carriers began to operate together in front of or with the main battle line. The new strategy emphasized maximum speed from both the carriers and the aircraft they carried as well as larger aircraft with greater range. Thus, longer flight decks on the carriers were required in order to handle the newer, heavier aircraft which were entering service. As a result, on 15 November 1935 "Akagi" was placed in third-class reserve to begin an extensive modernization at <a href="Sasebo%20Naval%20Arsenal">Sasebo Naval Arsenal</a>.

"Akagi"s modernization involved far less work than that of "Kaga", but took three times as long due to financial difficulties related to the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. The ship's three flight decks were judged too small to handle the larger and heavier aircraft then coming into service. As a result, the middle and lower flight decks were eliminated in favor of two enclosed hangar decks that extended almost the full length of the ship. The upper and middle hangar areas' total space increased to about ; the lower hangar remained the same size. The upper flight deck was extended to the bow, increasing its length to and raising aircraft capacity to 86 (61 operational and 25 in storage). A third elevator midships, in size, was added. Her arrester gear was replaced by a Japanese-designed, hydraulic Type 1 system with 9 wires. The modernization added an island superstructure on the port side of the ship, which was an unusual arrangement; the only other carrier to share this feature was a contemporary, the . The port side was chosen as an experiment to see if that side was better for flight operations by moving the island away from the ship's exhaust outlets. The new flight deck inclined slightly fore and aft from a point about three-eighths of the way aft.
"Akagi"s speed was already satisfactory and the only changes to her machinery were the replacement of the mixed coal/oil-fired boilers with modern oil-fired units and the improvement of the ventilation arrangements. Although the engine horsepower increased from 131,200 to 133,000, her speed declined slightly from on trials because of the increase in her displacement to . Her bunkerage was increased to of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> which increased her endurance to at . The rear vertical funnel was changed to match the forward funnel and incorporated into the same casing.

The two twin turrets on the middle flight deck were removed and fourteen twin <a href="Type%2096%2025%20mm%20AT/AA%20Gun">Type 96</a> gun mounts were added on sponsons. They fired projectiles at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of ; at 50°, this provided a maximum range of , and an effective ceiling of . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110–120 rounds per minute due to the frequent need to change the 15-round magazines. Six Type 95 directors were fitted to control the new 25 mm guns and two new Type 94 anti-aircraft directors replaced the outdated Type 91s. After the modernization, "Akagi" carried one Type 89 director for the guns; it is uncertain how many were carried before then. The ship's crew increased to 2,000 after the reconstruction.
The ship's anti-aircraft guns were grouped amidships and placed relatively low on the hull. Thus, the guns could not be brought to bear directly forward or aft. Also, the island blocked the forward arcs of the port battery. As a result, the ship was vulnerable to attack by dive bombers. The ship's 12 cm 10th Year Type guns were scheduled to be replaced by more modern Type 89 mounts in 1942. The anti-aircraft sponsons were to be raised one deck to allow them some measure of cross-deck fire as was done during "Kaga"s modernization. However, the ship was lost in combat before the upgrade could take place.

Several major weaknesses in "Akagi"s design were not rectified. "Akagi"s aviation fuel tanks were incorporated directly into the structure of the carrier, meaning that shocks to the ship, such as those caused by bomb or shell hits, would be transmitted directly to the tanks, resulting in cracks or leaks. Also, the fully enclosed structure of the new hangar decks made firefighting difficult, at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars. Adding to the danger was the requirement of the Japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced, fueled, and armed whenever possible on the hangar decks rather than on the flight deck. Furthermore, the carrier's hangar and flight decks carried little armor protection, and there was no redundancy in the ship's fire-extinguishing systems. These weaknesses would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship.

"Akagi"s modernization was completed on 31 August 1938. She was reclassified as a first reserve ship on 15 November, but did not rejoin the First Carrier Division until the following month. In her new configuration, the carrier embarked 12 <a href="Mitsubishi%20A5M">Mitsubishi A5M</a> Type 96 "Claude" fighters with 4 disassembled spares, 19 <a href="Aichi%20D1A">Aichi D1A</a> "Susie" dive bombers with 5 spares, and 35 <a href="Yokosuka%20B4Y">Yokosuka B4Y</a> "Jean" horizontal/torpedo bombers with 16 spares. She sailed for southern Chinese waters on 30 January 1939 and supported ground operations there, including attacks on <a href="Guilin">Guilin</a> and <a href="Liuzhou">Liuzhou</a>, until 19 February, when she returned to Japan. "Akagi" supported operations in central China between 27 March and 2 April 1940. She was reclassified as a special purpose ship ("Tokubetse Ilomokan") on 15 November 1940, while she was being overhauled.
The Japanese experiences off China had helped further develop the IJN's carrier doctrine. One lesson learned in China was the importance of concentration and mass in projecting naval air power ashore. Therefore, in April 1941, the IJN formed the <a href="1st%20Air%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">First Air Fleet</a>, or "Kido Butai", to combine all of its fleet carriers under a single command. On 10 April, "Akagi" and "Kaga" were assigned to the First Carrier Division as part of the new carrier fleet, which also included the Second (with carriers "Hiryū" and "Sōryū"), and <a href="Fifth%20Carrier%20Division">Fifth</a> (with "Shōkaku" and "Zuikaku") carrier divisions. The IJN centered its doctrine on air strikes that combined the air groups of entire carrier divisions, rather than individual carriers. When multiple carrier divisions were operating together, the divisions' air groups were combined. This doctrine of combined, massed, carrier-based air attack groups was the most advanced of its kind in the world. The IJN, however, remained concerned that concentrating all of its carriers together would render them vulnerable to being wiped out all at once by a massive enemy air or surface strike. Thus, the IJN developed a compromise solution in which the fleet carriers would operate closely together within their carrier divisions but the divisions themselves would operate in loose rectangular formations, with approximately separating each carrier.

The Japanese doctrine held that entire carrier air groups should not be launched in a single massed attack. Instead, each carrier would launch a "deckload strike" of all its aircraft that could be spotted at one time on each flight deck. Subsequent attack waves consisted of the next deckload of aircraft. Thus, First Air Fleet air attacks would often consist of at least two massed waves of aircraft. The First Air Fleet was "not" considered to be the IJN's primary strategic striking force. The IJN still considered the First Air Fleet an integral component in the Combined Fleet's "<a href="Kantai%20Kessen">Kantai Kessen</a>" or "decisive battle" task force centered on battleships. "Akagi" was designated as the flagship for the First Air Fleet, a role the ship retained until her sinking 14 months later.

Although the concentration of so many fleet carriers into a single unit was a new and revolutionary offensive strategic concept, the First Air Fleet suffered from several defensive deficiencies that gave it, in <a href="Mark%20Peattie">Mark Peattie</a>'s words, a <a href="wikt%3Aglass%20jaw">glass jaw</a>': it could throw a punch but couldn't take one." Japanese carrier anti-aircraft guns and associated fire-control systems had several design and configuration deficiencies that limited their effectiveness. Also, the IJN's fleet <a href="combat%20air%20patrol">combat air patrol</a> (CAP) consisted of too few fighter aircraft and was hampered by an inadequate early warning system, including lack of <a href="radar">radar</a>. In addition, poor radio communications with the fighter aircraft inhibited effective command and control of the CAP. Furthermore, the carriers' escorting warships were not trained or deployed to provide close anti-aircraft support. These deficiencies, combined with the shipboard weaknesses previously detailed, would eventually doom "Akagi" and other First Air Fleet carriers.

In preparation for the attack, the ship was anchored at <a href="Ariake%20Sea">Ariake Bay</a>, <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a> beginning in September 1941 while her aircraft were based at <a href="Kagoshima">Kagoshima</a> to train with the other 1st Air Fleet air units for the Pearl Harbor operation. Once preparations and training were completed, "Akagi" assembled with the rest of the First Air Fleet at <a href="Iturup">Hitokappu Bay</a> in the <a href="Kuril%20Islands">Kuril Islands</a> on 22 November 1941. The ships departed on 26 November 1941 for Hawaii.
Commanded by Captain <a href="Kiichi%20Hasegawa">Kiichi Hasegawa</a>, "Akagi" was Vice Admiral <a href="Ch%C5%ABichi%20Nagumo">Chūichi Nagumo</a>'s flagship for the striking force for the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> that attempted to cripple the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">United States Pacific Fleet</a>. "Akagi" and the other five carriers, from a position north of <a href="Oahu">Oahu</a>, launched two waves of aircraft on the morning of 7 December 1941. In the first wave, 27 <a href="Nakajima%20B5N">Nakajima B5N</a> "Kate" torpedo bombers from "Akagi" torpedoed the battleships , , and while 9 of the ship's <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">Mitsubishi A6M Zero</a>s attacked the air base at <a href="Hickam%20Field">Hickam Field</a>. In the second wave, 18 <a href="Aichi%20D3A">Aichi D3A</a> "Val" dive bombers from the carrier targeted the battleships and , the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> , the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> , and the <a href="fleet%20oiler">fleet oiler</a> while nine "Zeros" attacked various American airfields. One of the carrier's Zeros was shot down by American anti-aircraft guns during the first wave attack, killing its pilot. In addition to the aircraft which participated in the raid, three of the carrier's fighters were assigned to the CAP. One of the carrier's Zero fighters attacked a <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress</a> <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a> that had just arrived from the mainland, setting it on fire as it landed at Hickam, killing one of its crew.

In January 1942, together with the rest of the First and Fifth Carrier Divisions, "Akagi" supported the <a href="battle%20of%20Rabaul%20%281942%29">invasion of Rabaul</a> in the <a href="Bismarck%20Archipelago">Bismarck Archipelago</a>, as the Japanese moved to secure their southern defensive perimeter against attacks from Australia. She provided 20 B5Ns and 9 Zeros for the initial airstrike on <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> on 20 January 1942. The First Carrier Division attacked Allied positions at nearby <a href="Kavieng">Kavieng</a> the following day, of which "Akagi" contributed 9 A6M Zeros and 18 D3As. On the 22nd, "Akagi"s D3As and Zeros again attacked Rabaul before returning to <a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Truk</a> on 27 January. The Second Carrier Division, with "Sōryū" and "Hiryū", had been detached to support the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wake%20Island">invasion of Wake Island</a> on 23 December 1941 and did not reunite with the rest of the carrier mobile striking force until February 1942.

"Akagi", along with "Kaga" and the carrier , sortied in search of American naval forces <a href="Marshalls%E2%80%93Gilberts%20raids">raiding</a> the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a> on 1 February 1942, before being recalled. On 7 February "Akagi" and the carriers of the First and Second Carrier Divisions were ordered south to the <a href="Timor%20Sea">Timor Sea</a> where, on 19 February, from a point southeast of the easternmost tip of <a href="Timor">Timor</a>, they launched <a href="Bombing%20of%20Darwin">air strikes</a> against <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Australia, in an attempt to destroy its port and airfield facilities to prevent any interference with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Java%20%281942%29">invasion of Java</a>. "Akagi" contributed 18 B5Ns, 18 D3As, and 9 Zeros to the attack, which caught the defenders by surprise. Eight ships were sunk, including the American destroyer , and fourteen more were damaged. None of the carrier's aircraft were lost in the attack and the attack was effective in preventing Darwin from contributing to the Allied defense of Java. On 1 March, the American oiler was sunk by D3As from and "Akagi". Later that same day the American destroyer was attacked and sunk by D3As from "Akagi" and "Sōryū", in combination with gunfire from two battleships and two heavy cruisers of the escort force. "Akagi" and her consorts covered the invasion of <a href="Java">Java</a>, although her main contribution appears to have been providing 18 B5Ns and 9 Zeros for the 5 March air strike on <a href="Cilacap%20Regency">Tjilatjap</a>. This group was very successful, sinking eight ships in the harbor there and none of "Akagi"s aircraft were lost. Most of the Allied forces in the Dutch East Indies surrendered to the Japanese later in March. The "Kido Butai" then sailed for <a href="Staring%20Bay">Staring Bay</a> on <a href="Sulawesi">Celebes Island</a> to refuel and recuperate.

On 26 March, "Akagi" set sail for the <a href="Indian%20Ocean%20raid">Indian Ocean raid</a> with the rest of the "Kido Butai". The Japanese intent was to defeat the British <a href="Eastern%20Fleet">Eastern Fleet</a> and destroy British airpower in the region in order to secure the flank of their <a href="Japanese%20conquest%20of%20Burma">operations in Burma</a>. On 5 April 1942, "Akagi" launched 17 B5Ns and 9 Zeros in an air strike against <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a>, Ceylon, which damaged the port facilities. None of the aircraft were lost and the Zero pilots claimed to have shot down a dozen of the defending British fighters. Later that day, 17 D3As from "Akagi" helped to sink the British heavy cruisers and . On 9 April, she attacked <a href="Trincomalee">Trincomalee</a> with 18 B5Ns, escorted by 6 Zeros which claimed to have shot down 5 <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a> fighters (only two of which can be confirmed from Allied records) without loss to themselves. Meanwhile, a floatplane from the battleship spotted the small aircraft carrier , escorted by the Australian destroyer , and every available D3A was launched to attack the ships. "Akagi" contributed 17 dive bombers and they helped to sink both ships; they also spotted the <a href="oil%20tanker">oil tanker</a> <a href="Royal%20Fleet%20Auxiliary">RFA</a> "Athelstone", escorted by the <a href="corvette">corvette</a> , as well and sank both without loss. During the day's actions, the carrier narrowly escaped damage when nine British <a href="Bristol%20Blenheim">Bristol Blenheim</a> bombers from Ceylon penetrated the CAP and dropped their bombs from , just missing the carrier and the heavy cruiser . Four of the Blenheims were subsequently shot down by CAP fighters and one was shot down by aircraft from the carriers' returning air strike. After the raid, the carrier mobile striking force returned to Japan to refit and replenish.

On 19 April 1942, while near Taiwan during the transit to Japan, "Akagi", "Sōryū", and "Hiryū" were sent in pursuit of the American carriers and , which had launched the <a href="Doolittle%20Raid">Doolittle Raid</a>. They found only empty ocean, however, for the American carriers had immediately departed the area to return to Hawaii. "Akagi" and the other carriers shortly abandoned the chase and dropped anchor at <a href="Hashirajima">Hashirajima</a> anchorage on 22 April. On 25 April, Captain <a href="Taijiro%20Aoki">Taijiro Aoki</a> relieved Hasegawa as skipper of the carrier. Having been engaged in constant operations for four and a half months, the ship, along with the other three carriers of the First and Second Carrier Divisions, was hurriedly refitted and replenished in preparation for the Combined Fleet's next major operation, scheduled to begin one month hence. The Fifth Carrier Division, with "Shōkaku" and "Zuikaku", had been detached in mid-April to support <a href="Operation%20Mo">Operation Mo</a>, resulting in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Coral%20Sea">Battle of the Coral Sea</a>. While at Hashirajima, "Akagi"s air group was based ashore in <a href="Kagoshima">Kagoshima</a> and conducted flight and weapons training with the other First Air Fleet carrier units.

Concerned by the US carrier strikes in the Marshall Islands, <a href="Invasion%20of%20Lae-Salamaua">Lae-Salamaua</a>, and the Doolittle raids, Yamamoto determined to force the US Navy into a showdown to eliminate the American carrier threat. He decided to invade and occupy <a href="Midway%20Island">Midway Island</a>, which he was sure would draw out the American carrier forces to battle. The Japanese codenamed the Midway invasion Operation "MI".

On 25 May 1942, "Akagi" set out with the Combined Fleet's carrier striking force in the company of carriers "Kaga", , and , which constituted the First and Second Carrier Divisions, for the attack on <a href="Midway%20Atoll">Midway Island</a>. Once again, Nagumo flew his flag on "Akagi". Because of damage and losses suffered during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Coral%20Sea">Battle of the Coral Sea</a>, the Fifth Carrier Division with carriers "Shōkaku" and "Zuikaku" was absent from the operation. "Akagi"s aircraft complement consisted of 24 Zeros, 18 D3As, and 18 B5Ns.

With the fleet positioned northwest of Midway Island at dawn (04:45 local time) on 4 June 1942, "Akagi"s portion of the 108-plane combined air raid was a strike on the airfield on Eastern Island with 18 dive bombers escorted by nine Zeros. The carrier's B5Ns were armed with torpedoes and kept ready in case enemy ships were discovered during the Midway operation. The only loss during the raid from "Akagi"s air group was one Zero shot down by AA fire and three damaged; four dive bombers were damaged, of which one could not be repaired. Unbeknownst to the Japanese, the US Navy had discovered the Japanese "MI" plan by breaking the Japanese cipher and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.

One of "Akagi"s torpedo bombers was launched to augment the search for any American ships that might be in the area. The carrier contributed three Zeros to the total of 11 assigned to the initial combat air patrol over the four carriers. By 07:00, the carrier had 11 fighters with the CAP which helped to defend the "Kido Butai" from the first US attackers from Midway Island at 07:10.

At this time, Nagumo's carriers were attacked by six US Navy <a href="Grumman%20TBF%20Avenger">Grumman TBF Avenger</a>s from <a href="Torpedo%20Squadron%208">Torpedo Squadron 8</a> (VT-8) and four <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF) <a href="Martin%20B-26%20Marauder">B-26 Marauders</a>, all carrying torpedoes. The Avengers went after "Hiryū" while the Marauders attacked "Akagi". The 30 CAP Zeroes in the air at this time, including the 11 from "Akagi", immediately attacked the American aircraft, shooting down five of the Avengers and two of the B-26s. One of "Akagi"s Zeroes, however, was shot down by defensive fire from the B-26s. Several of the Marauders dropped their torpedoes, but all either missed or failed to detonate. One B-26, piloted by Lieutenant <a href="James%20Muri">James Muri</a>, <a href="Strafing">strafed</a> "Akagi" after dropping its torpedo, killing two men. Another, either attempting a suicide ramming, or out of control due to battle damage or an incapacitated pilot, narrowly missed crashing into "Akagi"s bridge, where Nagumo was standing, before it cartwheeled into the sea.

At 07:15, Admiral Nagumo ordered the B5Ns on "Kaga" and "Akagi" rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was limited by the number of ordnance carts (used to handle the bombs and torpedoes) and ordnance elevators, preventing torpedoes from being struck below until after all the bombs were moved up from their <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>, assembled, and mounted on the aircraft. This process normally took about an hour and a half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck, warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40, Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message from one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted. Three of "Akagi"s CAP Zeroes landed aboard the carrier at 07:36. At 07:40, her lone scout returned, having sighted nothing.

At 07:55, the next American strike from Midway arrived in the form of 16 Marine <a href="Douglas%20SBD%20Dauntless">SBD-2 Dauntless</a> dive bombers of <a href="VMSB-241">VMSB-241</a> under Major <a href="Lofton%20R.%20Henderson">Lofton R. Henderson</a>. "Akagi"s three remaining CAP fighters were among the nine still aloft that attacked Henderson's planes, shooting down six of them as they executed a fruitless glide bombing attack on "Hiryū". At roughly the same time, the Japanese carriers were attacked by 12 USAAF <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">B-17 Flying Fortress</a>es, bombing from . The high altitude of the B-17s gave the Japanese captains enough time to anticipate where the bombs would land and successfully maneuver their ships out of the impact area. Four B-17s attacked "Akagi", but missed with all their bombs.

"Akagi" reinforced the CAP with launches of three Zeros at 08:08 and four at 08:32. These fresh Zeros helped defeat the next American air strike from Midway, 11 <a href="Vought%20SB2U%20Vindicator">Vought SB2U Vindicator</a>s from VMSB-241, which attacked the battleship starting around 08:30. Three of the Vindicators were shot down, and "Haruna" escaped damage. Although all the American air strikes had thus far caused negligible damage, they kept the Japanese carrier forces off-balance as Nagumo endeavored to prepare a response to news, received at 08:20, of the sighting of American carrier forces to his northeast.

"Akagi" began recovering her Midway strike force at 08:37 and finished shortly after 09:00. The landed aircraft were quickly struck below, while the carriers' crews began preparations to spot aircraft for the strike against the American carrier forces. The preparations, however, were interrupted at 09:18 when the first American carrier aircraft to attack were sighted. These consisted of 15 <a href="Douglas%20TBD%20Devastator">Douglas TBD Devastator</a> torpedo bombers of VT-8, led by <a href="John%20C.%20Waldron">John C. Waldron</a> from the carrier . The six airborne "Akagi" CAP Zeroes joined the other 15 CAP fighters currently aloft in destroying Waldron's planes. All 15 of the American planes were shot down as they attempted a torpedo attack on "Soryū", leaving one <a href="George%20H.%20Gay%2C%20Jr.">surviving aviator</a> treading water.

Shortly afterwards 14 Devastators from <a href="Torpedo%20Squadron%206">VT-6</a> from the carrier , led by <a href="Eugene%20E.%20Lindsey">Eugene E. Lindsey</a>, attacked. Lindsey's aircraft tried to sandwich "Kaga", but the CAP, reinforced by an additional eight Zeros launched by "Akagi" at 09:33 and 09:40, shot down all but four of the Devastators, and "Kaga" dodged the torpedoes. Defensive fire from the Devastators shot down one of "Akagi"s Zeros.
Minutes after the torpedo plane attacks, American carrier-based dive bombers arrived over the Japanese carriers almost undetected and began their dives. It was at this time, around 10:20, that in the words of Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully, the "Japanese air defenses would finally and catastrophically fail." Twenty-eight dive bombers from "Enterprise", led by <a href="C.%20Wade%20McClusky">C. Wade McClusky</a>, began an attack on "Kaga", hitting her with at least four bombs. At the last minute, one of McClusky's elements of three bombers from <a href="VB-6">VB-6</a>, led by squadron commander <a href="Richard%20Halsey%20Best">Richard Best</a> who deduced "Kaga" to be fatally damaged, broke off and dove simultaneously on "Akagi". At approximately 10:26, the three bombers hit her with one bomb and just missed with two others. The first near-miss landed to port, near her island. The third bomb just missed the flight deck and plunged into the water next to the stern. The second bomb, likely dropped by Best, landed at the aft edge of the middle elevator and detonated in the upper hangar. This hit set off explosions among the fully armed and fueled B5N torpedo bombers that were being prepared for an air strike against the American carriers, resulting in an uncontrollable fire.

At 10:29, Captain Aoki ordered the ship's <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s flooded. The forward magazines were promptly flooded, but the aft magazines were not due to valve damage, likely caused by the near miss aft. The ship's main water pump also appears to have been damaged, greatly hindering fire fighting efforts. On the upper hangar deck, at 10:32 damage control teams attempted to control the spreading fires by employing the one-shot CO2 fire-suppression system. Whether the system functioned or not is unclear, but the burning aviation fuel proved impossible to control, and serious fires began to advance deeper into the interior of the ship. At 10:40, additional damage caused by the near-miss aft made itself known when the ship's rudder jammed 30 degrees to starboard during an evasive maneuver.

Shortly thereafter, the fires broke through the flight deck and heat and smoke made the ship's bridge unusable. At 10:46, Admiral Nagumo transferred his flag to the light cruiser . "Akagi" stopped dead in the water at 13:50 and her crew, except for Captain <a href="Taijiro%20Aoki">Taijiro Aoki</a> and damage-control personnel, was evacuated. She continued to burn as her crew fought a losing battle against the spreading fires. The damage-control teams and Captain Aoki were evacuated from the still floating ship later that night.

At 04:50 on 5 June, Yamamoto ordered "Akagi" scuttled, saying to his staff, "I was once the captain of "Akagi", and it is with heartfelt regret that I must now order that she be sunk." Destroyers <a href="Japanese%20destroyer%20Arashi">"Arashi"</a>, <a href="Japanese%20destroyer%20Hagikaze">"Hagikaze"</a>, <a href="Japanese%20destroyer%20Maikaze">"Maikaze"</a>, and <a href="Japanese%20destroyer%20Nowaki%20%281940%29">"Nowaki"</a> each fired one torpedo into the carrier and she sank, bow first, at 05:20 at . Two hundred and sixty-seven men of the ship's crew were lost, the fewest of any of the Japanese fleet carriers lost in the battle. The loss of "Akagi" and the three other IJN carriers at Midway, comprising two thirds of Japan's total number of fleet carriers and the experienced core of the First Air Fleet, was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan's ultimate defeat in the war. In an effort to conceal the defeat, "Akagi" was not immediately removed from the Navy's registry of ships, instead being listed as "unmanned" before finally being struck from the registry on 25 September 1942.

Angkor Wat

Angkor Wat (; , "City/Capital of Temples") is a temple complex in <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a> and one of the largest
religious monuments in the world, on a site measuring . Originally constructed as a <a href="Hinduism">Hindu</a> temple dedicated to the god <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a> for the <a href="Khmer%20Empire">Khmer Empire</a>, it was gradually transformed into a <a href="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> temple towards the end of the 12th century. It was built by the Khmer King <a href="Suryavarman%20II">Suryavarman II</a> in the early 12th century in <a href="Ya%C5%9Bodharapura">Yaśodharapura</a> (, present-day <a href="Angkor">Angkor</a>), the capital of the <a href="Khmer%20Empire">Khmer Empire</a>, as his state temple and eventual mausoleum. Breaking from the <a href="Shaivism">Shaiva</a> tradition of previous kings, Angkor Wat was instead dedicated to Vishnu. As the best-preserved temple at the site, it is the only one to have remained a significant religious centre since its foundation. The temple is at the top of the high classical style of <a href="Khmer%20architecture">Khmer architecture</a>. It has become a symbol of <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, appearing on <a href="Flag%20of%20Cambodia">its national flag</a>, and it is the country's prime attraction for visitors.

Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the <a href="Khmer%20architecture%23Temple%20mountain">temple-mountain</a> and the later <a href="Khmer%20architecture%23Gallery">galleried temple</a>. It is designed to represent <a href="Mount%20Meru">Mount Meru</a>, home of the <a href="Deva%20%28Hinduism%29">devas</a> in <a href="Hindu%20mythology">Hindu mythology</a>: within a <a href="moat">moat</a> more than 5 kilometres (3 mi) long and an outer wall long are three rectangular galleries, each raised above the next. At the centre of the temple stands a <a href="quincunx">quincunx</a> of towers. Unlike most Angkorian temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west; scholars are divided as to the significance of this. The temple is admired for the grandeur and harmony of the architecture, its extensive <a href="Relief%23Bas-relief%20or%20low%20relief">bas-reliefs</a>, and for the numerous <a href="devata">devata</a>s adorning its walls.

The modern name, Angkor Wat () (alternate name: "Nokor Wat", ), means "Temple City" or "City of Temples" in <a href="Khmer%20language">Khmer</a>; "Angkor" () meaning "city" or "capital city", is a vernacular form of the word "nokor" (), which comes from the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word "nagara" (<a href="Devan%C4%81gar%C4%AB">Devanāgarī</a>: नगर). "<a href="Wat">Wat</a>" () is the <a href="Khmer%20language">Khmer</a> word for "temple grounds", also derived from <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> "vāṭa" (<a href="Devan%C4%81gar%C4%AB">Devanāgarī</a>: वाट), meaning "enclosure".

The original name of the temple was Vrah Viṣṇuloka or Parama Viṣṇuloka (<a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>), ( – "Barom Visnulōk") which means the sacred dwelling of Vishnu.

Angkor Wat lies north of the modern town of <a href="Siem%20Reap">Siem Reap</a>, and a short distance south and slightly east of the previous capital, which was centred at <a href="Baphuon">Baphuon</a>. In an area of Cambodia where there is an important group of ancient structures, it is the southernmost of Angkor's main sites.

According to legend, the construction of Angkor Wat was ordered by Indra to serve as a palace for his son Precha Ket Mealea. According to the 13th-century Chinese traveller <a href="Zhou%20Daguan">Zhou Daguan</a>, some believed that the temple was constructed in a single night by a divine architect.

The initial design and construction of the temple took place in the first half of the 12th century, during the reign of <a href="Suryavarman%20II">Suryavarman II</a> (ruled 1113 – c. 1150). Dedicated to <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>, it was built as the king's state temple and capital city. As neither the foundation <a href="Stele">stela</a> nor any contemporary inscriptions referring to the temple have been found, its original name is unknown, but it may have been known as "Varah Vishnu-lok" after the presiding deity. Work seems to have ended shortly after the king's death, leaving some of the <a href="Relief%23Bas-relief%20or%20low%20relief">bas-relief</a> decoration unfinished. In 1177, approximately 27 years after the death of Suryavarman II, Angkor was sacked by the <a href="Champa">Chams</a>, the traditional enemies of the Khmer. Thereafter the empire was restored by a new king, <a href="Jayavarman%20VII">Jayavarman VII</a>, who established a new capital and state temple (<a href="Angkor%20Thom">Angkor Thom</a> and the <a href="Bayon">Bayon</a> respectively) a few kilometres to the north.

Towards the end of the 12th century, Angkor Wat gradually transformed from a Hindu centre of worship to <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, which continues to the present day. Angkor Wat is unusual among the Angkor temples in that although it was largely neglected after the 16th century it was never completely abandoned. Fourteen inscriptions dated from the 17th century discovered in Angkor area testify to <a href="Japanese%20people">Japanese</a> Buddhist pilgrims that had established small settlements alongside Khmer locals. At that time, the temple was thought by the Japanese visitors as the famed <a href="Jetavana">Jetavana</a> garden of the <a href="Buddha">Buddha</a>, which originally located in the kingdom of <a href="Magadha">Magadha</a>, India. The best-known inscription tells of <a href="Ukondafu%20Kazufusa">Ukondafu Kazufusa</a>, who celebrated the <a href="Khmer%20New%20Year">Khmer New Year</a> at Angkor Wat in 1632.

One of the first Western visitors to the temple was <a href="Ant%C3%B3nio%20da%20Madalena">António da Madalena</a>, a <a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> friar who visited in 1586 and said that it "is of such extraordinary construction that it is not possible to describe it with a pen, particularly since it is like no other building in the world. It has towers and decoration and all the refinements which the human genius can conceive of."

In the mid-19th century, the temple was effectively rediscovered by the French naturalist and explorer <a href="Henri%20Mouhot">Henri Mouhot</a>, who popularised the site in the West through the publication of travel notes, in which he wrote:Angkor Wat may relate to the architecture of the Greek and Roman record explored in terms of the west rather than east orientation of the temple. Some architects have written that it is 'correct' for the construction to be facing to the west. In temple orientations for the Greek and Etruscan context, west is associated with "right" and the "underworld" to suggest a religious connection of the building.

Mouhot, like other early Western visitors, found it difficult to believe that the Khmers could have built the temple and mistakenly dated it to around the same era as Rome. His reports inspired the French government, already an established presence in Indochina, to begin a systematic study of the ruins. The true history of Angkor Wat was pieced together from stylistic and <a href="epigraphy">epigraphic</a> evidence accumulated during subsequent clearing and restoration work. There were no ordinary dwellings or houses or other signs of settlement, including cooking utensils, weapons, or items of clothing usually found at ancient sites. Instead there is only the evidence of the monuments themselves. An exploration commission began drawing up a list of principal monuments. Subsequent missions copied inscriptions written on Angkor buildings so scholars might translate them and learn something of Angkor's history. By 1885 they had worked up a chronology of the rulers and developed the outlines of a description of the civilization that had produced the temple complex. In 1898 the French decided to commit substantial funds to Angkor's preservation. Centuries of neglect had permitted the jungle to recapture many of the more significant structures, and unless efforts were made to free the buildings from the embrace of huge banyan and silk-cotton trees, they might soon be crushed to destruction.

The 20th century saw considerable restoration of Angkor Wat. Gradually teams of laborers and archeologists pushed back the jungle and exposed the expanses of stone, permitting the sun once again to illuminate the dark corners of the temple. Work was interrupted by the <a href="Cambodian%20Civil%20War">Cambodian Civil War</a> and <a href="Khmer%20Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> control of the country during the 1970s and 1980s, but relatively little damage was done during this period. Camping Khmer Rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the building structures for firewood, and a shoot-out between Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces put a few bullet holes in a bas relief. Far more damage was done after the wars, by <a href="art%20thieves">art thieves</a> working out of Thailand, which, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, claimed almost every head that could be lopped off the structures, including reconstructions.

The temple is a powerful symbol of Cambodia, and is a source of great national pride that has factored into Cambodia's diplomatic relations with France, the United States and its neighbour Thailand. A depiction of Angkor Wat has been a part of <a href="Flag%20of%20Cambodia">Cambodian national flags</a> since the introduction of the first version circa 1863. From a larger historical and even transcultural perspective, however, the temple of Angkor Wat did not become a symbol of national pride "sui generis" but had been inscribed into a larger politico-cultural process of French-colonial heritage production in which the original temple site was presented in French colonial and universal exhibitions in Paris and Marseille between 1889 and 1937. Angkor Wat's aesthetics were also on display in the plaster cast museum of <a href="Louis%20Delaporte">Louis Delaporte</a> called "musée Indo-chinois" which existed in the Parisian Trocadero Palace from c.1880 to the mid-1920s.

The splendid artistic legacy of Angkor Wat and other Khmer monuments in the <a href="Angkor">Angkor</a> region led directly to France adopting Cambodia as a <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a> on 11 August 1863 and invading Siam to take control of the ruins. This quickly led to Cambodia reclaiming lands in the northwestern corner of the country that had been under Siamese (Thai) control since AD 1351 (Manich Jumsai 2001), or by some accounts, AD 1431. Cambodia gained independence from France on 9 November 1953 and has controlled Angkor Wat since that time. It is safe to say that from the colonial period onwards until the site's nomination as <a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage">UNESCO World Heritage</a> in 1992, this specific temple of Angkor Wat was instrumental in the formation of the modern and gradually globalised concept of built cultural heritage.

In December 2015, it was announced that a research team from <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a> had found a previously unseen ensemble of buried towers built and demolished during the construction of Angkor Wat, as well as massive structure of unknown purpose on its south side and wooden fortifications. The findings also include evidence of low-density residential occupation in the region, with a road grid, ponds and mounds. These indicate that the temple precinct, bounded by moat and wall, may not have been used exclusively by the priestly elite, as was previously thought. The team used <a href="LiDAR">LiDAR</a>, <a href="ground-penetrating%20radar">ground-penetrating radar</a> and targeted excavation to map Angkor Wat.

Angkor Wat, located at , is a unique combination of the <a href="Khmer%20architecture%23Temple%20mountain">temple mountain</a> (the standard design for the empire's state temples) and the later plan of concentric <a href="Khmer%20architecture%23Gallery">galleries</a>. The construction of Angkor Wat also suggests that there was a celestial significance with certain features of the temple. This is observed in the temple's east-west orientation, and lines of sight from terraces within the temple that show specific towers to be at the precise location of the sunrise on a solstice. The temple is a representation of <a href="Mount%20Meru">Mount Meru</a>, the home of the gods: the central <a href="quincunx">quincunx</a> of towers symbolises the five peaks of the mountain, and the walls and moat symbolise the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean. Access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level.

Unlike most Khmer temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west rather than the east. This has led many (including <a href="Maurice%20Glaize">Maurice Glaize</a> and <a href="George%20Coed%C3%A8s">George Coedès</a>) to conclude that Suryavarman intended it to serve as his funerary temple. Further evidence for this view is provided by the <a href="Relief%23Bas-relief%20or%20low%20relief">bas-reliefs</a>, which proceed in a counter-clockwise direction—"<a href="Mandir">prasavya</a>" in Hindu terminology—as this is the reverse of the normal order. Rituals take place in reverse order during Brahminic funeral services. The archaeologist <a href="Charles%20Higham%20%28archaeologist%29">Charles Higham</a> also describes a container which may have been a funerary jar which was recovered from the central tower. It has been nominated by some as the greatest expenditure of energy on the disposal of a corpse. Freeman and Jacques, however, note that several other temples of <a href="Angkor">Angkor</a> depart from the typical eastern orientation, and suggest that Angkor Wat's alignment was due to its dedication to <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>, who was associated with the west.

A further interpretation of Angkor Wat has been proposed by Eleanor Mannikka. Drawing on the temple's alignment and dimensions, and on the content and arrangement of the bas-reliefs, she argues that the structure represents a claimed new era of peace under King <a href="Suryavarman%20II">Suryavarman II</a>: "as the measurements of solar and lunar time cycles were built into the sacred space of Angkor Wat, this divine mandate to rule was anchored to consecrated chambers and corridors meant to perpetuate the king's power and to honour and placate the deities manifest in the heavens above." Mannikka's suggestions have been received with a mixture of interest and scepticism in academic circles. She distances herself from the speculations of others, such as <a href="Graham%20Hancock">Graham Hancock</a>, that Angkor Wat is part of a representation of the constellation <a href="Draco%20%28constellation%29">Draco</a>.

The Angkor Wat temple's main tower aligns to the morning sun of the <a href="Spring%20Equinox">Spring Equinox</a>.

Angkor Wat is the prime example of the classical style of <a href="Khmer%20architecture">Khmer architecture</a>—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has given its name. By the 12th century Khmer architects had become skilled and confident in the use of <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> (rather than brick or <a href="laterite">laterite</a>) as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural <a href="resin">resin</a>s or <a href="slaked%20lime">slaked lime</a> has been suggested.

The temple has drawn praise above all for the harmony of its design. According to Maurice Glaize, a mid-20th-century conservator of Angkor, the temple "attains a classic perfection by the restrained monumentality of its finely balanced elements and the precise arrangement of its proportions. It is a work of power, unity and style."

Architecturally, the elements characteristic of the style include: the <a href="Ogive">ogival</a>, redented towers shaped like <a href="Nelumbo%20nucifera">lotus</a> buds; half-<a href="Architecture%20of%20Cambodia%23Gallery">galleries</a> to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are <a href="Architecture%20of%20Cambodia%23Apsara%20and%20devata">devatas (or apsaras)</a>, <a href="bas-relief">bas-relief</a>s, and on <a href="pediment">pediment</a>s extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work. Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including <a href="gilding">gilded</a> <a href="stucco">stucco</a> on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.

The outer wall, by and high, is surrounded by a apron of open ground and a moat wide and over 5 kilometres (3 mi) in perimeter. Access to the temple is by an earth bank to the east and a sandstone causeway to the west; the latter, the main entrance, is a later addition, possibly replacing a wooden bridge. There are <a href="Architecture%20of%20Cambodia%23Gopura">gopuras</a> at each of the <a href="cardinal%20point">cardinal point</a>s; the western is by far the largest and has three ruined towers. Glaize notes that this gopura both hides and echoes the form of the temple proper. Under the southern tower is a statue of <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>, known as "Ta Reach", which may originally have occupied the temple's central shrine. Galleries run between the towers and as far as two further entrances on either side of the gopura often referred to as "elephant gates", as they are large enough to admit those animals. These galleries have square pillars on the outer (west) side and a closed wall on the inner (east) side. The ceiling between the pillars is decorated with <a href="Nelumbo%20nucifera">lotus</a> rosettes; the west face of the wall with dancing figures; and the east face of the wall with balustered windows, dancing male figures on prancing animals, and <a href="Architecture%20of%20Cambodia%23Apsara%20and%20devata">devatas</a>, including (south of the entrance) the only one in the temple to be showing her teeth.

The outer wall encloses a space of 820,000 square metres (203 acres), which besides the temple proper was originally occupied by the city and, to the north of the temple, the royal palace. Like all secular buildings of Angkor, these were built of perishable materials rather than of stone, so nothing remains of them except the outlines of some of the streets. Most of the area is now covered by forest. A causeway connects the western gopura to the temple proper, with <a href="Architecture%20of%20Cambodia%23Naga">naga</a> balustrades and six sets of steps leading down to the city on either side. Each side also features a <a href="Architecture%20of%20Cambodia%23Library">library</a> with entrances at each cardinal point, in front of the third set of stairs from the entrance, and a pond between the library and the temple itself. The ponds are later additions to the design, as is the cruciform terrace guarded by lions connecting the causeway to the central structure.

The temple stands on a terrace raised higher than the city. It is made of three rectangular <a href="Architecture%20of%20Cambodia%23Gallery">galleries</a> rising to a central tower, each level higher than the last. Mannikka interprets these galleries as being dedicated to the king, <a href="Brahma">Brahma</a>, the moon, and <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>. Each gallery has a <a href="gopura">gopura</a> at each of the points, and the two inner galleries each have towers at their corners, forming a <a href="Architecture%20of%20Cambodia%23Quincunx">quincunx</a> with the central tower. Because the temple faces west, the features are all set back towards the east, leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side; for the same reason the west-facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides.

The outer gallery measures by , with pavilions rather than towers at the corners. The gallery is open to the outside of the temple, with columned half-galleries extending and buttressing the structure. Connecting the outer gallery to the second enclosure on the west side is a cruciform cloister called "Preah Poan" (the "Hall of a Thousand Gods"). <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Buddha</a> images were left in the cloister by pilgrims over the centuries, although most have now been removed. This area has many inscriptions relating the good deeds of pilgrims, most written in <a href="Khmer%20language">Khmer</a> but others in <a href="Burmese%20language">Burmese</a> and Japanese. The four small courtyards marked out by the cloister may originally have been filled with water. North and south of the cloister are <a href="Architecture%20of%20Cambodia%23Library">libraries</a>.

Beyond, the second and inner galleries are connected to each other and to two flanking libraries by another cruciform terrace, again a later addition. From the second level upwards, <a href="Architecture%20of%20Cambodia%23Apsara%20and%20devata">devatas</a> abound on the walls, singly or in groups of up to four. The second-level enclosure is by , and may originally have been flooded to represent the <a href="ocean">ocean</a> around <a href="Mount%20Meru">Mount Meru</a>. Three sets of steps on each side lead up to the corner towers and gopuras of the inner gallery. The very steep stairways represent the difficulty of ascending to the kingdom of the gods. This inner gallery, called the "Bakan", is a square with axial galleries connecting each gopura with the central shrine, and subsidiary shrines located below the corner towers. The roofings of the galleries are decorated with the motif of the body of a snake ending in the heads of lions or <a href="garuda">garuda</a>s. Carved <a href="Architecture%20of%20Cambodia%23Lintels%20and%20pediments">lintels and pediments</a> decorate the entrances to the galleries and to the shrines.
The tower above the central shrine rises to a height of above the ground; unlike those of previous temple mountains, the central tower is raised above the surrounding four. The shrine itself, originally occupied by a statue of Vishnu and open on each side, was walled in when the temple was converted to <a href="Theravada%20Buddhism">Theravada Buddhism</a>, the new walls featuring standing Buddhas. In 1934, the conservator George Trouvé excavated the pit beneath the central shrine: filled with sand and water it had already been robbed of its treasure, but he did find a sacred foundation deposit of <a href="gold%20leaf">gold leaf</a> two metres above ground level.

Integrated with the architecture of the building, and one of the causes for its fame is Angkor Wat's extensive decoration, which predominantly takes the form of <a href="bas-relief">bas-relief</a> friezes. The inner walls of the outer gallery bear a series of large-scale scenes mainly depicting episodes from the Hindu epics the <a href="Ramayana">Ramayana</a> and the <a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>. Higham has called these, "the greatest known linear arrangement of stone carving". From the north-west corner anti-clockwise, the western gallery shows the Battle of Lanka (from the Ramayana, in which <a href="Rama">Rama</a> defeats <a href="Ravana">Ravana</a>) and the <a href="Kurukshetra%20War">Battle of Kurukshetra</a> (from the Mahabharata, showing the mutual annihilation of the <a href="Kaurava">Kaurava</a> and <a href="Pandava">Pandava</a> clans). On the southern gallery follow the only historical scene, a procession of <a href="Suryavarman%20II">Suryavarman II</a>, then the 32 <a href="hell">hell</a>s and 37 <a href="heaven">heaven</a>s of Hinduism.
On the eastern gallery is one of the most celebrated scenes, the <a href="Kurma">Churning of the Sea of Milk</a>, showing 92 <a href="asura">asura</a>s and 88 <a href="deva%20%28Hinduism%29">devas</a> using the serpent <a href="Vasuki%20%28snake%29">Vasuki</a> to churn the sea under Vishnu's direction (Mannikka counts only 91 asuras, and explains the asymmetrical numbers as representing the number of days from the <a href="winter%20solstice">winter solstice</a> to the <a href="spring%20equinox">spring equinox</a>, and from the equinox to the summer <a href="solstice">solstice</a>). It is followed by Vishnu defeating <a href="asura">asura</a>s (a 16th-century addition). The northern gallery shows Krishna's victory over <a href="Banasura">Bana</a> (where according to Glaize, "The workmanship is at its worst").

Angkor Wat is decorated with depictions of <a href="apsaras">apsaras</a> and <a href="devata">devata</a>; there are more than 1,796 depictions of devata in the present research inventory. Angkor Wat architects employed small apsara images (–) as decorative motifs on pillars and walls. They incorporated larger devata images (all full-body portraits measuring approximately –) more prominently at every level of the temple from the entry pavilion to the tops of the high towers. In 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair, headdresses, garments, stance, jewellery and decorative flowers, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period.

The stones, as smooth as polished marble, were laid without mortar with very tight joints that are sometimes hard to find. The blocks were held together by <a href="mortise%20and%20tenon">mortise and tenon</a> joints in some cases, while in others they used dovetails and gravity. The blocks were presumably put in place by a combination of elephants, <a href="coir">coir</a> ropes, pulleys and <a href="bamboo%20scaffolding">bamboo scaffolding</a>. Henri Mouhot noted that most of the blocks had holes in diameter and deep, with more holes on the larger blocks. Some scholars have suggested that these were used to join them together with iron rods, but others claim they were used to hold temporary pegs to help manoeuvre them into place.

The monument was made out of 5 million to 10 million sandstone blocks with a maximum weight of 1.5 tons each. In fact, the entire city of <a href="Angkor">Angkor</a> used up far greater amounts of stone than all the Egyptian pyramids combined, and occupied an area significantly greater than modern-day <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. Moreover, unlike the Egyptian pyramids which use limestone quarried barely away all the time, the entire city of Angkor was built with sandstone quarried (or more) away. This sandstone had to be transported from Mount Kulen, a quarry approximately to the northeast. The route has been suggested to span along a canal towards <a href="Tonl%C3%A9%20Sap">Tonlé Sap</a> lake, another crossing the lake, and finally against the current along <a href="Siem%20Reap%20River">Siem Reap River</a>, making a total journey of . However, Etsuo Uchida and Ichita Shimoda of <a href="Waseda%20University">Waseda University</a> in <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a> have discovered in 2011 a shorter canal connecting Mount Kulen and Angkor Wat using satellite imagery. The two believe that the Khmer used this route instead.

Virtually all of its surfaces, columns, lintels and even roofs are carved. There are miles of reliefs illustrating scenes from <a href="Indian%20literature">Indian literature</a> including unicorns, griffins, winged dragons pulling chariots as well as warriors following an elephant-mounted leader and celestial dancing girls with elaborate hair styles. The gallery wall alone is decorated with almost 1,000 square metres of bas reliefs. Holes on some of the Angkor walls indicate that they may have been decorated with bronze sheets. These were highly prized in ancient times and were a prime target for robbers. While excavating Khajuraho, Alex Evans, a stonemason and sculptor, recreated a stone sculpture under , this took about 60 days to carve. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehner also conducted experiments to quarry limestone which took 12 quarrymen 22 days to quarry about 400 tons of stone. The labour force to quarry, transport, carve and install so much sandstone must have run into the thousands including many highly skilled artisans. The skills required to carve these sculptures were developed hundreds of years earlier, as demonstrated by some artefacts that have been dated to the seventh century, before the Khmer came to power.

As with most other ancient temples in Cambodia, Angkor Wat has faced extensive damage and deterioration by a combination of plant overgrowth, fungi, ground movements, war damage and theft. The war damage to Angkor Wat's temples however has been very limited, compared to the rest of Cambodia's temple ruins, and it has also received the most attentive restoration.

The restoration of Angkor Wat in the modern era began with the establishment of the Conservation d'Angkor (Angkor Conservancy) by the <a href="%C3%89cole%20fran%C3%A7aise%20d%27Extr%C3%AAme-Orient">École française d'Extrême-Orient</a> (EFEO) in 1908; before that date, activities at the site were primarily concerned with exploration. The Conservation d'Angkor was responsible for the research, conservation, and restoration activities carried out at Angkor until the early 1970s, and a major restoration of Angkor was undertaken in the 1960s. However, work on Angkor was abandoned during the Khmer Rouge era and the Conservation d'Angkor was disbanded in 1975. Between 1986 and 1992, the <a href="Archaeological%20Survey%20of%20India">Archaeological Survey of India</a> carried out restoration work on the temple, as France did not recognise the Cambodian government at the time. Criticism has been raised about both the early French restoration attempts and particularly the later Indian work, with concerns over damage done to the stone surface by the use of chemicals and cement.

In 1992, following an appeal for help by <a href="Norodom%20Sihanouk">Norodom Sihanouk</a>, Angkor Wat was listed in UNESCO's <a href="World%20Heritage%20in%20Danger">World Heritage in Danger</a> (later removed in 2004) and <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> together with an appeal by UNESCO to the international community to save Angkor. Zoning of the area was set up to protect the Angkor site in 1994, <a href="APSARA">APSARA</a> was established in 1995 to protect and manage the area, and a law to protect Cambodian heritage was passed in 1996. A number of countries such as France, Japan and China are currently involved in various Angkor Wat conservation projects. The <a href="German%20Apsara%20Conservation%20Project">German Apsara Conservation Project</a> (GACP) is working to protect the <a href="Architecture%20of%20Cambodia%23Apsaras%20and%20devatas">devatas</a>, and other bas-reliefs which decorate the temple, from damage. The organisation's survey found that around 20% of the devatas were in very poor condition, mainly because of natural erosion and deterioration of the stone but in part also due to earlier restoration efforts. Other work involves the repair of collapsed sections of the structure, and prevention of further collapse: the west facade of the upper level, for example, has been buttressed by scaffolding since 2002, while a Japanese team completed restoration of the north library of the outer enclosure in 2005. <a href="World%20Monuments%20Fund">World Monuments Fund</a> began conservation work on the Churning of the Sea of Milk Gallery in 2008 after several years of studies on its condition. The project restored the traditional Khmer roofing system and removed cement used in earlier restoration attempts that had resulted in <a href="Efflorescence">salts entering the structure</a> behind the bas-relief, discoloring and damaging the sculpted surfaces. The main phase of work ended in 2012, with the final component being the installation of finials on the roof of the gallery in 2013.

Microbial biofilms have been found degrading sandstone at Angkor Wat, Preah Khan, and the Bayon and West Prasat in Angkor. The dehydration- and radiation-resistant filamentous cyanobacteria can produce organic acids that degrade the stone. A dark filamentous fungus was found in internal and external <a href="Preah%20Khan">Preah Khan</a> samples, while the alga "<a href="Trentepohlia%20%28alga%29">Trentepohlia</a>" was found only in samples taken from external, pink-stained stone at Preah Khan. Replicas were also made to replace some of the lost or damaged sculptures.

Since the 1990s, Angkor Wat has become a major tourist destination. In 1993, there were only 7,650 visitors to the site; by 2004, government figures show that 561,000 foreign visitors had arrived in Siem Reap province that year, approximately 50% of all foreign tourists in Cambodia. The number reached over a million in 2007, and over two million by 2012. Most visited Angkor Wat, which received over two million foreign tourists in 2013. The site has been managed by the private <a href="Sokimex">SOKIMEX</a> group since 1990, which rented it from the <a href="Cambodian%20government">Cambodian government</a>. The influx of tourists has so far caused relatively little damage, other than some <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a>; ropes and wooden steps have been introduced to protect the bas-reliefs and floors, respectively. Tourism has also provided some additional funds for maintenance—as of 2000 approximately 28% of ticket revenues across the whole <a href="Angkor">Angkor</a> site was spent on the temples—although most work is carried out by teams sponsored by foreign governments rather than by the Cambodian authorities.

Since Angkor Wat has seen significant growth in tourism throughout the years, <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> and its International Co-ordinating Committee for the Safeguarding and Development of the Historic Site of Angkor (ICC), in association with representatives from the Royal Government and <a href="APSARA">APSARA</a>, organised seminars to discuss the concept of "cultural tourism". Wanting to avoid commercial and mass tourism, the seminars emphasised the importance of providing high quality accommodation and services in order for the Cambodian government to benefit economically, while also incorporating the richness of Cambodian culture. In 2001, this incentive resulted in the concept of the "Angkor Tourist City" which would be developed with regard to traditional Khmer architecture, contain leisure and tourist facilities, and provide luxurious hotels capable of accommodating large numbers of tourists.

The prospect of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism developments in the area have neglected construction regulations and more of these projects have the potential to damage landscape features. Also, the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems. It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has had a direct effect on the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat. Locals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism. Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture.

At the <a href="ASEAN">ASEAN</a> Tourism Forum 2012, it was agreed that <a href="Borobudur">Borobudur</a> and Angkor Wat would become sister sites and the provinces sister provinces.

USS Kearsarge (BB-5)

USS "Kearsarge" (BB-5), the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a> of <a href="Kearsarge-class%20battleship">her class</a> of <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s, was a <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> ship, named after the <a href="sloop-of-war">sloop-of-war</a> . Her keel was laid down by the <a href="Newport%20News%20Shipbuilding">Newport News Shipbuilding Company</a> of <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, on 30 June 1896. She was <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 24 March 1898, sponsored by Mrs. Elizabeth Winslow (née Maynard), the wife of Rear Admiral <a href="Herbert%20Winslow">Herbert Winslow</a>, and <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 20 February 1900.

Between 1903 and 1907 "Kearsarge" served in the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Fleet">North Atlantic Fleet</a>, and from 1907 to 1909 she sailed as part of the <a href="Great%20White%20Fleet">Great White Fleet</a>. In 1909 she was decommissioned for modernization, which was finished in 1911. In 1915 she served in the Atlantic, and between 1916 and 1919 she served as a training ship. She was converted into a <a href="crane%20ship">crane ship</a> in 1920, renamed "Crane Ship No. 1" in 1941, and sold for <a href="scrap">scrap</a> in 1955. She was the only United States Navy battleship to not be named after a state.

The "Kearsarge"-class battleships were designed to be used for coastal defense. They had a displacement of , an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of . The two 3-cylinder <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">vertical triple-expansion steam engines</a> and five <a href="Scotch%20marine%20boiler">Scotch boilers</a>, connected to two propeller shafts, produced a total of , and gave a maximum speed of . "Kearsarge" was manned by 40 officers and 514 enlisted men, a total of 554 crew.
"Kearsarge" had two double <a href="Gun%20turret">turrets</a>, with two <a href="13%26quot%3B/35%20caliber%20gun">/35 caliber guns</a> and two <a href="8%26quot%3B/40%20caliber%20gun">/40 caliber guns</a> each, stacked in two levels. The guns and turret armor were designed by the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Ordnance">Bureau of Ordnance</a>, while the turret itself was designed by the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Construction%20and%20Repair">Bureau of Construction and Repair</a>. This caused the guns to be mounted far back in the turret, making the ports very large. Admiral <a href="William%20Sims">William Sims</a> claimed that as a result, a shell fired into the port could reach the <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> below, disabling the guns. In addition to these guns, "Kearsarge" carried fourteen <a href="5%26quot%3B/40%20caliber%20gun">/40 caliber guns</a>, twenty <a href="6-pounder%20gun">6-pounder</a> () guns, eight <a href="QF%201%20pounder%20pom-pom">1-pounder</a> () guns, four machine guns, and four <a href="American%2018%20inch%20torpedo">18 inch (450 mm)</a> <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s. "Kearsarge" had a very low <a href="freeboard%20%28nautical%29">freeboard</a>, which resulted in her guns becoming unusable in bad weather.

The ship's <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="belt%20armor">armor belt</a> was thick and the main gun turrets were protected by of armor, while the secondary turrets had of armor. The <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s were thick, while the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> had of armor. The armor was made of <a href="Harvey%20armor">harveyized steel</a>.

"Kearsarge" carried 16 smaller boats. A steam <a href="Cutter%20%28boat%29">cutter</a>, with a capacity of 60 men, together with a steam cutter, were used for general carrying from and to port, and could tow the other boats if needed. Two 33-foot <a href="Launch%20%28boat%29">launches</a>, each capable of carrying 64 men, were the "working boats". There were ten boats: four cutters, each with a capacity of 45 men, the Admiral's <a href="barge">barge</a>, two <a href="whaleboat">whaleboat</a>s (which served as <a href="Lifeboat%20%28rescue%29">lifeboats</a>), and the <a href="Captain%27s%20gig">Captain's gig</a>. Four smaller boats completed "Kearsarge"s small fleet: two <a href="Dinghy">dinghies</a> and two <a href="catamaran">catamaran</a>s.

"Kearsarge" was authorized on 2 March 1895, the contract for her construction was awarded on 2 January 1896, and the keel of the vessel was laid down on 30 June 1896 by <a href="Newport%20News%20Shipbuilding%20%26amp%3B%20Dry%20Dock%20Company">Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company</a> in <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>. The total cost was US$5,043,591.68. She was named soon after the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> sloop-of-war , and was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named by act of <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a>. She was the only US battleship not named after a state. She was christened on 24 March 1898 (the same day as her sister ship, <a href="USS%20Kentucky%20%28BB-6%29">"Kentucky"</a>) by Mrs. Elizabeth Winslow (née Maynard), the wife of Captain <a href="Herbert%20Winslow">Herbert Winslow</a>, daughter-in-law of Captain <a href="John%20Ancrum%20Winslow">John Ancrum Winslow</a>, the commander of the original "Kearsarge". She was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 20 February 1900, under the command of <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">Captain</a> <a href="William%20M.%20Folger">William M. Folger</a>.

As <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Squadron">North Atlantic Squadron</a>, "Kearsarge" sailed along the <a href="Atlantic%20seaboard">Atlantic seaboard</a> and the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>. In May 1901 Captain <a href="Bowman%20H.%20McCalla">Bowman H. McCalla</a> assumed command of "Kearsarge", although by May 1902 the ship was being commanded by Captain <a href="Joseph%20Newton%20Hemphill">Joseph Newton Hemphill</a>. Reassigned as flagship of the <a href="European%20Squadron">European Squadron</a>, she sailed from <a href="Sandy%20Hook">Sandy Hook</a> on 3 June 1903, on her way to <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>, Germany. She was visited by Emperor <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Wilhelm II of Germany</a> on 25 June, and by the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a> – who would later become King <a href="George%20V">George V of the United Kingdom</a> – on 13 July.

"Kearsarge" returned to <a href="Bar%20Harbor%2C%20Maine">Bar Harbor, Maine</a> on 26 July, and resumed her position as flagship. On 1 December the ship sailed from New York for <a href="Guant%C3%A1namo%20Bay">Guantánamo Bay</a>, Cuba, where she was present as the United States took formal possession of the <a href="Guantanamo%20Naval%20Reservation">Guantanamo Naval Reservation</a> on 10 December. On 26 March 1904 Captain <a href="Raymond%20P.%20Rodgers">Raymond P. Rodgers</a> assumed command of the ship. Following maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea, "Kearsarge" left with the North Atlantic Squadron for <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>, where she met King <a href="Carlos%20I%20of%20Portugal">Carlos I of Portugal</a> on 11 June 1904. <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Independence Day</a> was celebrated in <a href="Phaleron%20Bay">Phaleron Bay</a>, Greece, with King <a href="George%20I%20of%20Greece">George I of Greece</a> and his son and daughter-in-law, <a href="Prince%20Andrew%20of%20Greece%20and%20Denmark">Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark</a> and <a href="Princess%20Alice%20of%20Battenberg">Princess Alice of Battenberg</a>. The squadron visited <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a>, <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a>, and <a href="Fiume">Fiume</a> before returning to <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>, on 29 August 1904.

On 31 March 1905, replaced "Kearsarge" as flagship of the North Atlantic Fleet, although she remained with the fleet. Captain Herbert Winslow took command of the ship during December. On 13 April 1906, while participating in an exercise off <a href="Cape%20Cruz">Cape Cruz</a>, Cuba, the <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a> in a 13-inch gun ignited accidentally, killing two officers and eight men.

Attached to the Fourth Division of the Second Squadron, and under command of Captain Hamilton Hutchins, she sailed on 16 December 1907 with the <a href="Great%20White%20Fleet">Great White Fleet</a>. The fleet left from <a href="Hampton%20Roads">Hampton Roads</a>, passed by <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a> and <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, and then passed through the <a href="Straits%20of%20Magellan">Straits of Magellan</a>. From there she passed by the west coast of South America, visiting <a href="Punta%20Arenas">Punta Arenas</a> and <a href="Valpara%C3%ADso">Valparaíso</a>, Chile, <a href="Callao">Callao</a>, Peru, and <a href="Magdalena%20Bay%2C%20Mexico">Magdalena Bay, Mexico</a>. The fleet reached San Diego on 14 April 1908 and moved on to San Francisco on 6 May. Two months later the warships sailed for <a href="Honolulu%2C%20Hawaii">Honolulu, Hawaii</a>, and from there to <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, New Zealand, arriving 9 August. The fleet made <a href="Sydney%2C%20Australia">Sydney, Australia</a>, on 20 August, and after a week sailed for Melbourne.

"Kearsarge" departed <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany, Western Australia</a>, on 18 September for ports in the <a href="Philippine%20Islands">Philippine Islands</a>, Japan, China, and <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a> before transiting the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>. The fleet split at <a href="Port%20Said">Port Said</a>, with "Kearsarge" leaving on 10 January 1909 for <a href="Malta">Malta</a>, and arriving in <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a> on 24 January, before reforming with the fleet at <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on 1 February. She returned to Hampton Roads on 22 February, and was inspected by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. President</a> <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>.

As with most of the Great White Fleet ships, "Kearsarge" was modernized on her return. She was decommissioned at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Naval%20Shipyard">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</a> on 4 September 1909, and the modernization was completed in 1911, at a cost of US$675,000. The ship received <a href="Lattice%20mast">cage masts</a>, new <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s, and another four 5-inch guns. The <a href="QF%201-pounder%20pom-pom%23United%20States">1-pounder</a> guns were removed, as were sixteen of the <a href="QF%206-pounder%20Hotchkiss%23American%20service">6-pounder</a>s. She was recommissioned on 23 June 1915, and operated along the Atlantic coast. On 17 September she left Philadelphia to land a detachment of <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">US Marines</a> at <a href="Veracruz%2C%20Veracruz">Veracruz, Mexico</a>, remaining there from 28 September 1915 to 5 January 1916. She then carried the Marines to <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, before joining the <a href="Atlantic%20Reserve%20Fleet">Atlantic Reserve Fleet</a> at Philadelphia on 4 February. Until the United States joined <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, she trained <a href="naval%20militia">naval militia</a> from Massachusetts and Maine. During the war she was used to train Armed Guard crews and <a href="naval%20engineer">naval engineer</a>s during cruises along the Atlantic seaboard. On 18 August 1918 "Kearsarge" rescued 26 survivors of the Norwegian <a href="barque">barque</a> "Nordhav" which had been sunk by , bringing them to Boston.

Between 29 May and 29 August 1919, "Kearsarge" trained <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> <a href="Midshipman">midshipmen</a> in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. "Kearsarge" sailed from <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a> to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she decommissioned on either 10 May or 18 May 1920.

"Kearsarge" was converted into a <a href="crane%20vessel">crane ship</a>, and was given <a href="hull%20classification%20symbol">hull classification symbol</a> IX-16 on 17 July 1920, but it was changed to AB-1 on 5 August. Her turrets, superstructure, and armor were removed, and were replaced by a large revolving crane with a lifting capacity of 250 tons (230 tonnes), as well as blisters, which improved her stability. The crane ship was utilized often over the next 20 years, including the raising of in 1939.

On 6 November 1941, "Kearsarge" was renamed "Crane Ship No. 1", allowing her name to be given to , and later to . She continued her service, however, handling guns, turrets, armor, and other heavy lifts for vessels such as , , , , and .

She was transferred to the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Naval%20Shipyard">San Francisco Naval Shipyard</a> in 1945, where she participated in the construction of "Hornet" and and the re-construction of . One of her last projects was performing heavy lifts during the reassembly of another crane vessel, <a href="Herman%20the%20German%20%28crane%20vessel%29">YD-171</a> (ex-"Schwimmkran nr. 1") on <a href="Terminal%20Island">Terminal Island</a>. In 1948 she left the West Coast for the <a href="Boston%20Naval%20Shipyard">Boston Naval Shipyard</a>. On 22 June 1955 her name was struck from the <a href="Naval%20Vessel%20Register">Naval Vessel Register</a>, and she was sold for scrap on 9 August. The "Kearsarge"' figurehead is on display in Dahlgren Hall at the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a>.

USS New Jersey (BB-62)

USS "New Jersey" (BB-62) ("Big J" or "Black Dragon") is an , and was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named after the US state of <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>. "New Jersey" earned more <a href="battle%20star">battle star</a>s for combat actions than the other three completed "Iowa"-class battleships, and was the only US battleship providing gunfire support during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, "New Jersey" shelled targets on <a href="Guam">Guam</a> and <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>, and screened aircraft carriers conducting raids in the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a>. During the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, she was involved in raids up and down the <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>n coast, after which she was <a href="Ship%20decommissioning">decommissioned</a> into the <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20reserve%20fleets">United States Navy reserve fleets</a>, better known as the "mothball fleet". She was briefly reactivated in 1968 and sent to Vietnam to support US troops before returning to the mothball fleet in 1969. Reactivated once more in the 1980s as part of the <a href="600-ship%20Navy">600-ship Navy</a> program, "New Jersey" was modernized to carry missiles and recommissioned for service. In 1983, she participated in US operations during the <a href="Lebanese%20Civil%20War">Lebanese Civil War</a>.

"New Jersey" was decommissioned for the last time in 1991 (after serving a total of 21 years in the active fleet), having earned a <a href="Navy%20Unit%20Commendation">Navy Unit Commendation</a> for service in Vietnam and 19 battle and campaign stars for combat operations during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Lebanese Civil War, and service in the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>. After a brief retention in the mothball fleet, she was donated to the Home Port Alliance in <a href="Camden%2C%20New%20Jersey">Camden, New Jersey</a>, and began her career as a <a href="museum%20ship">museum ship</a> 15 October 2001.

"New Jersey" was one of the "<a href="fast%20battleship">fast battleship</a>" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Construction%20and%20Repair">Bureau of Construction and Repair</a>. She was <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 7 December 1942 (the first anniversary of the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>) and <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 23 May 1943. The ship was the second of the "Iowa" class to be commissioned by the <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a>. The ship was christened at her launching by Carolyn Edison, wife of Governor <a href="Charles%20Edison">Charles Edison</a> of New Jersey, himself a former <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a>; and commissioned at <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> 23 May 1943, Captain <a href="Carl%20F.%20Holden">Carl F. Holden</a> in command.

"New Jersey"s main battery consisted of nine <a href="16%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20Mark%207%20gun">16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun</a>s in three three-gun turrets, which could fire armor-piercing shells some . Her secondary battery consisted of twenty <a href="5%26quot%3B/38%20caliber%20gun">5"/38 caliber gun</a>s mounted in twin-gun <a href="dual%20purpose%20gun">dual purpose</a> (DP) turrets, which could hit targets up to away. With the advent of air power and the need to gain and maintain <a href="air%20superiority">air superiority</a> came a need to protect the growing fleet of allied aircraft carriers, so "New Jersey" was fitted with an array of <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">Oerlikon 20 mm</a> and <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun">Bofors 40 mm</a> <a href="anti-aircraft%20artillery">anti-aircraft guns</a>. When reactivated in 1968, "New Jersey" had her 20 mm and 40 mm AA guns removed and was tailored for use as a heavy bombardment ship. When reactivated in 1982, "New Jersey" had four twin 5"/38 caliber DP mounts removed. She was outfitted with four <a href="Phalanx%20CIWS">Phalanx CIWS</a> mounts for protection against missiles and aircraft, and eight <a href="Armored%20Box%20Launcher">Armored Box Launcher</a>s and eight Quad Cell Launchers designed to fire <a href="Tomahawk%20missile">Tomahawk missile</a>s and <a href="Harpoon%20missile">Harpoon missile</a>s, respectively.

The main deck was 53,000 square feet of <a href="teak">teak</a>.

Unlike the other "Iowa"-class battleships, "New Jersey" was named by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> to repay a political debt, to then-New Jersey Governor <a href="Charles%20Edison">Charles Edison</a>. During his time in the Navy department, Edison pushed to build the "Iowa"s, and to build one at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Navy%20Yard">Philadelphia Navy Yard</a>, which secured votes for Roosevelt in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201940">1940 presidential election</a>.

"New Jersey" completed fitting out and trained her initial crew in the Western <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> and <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>. On 7 January 1944 she passed through the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> war-bound for <a href="Funafuti">Funafuti</a>, <a href="Ellice%20Islands">Ellice Islands</a>. She reported there 22 January for duty with the <a href="United%20States%20Fifth%20Fleet">United States Fifth Fleet</a>, and three days later rendezvoused with <a href="Task%20Group%2058.2">Task Group 58.2</a> for the <a href="Marshall%20Islands%20campaign">assault on the Marshall Islands</a>. "New Jersey" screened the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s from <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> attack as planes from Task Group 58.2 flew strikes against <a href="Kwajalein">Kwajalein</a> and <a href="Eniwetok">Eniwetok</a> 29 January – 2 February, softening up the latter for its invasion and supporting the troops who landed on 31 January.

"New Jersey" began her career as a <a href="flagship">flagship</a> 4 February in <a href="Majuro">Majuro</a> Lagoon when <a href="Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Admiral</a> <a href="Raymond%20A.%20Spruance">Raymond A. Spruance</a>, commanding the 5th Fleet, broke his flag from her main. Her first action as a flagship was in <a href="Operation%20Hailstone">Operation Hailstone</a>, a two-day surface and air strike by her task force against the major Japanese fleet base on <a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Truk</a> in the <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Carolines</a>. This attack was coordinated with the assault on Kwajalein, and effectively interdicted the Japanese naval retaliation to the conquest of the Marshalls. On 17 and 18 February, the task force accounted for two Japanese <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s, four <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, three <a href="auxiliary%20cruiser">auxiliary cruiser</a>s, two <a href="submarine%20tender">submarine tender</a>s, two <a href="submarine%20chaser">submarine chaser</a>s, an <a href="Naval%20trawler">armed trawler</a>, a plane ferry, and 23 other auxiliaries, not including small craft. "New Jersey" destroyed a trawler and, with other ships, sank the destroyer . "New Jersey" also fired on an enemy aircraft that attacked her formation. The task force returned to the Marshalls 19 February.

Between 17 March and 10 April, "New Jersey" first sailed with <a href="Rear%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Marc%20A.%20Mitscher">Marc A. Mitscher</a>'s flagship for an air and surface bombardment of <a href="Mili%20Atoll">Mille</a>, then rejoined Task Group 58.2 for a strike against shipping in the <a href="Palau">Palau</a>s, and bombarded <a href="Woleai">Woleai</a>. Upon his return to Majuro, Admiral Spruance transferred his flag to .

"New Jersey"s next war cruise, 13 April – 4 May 1944, began and ended at Majuro. She screened the carrier striking force which gave air support to the invasion of <a href="Aitape">Aitape</a>, <a href="Tanahmerah%20Bay">Tanahmerah Bay</a> and <a href="Teluk%20Yos%20Sudarso">Humboldt Bay</a>, <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, 22 April, then shelled shipping and shore installations at Truk 29 April – 30 April. "New Jersey" and her formation shot down two enemy <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s at Truk. Her 16-inch salvos pounded <a href="Pohnpei">Ponape</a> 1 May, destroying <a href="fuel%20tank">fuel tank</a>s, badly damaging the <a href="airfield">airfield</a>, and demolishing a headquarters building.

After rehearsing in the Marshalls for the invasion of the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Marianas</a>, "New Jersey" put to sea 6 June in the screening and bombardment group of Admiral Mitscher's Task Force. On the second day of preinvasion air strikes, 12 June, "New Jersey" shot down an enemy torpedo bomber, and during the next two days her heavy guns battered <a href="Battle%20of%20Saipan">Saipan</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Tinian">Tinian</a>, in advance of the marine landings on 15 June.

The Japanese response to the Marianas operation was an order to its main surface fleet to attack and annihilate the American invasion force. Shadowing American <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s tracked the Japanese fleet into the <a href="Philippine%20Sea">Philippine Sea</a> as Admiral Spruance joined his task force with Admiral Mitscher's to meet the enemy. "New Jersey" took station in the protective screen around the carriers on 19 June 1944 as American and Japanese pilots dueled in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Philippine%20Sea">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a>. That day and the next would cripple Japanese naval aviation; in what would become known as the "Marianas Turkey Shoot", the Japanese lost some 400 planes for less than two dozen American aircraft in return. This loss of trained pilots and aircraft was equaled in disaster by the sinking of the Japanese aircraft carriers and by the submarines and , respectively, and the loss of to aircraft launched from the light aircraft carrier . In addition to these losses, Allied forces succeeded in damaging two Japanese carriers and a battleship. The anti-aircraft fire of "New Jersey" and the other screening ships proved virtually impenetrable; two American ships were slightly damaged during the battle. Only 17 American planes were lost in combat.

"New Jersey"s final contribution to the conquest of the Marianas was in strikes on Guam and the Palaus from which she sailed for <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, arriving 9 August. Here she broke the flag of Admiral <a href="William%20F.%20Halsey%2C%20Jr.">William F. Halsey, Jr.</a>, 24 August, becoming flagship of the <a href="United%20States%20Third%20Fleet">United States Third Fleet</a>. On 30 August "New Jersey" set sail from Pearl Harbor, and for the next eight months was based at <a href="Ulithi">Ulithi</a> to lend support to Allied forces operating in the Philippines. In this span of the Pacific War, fast carrier task forces ranged the waters off the Philippines, Okinawa, and <a href="Taiwan">Formosa</a>, making repeated strikes at airfields, shipping, shore bases, and invasion beaches.

In September the targets were in the <a href="Visayas">Visayas</a> and the southern Philippines, then <a href="Manila">Manila</a> and <a href="Cavite">Cavite</a>, <a href="Panay%20Island">Panay</a>, <a href="Negros%20Island">Negros</a>, <a href="Leyte%20Island">Leyte</a>, and <a href="Cebu%20Island">Cebu</a>. Early in October raids to destroy enemy air power based on Okinawa and Formosa were begun in preparation for the Leyte landings of 20 October 1944.

This invasion brought on the last great <a href="sortie">sortie</a> of the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>. Its plan for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a> included a <a href="feint">feint</a> by a northern force of planeless heavy attack carriers to draw away the battleships, cruisers and fast carriers with which Admiral Halsey was protecting the landings. This was to allow the Japanese Center Force to enter the gulf through <a href="San%20Bernardino%20Strait">San Bernardino Strait</a>. At the opening of the battle planes from the carriers guarded by "New Jersey" struck hard at both the Japanese Southern and Center Forces, sinking a battleship 23 October. The next day Halsey shaped his course north after the decoy force had been spotted. Planes from his carriers sank four of the Japanese carriers, as well as a destroyer and a cruiser, while "New Jersey" steamed south at <a href="flank%20speed">flank speed</a> to meet the newly developed threat of the Center force. It had been <a href="Battle%20off%20Samar">turned back in a stunning defeat</a> when she arrived.
"New Jersey" rejoined her fast carriers near San Bernardino 27 October 1944 for strikes on central and southern <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a>. Two days later, the force came under suicide attack. In a melee of anti-aircraft fire from the ships and combat air patrol, "New Jersey" shot down a plane whose pilot maneuvered it into the port gun galleries of , while machine gun fire from "Intrepid" wounded three of "New Jersey's" men. During a similar action 25 November three Japanese planes were shot down by the combined fire of the force, part of one flaming onto the flight deck of . "Intrepid" was again attacked; she shot down one would-be kamikaze aircraft, but was crashed by another despite hits scored on the attacker by "New Jersey" gunners. "New Jersey" shot down a plane diving on and hit another plane which smashed into "Cabot"s port bow.

On 18 December 1944 the ships of <a href="Fast%20Carrier%20Task%20Force">Task Force 38</a> unexpectedly found themselves in a fight for their lives when <a href="Typhoon%20Cobra%20%281944%29">Typhoon Cobra</a> overtook the force— seven fleet and six light carriers, eight battleships, 15 cruisers, and about 50 destroyers— during their attempt to refuel at sea. At the time the ships were operating about east of Luzon in the Philippine Sea. The carriers had just completed three days of heavy raids against Japanese airfields, suppressing enemy aircraft during the American <a href="amphibious%20assault">amphibious operations</a> against <a href="Mindoro">Mindoro</a> in the Philippines. The task force rendezvoused with <a href="Captain%20%28U.S.%20Navy%29">Captain</a> Jasper T. Acuff and his fueling group 17 December with the intention of refueling all ships in the task force and replacing lost aircraft.

Although the sea had been growing rougher all day, the nearby cyclonic disturbance gave relatively little warning of its approach. Each of the carriers in the Third Fleet had a weatherman aboard, and as the fleet flagship "New Jersey" had a highly experienced weatherman: Commander G. F. Kosco, a graduate of the aerology course at <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> who had also studied hurricanes in the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>; despite this, none of these individuals or staffs were able to give Third Fleet due warning of the impending typhoon. On 18 December, the small but violent typhoon overtook the Task Force while many of the ships were attempting to refuel. Many of the ships were caught near the center of the storm and buffeted by extreme seas and hurricane-force winds. Three destroyers—, and —capsized and sank with nearly all hands, while a cruiser, five aircraft carriers, and three destroyers suffered serious damage. Approximately 790 officers and men were lost or killed, with another 80 injured. Fires occurred in three carriers when planes broke loose in their hangars, and some 146 planes on various ships were lost or damaged beyond economical repair by fires, impact damage, or by being swept overboard. As with the other battleships of TF 38, skillful seamanship brought "New Jersey" through the storm largely unscathed. She returned to Ulithi on Christmas Eve to be met by Fleet Admiral <a href="Chester%20Nimitz">Chester Nimitz</a>.
"New Jersey" ranged far and wide from 30 December 1944 to 25 January 1945 on her last cruise as Admiral Halsey's flagship. She guarded the carriers in their strikes on Formosa, Okinawa, and Luzon, on the coast of <a href="Indo-China">Indo-China</a>, Hong Kong, <a href="Shantou">Swatow</a> and <a href="Amoy">Amoy</a>, and again on Formosa and Okinawa. At Ulithi 27 January Admiral Halsey lowered his flag in "New Jersey", but it was replaced two days later by that of Rear Admiral <a href="Oscar%20C.%20Badger%20II">Oscar C. Badger II</a> commanding <a href="Battleship%20Division%207">Battleship Division 7</a>.

In support of the assault on <a href="Iwo%20Jima">Iwo Jima</a>, "New Jersey" screened the group in air attacks on the island 19 February – 21 February, and gave the same crucial service for the first major carrier raid on Tokyo 25 February, a raid aimed specifically at aircraft production. During the next two days, Okinawa was attacked from the air by the same striking force.

"New Jersey" was directly engaged in the conquest of Okinawa from 14 March until 16 April. As the carriers prepared for the invasion with strikes there and on <a href="Honsh%C5%AB">Honshū</a>, "New Jersey" fought off air raids, used her <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a>s to rescue downed pilots, defended the carriers from suicide planes, shooting down at least three and assisting in the destruction of others. On 24 March 1945 she again carried out the role of heavy bombardment, preparing the invasion beaches for the assault a week later.

During the final months of the war, "New Jersey" was overhauled at <a href="Puget%20Sound%20Naval%20Shipyard">Puget Sound Naval Shipyard</a>, from which she sailed 4 July for <a href="San%20Pedro%2C%20California">San Pedro</a>, Pearl Harbor, and Eniwetok bound for Guam. Here on 14 August she once again became flagship of the 5th Fleet under Admiral Spruance. Brief stays at Manila and Okinawa preceded her arrival in <a href="Tokyo%20Bay">Tokyo Bay</a> 17 September, where she served as flagship for the successive commanders of Naval Forces in Japanese waters until relieved 28 January 1946 by (BB-61). As part of the ongoing <a href="Operation%20Magic%20Carpet">Operation Magic Carpet</a> "New Jersey" took aboard nearly a thousand homeward-bound troops with whom she arrived at San Francisco 10 February.

After west coast operations and a normal overhaul at Puget Sound, "New Jersey"s keel once more cut the Atlantic as she came home to <a href="Bayonne%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bayonne, New Jersey</a>, for a rousing fourth birthday party 23 May 1947. Present were Governor Alfred E. Driscoll, former Governor Walter E. Edge and other dignitaries.

Between 7 June and 26 August, "New Jersey" formed part of the first training squadron to cruise Northern European waters since the beginning of World War II. Over two thousand <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> and <a href="NROTC">NROTC</a> midshipmen received seagoing experience under the command of Admiral Richard L. Connolly, Commander Naval Forces Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, who broke his flag in "New Jersey" at <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a>, Scotland 23 June. She was the scene of official receptions at <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, where King <a href="Haakon%20VII%20of%20Norway">Haakon VII of Norway</a> inspected the crew 2 July, and at <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>, England. The training fleet was westward bound 18 July for exercises in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic.

After serving at New York as flagship for Rear Admiral Heber H. McLean, Commander, Battleship Division 1, 12 September – 18 October, "New Jersey" was inactivated at the <a href="New%20York%20Naval%20Shipyard">New York Naval Shipyard</a>. She was decommissioned at Bayonne 30 June 1948 and assigned to the New York Group, <a href="Atlantic%20Reserve%20Fleet">Atlantic Reserve Fleet</a>.

In 1950 <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a> invaded South Korea, prompting the United States to intervene in the name of the United Nations. President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> was caught off guard when the invasion struck, but quickly ordered U.S. Forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent U.S. based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization "New Jersey" was recalled from the mothball fleet to provide seaborne artillery support for U.N. and South Korean troops. "New Jersey" was recommissioned at Bayonne on 21 November 1950, Captain David M. Tyree in command, and proceeded to the Caribbean, where she welded her crew into an efficient body which would meet the demanding requirements of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. She sailed from <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a> 16 April 1951 and arrived from Japan off the east coast of Korea 17 May. Vice Admiral Harold M. Martin, commanding the <a href="United%20States%20Seventh%20Fleet">United States Seventh Fleet</a>, placed his flag in "New Jersey" for the next six months.

"New Jersey"s guns opened the first shore bombardment of her Korean career at <a href="Wonsan">Wonsan</a> 20 May. During her two tours of duty in Korean waters, she was again and again to play the part of seaborne mobile artillery. In direct support to United Nations troops; or in preparation for ground actions, in interdicting Communist supply and communication routes, or in destroying supplies and troop positions, "New Jersey" used her 16-inch guns to fire far beyond the capacity of land artillery, moved rapidly and free from major attack from one target to another, and at the same time could be immediately available to guard aircraft carriers should they require her protection. It was on this first such mission at Wonsan that she received her only combat casualties of the Korean War. One of her men was killed and two severely wounded when she took a hit from a <a href="artillery%20battery">shore battery</a> on her number one turret and received a near miss <a href="aft">aft</a> to port.
Between 23 and 27 May and again 30 May 1951, "New Jersey" pounded targets near <a href="Yangyang%20County">Yangyang</a> and <a href="Kansong">Kansong</a>, dispersing troop concentrations, dropping a <a href="Span%20%28architecture%29">bridge span</a>, and destroying three large ammunition dumps. Air spotters reported Yangyang abandoned at the end of this action, while railroad facilities and vehicles were smashed at Kansong. On 24 May, she lost one of her <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a>s after the crew pushed their chopper to the limit of its fuel searching for a downed aviator. The helicopter crew was able to reach friendly territory and were later returned to their ship.

With Admiral <a href="Arthur%20W.%20Radford">Arthur W. Radford</a>, Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet, and Vice Admiral <a href="C.%20Turner%20Joy">C. Turner Joy</a>, Commander Naval Forces Far East aboard, "New Jersey" bombarded targets at Wonsan 4 June. At Kansong two days later she fired her main battery at an artillery regiment and truck encampment, with 7th Fleet aircraft spotting targets and reporting successes. On 28 July off Wonsan the battleship was again taken under fire by shore batteries. Several near misses splashed to port, but "New Jersey"s precision fire silenced the enemy and destroyed several gun emplacements.

Between 4 and 12 July, "New Jersey" supported a United Nations push in the Kansong area, firing at enemy buildup and reorganization positions. As the <a href="Republic%20of%20Korea">Republic of Korea</a>'s First Division hurled itself on the enemy, shore fire control observers saw "New Jersey"s salvos hit directly on enemy <a href="mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortar</a> emplacements, supply and ammunition dumps, and personnel concentrations. "New Jersey" returned to Wonsan 18 July for an exhibition of perfect firing: five gun emplacements demolished with five direct hits.

"New Jersey" sailed to the aid of troops of the Republic of Korea once more 17 August, returning to the Kansong area where for four days she provided harassing fire by night, and broke up counterattacks by day, inflicting a heavy toll on enemy troops. She returned to this general area yet again 29 August, when she fired in an amphibious demonstration staged behind enemy lines to ease pressure on the Republic of Korea's troops. The next day she started a three-day saturation of the <a href="Changjon">Changjon</a> area, with one of her own helicopters spotting the results: four buildings destroyed, road junctions smashed, railroad marshaling yards afire, tracks cut and uprooted, coal stocks scattered, and many buildings and warehouses set blazing.

Aside from a brief break in firing 23 September to take aboard wounded from the , damaged by gunfire, "New Jersey" was heavily engaged in bombarding the Kansong area, supporting the movement of the <a href="U.S.%20X%20Corps">U.S. X Corps</a>. The pattern again was harassing fire by night, destruction of known targets by day. Enemy movement was restricted by the fire of her big guns. A bridge, a dam, several gun emplacements, mortar positions, <a href="Bunker%23Pillbox">pillbox</a>es, <a href="bunker">bunker</a>s, and two ammunition dumps were demolished.

On 1 October 1951, General <a href="Omar%20Bradley">Omar Bradley</a>, Chairman of the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>, and General <a href="Matthew%20B.%20Ridgeway">Matthew B. Ridgeway</a>, Commander in Chief Far East, came on board to confer with Admiral Martin.

Between 1 and 6 October "New Jersey" was in action daily at Kansong, <a href="Hamhung">Hamhung</a>, <a href="Hungnam">Hungnam</a>, <a href="Tanchon">Tanchon</a>, and <a href="Songjin">Songjin</a>. Enemy bunkers and supply concentrations provided the majority of the targets at Kansong; at the others "New Jersey" fired on railroads, tunnels, bridges, an <a href="oil%20refinery">oil refinery</a>, trains, and shore batteries. She also engaged an enemy gun emplacement with her five-inch (127 mm) gun mounts, which "New Jersey" successfully destroyed. The Kojo area was her target 16 October as she sailed in company with , pilots from spotting. The operation was well-planned and coordinated, and excellent results were obtained.

Another highly satisfactory day was 16 October, when the spotter over the Kansong area reported "beautiful shooting every shot on target-most beautiful shooting I have seen in five years." This five-hour bombardment leveled ten <a href="artillery">artillery</a> positions, and in smashing <a href="trench">trench</a>es and bunkers inflicted some 500 enemy casualties.

"New Jersey" dashed up the North Korean coast raiding transportation facilities from 1 to 6 November. She struck at bridges, road, and rail installations at Wonsan, Hungnam, Tanchon, <a href="Iowon">Iowon</a>, Songjin, and Chongjin, leaving four bridges destroyed, others badly damaged, two marshaling yards badly torn up, and many feet of track destroyed. With renewed attacks on Kansong and near the <a href="Chang-San-Got%20Peninsula">Chang-San-Got Peninsula</a> 11 and 13 November, "New Jersey" completed her first tour of duty in Korea.

Relieved as flagship by , "New Jersey" cleared <a href="U.S.%20Fleet%20Activities%20Yokosuka">Yokosuka</a> for Hawaii, <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach</a> and the Panama Canal, and returned to Norfolk 20 December for a six-month overhaul. Between 19 July 1952 and 5 September, she sailed as flagship for Rear Admiral H. R. Thurber, who commanded the NROTC midshipman training cruise to <a href="Cherbourg-Octeville">Cherbourg</a>, Lisbon, and the Caribbean. Now "New Jersey" prepared and trained for her second Korean tour, for which she sailed from Norfolk 5 March 1953.
Shaping her course via the Panama Canal, Long Beach, and Hawaii, New Jersey reached Yokosuka 5 April, and next day relieved as flagship of Vice Admiral Joseph H. Clark, Commander 7th Fleet. On 12 April "New Jersey" returned to action by shelling Chongjin; in seven minutes she scored seven direct hits, blowing away half the main communications building there. At <a href="Pusan">Pusan</a> two days later, "New Jersey" manned her rails to welcome the <a href="President%20of%20South%20Korea">President of the Republic of Korea</a> and Madame Rhee, and American Ambassador Ellis O. Briggs.

"New Jersey" fired on coastal batteries and buildings at Kojo 16 April; on railway track and tunnels near Hungnam 18 April; and on gun emplacements around <a href="Wonsan%20Harbor">Wonsan Harbor</a> 20 April, silencing them in five areas after she had herself taken several near misses. Songjin provided targets 23 April. Here "New Jersey" scored six direct 16 inch (406 mm) hits on a railroad tunnel and knocked out two rail bridges.

"New Jersey" provided artillery support for a major air and surface strike on Wonsan 1 May, as 7th Fleet planes both attacked the enemy and spotted for the battleship. She knocked out eleven Communist shore guns that day, and four days later destroyed the key observation post on the island of <a href="Hodo%20Pando">Hodo Pando</a>, commanding the harbor. Two days later <a href="Kalmagak">Kalmagak</a> at Wonsan was her target.

"New Jersey"s tenth birthday, 23 May 1953, was celebrated at <a href="Incheon">Incheon</a> with President and Madame Rhee, Lieutenant General <a href="Maxwell%20D.%20Taylor">Maxwell D. Taylor</a>, and other dignitaries on board. Two days later "New Jersey" returned to action along the west coast at <a href="Chinampo">Chinampo</a> to knock out harbor defense positions.
The battleship was under fire at Wonsan 27 May – 29 May, but her five-inch (127 mm) guns silenced the counter-fire, and her 16-inch shells destroyed five gun emplacements and four gun caves. She also hit a target that flamed spectacularly: either a <a href="oil%20depot">fuel storage area</a> or an <a href="ammunition%20dump">ammunition dump</a>.

"New Jersey" returned to the key task of direct support to troops at <a href="Kosong">Kosong</a> 7 June. On her first mission, she completely destroyed two gun positions, an observation post, and their supporting trenches, then stood by on call for further aid. She then sailed back to Wonsan for a day-long bombardment 24 June, aimed at guns placed in caves. The results were excellent, with eight direct hits on three caves, one cave demolished, and four others closed. Next day she returned to troop support at Kosong, her assignment until 10 July, aside from necessary withdrawal for replenishment.

At Wonsan 11 July – 12 July, "New Jersey" fired one of the most concentrated bombardments of her Korean duty. For nine hours the first day, and for seven the second, her guns opened fire on gun positions and bunkers on Hodo Pando and the mainland with telling effect. At least ten enemy guns were destroyed, many damaged, and a number of caves and tunnels sealed. "New Jersey" smashed radar control positions and bridges at Kojo 13 July, and was once more on the east coast bombline 22 July – 24 July to support South Korean troops near Kosong. These days found her gunners at their most accurate: A large cave, housing an important enemy observation post was closed, the end of a month-long United Nations effort, and a great many bunkers, artillery areas, observation posts, trenches, tanks and other weapons were destroyed.

At sunrise on 25 July 1953 "New Jersey" was off the key port, rail and communications center of Hungnam, pounding coastal guns, bridges, a factory area, and oil storage tanks. She sailed north that afternoon, firing at rail lines and railroad tunnels as she made for Tanchon, where she launched a <a href="whaleboat">whaleboat</a> in an attempt to spot a train known to run nightly along the coast. Her big guns were trained on two tunnels between which she hoped to catch the train, but in the darkness she could not see the results of her six-gun salvo.

"New Jersey's" mission at Wonsan, the next day, was her last. Here she destroyed large-caliber guns, bunkers, caves and trenches. Two days later, she learned of the truce. Her crew celebrated during a seven-day visit at Hong Kong, where she anchored 20 August. Operations around Japan and off Formosa were carried out for the remainder of her tour, which was highlighted by a visit to Pusan. Here president Rhee came aboard on 16 September to present the <a href="Presidential%20Unit%20Citation%20%28Korea%29">Korean Presidential Unit Citation</a> to the 7th Fleet.

Relieved as flagship at Yokosuka by "Wisconsin" 14 October, "New Jersey" was homeward bound the next day, reaching Norfolk on 14 November. During the next two summers she crossed the Atlantic with <a href="midshipmen">midshipmen</a> on board for training, and during the rest of the year sharpened her skills with exercises and training maneuvers along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean.

"New Jersey" stood out of Norfolk 7 September 1955 for her first tour of duty with the <a href="United%20States%20Sixth%20Fleet">United States Sixth Fleet</a> in the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>. Her ports of call included <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, <a href="Valencia%20%28city%20in%20Spain%29">Valencia</a>, <a href="Cannes">Cannes</a>, <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, <a href="Souda%20Bay">Souda Bay</a>; and <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. She returned to Norfolk 7 January 1956 for the spring program of training operations. That summer she again carried midshipmen to Northern Europe for training, bringing them home to <a href="Annapolis">Annapolis</a> 31 July. "New Jersey" sailed for Europe once more 27 August as flagship of Vice Admiral Charles Wellborn, Jr., Commander <a href="United%20States%20Second%20Fleet">United States Second Fleet</a>. She called at Lisbon, participated in <a href="NATO">NATO</a> exercises off Scotland, and paid an official visit to Norway where Crown Prince <a href="Olav%20V%20of%20Norway">Olav</a> was a guest. She returned to Norfolk 15 October, and 14 December arrived at New York Naval Shipyard for inactivation. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Bayonne 21 August 1957.

Due to heavy loss rates of U.S. aircraft (commencing with <a href="Operation%20Rolling%20Thunder">Operation Rolling Thunder</a> in 1965), studies were conducted on ways of alleviating those air losses while at the same time delivering the ordnance payloads required by the escalation of the war. On 31 May 1967 the Secretary of Defense <a href="Robert%20McNamara">Robert McNamara</a> authorized a study aimed at determining what would be required to get "New Jersey" reactivated in her present condition, and when the results of the submitted study proved favorable toward the reactivation he took action. In August 1967 the Secretary of Defense made the decision to recommission a battleship "for employment in the Pacific Fleet to augment the naval gunfire support force in Southeast Asia". "New Jersey" was selected for this task because she was in better material condition than her sisters, having received an extensive overhaul prior to decommissioning. Upon her reactivation she underwent a period of modernization during which the 20 mm and 40 mm anti-aircraft guns on the battleship were removed, and she received improved electronic warfare systems and improvements to her radar. Armed as such "New Jersey" was formally recommissioned 6 April 1968 at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Naval%20Shipyard">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</a>, Captain <a href="J.%20Edward%20Snyder">J. Edward Snyder</a> in command. During sea trials following her modernization, "New Jersey" set the battleship world speed record by achieving a speed of 35.2 knots (62.5 kph/40.5 mph), maintaining this speed for six hours.

"New Jersey", then the world's only active battleship, departed Philadelphia 16 May, calling at Norfolk and transiting the Panama Canal 4 June before arriving at her new home port of Long Beach, California, 11 June. Further training off Southern California followed. On 24 July "New Jersey" received 16 inch shells and powder tanks from by conventional highline transfer and by helicopter lift, the first time heavy battleship ammunition had been transferred by helicopter at sea (now known as <a href="vertical%20replenishment">vertical replenishment</a>).
Departing Long Beach 2 September, "New Jersey" touched at Pearl Harbor and <a href="U.S.%20Naval%20Base%20Subic%20Bay">Subic Bay</a> before sailing 25 September for her first tour on the "<a href="wikt%3Agun%20line">gun line</a>" along the Vietnamese coast. Near the 17th parallel on 30 September, the battleship fired her first shots in battle in over sixteen years, expending a total of 29 sixteen inch rounds against <a href="People%27s%20Army%20of%20Vietnam">People's Army of Vietnam</a> (PAVN) targets in and near the <a href="Vietnamese%20Demilitarized%20Zone">Demilitarized Zone</a> (DMZ) at the 17th parallel.

"New Jersey" took up station off <a href="C%E1%BB%93n%20C%E1%BB%8F%20District">Tiger Island</a> 1 October and fired at targets north of the DMZ before moving south that afternoon to engage <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a> targets. She accounted for six bunkers, a supply truck and an anti-aircraft site that day; additionally, she helped rescue the crew of a Marine spotting plane forced down at sea by anti-aircraft fire. On 3 October "New Jersey" fired on targets south of Tiger Island, and on 4 October the battleship fired on a Communist troop concentration and destroyed several bunkers. On the evening of 7 October "New Jersey" received reports that a number of waterborne logistics craft were moving south near the mouth of the Song Giang River. "New Jersey" responded by closing on the formation, and succeeded in sinking eleven of the craft before they could beach.

On 11 October "New Jersey" engaged a coastal installation with her guns; however, she shifted her fire when a recon plane spotting for the battleship reported an enemy truck concentration north of Nha Ky. "New Jersey" gunners quickly retrained the battleship's big guns and managed to inflict heavy damage on six of the vehicles.

Early on the morning of 12 October "New Jersey" trained her guns in anticipation of shelling the heavily fortified and well protected Vinh caves. For the next three days "New Jersey" pounded the area with her 16 in shells in an effort to eliminate the Viet Cong presence in the region. Aided by spotter aircraft from the aircraft carrier , "New Jersey" engaged enemy targets, setting several enemy positions on fire and sealing one cave. On 14 October "New Jersey" shifted her gunfire to the coastal artillery sites on Hon Matt Island, destroying one battery on the island.

On 16 October "New Jersey" took up station in support of the <a href="3rd%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 3rd Marine Division</a>. Using both the 16 in and 5 in guns "New Jersey" engaged and destroyed 13 structures and an artillery site, in the process halting an enemy platoon moving through the DMZ. "New Jersey" continued to lend firepower support on the 17th until departing to lend her gunfire to the First Field Force. Foul weather prevented spotter aircraft from flying until 20 October; however, "New Jersey" quickly made up for lost time on the gun line by destroying a Viet Cong command post and nine bunkers in support of the <a href="173d%20Airborne%20Brigade%20%28United%20States%29">173rd Airborne Brigade</a>, who were operating about north of Nha Trang. The next day "New Jersey" maneuvered into the waters of the Baie de Van Fong to fire at Viet Cong command posts, but poor visibility of the target area prevented any damage estimates.

On the night of 23 October "New Jersey" steamed north to rearm before taking up position in support of the 3rd Marine Division 25 October. That day she shelled enemy troops located by a spotter plane. The next day "New Jersey" engaged targets of opportunity, destroying 11 structures, seven bunkers, a concrete observation tower, and an enemy trench line. She also received hostile fire when North Vietnamese gunners attempted to strike at "New Jersey" with artillery positioned near Cap Lay. Some ten to twelve rounds were launched at "New Jersey"; however, the rounds fired landed well short of the battleship. Aerial spotters were called in to look at the suspected gun position; they reported no artillery present but fresh tire tracks leading to a concealed area, suggesting that there had been artillery there earlier. Armed with this information "New Jersey" fired five 16 inch shells at the site, but in the darkness spotters were unable to confirm any hits.

On 28 October "New Jersey" steamed south to engage Communist targets. During the shelling aircraft spotting for the battleship reported taking heavy anti-aircraft fire to the extreme north of the target zone; subsequently, "New Jersey" altered her fire to silence the site with her big guns. The next day "New Jersey" leveled 30 structures, destroyed three underground bunkers, and shelled a Viet Cong trench line. That afternoon an aerial observer located an enemy artillery position on a hilltop southwest of Cap Lay. "New Jersey" responded by firing six 16 inch rounds at the site, destroying it. Follow up assaults on 30 October destroyed a Communist resupply area and an anti-aircraft site.

Upon completion of this mission "New Jersey" steamed south, taking a position off <a href="Da%20Nang">Da Nang</a> and Point DeDe to lend naval gunfire support to the <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 1st Marine Division</a> operating in the area. On 2 November "New Jersey" commenced firing operations against nine positions, but the heavy foliage in the area prevented spotters from seeing the results of the shelling.

On 4 November "New Jersey" received orders to reinforce southern <a href="II%20Corps%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">II Corps</a> near <a href="Phan%20Thi%E1%BA%BFt">Phan Thiết</a>; she arrived on station later that night. The next day she answered eight call for fire support missions from the 173rd Airborne Brigade, in the process destroying eight Viet Cong bunkers and five structures. On 11 November "New Jersey" departed Vietnamese waters to replenish; she returned to the gunline 23 November and relieved , taking up position in support of the U.S. Army's <a href="Americal%20Division">Americal Division</a>. That afternoon "New Jersey"s 5 inch guns shelled enemy buildings, destroying 15 structures and inflicted heavy damage on 29 others.

On 25 November "New Jersey" launched the most destructive shore bombardment of her Vietnam tour. For the next two days the battleship concentrated her fire at Viet Cong storage areas near <a href="Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20Ng%C3%A3i">Quảng Ngãi</a>, destroying 182 structures and 54 bunkers, inflicting heavy damage to 93 structures, and demolishing several tunnel complexes before departing for Point Betsy near Hue 27 November to support the <a href="101st%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">101st Airborne Division</a>.

Between 2 and 8 December "New Jersey" returned to aid the 3rd Marine Division, shelling Viet Cong bunker complexes for the Marines operating around the Da Nang area before departing for Singapore 9 December. On 26 December "New Jersey" returned to the gunline, taking up station off <a href="Tuy%20H%C3%B2a">Tuy Hòa</a> in support of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> 47th Regiment. For the next three days "New Jersey" fired her guns to support the II Corps, in the process destroying Viet Cong bunkers and supply depots and neutralizing enemy cave posts. "New Jersey" would remain in the waters of the DMZ until after <a href="New%20Years">New Years</a>, shelling Communist bunkers for ground troops until leaving to support the 1st Marine Division 3 January.
Throughout January and into February "New Jersey" operated in support of the Marines. On 10 February the battleship left to reinforce the <a href="2nd%20Marine%20Division%20%28Republic%20of%20Korea%29">Korean 2nd Marine Brigade</a> operating near Da Nang. The battleship's target was a suspected subterranean staging area for a Viet Cong regiment. "New Jersey"s big guns went to work on the complex, firing 16 inch shells into tunnels and bunkers to aid the ground troops. On 14 February the battleship steamed south of the DMZ to provide support for the 3rd Marine Division, in the process destroying an anti-aircraft site with her big guns. The next day "New Jersey" fired on an enemy rocket site northeast of <a href="Con%20Thien">Con Thien</a>, destroying the facility, then trained her guns on known Communist positions to harass PAVN forces. On 22 February "New Jersey" responded to an urgent request for fire support from the besieged <a href="Ocean%20View%2C%20Viet%20Nam">Oceanview observation post</a> near the DMZ. For the next six hours "New Jersey" fired her guns, ultimately repelling the attacking force.

For the remainder of February and into March "New Jersey" shelled targets along the DMZ. On 13 March the battleship departed the gunline bound for Subic Bay. She returned to action on 20 March, operating near <a href="Cam%20Ranh%20Bay">Cam Ranh Bay</a> in support of the Korean <a href="9th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Republic%20of%20Korea%29">9th Infantry Division</a>. For the next week "New Jersey" patrolled the waters between Phan Thiet and Tuy Hoa, shelling targets of opportunity along the coast. On 28 March "New Jersey" took up station south of the DMZ to aid the 3rd Marine Division, remaining there until 1 April, whereupon "New Jersey" departed for Japan. During the battleship's tour of duty along the "gunline" in Vietnam, "New Jersey" had fired 5,688 rounds of 16 inch shells, and 14,891 rounds of 5-inch shells.

Her first Vietnam combat tour completed, "New Jersey" departed Subic Bay 3 April 1969 for Japan. She arrived at Yokosuka for a two-day visit, sailing for the United States 9 April. Her homecoming, however, was to be delayed. On the 15th, while "New Jersey" was still at sea, North Korean jet fighters <a href="EC-121%20shootdown%20incident">shot down</a> an unarmed <a href="EC-121%20Constellation">EC-121 Constellation</a> electronic surveillance plane over the <a href="Sea%20of%20Japan">Sea of Japan</a>, killing its entire crew. A carrier task force was formed and sent to the Sea of Japan, while "New Jersey" was ordered to come about and steam toward Japan. On the 22nd she arrived once more at Yokosuka, and immediately put to sea in readiness for what might befall.

As the crisis eased, "New Jersey" was released to continue her interrupted voyage. She anchored at Long Beach 5 May 1969, her first visit to her home port in eight months. Through the summer months, "New Jersey"s crew toiled to make her ready for another deployment, and deficiencies discovered on the gun line were remedied. According to official reports, though, reasons of economy were to dictate otherwise: on 22 August 1969 the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">United States Secretary of Defense</a> released a list of names of ships to be inactivated; at the top of the list was "New Jersey". Five days later, Captain Snyder was relieved of command by Captain <a href="Robert%20C.%20Peniston">Robert C. Peniston</a>.

Assuming command of a ship already earmarked for the "<a href="reserve%20fleet">mothball fleet</a>", Captain Peniston and his crew prepared for their task. "New Jersey" got underway on the voyage 6 September, departing Long Beach for Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. She arrived on the 8th, and began preinactivation overhaul to ready herself for decommissioning. On 17 December 1969 "New Jersey"s colors were hauled down and she entered the inactive fleet, following the words of her last commanding officer: "Rest well, yet sleep lightly; and hear the call, if again sounded, to provide fire power for freedom."

As part of president <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s and Navy Secretary <a href="John%20Lehman">John Lehman</a>'s effort to create a <a href="600-ship%20Navy">600-ship Navy</a>, "New Jersey" was selected for reactivation in the spring of 1981, and she was towed from <a href="Puget%20Sound%20Naval%20Shipyard">Puget Sound Naval Shipyard</a> to <a href="Long%20Beach%20Naval%20Shipyard">Long Beach Naval Shipyard</a> at the end of July 1981 for modernization/reactivation. 

At the time of the reactivation the Navy envisioned using "New Jersey" and her sister ship "Iowa" to meet sustained global requirements and relieve the strain on the Navy created by an increase in U.S. commitments to the Indian Ocean and <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> regions. During this time the Navy developed several proposals to update their battleships to carry cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as point defense system mounts. Preliminary modernizations schemes included the removal of four of the ten 5 inch gun mounts on "New Jersey" to make room for the armored box launchers that would be required to carry and launch the BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles. At one point the NATO <a href="Sea%20Sparrow">Sea Sparrow</a> was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the overpressure effects when firing the main battery.

On 28 December 1982 "New Jersey" was formally recommissioned at Long Beach, California, her new homeport. The recommissioning of "New Jersey" marked a return of the world's last battleships after a 13-year absence from the world's oceans.
"New Jersey"s modernization was unique in that she was to be the only reactivated "Iowa"-class battleship to lose a gun turret. At the time the Navy made the announcement plans were underway to remove "New Jersey"s No. 3 16 in gun turret (located aft of the superstructure). In its place the Navy planned to install one of two systems: a <a href="vertical%20launch%20system">vertical launching missile magazine</a> which would have enabled "New Jersey" to carry an additional 48 Tomahawk or Harpoon missiles, or using the space generated by a removed gun turret for aircraft related updates centering on <a href="VTOL">VTOL</a> or <a href="V/STOL">V/STOL</a> type aircraft. These ideas were ultimately dropped, and "New Jersey" retained her No. 3 gun turret during her 1980s career.
Over the next several months the ship was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available; among the new weapons systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 <a href="Harpoon%20missile">AGM-84 Harpoon</a> anti-ship missiles, eight Armored Box Launcher (ABL) mounts for 32 <a href="BGM-109%20Tomahawk">BGM-109 Tomahawk</a> <a href="missile">missile</a>s, and a quartet of the United States Navy's <a href="Phalanx%20CIWS">Phalanx</a> <a href="Close-in%20weapon%20system">Close in Weapon System (CIWS)</a> <a href="Gatling%20gun">Gatling gun</a>s for defense against enemy <a href="anti-ship%20missile">anti-ship missile</a>s and enemy aircraft. "New Jersey" also received eight <a href="RQ-2%20Pioneer">RQ-2 Pioneer</a> <a href="Unmanned%20Aerial%20Vehicle">Unmanned Aerial Vehicle</a>s, which are remotely controlled drones that replaced the helicopters previously used to spot for her nine 16"/50 Mark 7 guns. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to <a href="radar">radar</a> and <a href="fire%20control%20system">fire control system</a>s for her guns and missiles, and improved <a href="electronic%20warfare">electronic warfare</a> capabilities.

Because "New Jersey" had been recalled for service in the Vietnam War her modernization differed from her sisters for a number of reasons. When reactivated in 1967 "New Jersey" had her <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">20 mm Oerlikon</a> and <a href="Bofors%2040mm%20gun">40 mm Bofors</a> anti-aircraft guns removed, and received improved electronic warfare capabilities. This alteration helped reduce the time it took get "New Jersey" recommissioned: since she was not in her World War II format the only major physical alteration to "New Jersey" involved the removal of four of her ten 5 inch gun mounts to make room for the Armored Box Launchers. In addition to saving time, this also made "New Jersey" cheaper to reactivate since the cost needed to modernize the battleship only included the addition of missile and gun system mounts, electronic warfare suites, and improved radar and gun spotter technology.

Since the Tomahawk missile system had not yet been adopted for use during "New Jersey"s original update the Navy announced plans to divert assets from two of their s to install the necessary Tomahawk launchers. Similarly, assets were diverted from two <a href="guided%20missile%20destroyer">guided missile destroyer</a>s to allow for the installation of Harpoon launchers on "New Jersey".

In 1983, a bloody <a href="Lebanese%20civil%20war">civil war</a> was raging in <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>. In an effort to stop the violence in the region a <a href="Multinational%20Force%20in%20Lebanon">Multinational Force</a> of <a href="Peacekeeping">peacekeeper</a>s composed largely of U.S., Italian and French armed service members was created and sent to the region to attempt a restoration of order. As part of the multinational force the United States mobilized an expeditionary force composed of members of the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> and elements of the United States Sixth Fleet which operated out of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>.

On 18 April 1983 <a href="1983%20United%20States%20embassy%20bombing">a van carrying a 2,000 pound load of explosives, slammed into the U.S. embassy in West Beirut, killing 63</a>. In August 1983, <a href="Israel">Israel</a> withdrew its <a href="Israel%20Defense%20Forces">Defense Forces</a> from the <a href="Chouf%20District">Chouf District</a> (southeast of Beirut), thus removing the buffer between the <a href="Druze">Druze</a> and the Christian militias and triggering another round of brutal fighting. In August 1983 militiamen began to bombard United States Marines positions near Beirut International Airport with mortar and rocket fire as the Lebanese Army fought Druze and Shia forces in the southern suburbs of Beirut. On 29 August 1983, two Marines were killed and fourteen wounded, and in the ensuing months the Marines came under almost daily attack from artillery, mortar, rocket, and small-arms fire. After this attack the Marines began returning fire. The Reagan Administration decided to dispatch "New Jersey", a decision the Marines cheered.

On 16 September 1983 Druze forces massed on the threshold of <a href="Suk%20El%20Gharb">Suk El Gharb</a>, a village defended by the Lebanese Army. Suk El Gharb was a village with strategic importance: the militias coming up from the south had to traverse Suk El Gharb to get to the Beirut–Aley road. Moreover, Suk El Gharb controlled a ridge that overlooked <a href="Baabda%2C%20Yarze">Baabda, Yarze</a>, which was the location of the Ministry of Defence, and East Beirut. From that ridge, the Militia gunners could shoot directly downhill at those locations with artillery. United States Navy warships shelled Druze positions and helped the Lebanese Army hold the town of Suk El Gharb until a cease-fire was declared on 25 September, on which day the battleship "New Jersey" arrived on the scene. The arrival of "New Jersey" was one of several factors contributing to a reduction in the number of attacks on the Marines.

On 28 November—after 23 October <a href="1983%20Beirut%20barracks%20bombing">1983 Beirut barracks bombing</a>—the U.S. government announced that "New Jersey" would be retained off Beirut although her crew would be rotated. On 14 December, "New Jersey" fired 11 projectiles from her 16-inch (406 mm) guns at hostile positions inland of Beirut. These were the first 16-inch (406 mm) shells fired for effect anywhere in the world since "New Jersey" ended her time on the gunline in Vietnam in 1969.
This shelling was in response to attacks on U.S. reconnaissance planes by Syrian/Druze antiaircraft batteries.

Carrying on a tradition he had begun in World War II of spending Christmas with U.S. forces overseas, <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a> and his troupe of entertainers gave a show on board the "New Jersey" on 24 December 1983. Four hundred Marines stationed in Beirut attended the show.

On 8 February 1984, "New Jersey" fired almost 300 shells at Druze and Shi'ite positions in the hills overlooking Beirut. Some 30 of these massive projectiles rained down on a Syrian command post in the <a href="Bekaa%20Valley">Bekaa Valley</a> east of Beirut, killing the general commanding Syrian forces in Lebanon and several other senior officers. This was the heaviest shore bombardment since the Korean War.

Although "New Jersey" performed her job expertly during the intervention in Lebanon some have criticized the decision to have "New Jersey" shell Druze and Syrian forces. Members of this camp allege that this action forced a shift in the previously neutral U.S. forces by convincing local Lebanese Muslims that the United States had taken the Christian side; "New Jersey"s shells had killed hundreds of people, mostly Shiites and Druze. In his memoir, General <a href="Colin%20Powell">Colin Powell</a> (at the time an assistant to <a href="Caspar%20Weinberger">Caspar Weinberger</a>) noted that "When the shells started falling on the Shiites, they assumed the American ‘referee’ had taken sides."

The accuracy of "New Jersey"s guns was also called into question. An investigation into "New Jersey's" gunfire effectiveness in Lebanon, led by <a href="United%20States%20Marine">Marine</a> Colonel Don Price, found that many of the ship's shells had missed their targets by as much as and therefore may have inadvertently killed civilians. Tim McNulty, a correspondent for the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" based in Lebanon said, "Everybody loved the "New Jersey" until she fired her guns. Once she fired, it was obvious she couldn't hit anything." The inaccuracy is believed to have resulted because the ship's main gunpowder had been remixed by the Navy, under the direction of Captain Joseph Dominick Miceli at the <a href="Naval%20Surface%20Warfare%20Center%20Crane%20Division">Naval Weapons Support Center</a>, and rebagged. Powder lots (an individual production of powder) burn at different rates. Therefore, remixing the powder lots could cause the guns to fire inconsistently. The problem was apparently resolved after the Navy was able to locate additional powder supplies which had not been remixed.

In 1986 "New Jersey" began her next deployment, this time operating as part of the Pacific Fleet and as the centerpiece of her own <a href="battleship%20battle%20group">battle group</a>. This was first time that "New Jersey" had operational control of her own group of escorts since the Korean War, and she cruised from Hawaii to <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> in 1986, freeing up U.S. aircraft carriers for other missions and in the process becoming the only major U.S. naval presence in the region from May to October. Although in command of her own Battleship Battlegroup "New Jersey" did sail with the aircraft carriers and and while deployed in 1986.

According to a declassified command history for the nuclear-armed battleship "New Jersey", during her transit through the Sea of Okhotsk on 27–28 September 1986, "close passes" were made by Soviet Bear and Badger bombers, a Hormone helicopter, and a May maritime patrol airplane. A and two "Grisha III" frigates also shadowed the U.S. ships. The maneuver, according to the command history, "marked the first time a U.S. battleship had operated in the Soviet Navy's backyard."

Following an overhaul at Long Beach which lasted into 1988 "New Jersey" returned to the Pacific Ocean, this time operating as part of a surface action group. The battleship operated near the coast of Korea prior to the opening of the <a href="1988%20Summer%20Olympics">1988 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="Seoul%2C%20South%20Korea">Seoul, South Korea</a>, then departed for Australia to participate in the Australian bicentennial celebrations.

In April 1989, as "New Jersey" was preparing for her last operational cruise, sister ship suffered <a href="USS%20Iowa%20turret%20explosion">a catastrophic explosion in her No. 2 gun turret</a>; fallout from the incident led U.S. Naval officials to freeze <a href="live%20fire%20exercise">live fire exercise</a>s with the guns until the investigation into the explosion was concluded. Eventually, the ban was lifted and "New Jersey" was allowed to use her big guns again.

"New Jersey"s final cruise began in 1989 as part of Pacific Exercise '89. Upon completion of the exercise, "New Jersey" sailed through the Indian Ocean and into the Persian Gulf, in the process becoming the centerpiece for various battle groups and surface action groups. "New Jersey" remained in the Persian Gulf for the rest of the year, returning to the United States in February 1990.

With the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281985%E2%80%931991%29">collapse of the Soviet Union</a> in the early 1990s and the lack of a perceived threat against the United States came drastic cuts to the defense budget, and the high cost of maintaining battleships as part of the active fleet became uneconomical; as a result, "New Jersey" was decommissioned for the final time at <a href="Naval%20Station%20Long%20Beach">Naval Station Long Beach</a>, California, on 8 February 1991, with the ship serving a total of 21 years (the most of the four "Iowa"s) in active service. The decision to decommission "New Jersey" robbed the battleship of the chance to participate in <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Storm">Operation Desert Storm</a> in 1991, a military campaign to forcibly remove <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>i <a href="invasion">invasion</a> troops from <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>. Hostilities had commenced on or about 15 January 1991 and sister ships and were engaging Iraqi targets with Tomahawk missiles at the time of "New Jersey"s decommissioning. Following her decommissioning "New Jersey" was towed to <a href="Bremerton%2C%20Washington">Bremerton, Washington</a>, where she remained in reserve until struck from the <a href="Naval%20Vessel%20Register">Naval Vessel Register</a> in January 1995.

Section 1011 of the <a href="National%20Defense%20Authorization%20Act">National Defense Authorization Act</a> of 1996 required the United States Navy to reinstate to the Naval Vessel Register two of the "Iowa"-class battleships that had been struck by the Navy in 1995; these ships were to be maintained in the United States Navy reserve fleets (or "mothball fleet"). The Navy was to ensure that both of the reinstated battleships were in good condition and could be reactivated for use in the Marine Corps' amphibious operations. Due to 's damaged Turret 2 the Navy selected "New Jersey" for placement into the mothball fleet, even though the training mechanisms on "New Jersey"s 16-in guns had been welded down. The cost to fix "New Jersey" was considered less than the cost to fix "Iowa"; as a result, "New Jersey" and "Wisconsin" were reinstated to the Naval Vessel Register and placed back in the reserve fleet.

"New Jersey" remained in mothball fleet until the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act of 1999 passed through the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> 18 October 1998. Section 1011 required the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">United States Secretary of the Navy</a> to list and maintain "Iowa" and "Wisconsin" on the Naval Vessel Register, while Section 1012 required the Secretary of the Navy to strike "New Jersey" from the Naval Vessel Register and transfer the battleship to a not-for-profit entity in accordance with section 7306 of <a href="Title%2010%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Code">Title 10, United States Code</a>. Section 1012 also required the transferee to locate the battleship in the <a href="New%20Jersey">State of New Jersey</a>. The Navy made the switch in January 1999, and on 12 September, "New Jersey" was towed by the tug "Sea Victory" from Bremerton, Washington to <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, for restoration work in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in advance of her planned donation for use as a museum.

Two competing requests for the battleships were filed, one by the USS New Jersey Battleship Commission of Bayonne, New Jersey, and one by the Home Port Alliance of Camden, New Jersey. Both teams submitted plans to operate and maintain the battleship as a museum. After a review of both plans, the Navy selected the Home Port Alliance as the battleship's final resting place. Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig made the announcement on 20 January 2000, and on 15 October of that year "New Jersey" arrived at her final resting place on the <a href="Camden%20Waterfront">Camden Waterfront</a>.

Shortly after her arrival "New Jersey" was opened to the public, officially beginning her new career as a museum ship with the name <a href="Battleship%20New%20Jersey%20Museum%20and%20Memorial">Battleship New Jersey Museum and Memorial</a>. Self-guided tours, guided group tours, and overnight encampments are offered on the floating museum. Overnight encampments, typically for the benefit of <a href="Scouting">Scouting</a> organizations, offer the opportunity to sleep and eat in the original berths and mess decks.

"New Jersey" has been placed on several historic registers. In 1997, while the ship was still in the mothball fleet, the New Jersey State Review Board for Historic Sites recommended that it "be listed in the New Jersey Register of Historic Places, contingent upon the transfer of the battleship to New Jersey waters." In 2004, the State of New Jersey officially designated the battleship as an historical place. This cleared "New Jersey" for placement on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>, a list to which "New Jersey" was officially added in 2004.

In early 2012 there was debate on whether or not the USS "New Jersey" should be moved to <a href="Liberty%20State%20Park">Liberty State Park</a>. Ultimately, nothing came from the debate and the ship remains in Camden.

"New Jersey" earned nine battle stars for her World War II service, four for the Korean War, two for the Vietnam War, and four for action in Lebanon and the Persian Gulf region.Among other awards, she received the <a href="Navy%20Unit%20Commendation">Navy Unit Commendation</a> for Vietnam service, the <a href="Presidential%20Unit%20Citation%20%28Philippines%29">Presidential Unit Citation</a> from the <a href="Philippines">Republic of the Philippines</a>, and the <a href="Presidential%20Unit%20Citation%20%28Korea%29">Presidential Unit Citation</a> from the <a href="Republic%20of%20Korea">Republic of Korea</a>. Based on these "New Jersey" holds the distinction of being the most decorated battleship in US history.

Stegosaurus

Stegosaurus (), from Greek stegos (στέγος) which means roof and sauros (σαῦρος) which means lizard (), is a genus of <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a> <a href="thyreophora">thyreophora</a>n <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>. Fossils of this genus date to the <a href="Late%20Jurassic">Late Jurassic</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">period</a>, where they are found in <a href="Kimmeridgian">Kimmeridgian</a> to early <a href="Tithonian">Tithonian</a> aged <a href="stratum">strata</a>, between 155 and 150 <a href="Mya%20%28unit%29">million years ago</a>, in the western <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>. Of the species that have been classified in the upper <a href="Morrison%20Formation">Morrison Formation</a> of the western US, only three are universally recognized; S. stenops, S. ungulatus and S. sulcatus. The remains of over 80 individual animals of this genus have been found. "Stegosaurus" would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as "<a href="Apatosaurus">Apatosaurus</a>", "<a href="Diplodocus">Diplodocus</a>", "<a href="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a>", "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>", and "<a href="Ceratosaurus">Ceratosaurus</a>"; the latter two may have been predators of it.

These were large, heavily built, <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a> <a href="quadruped">quadruped</a>s with rounded backs, short fore limbs, long hind limbs, and tails held high in the air. Due to their distinctive combination of broad, upright plates and tail tipped with <a href="Thagomizer">spikes</a>, "Stegosaurus" is one of the most recognizable kinds of dinosaurs. The function of this array of plates and spikes has been the subject of much speculation among scientists. Today, it is generally agreed that their spiked tails were most likely used for defense against predators, while their plates may have been used primarily for display, and secondarily for <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulatory</a> functions. "Stegosaurus" had a relatively low <a href="brain-to-body%20mass%20ratio">brain-to-body mass ratio</a>. It had a short neck and a small head, meaning it most likely ate low-lying bushes and shrubs. One species, "Stegosaurus ungulatus", is the largest known of all the stegosaurians (bigger than related dinosaurs such as "<a href="Kentrosaurus">Kentrosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Huayangosaurus">Huayangosaurus</a>").

"Stegosaurus" remains were first identified during the "<a href="Bone%20Wars">Bone Wars</a>" by <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a>. The first known skeletons were fragmentary and the bones were scattered, and it would be many years before the true appearance of these animals, including their posture and plate arrangement, became well understood. Despite its popularity in books and film, mounted skeletons of "Stegosaurus" did not become a staple of major natural history museums until the mid-20th century, and many museums have had to assemble composite displays from several different specimens due to a lack of complete skeletons. "Stegosaurus" is one of the best-known dinosaurs, and has been featured in film, postal stamps, and many other types of media.

The quadrupedal "Stegosaurus" is one of the most easily identifiable dinosaur genera, due to the distinctive double row of kite-shaped plates rising vertically along the rounded back and the two pairs of long spikes extending horizontally near the end of the tail. Although large individuals could grow up to in length and in weight, the various species of "Stegosaurus" were dwarfed by contemporaries, the giant <a href="Sauropoda">sauropods</a>. Some form of <a href="Armour%20%28zoology%29">armor</a> appears to have been necessary, as "Stegosaurus" species coexisted with large predatory theropod dinosaurs, such as "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Ceratosaurus">Ceratosaurus</a>".

Most of the information known about "Stegosaurus" comes from the remains of mature animals; more recently, though, juvenile remains of "Stegosaurus" have been found. One subadult specimen, discovered in 1994 in Wyoming, is long and high, and is estimated to have weighed 2.4 metric tons (2.6 short tons) while alive. It is on display in the University of Wyoming Geological Museum.

The long and narrow <a href="skull">skull</a> was small in proportion to the body. It had a small <a href="antorbital%20fenestra">antorbital fenestra</a>, the hole between the nose and eye common to most <a href="archosaur">archosaur</a>s, including modern birds, though lost in extant crocodylians. The skull's low position suggests that "Stegosaurus" may have been a browser of low-growing vegetation. This interpretation is supported by the absence of front teeth and their likely replacement by a horny beak or <a href="beak%23Anatomy">rhamphotheca</a>. The lower jaw had flat downward and upward extensions that would have completely hidden the teeth when viewed from the side, and these probably supported a turtle-like beak in life. The presence of a beak extended along much of the jaws may have precluded the presence of cheeks in these species. Such an extensive beak was probably unique to "Stegosaurus" and some other advanced stegosaurids among ornithischians, which usually had beaks restricted to the jaw tips. Other researchers have interpreted these ridges as modified versions of similar structures in other ornithischians which might have supported fleshy cheeks, rather than beaks. Stegosaurian teeth were small, triangular, and flat; wear facets show that they did grind their food.

Despite the animal's overall size, the braincase of "Stegosaurus" was small, being no larger than that of a dog. A well-preserved "Stegosaurus" braincase allowed <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a> to obtain, in the 1880s, a cast of the brain cavity or endocast of the animal, which gave an indication of the brain size. The endocast showed the brain was indeed very small, the smallest proportionally of all dinosaur endocasts then known. The fact that an animal weighing over 4.5 <a href="tonne">metric tons</a> (5 <a href="short%20tons">short tons</a>) could have a brain of no more than contributed to the popular old idea that all dinosaurs were unintelligent, an idea now largely rejected. Actual brain anatomy in "Stegosaurus" is poorly known, but the brain itself was small even for a dinosaur, fitting well with a slow, herbivorous lifestyle and limited behavioral complexity.

In "Stegosaurus stenops" there are 27 bones in the <a href="vertebral%20column">vertebral column</a> <a href="Anterior">anterior</a> to the <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a>, a varying number of vertebrae in the sacrum, with four in most subadults, and around 46 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The presacrals are divided into cervical (neck) and dorsal (back) vertebrae, with around 10 cervicals and 17 dorsals, the total number being one greater than in "<a href="Hesperosaurus">Hesperosaurus</a>", two greater than "<a href="Huayangosaurus">Huayangosaurus</a>", although "<a href="Miragaia">Miragaia</a>" preserves 17 cervicals and an unknown number of dorsals. The first cervical vertebra is the <a href="axis%20bone">axis bone</a>, which is connected and often fused to the <a href="atlas%20bone">atlas bone</a>. Farther posteriorly, the proportionately larger the cervicals become, although they do not change greatly in anything other than size. Past the first few dorsals, the <a href="vertebral%20centrum">centrum</a> of the bones become more elongate front-to-back, and the <a href="wikt%3Atransverse">transverse</a> processes become more elevated <a href="Dorsa">dorsal</a>. The sacrum of "S. stenops" includes four sacral vertebrae, but one of the dorsals is also incorporated into the structure. In some specimens of "S. stenops", a caudal is also incorporated, as a caudosacral. In "<a href="Hesperosaurus">Hesperosaurus</a>" there are two dorsosacrals, and only four fused sacrals, but in "<a href="Kentrosaurus">Kentrosaurus</a>" there may be as many as seven vertebrae in the sacrum, with both dorsosacrals and caudosacrals. "S. stenops" preserves 46 caudal vertebrae, and up to 49, and along the series both the centrums and the <a href="neural%20spines">neural spines</a> become smaller, until the neural spines disappear at caudal 35. Around the middle of the tail, the neural spines become <a href="wikt%3Abifurcation">bifurcated</a>, meaning they are divided near the top.

With multiple well-preserved skeletons, "S. stenops" preserves all regions of the body, including the limbs. The <a href="scapula">scapula</a> (shoulder blade) is sub-rectangular, with a robust blade. Though it is not always perfectly preserved, the <a href="acromion">acromion</a> ridge is slightly larger than in "Kentrosaurus". The blade is relatively straight, although it curves towards the back. There is a small bump on the back of the blade, that would have served as the base of the "<a href="triceps">triceps</a>" muscle. Articulated with the scapula, the <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a> is sub-circular. The hind feet each had three short toes, while each fore foot had five toes; only the inner two toes had a blunt hoof. The phalangeal formula is 2-2-2-2-1, meaning the innermost finger of the fore limb has two bones, the next has two, etc. All four limbs were supported by pads behind the toes. The fore limbs were much shorter than the stocky hind limbs, which resulted in an unusual posture. The tail appears to have been held well clear of the ground, while the head of "Stegosaurus" was positioned relatively low down, probably no higher than above the ground.

The most recognizable features of "Stegosaurus" are its dermal plates, which consisted of between 17 and 22 separate plates and flat spines. These were highly modified <a href="osteoderms">osteoderms</a> (bony-cored scales), similar to those seen in crocodiles and many lizards today. They were not directly attached to the animal's skeleton, instead arising from the skin. The largest plates were found over the hips and could measure over wide and tall.

In a 2010 review of "Stegosaurus" species, Peter Galton suggested that the arrangement of the plates on the back may have varied between species, and that the pattern of plates as viewed in profile may have been important for species recognition. Galton noted that the plates in "S. stenops" have been found articulated in two staggered rows, rather than paired. Fewer "S. ungulatus" plates have been found, and none articulated, making the arrangement in this species more difficult to determine. However, the type specimen of "S. ungulatus" preserves two flattened spine-like plates from the tail that are nearly identical in shape and size, but are mirror images of each other, suggesting that at least these were arranged in pairs. Many of the plates are manifestly chiral and no two plates of the same size and shape have been found for an individual; however plates have been correlated between individuals. Well preserved integumentary impressions of the plates of "Hesperosaurus" show a smooth surface with long and parallel, shallow grooves. This indicates that the plates were covered in <a href="keratinous">keratinous</a> sheaths.

"Stegosaurus", one of the many dinosaurs first collected and described in the <a href="Bone%20Wars">Bone Wars</a>, was originally named by <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a> in 1877, from remains recovered north of <a href="Morrison%2C%20Colorado">Morrison, Colorado</a>. These first bones became the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> of "Stegosaurus armatus". Marsh initially believed the remains were from an aquatic turtle-like animal, and the basis for its <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">scientific name</a>, 'roof(ed) lizard' was due to his early belief that the plates lay flat over the animal's back, overlapping like the <a href="Roof%20shingle">shingles</a> (<a href="tile">tile</a>s) on a roof. A wealth of "Stegosaurus" material was recovered over the next few years, and Marsh published several papers on the genus from 1877 to 1897. In 1878, <a href="Edward%20Drinker%20Cope">Edward Drinker Cope</a> named "<a href="Hypsirhophus%20discurus">Hypsirhophus discurus</a>", as another stegosaurian based on fragmentary fossils specimens from Cope’s Quarry 3 near the "Cope's Nipple" site in <a href="Garden%20Park%2C%20Colorado">Garden Park, Colorado</a>. Many later researchers have considered "Hypsirhophus" to be a synonym of "Stegosaurus", though Peter Galton (2010) suggested that it is distinct based on differences in the vertebrae.
Marsh named a second species, "Stegosaurus ungulatus", in 1879, and finally gave a more detailed description of all the "Stegosaurus" fossils collected to far the following year. In 1881, he named a third species "Stegosaurus" "affinis", based only on a hip bone. This species is generally agreed to have been inadequately described, and therefore is a "<a href="nomen%20nudum">nomen nudum</a>" (a name lacking a formal description). The specimen was later lost. Marsh continued to collect and examine new "Stegosaurus" specimens, and in 1887 he named three new species: "Stegosaurus stenops", "S. duplex", and "S. sulcatus". Though it had not yet been completely prepared, the nearly complete and articulated type specimen of "Stegosaurus stenops" allowed Marsh to complete the first attempt at a reconstructed "Stegosaurus" skeleton. This first reconstruction, of "S. ungulatus" with missing parts filled in from "S. stenops", was published by Marsh in 1891. (In 1893, <a href="Richard%20Lydekker">Richard Lydekker</a> mistakenly re-published Marsh's drawing under the label "Hypsirhophus").
The next species of "Stegosaurus" to be named was "S. marshi", by Frederick Lucas in 1901. Lucas reclassified this species in the new genus "<a href="Hoplitosaurus">Hoplitosaurus</a>" later that year. Lucas also re-examined the issue of the life appearance of "Stegosaurus", coming to the conclusion that the plates were arranged in pairs in two rows along the back, arranged above the bases of the ribs. Lucas commissioned <a href="Charles%20R.%20Knight">Charles R. Knight</a> to produce a life restoration of "S. ungulatus" based on his new interpretation. However, the following year, Lucas wrote that he now believed the plates were probably attached in staggered rows. In 1910, <a href="Richard%20Swann%20Lull">Richard Swann Lull</a> wrote that the alternating pattern seen in "S. stenops" was probably due to shifting of the skeleton after death. He led the construction of the first ever "Stegosaurus" skeletal mount at the <a href="Peabody%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Peabody Museum of Natural History</a>, which was depicted with paired plates. In 1914, Charles Gilmore argued against Lull's interpretation, noting that several specimens of "S. stenops", including the now-completely prepared holotype, preserved the plates in alternating rows near the peak of the back, and that there was no evidence of the plates having shifted relative to the body during fossilization. Gilmore and Lucas' interpretation became the generally accepted standard, and Lull's mount at the Peabody Museum was changed to reflect this in 1924.

One of the major subjects of books and articles about "Stegosaurus" is the plate arrangement. The argument has been a major one in the history of dinosaur reconstruction. Four possible plate arrangements have been proposed over the years:

Many of the species initially described have since been considered to be invalid or synonymous with earlier named species, leaving two well-known and one poorly known species. Confirmed "Stegosaurus" remains have been found in the Morrison Formation's stratigraphic zones 2–6, with additional remains possibly referrable to "Stegosaurus" recovered from stratigraphic zone 1.


Susannah Maidment and colleagues in 2008 proposed extensive alterations to the taxonomy of "Stegosaurus". They advocated synonymizing "S. stenops" and "S. ungulatus" with "S. armatus", and sinking "<a href="Hesperosaurus">Hesperosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Wuerhosaurus">Wuerhosaurus</a>" into "Stegosaurus", with their <a href="type%20species">type species</a> becoming "Stegosaurus mjosi" and "Stegosaurus homheni", respectively. They regarded "S. longispinus" as <a href="nomen%20dubium">dubious</a>. Thus, their conception of "Stegosaurus" would include three valid species ("S. armatus", "S. homheni", and "S. mjosi") and would range from the <a href="Late%20Jurassic">Late Jurassic</a> of North America and Europe to the <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> of Asia. However, this classification scheme was not followed by other researchers, and a 2017 cladistic analysis co-authored by Maidment with Thomas Raven rejects the synonymy of "Hesperosaurus" with "Stegosaurus". In 2015, Maidment "et al." revised their suggestion due to the recognition by Galton of "S. armatus" as a "nomen dubium" and its replacement by "S. stenops" as type species.



"Stegosaurus" was the first-named genus of the family <a href="Stegosauridae">Stegosauridae</a>. It is the <a href="type%20genus">type genus</a> that gives its name to the family. The Stegosauridae are one of two families within the infraorder <a href="Stegosauria">Stegosauria</a>, with the other being the <a href="Huayangosauridae">Huayangosauridae</a>. The infraorder Stegosauria lies within the <a href="Thyreophora">Thyreophora</a>, or <a href="Armour%20%28zoology%29">armored</a> dinosaurs, a suborder which also includes the more diverse <a href="Ankylosauria">ankylosaurs</a>. The stegosaurs were a <a href="clade">clade</a> of animals similar in appearance, posture, and shape that mainly differed in their array of spikes and plates. Among the closest relatives to "Stegosaurus" are "<a href="Wuerhosaurus">Wuerhosaurus</a>" from <a href="China">China</a> and "<a href="Kentrosaurus">Kentrosaurus</a>" from <a href="East%20Africa">East Africa</a>.

The following <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> shows the position of "Stegosaurus" within the Stegosauridae according to Mateus, 2009:

The origin of "Stegosaurus" is uncertain, as few remains of basal stegosaurs and their ancestors are known. Recently, stegosaurids have been shown to be present in the lower Morrison Formation, existing several million years before the occurrence of "Stegosaurus" itself, with the discovery of the related "<a href="Hesperosaurus">Hesperosaurus</a>" from the early <a href="Kimmeridgian">Kimmeridgian</a>. The earliest stegosaurid (the genus "<a href="Lexovisaurus">Lexovisaurus</a>") is known from the <a href="Oxford%20Clay">Oxford Clay</a> Formation of England and France, giving it an age of early to middle <a href="Callovian">Callovian</a>.

The earlier and more basal genus "<a href="Huayangosaurus">Huayangosaurus</a>" from the Middle Jurassic of China (some 165 million years ago – Mya) antedates "Stegosaurus" by 20 million years and is the only genus in the family Huayangosauridae. Earlier still is "<a href="Scelidosaurus">Scelidosaurus</a>", from Early Jurassic England, which lived about 190 Mya. It possessed features of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. "<a href="Emausaurus">Emausaurus</a>" from Germany was another small quadruped, while "<a href="Scutellosaurus">Scutellosaurus</a>" from <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> was an even earlier genus and was facultatively bipedal. These small, lightly armored dinosaurs were closely related to the direct ancestor of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. A trackway of a possible early armored dinosaur, from around 195 Mya, has been found in France.

Soon after its discovery, Marsh considered "Stegosaurus" to have been bipedal, due to its short forelimbs. He had changed his mind, however, by 1891, after considering the heavy build of the animal.
Although "Stegosaurus" is undoubtedly now considered to have been quadrupedal, some discussion has occurred over whether it could have reared up on its hind legs, using its tail to form a tripod with its hind limbs, and browsing for higher foliage. This has been proposed by <a href="Robert%20Bakker">Bakker</a> and opposed by <a href="Kenneth%20Carpenter">Carpenter</a>. A study by Mallison (2010) found support a rearing up posture in "Kentrosaurus", though not for ability for the tail to act as a tripod.

"Stegosaurus" had short fore limbs in relation to its hind legs. Furthermore, within the hind limbs, the lower section (comprising the <a href="tibia">tibia</a> and <a href="fibula">fibula</a>) was short compared with the <a href="femur">femur</a>. This suggests it could not walk very fast, as the stride of the back legs at speed would have overtaken the front legs, giving a maximum speed of . Tracks discovered by Matthew Mossbrucker (Morrison Natural History Museum, Colorado) suggest that "Stegosaurus" lived in multiple-age herds. One group of tracks is interpreted as showing four or five baby stegosaurs moving in the same direction, while another has a juvenile stegosaur track with an adult track overprinting it.

The function of "Stegosaurus" plates has been much debated. Marsh suggested that they functioned as some form of armor, though Davitashvili (1961) disputed this, claiming that they were too fragile and ill-placed for defensive purposes, leaving the animal's sides unprotected. Nevertheless, others have continued to support a defensive function. Bakker suggested in 1986 that the plates were covered in horn comparing the surface of the fossilized plates to the bony cores of horns in other animals known or thought to bear horns. Christiansen and Tschopp (2010), having studied a well-preserved specimen of "Hesperosaurus" with skin impressions, concluded that the plates were covered in a keratin sheath and the plates had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate as a whole and provided it with sharp cutting edges.

Another possible function of the plates is they may have helped to control the body temperature of the animal, in a similar way to the sails of the <a href="pelycosaur">pelycosaur</a>s "<a href="Dimetrodon">Dimetrodon</a>" and "<a href="Edaphosaurus">Edaphosaurus</a>" (and modern elephant and rabbit ears). The plates had blood vessels running through grooves and air flowing around the plates would have cooled the blood. Buffrénil, et al. (1986) found "extreme vascularization of the outer layer of bone", which was seen has evidence that the plates "acted as thermoregulatory devices". Likewise, 2010 structural comparisons of "Stegosaurus" plates to "<a href="Alligator">Alligator</a>" osteoderms seem to support the conclusion that the potential for a thermoregulatory role in the plates of "Stegosaurus" definitely exists. This hypothesis has been seriously questioned, since its closest relatives, such as "Kentrosaurus", had more low <a href="surface%20area">surface area</a> spikes than plates, implying that cooling was not important enough to require specialized structural formations such as plates. 

Christiansen and Tschopp (2010) state that the presence of a smooth, insulating keratin covering would have hampered thermoregulation, but such a function cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite the keratin covering. In addition <a href="histology">histological</a> surveys of plate microstructure attributed the vascularization to the need to transport nutrients for rapid plate growth. However, plates could have helped the animal increase heat absorption from the sun. Since a cooling trend occurred towards the end of the Jurassic, a large ectothermic reptile might have used the increased surface area afforded by the plates to absorb radiation from the sun.

The plates' large size suggests that they may have served to increase the apparent height of the animal, either to intimidate enemies or to impress other members of the same species in some form of sexual <a href="Display%20%28zoology%29">display</a>. A 2015 study of the shapes and sizes of "Hespersaurus" plates suggested that they were <a href="Sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a>, with wide plates belonging to males and taller plates belonging to females. Christiansen and Tschopp (2010) proposed that the display function would have been reinforced by the horny sheath which would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly colored. Some have suggested that plates in stegosaurs were used to allow individuals to identify members of their species. The use of exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists in modern species.

Bakker stated that "Stegosaurus" could flip its osteoderms from one side to another to present a predator with an array of spikes and blades that would impede it from closing sufficiently to attack the "Stegosaurus" effectively. He contends that they had insufficient width for them to stand erect easily in such a manner as to be useful in display without continuous muscular effort. Mobility of the plates, however, has been disputed by other paleontologists. The vascular system of the plates have been theorized to have played a role in threat displaying as "Stegosaurus" could have pumped blood into them, causing them to "<a href="Blushing">blush</a>" and give a colorful, red warning.

Debate has been going on about whether the tail spikes were used for display only, as posited by Gilmore in 1914 or used as a weapon. Robert Bakker noted the tail was likely to have been much more flexible than that of other dinosaurs, as it lacked ossified tendons, thus lending credence to the idea of the tail as a weapon. However, as Carpenter has noted, the plates overlap so many tail vertebrae, movement would be limited. Bakker also observed that "Stegosaurus" could have maneuvered its rear easily, by keeping its large hind limbs stationary and pushing off with its very powerfully muscled but short fore limbs, allowing it to swivel deftly to deal with attack. More recently, a study of tail spikes by McWhinney "et al.", which showed a high incidence of trauma-related damage, lends more weight to the position that the spikes were indeed used in combat. This study showed that 9.8% of "Stegosaurus" specimens examined had injuries to their tail spikes. Additional support for this idea was a punctured tail vertebra of an "Allosaurus" into which a tail spike fits perfectly.

"S. stenops" had four dermal spikes, each about long. Discoveries of articulated stegosaur armor show, at least in some species, these spikes protruded horizontally from the tail, not vertically as is often depicted. Initially, Marsh described "S. ungulatus" as having eight spikes in its tail, unlike "S. stenops". However, recent research re-examined this and concluded this species also had four.

At one time, stegosaurs were described as having a "second brain" in their hips. Soon after describing "Stegosaurus", Marsh noted a large canal in the hip region of the spinal cord, which could have accommodated a structure up to 20 times larger than the famously small brain. This has led to the influential idea that dinosaurs like "Stegosaurus" had a "second brain" in the tail, which may have been responsible for controlling reflexes in the rear portion of the body. This "brain" was proposed to have given a "Stegosaurus" a temporary boost when it was under threat from predators.

This space, however, is more likely to have served other purposes. The sacro-lumbar expansion isn't unique to stegosaurs, nor even sauropods. It is also present in birds. In their case, it contains what is called the <a href="glycogen%20body">glycogen body</a>, a structure whose function is not definitely known, but which is postulated to facilitate the supply of <a href="glycogen">glycogen</a> to the animal's <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a>. It also may function as a balance organ, or reservoir of compounds to support the nervous system.

Juveniles of "Stegosaurus" have been preserved, probably showing the growth of the genus. The two juveniles are both relatively small, with the smaller individual being long, and the larger having a length of . The specimens can be identified as not mature because they lack the fusion of the <a href="scapula">scapula</a> and <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a>, and the lower hind limbs. Also, the <a href="pelvis">pelvic region</a> of the specimens are similar to "Kentrosaurus" juveniles. One 2009 study of "Stegosaurus" specimens of various sizes found that the plates and spikes had delayed <a href="histological">histological</a> growth in comparison to the skeleton and when the dinosaur reached maturity, growth in the osteoderms may have greatly outpaced that of the skeleton. A 2013 study concluded, based on the rapid deposition of highly vascularised fibrolamellar bone, that "Kentrosaurus" had a quicker growth rate than "Stegosaurus", contradicting the general rule that larger dinosaurs grew faster than smaller ones.

"Stegosaurus" and related genera were herbivores. However, their teeth and jaws are very different from those of other herbivorous <a href="ornithischian">ornithischian</a> dinosaurs, suggesting a different feeding strategy that is not yet well understood. The other ornithischians possessed teeth capable of grinding plant material and a jaw structure capable of movements in planes other than simply orthal (i.e. not only the fused up-down motion to which stegosaur jaws were likely limited). Unlike the sturdy jaws and grinding teeth common to its fellow ornithischians, "Stegosaurus" (and all stegosaurians) had small, peg-shaped teeth that have been observed with horizontal wear facets associated with tooth-food contact and their unusual jaws were probably capable of only orthal (up-down) movements. Their teeth were "not tightly pressed together in a block for efficient grinding", and no evidence in the fossil record of stegosaurians indicates use of <a href="gastrolith">gastrolith</a>s—the stone(s) some dinosaurs (and some present-day bird species) ingested—to aid the grinding process, so how exactly "Stegosaurus" obtained and processed the amount of plant material required to sustain its size remains "poorly understood".
The stegosaurians were widely distributed geographically in the late Jurassic. Palaeontologists believe it would have eaten plants such as mosses, ferns, horsetails, cycads, and conifers or fruits. Grazing on grasses, seen in many modern <a href="mammal">mammal</a>ian herbivores, would not have been possible for "Stegosaurus", as grasses did not evolve until late into the <a href="Cretaceous%20Period">Cretaceous Period</a>, long after "Stegosaurus" had become extinct.

One hypothesized feeding behavior strategy considers them to be low-level browsers, eating low-growing fruit of various nonflowering plants, as well as foliage. This scenario has "Stegosaurus" foraging at most 1 m above the ground. Conversely, if "Stegosaurus" could have raised itself on two legs, as suggested by Bakker, then it could have browsed on vegetation and fruits quite high up, with adults being able to forage up to above the ground.

A detailed computer analysis of the biomechanics of "Stegosaurus"'s feeding behavior was performed in 2010, using two different three-dimensional models of "Stegosaurus" teeth given realistic physics and properties. Bite force was also calculated using these models and the known skull proportions of the animal, as well as simulated tree branches of different size and hardness. The resultant bite forces calculated for "Stegosaurus" were 140.1 <a href="Newton%20%28unit%29">newtons</a> (N), 183.7 N, and 275 N (for anterior, middle and posterior teeth, respectively), which means its bite force was less than half that of a <a href="Labrador%20retriever">Labrador retriever</a>. "Stegosaurus" could have easily bitten through smaller green branches, but would have had difficulty with anything over 12 mm in diameter. "Stegosaurus", therefore, probably browsed primarily among smaller twigs and foliage, and would have been unable to handle larger plant parts unless the animal was capable of biting much more efficiently than predicted in this study. However, a study published on May 20, 2016 by Stephen Lautenschlager et al. indicates "Stegosaurus" bite strength was stronger than previously believed. Comparisons were made between it (represented by a specimen known as "<a href="Sophie%20the%20Stegosaurus">Sophie</a>" from the United Kingdom's Natural History Museum) and two other herbivorous dinosaurs; "<a href="Erlikosaurus">Erlikosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Plateosaurus">Plateosaurus</a>" to determine if all three had similar bite forces and similar niches. Based on the results of the study, it was revealed that "Stegosaurus" had a bite similar in strength to that of modern herbivorous mammals, in particular, cattle and sheep. Based on this data, it is likely "Stegosaurus" also ate woodier, tougher plants such as cycads, perhaps even acting as a means of spreading cycad seeds. The findings were published in the journal "Scientific Reports".

The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the <a href="Araucaria">Araucaria</a>-like conifer "<a href="Brachyphyllum">Brachyphyllum</a>". The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycads, ginkoes, and several families of conifers. Animal fossils discovered include bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles like "<a href="Dorsetochelys">Dorsetochelys</a>", sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans like "<a href="Hoplosuchus">Hoplosuchus</a>", several species of <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>s such as "<a href="Harpactognathus">Harpactognathus</a>" and "<a href="Mesadactylus">Mesadactylus</a>", numerous dinosaur species, and early mammals such as <a href="Docodonta">docodonts</a> (like "<a href="Docodon">Docodon</a>"), <a href="Multituberculata">multituberculates</a>, <a href="Symmetrodonta">symmetrodonts</a>, and <a href="Eutriconodonta">triconodonts</a>.

Dinosaurs that lived alongside "Stegosaurus" included theropods "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>", "<a href="Saurophaganax">Saurophaganax</a>", "<a href="Torvosaurus">Torvosaurus</a>", "<a href="Ceratosaurus">Ceratosaurus</a>", "<a href="Marshosaurus">Marshosaurus</a>", "<a href="Stokesosaurus">Stokesosaurus</a>", "<a href="Ornitholestes">Ornitholestes</a>", "<a href="Coelurus">Coelurus</a>" and "<a href="Tanycolagreus">Tanycolagreus</a>". Sauropods dominated the region, and included" <a href="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a>", "<a href="Apatosaurus">Apatosaurus</a>", "<a href="Diplodocus">Diplodocus</a>", "<a href="Camarasaurus">Camarasaurus</a>", and "<a href="Barosaurus">Barosaurus</a>". Other ornithischians included "<a href="Camptosaurus">Camptosaurus</a>", "<a href="Gargoyleosaurus">Gargoyleosaurus</a>", "<a href="Dryosaurus">Dryosaurus</a>", "<a href="Othnielosaurus">Othnielosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Drinker%20%28dinosaur%29">Drinker</a>". "Stegosaurus" is commonly found at the same sites as "Allosaurus", "Apatosaurus", "Camarasaurus", and" Diplodocus". "Stegosaurus" may have preferred drier settings than these other dinosaurs.

One of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs, "Stegosaurus" has been depicted on film, in cartoons and comics and as children's toys. Due to the fragmentary nature of most early "Stegosaurus" fossil finds, it took many years before reasonably accurate restorations of these animals could be produced. The earliest popular image of "Stegosaurus" was an engraving produced by A. Tobin for the November 1884 issue of "<a href="Scientific%20American">Scientific American</a>", which included the dinosaur amid a speculative Morrison age landscape. Tobin restored the "Stegosaurus" as bipedal and long-necked, with the plates arranged along the tail and the back covered in spikes. This covering of spikes might have been based on a misinterpretation of the teeth, which Marsh had noted were oddly shaped, cylindrical, and found scattered, such that he thought they might turn out to be small dermal spines.

Marsh published his more accurate skeletal reconstruction of "Stegosaurus" in 1891, and within a decade "Stegosaurus" had become among the most-illustrated types of dinosaur. Artist <a href="Charles%20R.%20Knight">Charles R. Knight</a> published his first illustration of "Stegosaurus ungulatus" based on Marsh's skeletal reconstruction in a November 1897 issue of "<a href="The%20Century%20Magazine">The Century Magazine</a>". This illustration would later go on to form the basis of the stop-motion puppet used in the 1933 film "<a href="King%20Kong%20%281933%20film%29">King Kong</a>". Like Marsh's reconstruction, Knight's first restoration had a single row of large plates, though he next used a double row for his more well-known 1901 painting, produced under the direction of Frederic Lucas. Again under Lucas, Knight revised his version of "Stegosaurus" again two years later, producing a model with a staggered double row of plates. Knight would go on to paint a stegosaur with a staggered double plate row in 1927 for the <a href="Field%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Field Museum of Natural History</a>, and was followed by <a href="Rudolph%20F.%20Zallinger">Rudolph F. Zallinger</a>, who painted "Stegosaurus" this way in his "Age of Reptiles" mural at the Peabody Museum in 1947.
"Stegosaurus" made its major public debut as a paper mache model commissioned by the U.S. <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">National Museum of Natural History</a> for the 1904 <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase%20Exposition">Louisiana Purchase Exposition</a>. The model was based on Knight's latest miniature with the double row of staggered plates, and was exhibited in the United States Government Building at the exposition in <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a> before being relocated to <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a> for the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Centennial%20Exposition">Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition</a> in 1905. The model was moved to the <a href="Smithsonian">Smithsonian</a> National Museum of Natural History (now the <a href="Arts%20and%20Industries%20Building">Arts and Industries Building</a>) in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> along with other prehistory displays, and to the current National Museum of Natural History building in 1911. Following renovations to the museum in the 2010s, the model was moved once again for display at the <a href="Museum%20of%20the%20Earth">Museum of the Earth</a> in <a href="Ithaca%2C%20New%20York">Ithaca, New York</a>.
The popularity of "Stegosaurus" is owed partly to its prominent display in natural history museums. Though considered one of the most distinctive types of dinosaur, "Stegosaurus" displays were missing from a majority of museums during the first half of the 20th century, due largely to the disarticulated nature of most fossil specimens. Until 1918, the only mounted skeleton of "Stegosaurus" in the world was O. C. Marsh's type specimen of "S. ungulatus" at the <a href="Peabody%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Peabody Museum of Natural History</a>, which was put on display in 1910. However, this mount was dismantled in 1917 when the old Peabody Museum building was demolished. This historically significant specimen was re-mounted ahead of the opening of the new Peabody Museum building in 1925. 1918 saw the completion of the second "Stegosaurus" mount, and the first depicting "S. stenops". This mount was created under the direction of Charles Gilmore at the U.S. National Museum of Natural History. It was a composite of several skeletons, primarily USNM 6531, with proportions designed to closely follow the "S. stenops" type specimen, which had been on display in relief nearby since 1918. The aging mount was dismantled in 2003 and replaced with a cast in an updated pose in 2004. A third mounted skeleton of "Stegosaurus", referred to "S. stenops", was put on display at the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> in 1932. Mounted under the direction of Charles J. Long, the American Museum mount was a composite consisting of partial remains filled in with replicas based on other specimens. In his article about the new mount for the museum's journal, <a href="Barnum%20Brown">Barnum Brown</a> described (and disputed) the popular misconception that the "Stegosaurus" had a "second brain" in its hips. Another composite mount, using specimens referred to "S. ungulatus" collected from <a href="Dinosaur%20National%20Monument">Dinosaur National Monument</a> between 1920 and 1922, was put on display at the <a href="Carnegie%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Carnegie Museum of Natural History</a> in 1940.

Áedán mac Gabráin

Áedán mac Gabráin (pronounced in <a href="Old%20Irish%20language">Old Irish</a>) was a <a href="king%20of%20D%C3%A1l%20Riata">king of Dál Riata</a> from c. 574 until c. 609. The kingdom of <a href="D%C3%A1l%20Riata">Dál Riata</a> was situated in modern <a href="Argyll%20and%20Bute">Argyll and Bute</a>, Scotland, and parts of <a href="County%20Antrim">County Antrim</a>, Ireland. Genealogies record that Áedán was a son of <a href="Gabr%C3%A1n%20mac%20Domangairt">Gabrán mac Domangairt</a>.

He was a contemporary of <a href="Columba">Saint Columba</a>, and much that is recorded of his life and career comes from <a href="hagiography">hagiography</a> such as <a href="Adomn%C3%A1n%20of%20Iona">Adomnán of Iona</a>'s "Life of Saint Columba". Áedán appears as a character in <a href="Old%20Irish%20language">Old Irish</a> and <a href="Middle%20Irish%20language">Middle Irish language</a> works of prose and verse, some now lost.

The <a href="Irish%20annals">Irish annals</a> record Áedán's campaigns against his neighbours, in Ireland, and in northern Britain, including expeditions to the <a href="Orkney%20Islands">Orkney Islands</a>, the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>, and the east coast of Scotland. As recorded by <a href="Bede">Bede</a>, Áedán was decisively defeated by <a href="%C3%86thelfrith%20of%20Bernicia">Æthelfrith of Bernicia</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Degsastan">Battle of Degsastan</a>. Áedán may have been deposed, or have abdicated, following this defeat. His date of death is recorded by one source as 17 April 609.

The sources for Áedán's life include Bede's "<a href="Historia%20ecclesiastica%20gentis%20Anglorum">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</a>"; <a href="Irish%20annals">Irish annals</a>, principally the "<a href="Annals%20of%20Ulster">Annals of Ulster</a>" and the "<a href="Annals%20of%20Tigernach">Annals of Tigernach</a>"; and Adomnán's "Life of Saint Columba". The "<a href="Senchus%20fer%20n-Alban">Senchus fer n-Alban</a>", a census and <a href="genealogy">genealogy</a> of Dál Riata, purports to record his ancestry and that of his immediate descendants. None of these sources are contemporary. Adomnán's work was written in the very late 7th century, probably to mark the centenary of Columba's death. It incorporates elements from a lost earlier life of Columba, "De virtutibus sancti Columbae", by <a href="Cumm%C3%A9ne%20Find">Cumméne Find</a>. This may have been written as early as 640; neither the elements incorporated from Cumméne's work nor Adomnán's own writings can be treated as simple history. Bede's history was written 30 years after Adomnán's. The surviving Irish annals contain elements of a chronicle kept at Iona from the middle of the 7th century onwards, so that these too are retrospective when dealing with Áedán's time.

The <a href="Rawlinson%20B%20502">Rawlinson B 502</a> manuscript, dated to c. 1130, contains the tale "Gein Branduib maic Echach ocus Aedáin maic Gabráin" ("The Birth of Brandub son of Eochu and of Aedán son of Gabrán"). In this story, Áedán is the twin brother of <a href="Brandub%20mac%20Echach">Brandub mac Echach</a>, a <a href="King%20of%20Leinster">King of Leinster</a> who belonged to the <a href="U%C3%AD%20Cheinnselaig">Uí Cheinnselaig</a> kindred. Áedán is exchanged at birth for one of the twin daughters of Gabrán, born the same night, so that each family might have a son. "<a href="The%20Prophecy%20of%20Berch%C3%A1n">The Prophecy of Berchán</a>" also associates Áedán with <a href="Leinster">Leinster</a>. <a href="John%20Bannerman%20%28historian%29">John Bannerman</a> concluded that "[t]here seems to be no basis of fact behind these traditions." <a href="Francis%20John%20Byrne">Francis John Byrne</a> suggested that the "Echtra" was written by a poet at the court of <a href="Diarmait%20mac%20Ma%C3%ADl%20na%20mB%C3%B3">Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó</a>, an 11th-century descendant of Brandub, and was written to cement an alliance between Diarmait and the Scots king <a href="Malcolm%20III%20of%20Scotland">Máel Coluim mac Donnchada</a> ("Malcolm III"), who claimed to be a descendant of Áedán. A lost Irish tale, "Echtra Áedáin mac Gabráin" ("The Adventures of Áedán son of Gabrán"), appears in a list of works, but its contents are unknown. Áedán is a character in the epic "<a href="Sc%C3%A9la%20Cano%20meic%20Gartn%C3%A1in">Scéla Cano meic Gartnáin</a>", but the events which inspired the tale appear to have taken place in the middle of the 7th century. He also appears in the tale "<a href="Compert%20Mong%C3%A1in">Compert Mongáin</a>".

Áedán additionally appears in a variety of Welsh sources, making him one of the few non-<a href="Britons%20%28Celtic%20people%29">Britons</a> to figure in Welsh tradition. Welsh sources call him "Aedan Bradawc", meaning "The Treacherous" or "The Wily". He may have earned this epithet after the collapse of an alliance with <a href="Rhydderch%20Hael">Rhydderch Hael</a>, king of the nearby Brittonic kingdom of <a href="Alt%20Clut">Alt Clut</a>; enmity between them is remembered in the <a href="Welsh%20Triads">Welsh Triads</a> and elsewhere. Another Triad records Áedán's host as one of the "Three Faithful War-Bands of the Island of Britain", as they "went to the sea for their lord". This may point to an otherwise lost tradition concerning one of Áedán's sea expeditions, such as to <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> or the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>. Additionally, several Welsh works claim a Brittonic pedigree for Áedán. The "<a href="Bonedd%20Gw%C5%B7r%20y%20Gogledd">Bonedd Gwŷr y Gogledd</a>" records him as a descendent of <a href="Dyfnwal%20Hen">Dyfnwal Hen</a> of Alt Clut, though the genealogy is much confused ("Gauran" is given as his son, rather than father). The Cambro-Latin "De Situ Brecheniauc" and "Cognacio Brychan" claim his mother was Luan, daughter of <a href="Brychan">Brychan</a> of <a href="Brycheiniog">Brycheiniog</a> in Wales. Though these pedigrees are inconsistent and likely dubious, they are notable in highlighting Áedán's close association with the Britons.

Áedán was the chief king in Dál Riata, ruling over lesser tribal kings. The "Senchus fer n-Alban" records the sub-divisions of Dál Riata in the 7th and 8th centuries, but no record from Áedán's time survives. According to the "Senchus", Dál Riata was divided into three sub-kingdoms in the 7th century, each ruled by a kin group named for their <a href="eponym">eponym</a>ous founder. These were the <a href="Cen%C3%A9l%20nGabr%C3%A1in">Cenél nGabráin</a>, named for Áedán's father, who ruled over <a href="Kintyre">Kintyre</a>, <a href="Cowal">Cowal</a> and <a href="Isle%20of%20Bute">Bute</a>; the <a href="Cen%C3%A9l%20Loairn">Cenél Loairn</a> of northern Argyll; and the <a href="Cen%C3%A9l%20n%C3%93engusa">Cenél nÓengusa</a> of <a href="Islay">Islay</a>. Within these there were smaller divisions or tribes which are named by the "Senchus". Details of the Irish part of the kingdom are less clear.

Looking outward, Dál Riata's neighbours in north Britain were the <a href="Picts">Picts</a> and the <a href="Britons%20%28historical%29">Britons</a> of the "<a href="Hen%20Ogledd">Hen Ogledd</a>", the <a href="Brittonic%20languages">Brittonic</a>-speaking parts of what is now <a href="Northern%20England">Northern England</a> and southern <a href="Scottish%20Lowlands">Lowland</a> Scotland. The most powerful Brittonic kingdom in the area was <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Strathclyde">Alt Clut</a>, later known as Strathclyde and <a href="Cumbria">Cumbria</a>. Late in Áedán's life, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of <a href="Bernicia">Bernicia</a> became the greatest power in north Britain.

In Ireland, Dál Riata formed part of <a href="Ulster">Ulster</a>, ruled by <a href="B%C3%A1et%C3%A1n%20mac%20Cairill">Báetán mac Cairill</a> of the <a href="D%C3%A1l%20Fiatach">Dál Fiatach</a>. The other major grouping in Ulster were the disunited tribes of the <a href="cruithne%20%28people%29">Cruithne</a>, later known as the <a href="D%C3%A1l%20nAraidi">Dál nAraidi</a>. The most important Cruithne king in Áedán's time was <a href="Fiachnae%20mac%20B%C3%A1et%C3%A1in">Fiachnae mac Báetáin</a>. Beyond the kingdom of Ulster, and generally hostile to it, were the various kingdoms and tribes of the <a href="U%C3%AD%20N%C3%A9ill">Uí Néill</a> and their subjects and allies. Of the Uí Néill kings, <a href="%C3%81ed%20mac%20Ainmuirech">Áed mac Ainmuirech</a> of the <a href="Cen%C3%A9l%20Conaill">Cenél Conaill</a>, Columba's first cousin once removed, was the most important during Áedán's reign.

Adomnán, the "Senchus fer n-Alban" and the Irish annals record Áedán as a son of <a href="Gabr%C3%A1n%20mac%20Domangairt">Gabrán mac Domangairt</a> (died c. 555–560). Áedán's brother Eoganán is known from Adomnán and his death is recorded c. 597. The "Senchus" names three other sons of Gabrán, namely Cuildach, Domnall, and Domangart. Although nothing is known of Cuildach and Domangart or their descendants, Adomnán mentions a certain Ioan, son of Conall, son of Domnall, "who belonged to the royal lineage of the Cenél nGabráin", but this is generally read as meaning that Ioan was a kinsman of the Cenél nGabráin, and his grandfather named Domnall is not thought to be the same person as Áedán's brother Domnall.

Áedán was about forty years old when he became king, following the death of his uncle <a href="Conall%20mac%20Comgaill">Conall mac Comgaill</a> in 574. His succession as king may have been contested; Adomnán states that Columba had favoured the candidacy of Áedán's brother Eoganán. Adomnán claims that Áedán was ordained as king by Columba, the first example of an ordination known in Britain and Ireland.

In 574, following the account of Conall's death, the "Annals of Ulster" and the "Annals of Tigernach" record a battle in <a href="Kintyre">Kintyre</a>, called the Battle of Teloch, or Delgu. The precise location of the battle is unidentified. The annals agree that "Dúnchad, son of Conall, son of Comgall, and many others of the allies of the sons of Gabrán, fell." In 575, the "Annals of Ulster" report "the great convention of Druim Cett", at Mullagh or Daisy Hill near <a href="Limavady">Limavady</a>, with Áed mac Ainmuirech and Columba in attendance. Adomnán reports that Áedán was present at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting is not entirely certain, but one agreement made there concerned the status of Áedán's kingdom. Áedán and Áed agreed that while the fleet of Dál Riata would serve the Uí Néill, no tribute would be paid to them, and warriors would only be provided from the Dál Riata lands in Ireland.

The reason for this agreement is thought to have been the threat posed to Áedán, and also to Áed, by Báetán mac Cairill. Báetán is said to have forced the king of Dál Riata to pay homage to him at Rosnaree on <a href="Islandmagee">Islandmagee</a>. Áedán is thought to be the king in question, and Ulster sources say that Báetán collected tribute from Scotland. Following Báetán's death in 581, the Ulstermen abandoned the Isle of Man, which they had captured in Báetán's time, perhaps driven out by Áedán who is recorded as fighting there c. 583. Earlier, c. 580, Áedán is said to have raided Orkney, which had been subject to <a href="Bridei%20I%20of%20the%20Picts">Bridei son of Maelchon</a>, <a href="King%20of%20the%20Picts">King of the Picts</a>, at an earlier date.

Áedán's campaigns on the Isle of Man have sometimes been confused with the battle against the Miathi mentioned by Adomnán. The Miathi appear to have been the <a href="Maeatae">Maeatae</a>, a tribe in the area of the upper <a href="river%20Forth">river Forth</a>. This campaign was successful, but Áedán's sons Artúr and Eochaid Find were killed in battle according to Adomnán. This battle may have taken place c. 590 and been recorded as the Battle of Leithreid or Leithrig.

The "<a href="Prophecy%20of%20Berch%C3%A1n">Prophecy of Berchán</a>" says of Áedán: "Thirteen years (one after another) [he will fight against] the Pictish host (fair the diadem)." The only recorded battle between Áedán and the Picts appears to have been fought in Circinn, in 599 or after, where Áedán was defeated. The annals mention the deaths of his sons here. It has been suggested that this battle was confused with the "Battle of Asreth" in Circinn, fought c. 584, in which Bridei son of Maelchon was killed. This battle is described as being "fought between the Picts themselves".

A number of Welsh traditions point to warfare between Áedán and King <a href="Rhydderch%20Hael">Rhydderch Hael</a> of <a href="Alt%20Clut">Alt Clut</a>, the northern Brittonic kingdom later known as Strathclyde. <a href="Hector%20Munro%20Chadwick">Hector Munro Chadwick</a> and subsequent historians suggest Áedán was initially in a long-term alliance with Rhydderch and his predecessors, but that it eventually collapsed into conflict. Adomnán reports that Rhydderch sent a monk named Luigbe to <a href="Iona">Iona</a> to speak with Columba "for he wanted to learn whether he would be slaughtered by his enemies or not". A <a href="Welsh%20Triad">Welsh Triad</a> names Áedán's plundering of Alt Clut as one of the "three unrestrained plunderings of Britain", and the poem "Peiryan Vaban" tells of a battle between Áedán and Rhydderch. The lost Irish epic "Orgain Sratha Cluada" is usually thought to refer to the attack on Alt Clut in 870 by <a href="Vikings">Vikings</a>, but MacQuarrie suggests that it may refer to an attack by Áedán on Rhydderch.

Degsastan appears not to have been the first battle between Áedán and the Bernicians. The death of his son Domangart in the land of the Saxons is mentioned by Adomnán, and it is presumed that Bran died in the same otherwise unrecorded battle.

Of the roots of this conflict, Bede mentions only that Áedán was alarmed by Æthelfrith's advance. Wherever the Battle of Degsastan was fought, Bede saw it as lying within <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>. The battle was a decisive victory for Æthelfrith, and Bede says, carefully, that "[f]rom that day until the present, no king of the Irish in Britain has dared to do battle with the English." Although victorious, Æthelfrith suffered losses; Bede tells us his brother Theodbald was killed with all his following. Theodbald appears to be called Eanfrith in Irish sources, which name his killer as <a href="M%C3%A1el%20Umai%20mac%20B%C3%A1et%C3%A1in">Máel Umai mac Báetáin</a> of the <a href="Cen%C3%A9l%20nE%C3%B3gain">Cenél nEógain</a>, son of High-King <a href="B%C3%A1et%C3%A1n%20mac%20Ninnedo">Báetán mac Ninnedo</a>. The Irish poem "<a href="Compert%20Mong%C3%A1in">Compert Mongáin</a>" says that the king of Ulster, Fiachnae mac Báetáin of the Dál nAraidi, aided Áedán against the Saxons, perhaps at Degsastan. The "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" mentions that <a href="Hering%20son%20of%20Hussa">Hering</a>, son of King <a href="Hussa%20of%20Bernicia">Hussa of Bernicia</a>, was present, apparently fighting with Áedán.

After the defeat of Degsastan, the annals report nothing of Áedán until his death around six years later, perhaps on 17 April 609, the date supplied by the "<a href="Martyrology%20of%20Tallaght">Martyrology of Tallaght</a>", composed c. 800. The "Annals of Tigernach" give his age as 74. The "Prophecy of Berchán" places his death in Kintyre and says "[h]e will not be king at the time of his death", while the 12th century "Acta Sancti Lasriani" claims that he was expelled from the kingship. <a href="John%20of%20Fordun">John of Fordun</a>, writing in the 14th century, believed that Áedán had been buried at <a href="Kilkerran%2C%20Argyll">Kilkerran</a> in Kintyre.

Áedán was succeeded by his son, <a href="Eochaid%20Buide">Eochaid Buide</a>. Adomnán gives an account of Columba's prophecy that Eochaid's older brothers would predecease their father. Áedán's other sons are named by the "Senchus fer n-Alban" as Eochaid Find, Tuathal, Bran, Baithéne, Conaing, and Gartnait. Adomnán also names Artúr, called a son of Conaing in the "Senchus", and Domangart, who is not included in the "Senchus". Domangart too may have been a grandson rather than a son of Áedán, most likely another son of Conaing. The main line of Cenél nGabráin kings were the descendants of Eochaid Buide through his son <a href="Domnall%20Brecc">Domnall Brecc</a>, but the descendants of Conaing successfully contested for the throne throughout the 7th century and into the 8th.

It has been suggested that Gartnait son of Áedán could be the same person as <a href="Gartnait%20II%20of%20the%20Picts">Gartnait son of Domelch</a>, king of the Picts, whose death is reported around 601, but this rests on the idea of Pictish <a href="matriliny">matriliny</a>, which has been criticised. Even less certainly, it has been argued that Gartnait's successor in the Pictish king-lists, <a href="Nechtan%20II%20of%20the%20Picts">Nechtan</a>, was his grandson, and thus Áedán's great-grandson.

Less is known of Áedán's daughters. Maithgemm, also recorded as Gemma, married a prince named Cairell of the Dál Fiatach. The names of Áedán's wives are not recorded, but one was said to be Brittonic, and another may have been a Pictish woman named Domelch, if indeed the Gartnait son of Domelch and Gartnait son of Áedán are one and the same.

Manchester Ship Canal

The Manchester Ship Canal is a inland <a href="waterway">waterway</a> in the <a href="North%20West%20England">North West of England</a> linking <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> to the <a href="Irish%20Sea">Irish Sea</a>. Starting at the <a href="River%20Mersey">Mersey Estuary</a> near Liverpool, it generally follows the original routes of the rivers Mersey and <a href="River%20Irwell">Irwell</a> through the <a href="Historic%20counties%20of%20England">historic counties</a> of <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> and <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>. Several sets of locks lift vessels about up to <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, where the canal's terminus was built. Major landmarks along its route include the <a href="Barton%20Swing%20Aqueduct">Barton Swing Aqueduct</a>, the only swing aqueduct in the world, and <a href="Trafford%20Park">Trafford Park</a>, the world's first planned industrial estate and still the largest in Europe.

The rivers Mersey and Irwell were first made navigable in the early 18th century. Goods were also transported on the Runcorn extension of the <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a> (from 1776) and the <a href="Liverpool%20and%20Manchester%20Railway">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a> (from 1830), but by the late 19th century the <a href="Mersey%20and%20Irwell%20Navigation">Mersey and Irwell Navigation</a> had fallen into disrepair and was often unusable. In addition, Manchester's business community viewed the charges imposed by Liverpool's docks and the railway companies as excessive. A <a href="ship%20canal">ship canal</a> was therefore proposed as a way of giving ocean-going vessels direct access to Manchester. The region was suffering from the effects of the <a href="Long%20Depression">Long Depression</a>, and for the canal's proponents, who argued that the scheme would boost competition and create jobs, the idea of a ship canal made sound economic sense. They initiated a public campaign to enlist support for the scheme, which was first presented to Parliament as a <a href="bill%20%28proposed%20law%29">bill</a> in 1882. Faced with stiff opposition from Liverpool, the canal's supporters were unable to gain the necessary <a href="Acts%20of%20Parliament%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Act of Parliament</a> to allow the scheme to go ahead until 1885.

Construction began in 1887; it took six years and cost £15 million (equivalent to about £1.65 billion in 2011). When the ship canal opened in January 1894 it was the largest river navigation canal in the world, and enabled the newly created <a href="Port%20of%20Manchester">Port of Manchester</a> to become Britain's third busiest port despite the city being about 40 miles (64 km) inland. Changes to shipping methods and the growth of containerisation during the 1970s and 80s meant that many ships were now too big to use the canal and traffic declined, resulting in the closure of the terminal docks at Salford. Although able to accommodate a range of vessels from coastal ships to intercontinental <a href="cargo%20liner">cargo liner</a>s, the canal is not large enough for most modern vessels. By 2011 traffic had decreased from its peak in 1958 of 18 million <a href="long%20ton">long ton</a>s (20 million <a href="short%20ton">short ton</a>s) of freight each year to about 7 million long tons (7.8 million short tons). The canal is now privately owned by <a href="The%20Peel%20Group">Peel Holdings</a>, whose plans include redevelopment, expansion, and an increase in shipping from 8,000 <a href="Intermodal%20container">containers</a> a year to 100,000 by 2030 as part of their <a href="Atlantic%20Gateway%20%28North%20West%20England%29">Atlantic Gateway</a> project.

The idea that the rivers Mersey and Irwell should be made navigable from the Mersey Estuary in the west to Manchester in the east was first proposed in 1660, and revived in 1712 by the English civil engineer <a href="Thomas%20Steers">Thomas Steers</a>. The necessary legislation was proposed in 1720, and the <a href="Acts%20of%20Parliament%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Act of Parliament</a> for the navigation passed into law in 1721. Construction began in 1724, undertaken by the <a href="Mersey%20and%20Irwell%20Navigation">Mersey & Irwell Navigation Company</a>. By 1734 boats "of moderate size" were able to make the journey from quays near Water Street in Manchester to the <a href="Irish%20Sea">Irish Sea</a>, but the navigation was only suitable for small ships; during periods of low rainfall or when strong easterly winds held back the tide in the estuary, there was not always sufficient depth of water for a fully laden boat. The completion in 1776 of the Runcorn extension of the Bridgewater Canal, followed in 1830 by the opening of the <a href="Liverpool%20and%20Manchester%20Railway">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a>, intensified competition for the carriage of goods. In 1825 an application had been made to Parliament for an Act to allow the construction of a ship canal between the mouth of the <a href="River%20Dee%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">River Dee</a> and Manchester at a cost of £1 million, but "the necessary forms not having been observed", it did not become law. In 1844 ownership of the Mersey & Irwell Navigation was transferred to the Bridgewater Trustees, and in 1872 it was sold to The Bridgewater Navigation Company for £1.112 million. The navigation had by then fallen into disrepair, its owners preferring instead to maintain the more profitable canal; in 1882 the navigation was described as being "hopelessly choked with silt and filth", and was closed to all but the smaller boats for 264 out of 311 working days.
Along with deteriorating economic conditions in the 1870s and the start of a period known as the Long Depression, the dues charged by the <a href="Port%20of%20Liverpool">Port of Liverpool</a> and the railway charges from there to Manchester were perceived to be excessive by Manchester's business community; it was often cheaper to import goods from <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>, on the opposite side of the country, than it was from Liverpool. A <a href="ship%20canal">ship canal</a> was proposed as a way to reduce carriage charges, avoid payment of dock and town dues at Liverpool, and bypass the <a href="Liverpool%20to%20Manchester%20Lines">Liverpool to Manchester railways</a> by giving Manchester direct access to the sea for its imports and its exports of manufactured goods. Historian Ian Harford suggested that the canal may also have been conceived as an "imaginative response to [the] problems of depression and unemployment" that Manchester was experiencing during the early 1880s. Its proponents argued that reduced transport costs would make local industry more competitive, and that the scheme would help create new jobs.

The idea was championed by Manchester manufacturer <a href="Daniel%20Adamson">Daniel Adamson</a>, who arranged a meeting at his home, <a href="the%20Towers%20%28Manchester%29">The Towers</a> in <a href="Didsbury">Didsbury</a>, on 27 June 1882. He invited the representatives of several <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> towns, local businessmen and politicians, and two civil engineers: <a href="Hamilton%20Fulton">Hamilton Fulton</a> and <a href="Edward%20Leader%20Williams">Edward Leader Williams</a>. Fulton's design was for a tidal canal, with no <a href="Canal%20locks">locks</a> and a deepened channel into Manchester. With the city about above sea level, the docks and quays would have been well below the surrounding surface. Williams' plan was to dredge a channel between a set of retaining walls, and build a series of <a href="Lock%20%28water%20transport%29">locks</a> and <a href="sluice">sluice</a>s to lift incoming vessels up to Manchester. Both engineers were invited to submit their proposals, and Williams' plans were selected to form the basis of a bill to be submitted to Parliament later that year.

To generate support for the scheme, the provisional committee initiated a public campaign led by Joseph Lawrence, who had worked for the <a href="Hull%20and%20Barnsley%20Railway">Hull and Barnsley Railway</a>. His task was to set up committees in every ward in Manchester and throughout Lancashire, to raise subscriptions and sell the idea to the local public. The first meeting was held on 4 October in Manchester's Oxford Ward, followed by another on 17 October in the St. James Ward. Within a few weeks meetings had been held throughout Manchester and Salford, culminating in a conference on 3 November attended by the provisional committee and members of the various Ward Committees. A large meeting of the working classes, attended by several local notables including the general secretaries of several trade unions, was held on 13 November at the <a href="Free%20Trade%20Hall">Free Trade Hall</a> in Manchester.

Regular night-time meetings were held across the region, headed by speakers from a range of professions. Harford suggests that the organisers' choice of orators represents their "canny ability" to choose speakers who might move their audiences to support their cause. By adopting techniques used by the <a href="Anti-Corn%20Law%20League">Anti-Corn Law League</a>, their strategy was ultimately successful: local offices were acquired, secretaries hired and further meetings organised. The weekly "Ship Canal Gazette", priced at one penny, was by the end of the year being sold at newsagents in towns across Lancashire. The "Gazette" was part of a prolonged print campaign organised by the committee, to circulate leaflets and pamphlets, and write supportive letters to the local press, often signed with pseudonyms. One of the few surviving leaflets, "The Manchester Ship Canal. Reasons why it Should be Made", argued against dock and railway rates, which were apparently levied "with the object of protecting the interests of Railway kings, [so that] trade is handicapped, and wages kept low". By the end of 1882 the provisional committee comprised members from several of Manchester's large industries, but notably few of the city's wealthier inhabitants. The sympathetic "<a href="Manchester%20City%20News">Manchester City News</a>" reported that "the rich men of South and East Lancashire, with a few notable exceptions, have not rivalled the enthusiasm of the general public".

The Mersey Docks Board opposed the committee's first bill, presented late in 1882, and it was rejected by Parliament in January 1883 for breaching <a href="parliamentary%20procedure">Standing Orders</a>. Within six weeks the committee organised hundreds of petitions from a range of bodies across the country: one representing Manchester was signed by almost 200,000 people. The requirement for Standing Orders was dispensed with, and the represented bill allowed to proceed. Some witnesses against the scheme, worried that a canal would cause the entrance to the Mersey estuary to silt up, blocking traffic, cited the case of Chester harbour. This had silted up due to a man-made cut through the <a href="Dee%20estuary">Dee estuary</a>. Faced with conflicting evidence, Parliament rejected the bill. Later mass meetings were held, including a large demonstration at Pomona Gardens on 24 June 1884. Strong opposition from Liverpool led the House of Commons Committee to reject the committee's second bill on 1 August 1884.

The unresolved question of what would happen to the Mersey estuary if the canal was built had remained a sticking point. During questioning, an engineer for the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board was asked how he would avoid such a problem. His reply, "I should enter at Eastham and carry the canal along the shore until I reached Runcorn, and then I would strike inland", prompted Williams to change his design to include this suggestion. Despite continued opposition, the committee's third bill, presented in November 1884, was passed by Parliament on 2 May 1885, and received royal assent on 6 August, becoming the Manchester Ship Canal Act 1885. Certain conditions were attached; £5 million had to be raised, and the ship canal company was legally obliged to buy both the Bridgewater Canal and the Mersey & Irwell Navigation within two years. The estimated cost of construction was £5.16 million, and the work was expected to take four years to complete.

The enabling Act of Parliament stipulated that the ship canal company's £8 million share capital had to be issued within two years, otherwise the act would lapse. Adamson wanted to encourage the widest possible share ownership, and believed the funds should be raised largely from the working population. <a href="Richard%20Peacock">Richard Peacock</a>, vice-chairman of the Provisional Manchester Ship Canal Committee, said in 1882:

The act forbade the company from issuing shares below £10 so, to make them easier for ordinary people to buy, they issued shilling coupons in books of ten so they could be paid for in instalments. The construction costs and expected competition from the Port of Liverpool put off potential investors; by May 1887 only £3 million had been raised. As a temporary solution Thomas Walker, the contractor selected to construct the canal, agreed to accept £500,000 of the contract price in shares, but raising the remainder required another Act of Parliament to allow the company's share capital to be restructured as £3 million of <a href="stock">ordinary share</a>s and £4 million of <a href="Preferred%20stock">preference shares</a>. Adamson was convinced that the money should be raised from members of the public and opposed the debt restructuring, resigning as chairman of the Ship Canal Committee on 1 February 1887. <a href="Barings%20Bank">Barings</a> and <a href="N%20M%20Rothschild%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">Rothschild</a> jointly issued a prospectus for the sale of the preference shares on 15 July, and by 21 July the issue had been fully <a href="underwriting">underwritten</a>, allowing construction to begin. The <a href="Groundbreaking">first sod</a> was cut on 11 November 1887, by <a href="Wilbraham%20Egerton%2C%201st%20Earl%20Egerton">Lord Egerton of Tatton</a>, who had taken over the chairmanship of the Manchester Ship Canal Company from Adamson.

The canal company exhausted its capital of £8 million in 4 years, when only half the construction work was completed. To avoid bankruptcy they appealed for funds to <a href="Manchester%20City%20Council">Manchester Corporation</a>, which set up a Ship Canal Committee. On 9 March 1891 the corporation decided, on the committee's recommendation, to lend the necessary £3 million, to preserve the city's prestige. In return the corporation was allowed to appoint five of the fifteen members of the board of directors. The company subsequently raised its estimates of the cost of completion in September 1891 and again in June 1892. An executive committee was appointed as an emergency measure in December 1891, and on 14 October 1892 the Ship Canal Committee resolved to lend a further £1.5 million on condition that Manchester Corporation had an absolute majority on the canal company's board of directors and its various sub-committees. The corporation subsequently appointed 11 of the 21 seats, nominated <a href="Alderman">Alderman</a> Sir John Harwood as deputy director of the company, and secured majorities on five of the board's six sub-committees. The cost to Manchester Corporation of financing the Ship Canal Company had a significant impact on local taxpayers. Manchester's municipal debt rose by 67 per cent, resulting in a 26 per cent increase in <a href="rates%20%28tax%29">rates</a> between 1892 and 1895.
However well this arrangement served the corporation, by the mid-1980s it had become "meaningless". Most of the company's shares were controlled by the property developer <a href="John%20Whittaker%20%28businessman%29">John Whittaker</a>, and in 1986 the council agreed to give up all but one of its seats in return for a payment of £10 million. The deal extricated Manchester Council from a politically difficult conflict of interest, as Whittaker was proposing to develop a large out of town shopping centre on land owned by the Ship Canal Company at <a href="Dumplington">Dumplington</a>, the present-day <a href="Trafford%20Centre">Trafford Centre</a>. The council opposed the scheme, believing that it would damage the city centre economy, but accepted that it was "obviously in the interests of the shareholders".

<a href="Thomas%20A.%20Walker">Thomas Walker</a> was appointed as contractor, with Edward Leader Williams as chief engineer and designer and general manager. The route was divided into eight sections, with one engineer responsible for each. The first reached from <a href="Eastham%2C%20Merseyside">Eastham</a> to <a href="Ellesmere%20Port">Ellesmere Port</a>. <a href="Mount%20Manisty">Mount Manisty</a>, a large mound of earth on a narrow stretch between the canal and the Mersey northwest of Ellesmere Port, was constructed from soil taken from the excavations. It and the adjacent Manisty Cutting were named after the engineer in charge. The last section built was the passage from Weston Point through the <a href="Runcorn%20Gap">Runcorn gap</a> to <a href="Norton%2C%20Runcorn">Norton</a>; the existing docks at Runcorn and <a href="Weston%2C%20Cheshire">Weston</a> had to be kept operational until they could be connected to the completed western sections of the ship canal.

For the first two years construction went according to plan, but Walker died on 25 November 1889. While the work was continued by his executors, the project suffered a number of setbacks and was hampered by harsh weather and several serious floods. In January 1891, when the project had been expected to have been completed, a severe winter added to the difficulties; the Bridgewater Canal, the company's only source of income, was closed after a fall of ice. The company decided to take over the contracting work and bought all the on site equipment for £400,000. Some railway companies, whose bridges had to be modified to cross the canal, demanded compensation. The <a href="London%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">London and North Western Railway</a> and <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> refused to cooperate, and between them they demanded about £533,000 for inconvenience. The Ship Canal Company was unable to demolish the older, low railway bridges until August 1893, when the matter went to arbitration. The railway companies were awarded just over £100,000, a fraction of their combined claims.
By the end of 1891, the ship canal was open to shipping as far as Saltport, the name given to wharves built at the entrance to the <a href="Weaver%20Navigation">Weaver Navigation</a>. The success of the new port was a source of consternation to merchants in Liverpool, who suddenly found themselves cut out of the trade in goods such as timber, and a source of encouragement to shipping companies, who began to realise the advantages an inland port would offer. Saltport was rendered useless when the ship canal was completely filled with water in November 1893. The <a href="Manchester%20Ship%20Canal%20Police">Manchester Ship Canal Police</a> were formed the following month, and the canal opened to its first traffic on 1 January 1894. On 21 May, <a href="Victoria%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> performed the official opening, the last of three <a href="Royal%20Visits%20to%20Manchester%20and%20Salford%20During%20the%20Reign%20of%20Queen%20Victoria">royal visits</a> she made to Manchester. During the ceremony she knighted the Mayor of Salford, William Henry Bailey, and the Lord Mayor of Manchester, Anthony Marshall; Edward Leader Williams was knighted on 2 July by <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a>.

The ship canal took six years to complete at a cost of just over £15 million, equivalent to about £1.65 billion in 2011. It is still the longest river navigation canal and remains the world's eighth-longest ship canal, only slightly shorter than the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> in Central America. More than 54 million cubic yards (41,000,000 m³) of material were excavated, about half as much as was removed during the building of the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>. An average of 12,000 workers were employed during construction, peaking at 17,000. Regular <a href="Navvy">navvies</a> were paid <a href="%C2%A3sd">d</a> per hour for a 10-hour working day, equivalent to about £16 per day in 2010. In terms of machinery, the project made use of more than of temporary rail track, 180 locomotives, more than 6000 trucks and wagons, 124 steam-powered cranes, 192 other steam engines, and 97 steam excavators. Major engineering landmarks of the scheme included the <a href="Barton%20Swing%20Aqueduct">Barton Swing Aqueduct</a>, the first swing aqueduct in the world, and a neighbouring <a href="swing%20bridge">swing bridge</a> for road traffic at <a href="Barton-upon-Irwell">Barton</a>, both of which are now Grade II* listed structures. In 1909 the canal's depth was increased by to , equalling that of the Suez Canal.

The Manchester Ship Canal enabled the newly created <a href="Port%20of%20Manchester">Port of Manchester</a> to become Britain's third-busiest port, despite the city being about inland. Since its opening in 1894 the canal has handled a wide range of ships and cargos, from coastal vessels to intra-European shipping and intercontinental cargo liners. The first vessel to unload its cargo on the opening day was the "Pioneer", belonging to the <a href="The%20Co-operative%20Group">Co-operative Wholesale Society</a> (CWS), which was also the first vessel registered at Manchester; the CWS operated a weekly service to <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>.

<a href="Manchester%20Liners">Manchester Liners</a> established regular sailings by large ocean-going vessels. In late 1898 the "Manchester City", at 7,698 <a href="gross%20tonnage">gross tons</a>, became the largest vessel to reach the terminal docks. Carrying cattle and general cargo, it was met by the Lord Mayor of Manchester and a large welcoming crowd. In 1968 Manchester Liners converted its fleet to container vessels only. To service them it built two dedicated container terminals next to No. 9 Dock. The four container vessels commissioned that year, each of 11,898 gross tons, were the largest ever to make regular use of the terminal docks at Salford. In 1974 the canal handled 2.9 million long tons (3.25 million short tons) of dry cargo, 27 per cent of which was carried by Manchester Liners. The dry tonnage was, and is still, greatly supplemented by crude and refined oil products transported in large tanker ships to and from the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II%20Dock">Queen Elizabeth II Dock</a> at Eastham and the <a href="Stanlow%20Refinery">Stanlow Refinery</a> just east of Ellesmere Port, and also in smaller tankers to Runcorn. The limitations imposed by the canal on the maximum size of container vessel meant that by the mid-1970s Manchester Liners was becoming uncompetitive; the company sold its last ship in 1985.

The amount of freight carried by the canal peaked in 1958 at 18 million long tons (20 million short tons), but the increasing size of ocean-going ships and the port's failure to introduce modern freight-handling methods resulted in that headline figure dropping steadily, and the closure of the docks in Salford in 1984. Total freight movements on the ship canal were down to 7.56 million long tons (8.47 million short tons) by 2000, and further reduced to 6.60 million long tons (7.39 million short tons) for the year ending September 2009.

The maximum length of vessel currently accepted is with a beam of and a maximum draft of . By contrast the similarly sized <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>, completed a few years after the Manchester Ship Canal, was able to accept ships of up to in length with a beam of . Since June 2016, the Panama Canal has been able to handle vessels of in length with a beam of and a draft of , and cargo capacity up to . Ships passing under the Runcorn Bridge have a height restriction of above normal water levels.

The canal was completed just as the <a href="Long%20Depression">Long Depression</a> was coming to an end, but it was never the commercial success its sponsors had hoped for. At first gross revenue was less than a quarter of expected net revenue, and throughout at least the first nineteen years of the canal it was unable to make a profit or meet the interest payments to the Corporation of Manchester. Many ship owners were reluctant to dispatch ocean-going vessels along a "locked cul-de-sac" at a maximum speed of . The Ship Canal Company found it difficult to attract a diversified export trade, which meant that ships frequently had to return down the canal loaded with ballast rather than freight. The only staple imports attracted to the Port of Manchester were <a href="kerosene">lamp oil</a> and bananas, the latter from 1902 until 1911. As the import trade in oil began to grow during the 20th century the balance of canal traffic switched to the west, from Salford to Stanlow, eventually culminating in the closure of the docks at Salford. Historian Thomas Stuart Willan has observed that "What may seem to require explanation is not the comparative failure of the Ship Canal but the unquenchable vitality of the myth of its success".

Unlike most other British canals, the Manchester Ship Canal was never nationalised. In 1984 <a href="City%20of%20Salford">Salford City Council</a> used a derelict land grant to purchase the docks at Salford from the Ship Canal Company, rebranding the area as <a href="Salford%20Quays">Salford Quays</a>. Principal developers Urban Waterside began redevelopment work the following year, by which time traffic on the canal's upper reaches had declined to such an extent that its owners considered closing it above Runcorn. In 1993 the Ship Canal Company was acquired by <a href="Peel%20Holdings">Peel Holdings</a>; as of 2014 it is owned and operated by Peel Ports, which also owns the <a href="Port%20of%20Liverpool">Port of Liverpool</a>. The company announced a £50 billion <a href="Atlantic%20Gateway%20%28North%20West%20England%29">Atlantic Gateway</a> plan in 2011 to develop the Port of Liverpool and the Manchester Ship Canal as a way of combating increasing road congestion. Their scheme involves the construction of a large distribution centre to be named Port Salford and an additional six sites along the canal for the loading and unloading of freight. Peel Ports predict that the number of containers transported along the canal could increase from the 8,000 carried in 2010 to 100,000 by 2030.

From Eastham the canal runs parallel to, and along the south side of the Mersey estuary, past Ellesmere Port. Between <a href="Rixton-with-Glazebrook">Rixton</a> east of the <a href="M6%20motorway">M6 motorway</a>'s <a href="Thelwall%20Viaduct">Thelwall Viaduct</a> and Irlam, the canal joins the Mersey; thereafter it roughly follows the route the river used to take. At the confluence of the Mersey and Irwell near Irlam, the canal follows the old course of the River Irwell into Manchester.

Vessels travelling to and from the terminal docks, which are above sea level, must pass through several locks. Each set has a large lock for ocean-going ships and a smaller, narrower lock for vessels such as tugs and coasters. The entrance locks at Eastham on the <a href="Wirral%20Peninsula">Wirral</a> side of the Mersey, which seal off the tidal estuary, are the largest on the canal. The larger lock is long by wide; the smaller lock is by . Four additional sets of locks lie further inland, long and wide and by for the smaller lock; each has a rise of approximately . The locks are at Eastham; <a href="Latchford">Latchford</a>, near Warrington; Irlam; <a href="Barton-upon-Irwell">Barton</a> near <a href="Eccles%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Eccles</a> and Mode Wheel, Salford.

Five sets of sluices and two weirs are used to control the canal's depth. The sluices, located at Mode Wheel Locks, Barton Locks, Irlam Locks, Latchford Locks and Weaver Sluices, are designed to allow water entering the canal to flow along its length in a controlled manner. Each consists of a set of mechanically driven vertical steel roller gates, supported by masonry piers. Originally, manually operated <a href="Francis%20Goold%20Morony%20Stoney">Stoney Sluice</a>s were used; these were replaced in the 1950s by electrically driven units, with automation technology introduced from the late 1980s. The sluices are protected against damage from drifting vessels by large concrete barriers. Stop logs can be inserted by roving cranes, installed upstream of each sluice; at Weaver Sluices, accessed by boat, this task is performed by a floating crane.

Woolston Siphon Weir, built in 1994 to replace an earlier structure and located on an extant section of the Mersey near Latchford, controls the amount of water in the Latchford <a href="Canal%20pound">Pond</a> by emptying canal water into the Mersey. Howley Weir controls water levels downstream of Woolston Weir. Further upstream, Woolston Guard Weir enables maintenance to be carried out on both.

Seven terminal docks were constructed for the opening of the canal. Four small docks were located on the south side of the canal near Cornbrook, within the Borough of <a href="Stretford">Stretford</a>: Pomona Docks No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4. The three main docks, built primarily for large ocean-going vessels, were in <a href="Salford%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Salford</a>, to the west of Trafford Road on the north bank of the canal, docks No. 6, No. 7, and No. 8. In 1905, No. 9 Dock was completed on the same site. Dock No. 5, known as Ordsall Dock, was part of Pomona Docks, but was dug on the Salford side of the river; it was never completed and was filled in around 1905.

<a href="Pomona%20Docks">Pomona Docks</a> have also been filled in except for the still intact No. 3 Dock, and are largely derelict. A lock at No. 3 Dock connects it to the nearby Bridgewater Canal at the point where the two canals run in parallel. The western four docks have been converted into the Salford Quays development; ships using the Manchester Ship Canal now dock at various places along the canal side such as Mode Wheel (Salford), Trafford Park, and Ellesmere Port. Most ships have to terminate at Salford Quays, although vessels capable of passing under Trafford Road swing bridge (permanently closed in 1992) can continue up the River Irwell to Hunts Bank, near <a href="Manchester%20Cathedral">Manchester Cathedral</a>.

In 1893 the Ship Canal Company sold a parcel of land just east of the Mode Wheel Locks to the newly established Manchester Dry Docks Company. The <a href="Drydock%23Types">graving docks</a> were constructed adjacent to the south bank of the canal, and a floating pontoon dock was built nearby. Each of the three graving docks could accommodate ocean-going ships of up to in length and in beam, equivalent to vessels of 8,000 gross tons. <a href="Manchester%20Liners">Manchester Liners</a> acquired control of the company in 1974, to ensure the availability of facilities for the repair of its fleet of ships.

Two years after the opening of the ship canal, financier <a href="Ernest%20Terah%20Hooley">Ernest Terah Hooley</a> bought the country estate belonging to <a href="Sir%20Humphrey%20de%20Trafford%2C%203rd%20Baronet">Sir Humphrey Francis de Trafford</a> for £360,000 (£ in ). Hooley intended to develop the site, which was close to Manchester and at the end of the canal, as an exclusive housing estate, screened by woods from industrial units constructed along the frontage onto the canal.

With the predicted traffic for the canal slow to materialise, Hooley and <a href="Marshall%20Stevens">Marshall Stevens</a> (the general manager of the Ship Canal Company) came to see the benefits that the industrial development of Trafford Park could offer to both the ship canal and the estate. In January 1897 Stevens became the managing director of Trafford Park Estates, where he remained until 1930, latterly as its joint chairman and managing director.

Within five years Trafford Park, Europe's largest <a href="industrial%20estate">industrial estate</a>, was home to forty firms. The earliest structures on the canal side were <a href="grain%20silo">grain silo</a>s; the grain was used for flour and as <a href="Sailing%20ballast">ballast</a> for ships carrying raw <a href="cotton">cotton</a>. The wooden silo built opposite No.9 Dock in 1898 (destroyed in the <a href="Manchester%20Blitz">Manchester Blitz</a> in 1940) was Europe's largest grain elevator. The CWS bought land on Trafford Wharf in 1903, where it opened a bacon factory and a flour mill. In 1906 it bought the Sun Mill, which it extended in 1913 to create the UK's largest flour mill, with its own wharf, elevators and silos.

Inland from the canal <a href="British%20Westinghouse">the British Westinghouse Electric Company</a> bought 11 per cent of the estate. Westinghouse's American architect <a href="Charles%20Heathcote">Charles Heathcote</a> was responsible for much of the planning and design of their factory, which built <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s and <a href="turbo%20generator">turbo generator</a>s. By 1899 Heathcote had also designed fifteen warehouses for the Manchester Ship Canal Company.

During construction, a year after the death of Walker, the directors of the canal company and Walker's trustee's came to an agreement for the canal company to take ownership of the construction assets. These included the more than of temporary rail track, 180 locomotives and more than 6,000 trucks and wagons. These formed the basis of the Manchester Ship Canal Railway, which became the largest private railway in the United Kingdom.

The construction railway followed the route of the former River Irwell. To bring in construction materials, the construction railway had a connection to the <a href="Cheshire%20Lines%20Committee">Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC)</a> east of <a href="Irlam%20railway%20station">Irlam railway station</a>. Every month this allowed more than 10,000 tons of <a href="coal">coal</a> and 8,000 tons of <a href="cement">cement</a> to be delivered to sites along the canal excavation. All existing railway companies with lines along the route had been given notice that their lines had to either be abandoned by a given date or raised to give a minimum of clearance with all deviation construction costs to be paid by the MSC. The CLC <a href="Glazebrook">Glazebrook</a> to Woodley mainline passed over the River Mersey at <a href="Cadishead">Cadishead</a> and so they decided to build a deviation. Construction of the <a href="Cadishead%20Viaduct">Cadishead Viaduct</a> began in 1892, approached via earth banks, with two brick arches accessing a multi-lattice iron girder centre span of in length. It opened to freight on 27 February 1893 and to passenger traffic on 29 May 1893. Following the withdrawal of passenger services in 1964, the line became freight only. When expensive repairs to the viaduct were needed in the early 1980s <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a> opted to close it, together with the line to Glazebrook.

At the end of construction, the canal company left in place the original construction railway route, and eventually developed track along of the canal's length, mainly to its north bank. Built and operated mainly as a single track line, the busiest section from Weaste Junction through Barton and Irlam, to Partington was all double tracked. The railway's access to Trafford Park was over the double-tracked Detroit Swing Bridge, which after closure of the MSC Railway in 1988 was floated down the canal to be placed in Salford Quays. The only major deviation was to allow construction of the <a href="Co-operative%20Wholesale%20Society">CWS</a> Irlam soap works and the adjacent <a href="Lancashire%20Steel%20Corporation">Partington Steel & Iron Co.</a> works at Partington (both of which had their own private railways and locomotives), with the MSC Railway's deviation route pushed south to run alongside the canal's north bank and under the Irlam viaduct. The canal company also developed large complexes of sidings along the route, built to service freight to and from the canal's docks and nearby industrial estates, especially at: Salford Docks; Trafford Park; Partington North Coaling Basin (both sides of the canal); Glazebrook sidings; and a small but busy marshalling yard east of Irlam locks. Unlike most other railway companies in the UK it was not nationalised in 1948, and at its peak it had 790 employees, 75 locomotives, 2,700 wagons and more than of track.

The MSC Railway was able to receive and despatch goods trains to and from all the UK's main line railway systems, using connecting junctions at three points in the terminal docks. Two were to the north of the canal, operated by the <a href="Lancashire%20and%20Yorkshire%20Railway">Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway</a> and the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">London and North Western Railway</a>. The third was to the south, operated by the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC), where by the MSC Railway had taken over the old and abandoned route of the CLC, giving them a monopoly on traffic to the new soap works and steel mill.

The MSC Railway's steam locomotives were designed to negotiate the tight-radius curves of the sidings and industrial tracks on which they ran. Originally only hence specifying 0-4-0 wheel arrangements, later 0-6-0 locomotives - purchased to cope with increasing traffic and loads - had flangeless centre axles, whilst the coupling rods had a hinged central section that permitted several inches of lateral play. A long term user of <a href="Hudswell%20Clarke">Hudswell Clarke</a>, from their steam through to diesel locomotives, like many industrial railways later motive power was often provided by the purchase of refurbished former "big-four" operated types, with the advantage that crew were hence readily available to operate these types. Post-WWII purchases included several war surplus <a href="Hunslet%20Austerity%200-6-0ST">Hunslet 'Austerity'</a> 0-6-0 saddle tanks; the last steam locomotive types purchased for the MSC Railway. A fleet of diesel locomotives was purchased between 1959 and 1966, including 18 0-4-0 diesels from the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Limited">Rolls-Royce</a>-owned <a href="Sentinel%20Waggon%20Works">Sentinel Waggon Works</a> from 1964-66. These enabled the MSC Railways to complete its conversion from steam on 6 July 1966, more than three years before British Railways.

However, as transshipment costs increased, and unprocessed bulk cargos decreased in volume, the economics of road transport resulted in a gradual dwindling of traffic on the MSC Railway system, and hence contraction in the MSC Railway itself. Traffic reduction was added to by: the 1969 closure of the CWS Irlam soap works; post nationalisation <a href="British%20Steel%20Corporation">British Steel Corporation</a> building their own line to Glazebrook to junction with BR; and severe reductions in traffic of <a href="Imperial%20Chemical%20Industries">ICI's</a> soda ash trains, <a href="British%20Tar%20Products">British Tar Products</a> and reduced domestic coal consumption. With the remaining engines stationed at Ellesmere Port and Stanlow, maintenance on the line from Irlam through to Partington was halted in late summer 1977, and all through traffic except engineering trains stopped on 21 December 1977. The through line was officially closed to all traffic in 1978, but many of the sidings complexes remained; the last operational section of the MSC Railway, at Trafford Park, closed on 30 April 2009.

At Ellesmere Port the canal is joined by the <a href="Shropshire%20Union%20Canal">Shropshire Union Canal</a>, at a site now occupied by the <a href="National%20Waterways%20Museum%2C%20Ellesmere%20Port">National Waterways Museum</a>. The area formerly consisted of a canal port linking the Shropshire Union Canal to the River Mersey. Designed by <a href="Thomas%20Telford">Thomas Telford</a>, it remained operational until the 1950s. It was a "marvellously self-contained world" with <a href="Lock%20%28water%20transport%29">locks</a>, <a href="Dock%20%28maritime%29">docks</a>, warehouses, a blacksmith's forge, stables, and cottages for the workers. Its Island Warehouse was built in 1871 to store grain. A few miles from Ellesmere Port, at Weston, near <a href="Runcorn">Runcorn</a>, the ship canal also connects with the Weaver Navigation.

Significant crossings of the Canal include:

The quality of water in the ship canal remains adversely affected by several factors. The high population density of the Mersey Basin has, historically, placed heavy demands on sewage treatment and disposal. Industrial and agricultural discharges into the Irwell, <a href="River%20Medlock">Medlock</a>, and <a href="River%20Irk">Irk</a> rivers are responsible for a number of industrial contaminants found in the canal. Matters have improved since 1990, when the <a href="National%20Rivers%20Authority">National Rivers Authority</a> found the area between Trafford Road Bridge and Mode Wheel Locks to be "grossly polluted". The water was <a href="anoxic%20waters">depleted of dissolved oxygen</a>, which in the latter half of the 20th century often resulted in toxic sediments normally present at the bottom of the <a href="turning%20basin">turning basin</a> in what is now Salford Quays rising to the surface during the summer months, giving the impression of solid ground. Previously, only <a href="Common%20Roach">roach</a> and <a href="stickleback">stickleback</a>s could be found in the canal's upper levels, and then only during the colder parts of the year, but an oxygenation project implemented at Salford Quays from 2001, together with the gradual reduction of industrial pollutants from the Mersey's tributaries, has encouraged the migration into the canal of fish populations from further upstream. The canal's water quality remains low, with <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> and <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a> in particular present at "extremely high levels". Episodic pollution and a lack of habitat remain problems for wildlife, although in 2005, for the first time in living memory, <a href="salmon">salmon</a> were observed breeding in the <a href="River%20Goyt">River Goyt</a> (a part of the Mersey's catchment). In 2010 the Environment Agency issued a report concluding that the canal "does not pose a significant barrier to salmon movement or impact on migratory behaviours".

Despite the canal's poor water quality there are several nature reserves along its banks. <a href="Wigg%20Island">Wigg Island</a>, a former <a href="brownfield%20site">brownfield site</a> east of <a href="Runcorn">Runcorn</a>, contains a network of public footpaths through newly planted woodlands and meadows. Among the wildlife species found there are <a href="butterfly">butterflies</a>, <a href="dragonfly">dragonflies</a>, <a href="kestrel">kestrel</a>s, <a href="swallow">swallow</a>s and <a href="house%20martin">house martin</a>s. Further upstream the <a href="Moore%20Nature%20Reserve">Moore Nature Reserve</a>, which is bisected by the de-watered <a href="Runcorn%20to%20Latchford%20Canal">Runcorn to Latchford Canal</a>, comprises lakes, woodland and meadows. The reserve is open to the public and contains a number of <a href="bird%20hide">bird hide</a>s, from which native <a href="owl">owl</a>s and <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a>s may be viewed. Near <a href="Thelwall">Thelwall</a>, <a href="Woolston%20Eyes">Woolston Eyes</a> (a corruption of the Saxon "<a href="Ees%20%28place%20name%29">Ees</a>"), is a <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a>. It is used as a deposit for canal <a href="dredge">dredgings</a> and is a habitat for many species of bird, including <a href="black-necked%20grebe">black-necked grebe</a>s, <a href="grasshopper%20warbler">grasshopper warbler</a>s, <a href="blackcap">blackcap</a>s and <a href="common%20whitethroat">common whitethroat</a>s. <a href="Great%20crested%20newt">Great crested newt</a>s and <a href="Viperidae">adder</a>s are present, and local flora includes <a href="orchids">orchids</a> and <a href="broad-leaved%20helleborine">broad-leaved helleborine</a>s.

Lynx (constellation)

Lynx is a <a href="constellation">constellation</a> named after <a href="lynx">the animal</a>, usually observed in the <a href="Northern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Northern Celestial Hemisphere</a>. The constellation was introduced in the late 17th century by <a href="Johannes%20Hevelius">Johannes Hevelius</a>. It is a faint constellation, with its brightest stars forming a zigzag line. The orange giant <a href="Alpha%20Lyncis">Alpha Lyncis</a> is the brightest star in the constellation, and the <a href="semiregular%20variable">semiregular variable</a> star <a href="Y%20Lyncis">Y Lyncis</a> is a target for <a href="amateur%20astronomy">amateur astronomers</a>. Six <a href="star%20system">star system</a>s have been found to contain <a href="exoplanet">planets</a>. Those of <a href="6%20Lyncis">6 Lyncis</a> and <a href="HD%2075898">HD 75898</a> were discovered by the <a href="Doppler%20spectroscopy">Doppler method</a>; those of <a href="XO-2%20%28star%29">XO-2</a>, <a href="XO-4">XO-4</a>, <a href="XO-5">XO-5</a> and <a href="WASP-13">WASP-13</a> were observed as they <a href="Methods%20of%20detecting%20extrasolar%20planets%23Transit%20method">passed in front of the host star</a>.

Within the constellation's borders lie <a href="NGC%202419">NGC 2419</a>, an unusually remote <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a>; the galaxy <a href="NGC%202770">NGC 2770</a>, which has hosted three recent <a href="Type%20Ib%20and%20Ic%20supernovae">Type Ib supernova</a>e; the distant <a href="quasar">quasar</a> <a href="APM%2008279%2B5255">APM 08279+5255</a>, whose light is magnified and split into multiple images by the <a href="gravitational%20lens">gravitational lens</a>ing effect of a foreground galaxy; and the <a href="Lynx%20Supercluster">Lynx Supercluster</a>, which was the most distant <a href="supercluster">supercluster</a> known at the time of its discovery in 1999

Polish astronomer <a href="Johannes%20Hevelius">Johannes Hevelius</a> formed the constellation in 1687 from 19 faint stars between the constellations <a href="Ursa%20Major">Ursa Major</a> and <a href="Auriga%20%28constellation%29">Auriga</a> that earlier had been part of the obsolete constellation <a href="Jordanus%20%28constellation%29">Jordanus Fluvius</a>. Naming it Lynx because of its faintness, he challenged future stargazers to see it, declaring that only the lynx-eyed (those with good sight) would have been able to recognize it. Hevelius used the name Tigris (Tiger) in his catalogue as well, but kept the former name only in his atlas. English astronomer <a href="John%20Flamsteed">John Flamsteed</a> adopted the constellation in his catalogue, published in 1712, and his subsequent atlas. According to 19th-century amateur astronomer <a href="Richard%20Hinckley%20Allen">Richard Hinckley Allen</a>, the chief stars in Lynx "might well have been utilized by the modern constructor, whoever he was, of our Ursa Major to complete the quartette of feet."

Lynx is bordered by <a href="Camelopardalis">Camelopardalis</a> to the north, Auriga to the west, <a href="Gemini%20%28constellation%29">Gemini</a> to the southwest, <a href="Cancer%20%28constellation%29">Cancer</a> to the south, <a href="Leo%20%28constellation%29">Leo</a> to the east and Ursa Major to the northeast. Covering 545.4 square degrees and 1.322% of the night sky, it ranks <a href="88%20modern%20constellations%20by%20area">28th of the 88 constellations</a> in size, surpassing better known constellations such as Gemini. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is 'Lyn'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 20 segments ("illustrated in infobox"). In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , and the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between +32.97° and +61.96°. On dark nights, the brighter stars can be seen as a crooked line extending roughly between Camelopardalis and Leo, and north of the bright star <a href="Castor%20%28star%29">Castor</a>. Lynx is most readily observed from the late winter to late summer to northern hemisphere observers, with midnight <a href="culmination">culmination</a> occurring on 20 January. The whole constellation is visible to observers north of latitude <a href="28th%20parallel%20south">28°S</a>.

English astronomer <a href="Francis%20Baily">Francis Baily</a> gave a single star a <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>—<a href="Alpha%20Lyncis">Alpha Lyncis</a>—while Flamsteed numbered 44 stars, though several lie across the boundary in Ursa Major. Overall, there are 97 stars within the constellation's borders brighter than or equal to <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 6.5.

The brightest star in this constellation is Alpha Lyncis, with an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent (visual) magnitude</a> of 3.14. It is an <a href="Stellar%20classification%23Modern%20classification">orange</a> <a href="giant%20star">giant</a> of <a href="Stellar%20classification%23Spectral%20types">spectral type</a> K7III located 203 ± 2 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s distant from Earth. Around twice as massive as the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, it has exhausted the <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> at its <a href="stellar%20structure">core</a> and has <a href="Stellar%20evolution%23Mature%20stars">evolved away</a> from the <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a>. The star has swollen to about 55 times the <a href="solar%20radius">Sun's radius</a> and is emitting roughly 673 times the <a href="solar%20luminosity">luminosity of the Sun</a>. The <a href="stellar%20atmosphere">stellar atmosphere</a> has cooled, giving it a surface temperature of 3,880 <a href="Kelvin">K</a>. The only star with a <a href="proper%20names%20%28astronomy%29">proper name</a> is <a href="Alsciaukat">Alsciaukat</a> (from the <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> for thorn), also known as 31 Lyncis, located 380 ± 10 light-years from Earth. This star is also an evolved giant with around twice the Sun's mass that has swollen and cooled since exhausting its core hydrogen. It is anywhere from 59 to 75 times as wide as the Sun, and 740 times as luminous. Alsciaukat is also a variable star, ranging in brightness by 0.05 magnitude over 25 to 30 days from its baseline magnitude of 4.25.

Lynx is rich in <a href="double%20star">double star</a>s. The second brightest star in the constellation is <a href="38%20Lyncis">38 Lyncis</a> at magnitude 3.8. When viewed through a moderate telescope, the two components—a brighter blue-white star of magnitude 3.9 and a fainter star of magnitude 6.1 that has been described as lilac as well as blue-white—can be seen. <a href="15%20Lyncis">15 Lyncis</a> is another star that is found to be a double system when viewed through a telescope, separating into two yellowish stars of magnitudes 4.7 and 5.8 that are 0.9 arcseconds apart. The components are a yellow giant of spectral type G8III that is around 4.01 times as massive as the Sun, and a <a href="F-type%20main%20sequence%20star">yellow-white main sequence star</a> of spectral type F8V that is around 3.73 times as massive as the Sun. Orbiting each other every 262 years, the stars are 178 ± 2 light years distant from Earth. <a href="12%20Lyncis">12 Lyncis</a> has a combined apparent magnitude of 4.87. When seen through a telescope, it can be separated into three stars: two components with magnitudes 5.4 and 6.0 that lie at an <a href="angular%20separation">angular separation</a> by 1.8<a href="arcsecond">″</a> (as of 1992) and a yellow-hued star of magnitude 7.2 at a separation of 8.6″ (as of 1990). The two brighter stars are estimated to orbit each other with a period that is poorly known but estimated to be roughly 700 to 900 years. The 12 Lyncis system is 210 ± 10 light years distant from Earth.

<a href="10%20Ursae%20Majoris">10 Ursae Majoris</a> is the third-brightest star in Lynx. Originally in the neighbouring constellation Ursa Major, it became part of Lynx with the official establishment of the constellation's borders. Appearing to be of magnitude 3.97, a telescope reveals a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F4V of magnitude 4.11 and a star very similar to the Sun of spectral type G5V and magnitude 6.18. The two are 10.6 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s (au) apart and orbit each other every 21.78 years. The system is 52.4 ± 0.6 light-years distant from Earth. Likewise <a href="16%20Lyncis">16 Lyncis</a> was originally known as Psi Aurigae and conversely, <a href="37%20Lyncis">37</a>, <a href="39%20Lyncis">39</a>, <a href="41%20Lyncis">41</a> and <a href="44%20Lyncis">44 Lyncis</a> became part of Ursa Major.

<a href="Y%20Lyncis">Y Lyncis</a> is a popular target among amateur astronomers, as it is a <a href="semiregular%20variable">semiregular variable</a> ranging in brightness from magnitude 6.2 to 8.9. These shifts in brightness are complex, with a shorter period of 110 days due to the star's pulsations, and a longer period of 1400 days possibly due to the star's rotation or regular cycles in its <a href="convection%20zone">convection</a>. A <a href="red%20supergiant">red supergiant</a>, it has an estimated diameter around 580 times that of the Sun, is around 1.5 to 2 times as massive, and has a <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> around 25,000 times that of the Sun. <a href="1%20Lyncis">1 Lyncis</a> and <a href="UX%20Lyncis">UX Lyncis</a> are <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a>s that are also semiregular variables with complex fluctuations in brightness.

Six star systems have been found to contain <a href="exoplanet">exoplanet</a>s, of which two were discovered by the <a href="Doppler%20spectroscopy">Doppler method</a> and four by the transit method. <a href="6%20Lyncis">6 Lyncis</a>, an orange subgiant that spent much of its life as an A-type or F-type main sequence star, is orbited by a planet with a <a href="minimum%20mass">minimum mass</a> of 2.4 <a href="Jupiter%20mass">Jupiter mass</a>es and an <a href="orbital%20period">orbital period</a> of 899 days. <a href="HD%2075898">HD 75898</a> is a 3.8 ± 0.8 billion-year-old yellow star of spectral type G0V that has just begun expanding and cooling off the main sequence. It has a planet at least 2.51 times as massive as Jupiter orbiting with a period of around 418 days. The centre of mass of the system is accelerating, indicating there is a third, more distant, component at least the size of Jupiter. Three star systems were found to have planets that were observed by the <a href="XO%20Telescope">XO Telescope</a> in Hawaii as they <a href="Methods%20of%20detecting%20extrasolar%20planets%23Transit%20method">passed in front of them</a>. <a href="XO-2%20%28star%29">XO-2</a> is a <a href="binary%20system">binary star system</a>, both the stars of which are slightly less massive and cooler than the Sun and have planetary companions: XO-2S has a <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>-mass planet at 0.13 au distance with a period of around 18 days, and one a little more massive than <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> at a distance of 0.48 au and with a period of around 120 days, and XO-2N has a <a href="hot%20Jupiter">hot Jupiter</a> with around half Jupiter's mass that has an orbit of only 2.6 days. <a href="XO-4">XO-4</a> is an F-type main sequence star that is a little hotter and more massive than the Sun that has a hot Jupiter orbiting with a period of around 4.1 days. <a href="XO-5">XO-5</a> is a Sun-like star with a hot Jupiter about as massive as Jupiter that takes around 4.2 days to complete an orbit. <a href="WASP-13">WASP-13</a>, a Sun-like star that has begun to swell and cool off the main sequence, had a transiting planet discovered by the <a href="SuperWASP">SuperWASP</a> program in 2009. The planet is around half as massive as Jupiter and takes 4.35 days to complete a revolution.

Lynx's most notable <a href="deep%20sky%20object">deep sky object</a> is <a href="NGC%202419">NGC 2419</a>, also called the "Intergalactic Wanderer" as it was assumed to lie outside the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. At a distance of between 275,000 and 300,000 light-years from Earth, it is one of the most distant known <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a>s within our galaxy. NGC 2419 is likely in a highly elliptical orbit around the Milky Way. It has a magnitude of 10.3 and is a <a href="Shapley%E2%80%93Sawyer%20Concentration%20Class">Shapley class II</a> cluster; this classification indicates that it is extremely concentrated at its center. Originally thought to be a star, NGC 2419 was discovered to be a globular cluster by American astronomer <a href="Carl%20Otto%20Lampland">Carl Lampland</a>.

<a href="NGC%202537">NGC 2537</a>, known as the Bear's Paw Galaxy, lies about 3 degrees north-northwest of 31 Lyncis. It is a <a href="blue%20compact%20dwarf%20galaxy">blue compact dwarf galaxy</a> that is somewhere between 17 and 30 million light-years away from Earth. Close by is <a href="IC%202233">IC 2233</a>, a very flat and thin spiral galaxy that is between 26 and 40 million light-years away from Earth. A comparatively quiet galaxy with a low rate of star formation (less than one solar mass every twenty years), it was long suspected to be interacting with the Bear's Paw galaxy. This is now considered highly unlikely as observations with the <a href="Karl%20G.%20Jansky%20Very%20Large%20Array">Very Large Array</a> showed the two galaxies lie at different distances.

The <a href="NGC%202841%20group">NGC 2841 group</a> is a <a href="galaxy%20group">group of galaxies</a> that lie both in Lynx and neighbouring Ursa Major. It includes the loose triplet <a href="NGC%202541">NGC 2541</a>, <a href="NGC%202500">NGC 2500</a>, and <a href="NGC%202552">NGC 2552</a> within Lynx. Using cepheids of NGC 2541 as <a href="Cosmic%20distance%20ladder%23Standard%20candles">standard candles</a>, the distance to that galaxy (and the group) has been estimated at around 40 million light–years. <a href="NGC%202841">NGC 2841</a> itself lies in Ursa Major.

<a href="NGC%202770">NGC 2770</a> is a <a href="Galaxy%20morphological%20classification">type SASc</a> <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a> located about 88 million light–years away that has hosted <a href="Type%20Ib%20and%20Ic%20supernovae">Type Ib supernova</a>e: <a href="SN%201999eh">SN 1999eh</a>, <a href="SN%202007uy">SN 2007uy</a>, and <a href="SN%202008D">SN 2008D</a>. The last of these is famous for being the first supernova detected by the <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s released very early on in its formation, rather than by the optical <a href="light">light</a> emitted during later stages, which allowed the first moments of the outburst to be observed. It is possible that NGC 2770's interactions with a suspected companion galaxy may have created the massive stars causing this activity. <a href="UGC%204904">UGC 4904</a> is a galaxy located about 77 million light-years from Earth. On 20 October 2004, a <a href="supernova%20impostor">supernova impostor</a> was observed by Japanese amateur astronomer Koichi Itagaki within the galaxy. Observations of its spectrum suggest that it shed massive amounts of material in a two-year period, transforming from a <a href="Luminous%20blue%20variable%20star">LBV</a> star to a <a href="Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet%20star">Wolf–Rayet star</a>, before it was observed erupting as <a href="hypernova">hypernova</a> <a href="SN%202006jc">SN 2006jc</a> on October 11, 2006.

<a href="APM%2008279%2B5255">APM 08279+5255</a> is a very distant, broad absorption line <a href="quasar">quasar</a> discovered in 1998 and initially considered the most luminous object yet found. It is magnified and split into multiple images by the <a href="gravitational%20lens">gravitational lens</a>ing effect of a foreground galaxy through which its light passes. It appears to be a giant <a href="elliptical%20galaxy">elliptical galaxy</a> with a <a href="supermassive%20black%20hole">supermassive black hole</a> around 23 billion times as massive as the Sun and an associated <a href="accretion%20disk">accretion disk</a> that has a diameter of 3600 light years. The galaxy possesses large regions of hot dust and molecular gas, as well as regions with <a href="starburst%20region">starburst</a> activity. It has a cosmological <a href="redshift">redshift</a> of 3.911. While observing the quasar in 2008, astronomers using ESA's <a href="XMM%20Newton">XMM Newton</a> and the <a href="Large%20Binocular%20Telescope">Large Binocular Telescope</a> (LBT) in Arizona discovered the huge galaxy cluster <a href="2XMM%20J083026%2B524133">2XMM J083026+524133</a>.

The <a href="Lynx%20Supercluster">Lynx Supercluster</a> is a remote <a href="supercluster">supercluster</a> with a redshift of 1.26–1.27. It was the most distant supercluster known at the time of its discovery in 1999. It is made up of two main clusters of galaxies—RX J0849+4452 or Lynx E and RX J0848+4453 or Lynx W—and several smaller clumps. Further still lies the <a href="Lynx%20Arc">Lynx Arc</a>, located around 12 billion light years away (a redshift of 3.357). It is a distant region containing a million extremely hot, young blue stars with surface temperatures of 80,000–100,000 K that are twice as hot as similar stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Only visible through gravitational lensing produced by a closer cluster of galaxies, the Arc is a feature of the early days of the universe, when "furious firestorms of star birth" were more common.

The <a href="September%20Lyncids">September Lyncids</a> are a minor <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a> that appears around 6 September. They were historically more prominent, described as such by <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">Chinese observers</a> in 1037 and 1063, and Korean astronomers in 1560. The <a href="Alpha%20Lyncids">Alpha Lyncids</a> were discovered in 1971 by Malcolm Currie, and appear between 10 December and 3 January.

Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)

Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) is the debut <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> group <a href="Wu-Tang%20Clan">Wu-Tang Clan</a>, released on November 9, 1993 by <a href="Loud%20Records">Loud Records</a>. Recording sessions took place during 1992 and 1993 at Firehouse Studio in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, and the album was produced by the group's <a href="de%20facto">de facto</a> leader <a href="RZA">RZA</a>. Its title originates from the martial arts film "<a href="The%2036th%20Chamber%20of%20Shaolin">The 36th Chamber of Shaolin</a>" (1978).

The distinctive sound of "Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)" created a blueprint for <a href="hardcore%20hip%20hop">hardcore hip hop</a> during the 1990s, and helped return New York City hip hop to national prominence. Its sound also became greatly influential in modern hip hop production, while the group members' explicit, humorous, and <a href="Free%20association%20%28psychology%29">free-associative</a> lyrics have served as a template for many subsequent hip hop records. Serving as a landmark release in the era of hip hop known as the <a href="East%20Coast%20hip%20hop">East Coast Renaissance</a>, its influence helped lead the way for several other East Coast hip hop artists, including <a href="Nas">Nas</a>, <a href="The%20Notorious%20B.I.G.">The Notorious B.I.G.</a>, <a href="Mobb%20Deep">Mobb Deep</a>, and <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a>.

Despite its raw, underground sound, the album had surprising chart success, peaking at #41 on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart, selling 30,000 copies in its first week on sale. By 1995, it was certified <a href="platinum%20album">Platinum</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> and has sold over 2 million copies in the United States. Initially receiving positive reviews from most music critics, "Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)" is widely regarded as one of the most significant albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the greatest hip hop albums ever.

In the late 1980s, cousins <a href="RZA">Robert Diggs</a>, <a href="GZA">Gary Grice</a>, and <a href="Ol%27%20Dirty%20Bastard">Russell Jones</a> formed a group named Force of the Imperial Master, also known as the <a href="All%20in%20Together%20Now%20Crew">All in Together Now Crew</a>. Each member recorded under an alias: Grice as The Genius, Diggs as Prince Rakeem or The Scientist, and Jones as The Specialist. The group never signed to a major label, but caught the attention of the New York rap scene and was recognized by rapper <a href="Biz%20Markie">Biz Markie</a>. By 1991, The Genius and Prince Rakeem were signed to separate record labels. The Genius released "<a href="Words%20from%20the%20Genius">Words from the Genius</a>" (1991) on <a href="Cold%20Chillin%27%20Records">Cold Chillin' Records</a> and Prince Rakeem released "<a href="Ooh%20I%20Love%20You%20Rakeem">Ooh I Love You Rakeem</a>" (1991) on <a href="Tommy%20Boy%20Records">Tommy Boy Records</a>. Both were soon dropped by their labels. Embittered but unbowed, they took on new monikers (The Genius became <a href="GZA">GZA</a> while Prince Rakeem became <a href="RZA">RZA</a>) and refocused their efforts. RZA discussed the matter in their release "<a href="The%20Wu-Tang%20Manual">The Wu-Tang Manual</a>" (2005), stating "[Tommy Boy] made the decision to sign <a href="House%20of%20Pain">House of Pain</a> over us. When they dropped me, I was thinking, 'Damn, they chose a bunch of whiteboy shit over me.'"

RZA began collaborating with Dennis Coles, later known as <a href="Ghostface%20Killah">Ghostface Killah</a>, another rapper from the <a href="Stapleton%20Projects">Stapleton Projects</a> apartment complex in <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a>. The duo decided to create a hip hop group whose ethos would be a blend of "<a href="Eastern%20philosophy">Eastern philosophy</a> picked up from <a href="kung%20fu%20movies">kung fu movies</a>, watered-down <a href="Nation%20of%20Islam%20%28religious%20movement%29">Nation of Islam</a> preaching picked up on the New York streets, and comic books."

"Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)" was recorded at Firehouse Studio in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> from 1992 to 1993. The album was produced, mixed, arranged, and programmed by RZA, and was <a href="Master%20recording">mastered</a> at <a href="The%20Hit%20Factory">The Hit Factory</a> in New York City by Chris Gehringer. Because of an extremely limited budget, the group was only able to record in a small, inexpensive studio; with up to eight of the nine Wu-Tang members in the studio at once, the quarters were frequently crowded. To decide who appeared on each song, RZA forced the Wu-Tang rappers to <a href="Freestyle%20battle">battle</a> with each other. This competition led to the track "Meth Vs. Chef", a battle between <a href="Method%20Man">Method Man</a> and <a href="Raekwon">Raekwon</a> over the rights to rap over RZA's beat; this track was left off the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album but surfaced on Method Man's debut, "<a href="Tical%20%28album%29">Tical</a>" (1994).

Group leader RZA produced "Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)" by creating sonic collages from classic soul <a href="music%20sampling">samples</a> and clips from <a href="martial%20arts">martial arts</a> movies such as "<a href="Shaolin%20and%20Wu%20Tang">Shaolin and Wu Tang</a>" (1981). He complemented the rappers' performances with "lean, menacing beats that evoked their gritty, urban surroundings more effectively than their words," according to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic. The use of soul samples and various esoteric clips, and the technique by which RZA employed them in his beats was unique and largely unprecedented in hip-hop. The gritty sound of "Enter the Wu-Tang" is due, at least in part, to the use of cheap equipment to produce the album.

According to music journalist Ben Yew, the minimalist means of production plays directly into the music's "street" aesthetic. "Because [RZA] didn't have the best mixing or recording equipment, the album is wrought with a 'dirty' quality—the drums have more bass and are more hard-hitting than they are crisp and clean; the samples have an eerie, almost haunting type of echo; and the vocals, because each member's voice is already aggressive and gritty, perfectly match the production." Although <a href="Ol%27%20Dirty%20Bastard">Ol' Dirty Bastard</a> is given co-production credit on "Da Mystery of Chessboxin'" and Method Man is co-credited for "Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta F' Wit," critics and admirers universally credit RZA with developing what "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" called a "dusty yet digital production style [that] helped legitimize the use of more diverse sample sources to the hardcore New York rap massive, breaking away from <a href="James%20Brown">James Brown</a> based beats and embracing a style that turned the "<a href="Underdog%20%28TV%20series%29">Underdog</a>" theme into the menacing coda for a group of underground terrorists."

"Enter the Wu-Tang" ushered in a new standard for hip-hop at a time when hip hop music was dominated by the <a href="jazz%20rap">jazz-influenced</a> styles of <a href="A%20Tribe%20Called%20Quest">A Tribe Called Quest</a>, the <a href="Afrocentrism">Afrocentric</a> viewpoints of <a href="Public%20Enemy%20%28band%29">Public Enemy</a>, and the rising popularity of <a href="West%20Coast%20hip%20hop">West Coast</a> <a href="gangsta%20rap">gangsta rap</a>. The album's explicit, humorous and <a href="Free%20association%20%28psychology%29">free-associative</a> lyrics have been credited for serving as a template for many subsequent hip hop records. "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" described the album as possessing an aesthetic that was "low on hype and production values [and] high on the idea that indigence is a central part of blackness." While the lyrical content on "Enter the Wu-Tang" generally varies from rapper to rapper, the basic themes are the same—urban life, martial arts movies, comic book references, and <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">marijuana</a>—and the setting is invariably the harsh environment of New York City. The lyrics have a universally dark tone and seem at times to be simply aggressive cries. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> contributor Steve Huey praises the lyricists for their originality and <a href="caustic%20humour">caustic humor</a>, stating "Some were outsized, theatrical personalities, others were cerebral storytellers and lyrical technicians, but each had his own distinctive style ... Every track on "Enter the Wu-Tang" is packed with fresh, inventive rhymes, which are filled with martial arts metaphors, pop culture references (everything from Voltron to Lucky Charms cereal commercials to Barbra Streisand's "The Way We Were"), bizarre threats of violence, and a truly twisted sense of humor."

With the exception of "Method Man" and GZA's "Clan in da Front", every song features multiple rappers contributing verses of varying lengths. The verses are essentially battle rhymes, mixed with humor and outsized tales of urban violence and drug use. There is some debate about whether the lyrics on "36 Chambers" are properly classified as gangsta rap or something else entirely. In a <a href="Stylus%20Magazine">"Stylus" magazine</a> review, writer Gavin Mueller evokes the bleakness of the Wu-Tang <a href="world%20view">world view</a>:

All nine original Wu-Tang Clan members contribute vocals on "Enter the Wu-Tang". <a href="Masta%20Killa">Masta Killa</a> only appears on one track, contributing the last verse of "Da Mystery of Chessboxin,'" but all the other rappers appear on at least two songs. Method Man and Raekwon are the most prolific of the group, featured on eight tracks. Though the performers have widely differing techniques, the chemistry between them is a key ingredient of the album's success. <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a> asserts that "Half the charm is in the cast's idiosyncrasies: ODB's hovering sing-song, Raekwon's fake stutter, Ghostface's verbal tics, Method Man's hazy, dusted voice."

Part of the album's title originates from the <a href="The%20Nation%20of%20Gods%20and%20Earths">Five Percent</a> philosophy, known to adherents as the Supreme Mathematics, which attaches the number 9 with the meaning "to bring into existence". Because the Wu-Tang Clan was made of nine members, each of whom has four chambers of the heart, the album was subtitled "36 Chambers", being the total of the nine hearts of the members.

In reference to the 1978 <a href="kung%20fu">kung fu</a> film "<a href="The%2036th%20Chamber%20of%20Shaolin">The 36th Chamber of Shaolin</a>" that the group enjoyed watching, the Clan considered themselves as lyrical masters of the 36 chambers, and arrived onto the rap scene while appearing to be ahead, and more advanced over others, with "knowledge of 36 chambers of hip hop music when everyone else in hip hop was striving to attain the knowledge of 35 lessons." Also, while the human body has 108 <a href="pressure%20point">pressure point</a>s (1 + 0 + 8 = 9), only the Wu-Tang martial artists learned and understood that 36 of those pressure points are deadly (9 + 36 = 45) (4 + 5 = 9) The lyrics and rhymes of the 9 members are to be considered as 36 deadly lyrical techniques for pressure points. All of this is the basis for the album title, "Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)", being that 9 members x 4 chambers = 36. However, this is just a theory; the true significance of the title is not definitively known.

"<a href="Protect%20Ya%20Neck">Protect Ya Neck</a>" and "Tearz" were the first tracks recorded by the Wu-Tang Clan. "Protect Ya Neck" is a free-associative and braggadocious <a href="battle%20rap">battle rap</a> featuring eight of the nine Wu-Tang members. The track was also edited to scratch out all profanity, save for repeated use of the word "nigga". An uncensored version known as the "Bloody Version" was released on the 2004 compilation album "<a href="Legend%20of%20the%20Wu-Tang%20Clan">Legend of the Wu-Tang Clan</a>". "Tearz" tells stories of a little kid getting shot (RZA's little brother), and another one who contracts <a href="HIV">HIV</a> after having unprotected sex. They were independently released as the "Protect Ya Neck"/"After the Laughter Comes Tears" single, which <a href="RZA">RZA</a> financed by demanding $100 (<a href="USD">USD</a>) from each rapper who wanted a verse on the <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">A-side</a>. The single was re-released in a much larger pressing, with "<a href="Method%20Man%20%28song%29">Method Man</a>" as the <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">B-side</a>.

"Method Man" reached number 69 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> and number 17 on the "Billboard" <a href="Hot%20Rap%20Tracks">Hot Rap Tracks</a> chart. "Method Man" gained significant airplay partly for its catchy refrain, which copies the refrain of <a href="Hall%20%26amp%3B%20Oates">Hall & Oates</a>' "<a href="Method%20of%20Modern%20Love">Method of Modern Love</a>" ("The M-E-T-H-O-D ... Man").

"<a href="C.R.E.A.M.">C.R.E.A.M.</a>", featuring Raekwon and <a href="Inspectah%20Deck">Inspectah Deck</a>, was the second single from the album and the first new A-side to be released after the group signed with Loud/RCA. Its lyrics deal with the struggle of poverty and the desire to earn money by any means. It was the Wu-Tang Clan's most successful single, reaching number 60 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> and number 8 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. The single topped the <a href="Hot%20Dance%20Music/Maxi-Singles%20Sales">Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales</a> chart. "Can It Be All So Simple", featuring Ghostface Killah and Raekwon, was the album's third single. The single failed to chart on the "Billboard" Hot 100 but reached number 24 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart in 1994. A <a href="remix">remix</a> of the song was included on Raekwon's debut solo album "<a href="Only%20Built%204%20Cuban%20Linx...">Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...</a>" (1995).

The group made music videos for the three A-sides and for "Method Man", "Da Mystery of Chessboxin'", and "Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit". As the group's profile increased, the quality of their videos improved; though the "Protect Ya Neck" video resembled a home movie, later videos were directed by rising hip-hop music video director <a href="Hype%20Williams">Hype Williams</a>. The videos received almost no airplay on <a href="MTV">MTV</a> but were extremely popular on video-by-request channels such as <a href="The%20Box%20%28US%20TV%20channel%29">The Box</a>. <a href="Tour%C3%A9%20%28journalist%29">Touré</a> wrote in his 1993 "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" review that "in Brooklyn, N.Y., right now and extending back a few months, the reigning fave is the Wu-Tang Clan, who are to the channel what <a href="Guns%20N%27%20Roses">Guns N' Roses</a> are to MTV."

"Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)" was received positively by contemporary critics. In an article for "<a href="The%20Source%20%28magazine%29">The Source</a>", The Ghetto Communicator wrote "This record is harsh, but so is the world that we live in. For B-boys n'girls who come from the core of the hard, this is the hip-hop album you've been waiting for". "Entertainment Weekly" said, "With its rumble jumble of drumbeats, peppered with occasional piano plunking, "Enter" has a raw, pass-the-mike flavor we haven't heard since rap was pop's best-kept secret." <a href="Tour%C3%A9%20%28journalist%29">Touré</a> was less enthusiastic in "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", praising the album's sound, but noting that "Wu-Tang ... are more ciphers than masterful creations. In refusing to commodify themselves, they leave blank the ultimate canvas—the self." He added, "This is hip-hop you won't find creeping up the "Billboard" charts but you will hear booming out of Jeep stereos in all the right neighborhoods." However, "Enter the Wu-Tang" had surprising chart success, despite its raw, underground sound. It peaked at number 41 on the "Billboard" 200 chart and reached number eight on "Billboard"s <a href="Top%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip%20Hop%20Albums">Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums</a> chart. The album continued to sell steadily and was eventually certified <a href="platinum%20album">platinum</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> on May 15, 1995.

Over time, "Enter the Wu-Tang" became one of the most highly regarded albums in hip hop. The album was originally given a rating of 4.5 mics out of 5 in "The Source" magazine in 1994; however, it was given a classic 5 mic rating in a later issue of the magazine. Similar to "The Source", "<a href="XXL%20%28magazine%29">XXL</a>" magazine gave the album a classic rating of "XXL" in its retrospective 2007 issue. In the book "<a href="Spin%20Alternative%20Record%20Guide">Spin Alternative Record Guide</a>" (1995), "Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)" has a critical rating of 8/10 from "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>". In 2003, "Rolling Stone" named the album among the "<a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>", asserting that "East-coast hip-hop made a return in 1993." The magazine later listed it as one of the "Essential Albums of the 90s" and "100 Best Debut Albums of All Time." "The Source" cited "Enter the Wu-Tang" as one of the "100 Best Rap Albums", while also naming "Protect Ya Neck/Method Man" and "C.R.E.A.M." among the "100 Best Rap Singles". MTV declared it among "The Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of All Time", while "Blender" named the album among the "500 CDs You Must Own". Oliver Wang, author of "Classic Material: The Hip-Hop Album Guide" described it "as timeless an album as hip-hop has ever seen."

Publications based outside of the United States have acclaimed "36 Chambers" as well; Australia's "Juice" magazine placed it at number 40 on its list of "100 Greatest Albums of the '90s", and "<a href="Les%20Inrockuptibles">Les Inrockuptibles</a>" ranked it number 59 on a list of "The 100 Best Albums 1986–1996". In naming "Enter the Wu-Tang" one of the 50 best albums of the 1990s, <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a> staff member <a href="Rollie%20Pemberton">Rollie Pemberton</a> summed up the album's critical recognition by writing:

In a retrospective review, <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> found the Wu-Tang Clan "grander" and "goofier" than their West Coast contemporaries and concluded, "Expect the masterwork this album's reputation suggests and you'll probably be disappointed—it will speak directly only to indigenous hip hoppers. Expect a glorious human mess, as opposed to the ominous platinum product of their opposite numbers, and you'll realize the dope game isn't everyone's dead-end street". In 2010, "Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)" was included in the book "<a href="1001%20Albums%20You%20Must%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</a>".

"Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)" is one of the most influential albums in <a href="History%20of%20hip%20hop%20music">hip hop history</a>. Adam Heimlich of the "<a href="New%20York%20Press">New York Press</a>" considers the album a touchstone of <a href="hardcore%20hip-hop">hardcore hip-hop</a>, a gritty, stripped-down, dark and violent subgenre of hip hop and the signature sound of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>'s rap scene during the mid-1990s. He writes that "the Wu-Tang Clan ... all but invented 90s New York rap, back when the notion of an East Coast gangsta still meant <a href="Schoolly%20D">Schoolly D</a> or <a href="Kool%20G.%20Rap">Kool G. Rap</a> ... [They] designed the manner and style in which New York artists would address what <a href="Snoop%20Dogg">Snoop</a> and <a href="Dr.%20Dre">Dre</a> had made rap's hottest topics: drugs and violence." As the album helped return New York City hip hop to national prominence, a new generation of New York rappers, many of them inspired by the Wu-Tang Clan's example, released a flurry of classic albums that later became known as the <a href="East%20Coast%20Renaissance">East Coast Renaissance</a>. "Enter the Wu-Tang" has been recognized by critics as a landmark album in the movement. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> indicates that the success of the album paved the way for <a href="Nas">Nas</a>, <a href="The%20Notorious%20B.I.G.">The Notorious B.I.G.</a> <a href="Mobb%20Deep">Mobb Deep</a>, and <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a>.

At the time of the album's release, mainstream hip hop was dominated by <a href="West%20Coast%20hip%20hop">West Coast hip hop</a>. "Enter the Wu-Tang" (along with the critically acclaimed "Illmatic" and the commercial success of "Ready to Die") was able to shift the emphasis away from the melodious, <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>-driven <a href="G-funk">G-funk</a> and restore interest into the East Coast hip hop scene. According to one columnist, "When "Enter the Wu-Tang: The 36 Chambers" first graced the pages of rap lore in 1993, <a href="Dr.%20Dre">Dr. Dre</a>'s funk-filled, West Coast gangster rap dominated the business. Though this initial dominance was difficult to overcome, Wu-Tang still managed to carve out a piece of rap history."

<a href="RZA">RZA</a>'s production on Wu-Tang Clan's debut album had a profound and significant influence on subsequent hip hop producers. The distinctive sound of "Enter the Wu-Tang" has been credited with creating a blueprint for hardcore hip hop in the mid-1990s. Blackfilm.com asserts that "Enter the Wu-Tang"'s production formula "transformed the sound of underground rap into mainstream formula, and virtually changed the face of contemporary music as popsters once knew it." Many successful rap producers have admitted to the influence of RZA's beats on their own production efforts. <a href="9th%20Wonder">9th Wonder</a>, a producer and former member of <a href="Little%20Brother%20%28band%29">Little Brother</a>, is one of many whose vocal sampling styles are inspired by RZA. The album's reliance on soul music samples was novel at the time, but 21st-century producers such as <a href="The%20Alchemist%20%28musician%29">The Alchemist</a>, <a href="Kanye%20West">Kanye West</a>, and <a href="Just%20Blaze">Just Blaze</a> now rely on this technique. According to Allmusic, the production on two <a href="Mobb%20Deep">Mobb Deep</a> albums, "<a href="The%20Infamous">The Infamous</a>" and "<a href="Hell%20on%20Earth%20%28Mobb%20Deep%20album%29">Hell on Earth</a>" (1996), are "indebted" to RZA's early production with Wu-Tang Clan.

Following "Enter the Wu-Tang"s success, the individual members of the group negotiated and signed solo contracts with a variety of different labels: Method Man signed with <a href="Def%20Jam">Def Jam</a>, Ol' Dirty Bastard with <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra</a>, GZA with <a href="Geffen%20Records">Geffen Records</a>, and Ghostface Killah with <a href="Epic%20Records">Epic Records</a>. This expansion across the music industry was an element of RZA's stated plan for industry-wide domination, wherein "All Wu releases are deemed to be 50 percent partnerships with Wu-Tang Productions and each Wu member with solo deal must contribute 20 percent of their earnings back to Wu-Tang Productions, a fund for all Wu members."

On "Enter the Wu-Tang"s effect on the group and the music industry, the "<a href="Milwaukee%20Journal">Milwaukee Journal</a>"s Aaron Justin-Szopinski wrote "The Wu showed us that a hip-hop group can control its own destiny in the tangled web of the industry. It owns publishing rights, controls its samples and has 90% influence over its career. And that control, that outlook for the future, is what makes it the best." Wu-Tang Clan have produced four subsequent group albums since "Enter the Wu-Tang", including "<a href="Wu-Tang%20Forever">Wu-Tang Forever</a>" (1997), which is certified as a quadruple platinum record. None of the subsequent Wu-Tang Clan albums have garnered the critical accolades that their debut was accorded.

In 2013, the group reunited, at the behest of RZA, for an album and tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of the albums release. The album was titled "A Better Tomorrow" and the tour included dates throughout the United States, Europe, and Russia. All original members of the group who performed on "Enter the Wu-Tang" participated in both the tour and reunion album, excepting Ol' Dirty Bastard, who died in 2004.
