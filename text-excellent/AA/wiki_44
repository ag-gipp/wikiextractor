Lemur

Lemurs ( ) (from Latin "lemures" – ghosts or spirits) are <a href="mammalian">mammalian</a> <a href="animals">animals</a> of the <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a> <a href="primates">primates</a>, divided into 8 <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">families</a> and consisting of 15 <a href="genera">genera</a> and around 100 existing <a href="species">species</a>. They are native only to the island of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. Most existing lemurs are small, have a pointed snout, large eyes, and a long tail. They chiefly live in trees (<a href="arboreal">arboreal</a>), and are active at night (<a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a>). 

Lemurs share resemblance with other primates, but evolved independently from <a href="monkey">monkey</a>s and <a href="ape">ape</a>s. Due to Madagascar's highly seasonal climate, <a href="Evolution%20of%20lemurs">lemur evolution</a> has produced a level of <a href="species%20diversity">species diversity</a> rivaling that of any other primate group. Until shortly after humans arrived on the island around 2,000 years ago, there were lemurs as large as a male <a href="gorilla">gorilla</a>. Most species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic classification</a> is controversial and depends on which <a href="Species%20problem">species concept</a> is used. 

Lemurs range in weight from the <a href="mouse%20lemur">mouse lemur</a> to the <a href="indri">indri</a>. Lemurs share many common basal primate traits, such as divergent <a href="digit%20%28anatomy%29">digits</a> on their hands and feet, and <a href="nail%20%28anatomy%29">nails</a> instead of <a href="claw">claw</a>s (in most species). However, their <a href="Brain-to-body%20mass%20ratio">brain-to-body size ratio</a> is smaller than that of <a href="Anthropoidea">anthropoid</a> primates. As with all <a href="strepsirrhine">strepsirrhine</a> primates, they have a "wet nose" (<a href="rhinarium">rhinarium</a>). Lemurs are generally the most social of the strepsirrhine primates, and communicate more with scents and vocalizations than with visual signals. Lemurs have a relatively low <a href="basal%20metabolic%20rate">basal metabolic rate</a>, and as a result may exhibit <a href="dormancy">dormancy</a> such as <a href="hibernation">hibernation</a> or <a href="torpor">torpor</a>. They also have <a href="seasonal%20breeder">seasonal breeding</a> and <a href="dominance%20%28ethology%29">female social dominance</a>. Most eat a wide variety of fruits and leaves, while some are specialists. Two species of lemurs may coexist the same forest due to different diets. 

Lemur research during the 18th and 19th centuries focused on taxonomy and specimen collection. Modern studies of lemur ecology and behavior did not begin in earnest until the 1950s and 1960s. Initially hindered by political issues on Madagascar during the mid-1970s, field studies resumed in the 1980s. Lemurs are important for research because their mix of ancestral characteristics and traits shared with anthropoid primates can yield insights on primate and <a href="human%20evolution">human evolution</a>. 

Many lemur species are threatened with extinction due to habitat loss and hunting. Although local traditions generally help protect lemurs and their forests, <a href="Illegal%20logging%20in%20Madagascar">illegal logging</a>, widespread poverty, and political instability hinder and undermine conservation efforts. Because of these threats and their declining numbers, the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) considers lemurs to be the world's most endangered mammals, noting that up to 90% of all lemur species face extinction within the next 20 to 25 years.

The name lemur is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "<a href="lemures">lemures</a>", which refers to specters or ghosts that were <a href="exorcism">exorcised</a> during the <a href="Lemuria%20%28festival%29">Lemuria festival</a> of ancient Rome.

<a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>, the founder of modern <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial nomenclature</a>, gave lemurs their name as early as 1758, when he used it in the <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">10th edition of "Systema Naturae"</a>. He included three species under the genus "Lemur": "Lemur tardigradus" (the <a href="red%20slender%20loris">red slender loris</a>, now known as "Loris tardigradus"), "Lemur catta" (the <a href="ring-tailed%20lemur">ring-tailed lemur</a>), and "Lemur volans" (the <a href="Philippine%20flying%20lemur">Philippine colugo</a>, now known as "Cynocephalus volans").
Although the term "lemur" was first intended for <a href="slender%20loris">slender loris</a>es, it was soon limited to the <a href="endemic">endemic</a> Malagasy primates, which have been known as "lemurs" ever since. According to Linnaeus' own explanation, the name was selected because of the nocturnal activity and slow movements of the slender loris. Being familiar with the works of <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a> and <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a> and seeing an analogy that fit with his naming scheme, Linnaeus adapted the term "lemur" for these nocturnal primates. 

It was noted in 2012 that it has been commonly and falsely assumed that Linnaeus was referring to the ghost-like appearance, <a href="Tapetum%20lucidum">reflective eyes</a>, and ghostly cries of lemurs. It has also been speculated that Linnaeus may also have known that some Malagasy people have held legends that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors, but this is unlikely given that the name was selected for slender lorises from India.

Lemurs are primates belonging to the suborder <a href="Strepsirrhini">Strepsirrhini</a>. Like other strepsirrhine <a href="primate">primate</a>s, such as <a href="loris">loris</a>es, <a href="potto">potto</a>s, and <a href="galago">galago</a>s, they share ancestral (or <a href="Cladistics%23plesiomorphy">plesiomorphic</a>) traits with early primates. In this regard, lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes (<a href="simian">simian</a>s). Instead, they evolved independently in isolation on <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. All modern strepsirrhines including lemurs are traditionally thought to have evolved from early primates known as <a href="adapiformes">adapiforms</a> during the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> (56 to 34 <a href="Year%23Symbols%20y%20and%20yr">mya</a>) or <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> (66 to 56 mya). Adapiforms, however, lack a specialized arrangement of teeth, known as a <a href="toothcomb">toothcomb</a>, which nearly all living strepsirrhines possess. A more recent <a href="hypothesis">hypothesis</a> is that lemurs descended from lorisoids (loris-like) primates. This is supported by comparative studies of the <a href="cytochrome%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bb">cytochrome b</a> gene and the presence of the strepsirrhine toothcomb in both groups. Instead of being the direct ancestors of lemurs, the adapiforms may have given rise to both the lemurs and lorisoids, a split that would be supported by <a href="molecular%20phylogenetic">molecular phylogenetic</a> studies. The later split between lemurs and lorises is thought to have occurred approximately 62 to 65 mya according to molecular studies, although other genetic tests and the fossil record in Africa suggest more conservative estimates of 50 to 55 mya for this divergence. However, the oldest lemur fossils on Madagascar are actually <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a>s dating to the <a href="Late%20Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a>.

Once part of the supercontinent <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>, the island of Madagascar has been isolated since it broke away from eastern <a href="Africa">Africa</a> (~160 mya), <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> (~80–130 mya), and <a href="Indian%20Plate">India</a> (~80–90 mya). Since ancestral lemurs are thought to have originated in Africa around 62 to 65 mya, they must have crossed the <a href="Mozambique%20Channel">Mozambique Channel</a>, a deep channel between Africa and Madagascar with a minimum width of about 560 km (350 mi). In 1915, <a href="paleontologist">paleontologist</a> <a href="William%20Diller%20Matthew">William Diller Matthew</a> noted that the mammalian biodiversity on Madagascar (including lemurs) can only be accounted for by random <a href="rafting%20event">rafting event</a>s, where very small populations rafted from nearby Africa on tangled mats of vegetation, which get flushed out to sea from major rivers. This form of <a href="biological%20dispersal">biological dispersal</a> can occur randomly over millions of years. In the 1940s, American paleontologist <a href="George%20Gaylord%20Simpson">George Gaylord Simpson</a> coined the term "sweepstakes hypothesis" for such random events. Rafting has since been the most accepted explanation for the lemur colonization of Madagascar, but until recently this trip was thought to be very unlikely because strong <a href="ocean%20current">ocean current</a>s flow away from the island. In , a report demonstrated that around 60 mya both Madagascar and Africa were 1,650 km (1,030 mi) south of their present-day positions, placing them in a different <a href="ocean%20gyre">ocean gyre</a>, producing currents that ran counter to what they are today. The ocean currents were shown to be even stronger than today, which would have pushed a raft along faster, shortening the trip to 30 days or less—short enough for a small mammal to survive easily. As the <a href="plate%20tectonics">continental plates</a> drifted northward, the currents gradually changed, and by 20 mya the window for oceanic dispersal had closed, effectively isolating the lemurs and the rest of the terrestrial Malagasy fauna from mainland Africa. Isolated on Madagascar with only a limited number of mammalian competitors, the lemurs did not have to compete with other evolving <a href="arboreal%20locomotion">arboreal</a> mammalian groups, such as <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s. They were also spared from having to compete with <a href="monkey">monkey</a>s, which evolved later. The intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness of monkeys gave them an advantage over other primates in exploiting the environment.

Lemurs have <a href="Adaptation">adapted</a> to fill many open <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>s since making their way to Madagascar. Their diversity in both behavior and morphology (outward appearance) rivals that of the monkeys and apes found elsewhere in the world. Ranging in size from the 30 g (1.1 oz) <a href="Madame%20Berthe%27s%20mouse%20lemur">Madame Berthe's mouse lemur</a>, the world's smallest primate, to the recently extinct 160–200 kg (350–440 lb) "<a href="Archaeoindris%20fontoynonti">Archaeoindris fontoynonti</a>", lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying levels of social complexity, and unique adaptations to the local climate.

Lemurs lack any shared traits that make them stand out from all other primates. Different types of lemurs have evolved unique combinations of unusual traits to cope with Madagascar's harsh, seasonal climate. These traits can include seasonal fat storage, hypometabolism (including <a href="torpor">torpor</a> and <a href="hibernation">hibernation</a>), small group sizes, low <a href="encephalization">encephalization</a> (relative brain size), <a href="cathemeral">cathemeral</a>ity (activity both day and night), and strict <a href="seasonal%20breeder">breeding seasons</a>. Extreme resource limitations and seasonal breeding are also thought to have given rise to three other relatively common lemur traits: <a href="dominance%20%28ethology%29">female social dominance</a>, sexual monomorphism, and male–male competition for mates involving low levels of <a href="Agonistic%20behaviour">agonism</a>, such as <a href="sperm%20competition">sperm competition</a>.

Before the arrival of humans roughly 1500 to 2000 years ago, lemurs were found all across the island. However, early settlers quickly converted the forests to <a href="paddy%20field">rice paddies</a> and <a href="grassland">grassland</a> through <a href="slash%20and%20burn">slash-and-burn agriculture</a> (known locally as "tavy"), restricting lemurs to approximately 10% of the island's area, ~60,000 km (23,000 sq mi). Today, the diversity and complexity of lemur communities increases with <a href="flora">flora</a>l diversity and <a href="precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a> and is highest in the <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>s of the east coast, where precipitation and floral diversity are also at their highest. Despite their adaptations for weathering extreme adversity, habitat destruction and hunting have resulted in lemur populations declining sharply, and their diversity has diminished, with the recent extinction of at least 17 species in eight genera, known collectively as the <a href="subfossil%20lemur">subfossil lemur</a>s. Most of the approximately 100 species and subspecies of lemur are either threatened or endangered. Unless trends change, extinctions are likely to continue.

Until recently, giant lemurs existed on Madagascar. Now represented only by recent or subfossil remains, they were modern forms that were once part of the rich lemur diversity that has evolved in isolation. Some of their adaptations were unlike those seen in their living relatives. All 17 extinct lemurs were larger than the extant (living) forms, some weighing as much as 200 kg (440 lb), and are thought to have been active during the day. Not only were they unlike the living lemurs in both size and appearance, they also filled ecological niches that either no longer exist or are now left unoccupied. Large parts of Madagascar, which are now devoid of forests and lemurs, once hosted diverse primate communities that included more than 20 lemur species covering the full range of lemur sizes.

From a taxonomic standpoint, the term "lemur" originally referred to the genus "Lemur", which currently contains only the <a href="ring-tailed%20lemur">ring-tailed lemur</a>. The term is now used in the <a href="colloquialism">colloquial</a> sense in reference to all Malagasy primates.

Lemur taxonomy is controversial, and not all experts agree, particularly with the recent increase in the number of recognized species. According to <a href="Russell%20Mittermeier">Russell Mittermeier</a>, the president of <a href="Conservation%20International">Conservation International</a> (CI), taxonomist <a href="Colin%20Groves">Colin Groves</a>, and others, there are nearly 100 recognized species or subspecies of extant (or living) lemur, divided into five families and 15 genera. Because genetic data indicates that the recently extinct subfossil lemurs were closely related to living lemurs, an additional three families, eight genera, and 17 species can be included in the total. In contrast, other experts have labeled this as <a href="taxonomic%20inflation">taxonomic inflation</a>, instead preferring a total closer to 50 species.

The classification of lemurs within the suborder Strepsirrhini is equally controversial, although most experts agree on the same <a href="phylogenetic%20tree">phylogenetic tree</a>. In one taxonomy, the infraorder Lemuriformes contains all living strepsirrhines in two superfamilies, Lemuroidea for all lemurs and Lorisoidea for the lorisoids (<a href="Lorisidae">lorisids</a> and galagos). Alternatively, the lorisoids are sometimes placed in their own infraorder, Lorisiformes, separate from the lemurs. In another taxonomy published by Colin Groves, the <a href="aye-aye">aye-aye</a> was placed in its own infraorder, Chiromyiformes, while the rest of the lemurs were placed in Lemuriformes and the lorisoids in Lorisiformes.

Although it is generally agreed that the aye-aye is the most basal member of the lemur clade, the relationship between the other four families is less clear since they diverged during a narrow 10 to 12 million-year window between the Late Eocene (42 mya) and into the Oligocene (30 mya). The two main competing hypotheses are shown in the adjacent image.

Lemur taxonomy has changed significantly since the first taxonomic classification of lemurs by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. One of the greatest challenges has been the classification of the aye-aye, which has been a topic of debate up until very recently. Until <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a> published a definitive anatomical study in 1866, early naturalists were uncertain whether the aye-aye (genus "Daubentonia") was a <a href="primate">primate</a>, <a href="rodent">rodent</a>, or <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a>. However, the placement of the aye-aye within the order Primates remained problematic until very recently. Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus "Daubentonia" as a specialized <a href="indriidae">indriid</a>, a <a href="Cladistics">sister group</a> to all strepsirrhines, and as an indeterminate taxon within the order Primates. Molecular tests have now shown Daubentoniidae is basal to all Lemuriformes, and in 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others ignored addressing higher-level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families, including Daubentoniidae.

Relationships among lemur families have also proven to be problematic and have yet to be definitively resolved. To further complicate the issue, several <a href="Paleogene">Paleogene</a> fossil primates from outside Madagascar, such as "<a href="Bugtilemur">Bugtilemur</a>", have been classified as lemurs. However, scientific consensus does not accept these assignments based on genetic evidence, and therefore it is generally accepted that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic. Another area of contention is the relationship between the sportive lemurs and the extinct <a href="koala%20lemur">koala lemur</a>s (Megaladapidae). Formerly grouped in the same family due to similarities in dentition, they are no longer considered to be closely related due to genetic studies.

More taxonomic changes have occurred at the genus level, although these revisions have proven more conclusive, often supported by genetic and molecular analysis. The most noticeable revisions included the gradual split of a broadly defined genus "Lemur" into separate genera for the <a href="ring-tailed%20lemur">ring-tailed lemur</a>, <a href="ruffed%20lemur">ruffed lemur</a>s, and <a href="True%20lemur">brown lemurs</a> due to a host of morphological differences.

Due to several taxonomic revisions by Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others, the number of recognized lemur species has grown from 33 species and subspecies in 1994 to approximately 100 in 2008. With continuing <a href="cytogenetics">cytogenetic</a> and <a href="molecular%20genetics">molecular genetic</a> research, as well as ongoing <a href="field%20study">field studies</a>, particularly with <a href="cryptic%20species">cryptic species</a> such as mouse lemurs, the number of recognized lemur species is likely to keep growing. However, the rapid increase in the number of recognized species has had its critics among taxonomists and lemur researchers. Since classifications ultimately depend on the <a href="Species%23Definitions%20of%20species">species concept</a> used, <a href="conservation%20movement">conservationists</a> often favor definitions that result in the splitting of genetically distinct populations into separate species to gain added environmental protection. Others favor a more thorough analysis.

Lemurs vary greatly in size. They include the smallest primates in the world and, until recently, also included some of the largest. They currently range in size from about 30 g (1.1 oz) for <a href="Madame%20Berthe%27s%20mouse%20lemur">Madame Berthe's mouse lemur</a> ("Microcebus berthae") up to 7–9 kg (15–20 lb) for the <a href="indri">indri</a> ("Indri indri") and <a href="diademed%20sifaka">diademed sifaka</a> ("Propithecus diadema"). One recently extinct species rivaled the <a href="gorilla">gorilla</a> in size, at 160–200 kg (350–440 lb) for "<a href="Archaeoindris%20fontoynonti">Archaeoindris fontoynonti</a>".
Like all primates, lemurs have five divergent <a href="digit%20%28anatomy%29">digits</a> with <a href="nail%20%28anatomy%29">nails</a> (in most cases) on their hands and feet. Most lemurs possess a laterally compressed, elongated nail, called a <a href="toilet-claw">toilet-claw</a>, on the second toe and use it for scratching and grooming. In addition to the toilet-claw, lemurs share a variety of other traits with other strepsirrhine primates, which include a <a href="rhinarium">rhinarium</a> (or "wet nose"); a fully functional <a href="vomeronasal%20organ">vomeronasal organ</a>, which detects <a href="pheromone">pheromone</a>s; a <a href="postorbital%20bar">postorbital bar</a> and the lack of <a href="postorbital%20septum">postorbital closure</a> (a wall of thin bone behind the eye); <a href="orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbits</a> (bony sockets that enclose the eye) that are not fully facing forward; left and right <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw) bones that are not fully fused; and a small <a href="brain-to-body%20mass%20ratio">brain-to-body mass ratio</a>.

Additional traits shared with other <a href="prosimian">prosimian</a> primates (strepsirrhine primates and <a href="tarsier">tarsier</a>s) include a bicornuate (two-horned) <a href="uterus">uterus</a> and <a href="placentation">epitheliochorial placentation</a>. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less independent of the other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted <a href="hallux">hallux</a> (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a <a href="prehensile%20tail">prehensile tail</a>, a trait found only in <a href="New%20World%20monkey">New World monkey</a>s, particularly <a href="atelidae">atelids</a>, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, but not with the visually oriented higher primates. This sense of smell is important in terms of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.

Lemurs are a diverse group of primates in terms of morphology and physiology. Some lemurs, such as the <a href="sportive%20lemur">sportive lemur</a>s and <a href="indriidae">indriids</a>, have longer <a href="hind%20limb">hind limb</a>s than <a href="forelimb">forelimb</a>s, making them excellent <a href="Jumping">leapers</a>. Indriids also have a specialized <a href="digestive%20system">digestive system</a> for <a href="folivore">folivory</a>, exhibiting enlarged <a href="salivary%20gland">salivary gland</a>s, a spacious <a href="stomach">stomach</a>, and an elongated <a href="caecum">caecum</a> (lower gut) that facilitates <a href="fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29">fermentation</a>. The <a href="hairy-eared%20dwarf%20lemur">hairy-eared dwarf lemur</a> ("Allocebus trichotis") reportedly has a very long <a href="tongue">tongue</a>, allowing it to feed on <a href="nectar">nectar</a>. Likewise, the <a href="red-bellied%20lemur">red-bellied lemur</a> ("Eulemur rubriventer") has a feathery brush-shaped tongue, also uniquely adapted to feed on nectar and pollen. The aye-aye has evolved some traits that are unique among primates, making it stand out among the lemurs. Such traits include continuously growing, rodent-like front teeth for gnawing through wood and hard seeds; a highly mobile, filiform (filament-shaped) middle finger for extracting food from tiny holes; large, <a href="bat">bat</a>-like ears for detecting hollow spaces within trees; and use of self-generated acoustical cues to forage.

Lemurs are unusual since they have great variability in their social structure, yet generally lack <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> in size and canine tooth morphology. However, some species tend towards having larger females, and two species of <a href="true%20lemur">true lemur</a> (genus "Eulemur"), the <a href="gray-headed%20lemur">gray-headed lemur</a> ("E. albocollaris") and the <a href="red%20lemur">red lemur</a> ("E. rufus"), exhibit size differences in canine teeth. True lemurs show <a href="sexual%20dichromatism">sexual dichromatism</a> (sexual differences in fur coloration), but the difference between the genders varies from strikingly obvious, as in the <a href="blue-eyed%20black%20lemur">blue-eyed black lemur</a> ("E. macaco"), to nearly imperceptible in the case of the <a href="common%20brown%20lemur">common brown lemur</a> ("E. fulvus").

<a href="Cryptic%20species%20complex">Crypsis</a>, or the inability of humans to visually distinguish between two or more distinct species, has recently been discovered among lemurs, particularly within the <a href="sportive%20lemur">sportive lemur</a>s ("Lepilemur") and <a href="mouse%20lemur">mouse lemur</a>s ("Microcebus"). With sportive lemurs, <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> were traditionally defined based on slight morphological differences, but new genetic evidence has supported giving full species status to these regional populations. In the case of mouse lemurs, the <a href="gray%20mouse%20lemur">gray mouse lemur</a> ("M. murinus"), <a href="golden-brown%20mouse%20lemur">golden-brown mouse lemur</a> ("M. ravelobensis"), and <a href="Goodman%27s%20mouse%20lemur">Goodman's mouse lemur</a> ("M. lehilahytsara") were considered the same species until recently, when genetic tests identified them as cryptic species.

The lemur <a href="dentition">dentition</a> is <a href="heterodont">heterodont</a> (having multiple tooth morphologies) and derives from an ancestral primate <a href="permanent%20teeth">permanent dentition</a> of . Indriids, sportive lemurs, the aye-aye, and the extinct <a href="sloth%20lemur">sloth lemur</a>s, <a href="monkey%20lemur">monkey lemur</a>s, and <a href="koala%20lemur">koala lemur</a>s have reduced dentitions, having lost incisors, canines, or premolars. The ancestral <a href="deciduous%20teeth">deciduous dentition</a> is , but young indriids, aye-ayes, koala lemurs, sloth lemurs, and probably monkey lemurs have fewer deciduous teeth.

There are also noticeable differences in dental morphology and tooth topography between lemurs. <a href="Indri">Indri</a>, for instance, have teeth that are perfectly adapted for shearing leaves and crushing seeds. In the <a href="toothcomb">toothcomb</a> of most lemurs, the bottom <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s and <a href="canine%20tooth">canine teeth</a> are procumbent (face forward rather than up) and finely spaced, thus providing a tool for either <a href="Personal%20grooming">grooming</a> or feeding. For instance, indri use their toothcomb not only for grooming, but also to pry out the large seeds from the tough <a href="Fruit%20anatomy%23Epicarp">epicarp</a> of "<a href="Beilschmiedia">Beilschmiedia</a>" fruits, while <a href="fork-marked%20lemur">fork-marked lemur</a>s use their relatively long toothcomb to cut through tree <a href="Bark%20%28botany%29">bark</a> to induce the flow of <a href="Plant%20sap">tree sap</a>. The toothcomb is kept clean by the <a href="sublingua">sublingua</a> or "under-tongue", a specialized structure that acts like a toothbrush to remove hair and other debris. The sublingua extends below the tip of the tongue and is tipped with <a href="keratin">keratin</a>ized, serrated points that rake between the front teeth.
Only the aye-aye, the extinct <a href="giant%20aye-aye">giant aye-aye</a>, and the largest of the extinct giant sloth lemurs lack a functional strepsirrhine toothcomb. In the case of the aye-aye, the morphology of the deciduous incisors, which are lost shortly after birth, indicate that its ancestors had a toothcomb. These milk teeth are lost shortly after birth and are replaced by open-rooted, continually growing (<a href="hypselodont">hypselodont</a>) incisors.

The toothcomb in lemurs normally consists of six teeth (four incisors and two canines), although indriids, monkey lemurs, and some sloth lemurs only have a four-tooth toothcomb due to the loss of either a canine or an incisor. Because the lower canine is either included in the toothcomb or lost, the lower dentition can be difficult to read, especially since the first premolar (P2) is often shaped like a canine (caniniform) to fill the canine's role. In <a href="folivore">folivorous</a> (leaf-eating) lemurs, except for indriids, the upper incisors are greatly reduced or absent. Used together with the toothcomb on the <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw), this complex is reminiscent of an <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a> <a href="Dental%20pad">browsing pad</a>.

Lemurs are unusual among primates for their rapid dental development, particularly among the largest species. For example, indriids have relatively slow body growth but extremely fast tooth formation and <a href="Tooth%20eruption">eruption</a>. By contrast, <a href="Simian">anthropoid</a> primates exhibit slower dental development with increased size and slower morphological development. Lemurs are also dentally <a href="precocial">precocious</a> at birth, and have their full permanent dentition at <a href="weaning">weaning</a>.

Lemurs generally have thin <a href="tooth%20enamel">tooth enamel</a> compared to anthropoid primates. This may result in extra wear and breakage to the <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Anterior%20and%20posterior">anterior</a> (front) teeth due to heavy use in grooming, feeding, and fighting. Little other dental health information is available for lemurs, except that wild ring-tailed lemurs at <a href="Berenty%20Private%20Reserve">Berenty Private Reserve</a> occasionally exhibit <a href="abscess">abscess</a>ed <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a>ry canines (seen as open wounds on the muzzle) and <a href="Dental%20caries">tooth decay</a>, possibly due to the consumption of non-native foods.
The sense of smell, or <a href="olfaction">olfaction</a>, is highly important to lemurs and is frequently used in communication. Lemurs have long snouts (compared to the short snouts of haplorrhines) that are traditionally thought to position the nose for better sifting of smells, although long snouts do not necessarily translate into high olfactory acuity since it is not the relative size of the <a href="nasal%20cavity">nasal cavity</a> that correlates with smell, but the density of <a href="olfactory%20receptor">olfactory receptor</a>s. Instead, the long snouts may facilitate better chewing.
The wet nose, or <a href="rhinarium">rhinarium</a>, is a trait shared with other strepsirrhines and many other mammals, but not with haplorrhine primates. Although it is claimed to enhance the sense of smell, it is actually a touch-based sense organ that connects with a well-developed <a href="vomeronasal%20organ">vomeronasal organ</a> (VNO). Since pheromones are usually large, non-volatile molecules, the rhinarium is used to touch a scent-marked object and transfer the pheromone molecules down the <a href="philtrum">philtrum</a> (the nasal mid-line cleft) to the VNO via the <a href="nasopalatine%20duct">nasopalatine duct</a>s that travel through the <a href="incisive%20foramen">incisive foramen</a> of the <a href="hard%20palate">hard palate</a>.

To communicate with smell, which is useful at night, lemurs will <a href="Territorial%20marking%23Spraying">scent mark</a> with <a href="urine">urine</a> as well as <a href="scent%20gland">scent gland</a>s located on the wrists, inside elbow, genital regions, or the neck. The <a href="scrotum">scrotal skin</a> of most male lemurs has scent glands. <a href="Ruffed%20lemur">Ruffed lemur</a>s (genus "Varecia") and male sifakas have a gland at the base of their neck, while the <a href="greater%20bamboo%20lemur">greater bamboo lemur</a> ("Prolemur simus") and the ring-tailed lemur have glands inside the upper arms near the <a href="axilla">axilla</a>. Male ring-tailed lemurs also have scent glands on the inside of their forearms, adjacent to a thorn-like spur, which they use to gouge, and simultaneously, scent-mark tree branches. They will also wipe their tails between their forearms and then engage in "stink fights" by waving their tail at their opponents.

Lemurs (and strepsirrhines in general) are considered to be less visually oriented than the higher primates, since they rely so heavily on their sense of smell and pheromone detection. The <a href="fovea%20centralis%20in%20macula">fovea</a> on the <a href="retina">retina</a>; which yields higher <a href="visual%20acuity">visual acuity</a>, is not well-developed. The <a href="postorbital%20septum">postorbital septum</a> (or bony closure behind the eye) in haplorrhine primates is thought to stabilize the eye slightly, allowing for the evolution of the fovea. With only a postorbital bar, lemurs have been unable to develop a fovea. Therefore, regardless of their activity pattern (nocturnal, cathemeral, or diurnal), lemurs exhibit low visual acuity and high <a href="retinal%20summation">retinal summation</a>. Lemurs can see a wider visual field, however, than anthropoid primates due to a slight difference in the angle between the eyes, as shown in the following table:

Although they lack a fovea, some <a href="diurnality">diurnal</a> lemurs have a <a href="cone%20cell">cone</a>-rich, although less clustered, <a href="area%20centralis">area centralis</a>. This area centralis has a high <a href="rod%20cell">rod</a>-to-cone cell ratio in many diurnal species studied thus far, whereas diurnal anthropoids have no rod cells in their fovea. Once again, this suggests lower visual acuity in lemurs than in anthropoids. Furthermore, the rod-to-cone cell ratio can be variable even among diurnal species. For instance, <a href="Verreaux%27s%20sifaka">Verreaux's sifaka</a> ("Propithecus verreauxi") and the <a href="indri">indri</a> ("Indri indri") have only a few large cones scattered along their predominantly rod-dominated retina. The eyes of the ring-tailed lemur contain one cone to five rods. Nocturnal lemurs such as mouse lemurs and <a href="dwarf%20lemur">dwarf lemur</a>s, on the other hand, have retinas made up entirely of rod cells.

Since cone cells make <a href="color%20vision">color vision</a> possible, the high prevalence of rod cells in lemur eyes suggest they have not <a href="Evolution%20of%20color%20vision%20in%20primates">evolved color vision</a>. The most studied lemur, the ring-tailed lemur, has been shown to have blue-yellow vision, but lacks the ability to distinguish red and green hues. Due to <a href="polymorphism%20%28biology%29">polymorphism</a> in <a href="opsin">opsin</a> genes, which code for color receptivity, <a href="trichromacy">trichromatic vision</a> may rarely occur in females of a few lemur species, such as <a href="Coquerel%27s%20sifaka">Coquerel's sifaka</a> ("Propithecus coquereli") and the <a href="red%20ruffed%20lemur">red ruffed lemur</a> ("Varecia rubra"). Most lemurs, therefore, are either <a href="monochromacy">monochromats</a> or <a href="dichromacy">dichromats</a>.
Most lemurs have retained the <a href="tapetum%20lucidum">tapetum lucidum</a>, a reflective layer of tissue in the eye, which is found in many vertebrates. This trait is absent in haplorrhine primates, and its presence further limits the visual acuity in lemurs. The strepsirrhine choroidal tapetum is unique among mammals because it is made up of crystalline <a href="riboflavin">riboflavin</a>, and the resulting optical scattering is what limits visual acuity. Although the tapetum is considered to be ubiquitous in lemurs, there appear to be exceptions among true lemurs, such as the black lemur and the common brown lemur, as well as the ruffed lemurs. Since the riboflavins in the tapetum have a tendency to dissolve and vanish when processed for histological investigation, however, the exceptions are still debatable.

Lemurs also have a third eyelid known as a <a href="nictitating%20membrane">nictitating membrane</a>, whereas most other primates have a lesser developed <a href="plica%20semilunaris%20of%20the%20conjunctiva">plica semilunaris</a>. The nictitating membrane keeps the <a href="cornea">cornea</a> moist and clean by sweeping across the eye.

Lemurs have low <a href="basal%20metabolic%20rate">basal metabolic rate</a>s (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy during the dry season, when water and food are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The <a href="red-tailed%20sportive%20lemur">red-tailed sportive lemur</a> ("Lepilemur ruficaudatus"), for instance, reportedly has one of the lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of <a href="dormancy">dormancy</a> to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in <a href="white%20adipose%20tissue">white adipose tissue</a> located at the base of the tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.

Lemur behavior is as variable as lemur morphology. Differences in diet, social systems, activity patterns, locomotion, communication, predator avoidance tactics, breeding systems, and intelligence levels help define lemur taxa and set individual species apart from the rest. Although trends frequently distinguish the smaller, nocturnal lemurs from the larger, diurnal lemurs, there are often exceptions that help exemplify the unique and diverse nature of these Malagasy primates.

Lemur diets are highly variable and demonstrate a high degree of plasticity, although general trends suggest that the smallest species primarily consume fruit and insects (<a href="omnivore">omnivory</a>), while the larger species are more <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a>, consuming mostly plant material. As with all primates, hungry lemurs might eat anything that is edible, whether or not the item is one of their preferred foods. For instance, the ring-tailed lemur eats insects and small <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s when necessary and as a result it is commonly viewed as an opportunistic omnivore. <a href="Coquerel%27s%20giant%20mouse%20lemur">Coquerel's giant mouse lemur</a> ("Mirza coquereli") is mostly <a href="frugivore">frugivorous</a>, but will consume insect secretions during the dry season.

A common assumption in <a href="mammalogy">mammalogy</a> is that small mammals cannot subsist entirely on plant material and must have a high-calorie diet in order to survive. As a result, it was thought that the diet of tiny primates must be high in protein-containing insects (<a href="insectivore">insectivory</a>). Research has shown, however, that mouse lemurs, the smallest living primates, consume more fruit than insects, contradicting the popular hypothesis.

Plant material makes up the majority of most lemur diets. Members of at least 109 of all known plant families in Madagascar (55%) are exploited by lemurs. Since lemurs are primarily arboreal, most of these exploited species are <a href="woody%20plant">woody plant</a>s, including <a href="tree">tree</a>s, <a href="shrub">shrub</a>s, or <a href="liana">liana</a>s. Only the ring-tailed lemur, the <a href="bamboo%20lemur">bamboo lemur</a>s (genus "Hapalemur"), and the <a href="black-and-white%20ruffed%20lemur">black-and-white ruffed lemur</a> ("Varecia variegata") are known to consume <a href="herb">herb</a>s. While Madagascar is rich in <a href="fern">fern</a> diversity, these plants are rarely eaten by lemurs. One possible reason for this is that ferns lack flowers, fruits, and seeds—common food items in lemur diets. They also occur close to the ground, while lemurs spend most of their time in the trees. Lastly, ferns have an unpleasant taste due to the high content of <a href="tannin">tannin</a>s in their <a href="frond">frond</a>s. Likewise, <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a>s appear to be rarely exploited by lemurs due to their high tannin content. Some lemurs appear to have evolved responses against common plant defenses, however, such as tannins and alkaloids. The <a href="golden%20bamboo%20lemur">golden bamboo lemur</a> ("Hapalemur aureus"), for instance, eats giant bamboo ("<a href="Cathariostachys%20madagascariensis">Cathariostachys madagascariensis</a>"), which contains high levels of <a href="cyanide">cyanide</a>. This lemur can consume twelve times the typically lethal dose for most mammals on a daily basis; the physiological mechanisms that protect it from cyanide poisoning are unknown. At the <a href="Duke%20Lemur%20Center">Duke Lemur Center</a> (DLC) in the United States, lemurs that roam the outdoor enclosures have been observed eating <a href="poison%20ivy">poison ivy</a> ("Taxicodendron radicans"), yet have shown no ill effects.
Many of the larger lemur species consume leaves (<a href="folivore">folivory</a>), particularly the indriids. However, some smaller lemurs such as <a href="sportive%20lemur">sportive lemur</a>s (genus "Lepilemur") and <a href="woolly%20lemur">woolly lemur</a>s (genus "Avahi") also primarily eat leaves, making them the smallest primates that do so. The smallest of the lemurs generally do not eat much leaf matter. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming leaves from at least 82 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. Lemurs tend to be selective in their consumption of the part of the leaf or shoot as well as its age. Often, young leaves are preferred over mature leaves.

Many lemurs that eat leaves tend to do so during times of fruit scarcity, sometimes suffering weight loss as a result. Most lemur species, including most of the smallest lemurs and excluding some of the indriids, predominantly eat fruit (<a href="frugivore">frugivory</a>) when available. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming fruit from at least 86 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. As with most tropical fruit eaters, the lemur diet is dominated by fruit from "<a href="Ficus">Ficus</a>" (fig) species. In many anthropoid primates, fruit is a primary source of <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a>, but unlike anthropoid primates, lemurs (and all strepsirrhines) can synthesize their own vitamin C. Historically, captive lemur diets high in vitamin C-rich fruits have been thought to cause <a href="hemosiderosis">hemosiderosis</a>, a type of <a href="iron%20overload">iron overload disorder</a>, since vitamin C increases iron absorption. Although lemurs in captivity have been shown to be prone to hemosiderosis, the frequency of the disease varies across institutions and may depend on the diet, husbandry protocols, and genetic stock. Assumptions about the problem need to be tested separately for each species. The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, seems to be less prone to the disorder than other lemur species.

Only eight species of lemur are known to be <a href="seed%20predation">seed predators</a> (granivores), but this may be under-reported since most observations only report fruit consumption and do not investigate whether the seeds are consumed as well. These lemurs include some indriids, such as the <a href="diademed%20sifaka">diademed sifaka</a> ("Propithecus diadema"), the <a href="golden-crowned%20sifaka">golden-crowned sifaka</a> ("Propithecus tattersalli"), the indri, and the aye-aye. The aye-aye, which specializes in structurally defended resources, can chew through "<a href="Canarium">Canarium</a>" seeds, which are harder than the seeds that <a href="New%20World%20monkey">New World monkey</a>s are known to break open. At least 36 genera from 23 families of plants are targeted by lemur seed predators.

<a href="Inflorescence">Inflorescence</a>s (clusters of flowers) of at least 60 plant families are eaten by lemurs ranging in size from the tiny mouse lemurs to the relatively large ruffed lemurs. If the flowers are not exploited, sometimes the nectar is consumed (<a href="nectarivore">nectarivory</a>) along with the pollen (<a href="palynivore">palynivory</a>). At least 24 native species from 17 plant families are targeted for nectar or pollen consumption.

Bark and plant exudates such as <a href="tree%20sap">tree sap</a> are consumed by a few lemur species. The exploitation of exudates has been reported in 18 plant species and only in the dry regions in the south and west of Madagascar. Only the <a href="Masoala%20fork-marked%20lemur">Masoala fork-marked lemur</a> ("Phaner furcifer") and Coquerel's giant mouse lemur regularly consume tree sap. Bark has never been reported as an important food item in lemur diets, but at least four species eat it: the aye-aye, the <a href="red-tailed%20sportive%20lemur">red-tailed sportive lemur</a> ("Lepilemur ruficaudatus"), the <a href="common%20brown%20lemur">common brown lemur</a> ("Eulemur fulvus"), and <a href="Verreaux%27s%20sifaka">Verreaux's sifaka</a> ("Propithecus verreauxi"). Most bark feeding is directly linked to exudate feeding, except for the aye-aye's bark feeding on "<a href="Afzelia%20bijuga">Afzelia bijuga</a>" (genus "<a href="Afzelia">Afzelia</a>") at <a href="Nosy%20Mangabe">Nosy Mangabe</a> in the northeast.

Soil consumption (<a href="geophagy">geophagy</a>) has also been reported and likely helps with <a href="digestion">digestion</a>, provides minerals and salts, and helps absorb toxins. Sifakas have been observed eating soil from <a href="termite">termite</a> mounds, possibly adding beneficial <a href="Gut%20flora">intestinal flora</a> to aid the digestion of <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a> from their folivorous diet.

Lemurs are social and live in groups that usually include fewer than 15 individuals. Observed <a href="social%20organisation">social organization</a> patterns include "<a href="solitary%20but%20social">solitary but social</a>", "<a href="Fission-fusion%20society">fission-fusion</a>", "<a href="pair%20bond">pair bond</a>s", and "<a href="multi-male%20group">multi-male group</a>". Nocturnal lemurs are mostly solitary but social, foraging alone at night but often nesting in groups during the day. The degree of socialization varies by species, gender, location, and season. In many nocturnal species, for instance, the females, along with their young, will share nests with other females and possibly one male, whose larger <a href="home%20range">home range</a> happens to overlap one or more female nesting groups. In <a href="sportive%20lemur">sportive lemur</a>s and <a href="fork-marked%20lemur">fork-marked lemur</a>s, one or two females may share a home range, possibly with a male. In addition to sharing nests, they will also interact vocally or physically with their range-mate while they forage at night. Diurnal lemurs exhibit many of the social systems seen in monkeys and apes, living in relatively permanent and cohesive social groups. Multi-male groups are the most common, just as they are in most anthropoid primates. <a href="True%20lemur">True lemur</a>s utilize this social system, often living in groups of ten or less. Ruffed lemurs have been shown to live in fission-fusion societies, and Indri forms pair bonds.
Some lemurs exhibit female <a href="philopatry">philopatry</a>, where females stay within their natal range and the males migrate upon reaching maturity, and in other species both sexes will migrate. In some cases, female philopatry may help explain the evolution of female-bonded multi-male groups, such as those of the ring-tailed lemur, <a href="Milne-Edwards%27%20sifaka">Milne-Edwards' sifaka</a> ("Propithecus edwardsi"), and the Verreaux's sifaka. Their ancestors may have been more solitary, with females that lived in mother-daughter pairs (or dyads). Over time, these dyads may have allied themselves with other neighboring mother-daughter dyads in order to defend more distributed resources in a wide home range. If this is true, then multi-male groups in lemurs may differ fundamentally in their internal structure from those in <a href="catarrhini">catarrhine</a> primates (Old World monkeys and apes).

The presence of female <a href="dominance%20%28ethology%29">social dominance</a> sets lemurs apart from most other primates and mammals; in most primate societies, males are dominant unless females band together to form coalitions that displace them. However, many "Eulemur" species are exceptions and the <a href="greater%20bamboo%20lemur">greater bamboo lemur</a> ("Prolemur simus") does not exhibit female dominance. When females are dominant within a group, the way they maintain dominance varies. Ring-tailed lemur males act submissively with or without signs of female aggression. Male <a href="crowned%20lemur">crowned lemur</a>s ("Eulemur coronatus"), on the other hand, will only act submissively when females act aggressively towards them. Female aggression is often associated with, but not limited to, feeding.

There have been many hypotheses that have attempted to explain why lemurs exhibit female social dominance while other primates with similar social structures do not, but no consensus has been reached after decades of research. The dominant view in the literature states that female dominance is an advantageous trait given the high costs of reproduction and the scarcity of resources available. Indeed, female dominance has been shown to be linked to increased maternal investment. However, when reproductive costs and extreme seasonality of resources were compared across primates, other primates demonstrated male dominance under conditions that were similar to or more challenging than those faced by lemurs. In 2008, a new hypothesis revised this model using simple <a href="game%20theory">game theory</a>. It was argued that when two individuals were equally matched in fighting capacity, the one with the most need would win the conflict since it would have the most to lose. Consequently, the female, with higher resource needs for pregnancy, lactation, and maternal care, was more likely to win in resource conflicts with equally sized males. This, however, assumed monomorphism between sexes. The following year, a new hypothesis was proposed to explain monomorphism, stating that because most female lemurs are only sexually receptive for a day or two each year, males can utilize a more passive form of mate guarding: <a href="Mating%20plug">copulatory plugs</a>, which block the female reproductive tract, preventing other males from successfully mating with her, and thus reducing the need for aggression and the evolutionary drive for sexual dimorphism.
In general, levels of <a href="agonistic%20behaviour">agonism</a> (or aggression) tend to correlate with relative canine height. The ring-tailed lemur has long, sharp upper canine teeth in both sexes, and it also exhibits high levels of agonism. The Indri, on the other hand, has smaller canines and exhibits lower levels of aggression. When neighboring groups of the same species defend their territories, the conflict can take the form of ritualized defense. In sifakas, these ritualized combats involve staring, growling, scent-marking, and leaping to occupy certain sections of the tree. The indri defends its home range with ritualized "singing" battles.

Like other primates, lemurs groom socially (<a href="Social%20grooming">allogroom</a>) to ease tensions and solidify relationships. They groom in greeting, when waking up, when settling in for sleep, between mother and infant, in juvenile relations, and for sexual advances. Unlike anthropoid primates, who part the fur with the hands and pick out particles with the fingers or mouth, lemurs groom with their tongue and scraping with their toothcomb. Despite the differences in technique, lemurs groom with the same frequency and for the same reasons as anthropoids.
The <a href="Chronobiology">biological rhythm</a> can vary from nocturnal in smaller lemurs to diurnal in most larger lemurs. Diurnality is not seen in any other living strepsirrhine. <a href="Cathemeral">Cathemeral</a>ity, where an animal is active sporadically both day and night, occurs among some of the larger lemurs. Few if any other primates exhibit this sort of activity cycle, either regularly or irregularly under changing environmental conditions. The most heavily studied cathemeral lemurs are the true lemurs. Although the <a href="mongoose%20lemur">mongoose lemur</a> ("E. mongoz") is the best-documented example, every species in the genus studied has shown some degree of cathemeral behavior, although night activity is often restricted by light availability and moon periodicity. This type of behavior was first documented in the 1960s in true lemur species as well as other <a href="Lemuridae">Lemuridae</a> species, such as <a href="ruffed%20lemur">ruffed lemur</a>s and <a href="bamboo%20lemur">bamboo lemur</a>s. Initially described as "<a href="crepuscular">crepuscular</a>" (active at dawn and dusk), <a href="anthropologist">anthropologist</a> <a href="Ian%20Tattersall">Ian Tattersall</a> stimulated additional research and coined the new term "cathemeral", although many non-anthropologists prefer the terms "circadian" or "diel".

In order to conserve energy and water in their highly seasonal environment, mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs exhibit seasonal behavioral cycles of <a href="dormancy">dormancy</a> where the metabolic rate and body temperature are lowered. They are the only primates known to do so. They accumulate fat reserves in their hind legs and the base of their tail before the dry winter season, when food and water are scarce, and can exhibit daily and prolonged <a href="torpor">torpor</a> during the dry season. Daily torpor constitutes less than 24 hours of dormancy, whereas prolonged torpor averages two weeks in duration and signals <a href="hibernation">hibernation</a>. Mouse lemurs have been observed experiencing torpor that lasts for several consecutive days, but dwarf lemurs are known to hibernate for six to eight months every year, particularly on the west coast of Madagascar.

Dwarf lemurs are the only primates known to hibernate for extended periods. Unlike other hibernating mammals from <a href="Temperateness">temperate regions</a>, which have to awaken regularly for a few days, dwarf lemurs experience five months of continuous deep hibernation (May through September). Before and after this deep hibernation, there are two months (April and October) of transition, where they will forage on a limited basis to reduce demands on their fat reserves. Unlike any other hibernating mammal, the body temperature of hibernating dwarf lemurs will fluctuate with the ambient temperature rather than remaining low and stable.

Other lemurs that do not exhibit dormancy conserve energy by selecting thermoregulated microhabitats (such as tree holes), sharing nests, and reducing exposed body surfaces, such as by hunched sitting and group huddling. Also, the ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemurs, and sifakas are commonly seen sunning, thus using solar radiation to warm their bodies instead of <a href="metabolism">metabolic heat</a>.

<a href="Animal%20locomotion">Locomotor behavior</a> in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly varied and its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids. Locomotor postures and behaviors have included <a href="vertical%20clinging%20and%20leaping">vertical clinging and leaping</a> (including <a href="Jumping">saltatory</a> behavior), seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs; slow (<a href="loris">loris</a>-like) arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by "<a href="Mesopropithecus">Mesopropithecus</a>"; fast arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, seen in true lemurs and ruffed lemurs; partially terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, seen in the ring-tailed lemur; highly terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by <a href="monkey%20lemur">monkey lemur</a>s such as "<a href="Hadropithecus">Hadropithecus</a>"; and <a href="sloth">sloth</a>-like suspensory locomotion, once exhibited by many of the <a href="sloth%20lemur">sloth lemur</a>s, such as "<a href="Palaeopropithecus">Palaeopropithecus</a>". The <a href="Lac%20Alaotra%20gentle%20lemur">Lac Alaotra gentle lemur</a> ("Hapalemur alaotrensis") has even been reported to be a good <a href="Aquatic%20locomotion">swimmer</a>. Sometimes these locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.

The jumping prowess of the indriids have been well documented and are popular among <a href="ecotourism">ecotourists</a> visiting Madagascar. Using their long, powerful back legs, they catapult themselves into the air and land in an upright posture on a nearby tree, with both hands and feet tightly gripping the trunk. Indriids can leap up to 10 m (33 ft) rapidly from tree trunk to tree trunk, an ability referred to as "ricochetal leaping". <a href="Verreaux%27s%20sifaka">Verreaux's sifaka</a> ("Propithecus verreauxi") manages to do this in the <a href="Madagascar%20spiny%20thickets">spiny forests</a> of southern Madagascar. It is unknown how it avoids impaling its palms on the thorn-covered trunks of large plants such as "<a href="Alluaudia">Alluaudia</a>". When distances between trees are too great, sifakas will descend to the ground and cross distances more than 100 m (330 ft) by standing upright and hopping sideways with the arms held to the side and waving up and down from chest to head height, presumably for balance. This is sometimes described as a "dance-hop".

Lemur communication can be transmitted through sound, sight, and smell (<a href="olfaction">olfaction</a>). The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, uses complex though highly stereotyped behaviors such as <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">scent-marking</a> and <a href="Ring-tailed%20lemur%20vocalizations">vocalizations</a>. Visual signals are probably the least used by lemurs, since they lack many of the muscles used in common primate <a href="facial%20expression">facial expression</a>s. Given their poor vision, whole-body postures are probably more noticeable. However, the ring-tailed lemur has demonstrated distinct facial expressions including a threat stare, pulled back lips for submission, and pulled back ears along with flared nostrils during scent-marking. This species has also been observed using <a href="Yawn%23Non-human%20yawning">yawns</a> as threats. Their ringed tails also communicate distance, warn off neighboring troops, and help locate troop members. Sifakas are known to exhibit an open-mouth play face as well as a submissive teeth-baring grimace used in agonistic interactions.
Olfaction is particularly important to lemurs, except for the indri, which lacks most common lemur scent glands and has a greatly reduced olfactory region in the brain. Olfaction can communicate information about age, sex, reproductive status, as well as demarcate the boundaries of a territory. It is most useful for communication between animals that rarely encounter each other. Small, nocturnal lemurs mark their territories with <a href="urine">urine</a>, while the larger, diurnal species use scent glands located on various parts of their anatomy. The ring-tailed lemur engages in "stink fights" by rubbing its tail across scent glands on its wrists, and then flicking its tail at other male opponents. Some lemurs <a href="defecation">defecate</a> in specific areas, otherwise known as <a href="latrine%20behavior">latrine behavior</a>. Although many animals exhibit this behavior, it is a rare trait among primates. Latrine behavior can represent territorial marking and aid in interspecies signaling.

Compared to other mammals, primates in general are very vocal, and lemurs are no exception. Some lemur species have extensive vocal repertoires, including the ring-tailed lemur and ruffed lemurs. Some of the most common calls among lemurs are predator alarm calls. Lemurs not only respond to alarm calls of their own species, but also alarm calls of other species and those of non-predatory birds. The ring-tailed lemur and a few other species have different calls and reactions to specific types of predators. With mating calls, it has been shown that mouse lemurs that cannot be discerned visually respond more strongly to the calls of their own species, particularly when exposed to the calls of other mouse lemurs that they would encounter normally within their home range. Lemur calls can also be very loud and carry long distances. Ruffed lemurs use several loud calls that can be heard up to 1 km (0.62 mi) away on a clear, calm day. The loudest lemur is the indri, whose calls can be heard up to 2 km (1.2 mi) or more and thus communicate more effectively the territorial boundaries over its 34 to 40 hectares (0.13 to 0.15 sq mi) home range. Both ruffed lemurs and the indri exhibit contagious calling, where one individual or group starts a loud call and others within the area join in. The song of the indri can last 45 seconds to more than 3 minutes and tends to coordinate to form a stable duet comparable to that of <a href="gibbon">gibbon</a>s.

<a href="Somatosensory%20system">Tactile</a> communication (touch) is mostly used by lemurs in the form of grooming, although the ring-tailed lemur also clumps together to sleep (in an order determined by rank), reaches out and touches adjacent members, and cuffs other members. Reaching out and touching another individual in this species has been shown to be a submissive behavior, done by younger or submissive animals towards older and more dominant members of the troop. Allogrooming, however, appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals, a shared trait with other primate species. Unlike anthropoid primates, lemur grooming seems to be more intimate and mutual, often directly reciprocated. Anthropoids, on the other hand, use allogrooming to manage agonistic interactions. The ring-tailed lemur is known to be very tactile, spending between 5 and 11% of its time grooming.

All lemurs experience some predation pressure. Common defenses against predation include the use of <a href="alarm%20call">alarm call</a>s and <a href="mobbing%20behavior">predator mobbing</a>, mostly among diurnal lemurs. The leaping abilities of lemurs may have evolved for predator avoidance rather than for travel, according to a study in <a href="kinematics">kinematics</a>. Nocturnal lemurs are difficult to see and track at night and decrease their visibility by foraging alone. They also try to avoid predators by using concealing sleeping locations, such as nests, tree holes, or dense vegetation, Some may also avoid areas frequented by predators by detecting the smell of their feces. and alternating between multiple sleeping locations. Even torpor and hibernation states among <a href="cheirogaleidae">cheirogaleids</a> may be partly due to high levels of predation. Infants are protected while foraging by either leaving them in the nest or by stashing them in a hidden location, where the infant remains immobile in the absence of the parent.

Diurnal lemurs are visible during the day, so many live in groups, where the increased number of eyes and ears helps aid in predator detection. Diurnal lemurs use and respond to alarm calls, even those of other lemur species and non-predatory birds. The ring-tailed lemur has different calls and reactions to different classes of predators, such as predatory birds, mammals, or snakes. Some lemurs, such as the indri, use <a href="crypsis">crypsis</a> to camouflage themselves. They are often heard but difficult to see in the trees due to the dappled light, earning them the reputation of being "ghosts of the forest".

Except for the aye-aye and the Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, lemurs are seasonal breeders with very short mating and birth seasons influenced by the highly seasonal availability of resources in their environment. Mating season usually last less than three weeks each year, and the female <a href="vagina">vagina</a> opens up only during a few hours or days of her most receptive time of estrus. These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to relate to their short <a href="gestation">gestation</a> periods, rapid maturation, and low basal metabolic rates, as well as the high energy costs of reproduction for females. This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations—both unusual traits among primates. In both the aye-aye and Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, birth (<a href="parturition">parturition</a>) occurs over a six-month period.

Lemurs time their mating and birth seasons so that all <a href="weaning">weaning</a> periods are synchronized to match the time of highest food availability. Weaning occurs either before or shortly after the eruption of the first permanent molars in lemurs. Mouse lemurs are able to fit their entire breeding cycle into the wet season, whereas larger lemurs, such as sifakas, must <a href="lactation">lactate</a> for two months during the dry season. Infant survival in some species, such as Milne-Edwards' sifaka, has been shown to be directly impacted by both environmental conditions and the rank, age, and health of the mother. The breeding season is also affected by geographical location. For example, mouse lemurs give birth between September and October in their native habitat in the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>, but from May through June in the captive settings in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>.
<a href="Scent">Scent</a> factors heavily into lemur reproduction. Scent-marking activity escalates during the <a href="Estrous%20cycle">mating season</a>. Pheromones may coordinate reproductive timing for females coming into estrus. <a href="Mating">Mating</a> can be either <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a> or <a href="promiscuity">promiscuous</a> for both males and females, and mating can include individuals from outside the group. Monogamous lemurs include the <a href="red-bellied%20lemur">red-bellied lemur</a> ("Eulemur rubriventer") and the <a href="mongoose%20lemur">mongoose lemur</a> ("E. mongoz"), although the mongoose lemur has been observed mating outside of its pair bond. Monogamy is most common among nocturnal species, although some exhibit scramble competition, sexual suppression of subordinates, or competitions between males that avoid direct fighting. In mouse lemurs, males utilize <a href="Mating%20plug">sperm plugs</a>, developed enlarged <a href="Testicle">testes</a> during the mating season, and develop size dimorphism (likely due to the enlarged testes). These indicate a mating system known as scramble competition polygyny, where males cannot defend females or the resources that might attract them.

The <a href="gestation%20period">gestation period</a> varies within lemurs, ranging from 9 weeks in mouse lemurs and 9–10 weeks in dwarf lemurs to 18–24 weeks in other lemurs. The smaller, nocturnal lemurs, such as mouse lemurs, <a href="giant%20mouse%20lemur">giant mouse lemur</a>s, and dwarf lemurs, usually give birth to more than one infant, whereas the larger, nocturnal lemurs, such as fork-marked lemurs, sportive lemurs, and the aye-aye usually have one offspring. Dwarf and mouse lemurs have up to four offspring, but both average only two. Ruffed lemurs are the only large, diurnal lemurs to consistently give birth to two or three offspring. All other lemurs have single births. Multiple births in lemurs are normally <a href="Twin%23Fraternal%20%28dizygotic%29%20twins">fraternal</a>, and are known to occur in every five to six births in species such as the ring-tailed lemur and some "Eulemur".

After the offspring are born, lemurs either carry them around or stash them while foraging. When transported, the infants either cling to the mother's fur or are carried in the mouth by the scruff. In some species, such as bamboo lemurs, infants are carried by mouth until they are able to cling to their mother's fur. Species that park their offspring include nocturnal species (e.g. mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, and dwarf lemurs), bamboo lemurs, and ruffed lemurs. In the case of the ruffed lemurs, the young are <a href="altricial">altricial</a> and the mothers build nests for them, much like the smaller, nocturnal lemur species. Woolly lemurs are unusual for nocturnal lemurs because they live in cohesive family groups and carry their single offspring with them rather than parking them. <a href="Alloparenting">Alloparenting</a> (multiple or group parenting) has been reported in all lemur families except the sportive lemurs and aye-aye. <a href="Allonursing">Allonursing</a> is also known to occur in several lemur groups. Even males have been observed caring for infants in species such as the red-bellied lemur, mongoose lemur, eastern lesser bamboo lemur, silky sifaka, fat-tailed dwarf lemur, and ruffed lemurs.

Yet another trait that sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid primates is their long lifespan together with their high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a highly seasonal environment, which has affected their birthrate, maturation, and twinning rate (<a href="r/K%20selection%20theory">r-selection</a>). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live twice as long as they do in the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. We now know that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging (<a href="senescence">senescence</a>) and still be capable of reproduction.

Lemurs have traditionally been regarded as being less intelligent than anthropoid primates, with <a href="monkey">monkey</a>s and apes often described as having more cunning, guile, and deceptiveness. Many lemur species, such as sifakas and the ring-tailed lemur, have scored lower on tests designed for monkeys while performing as well as monkeys on other tests. These comparisons may not be fair since lemurs prefer to manipulate objects with their mouths (rather than their hands) and only take interest in objects when in captivity. Recent studies have shown that lemurs exhibit levels of technical intelligence on par with many other primates, although they manipulate objects less often. <a href="Tool%20use%20by%20animals">Tool use</a> has not been witnessed by lemurs in the wild, although in captivity the common brown lemur and the ring-tailed lemur have been demonstrated to be able to understand and use tools.

A few lemurs have been noted to have relatively large brains. The extinct "Hadropithecus" was as large as a large male <a href="baboon">baboon</a> and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate a higher level of intelligence. However, despite having a built-in tool in the form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.

Madagascar not only contains two radically different <a href="climate">climatic zones</a>, the rainforests of the east and the dry regions of the west, but also swings from extended drought to <a href="cyclone">cyclone</a>-generated floods. These climatic and geographical challenges, along with poor soils, low plant productivity, wide ranges of <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a> complexity, and a lack of regularly fruiting trees (such as <a href="Ficus">fig trees</a>) have driven the evolution of lemurs' immense morphological and behavioral diversity. Their survival has required the ability to endure the persistent extremes, not yearly averages.
Lemurs have either presently or formerly filled the <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>s normally occupied by monkeys, squirrels, <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a>s, and grazing <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a>s. With the diversity of adaptations for specific ecological niches, habitat selections among lemur families and some genera are often very distinct, thus minimizing <a href="competition%20%28biology%29">competition</a>. In nocturnal lemurs from the more seasonal forests in the west, up to five species can coexist during the wet season due to high food abundance. However, to endure the extreme dry season, three of the five species utilize different dietary patterns and their underlying physiological traits to allow them to coexist: fork-marked lemurs feed on tree gum, sportive lemurs feed on leaves, and giant mouse lemurs sometimes feed on insect secretions. The other two species, the gray mouse lemur and the fat-tailed dwarf lemur ("Cheirogaleus medius"), avoid competition through reduced activity. The gray mouse lemur uses bouts of torpor, while the fat-tailed dwarf lemur hibernates completely. Similarly, on the east coast entire genera focus on specific food to avoid too much niche overlap. True lemurs and ruffed lemurs are frugivorous, indriids are folivorous, and bamboo lemurs specialize in bamboo and other grasses. Once again, seasonal dietary differences as well as subtle differences in <a href="substrate%20%28biology%29">substrate</a> preferences, <a href="Tropical%20rainforest%23Layers">forest strata</a> used, activity cycle, and social organization enable lemur species to coexist, although this time the species are more closely related and have similar niches. A classic example involves <a href="Niche%20differentiation">resource partitioning</a> between three species of bamboo lemur that live in close proximity in small forested areas: the golden bamboo lemur, the greater bamboo lemur, and the <a href="eastern%20lesser%20bamboo%20lemur">eastern lesser bamboo lemur</a> ("Hapalemur griseus"). Each utilizes either different species of bamboo, different parts of the plant, or different layers in the forest. Nutrient and toxin content (such as cyanide) help regulate food selection, though seasonal food preferences are also known to play a role.

Dietary regimes of lemurs include <a href="folivore">folivory</a>, <a href="frugivore">frugivory</a>, and <a href="omnivore">omnivory</a>, with some being highly adaptable while others specialize on foods such as plant exudates (tree gum) and bamboo. In some cases, lemur feeding patterns directly benefit the native plant life. When lemurs exploit nectar, they may act as pollinators as long as the functional parts of the flower are not damaged. In fact, several unrelated Malagasy flowering plants demonstrate lemur-specific pollination traits, and studies indicate that some diurnal species, such as the red-bellied lemur and the ruffed lemurs, act as major pollinators. Two examples of plant species that rely on lemurs for pollination include traveller's palm ("<a href="Ravenala%20madagascariensis">Ravenala madagascariensis</a>") and a species of <a href="legume">legume</a>-like liana, "<a href="Strongylodon">Strongylodon cravieniae</a>". <a href="Seed%20dispersal">Seed dispersal</a> is another service lemurs provide. After passing through the lemur gut, tree and vine seeds exhibit lower mortality and <a href="germination">germinate</a> faster. Latrine behavior exhibited by some lemurs may help improve soil quality and facilitate seed dispersal. Because of their importance in maintaining a healthy forest, frugivorous lemurs may qualify as <a href="keystone%20species">keystone mutualists</a>.

All lemurs, particularly the smaller species, are affected by predation and they are important prey items for predators. Humans are the most significant predator of diurnal lemurs, despite <a href="taboo">taboo</a>s that occasionally forbid the hunting and eating of certain lemur species. Other predators include native <a href="eupleridae">euplerids</a>, such as the <a href="Fossa%20%28animal%29">fossa</a>, <a href="feral%20cat">feral cat</a>s, <a href="dog">domestic dogs</a>, <a href="snake">snake</a>s, diurnal <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>, <a href="owl">owl</a>s, and <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a>s. Extinct giant eagles, including one or two species from the genus "<a href="Aquila%20%28genus%29">Aquila</a>" and the giant <a href="Malagasy%20crowned%20eagle">Malagasy crowned eagle</a> ("Stephanoaetus mahery"), as well as the giant fossa ("<a href="Cryptoprocta%20spelea">Cryptoprocta spelea</a>"), previously also preyed on lemurs, perhaps including the giant subfossil lemurs or their subadult offspring. The existence of these extinct giants suggests that predator-prey interactions involving lemurs were more complex than they are today. Today, predator size only restricts owls to the smaller lemurs, usually 100 g (3.5 oz) or less, while the larger lemurs fall victim to the larger diurnal birds of prey, such as the <a href="Madagascan%20harrier-hawk">Madagascan harrier-hawk</a> ("Polyboroides radiatus") and the <a href="Madagascar%20buzzard">Madagascar buzzard</a> ("Buteo brachypterus").

Similarities that lemurs share with anthropoid primates, such as diet and social organization, along with their own unique traits, have made lemurs the most heavily studied of all mammal groups on Madagascar. Research often focuses on the link between ecology and social organization, but also on their behavior and morphophysiology (the study of anatomy in relation to function). Studies of their life-history traits, behavior and ecology help understanding of primate evolution, since they are thought to share similarities with ancestral primates.

Lemurs have been the focus of <a href="monographic%20series">monographic series</a>, action plans, field guides, and classic works in ethology. However, few species have been thoroughly studied to date, and most research has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality. Only recently have numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior and ecology of poorly known species. <a href="Field%20study">Field studies</a> have given insights on <a href="population%20dynamics">population dynamics</a> and <a href="evolutionary%20ecology">evolutionary ecology</a> of most genera and many species. Long-term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations. However, learning opportunities are dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island.
Lemurs are mentioned in sailors' voyage logs as far back as 1608 and in 1658 that at least seven lemur species were described in detail by the French merchant, <a href="%C3%89tienne%20de%20Flacourt">Étienne de Flacourt</a>, who may also have been the only westerner to see and chronicle the existence of a giant (now extinct) lemur, which he called the "<a href="Subfossil%20lemur%23Lingering%20populations">tretretretre</a>". Around 1703 merchants and sailors began bringing lemurs back to Europe, at which time <a href="James%20Petiver">James Petiver</a>, an apothecary in London, described and illustrated the mongoose lemur. Starting in 1751, the London illustrator <a href="George%20Edwards%20%28naturalist%29">George Edwards</a> began describing and illustrating some lemur species, of which a few were included in various editions of "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" by Carl Linnaeus. In the 1760s and 1770s, French naturalists <a href="Georges-Louis%20Leclerc%2C%20Comte%20de%20Buffon">Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon</a> and <a href="Louis-Jean-Marie%20Daubenton">Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton</a> began describing the anatomy of several lemur species. The first traveling naturalist to comment on lemurs was <a href="Philibert%20Commer%C3%A7on">Philibert Commerçon</a> in 1771, although it was <a href="Pierre%20Sonnerat">Pierre Sonnerat</a> who recorded a greater variety of lemur species during his travels.

During the 19th century, there was an explosion of new lemur descriptions and names, which later took decades to sort out. During this time, professional collectors gathered specimens for <a href="museum">museum</a>s, <a href="menagerie">menagerie</a>s, and <a href="Cabinet%20of%20curiosities">cabinets</a>. Some of the major collectors were <a href="Johann%20Maria%20Hildebrandt">Johann Maria Hildebrandt</a> and <a href="Charles%20Immanuel%20Forsyth%20Major">Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major</a>. From these collections, as well as increasing observations of lemurs in their natural habitats, museum <a href="systematics">systematists</a> including <a href="Albert%20G%C3%BCnther">Albert Günther</a> and <a href="John%20Edward%20Gray">John Edward Gray</a> continued to contribute new names for new lemur species. However, the most notable contributions from this century includes the work of <a href="Alfred%20Grandidier">Alfred Grandidier</a>, a naturalist and explorer who devoted himself to the study of Madagascar's natural history and local people. With the help of <a href="Alphonse%20Milne-Edwards">Alphonse Milne-Edwards</a>, most of the diurnal lemurs were illustrated at this time. However, lemur taxonomic nomenclature took its modern form in the 1920s and 1930s, being standardized by <a href="Ernst%20Schwarz%20%28zoologist%29">Ernst Schwarz</a> in 1931.

Although lemur taxonomy had developed, it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that the in-situ (or on-site) study of lemur behavior and ecology began to blossom. <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Petter">Jean-Jacques Petter</a> and <a href="Arlette%20Petter-Rousseaux">Arlette Petter-Rousseaux</a> toured Madagascar in 1956 and 1957, surveying many of its lemur species and making important observations about their social groupings and reproduction. In 1960, the year of Madagascar's independence, <a href="David%20Attenborough">David Attenborough</a> introduced lemurs to the West with a commercial film. Under the guidance of <a href="John%20Buettner-Janusch">John Buettner-Janusch</a>, who founded the <a href="Duke%20Lemur%20Center">Duke Lemur Center</a> in 1966, <a href="Alison%20Jolly">Alison Jolly</a> traveled to Madagascar in 1962 to study the diet and social behavior of the ring-tailed lemur and Verreaux's sifaka at <a href="Berenty%20Private%20Reserve">Berenty Private Reserve</a>. The Petters and Jolly spawned a new era of interest in lemur ecology and behavior and were shortly followed by anthropologists such as <a href="Alison%20Richard">Alison Richard</a>, <a href="Robert%20Sussman">Robert Sussman</a>, <a href="Ian%20Tattersall">Ian Tattersall</a>, and many others. Following the political turmoil of the mid-1970s and Madagascar's revolution, field studies resumed in the 1980s, thanks in part to the renewed involvement of the Duke Lemur Center under the direction of <a href="Elwyn%20L.%20Simons">Elwyn L. Simons</a> and the conservation efforts of <a href="Patricia%20Wright">Patricia Wright</a>. In the decades that followed, huge strides have been made in lemur studies and many new species have been discovered.

Ex situ research (or off-site research) is also popular among researchers looking to answer questions that are difficult to test in the field. For example, efforts to <a href="Full%20genome%20sequencing">sequence the genome</a> of the gray mouse lemur will help researchers understand which genetic traits set primates apart from other mammals and will ultimately help understand what genomic traits set humans apart from other primates. One of the foremost lemur research facilities is the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in <a href="Durham%2C%20North%20Carolina">Durham, North Carolina</a>. It maintains the largest captive lemur population outside of Madagascar, which it maintains for non-invasive research and <a href="captive%20breeding">captive breeding</a>. Many important research projects have been carried out there, including studies of lemur vocalizations, basic locomotor research, the <a href="kinematics">kinematics</a> of bipedalism, the effects of social complexity transitive reasoning, and cognition studies involving a lemur's ability to organize and retrieve sequences from memory. Other facilities, such as the <a href="Lemur%20Conservation%20Foundation">Lemur Conservation Foundation</a>, located near <a href="Myakka%20City%2C%20Florida">Myakka City, Florida</a>, have also hosted research projects, such as one that looked at lemurs' ability to preferentially select tools based on functional qualities.

Lemurs are threatened by a host of environmental problems, including <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>, hunting for <a href="bushmeat">bushmeat</a>, live capture for the <a href="Pet%20trade%23Illegal%20wildlife%20trade">exotic pet trade</a>, and climate change. All species are listed by <a href="CITES">CITES</a> on <a href="CITES%23Appendix%20I">Appendix I</a>, which prohibits trade of specimens or parts, except for scientific purposes. As of 2005, the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) listed 16% of all lemur species as <a href="critically%20endangered">critically endangered</a>, 23% as <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a>, 25% as <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a>, 28% as "data deficient", and only 8% as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>. Over the next five years, at least 28 species were newly identified, none of which have had their conservation status assessed. Many are likely to be considered <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a> since the new lemur species that have been described recently are typically confined to small regions. Given the rate of continued <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a>, undiscovered species could go extinct before being identified. Since the arrival of humans on the island approximately 2000 years ago, all endemic Malagasy vertebrates over 10 kg (22 lb) have disappeared, including 17 species, 8 genera, and 3 families of lemurs. The <a href="IUCN%20Species%20Survival%20Commission">IUCN Species Survival Commission</a> (IUCN/SSC), the <a href="International%20Primatological%20Society">International Primatological Society</a> (IPS), and <a href="Conservation%20International">Conservation International</a> (CI) have included as many as five lemurs in their biennial "<a href="The%20World%27s%2025%20Most%20Endangered%20Primates">Top 25 Most Endangered Primates</a>". The 2008–2010 list includes the greater bamboo lemur, <a href="gray-headed%20lemur">gray-headed lemur</a> ("Eulemur cinereiceps"), <a href="blue-eyed%20black%20lemur">blue-eyed black lemur</a> ("Eulemur flavifrons"), <a href="northern%20sportive%20lemur">northern sportive lemur</a> ("Lepilemur septentrionalis"), and silky sifaka. In 2012, an assessment by the <a href="IUCN%20Species%20Survival%20Commission%23Primate%20Specialist%20Group">Primate Specialist Group</a> of the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) concluded that 90% of the then 103 described species of lemur should be listed as <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>, making lemurs the most endangered group of mammals. The IUCN reiterated its concern in 2013, noting that 90% of all lemur species could be extinct within 20 to 25 years unless a US$7 million 3-year conservation plan aimed at helping local communities can be implemented.

Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a high <a href="population%20growth">population growth</a> rate of 2.5% per year and nearly 70% of the population living in poverty. The country is also burdened with high levels of debt and limited resources. These socioeconomic issues have complicated conservation efforts, even though the island of Madagascar has been recognized by IUCN/SSC as a critical primate region for over 20 years. Due to its relatively small land area—587,045 km (226,659 sq mi)—compared to other high-priority <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> regions and its high levels of <a href="endemism">endemism</a>, the country is considered one of the world's most important <a href="biodiversity%20hotspot">biodiversity hotspot</a>s, with lemur conservation being a high priority. Despite the added emphasis for conservation, there is no indication that the extinctions that began with the arrival of humans have come to an end.

The greatest concern facing lemur populations is habitat destruction and degradation. Deforestation takes the form of local subsistence use, such as <a href="slash%20and%20burn">slash and burn</a> agriculture (referred to as "tavy" in Malagasy), the creation of <a href="pasture">pasture</a> for cattle through burning, and legal and illegal gathering of wood for <a href="firewood">firewood</a> or <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a> production; commercial <a href="mining">mining</a>; and the <a href="Illegal%20logging%20in%20Madagascar">illegal logging</a> of precious <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a>s for foreign markets. After centuries of unsustainable use, as well as rapidly escalating forest destruction since 1950, less than 60,000 km (23,000 sq mi) or 10% of Madagascar's land area remains forested. Only 17,000 km (6,600 sq mi) or 3% of the island's land area is protected and due to dire economic conditions and <a href="2009%20Malagasy%20political%20crisis">political instability</a>, most of the protected areas are ineffectively managed and defended. Some protected areas were set aside because they were naturally protected by their remote, isolated location, often on steep cliffs. Other areas, such as the <a href="Madagascar%20dry%20deciduous%20forests">dry forests</a> and <a href="Madagascar%20spiny%20thickets">spiny forests</a> of the west and south, receive little protection and are in serious danger of being destroyed.

Some species may be in risk of extinction even without complete deforestation, such as ruffed lemurs, which are very sensitive to habitat disturbance. If large fruit trees are removed, the forest may sustain fewer individuals of a species and their reproductive success may be affected for years. Small populations may be able to persist in isolated forest fragments for 20 to 40 years due to long generation times, but in the long term, such populations may not be viable. Small, isolated populations also risk <a href="Local%20extinction">extirpation</a> by natural disasters and disease outbreaks (<a href="epizootic">epizootic</a>s). Two diseases that are lethal to lemurs and could severely impact isolated lemur populations are <a href="toxoplasmosis">toxoplasmosis</a>, which is spread by feral cats, and the <a href="herpes%20simplex%20virus">herpes simplex virus</a> carried by humans.
Climate change and weather-related natural disasters also threaten lemur survival. For the last 1000 years, western and highland regions have been growing significantly drier, but in the past few decades, severe drought has become much more frequent. There are indications that deforestation and forest fragmentation are accelerating this gradual desiccation. The effects of drought are even felt in the rainforests. As annual rainfall decreases, the larger trees that make up the high <a href="canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> suffer increased mortality, failure to fruit, and decreased production of new leaves, which folivorous lemurs prefer. Cyclones can defoliate an area, knock down canopy trees, and create landslides and flooding. This can leave lemur populations without fruit or leaves until the following spring, requiring them to subsist on crisis foods, such as <a href="epiphyte">epiphyte</a>s.

Lemurs are hunted for food by the local Malagasy, either for local subsistence or to supply a luxury meat market in the larger cities. Most rural Malagasy do not understand what "endangered" means, nor do they know that hunting lemurs is illegal or that lemurs are found only in Madagascar. Many Malagasy have taboo, or "<a href="Fady%20%28taboo%29">fady</a>", about hunting and eating lemurs, but this does not prevent hunting in many regions. Even though hunting has been a threat to lemur populations in the past, it has recently become a more serious threat as socioeconomic conditions deteriorate. Economic hardships have caused people to move around the country in search of employment, leading local traditions to break down. Drought and famine can also relax the "fady" that protect lemurs. Larger species, such as sifakas and ruffed lemurs, are common targets, but smaller species are also hunted or accidentally caught in snares intended for larger prey. Experienced, organized hunting parties using firearms, slings and blowguns can kill as many as eight to twenty lemurs in one trip. Organized hunting parties and lemur traps can be found in both non-protected areas and remote corners of protected areas. National parks and other protected areas are not adequately protected by law enforcement agencies. Often, there are too few park rangers to cover a large area, and sometimes terrain within the park is too rugged to check regularly.

Although not as significant as deforestation and hunting, some lemurs, such as crowned lemurs and other species that have successfully been kept in captivity, are occasionally kept as <a href="exotic%20pet">exotic pet</a>s by Malagasy people. Bamboo lemurs are also kept as pets, although they only survive for up to two months. Live capture for the exotic pet trade in wealthier countries is not normally considered a threat due to strict regulations controlling their export.

Lemurs have drawn much attention to Madagascar and its endangered species. In this capacity, they act as <a href="flagship%20species">flagship species</a>, the most notable of which is the ring-tailed lemur, which is considered an icon of the country. The presence of lemurs in national parks helps drive <a href="ecotourism">ecotourism</a>, which especially helps local communities living in the vicinity of the national parks, since it offers employment opportunities and the community receives half of the park entrance fees. In the case of <a href="Ranomafana%20National%20Park">Ranomafana National Park</a>, job opportunities and other revenue from long-term research can rival that of ecotourism.

Starting in 1927, the <a href="Politics%20of%20Madagascar">Malagasy government</a> has declared all lemurs as "protected" by establishing protected areas that are now classified under three categories: National Parks (Parcs Nationaux), Strict Nature Reserves (Réserves Naturelles Intégrales), and Special Reserves (Réserves Spéciales). There are currently 18 national parks, 5 strict nature reserves, and 22 special reserves, as well as several other small private reserves, such as <a href="Berenty%20Private%20Reserve">Berenty Reserve</a> and <a href="Sainte%20Luce%20Private%20Reserve">Sainte Luce Private Reserve</a>, both near <a href="T%C3%B4lanaro">Fort Dauphin</a>. All protected areas, excluding the private reserves, comprise approximately 3% of the land surface of Madagascar and are managed by <a href="Madagascar%20National%20Parks">Madagascar National Parks</a>, formerly known as l'Association Nationale pour la Gestion des Aires Protégées (ANGAP), as well as other <a href="non-governmental%20organization">non-governmental organization</a>s (NGOs), including <a href="Conservation%20International">Conservation International</a> (CI), the <a href="Wildlife%20Conservation%20Society">Wildlife Conservation Society</a> (WCS), and the <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">World Wide Fund for Nature</a> (WWF). Most lemur species are covered by this network of protected areas, and a few species can be found in multiple parks or reserves.

Conservation is also facilitated by the <a href="Madagascar%20Fauna%20Group">Madagascar Fauna Group</a> (MFG), an association of nearly 40 zoos and related organizations, including the Duke Lemur Center, the <a href="Durrell%20Wildlife%20Conservation%20Trust">Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust</a>, and the <a href="Saint%20Louis%20Zoological%20Park">Saint Louis Zoological Park</a>. This international NGO supports Madagascar's <a href="Parc%20Ivoloina">Parc Ivoloina</a>, helps protect <a href="Betampona%20Reserve">Betampona Reserve</a> and other protected areas, and promotes field research, breeding programs, conservation planning, and education in zoos. One of their major projects involved the release of captive black-and-white ruffed lemurs, designed to help restock the dwindling population within Betampona Reserve.
<a href="Habitat%20corridor">Habitat corridor</a>s are needed for linking these protected areas so that small populations are not isolated. In in <a href="Durban">Durban</a>, South Africa, Madagascar's former president <a href="Marc%20Ravalomanana">Marc Ravalomanana</a> promised to triple the size of the island's protected areas in five years. This became known as the "Durban Vision". In June 2007, the <a href="World%20Heritage%20Committee">World Heritage Committee</a> included a sizable portion of Madagascar's eastern rainforests as a new <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>.

Debt relief may help Madagascar protect its biodiversity. With the <a href="2009%20Malagasy%20political%20crisis">political crisis</a> in 2009, <a href="Illegal%20logging%20in%20Madagascar">illegal logging</a> has proliferated and now threatens rainforests in the northeast, including its lemur inhabitants and the ecotourism that the local communities rely upon.

Captive lemur populations are maintained locally and outside of Madagascar in many zoos, although the diversity of species is limited. Sikafas, for instance, do not survive well in captivity, so few facilities have them. The largest captive lemur population can be found at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC), whose mission includes non-invasive research, conservation (e.g. <a href="captive%20breeding">captive breeding</a>), and public education. Another large lemur colony the Myakka City Lemur Reserve run by the <a href="Lemur%20Conservation%20Foundation">Lemur Conservation Foundation</a> (LCF), which also hosts lemur research. In Madagascar, <a href="Lemurs%27%20Park">Lemurs' Park</a> is a free-range, private facility southwest of <a href="Antananarivo">Antananarivo</a> that exhibits lemurs for the public while also rehabilitating captive-born lemurs for <a href="reintroduction">reintroduction</a> into the wild.
In Malagasy culture lemurs, and animals in general, have <a href="soul">soul</a>s ("ambiroa") which can get revenge if mocked while alive or if killed in a cruel fashion. Because of this, lemurs, like many other elements of daily life, have been a source of <a href="taboo">taboo</a>s, known locally as "fady", which can be based around stories with four basic principles. A village or region may believe that a certain type of lemur may be the <a href="ancestor">ancestor</a> of the clan. They may also believe that a lemur's spirit may get revenge. Alternatively, the animal may appear as a benefactor. Lemurs are also thought to impart their qualities, good or bad, onto human babies. In general, "fady" extend beyond a sense of the forbidden, but can include events that bring bad luck.
One example of lemur "fady" told around 1970 comes from <a href="Ambatofinandrahana">Ambatofinandrahana</a> in the <a href="Fianarantsoa%20Province">Fianarantsoa Province</a>. According to the account, a man brought a lemur home in a trap, but alive. His children wanted to keep the lemur as a pet, but when the father told them it was not a domestic animal, the children asked to kill it. After the children tortured the lemur, it eventually died and was eaten. A short time later, all the children died of illness. As a result, the father declared that anyone who tortures lemurs for fun shall "be destroyed and have no descendants."

"Fady" can not only help protect lemurs and their forests under stable <a href="socioeconomics">socioeconomic situations</a>, but they can also lead to discrimination and persecution if a lemur is known to bring bad fortune, for instance, if it walks through town. In other ways, "fady" does not protect all lemurs equally. For example, although the hunting and eating of certain species may be taboo, other species may not share that same protection and are therefore targeted instead. "Fady" can vary from village to village within the same region. If people move to a new village or region, their "fady" may not apply to the lemur species that are locally present, making them available for consumption. "Fady" restrictions on lemur meat can be relaxed in times of famine and drought.

The aye-aye is almost universally viewed unfavorably across Madagascar, though the tales vary from village to village and region to region. If people see an aye-aye, they may kill it and hang the corpse on a pole near a road outside of town (so others can carry the bad fortunes away) or burn their village and move. The superstitions behind aye-aye "fady" include beliefs that they kill and eat chickens or people, that they kill people in their sleep by cutting their aortic vein, that they embody ancestral spirits, or that they warn of illness, death, or bad luck in the family. As of 1970, the people of the <a href="Marolambo">Marolambo</a> District in the <a href="Toamasina%20Province">Toamasina Province</a> feared the aye-aye because they believed it had supernatural powers. Because of this, no one was allowed to mock, kill, or eat one.

There are also widespread "fady" about indri and sifakas. They are often protected from hunting and consumption because of their resemblance to humans and their ancestors, mostly due to their large size and upright or <a href="orthograde%20posture">orthograde posture</a>. The resemblance is even stronger for indri, which lack the long tail of most living lemurs. Known locally as "babakoto" ("Ancestor of Man"), the indri is sometimes seen as the progenitor of the family or clan. There are also stories of an indri that helped a human down from a tree, so they are seen as benefactors. Other lemur "fady" include the belief that a wife will have ugly children if her husband kills a <a href="woolly%20lemur">woolly lemur</a>, or that if a pregnant woman eats a dwarf lemur, her baby will get its beautiful, round eyes.

Lemurs have also become popular in <a href="Western%20culture">Western culture</a> in recent years. The original 2005 animated film "<a href="Madagascar%20%282005%20film%29">Madagascar</a>" was seen by an estimated 100 million people in theaters and 200–300 million people on DVD worldwide. Prior to this movie, "<a href="Zoboomafoo">Zoboomafoo</a>", a <a href="Public%20Broadcasting%20Service">Public Broadcasting Service</a> (PBS) children's television series from 1999 to 2001, helped to popularize sifakas by featuring a live <a href="Coquerel%27s%20sifaka">Coquerel's sifaka</a> from the Duke Lemur Center as well as a puppet. A twenty-episode series called "Lemur Kingdom" (in the United States) or "<a href="Lemur%20Street">Lemur Street</a>" (in the United Kingdom and Canada) aired in 2008 on <a href="Animal%20Planet">Animal Planet</a>. It combined the typical animal <a href="documentary%20film">documentary</a> with <a href="dramatic%20programming">dramatic narration</a> to tell the story of two groups of ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve.

Vijayanagara Empire

The Vijayanagara Empire (also called Karnata Empire, and the Kingdom of Bisnegar by the <a href="Portuguese%20India">Portuguese</a>) was based in the <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan Plateau</a> region in <a href="South%20India">South India</a>. It was established in 1336 by <a href="Harihara%20I">Harihara I</a> and his brother <a href="Bukka%20Raya%20I">Bukka Raya I</a> of <a href="Sangama%20Dynasty">Sangama Dynasty</a>. The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off <a href="Islamic%20invasions%20of%20India">Islamic invasions</a> by the end of the 13th century. It lasted until 1646, although its power declined after a major military defeat in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Talikota">Battle of Talikota</a> in 1565 by the combined armies of the <a href="Deccan%20sultanates">Deccan sultanates</a>. The empire is named after its capital city of <a href="Vijayanagara">Vijayanagara</a>, whose ruins surround present day <a href="Hampi">Hampi</a>, now a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> in <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>, <a href="India">India</a>. The writings of medieval European travelers such as <a href="Domingo%20Paes">Domingo Paes</a>, <a href="Fern%C3%A3o%20Nunes">Fernão Nunes</a>, and <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Da%20Conti">Niccolò Da Conti</a>, and the literature in local languages provide crucial information about its history. Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire's power and wealth.

The empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at <a href="Hampi">Hampi</a>. Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the <a href="Vijayanagara%20Architecture">Vijayanagara Architecture</a> style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> temples' construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in <a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada</a>, <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a>, <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a>, and <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, while <a href="Carnatic%20music">Carnatic music</a> evolved into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> as a unifying factor.

"Karnata Rajya" (Karnata Empire) was another name for the Vijayanagara Empire, used in some inscriptions and literary works of the Vijayanagara times including the Sanskrit work "Jambavati Kalyanam" by King <a href="Krishnadevaraya">Krishnadevaraya</a> and Telugu work "Vasu Charitamu".

Differing theories have been proposed regarding the origins of the Vijayanagara empire. Many historians propose that <a href="Harihara%20I">Harihara I</a> and <a href="Bukka%20I">Bukka I</a>, the founders of the empire, were <a href="Kannadiga">Kannadiga</a>s and commanders in the army of the <a href="Hoysala%20Empire">Hoysala Empire</a> stationed in the <a href="Tungabhadra">Tungabhadra</a> region to ward off Muslim invasions from the Northern India. Others claim that they were Telugu people, first associated with the <a href="Kakatiya%20dynasty">Kakatiya Kingdom</a>, who took control of the northern parts of the <a href="Hoysala%20Empire">Hoysala Empire</a> during its decline. Irrespective of their origin, historians agree the founders were supported and inspired by <a href="Vidyaranya">Vidyaranya</a>, a saint at the <a href="Sringeri">Sringeri</a> monastery to fight the Muslim invasion of South India. Writings by foreign travelers during the late medieval era combined with recent excavations in the Vijayanagara principality have uncovered much-needed information about the empire's history, fortifications, scientific developments and architectural innovations.

Before the early 14th-century rise of the Vijayanagara Empire, the Hindu states of the Deccan – the <a href="Seuna%20Yadavas%20of%20Devagiri">Yadava Empire</a> of Devagiri, the <a href="Kakatiya%20dynasty">Kakatiya dynasty</a> of <a href="Warangal">Warangal</a>, the <a href="Pandyan%20Empire">Pandyan Empire</a> of <a href="Madurai">Madurai</a> had been repeatedly raided and attacked by <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s from the north, and by 1336 these upper Deccan region (modern day Maharashtra, Telangana) had all been defeated by armies of Sultan <a href="Alauddin%20Khalji">Alauddin Khalji</a> and <a href="Muhammad%20bin%20Tughluq">Muhammad bin Tughluq</a> of the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a>.

Further south in the Deccan region, a Hoysala commander, Singeya Nayaka-III (1280–1300 AD) declared independence after the Muslim forces of the Delhi Sultanate defeated and captured the territories of the <a href="Seuna%20Yadavas%20of%20Devagiri">Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri</a> in 1294 CE. He created the <a href="Kampili%20kingdom">Kampili kingdom</a>, but this was a short lived kingdom during this period of wars. Kampili existed near <a href="Gulbarga">Gulbarga</a> and <a href="Tungabhadra">Tungabhadra</a> river in northeastern parts of the present-day <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> state. It ended after a defeat by the armies of <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a>. The triumphant army led by Malik Zada sent the news of its victory, over Kampili kingdom, to Muhammad bin Tughluq in Delhi by sending a straw-stuffed severed head of the dead Hindu king. Within Kampili, on the day of certain defeat, the populace committed a "<a href="jauhar">jauhar</a>" (ritual mass suicide) in 1327/28 CE. Eight years later, from the ruins of the Kampili kingdom emerged the Vijayanagara Kingdom in 1336 CE.

In the first two decades after the founding of the empire, Harihara I gained control over most of the area south of the Tungabhadra river and earned the title of "Purvapaschima Samudradhishavara" ("master of the eastern and western seas"). By 1374 Bukka Raya I, successor to Harihara I, had defeated the chiefdom of <a href="Arcot">Arcot</a>, the <a href="Reddy">Reddy</a>s of Kondavidu, and the <a href="Madurai%20Sultanate">Sultan of Madurai</a> and had gained control over <a href="Goa">Goa</a> in the west and the Tungabhadra-<a href="Krishna%20River">Krishna River</a> <a href="doab">doab</a> in the north. The original capital was in the <a href="principality">principality</a> of <a href="Anegondi">Anegondi</a> on the northern banks of the Tungabhadra River in today's <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>. It was later moved to nearby Vijayanagara on the river's southern banks during the reign of Bukka Raya I, because it was easier to defend against the Muslim armies persistently attacking it from the northern lands.

With the Vijayanagara Kingdom now imperial in stature, <a href="Harihara%20II">Harihara II</a>, the second son of Bukka Raya I, further consolidated the kingdom beyond the <a href="Krishna%20River">Krishna River</a> and brought the whole of South India under the Vijayanagara umbrella. The next ruler, <a href="Deva%20Raya%20I">Deva Raya I</a>, emerged successful against the <a href="Gajapatis">Gajapatis</a> of <a href="Odisha">Odisha</a> and undertook important works of fortification and irrigation. Italian traveler Niccolo de Conti wrote of him as the most powerful ruler of India. <a href="Deva%20Raya%20II">Deva Raya II</a> (called "Gajabetekara") succeeded to the throne in 1424 and was possibly the most capable of the <a href="Sangama%20Dynasty">Sangama Dynasty</a> rulers. He quelled rebelling feudal lords as well as the <a href="Zamorin">Zamorin</a> of <a href="History%20of%20Kozhikode">Calicut</a> and <a href="Quilon">Quilon</a> in the south. He invaded the island of <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> and became overlord of the kings of <a href="Burma">Burma</a> at <a href="Pegu">Pegu</a> and <a href="Tanintharyi%20Division">Tanasserim</a>.
Firuz Bahmani of <a href="Bahmani%20Sultanate">Bahmani Sultanate</a> entered into a treaty with Deva Raya I of Vijayanagara in 1407 that required the latter to pay Bahmani an annual tribute of "100,000 huns, five maunds of pearls and fifty elephants". The Sultanate invaded Vijayanagara in 1417 when the latter defaulted in paying the tribute. Such wars for tribute payment by Vijayanagara repeated in the 15th century, such as in 1436 when Sultan Ahmad I launched a war to collect the unpaid tribute.

The ensuing Sultanates-Vijayanagara wars expanded the Vijayanagara military, its power and disputes between its military commanders. In 1485, Saluva Narasimha led a coup and ended the dynastic rule, while continuing to defend the Empire from raids by the Sultanates created from the continuing disintegration of the Bahmani Sultanate in its north. In 1505, another commander Tuluva Narasa Nayaka took over the Vijayanagara rule from the Sulava descendant in a coup. The empire came under the rule of <a href="Krishnadevaraya">Krishna Deva Raya</a> in 1509, the son of Tuluva Narasa Nayaka. He strengthened and consolidated the reach of the empire, by hiring both Hindus and Muslims into his army. In the following decades, it covered Southern India and successfully defeated invasions from the five established <a href="Deccan%20Sultanates">Deccan Sultanates</a> to its north.

The empire reached its peak during the rule of Krishna Deva Raya when Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious. The empire gained territory formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan and the territories in the eastern Deccan, including <a href="Kalinga%20%28historical%20region%29">Kalinga</a>, in addition to the already established presence in the south. Many important monuments were either completed or commissioned during the time of Krishna Deva Raya.
Krishna Deva Raya was followed by his younger half-brother <a href="Achyuta%20Deva%20Raya">Achyuta Deva Raya</a> in 1529. When Achyuta Deva Raya died in 1542, <a href="Sadashiva%20Raya">Sadashiva Raya</a>, the teenage nephew of Achyuta Raya was appointed king with the caretaker being Aliya Rama Raya, Krishna Deva Raya's son-in-law and someone who had previously served Sultan <a href="Quli%20Qutb%20Mulk">Quli Qutb al-Mulk</a> from 1512 when al-Mulk was assigned to Golkonda sultanate. Aliya Rama Raya left the Golconda Sultanate, married Deva Raya's daughter, and thus rose to power. When Sadashiva Raya – Deva Raya's son – was old enough, Aliya Rama Raya imprisoned him and allowed his uncle Achyuta Raya to publicly appear once a year. Further Aliya Rama Raya hired Muslim generals in his army from his previous Sultanate connections, and called himself "Sultan of the World".
The Sultanates to the north of Vijayanagara united and attacked Aliya Rama Raya's army, in January 1565, in a war known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Talikota">Battle of Talikota</a>. The Vijayanagara side was winning the war, state Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund, but suddenly two Muslim generals of the Vijayanagara army switched sides and turned their loyalty to the Sultanates. The generals captured Aliya Rama Raya and beheaded him on the spot, with Sultan Hussain on the Sultanates side joining them for the execution and stuffing of severed head with straw for display. The beheading of Aliya Rama Raya created confusion and havoc in the still loyal portions of the Vijayanagara army, which were then completely routed. The Sultanates' army plundered Hampi and reduced it to the ruinous state in which it remains; it was never re-occupied.

After the death of Aliya Rama Raya in the Battle of Talikota, <a href="Tirumala%20Deva%20Raya">Tirumala Deva Raya</a> started the Aravidu dynasty, moved and founded a new capital of Penukonda to replace the destroyed Hampi, and attempted to reconstitute the remains of Vijayanagara Empire. Tirumala abdicated in 1572, dividing the remains of his kingdom to his three sons, and pursued a religious life until his death in 1578. The Aravidu dynasty successors ruled the region but the empire collapsed in 1614, and the final remains ended in 1646, from continued wars with the Bijapur sultanate and others. During this period, more kingdoms in South India became independent and separate from Vijayanagara. These include the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Mysore">Mysore Kingdom</a>, <a href="Keladi%20Nayaka">Keladi Nayaka</a>, <a href="Madurai%20Nayak%20Dynasty">Nayaks of Madurai</a>, <a href="Thanjavur%20Nayaks">Nayaks of Tanjore</a>, <a href="Nayakas%20of%20Chitradurga">Nayakas of Chitradurga</a> and <a href="Nayaks%20of%20Gingee">Nayak Kingdom of Gingee</a> – all of which declared independence and went on to have a significant impact on the history of South India in the coming centuries.

The rulers of the Vijayanagara empire maintained the well-functioning administrative methods developed by their predecessors, the Hoysala, Kakatiya and Pandya kingdoms, to govern their territories and made changes only where necessary. The King was the ultimate authority, assisted by a cabinet of ministers ("Pradhana") headed by the prime minister ("Mahapradhana"). Other important titles recorded were the chief secretary ("Karyakartha" or "Rayaswami") and the imperial officers ("Adhikari"). All high-ranking ministers and officers were required to have military training. A secretariat near the king's palace employed <a href="scribes">scribes</a> and officers to maintain records made official by using a <a href="wax%20seal">wax seal</a> imprinted with the ring of the king. At the lower administrative levels, wealthy feudal landlords ("Goudas") supervised accountants ("Karanikas" or "Karnam") and guards ("Kavalu"). The palace administration was divided into 72 departments ("Niyogas"), each having several female attendants chosen for their youth and beauty (some imported or captured in victorious battles) who were trained to handle minor administrative matters and to serve men of nobility as courtesans or concubines.
The empire was divided into five main provinces ("Rajya"), each under a commander ("Dandanayaka" or "Dandanatha") and headed by a governor, often from the royal family, who used the native language for administrative purposes. A "Rajya" was divided into regions ("Vishaya" "Vente" or "Kottam") and further divided into counties ("Sime" or "Nadu"), themselves subdivided into municipalities ("Kampana" or "Sthala"). Hereditary families ruled their respective territories and paid tribute to the empire, while some areas, such as <a href="Keladi%20%28India%29">Keladi</a> and <a href="Madurai">Madurai</a>, came under the direct supervision of a commander.

On the battlefield, the king's commanders led the troops. The empire's war strategy rarely involved massive invasions; more often it employed small scale methods such as attacking and destroying individual forts. The empire was among the first in India to use long range <a href="artillery">artillery</a> commonly manned by foreign gunners (those from present day <a href="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a> were considered the best). Army troops were of two types: The king's personal army directly recruited by the empire and the feudal army under each feudatory. King Krishnadevaraya's personal army consisted of 100,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalrymen and over 900 elephants. This number was only a part of the army numbering over 1.1 million soldiers, a figure that varied as an army of two million has also been recorded along with the existence of a navy as evidenced by the use of the term "Navigadaprabhu" (commander of the navy). The army recruited from all classes of society (supported by the collection of additional feudal tributes from feudatory rulers), and consisted of <a href="Archery">archers</a> and <a href="musket">musket</a>eers wearing quilted <a href="tunic">tunic</a>s, shieldmen with swords and <a href="poignard">poignard</a>s in their girdles, and soldiers carrying shields so large that no armour was necessary. The horses and elephants were fully armoured and the elephants had knives fastened to their tusks to do maximum damage in battle.

The capital city was completely dependent on the water supply systems constructed to channel and store water, ensuring a consistent supply throughout the year. The remains of these hydraulic systems have given historians a picture of the prevailing <a href="surface-water%20hydrology">surface water</a> distribution methods in use at that time in the semiarid regions of South India. Contemporary records and notes of foreign travelers describe how huge tanks were constructed by labourers. Excavations have uncovered the remains of a well-connected water distribution system existing solely within the royal enclosure and the large temple complexes (suggesting it was for the exclusive use of royalty, and for special ceremonies) with sophisticated channels using gravity and <a href="siphon">siphon</a>s to <a href="Water%20transportation">transport water</a> through <a href="Pipeline%20transport">pipelines</a>. The only structures resembling public waterworks are the remains of large water tanks that collected the seasonal monsoon water and then dried up in summer except for the few fed by springs. In the fertile agricultural areas near the <a href="Tungabhadra%20River">Tungabhadra River</a>, canals were dug to guide the river water into <a href="irrigation%20tank">irrigation tank</a>s. These canals had <a href="sluice">sluice</a>s that were opened and closed to control the water flow. In other areas the administration encouraged the digging of wells monitored by administrative authorities. Large tanks in the capital city were constructed with royal patronage while smaller tanks were funded by wealthy individuals to gain social and religious merit.

The economy of the empire was largely dependent on agriculture. Sorghum ("jowar"), cotton, and <a href="Pulse%20%28legume%29">pulse legumes</a> grew in semi-arid regions, while <a href="sugarcane">sugarcane</a>, <a href="rice">rice</a>, and <a href="wheat">wheat</a> thrived in rainy areas. <a href="Betel">Betel leaves</a>, <a href="areca">areca</a> (for chewing), and coconut were the principal cash crops, and large-scale cotton production supplied the weaving centers of the empire's vibrant textile industry. Spices such as <a href="turmeric">turmeric</a>, pepper, <a href="cardamom">cardamom</a>, and ginger grew in the remote <a href="Malnad">Malnad</a> hill region and were transported to the city for trade. The empire's capital city was a thriving business centre that included a burgeoning market in large quantities of precious gems and gold. Prolific temple-building provided employment to thousands of <a href="stone%20masonry">masons</a>, <a href="sculpture">sculptors</a>, and other skilled artisans.

Land ownership was important. Most of the growers were <a href="tenant%20farmer">tenant farmer</a>s and were given the right of part ownership of the land over time. Tax policies encouraging needed produce made distinctions between land use to determine tax levies. For example, the daily market availability of rose petals was important for perfumers, so cultivation of roses received a lower tax assessment. Salt production and the manufacture of <a href="Salt%20pan%20%28evaporation%29">salt pans</a> were controlled by similar means. The making of <a href="ghee">ghee</a> (clarified butter), which was sold as an oil for human consumption and as a fuel for lighting lamps, was profitable. Exports to China intensified and included cotton, spices, jewels, <a href="semi-precious%20stone">semi-precious stone</a>s, ivory, rhino horn, <a href="ebony">ebony</a>, <a href="amber">amber</a>, coral, and aromatic products such as perfumes. Large vessels from China made frequent visits, some captained by the Chinese Admiral <a href="Zheng%20He">Zheng He</a>, and brought Chinese products to the empire's 300 ports, large and small, on the <a href="Arabian%20Sea">Arabian Sea</a> and the <a href="Bay%20of%20Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a>. The ports of <a href="Mangalore">Mangalore</a>, <a href="Honavar">Honavar</a>, <a href="Bhatkal">Bhatkal</a>, <a href="Barkur">Barkur</a>, <a href="Cochin">Cochin</a>, <a href="Kannur">Cannanore</a>, <a href="Machilipatnam">Machilipatnam</a>, and <a href="Dharmadam">Dharmadam</a> were the most important.

When merchant ships docked, the merchandise was taken into official custody and taxes levied on all items sold. The security of the merchandise was guaranteed by the administration officials. Traders of many nationalities (<a href="Arabs">Arabs</a>, <a href="Persian%20people">Persians</a>, <a href="Gujar%20Khan">Guzerates</a>, <a href="Greater%20Khorasan">Khorassanians</a>) settled in <a href="Kozhikode">Calicut</a>, drawn by the thriving trade business. Ship building prospered and <a href="keel">keel</a>ed ships of 1000–1200 "bahares" (<a href="Tonnage">burden</a>) were built without decks by sewing the entire <a href="Hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> with ropes rather than fastening them with nails. Ships sailed to the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a> ports of <a href="Aden">Aden</a> and <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a> with Vijayanagara goods sold as far away as <a href="Venice">Venice</a>. The empire's principal exports were pepper, <a href="ginger">ginger</a>, <a href="cinnamon">cinnamon</a>, <a href="cardamom">cardamom</a>, <a href="Cherry%20plum">myrobalan</a>, <a href="Tamarind">tamarind timber</a>, <a href="Golden%20Shower%20Tree">anafistula</a>, precious and semi-precious stones, pearls, <a href="musk">musk</a>, <a href="ambergris">ambergris</a>, <a href="rhubarb">rhubarb</a>, <a href="aloe">aloe</a>, cotton cloth and <a href="porcelain">porcelain</a>. Cotton yarn was shipped to <a href="Burma">Burma</a> and indigo to Persia. Chief imports from <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a> were <a href="copper">copper</a>, quicksilver (<a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>), <a href="vermilion">vermilion</a>, coral, <a href="saffron">saffron</a>, coloured velvets, <a href="rose%20water">rose water</a>, knives, coloured <a href="camlet">camlet</a>s, gold and silver. <a href="Persia">Persia</a>n horses were imported to Cannanore before a two-week land trip to the capital. <a href="Silk">Silk</a> arrived from China and sugar from <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a>.

East coast trade hummed, with goods arriving from <a href="Golkonda">Golkonda</a> where rice, <a href="millet">millet</a>, <a href="pulses">pulses</a> and tobacco were grown on a large scale. Dye crops of <a href="indigo">indigo</a> and <a href="chay%20root">chay root</a> were produced for the weaving industry. A mineral rich region, <a href="Machilipatnam">Machilipatnam</a> was the gateway for high quality iron and steel exports. Diamond mining was active in the Kollur region. The cotton weaving industry produced two types of cottons, plain <a href="Calico%20%28fabric%29">calico</a> and <a href="muslin">muslin</a> (brown, bleached or dyed). Cloth printed with coloured patterns crafted by native techniques were exported to <a href="Java">Java</a> and the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>. Golkonda specialised in plain cotton and <a href="Pulicat">Pulicat</a> in printed. The main imports on the east coast were <a href="non-ferrous%20metal">non-ferrous metal</a>s, <a href="camphor">camphor</a>, <a href="porcelain">porcelain</a>, silk and luxury goods.

Most information on the social life in Vijayanagara empire comes from the writings of foreign visitors and evidence that research teams in the Vijayanagara area have uncovered. The <a href="Hindu%20caste%20system">Hindu caste system</a> was prevalent and rigidly followed, with each caste represented by a local body of elders who represented the community. These elders set the rules and regulations that were implemented with the help of royal decrees. <a href="Untouchability">Untouchability</a> was part of the caste system and these communities were represented by leaders ("Kaivadadavaru"). The Muslim communities were represented by their own group in coastal Karnataka. The caste system did not, however, prevent distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high-ranking cadre in the army and administration. In civil life, by virtue of the caste system, <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a>s enjoyed a high level of respect. With the exception of a few who took to military careers, most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters. Their separation from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters, and their presence in every town and village was a calculated investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order. However, the popularity of low-caste scholars (such as <a href="Molla%20%28poet%29">Molla</a> and <a href="Kanakadasa">Kanakadasa</a>) and their works (including those of <a href="Vemana">Vemana</a> and <a href="Sarvajna">Sarvajna</a>) is an indication of the degree of social fluidity in the society.

<a href="Sati%20%28practice%29">Sati</a>, the practice where a widow would immolate herself with her dead husband's body, is evidenced in Vijayanagara ruins. About fifty inscriptions have been discovered in Vijayanagara which are called "Satikal" (Sati stone) or "Sati-virakal" (Sati <a href="hero%20stone">hero stone</a>). According to Ashis Nandy, the Vijayanagara practice was an example of an "epidemic" of sati practice just like Rajput kingdoms under attack by <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal</a> armies, attributing the practice to foreign intrusions from the persistent wars between Muslim sultanates and the Hindu kingdom, in contrast to others who question the evidence. According to scholars such as John Hawley, "the evidence about the extent of the custom and about the classes that practiced it is far from clear, since most accounts come from Muslim chroniclers or European travelers" who did not have means and objectivity to report about the practice or its circumstances accurately.

The socio-religious movements of the previous centuries, such as <a href="Lingayatism">Lingayatism</a>, provided momentum for flexible social norms to which women were expected to abide. By this time <a href="South%20India">South India</a>n women had crossed most barriers and were actively involved in matters hitherto considered the monopoly of men, such as administration, business, and trade, and involvement in the fine arts. <a href="Tirumalamba">Tirumalamba Devi</a> who wrote "Varadambika Parinayam" and <a href="Gangadevi">Gangadevi</a> who wrote "Madhuravijayam" were among the notable women poets of the era. Early Telugu women poets like <a href="Timmakka">Tallapaka Timmakka</a> and <a href="Molla%20%28poet%29">Atukuri Molla</a> became popular during this period. The court of the <a href="Nayaks%20of%20Tanjore">Nayaks of Tanjore</a> is known to have patronised several women poets. The <a href="Devadasi%20system">Devadasi system</a> existed, as well as legalised prostitution relegated to a few streets in each city. The popularity of <a href="harem">harem</a>s amongst men of the royalty is well known from records.

Well-to-do men wore the "Petha" or "Kulavi", a tall <a href="turban">turban</a> made of silk and decorated with gold. As in most Indian societies, jewellery was used by men and women and records describe the use of <a href="anklet">anklet</a>s, bracelets, finger-rings, necklaces and ear rings of various types. During celebrations, men and women adorned themselves with flower garlands and used perfumes made of <a href="rose%20water">rose water</a>, <a href="civetone">civet musk</a>, <a href="musk">musk</a> or <a href="sandalwood">sandalwood</a>. In stark contrast to the commoners whose lives were modest, the lives of the empire's kings and queens were full of ceremonial pomp in the court. Queens and princesses had numerous attendants who were lavishly dressed and adorned with fine jewellery, their daily duties being light.

Physical exercises were popular with men and wrestling was an important male preoccupation for sport and entertainment. Even women wrestlers are mentioned in records. <a href="Gym">Gym</a>nasiums have been discovered inside royal quarters and records speak of regular physical training for commanders and their armies during peacetime. Royal palaces and market places had special arenas where royalty and common people alike amused themselves by watching matches such as <a href="cock%20fight">cock fight</a>s, <a href="ram%20fight">ram fight</a>s and wrestling between women. Excavations within the Vijayanagara city limits have revealed the existence of various types of community-based activities in the form of engravings on boulders, rock platforms and temple floors, implying these were places of casual social interaction. Some of these games are in use today and others are yet to be identified.

The Vijayanagara kings were tolerant of all religions and sects, as writings by foreign visitors show. The kings used titles such as "Gobrahamana Pratipalanacharya" ("literally", "protector of cows and Brahmins") and "Hindurayasuratrana" ("lit", "upholder of Hindu faith") that testified to their intention of protecting Hinduism and yet were at the same time staunchly Islamicate in their court ceremonials and dress. The empire's founders, Harihara I and Bukka Raya I, were devout <a href="Shaiva">Shaiva</a>s (worshippers of <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a>), but made grants to the <a href="Vaishnava">Vaishnava</a> order of <a href="Sringeri">Sringeri</a> with <a href="Vidyaranya">Vidyaranya</a> as their patron saint, and designated "<a href="Varaha">Varaha</a>" (the boar, an <a href="Avatar">Avatar</a> of <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>) as their <a href="emblem">emblem</a>. Over one-fourth of the archaeological dig found an "Islamic Quarter" not far from the "Royal Quarter". Nobles from Central Asia's Timurid kingdoms also came to Vijayanagara. The later <a href="Saluva">Saluva</a> and <a href="Tuluva">Tuluva</a> kings were Vaishnava by faith, but worshipped at the feet of Lord Virupaksha (Shiva) at Hampi as well as Lord <a href="Venkateshwara">Venkateshwara</a> (Vishnu) at <a href="Tirumala%20Venkateswara%20Temple">Tirupati</a>. A Sanskrit work, "Jambavati Kalyanam" by King Krishnadevaraya, called Lord Virupaksha "Karnata Rajya Raksha Mani" ("protective jewel of Karnata Empire"). The kings patronised the saints of the <a href="dvaita">dvaita</a> order (philosophy of dualism) of <a href="Madhvacharya">Madhvacharya</a> at <a href="Udupi">Udupi</a>.

The <a href="Bhakti">Bhakti</a> (devotional) movement was active during this time, and involved well known <a href="Haridasa">Haridasa</a>s (devotee saints) of that time. Like the <a href="Virashaiva">Virashaiva</a> movement of the 12th century, this movement presented another strong current of devotion, pervading the lives of millions. The haridasas represented two groups, the "<a href="Vyasakuta">Vyasakuta</a>" and "<a href="Dasakuta">Dasakuta</a>", the former being required to be proficient in the <a href="Vedas">Vedas</a>, <a href="Upanishads">Upanishads</a> and other <a href="Darshanas">Darshanas</a>, while the "Dasakuta" merely conveyed the message of Madhvacharya through the Kannada language to the people in the form of devotional songs ("Devaranamas" and "Kirthanas"). The philosophy of Madhvacharya was spread by eminent disciples such as <a href="Naraharitirtha">Naraharitirtha</a>, <a href="Jayatirtha">Jayatirtha</a>, <a href="Sripadaraya">Sripadaraya</a>, <a href="Vyasatirtha">Vyasatirtha</a>, <a href="Vadirajatirtha">Vadirajatirtha</a> and others. Vyasatirtha, the "guru" (teacher) of Vadirajatirtha, <a href="Purandaradasa">Purandaradasa</a> (Father of Carnatic music) and <a href="Kanakadasa">Kanakadasa</a> earned the devotion of King Krishnadevaraya. The king considered the saint his "Kuladevata" (family deity) and honoured him in his writings. During this time, another great composer of early carnatic music, <a href="Annamacharya">Annamacharya</a> composed hundreds of "Kirthanas" in <a href="Telugu%20Language">Telugu</a> at <a href="Tirumala%20-%20Tirupati">Tirupati</a> in present-day <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>.

The defeat of the <a href="Jain">Jain</a> <a href="Western%20Ganga%20Dynasty">Western Ganga Dynasty</a> by the Cholas in the early 11th century and the rising numbers of followers of Vaishnava Hinduism and Virashaivism in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in Jainism. Two notable locations of Jain worship in the Vijayanagara territory were <a href="Shravanabelagola">Shravanabelagola</a> and <a href="Kambadahalli">Kambadahalli</a>.

<a href="Islamic">Islamic</a> contact with South India began as early as the 7th century, a result of trade between the Southern kingdoms and <a href="Arab">Arab</a> lands. <a href="Jumu%27ah">Jumma</a> <a href="Masjid">Masjid</a>s existed in the Rashtrakuta empire by the 10th century and many mosques flourished on the <a href="Malabar%20coast">Malabar coast</a> by the early 14th century. Muslim settlers married local women; their children were known as Mappillas ("Moplahs") and were actively involved in <a href="horse%20trading">horse trading</a> and manning shipping fleets. The interactions between the Vijayanagara empire and the Bahamani Sultanates to the north increased the presence of Muslims in the south. The introduction of <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> began as early as the 8th century as shown by the finding of <a href="Indian%20copper%20plate%20inscriptions">copper plates</a> inscribed with land grants to Malabar Christians. Christian travelers wrote of the scarcity of Christians in South India in the Middle Ages, promoting its attractiveness to missionaries. The arrival of the <a href="Portuguese%20people">Portuguese</a> in the 15th century and their connections through trade with the empire, the propagation of the faith by <a href="Francis%20Xavier">Saint Xavier</a> (1545) and later the presence of <a href="Dutch%20%28ethnic%20group%29">Dutch</a> settlements fostered the growth of Christianity in the south.

<a href="Kannada">Kannada</a>, <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a> and <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> were used in their respective regions of the empire. Over 7000 inscriptions ("Shilashasana") including 300 copper plate inscriptions ("Tamarashasana") have been recovered, almost half of which are in Kannada, the remaining in Telugu, Tamil and <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>. Bilingual inscriptions had lost favour by the 14th century. The empire minted coins at Hampi, <a href="Penugonda">Penugonda</a> and <a href="Tirupati">Tirupati</a> with <a href="Devanagari">Nagari</a>, Kannada and Telugu legends usually carrying the name of the ruler. Gold, silver and copper were used to issue coins called "Gadyana", "Varaha", "Pon", "Pagoda", "Pratapa", "Pana", "Kasu" and "Jital". The coins contained the images of various gods including Balakrishna (infant Krishna), <a href="Venkateshwara">Venkateshwara</a> (the presiding deity of the temple at Tirupati), goddesses such as <a href="Bhudevi">Bhudevi</a> and Sridevi, divine couples, animals such as bulls and elephants and birds. The earliest coins feature <a href="Hanuman">Hanuman</a> and <a href="Garuda">Garuda</a> (divine eagle), the vehicle of Lord Vishnu.

Kannada and Telugu inscriptions have been deciphered and recorded by historians of the <a href="Archaeological%20Survey%20of%20India">Archaeological Survey of India</a>.

During the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire, poets, scholars and philosophers wrote primarily in Kannada, Telugu and Sanskrit, and also in other regional languages such as Tamil and covered such subjects as religion, biography, "Prabandha" (fiction), music, grammar, poetry, medicine and mathematics. The administrative and court languages of the Empire were Kannada and Telugu—the latter was the court language and gained even more cultural prominence during the reign of the last Vijayanagara kings. Telugu was a popular literary medium, reaching its peak under the patronage of <a href="Krishnadevaraya">Krishnadevaraya</a>.

Most <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> works were commentaries either on the <a href="Vedas">Vedas</a> or on the <a href="Ramayana">Ramayana</a> and <a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> epics, written by well known figures such as <a href="Sayana">Sayana</a> and Vidyaranya that extolled the superiority of the <a href="Advaita">Advaita</a> philosophy over other rival Hindu philosophies. Other writers were famous <a href="Dvaita">Dvaita</a> saints of the <a href="Udupi">Udupi</a> order such as Jayatirtha (earning the title "Tikacharya" for his polemicial writings), Vyasatirtha who wrote rebuttals to the Advaita philosophy and of the conclusions of earlier logicians, and Vadirajatirtha and Sripadaraya both of whom criticised the beliefs of <a href="Adi%20Sankara">Adi Sankara</a>. Apart from these saints, noted Sanskrit scholars adorned the courts of the Vijayanagara kings and their feudal chiefs. Some members of the royal family were writers of merit and authored important works such as "Jambavati Kalyana" by King Krishnadevaraya, and "<a href="Madura%20Vijayam">Madura Vijayam</a>" by Princess <a href="Gangadevi">Gangadevi</a>, a daughter-in-law of King <a href="Bukka%20I">Bukka I</a>. Also known as "Veerakamparaya Charita", the book dwells on the conquest of the <a href="Madurai%20Sultanate">Madurai Sultanate</a> by the Vijayanagara empire.
The <a href="Kannada%20literature%20in%20Vijayanagara%20empire">Kannada poets and scholars of the empire</a> produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava <a href="Bhakti">Bhakti</a> movement heralded by the <a href="Haridasa">Haridasa</a>s (devotees of Vishnu), <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a>ical and Veerashaiva (<a href="Lingayatism">Lingayatism</a>) literature. The "<a href="Haridasa">Haridasa</a>" poets celebrated their devotion through songs called "Devaranama" (lyrical poems) in the native meters of "Sangatya" (quatrain), "Suladi" (beat based), "Ugabhoga" (melody based) and "Mundige" (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of <a href="Madhvacharya">Madhvacharya</a> and <a href="Vyasatirtha">Vyasatirtha</a>. <a href="Purandaradasa">Purandaradasa</a> and <a href="Kanakadasa">Kanakadasa</a> are considered the foremost among many "Dasas" (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. <a href="Kumara%20Vyasa">Kumara Vyasa</a>, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote "Gadugina Bharata", a translation of the epic "Mahabharata". This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. <a href="Chamarasa">Chamarasa</a> was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His "Prabhulinga Leele", later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint <a href="Allama%20Prabhu">Allama Prabhu</a> (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord <a href="Ganapathi">Ganapathi</a> while <a href="Parvati">Parvati</a> took the form of a princess of Banavasi).
At this peak of <a href="Telugu%20people">Telugu</a> literature, the most famous writing in the "Prabandha" style was "Manucharitamu". King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated <a href="Amuktamalyada">Amuktamalyada</a>. "Amuktamalyada" ("One who wears and gives away garlands") narrates the story of the wedding of the god <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a> to <a href="Andal">Andal</a>, the Tamil <a href="Alvars">Alvar</a> saint poet and the daughter of <a href="Periyalvar">Periyalvar</a> at <a href="Srirangam">Srirangam</a>. In his court were eight famous scholars regarded as the pillars ("<a href="Ashtadiggajas">Ashtadiggajas</a>") of the literary assembly. The most famous among them were <a href="Allasani%20Peddana">Allasani Peddana</a> who held the honorific "Andhrakavitapitamaha" ("lit", "father of Telugu poetry") and <a href="Tenali%20Ramakrishna">Tenali Ramakrishna</a>, the court jester who authored several notable works. The other six poets were <a href="Nandi%20Thimmana">Nandi Thimmana</a> (Mukku Timmana), <a href="Ayyalaraju%20Ramabhadrudu">Ayyalaraju Ramabhadra</a>, <a href="Madayyagari%20Mallana">Madayyagari Mallana</a>, <a href="Ramarajabhushanudu">Bhattu Murthi</a> (Ramaraja Bhushana), <a href="Pingali%20Surana">Pingali Surana</a>, and <a href="Dhurjati">Dhurjati</a>. This was the age of <a href="Srinatha">Srinatha</a>, the greatest of all Telugu poets of the time. He wrote books such as "Marutratcharitamu" and "Salivahana-sapta-sati". He was patronised by King Devaraya II and enjoyed the same status as important ministers in the court. 
Though much of the <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> literature from this period came from Tamil speaking regions ruled by the feudatory Pandya who gave particular attention on the cultivation of Tamil literature, some poets were patronised by the Vijayanagara kings. <a href="Svarupananda%20Desikar">Svarupananda Desikar</a> wrote an anthology of 2824 verses, "Sivaprakasap-perundirattu", on the Advaita philosophy. His pupil the ascetic, <a href="Tattuvarayar">Tattuvarayar</a>, wrote a shorter anthology, "Kurundirattu", that contained about half the number of verses. Krishnadevaraya patronised the Tamil Vaishnava poet Haridasa whose "Irusamaya Vilakkam" was an exposition of the two Hindu systems, Vaishnava and Shaiva, with a preference for the former.

Notable among secular writings on music and medicine were <a href="Vidyaranya">Vidyaranya</a>'s "Sangitsara", <a href="Praudha%20Raya">Praudha Raya</a>'s "Ratiratnapradipika", <a href="Sayana">Sayana</a>'s "Ayurveda Sudhanidhi" and <a href="Lakshmana%20Pandita">Lakshmana Pandita</a>'s "Vaidyarajavallabham". The <a href="Kerala%20school%20of%20astronomy%20and%20mathematics">Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics</a> flourished during this period under such well known scholars as <a href="Madhava%20of%20Sangamagrama">Madhava</a> (c. 1340–1425) who made important contributions to Trigonometery and Calculus, and <a href="Nilakantha%20Somayaji">Nilakantha Somayaji</a> (c. 1444–1545) who postulated on the orbitals of planets.

Vijayanagara architecture is a vibrant combination of the <a href="Chalukya%20dynasty">Chalukya</a>, <a href="Hoysala%20Empire">Hoysala</a>, <a href="Pandyan%20dynasty">Pandya</a> and <a href="Chola%20dynasty">Chola</a> styles, idioms that prospered in previous centuries. Its legacy of sculpture, architecture and painting influenced the development of the arts long after the empire came to an end. Its stylistic hallmark is the ornate <a href="Column">pillared</a> "Kalyanamantapa" (marriage hall), "Vasanthamantapa" (open pillared halls) and the "Rayagopura" (tower). Artisans used the locally available hard granite because of its durability since the kingdom was under constant threat of invasion. While the empire's monuments are spread over the whole of Southern India, nothing surpasses the vast open-air theatre of monuments at its capital at <a href="Vijayanagara">Vijayanagara</a>, a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>.

In the 14th century the kings continued to build <a href="vesara">vesara</a> or Deccan-style monuments but later incorporated Dravida-style <a href="gopura">gopura</a>s to meet their ritualistic needs. The Prasanna Virupaksha temple (underground temple) of <a href="Bukka">Bukka</a> and the Hazare Rama temple of <a href="Deva%20Raya">Deva Raya</a> are examples of Deccan architecture. The varied and intricate ornamentation of the pillars is a mark of their work. At Hampi, though the "Vitthala" temple is the best example of their pillared "Kalyanamantapa" style, the "Hazara Ramaswamy" temple is a modest but perfectly finished example. A visible aspect of their style is their return to the simplistic and serene art developed by the Chalukya dynasty. A grand specimen of Vijayanagara art, the "Vitthala" temple, took several decades to complete during the reign of the <a href="Tuluva">Tuluva</a> kings.
Another element of the Vijayanagara style is the carving and consecration of large <a href="Monolithic%20architecture">monoliths</a> such as the "Sasivekaalu" (<a href="mustard%20seed">mustard</a>) <a href="Ganesha">Ganesha</a> and "Kadalekaalu" (<a href="Peanut">ground nut</a>) Ganesha at Hampi, the <a href="Gommateshwara">Gommateshwara</a> (<a href="Bahubali">Bahubali</a>) monoliths in <a href="Karkala">Karkala</a> and <a href="Venur">Venur</a>, and the <a href="Nandi%20%28bull%29">Nandi</a> bull in <a href="Lepakshi">Lepakshi</a>. The Vijayanagara temples of <a href="Someshwara%20Temple%2C%20Kolar">Kolar</a>, <a href="Kanakachalapathi%20Temple%2C%20Kanakagiri">Kanakagiri</a>, <a href="Sringeri">Sringeri</a> and other towns of Karnataka; the temples of <a href="Tadpatri">Tadpatri</a>, <a href="Lepakshi">Lepakshi</a>, <a href="Ahobilam">Ahobilam</a>, <a href="Tirumala%20Venkateswara%20Temple">Tirumala Venkateswara Temple</a> and <a href="Srikalahasti">Srikalahasti</a> in <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>; and the temples of <a href="Vellore">Vellore</a>, <a href="Kumbakonam">Kumbakonam</a>, <a href="Kanchi">Kanchi</a> and <a href="Srirangam">Srirangam</a> in <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> are examples of this style. Vijayanagara art includes wall-paintings such as the <a href="Dashavatara">Dashavatara</a> and "Girijakalyana" (marriage of <a href="Parvati">Parvati</a>, Shiva's consort) in the <a href="Virupaksha%20Temple%2C%20Hampi">Virupaksha Temple</a> at <a href="Hampi">Hampi</a>, the "Shivapurana" murals (tales of Shiva) at the <a href="Virabhadra">Virabhadra</a> temple at <a href="Lepakshi">Lepakshi</a>, and those at the Kamaakshi and Varadaraja temples at Kanchi. This mingling of the South Indian styles resulted in a richness not seen in earlier centuries, a focus on <a href="relief">relief</a>s in addition to sculpture that surpasses that previously in India.

An aspect of Vijayanagara architecture that shows the cosmopolitanism of the great city is the presence of many secular structures bearing Islamic features. While political history concentrates on the ongoing conflict between the Vijayanagara empire and the Deccan Sultanates, the architectural record reflects a more creative interaction. There are many <a href="arch">arch</a>es, <a href="dome">dome</a>s and <a href="Vault%20%28architecture%29">vaults</a> that show these influences. The concentration of structures like <a href="Chhatri">pavilions</a>, <a href="stable">stable</a>s and <a href="tower">tower</a>s suggests they were for use by royalty. The decorative details of these structures may have been absorbed into Vijayanagara architecture during the early 15th century, coinciding with the rule of Deva Raya I and Deva Raya II. These kings are known to have employed many Muslims in their army and court, some of whom may have been <a href="Mughal%20architecture">Muslim architects</a>. This harmonious exchange of architectural ideas must have happened during rare periods of peace between the Hindu and Muslim kingdoms. The "Great Platform" ("Mahanavami Dibba") has relief carvings in which the figures seem to have the facial features of central Asian Turks who were known to have been employed as royal attendants.

Jordan River (Utah)

The Jordan River, in the state of <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, United States, is a river about long. Regulated by pumps at its headwaters at <a href="Utah%20Lake">Utah Lake</a>, it flows northward through the <a href="Salt%20Lake%20Valley">Salt Lake Valley</a> and empties into the <a href="Great%20Salt%20Lake">Great Salt Lake</a>. Four of Utah's six largest cities border the river: <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a>, <a href="West%20Valley%20City%2C%20Utah">West Valley City</a>, <a href="West%20Jordan%2C%20Utah">West Jordan</a> and <a href="Sandy%2C%20Utah">Sandy</a>. More than a million people live in the Jordan Subbasin, which is the part of the Jordan River watershed that lies within Salt Lake and Utah counties. During the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, the area was part of <a href="Lake%20Bonneville">Lake Bonneville</a>.

Members of the <a href="Archaic%20period%20in%20the%20Americas">Desert Archaic Culture</a> were the earliest known inhabitants of the region; an archaeological site found along the river dates back 3,000 years. <a href="Mormon%20pioneers">Mormon pioneers</a> led by <a href="Brigham%20Young">Brigham Young</a> were the first <a href="European%20Americans">European American</a> settlers, arriving in July 1847 and establishing farms and settlements along the river and its tributaries. The growing population, needing water for drinking, irrigation, and industrial use in an arid climate, dug ditches and canals, built dams, and installed pumps to create a highly regulated river.

Although the Jordan was originally a cold-water <a href="fishery">fishery</a> with 13 native species including <a href="Bonneville%20cutthroat%20trout">Bonneville cutthroat trout</a>, it has become a warm-water fishery where the <a href="common%20carp">common carp</a> is most abundant. It was heavily polluted for many years by raw sewage, agricultural runoff, and mining wastes. In the 1960s, sewage treatment removed many pollutants. In the 21st century, pollution is further limited by the <a href="Clean%20Water%20Act">Clean Water Act</a>, and, in some cases, the <a href="Superfund">Superfund</a> program. Once the home of <a href="bighorn%20sheep">bighorn sheep</a> and <a href="North%20American%20beaver">beaver</a>, the contemporary river is frequented by <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s, <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>es, and domestic pets. It serves as an important avian resource, as does the Great Salt Lake and Utah Lake, visited by more than 200 bird species.

<a href="Big%20Cottonwood%20Creek">Big Cottonwood</a>, <a href="Little%20Cottonwood%20Creek">Little Cottonwood</a>, <a href="Red%20Butte%20Creek">Red Butte</a>, Mill, Parley's, and City creeks, as well as smaller streams like <a href="Willow%20Creek%20%28Jordan%20River%29">Willow Creek</a> at <a href="Draper%2C%20Utah">Draper, Utah</a>, flow through the subbasin. The <a href="Jordan%20River%20Parkway">Jordan River Parkway</a> along the river includes natural areas, botanical gardens, golf courses and a proposed bicycle and pedestrian trail, much of which has been completed.

The Jordan River is the Utah Lake's only outflow, and originates at the northern end of the lake between the cities of <a href="Lehi%2C%20Utah">Lehi</a> and <a href="Saratoga%20Springs%2C%20Utah">Saratoga Springs</a>. It then meanders north through the north end of <a href="Utah%20Valley">Utah Valley</a> for approximately until it passes through a gorge in the <a href="Traverse%20Mountains">Traverse Mountains</a>, known as the Jordan Narrows. The <a href="Utah%20National%20Guard">Utah National Guard</a> base at <a href="Camp%20W.%20G.%20Williams">Camp Williams</a> lies on the western side of the river through much of the Jordan Narrows. The Turner Dam, located from the river's mouth (or at <a href="river%20mile">river mile</a> 41.8) and within the boundaries of the Jordan Narrows, is the first of two dams of the Jordan River. Turner Dam diverts water to the right or easterly into the <a href="East%20Jordan%20Canal">East Jordan Canal</a> and to the left or westerly toward the <a href="Utah%20and%20Salt%20Lake%20Canal">Utah and Salt Lake Canal</a>. Two pumping stations, situated next to Turner Dam, divert water to the west into the <a href="Provo%20Reservoir%20Canal">Provo Reservoir Canal</a>, <a href="Utah%20Lake%20Distribution%20Canal">Utah Lake Distribution Canal</a> and <a href="Jacob-Welby%20Canal">Jacob-Welby Canal</a>. The Provo Reservoir Canal runs north through Salt Lake County, Jacob-Welby runs south through Utah County and the Utah Lake Distribution Canal runs both north and south eventually leading back into Utah Lake. Outside the narrows, the river reaches the second dam, known as Joint Dam, which is from the river's mouth. Joint Dam diverts water to the east for the <a href="Jordan%20and%20Salt%20Lake%20City%20Canal">Jordan and Salt Lake City Canal</a> and to the west for the <a href="South%20Jordan%20Canal">South Jordan Canal</a>.

The river then flows through the middle of the Salt Lake Valley, initially moving through the city of <a href="Bluffdale%2C%20Utah">Bluffdale</a> and then forming the border between the cities of <a href="Riverton%2C%20Utah">Riverton</a> and <a href="Draper%2C%20Utah">Draper</a>. The river then enters the city of <a href="South%20Jordan%2C%20Utah">South Jordan</a> where it merges with Midas Creek from the west. Upon leaving South Jordan, the river forms the border between the cities of West Jordan on the west and Sandy and <a href="Midvale%2C%20Utah">Midvale</a> on the east. From the west, Bingham Creek enters in West Jordan. Dry Creek, an eastern tributary, combines with the main river in Sandy. The river then forms the border between the cities of <a href="Taylorsville%2C%20Utah">Taylorsville</a> and West Valley City on the west and <a href="Murray%2C%20Utah">Murray</a> and <a href="South%20Salt%20Lake%2C%20Utah">South Salt Lake</a> on the east. The river flows underneath <a href="Interstate%20215%20%28Utah%29">Interstate 215</a> in Murray. Little and <a href="Big%20Cottonwood%20Creek">Big Cottonwood Creek</a>s enter from the east in Murray, and from the mouth respectively. Mill Creek enters on the east in South Salt Lake, from the mouth. The river runs through the middle of Salt Lake City, where the river travels underneath <a href="Interstate%2080%20in%20Utah">Interstate 80</a> a mile west of downtown of Salt Lake City and again underneath Interstate 215 in the northern portion of Salt Lake City. <a href="Interstate%2015%20in%20Utah">Interstate 15</a> parallels the river's eastern flank throughout Salt Lake County. At from the mouth, the river enters into the Surplus Canal channel. The Jordan River physically diverts from the Surplus Canal through four gates and heads north with the Surplus Canal heading north-west. Parley's, Emigration, and Red Butte Creeks converge from the east through an underground pipe, from the mouth. City Creek also enters via an underground pipe, from the river's mouth. The length of the river and the elevation of its mouth varies year to year depending on the fluctuations of the Great Salt Lake caused by weather conditions. The lake has an average elevation of which can deviate by . The Jordan River then continues for with Salt Lake County on the west and <a href="North%20Salt%20Lake%2C%20Utah">North Salt Lake</a> and Davis County on the east until it empties into the Great Salt Lake.

The <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> maintains a <a href="stream%20gauge">stream gauge</a> in Salt Lake City that shows annual runoff from the period 1980–2003 is just over per year or 100 percent of the total of water entering the Jordan River from all sources. The Surplus Canal carries almost 60 percent of the water into the Great Salt Lake with various irrigation canals responsible for the rest. The amount of water entering the Jordan River from Utah Lake is just over per year. Inflow from the 11 largest streams feeding the Jordan River, sewage treatment plants and ground water each accounts for approximately 15 percent of water entering the river.

The Jordan Subbasin, as defined by the United States Geological Survey, is located entirely within Salt Lake and Utah counties in a roughly rectangular area of . The Subbasin is part of the larger Jordan River Basin that includes the upper Jordan River, Utah Lake, Provo and Spanish Fork Subbasins. Four of the six largest cities in Utah are in Salt Lake County. The Jordan River flows through Sandy, with a 2010 population of 87,461; West Jordan, population 103,712; West Valley City, population 129,480; and Salt Lake City, population 186,440. Flanked on either side by mountain ranges, the topography of the land varies greatly. The <a href="Wasatch%20Range">Wasatch Range</a> rise on the east, with a high point of above sea level at <a href="Twin%20Peaks%20%28Salt%20Lake%20County%2C%20Utah%29">Twin Peaks</a>, near the town of <a href="Alta%2C%20Utah">Alta</a>. The <a href="Oquirrh%20Mountains">Oquirrh Mountains</a> rise on the west, with a high point of over above sea level at <a href="Farnsworth%20Peak">Farnsworth Peak</a>. The low point of is at the river's mouth, where the river enters the Great Salt Lake. Both the Oquirrh and Wasatch Mountains are <a href="fault-block%20mountain">fault-block mountain</a>s created from <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29%23Fault%20types">normal-slip faults</a> where the mountains rise at the fault and the valley floor drops. The <a href="Wasatch%20Fault">Wasatch Fault</a> runs along the western edge of the Wasatch Mountains and the Oquirrh Fault runs along the eastern edge of the Oquirrh Mountains.

From approximately 75,000 to 8,000 years ago, much of what is now northern Utah was covered by a Pleistocene lake called <a href="Lake%20Bonneville">Lake Bonneville</a>. At its greatest extent, Lake Bonneville reached an elevation of above sea level and had a surface area of . The lake left behind <a href="lacustrine%20plain">lacustrine sediments</a>, which resulted in a relatively flat lake bed, and the valley floors seen today. As the region experienced increasingly warmer and drier climate over time, Lake Bonneville's water levels receded, leaving the Great Salt Lake and Utah Lake as remnants. The river's greatest slope, , is in the Jordan Narrows, while the rest of the river has a more gentle slope of .

Approximately (46 percent of land area) of the Jordan Subbasin is in the Wasatch, Oquirrh and Traverse mountains. The <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">United States Forest Service</a> manages of land in the Wasatch Range. The vast majority of the Oquirrh Range is privately held, with <a href="Kennecott%20Copper%20Mine">Kennecott Copper Mine</a> owning most of the land. The State of Utah has scattered land holdings of throughout the subbasin and owns the beds of all navigable streams and lakes.

The Jordan Subbasin has two distinct climate zones. The lower elevations are characterized as a <a href="Semi-arid%20climate%23Cold%20semi-arid%20climates">cold, semi-arid climate</a>, with four distinct seasons. Both summer and winter are long with hot, dry summers and cold, snowy winters. Salt Lake City receives of snow annually, part of a total of of precipitation per year. The mean maximum temperature is in July and in January Areas of higher elevation have two distinct seasons, summer and winter. One of the areas of highest elevation, Alta, Utah, receives of snow annually, part of a total of of precipitation per year. The mean maximum temperature is in July and in January.

The first known inhabitants of the banks of the Jordan River were members of the Desert Archaic Culture, a group of nomadic hunter-gatherers. A 3,000-year-old archaeological site, called the Soo'nkahni Village, was uncovered next to the Jordan River. The next recorded inhabitants, between 400 A.D. to around 1350 A.D., were the <a href="Fremont%20culture">Fremont people</a>, composed of several scattered bands of hunters and farmers living in what is now southern <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>, western <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> and most of Utah. The disappearance of the Fremont people has been attributed to both changing climatic conditions, which put an end to favorable weather for farming, and to the arrival of ancestors to the present-day <a href="Ute%20Tribe">Ute</a>, <a href="Southern%20Paiute">Paiute</a>, and <a href="Northwestern%20Shoshone">Northwestern Shoshone</a>. Although there were no permanent Native American settlements when European settlers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, the area bordered land occupied by several tribes, such as the Timpanogot band of the Utes in Utah Valley, the <a href="Goshute">Goshute</a>s on the western side of the Oquirrh Mountain Range and the Northwestern Shoshone north of the Salt Lake Valley.

In 1776, Franciscan missionary <a href="Silvestre%20V%C3%A9lez%20de%20Escalante">Silvestre Vélez de Escalante</a> was trying to find a land route from <a href="Santa%20Fe%2C%20New%20Mexico">Santa Fe</a>, <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>, to <a href="Monterey%2C%20California">Monterey</a>, <a href="California">California</a>. His party included twelve Spanish colonials and two Utes from the Utah Valley Timpanogots band who acted as guides. On 23 September 1776, the party entered Utah Valley at the present-day city of <a href="Spanish%20Fork%2C%20Utah">Spanish Fork</a>. The local Timanogots villagers hosted them and told them of the lake to the north. In his journal, Escalante described Utah Lake as a "lake, which must be six leagues wide and fifteen leagues long, [and] extends as far as one of these valleys. It runs northwest through a narrow passage, and according to what they told us, it communicates with others much larger." The Great Salt Lake was described as the "other lake with which this one communicates, according to what they told us, [and] covers many leagues, and its waters are noxious and extremely salty."

The next group of Europeans to see the Jordan River was the party of <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Provost">Étienne Provost</a>, a <a href="French%20Canadian">French Canadian</a> trapper. In October 1824, Provost's party was lured into a Shoshone camp somewhere along the Jordan River, where they were attacked in retaliation for the murder of a local chief. In truth, the murder was committed by a member of <a href="Peter%20Skene%20Ogden">Peter Skene Ogden</a>'s party. The men were caught off guard, and fifteen perished, but Provost and two others escaped. The river was historically named Proveau's Fork, as the Quebec-born fur trapper was known as Proveau and Provot, in addition to Provost (and the pronunciation was "Provo").

On 22 July 1847, the first party of <a href="Mormon%20pioneers">Mormon pioneers</a> arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, and five days later another party led by <a href="Brigham%20Young">Brigham Young</a> crossed the Jordan River and bathed in the Great Salt Lake. The <a href="Jordan%20River">River Jordan</a> (located in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>) drains the <a href="Sea%20of%20Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a> into the <a href="Dead%20Sea">Dead Sea</a> in a way which the settlers found remarkably similar to the way the as-yet-unnamed local river drained Utah Lake into the saline Great Salt Lake. This similarity influenced the eventual name of the river, and on 22 August 1847, a conference was held and the name Western Jordan River was decided upon, although it was later shortened to the Jordan River. By 1850, settlements were established along the Jordan River, Big Cottonwood Creek, Little Cottonwood Creek, Mill Creek, Parley's Creek and Emigration Creek. In 1850, Captain <a href="Howard%20Stansbury">Howard Stansbury</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers%23History">United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers</a> traveled the entire length of the Jordan River, surveying and making observations of the wildlife.

Around the year 1887 at <a href="Bingham%20Canyon%2C%20Utah">Bingham Canyon</a> in the Oquirrh Mountains, low-grade copper deposits were discovered and <a href="mining%20claim">mining claim</a>s were filed. Bingham Canyon is a <a href="porphyry%20copper%20deposit">porphyry copper deposit</a> where <a href="magma">magma</a> containing copper, molybdenum, gold and other minerals slowly moved its way to the surface and cooled into rock. By 1890, underground copper mining had started, and in 1907, Kennecott Copper Mine started <a href="open%20pit%20mining">open pit mining</a>. In the early 20th century, mills were established near the Jordan River in Midvale and West Jordan to process ore. As of 2010, Kennecott Copper Mine's open pit is wide and deep.

Throughout the 19th century and up to the 1940s, water from the Jordan River watershed sustained the agrarian society of the Salt Lake Valley. In 1950, Salt Lake County had devoted to farming. By 1992, however, the rapid urbanization of the Salt Lake Valley had reduced the amount of land devoted to farming to , which was further reduced to by 2002.

Alterations of the Jordan River watershed began two days after the Mormon Pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley when water was diverted from City Creek for irrigation. The earliest dam and ditch along the Jordan River was constructed in 1849 to irrigate land on the west side of the river near present-day Taylorsville. Other ditches include one built by <a href="Archibald%20Gardner">Archibald Gardner</a>, one of the founders of West Jordan in 1850, to provide water for his mill and one built by Alexander Beckstead, a founder of South Jordan, who built the Beckstead Ditch in 1859 to provide water for farmland. Many other small dams and ditches were also constructed in the first 25 years, several of which are still used as of 2010. All of these ditches irrigated only small amounts of land in the Jordan River floodplain; the largest, the Beckstead Ditch, irrigated .

By the late 1860s, it became apparent that new, larger canals needed to be built if more acreage was to be farmed. The first dam in the Jordan Narrows was constructed in 1872 and raised in 1880, sparking an outcry from residents living near Utah Lake who thought the dam was responsible for raising the level of the lake. After several years of dispute, a commission was established to determine an acceptable compromise for the elevation of Utah Lake. The commission's 1885 decision stated that if the lake level were to rise above the established compromise level, the Jordan River could not be impeded by either dams or flood gates. Additionally, the commission stated that after water pumps were installed at the source of the river, the pumps should all be working if the lake were to rise above the compromise level. However, if the lake level fell below the compromise level, pumps could be turned off so that water could be held for storage in Utah Lake.
In 1875, the first large canal, the South Jordan Canal, was completed and it brought water to the area above the bluffs of the Jordan River for the first time. All told, five large canals that originated from the dams in the Jordan Narrows were completed by 1883. A second dam was built in 1890 a few miles (~5 km) downstream from the first dam and was constructed to better regulate the flow of two canals. Both dams have been rebuilt in subsequent years and operate as diversion points for canals rather than impounding water by the use of <a href="sluice%20gate">sluice gate</a>s and head gates. The drought of 1901–1902 caused the Jordan River, on occasion, to stop flowing, and in response to the drought a pumping plant was installed at the outlet from Utah Lake. It was the largest pumping plant in the United States at the time, and contained seven pumps with a total capacity of per second. Twice, during the droughts of 1934 and 1992, Utah Lake levels dropped so low that the pumps were rendered useless and the Jordan River actually ran dry. In the 1950s, due to flood control measures to increase river velocity, large sections of the river were straightened in Salt Lake County. As part of the straightening process, meanders or curves in the river were cut off and the channel slope was increased. The river was also shifted to opposite sides of the flood plain in Midvale and Murray as part of local <a href="smelter">smelter</a> operations.

Floods in 1983–1984 caused Utah Lake to overflow its banks, flooding homes and farmland in <a href="Provo%2C%20Utah">Provo</a>, Lehi and present-day Saratoga Springs. Dikes had to be constructed around Interstate 15 in Provo to prevent Utah Lake flooding the freeway. Big Cottonwood, Parley's, Emigration and City creeks flowed down sand-bag lined streets in order to manage the overflowing streams. Additional dikes were built at the Great Salt Lake to protect railroad lines and Interstate 80. As a result of the flooding, the Utah Lake compromise level was amended to .

In the Jordan River, <a href="invertebrates">invertebrates</a> play an important role as a source of food for fish and other aquatic life, and they function as a parameter by which to measure water quality and the health of the river. There are 34 different groups of invertebrates found in the Jordan River, most commonly of the class <a href="Oligochaeta">Oligochaeta</a> (which includes <a href="earthworms">earthworms</a>), <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a> larvae and <a href="caddisfly">caddisfly</a> larvae. The state of Utah maintains a Sensitive Species List that includes "those species for which there is credible scientific evidence to substantiate a threat to continued population viability." The Lyrate mountainsnail and the <a href="Margaritifera">western pearlshell mussel</a>, both native to the Jordan River watershed, are found on this list. A 2007 survey of invertebrates and their response to pollution stated that the Jordan River was substantially to severely impaired with organic pollution and that it contained reduced levels of dissolved oxygen.

Historically, the Jordan River was a cold-water fishery that contained 13 native species, including the <a href="Bonneville%20cutthroat%20trout">Bonneville cutthroat trout</a>, <a href="Utah%20Lake%20sculpin">Utah Lake sculpin</a>, <a href="June%20sucker">June sucker</a>, <a href="Mottled%20sculpin">Mottled sculpin</a>, <a href="Utah%20chub">Utah chub</a> and the <a href="Utah%20sucker">Utah sucker</a>. Today, the Jordan River is a warm-water fishery with the Utah sucker and the <a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a> June sucker present only in Utah Lake. The Utah chub, however, is still found in the Jordan River. The most common species of fish encountered today is the <a href="common%20carp">common carp</a>, which was introduced into the Jordan River and Utah Lake as a source of food after overfishing caused the depletion of native species stocks. The <a href="Utah%20Division%20of%20Wildlife%20Resources">Utah Division of Wildlife Resources</a> regularly stocks the river with <a href="catfish">catfish</a> and <a href="rainbow%20trout">rainbow trout</a>.

Before the area was <a href="urbanization">urbanized</a>, mammals such as <a href="bighorn%20sheep">bighorn sheep</a>, <a href="mule%20deer">mule deer</a>, <a href="coyote">coyote</a>, <a href="Gray%20wolf">wolves</a>, <a href="North%20American%20beaver">beaver</a>, <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a> and <a href="Hare">jackrabbits</a> would have been seen along the river. A "varmint hunt" was organized by <a href="John%20D.%20Lee">John D. Lee</a> around 1848, after the arrival of Mormon settlers. The final count of the hunt included "two bears, two wolverines, two wildcats, 783 wolves, 409 foxes, 31 minks, nine eagles, 530 magpies, hawks and owls, and 1,026 ravens." None of the original large mammals is found along the Jordan River today; they have, for the most part, been replaced by <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s, <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>es and domestic pets. Animals from the Jordan River area found on the Utah Sensitive Species List include the <a href="Opheodrys%20vernalis">smooth green snake</a>, the <a href="western%20toad">western toad</a>, <a href="kit%20fox">kit fox</a>, <a href="spotted%20bat">spotted bat</a>, and <a href="Townsend%27s%20big-eared%20bat">Townsend's big-eared bat</a>.

Combined with Utah Lake and the Great Salt Lake, the Jordan River offers one of the region's richest bird resources. Over 200 bird species use the river for breeding habitat or as a stop-over on their migratory routes. Once-common native species such as the <a href="willow%20flycatcher">willow flycatcher</a>, <a href="grey%20catbird">gray catbird</a>, <a href="warbling%20vireo">warbling vireo</a>, <a href="American%20redstart">American redstart</a>, <a href="black%20tern">black tern</a>, and <a href="yellow-billed%20cuckoo">yellow-billed cuckoo</a> are no longer found along the river. The <a href="common%20yellowthroat">common yellowthroat</a> and <a href="yellow-breasted%20chat">yellow-breasted chat</a> are still found in small isolated populations. The most common species now found are the <a href="black-billed%20magpie">black-billed magpie</a>, <a href="mourning%20dove">mourning dove</a>, <a href="western%20meadowlark">western meadowlark</a>, <a href="barn%20swallow">barn swallow</a>, and the non-native <a href="common%20pheasant">ring-necked pheasant</a> and <a href="European%20starling">starlings</a>.

Vegetation in the watershed is closely tied to elevation and precipitation levels. About 30 percent of the basin, mostly at higher elevation levels, is populated with <a href="oak">oak</a>, <a href="aspen">aspen</a> and <a href="conifer">conifer</a>ous trees. At the lower levels, 27 percent of the basin is rich in mountain-brush, <a href="sagebrush">sagebrush</a>, <a href="Juniperus%20osteosperma">juniper</a> and grasses. About 34 percent of the Jordan River basin is classified as urban.

<a href="Russian%20olive">Russian olive</a> and <a href="tamarisk">tamarisk</a> or salt cedar trees now dominate the Jordan River floodplain where <a href="willow%20trees">willow trees</a> and <a href="Populus%20sect.%20Aegiros">cottonwood trees</a> would once have been found. Plant species such as <a href="foxtail%20barley">foxtail barley</a>, <a href="saltgrass">saltgrass</a>, <a href="Chrysothamnus">rabbitbrush</a>, <a href="cattails">cattails</a> and other reeds are still found in small pockets along the river. Exotic pasture grasses such as <a href="orchard%20grass">orchard grass</a>, <a href="poa">bluegrass</a>, <a href="Agrostis%20gigantea">redtop bentgrass</a>, <a href="quackgrass">quackgrass</a>, <a href="wheatgrass">wheatgrass</a> and <a href="fescue">fescue</a> have become the common species of grass. The <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a> flower, <a href="Spiranthes%20diluvialis">Ute's Ladies'-tresses</a>, can also be found along the river.

The Jordan River has been a repository for waste since the settling of the Salt Lake Valley. For 100 years, raw, untreated sewage was dumped into the river; farming and animal runoff occurred; and mining operations led to 40 smelters being built and contaminating the river with heavy metals, mostly <a href="Arsenic%20contamination%20of%20groundwater">arsenic</a> and <a href="lead">lead</a>. In 1962, the river in Midvale recorded a total <a href="coliform">coliform</a> level of about 3 million per 100 milliliters, even though the state of Utah criteria for the total number of coliform bacteria in water samples should not exceed 5,000 per 100 milliliters. In 1965, a new sewage treatment plant came on-line in Salt Lake City that prevented of raw sewage from being dumped into a canal.

The <a href="Utah%20Division%20of%20Water%20Quality">Utah Division of Water Quality</a> and Utah Division of Drinking Water are responsible for the regulation and management of water quality in the State of Utah. Streams that exceed the standard contamination levels are placed on the 303d list in accordance with the <a href="Clean%20Water%20Act">Clean Water Act</a>. The Act also requires states to identify impaired water bodies every two years and develop a <a href="total%20maximum%20daily%20load">total maximum daily load</a> (TMDL) for pollutants that may cause impairments in the various water bodies. The Jordan River and Little Cottonwood Creek were included on the 2006 303d list; parameters that exceeded the standard level for at least part of the Jordan River include temperature, <a href="Dissolved%20oxygen%23Environmental%20sciences">dissolved oxygen</a>, <a href="total%20dissolved%20solids">total dissolved solids</a>, "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. Coli</a>" and salinity.

<a href="List%20of%20Superfund%20sites%20in%20the%20United%20States">Superfund sites</a> are designated as being among the nation's worst areas with respect to toxic and <a href="hazardous%20waste">hazardous waste</a>. The <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> is the federal agency that determines if a particular site is hazardous, prepares a course of action to reduce the hazard, and finds the parties responsible for the pollution. If a site is listed with the <a href="Superfund">Superfund</a> program, federal dollars are available for cleanup.

The Kennecott South Zone/Bingham site contains contamination from Kennecott Copper Mine's operation in <a href="Copperton%2C%20Utah">Copperton</a>, at the base of the Oquirrh Mountains to Bingham Creek and Butterfield Creek. A plume of lead, arsenic and <a href="Sulfates%23Environmental%20effects">sulfates</a> (covering 9 percent of the watershed) currently contaminates the ground water from the mine site all the way to the Jordan River. The largest inland <a href="reverse%20osmosis">reverse osmosis</a> plant in the country was built in 2006 to clean up the ground water and a second plant has been scheduled for construction; completion of the ground water cleanup, however, is not projected until 2040. In 1998, the site was removed from the Superfund list due to Kennecott's progress in the cleanup and a <a href="consent%20decree">consent decree</a> legally obligating Kennecott to continue the rest of the cleanup.
The Murray Smelter site was the location of a large lead smelter in operation from 1872 until 1949. The site contained groundwater contamination from <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a> and lead, but the majority of the cleanup was completed in 2001.

In Midvale, there are two Superfund sites that sit along 4 percent of the Jordan River. The Midvale Slag site is a site adjacent to of the Jordan River. From 1871 to 1958, the site contained five separate smelters that processed ores from Kennecott and other mines. The site was contaminated with lead, arsenic, <a href="Chromium%23Precautions">chromium</a>, and <a href="Cadmium%23Toxicity">cadmium</a>. Cleanup of the property is complete, although the Jordan River Riparian Project still underway as of 2010. <a href="Sharon%20Steel%20Corporation">Sharon Steel</a> was a site adjacent to of the Jordan River which was used, from 1902 to 1971, for smelting copper from Kennecott Copper Mine. The site was contaminated with lead, arsenic, <a href="Iron%23Precautions">iron</a>, <a href="Manganese%23Precautions">manganese</a>, and <a href="Zinc%23Environmental%20impact">zinc</a>. Cleanup has been completed, and the site taken off the Superfund list in 2004.

Vitro Uranium Mill was a site located in South Salt Lake, surrounded by the Jordan River, Mill Creek, a small wetland and traversed by the South Vitro Ditch. The site, operational from 1953 to 1964, contained a <a href="uranium">uranium</a> mill and storage for uranium. In 1989, surface contamination cleanup was completed with tailings, radioactively contaminated soil material, and debris removed from the site. However, of contaminated shallow ground water still remain, and studies are underway to determine what action should be taken.

The Jordan River Parkway was originally proposed in 1971 as a flood control measure with two reservoirs, restoration of wetlands, shoreline roads for cars, walking trails, and parks. By 1986, $18 million had been used to purchase lands around the Jordan River and to construct the Murray Golf Course, several smaller parks and about of canoe runs and trails. As of 2010, the majority of the continuous mixed-use trail has been finished from Utah Lake to the Davis County border. A water trail for <a href="canoe">canoe</a>ing and <a href="kayak">kayak</a>ing is also being constructed, but dams, bridges, <a href="weir">weir</a>s and other obstacles hamper the use of the river.

Riverside parks include the <a href="International%20Peace%20Gardens">International Peace Gardens</a>, of gardens with each garden representing a different country; Redwood Nature Area, about of natural areas; South Jordan's Riverfront Park, of trails, fishing ponds and natural areas; <a href="Thanksgiving%20Point">Thanksgiving Point</a>, including 15 themed gardens spread over 59 acres, and a , 18-hole golf course; and Utah County's Willow Park, of camping and wildlife areas.

Cillian Murphy

Cillian Murphy (; born 25 May 1976) is an Irish actor. He began his career performing as a rock musician. After turning down a record deal, he began his acting career in theatre, and in <a href="short%20films">short</a> and <a href="independent%20films">independent</a> films in the late 1990s.

He appeared in the films "<a href="28%20Days%20Later">28 Days Later</a>" (2002), "<a href="Cold%20Mountain%20%28film%29">Cold Mountain</a>" (2003), "<a href="Intermission%20%28film%29">Intermission</a>" (2003), "<a href="Red%20Eye%20%282005%20American%20film%29">Red Eye</a>" (2005) and "<a href="Breakfast%20on%20Pluto%20%28film%29">Breakfast on Pluto</a>" (also 2005), for which he was nominated for a <a href="Golden%20Globe">Golden Globe</a> award for <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Musical%20or%20Comedy">Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy</a> and won an <a href="Irish%20Film%20and%20Television%20Award">Irish Film and Television Award</a> for Best Actor.

He played the character of <a href="Scarecrow%20%28DC%20Comics%29">Dr. Jonathan Crane (Scarecrow)</a> in the highly successful films of "Batman <a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Trilogy">The Dark Knight Trilogy</a>" (2005–2012). He starred in "<a href="The%20Wind%20That%20Shakes%20the%20Barley%20%28film%29">The Wind That Shakes the Barley</a>" (2006), "<a href="Sunshine%20%282007%20film%29">Sunshine</a>" (2007), "<a href="The%20Edge%20of%20Love">The Edge of Love</a>" (2008), "<a href="Inception">Inception</a>" (2010) and "<a href="Peacock%20%282010%20film%29">Peacock</a>" (also 2010).

In 2011, Murphy won the <a href="Irish%20Times%20Theatre%20Award">Irish Times Theatre Award</a> for <a href="Best%20Actor">Best Actor</a> and the <a href="Drama%20Desk%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Solo%20Performance">Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Solo Performance</a> for "Misterman". He also became patron of the <a href="UNESCO%23Institutes%20and%20centres">UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre</a> at the <a href="National%20University%20of%20Ireland%20Galway">National University of Ireland Galway</a>. He is closely associated with the work of Professor Pat Dolan, Director UCFRC and UNESCO Chair in Children, Youth and Civic Engagement. He was also in the films "<a href="In%20Time">In Time</a>" (2011), "<a href="Retreat%20%28film%29">Retreat</a>" (2011) and "<a href="Red%20Lights%20%282012%20film%29">Red Lights</a>" (2012).

Since 2013, Murphy has portrayed <a href="Peaky%20Blinders%20%28TV%20series%29%23Cast">Thomas Shelby</a>, the lead of the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> gangster series "<a href="Peaky%20Blinders%20%28TV%20series%29">Peaky Blinders</a>", for which he has won two Best Actor - Drama <a href="Irish%20Film%20and%20Television%20Awards">Irish Film and Television Awards</a> in 2017 and 2018 respectively. He was in the films "<a href="Transcendence%20%282014%20film%29">Transcendence</a>" (2014), "<a href="In%20the%20Heart%20of%20the%20Sea%20%28film%29">In the Heart of the Sea</a>" (2015), "<a href="Anthropoid%20%28film%29">Anthropoid</a>" (2016) and "<a href="Dunkirk%20%282017%20film%29">Dunkirk</a>" (2017).

Cillian Murphy was born in <a href="Douglas%2C%20County%20Cork">Douglas, County Cork</a>, <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> and was raised in <a href="Ballintemple%2C%20Cork">Ballintemple, Cork</a>, Ireland. His father Brendan worked for the <a href="Department%20of%20Education%20and%20Skills%20%28Ireland%29">Irish Department of Education</a>, and his mother was a French teacher. His grandfather, aunts and uncles were teachers, too. Murphy started playing music and writing songs at the age of 10. He has a younger brother, Páidi Murphy, and two younger sisters, Sile Murphy and Orla Murphy.

He was raised <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a>, and attended the Catholic secondary school <a href="Presentation%20Brothers%20College%2C%20Cork">Presentation Brothers College</a>; there he did well academically but got into trouble often, sometimes being suspended, until he decided in his fourth year that misbehaving was not worth the hassle. Not keen on sports, a major part of the school's life, Murphy found that creative pursuits were not fully nurtured at the school. However, it was in secondary school that he got his first taste of performing, when he participated in a drama module presented by Pat Kiernan, the director of the <a href="Corcadorca%20Theatre%20Company">Corcadorca Theatre Company</a>; Murphy later described the experience as a "huge high" and a "fully alive" feeling that he set out to chase. His English teacher, the poet and novelist <a href="William%20Wall%20%28writer%29">William Wall</a>, encouraged him to pursue acting; however, to Murphy, performing meant becoming a rock star.

In his late teens and early twenties, Murphy pursued a career as a musician, singing and playing guitar in several bands alongside his brother, Páidi; the <a href="The%20Beatles">Beatles</a>-obsessed pair named their most successful band 'The Sons of Mr. Greengenes', after a <a href="Hot%20Rats">1969 song</a> by another idol, <a href="Frank%20Zappa">Frank Zappa</a>, which he said "specialised in wacky lyrics and endless guitar solos". They were offered a five-album record deal by <a href="Acid%20Jazz%20Records">Acid Jazz Records</a>, but did not sign the contract; this was owing to Páidi still being in secondary school, and to the small recompense involved in ceding the rights to Murphy's compositions to the record label. Murphy later confessed: "I'm very glad in retrospect that we didn't sign because you kind of sign away your life to a label and the whole of your music."

He began studying law at <a href="University%20College%20Cork">University College Cork</a> (UCC) in 1996, but he failed his first-year exams because, as he put it, he had "no ambitions to do it". Not only was he busy with his band, but he has said that he knew within days after starting at UCC that law was not what he wanted to do. After seeing Corcadorca's stage production of "", directed by Kiernan, acting had begun to pique his interest. His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society's amateur production of "<a href="Observe%20the%20Sons%20of%20Ulster%20Marching%20Towards%20the%20Somme">Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme</a>", which also starred Irish-American comedian <a href="Des%20Bishop">Des Bishop</a>. Murphy also played the lead in a UCC Drama production of "<a href="Little%20Shop%20of%20Horrors%20%28musical%29">Little Shop of Horrors</a>", which was performed in the <a href="Cork%20Opera%20House">Cork Opera House</a>. According to Murphy, his primary motivation then was to party and meet women, not to begin an acting career.

Murphy pressured Pat Kiernan until he got an audition at <a href="Corcadorca%20Theatre%20Company">Corcadorca Theatre Company</a>, and in September 1996, he made his professional acting debut on the stage, playing the part of a volatile Cork teenager in <a href="Enda%20Walsh">Enda Walsh</a>'s "Disco Pigs". Walsh recalled meeting and discovering Murphy: "There was something about him – he was incredibly enigmatic and he would walk into a room with real presence and you'd go, "My God". It had nothing to do with those bloody eyes that everyone's going on about all the time." Murphy observed, "I was unbelievably cocky and had nothing to lose, and it suited the part, I suppose." Originally intended to run for three weeks in Cork, "Disco Pigs" ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for two years, and Murphy left both university and his band. Though he had intended to go back to playing music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of "Disco Pigs", and his acting career began to take off.

He starred in many other theatre productions, including <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="Much%20Ado%20About%20Nothing">Much Ado About Nothing</a>" (1998), "<a href="The%20Country%20Boy">The Country Boy</a>" (1999) and "<a href="Juno%20and%20the%20Paycock">Juno and the Paycock</a>" (also 1999). He began appearing in <a href="independent%20film">independent film</a>s, <a href="%282001%20film%29">On the Edge</a>" (2001), and in <a href="short%20film">short film</a>s, including "Filleann an Feall" (2000) and "Watchmen" (2001). He also reprised his role for the film adaption of "<a href="Disco%20Pigs">Disco Pigs</a>" (2001) and appeared in the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> television mini-series adaptation of "<a href="The%20Way%20We%20Live%20Now%20%282001%20TV%20serial%29">The Way We Live Now</a>".

During this period, he moved from Cork, relocating first to <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> for a few years, then to London in 2001.

In 2002, Murphy starred as Adam in a theatre production of <a href="Neil%20LaBute">Neil LaBute</a>'s "<a href="The%20Shape%20of%20Things">The Shape of Things</a>" at the <a href="Gate%20Theatre">Gate Theatre</a> in Dublin.

He was cast in the lead role in <a href="Danny%20Boyle">Danny Boyle</a>'s horror film "<a href="28%20Days%20Later">28 Days Later</a>" (2002). He portrayed pandemic survivor Jim, who is "perplexed to find himself alone in the desolate, post-apocalyptic world" after waking from a coma in a London hospital. Casting director <a href="Gail%20Stevens">Gail Stevens</a> suggested that Boyle audition Murphy for the role, having been impressed with his performance in "Disco Pigs". Stevens stated that it was only after seeing his slender physique during filming that they decided to feature him fully nude at the beginning of the film. She recalled that Murphy was shy on set with the tendency to look slightly away from the camera, but enthused that he had a "dreamy, slightly de-energised, floating quality that is fantastic for the film." Released in the UK in late 2002, by the following July "28 Days Later" had become a sleeper hit in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> and a major success worldwide, putting Murphy in front of a mass audience for the first time. His performance earned him a nomination for Best Newcomer at the <a href="8th%20Empire%20Awards">8th Empire Awards</a> and Breakthrough Male Performance at the <a href="2004%20MTV%20Movie%20Awards">2004 MTV Movie Awards</a>. Murphy professed that he considered the film to be much deeper than a zombie or horror film, expressing surprise at the film's success and that American audiences responded well to its content and violence.

In 2003, he played the role of Konstantine in a stage production of <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Chekhov</a>'s "<a href="The%20Seagull">The Seagull</a>" at the <a href="Edinburgh%20International%20Festival">Edinburgh International Festival</a>.

He starred as a lovelorn, hapless supermarket stocker who plots a bank heist with <a href="Colin%20Farrell">Colin Farrell</a> in "<a href="Intermission%20%28film%29">Intermission</a>" (2003), which became the highest-grossing Irish independent film in Irish box office history (until "<a href="The%20Wind%20That%20Shakes%20the%20Barley%20%28film%29">The Wind That Shakes the Barley</a>" broke the record in 2006). Reflecting on his roles in "28 Days Later" and the "sad-sack Dublin shelf-stacker" in "Intermission", Sarah Lyall of the "<a href="International%20Herald%20Tribune">International Herald Tribune</a>" stated that Murphy brought "fluent ease to the roles he takes on, a graceful and wholly believable intensity. His delicate good looks have, as much as his acting prowess, caused people to mark him as Ireland's next <a href="Colin%20Farrell">Colin Farrell</a>, albeit one who seems less likely to be caught tomcatting around or brawling drunkenly at premieres". He had a minor supporting role in the successful Hollywood period drama "<a href="Cold%20Mountain%20%28film%29">Cold Mountain</a>" (2003). He portrayed a deserting soldier who shares a grim scene with <a href="Jude%20Law">Jude Law</a>'s character, and was only on location in Romania for a week. Murphy stated that it was a "massive production", remarking that director <a href="Anthony%20Minghella">Anthony Minghella</a> was the calmest director he'd ever met. Murphy also had a role as a butcher in "<a href="Girl%20with%20a%20Pearl%20Earring%20%28film%29">Girl with a Pearl Earring</a>" (2003) with <a href="Scarlett%20Johansson">Scarlett Johansson</a> and <a href="Colin%20Firth">Colin Firth</a>.

In 2004, he toured <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> with the <a href="Druid%20Theatre%20Company">Druid Theatre Company</a>, in "<a href="The%20Playboy%20of%20the%20Western%20World">The Playboy of the Western World</a>" (playing the character of Christy Mahon) under the direction of <a href="Garry%20Hynes">Garry Hynes</a>—who had previously directed Murphy back in 1999 in the theatre productions of "Juno and the Paycock"—and also in "The Country Boy".

Murphy starred as <a href="Scarecrow%20%28DC%20Comics%29">Dr. Jonathan Crane</a> in <a href="Christopher%20Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a>'s "<a href="Batman%20Begins">Batman Begins</a>" (2005). Originally asked to audition for the role of <a href="Batman">Bruce Wayne/Batman</a>, Murphy never saw himself as having the right physique for the superhero, but leapt at the chance to connect with director Nolan. Though the lead went to <a href="Christian%20Bale">Christian Bale</a>, Nolan was so impressed with Murphy that he gave him the supporting role of Dr. Crane, whose alter ego is <a href="supervillain">supervillain</a> <a href="Scarecrow%20%28DC%20Comics%29">Scarecrow</a>. Nolan told "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>", "He has the most extraordinary eyes, and I kept trying to invent excuses for him to take his glasses off in close-ups."

He starred as Jackson Rippner who terrorises <a href="Rachel%20McAdams">Rachel McAdams</a> on an overnight flight in <a href="Wes%20Craven">Wes Craven</a>'s thriller, "<a href="Red%20Eye%20%28American%20film%29">Red Eye</a>" (2005). "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" film critic <a href="Manohla%20Dargis">Manohla Dargis</a> asserted that Murphy made "a picture-perfect villain" and that his "baby blues look cold enough to freeze water and his wolfish leer suggests its own terrors." The film was favourably reviewed and earned almost $100 million worldwide.

Murphy received several awards nominations for his 2005 bad guy turns, among them a nomination as Best Villain at the <a href="MTV%20Movie%20Awards%202006">2006 MTV Movie Awards</a> for "Batman Begins". "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" ranked him among its 2005 "Summer <a href="Most%20valuable%20player">MVPs</a>", a cover story list of 10 entertainers with outstanding breakthrough performances. "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>"'s <a href="David%20Denby%20%28film%20critic%29">David Denby</a> wrote: "Cillian Murphy, who has angelic looks that can turn sinister, is one of the most elegantly seductive monsters in recent movies."

Murphy starred as Patrick/"Kitten" Braden, a <a href="transgender">transgender</a> Irish woman in search of her mother, in <a href="Neil%20Jordan">Neil Jordan</a>'s comedy-drama "<a href="Breakfast%20on%20Pluto%20%28film%29">Breakfast on Pluto</a>" (2005), based on the novel of the same title by <a href="Patrick%20McCabe%20%28novelist%29">Patrick McCabe</a>. Seen against the film's kaleidoscopic backdrop of 1970s <a href="glitter%20rock">glitter rock</a> fashion, magic shows, <a href="red-light%20district">red-light district</a>s and <a href="Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army">IRA</a> violence, Murphy transforms from <a href="androgynous">androgynous</a> teen to high <a href="drag%20%28clothing%29">drag</a> blond bombshell. He had auditioned for the role in 2001, and though Jordan liked him for the part, the director of "<a href="The%20Crying%20Game">The Crying Game</a>" was hesitant to revisit transgender and IRA issues. The actor lobbied Jordan for several years in a bid to get the film made before Murphy became too old to play the part; in 2004, he prepared for the role by meeting a <a href="transvestite">transvestite</a> who dressed him and took him clubbing with other transvestites. The role required "serious primping" with eyebrow plucking and chest and leg hair removal, and <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> noted the way that Murphy played the character with a "bemused and hopeful voice". While even lukewarm reviews of "Breakfast on Pluto" still tended to praise Murphy's performance highly, a few critics dissented: "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", which panned the film, found him "unconvincing" and overly cute.
Murphy was nominated for a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a> for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for "Breakfast on Pluto" and won the fourth <a href="IFTA%20Award">Irish Film and Television Academy</a> Best Actor Award. "<a href="Premiere%20%28magazine%29">Premiere</a>" cited his performance as Kitten in their "The 24 Finest Performances of 2005" feature.

Murphy starred in "<a href="The%20Wind%20That%20Shakes%20the%20Barley%20%28film%29">The Wind That Shakes the Barley</a>" (2006), a film about the <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Irish War of Independence</a> and the <a href="Irish%20Civil%20War">Irish Civil War</a>, which won the <a href="Palme%20d%27Or">Palme d'Or</a> at the <a href="2006%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2006 Cannes Film Festival</a> and became the most successful Irish independent film at the Irish box office. Murphy was especially keen on appearing in the film due to his intimate connections to <a href="Cork%20%28city%29">Cork, Ireland</a>, where the film was shot. Murphy had to audition six times for the role of Damien O'Donovan, a young doctor turned revolutionary, before winning the part. Murphy considered it a very special privilege to have been given the role and stated that he was "tremendously proud" of the film, remarking that the "memories run very, very deep – the politics, the divisions and everybody has stories of family members who were caught up in the struggle." Critic Denby noted Murphy's moments of deep stillness and idiosyncrasies in portraying the character. <a href="Kenneth%20Turan">Kenneth Turan</a> of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" wrote that "Murphy is especially good at playing the zealotry as well as the soul-searching and the regret, at showing us a man who is eaten up alive because he's forced to act in ways that are contrary to his background and his training." "<a href="GQ%20%28magazine%29">GQ UK</a>" presented Murphy with its 2006 Actor of the Year award for his work in "The Wind That Shakes the Barley".

Murphy returned to the stage opposite <a href="Neve%20Campbell">Neve Campbell</a> at the <a href="Ambassadors%20Theatre%20%28London%29">New Ambassadors Theatre</a> in London's West End from November 2006 to February 2007, playing the lead role of John Kolvenbach's play "Love Song". "Theatre Record" described his character of Beane as a "winsomely cranky" mentally unstable "sentimentalised lonely hero", noting how he magnetically, with "all blue eyes and twitching hands", moves "comically from painfully shy "wallpaper" to garrulous, amorous male." "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" considered his performance to be "as magnetic onstage as onscreen", remarking that his "unhurried puzzlement pulls the slight preciousness in the character's idiot-savant naivete back from the brink".

He starred in the science fiction film "<a href="Sunshine%20%282007%20film%29">Sunshine</a>" (2007) as a physicist-astronaut charged with re-igniting the sun, which teamed him up again with director <a href="Danny%20Boyle">Danny Boyle</a>. He starred opposite <a href="Lucy%20Liu">Lucy Liu</a> in <a href="Paul%20Soter">Paul Soter</a>'s romantic comedy "<a href="Watching%20the%20Detectives%20%28film%29">Watching the Detectives</a>" (2007); the <a href="independent%20film">indie film</a> premiered at the 2007 <a href="Tribeca%20Film%20Festival">Tribeca Film Festival</a> and was then released straight to DVD. Murphy had starred as <a href="Richard%20Neville%20%28writer%29">Richard Neville</a>, editor of the psychedelic radical underground magazine "<a href="Oz%20%28magazine%29">Oz</a>" in the film "<a href="Hippie%20Hippie%20Shake">Hippie Hippie Shake</a>", which was shot in 2007, but the project, much delayed, was eventually shelved in 2011.

Murphy made a brief re-appearance as the Scarecrow in Nolan's "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20%28film%29">The Dark Knight</a>" (2008), the sequel to "Batman Begins", before starring in "<a href="The%20Edge%20of%20Love">The Edge of Love</a>"—about a love quadrangle involving the poet <a href="Dylan%20Thomas">Dylan Thomas</a>—with <a href="Keira%20Knightley">Keira Knightley</a>, <a href="Sienna%20Miller">Sienna Miller</a> and <a href="Matthew%20Rhys">Matthew Rhys</a>. Murphy also made a debut appearance in another medium—on a postage stamp: in July 2008, the Irish Post Office, <a href="An%20Post">An Post</a>, released a series of four stamps paying homage to the creativity of films recently produced in Ireland, including one featuring Murphy in a still from "The Wind That Shakes the Barley". In 2009, Murphy starred opposite rock singer <a href="Feist%20%28singer%29">Feist</a> and actor <a href="David%20Fox%20%28actor%29">David Fox</a> in "<a href="The%20Water%20%28short%20film%29">The Water</a>", directed by <a href="Kevin%20Drew">Kevin Drew</a> of <a href="Broken%20Social%20Scene">Broken Social Scene</a>. The 15-minute Canadian short film, released online in April 2009, is nearly silent until the Feist song of the same title plays close to the end. Murphy was attracted to the role as a fan of Broken Social Scene and the prospect of making a silent movie, which he considered to be the "hardest test for any actor". Murphy also starred in "<a href="Perrier%27s%20Bounty">Perrier's Bounty</a>", a crime dramedy from the makers of "Intermission", in which he portrayed a petty criminal on the run from a gangster played by <a href="Brendan%20Gleeson">Brendan Gleeson</a>.

In 2010, he also made a return to theatre in "From Galway to Broadway and back again", which was a stage show that celebrated the <a href="Druid%20Theatre%20Company">Druid Theatre Company</a>'s 35th birthday.

The direct-to-video psychological thriller "<a href="Peacock%20%282010%20film%29">Peacock</a>" (2010), co-starring <a href="Ellen%20Page">Ellen Page</a>, <a href="Susan%20Sarandon">Susan Sarandon</a> and <a href="Bill%20Pullman">Bill Pullman</a>, starred Murphy as a man with a split personality who fools people into believing he is also his own wife. Christian Toto of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Times">The Washington Times</a>" referred to the film as "a handsomely mounted psychological drama with an arresting lead turn by Cillian Murphy", and noted that although Murphy wasn't a stranger to playing in drag, his work in the film set a "new standard for gender-bending performances".

Murphy next starred in <a href="Christopher%20Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a>'s "<a href="Inception">Inception</a>" (2010), playing entrepreneur Robert Fischer, whose mind is infiltrated by DiCaprio's character Cobb to convince him to dissolve his business. That year, Murphy also made an uncredited cameo appearance as programmer Edward Dillinger Jr., son of original "<a href="Tron">Tron</a>" antagonist Ed Dillinger (<a href="David%20Warner%20%28actor%29">David Warner</a>) in "".

In 2011, Murphy performed in the stage <a href="monodrama">monodrama</a> "Misterman", written and directed by <a href="Enda%20Walsh">Enda Walsh</a>, whom Murphy previously worked with on "Disco Pigs". The production was initially put on in <a href="Galway">Galway</a> and
was then taken to <a href="St.%20Ann%27s%20Warehouse">St. Ann's Warehouse</a> in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, New York City. Murphy commented of the role, "The live nature of it makes it so dangerous. You're only there because of the good will of the audience, and that's compounded by its being a one-man show". His performance earned critical acclaim, garnering <a href="Irish%20Times%20Theatre%20Awards">Irish Times Theatre Award</a> and a <a href="Drama%20Desk%20Award">Drama Desk Award</a>. Sarak Lyall of the "International Herald Tribune" described Murphy's character Thomas Magill to be a "complicated mixture of sympathetic and not nice at all – deeply wounded, but with a dangerous, skewed moral code", praising his ability to mimic wickedly. Lyall noted Murphy's "unusual ability to create and inhabit creepy yet fascinating characters from the big screen to the small stage in the intense one-man show "Misterman"", and documented that on one evening the "theater was flooded, not with applause but with silence", eventually culminating in a standing ovation at his powerful performance. He played the lead in the British horror film "<a href="Retreat%20%28film%29">Retreat</a>" (2011), which had a <a href="limited%20release">limited release</a>. He also appeared in the science fiction film "<a href="In%20Time">In Time</a>" (2011), starring <a href="Justin%20Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a> and <a href="Amanda%20Seyfried">Amanda Seyfried</a>, which was poorly reviewed.

Murphy starred in "<a href="Red%20Lights%20%282012%20film%29">Red Lights</a>" (2012) with <a href="Robert%20De%20Niro">Robert De Niro</a> and <a href="Sigourney%20Weaver">Sigourney Weaver</a>. He played Tom Buckley, the assistant to Weaver's character who is a paranormal investigator. Murphy considered working with De Niro to have been one of the most intimidating moments in his career. He remarked: "My first scene when I come to visit him my character is supposed to be terrified and intimidated. There was no acting involved. The man has presence. You can't act presence. I'll never have that. Watching him use it...when you put a camera on it, it just becomes something else."
The film was panned by critics and did not make its budget back at the box office. Murphy then went on to reprise his role as the Scarecrow for the third time in "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Rises">The Dark Knight Rises</a>" (2012), and had a supporting role as Mike, the favourite teacher of the main character Skunk, in the British independent film "<a href="Broken%20%282012%20film%29">Broken</a>" (2012). His performance earned him a <a href="BIFA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">British Independent Film Award for Best Supporting Actor</a> nomination.

Since 2013, Murphy has played the lead role in the BBC television series "<a href="Peaky%20Blinders%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Peaky Blinders</a>", a series about a criminal gang in post-First World War Birmingham. He explained his enthusiasm for the show in an interview with "The Independent": "[the scripts] were so compelling and confident, and the character was so rich and complex, layered and contradictory. I was like, 'I have to do this.'" "Peaky Blinders" was critically praised and a ratings success. A second series began broadcasting on the BBC in October 2014. Also in 2013, Murphy made his directorial debut with a music video for the band Money's single "Hold Me Forever". The video features dancers from the <a href="English%20National%20Ballet">English National Ballet</a> and was filmed at <a href="The%20Old%20Vic%20Theatre">The Old Vic Theatre</a> in London.

In 2014, he co-starred in the film "<a href="Aloft%20%28film%29">Aloft</a>", with <a href="Jennifer%20Connelly">Jennifer Connelly</a>, and <a href="Wally%20Pfister">Wally Pfister</a>'s "<a href="Transcendence%20%282014%20film%29">Transcendence</a>", which also starred <a href="Johnny%20Depp">Johnny Depp</a> and <a href="Rebecca%20Hall">Rebecca Hall</a>. Murphy also reunited with Enda Walsh for the play "<a href="Ballyturk">Ballyturk</a>" in 2014. He starred in <a href="Ron%20Howard">Ron Howard</a>'s 2015 film, "<a href="In%20the%20Heart%20of%20the%20Sea%20%28film%29">In the Heart of the Sea</a>", which also features <a href="Benjamin%20Walker%20%28actor%29">Benjamin Walker</a> and <a href="Chris%20Hemsworth">Chris Hemsworth</a>. Cillian contributed spoken vocals to the tracks "8:58" and "The Clock" from <a href="Paul%20Hartnoll">Paul Hartnoll</a>'s album "" (2015). The two previously met whilst Hartnoll was scoring the second season of "Peaky Blinders". Murphy portrayed <a href="Czechoslovak">Czechoslovak</a> <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> army soldier <a href="Jozef%20Gab%C4%8D%C3%ADk">Jozef Gabčík</a>, who was involved in <a href="Operation%20Anthropoid">Operation Anthropoid</a>, the assassination of <a href="Reinhard%20Heydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</a> in "<a href="Anthropoid%20%28film%29">Anthropoid</a>" (2016).

Murphy played a <a href="Shell%20shock">shell-shocked</a> army officer who is recovered from a wrecked ship in <a href="Christopher%20Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a>'s war film, "<a href="Dunkirk%20%282017%20film%29">Dunkirk</a>" (2017). Murphy felt his character, who is nameless and was credited simply as "Shivering Soldier", was "representative of something experienced by thousands of soldiers, which is the profound emotional and psychological toll that war can have".

Music is still an important part of Murphy's life. In 2004 he said, "The only extravagant thing about my lifestyle is my stereo system, buying music and going to gigs." He no longer plays in a rock band, but regularly plays music with friends and on his own, and still writes songs. Murphy does not plan to start another band, and said, "Even if I was good, the very notion of being an actor with a rock band on the side would mean I'd never be taken seriously."

He was a <a href="vegetarian">vegetarian</a> for many years, not due to any moral objection to the killing of animals, but because of qualms about unhealthy <a href="agribusiness">agribusiness</a> practices. He began eating meat again for his role in "<a href="Peaky%20Blinders%20%28TV%20series%29">Peaky Blinders</a>". He is a dedicated <a href="running">runner</a>.

He often works in or near the city, and has expressed no desire to move to <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>. He prefers not to speak about his personal life, and did not appear on any live TV chat shows until 2010, when he was a guest on "The Late Late Show" on Ireland's RTÉ to promote "Perrier's Bounty", yet still remained reserved. He does not have a stylist or a personal publicist, travels without an entourage, and often attends premieres alone. Reserved and private, Murphy professes a lack of interest in the celebrity scene, finding the red carpet experience "a challenge... and not one I want to overcome". He intentionally practices a lifestyle that will not interest the tabloids: "I haven't created any controversy, I don't sleep around, I don't go and fall down drunk". Murphy is friends with fellow Irish actors <a href="Colin%20Farrell">Colin Farrell</a>, <a href="Jonathan%20Rhys%20Meyers">Jonathan Rhys Meyers</a> and <a href="Liam%20Neeson">Liam Neeson</a>, looking up to the latter like a "surrogate movie dad". But primarily, Murphy's close friendships are those he made before becoming a star.

In 2015, he was named one of <a href="GQ">GQ</a>'s 50 best dressed men.

In mid-2004, Murphy married his long-time girlfriend, <a href="Yvonne%20McGuinness">Yvonne McGuinness</a>, whom he had met in 1996 at one of his rock band's shows. The couple live in <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> (where Murphy moved back in 2015 after previously living for 14 years in <a href="London%2C%20England">London</a>) and have two sons, Malachy, born in December 2005, and, Aran, born in July 2007.

Regarding religion, Murphy had previously been verging on <a href="Agnosticism">agnostic</a>, but confirmed his <a href="atheism">atheism</a> after researching his role as a nuclear physicist/astronaut in the science fiction film "<a href="Sunshine%20%282007%20film%29">Sunshine</a>" (2007).

His political activity includes participating in the 2007 <a href="Rock%20the%20Vote">Rock the Vote</a> Ireland campaign, targeting young voters for the general election, and campaigning for the rights of the <a href="homeless">homeless</a> with the organisation <a href="Focus%20Ireland">Focus Ireland</a>. In 2011, he became a patron of the <a href="http%3A//www.childandfamilyresearch.ie/">UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre</a> at the <a href="National%20University%20of%20Ireland%20Galway">National University of Ireland Galway</a>. He is closely associated with the work of Professor Pat Dolan Director UCFRC and UNESCO Chair in Children, Youth and Civic Engagement. In February 2012, he wrote a message of support to the <a href="Vita%20Cortex%20sit-in">former Vita Cortex workers involved in a sit-in at their plant</a>, congratulating them for "highlighting [what] is hugely important to us all as a nation".

Operation Cobra

Operation Cobra was the codename for an offensive launched by the <a href="First%20United%20States%20Army">First United States Army</a> (Lieutenant General <a href="Omar%20Bradley">Omar Bradley</a>) seven weeks after the <a href="D-Day">D-Day</a> landings, during the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Normandy">Normandy Campaign</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The intention was to take advantage of the distraction of the Germans by the British and Canadian attacks around <a href="Caen">Caen</a>, in <a href="Operation%20Goodwood">Operation Goodwood</a> and break through the German defenses that were penning in his troops, while the Germans were unbalanced. Once a corridor had been created, the First Army would then be able to advance into <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>, rolling up the German flanks once free of the constraints of the <a href="bocage">bocage</a> country. After a slow start the offensive gathered momentum and German resistance collapsed as scattered remnants of broken units fought to escape to the <a href="Seine">Seine</a>. Lacking the resources to cope with the situation, the German response was ineffectual and the entire Normandy front soon collapsed. Operation Cobra, together with concurrent offensives by the British <a href="Second%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Second Army</a> and the Canadian <a href="First%20Canadian%20Army">First Army</a>, was decisive in securing an Allied victory in the Normandy Campaign.

Having been delayed several times by poor weather, Operation Cobra commenced on 25 July, with a concentrated <a href="strategic%20bombing">aerial bombardment</a> from thousands of <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> aircraft. Supporting offensives had drawn the bulk of German armored reserves toward the British and Canadian sector and coupled with the general lack of men and <a href="materiel">materiel</a> available to the Germans, it was impossible for them to form successive lines of defense. Units of the U.S. <a href="VII%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">VII Corps</a> led the initial two-division assault, while other First U.S. Army corps mounted supporting attacks designed to pin German units in place. Progress was slow on the first day but opposition started to crumble once the defensive crust had been broken. By 27 July, most organized resistance had been overcome and the VII and <a href="VIII%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">VIII Corps</a> advanced rapidly, isolating the <a href="Cotentin%20Peninsula">Cotentin Peninsula</a>.

By 31 July, <a href="XIX%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">XIX Corps</a> had destroyed the last forces opposing the First Army, which emerged from the bocage. Reinforcements were moved west by <a href="Field%20Marshal%20%28Germany%29">Field Marshal</a> <a href="G%C3%BCnther%20von%20Kluge">Günther von Kluge</a> and employed in various counterattacks, the largest of which, <a href="Operation%20L%C3%BCttich">"Unternehmen Lüttich"</a> (Operation Liège), was launched on 7 August between <a href="Mortain">Mortain</a> and <a href="Avranches">Avranches</a>. Although this led to the bloodiest phase of the battle, it was mounted by already exhausted and understrength units and was a costly failure. On 8 August, troops of the newly activated <a href="Third%20United%20States%20Army">Third United States Army</a> captured the city of <a href="Le%20Mans">Le Mans</a>, formerly the German <a href="7th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">7th Army</a> headquarters. Operation Cobra transformed the high-intensity infantry combat of Normandy into rapid maneuver warfare and led to the creation of the <a href="Falaise%20pocket">Falaise pocket</a> and the loss of the German position in northwestern France.

Following the successful <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Normandy">invasion of Normandy</a> on 6 June 1944, progress inland was slow. To facilitate the Allied build-up in France and to secure room for further expansion, the <a href="deep%20water%20port">deep water port</a> of <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a> on the western flank of the American sector and the historic town of <a href="Caen">Caen</a> in the British and Canadian sector to the east, were early objectives. The original plan for the Normandy campaign envisioned strong offensive efforts in both sectors, in which the <a href="Second%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Second Army</a> (<a href="Lieutenant-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="Knight">Sir</a> <a href="Miles%20Dempsey">Miles Dempsey</a>) would secure Caen and the area south of it and the <a href="First%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">First US Army</a> (<a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Omar%20Bradley">Omar Bradley</a>) would "wheel round" to the <a href="River%20Loire">Loire</a>.

<a href="General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">General</a> <a href="Knight">Sir</a> <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Montgomery%20of%20Alamein">Bernard Montgomery</a>—commanding all Allied ground forces in Normandy—intended Caen to be taken on D-Day, while Cherbourg was expected to fall 15 days later. The Second Army was to seize Caen and then form a front to the southeast, extending to <a href="Caumont-l%27%C3%89vent%C3%A9">Caumont-l'Éventé</a>, to acquire airfields and protect the left flank of the First US Army as it moved on Cherbourg. Possession of Caen and its surroundings—desirable for open terrain that would permit maneuver warfare—would also give the Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture <a href="Falaise%2C%20Calvados">Falaise</a>, which could be used as the pivot for a swing right to advance on <a href="Argentan">Argentan</a> and then the <a href="Touques%20River">Touques River</a>. Caen's capture has been described by historian L. F. Ellis as the most important <a href="Normandy%20landings">D-Day</a> objective assigned to Lieutenant-General <a href="John%20Crocker">Crocker's</a> <a href="I%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British I Corps</a>. Ellis and <a href="Chester%20Wilmot">Chester Wilmot</a> called the Allied plan "ambitious" since the Caen sector contained the strongest defences in Normandy.
The initial attempt by I Corps to reach the city on D-Day was blocked by elements of the <a href="21st%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">21st Panzer Division</a> and with the Germans committing most of the reinforcements sent to meet the invasion to the defense of Caen, the Anglo-Canadian front rapidly congealed short of Second Army's objectives. <a href="Operation%20Perch">Operation Perch</a> in the week following D-Day and <a href="Operation%20Epsom">Operation Epsom</a> (26–30 June) brought some territorial gains and depleted its defenders but Caen remained in German hands until <a href="Operation%20Charnwood">Operation Charnwood</a> (7–9 July), when the Second Army managed to take the northern part of the city up to the <a href="River%20Orne">River Orne</a> in a frontal assault.

The successive Anglo-Canadian offensives around Caen kept the best of the German forces in Normandy, including most of the available armor, to the eastern end of the Allied <a href="lodgement">lodgement</a>, but even so the First US Army made slow progress against dogged German resistance. In part, operations were slow due to the constraints of the <a href="bocage">bocage</a> landscape of densely packed banked hedgerows, sunken lanes, and small woods, for which U.S. units had not trained. With no port facilities in Allied hands, all reinforcement and supply had to take place over the beaches via the two <a href="Mulberry%20harbour">Mulberry harbors</a> and was at the mercy of the weather. On 19 June, a severe storm descended on the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>, lasting for three days, and causing significant delays to the Allied build-up and the cancellation of some planned operations. The First US Army advance in the western sector was eventually halted by Bradley before the town of <a href="Saint-L%C3%B4">Saint-Lô</a>, to concentrate on the seizure of Cherbourg. The defense of Cherbourg consisted largely of four battlegroups formed from the remnants of units that had retreated up the Cotentin peninsula but the port defenses had been designed principally to meet an attack from the sea. Organized German resistance ended only on 27 June, when the <a href="9th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">9th US Infantry Division</a> managed to reduce the defences of Cap-de-la-Hague, north-west of the city. Within four days, <a href="VII%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">VII Corps</a> (<a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="J.%20Lawton%20Collins">J. Lawton Collins</a>) resumed the offensive toward Saint-Lô, alongside <a href="XIX%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">XIX Corps</a> and <a href="VIII%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">VIII Corps</a>, causing the Germans to move additional armor into the U.S. sector.

The originator of the idea for Operation Cobra is disputed. According to Montgomery's official biographer, the foundation of Operation Cobra was laid on 13 June. Planning was immensely aided by detailed <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a> intelligence which supplied up-to-date decodes of communications between "<a href="Oberkommando%20der%20Wehrmacht">Oberkommando der Wehrmacht</a>" (OKW, the German armed forces high command) and Hitler's generals. Montgomery's plan at that time called for the U.S. First Army to take Saint-Lô and <a href="Coutances">Coutances</a> and then make two southward thrusts; one from <a href="Caumont-l%27%C3%89vent%C3%A9">Caumont</a> toward <a href="Vire">Vire</a> and <a href="Mortain">Mortain</a> and the other from Saint-Lô toward <a href="Villedieu-les-Po%C3%AAles">Villedieu</a> and <a href="Avranches">Avranches</a>. Although pressure was to be kept up along the Cotentin Peninsula towards <a href="La%20Haye-du-Puits">La Haye-du-Puits</a> and <a href="Valognes">Valognes</a>, the capture of Cherbourg was not the priority. With the capture of Cherbourg by VII Corps on 27 June, Montgomery's initial timetable was overtaken by events and the thrust from Caumont was never adopted.

Following the conclusion of Operation Charnwood and the cancellation of the First Army offensive towards Saint-Lô, Montgomery met with Bradley and Dempsey on 10 July to discuss plans for the <a href="21st%20Army%20Group">21st Army Group</a>. Bradley said that progress on the western flank was very slow but that plans had been laid for another breakout attempt, codenamed Operation Cobra, to be launched by the First Army on 18 July. Montgomery approved the plan and that the strategy would remain the diversion of German attention from the First Army to the British and Canadian sector. Dempsey was instructed to "go on hitting, drawing the German strength, especially the armour, onto yourself—so as to ease the way for Brad". To accomplish this, Operation Goodwood was planned and Eisenhower ensured that both operations would have the support of the Allied strategic bombers.
On 12 July, Bradley briefed his commanders on the Cobra plan, which consisted of three phases. The main effort would be under the control of VII Corps. In the first phase, the breakthrough attack would be conducted by the <a href="9th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">9th Infantry Division</a> (Major General <a href="Manton%20S.%20Eddy">Manton S. Eddy</a>) and the <a href="30th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">30th Infantry Division</a> (Major General <a href="Leland%20Hobbs">Leland Hobbs</a>), which would break into the German defensive zone and then hold the flanks of the penetration while the <a href="1st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Infantry Division</a> (Major General <a href="Clarence%20Huebner">Clarence Huebner</a>) and <a href="2nd%20Armored%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Armored Division</a> (Major General <a href="Edward%20H.%20Brooks">Edward H. Brooks</a>) pushed into the depth of the position until resistance collapsed. The 1st Infantry Division "was to take Marigny, with this objective exploited by a stream of General Watson's 3rd Armored Division armor that would move south toward Coutances". The 2nd Armored Division—part of "Collins' exploitation force" of the 2nd Armored Division in the east of the VII Corps sector and the "1st Infantry Division reinforced by <a href="Combat%20Command">Combat Command</a> B (CCB) of the 3rd Armored division in the west"—would "pass through the 30th Infantry Division sector ... and guard the overall American left flank." If VII Corps succeeded, the western German position would become untenable, permitting a relatively easy advance to the southwest end of the bocage to cut off and seize the <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> peninsula. First Army intelligence estimated that no German counterattack would occur in the first few days after Cobra's launch and that if they did later, they would be no more than battalion-sized operations.

Cobra was to be a concentrated attack on a front, unlike previous American broad front offensives and would have a mass of air support. Fighter-bombers would concentrate on hitting forward German defenses in a belt immediately south of the Saint-Lô–Periers road, while General <a href="Carl%20Andrew%20Spaatz">Spaatz</a>'s heavy bombers would bomb to a depth of behind the German main line of resistance. It was anticipated that the physical destruction and shock value of a short, intense preliminary bombardment would greatly weaken the German defense so in addition to divisional artillery, Army- and Corps-level units would provide support, including nine heavy, five medium and seven light artillery battalions. Over 1,000 divisional and corps artillery pieces were committed to the offensive and approximately 140,000 artillery rounds were allocated to the operation in VII Corps, with another 27,000 for VIII Corps.

To overcome the constraints of the bocage that had made attacks so difficult and costly for both sides, <a href="Rhino%20Tank">Rhino</a> modifications were made to some <a href="M4%20Sherman">M4 Sherman</a>, <a href="Stuart%20tank">M5A1 Stuart</a> tanks and <a href="M10%20Tank%20Destroyer">M10 tank destroyers</a>, by fitting them with hedge-breaching 'tusks' that could force a path through hedgerows. German tanks remained restricted to the roads but U.S. armored vehicles could maneuver more freely, although the effectiveness of the devices was exaggerated. By the eve of Cobra, 60 percent of the tanks of the First Army had the rhino modification. To preserve operational security, Bradley forbade their use until Cobra was launched. In all, 1,269 M4 medium tanks, 694 M5A1 light tanks and 288 M10 tank destroyers were available.

On 18 July, the British <a href="VIII%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">VIII</a> and <a href="I%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">I Corps</a>—to the east of Caen—launched Operation Goodwood. The offensive began with the largest air bombardment in support of ground forces yet, with more than 1,000 aircraft dropping of high explosive and fragmentation bombs from low altitude. German positions to the east of Caen were shelled by 400 artillery pieces and many villages were reduced to rubble but German artillery further to the south, on the <a href="Bourgu%C3%A9bus">Bourguébus Ridge</a>, was outside the range of the British artillery and the defenders of <a href="Cagny%2C%20Calvados">Cagny</a> and <a href="%C3%89mi%C3%A9ville">Émiéville</a> were largely unscathed by the bombardment. This contributed to the losses suffered by Second Army, which sustained over 4,800 casualties. Principally an armored offensive, between 250 and 400 British tanks were put out of action, although recent examination suggests that only 140 were completely destroyed with an additional 174 damaged. The operation remains the largest tank battle ever fought by the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> and resulted in the expansion of the Orne bridgehead and the capture of Caen on the south bank of the Orne.

Simultaneously, the <a href="II%20Canadian%20Corps">II Canadian Corps</a> on the western flank of Goodwood began <a href="Operation%20Atlantic">Operation Atlantic</a> to strengthen the Allied foothold along the banks of the Orne river and take Verrières Ridge to the south of Caen. Atlantic made initial gains but ran out of steam as casualties mounted. Having cost the Canadians 1,349 men and with the heavily defended ridge firmly in German hands, Atlantic was closed down on 20 July. At Montgomery's urging, "strongly underlined in the Supreme Commander's communications to Montgomery", the II Canadian Corps commander, <a href="Lieutenant-general%20%28Canada%29">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="Guy%20Simonds">Guy Simonds</a>, began a second offensive a few days later, codenamed <a href="Operation%20Spring">Operation Spring</a>. This had the limited but important aim of tying down German units to prevent them from being transferred to the American sector, although Simonds took the opportunity to make another bid for Verrières Ridge. Again the <a href="Battle%20of%20Verri%C3%A8res%20Ridge">fighting for Verrières Ridge</a> proved extremely bloody for the Canadians, with 25 July marking the costliest day for a Canadian battalion—<a href="The%20Black%20Watch%20%28Royal%20Highland%20Regiment%29%20of%20Canada">The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada</a>—since the Dieppe Raid of 1942. A counterstroke by two German divisions pushed the Canadians back past their start lines and Simonds had to commit reinforcements to stabilize the front. With Goodwood, the Canadian operations caused the Germans to commit most of their armor and reinforcements to the eastern sector. Operation Spring—despite its cost—had drawn the <a href="9th%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Hohenstaufen">9th SS Panzer Division</a> away from the U.S. sector on the eve of Operation Cobra. Only two "Panzer" divisions with 190 tanks now faced the First Army. Seven "Panzer" divisions with 750 tanks were around Caen, far away from Operation Cobra as were all the heavy <a href="Tiger%20I">Tiger tank</a> battalions and the three "<a href="Nebelwerfer">Nebelwerfer</a>" brigades in Normandy.

Each division consumed of supplies daily.

To gain good terrain for Operation Cobra, Bradley and Collins conceived a plan to push forward to the Saint-Lô–Periers road, along which VII and VIII Corps were securing jumping-off positions. On 18 July, at a cost of 5,000 casualties, the American <a href="29th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">29th</a> and <a href="35th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">35th Infantry Divisions</a> managed to gain the vital heights of Saint-Lô, driving back "General der Fallschirmtruppen" <a href="Eugen%20Meindl">Eugen Meindl</a>'s II Parachute Corps. Meindl's paratroopers, together with the <a href="352nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">352nd Infantry Division</a> (which had been in action since its D-Day defense of <a href="Omaha%20Beach">Omaha Beach</a>) were now in ruins, and the stage for the main offensive was set. Due to poor weather conditions that had also been hampering Goodwood and Atlantic, Bradley decided to postpone Cobra for a few days—a decision that worried Montgomery, as the British and Canadian operations had been launched to support a break-out attempt that was failing to materialize. By 24 July the skies had cleared enough for the start order to be given, and 1,600 Allied aircraft took off for Normandy. However, the weather closed in again over the battlefield. Under poor visibility conditions, more than 25 Americans were killed and 130 wounded in the bombing before the air support operation was postponed until the following day. Some enraged soldiers opened fire on their own aircraft, a not uncommon practice in Normandy when suffering from friendly fire.

After the one-day postponement, Cobra got underway at 09:38 on 25 July, when around 600 Allied fighter-bombers attacked strongpoints and enemy artillery along a -wide strip of ground located in the <a href="St.%20L%C3%B4">St. Lô</a> area. For the next hour, 1,800 heavy bombers of the U.S. <a href="Eighth%20Air%20Force">Eighth Air Force</a> saturated a area on the Saint-Lô–Periers road, succeeded by a third and final wave of medium bombers. Approximately 3,000 U.S. aircraft had <a href="Carpet%20bombing">carpet-bombed</a> a narrow section of the front, with the "<a href="Panzer-Lehr-Division">Panzer-Lehr-Division</a>" taking the brunt of the attack. However, once again not all the casualties were German; Bradley had specifically requested that the bombers approach the target from the east, out of the sun and parallel to the Saint-Lô–Periers road, in order to minimize the risk of friendly losses, but most of the airmen instead came in from the north, perpendicular to the front line. Bradley, however, had apparently misunderstood explanations from the heavy bomber commanders that a parallel approach was impossible because of the time and space constraints Bradley had set. Additionally, a parallel approach would not in any event have assured that all bombs would fall behind German lines because of deflection errors or obscured aim points due to dust and smoke. Despite efforts by U.S. units to identify their positions, inaccurate bombing by the Eighth Air Force killed 111 men and wounded 490. The dead included Bradley's friend and fellow West Pointer Lieutenant General <a href="Lesley%20J.%20McNair">Lesley McNair</a>—the highest-ranking U.S. soldier to be killed in action in the <a href="European%20Theater%20of%20Operations">European Theater of Operations</a>.

By 11:00, the infantry began to move forward, advancing from crater to crater beyond what had been the German outpost line. Although no serious opposition was forecast, the remnants of <a href="Fritz%20Bayerlein">Fritz Bayerlein</a>′s "Panzer Lehr"—consisting of roughly 2,200 men and 45 armored vehicles—had regrouped and were prepared to meet the advancing U.S. troops, and to the west of "Panzer Lehr" the German 5th Parachute Division had escaped the bombing almost intact. Collins' VII Corps were quite disheartened to meet fierce enemy artillery fire, which they expected to have been suppressed by the bombing. Several U.S. units found themselves entangled in fights against strongpoints held by a handful of German tanks, supporting infantry and <a href="88%20mm%20gun">gun</a>s—VII Corps gained only during the rest of the day. However, if the first day's results had been disappointing, General Collins found cause for encouragement; although the Germans were fiercely holding their positions, these did not seem to form a continuous line and were susceptible to being outflanked or bypassed. Even with prior warning of the American offensive, the British and Canadian actions around Caen had convinced the Germans that the real threat lay there, and tied down their available forces to such an extent that a succession of meticulously prepared defensive positions in depth, as encountered during Goodwood and Atlantic, were not created to meet Cobra.
On the morning of 26 July, the U.S. <a href="2nd%20Armored%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Armored Division</a> and the veteran <a href="1st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Infantry Division</a> joined the attack as planned, reaching one of Cobra's first objectives—a road junction north of <a href="Le%20Mesnil-Herman">Le Mesnil-Herman</a>—the following day. Also on the 26th, Major General <a href="Troy%20H.%20Middleton">Troy H. Middleton</a>'s VIII Corps entered the battle, led by the <a href="8th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">8th</a> and 90th Infantry Divisions. Despite clear paths of advance through the floods and swamps across their front, both divisions initially disappointed the First Army by failing to gain significant ground, but first light the next morning revealed that the Germans had been compelled to retreat by their crumbling left flank, leaving only immense minefields to delay VIII Corps' advance. By noon on 27 July, the 9th Infantry Division of VII Corps was also clear of any organized German resistance, and was advancing rapidly.

By 28 July, the German defenses across the U.S. front had largely collapsed under the full weight of VII and VIII Corps' advance, and resistance was disorganised and patchy. VIII Corps' <a href="4th%20Armored%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">4th Armored Division</a>—entering combat for the first time—captured Coutances but met stiff opposition east of the town, and U.S. units penetrating into the depth of the German positions were variously counterattacked by elements of the <a href="2nd%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Das%20Reich">2nd SS Panzer</a>, <a href="17th%20SS%20Panzergrenadier%20Division%20G%C3%B6tz%20von%20Berlichingen">17th SS Panzergrenadier</a>, and 353rd Infantry Divisions, all seeking to escape entrapment. A desperate counterattack was mounted against the 2nd Armored Division by German remnants, but this was a disaster and the Germans abandoned their vehicles and fled on foot. An exhausted and demoralized Bayerlein reported that his "Panzer Lehr Division" was "finally annihilated", with its armor wiped out, its personnel either casualties or missing, and all headquarters records lost.
Meanwhile, Marshal von Kluge—commanding all German forces on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Western Front</a> ("<a href="OB%20West">Oberbefehlshaber West</a>")—was mustering reinforcements, and elements of the <a href="2nd%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">2nd</a> and <a href="116th%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">116th Panzer Divisions</a> were approaching the battlefield. The U.S. XIX Corps—led by Major General <a href="Charles%20H.%20Corlett">Charles H. Corlett</a>—entered the battle on 28 July on the left of VII Corps, and between 28 and 31 July became embroiled with these reinforcements in the fiercest fighting since Cobra began. During the night of 29 July near <a href="Saint-Denis-le-Gast">Saint-Denis-le-Gast</a>, to the east of Coutances, elements of the U.S. 2nd Armored Division found themselves fighting for their lives against a German column from the 2nd SS Panzer and 17th SS Panzergrenadier Divisions, which passed through the American lines in the darkness. Other elements of the 2nd Armored were attacked near Cambry and fought for six hours; however, Bradley and his commanders knew that they were currently dominating the battlefield and such desperate assaults were no threat to the overall American position. When ordered to concentrate his division, Colonel <a href="Heinz%20G%C3%BCnther%20Guderian">Heinz Günther Guderian</a>—116th Division's senior staff officer—was frustrated by the high level of Allied fighter-bomber activity. Without receiving direct support from the 2nd Panzer Division as promised, Guderian stated that his panzergrenadiers could not successfully counterattack the Americans. Advancing southward along the coast, later that day, the U.S. VIII Corps seized the town of Avranches—described by historian Andrew Williams as "the gateway to Brittany and southern Normandy"—and by 31 July XIX Corps had thrown back the last German counterattacks after fierce fighting, inflicting heavy losses in men and tanks. The American advance was now relentless, and the First Army was finally free of the bocage.

On 30 July, to protect Cobra's flank and prevent the disengagement and relocation of further German forces, the British <a href="VIII%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">VIII Corps</a> and <a href="XXX%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XXX Corps</a> launched <a href="Operation%20Bluecoat">Operation Bluecoat</a> south from <a href="Caumont-l%27%C3%89vent%C3%A9">Caumont</a> toward <a href="Vire">Vire</a> and <a href="Mont%20Pin%C3%A7on">Mont Pinçon</a>. Bluecoat kept German armoured units fixed on the British eastern front and continued the wearing down of the strength of German armoured formations in the area. The breakthrough in the centre of the Allied front surprised the Germans, when they were distracted by the Allied attacks at both ends of the Normandy bridgehead. By the time of the American breakout at <a href="Avranches">Avranches</a>, there was little to no reserve strength left for <a href="Operation%20L%C3%BCttich">"Lüttich"</a>, which had been defeated by 12 August, leaving the 7th Army with no choice but to retire rapidly east of the Orne river, with a rearguard of the remaining armoured and motorised units, to allow time for the surviving infantry to reach the Seine. After the first stage of the withdrawal beyond the Orne, the manoeuvre collapsed for a lack of fuel, Allied air attacks and the constant pressure of the Allied armies, culminating in the encirclement of German forces in the <a href="Falaise%20pocket">Falaise pocket</a>.

At noon on 1 August, the <a href="United%20States%20Third%20Army">U.S. Third Army</a> was activated under the command of Lieutenant General <a href="George%20S.%20Patton">George S. Patton</a>. Lieutenant General <a href="Courtney%20Hodges">Courtney Hodges</a> assumed command of the First Army and Bradley was promoted to the overall command of both armies, named the U.S. 12th Army Group. Patton wrote a poem containing the words,

The U.S. advance following Cobra was extraordinarily rapid. Between 1 August and 4 August, seven divisions of Patton's Third Army had swept through Avranches and over the bridge at <a href="Pontaubault">Pontaubault</a> into Brittany. The <a href="Westheer">German army in Normandy</a> had been reduced to such a poor state by the Allied offensives that, with no prospect of reinforcement in the wake of <a href="Operation%20Bagration">Operation Bagration</a>, the Soviet summer offensive against <a href="Army%20Group%20Centre">Army Group Centre</a>, very few Germans believed they could now avoid defeat. Rather than order his remaining forces to withdraw to the Seine, <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> sent a directive to von Kluge demanding "an immediate counterattack between <a href="Mortain">Mortain</a> and Avranches" ("Unternehmen Lüttich") to "annihilate" the enemy and make contact with the west coast of the Cotentin peninsula. Eight of the nine Panzer divisions in Normandy were to be used in the attack but only four (one of them incomplete) could be relieved from their defensive tasks and assembled in time. German commanders immediately protested that such an operation was impossible given their remaining resources but these objections were overruled and the counter-offensive, commenced on 7 August around Mortain. The 2nd, 1st SS and 2nd SS Panzer Divisions led the assault, although with only 75 <a href="Panzer%20IV">Panzer IV</a>s, 70 <a href="Panther%20tank">Panthers</a>, and 32 <a href="self-propelled%20gun">self-propelled gun</a>s between them. Hopelessly optimistic, the offensive threat was over within 24 hours, although fighting continued until 13 August.

By 8 August, the city of <a href="Le%20Mans">Le Mans</a>—the former headquarters of the German <a href="7th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">7th Army</a>—had fallen to the Americans. With von Kluge's few remaining battleworthy formations destroyed by the First Army, the Allied commanders realised that the entire German position in Normandy was collapsing. Bradley declared:

On 14 August, in conjunction with American movements northward to <a href="Chambois%2C%20Orne">Chambois</a>, Canadian forces launched <a href="Operation%20Tractable">Operation Tractable</a>; the Allied intention was to trap and destroy the German 7th Army and 5th Panzer Army near the town of <a href="Falaise%2C%20Calvados">Falaise</a>. Five days later, the two arms of the encirclement were almost complete; the advancing U.S. 90th Infantry Division had made contact with the Polish <a href="1st%20Armoured%20Division%20%28Poland%29">1st Armored Division</a> and the first Allied units crossed the <a href="River%20Seine">Seine</a> at <a href="Mantes-la-Jolie">Mantes Gassicourt</a>, while German units were fleeing eastward by any means they could find. By 22 August, the <a href="Falaise%20Pocket">Falaise Pocket</a> — which the Germans had been fighting desperately to keep open to allow their trapped forces to escape — was finally sealed, ending the <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Battle of Normandy</a> with a major Allied victory. All German forces west of the Allied lines were now dead or in captivity and although perhaps 100,000 German troops escaped they left behind 40,000–50,000 prisoners and over 10,000 dead. A total of 344 tanks and self-propelled guns, 2,447 <a href="soft-skinned%20vehicle">soft-skinned vehicle</a>s and 252 artillery pieces were found abandoned or destroyed in the northern sector of the pocket. The Allies were able to advance freely through undefended territory and by 25 August all four Allied armies (First Canadian, Second British, First U.S., and Third U.S.) involved in the Normandy campaign were <a href="Liberation%20of%20Paris">on the river Seine</a>.

Alaska-class cruiser

The "Alaska" class was a class of six <a href="Alaska-class%20cruiser%23.22Large%20cruisers.22%20or%20.22battlecruisers.22">large cruisers</a> ordered before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> for the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. They were <a href="United%20States%20ship%20naming%20conventions">officially classed</a> as large cruisers (CB), but others have regarded them as <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s. They were all named after territories or <a href="insular%20area">insular area</a>s of the United States, signifying their intermediate status between larger <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s and smaller <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy</a> and <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s. Of the six planned, two were completed, the third's construction was suspended on 16 April 1947, and the last three were cancelled. and served with the U.S. Navy for the last year of World War II as bombardment ships and fast carrier escorts. They were decommissioned in 1947 after spending only 32 and 29 months in service, respectively.

The idea for a large cruiser class originated in the early 1930s when the U.S. Navy sought to counter "pocket battleships" being launched by Germany. Planning for ships that eventually evolved into the "Alaska" class began in the late 1930s after the deployment of Germany's s and rumors that Japan was constructing a new battlecruiser class. To serve as "cruiser-killers" capable of seeking out and destroying these post-<a href="London%20Naval%20Conference">Treaty</a> heavy cruisers, the class was given large guns of a new and expensive design, limited armor protection against 12-inch shells, and machinery capable of speeds of about .

Heavy cruiser development formalized between World War I and World War II thanks to the terms of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> and successor <a href="Second%20London%20Naval%20Treaty">treaties and conferences</a>, where the United States, Britain, Japan, France, and Italy agreed to limit <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a>s to 10,000 tons <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">displacement</a> with 8-inch main armament. Up until the "Alaska" class, US cruisers designed between the wars followed this pattern.

The initial impetus for the "Alaska" design came from the deployments of Germany's so-called <a href="pocket%20battleships">pocket battleships</a> in the early 1930s. Though no actions were immediately taken, these thoughts were revived in the late 1930s when intelligence reports indicated Japan was planning or building "super cruisers" that would be much more powerful than the current US heavy cruisers. The navy responded in 1938 when the <a href="General%20Board%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Navy">General Board</a> asked the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Construction%20and%20Repair">Bureau of Construction and Repair</a> to conduct a "comprehensive study of all types of naval vessels for consideration for a new and expanded building program". The US President at the time, <a href="Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a>, may have taken a lead role in the development of the class with his desire to have a counter to raiding abilities of Japanese cruisers and German pocket battleships. While these claims are difficult to verify, they have led to the speculation that their design was "politically motivated".

One historian described the design process of the "Alaska" class as "torturous" due to the numerous changes and modifications made to the ship's layouts by numerous departments and individuals. Indeed, there were at least nine different layouts, ranging from 6,000-ton anti-aircraft cruisers to "overgrown" <a href="heavy%20cruisers">heavy cruisers</a> and a 38,000-ton mini-<a href="battleship">battleship</a> that would have been armed with twelve 12-inch and sixteen 5-inch guns. The General Board, in an attempt to keep the displacement under 25,000 tons, allowed the designs to offer only limited underwater protection, such that they were vulnerable to torpedoes and shells that fell short of the ship. The final design was a scaled-up that had the same machinery as the s. This ship combined a main armament of nine 12-inch guns with protection against 10-inch gunfire into a hull that was capable of .

The "Alaska"s were officially funded in September 1940 along with a plethora of other ships as a part of the <a href="Two-Ocean%20Navy%20Act">Two-Ocean Navy Act</a>. Their role had been altered slightly: in addition to their surface-to-surface role, they were planned to protect carrier groups. Because of their bigger guns, greater size and increased speed, they would be more valuable in this role than heavy cruisers, and would provide insurance against reports that Japan was building super cruisers more powerful than U.S. heavy cruisers.

Yet another drastic change was considered during the "carrier panic" in late 1941, when the US Navy realized that they needed more <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s as quickly as possible. Many hulls currently under construction were considered for conversion into carriers. At different times, they considered some or all of the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s, the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a>s, the "Alaska" class, and even one of the s; in the end, they chose the "Cleveland"s, resulting in the conversion of nine ships under construction at the <a href="New%20York%20Shipbuilding%20Corporation">New York Shipbuilding Corporation</a> shipyard as the <a href="light%20aircraft%20carrier">light aircraft carrier</a>s comprising the .

A conversion of the "Alaska" cruisers to carriers was "particularly attractive" because of the many similarities between the design of the s and the "Alaska" class, including the same machinery. However, when "Alaska" cruisers were compared to the "Essex" carriers, converted cruisers would have had a shorter flight deck (so they could carry only 90% of the aircraft), would have been lower in the water, and could travel less at . In addition, the large cruiser design did not include the extensive underwater protections found in normal carriers due to the armor weight devoted to counter shell fire. Lastly, an "Alaska" conversion could not satisfy the navy's goal of having new aircraft carriers quickly, as the work needed to modify the ships into carriers would entail long delays. With this in mind, all planning to convert the "Alaska"s was abandoned on 7 January 1942.

Of the six "Alaska"-class cruisers that were planned, only three were laid down. The first two, and , were completed by the <a href="New%20York%20Shipbuilding%20Corporation">New York Shipbuilding Corporation</a>. Construction of , the third, was suspended on 16 April 1947 when she was 84% complete. The last three, "Philippines", "Puerto Rico", and "Samoa", were delayed since all available materials and slipways were allocated to higher priority ships, such as aircraft carriers, <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, and <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s. Construction had still not begun when steel shortages and a realization that these "cruiser-killers" had no more cruisers to hunt—as the fleets of Japanese cruisers had already been defeated by aircraft and submarines—made the ships "<a href="white%20elephants">white elephants</a>". As a result, construction of the last three members of the class never began, and they were officially cancelled on 24 June 1943.

 and served with the U.S. Navy during the last year of World War II. Similar to the <a href="fast%20battleship">fast battleship</a>s, their speed made them useful as shore bombardment ships and fast carrier escorts. Both "Alaska" and "Guam" protected when she was on her way to be repaired in Guam after being hit by two Japanese bombs. Afterward, "Alaska" supported the <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">landings on Okinawa</a>, while "Guam" went to <a href="San%20Pedro%20Bay%20%28Philippines%29">San Pedro Bay</a> to become the leader of a new task force, Cruiser Task Force 95. "Guam", joined by "Alaska", four light cruisers, and nine destroyers, led the task force into the <a href="East%20China%20Sea">East China</a> and <a href="Yellow%20Sea">Yellow Sea</a>s to conduct raids upon shipping; however, they encountered only Chinese <a href="Junk%20%28ship%29">junks</a>. By the end of the war, the two had become celebrated within the fleet as excellent carrier escorts. During the war, both ships were part of Cruiser Division 16 commanded by <a href="Rear%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> Francis S. Low, USN.

After the war, both ships served as part of Task Force 71, the designation for the <a href="U.S.%20Seventh%20Fleet">U.S. Seventh Fleet</a>'s North China Naval Force. Its mission was to support the <a href="US%20occupation%20of%20Korea">allied occupation of the Korean peninsula</a>. This included executing various show-the-flag operations along the western coast of Korea as well as in the <a href="Pohai%20Gulf">Gulf of Chihli</a>. These naval demonstrations preceded Operation Campus, the amphibious landing of U.S. Army ground forces at <a href="Incheon">Jinsen</a>, Korea, on 8 September 1945. Subsequently, both ships returned to the United States in mid-December 1945, and they were decommissioned and "<a href="Reserve%20fleet">mothballed</a>" in 1947. after having spent 32 months ("Alaska") and 29 months ("Guam") in service.

In 1958, the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Ships">Bureau of Ships</a> prepared two feasibility studies to explore whether "Alaska" and "Guam" could be suitably converted into <a href="guided-missile%20cruiser">guided-missile cruiser</a>s. The first study involved removing all of the guns in favor of four different missile systems. At $160 million, the cost of this proposed removal was seen as prohibitive, so a second study was initiated. The study left the forward batteries (the two 12-inch triple turrets and three of the 5-inch dual turrets) unchanged, and added a reduced version of the first plan on the stern of the ship. Even though the proposals would have cost approximately half as much as the first study's plan ($82 million), it was still seen as too expensive. As a result, both ships were stricken from the <a href="Naval%20Vessel%20Register">Naval Vessel Register</a> on 1 June 1960. "Alaska" was sold for scrap on 30 June 1960, and "Guam" on 24 May 1961.
The still-incomplete was considered for a conversion to be the Navy's first guided-missile cruiser; this thought lasted until 26 February 1952, when a different conversion to a "<a href="command%20ship">large command ship</a>" was contemplated. In anticipation of the conversion, her <a href="hull%20classification%20symbol">classification</a> was changed to CBC-1. This would have made her a "larger sister" to , but a year and a half later (9 October 1954) she was re-designated CB-3. "Hawaii" was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 9 June 1958 and was sold for scrap in 1959.

The "Alaska" class, along with the Dutch <a href="Design%201047%20battlecruiser">Design 1047 battlecruiser</a> and the Japanese <a href="Design%20B-65%20cruiser">Design B-65 cruiser</a>, were specifically to counter the heavy cruisers being built by their naval rivals. All three have been described as "super cruisers", "large cruisers" or even "unrestricted cruisers", with some advocating that they even be considered as battlecruisers, however they were "never" classified as capital ships as that designation was reserved for true battlecruisers and battleships. Early in its development, the class used the US <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> <a href="Hull%20classification%20symbol">designation</a> CC, which had been planned for the . However, the designation was changed to CB to reflect their new status, "large cruiser", and the practice of referring to them as battlecruisers was officially discouraged. The U.S. Navy then named the individual vessels after U.S. territories, rather than states (as was the tradition with battleships) or cities (for which cruisers were named), to symbolize the belief that these ships were supposed to play an intermediate role between heavy cruisers and fully-fledged battleships.

The "Alaska" class certainly resembled contemporary US battleships (particularly the , , and ) in appearance, including the familiar 2-A-1 main battery and massive columnar mast. They displaced twice that of the newest heavy cruisers (the )., being only 5,000 tons less than the <a href="Second%20London%20Naval%20Treaty">London Treaty</a> battleship standard displacement limit of 35,000 long tons (36,000 t). They were also longer than several treaty battleships such as the and "North Carolina" class.

In design and armor the "Alaska" class are regarded as "large cruisers" rather than battlecruisers. Their design was scaled up from , the latter being a <a href="treaty%20cruiser">treaty cruiser</a> limited by the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington</a>, <a href="London%20Naval%20Treaty">London</a> and <a href="Second%20London%20Naval%20Treaty">Second London</a> naval treaties. Their armor scheme had sufficient gunfire protection not only against 8″ heavy cruiser shells but even the larger 11″ shells used by Nazi Germany's "pocket battleships" and . However, they lacked the <a href="Torpedo%20belt">underwater protection systems</a> found on full-fledged battleships and even intermediate capital ships like the French and German classes. This left the "Alaska"s virtually defenseless against torpedoes, as well as vulnerable to shells falling slightly short and continuing underwater to hit the hull.

In addition, despite being much larger than the "Baltimore" class, the numbers of secondary and anti-aircraft batteries of the "Alaska"s were similar. Whereas the "Alaska" class carried twelve <a href="5%26quot%3B/38%20caliber%20gun">5"/38 caliber</a> in six twin turrets, fifty-six 40 mm, and thirty-four 20 mm guns, the "Baltimore" class carried the same number of 5"/38s, eight fewer 40 mm, and ten fewer 20 mm., considerably fewer than new U.S. battleships that had ten (save for ) 5"/38 twin mounts while older refitted U.S. battleships had eight. The dearth of anti-aircraft weaponry for a ship of its size was attributed to the amidships aircraft catapult like older US cruisers; while other modern U.S. cruisers and battleships opted for stern-mounted aircraft catapults to free up space along the central superstructure for more secondaries and anti-aircraft guns. In common with U.S. heavy cruisers, they had aircraft hangars and a single large rudder; the single rudder combined with the hull's long length gave the "Alaska"s a turning radius of 800 yards which exceeded the turning circles of larger battleships and carriers in the U.S. Navy. Author Richard Worth remarked that when they were finally completed, launched, and commissioned, they had the "size of a battleship but the capabilities of a cruiser". The "Alaska" class was similarly expensive to build and maintain as contemporary battleships yet far less capable due to armor deficiencies, while able to put up an anti-aircraft defense comparable only to the much cheaper "Baltimore" cruisers.

Despite these cruiser-like characteristics, and the U.S. Navy's insistence on their status as cruisers, the "Alaska" class has been frequently described as battlecruisers. The official navy magazine "All Hands" said "The "Guam" and her sister ship "Alaska" are the first American battle cruisers ever to be completed as such." Author Chris Knupp noted that while "other nations fulfilled the battlecruiser role by designing vessels like battleships, but stripped of armor and other features to gain speed", the United States "fulfilled the battlecruiser role by creating a larger, more powerful heavy cruiser...[whose] design already offered less armor and higher speed, but by enlarging the ship they gaining the heavier firepower". The "Alaska"s percentage of armor tonnage, 28.4%, was slightly less than that of <a href="fast%20battleship">fast battleship</a>s; the British "King George V" class, the American "Iowa" class, and the battlecruiser/fast battleship all had armor percentages between 32 and 33%, whereas the "Lexington"-class battlecruiser design had a nearly identical armor percentage of 28.5%. In fact, older battlecruisers, such as (19.9%), had a significantly lower percentage. Armament-wise, they had much larger guns than contemporary heavy cruisers; while the "Baltimore" class only carried nine <a href="8%26quot%3B/55%20caliber%20gun">8"/55 caliber</a> Marks 12 and 15 guns,<ref name="8/55 12 and 15"></ref> the "Alaska" class carried nine <a href="12%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20Mark%208%20gun">12"/50 caliber gun</a>s that were as good as, if not superior to, the old <a href="14%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20gun">14"/50 caliber gun</a> used on the U.S. Navy's pre-treaty battleships.<ref name="12/50"></ref>

As built, the "Alaska" class had nine <a href="12%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20Mark%208%20gun">12"/50 caliber</a> Mark 8 guns mounted in three triple (3-gun) turrets, with two turrets forward and one aft, a configuration known as "2-A-1". The previous 12" gun manufactured for the U.S. Navy was the Mark 7 version, which had been designed for and installed in the 1912 s. The Mark 8 was of considerably higher quality; in fact, it "was by far the most powerful weapon of its caliber ever placed in service." Designed in 1939, it weighed including the <a href="Breech-loading%20weapon">breech</a>, and could sustain an average rate of fire of 2.4–3 rounds a minute. It could throw a Mark 18 <a href="Armor-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">armor-piercing</a> shell at an elevation of 45°, and had a 344-shot barrel life (about 54 more than the much larger but similar <a href="16%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20Mark%207%20gun">16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun</a> found on the "Iowa" battleships.). The "Alaska"s Mark 8 guns were the heaviest main battery of any cruiser of World War II, and as capable as the old <a href="14%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20gun">14"/50 caliber gun</a> used on the U.S. Navy's pre-treaty battleships.<ref name="12/50"></ref>

The turrets were very similar to those of the "Iowa"-class battleships, but differed in several ways; for example, the "Alaska" class had a two-stage powder hoist instead of the "Iowa" class's one-stage hoist. These differences made operating the guns safer and increased the rate of fire. In addition, a "projectile rammer" was added to "Alaska" and "Guam". This machine transferred shells from storage on the ship to the rotating ring that fed the guns. However, this feature proved unsatisfactory, and it was not planned for "Hawaii" or any subsequent ships.

Because "Alaska" and "Guam" were the only two ships to mount these guns, only ten turrets were made during the war (three for each ship including "Hawaii" and one spare). They cost $1,550,000 each and were the most expensive heavy guns purchased by the U.S. Navy in World War II.

The secondary battery of the "Alaska" class was composed of twelve dual-purpose (anti-air and anti-ship) <a href="5%26quot%3B/38%20caliber%20gun">5"/38 caliber gun</a>s in twin mounts, with four offset on each side of the superstructure (two on each beam) and two centerline turrets fore and aft. The 5"/38 was originally intended for use on only <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s built in the 1930s, but by 1934 and into World War II it was being installed on almost all of the U.S.'s major warships, including aircraft carriers, battleships, and heavy and light cruisers.<ref name="5/38"></ref>

For anti-aircraft armament, the "Alaska"-class ships carried 56 × 40 mm guns and 34 × 20 mm guns. These numbers are comparable to 48 × 40 mm and 24 × 20 mm on the smaller "Baltimore"-class heavy cruisers and 80 × 40 mm and 49 × 20 mm on the larger "Iowa" battleships.

Arguably the most efficient light <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft gun</a> of World War II, the <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun">40 mm Bofors</a> was used on nearly every major warship in the U.S. and UK fleets during World War II from about 1943 to 1945. Although they were a descendant of German and Swedish designs, the Bofors mounts used by the United States Navy during World War II had been heavily "Americanized" to U.S. Navy standards. This new standard resulted in a gun system set to English standards (now known as the <a href="United%20States%20customary%20units">Standard System</a>) with interchangeable ammunition, simplifying the logistics situation for World War II. When coupled with hydraulic couple drives to reduce salt contamination and the Mark 51 director for improved accuracy, the 40 mm Bofors became a fearsome adversary, accounting for roughly half of all Japanese aircraft shot down between 1 October 1944 and 1 February 1945.

The <a href="Oerlikon%20Contraves">Oerlikon</a> <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">20 mm anti-aircraft gun</a> was one of the most extensively used anti-aircraft guns of World War II; the U.S. alone manufactured a total of 124,735 of these guns. When activated in 1941, they replaced the 0.50" <a href="M2%20Browning%20machine%20gun">M2 Browning machine gun</a> on a one-for-one basis. The Oerlikon gun remained the primary anti-aircraft weapon of the United States Navy until the introduction of the 40 mm Bofors in 1943.

USS President (1800)

USS "President" was a wooden-<a href="hull%20%28watercraft%29">hulled</a>, three-<a href="Mast%20%28sailing%29">masted</a> <a href="heavy%20frigate">heavy frigate</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>, nominally rated at 44 guns. <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> named her to reflect a principle of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>. She was launched in April 1800 from a shipyard in New York City. "President" was one of the <a href="original%20six%20frigates%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Navy">original six frigates</a> whose construction the <a href="Naval%20Act%20of%201794">Naval Act of 1794</a> had authorized, and she was the last to be completed. <a href="Joshua%20Humphreys">Joshua Humphreys</a> designed these frigates to be the young Navy's <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s, and so "President" and her sisters were larger and more heavily armed and built than standard frigates of the period. Forman Cheeseman, and later Christian Bergh were in charge of her construction. Her first duties with the newly formed United States Navy were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the <a href="Quasi%20War">Quasi War</a> with France and to engage in a <a href="punitive%20expedition">punitive expedition</a> against the <a href="Barbary%20pirates">Barbary pirates</a> in the <a href="First%20Barbary%20War">First Barbary War</a>.

On 16 May 1811, "President" was at the center of the <a href="Little%20Belt%20Affair">Little Belt Affair</a>; her crew mistakenly identified as , which had <a href="impressment">impressed</a> an American seaman. The ships exchanged cannon fire for several minutes. Subsequent U.S. and <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> investigations placed responsibility for the attack on each other without a resolution. The incident contributed to tensions between the U.S. and Great Britain that led to the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>.

During the war, "President" made several extended cruises, patrolling as far away as the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> and <a href="Norway">Norway</a>; she captured the armed <a href="schooner">schooner</a> and numerous <a href="merchant%20ship">merchant ship</a>s. In January 1815, after having been <a href="blockade">blockade</a>d in New York for a year by the Royal Navy, "President" attempted to run the blockade, and was chased by a blockading squadron. During the chase, she was engaged and crippled by the frigate off the coast of the city. The British squadron captured "President" soon after, and the Royal Navy took her into service as HMS "President" until she was <a href="Ship%20breaking">broken up</a> in 1818. "President"s design was copied and used to build the next in 1829.

During the 1790s, American <a href="merchant%20vessel">merchant vessel</a>s began to fall prey to <a href="Barbary%20corsairs">Barbary Pirates</a> in the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, most notably from <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a>. Congress's response was the <a href="Naval%20Act%20of%201794">Naval Act of 1794</a>. The Act provided funds for the construction of six frigates; however, it included a clause stating that construction of the ships would cease if the United States agreed to peace terms with Algiers.

<a href="Joshua%20Humphreys">Joshua Humphreys</a>' design was long on <a href="keel">keel</a> and narrow of <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> (width) to allow for mounting very heavy guns. The design incorporated a diagonal <a href="scantling">scantling</a> (rib) scheme to limit <a href="hogging%20and%20sagging">hogging</a> (warping); the ships were given extremely heavy planking. This gave the <a href="Hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates. Humphreys developed his design after realizing that the fledgling United States Navy could not match the navies of the European states for size. He therefore designed his frigates to be able to overpower other frigates, but with the speed to escape from a <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ship of the line</a>.

<a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> named "President" in order to reflect a principle of the United States Constitution. In March 1796, before "President"s keel could be laid down, a peace accord was announced between the United States and Algiers. Construction was suspended in accordance with the Naval Act of 1794. At the onset of the <a href="Quasi-War">Quasi-War</a> with France in 1798, funds were approved to complete her construction, and her keel was laid at a shipyard in New York City. Her original naval constructor was Forman Cheeseman and the superintendent was Captain <a href="Silas%20Talbot">Silas Talbot</a>.

Based on experience Humphreys gained during construction of "President"s <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s, and , he instructed Cheeseman to make alterations to the frigate's design. These included raising the <a href="gun%20deck">gun deck</a> by and moving the <a href="main-mast">main mast</a> further rearward. "President" was built to a length of <a href="length%20between%20perpendiculars">between perpendiculars</a> and a beam of .

Although construction was begun at New York in the shipyard of Foreman Cheesman, work on her was discontinued in 1796. Construction resumed in 1798, under Christian Bergh and naval constructor William Doughty.

"President"s nominal rating was that of a 44-gun ship. However, she usually carried over 50 guns. During her service in the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, "President" was armed with a battery of 55 guns: thirty-two 24-pounder (10.9 kg) cannon, twenty-two 42-pounder (19 kg) <a href="carronade">carronade</a>s, and one 18-pounder (8 kg) <a href="long%20gun">long gun</a>.

During her Royal Navy service as HMS "President", she was initially rated at 50 guns, although she was at this stage armed with 60 guns—thirty 24-pounders (10.9 kg) on the upper deck, twenty-eight 42-pounder (19 kg) carronades on the spar deck, plus two more 24-pounder guns on the forecastle. In February 1817, she was again re-rated, this time to 60 guns.

Unlike modern Navy vessels, ships of this era had no permanent battery of guns. Guns were portable and were often exchanged between ships as situations warranted. Each commanding officer modified his vessel's armaments to his liking, taking into consideration factors such as the overall tonnage of cargo, complement of personnel aboard, and planned routes to be sailed. Consequently, a vessel's armament would change often during its career; records of the changes were not generally kept.

"President" launched on 10 April 1800—the last of the <a href="Original%20six%20frigates%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Navy">original six frigates</a> to do so. After her <a href="fitting%20out">fitting out</a>, she departed for <a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a> on 5 August with Captain <a href="Thomas%20Truxtun">Thomas Truxtun</a> in command. She conducted routine patrols during the latter part of the Quasi-War and made several recaptures of American merchant ships. Nevertheless, her service in this period was uneventful. She returned to the United States in March, after a <a href="Convention%20of%201800">peace treaty with France</a> was ratified on 3 February 1801.
During the Quasi-War, the United States paid <a href="tribute">tribute</a> to the <a href="Barbary%20Coast">Barbary States</a> to ensure that they would not seize or harass American merchant ships. In 1801 <a href="Yusuf%20Karamanli">Yusuf Karamanli</a> of <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a>, dissatisfied with the amount of tribute in comparison to that paid to <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a>, demanded an immediate payment of $250,000. <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> responded by sending a squadron of warships to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and to pursue peace with the Barbary States.

In May, Commodore <a href="Richard%20Dale">Richard Dale</a> selected "President" as his <a href="flagship">flagship</a> for the assignment in the Mediterranean. Dale's orders were to present a <a href="show%20of%20force">show of force</a> off Algiers, Tripoli, and <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a> and maintain peace with promises of tribute. Dale was authorized to commence hostilities at his discretion if any Barbary State had declared war by the time of his arrival. Dale's squadron consisted of "President", , , and . The squadron arrived at <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on 1 July; "President" and "Enterprise" quickly continued to Algiers, where their presence convinced the regent to withdraw threats he had made against American merchant ships. "President" and "Enterprise" subsequently made appearances at <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a> and Tripoli before "President" arrived at <a href="Malta">Malta</a> on 16 August to replenish drinking water supplies.

Blockading the harbor of Tripoli on 24 August, "President" captured a Greek vessel with Tripolitan soldiers aboard. Dale negotiated an exchange of prisoners that resulted in the release of several Americans held captive in Tripoli. "President" arrived at Gibraltar on 3 September. Near <a href="Mah%C3%B3n">Mahón</a> in early December, "President" struck a large rock while traveling at . The impact brought Dale on deck and he successfully navigated "President" out of danger. An inspection revealed that the impact had twisted off a short section of her keel. "President" remained in the Mediterranean until March 1802; she departed for the United States and arrived on 14 April.

Although "President" remained in the United States, operations against the Barbary States continued. A second squadron assembled under the command of <a href="Richard%20Valentine%20Morris">Richard Valentine Morris</a> in . Morris' poor performance resulted in his recall and subsequent dismissal from the Navy in 1803. A third squadron assembled under the command of <a href="Edward%20Preble">Edward Preble</a> in ; by July 1804, they had fought the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Tripoli%20Harbor">Battle of Tripoli Harbor</a>.

In April 1804, President Jefferson decided to reinforce Preble's squadron. "President", "Congress", "Constellation", and "Essex" prepared to sail as soon as possible under the direction of Commodore <a href="Samuel%20Barron%20%281765-1810%29">Samuel Barron</a>. Barron selected "President" as his flagship, but she required a new <a href="bowsprit">bowsprit</a> and repairs to her masts and rigging. Some two months passed before the squadron was ready to sail. They departed in late June and arrived at Gibraltar on 12 August.

"President" left Gibraltar on 16 August with "Constellation"; the frigates paused at Malta before arriving off Tripoli on 10 September, joining "Constitution", , and . Sighting three ships running the blockade of Tripoli, the squadron moved in to capture them; during the pursuit, a sudden change in wind direction caused "President" to collide with "Constitution". The collision caused serious damage to "Constitution"s stern, bow, and <a href="Figurehead%20%28object%29">figurehead</a>. Two of the captured ships were sent to Malta with "Constitution"; "President" sailed to <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse, Sicily</a>, arriving on 27 August.

When Barron arrived in the Mediterranean, his seniority of rank over Preble entitled him to assume the duties of commodore. However, soon after replacing Preble, Barron went ashore at Syracuse in poor health and became bedridden. Under command of Captain George Cox, "President" began routine blockade duties of Tripoli during the winter months of 1804–05. In late April 1805, "Constitution" captured three ships off Tripoli. "President" escorted them to port at Malta before rejoining "Constitution".

Barron's fragile health necessitated his resignation; he passed command to <a href="John%20Rodgers%20%28naval%20officer%2C%20War%20of%201812%29">John Rodgers</a> in late May 1805. Barron ordered Cox to command "Essex", and turned "President" over to his brother, <a href="James%20Barron">James Barron</a>, on 29 May. On 3 June, after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Derne">Battle of Derne</a>, the U.S signed a peace treaty with Tripoli. "President" sailed for the United States on 13 July, carrying the ailing Barron and many sailors released from captivity in Tripoli.

In 1807, the <a href="Chesapeake-Leopard%20Affair">"Chesapeake"-"Leopard" Affair</a> heightened tensions between the United States and Britain. In preparation for further hostilities, Congress began authorizing naval appropriations, and "President" recommissioned in 1809 under the command of Commodore John Rodgers. She made routine and uneventful patrols, mainly along the United States' eastern seaboard, until 1 May 1811, when the British frigate stopped the American brig "Spitfire" from New York and <a href="impressment">impressed</a> a crewman.

Rodgers received orders to pursue "Guerriere", and "President" sailed immediately from <a href="Fort%20Severn">Fort Severn</a> on 10 May. On 16 May, approximately northeast of <a href="Cape%20Henry">Cape Henry</a>, a lookout spotted a sail on the horizon. Closing to investigate, Rodgers determined the sail belonged to a warship, and raised <a href="signal%20flag">signal flag</a>s to identify his ship. The unidentified ship, later learned to be —a 20-gun <a href="sixth%20rate">sixth rate</a>—hoisted signal flags in return, but the hoist was not understood by "President"s crew. "Little Belt" sailed southward and Rodgers, believing the ship to be "Guerriere", pursued.

Darkness set in before the ships were within hailing distance, and Rodgers hailed twice, only to have the same question returned to him: "What ship is that?" According to Rodgers, immediately after the exchange of hails, "Little Belt" fired a shot that tore through "President"s rigging. Rodgers returned fire. "Little Belt" promptly answered with three guns, and then a whole <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. Rodgers ordered his gun crews to fire at will; several accurate broadsides heavily damaged "Little Belt" in return. After five minutes of firing, "President"s crew realized their adversary was much smaller than a frigate and Rodgers ordered a cease fire. However, "Little Belt" fired again and "President" answered with more broadsides. After "Little Belt" became silent, "President" stood off and waited overnight. At dawn it was obvious that "Little Belt" was greatly damaged from the fight; Rodgers sent a boat over from "President" to offer assistance in repairing the damage. Her Captain, <a href="Arthur%20Bingham">Arthur Bingham</a>, acknowledged the damage; declining any help, he sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia. "President" had one sailor slightly wounded in the exchange, while "Little Belt" suffered 31 killed or wounded.

Upon "President"s return to port, the U.S. Navy launched an investigation into the incident. Gathering testimony from "President"s officers and crewmen, they determined that "Little Belt" had fired the first shot in the encounter. In the Royal Navy investigation, Captain Bingham insisted that "President" had fired the first shot and continued firing for 45 minutes, rather than the five minutes Rodgers claimed. In all subsequent reports, both captains continually insisted that the other ship had fired the first shot. Reaching a stalemate, the American and British governments quietly dropped the matter.

The United States declared war against Britain on 18 June 1812. Three days later, within an hour of receiving official word of the declaration, Commodore Rodgers sailed from New York City. The commodore sailed aboard "President", leading a squadron consisting of "United States", "Congress", , and on a 70-day North Atlantic cruise. A passing American merchant ship informed Rodgers about a fleet of British merchantmen en route to Britain from Jamaica. Rodgers and his squadron sailed in pursuit, and on 23 June they encountered what was later learned to be . "President" pursued the ship, and in what is recorded as the first shot of the War of 1812, Rodgers himself aimed and fired a <a href="Chase%20gun">bowchaser</a> at "Belvidera", striking her rudder and penetrating the gun room. Upon "President"s fourth shot at "Belvidera", a cannon one deck below Rodgers burst, killing or wounding 16 sailors and throwing Rodgers to the deck with enough force to break his leg.

The ensuing confusion allowed "Belvidera" to fire her stern chasers, killing six more men aboard "President". Rodgers kept up the pursuit, using his bow chasers to severely damage "Belvidera"s rigging, but his two broadsides had little effect. The crew of "Belvidera" quickly made repairs to the rigging. They cut loose her anchors and boats and pumped drinking water overboard to lighten her load, thereby increasing her speed. "Belvidera" soon gained enough speed to distance herself from "President", and Rodgers abandoned the pursuit. "Belvidera" sailed to Halifax to deliver the news that war had been declared.

"President" and her squadron returned to the pursuit of the Jamaican fleet, and on 1 July began to follow the trail of coconut shells and orange peels the Jamaicans had left behind them. "President" sailed to within one day's journey of the English Channel, but never sighted the convoy. Rodgers called off the pursuit on 13 July. During their return trip to Boston, Rodgers' squadron captured seven merchant ships and recaptured one American vessel.

After some refitting, "President", still under Rodgers' command, sailed on 8 October with "Congress", "United States", and "Argus". On 12 October, "United States" and "Argus" parted from the squadron for their own patrols. On 10 October, "President" chased , but failed to overtake her. On 17 October "President" captured the British packet ship "Swallow", which carried a large amount of currency on board. On 31 October, "President" and "Congress" began pursuit of , which was escorting two merchant ships. The chase lasted about three hours, and in that time "Congress" captured the merchant ship "Argo". Meanwhile, "President" kept after "Galatea" and drew very close, but lost sight of her in the night. "Congress" and "President" remained together, but did not find any ships to capture during November. Returning to the United States, they passed north of Bermuda and proceeded toward the <a href="Virginia%20Capes">Virginia capes</a>; they arrived in Boston on 31 December, having taken nine prizes. "President" and "Congress" found themselves <a href="blockade">blockade</a>d there by the Royal Navy until April 1813.
On 30 April, "President" and "Congress" sailed through the blockade on their third cruise of the war. On 2 May, they pursued , but she outran them and escaped. "President" parted company with "Congress" on 8 May, and Rodgers set a course along the <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a> to search for merchant ships to capture. By June, not having come across a single ship, "President" turned north; she put into North Bergen, Norway, on 27 June to replenish her drinking water. Sailing soon after, "President" captured two British merchant ships, which helped to replenish her stores. On 10 June "President" captured the outward-bound Falmouth <a href="Post%20Office%20Packet%20Service">packet</a> "Duke of Montrose", Captain Aaron Groub Blewett, which managed to throw her mails overboard before "President" could send a prize crew aboard. "President" made a <a href="cartel%20%28ship%29">cartel</a> of "Duke of Montrose", putting all of "President"s prisoners on board and then sending her into Falmouth under the command of an American officer. When "Duke of Montrose" arrived at Falmouth the British Government abrogated the cartel on the grounds that they had advised the American Government that the British would not recognize agreements entered into on the high seas.

Around the same time, two Royal Navy ships came into view. "President" set all sails to escape, and outran them in a chase lasting 80 hours. Rodgers reported that his decision to flee the ships was based on identifying them as a <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ship of the line</a> and a frigate. Royal Navy records later revealed that the vessels were actually the 32-gun frigate and the 16-gun fireship .

Spending a few days near the <a href="North%20Channel%20%28Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">Irish Channel</a>, "President" captured several more merchant ships. She then set a course for the United States. In late September, she encountered along the east coast of the United States. Rodgers used his signal flags to trick "Highflyer" into believing that "President" was . Lieut. George Hutchinson, "Highflyer"s captain, came aboard "President" only to discover he had walked into a trap; "President" captured "Highflyer" without a shot being fired. "President"s long cruise netted her 11 merchant ships, in addition to "Highflyer".

On 4 December, "President" sailed from Providence, Rhode Island. On the 25th, she encountered two frigates in the dark, one of which fired at her. Rodgers believed the ships to be British, but they were two French frigates, and . Afterward, Rodgers headed toward Barbados for an eight-week cruise in the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>, reportedly making three small captures. Returning to New York City on 18 February 1814, "President" encountered <a href="French%20frigate%20Loire%20%281796%29">HMS "Loire"</a>, which turned to escape once the latter's crew realized "President" was a 44-gun frigate. "President" remained in New York for the duration of 1814 due to the harbor's blockade by a British squadron consisting of , , <a href="French%20frigate%20Astr%C3%A9e%20%281809%29">"Pomone"</a>, and "Tenedos".

The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Ghent">Treaty of Ghent</a>, ending hostilities between the United States and Britain, was signed on 24 December 1814. However, the United States did not ratify the treaty until 18 February 1815. The war carried on in the interim.

<a href="Stephen%20Decatur">Stephen Decatur</a> assumed command of "President" in December 1814, planning a cruise to the West Indies to prey on British shipping. In mid-January 1815, a snowy <a href="gale">gale</a> with strong winds forced the British blockading squadron away from <a href="New%20York%20Harbor">New York Harbor</a>, giving Decatur the opportunity to put to sea. On the evening of 14 January, "President" headed out of the harbor but ran aground, the result of harbor pilots incorrectly marking a safe passage. Stranded on the sand bar, "President" lifted and dropped with the incoming tide. Within two hours her hull had been damaged, her timbers twisted, and masts sprung. Damage to her keel caused the ship to <a href="hogging%20and%20sagging">hog and sag</a>. Decatur was finally able to float "President" off the <a href="Shoal">bar</a> and, assessing the damage, he decided to return to New York for repairs; however, the wind direction was not favorable and "President" was forced to head out to sea.

Unaware of the exact location of the blockading squadron, Decatur set a course to avoid them and seek a safe port, but approximately two hours later the squadron's sails were spotted on the horizon. "President" changed course to outrun them, but the damage she suffered the night before had significantly reduced her speed. Attempting to gain speed, Decatur ordered expendable cargo thrown overboard; by late afternoon of 15 January, HMS "Endymion" under <a href="Henry%20Hope%20%28Captain%29">Captain Henry Hope</a> came alongside and proceeded to fire broadsides. Decatur planned to bring "President" in close to "Endymion", whereby "President"s crew could board and capture the opposing ship and sail her to New York. ("President" would be <a href="Scuttling">scuttled</a> to prevent her capture).

Making several attempts to close on "Endymion", Decatur discovered that "President"s damage limited her maneuverability, allowing "Endymion" to anticipate, and draw away from, positions favorable for boarding. Faced with this new dilemma, Decatur ordered <a href="Chain-shot">bar and chain shot</a> fired to disable "Endymion"s sails and rigging, the idea being to shake his pursuer and allow "President" to proceed to a safe port without being followed. At noon, "Endymion", being the much better sailer, was <a href="Point%20of%20sail%23Close-hauled">close-hauled</a>, outpacing her squadron and leaving them behind. At 2 pm, she gained on "President" and took position on the American ship's quarter, shooting into "President" as she tried to escape. "Endymion" was able to rake "President" three times and did considerable damage to her; by contrast, "President" primarily directed her fire at "Endymion's" <a href="rigging">rigging</a> in order to slow her down during the two-hour engagement.

Finally at 7:58 pm, "President" ceased fire and hoisted a light in her rigging, indicating that she had surrendered. "Endymion" ceased firing on the defeated American ship but did not board to take possession of her prize, due to a lack of undamaged boats. "Endymion"s foresails had been damaged in the engagement and while she <a href="Heaving%20to">hove to</a> for repairs, Decatur took advantage of the situation and, despite <a href="Striking%20the%20colors">having struck</a>, made off to escape at 8.30 pm; "Endymion", hastily completed repairs and resumed the chase at 8.52 pm.

"President" drew away while her crew made hurried repairs of their own. Within two hours, one of her lookouts spotted the remainder of the enemy squadron drawing near. "President" continued her escape attempt, but by nightfall HMS "Pomone" and "Tenedos" had caught up and began firing broadsides. Realizing his situation, Decatur surrendered "President" again, just before midnight.

Now in possession of the Royal Navy, "President" and her crew were ordered to proceed to <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> with "Endymion". During the journey, they encountered a dangerous gale. The storm destroyed "President"s masts and strained "Endymion"s timbers so badly that all the upper-deck guns were thrown overboard to prevent her from sinking. Decatur and his crew were briefly held prisoner in Bermuda. Upon the prisoners' return to the United States, a U.S. Navy court martial board acquitted Decatur, his officers, and his men of any wrongdoing in the surrender of "President".

"President" and "Endymion" continued to England, arriving at <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a> on 28 March. "President" was commissioned into the Royal Navy under the name HMS "President". Her initial rating was set at 50 guns, although she was at this stage armed with 60 guns—thirty 24-pounders (10.9 kg) on the upper deck, twenty-eight 42-pounder (19 kg) carronades on the spar deck, plus two more 24-pounder guns on the forecastle. In February 1817 she was again re-rated, this time to 60 guns.

In March 1818 she was considered for refitting. A <a href="drydock">drydock</a> inspection revealed that the majority of her timber was defective or rotten and she was broken up at Portsmouth in June. "President"s design was copied and used to build in 1829, although this was reportedly more of a political maneuver than a testament to the design. The Royal Navy wished to retain the name and likeness of the American ship on their register as a reminder to the United States and other nations of the capture.

Shapinsay

Shapinsay is one of the <a href="Orkney">Orkney Islands</a> off the north coast of mainland Scotland. There is one village on the island, <a href="Balfour%2C%20Orkney">Balfour</a>, from which <a href="Roll-on/roll-off">roll-on/roll-off car ferries</a> sail to <a href="Kirkwall">Kirkwall</a> on the <a href="Orkney%20Mainland">Orkney Mainland</a>. <a href="Balfour%20Castle">Balfour Castle</a>, built in the <a href="Scottish%20Baronial%20style">Scottish Baronial style</a>, is one of the island's most prominent features, a reminder of the Balfour family's domination of Shapinsay during the 18th and 19th centuries; the Balfours transformed life on the island by introducing new agricultural techniques. Other landmarks include a <a href="standing%20stone">standing stone</a>, an <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> <a href="broch">broch</a>, a <a href="souterrain">souterrain</a> and a salt-water shower.

With an area of , Shapinsay is the eighth largest island in the <a href="List%20of%20Orkney%20islands">Orkney archipelago</a>. It is low-lying and fertile, consequently most of the area is given over to farming. Shapinsay has two <a href="nature%20reserve">nature reserve</a>s and is notable for its bird life.

At the 2011 census, Shapinsay had a population of 307. The economy of the island is primarily based on agriculture with the exception of a few small businesses that are largely tourism-related. Plans for the construction of a <a href="wind%20turbine">wind turbine</a> are under consideration.

Unlike most of the larger Orkney islands, the derivation of the name 'Shapinsay' is not obvious. The final 'ay' is from the <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> for "island", but the first two syllables are more difficult to interpret. Haswell-Smith (2004) suggests the root may be "hjalpandis-øy" ("helpful island") owing to the presence of a good harbour, although anchorages are plentiful in the <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a>. The first written record dates from 1375 in a reference to "Scalpandisay", which may suggest a derivation from "Judge's island". Another suggestion is "Hyalpandi's island", although no one of that name is known to be associated with Shapinsay.

Standing stones provide evidence of the island's human occupation since <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> times. According to <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>, the Roman general <a href="Gnaeus%20Julius%20Agricola">Agricola</a> subdued the inhabitants of the Orkney Islands, and a local legend holds that he landed on Shapinsay. During the 18th century, a croft named "Grukalty" was renamed "Agricola" (which is also Latin for "farmer"). Roman coins have been found on Shapinsay, but they may have been brought to the island by traders.

Shapinsay is briefly mentioned in the <a href="Saga">Norse sagas</a>. "<a href="H%C3%A1konar%20saga%20H%C3%A1konarsonar">The Saga of Haakon Haakonsson</a>" states that <a href="Haakon%20IV%20of%20Norway">Haakon IV of Norway</a> anchored in Elwick Bay before sailing south to eventual defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Largs">Battle of Largs</a>.

The 18th century saw the beginnings of <a href="British%20Agricultural%20Revolution">change to agriculture</a> on Shapinsay, courtesy of the Balfour family. The family owned the estate of Sound, which covered the western part of the island. Sound had passed from the Tulloch family to the Buchanan family in the 17th century. In 1674, Arthur Buchanan built the house of Sound, where <a href="Balfour%20Castle">Balfour Castle</a> now stands. His granddaughter married James Fea, who is best known for his role in the capture of the Orkney Pirate <a href="John%20Gow">John Gow</a>. Fea was a supporter of the <a href="Jacobite%20rising%20of%201715">Jacobite rising of 1715</a>, and the house was burned by <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">Hanoverian</a> troops in revenge. The estate was acquired by Andrew Ross, Stewart Depute in Orkney of the <a href="James%20Douglas%2C%2014th%20Earl%20of%20Morton">Earl of Morton</a>. Ross's heirs, the Lindsay brothers, sold the estate to Thomas Balfour in 1782. Balfour had previously rented the Bu of <a href="Burray">Burray</a>, a large manor farm on another Orkney island, but had insufficient wealth to acquire the estate even though his wife had inherited a legacy on the death of her aristocratic brother. To raise the necessary funds, Balfour had to sell his military commission and borrow from his brother, John, who was prospering in India with the <a href="Honourable%20East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a>. Once installed on the island, he built a new house, Cliffdale, and founded the village of Shoreside, now known as <a href="Balfour%2C%20Orkney">Balfour</a>. He also reformed the local agriculture, enclosing fields and constructing farm buildings.

William Irving was born c. 1740 in the small <a href="hamlet%20%28place%29">hamlet</a> of <a href="Quholm">Quholm</a> in the northeast of the island. He became a sailor before emigrating to New York in 1763. One of his sons was <a href="Washington%20Irving">Washington Irving</a>, author of <a href="Rip%20van%20Winkle">Rip van Winkle</a> and the first American author to gain international recognition.

Marjory Meason, a native of Shapinsay, was the last person to be executed in Orkney, in 1728. She was a young servant, hanged in Kirkwall for the murder of a child. The execution is recorded as requiring 24 armed men, not including officers, and costing £15 8s.

During this period, burning <a href="kelp">kelp</a> was a mainstay of the island economy. More than of burned seaweed were produced per annum to make <a href="soda%20ash">soda ash</a>, bringing in £20,000 for the inhabitants. Thomas Balfour's income from the kelp industry brought him four times the income that farming did.

The 19th century saw more radical change in Shapinsay. Thomas Balfour's grandson, David Balfour, transformed the island after inheriting the family estate, which by 1846 encompassed the whole of Shapinsay. Most of the land was divided into fields of , a feature that is still apparent today. Tenants were required to <a href="enclosure">enclose</a> and drain the land or pay for the estate to do it in the form of a surcharge added to their rents. In 1846, on Shapinsay consisted of arable land. By 1860, that had trebled to more than . New crops and breeds of cattle and sheep were also introduced. Balfour's reforms were described as "the fountain and source of Orkney Improvement."

Balfour also gave the island its most noticeable landmark when he recruited an <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> architect, <a href="David%20Bryce">David Bryce</a>, to transform Cliffdale House into the <a href="Scottish%20Baronial">Scottish Baronial</a> Balfour Castle. Other buildings he added to the island include the porter's lodge (now a <a href="public%20house">public house</a> called The Gatehouse), a water mill, a school, and a gasworks that remained operational until the 1920s. The gasworks is in the form of a round tower with a corbelled parapet of red brick and carved stones—including one possibly removed from <a href="Noltland%20Castle">Noltland Castle</a> on <a href="Westray">Westray</a>, which is inscribed with the year 1725. The structure appears to be fortified, in accordance with Balfour's intention to give the village a medieval appearance. David Balfour was also responsible for the construction of <a href="Mill%20Dam%2C%20Shapinsay">Mill Dam</a>, a wetland which was once the <a href="water%20supply">water supply</a> for the mill and is now an <a href="Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Birds">RSPB</a> nature reserve.

Fishing for <a href="herring">herring</a> and <a href="cod">cod</a> also grew in importance during the 19th century. Herring fishing was expanding generally in Scotland at that time, with fishing stations being set up in remote areas. Herring fishing began in 1814 on <a href="Stronsay">Stronsay</a> and soon spread throughout the Orkney Islands. By the middle of the century, Shapinsay had 50 herring boats. Cod became important largely because the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> forced English fishing boats to fish further north. Local fishermen, who had been catching fish using lines from small boats for centuries, also began <a href="trawling">trawling</a> for cod. However, this was largely a part-time venture, unlike in Shetland, where many inhabitants made a living from fishing. A saying originating from this time states, "a Shetlander is a fisherman with a croft, while an Orcadian is a farmer with a boat." Consequently, fishermen from outside the Orkney Islands earned a large share of the profits. Helliar Holm's beaches were used to dry both herring and cod after they had been salted. With the end of the Napoleonic Wars, which led to cheaper sources of <a href="soda%20ash">soda ash</a> becoming available from continental Europe, the kelp industry collapsed by 1830. This collapse helped fuel agricultural reform, as <a href="crofter">crofter</a>s accustomed to earning a second income had to now earn more from farming.

The Balfour estate sold its farms on Shapinsay between 1924 and 1928. This was a common occurrence in Orkney at the time as wealthy landowners moved to more lucrative forms of investment. Farms were generally sold to the sitting tenant or to their neighbours who wished to expand.

The 20th century saw many changes in farming on Shapinsay. Mechanised implements came to the island, particularly after the Second World War. In common with the rest of Orkney, the amount of land given over to growing grass increased. The growing of grain (with the exception of <a href="barley">barley</a>) and <a href="turnip">turnip</a>s steadily declined as these were replaced as winter fodder for livestock by <a href="silage">silage</a>, usually harvested by mechanical <a href="forage%20harvester">forage harvester</a>s.

Orkney was a strategic site during both World Wars, and Shapinsay was no exception. In 1917, during the First World War, the "Swiftsure" was hit by a mine 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) east of Haco's Ness and sank in 19 metres (62 ft) of water with the loss of a single life. The site of the wreck was not discovered until 1997.

During the Second World War, gun batteries were built on the island. A twin <a href="Ordnance%20QF%206%20pounder">six pounder</a> emplacement at Galtness Battery on the coast at Salt Ness protected the Wide Firth from German <a href="E-boat">torpedo boats</a>. A Castle Battery was operational from 1941–43, as was an anti-aircraft battery. <a href="Mains%20electricity">Mains electricity</a> arrived on Shapinsay in the 1970s, when an underwater cable was laid from Kirkwall.

The trend towards more intensive farming began to be partially reversed by the end of the century as more environmentally friendly practices were encouraged by government and <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> grants. For example, Richard Zawadzki, owner of Balfour Mains (the largest farm on the island), ceased to breed livestock (instead keeping animals bred elsewhere) and grew less grain (some barley is still grown on the farm). Instead, some of the land is now managed under a Habitat Creation Scheme, which aims to encourage natural vegetation, wild flowers and nesting birds by limiting grazing and reducing the use of chemical fertilisers.

Tourism started to become important in the latter half of the century; the first restaurant to incorporate <a href="bed%20and%20breakfast">bed and breakfast</a> facilities opened in 1980.

With an area of , Shapinsay is the 8th largest Orkney island and the 29th largest <a href="List%20of%20islands%20of%20Scotland">Scottish island</a>. The highest point of Ward Hill is above sea level. The east coast is composed of low cliffs and has several sea caves, including the picturesque <a href="Geo%20%28landscape%29">geo</a> at the extreme northern tip known as <a href="Geo%20of%20Ork">Geo of Ork</a>. Elwick Bay is a sheltered anchorage on the south coast, facing the Orkney mainland; the island's largest settlement, Balfour, is at the western end of the bay.

The island has several <a href="ayre%20%28landform%29">ayres</a>, or <a href="storm%20beach">storm beach</a>es, which form narrow spits of <a href="shingle%20beach">shingle</a> or sand cutting across the landward and seaward ends of shallow bays. They can sometimes cut off a body of water from the sea, forming shallow freshwater <a href="loch">loch</a>s known as oyces. Examples include <a href="Vasa%20Loch">Vasa Loch</a> and Lairo Water.

There are several small islands in the vicinity including Broad Shoal, Grass Holm and Skerry of Vasa. <a href="Helliar%20Holm">Helliar Holm</a> is a <a href="tidal">tidal</a> <a href="islet">islet</a> at the eastern entrance to the main harbour at Balfour; it has a small <a href="lighthouse">lighthouse</a> and a ruined <a href="broch">broch</a>. The String, a stretch of water that lies between Helliar Holm and the mainland, has strong tidal currents.

In common with most of the Orkney isles, Shapinsay has a <a href="bedrock">bedrock</a> formed from <a href="Old%20Red%20Sandstone">Old Red Sandstone</a>, which is approximately 400 million years old and was laid down in the <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a> period. These thick deposits accumulated as earlier <a href="Silurian">Silurian</a> rocks, uplifted by the formation of <a href="Pangaea">Pangaea</a>, eroded and then deposited into river deltas. The freshwater <a href="Orcadian%20Basin">Lake Orcadie</a> existed on the edges of these <a href="erosion">eroding</a> mountains, stretching from <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a> to the southern <a href="Moray%20Firth">Moray Firth</a>. The composition of Shapinsay is mostly of the <a href="Rousay">Rousay</a> flagstone group from the Lower Middle Devonian, with some Eday flagstone in the southeast formed in wetter conditions during the later Upper Devonian. The latter is regarded as a better quality building material than the former. At Haco's Ness in the south east corner of the island is a small outcrop of amygdaloidal <a href="diabase">diabase</a>. The island is overlain with a fertile layer of boulder clay formed during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> glaciations.

The island's bird life is particularly rich in waders such as <a href="curlew">curlew</a> and <a href="common%20redshank">redshank</a>, found at <a href="The%20Ouse">The Ouse</a> and <a href="Veantro%20Bay">Veantro Bay</a>, and gull and <a href="tern">tern</a> colonies on the rockier shores and cliffs. <a href="northern%20pintail">pintail</a>, <a href="shoveller">shoveller</a>s and <a href="whooper%20swan">whooper swan</a>s are regular summer visitors, and there are also breeding populations of <a href="shelduck">shelduck</a>s, <a href="hen%20harrier">hen harrier</a>s and <a href="Arctic%20skua">bonxies</a>. There is an introduced population of <a href="red-legged%20partridge">red-legged partridge</a>s. <a href="European%20otter">Otters</a> can be seen at the Ouse, Lairo Water and Vasa Loch, and at various places around the coast along with <a href="common%20seal">common seal</a>s and <a href="grey%20seal">Atlantic grey seals</a>. There are plans to build a hide to allow visitors to observe seals without disturbing them. Shapinsay and <a href="Hoy">Hoy</a> are the only two larger Orkney islands that lack the <a href="Orkney%20vole">Orkney vole</a> ("Microtus arvalis orcadensis"). Wildflowers abound in the summer, and the <a href="lichen">lichen</a> "Melaspilea interjecta", which is <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to Scotland, is found in only three locations, including Shapinsay. In addition to the <a href="Mill%20Dam%2C%20Shapinsay">RSPB reserve at Mill Dam</a> there is a <a href="Scottish%20Wildlife%20Trust">Scottish Wildlife Trust</a> reserve at East Hill in the southeast.

The highest recorded population for Shapinsay is 974, in 1881. Since then, the population of the island has steadily declined; less than a third of that number was recorded in the 2001 census. The rate of absolute population loss was lower in the last decades of the 20th century than it had been in the first half of that century. In 2001, Shapinsay had a population of 300, a decline of 6.8% from 322 in 1991. This was greater than the population decline for Orkney overall in the same period, which was 1.9%. However, the loss in population on Shapinsay was less than that experienced by most Orkney islands, most of which experienced declines of more than 10%. The number of persons per hectare on Shapinsay was 0.1, similar to the 0.2 persons per hectare across Orkney. At the time of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202011">2011 census</a> the usually resident population had increased to 307. During the same period <a href="List%20of%20Scottish%20islands">Scottish island</a> populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.

Of the island's 300 inhabitants recorded in 2001, 283 were born in the United Kingdom (227 in Scotland and 56 in England). Seventeen were born outside the United Kingdom (four elsewhere in Europe, four in Asia, four in North America, one in South America and four in Oceania). By age group, 85 of the inhabitants were under 30 years of age, 134 were aged between 30 and 59, and 71 were age 60 and over.

Balfour Castle dominates views of the southwest of the island and can be seen from the tower of <a href="St.%20Magnus%20Cathedral">St. Magnus Cathedral</a> in Kirkwall. The castle library features a secret passage hidden behind a false set of bookshelves. The Balfours escaped unwelcome visitors through this passageway, which leads to the conservatory door, enabling the butler to truthfully tell visitors that the Balfours were not in the house. Another feature of the castle is the stags' heads with gaslights at the tips of their antlers, although these are no longer used as working lights. The castle grounds feature deciduous woodland (now rare in Orkney) and of walled gardens. Though built around an older structure that dates at least from the 18th century, the present castle was built in 1847, commissioned by Colonel David Balfour, and designed by Edinburgh architect <a href="David%20Bryce">David Bryce</a>.

Other buildings constructed by David Balfour include the Dishan Tower, known locally as "The Douche". This is a saltwater shower building with a <a href="dovecote">dovecote</a> on top. A local landmark due to its high visibility when approaching the island by sea, the building is now in a serious state of disrepair, with roofing slates missing and the dovecote in danger of collapsing.
A more ancient dwelling on Shapinsay is the Iron Age Broch of <a href="Burroughston%20Broch">Burroughston</a>. Only the interior of this partially buried building has been excavated, allowing visitors to look down into the broch from the surrounding mound. The surviving <a href="drystone">drystone</a> walls rise to about three metres (10 ft) and are more than four metres (13 ft) thick in some places.

The broch shows more evidence of David Balfour's influence on Shapinsay. He arranged for the site to be excavated by the archaeologists <a href="George%20Petrie%20%28archaeologist%29">George Petrie</a> and Sir William Dryden in 1861. The site was neglected after the excavation, slowly filling up with vegetation and rubble before being cleared in 1994.

Shapinsay Heritage Centre is located in Balfour's former smithy, along with a craft shop and a cafe. The castle's former gatehouse is now the village public house.

In common with the other Orkney islands, Shapinsay is fertile agricultural land, with farms specialising in beef and lamb which export thousands of cattle and sheep annually. <a href="Orkney%20Ferries">Orkney Ferries</a> provides transport for pedestrians and vehicles, proximity to <a href="Kirkwall">Kirkwall</a> permitting closer contacts with the Orkney Mainland than is possible for most of the other North Isles. There are six crossings per day, the journey lasting about 25 minutes, which allows for a moderate amount of commuting. Between 1893 and 1964, the island was served by the steamer "Iona". Since 1964, the "Klydon" and then the "Clytus" have operated the service; the current ferry is the . The Orkney Islands Council has considered building a tunnel to the Orkney Mainland. <a href="Balfour%20Castle">Balfour Castle</a> is now run as a hotel by the family of Captain Tadeusz Zawadzki, a <a href="Poland">Polish</a> cavalry officer.
The Shapinsay <a href="development%20trust">development trust</a> is working on the island's community plan, and owns the island's wind turbine, which was completed in August 2011 after the community voted for its construction. According to the development trust, the turbine could earn more than £5 million during its 25-year lifetime.

Small businesses on Shapinsay include a <a href="jam">jam</a> and <a href="chutney">chutney</a> manufacturer, which uses traditional methods, and a studio offering residential arts courses such as <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> crafting.

Shapinsay has a primary school, which in the 2006–7 academic year had 26 pupils. Before 1995, the island also had a secondary school but lost this because of falling enrolment and improved transport links with Kirkwall, to where Shapinsay secondary pupils now travel. The school doubles as a community centre and is host to a learning centre supported by the <a href="UHI%20Millennium%20Institute">UHI Millennium Institute</a>. This centre uses the internet, email and video-conferencing to allow students in Shapinsay to study without leaving the island.

In December 2006, the pupils staged a joint Christmas show with a school in Grinder, Norway, from Shapinsay. The schools used the internet to collaborate, supported by <a href="BT%20Group">BT Group</a> (BT), which upgraded the school's broadband connection. The finale of the show involved the Norwegian pupils singing "Away in a Manger" in English while the Shapinsay pupils responded with "En Stjerne Skinner I Natt" in Norwegian. This multilingual collaboration was somewhat easier for the Grinder pupils, who are taught English from the age of six. This collaboration was part of an ongoing relationship between the schools, whose children exchange letters and cards. Shapinsay school's headteacher has visited the Norwegian school, and there are plans for a reciprocal visit in 2008.

Shapinsay Community School has gained a Silver Award under the international <a href="Eco-Schools">Eco-Schools</a> programme. School pupils have carried out an energy audit, helped to plant more than 600 trees close to the school and carried out energy saving campaigns. Shapinsay pupils have also won an award from the Scottish Crofters Commission for producing a booklet on <a href="crofting">crofting</a> on the island.

Cubbie Roo, the best known Orcadian <a href="Giant%20%28mythology%29">giant</a>, has a presence on Shapinsay. He was originally based on the historical figure Kolbein Hrúga, who built Cubbie Roo's Castle in 1150 on the isle of <a href="Wyre%2C%20Orkney">Wyre</a>, which is possibly the oldest <a href="castle">castle</a> in Scotland, and was mentioned in the "<a href="Orkneyinga%20Saga">Orkneyinga Saga</a>". However, the figure Cubbie Roo has departed far from his historical origins and has become a giant in the fashion that <a href="Finn%20MacCool">Finn MacCool</a> (legendary builder of the <a href="Giant%27s%20Causeway">Giant's Causeway</a>) has in parts of Scotland and Ireland. He is said to have lived on the island of Wyre and used Orkney's islands as stepping stones. Many large stones on Orkney islands, including Shapinsay, are said to have been thrown or left there by the giant. Cubbie Roo's Burn is a waterway on Shapinsay that flows through a channel called "Trolldgeo". Cubbie Roo's Lade is a pile of stones on the shore near Rothiesholm Head, the westmost point of <a href="Stronsay">Stronsay</a>. This is supposedly the beginning of a bridge between the two islands that the giant had failed to complete. The name derives from the Old Norse "trolla-hlad", meaning "giant's causeway".

In 1905, "The Orcadian" newspaper reported that a strange creature had been seen off the coast of Shapinsay. It was reportedly the size of a horse, with a spotted body covered in scales. Opinion on the creature's origin was divided, with some islanders believing it to be a <a href="sea%20serpent">sea serpent</a>, while others opined that it was merely a large seal.

Norman Birkett, 1st Baron Birkett

William Norman Birkett, 1st Baron Birkett, (6 September 1883 – 10 February 1962) was a British <a href="barrister">barrister</a>, judge, politician and preacher who served as the alternate British judge during the <a href="Nuremberg%20Trials">Nuremberg Trials</a>.

Birkett received his education at Barrow-in-Furness Grammar School. He was a Methodist preacher and a <a href="draper">draper</a> before attending <a href="Emmanuel%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Emmanuel College, Cambridge</a> in 1907, to study theology, history and law. Upon graduating in 1910 he worked as a secretary and was <a href="called%20to%20the%20Bar">called to the Bar</a> in 1913.

Declared medically unfit for military service during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Birkett used the time to make up for his late entry into the legal profession and was appointed a <a href="Queen%27s%20Counsel">King's Counsel</a> in 1924. He became a criminal defence lawyer and acted as counsel in a number of famous cases including the second of the <a href="Brighton%20trunk%20murders">Brighton trunk murders</a>. A member of the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a>, he sat in Parliament for <a href="Nottingham%20East%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Nottingham East</a> twice, first in 1923 and again in 1929.

Despite refusing appointment to the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court of Justice</a> in 1928, he was offered the position again in 1941 and accepted, joining the <a href="Queen%27s%20Bench%23Queen%27s%20Bench%20Division">King's Bench Division</a>. In 1945 he served as the alternate British judge at the Nuremberg trials, and he was made a <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Counsellor</a> in 1947. He joined the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">Court of Appeal (England and Wales)</a> in 1950 but retired in 1956 when he had served for long enough to draw a pension. From 1958 he served in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>, and his speech against a <a href="Private%20member%27s%20bill">private bill</a> in 1962 saw it defeated by 70 votes to 36, two days before he died on 10 February 1962.

Described as "one of the most prominent Liberal barristers in the first half of the 20th century" and "the Lord Chancellor that never was", Birkett was noted for his skill as a speaker, which helped him defend clients with almost watertight cases against them. As an alternate judge, Birkett was not allowed a vote at the Nuremberg Trials, but his opinion helped shape the final judgment. During his tenure in the Court of Appeal he oversaw some of the most significant cases of the era, particularly in <a href="English%20contract%20law">contract law</a>, despite his avowed dislike of judicial work.

Five of Birkett's cases were dramatised for radio by Caroline and David Stafford and broadcast on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a>'s "<a href="Afternoon%20Play">Afternoon Play</a>" series, one on 1 June 2010 starring <a href="David%20Haig">David Haig</a> as Birkett and four in January 2012 starring <a href="Neil%20Dudgeon">Neil Dudgeon</a> as Birkett.

Norman was born in <a href="Ulverston">Ulverston</a>, Lancashire (now part of the administrative county of <a href="Cumbria">Cumbria</a>), on 6 September 1883 to Thomas Birkett, a draper, and his wife Agnes, who died in 1884 of tuberculosis. He attended the <a href="Wesleyanism">Wesleyan</a> primary school in Ulverston until 1894, when he moved to Barrow-in-Furness Grammar School. Although intelligent, Birkett was not noted as a particularly academic student and spent as much time on practical jokes as he did on his studies. He left school in 1898, starting work as an apprentice in one of the draper's shops owned by his father and beginning to preach. He was a popular <a href="local%20preacher">local preacher</a> on the local Methodist circuit, and, on deciding that he was unlikely to be a good draper, his father allowed him to leave the business in 1904 to become a minister under Charles Bedale. In 1905, Bedale suggested Birkett should go to <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a> to study history and theology. Birkett liked the idea, having previously conversed with <a href="A.%20C.%20Benson">A. C. Benson</a>, the <a href="Master%20of%20Magdalene%20College">Master of Magdalene College</a>, and applied to <a href="Emmanuel%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Emmanuel College, Cambridge</a>. The college offered him a place, with the condition that he would have to pass an entrance examination and complete the <a href="responsions">responsions</a> to be accepted into the university as a whole. He spent three months learning <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="Biblical%20Greek">Greek</a> and was accepted into the university in October 1907.

At Cambridge, Birkett preached on the local Methodist circuit and at <a href="The%20Leys%20School">The Leys School</a>. He was also active in sport, playing rugby, football and golf. He first spoke at the <a href="Cambridge%20Union%20Society">Cambridge Union Society</a> in his second term at Cambridge on the motion of "this House would welcome the Disestablishment of the Church of England", and the "Cambridge Review" reported that it was "a most interesting speech". In his second year, he was elected to the Emmanuel Debating Society Committee and spoke many times at the Union on subjects including Home Rule for Ireland, cruelty to animals and secular education. He befriended <a href="Arnold%20McNair%2C%201st%20Baron%20McNair">Arnold McNair</a>, the Secretary of the Union, and McNair agreed to put Birkett's name on the electoral papers for election to the Union Committee. Birkett failed to get in, but on running again in 1910 was elected Secretary of the Union by a margin of only six votes. He became Vice-President the following term, and President the term after that. While Birkett was President, the "Cambridge Review" reported that there was "no speaker more sure of pleasing the house", and the speech he gave when <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> visited Cambridge was well received by both Roosevelt and the university as a whole.

He gained a Second Class in the first History <a href="Tripos">Tripos</a> in 1909, and won the English Essay Prize with an essay on political satire in English poetry. He won the same prize again in 1910, and that year gained <a href="British%20undergraduate%20degree%20classification">first-class honours</a> in his Theological Special Examination. By this point, he was having doubts about his future as a minister and consulted with the university <a href="Reader%20%28academic%20rank%29">Law Reader</a> as to the possibility of a career as a <a href="barrister">barrister</a>. On the Reader's advice, Birkett took the second Law Tripos in 1911, passing with second-class honours. Birkett interviewed with the editors of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" and "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" in his search for a job to sustain him while he took the <a href="Bar%20Vocational%20Course">bar exam</a>. He took a job as personal secretary to George Cadbury Junior, with a wage of £200 a year, which he planned to hold until he qualified as a barrister. After only a month of working for Cadbury, his salary was raised to £500, and he was offered a permanent position. While there, he continued his political work and spoke on behalf of the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a>, cementing his reputation as an effective speaker by, on one occasion, holding the attention of more than a thousand people for an hour. He took the first part of the Bar Examination in 1912, but failed the <a href="Test%20%28student%20assessment%29">paper</a> on <a href="real%20property">real property</a>; he passed it on his second attempt, and was <a href="call%20to%20the%20bar">called to the Bar</a> at the <a href="Inner%20Temple">Inner Temple</a> on 4 June 1913.

While working for Cadbury, Birkett befriended Ruth "Billy" Nilsson, and after he had proposed to her several times, she agreed to marry him. Nilsson gave up her position at Bourneville to move to London and they were married on 25 August 1920. They had two children, a daughter Linnea Birkett on 27 June 1923, and a son <a href="Michael%20Birkett%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Birkett">Michael Birkett</a> on 22 October 1929. A keen golfer, he was a member of the <a href="Harewood%20Downs%20Golf%20Club">Harewood Downs Golf Club</a>, near <a href="Amersham">Amersham</a>, Buckinghamshire.

After qualifying as a barrister, he moved to <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> in 1914, choosing the city because he had some connections there thanks to his association with Cadbury, and began work at the <a href="Chambers%20%28law%29">chambers</a> of John Hurst. His career was aided by the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>; many of the younger and fitter barristers were called up for war service, whilst Birkett himself, who was thirty when he joined the bar, avoided <a href="conscription">conscription</a> as he was declared medically unfit. He was suffering from tuberculosis, and he returned to Ulverston for six months to recover. During his time in Birmingham, he continued his work as a minister, regularly preaching at the Baptist People's Chapel.

Birkett became a popular defence counsel, something that on occasion caused him trouble; he was once forced to refuse a defendant's request to act as his representative because Birkett was expected in a different court. He impressed the Bench in Birmingham so much that, in 1919, he was advised by a local Circuit Judge to move to London to advance his career. Although he was initially hesitant, saying that "competition in London is on quite a different scale, and if I failed there, I would have lost everything I have built up here", a case he took in 1920 changed the situation. He acted as a <a href="Junior%20barrister">junior</a> for the prosecution in the so-called <a href="Green%20Bicycle%20Case">Green Bicycle Case</a> against <a href="Edward%20Marshall-Hall">Edward Marshall-Hall</a>. Although he lost, he sufficiently impressed Marshall-Hall for the latter to offer him a place in his chambers in London. He had no connections with the solicitors in London, and the clerk at his new chambers got around this lack of contacts by using him as counsel in cases involving Marshall-Hall, who as a <a href="King%27s%20Counsel">King's Counsel</a> could appear in court only when accompanied by a junior barrister such as Birkett.

His father had been a supporter of the Liberal Party, and Birkett had helped campaign for them during the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201906">1906 general election</a>. He had been invited to become the Liberal candidate for Cambridge in 1911, but he refused because he had no income; he did, however, help his employer George Cadbury, Jr. get elected as a Liberal Councillor in Birmingham and helped start a branch of the <a href="National%20League%20of%20Young%20Liberals">National League of Young Liberals</a> in the city.
Birkett was the Liberal candidate for <a href="Birmingham%20King%27s%20Norton%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Birmingham King's Norton</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201918">1918 general election</a>, but lost to <a href="Herbert%20Austin%2C%201st%20Baron%20Austin">Herbert Austin</a>. Birkett's political career took off in 1923. He ran for <a href="Nottingham%20East%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Nottingham East</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201923">1923 general election</a>, and was elected with a majority of 1,436 votes, a feat that was described as an "overwhelming victory" since the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> had held the seat since 1910 and had a majority of 4,000 at the previous election.

Birkett's maiden speech in Parliament responded to a proposal by <a href="Charles%20Dukes%2C%201st%20Baron%20Dukeston">Charles Dukes</a>, a <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> Member of Parliament, in favour of state pensions for widows with children, and wives whose husbands were unable to work because of injury. Birkett went further than the proposed change and suggested that pensions should be provided to unmarried mothers, deserted wives and divorced wives. His speech was well-received; the "Nottingham Journal" described it as making "a most excellent impression" on the House of Commons, and <a href="Charles%20Masterman">Charles Masterman</a> called him "a possible future Lord Chancellor". Because of his focus on his career as a barrister rather than as a politician, Birkett rarely appeared in the House of Commons, but he worked hard when he did attend. On one occasion, he spent all night in a Parliamentary session that ended at 6 a.m. and then attended a court session the next day.

He applied to become a <a href="King%27s%20Counsel">King's Counsel</a> in 1924, since barristers who were also <a href="parliament%20of%20England">parliamentarians</a> stood a higher chance of getting accepted than others. He was accepted on 15 April 1924 and sworn in on the same day. His promotion was met with approval from several noted judges, including <a href="Frederick%20Greer%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fairfield">Frederick Greer</a>, later a <a href="Lord%20Justice%20of%20Appeal">Lord Justice of Appeal</a>, who wrote that "unless my judgement is very much astray, you will quickly acquire a leading place in the front row", a feeling which was echoed by other justices including <a href="William%20Finlay%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Finlay">William Finlay</a>, who wrote that "I am confident that you will rise to the top of the profession, and I shall very greatly rejoice when my confidence is justified." In his first year as a <a href="King%27s%20Counsel">King's Counsel</a> Birkett earned £8,600, double what he had taken the previous year as a junior brief.

In 1924, the <a href="Campbell%20Case">Campbell Case</a> brought down the Labour <a href="minority%20government">minority government</a> and forced a <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201924">general election</a>. Birkett returned to Nottingham East to campaign for his re-election, though he faced a much more difficult job than he had in 1923. The Conservative candidate, <a href="Edmund%20Brocklebank">Edmund Brocklebank</a>, was much stronger than in the previous election, and the left-wing vote was split because he was also campaigning against <a href="Tom%20Mann">Tom Mann</a>, a noted Communist. A few days before the election, a <a href="Zinoviev%20letter">letter</a> allegedly addressed to the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">Communist Party</a> was published that mentioned organising uprisings in British colonies; fear of the "socialist menace" drove many voters to the right, and in the election on 29 October 1924, many Liberal members of parliament, including Birkett, lost their seats to Conservatives.

While working with Marshall-Hall, Birkett was involved in several notable criminal cases that helped cement his reputation as an outstanding speaker at <a href="Call%20to%20the%20bar">the Bar</a>.

In 1925, a case known as the "Bachelor's Case" came up at the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court of Justice</a> between Lieutenant-Colonel Ian Dennistoun and his ex-wife Dorothy Dennistoun. When the Dennistouns divorced, Mr. Dennistoun could not pay <a href="ancillary%20relief">ancillary relief</a>. He instead promised that he would provide for his ex-wife in the future when he had the money. Some time after the divorce, Mr. Dennistoun married <a href="Almina%20Herbert%2C%20Countess%20of%20Carnarvon">Almina Herbert, Countess of Carnarvon</a>, the widow of <a href="George%20Herbert%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Carnarvon">Lord Carnarvon</a>, a rich woman thanks to the terms of her husband's will, who provided for her new husband. After hearing about this, Dorothy Dennistoun demanded the alimony money she had been promised. Lady Carnarvon saw this as blackmail and persuaded her new husband to take his wife to court for what <a href="Henry%20McCardie">Sir Henry McCardie</a>, who tried the case, called "the most bitterly conducted litigation I have ever known". Marshall-Hall and Birkett both worked on the case representing Lady Carnarvon and Mr. Dennistoun, while <a href="Ellis%20Hume-Williams">Ellis Hume-Williams</a>, one of the most respected divorce barristers of the day, represented Mrs. Dennistoun.

The case initially appeared to be going badly for Marshall-Hall. An inept cross-examination on his part weakened his argument, and an illness made him irritable and short-tempered. On the advice of his clerk, he asked Birkett to make the closing address before the court, which turned the mood of the courtroom completely and an initially hostile jury decided to disregard the agreement of Mr. Dennistoun to pay ancillary relief to his former wife. Birkett's performance made the front pages of many evening newspapers, including "<a href="The%20Daily%20Mail">The Daily Mail</a>" which described Birkett as "the greatest legal discovery of the year" and called his speech "a brilliant piece of advocacy". His work for this case and the newspaper coverage of it brought him to the attention of many London solicitors, and led to him earning £8,000 in the first seven months of 1925. In that year he made £12,000 overall, an amount which rose to £16,500 in 1926 and peaked in 1929 when he earned £33,500. On meeting <a href="Miles%20Malleson">Miles Malleson</a>, an old friend from his time at Cambridge, he said in surprise "did you know, Miles, that I am making more money than I thought existed in the world!"

Birkett was returned as MP for Nottingham East at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201929">general election</a> on 31 May 1929 in which he won 14,049 votes, taking the seat with a majority of 2,939.
As the largest single party, the Labour Party formed a <a href="minority%20government">minority government</a> and set about filling the ministerial posts. The Labour Party had few experienced lawyers in the House of Commons, so Labour Prime Minister <a href="Ramsay%20MacDonald">Ramsay MacDonald</a> attempted to lure prominent Liberal lawyers to fill the positions of <a href="Attorney%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Attorney General</a> and <a href="Solicitor%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Solicitor General for England and Wales</a>. <a href="William%20Jowitt%2C%201st%20Earl%20Jowitt">William Jowitt</a> defected to the Labour Party in exchange for the position of Attorney General, and the position of Solicitor General was offered to Birkett. Birkett replied that "he could not change his politics in twenty-five minutes, and even if the Liberal Party should disintegrate completely, he would not be seen taking refuge in the Labour ark".

Despite having to juggle his career at the Bar and as a member of parliament, Birkett kept up a good attendance in the House of Commons, and along with <a href="John%20Simon%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Simon">Sir John Simon</a> he became the leading Liberal spokesperson on the legal side of legislation. His attack on a clause of the <a href="Finance%20Act%201930">Finance Act 1930</a> drew much praise from both Liberal and Conservative politicians, including <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, who said that "I have rarely heard a speech more precisely directed at the object under debate, more harmoniously attuned to the character of Committee discussion, than the excellent statement the Honourable and learned Gentleman has just made". Birkett led the Liberal response to the Labour proposal of the Trade Disputes Bill 1931 and "reduced it to tatters", although the Bill passed because of some Liberal abstentions. The speech was a particularly well-received one and led MacDonald to again offer the position of Solicitor General to Birkett, as the incumbent postholder <a href="James%20Melville%20%28politician%29">James Melville</a> was about to resign. Again Birkett refused, and <a href="Stafford%20Cripps">Stafford Cripps</a> was appointed. When the Liberal Party returned to power in 1931 in coalition with the Conservatives and <a href="National%20Labour%20Organisation">National Labour</a> as part of MacDonald's <a href="National%20Government%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Government</a>, it was expected that Birkett would be offered the position being a Liberal Member of Parliament, but by the time they proposed candidates for Solicitor General, the Liberals had exceeded their ministerial quota agreed to in the coalition. Birkett was offered a non-legal office but said that he "could not contemplate a post that meant giving up my practice".

After an economic crisis in 1931, the King dissolved parliament and Birkett returned to Nottingham East to defend his seat; his main opponent was the Conservative, <a href="Louis%20Gluckstein">Louis Gluckstein</a>, who had challenged him in the 1929 election. The Conservative Party's support of <a href="protectionism">protectionism</a> met with approval from the electorate, as most were employed in industries which had suffered after the institution of <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a>. Gluckstein won the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201931">general election</a> on 27 October 1931 with a majority of 5,583 votes.

On 3 November, Birkett was informed that if he had been returned, the Prime Minister intended to make him Solicitor-General. Disillusioned with the circumstances of the election, Birkett "[bade] farewell to East Nottingham" and retired from politics. He was invited to become a Liberal candidate two more times; once in 1931 for <a href="Torquay%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Torquay</a> and once in 1932 for <a href="North%20Cornwall%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">North Cornwall</a>. The second was a tempting offer; the seat had become vacant on the death of its previous holder, a <a href="National%20Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%2C%201931%29">National Liberal</a> with a comfortable majority, and it was felt that Birkett was almost certain to be returned to Parliament. Despite this, he refused, disliking the National Liberal policies and the extent to which they had aligned themselves with the Conservative Party.

In 1930, Birkett was involved in the so-called <a href="Blazing%20Car%20murder">Blazing Car murder</a> case. On 6 November 1930, two men returning home in Northampton noticed a bright light in the distance and saw a man come out of a ditch at the side of the road, glance back toward the light and say "looks like somebody has had a bonfire". The two young men ran toward the light, saw it was a burning car and fetched a policeman. When the fires died away, a body was found inside the boot of a car with a face so charred it was impossible to determine the identity of the man; the numberplate of the car was intact, however, and traced to an Alfred Arthur Rouse. Rouse was arrested and appeared at Northampton Crown Court on 26 January 1931, charged with the murder of an unknown man. He was defended by <a href="Donald%20Finnemore">Donald Finnemore</a>, and the Crown was represented by Birkett and <a href="Richard%20Elwes">Richard Elwes</a>. Rouse was damned by a series of events. When arrested, he made statements such as "I'm very glad it's over" and "I'm responsible" and that the car engine had been off at the time of the fire, ruling out the possibility of accidental ignition. When he appeared as a witness, the defendant claimed that after giving an unknown man a lift, he had found that he was running out of petrol and had asked the passenger to take the spare can in the car and fill up the fuel tank. While he was doing this, Rouse testified that he went to the side of the road to urinate, and while there heard a large explosion. He said he saw a large flame and became convinced the petrol tank would explode. As such he ran away as fast as possible, at which point he ran into the two young men on the road.

The cross-examination of him and other witnesses by Birkett swayed the jury, and they took only fifteen minutes to find Rouse guilty of murder. After his appeal had been rejected by both the Court of Appeal and the Home Secretary, Rouse admitted that he had in fact committed the murder – although he never gave a reason – it was theorised that he had done so in an attempt to fake his own death. Despite his admission of guilt the identity of the victim has never been discovered.

In 1934, Birkett acted as counsel for the second of the two <a href="Brighton%20trunk%20murders">Brighton trunk murders</a>, a case which was described as "his greatest triumph in a capital case". In June 1934, a woman's torso was found in a suitcase in <a href="Brighton%20railway%20station">Brighton railway station</a>. The legs were discovered at <a href="London%20King%27s%20Cross%20railway%20station">King's Cross station</a> the next day, but her head and arms were never found, and the case is still unsolved. A woman by the name of Violette Kaye had disappeared, and the appearance of the first woman's body prompted greater scrutiny on Kaye's case. On 14 July, they interviewed Toni Mancini, Kaye's boyfriend, who convinced them that the dead woman could not possibly be Kaye; the dead woman had been identified as around thirty five years old and five months pregnant, while Kaye was ten years older. Kaye was last seen alive on 10 May looking distressed in the doorway to her house and had been scheduled to visit her sister in London who received a telegram on 11 May reading "Going abroad. Good job. Sail Sunday. Will write. Vi." in block capitals. The post office clerks could not remember who sent it, but experts testified that the handwriting on the telegram had similarities to that on a menu written by Mancini. On 14 May, with the help of another man, Mancini moved his belongings from the house he shared with Kaye, which included a large trunk which was too heavy to move by hand. Mancini had told people that he had broken up with Kaye and she had moved to Paris, and that before she left he had beaten her. He later said to a friend, "What is the good of knocking a woman about with your fists? You only hurt yourself. You should hit her with a hammer same as I did and [chop] her up." A hammerhead was later found in the rubbish at his old house.

After the police had left on 14 July, Mancini got on a train to London. When the police arrived the next morning, they were unable to find Mancini but found Kaye's body decomposing in the trunk in his new home. They immediately sent out a country-wide call for Mancini to be arrested, and he was picked up near London. He claimed he was not guilty, and stated during interviews with police that he had returned home to find Kaye dead. Fearing that with his criminal record, the police would not believe him, he had hidden the body in a trunk. While Mancini was in prison, his solicitor phoned Birkett and asked him to work as counsel for the defence, which Birkett agreed to do. In his defence, Birkett highlighted flaws in the prosecution's case to introduce an element of doubt in the minds of the jury. His cross-examination of Sir Bernard Spilsbury, famous Home Office pathologist and potentially the most dangerous witness for the Crown, was seen as "masterly". Birkett also emphasised the affectionate nature of the relationship between Kaye and Mancini before Kaye's death. Despite strong evidence that he had committed the crime, including marks on the victim's skull believed to be from a hammer and marks of blood on Mancini's clothing, the jury found Mancini innocent after two and a half hours of deliberations. Mancini later confessed to the murder before dying.

In May 1937 Birkett was appointed Chairman of the Inter-Departmental Committee for Abortion set up by the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Health">Minister of Health</a> and <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, preparing a report "to inquire into the prevalence of abortion, and the law relating thereto, and to consider what steps can be taken by more effective enforcement of the law", something which occupied him for two years. During the summer of 1937, Birkett was asked to represent the English Bar at the annual meeting of the <a href="Canadian%20Bar%20Association">Canadian Bar Association</a> in Toronto, where he was a popular speaker. In January 1938, he was asked to act as a Commissioner of Assize to open the <a href="Assize%20Court">Assize Court</a> in Aylesbury, dealing with an average of ten cases a day. After the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in 1939, he became a member of a committee advising the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> on the detention of suspected enemy agents. The committee dealt with more than 1,500 cases in two years. Although the work was unpaid, he was knighted (as a <a href="knight%20bachelor">knight bachelor</a>) on 6 June 1941 as a reward for his work. He also delivered weekly radio broadcasts after the Friday night news to counter the broadcasts of <a href="William%20Joyce">William Joyce</a>, known as <a href="Lord%20Haw%20Haw">Lord Haw Haw</a>. The first broadcast took place on 9 February 1940, and they were considered to be a morale boost during the so-called <a href="Phony%20War">Phony War</a>.

Birkett had been offered appointment to the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">High Court</a> as early as 1928, but turned it down, saying that "I wasn't really drawn to the judicial office... I loved the Bar too much". After the death of the High Court judge <a href="Anthony%20Hawke">Sir Anthony Hawke</a> in October 1941, the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> <a href="John%20Simon%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Simon">Lord Simon</a> offered Birkett the seat. Birkett considered it his "public duty" to join the bench and wrote back on 4 November accepting the offer. He was sworn in on 11 November 1941 and first sat on 24 November. He did not enjoy his time in the high courts, admitting that he "missed the limelight" of being an advocate, and, combined with ill-health, he suffered from depression in 1942. He was, however, a popular judge, although he felt he was too weak in his judgments because he "did not desire to hurt people's feelings". At one point, the "<a href="Daily%20Herald%20%28UK%20newspaper%29">Daily Herald</a>" reported he was to be made <a href="Viceroy%20of%20India">Viceroy of India</a>. For several weeks in 1943, he sat in the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Court of Appeal</a> before departing on an <a href="Assize">Assize</a> visit. He fell ill after a few weeks with a combination of heart disease and pneumonia, and he returned home to recover. He suffered from more illness over the next year and considered resigning as a judge, as he felt that he could no longer trust his abilities as one. During his time in the High Court, he dealt with several notable cases including "<a href="Constantine%20v%20Imperial%20Hotels%20Ltd">Constantine v Imperial Hotels Ltd</a>", which reaffirmed the common law principle that innkeepers must not refuse accommodation to guests without just cause.

On 30 August 1945, Birkett received a letter from the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> asking him to serve as the British judge at the <a href="Nuremberg%20Trials">Nuremberg Trials</a> of German War Criminals. He accepted, saying that it was "a great honour to be selected". But when he went to London to discuss it, he was informed that the <a href="Foreign%20Office">Foreign Office</a> wanted a more senior judge to be in attendance, ideally a Law Lord, but since no Law Lord was available, they had requested that a judge from the Court of Appeal should be appointed. <a href="Geoffrey%20Lawrence%2C%201st%20Baron%20Oaksey">Geoffrey Lawrence</a> was made the main British judge, and Birkett was offered the position of alternate judge for the trials, which he accepted, although with less enthusiasm than he had shown when accepting the original offer. He became friends with the American judge <a href="Francis%20Biddle">Francis Biddle</a>, although when they first met he accidentally confused him with <a href="Anthony%20Joseph%20Drexel%20Biddle%2C%20Jr.">Anthony Drexel Biddle</a> and remarked how useful his diplomatic training would be in the trials.

The trial lasted from 18 October 1945 to 30 September 1946, and although Birkett did not have a vote in the proceedings as an alternate judge, his opinion was given weight, and it helped sway the decisions made by the main judges. After returning home from the trials, he received praise from both the Lord Chancellor, who said that "The country owes much to him for vindicating our conceptions of an impartial trial under the rule of law", and from <a href="John%20J.%20Parker">John Parker</a>, the American alternate judge, who wrote that:

Although only an alternate member of the tribunal without a vote, his voice was heard in all of its deliberations, his hand drafted a large and most important part of its judgment, and no one connected with the tribunal, member or otherwise, had a greater part than he in shaping the final result. If, as I confidently believe, the work of the tribunal will constitute a landmark in the development of world order based on law, to Norman Birkett must go a large share of the credit for the success of the undertaking. To few men does the opportunity come to labour so mightily for the welfare of their kind.
After the judges returned home, Lawrence was made a Baron for his work at Nuremberg, but Birkett received nothing. The lack of reward for his work pushed him into depression, which he took many months to recover from. He was eventually made a <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Most%20Honourable%20Privy%20Council">Privy Counsellor</a> in the 1947 Birthday Honours list, but he saw this as poor reward for the work he had put in at Nuremberg.

The rest of his time in the High Court passed uneventfully, but he continued to be unhappy with his work as a judge, noting that "I am nervous of myself, without much confidence in my judgment and hesitant about my sentences and damages and things of that kind. I have felt no glow of achievement in any summing up, though none of them have been bad."

He was again struck by depression in 1948 when <a href="Lord%20Denning">Sir Alfred Thompson Denning</a> and <a href="John%20Edward%20Singleton">Sir John Singleton</a> were both appointed to the Court of Appeal ahead of him, despite having been appointed to the High Court after him. On 30 July 1949, Birkett went to the Lord Chancellor and discussed the possibility of his appointment to the Court of Appeal, but left dissatisfied. On 14 November, a <a href="duodenal%20ulcer">duodenal ulcer</a> perforated, from which he spent six months recovering. In an attempt to appease him, the Lord Chancellor offered Birkett a peerage without salary on 8 May 1950, but he refused as he lacked the means to survive without paid employment. While speaking at a conference in Washington, D.C. on 31 August 1950, he received a telegram from the Lord Chancellor offering him appointment to the Court of Appeal; he immediately wired back his acceptance. He was sworn in on 2 October, and heard his first case the following day.

He found the work in the Court of Appeal dull, and his disappointment increased the longer he worked. As in the High Court, he felt uncertain about his judgements and unsure as to whether he was affecting the law. Despite his personal opinion of himself, the judiciary as a whole felt that his mix of humanity and common sense was beneficial to the court. During the 1951 <a href="Holiday%23Vacation">Long Vacation</a> he broadcast three talks for the BBC on the subject of international law and its growth and gave a speech for the <a href="Law%20Society%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Law Society</a> titled "The Lawyer's Contribution to Society". Despite his unhappiness with his work in the Court of Appeal, he worked until 1956, when his long service as a judge allowed him to draw a pension. In his remaining time in the Court of Appeal, Birkett judged several notable cases, in particular "<a href="Pharmaceutical%20Society%20of%20Great%20Britain%20v%20Boots%20Cash%20Chemists%20%28Southern%29%20Ltd">Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemists (Southern) Ltd</a>" [1953] 1 QB 401, and "<a href="Entores%20Ltd%20v%20Miles%20Far%20East%20Corporation">Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corporation</a>" [1955] 2 QB 327, where the court made a landmark decision on <a href="Agreement%20in%20English%20law">acceptance</a> of a contract in relation to <a href="Telegraphy%23Telex">Telex</a>. From April 1958 to October 1961 he sat as a Law Lord, where his cases included "<a href="De%20Demko%20v%20Home%20Secretary">De Demko v Home Secretary</a>" [1959] AC 654 and "<a href="Ostime%20v%20Duple%20Motor%20Bodies%20Ltd">Ostime v Duple Motor Bodies Ltd</a>" [1960] AC 459.

On 13 June 1957 he became chairman of a committee of <a href="Privy%20Counsellor">Privy Counsellor</a>s holding an inquiry into the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>'s use of <a href="telephone%20tapping">telephone tapping</a>. After twenty-nine meetings, Birkett drafted a report which he passed on to Parliament supporting the use of telephone taps and noting their effectiveness. On 9 December, a letter arrived from the Prime Minister offering him a <a href="peerage">peerage</a>. He accepted, and his name appeared in the New Year Honours list, and was created Baron Birkett, "of Ulverston in the County of Lancaster", and took his seat in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> on 20 February 1958. In the same year, he was awarded a <a href="Legum%20Doctor">LLD</a> by the University of Cambridge, where the speaker said that Birkett was "endowed with such a voice as <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> declared to be first requisite of an orator" and that "in our own time there had been no one more skilled in swaying the mind of a jury." In February 1959, he appeared on the first episode of the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> television program "<a href="Face%20to%20Face%20%28British%20TV%20series%29">Face to Face</a>", where he was described as "one of the three or four greatest criminal lawyers of this century, and perhaps one of the three or four greatest criminal lawyers of all time". Outside politics and the law, he also served as <a href="Livery%20Company%23Governance">Master</a> of the <a href="Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Curriers">Worshipful Company of Curriers</a> four times.

Birkett tried to sit as regularly in the House of Lords as possible, and made his <a href="maiden%20speech">maiden speech</a> on 8 April 1959 on the subject of crime in the United Kingdom. In May, he moved the first reading of the <a href="Obscene%20Publications%20Act%201959">Obscene Publications Bill</a>, which passed with support from both sides of the house. Privately, Birkett believed that "there will never be a satisfactory law in England about obscenity. Our 1959 Act is the best we have yet done." In 1961, he was again invited by the BBC to give a series of talks on the <a href="BBC%20Home%20Service">BBC Home Service</a>, this time titled "Six Great Advocates". He picked <a href="Edward%20Marshall-Hall">Edward Marshall-Hall</a>, <a href="Patrick%20Hastings">Patrick Hastings</a>, <a href="Edward%20George%20Clarke">Edward Clarke</a>, <a href="Rufus%20Isaacs%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Reading">Rufus Isaacs</a>, <a href="Charles%20Russell%2C%20Baron%20Russell%20of%20Killowen">Charles Russell</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Erskine%2C%201st%20Baron%20Erskine">Thomas Erskine</a>. He sat for the last time in the House of Lords on 8 February 1962, where he made a speech criticising an element of the Manchester Corporation Bill which would have water drained from <a href="Ullswater">Ullswater</a> to meet the needs of the growing population in Manchester. His speech was "deeply felt and eloquent", and when the votes were announced, Birkett and his supporters had won by 70 votes to 36. The Ullswater Yacht Club now holds an annual Lord Birkett Memorial Trophy Race on the lake.

The next morning he complained of heart trouble, collapsed shortly after lunch and was taken to the hospital. The doctors discovered that he had ruptured an important blood vessel and immediate surgery was needed to fix it. The operation failed to fix the problem, and he died early in the morning on 10 February 1962. His son, <a href="Michael%20Birkett%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Birkett">Michael</a>, succeeded him as Baron Birkett.

HMS Formidable (67)

HMS "Formidable" was an ordered for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> before the Second World War. After being completed in late 1940, she was briefly assigned to the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a> before being transferred to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet">Mediterranean Fleet</a> as a replacement for her crippled <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> . "Formidable"s aircraft played a key role in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Matapan">Battle of Cape Matapan</a> in early 1941, and they subsequently provided cover for Allied ships and attacked <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis forces</a> until their carrier was badly damaged by German <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s in May.

Assigned to the <a href="Eastern%20Fleet">Eastern Fleet</a> in the Indian Ocean in early 1942, "Formidable" covered <a href="Operation%20Ironclad">the invasion of Diego Suarez</a> in <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy</a> <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> in mid-1942 against the possibility of a <a href="sortie">sortie</a> by the Japanese into the Indian Ocean. "Formidable" returned home for a brief refit before participating in <a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation "Torch"</a>, the invasion of <a href="French%20North%20Africa">French North Africa</a> in November. She remained in the Mediterranean and covered the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sicily">invasions of Sicily</a> and <a href="Operation%20Avalanche">mainland Italy</a> in 1943 before beginning a lengthy refit.

"Formidable" made several attacks on the in Norway in mid-1944 as part of the Home Fleet. She was subsequently assigned to the <a href="British%20Pacific%20Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a> (BPF) in 1945 where she played a supporting role during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">Battle of Okinawa</a> and later attacked targets in the <a href="Japanese%20Home%20Islands">Japanese Home Islands</a>. The ship was used to repatriate liberated Allied <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> and soldiers after the <a href="Japanese%20surrender">Japanese surrender</a> and then ferried British personnel across the globe through 1946. She was placed in <a href="Reserve%20fleet">reserve</a> the following year and sold for <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a> in 1953.

The Royal Navy's <a href="British%201936%20Naval%20Programme">1936 Naval Programme</a> authorised the construction of two aircraft carriers. <a href="Admiral%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Admiral</a> Sir <a href="Reginald%20Henderson">Reginald Henderson</a>, <a href="Third%20Sea%20Lord">Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy</a>, was determined not to simply modify the previous unarmoured design. He believed that carriers could not be successfully defended by their own aircraft without some form of early-warning system. Lacking that, there was nothing to prevent land-based aircraft from attacking them, especially in confined waters like the <a href="North%20Sea">North</a> and <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>s. This meant that the ship had to be capable of remaining in action after sustaining damage, and that her fragile aircraft had to be protected entirely from damage. The only way to do this was to completely armour the <a href="hangar">hangar</a> in which the aircraft would shelter, but putting that much weight so high in the ship allowed only a single-storey hangar due to stability concerns. This halved the aircraft capacity of the "Illustrious" class compared with the older unarmoured carriers, trading offensive potential for defensive survivability.

"Formidable" was in <a href="length%20overall">length overall</a> and at the <a href="waterline">waterline</a>. Her <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> was at the waterline and she had a <a href="draught%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. She displaced at <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29%23Standard%20displacement">standard load</a> as completed. Her complement was approximately 1,299 men upon completion in 1940. The ship had three <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each driving one shaft, using steam supplied by six <a href="Admiralty%203-drum%20boiler">Admiralty 3-drum boiler</a>s. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , enough to give a maximum speed of . On <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, "Formidable" reached with . She carried a maximum of of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, which gave her a range of at .

The armoured <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a> had a usable length of , due to prominent "round-downs" at bow and stern to reduce air turbulence, and a maximum width of . A single hydraulic <a href="aircraft%20catapult">aircraft catapult</a> was fitted on the forward part of the flight deck. The ship was equipped with two unarmoured <a href="Elevator%23Aircraft%20elevators">lifts</a> on the centreline, each of which measured . The hangar was long and had a maximum width of . It had a height of , which allowed storage of <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a> <a href="Vought%20F4U%20Corsair">Vought F4U Corsair</a> fighters once their wingtips were clipped. The ship could accommodate up to 54 aircraft rather than the intended 36 after the adoption of "outriggers" on the flight deck during the war and the flattening of the "round-downs" that increased the usable length of the flight deck to to facilitate the use of a permanent deck park. The additional crewmen, maintenance personnel and facilities needed to support the extra aircraft severely crowded the ship. She was provided with of <a href="avgas">aviation gasoline</a>.

The ship's main armament consisted of sixteen <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing (QF)</a> <a href="QF%204.5-inch%20Mk%20I%20%E2%80%93%20V%20naval%20gun"></a> <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a>s in eight twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s that were mounted in <a href="sponson">sponson</a>s on the side of the hull. The roofs of the gun turrets protruded above the level of the flight deck to allow them to fire across the deck at high elevations. The gun had a maximum range of . Her light anti-aircraft defences consisted of six octuple mounts for <a href="QF%202-pounder%20naval%20gun">QF two-pounder ("pom-pom")</a> <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft (AA) guns</a>, two each fore and aft of the <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23I">island</a> and two in sponsons on the port side of the hull. The two-pounder gun had a maximum range of .

While under repair in late 1941, "Formidable"s light AA armament was augmented by the addition of 10 <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">Oerlikon 20 mm</a> <a href="autocannon">autocannon</a> in single mounts with a maximum range of . By the time of her last recorded refit in March 1944, she had exchanged one octuple "pom-pom" mount for a quadruple mount and had a total of 20 twin and 14 single mounts. Before seeing combat against the Japanese, some were replaced by <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun">40 mm Bofors</a> AA guns as the 20 mm shell was unlikely to destroy a <a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a> before it hit the ship. The <a href="Bofors">Bofors</a> gun had a maximum range of . By the war's end the ship had all six of her original octuple "pom-pom" mounts, five single power-operated mounts, seven single 40 mm "Boffin" mounts and 11 twin and 12 single 20 mm mounts.

"Formidable" was completed with a <a href="Type%2079%20radar">Type 79</a> <a href="early%20warning%20radar">early-warning radar</a>. The specifics of the additional radars fitted during the war are not readily available, but she probably had, by the end of the war, a <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20277">Type 277</a> surface-search/<a href="Height%20finder">height-finding radar</a> on top of the <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> and a <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20293">Type 293</a> target-indicator radar on the <a href="foremast">foremast</a>. She also probably mounted Type 279 and <a href="Type%20281%20radar">Type 281</a>B early-warning radars, based on those fitted aboard her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> . In addition, <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20282">Type 282</a> and Type 285 gunnery radars were mounted on the <a href="Ship%20gun%20fire-control%20system">fire-control directors</a>.

The "Illustrious"-class ships had a flight deck protected by of armour, and the internal sides and ends of the hangars were thick. The hangar deck itself was thick and extended the full width of the ship to meet the top of the 4.5-inch waterline <a href="Belt%20armor">armour belt</a>. The belt was closed by 2.5-inch transverse <a href="Bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>s fore and aft. The <a href="torpedo%20belt">underwater defence system</a> was a layered system of liquid- and air-filled compartments backed by a splinter bulkhead.

"Formidable" was ordered as part of the 1937 Naval Programme from <a href="Harland%20and%20Wolff">Harland & Wolff</a>. She was <a href="Keel%20laying">laid down</a> at their <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a> shipyard on 17 June 1937 as <a href="yard%20number">yard number</a> 1007 and <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 17 August 1939. Just before the launch ceremony was to begin, the wooden cradle supporting the ship collapsed, and the ship slid down the <a href="slipway">slipway</a> while workmen were still underneath and around the ship. One spectator was killed by flying debris and at least 20 others were injured; "Formidable", however, was not damaged. Because of the incident, the carrier was referred to as "The Ship That Launched Herself". She was commissioned on 24 November 1940.

After a very brief <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23W">work up</a>, the <a href="Fairey%20Albacore">Fairey Albacore</a> <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s of <a href="826%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">826</a> and <a href="829%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">829 Squadrons</a> and the <a href="Fairey%20Fulmar">Fairey Fulmar</a> fighters of <a href="803%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">803 Squadron</a> flew aboard and she joined the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow on 12 December. Her stay there was brief as she, escorted by the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a>s and , sailed on 18 December to protect convoys and search for the , which had recently attacked <a href="Convoy%20HX%2084">Convoy HX 84</a> in the North Atlantic. They failed to find the <a href="commerce%20raider">commerce raider</a> and escorted a convoy to <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, South Africa, arriving on 22 January 1941. Four days later the ship was ordered north to replace her sister "Illustrious" with the Mediterranean Fleet after she had been badly damaged by German <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s. En route, she took the opportunity to attack Italian forces in <a href="Italian%20Somaliland">Italian Somaliland</a> and <a href="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>. They sank the steamer on 12 February for the loss of two Albacores.

Several weeks later, she made a cautious transit of the recently <a href="naval%20mine">mined</a> <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> and reached <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> on 10 March. 829 Squadron was issued <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a> torpedo bombers to replace its losses around this time. On 20 March "Formidable" escorted a convoy to <a href="Malta">Malta</a> and flew off five aircraft for <a href="Crete">Crete</a> while returning to Alexandria. On the morning of 27 March, major elements of the Italian Fleet were spotted en route to the sea lanes between Egypt and Greece, and the carrier sailed later that afternoon to intercept them. Reinforced by three Fulmars from <a href="806%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">806 Squadron</a>, her air group only numbered 13 Fulmars, 10 Albacores and 4 Swordfish. An Albacore spotted the leading Italian ships the next morning; a strike force of six Albacores was loaded with torpedoes and began to attack the . Two German <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2088">Junkers Ju 88</a> bombers intervened, but they were driven off by the escorting pair of Fulmars. The attack was unsuccessful, and another strike force of three Albacores and two Swordfish was prepared. Shortly after launching them at 12:22, "Formidable" was unsuccessfully attacked by a pair of torpedo-carrying <a href="Savoia-Marchetti%20SM.79">Savoia-Marchetti SM.79</a> bombers. Around 14:50, one Albacore succeeded in torpedoing the Italian battleship, although the other aircraft missed. The hit briefly knocked out her engines and caused heavy flooding. Another air strike of six Albacores and two Swordfish was launched at 17:30 to finish off the crippled battleship, but they mistook the for the battleship in the fading light. The cruiser was struck by a single torpedo from one of the aircraft, possibly from one of two Swordfish from <a href="815%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">815 Squadron</a> from <a href="Maleme">Maleme</a>, Crete, that linked up with "Formidable"s aircraft before the attack. The mistake allowed the battleship to reach port. One Albacore was shot down by "Vittorio Veneto", and two others were forced to <a href="Water%20landing">ditch</a> after running out of fuel during the day's operations.

On 18 April the Mediterranean Fleet sortied to bombard the primary Axis supply port of <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a> and was attacked by a pair of torpedo-carrying SM.79s from <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>. They were intercepted by a pair of Fulmars that damaged one bomber badly enough that it <a href="Emergency%20landing">crash-landed</a> back at its base, although one Fulmar was also forced to crash-land aboard "Formidable". The next day Fulmars from 806 Squadron shot down one <a href="CANT%20Z.1007">CANT Z.1007</a> bomber flying from <a href="Cyrenica">Cyrenica</a> to <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> and a pair of <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2052">Junkers Ju 52</a> transports flying fuel to North Africa. On the morning of 21 April, the carrier's aircraft dropped flares to illuminate the port so it could be shelled by three <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s and a <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>. On the way home, a pair of Fulmars shot down a <a href="Dornier%20Do%2024">Dornier Do 24</a> <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a>.

During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece%23Evacuation%20of%20Empire%20forces">Evacuation of Greece</a>, "Formidable" provided air cover for Convoy GA-15 on 29 April. A Fulmar from 803 Squadron was forced to ditch on 2 May before the carrier returned to Alexandria the next day. She put to sea on 6 May to provide air cover for the convoys involved in <a href="Operation%20Tiger%20%281941%29">Operation "Tiger"</a>. On the morning of 8 May, a pair of Fulmars claimed to have shot down a pair of Z.1007s searching for the fleet; one Fulmar failed to return. Later that afternoon, the fighters shot down four German <a href="Heinkel%20He%20111">Heinkel He 111</a> bombers at the cost of one Fulmar forced to crash-land. Two Albacores and a Fulmar crashed due to non-combat causes during the day. The next day a pair of Fulmars from 806 Squadron badly damaged a Ju 88 reconnaissance bomber that crash-landed at its base in Sicily. As the fleet and the Tiger convoy approached Alexandria on 11 May, a pair of Fulmars attacked a formation of Ju 88s, damaging one bomber; one Fulmar and another Ju 88 were seen falling together towards the sea. Many of the Fulmars had been rendered unserviceable during the operation and "Formidable" was unable to provide air cover until they were repaired.

On 26 May the fleet sortied for a dawn raid on the base at <a href="Scarpanto">Scarpanto</a> the next day; the carrier could only muster a total of 12 Fulmars and 15 Albacores and Swordfish. Six Albacores and four Fulmars attacked the airbase, destroying one Ju 88 and damaging two others. Also damaged were an Italian <a href="Savoia-Marchetti%20SM.81">Savoia-Marchetti SM.81</a> transport and six <a href="Fiat%20CR.42">Fiat CR.42</a> fighters. Later that morning, as the fleet was returning to Egypt, the Fulmars shot down a He 111 and two Ju 88s for the loss of one Fulmar forced to land aboard the carrier and another forced to ditch. At 13:10 a formation of <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087%20Stuka">Junkers Ju 87 Stuka</a> dive bombers was spotted from I./<a href="Sturzkampfgeschwader%202">StG 2</a>; based in Cyrenica; they were searching for supply ships bound for <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a> and not involved in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">Battle of Crete</a>. They hit "Formidable" with two bombs and blew the bow off her escorting <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> . The bombs killed 12 men and wounded 10; one bomb passed completely through the outer part of the starboard forward flight deck and detonated before it hit the water, riddling the side of the hull with holes. A near miss also blew a large hole in the ship's starboard side underwater. The pair of Fulmars on <a href="Combat%20Air%20Patrol">Combat Air Patrol</a> (CAP) shot down one of the Stukas after it had dropped its bomb and were able to land aboard shortly afterwards, although takeoffs could not be made until 18:00.

"Formidable" arrived at Alexandria the following day and disembarked her air group. She received emergency repairs before departing on 24 July for permanent repairs at <a href="Norfolk%20Naval%20Shipyard">Norfolk Naval Shipyard</a> in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, 829 Squadron flying aboard with its Albacores to provide anti-submarine patrols during the voyage. She arrived on 25 August, and the repairs were completed in early December. After several days of sea trials, she sailed for Britain in company with "Illustrious" on 12 December. During the night of 15/16 December, "Illustrious" collided with "Formidable"s stern, but neither ship was seriously damaged. She was repaired at Belfast from 21 December 1941 to 3 February 1942 and embarked the Albacores of <a href="818%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">818</a> and <a href="820%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">820 Squadrons</a> and the <a href="Grumman%20F4F%20Wildcat%23Royal%20Navy">Grumman Martlet</a> fighters of <a href="888%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">888 Squadron</a>.

"Formidable" sailed on 17 February to join the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean, escorting a convoy to <a href="Freetown">Freetown</a>, <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a>, en route. One of her passengers on the voyage was <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> Sir <a href="James%20Somerville">James Somerville</a>, about to take up his appointment as <a href="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</a> of the Eastern Fleet. The ship arrived at <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a>, <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a>, on 24 March and Somerville hoisted his flag aboard the battleship that same day. Two days after "Formidable"s arrival, the Japanese First Air Fleet departed from Celebes (<a href="Sulawesi">Sulawesi</a>) in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> to attack British forces in the Indian Ocean. Somerville was notified that the Japanese were planning to attack Ceylon on 28 March and ordered his fleet to assemble southeast of the island on 30 March to intercept them. Force A, consisting of "Formidable", her sister and "Warspite", was ordered to <a href="Addu%20Atoll">Addu Atoll</a> to refuel on 3 April after the Japanese failed to attack as the British expected. A <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> <a href="Consolidated%20Catalina">Consolidated Catalina</a> flying boat spotted them within range of Ceylon just three and a half hours after Force A arrived at the atoll on 4 April. Too far away to intercept them before they could attack Ceylon, Force A departed about eleven hours after arrival on a course that Somerville thought would allow him to attack by night while avoiding detection during the day. One of "Indomitable"s Albacores spotted some of the Japanese carriers just before nightfall on 5 April, after the Japanese <a href="Easter%20Sunday%20Raid">attacked Colombo</a>, but further searches failed to locate them until 8 April when the Japanese were one day away from their intended target, <a href="Trincomalee">Trincomalee</a>, and still too far away to intercept. Force A refuelled at Addu Atoll on 9 April and was then ordered to <a href="Bombay">Bombay</a> to calm fears of a Japanese attack on India's west coast.

Somerville was still uneasy about the possibility of another attack on Ceylon and ordered Force A to <a href="Kilindini%20Harbour">Kilindini Harbour</a>, <a href="Mombasa">Mombasa</a>, <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, on 24 April. En route (5–7 May), Force A helped protect the invasion of Vichy <a href="Diego%20Suarez">Diego Suarez</a>, Madagascar, against a Japanese attack. "Formidable" arrived at Kilindini on 10 May and remained there until she departed on 29 May bound for Colombo. The ship alternated between Colombo and Kilindini for the rest of her time with the Eastern Fleet. <a href="Rear-Admiral">Rear-Admiral</a> <a href="Denis%20Boyd">Denis Boyd</a> hoisted his flag over the ship on 24 August and she departed six days later to return home for a refit. She arrived at Rosyth on 21 September and her refit lasted until 18 October. She sailed that day for Scapa Flow where she embarked 24 Martlets of 888 and <a href="893%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">893 Squadrons</a>, 12 Albacores of 820 Squadron and 6 <a href="Supermarine%20Seafire">Supermarine Seafire</a> fighters of <a href="885%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">885 Squadron</a> in preparation for the invasion of <a href="French%20North%20Africa">French North Africa</a>.

Assigned to Force H for Operation "Torch", "Formidable" sailed on 30 October and provided cover in the Western Mediterranean against any attempt to interfere with the landings by Axis forces in Italy or France. Her Martlets shot down a pair of Ju 88s on 6 November and her Albacores laid a <a href="smoke%20screen">smoke screen</a> in support of the landings at Algiers on 8 November. Two of her Albacores torpedoed and sank the on 17 November, after it had surrendered to a <a href="Supermarine%20Walrus">Supermarine Walrus</a> <a href="amphibious%20aircraft">amphibian</a> which then departed the scene. She remained off the Algerian coast providing air support for Allied forces for the rest of the month, and one of her Seafires shot down a Ju 88 on 28 November.

"Formidable" was the only carrier in the Mediterranean after Torch until she was joined by "Indomitable" in mid-June 1943 as part of the buildup for the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a> (Operation "Husky"). The two carriers were east of the island in a position to intercept any attempt by the Italian fleet to attack the landings. After Sicily was secured, "Formidable" became the first carrier to enter <a href="Grand%20Harbour">Grand Harbour</a>, Malta, since "Illustrious" in January 1941. The latter ship joined "Formidable" as a replacement for the torpedoed "Indomitable" in Force H for the landings at <a href="Salerno">Salerno</a> (Operation "Avalanche") on 9 September. As in Husky, their role was to protect the invasion fleet from interference by the Italian Navy. The fighters aboard the smaller carriers protecting the forces ashore suffered heavy attrition during the early days of the operation and "Formidable" transferred 2 Seafires and 15 Martlets to as replacements for their losses.

In October, the carrier was transferred to the Home Fleet and departed Gibraltar for <a href="Greenock">Greenock</a> on 13 October together with the battleship . Six days later she was in Scapa Flow to begin patrols to Iceland in company with the battleships and and the American carrier that lasted for the next three weeks. On 13 November she flew off her air group and sailed for Belfast to begin a lengthy refit, arriving on 19 November. The refit was completed in early June and the ship spent the rest of the month working up. The 18 Corsairs of <a href="1841%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">1841 Squadron</a> and the 24 <a href="Fairey%20Barracuda">Fairey Barracuda</a> torpedo bombers of <a href="827%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">827</a> and <a href="830%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">830 Squadrons</a> flew aboard on 29 June and "Formidable" sailed for Scapa Flow to train with the carriers and before launching an attack on the "Tirpitz" in <a href="K%C3%A5fjorden%20%28Alta%29">Kaafjord</a> on 17 July (<a href="Operation%20Mascot">Operation "Mascot"</a>). Her Corsairs escorted the strike aircraft from the other carriers to the target; one was shot down by German <a href="flak">flak</a>. A smoke screen prevented most of the Barracudas from seeing their target and they failed to hit the "Tirpitz". Upon the ship's return to Scapa Flow, 827 and 830 Squadrons were replaced by 826 and 828 Squadrons, also flying Barracudas.

"Formidable"s air group was reinforced by a dozen Corsairs of <a href="1842%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">1842 Squadron</a> on 7 August in preparation for further attacks on "Tirpitz" (<a href="Operation%20Goodwood%20%28naval%29">Operation "Goodwood"</a>). The two Corsair squadrons were assigned to <a href="No.%206%20Naval%20Fighter%20Wing">No. 6 Naval Fighter Wing</a> aboard the carrier on 14 August. The first attack was on the morning of 22 August when "Formidable" launched 24 Corsairs and 12 Barracudas against the German battleship and nearby targets, all of which returned. A smoke screen again protected the "Tirpitz" and no damage was inflicted. Another attack scheduled for the afternoon had to be cancelled because of low clouds. A further attack could not be mounted until 24 August because of bad weather. The carrier contributed 23 Corsairs and 16 Barracudas, and 3 of the fighters were shot down over the target. The "Tirpitz" was lightly damaged by two bomb hits during this attack. A final attack was made five days later, again without effect.

The carrier arrived at Scapa Flow on 2 September where both Barracuda squadrons disembarked. She later sailed to Gibraltar, arriving on 21 September to begin a refit that, among other things, augmented her anti-aircraft outfit in preparation for operations in the Pacific. The Corsairs of No. 6 Naval Fighter Wing flew aboard on 1 January 1945, as did 18 <a href="Grumman%20TBF%20Avenger">Grumman TBF Avenger</a>s of <a href="848%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">848 Squadron</a>. After several weeks of working up, "Formidable" departed Gibraltar on 14 January to join the <a href="British%20Pacific%20Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a> (BPF). She arrived in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, the BPF's main base, on 10 March after several stops en route to refuel and embark stores and ammunition. On 20 March, Admiral Sir <a href="Bruce%20Fraser%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fraser%20of%20North%20Cape">Bruce Fraser</a>, commander of the BPF, inspected the ship and her crew.

By this time "Formidable"s air group had a strength of 36 Corsairs and 18 Avengers. She arrived in <a href="San%20Pedro%20Bay%20%28Philippines%29">San Pedro Bay</a> in the Philippines on 4 April to await the return of the BPF from their efforts to neutralise airfields on the <a href="Sakishima%20Islands">Sakishima Islands</a>, between Okinawa and <a href="Formosa">Formosa</a>, as part of the preparations for the landings on Okinawa. "Formidable" was called forward six days later to join the <a href="1st%20Aircraft%20Carrier%20Squadron%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron</a> (1st ACS) of the BPF on operations as a replacement for "Illustrious", which was in poor mechanical shape. She arrived on 14 April and contributed aircraft when the attacks recommenced two days later. The commander of 1842 Squadron was killed on the first day of operations while <a href="strafing">strafing</a> buildings at Nobara airfield. After refuelling and two more days' attacks, the BPF sailed on 20 April for San Pedro Bay to replenish its ships for further operations.

The fleet returned to waters off Okinawa on 4 May and renewed its attacks on the airfields on the Sakishima Islands. <a href="Vice-Admiral">Vice-Admiral</a> <a href="Bernard%20Rawlings%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Bernard Rawlings</a>, second in command of the BPF, and his staff had determined that bombardment of Japanese gun positions by the heavy guns of battleships and cruisers might be a more effective method of destroying them than aerial attack. They detached "King George V" and "Howe", as well as five cruisers, that morning to bombard Nobara and Hiara airfields while fighters flew a protective CAP over them and spotted the fall of their shells. The loss of the most effective anti-aircraft ships was more important than anticipated and the Japanese were able to take advantage of the opportunity. The carrier had just launched two Corsairs for bombardment-spotting duties and the deck park of eleven Avengers was being moved forward to allow aircraft to land when an undetected <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">Mitsubishi A6M Zero</a> fighter attacked at 11:31. The Zero first strafed the flight deck before any of "Formidable"s guns could open fire and then turned sharply to dive into the forward flight deck despite the ship's hard turn to starboard. The fighter released a bomb shortly before it would have impacted the deck and was destroyed by the bomb's blast, although the remnants of the Zero struck "Formidable".

The detonation of the bomb blew a hole in the flight deck. It killed 2 officers and 6 ratings, wounding 55 other crewmen. A fragment from the flight deck armour penetrated the hangar deck armour and passed through the centre boiler uptakes, the centre boiler room itself, and an oil tank before it came to rest in the <a href="double%20bottom">inner bottom</a>. The fragment severed the steam pipes in the centre <a href="boiler%20room%20%28ship%29">boiler room</a> and forced its evacuation, cutting the ship's speed to . The blast on the flight deck blew the Avenger closest to it over the side and set another one on fire. Shrapnel from the blast peppered the island, causing the bulk of the casualties, and severed many electrical cables, including those for most of the ship's radars. The fires on the flight deck and in the hangar were extinguished by 11:55, and seven Avengers and a Corsair which were damaged beyond repair were dumped over the side. The bomb struck at the intersection of three armour plates and dented the plates over an area . The dent was filled by wood and concrete and covered by thin steel plates tack-<a href="Welding">welded</a> to the deck so that she was able to operate aircraft by 17:00 and steam at a speed of . Thirteen of her Corsairs had been airborne at the time of the attack and they operated from the other carriers for a time. The damage to the boiler room and its steam pipes was repaired so that the centre boilers could be reconnected to the engines at 02:00 the next day.
The bombardment significantly reduced Japanese aerial activity on 5 May, although several of "Formidable"s Corsairs, temporarily operating from her sister "Victorious", shot down a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft at an altitude of . That evening the fleet withdrew to refuel and was back on station on 8 May although heavy rains forced the cancellation of the planned air strikes. On 9 May, another kamikaze pilot, Yoshinari Kurose, penetrated the CAP at low altitude and crashed his plane into "Formidable"s flight deck and deck park at 17:05. The impact did little damage to the ship, but caused an explosion and large fire that destroyed 18 of her aircraft. One crewman, Petty Officer George Hinkins, was killed and four were wounded. The carrier was able to resume operations fifty minutes later, but with only four Avengers and eleven Corsairs still serviceable. Rawlings decided to immediately withdraw to give "Victorious" and "Formidable" more time to make repairs and to replenish their depleted air groups. He also revised the deployment of the BPF to counter the new low-level tactics of the Japanese by stationing the battleships and cruisers closer to the carriers, keeping the carriers closer together, and positioning <a href="radar%20picket">radar picket</a> cruisers in the most likely directions of attack.

The BPF returned to action on 12 May and no Japanese aircraft were seen or detected that day or the next. One of "Formidable"s Avengers made a successful landing aboard "Indomitable" with only one landing gear leg extended and no <a href="flap%20%28aircraft%29">flap</a>s on 13 May. The BPF continued its routine of two days of operations alternating with one or two days to replenish its ships for the next several days with minimal interference by the Japanese. On the morning of 18 May, armourers were loading ammunition into aircraft when a Corsair's guns were accidentally fired into an Avenger, which caught fire. The overhead <a href="fire%20sprinkler">fire sprinkler</a>s were immediately turned on, but the fire could not be extinguished for nearly an hour, not least because the electric motors driving the steel fire curtains had been damaged in the first kamikaze attack and could only be repaired by a dockyard. Twenty-one Corsairs and seven Avengers were either damaged or destroyed in the incident. Rawlings decided to detach "Formidable" early to give her extra time for repairs in Sydney and she was ordered to depart on 22 May.

The ship arrived on 31 May and was taken into the Captain Cook Dock at the <a href="Garden%20Island%20Dockyard">Garden Island Dockyard</a> for repairs, with the dock's labour force being augmented with workers from the <a href="Cockatoo%20Island%20Dockyard">Cockatoo Island Dockyard</a>. Two of the three armour plates damaged on 4 May were repaired, but the third had to be replaced by two 1.5-inch high-quality steel plates as there were not any armour plates of the required thickness available in Australia. Repairs were also made to the ship's machinery, boilers and electrical systems. The island was enlarged with an admiral's staff cabin and a radar workshop. Rear-Admiral Sir <a href="Philip%20Vian">Philip Vian</a>, commander of the 1st ACS, transferred his flag to "Formidable" when her repairs were complete.

Together with "Victorious" and "King George V", "Formidable" departed Sydney on 28 June, bound for the BPF's advance base at <a href="Manus%20Island">Manus Island</a>, in the <a href="Admiralty%20Islands">Admiralty Islands</a>. Her air group now consisted of 36 Corsairs, 12 Avengers and 6 Grumman F6F Hellcats of <a href="1844%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">1844 Squadron</a>. Two of the latter aircraft were <a href="photoreconnaissance">photoreconnaissance</a> versions. No. 6 Naval Fighter Wing was absorbed into the <a href="2nd%20Carrier%20Air%20Group">2nd Carrier Air Group</a> that controlled all of the aircraft on the carrier. The ships arrived on 4 July, refuelled, and departed two days later to join the American <a href="United%20States%20Third%20Fleet">Third Fleet</a>, already operating off the Japanese Home Islands. The BPF rendezvoused with the Americans on 16 July and commenced operations the next morning. "Formidable" flew off 28 Corsairs bound north of Tokyo on 17 July, but some of them were unable to locate their targets because of bad weather. Twenty-four Corsairs attacked targets near Tokyo the next day, before more bad weather halted flying operations until 24–25 July, when the BPF's aircraft attacked targets near <a href="Osaka">Osaka</a> and the <a href="Seto%20Inland%20Sea">Inland Sea</a>, crippling the <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a> . After replenishing, airstrikes resumed on 28 and 30 July, sinking the escort near <a href="Maizuru">Maizuru</a>. A combination of bad weather, refuelling requirements and the <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombing of Hiroshima</a> delayed the resumption of air operations until 9 August.

During the morning, "Formidable" flew off a <a href="Offensive%20counter%20air">fighter sweep</a> of a dozen Corsairs followed an hour later by Avengers that attacked <a href="Matsushima%20Air%20Field">Matsushima Air Field</a>. A second fighter sweep, led by Lieutenant <a href="Robert%20Hampton%20Gray">Robert Hampton Gray</a>, <a href="RCNVR">RCNVR</a>, senior pilot of 1841 Squadron, was diverted to attack Japanese warships located in <a href="Onagawa%2C%20Miyagi">Onagawa Wan</a>, <a href="Miyagi%20Prefecture">Miyagi Prefecture</a>, with his eight Corsairs. Gray spotted two <a href="escort%20ship">escort ship</a>s and led his aircraft into the attack. Intense flak set his engine on fire, but Gray continued his attack, <a href="skip%20bombing">skip bombing</a> a bomb into the <a href="Etorofu%20class%20escort%20ship">"Etorofu"-class</a> escort <a href="Japanese%20escort%20ship%20Amakusa">"Amakusa"</a>. The ship sank within five minutes with the loss of 157 lives. Gray's aircraft rolled inverted shortly after releasing the bomb and crashed into the sea; he did not survive. Gray was later posthumously awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> (VC).

The attacks were repeated the next day, sinking two warships and numerous small merchantmen and destroying numerous railroad locomotives and parked aircraft. The BPF had been scheduled to withdraw after 10 August to prepare for <a href="Operation%20Olympic">Operation "Olympic"</a>, the invasion of <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a> scheduled for November, and the bulk of the force, including "Formidable", departed for Manus on 12 August. The <a href="Japanese%20surrender">Japanese surrender</a> a few days later ended the war.

"Formidable" arrived at Sydney on 24 August, and had her hangar refitted to accommodate Allied ex-prisoners of war and soldiers for repatriation. Having left her air group behind to maximise the numbers of passengers she could carry, the ship arrived at <a href="Manila">Manila</a> on 30 September, where she loaded over 1,000 Australian former prisoners of war on 4 October and unloaded them at <a href="Circular%20Quay">Circular Quay</a> in Sydney on 21 October. She departed three days later, bound for <a href="Karavia%20Bay">Karavia Bay</a>, <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>, where she loaded 1,254 men of the <a href="British%20Indian%20Army">Indian Army</a> and continued on to <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> where she loaded Indian ex-PoWs before delivering them to Bombay. There "Formidable" loaded an Indian Army <a href="infantry">infantry</a> <a href="battalion">battalion</a> for transport to <a href="Jakarta">Batavia</a> in the Dutch East Indies to maintain law and order until Dutch colonial troops could take over. The ship then loaded elements of the <a href="7th%20Australian%20Division">7th Australian Division</a> and their equipment at <a href="Tarakan%20Island">Tarakan Island</a>, <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>, and picked up more Australians at <a href="Morotai">Morotai</a>; she arrived at Sydney on 6 December.

Vice-Admiral Vian addressed the ship's crew on 27 December before she departed the following day with 800 naval personnel embarked for passage home. She arrived at <a href="HMNB%20Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> on 5 February 1946. The dockyard there fitted her with more permanent accommodations in the hangar for more trooping duties and she loaded 480 personnel before departing for Sydney on 2 March. "Formidable" arrived there a month later and loaded 1,336 naval personnel as well as some <a href="Women%27s%20Royal%20Naval%20Service">Wrens</a> and <a href="Voluntary%20Aid%20Detachment">VAD</a> nurses. She sailed on 12 April, stopping in Colombo to refuel and drop off 576 naval personnel, before arriving in <a href="HMNB%20Devonport">Devonport</a> on 9 May. She made her next voyage to Bombay and Colombo between 15 June and 25 July. The ship loaded 114 officers, 958 ratings and 11 VAD nurses in Singapore in August and another 319 ratings in Trincomalee before stopping in Malta to load 41 men of the <a href="Merchant%20Navy%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Merchant Navy</a>. "Formidable" made her last trooping voyage between Portsmouth and Singapore, delivering 1,000 <a href="Royal%20Marine%20Commando">Royal Marine Commando</a>s to the latter, between 3 December and 3 February 1947.

In early March 1947, "Formidable" steamed north to Rosyth for a brief refit before being reduced to reserve. She was paid off on 12 August and a later survey revealed that her wartime damage and poor material shape meant the ship was beyond economical repair at a time when money was very tight. She was towed to <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a> in mid-1949 and then to Portsmouth Royal Dockyard in November 1952. "Formidable" was sold for scrap in January 1953 and towed to <a href="Inverkeithing">Inverkeithing</a> where she was broken up.

HMS Indefatigable (R10)

HMS "Indefatigable" was an built for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> (RN) during World War II. She was completed in 1944, and her aircraft made several attacks that year against the , inflicting only light damage; they also raided targets in Norway. The ship was transferred to the <a href="British%20Pacific%20Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a> (BPF) at the end of the year and attacked Japanese-controlled <a href="oil%20refinery">oil refineries</a> in Sumatra in January 1945 before joining the American forces in March as they prepared to invade the island of <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a> in <a href="Operation%20Iceberg">Operation Iceberg</a>. "Indefatigable" and the BPF joined the Americans in attacking the <a href="Japanese%20Home%20Islands">Japanese Home Islands</a> in July and August. Following the end of hostilities she visited ports in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

After returning to the UK in early 1946, "Indefatigable" was modified for transport duties, and ferried troops and civilians for the rest of the year before she was reduced to <a href="Reserve%20fleet">reserve</a>. She was recommissioned in 1950 as a training ship for service with the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a> Training Squadron, participating in exercises and making several port visits overseas. The <a href="Board%20of%20Admiralty">Board of Admiralty</a> decided that she was redundant in early 1954 and decommissioned her later that year. "Indefatigable" was sold for <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a> the following year.

The "Implacable" class were ordered under the 1938 Naval Programme by the <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Chamberlain</a> government as part of the general rearmament begun in response to the rise of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and <a href="Fascist%20Italy%20%281922%E2%80%9343%29">Fascist Italy</a>. The design originated as an improved version of the s and was intended to be faster and carry an additional dozen aircraft over the speed and 36 aircraft of the earlier ships. To remain within the limit allowed by the <a href="Second%20London%20Naval%20Treaty">Second London Naval Treaty</a>, these improvements could only be made by reducing armour protection. "Indefatigable" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a> and at the <a href="waterline">waterline</a>. Her <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> was at the waterline, and she had a <a href="draught%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. The "Implacable"-class ships were significantly overweight and <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at deep load. The ships had <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a>s of at light load and at deep load as completed. "Indefatigable"s complement was approximately 2,300 officers and enlisted men in 1945.

The ships had four <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each driving one shaft, using steam supplied by eight <a href="Admiralty%203-drum%20boiler">Admiralty 3-drum boiler</a>s. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , enough to give the "Indefatigable"-class ships a maximum speed of . On <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, "Indefatigable" reached speeds of with . She carried a maximum of of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> which gave her a range of at .

The armoured flight deck had a maximum width of . A single hydraulic <a href="aircraft%20catapult">aircraft catapult</a> was fitted on the forward part of the flight deck. The "Implacable"-class carriers were equipped with two <a href="Elevator%23Aircraft%20elevators">lifts</a> on the centreline, the forward of which measured and served only the upper hangar, and the aft lift (), which served both hangars. The upper hangar was long and the lower hangar was long; both had a maximum width of . Each hangar had a height of only 14 feet which precluded storage of <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a> <a href="Vought%20F4U%20Corsair">Vought F4U Corsair</a> fighters as well as many post-war aircraft and <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a>s. Designed to stow 48 aircraft in their hangars, the use of a permanent deck park allowed the "Implacable" class to accommodate up to 81 aircraft. The additional crewmen, maintenance personnel and facilities needed to support these aircraft were housed in the lower hangar. The ships were provided with of <a href="avgas">aviation gasoline</a>.

The ship's main armament consisted of sixteen <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing (QF)</a> <a href="QF%204.5-inch%20Mk%20I%20%E2%80%93%20V%20naval%20gun"></a> <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a>s in eight twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, four in <a href="sponson">sponson</a>s on each side of the hull. Unlike the "Illustrious"-class ships, the roofs of the gun turrets were flat and flush with the flight deck. The gun had a maximum range of . "Indefatigable"s light anti-aircraft defences included five octuple mounts for <a href="QF%202-pounder%20naval%20gun">QF 2-pounder ("pom-pom")</a> <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft (AA) guns</a>, two on the flight deck forward of the island, one on the aft part of the island, and two in sponsons on the port side of the hull. A single quadruple 2-pounder mount was also fitted on the port side of the hull. The 2-pounder gun had a maximum range of . The ship was also fitted with 55 <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">Oerlikon 20 mm</a> <a href="autocannon">autocannon</a> in 17 single and 19 twin-gun mounts. These guns had a maximum range of , but some were replaced by <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun">40 mm Bofors</a> AA guns when the ships were transferred to the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific Theatre</a> as the shell was unlikely to destroy a <a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a> before it hit the ship. The <a href="Bofors">Bofors</a> gun had a maximum range of . By August 1945, "Indefatigable" had 10 single Bofors guns, plus 14 twin and 12 single Oerlikon mounts. By April 1946 these had been reduced to 11 Bofors guns, 6 twin and 7 single Oerlikon guns.

Details of the "Implacable"-class ships' radar suite are not readily available. They were fitted with the <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20277">Type 277</a> surface-search/<a href="Height%20finder">height-finding radar</a> on top of the <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> and a <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20293">Type 293</a> target indicator radar on the <a href="foremast">foremast</a>. , one of the "Illustrious"-class ships upon which "Indefatigable"s design was based, also carried Type 279 and <a href="Type%20281%20radar">Type 281</a>B <a href="early-warning%20radar">early-warning radar</a>s. <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20282">Type 282</a> and Type 285 gunnery radars were mounted on the <a href="Ship%20gun%20fire-control%20system">fire-control directors</a>.

The "Implacable"-class ships had a flight deck protected by of armour. The sides of the hangars were either or . The ends of the hangars were protected by 2-inch bulkheads and the armour of the hangar deck ranged from in thickness. The waterline <a href="Belt%20armor">armour belt</a> was thick, but only covered the central portion of the ship. The belt was closed by 1.5 to 2-inch transverse bulkheads fore and aft. The <a href="torpedo%20belt">underwater defence system</a> was a layered system of liquid- and air-filled compartments as used in the "Illustrious" class. The <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s for the 4.5-inch guns lay outside the armoured citadel and were protected by 2 to 3-inch roofs, 4.5-inch sides and 1.5 to 2-inch ends.

"Indefatigable" was <a href="Keel">laid down</a> by <a href="John%20Brown%20%26amp%3B%20Company">John Brown & Co.</a> at their shipyard in <a href="Clydebank">Clydebank</a> on 3 November 1939 as Yard Number 565. She was <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 8 December 1942 by <a href="Princess%20Victoria%20of%20Hesse%20and%20by%20Rhine">Victoria of Hesse</a>, Dowager <a href="Marquess%20of%20Milford%20Haven">Marchioness of Milford Haven</a>. <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> Quentin Graham was appointed to command the ship in August 1943. While <a href="fitting%20out">fitting out</a>, in order to confound the enemy, a ruse known as Operation Bijou, initiated by <a href="London%20Controlling%20Section">London Controlling Section</a>, was launched whereby it was made known that "Indefatigable" had already entered service. <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a> decrypts revealed that the Japanese believed the deception, with operatives including <a href="Malcolm%20Muggeridge">Malcolm Muggeridge</a> and <a href="Peter%20Fleming%20%28writer%29">Peter Fleming</a> supplying disinformation for more than a year, sufficient to make the enemy believe the vessel had gone to the Far East and returned to the Clyde for a refit, by which time she was actually finished.

The ship was commissioned on 8 December 1943 and began sea trials, which revealed many problems that required rectification and delayed her formal completion until 3 May 1944. While "Indefatigable" was still conducting builder's trials, a <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">de Havilland Mosquito</a> landed aboard on 25 March, piloted by Lieutenant <a href="Eric%20Brown%20%28pilot%29">Eric Brown</a>. This was the first landing by a twin-engined aeroplane on a carrier. The ship was assigned to the Home Fleet and was <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23W">working up</a> over the next several months while the <a href="Fairey%20Firefly">Fairey Fireflies</a> of <a href="1770%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">1770 Squadron</a> flew aboard on 18 May. The squadron was followed by the <a href="Fairey%20Barracuda">Fairey Barracuda</a> torpedo bombers of <a href="826%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">826 Squadron</a> in June.

"Indefatigable"s first mission was a brief sortie on 1 July 1944 to provide air cover for the <a href="ocean%20liner">ocean liner</a> that was ferrying American troops to Britain. Upon her return, "Indefatigable" embarked the <a href="Supermarine%20Seafire">Supermarine Seafire</a> fighters of <a href="887%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">887 Squadron</a> and the Barracudas of <a href="820%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">820 Squadron</a>, completing <a href="No.%209%20Naval%20Torpedo-Bomber%20Reconnaissance%20Wing">No. 9 Naval Torpedo-Bomber Reconnaissance Wing</a>, over the next week. Her first combat mission was an attack on the battleship "Tirpitz" in <a href="K%C3%A5fjorden%20%28Alta%29">Kaafjord</a> on 17 July with two other Home Fleet carriers (<a href="Operation%20Mascot">Operation Mascot</a>). She contributed 23 Barracudas and 12 Fireflies to the mission; the former attacked the battleship while the Fireflies <a href="Strafing">strafed</a> the <a href="flak">flak</a> positions defending her. A <a href="smoke%20screen">smoke screen</a> prevented most of the Barracudas from seeing their target and they failed to hit "Tirpitz". One Barracuda was forced to <a href="Water%20landing">ditch</a> near the carrier and its crew was rescued by the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> .

<a href="894%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">894 Squadron</a>, equipped with Seafires, landed aboard after the attack on 24 July to complete <a href="No.%2024%20Naval%20Fighter%20Wing">No. 24 Naval Fighter Wing</a>. "Indefatigable" and several <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a>s attacked targets in Norway on 10 August, destroying 6 <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20110">Messerschmitt Bf 110</a> fighters and sinking a <a href="minesweeper">minesweeper</a>. For <a href="Operation%20Goodwood%20%28naval%29">Operation Goodwood</a>, a series of attacks on "Tirpitz", the <a href="Grumman%20F6F%20Hellcat">Grumman F6F Hellcat</a> fighters of <a href="1840%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">1840 Squadron</a> replaced the Barracudas of 826 Squadron. The first mission took place on the morning of 22 August when "Indefatigable" launched 12 Barracudas, 11 Fireflies, 8 Hellcats, and 8 Seafires against the German battleship and nearby targets. A smoke screen again protected "Tirpitz" and no damage was inflicted; two Seafires failed to return. Another attack was made later in the day without effect. A further attack could not be mounted until 24 August because of bad weather; for this mission the carrier contributed 12 Barracudas, 11 Fireflies and 4 Seafires, all of which returned. "Tirpitz" was lightly damaged by two hits during this attack, one a bomb and the other a armour-piercing bomb. The latter penetrated the armoured deck but failed to explode and would probably have inflicted serious damage, possibly even sinking the ship, had it done so. A final attack was made five days later, again without effect. 887 Squadron sank seven <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a>s at their <a href="wikt%3Amoor">moorings</a> at <a href="Banak%2C%20Norway">Banak</a> during the operation.

On 19 September 1944, "Indefatigable" sortied from Scapa Flow to attack targets near <a href="Troms%C3%B8">Tromsø</a>, but the operation was cancelled because of bad weather. The ship underwent a brief refit at her builder's yard between 28 September and 8 November. She became the flagship of the <a href="1st%20Aircraft%20Carrier%20Squadron%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron</a> (1st ACS) when <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> Sir <a href="Philip%20Vian">Philip Vian</a> hoisted his flag on 15 November. The following day, King <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a> inspected the ship; the ground crews later embarked for 820, 887, 894 and 1770 Squadrons. Their aircraft, 40 Seafires, 12 Fireflies, and 21 <a href="Grumman%20TBF%20Avenger">Grumman TBF Avenger</a> torpedo bombers, followed on 19 November, and she sailed for the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a> to join the British Pacific Fleet. "Indefatigable" arrived at <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a>, <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a>, on 10 December and Vian transferred his flag to .

Together with "Victorious" and "Indomitable", "Indefatigable" attacked an <a href="oil%20refinery">oil refinery</a> at <a href="Pangkalan%20Brandan">Pangkalan Brandan</a>, Sumatra on 4 January 1945 (<a href="Operation%20Lentil%20%28Sumatra%29">Operation Lentil</a>). She embarked six photoreconnaissance Hellcats of <a href="888%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">888 Squadron</a> for the attack; her only contribution to the attack itself was the Fireflies of 1770 Squadron, which used <a href="RP-3">RP-3</a> rocket projectiles on their targets. The squadron claimed to have shot down a <a href="Nakajima%20Ki-43">Nakajima Ki-43</a> "Oscar", for the loss of a Firefly that ran out of fuel and had to ditch next to the ship. After "Indefatigable"s return, Admiral Lord <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten">Louis Mountbatten</a>, <a href="Supreme%20Allied%20Commander">Supreme Allied Commander</a> <a href="South%20East%20Asia%20Command">South East Asia Command</a>, addressed the crew on 11 January. En route to <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> to prepare for operations in the Pacific, the BPF's carriers attacked oil refineries near <a href="Palembang">Palembang</a>, Sumatra, on 24 and 29 January (<a href="Operation%20Meridian">Operation Meridian</a>). The ship's Seafires lacked the range to reach the targets so they were retained on <a href="combat%20air%20patrol">combat air patrol</a>s (CAP) over the fleet for both attacks. She contributed 10 of her Avengers and all of her Fireflies to the first attack, which destroyed most of the oil storage tanks and cut the refinery's output by half for three months. Five days later, the BPF attacked a different refinery and 820 Squadron again contributed 10 Avengers to the attack while 1770 Squadron added 9 Fireflies. The latter squadron also flew 2 Fireflies on an armed reconnaissance mission over an airfield that lay between the carriers and their target. The attack was very successful at heavy cost, but the losses of "Indefatigable"s squadrons are not available. Her Seafires shot down a <a href="Mitsubishi%20Ki-46">Mitsubishi Ki-46</a> "Dinah" reconnaissance aircraft searching for the fleet and 5 <a href="Kawasaki%20Ki-48">Kawasaki Ki-48</a> "Lily" bombers that attacked at low level.

The BPF arrived in Sydney on 10 February; the crews received leave and the ships got some maintenance before they sailed for the BPF's advance base at <a href="Manus%20Island">Manus Island</a>, in the <a href="Admiralty%20Islands">Admiralty Islands</a>, on 27 February. They arrived on 7 March and exercised together before sailing for <a href="Ulithi">Ulithi</a> on 18 March. The BPF joined the American <a href="United%20States%20Fifth%20Fleet">Fifth Fleet</a> there two days later to participate in the preliminary operations for the invasion of Okinawa. The British role during the operation was to neutralise airfields on the <a href="Sakishima%20Islands">Sakishima Islands</a>, between Okinawa and <a href="Formosa">Formosa</a>, beginning on 26 March. Her Seafires were again retained to defend the fleet and only her Avengers and Fireflies attacked the airfields. Her Seafire squadrons lacked 13 of their authorised strength of 50 pilots and could not sustain the pace of the first day of operations, when they flew 72 sorties. After a break at the end of the month to refuel, "Indefatigable" became the first British carrier to be hit by a kamikaze the day after flying operations resumed, when one of the Japanese planes evaded the CAP and struck the base of the carrier's island on 1 April. The bomb it carried did not detonate and this limited casualties to 21 men killed and 27 wounded. Damage to the ship was minimal and the flight deck was back in operation thirty minutes later. On 12 and 13 April, the BPF switched targets to airfields in northern Formosa. On the first day, a pair of Fireflies encountered five <a href="Mitsubishi%20Ki-51">Mitsubishi Ki-51</a> "Sonia" dive bombers and shot down four of them. A flight of four Seafires on CAP spotted four Japanese fighters, three <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">Mitsubishi A6M Zero</a>es and a <a href="Kawasaki%20Ki-61">Kawasaki Ki-61</a> "Tony" later that morning, and shot down one Zero. The BPF returned to the Sakishima Islands on 17 April before retiring to <a href="Leyte%20Gulf">Leyte Gulf</a> to rest and resupply. Wastage of Seafires to all causes was very heavy during the operation with 25 out of 40 lost or damaged beyond repair and only 5 replacements received. Their short range and lack of endurance was considered by Vian to be a severe handicap for the BPF, which returned to action on 4 May and again attacked targets in the Sakishima Islands. Its aircraft continued to do so until they flew their last missions of Operation Iceberg on 25 May. Statistics compiled by the BPF staff showed that 61 Seafires were lost or damaged beyond repair during both phases of the operation due to deck-landing accidents.
The BPF arrived back at Sydney on 5 June and sailed for Manus three weeks later. "Indefatigable" was forced to remain behind as she required repairs to her machinery. Her air group flew aboard on 7 July (<a href="1772%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">1772 Squadron</a> and its Fireflies replacing 1770 Squadron) when she sailed for Manus. She reached the coast of Japan on 20 July and her aircraft began attacking targets near <a href="Osaka">Osaka</a> and in the <a href="Seto%20Inland%20Sea">Inland Sea</a> four days later. Her Seafire squadrons had adapted larger external fuel tanks for their aircraft and they were no longer limited to CAP duty. The BPF's aircraft crippled the escort carrier and sank numerous smaller ships on 24 July. After replenishing, airstrikes resumed on 28 and 30 July, the British sinking the escort near <a href="Maizuru">Maizuru</a>. A combination of bad weather, refuelling requirements and the <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombing of Hiroshima</a> delayed the resumption of air operations until 9 August. During the day, "Indefatigable"s aircraft attacked targets in northern <a href="Honshu">Honshu</a> and southern <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a>. The attacks were repeated the next day, sinking two warships and numerous small merchantmen and destroying numerous railroad locomotives and parked aircraft.

The BPF had been scheduled to withdraw after 10 August to prepare for <a href="Operation%20Olympic">Operation Olympic</a>, the invasion of <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a> scheduled for November, and the bulk of the force departed for Manus on 12 August. "Indefatigable", however, had been chosen to remain as part of the Allied occupation force. The next day her aircraft attacked targets in the vicinity of Tokyo. Flight operations resumed on the morning of the 15th after an operational pause to refuel. The first airstrike was tasked to attack Kisarazu Air Field with four Fireflies and six Avengers, escorted by eight Seafires, but was forced to divert to its secondary target because of bad weather. En route they were attacked by a dozen Zeros in the last British air combat of the war. The Japanese fighters shot down one Seafire on their first pass and crippled an Avenger. The Seafires claimed four Zeros shot down, four others probably shot down, and another four damaged. An Avenger also claimed one Zero as damaged. A <a href="Yokosuka%20D4Y">Yokosuka D4Y</a> "Judy" dive bomber attacked the carrier after the ceasefire went into effect, but its two bombs missed. After the ceasefire, "Indefatigable"s aircraft continued to fly CAP and flew reconnaissance missions looking for Allied prisoners of war, dropping supplies to them as they were located.

On 17 August 1945, Admiral Sir <a href="Bruce%20Fraser%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fraser%20of%20North%20Cape">Bruce Fraser</a>, commander of the BPF, came aboard and addressed the crew. "Indefatigable" continued flying operations until she entered <a href="Sagami%20Bay">Sagami Bay</a> on 5 September. She departed three days later for Manus en route to Sydney. The ship arrived at Sydney on 18 September and began a leisurely refit that lasted until 15 November. On 1 November, Captain Ian MacIntyre relieved Graham as captain of the ship. She became Vian's flagship on 22 November and sailed to New Zealand to show the flag. She arrived in <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a> on 27 November and was opened for public tours, during which time the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20New%20Zealand">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Peter%20Fraser">Peter Fraser</a>, also visited. "Indefatigable" then sailed to <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, arriving on 12 December, and was again opened for tours. She returned to Sydney for the holidays and visited <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> on 22 January 1946 before departing for home nine days later. Vian transferred his flag to her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> "Implacable" that day and the ship stopped off at <a href="Fremantle">Fremantle</a> and <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> en route. While "Indefatigable" was visiting the latter city, she was opened to the public, and the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20South%20Africa">Governor-General of South Africa</a> toured the ship.
The carrier arrived at <a href="HMNB%20Portsmouth">Portsmouth Dockyard</a> on 16 March 1946. Her hangars were modified to accommodate over 1,900 passengers, including women, and she departed for Australia on 25 April carrying 782 RN personnel and 130 Australian <a href="war%20bride">war bride</a>s. Most of the RN personnel disembarked at Colombo and most of the war brides did the same at Fremantle. "Indefatigable" continued on to Sydney, where she embarked a complete naval hospital, with patients, and over 1,000 RN officers and ratings. She departed on 9 June and arrived at Plymouth on 7 July. Her next voyage involved transporting a much smaller number of men to <a href="Malta">Malta</a> and Colombo; only 47 officers and 67 ratings, most of whom left the ship at Malta. When she arrived at Colombo on 15 August, she loaded a full complement of passengers from all three services to return to the UK. The ship arrived at Portsmouth on 9 September and her next voyage involved over 1,200 RN personnel and civilians ferried to Malta, Colombo, and <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> where almost 1,300 personnel embarked. She returned to Portsmouth on 29 November and began a brief refit in preparation for her final trooping voyage. "Indefatigable" sailed empty for <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>, where she loaded RN personnel before returning to Portsmouth on 21 November. The next month, she was placed in reserve and Captain MacIntyre retired on 7 January 1947.

The Admiralty decided to recommission "Indefatigable" for use as a training ship in mid-1949. Captain <a href="Henry%20St%20John%20Fancourt">Henry Fancourt</a> assumed command on 22 August to prepare for sea. The ship arrived at Devonport to begin the necessary modifications on 30 August and the following day Fancourt turned over command to the dockyard. Captain John Grindle was appointed to command on 24 March 1950 and the ship was recommissioned on 28 May. Two days later Captain <a href="Robert%20Sherbrooke">Robert Sherbrooke</a>, <a href="Victoria%20Cross">VC</a>, relieved Grindle and "Indefatigable" began her sea trials on 28 June. She was inspected by Rear Admiral <a href="St%20John%20Micklethwaithe">St John Micklethwaithe</a>, Flag Officer Training Squadron, on 3 July and received her first trainees shortly afterwards. She participated in exercises with the Home Fleet and joined it in Gibraltar in September and October. On 12 March 1951 she sortied from <a href="Portland%20Harbour">Portland</a>, flying Micklethwaite's flag, to exercise with the Home Fleet before beginning a brief refit at Devonport in May. Captain John Grant relieved Sherbrooke on 6 June and the ship was opened to visitors as part of the <a href="Festival%20of%20Britain">Festival of Britain</a> on 17 July. Five days later the visitors were stranded aboard ship overnight when a storm came up and forced "Indefatigable" to put to sea. The seas moderated the next day and the visitors departed in safety. Rear Admiral <a href="Royer%20Dick">Royer Dick</a> hoisted his flag aboard the carrier in September until she began a short refit at Devonport in January 1952.

"Indefatigable" joined "Implacable" for her annual winter visit to Gibraltar after completing her refit in February 1952. Over the summer she exercised with the Home Fleet and visited the Danish port of <a href="Aarhus">Aarhus</a>, where she was visited by Queen <a href="Alexandrine%20of%20Denmark">Alexandrine of Denmark</a> in July. Captain Ralph Fisher assumed command on 30 January 1953 and took her to sea three weeks later for exercises with the Home Fleet and her annual visit to Gibraltar. She returned to Portland in late March and visited Bournemouth at the end of May. She joined her sister and several other carriers on 9 June to sail for <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a> for the <a href="Fleet%20review%20%28Commonwealth%20realms%29%23Elizabeth%20II">Coronation Fleet Review</a> of <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> on 15 June as one of a fleet of nine carriers. "Indefatigable" joined her sister for fleet exercises off the <a href="Scilly%20Isles">Scilly Isles</a> and in the <a href="Bristol%20Channel">Bristol Channel</a> in September and October before beginning her annual refit on 6 October. The Admiralty announced on 26 January 1954 that both ships would be replaced as training ships and reduced to reserve. This had no short-term impact on their activities as they sailed for the Western Mediterranean on their annual winter cruise. The ship exercised with the Home Fleet and made a port visit to <a href="Casablanca">Casablanca</a>, <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, before visiting Gibraltar. Captain Hugh Browne assumed command on 10 May after Fisher had been promoted. The ship welcomed home Queen Elizabeth II and her husband four days later as they returned from their tour of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a>. The following month, "Indefatigable" exercised with the Home Fleet in Scottish waters and visited Aarhus again. In August she began transferring her training duties to the carrier and arrived at Rosyth on 2 September to be <a href="Ship%20decommissioning">paid off</a>, a process that took until the following month to complete. She was towed to <a href="Gareloch">Gareloch</a> in June 1955 where she was listed for disposal. "Indefatigable" was sold for scrap in September 1956 and subsequently broken up at <a href="Faslane">Faslane</a>.

HMAS Melbourne (R21)

HMAS "Melbourne" (R21) was a <a href="Majestic-class%20aircraft%20carrier">"Majestic"-class</a> light <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> (RAN). Operating from 1955 until 1982, she was the third and final conventional aircraft carrier to serve in the RAN. "Melbourne" was the only <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> naval vessel to sink two friendly warships in peacetime collisions.

The ship was laid down for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> as the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a> of the "Majestic" class in April 1943, and was launched as HMS "Majestic" (R77) in February 1945. At the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, work on the ship was suspended until she was purchased by the RAN in 1947. At the time of purchase, it was decided to incorporate new aircraft carrier technologies into the design, making "Melbourne" the third ship to be constructed with an <a href="angled%20flight%20deck">angled flight deck</a>. Delays in construction and integrating the enhancements meant that the carrier was not commissioned until 1955.

"Melbourne" never <a href="wikt%3Afire%20in%20anger">fired a shot in anger</a> during her career, having only peripheral, non-combat roles in relation to the <a href="Indonesia-Malaysia%20confrontation">Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation</a> and the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. She was, however, involved in two major collisions with allied vessels; though "Melbourne" was found not to be the primary cause of either incident. The <a href="Melbourne-Voyager%20collision">first</a> occurred on the evening of 10 February 1964, in which "Melbourne" rammed and sank the RAN destroyer , when the latter altered course across her bow. Eighty-two of "Voyager"s personnel were killed, and two <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a>s were held to investigate the incident. The <a href="Melbourne-Evans%20collision">second</a> collision occurred in the early morning of 3 June 1969, when "Melbourne" also rammed the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> (USN) destroyer in similar circumstances. Seventy-four American personnel died, and a joint USN–RAN Board of Inquiry was held. These incidents, along with several minor collisions, shipboard accidents, and aircraft losses, led to the reputation that "Melbourne" was <a href="jinx">jinx</a>ed.

"Melbourne" was paid off from RAN service in 1982. A proposal to convert her for use as a floating casino failed, and a 1984 sale was cancelled, before she was sold for scrap in 1985 and towed to China for <a href="ship%20breaking">breaking</a>. The scrapping was delayed so "Melbourne" could be studied by the <a href="People%27s%20Liberation%20Army%20Navy">People's Liberation Army Navy</a> (PLAN) as part of a secret project to develop a <a href="Future%20Chinese%20aircraft%20carrier">Chinese aircraft carrier</a> and used to train PLAN aviators in carrier flight operations.

"Melbourne" was constructed by <a href="Vickers-Armstrongs">Vickers-Armstrongs</a> at their Naval Construction Yard in <a href="Barrow-in-Furness">Barrow-in-Furness</a>, England. The ship was laid down as HMS "Majestic" on 15 April 1943, and was launched on 28 February 1945 by Lady Anderson, the wife of <a href="John%20Anderson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Waverley">Sir John Anderson</a>, the British <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>. Following the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> ordered the suspension of many British shipbuilding projects, including the fitting out of "Majestic" and her five sister ships. Construction resumed in 1946, and major <a href="%23Modifications%20during%20construction">modifications to the design</a> were incorporated.

A review by the Australian Government's Defence Committee held after recommended that the post-war forces of the RAN be structured around a Task Force incorporating multiple aircraft carriers. Initial plans were for three carriers, with two active and a third in reserve, although funding cuts led to the purchase of only two carriers in June 1947: "Majestic" and sister ship HMS "Terrible", for the combined cost of <a href="Australian%20pound">AU£</a>2.75 million, plus stores, fuel, and ammunition. As "Terrible" was the closer of the two ships to completion, she was finished without modification, and was commissioned into the RAN on 16 December 1948 as . Work progressed on "Majestic" at a slower rate, as she was upgraded with the latest technology and equipment. The "Colossus"-class carrier was loaned to the RAN from 13 November 1952 until 12 August 1955 to cover "Majestic"s absence.

Labour difficulties, late delivery of equipment, additional requirements for Australian operations, and the prioritisation of merchant shipping over naval construction delayed the completion of "Majestic". Incorporation of the new systems and enhancements caused the cost of the RAN carrier acquisition program to increase to AU£8.3 million. Construction and fitting out did not finish until October 1955. As the carrier neared completion, a commissioning crew was formed in Australia and first used to return "Vengeance" to the United Kingdom.

The completed carrier was commissioned into the RAN as HMAS "Majestic" on 26 October 1955. Two days later, the ship was renamed "Melbourne" by Lady White, the wife of Sir <a href="Thomas%20White%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Thomas White</a>, the Australian <a href="High%20Commissioner%20%28Commonwealth%29">High Commissioner</a> to the United Kingdom, and recommissioned.

As the lead ship of the "Majestic"-class of light aircraft carriers, "Melbourne" was conceived as a modified version of the "Colossus"-class carrier, incorporating improvements in flight deck design and habitability. "Majestic"- and "Colossus"-class carriers were almost identical in hull design and both were considered subclasses of the <a href="1942%20Design%20Light%20Fleet%20Carrier">'1942 design' light aircraft carrier program</a>. These carriers were intended as 'disposable warships': to be disposed of at the end of World War II or within three years of entering service.

"Melbourne" had a standard displacement of , which increased to at full load. At launch, the carrier was long <a href="Length%20overall">overall</a>, but this was increased by during a <a href="HMAS%20Melbourne%20%28R21%29%23Refits">refit</a> in 1969. She had a beam of , and a draught of . "Melbourne"s two propellers were driven by two Parsons single-reduction geared turbine sets providing 40,000 <a href="shaft%20horsepower">shp</a>, which were powered by four <a href="Admiralty%203-drum%20boiler">Admiralty 3-drum boiler</a>s. The carrier could achieve a top speed of , and a range of at or at . The size of the ship's company averaged 1,350 officers and sailors, including 350 personnel from the embarked <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm%20%28RAN%29">Fleet Air Arm</a> squadrons.

Following the recommencement of construction, modifications were made to the ship, based on wartime experience and Britain's post-war carrier warfare technology and innovations. These included an <a href="angled%20flight%20deck">angled flight deck</a>, <a href="steam%20catapult">steam catapult</a> and a <a href="mirror%20landing%20aid">mirror landing aid</a>, making "Melbourne" the third aircraft carrier (following and ) to be constructed with these features, instead of having them added later.

The main modifications centred around the need to operate jet aircraft, which were larger and heavier than those that the carrier was originally designed for. The flight deck was angled 5.5 degrees left of the carrier's centreline, to allow for the simultaneous launch and recovery of aircraft. Despite an increase to approximately one acre (4,000 square metres, 4,800 square yards) in area, the deck was still significantly smaller than other <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> era carriers; <a href="S-2%20Tracker">S-2 Tracker</a>s, with their wingspan, had less than a metre's clearance for their <a href="starboard">starboard</a> wingtip when landing, and pilots from other navies often refused to attempt landing. Water rationing was required in the early years of the carrier's operation, as the ship's fresh water supply was insufficient to freely provide for the <a href="steam%20catapult">steam catapult</a>, propulsion turbines and crew. The flight deck, hangar deck and aircraft lifts were strengthened, and reinforced <a href="arrestor%20cable">arrestor cable</a>s were installed. Flight direction radar was included, making "Melbourne" the only military airfield in the <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>n region at the time capable of operating aircraft at night and in poor weather.

Early in her career, "Melbourne" underwent a series of short annual refits, commencing in September and ending in January or February of the next year. As time passed, the refits increased in duration or were replaced by major upgrades or overhauls.

"Melbourne"s first major refit started in December 1967 and continued until February 1969, during which she was upgraded to operate <a href="S-2%20Tracker">S-2 Tracker</a> and <a href="A-4%20Skyhawk">A-4 Skyhawk</a> aircraft. The modifications cost A$8.5 million, and included an overhaul of the hull and machinery, strengthening of the flight deck, improvements to the catapult and arrestor cables, modification of the aviation fuel systems and flight control arrangements, and upgrades of the navigational aids and radar. Air conditioning systems and a <a href="liquid%20oxygen">liquid oxygen</a> generation plant were also installed. "Melbourne" re-entered service at the conclusion of the refits on 14 February, and performed sea trials in Jervis Bay from 17 February until 5 May. This was the largest project undertaken by <a href="HMAS%20Kuttabul%20%28naval%20base%29">Garden Island Dockyard</a> to that date.

The next major refit was required in 1971 for the scheduled rebuilding of the catapult, which was only possible after components were sourced from and . The flight deck was again reinforced and strengthened, and attempts were made to increase the effectiveness of the air conditioning system installed in 1969. "Melbourne" had been designed to operate in North Atlantic and Arctic climates, and the original ventilation systems were inappropriate for her primary operating climate, the tropics. The 1969 and 1971 refits did improve conditions, although there was little scope for upgrade, and the system was still inadequate: temperatures inside the ship continued to reach over , and on one occasion a hold reached . The refit took seven months to complete, and cost A$2 million.

More large-scale refits occurred throughout the rest of the 1970s. "Melbourne" was back in dock from November 1972 until August 1973, with further work done to her catapult. The next major refit ran from April 1975 to June 1976, and was intended to increase the operational lifespan of the carrier to at least 1985. The refit was lengthened by <a href="industrial%20action">industrial action</a> at the dockyard. "Melbourne" underwent another refit from late 1978 until August 1979. A refit scheduled to begin in late 1981 was postponed in September until a decision regarding <a href="%23Replacement">the new carrier</a> was made, then cancelled in January 1982, after the announcement that the RAN would be <a href="%23HMS%20Invincible">acquiring HMS "Invincible"</a>.

"Melbourne" carried a defensive armament of <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft guns</a> and an air group comprising both attack and anti-submarine aircraft. As the ship was never directly involved in a conflict, her weapons and embarked aircraft did not fire a shot in anger.

"Melbourne"s initial armament included 25 <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun">40 mm Bofors</a> anti-aircraft guns: six twin and thirteen single mountings. The radar suite consisted of three <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20277">Type 277Q</a> height-finding sets, a <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20293">Type 293Q</a> surface search set, and a Type 978 navigational set. Between entering service and 1959, four of the single Bofors were removed.

During the 1967–1969 refit, thirteen Bofors were removed, leaving four twin and four single mountings. The three 277Q radars were replaced with updated American and Dutch designs: a LW-02 air search set and a SPN-35 landing aid radar. A <a href="TACAN">TACAN</a> aerial and <a href="electronic%20countermeasures">electronic countermeasures</a> pods were also installed during this refit. The four Bofors twin mountings were removed in 1980.

"Melbourne" carried three <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm%20%28RAN%29">Fleet Air Arm</a> squadrons. Initially, she had up to 22 planes and 2 helicopters embarked at any time. The number of aircraft gradually increased until 1972, when the air group peaked at 27 aircraft. Approximately 350 Fleet Air Arm personnel were stationed aboard the carrier.

Initially, two types of fixed-wing aircraft were operated from "Melbourne". <a href="de%20Havilland%20Sea%20Venom">de Havilland Sea Venom</a> FAW.53 fighter aircraft were flown by <a href="805%20Squadron%20RAN">805 Squadron RAN</a> and <a href="808%20Squadron%20RAN">808 Squadron RAN</a>, while <a href="Fairey%20Gannet">Fairey Gannet</a> anti-submarine strike aircraft were operated by <a href="816%20Squadron%20RAN">816 Squadron RAN</a> and <a href="817%20Squadron%20RAN">817 Squadron RAN</a>. At the time of their arrival, the Sea Venoms were the only radar equipped and all-weather combat aircraft in the Southern Hemisphere. At "Melbourne"s commissioning, the standard air group consisted of eight Sea Venoms and two squadrons of eight Gannets, with two <a href="Bristol%20Sycamore">Bristol Sycamore</a> search-and-rescue helicopters added shortly after the carrier entered service.

These aircraft were due to become obsolete in the late 1950s, and the RAN considered purchasing modern aircraft of French or Italian design, which were better suited to light carrier operations than equivalent British aircraft, or <a href="HMAS%20Melbourne%20%28R21%29%23Replacement">replace "Melbourne"</a> with a larger carrier. Instead of pursuing either alternative, the Australian government announced in 1959 that "Melbourne" would be reconfigured during her 1963 refit to operate as a helicopter carrier. The fixed-wing aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm were marked for replacement by 27 <a href="Westland%20Wessex">Westland Wessex</a> anti-submarine helicopters. A reduction of embarked plane numbers to four Sea Venoms and six Gannets, along with regular rotation and careful use of the aircraft, extended their service life until the mid-1960s, while the size of the air group was maintained by carrying up to ten Wessex helicopters. The decision to retire the fixed-wing component of the Fleet Air Arm was rescinded in 1963, and on 10 November 1964, a AU£212 million increase in defence spending included the purchase of new aircraft for "Melbourne".
The RAN planned to acquire 14 <a href="S-2%20Tracker">Grumman S-2E Tracker</a> anti-submarine aircraft, and modernise "Melbourne" to operate the aircraft. The acquisition of 18 <a href="A-4%20Skyhawk">Douglas A-4 Skyhawk</a> fighter-bombers was also suggested, but these were dropped from the initial plan. A separate proposal to order 10 <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20A-4G%20Skyhawk">A-4G Skyhawks</a>, a variant of the Skyhawk designed specifically for the RAN and optimised for air defence, was approved in 1965. Both aircraft types entered RAN service in 1968, with the Trackers operated by <a href="816%20Squadron%20RAN">816 Squadron RAN</a> and <a href="851%20Squadron%20RAN">851 Squadron RAN</a>, and the Skyhawks by <a href="805%20Squadron%20RAN">805 Squadron RAN</a> and <a href="724%20Squadron%20RAN">724 Squadron RAN</a>. The aircraft did not fly from "Melbourne" until the conclusion of her refit in 1969. In 1969, the RAN purchased another ten A-4G Skyhawks, instead of the proposed seventh and eighth <a href="Oberon-class%20submarine">"Oberon"-class</a> submarines. "Melbourne" operated a standard air group of four Skyhawks, six Trackers, and ten Wessex helicopters until 1972, when the Wessexes were replaced with ten <a href="Westland%20Sea%20King">Westland Sea King</a> anti-submarine warfare helicopters and the number of Skyhawks doubled. Although replaced by the Sea King, up to three Wessex helicopters could be carried as search-and-rescue aircraft.

On 5 December 1976, a fire at the Naval Air Station destroyed or heavily damaged 12 of the Fleet Air Arm's 13 S-2E Trackers. The carrier was sent to the United States in 1977 to transport back 16 S-2G Tracker aircraft as replacements.

Over the course of her career, over thirty aircraft were either lost or heavily damaged while operating from "Melbourne". The majority of the aircraft <a href="water%20landing">ditched</a> or crashed over the side, but some losses were due to catapult or arrestor cable failures. After "Melbourne" was decommissioned, the Fleet Air Arm ceased fixed-wing combat aircraft operation in 1984, with the final Tracker flight saluting the decommissioned carrier.

"Melbourne" was the third and final conventional aircraft carrier to operate with the RAN. Following the first decommissioning of sister ship in 1958, "Melbourne" became the only aircraft carrier in Australian service. "Melbourne" was unavailable to provide air cover for the RAN for up to four months in every year; this time was required for refits, refuelling, personnel leave, and non-carrier duties, such as the transportation of troops or aircraft. Although one of the largest ships to serve in the RAN, "Melbourne" was one of the smallest carriers to operate in the post-World War II period. A decision was made in 1959 to restrict "Melbourne"s role to helicopter operations only, but was reversed shortly before its planned 1963 implementation.

As well as an operational aircraft carrier, "Melbourne" was Flagship of the RAN, a role she received almost immediately following her 1956 arrival in Australia, and fulfilled until her decommissioning in 1982. During her service, the carrier was deployed overseas on 35 occasions, visited over 22 countries, and was seen as the physical and psychological centrepiece of the RAN fleet.

As "Melbourne" was the only ship of her size (both in dimensions and ship's company) in the RAN, the carrier underwent a regular rotation of commanding officers to give them experience. Commanding officers were changed on average every fifteen months, with few remaining on board for more than two years. The majority of "Melbourne"s commanders later reached <a href="flag%20officer">flag rank</a>. The carrier was also called on to perform <a href="underway%20replenishment">underway replenishment</a>s and command and control functions.

Following a working-up period in British waters, "Melbourne" departed Glasgow on 11 March 1956 on her <a href="maiden%20voyage">maiden voyage</a> to Australia via the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>. Aboard were the 64 aircraft of RAN squadrons <a href="808%20Squadron%20RAN">808</a>, <a href="816%20Squadron%20RAN">816</a>, and <a href="817%20Squadron%20RAN">817</a>, as well as the racing yacht "Samuel Pepys" (named after the <a href="Samuel%20Pepys">English naval administrator and diarist</a>), which was a gift to the RAN Sailing Association from the Royal Navy. The ship visited <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, <a href="Malta">Malta</a>, <a href="Port%20Said">Port Said</a>, <a href="Aden">Aden</a>, and <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a>, before arriving in <a href="Fremantle">Fremantle</a> on 24 April 1956. "Melbourne" sailed east via the <a href="Great%20Australian%20Bight">Great Australian Bight</a>, meeting sister ship near <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a> a week later. After visiting <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> and <a href="Jervis%20Bay">Jervis Bay</a>, where the aircraft were offloaded and sent to Naval Air Station , the carrier concluded her maiden voyage in Sydney on 10 May. The role of flagship was transferred from "Sydney" to "Melbourne" three days later. The carrier immediately underwent a two and a half-month refit, allowing for the inspection of machinery and repair of defects detected during the maiden voyage. "Melbourne" spent from September to November in Southeast Asian waters, during which she participated in Exercise Albatross and received an official visit by <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> president <a href="Ramon%20Magsaysay">Ramon Magsaysay</a>. On return to Australia in mid-November, the carrier visited Melbourne for the <a href="1956%20Summer%20Olympics">1956 Olympics</a>, where 200 of "Melbourne"s complement were provided to work as signallers, event marshals, carpenters, and medical workers.

In February 1957, "Melbourne" was sent to the <a href="Royal%20Hobart%20Regatta">Royal Hobart Regatta</a>. Following this, she travelled to <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, where she participated in exercises with <a href="HMS%20Royalist%20%2889%29">HMNZS "Royalist"</a> and visited several New Zealand ports. The first of several annual three-month deployments to Southeast Asia as part of the <a href="Far%20East%20Strategic%20Reserve">Far East Strategic Reserve</a> began in April, with "Melbourne" returning to Darwin at the end of June. The carrier spent the rest of the year visiting Australian ports for open inspections by the public. During the visit to <a href="Port%20Adelaide">Port Adelaide</a>, on 28 October 1957, "Melbourne" was slightly damaged when she was struck by MV "Straat Lanka"—the first of several minor collisions the carrier would experience throughout her career. Operations for the year concluded with participation in Exercise Astrolabe off <a href="Lord%20Howe%20Island">Lord Howe Island</a>, with ships from the RAN, Royal Navy, and <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Navy">Royal New Zealand Navy</a>, before returning to Sydney on 13 December.
From February until July 1958, "Melbourne" was deployed on a flag-showing cruise. During this cruise the carrier participated in four inter-fleet exercises and visited Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Japan, <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> and <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>. On return to Sydney, "Melbourne" entered a short refit, which concluded on 13 October and was immediately followed by a visit to <a href="Port%20Phillip">Port Phillip</a>, where the carrier was displayed to <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> officer cadets before the carrier returned to Sydney. At the start of 1959, "Melbourne" spent four days in her namesake city, where she was used for the filming of <a href="On%20the%20Beach%20%281959%20film%29">"On The Beach"</a>, based on <a href="Nevil%20Shute">Nevil Shute</a>'s post-apocalyptic <a href="On%20the%20Beach%20%28novel%29">novel of the same name</a>. After filming concluded, the carrier participated in a demonstration exercise off the coast of Sydney before embarking on a <a href="Far%20East%20Strategic%20Reserve">Far East Strategic Reserve</a> deployment from March until May. The rest of the year was spent visiting Australian and New Zealand ports.

The following year, 1960, was a bad year for the carrier's air group, with four Sea Venoms and two Gannets damaged in separate incidents aboard "Melbourne". All four Sea Venom incidents occurred in March, with three attributed to aircrew error and one to brake failure. The year began with exercises en route to Adelaide, followed by a visit to the Royal Hobart Regatta. The carrier's Strategic Reserve deployment ran from April to June, and was followed by manoeuvres along the east coast of Australia until September. In the lead up to "Melbourne"s 1961 deployment to the Strategic Reserve, the carrier visited <a href="Bombay">Bombay</a>, <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a>, and <a href="Trincomalee">Trincomalee</a>. It was the first time a flagship of the RAN had entered Indian waters. "Melbourne" returned to Australia in June, and on 15 June led several ships in a ceremonial entry to Sydney Harbour to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the RAN. In August, "Melbourne" was called upon to lead Exercise Tuckerbox, in the <a href="Coral%20Sea">Coral Sea</a>. Following the conclusion of Tuckerbox, the carrier visited several New Zealand ports before returning to Sydney for demonstration exercises and public relations activities.

In 1962, "Melbourne" began the year's activities at the Royal Hobart Regatta, before sailing to her Strategic Reserve deployment, by way of Adelaide and Fremantle. After Strategic Reserve duties were completed, the carrier visited Japan, <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, and <a href="Manus%20Island">Manus Island</a> before returning to Sydney in late July. In September, "Melbourne" reprised her role as the leader of Exercise Tuckerbox II. The 10,000th catapult launch from "Melbourne" occurred in late 1962. The carrier's annual refit began in Sydney on 1 October. At the beginning of 1963, "Melbourne" again visited to the Royal Hobart Regatta, which was immediately followed by a deployment to the Strategic Reserve, including involvement in <a href="Southeast%20Asia%20Treaty%20Organization">SEATO</a> Exercise Sea Serpent. The 20,000th landing on "Melbourne" was performed in April by a Gannet, and in September, "Melbourne" participated in Exercise Carbine near <a href="Hervey%20Bay">Hervey Bay</a>, Queensland.

On 10 February 1964, "Melbourne" was performing trials in <a href="Jervis%20Bay">Jervis Bay</a> under the command of Captain John Robertson, following the annual refit. The <a href="Daring-class%20destroyer%20%281949%29">"Daring"-class destroyer</a> was also present, undergoing her own trials following refit, under the command of Captain Duncan Stevens. The trials involved interactions between both ships, and when "Melbourne" performed night-flying exercises that evening, "Voyager" acted as the carrier's <a href="plane%20guard">plane guard</a> escort. This required "Voyager" to maintain a position 20° off "Melbourne"s port quarter at a distance from the carrier of .
Early in the evening, "Voyager" had no difficulties maintaining her position during the manoeuvres both ships performed. Following a series of turns intended to reverse the courses of both ships beginning at 8:40 pm, "Voyager" ended up to starboard of "Melbourne". At 8:52 pm, "Voyager" was ordered to resume the plane guard station. The procedure to accomplish this required "Voyager" to turn away from "Melbourne" in a large circle, cross behind the carrier, then take position off "Melbourne"s port side. Instead, "Voyager" first turned to starboard, away from "Melbourne", then turned to port without warning. It was initially assumed by "Melbourne"s bridge crew that "Voyager" was conducting a series of tight turns to lose speed before swinging behind "Melbourne", but "Voyager" did not alter course again. At 8:55 pm, with "Voyager" approaching, "Melbourne"s navigator ordered the carrier's engines to half astern speed, with Robertson ordering an increase to full astern a few seconds later. At the same time, Stevens, having just become aware of the situation, gave the order "Full ahead both engines. Hard-a starboard.", before instructing the destroyer's Quartermaster to announce that a collision was imminent. Both ships' measures were too late to avoid a collision; "Melbourne" hit "Voyager" at 8:56 pm.

"Melbourne" struck "Voyager" just aft of the destroyer's bridge, rolling the destroyer to starboard before cutting her in half. "Voyager"s forward boiler exploded, briefly setting fire to the bow of the carrier before it was extinguished by seawater. The destroyer's forward section sank quickly, under the weight of the two gun turrets. The aft section did not begin sinking until half an hour after the collision, completely submerging just after midnight. Messages were immediately sent to the Fleet Headquarters in Sydney, although staff in Sydney initially underestimated the extent of the damage to "Voyager". "Melbourne" launched her boats to recover survivors, and the carrier's wardroom and C Hangar were prepared for casualties. At 9:58 pm, "Melbourne" was informed that search-and-rescue boats from , helicopters from , and five <a href="Ton-class%20minesweeper">"Ton"-class minesweepers</a> had been despatched to assist in the search.
"Melbourne" arrived in Sydney with the survivors on 14 February, and after spending time alongside at <a href="Fleet%20Base%20East">Garden Island</a>, was moved to <a href="Cockatoo%20Island%20Dockyard">Cockatoo Island Dockyard</a> on 25 March, where repairs were undertaken; the damaged section of the bow was cut away and repairs to the ship's internal structure were undertaken in <a href="drydock">drydock</a>, while a 40-ton prefabricated bow was constructed. Once this was completed, "Melbourne" was removed while the new bow was put in place in the drydock; "Melbourne" was then returned to the drydock where her new bow was fitted. The work was eventually completed on 27 April, with the shipyard receiving a commendation.

Of the 314 personnel aboard "Voyager" at the time of the collision, 14 officers, 67 sailors, and 1 civilian dockyard worker were killed, including Stevens and all but two of the bridge team. A <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> into the <a href="Melbourne-Voyager%20collision">events of the collision</a> was held in 1964, and found that while "Voyager" was primarily at fault for neglecting to maintain an effective lookout and awareness of the larger ship's location, "Melbourne"s bridge crew was also at fault, for failing to alert "Voyager" and not taking measures to avoid the collision. Robertson was posted to the training base —a move that he and the Australian media saw as tantamount to a demotion—but resigned instead. The Royal Commission and its aftermath were poorly handled, and following pressure from the public, media, and politicians, combined with revelations by "Voyager"s former executive officer that Stevens may have been unfit for command, a second Royal Commission was opened in 1967. This is the only time in Australian history two Royal Commissions have been held for a single incident. The second commission found that Stevens was medically unfit for command and that some of the findings of the first Royal Commission were therefore based on incorrect assumptions. Robertson and the other officers of "Melbourne" were absolved of blame for the incident.

"Melbourne" spent ten weeks at <a href="Cockatoo%20Island%20Dockyard">Cockatoo Island Dockyard</a>, having her new bow fitted. Following the repairs, "Melbourne" was involved in Strategic Reserve deployments and exercises in Southeast Asia from June until September 1964. During this deployment, the carrier visited <a href="U.S.%20Naval%20Base%20Subic%20Bay">Subic Bay</a>, where the RAN performed flight deck trials with <a href="S-2%20Tracker">S-2 Tracker</a> anti-submarine aircraft and <a href="A-4%20Skyhawk">A-4 Skyhawk</a> attack fighters. The success of the trials, along with the discovery that "Melbourne" was able to operate both aircraft with relatively minor modification, led the Australian Government to approve the purchase of these aircraft.
From March 1965 until mid-1967, "Melbourne" underwent a regular pattern of deployments to Southeast Asia, exercises, and flag-showing visits to nations in the Asia-Pacific region. Several of the Southeast Asian deployments were related to the <a href="Indonesia-Malaysia%20confrontation">Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation</a>, and involved participation in <a href="show%20of%20force">show of force</a> exercises off the coast of Malaysia. During 1965 and 1966, "Melbourne" escorted sister ship , which had been recommissioned as a troop transport, for short periods during the latter's first, third, and fourth transport voyages to Vietnam. Despite the carrier being the centrepiece of several plans to involve Australian forces in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, the escort runs were the extent of "Melbourne"s participation in the conflict, and the carrier remained outside the <a href="Market%20Time">Market Time</a> area while "Sydney" and her other escorts proceeded to <a href="V%C5%A9ng%20T%C3%A0u">Vũng Tàu</a>. As the carrier was optimised for anti-submarine warfare, there was little need for her at the start of the war. Utilising the carrier was suggested again by RAN officials in March 1966, when the <a href="United%20States%20Seventh%20Fleet">United States Seventh Fleet</a> was having difficulties maintaining anti-submarine patrols around <a href="Yankee%20Station">Yankee Station</a>, but "Melbourne" could only remain on station for a single, ten-day period, a third of the time that US carriers were operational for on rotating deployments. Seventh Fleet staff suggested in April 1967 that "Melbourne" deploy in the anti-submarine role, but nothing came of these talks. Consideration was also given to using "Melbourne" as a floating helicopter base, but only ten Wessex helicopters could be provided, and modifications were required for them to operate as troop carriers. Both options were made more prohibitive by the need to supply at least two escorts for the carrier at a time when the RAN was having difficulty meeting deployment commitments with the available destroyers and destroyer escorts.

In September 1967, "Melbourne" travelled to the United States to collect new aircraft: 14 Trackers and 10 Skyhawks. To operate the new aircraft, the carrier received a <a href="HMAS%20Melbourne%20%28R21%29%23Refits">major refit</a> on her return to Sydney, which began in December 1967. In May 1967, it was proposed that while "Melbourne" was out of service, A-4 Skyhawk pilots and maintenance personnel could be attached to a <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> Skyhawk squadron in South Vietnam. Australian aircraft were not to be provided, as the A-4G Skyhawks used by the RAN were optimised for air defence, not the fighter-bomber role performed by the Marines, and would have suffered heavy losses from North Vietnam's heavy anti-aircraft defences. This deployment did not occur; the Skyhawk pilot training program was experiencing delays because US squadrons were being shipped training equipment and replacement parts in priority to the RAN, and sending qualified pilots overseas would have caused further holdups with the program, while also disrupting "Melbourne"s post-refit reactivation. "Melbourne" re-entered service at the conclusion of the refit on 14 February 1969. She performed sea trials in Jervis Bay from 17 February until 5 May, then sailed for <a href="Subic%20Bay">Subic Bay</a>, Philippines, to participate in <a href="Southeast%20Asia%20Treaty%20Organization">SEATO</a> Exercise Sea Spirit.

"Melbourne"s commanding officer during the SEATO exercise was Captain John Phillip Stevenson. Rear Admiral <a href="John%20Crabb%20%28admiral%29">John Crabb</a>, the <a href="Flag%20Officer%20Commanding%20Australian%20Fleet">Flag Officer Commanding Australian Fleet</a>, was also embarked on the carrier. During Sea Spirit, "Melbourne" was assigned five escorts: US Ships , , and , <a href="HMS%20Blackpool%20%28F77%29">HMNZS "Blackpool"</a>, and . Stevenson held a dinner for the five escort captains at the start of the exercise, during which he recounted the events of the <a href="Melbourne-Voyager%20collision">"Melbourne"–"Voyager" collision</a>, emphasised the need for caution when operating near the carrier, and provided written instructions on how to avoid such a situation developing again. Additionally, during the lead up to the exercise, Admiral Crabb had strongly warned that all repositioning manoeuvres performed by the escorts had to commence with a turn away from "Melbourne". Despite these warnings, a near-miss occurred in the early hours of 31 May when "Larson" turned towards the carrier after being ordered to the <a href="plane%20guard">plane guard</a> station. Subsequent action narrowly prevented a collision. The escorts were again warned about the dangers of operating near the carrier and informed of Stevenson's expectations, while the minimum distance between carrier and escorts was increased from .
On the night of 2–3 June 1969, "Melbourne" and her escorts were involved in anti-submarine training exercises in the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a>. In preparation for launching a Tracker, Stevenson ordered "Evans" to the plane guard station, reminded the destroyer of "Melbourne"s course, and instructed the carrier's navigational lights to be brought to full brilliance. "Evans" had performed the manoeuvre four times over the course of the night. "Evans" was positioned on "Melbourne"s port bow, but began the manoeuvre by turning starboard, towards the carrier. A radio message was sent from "Melbourne" to "Evans" bridge and <a href="Combat%20Information%20Centre">Combat Information Centre</a>, warning the destroyer that she was on a collision course, which "Evans" acknowledged. Seeing the destroyer take no action and on a course to place herself under "Melbourne"s bow, Stevenson ordered the carrier hard to port, signalling the turn by both radio and siren blasts. At approximately the same time, "Evans" turned hard to starboard to avoid the approaching carrier. It is uncertain which ship began to manoeuvre first, but each ship's bridge crew claimed that they were informed of the other ship's turn after they commenced their own. After having narrowly passed in front of "Melbourne", the turns quickly placed "Evans" back in the carrier's path. "Melbourne" hit "Evans" amidships at 3:15 am, cutting the destroyer in two.

Seventy-four of the 273 personnel from "Evans" were killed in the collision, with the majority of these believed to have been asleep or trapped inside the bow section, which sank within minutes. "Melbourne" deployed her boats, life rafts, and lifebuoys, before carefully manoeuvring alongside the stern section of "Evans", where both ships' crews used mooring lines to lash the ships together. Sailors from "Melbourne" dived from the flight deck into the water to rescue overboard survivors close to the carrier, while the carrier's boats and helicopters collected those farther out. All of the survivors were located within 12 minutes of the collision and rescued before half an hour had passed, although the search continued for fifteen more hours. After "Evans" stern was evacuated, it was cast off, while the carrier moved away to avoid damage. The stern did not sink, and was later recovered, stripped of parts, and sunk for target practice.
Following the collision, "Melbourne" travelled to Singapore for temporary repairs to her bow, arriving on 6 June. "Melbourne" departed Singapore on 27 June and arrived in Sydney on 9 July, where the carrier underwent almost identical repairs at <a href="Cockatoo%20Island%20Dockyard">Cockatoo Island Dockyard</a> as in 1964 (primarily the installation of a new bow section). However, an industrial dispute amongst the shipyard workers meant that, although the work was completed in early September, the ship remained in the drydock until 11 October.

A Joint RAN-USN <a href="Board%20of%20Inquiry">Board of Inquiry</a> was established to investigate <a href="Melbourne-Evans%20collision">the incident</a>, and was in session over June and July 1969. The Board found "Evans" partially at fault for the collision, but also faulted "Melbourne" for not taking evasive action sooner, even though international sea regulations dictated that in the lead up to a collision, the larger ship was required to maintain course and speed. It was learned during the inquiry that "Evans" commanding officer was asleep in his quarters at the time of the incident, and charge of the vessel was held by Lieutenants Ronald Ramsey and James Hopson; the former had failed the qualification exam to stand watch, while the latter was at sea for the first time. Subsequent to the inquiry, the three USN officers and Stevenson were <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>led by their respective navies on charges of negligence, with the three USN officers found guilty and Stevenson 'Honourably Acquitted'. Despite the findings, Stevenson's next posting was as a minor flag officer's chief of staff, seen by him as a demotion in all but name. In a repeat of the aftermath of the "Voyager" collision, "Melbourne"s captain resigned amid accusations of scapegoating. In December 2012, Stevenson announced that he had received a letter from the <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Defence</a>, apologising for his treatment by the RAN and the government of the day.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, replacing parts became an increasing problem. Components were failing due to wear and age, but the companies responsible for manufacturing the parts had gone out of business during the previous twenty years, sometimes immediately after World War II ended. The carrier's engineers often resorted to making replacements from scratch.

In 1970, "Melbourne" participated in three major inter-navy exercises: Sea Rover with SEATO forces in the South China Sea, Bersatu Padu with <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">British Commonwealth</a> forces off Malaysia, and Swan Lake with the Royal Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy off Western Australia. During this year, the carrier also visited Japan to participate in <a href="Expo%20%2770">Expo '70</a>, and was hit by <a href="Manly%20ferry">Manly ferry</a> "<a href="South%20Steyne">South Steyne</a>" while alongside at Garden Island, causing minor damage to both vessels. "Melbourne" was out of service for most of 1971 while she underwent <a href="HMAS%20Melbourne%20%28R21%29%23Refits">refits</a>, which concluded in early August. In mid-1971, the Australian military's Joint Planning Committee considered using "Melbourne" as a transport to help complete the withdrawal of the <a href="1st%20Australian%20Task%20Force">Australian Task Force</a> from Vietnam before the end of 1971. While the Army supported this proposal, the Navy successfully argued against its implementation, claiming that transporting troops and cargo would be misusing Australia's only active aircraft carrier, and would prevent "Melbourne" from participating in several major multi-national exercises. The refit concluded in late 1971, with the carrier participating in the first <a href="RIMPAC">RIMPAC</a> exercise, RIMPAC 71, before the end of the year.

Operations in 1972 commenced with a three-month deployment to Southeast Asia. During this deployment, "Melbourne" led a fleet of 17 ships from the RAN, Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy, US Navy, <a href="Philippine%20Navy">Philippine Navy</a>, and <a href="Royal%20Thai%20Navy">Royal Thai Navy</a> in Exercise Sea Hawk. This was followed by goodwill visits to numerous Southeast Asian ports, including Hong Kong, <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>, <a href="Manila">Manila</a>, Singapore, and <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a>, before "Melbourne" returned to Sydney at the end of April. The carrier spent May performing exercises off the New South Wales coast, during which she was called on to rescue three fisherman who had been stranded at sea for the previous two days. In August, "Melbourne" sailed for Hawaii to participate in RIMPAC 72. At the conclusion of this exercise, "Melbourne" proceeded to Japan on a diplomatic visit, then sailed to the Philippines to exercise with SEATO ships. During this deployment, a fire ignited inside the ship's main switchboard. The carrier returned to Australia on 27 November after 101 days at sea, and underwent a seven-month refit. On 24 August 1973, "Melbourne" returned to Hawaii to participate in RIMPAC 73. She returned to Australia on 12 October, but sailed out ten days later to participate in Exercise Leadline off Malaysia, before reaching Sydney again in December.
"Melbourne" began 1974 by transporting 120 <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian soldiers</a> to a temporary assignment with an American infantry battalion based in Hawaii. She then sailed to San Francisco to collect 12 new <a href="Boeing%20CH-47%20Chinook%20in%20Australian%20service">Chinook</a> and five <a href="UH-1%20Iroquois">UH-1 Iroquois</a> helicopters for the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a>, arriving in Australia with her cargo in April. In June, the carrier took part in <a href="Exercise%20Kangaroo">Exercise Kangaroo</a> in the Coral Sea, before returning to Sydney in July. On 11 July, the passenger liner <a href="SS%20America%20%281940%29">SS "Australis"</a> hit and damaged "Melbourne" in Sydney Harbour. In November, the carrier took part in disaster relief exercises. These were prophetic, as on the night of 24–25 December 1974, <a href="Cyclone%20Tracy">Cyclone Tracy</a> destroyed the city of <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>. "Melbourne"s ship's company was recalled immediately from leave, the ship was loaded with supplies, and the carrier departed Sydney on 26 December in the company of . "Melbourne", "Brisbane", and eleven other ships were deployed as part of the largest peacetime rescue effort ever organised by the RAN: <a href="Operation%20Navy%20Help%20Darwin">Operation Navy Help Darwin</a>. "Melbourne" remained off Darwin until 18 January 1975, acting as operational headquarters and a helicopter base. During this operation, the seven <a href="Westland%20Wessex">Wessex</a> helicopters embarked on "Melbourne" performed 2,493 flights, carrying 7,824 passengers and 107 tons of cargo.

Following Navy Help Darwin, "Melbourne" participated in RIMPAC 75, then returned to Sydney for a fourteen-month refit, which was delayed by industrial action at the dockyard. While moored in Sydney Harbour, on 24 July, "Melbourne" was struck by Japanese cargo ship "Blue Andromeda". While working up following the refit, "Melbourne" and provided assistance to MV "Miss Chief" off the coast of <a href="Bundaberg">Bundaberg</a>, Queensland on 16 August 1976. In October, "Melbourne" participated in Exercise Kangaroo II, before sailing to her namesake city for the carrier's 21st birthday celebrations, then returning to Sydney on 5 November.

On 5 December 1976, a fire deliberately lit at by a member of the Fleet Air Arm damaged or destroyed all but one of Australia's <a href="S-2%20Tracker">S-2 Tracker</a>s. Following participation in RIMPAC 77, "Melbourne" was sent to <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> to collect replacement aircraft. Arriving back in Sydney on 5 April, the carrier was sent on a five-month deployment to the United Kingdom on 28 April, accompanied by and . En route, "Melbourne" lost a <a href="Westland%20Sea%20King">Sea King</a> in the Indian Ocean on 9 May, with the aircrew recovered by "Brisbane". A Tracker from "Melbourne" located the disabled Dutch vessel "Impala Princess" in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Aden">Gulf of Aden</a> on 25 May and directed a French destroyer to assist. Two <a href="40%20mm%20Bofors">Bofors</a> naval guns were deposited by "Melbourne" at <a href="Souda%20Bay">Souda Bay</a>, Crete on 2 June, marking the first visit of an Australian warship to Crete since June 1941. These weapons were donated to the Australian War Memorial at Stavromenos, in Crete's <a href="Rethymno%20%28regional%20unit%29">Rethymno regional unit</a>. The highlight of the deployment saw the three ships represent Australia and New Zealand at the <a href="Silver%20Jubilee%20of%20Elizabeth%20II">Silver Jubilee</a> Naval Review on 28 June 1977. A two-seat <a href="Hawker%20Siddeley%20Harrier">Harrier jump jet</a> demonstrator undertook a series of trial takeoffs and landings aboard "Melbourne" on 30 June: a trial organised as part of the project overseeing the ship's <a href="HMAS%20Melbourne%20%28R21%29%23Replacement">potential replacement</a>. Following the Jubilee Review and participation in Exercise Highwood in July, "Melbourne" and her escorts returned to Australia, arriving in Fremantle on 19 September and Sydney on 4 October. "Melbourne" was docked in Garden Island's drydock on arrival, where she remained until January 1978.
At the end of March 1978, "Melbourne" left Sydney for RIMPAC 78. During this exercise, "Melbourne" acquired the nickname 'Little M' after working with 'Big E' —the smallest and largest aircraft carriers (respectively) in operation at the time. On return in July, the carrier entered a major refit, which continued until 3 August 1979. During this refit, on 3 March, a boiler explosion caused minor damage to the carrier. The remainder of the year involved participation in three exercises, Tasmanex off Wellington, New Zealand, Sea Eagle I in the Tasman Sea, and Kangaroo III in the Coral Sea. During Tasmanex, "Melbourne" lost her LW-02 radar aerial and a Skyhawk, both of which fell overboard during heavy seas.

During February and March 1980, "Melbourne" participated in RIMPAC 80, as the flagship of Battle Group Two. This was immediately followed by a visit to the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> in early April. The carrier was in Sydney from mid-April until mid-August, during which the 25th anniversary of "Melbourne"s service in the RAN was celebrated on 15 August with a cocktail party aboard the carrier, popularly referred to as 'The Night of the Admirals'. On 18 August, "Melbourne" sailed for Fremantle to participate in Exercise Sandgroper 80. On 8 September, "Melbourne", accompanied by , , , , and deployed to the Indian Ocean as the Australian Squadron for a flag-showing cruise. During this cruise two Skyhawks were lost: on 2 and 21 October. On 24 October, a Tracker from "Melbourne" observed Soviet warships <a href="Soviet%20frigate%20Storozhevoy">"Storozhevoy"</a> and <a href="Ivan%20Rogov-class%20landing%20ship">"Ivan Rogov"</a> shadowing the Squadron. The Squadron's return in November 1980 concluded the largest and longest RAN deployment since World War II.

Following her return, the carrier spent six months in Australian waters, before a two-month deployment to Southeast Asia. During this deployment, on 21 June 1981, "Melbourne" rescued 99 Vietnamese refugees from a disabled fishing vessel in the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a>. The carrier's deployments for the second half of the year consisted of two exercises, Sea Hawk and Kangaroo 81. A major refit scheduled to begin in late 1981 was postponed pending the <a href="%23Replacement">decision on a replacement carrier</a>. After docking at Garden Island in December, the carrier was accidentally flooded by an officer who was impatient to commence leave. In his haste to shut down the carrier, he failed to deactivate the water pumps, and over 180 tons of fresh water were pumped in before a maintenance party discovered the flooding the next day. "Melbourne" remained in dock at the start of 1982, and did not leave before the decision regarding her replacement was made.

A replacement for "Melbourne" was under consideration as early as 1956, and the question was revisited on several occasions until the 1980s. In every situation, a new aircraft carrier was turned down due to the increases in manpower and operating costs required to operate the ship when compared to "Melbourne".

Between 1956 and 1959, the RAN considered acquiring a larger carrier to replace "Melbourne", as the Fleet Air Arm was becoming obsolete and the RAN did not believe the ship could be modified to operate newer, heavier aircraft. Under consideration were British carrier and a ship of the United States' <a href="Essex-class%20aircraft%20carrier">"Essex" class</a>. Both options were turned down, and it was instead proposed to operate "Melbourne" as a helicopter carrier.

In 1960, the United States Navy offered an "Essex"-class carrier to the Australian government, in the interest of improving relations between the two nations and their navies. The only cost to the RAN would have been the modifications required to make the carrier operationally compatible with the RAN's primarily British-designed fleet. In the late 1960s, the British made a similar offer, following a 1966 review indicating that was a superfluous naval unit. In 1968, "Hermes" took part in a combined exercise with the RAN, during which the carrier was visited by RAN and Australian government officials, while RAN <a href="A-4%20Skyhawk">Skyhawks</a> and <a href="S-2%20Tracker">Trackers</a> practised landings on the larger carrier. Both offers were turned down due to operating and manpower costs.

The need to secure a replacement for "Melbourne" grew as the carrier's age caused the operating costs to increase to over A$25 million per year. In June 1977, the Defence Force Development Committee approved an investigation into acquiring a <a href="STOVL">STOVL</a>/helicopter carrier. By August 1979, the decision was limited to three ships: a modified American <a href="Iwo%20Jima-class%20amphibious%20assault%20ship">"Iwo Jima"-class amphibious assault ship</a>, an Italian <a href="Italian%20aircraft%20carrier%20Giuseppe%20Garibaldi%20%28551%29">"Giuseppe Garibaldi"-class carrier</a>, and a <a href="Sea%20Control%20Ship">Sea Control Ship</a> design that later became the Spanish Navy's <a href="Spanish%20aircraft%20carrier%20Principe%20de%20Asturias">"Principe de Asturias"</a>. By February 1981, the "Iwo Jima" class was the preferred option.

Plans to replace "Melbourne" changed in July 1981; the British <a href="1981%20Defence%20White%20Paper">1981 Defence White Paper</a> had marked the recently commissioned as surplus to requirements, and she was offered to the RAN for the 'bargain' price of <a href="Pound%20sterling">GB£</a>175 million (A$285 million). The "Invincible" class had been considered and discarded during the investigation, but the decreased price and the fact the already-constructed carrier would be ready for RAN service in 1983 prompted the Australian government to announce its intention to purchase "Invincible" on 25 February 1982 and close the carrier acquisition program. The government also announced that the ship would be renamed and operated as a helicopter carrier, and that a decision on the purchase of fixed wing aircraft would be made after acquisition.

The deal was put on hold in April 1982, following the outbreak of the <a href="Falklands%20War">Falklands War</a>. The performance of "Invincible" and other Royal Navy aircraft carriers during the conflict showed that the report which suggested reductions in the size of Britain's carrier fleet—with the follow-on effect of making "Invincible" available for sale—was flawed, and both sides withdrew from the deal in July. The RAN was again offered HMS "Hermes", and again declined due to the carrier's age and manpower requirements. The Australian government began to reconsider the previous contenders for replacement, as well as considering requesting the United Kingdom or United States to build a simple carrier capable of operating <a href="F/A-18%20Hornet">F/A-18 Hornet</a> strike fighters, but the issue was suspended at the commencement of the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201983">1983 Australian Federal Election</a>. On 14 March, following the election of <a href="Bob%20Hawke">Bob Hawke</a>'s <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor Government</a>, the announcement was made that "Melbourne" would not be replaced.

Following the decision to replace "Melbourne" with HMS "Invincible", the postponed refit was cancelled outright. The Australian carrier was prepared for disposal, and was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 30 June 1982. She was towed to the <a href="dolphin%20%28structure%29">mooring dolphins</a> near <a href="Bradley%27s%20Head%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Bradley's Head</a>, where she remained until 1985. "Melbourne" was capable of being reactivated as a helicopter-equipped anti-submarine warfare carrier within 26 weeks, but was never required to do so. A Sydney-based group proposed in 1984 to purchase "Melbourne" and operate her as a floating casino moored in international waters off <a href="Eden%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Eden, New South Wales</a>, but nothing came of this. "Melbourne"s air wing was disbanded at HMAS "Albatross" on 2 July 1982, with the transfer of 805 Squadron's Skyhawks to <a href="724%20Squadron%20RAN">724 Squadron</a> and 816 Squadron being absorbed into <a href="851%20Squadron%20RAN">851 Squadron</a>. The Skyhawks remained in service as fleet support aircraft until 30 June 1984, while the Trackers were withdrawn from service on 31 August 1984 after being used as land-based maritime patrol aircraft.

The carrier was initially sold for breaking up as scrap metal for A$1.7 million, although the sale fell through in June 1984. She was sold again in February 1985 to the China United Shipbuilding Company for A$1.4 million, with the intention that she be towed to China and <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up for scrap</a>. Prior to the ship's departure for China, the RAN stripped "Melbourne" of all electronic equipment and weapons, and welded her rudders into a fixed position so that she could not be reactivated. However, her steam catapult, arresting equipment and mirror landing system were not removed. At this time, few western experts expected that the Chinese Government would attempt to develop aircraft carriers in the future. The carrier departed Sydney on 27 April 1985, heading for <a href="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>, China, under the tow of tug "De Ping". The journey was delayed when the towing line began to part, requiring the carrier and tug to shelter in <a href="Moreton%20Bay">Moreton Bay</a>, Queensland, on 30 April. The towing gear broke a day later, requiring a second tug to secure the carrier while repairs were made to "De Ping". Three days later, "Melbourne" ran aground while still in Moreton Bay. "Melbourne" finally arrived in China on 13 June. The Australian government received a <a href="Telex">Telex</a> on this day, reading: 
The ship was not scrapped immediately; instead she was studied by Chinese naval architects and engineers as part of the nation's top-secret <a href="Future%20Chinese%20aircraft%20carrier">carrier development program</a>. However, it is unclear whether the <a href="People%27s%20Liberation%20Army%20Navy">People's Liberation Army Navy</a> (PLAN) orchestrated the acquisition of "Melbourne" or simply took advantage of the situation; Rear Admiral <a href="Zhang%20Zhaozhong%20%28military%20official%29">Zhang Zhaozhong</a>, a staff member at the <a href="PLA%20National%20Defense%20University">National Defence College</a>, has stated that the Navy was unaware of the purchase until "Melbourne" first arrived at Guangzhou. "Melbourne" was the largest warship any of the Chinese experts had seen, and they were surprised by the amount of equipment which was still in place. The PLAN subsequently arranged for the ship's flight deck and all the equipment associated with flying operations to be removed so that they could be studied in depth. Reports have circulated that either a replica of the flight deck, or the deck itself, was used for clandestine training of <a href="People%27s%20Liberation%20Army%20Navy">People's Liberation Army Navy</a> pilots in carrier flight operations. It has also been claimed that the Royal Australian Navy received and "politely rejected" a request from the PLAN for blueprints of the ship's steam catapult. The carrier was not dismantled for many years; according to some rumours she was not completely broken up until 2002. A 2012 article in "Jane's Navy International" stated that the large quantity of equipment recovered from "Melbourne" "undoubtedly helped" Admiral <a href="Liu%20Huaqing">Liu Huaqing</a> secure the Chinese Government's support for his proposal to initiate a <a href="Chinese%20aircraft%20carrier%20programme">program to develop aircraft carriers</a> for the Navy.

"Melbourne"s service is commemorated with a stained-glass window at the <a href="Naval%20Chapel%2C%20Garden%20Island%20NSW">Garden Island Naval Chapel</a>. One of the ship's anchors is incorporated into a memorial to naval aviation at <a href="Nowra%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Nowra, New South Wales</a>. Another anchor and the starboard side <a href="ship%27s%20bell">ship's bell</a> are on display at the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy%20Heritage%20Centre">RAN Heritage Centre</a> at <a href="Garden%20Island%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Garden Island</a>. Memorabilia from "Melbourne"s voyages with the <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm%20%28RAN%29">Fleet Air Arm</a> embarked, and examples of all the types of aircraft deployed on "Melbourne", are on permanent static display in the <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm%20Museum%20%28Australia%29">Fleet Air Arm Museum</a> at HMAS "Albatross".

Following an overhaul of the RAN <a href="battle%20honour">battle honour</a>s system completed in 2010, "Melbourne" was retroactively awarded the honour "Malaysia 1965–66" for her service during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation.

Courageous-class aircraft carrier

The Courageous" class, sometimes called the Glorious" class, was the first multi-ship class of <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s to serve with the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. The three ships—, and —were originally laid down as <a href="Courageous-class%20battlecruiser">Courageous-class battlecruiser</a>s as part of the <a href="Baltic%20Project">Baltic Project</a> during the <a href="Naval%20warfare%20of%20World%20War%20I">First World War</a>. While very fast, their minimal armour and few guns limited their long-term utility in the post-war Royal Navy, and they were <a href="Reserve%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">laid up</a> after the war. They were considered <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s by the terms of the 1922 <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> and were included in the total amount of tonnage allowed to the Royal Navy. Rather than <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a> them, the Navy decided to convert them to aircraft carriers as permitted under the Treaty.

"Furious", already partially converted during the war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In an attempt to minimize air turbulence, she was given no <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> or <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23I">island</a>. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a>; instead, her <a href="boiler">boiler</a> uptakes ran along the sides of the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a>, or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases were as much of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her <a href="sister%20ship">half-sisters</a>, "Courageous" and "Glorious", began their conversions to aircraft carriers as "Furious" neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since "Furious" had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.

As the first large carrier completed by the Royal Navy, "Furious" was extensively used to evaluate aircraft handling and landing procedures, including the first-ever carrier night landing in 1926. "Courageous" became the first warship lost by the Royal Navy in the Second World War when she was <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>ed in September 1939 by a German <a href="U-boat">submarine</a>. "Glorious" participated in the <a href="Norwegian%20Campaign">Norwegian Campaign</a> in 1940, but she was sunk by two German <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s in June as she sailed home with minimal escort. "Furious" participated in many major operations during the war, including the <a href="Norwegian%20Campaign">Norwegian Campaign</a> in 1940, the <a href="Malta%20Convoys">Malta Convoys</a> and "<a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a>" in 1942, and air strikes on the and other targets in Norway in 1944. The ship was worn out by 1944 and was placed in <a href="Reserve%20fleet">reserve</a> status in September 1944 before being <a href="Ship%20commissioning%23Ship%20decommissioning">paid off</a> in 1945 and sold for <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a> in 1948.

The first two ships of the class, "Courageous" and "Glorious", spent the First World War on <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> patrols, climaxing in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20Bight">Second Battle of Heligoland Bight</a> in November 1917. Their half-sister "Furious" was designed with a pair of guns—as opposed to four —but was modified while being built to hold a flying-off deck and <a href="hangar">hangar</a> in lieu of her forward <a href="gun%20turret">turret</a> and <a href="barbette">barbette</a>. She made some patrols in the North Sea before her rear turret was removed and another flight deck added. Her aircraft attacked <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> sheds during the <a href="Tondern%20raid">Tondern raid</a> in July 1918.

All three ships were reduced to reserve after the war. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the signatory nations to a set amount of capital ship tonnage; all ships in excess of this figure had to be scrapped. Up to of existing ships could be converted into aircraft carriers, and the Royal Navy decided to use the "Courageous"-class ships due to their high speed. Each ship was reconstructed with a flight deck during the 1920s.

 had been fitted during the First World War with a flying-off and landing deck, but the latter proved largely unusable because of the strong air currents around the superstructure and exhaust gases from the funnel. She was laid up after the war, but was converted to an aircraft carrier between June 1921 and September 1925. Her design was based on the very limited experience gained with the first two British carriers: , less than three years old, and , which had carried out only 143 deck landings during preliminary <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s in 1920.

"Furious"s superstructure, masts, funnel and landing deck were removed and she was given a flight deck that extended over three-quarters of her length. This flight deck was not level; it sloped upwards about three-quarters of the way from the stern to help slow down landing aircraft, which had no brakes at the time it was designed. That era's fore-and-aft <a href="arresting%20gear">arresting gear</a>, initially long on "Furious", was not intended to stop landing aircraft—the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind—but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck. Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the <a href="National%20Physical%20Laboratory%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Physical Laboratory</a> which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges minimised turbulence. To minimise any turbulence over the flight deck, "Furious" was flush-decked and lacked an island, like "Argus"; instead she was provided with a retractable <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23C">charthouse</a> at the forward end of the flight deck.

A two-level hangar was built under the flight deck, each level being high. The lower hangar was long by wide and the upper was . Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted down the side of the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck, or, when landing operations were in progress, out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a> so that the ship could simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck and could speedily launch her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck. Two lifts (elevators) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars. Two ready-use <a href="petrol">petrol</a> tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship's boats on the upper deck. An additional of petrol were in bulk storage. The longitudinal arresting gear proved unpopular in service and it was ordered removed in 1927 after tests aboard "Furious" in 1926 had shown that deck-edge palisades were effective in reducing cross-deck gusts that could blow aircraft over the side. "Furious"s long exhaust ducting hampered landing operations, and restricted the size of the hangars and thus the number of aircraft that she could carry.
"Glorious" and "Courageous" were converted to aircraft carriers after "Furious" began her reconstruction, "Courageous" at <a href="HMNB%20Devonport">Devonport</a> starting on 29 June 1924, and "Glorious" at <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a> on 14 February 1924. The latter was moved to Devonport to complete the conversion after "Furious" was finished. Their design was based on "Furious" with a few improvements based on experience gained since she was designed. All superstructure, guns, and fittings down to the main deck were removed. A two-storey hangar, each level high and long, was built on top of the remaining hull; the upper hangar level opened onto a short flying-off deck, below and forward of the main flight deck. Two slightly larger lifts were installed fore and aft in the flight deck. An island was added on the starboard side with the bridge, flying control station, and funnel, as an island did not create as much turbulence as had been earlier feared. By 1939 both ships could carry of petrol.

The "Courageous"-class ships had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. These were increases of in beam and over in draught compared to their earlier incarnations as battlecruisers. They displaced at normal load and at deep load, increases of over . Their <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a> declined from at deep load to and the ships had a complete <a href="double%20bottom">double bottom</a>. In 1939, "Courageous" had a complement of 807 officers and enlisted men, plus 403 men in her air group.

Their half-sister "Furious" was the same length, but had a beam of , and an average draught of at deep load, two feet deeper than before the conversion. She displaced at normal load and at deep load, over 3,000 long tons more than her previous displacement of at load and at deep load. "Furious"s metacentric height was at deep load, a reduction of after her conversion. In 1932, "Furious" had a complement of 738 officers and enlisted men, plus 468 men in her air group.

The "Courageous"-class ships were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s. Arranged in two engine rooms, each of the turbines drove one of the four propeller shafts. "Furious"s propellers were in diameter. The turbines were powered by 18 <a href="Yarrow%20Shipbuilders">Yarrow</a> small-tube boilers equally divided among three boiler rooms. The turbines were designed to produce a total of at a working pressure of . No significant changes to the machinery were made during the conversion process to any of the three ships, but their increased displacement reduced their speed to approximately .

"Furious"s fuel capacity was increased by during her reconstruction, which increased her range to at a speed of . The maximum fuel capacity of "Courageous" and "Glorious" was increased during the conversion to of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, giving them an endurance of at 10 knots.

"Furious" retained ten of her original eleven <a href="breech-loading">breech-loading</a> <a href="BL%205.5%20inch%20Mark%20I%20naval%20gun">BL 5.5-inch Mk I</a> guns, five on each side, for self-defence from enemy warships. They fired projectiles at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of . Their maximum range was at their maximum elevation of 25°, and the rate of fire was 12 rounds per minute.

Half a dozen <a href="QF%204%20inch%20Mk%20V%20naval%20gun">QF 4-inch Mark V</a> guns replaced her original <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> guns. Four were mounted on the sides of the flying-off deck and two on the <a href="quarterdeck">quarterdeck</a>. They had a maximum depression of −5° and a maximum elevation of 80°. The guns fired a <a href="Explosive%20material%23High%20explosives">high explosive</a> (HE) shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of 10 to 15 rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of , but an effective range of much less. The four guns on the flying-off deck were removed during trials of the lower flight deck in 1926–1927, but only two were replaced when the trials were concluded.

Four single <a href="QF%202%20pounder%20naval%20gun">QF 2-pounder "pom-poms"</a> were installed by 1927. During "Furious"s September 1930 – February 1932 refit, her anti-aircraft outfit was changed by the substitution of two eight-barrel 2-pounder "pom-pom" mounts for the forward 4-inch guns on the flying-off deck removed earlier. The Mark V mount could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of 80°. The Mark VIII 2-pounder gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a distance of . The gun's rate of fire was approximately 96–98 rounds per minute.

The and guns were replaced during "Furious"s refit in early 1939 by a dozen <a href="QF%204%20inch%20Mk%20XVI%20naval%20gun">QF 4-inch Mk XVI guns</a> in twin <a href="dual%20purpose%20gun">dual-purpose</a> Mark XIX mounts. One mount each was on the former flying-off deck and the quarterdeck while the other four were mounted two per side. The Mark XIX mount could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of 80°. The Mark XVI gun fired 15–20 HE shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of . Against surface targets it had a range of and a maximum ceiling of , but an effective anti-aircraft range of much less. Two more Mark V 2-pounder mounts were added fore and aft of the newly added island at the same time.

During the Second World War, "Furious", the only surviving ship of the three, received an eventual total of 22 manually operated automatic <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">20 mm Oerlikon</a> light anti-aircraft (AA) guns, which replaced the single quadruple Vickers .50-calibre machine gun mount. The Oerlikon fired a HE shell at a muzzle velocity of . The maximum ceiling was 10,000 feet and the maximum range was although the effective range was under . The cyclic rate of fire was 450 rounds per minute, but the practical rate was between 250 and 320 rounds per minute owing to the need to reload <a href="magazine%20%28firearms%29">magazines</a>.

A mix of single-purpose anti-surface and anti-aircraft guns in various sizes was considered for "Courageous" and "Glorious" by the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a>, but was ultimately rejected for a dual-purpose armament of sixteen <a href="QF%204.7%20inch%20Mk%20VIII%20naval%20gun">QF 4.7-inch Mark VIII</a> guns in single high-angle mounts. One mount was on each side of the lower flight deck and a pair were on the quarterdeck. The remaining twelve mounts were distributed along the sides of each ship. These mounts could depress to −5° and elevate to a maximum of 90°. The Mark VIII guns fired a HE shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of eight to twelve rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of , but an effective range of much less. They had a maximum range of against surface targets.

During refits in the mid-1930s, both ships received multiple 2-pounder "pom-pom" mounts. "Courageous" received three quadruple Mark VII mounts, one on each side of the flying-off deck, forward of the 4.7-inch guns, and one behind the island on the flight deck (two of these were transferred from the battleship ). "Glorious" received three octuple Mark VI mounts in the same locations. Both ships received four water-cooled <a href="Vickers%20.50%20machine%20gun">.50-calibre Mark III</a> <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s in a single quadruple mounting. This mount could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of 70°. The machine guns fired a bullet at a muzzle velocity of . This gave the gun a maximum range of about , although its effective range was only . Neither ship had any further guns added before they were sunk early in the war, in 1939 and 1940, respectively.

To assist its weapon systems in hitting their target, "Furious" was completed with one <a href="fire-control%20system">fire-control system</a> for each side, with separate <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">directors</a> for low-angle and high-angle guns. The 5.5-inch guns were centrally controlled by a <a href="Frederic%20Charles%20Dreyer%23Dreyer%20Fire%20Control%20Table">Dreyer Fire-Control Table</a> on the lower deck while the 4-inch guns had their mechanical computers next to their directors. The existing fire-control directors were removed when "Furious" received her new dual-purpose 4-inch mountings in 1939. New high-angle directors, including two for the "pom-poms", were mounted on top of the new island and on the former lower flight deck. Over the course of the war <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20285">Type 285</a> gunnery <a href="radar">radar</a>s were mounted on top of the high-angle directors. She also received a <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20290">Type 290</a> air-search radar.

"Courageous" was initially fitted only with low-angle directors for her guns, but these were replaced by dual-purpose directors when she was refitted in 1930. ("Glorious", completed later, had hers from the beginning.) Neither ship was fitted with radar before its early loss.

Little armour other than that of the <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s was removed during their conversion to aircraft carriers. The transverse bulkheads were carried through the locations of the former barbettes. The flight deck was in thickness.

Unlike other British battlecruisers, the bulk of the armour of the "Courageous"-class ships was made from <a href="Ultimate%20tensile%20strength">high-tensile</a> steel (HTS), a type of steel used structurally in other ships. Their waterline <a href="Belt%20armor">belt</a> consisted of of HTS covered by a thick mild steel skin. It protected roughly the middle two-thirds of the ship with a one-inch extension forward to the two-inch forward transverse <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a> well short of the bow. The belt had a height of , of which was below the designed waterline. From the former forward barbette, a three-inch bulkhead extended out to the ship's side between the upper and lower decks and a comparable bulkhead was in place at the former location of the rear barbette as well. Four decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from , thickest over the magazines and the steering gear. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a>, of extra protection was added to the deck around the magazines.

The <a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a>s were increased during building from to in thickness. All three ships were fitted with a shallow <a href="anti-torpedo%20bulge">anti-torpedo bulge</a> integral to the hull, which was intended to detonate the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and deflect the underwater explosion to the surface, away from the ship. Later testing proved that it was not deep enough to accomplish its task and that it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion.

Normally, "Furious" could carry only about 36 aircraft. In the 1920s this commonly meant one flight (squadrons after 1932) of fighters (<a href="Fairey%20Flycatcher">Fairey Flycatcher</a>), two of spotters (<a href="Blackburn%20Blackburn">Blackburn Blackburn</a> or <a href="Avro%20Bison">Avro Bison</a>), one spotter reconnaissance (<a href="Fairey%20III">Fairey III</a>D) and two flights of torpedo bombers (<a href="Blackburn%20Dart">Blackburn Dart</a>). In 1935 there was one squadron of fighters with <a href="Hawker%20Nimrod">Hawker Nimrod</a>s and <a href="Hawker%20Osprey">Hawker Osprey</a>s, one squadron of <a href="Blackburn%20Baffin">Blackburn Baffin</a> torpedo bombers and one squadron of Fairey IIIF spotters. During the Second World War, the carrier typically carried a single fighter squadron and two of strike aircraft of various types, although the mix was often adjusted for specific missions.

"Courageous" and "Glorious" were generally similar except that they carried a total of 48 aircraft. They commonly flew the same types of aircraft as "Furious", although they are also known to have flown the <a href="Fairey%20Seal">Fairey Seal</a>, the <a href="Blackburn%20Shark">Blackburn Shark</a>, and the <a href="Blackburn%20Ripon">Blackburn Ripon</a>.

"Furious" was assigned to the <a href="Atlantic%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Atlantic Fleet</a> after commissioning in 1925, although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a> (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily. The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge <a href="palisade">palisade</a>s (<a href="windbreak">windbreak</a>s) were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather. The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard "Furious".

The ship was reduced to reserve status on 1 July 1930 in preparation for a lengthy overhaul at Devonport from September 1930 to February 1932, focused on refitting her machinery and re-tubing her boilers. In addition her quarterdeck was raised by one deck, the AA armament was revised and water spraying facilities were fitted in the hangars. Upon completion she ran a full-power trial on 16 February 1932 where her maximum speed was from a total of .

"Furious" was recommissioned in May 1932 as part of the Home Fleet with a reduced crew before being brought up to full complement in November. Transverse arresting gear was fitted sometime during the mid-1930s. She was detached to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet">Mediterranean Fleet</a> from May to October 1934. "Furious" was present at the Coronation <a href="Fleet%20Review">Fleet Review</a> at <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a> on 20 May 1937 for King <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a>. She became a deck-landing training carrier in 1937, although she was refitted between December 1937 and May 1938 in Devonport, where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward. During the <a href="Munich%20Crisis">Munich Crisis</a> in September 1938, she embarked Nos. <a href="801%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">801</a>, <a href="821%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">821</a> and <a href="822%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">822 Squadrons</a> and joined the fleet at <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>, before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair.

She was given a more extensive refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted AA guns on her flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, and gave her a small island on the starboard side. "Furious" resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939.
"Courageous" was recommissioned on 21 February 1928 and assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet from May 1928 to June 1930. She was relieved by "Glorious" and refitted from June to August 1930. The ship was assigned to the Atlantic and Home Fleets from 12 August 1930 to December 1938 aside from a temporary attachment to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1936. In the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed and she received two hydraulic <a href="aircraft%20catapult">catapults</a> on the upper flight deck before March 1934. "Courageous" was refitted again between October 1935 and June 1936 and received her "pom-pom" mounts. She was also present at the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review. She became a training carrier in December 1938 when joined the Home Fleet and continued on that duty until the start of the Second World War.
"Glorious" was recommissioned on 24 February 1930 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet, but was attached to the Home Fleet from March to June 1930. She relieved "Courageous" in the Mediterranean Fleet in June 1930 and remained there until October 1939. In a fog on 1 April 1931 "Glorious" rammed SS "Florida" amidships while steaming at . The impact crumpled of the flying-off deck and forced "Glorious" to put into <a href="Gibdock">Gibraltar</a> for temporary repairs. She had to sail to <a href="Malta%20Dockyard">Malta</a> for permanent repairs which lasted until September 1931. Sometime in the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed. She was refitted at Devonport from July 1934 to July 1935 where she received two catapults, her flight deck was extended to the rear, her quarterdeck was raised one deck and she received her multiple "pom-pom" mounts. "Glorious" also participated in the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review before returning to the Mediterranean.

In the early days of the war, <a href="Hunter-killer%20Group">hunter-killer groups</a> were formed around the fleet aircraft carriers to find and destroy U-boats. On 17 September 1939, two torpedoes from turned the tables, and "Courageous" became the first British warship sunk in the Second World War. As "Ark Royal" had been surprised by a near miss seven days earlier, the fleet carriers were withdrawn from this duty.

Force J, including "Glorious", was organised to hunt for the in the Indian Ocean. They were not successful, and "Glorious" remained in the Indian Ocean until December when she was transferred to the Mediterranean.

"Glorious" was recalled to the Home Fleet in April 1940 to provide air cover for British forces landing in <a href="Norwegian%20Campaign">Norway</a>. <a href="Gloster%20Gladiators">Gloster Gladiators</a> of <a href="No.%20263%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 263 Squadron RAF</a> were flown aboard to be transferred to Norwegian airbases. "Glorious" and "Ark Royal" arrived off central Norway on 24 April where 263 Squadron was flown off and their organic aircraft attacked targets in the <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a> area before "Glorious" had to return to Scapa Flow on 27 April to refuel and embark new aircraft. She returned on 1 May, after failing to load new aircraft because of poor weather. The task force was under heavy air attack by the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> all day and was withdrawn that evening.

"Glorious" returned on 18 May with six <a href="Supermarine%20Walrus">Supermarine Walrus</a> <a href="Amphibious%20aircraft">amphibious</a> <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a>s of <a href="701%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">701 Squadron</a> and 18 <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a>s of <a href="No.%2046%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 46 Squadron RAF</a>. The Walruses were flown off to <a href="Harstad">Harstad</a>, but the airfield at <a href="Sk%C3%A5nland">Skånland</a> was not yet ready for the Hurricanes and they were still aboard when "Glorious" returned to Scapa on 21 May. "Glorious" came back to the <a href="Narvik">Narvik</a> area on 26 May and the Hurricanes were flown off.

British forces were ordered withdrawn a few days later. The evacuation ("<a href="Operation%20Alphabet">Operation Alphabet</a>") began in the north on the night of 3/4 June, and "Glorious" arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support. She carried only nine Sea Gladiators of <a href="802%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">802 Squadron</a> and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of <a href="823%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">823 Squadron</a> for self-defence, as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes. This was the first time that high performance monoplanes without <a href="tailhook">tailhook</a>s had been landed on an aircraft carrier.

Captain <a href="Guy%20D%27Oyly-Hughes">Guy D'Oyly-Hughes</a> requested and was granted permission to proceed independently to Scapa Flow in the early hours of 8 June. On the way back across the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, "Glorious" and her two escorting destroyers, and , were found by the two German battleships and . No <a href="combat%20air%20patrol">combat air patrol</a> was being flown, no aircraft were spotted on the deck for quick take off and there was no lookout in the <a href="crow%27s%20nest">crow's nest</a>. The German heavy ships sank all three British vessels with most of their crews, although "Acasta" managed to torpedo "Scharnhorst" before she was sunk. Only 43 men from "Glorious" survived.

Until 2 October 1939, "Furious" remained on training duties, combined with anti-submarine sweeps off the east coast of Scotland. She was then assigned to the Home Fleet to replace the sunken "Courageous" and sortied on 8 October with the fleet to hunt unsuccessfully for the "Gneisenau" and escorting ships which had been spotted off southern Norway. "Furious" departed her berth adjacent to the battleship in Scapa Flow for more futile searches for German ships on 13 October, the day before "Royal Oak" was sunk by in Scapa Flow. "Furious" served as the flagship for the convoy bringing most of the <a href="1st%20Canadian%20Infantry%20Division">1st Canadian Infantry Division</a> to Britain in mid-December 1939.

"Furious" joined the Home Fleet off the coast of Norway on 10 April 1940 and her Swordfish made several attacks on German ships in Narvik on the following days. She refuelled at <a href="Troms%C3%B8">Tromsø</a> on the 14th and remained behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April, her aircraft flying reconnaissance missions until ordered home on 25 April. Her port inner turbine had been damaged by the shock wave from a near miss on 18 April, and the damage was more serious than initially thought. After quick repairs, "Furious" returned on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed 263 Squadron; they were flown off on 21 May once their base at <a href="Bardufoss%20Air%20Station">Bardufoss</a> was ready. She sailed to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off.

On 14 June, carrying only half of <a href="816%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">816 Squadron</a> for her own protection, "Furious" sailed unescorted for <a href="Halifax%20Regional%20Municipality">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a> carrying £18,000,000 in gold <a href="bullion">bullion</a>. On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft, spare parts and munitions. On his own initiative, Captain <a href="Thomas%20Hope%20Troubridge">Troubridge</a> ordered all available space should be used for sugar bound for Britain. She reembarked her aircraft upon her arrival and made a number of air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the seaplane base at Tromsø through October 1940. "Furious" loaded 55 aircraft in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> on 7 November and sailed for <a href="Takoradi">Takoradi</a>, <a href="Gold%20Coast%20%28British%20colony%29">Gold Coast</a>, on 15 November where the aircraft were flown off on 27 November to reinforce fighter units defending <a href="Desert%20Air%20Force">Egypt</a>. By 15 December, "Furious" was back in Liverpool, where she embarked 40 Hurricanes for Takoradi. She sailed on 21 December and joined up with <a href="Convoy%20WS%205A">Convoy WS 5A</a> which encountered the on 25 December. The German ship was driven off by the escorts, and "Furious" reached Takoradi on 10 January 1941. She arrived in Britain on 5 February where she was given a brief refit. She made another ferry trip to Takoradi between 4 and 22 March.

Now with a new destination for her ferry trips, "Furious" transported two dozen Hurricanes to Gibraltar on 25 April where they were transferred to "Ark Royal" to be flown off for <a href="Siege%20of%20Malta%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Malta</a>. She returned for another load of Hurricanes and arrived back in Gibraltar on 18 May. Some of these fighters were moved to "Ark Royal" via planks between the flight decks of the carriers berthed stern to stern. This time she accompanied "Ark Royal" and the two carriers flew off their fighters from a position south of Sardinia. She would repeat this ferry mission three more times from June to September 1941. In July and August, "Furious" and attacked German installations in the Arctic areas of Norway and Finland with limited success and heavy losses. Following her last ferry mission she was sent to <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, Pennsylvania, to refit.

"Furious" arrived back in the UK in April 1942 and spent the next three months <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23W">working up</a>. In August she was detailed to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in <a href="Operation%20Pedestal">Operation Pedestal</a>, but she was to sail with them only far enough to allow her 38 <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>s to reach Malta. This she did, just as "Eagle" was torpedoed, but "Furious" turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully. She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day south-east of the <a href="Balearic%20Islands">Balearic Islands</a>. After this mission "Furious" was sent back to Home Fleet for training. One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before <a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a>, and she arrived on 27 October. She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on the 29th before returning to Gibraltar to participate in Torch.

Providing cover for the Central Task Force, "Furious"s aircraft neutralised the airfields at <a href="Es%20S%C3%A9nia">La Senia</a> and <a href="Tafraoui">Tafraoui</a>, both near <a href="Oran">Oran</a>, Algeria. She remained with Force H until February 1943 before transferring to Home Fleet where she remained for the rest of the war. In July the Home Fleet demonstrated off the coast of Norway in strength to distract attention from the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a>; "Furious"s role was to allow a German reconnaissance aircraft to spot the British ships and make a report then shoot it down. She was refitted in August and spent the rest of the year training.

On 3 April 1944, <a href="Fairey%20Barracuda">Fairey Barracuda</a>s from "Furious" and "Victorious" attacked the German battleship "Tirpitz" in <a href="Altafjord">Altafjord</a>, Norway, as part of <a href="Operation%20Tungsten">Operation Tungsten</a>. "Tirpitz" was hit 14 times and needed three months to complete her repairs, although four aircraft were lost in the attack. The Home Fleet tried another attack on "Tirpitz" later in the month, but bad weather prevented any attack from being made. Instead the aircraft attempted to attack installations at <a href="Bod%C3%B8">Bodø</a>, but found a German convoy instead and sank three ships. Three operations against targets in northern Norway, including two against "Tirpitz", had to be abandoned or diverted to other targets in May, but three German ships were sunk and two more were set afire. "Furious" and other carriers made another attempt to sink the "Tirpitz" on 17 July, but were unsuccessful against the fully alerted German defences. Four more attacks on "Tirpitz" were made in August, but only the attack on the 24th was even partially successful as two minor hits were made.

As the war progressed, the ship's age and limitations became increasingly apparent, and "Furious" was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944. She was <a href="paid%20off">paid off</a> in April 1945 and used to evaluate the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship's structure. She was sold in 1948 for scrap, which was completed in 1954 at <a href="Troon">Troon</a>.

HMS Royal Oak (08)

HMS "Royal Oak" was one of five s built for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. Launched in 1914 and completed in 1916, "Royal Oak" first saw combat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> as part of the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>. In peacetime, she served in the <a href="Atlantic%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Atlantic</a>, <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home</a> and <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Mediterranean</a> fleets, more than once coming under accidental attack. The ship drew worldwide attention in 1928 when her senior officers were controversially <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>led. Attempts to modernise "Royal Oak" throughout her 25-year career could not fix her fundamental lack of speed and by the start of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, she was no longer suited to front-line duty.

On 14 October 1939, "Royal Oak" was anchored at <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> in Orkney, Scotland, when she was torpedoed by the German <a href="submarine">submarine</a> . Of "Royal Oak"s complement of 1,234 men and boys, 833 were killed that night or died later of their wounds. The loss of the outdated ship—the first of the five Royal Navy battleships and <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s sunk in the Second World War—did little to affect the numerical superiority enjoyed by the British navy and its <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a>, but the sinking had considerable effect on wartime morale. The raid made an immediate celebrity and <a href="war%20hero">war hero</a> out of the U-boat commander, <a href="G%C3%BCnther%20Prien">Günther Prien</a>, who became the first German submarine officer to be awarded the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a>. Before the sinking of "Royal Oak", the Royal Navy had considered the naval base at Scapa Flow impregnable to submarine attack, and "U-47"s raid demonstrated that the German Navy was capable of bringing the war to British home waters. The shock resulted in rapid changes to dockland security and the construction of the <a href="Churchill%20Barriers">Churchill Barriers</a> around Scapa Flow.

The wreck of "Royal Oak", a designated <a href="war%20grave">war grave</a>, lies almost upside down in of water with her hull beneath the surface. In an annual ceremony to mark the loss of the ship, Royal Navy divers place a <a href="White%20Ensign">White Ensign</a> underwater at her stern. Unauthorised divers are prohibited from approaching the wreck at any time under the <a href="Protection%20of%20Military%20Remains%20Act%201986">Protection of Military Remains Act 1986</a>.

The "Revenge"-class ships were designed as slightly smaller, slower, and more heavily protected versions of the preceding s. As an economy measure they were intended to revert to the previous practice of using both <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> and coal, but <a href="First%20Sea%20Lord">First Sea Lord</a> <a href="John%20Fisher%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fisher">Jackie Fisher</a> rescinded the decision for coal in October 1914. Still under construction, the ships were redesigned to employ oil-fired <a href="boiler">boiler</a>s that increased the power of the engines by over the original specification.

"Royal Oak" had a <a href="length%20overall">length overall</a> of , a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a deep <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . She had a designed displacement of and displaced at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. She was powered by two sets of <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each driving two shafts, using steam from 18 <a href="Yarrow%20boiler">Yarrow boiler</a>s. The turbines were rated at and intended to reach a maximum speed of . During her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s on 22 May 1916, the ship only reached a top speed of from . She had a range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 909 officers and enlisted men in 1916.

The "Revenge" class was equipped with eight <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23BL">breech-loading</a> (BL) <a href="BL%2015%20inch%20Mk%20I%20naval%20gun">Mk I</a> guns in four twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, in two <a href="superfire">superfiring pairs</a> fore and aft of the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. Twelve of the fourteen <a href="BL%206%20inch%20Mk%20XII%20naval%20gun">BL Mk XII</a> guns were mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s along the <a href="broadside">broadside</a> of the vessel <a href="amidships">amidships</a>; the remaining pair were mounted on the shelter deck and were protected by <a href="gun%20shield">gun shield</a>s. Their <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft</a> (AA) armament consisted of two <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing (QF)</a> <a href="QF%203%20inch%2020%20cwt">20 cwt Mk I</a> guns. The ships were fitted with four submerged <a href="British%2021%20inch%20torpedo">21-inch (533 mm)</a> <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, two on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>.

"Royal Oak" was completed with two <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control director</a>s fitted with <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>s. One was mounted above the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a>, protected by an armoured hood, and the other was in the <a href="Top%20%28sailing%20ship%29">spotting top</a> above the tripod <a href="foremast">foremast</a>. Each turret was also fitted with a 15-foot rangefinder. The main armament could be controlled by 'X' turret as well. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the compass platform on the foremast once they were fitted in March 1917. A torpedo-control director with a 15-foot rangefinder was mounted at the aft end of the superstructure.

The ship's <a href="Belt%20armor">waterline belt</a> consisted of <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armour">Krupp cemented armour</a> (KC) that was thick between 'A' and 'Y' <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s and thinned to 4 to 6 inches (102 to 152 mm) towards the ship's ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. Above this was a <a href="strake">strake</a> of armour 6 inches thick that extended between 'A' and 'X' barbettes. Transverse <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>s 4 to 6 inches thick ran at an angle from the ends of the thickest part of the waterline belt to 'A' and 'Y' barbettes. The gun turrets were protected by of KC armour, except for the turret roofs which were thick. The barbettes ranged in thickness from above the upper deck, but were only 4 to 6 inches thick below it. The "Revenge"-class ships had multiple armoured decks that ranged from in thickness. The main <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> had 13 inches of armour on the sides with a 3-inch roof. The torpedo director in the rear superstructure had 6 inches of armour protecting it. After the Battle of Jutland, 1 inch of high-tensile steel was added to the main deck over the <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s and additional anti-flash equipment was added in the magazines.

The ship was fitted with <a href="Flight%20deck%23Early%20flight%20decks">flying-off platforms</a> mounted on the roofs of 'B' and 'X' turrets in 1918, from which fighters and <a href="reconnaissance%20aircraft">reconnaissance aircraft</a> could launch. In 1934 the platforms were removed from the turrets and a <a href="aircraft%20catapult">catapult</a> was installed on the roof of 'X' turret, along with a <a href="crane%20%28machine%29">crane</a> to recover a <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a>.

"Royal Oak" was extensively refitted between 1922 and 1924, when her anti-aircraft defences were upgraded by replacing the original three-inch AA guns with a pair of <a href="QF%204%20inch%20Mk%20V%20naval%20gun">QF Mk V</a> AA guns. A rangefinder was fitted in 'B' turret and a simple high-angle rangefinder was added above the bridge. Underwater protection improved by the addition of <a href="anti-torpedo%20bulge">anti-torpedo bulge</a>s. They were designed to reduce the effect of torpedo detonations and improve stability at the cost of widening the ship's beam by over 13 feet (4 m). They increased her beam to , reduced her draught to , increased her metacentric height to at deep load, and all of the changes to her equipment increased her crew to a total of 1,188. Despite the bulges she was able to reach a speed of . A brief refit in early 1927 saw the addition of two more four-inch AA guns and the removal of the six-inch guns from the shelter deck. About 1931, a <a href="HACS">High-Angle Control System (HACS)</a> Mk I director replaced the high-angle rangefinder on the spotting top. Two years later, the aft pair of torpedo tubes were removed.

The ship received a final refit between 1934 and 1936, when her deck armour was increased to 5 inches (12.7 cm) over the <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and to 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) over the engine rooms. In addition to a general modernisation of the ship's systems, her anti-aircraft defences were strengthened by replacing the single mounts of the AA guns with twin mounts for the <a href="QF%204%20inch%20Mk%20XVI%20naval%20gun">QF 4-inch Mark XVI gun</a> and adding a pair of octuple mounts for <a href="QF%202%20pounder%20naval%20gun%23QF%202-pounder%20Mark%20VIII">two-pounder Mk VIII "pom-pom"</a> guns to <a href="sponson">sponson</a>s abreast the funnel. Two positions for "pom-pom" anti-aircraft directors were added on new platforms abreast and below the fire-control director in the spotting top. A HACS Mk III director replaced the Mk I in the spotting top and another replaced the torpedo director aft. A pair of quadruple mounts for <a href="Vickers%20.50%20machine%20gun">Vickers .50 machine gun</a>s were added abreast the conning tower. The <a href="mainmast">mainmast</a> was reconstructed as a tripod to support the weight of a <a href="Radio%20direction%20finder">radio-direction finding</a> office and a second High-Angle Control Station. The forward pair of submerged torpedo tubes were removed and four experimental 21-inch torpedo tubes were added above water forward of 'A' turret.

"Royal Oak" was <a href="Keel%20laying">laid down</a> at <a href="HMNB%20Devonport">Devonport Royal Dockyard</a> on 15 January 1914. She was <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 17 November, and after fitting-out, was commissioned on 1 May 1916 at a final cost of <a href="GBP">£</a>2,468,269. Named after <a href="Royal%20Oak">the oak tree</a> in which <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> hid following his defeat at the 1651 <a href="Battle%20of%20Worcester">Battle of Worcester</a>, she was the eighth vessel to bear <a href="HMS%20Royal%20Oak">the name "Royal Oak"</a>, replacing a <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> scrapped in 1914. Upon completion "Royal Oak" was assigned to the Third Division of the <a href="4th%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Fourth Battle Squadron</a> of the Grand Fleet, under the command of <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Crawford%20Maclachlan">Crawford Maclachlan</a>.

In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the German High Seas Fleet, composed of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 pre-dreadnoughts, 6 light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats, departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy's <a href="Room%2040">Room 40</a> had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. The Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. The initial action was fought primarily by the British and German battlecruiser formations in the afternoon, but by 18:00, the Grand Fleet approached the scene. Fifteen minutes later, Jellicoe gave the order to turn and deploy the fleet for action.

The German cruiser had become disabled by British shellfire, and both sides concentrated in the area, the Germans trying to protect their cruiser and the British attempting to sink her. At 18:29, "Royal Oak" opened fire on the German cruiser, firing four <a href="salvo">salvo</a>es from her main guns in quick succession, along with her secondary battery. She scored a hit on "Wiesbaden" aft with her third salvo. In return, "Royal Oak" was straddled by a German salvo at 18:33 but was undamaged. German <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s attempted to reach "Wiesbaden" shortly after 19:00, and at 19:07, "Royal Oak"s secondary guns opened fire on them, believing they were instead trying to launch a torpedo attack. By 19:15, "Royal Oak" gunners had observed the German battlecruiser squadron and opened fire at the leading vessel, . The gunners overestimated the range initially, but by 19:20 had found the correct distance scored a pair of hits aft, which did not inflict serious damage. "Derfflinger" then disappeared in the haze, so "Royal Oak" shifted fire to the next battlecruiser, . She scored a hit at 19:27 before "Seydlitz" too was lost in the mist.

While "Royal Oak" was attacking the battlecruisers, a German torpedo boat flotilla launched an attack on the British line. "Royal Oak"s secondary guns were the first to open fire, at 19:16, followed quickly by the rest of the British line. Following the German destroyer attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and "Royal Oak" and the rest of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard the fleet flagship over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its night-time cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. In the course of the battle, "Royal Oak" had fired 38 rounds from her main battery and 84 rounds from her secondary guns.

Following the battle, "Royal Oak" was reassigned to the <a href="British%201st%20Battle%20Squadron">First Battle Squadron</a>.

On 18 August, the Germans again sortied, this time to bombard <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a>; <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a>, the German fleet commander, hoped to draw out Beatty's battlecruisers and destroy them. British signals intelligence decrypted German wireless transmissions, allowing Jellicoe enough time to deploy the Grand Fleet in an attempt to engage in a decisive battle. Both sides withdrew after their opponents' <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s inflicted losses: the British cruisers and were both torpedoed and sunk by German <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s, and the German battleship was damaged by the British submarine . After returning to port, Jellicoe issued an order that prohibited risking the fleet in the southern half of the North Sea due to the overwhelming risk from mines and U-boats. In late 1917, the Germans began using destroyers and light cruisers to raid the British convoys to Norway; this forced the British to deploy capital ships to protect the convoys. In April 1918, the German fleet sortied in an attempt to catch one of the isolated British squadrons, though the convoy had already passed safely. The Grand Fleet sortied too late to catch the retreating Germans; the battlecruiser was torpedoed and badly damaged by the <a href="submarine">submarine</a> .

On 5 November 1918, in the final week of the First World War, "Royal Oak" was anchored off <a href="Burntisland">Burntisland</a> in the <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a> accompanied by the <a href="seaplane%20tender">seaplane tender</a> and the light <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> . A sudden <a href="Beaufort%20scale">Force 10</a> <a href="squall">squall</a> caused "Campania" to drag her <a href="anchor">anchor</a>, collide with "Royal Oak" and then with "Glorious". Both <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s suffered only minor damage; "Campania" was holed by her initial collision with "Royal Oak". The ship's engine rooms flooded, and she settled by the stern and sank five hours later, without loss of life.

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, the Allies interned most of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow. The fleet rendezvoused with the British <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive fleet consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>. Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. That morning, the Grand Fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training manoeuvres, and while they were away Reuter issued the order to <a href="Scuttling%20of%20the%20German%20fleet%20at%20Scapa%20Flow">scuttle the High Seas Fleet</a>.

The peacetime reorganisation of the Royal Navy assigned "Royal Oak" to the Second Battle Squadron of the <a href="Atlantic%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Atlantic Fleet</a>. Modernised by the 1922–24 refit, she was transferred in 1926 to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Mediterranean Fleet</a>, based in <a href="Grand%20Harbour">Grand Harbour</a>, Malta. In early 1928, this duty saw the notorious incident the contemporary press dubbed the "Royal Oak Mutiny". What began as a simple dispute between Rear-Admiral Bernard Collard and "Royal Oak"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s two senior officers, Captain <a href="Kenneth%20Dewar">Kenneth Dewar</a> and Commander Henry Daniel, over the band at the ship's <a href="wardroom">wardroom</a> dance, descended into a bitter personal feud that spanned several months. Dewar and Daniel accused Collard of "vindictive fault-finding" and openly humiliating and insulting them before their crew; in return, Collard countercharged the two with failing to follow orders and treating him "worse than a midshipman". 

When Dewar and Daniel wrote letters of complaint to Collard's superior, <a href="John%20Kelly%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Vice-Admiral John Kelly</a>, he immediately passed them on to the Commander-in-Chief <a href="Roger%20Keyes%2C%201st%20Baron%20Keyes">Admiral Sir Roger Keyes</a>. On realising that the relationship between the two and their flag admiral had irretrievably broken down, Keyes removed all three from their posts and sent them back to England. Since this was on the eve of a major naval exercise, he was obliged to postpone it, which allowed rumours to fly around the fleet that the "Royal Oak" had experienced a <a href="mutiny">mutiny</a>. The story was picked up by the press worldwide, which described the affair with some hyperbole. Public attention reached such proportions as to raise the concerns of the <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King</a>, who summoned <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> <a href="William%20Clive%20Bridgeman">William Bridgeman</a> for an explanation.

For their letters of complaint, Dewar and Daniel were controversially charged with writing subversive documents. In a pair of highly publicised <a href="court-martial">courts-martial</a>, both were found guilty and severely reprimanded, leading Daniel to resign from the Navy. Collard himself was criticised for the excesses of his conduct by the press and in Parliament, and on being denounced by Bridgeman as "unfitted to hold further high command", was forcibly retired from service. Of the three, only Dewar escaped with his career, albeit a damaged one: he remained in the Royal Navy, but in a series of more minor commands. His promotion to rear-admiral, which would normally have been a formality, was delayed until the following year, just one day before his retirement. Daniel attempted a career in journalism, but when this and other ventures were unsuccessful, he disappeared into obscurity amid poor health in South Africa. Collard retreated to private life and never spoke publicly of the incident again.

The scandal proved an embarrassment to the reputation of the Royal Navy, then still the world's largest, and it was satirised at home and abroad through editorials, cartoons, and even a comic jazz oratorio composed by <a href="Erwin%20Schulhoff">Erwin Schulhoff</a>. One consequence of the damaging affair was an undertaking from the Admiralty to review the means by which naval officers might bring complaints against the conduct of their superiors.

During the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, "Royal Oak" was tasked with conducting 'non-intervention patrols' around the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>. On such a patrol and steaming some east of <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on 2 February 1937, she came under aerial attack by three aircraft of the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Republican</a> forces. They dropped three bombs (two of which exploded) within 3 <a href="cable%20length">cables</a> (555 m) of the starboard bow, causing no damage. The British <a href="charg%C3%A9%20d%27affaires">chargé d'affaires</a> protested about the incident to the Republican Government, which admitted its error and apologised for the attack. Later that same month, while stationed off <a href="Valencia%2C%20Spain">Valencia</a> on 23 February 1937 during an aerial bombardment by the <a href="Spain%20under%20Franco">Nationalists</a>, she was accidentally struck by an anti-aircraft shell fired from a Republican position. Five men were injured, including "Royal Oak"s captain, T. B. Drew. 

On this occasion the British did not protest to the Republicans, deeming the incident "an <a href="act%20of%20God">act of God</a>". In May 1937, she and escorted SS "Habana", a liner carrying <a href="Basque%20people">Basque</a> child refugees, to England. In July, as the war in northern Spain flared up, "Royal Oak", along with the battleship

This same period saw "Royal Oak" star alongside fourteen other Royal Navy vessels in the 1937 British film <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a> "<a href="Our%20Fighting%20Navy">Our Fighting Navy</a>", the plot of which centres around a coup in the fictional South American republic of Bianco. "Royal Oak" portrays a rebel battleship "El Mirante", whose commander forces a British captain (played by <a href="Robert%20Douglas%20%28actor%29">Robert Douglas</a>) into choosing between his lover and his duty. The film was poorly received by critics, but gained some redemption through its dramatic scenes of naval action.

In 1938, "Royal Oak" returned to the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a> and was made <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the Second Battle Squadron based in <a href="HMNB%20Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>. On 24 November 1938, she returned the body of the British-born <a href="Maud%20of%20Wales">Queen Maud of Norway</a>, who had died in London, to a state funeral in Oslo, accompanied by her husband <a href="Haakon%20VII%20of%20Norway">King Haakon VII</a>. <a href="Paid%20off">Paying off</a> in December 1938, "Royal Oak" was recommissioned the following June, and in the late summer of 1939 embarked on a short training cruise in the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> in preparation for another 30-month tour of the Mediterranean, for which her crew were issued tropical uniforms. As hostilities loomed, the battleship was instead dispatched north to <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>, and was at anchor there when war was declared on 3 September.

The next few weeks proved uneventful, but in October 1939 "Royal Oak" joined the search for the , which had been ordered into the North Sea as a diversion for the <a href="commerce%20raiding">commerce-raiding</a> heavy cruisers and . The search was ultimately fruitless, particularly for "Royal Oak", whose top speed, by then less than , was inadequate to keep up with the rest of the fleet. On 12 October, "Royal Oak" returned to the defences of Scapa Flow in poor shape, battered by North Atlantic storms. Many of her <a href="Carley%20float">Carley float</a>s had been smashed and several of the smaller-calibre guns rendered inoperable through flooding. The mission had underlined the obsolescence of the 25-year-old warship. Concerned that a recent overflight by German reconnaissance aircraft heralded an imminent air attack upon Scapa Flow, Admiral of the Home Fleet <a href="Charles%20Forbes%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Charles Forbes</a> ordered most of the fleet to disperse to safer ports. "Royal Oak" remained behind, her <a href="anti-aircraft">anti-aircraft</a> guns still deemed a useful addition to Scapa's otherwise scanty air defences.

 Scapa Flow made a near-ideal anchorage. Situated at the centre of the <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> Islands off the north coast of Scotland, the natural harbour, large enough to contain the entire Grand Fleet, was surrounded by a ring of islands separated by shallow channels subject to fast-racing <a href="tide">tide</a>s. The threat from U-boats had long been realised, and a series of countermeasures were installed during the early years of the First World War. <a href="Blockship">Blockship</a>s were sunk at critical points, and floating booms deployed to block the three widest channels, and operated by tugboats to allow the passage of friendly shipping. It was considered possible—but highly unlikely—that a daring U-boat commander could attempt to race through undetected before the boom was closed. Two submarines that had attempted infiltration during the First World War were ill-fated: on 23 November 1914 was rammed twice before running aground with the capture of her crew, and was detected by <a href="hydrophone">hydrophone</a> and destroyed with the loss of all hands on 28 October 1918.

Scapa Flow provided the main anchorage for the <a href="British%20Grand%20Fleet">British Grand Fleet</a> throughout most of the First World War, but in the interwar period this passed to <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a>, further south in the <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a>. Scapa Flow was reactivated with the advent of the Second World War, becoming a base for the <a href="British%20Home%20Fleet">British Home Fleet</a>. Its natural and artificial defences, while still strong, were recognised as in need of improvement, and in the early weeks of the war were in the process of being strengthened by the provision of additional blockships.

"Kriegsmarine" Commander of Submarines () <a href="Karl%20D%C3%B6nitz">Karl Dönitz</a> devised a plan to attack Scapa Flow by submarine within days of the outbreak of war. Its goal would be twofold: first, that displacing the Home Fleet from Scapa Flow would slacken the British <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> blockade and grant Germany greater freedom to attack the Atlantic convoys; second, the blow would be a symbolic act of vengeance, striking at the same location where the German <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> had surrendered and <a href="Scuttling%20of%20the%20German%20fleet%20at%20Scapa%20Flow">scuttled itself</a> following Germany's defeat in the First World War. Dönitz hand-picked "<a href="Kapit%C3%A4nleutnant">Kapitänleutnant</a>" <a href="G%C3%BCnther%20Prien">Günther Prien</a> for the task, scheduling the raid for the night of 13/14 October 1939, when the tides would be high and the night moonless.

Dönitz was aided by high-quality photographs from a reconnaissance overflight by <a href="Siegfried%20Knemeyer">Siegfried Knemeyer</a>, (who received his first Iron Cross for the mission), and which revealed the weaknesses of the defences and an abundance of targets. He directed Prien to enter Scapa Flow from its east via Kirk Sound, passing to the north of <a href="Lamb%20Holm">Lamb Holm</a>, a small low-lying island between <a href="Burray">Burray</a> and <a href="The%20Mainland%2C%20Orkney">Mainland</a>. Prien initially mistook the more southerly Skerry Sound for the chosen route and his sudden realisation that "U-47" was heading for the shallow blocked passage forced him to order a rapid turn to the northeast. On the surface, and illuminated by a bright display of the <a href="aurora%20borealis">aurora borealis</a>, the submarine threaded between the sunken <a href="blockship">blockship</a>s "Seriano" and "Numidian", grounding itself temporarily on a cable strung from "Seriano". It was briefly caught in the headlights of a taxi onshore, but the driver raised no alarm. On entering the harbour proper at 00:27 on 14 October, Prien entered a triumphant in the log and set a south-westerly course for several kilometres before reversing direction. To his surprise, the anchorage appeared to be almost empty; unknown to him, Forbes' order to disperse the fleet had removed some of the biggest targets. "U-47" had been heading directly towards four warships, including the newly commissioned <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> , anchored off <a href="Flotta">Flotta</a> and <a href="Hoy">Hoy</a> 4 nautical miles (8 km, 5 mi) distant, but Prien gave no indication that he had seen them.

On the reverse course, a lookout on the bridge spotted "Royal Oak" lying approximately 4,400 yards (4,000 m) to the north, correctly identifying her as a battleship of the . Mostly hidden behind her was a second ship, only the bow of which was visible to "U-47". Prien mistook her to be a battlecruiser of the , German intelligence later labelling her . She was in fact the World War I <a href="seaplane%20tender">seaplane tender</a> <a href="HMS%20Pegasus%20%281934%29">"Pegasus"</a>.

At 00:58 "U-47" fired a salvo of three <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es from its bow tubes, a fourth lodging in its tube. Two failed to find a target, but a single torpedo struck the bow of "Royal Oak" at 01:04, shaking the ship and waking the crew. There was little visible damage; the starboard anchor chain was severed, clattering noisily down through its slips. Initially, it was suspected that there had been an explosion in the ship's forward inflammable store, used to store materials such as kerosene. Mindful of the unexplained explosion that had destroyed at Scapa Flow in 1917, an announcement was made over "Royal Oak"s <a href="tannoy">tannoy</a> system to check the magazine temperatures, but many sailors returned to their hammocks, unaware that the ship was under attack.

Prien turned his submarine and attempted another shot via his stern tube, but this too missed. Reloading his bow tubes, he doubled back and fired a salvo of three torpedoes, all at "Royal Oak", This time he was successful: at 01:16 all three struck the battleship in quick succession amidships and detonated. The explosions blew a hole in the armoured deck, destroying the Stokers', Boys' and <a href="Royal%20Marines">Marines</a>' <a href="mess">mess</a>es and causing a loss of electrical power. Cordite from a magazine ignited and the ensuing fireball passed rapidly through the ship's internal spaces. "Royal Oak" quickly listed some 15°, sufficient to push the open starboard-side portholes below the waterline. She soon rolled further onto her side to 45°, hanging there for several minutes before disappearing beneath the surface at 01:29, 13 minutes after Prien's second strike. 833 men died with the ship, including Rear-Admiral <a href="Henry%20Blagrove">Henry Blagrove</a>, commander of the <a href="Second%20Battle%20Squadron">Second Battle Squadron</a>. Over one hundred of the dead were <a href="Boy%20seaman">Boy Seamen</a>, not yet 18 years old, the largest ever such loss in a single Royal Navy action. The admiral's wooden <a href="Captain%27s%20Gig">gig</a>, moored alongside, was dragged down with "Royal Oak".

The <a href="Ship%27s%20tender">tender</a> "Daisy 2", skippered by John Gatt, had been tied up for the night to "Royal Oak"s port side. As the sinking battleship began to list to starboard, Gatt ordered "Daisy 2" to be cut loose, his vessel becoming briefly caught on "Royal Oak"s rising anti-torpedo bulge and lifted from the sea before freeing herself.

Many of "Royal Oak"s crew who had managed to jump from the sinking ship were dressed in little more than their nightclothes and were unprepared for the chilling water. A thick layer of fuel oil coated the surface, filling men's lungs and stomachs and hampering their efforts to swim. Of those who attempted the half-mile (800 m) swim to the nearest shore, only a handful survived. 

"Royal Oak"s port side <a href="Pinnace%20%28ship%27s%20boat%29">pinnace</a> was manoeuvred away from the sinking ship and paddled away using wooden boards as there had been insufficient time to raise steam. The boat became heavily overladen and capsized some 300 metres from "Royal Oak", throwing those on deck into the water and trapping those below.

Gatt switched the lights of "Daisy 2" on and he and his crew managed to pull 386 men from the water, including "Royal Oak"s commander, Captain William Benn. The rescue efforts continued for another two and a half hours until nearly 4:00 am, when Gatt abandoned the search for more survivors and took those he had to "Pegasus". Aided by boats from "Pegasus" and the harbour, he was responsible for rescuing almost all the survivors, an act for which he was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a>, the only military award made by the British in connection with the disaster.

The British were initially confused as to the cause of the sinking, suspecting either an on-board explosion or aerial attack. Once it was realised that a submarine attack was the most likely explanation, steps were rapidly made to seal the anchorage, but "U-47" had already escaped and was on its way back to Germany. The <a href="BBC">BBC</a> released news of the sinking by late morning on 14 October, and its broadcasts were received by the German listening services and by "U-47" itself. <a href="Surface%20supplied%20diving">Divers</a> sent down on the morning after the explosion discovered remnants of a German torpedo, confirming the means of attack. On 17 October <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> officially announced the loss of "Royal Oak" to the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a>, first conceding that the raid had been "a remarkable exploit of professional skill and daring", but then declaring that the loss would not materially affect the naval balance of power. An Admiralty <a href="Board%20of%20Enquiry">Board of Enquiry</a> convened between 18 and 24 October to establish the circumstances under which the anchorage had been penetrated. In the meantime, the Home Fleet was ordered to remain at safer ports until security issues at Scapa could be addressed. Churchill was obliged to respond to questions in the House as to why "Royal Oak" had had aboard so many <a href="Boy%20seaman">Boys</a>, most of whom lost their lives. He defended the Royal Navy tradition of sending boys aged 15 to 17 to sea, but the practice was generally discontinued shortly after the disaster, and under 18-year-olds served on active warships in only the most exceptional circumstances.
The Nazi <a href="Propagandaministerium">Propaganda Ministry</a> was quick to capitalise on the successful raid, and radio broadcasts by the popular journalist <a href="Hans%20Fritzsche">Hans Fritzsche</a> displayed the triumph felt throughout Germany. Prien and his crew reached <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> at 11:44 on 17 October and were immediately greeted as heroes, learning that Prien had been awarded the <a href="Iron%20Cross">Iron Cross</a> First Class, and each man of the crew the Iron Cross Second Class. <a href="Hitler">Hitler</a> sent his personal plane to bring the crew to <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, where he further invested Prien with the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a>. This decoration, made for the first time to a German submarine officer, later became the customary decoration for successful U-Boat commanders. Dönitz was rewarded by promotion from Commodore to Rear-Admiral and was made <a href="Flag%20Officer">Flag Officer</a> of U-Boats.

Prien was nicknamed "The Bull of Scapa Flow" and his crew decorated "U-47"s conning tower with a snorting bull mascot, later adopted as the emblem of the <a href="7th%20U-boat%20Flotilla">7th U-boat Flotilla</a>. He found himself in demand for radio and newspaper interviews, and his 'autobiography' was published the following year, titled . <a href="Ghostwriter">Ghost-written</a> for him by a German journalist, in the post-war years some of its claims, and in particular those relating to the events of October 1939, were brought into question.
The British Admiralty's official report into the disaster condemned the defences at Scapa Flow, and censured Sir <a href="Wilfred%20French">Wilfred French</a>, Admiral Commanding Orkney and Shetland, for their unprepared state. French was placed on the retired list, despite having warned the previous summer of Scapa Flow's deficient anti-submarine defences, and volunteering to bring a small ship or submarine himself past the blockships to prove his point. On Churchill's orders, the eastern approaches to Scapa Flow were sealed with concrete <a href="causeway">causeway</a>s linking <a href="Lamb%20Holm">Lamb Holm</a>, <a href="Glimps%20Holm">Glimps Holm</a>, <a href="Burray">Burray</a> and <a href="South%20Ronaldsay">South Ronaldsay</a> to <a href="Mainland%2C%20Orkney">Mainland</a>. Constructed largely by Italian prisoners of war, the <a href="Churchill%20Barriers">Churchill Barriers</a>, as they became known, were essentially complete by September 1944, and they were not opened officially until just after <a href="Victory%20in%20Europe%20Day">VE Day</a> in May 1945. They now form part of the transport infrastructure of Orkney, carrying the <a href="A961%20road">A961 road</a> between the islands.

In the years that followed, a rumour circulated that Prien had been guided into Scapa by one Alfred Wehring, a German agent living in Orkney in the guise of a Swiss watchmaker named Albert Oertel. Following the attack, 'Oertel' escaped with the submarine "B-06" back to Germany. This account of events originated as an article by the journalist Curt Riess in the 16 May 1942 issue of the American magazine "<a href="Saturday%20Evening%20Post">Saturday Evening Post</a>" and was later embellished by other authors, who added details of their own. Post-war searches through German and Orcadian archives have failed to find any evidence for the existence of Oertel, Wehring or a submarine named "B-06", and the story is now held to be wholly fictitious. The Orkneys' chief librarian, in a 1983 letter on the matter to the historian <a href="Nigel%20West">Nigel West</a>, offered his suggestion that the name Albert Oertel was likely a pun on the well-known Albert Hotel in Kirkwall.

In the immediate aftermath of the sinking, "Royal Oak"s survivors were billeted in the towns and villages of Orkney. A funeral parade for the dead took place at <a href="Lyness">Lyness</a> on <a href="Hoy">Hoy</a> on 16 October; many of the surviving crew, having lost all their own clothing on the ship, attended in borrowed boiler suits and gym shoes. They were generally granted a few days survivors' leave by the navy, and then assigned to ships and roles elsewhere. Kenneth Toop, who survived the sinking while serving as a <a href="Boy%20seaman">Boy, First Class</a> on "Royal Oak", served as the Royal Oak Association's Honorary Secretary. An annual ceremony of remembrance is held by the survivors and descendants of the crew at the Naval War Memorial, <a href="Southsea">Southsea</a>, on the anniversary of the sinking. The last remaining survivor of "Royal Oak", Arthur Smith, who had been a 17-year-old Boy, First Class when the ship was struck, died on 11 December 2016. He had been on watch at the bridge and had jumped from the sinking ship, swimming in the wrong direction until he was picked up by a boat and transferred to the "Daisy 2".

Prien did not survive the war: he and "U-47" were lost on 7 March 1941, possibly as a result of an attack by the British destroyer . News of the loss was kept secret by the Nazi government for ten weeks. Several "U-47" crew from the "Royal Oak" mission did survive, having been transferred to other vessels. Some of them subsequently met with their former enemies from "Royal Oak" and forged friendships with them.

Despite the relatively shallow water in which she sank, the majority of bodies could not be recovered from "Royal Oak". Marked by a buoy at , the wreck has been designated a <a href="war%20grave">war grave</a> and all diving or other unauthorised forms of exploration are prohibited under the <a href="Protection%20of%20Military%20Remains%20Act%201986">Protection of Military Remains Act 1986</a>. In clear water conditions, the upturned hull can be seen reaching to within 5 m of the surface. The brass letters that formed "Royal Oak"s name were removed as a keepsake by a recreational diver in the 1970s. They were returned almost twenty years later, and are now displayed in the <a href="Scapa%20Flow%23Scapa%20Flow%20Visitor%20Centre">Scapa Flow visitor centre</a> in Lyness. "Royal Oak"s loss is commemorated in an annual ceremony in which Royal Navy divers place the <a href="White%20Ensign">White Ensign</a> underwater at her stern.

A memorial at <a href="St%20Magnus%20Cathedral">St Magnus Cathedral</a> in nearby <a href="Kirkwall">Kirkwall</a> displays a plaque dedicated to those who lost their lives, beneath which a book of remembrance lists their names. This list of names was not released by the Government until 40 years after the sinking. Each week a page of the book is turned. The ship's bell was recovered in the 1970s and, after being restored, was added to the memorial in St Magnus. A number of bodies, including some that could not be identified, were interred at the naval cemetery in Lyness.

"Royal Oak" sank with up to 3,000 <a href="ton">ton</a>s of fuel oil aboard, the precise amount being unknown since such records were lost with the ship. Oil leaked from the corroding hull at an increased rate during the 1990s and concerns about the environmental impact led the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a> to consider plans for extracting it. "Royal Oak"s status as a war grave required that surveys and any proposed techniques for removing the oil be handled sensitively: plans in the 1950s to raise and salvage the wreck had been dropped in response to public opposition. In addition to the ethical concerns, poorly managed efforts could destabilise the wreck, resulting in a mass release of the remaining oil; the ship also contains many tons of <a href="unexploded%20ordnance">unexploded ordnance</a>.

The MOD commissioned a series of <a href="Side-scan%20sonar">multi-beam sonar</a> surveys to image the wreck and appraise its condition. The high-resolution sonograms showed "Royal Oak" to be lying almost upside down with her top works forced into the seabed. The tip of the bow had been blown off by "U-47"s first torpedo and a gaping hole on the starboard flank was the result of the triple strike from her second successful salvo. Following several years of delays, Briggs Marine was contracted by the MoD to conduct the task of pumping off the remaining oil. "Royal Oak"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s mid-construction conversion to fuel oil had placed her fuel tanks in unconventional positions, complicating operations. By 2006, all double bottom tanks had been cleared and the task of removing oil from the inner wing tanks with <a href="water%20jet%20cutting">cold cutting</a> equipment began the next year. By 2010, some 1600 tonnes of fuel oil had been removed, and the wreck was declared to be no longer actively releasing oil into Scapa Flow. Operations continue at a reduced pace to tackle the oil known to be remaining (state for 2012).

In December 2018 respected skipper and rebreather diver Emily Turton announced at EUROTEK that an international team of experts were thoroughly surveying the wreck of the HMS Royal Oak to create a three-dimensional image of WWII war grave. (This process takes thousands of man hour dives over several months). The team used an extensive range of technology including videography, underwater photography and 3D photogrammetry to record the Royal Oak. The survey had the full backing of the Royal Navy and the Royal Oak Association.

Battle of Savo Island

The Battle of Savo Island, also known as the First Battle of Savo Island and, in Japanese sources, as the , and colloquially among Allied Guadalcanal veterans as The Battle of the Five Sitting Ducks, was a <a href="naval%20battle">naval battle</a> of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific Campaign</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> between the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> and <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> naval forces. The battle took place on August 8–9, 1942 and was the first major naval engagement of the <a href="Guadalcanal%20campaign">Guadalcanal campaign</a>, and the first of several naval battles in the straits later named <a href="Ironbottom%20Sound">Ironbottom Sound</a>, near the island of <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a>.

The Imperial Japanese Navy, in response to Allied <a href="amphibious%20warfare">amphibious</a> landings in the eastern <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>, mobilized a task force of seven cruisers and one <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> under the command of <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Gunichi%20Mikawa">Gunichi Mikawa</a>. The task forces sailed from Japanese bases in <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a> and <a href="New%20Ireland%20%28island%29">New Ireland</a> down <a href="New%20Georgia%20Sound">New Georgia Sound</a> (also known as "the Slot"), with the intention of interrupting the Allied landings by attacking the supporting amphibious fleet and its screening force. The Allied screen consisted of eight cruisers and fifteen destroyers under British <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Victor%20Alexander%20Charles%20Crutchley">Victor Crutchley</a> <a href="Victoria%20Cross">VC</a>, but only five cruisers and seven destroyers were involved in the battle. In a night action, Mikawa thoroughly surprised and routed the Allied force, sinking one Australian and three American <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s, while suffering only light damage in return. The battle has often been cited as the worst defeat in a fair fight in the history of the United States Navy.

After the initial engagement, Mikawa, fearing Allied carrier strikes against his fleet upon daybreak, decided to withdraw under cover of night rather than attempt to locate and destroy the Allied invasion transports. The Japanese attacks prompted the remaining Allied warships and the amphibious force to withdraw earlier than planned (prior to the unloading of all supplies), temporarily ceding control of the seas around Guadalcanal to the Japanese. This early withdrawal of the fleet left the Allied ground forces (primarily <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marines</a>), which had landed on Guadalcanal and nearby islands only two days before, in a precarious situation, with limited supplies, equipment, and food to hold their <a href="beachhead">beachhead</a>.

Mikawa's decision to withdraw under cover of night rather than attempt to destroy the Allied invasion transports was primarily founded on the high risk of Allied carrier strikes against his fleet upon daybreak. In reality, the Allied carrier fleet, similarly fearing Japanese attack, had already withdrawn beyond operational range. This missed opportunity to cripple (rather than interrupt) the supply of Allied forces on Guadalcanal contributed to Japan's inability to later recapture the island. At this early critical stage of the campaign, it allowed the Allied forces to entrench and fortify themselves in sufficient strength to successfully defend the area around Henderson Field until additional Allied reinforcements arrived later in the year.

The battle was the first of five costly, large scale sea and air-sea actions fought in support of the ground battles on Guadalcanal itself, as the Japanese sought to counter the American offensive in the Pacific. These sea battles took place every few days, with increasing delays on each side to regroup and refit, until the November 30, 1942 <a href="Battle%20of%20Tassafaronga">Battle of Tassafaronga</a> (sometimes referred to as the Fourth Battle of Savo Island or, in Japanese sources, as the ) after which the Japanese, eschewing the costly losses, attempted resupplying by submarine and barges. The final naval battle, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rennell%20Island">Battle of Rennell Island</a> (Japanese: レンネル島沖海戦), took place months later on January 29–30, 1943, by which time the Japanese were preparing to evacuate their remaining land forces and withdraw.

On August 7, 1942, Allied forces (primarily <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marines</a>) <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign%23Landings">landed on Guadalcanal</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Tulagi%20and%20Gavutu%E2%80%93Tanambogo%23Tulagi">Tulagi</a>, and <a href="Florida%20Island">Florida Island</a> in the eastern Solomon Islands. The landings were meant to deny their use to the Japanese as <a href="Military%20base">bases</a>, especially the nearly completed airfield at <a href="Henderson%20Field%20%28Guadalcanal%29">Henderson Field</a> that was being constructed on Guadalcanal. If Japanese air and sea forces were allowed to establish forward operating bases in the Eastern Solomons they would be in a position to threaten the <a href="materiel">supply</a> shipping routes between the U.S. and Australia. The Allies also wanted to use the islands as launching points for a campaign to recapture the Solomons, isolate or capture the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul%23World%20War%20II">Rabaul</a>, and support the Allied <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>, which was then building strength under General Douglas MacArthur. The landings initiated the six-month-long <a href="Guadalcanal%20campaign">Guadalcanal campaign</a>.

The overall commander of Allied naval forces in the Guadalcanal and Tulagi operation was U.S. <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Frank%20Jack%20Fletcher">Frank Jack Fletcher</a>. He also commanded the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">carrier</a> task groups providing air cover. U.S. <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Richmond%20K.%20Turner">Richmond K. Turner</a> commanded the amphibious fleet that delivered the 16,000 Allied troops to Guadalcanal and Tulagi. Also under Turner was British Admiral <a href="Victor%20Crutchley">Victor Crutchley</a>'s screening force of eight cruisers, fifteen destroyers, and five minesweepers. This force was to protect Turner's ships and provide gunfire support for the landings. Crutchley commanded his force of mostly American ships from his <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, the Australian <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> .

The Allied landings took the Japanese by surprise. The Allies <a href="Battle%20of%20Tulagi%20and%20Gavutu-Tanambogo">secured Tulagi, nearby islets Gavutu and Tanambogo</a>, and the airfield under construction on Guadalcanal by nightfall on August 8. On August 7 and August 8, Japanese aircraft based at Rabaul attacked the Allied amphibious forces several times, setting afire the U.S. transport ship (which sank later) and heavily damaging the destroyer . In these air attacks, the Japanese lost 36 aircraft, while the U.S. lost 19 aircraft, including 14 carrier <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter aircraft</a>.

Concerned over the losses to his carrier fighter aircraft strength, anxious about the threat to his carriers from further Japanese air attacks, and worried about his ships' fuel levels, Fletcher announced that he would be withdrawing his carrier task forces on the evening of August 8.

Some historians contend that Fletcher's fuel situation was not at all critical but that Fletcher used it to justify his withdrawal from the battle area. Fletcher's biographer notes that Fletcher concluded that the landing was a success and that no important targets for close air support were at hand. Being concerned over the loss of 21 of his carrier fighters, he assessed that his carriers were threatened by torpedo-bomber strikes, and, wanting to refuel before Japanese naval forces arrived, withdrew as he had previously forewarned Turner and Vandegrift. Turner, however, believed that Fletcher understood that he was to provide air cover until all the transports were unloaded on August 9.

Even though the unloading was going slower than planned, Turner decided that without carrier air cover he would have to withdraw his ships from Guadalcanal. He planned to unload as much as possible during the night and depart the next day.

Unprepared for the Allied operation at Guadalcanal, the initial Japanese response included airstrikes and an attempted reinforcement. Mikawa, commander of the newly formed Japanese <a href="IJN%208th%20Fleet">Eighth Fleet</a> headquartered at Rabaul, loaded 519 naval troops on two transports and sent them towards Guadalcanal on August 7. However, when the Japanese learned that Allied forces at Guadalcanal were stronger than originally reported, the transports were recalled.

Mikawa also assembled all the available warships in the area to attack the Allied forces at Guadalcanal. At Rabaul were the heavy cruiser (Mikawa's flagship), the light cruisers and and the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> . En route from <a href="Kavieng">Kavieng</a> were four heavy cruisers of Cruiser Division 6 under Rear Admiral <a href="Aritomo%20Goto">Aritomo Goto</a>: , , , and .

The Japanese Navy had trained extensively in night-fighting tactics before the war, a fact of which the Allies were unaware. Mikawa hoped to engage the Allied naval forces off Guadalcanal and Tulagi on the night of August 8 and August 9, when he could employ his night-battle expertise while avoiding attacks from Allied aircraft, which could not operate effectively at night. Mikawa's warships rendezvoused at sea near <a href="Cape%20St.%20George">Cape St. George</a> in the evening of August 7 and then headed east-southeast.

Mikawa decided to take his fleet north of <a href="Buka%20Island">Buka Island</a> and then down the east coast of <a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville</a>. The fleet would pause east of <a href="Kieta">Kieta</a> for six hours on the morning of August 8. (This would avoid daytime air attacks during their final approach to Guadalcanal.) They would then proceed along the dangerous channel known as "The Slot", hoping that no Allied plane would see them in the fading light. The Japanese fleet was in fact sighted in St George Channel, where their column almost ran into , lying in ambush. She was too close to fire torpedoes, but her captain, Lieutenant Commander <a href="Henry%20G.%20Munson">H.G. Munson</a>, radioed: "Two destroyers and three larger ships of unknown type heading one four zero true at high speed eight miles west of Cape St George" 
The warnings, however, were considered vague and the size of the force reported did not suggest an attack was pending.

Once at Bougainville, Mikawa spread his ships out over a wide area to mask the composition of his force and launched four floatplanes from his cruisers to scout for Allied ships in the southern Solomons.

At 10:20 and 11:10, his ships were spotted by <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Hudson</a> reconnaissance aircraft based at <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> in New Guinea. The first Hudson misidentified them as "three cruisers, three destroyers, and two seaplane tenders". (Note: Some accounts state that the first Hudson's crew identified the enemy ships correctly, but the composition of enemy forces was changed from the aircraft crews' report by intelligence officers in Milne Bay.) The Hudson's crew tried to report the sighting to the Allied radio station at Fall River, New Guinea. Receiving no acknowledgment, they returned to Milne Bay at 12:42 to ensure that the report was received as soon as possible. The second Hudson also failed to report its sighting by radio, but completed its patrol and landed at Milne Bay at 15:00. It reported sighting "two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and one unknown type". For unknown reasons, these reports were not relayed to the Allied fleet off Guadalcanal until 18:45 and 21:30, respectively, on August 8. U.S. official historian <a href="Samuel%20Eliot%20Morison">Samuel Morison</a> wrote in his 1949 account that the RAAF Hudson's crew failed to report the sighting until after they had landed and even had tea. This claim made international headlines and was repeated by many subsequent historians. Later research has discredited this version of events, and in 2014, the U.S. Navy's Naval History and Heritage Command acknowledged in a letter to the Hudson's radio operator, who had lobbied for decades to clear his crewmates' name, that Morison's criticisms were "unwarranted."

Mikawa's floatplanes returned by 12:00 and reported two groups of Allied ships, one off Guadalcanal and the other off Tulagi. He reassembled his warships and began his run towards Guadalcanal, entering the Slot near <a href="Choiseul%20Island">Choiseul</a> by 16:00 on August 8. Mikawa communicated the following battle plan to his warships: "On the rush-in we will go from S. (south) of Savo Island and torpedo the enemy main force in front of Guadalcanal anchorage; after which we will turn toward the Tulagi forward area to shell and torpedo the enemy. We will then withdraw north of Savo Island."

Mikawa's run down the Slot was not detected by Allied forces. Turner had requested that U.S. Admiral <a href="John%20S.%20McCain%2C%20Sr.">John S. McCain, Sr.</a>, commander of Allied air forces for the South Pacific area, conduct extra reconnaissance missions over the Slot in the afternoon of August 8. But, for unexplained reasons, McCain did not order the missions, nor did he tell Turner that they were not carried out. Thus, Turner mistakenly believed that the Slot was under Allied observation throughout the day.
To protect the unloading transports during the night, Crutchley divided the Allied warship forces into three groups. A "southern" group, consisting of the Australian cruisers HMAS "Australia" and , cruiser , and destroyers and , patrolled between Lunga Point and <a href="Savo%20Island">Savo Island</a> to block the entrance between Savo Island and <a href="Cape%20Esperance">Cape Esperance</a> on Guadalcanal. A "northern" group, consisting of the cruisers , and , and destroyers and , conducted a box-shaped patrol between the Tulagi anchorage and Savo Island to defend the passage between Savo and Florida Islands. An "eastern" group consisting of the cruisers and and two U.S. destroyers guarded the eastern entrances to the sound between Florida and Guadalcanal Islands. Crutchley placed two radar-equipped U.S. destroyers to the west of Savo Island to provide early warning for any approaching Japanese ships. The destroyer patrolled the northern passage and the destroyer patrolled the southern passage, with a gap of 12–30 kilometres (8–20 mi) between their uncoordinated patrol patterns. At this time, the Allies were unaware of all of the limitations of their primitive ship-borne <a href="radar">radar</a>s, such as the effectiveness of the radar could be greatly degraded by the presence of nearby landmasses. "Chicagos" Captain Bode ordered his ship's radar to be turned off in the mistaken belief it would reveal his position. He allowed a single sweep every half hour with the fire control radar, but the timing of the last pre-engagement sweep was too early to detect the approaching Japanese cruisers. Wary of the potential threat from Japanese submarines to the transport ships, Crutchley placed his remaining seven destroyers as close-in protection around the two transport anchorages.

The crews of the Allied ships were fatigued after two days of constant alert and action in supporting the landings. Also, the weather was extremely hot and humid, inducing further fatigue and, in Morison's words, "inviting weary sailors to slackness." In response, most of Crutchley's warships went to "Condition II" the night of August 8, which meant that half the crews were on duty while the other half rested, either in their bunks or near their battle stations.

In the evening, Turner called a conference on his command ship off Guadalcanal with Crutchley and Marine commander Major General <a href="Alexander%20Vandegrift">Alexander A. Vandegrift</a> to discuss the departure of Fletcher's carriers and the resulting withdrawal schedule for the transport ships. At 20:55, Crutchley left the southern group in "Australia" to attend the conference, leaving Captain Howard D. Bode of "Chicago" in charge of the southern group. Crutchley did not inform the commanders of the other cruiser groups of his absence, contributing further to the dissolution of command arrangements. Bode, awakened from sleep in his cabin, decided not to place his ship in the lead of the southern group of ships, the customary place for the senior ship, and went back to sleep. At the conference, Turner, Crutchley, and Vandegrift discussed the reports of the "seaplane tender" force reported by the Australian Hudson crew earlier that day. They decided it would not be a threat that night, because seaplane tenders did not normally engage in a surface action. Vandegrift said that he would need to inspect the transport unloading situation at Tulagi before recommending a withdrawal time for the transport ships, and he departed at midnight to conduct the inspection. Crutchley elected not to return with "Australia" to the southern force but instead stationed his ship just outside the Guadalcanal transport anchorage, without informing the other Allied ship commanders of his intentions or location.
As Mikawa's force neared the Guadalcanal area, the Japanese ships launched three floatplanes for one final reconnaissance of the Allied ships, and to provide illumination by dropping flares during the upcoming battle. Although several of the Allied ships heard and/or observed one or more of these floatplanes, starting at 23:45 on August 8, none of them interpreted the presence of unknown aircraft in the area as an actionable threat, and no one reported the sightings to Crutchley or Turner.

Mikawa's force approached in a single column led by "Chōkai", with "Aoba", "Kako", "Kinugasa", "Furutaka", "Tenryū", "Yūbari", and "Yūnagi" following. Sometime between 00:44 and 00:54 on August 9, lookouts in Mikawa's ships spotted "Blue" about ahead of the Japanese column.

To avoid "Blue", Mikawa changed course to pass north of Savo Island. He also ordered his ships to slow to , to reduce wakes that might make his ships more visible. Four minutes later, Mikawa's lookouts spied either "Ralph Talbot" about 16 kilometres (10 mi) away or a small <a href="schooner">schooner</a> of unknown nationality. The Japanese ships held their course while pointing more than 50 guns at "Blue", ready to open fire at the first indication that "Blue" had sighted them. When "Blue" was less than 2 kilometres (1 mi) away from Mikawa's force, she suddenly reversed course, having reached the end of her patrol track, and steamed away, apparently oblivious to the long column of large Japanese ships sailing by her. Seeing that his ships were still undetected, Mikawa turned back to a course south of Savo Island and increased speed, first to , and then to . At 01:25, Mikawa released his ships to operate independently of his flagship, and at 01:31, he ordered, "Every ship attack."

At about this time, "Yūnagi" detached from the Japanese column and reversed direction, perhaps because she lost sight of the other Japanese ships ahead of her, or perhaps she was ordered to provide a rearguard for Mikawa's force. One minute later, Japanese lookouts sighted a warship to <a href="port%20%28nautical%29">port</a>. This ship was the destroyer , heavily damaged the day before and now departing Guadalcanal independently for repairs in Australia. Whether "Jarvis" sighted the Japanese ships is unknown, since her radios had been destroyed. "Furutaka" launched torpedoes at "Jarvis", which all missed. The Japanese ships passed as close to "Jarvis" as 1,100 meters, close enough for officers on "Tenryū" to look down onto the destroyer's decks without seeing any of her crew moving about. If "Jarvis" was aware of the Japanese ships passing by, she did not respond in any noticeable way.

Two minutes after sighting "Jarvis", the Japanese lookouts sighted the Allied destroyers and cruisers of the southern force about 12,500 metres away, silhouetted by the glow from the burning "George F. Elliott". Several minutes later, at about 01:38, the Japanese cruisers began launching salvos of torpedoes at the Allied southern force ships. At this same time, lookouts on "Chōkai" spotted the ships of the Allied northern force at a range of 16 kilometres (10 mi). "Chōkai" turned to face this new threat, and the rest of the Japanese column followed, while still preparing to engage the Allied southern force ships with gunfire.

"Patterson"s crew was alert because the destroyer's captain had taken seriously the earlier daytime sightings of Japanese warships and evening sightings of unknown aircraft, and told his crew to be ready for action. At 01:43, "Patterson" spotted a ship, probably "Kinugasa", 5,000 meters dead ahead and immediately sent a warning by radio and signal lamp: "Warning! Warning! Strange ships entering the harbor!" "Patterson" increased speed to full, and fired <a href="star%20shell">star shell</a>s towards the Japanese column. Her captain ordered a torpedo attack, but his order was not heard over the noise from the destroyer's guns.

At about the same moment that "Patterson" sighted the Japanese ships and went into action, the Japanese floatplanes overhead, on orders from Mikawa, dropped aerial flares directly over "Canberra" and "Chicago". "Canberra" responded immediately, with Captain <a href="Frank%20Getting">Frank Getting</a> ordering an increase in speed, a reversal of an initial turn to port, which kept "Canberra" between the Japanese and the Allied transports, and for her guns to train out and fire at any targets that could be sighted. Less than one minute later, as "Canberra"s guns took aim at the Japanese, "Chōkai" and "Furutaka" opened fire on her, scoring numerous hits within a few seconds. "Aoba" and "Kako" joined in with gunfire, and within the next three minutes "Canberra" took up to 24 large caliber hits. Early hits killed her gunnery officer, mortally wounded Getting, and destroyed both boiler rooms, knocking out power to the entire ship before "Canberra" could fire any of her guns or communicate a warning to other Allied ships. The cruiser glided to a stop, on fire, with a 5- to 10-degree list to starboard, and unable to fight the fires or pump out flooded compartments because of lack of power. Since all of the Japanese ships were on the port side of "Canberra", the damage to the ship's starboard side occurred either from shells entering low on the port side and exiting below the waterline on the starboard side, or from one or two torpedo hits on the starboard side. If torpedoes did hit "Canberra" on the starboard side, then they may have come from a nearby Allied ship, and at this time the U.S. destroyer "Bagley" was the only ship on that side of the Australian cruiser and had fired torpedoes moments earlier.

The crew of "Chicago", observing the illumination of their ship by air-dropped flares and the sudden turn by "Canberra" in front of them, came alert and awakened Captain Bode from "a sound sleep". Bode ordered his guns to fire star shells towards the Japanese column, but the shells did not function. At 01:47, a torpedo, probably from "Kako", hit "Chicago"s bow, sending a shock wave throughout the ship that damaged the main battery director. A second torpedo hit but failed to explode, and a shell hit the cruiser's mainmast, killing two crewmen. "Chicago" steamed west for 40 minutes, leaving behind the transports she was assigned to protect. The cruiser fired her secondary batteries at the trailing ships in the Japanese column and may have hit "Tenryū", causing slight damage. Bode did not try to assert control over any of the other Allied ships in the southern force, of which he was still technically in command. More significantly, Bode made no attempt to warn any of the other Allied ships or personnel in the Guadalcanal area as his ship headed away from the battle area.

During this time, "Patterson" engaged in a gun duel with the Japanese column. "Patterson" received a shell hit aft, causing moderate damage and killing 10 crew members. "Patterson" continued to pursue and fire at the Japanese ships and may have hit "Kinugasa", causing moderate damage. "Patterson" then lost sight of the Japanese column as it headed northeast along the eastern shore of Savo Island. "Bagley", whose crew sighted the Japanese shortly after "Patterson" and "Canberra", circled completely around to port before firing torpedoes in the general direction of the rapidly disappearing Japanese column; one or two of which may have hit "Canberra". "Bagley" played no further role in the battle. "Yūnagi" exchanged non-damaging gunfire with "Jarvis" before exiting the battle area to the west with the intention of eventually rejoining the Japanese column north and west of Savo Island.

At 01:44, as Mikawa's ships headed towards the Allied northern force, "Tenryū" and "Yūbari" split from the rest of the Japanese column and took a more westward course. "Furutaka", either because of a steering problem, or to avoid a possible collision with "Canberra", followed "Yūbari" and "Tenryū". Thus, the Allied northern force was about to be enveloped and attacked from two sides.

When Mikawa's ships attacked the Allied southern force, the captains of all three U.S. northern force cruisers were asleep, with their ships steaming quietly at . Although crewmen on all three ships observed flares or gunfire from the battle south of Savo or else received "Patterson"s warning of threatening ships entering the area, it took some time for the crews to go from Condition II to full alert. At 01:44, the Japanese cruisers began firing torpedoes at the northern force. At 01:50, they aimed powerful searchlights at the three northern cruisers and opened fire with their guns.

"Astoria"s bridge crew called <a href="general%20quarters">general quarters</a> upon sighting the flares south of Savo, around 01:49. At 01:52, shortly after the Japanese searchlights came on and shells began falling around the ship, "Astoria"s main gun director crews spotted the Japanese cruisers and opened fire. "Astoria"s captain, awakened to find his ship in action, rushed to the bridge and ordered a ceasefire, fearful that his ship might be firing on friendly forces. As shells continued to cascade around his ship, the captain ordered firing resumed less than a minute later. "Chōkai", however, had found the range, and "Astoria" was quickly hit by numerous shells and set afire. Between 02:00 and 02:15, "Aoba", "Kinugasa", and "Kako" joined "Chōkai" in pounding "Astoria", destroying the cruiser's engine room and bringing the flaming ship to a halt. At 02:16, one of "Astoria"s remaining operational main gun turrets fired at "Kinugasa"s searchlight, but missed and hit "Chōkai"s forward turret, putting the turret out of action and causing moderate damage to the ship.

"Quincy" had also seen the aircraft flares over the southern ships, received "Patterson"s warning, and had just sounded general quarters and was coming alert when the searchlights from the Japanese column came on. "Quincy"s captain gave the order to commence firing, but the gun crews were not ready. Within a few minutes, "Quincy" was caught in a crossfire between "Aoba", "Furutaka", and "Tenryū", and was hit heavily and set afire. "Quincy"s captain ordered his cruiser to charge towards the eastern Japanese column, but as she turned to do so "Quincy" was hit by two torpedoes from "Tenryū", causing severe damage. "Quincy" managed to fire a few main gun salvos, one of which hit "Chōkai"s chart room 6 meters (20 ft) from Admiral Mikawa and killed or wounded 36 men, although Mikawa was not injured. At 02:10, incoming shells killed or wounded almost all of "Quincy"s bridge crew, including the captain. At 02:16, the cruiser was hit by a torpedo from "Aoba", and the ship's remaining guns were silenced. "Quincy"s assistant gunnery officer, sent to the bridge to ask for instructions, reported on what he found:

"Quincy" sank, bow first, at 02:38.
Like "Quincy" and "Astoria", "Vincennes" also sighted the aerial flares to the south, and furthermore, actually sighted gunfire from the southern engagement. At 01:50, when the U.S. cruisers were illuminated by the Japanese searchlights, "Vincennes" hesitated to open fire, believing that the searchlight's source might be friendly ships. Shortly thereafter, "Kako" opened fire on "Vincennes" which responded with her own gunfire at 01:53. As "Vincennes" began to receive damaging shell hits, her commander, U.S. <a href="Frederick%20Lois%20Riefkohl">Captain Frederick L. Riefkohl</a>, ordered an increase of speed to , but shortly thereafter, at 01:55, two torpedoes from "Chōkai" hit, causing heavy damage. "Kinugasa" now joined "Kako" in pounding "Vincennes". "Vincennes" scored one hit on "Kinugasa" causing moderate damage to her steering engines. The rest of the Japanese ships also fired and hit "Vincennes" up to 74 times, and, at 02:03, another torpedo hit her, this time from "Yūbari". With all boiler rooms destroyed, "Vincennes" came to a halt, burning "everywhere" and listing to port. At 02:16, Riefkohl ordered the crew to abandon ship, and "Vincennes" sank at 02:50.

During the engagement, the U.S. destroyers "Helm" and "Wilson" struggled to see the Japanese ships. Both destroyers briefly fired at Mikawa's cruisers but caused no damage and received no damage to themselves.

At 02:16, the Japanese columns ceased fire on the northern Allied force as they moved out of range around the north side of Savo Island. "Ralph Talbot" encountered "Furutaka", "Tenryū", and "Yūbari" as they cleared Savo Island. The Japanese ships fixed the U.S. destroyer with searchlights and hit her several times with gunfire, causing heavy damage, but "Ralph Talbot" escaped into a nearby rain squall, and the Japanese ships left her behind.

At 02:16 Mikawa conferred with his staff about whether they should turn to continue the battle with the surviving Allied warships and try to sink the Allied transports in the two anchorages. Several factors influenced his ultimate decision. His ships were scattered and would take some time to regroup. His ships would need to reload their torpedo tubes, a labor-intensive task that would take some time. Mikawa also did not know the number and locations of any remaining Allied warships and his ships had expended much of their ammunition.

More importantly, Mikawa had no air cover and believed that U.S. aircraft carriers were in the area. Mikawa was probably aware that the Japanese Navy had no more heavy cruisers in production, and thus would be unable to replace any he might lose to air attack the next day if he remained near Guadalcanal. He was unaware that the U.S. carriers had withdrawn from the battle area and would not be a threat the next day. Although several of Mikawa's staff urged an attack on the Allied transports, the consensus was to withdraw from the battle area. Therefore, at 02:20, Mikawa ordered his ships to retire.

At 04:00 on August 9 "Patterson" came alongside "Canberra" to assist the cruiser in fighting her fires. By 05:00, it appeared that the fires were almost under control, but Turner, who at this time intended to withdraw all Allied ships by 06:30, ordered the ship to be scuttled if she was not able to accompany the fleet. After the survivors were removed, the destroyers and sank "Canberra" which took some 300 shells and five torpedoes.

Later in the morning of August 9, General Vandegrift advised Admiral Turner that he needed more supplies unloaded from the transports before they withdrew. Therefore, Turner postponed the withdrawal of his ships until mid-afternoon. In the meantime, "Astoria"s crew tried to save their sinking ship. "Astoria"s fires, however, eventually became completely out of control, and the ship sank at 12:15.

On the morning of August 9, an Australian <a href="Coastwatchers">coastwatcher</a> on Bougainville radioed a warning of a Japanese airstrike on the way from Rabaul. The Allied transport crews ceased unloading for a time but were puzzled when the airstrike did not materialize. Allied forces did not discover until after the war was over that this Japanese airstrike instead concentrated on south of Guadalcanal, sinking her with all hands. The Allied transports and warships all departed the Guadalcanal area by nightfall on August 9.

In the late evening of August 9, Mikawa on "Chōkai" released the four cruisers of Cruiser Division 6 to return to their home base at Kavieng. At 08:10 on August 10, "Kako" was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine 110 kilometers (70 mi) from her destination. The other three Japanese cruisers picked up all but 71 of her crew and went on to Kavieng.

<a href="Admiral%20Yamamoto">Admiral Yamamoto</a> signaled a congratulatory note to Mikawa on his victory, stating, "Appreciate the courageous and hard fighting of every man of your organization. I expect you to expand your exploits and you will make every effort to support the land forces of the Imperial army which are now engaged in a desperate struggle." Later on, though, when it became apparent that Mikawa had missed an opportunity to destroy the Allied transports, he was intensely criticised by his comrades. 

From the time of the battle until several months later, almost all Allied supplies and reinforcements sent to Guadalcanal came by transports in small convoys, mainly during daylight hours, while Allied aircraft from the New Hebrides and <a href="Honiara%20International%20Airport">Henderson Field</a> and any available aircraft carriers flew covering missions. During this time, Allied forces on Guadalcanal received barely enough ammunition and provisions to withstand the several Japanese drives to retake the islands.

Despite their defeat in this battle, the Allies eventually won the battle for Guadalcanal, an important step in the eventual defeat of Japan. In hindsight, if Mikawa had elected to risk his ships to go after the Allied transports on the morning of August 9, he could have improved the chances of Japanese victory in the Guadalcanal campaign at its inception, and the course of the war in the southern Pacific could have gone much differently. Although the Allied warships at Guadalcanal that night were completely routed, the transports were unaffected. Many of these same transports were used many times to bring crucial supplies and reinforcements to Allied forces on Guadalcanal over succeeding months. Mikawa's decision not to destroy the Allied transport ships when he had the opportunity would prove to be a crucial strategic mistake for the Japanese.
A formal <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> board of inquiry, known as the Hepburn Investigation, prepared a report of the battle. The board interviewed most of the major Allied officers involved over several months, beginning in December 1942. The report recommended official <a href="censure">censure</a> for only one officer, Captain Howard D. Bode of the "Chicago", for failing to broadcast a warning to the fleet of encroaching enemy ships. The report stopped short of recommending formal action against other Allied officers, including Admirals Fletcher, Turner, McCain, and Crutchley, and Captain Riefkohl. The careers of Turner, Crutchley, and McCain do not appear to have been affected by the defeat or the mistakes they made in contributing to it. Riefkohl, however, never commanded ships again. Captain Bode, upon learning that the report was going to be especially critical of his actions, shot himself in his quarters at <a href="Balboa%2C%20Panama">Balboa</a>, <a href="Panama%20Canal%20Zone">Panama Canal Zone</a>, on April 19, 1943, and died the next day. Crutchley was gazetted with the <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a> (Chief Commander) in September 1944.
Admiral Turner assessed why his forces were so soundly defeated in the battle:

Historian <a href="Richard%20B.%20Frank">Richard B. Frank</a> adds that "This lethargy of mind would not be completely shaken off without some more hard blows to (U.S.) Navy pride around Guadalcanal, but after Savo, the United States picked itself up off the deck and prepared for the most savage combat in its history."

The report of the inquiry caused the US Navy to make many operational, and structural, changes.

Virtually every US Navy cruiser was retrofitted with emergency diesel electric generators. The fire mains of the ships were changed to a vertical loop design that could be broken many times and still function. 

During the battle at Savo, many ship fires were attributed to aviation facilities filled with gas, oil, and planes. Motorboats were filled with gasoline, and also caught fire. In some cases, these facilities were dead amidships, presenting a perfect target for enemy ships at night. Ready-service lockers added to the destruction, and it was noted that these lockers were never close to being depleted, i.e. they contained much more dangerous ammunition than they needed to. 

The Naval Commander in Chief <a href="Ernest%20Joseph%20King">Admiral King</a> would order sweeping changes be made before ships entered surface combat in the future.

L'Orfeo

L'Orfeo (<a href="Stattkus-Verzeichnis">SV</a> 318) (), sometimes called La favola d'Orfeo , is a late <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>/early <a href="Baroque%20music">Baroque</a> "favola in musica", or <a href="opera">opera</a>, by <a href="Claudio%20Monteverdi">Claudio Monteverdi</a>, with a <a href="libretto">libretto</a> by <a href="Alessandro%20Striggio%20the%20Younger">Alessandro Striggio</a>. It is based on the <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek legend</a> of <a href="Orpheus">Orpheus</a>, and tells the story of his descent to <a href="Hades">Hades</a> and his fruitless attempt to bring his dead bride <a href="Eurydice">Eurydice</a> back to the living world. It was written in 1607 for a court performance during the annual <a href="Carnival">Carnival</a> at <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a>. While <a href="Jacopo%20Peri">Jacopo Peri</a>'s "<a href="Dafne">Dafne</a>" is generally recognised as the first work in the opera genre, and the earliest surviving opera is Peri's "<a href="Euridice%20%28Peri%29">Euridice</a>", "L'Orfeo" is the earliest that is still regularly performed.

By the early 17th century the traditional <a href="intermedio">intermedio</a>—a musical sequence between the acts of a straight play—was evolving into the form of a complete musical drama or "opera". Monteverdi's "L'Orfeo" moved this process out of its experimental era and provided the first fully developed example of the new genre. After its initial performance the work was staged again in Mantua, and possibly in other Italian centres in the next few years. Its score was published by Monteverdi in 1609 and again in 1615. After the composer's death in 1643 the opera went unperformed for many years, and was largely forgotten until a revival of interest in the late 19th century led to a spate of modern editions and performances. At first these performances tended to be concert (unstaged) versions within institutes and music societies, but following the first modern dramatised performance in Paris, in 1911, the work began to be seen in theatres. After the Second World War many recordings were issued, and the opera was increasingly staged in opera houses, although some leading venues resisted it. In 2007, the quatercentenary of the premiere was celebrated by performances throughout the world.

In his published score Monteverdi lists around 41 instruments to be deployed, with distinct groups of instruments used to depict particular scenes and characters. Thus strings, harpsichords and recorders represent the pastoral fields of Thrace with their nymphs and shepherds, while heavy brass illustrates the underworld and its denizens. Composed at the point of transition from the <a href="Renaissance%20music">Renaissance</a> era to the Baroque, "L'Orfeo" employs all the resources then known within the art of music, with particularly daring use of <a href="polyphony">polyphony</a>. The work is not orchestrated as such; in the Renaissance tradition instrumentalists followed the composer's general instructions but were given considerable freedom to improvise.

Claudio Monteverdi, born in <a href="Cremona">Cremona</a> in 1567, was a musical <a href="child%20prodigy">prodigy</a> who studied under <a href="Marc%27Antonio%20Ingegneri">Marc'Antonio Ingegneri</a>, the " maestro di cappella" (head of music) at <a href="Cremona%20Cathedral">Cremona Cathedral</a>. After training in singing, strings playing and composition, Monteverdi worked as a musician in Verona and Milan until, in 1590 or 1591, he secured a post as "suonatore di vivuola" (viola player) at <a href="Vincent%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Mantua%20and%20Montferrat">Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga</a>'s court at <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a>. Through ability and hard work Monteverdi rose to become Gonzaga's "maestro della musica" (master of music) in 1601.

Vincenzo Gonzaga's particular passion for musical theatre and spectacle grew from his family connections with the court of <a href="Florence">Florence</a>. Towards the end of the 16th century innovative Florentine musicians were developing the <a href="intermedio">intermedio</a>—a long-established form of musical interlude inserted between the acts of spoken dramas—into increasingly elaborate forms. Led by <a href="Jacopo%20Corsi">Jacopo Corsi</a>, these successors to the renowned <a href="Florentine%20Camerata">Camerata</a> were responsible for the first work generally recognised as belonging to the genre of opera: "<a href="Dafne">Dafne</a>", composed by Corsi and <a href="Jacopo%20Peri">Jacopo Peri</a> and performed in Florence in 1598. This work combined elements of <a href="madrigal%20%28music%29">madrigal</a> singing and <a href="monody">monody</a> with dancing and instrumental passages to form a dramatic whole. Only fragments of its music still exist, but several other Florentine works of the same period—"<a href="Rappresentatione%20di%20Anima%2C%20et%20di%20Corpo">Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo</a>" by <a href="Emilio%20de%27%20Cavalieri">Emilio de' Cavalieri</a>, Peri's "<a href="Euridice%20%28Peri%29">Euridice</a>" and <a href="Giulio%20Caccini">Giulio Caccini</a>'s identically titled "<a href="Euridice%20%28Caccini%29">Euridice</a>"—survive complete. These last two works were the first of many musical representations of the <a href="Orpheus">Orpheus</a> myth as recounted in <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>", and as such were direct precursors of Monteverdi's "L'Orfeo".

The Gonzaga court had a long history of promoting dramatic entertainment. A century before Duke Vincenzo's time the court had staged <a href="Angelo%20Poliziano">Angelo Poliziano</a>'s lyrical drama "La favola di Orfeo", at least half of which was sung rather than spoken. More recently, in 1598 Monteverdi had helped the court's musical establishment produce <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Guarini">Giovanni Battista Guarini</a>'s play "<a href="Il%20pastor%20fido">Il pastor fido</a>", described by theatre historian <a href="Mark%20Ringer">Mark Ringer</a> as a "watershed theatrical work" which inspired the Italian craze for pastoral drama. On 6 October 1600, while visiting Florence for the wedding of <a href="Marie%20de%27%20Medici">Maria de' Medici</a> to <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20France">King Henry IV of France</a>, Duke Vincenzo attended a production of Peri's "Euridice". It is likely that his principal musicians, including Monteverdi, were also present at this performance. The Duke quickly recognised the novelty of this new form of dramatic entertainment, and its potential for bringing prestige to those prepared to sponsor it.

Among those present at the "Euridice" performance in October 1600 was a young lawyer and career diplomat from Gonzaga's court, <a href="Alessandro%20Striggio%20the%20Younger">Alessandro Striggio</a>, son of a well-known <a href="Alessandro%20Striggio">composer of the same name</a>. The younger Striggio was himself a talented musician; as a 16-year-old, he had played the viol at the wedding festivities of <a href="Ferdinando%20I%20de%27%20Medici%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Tuscany">Duke Ferdinando of Tuscany</a> in 1589. Together with Duke Vincent's two young sons, <a href="Francesco%20IV%20Gonzaga%2C%20Duke%20of%20Mantua">Francesco</a> and <a href="Ferdinando%20Gonzaga%2C%20Duke%20of%20Mantua">Fernandino</a>, he was a member of Mantua's exclusive intellectual society, the <a href="Accademia%20degli%20Invaghiti">Accademia degli Invaghiti</a>, which provided the chief outlet for the city's theatrical works. It is not clear at what point Striggio began his libretto for "L'Orfeo", but work was evidently under way in January 1607. In a letter written on 5 January, Francesco Gonzago asks his brother, then attached to the Florentine court, to obtain the services of a high quality <a href="castrato">castrato</a> from the Grand Duke's establishment, for a "play in music" being prepared for the Mantuan Carnival.

Striggio's main sources for his libretto were Books 10 and 11 of <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>" and Book Four of <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s "<a href="Georgics">Georgics</a>". These provided him with the basic material, but not the structure for a staged drama; the events of acts 1 and 2 of the libretto are covered by a mere 13 lines in the "Metamorphoses". For help in creating a dramatic form, Striggio drew on other sources—Poliziano's 1480 play, Guarini's "Il pastor fido", and <a href="Ottavio%20Rinuccini">Ottavio Rinuccini</a>'s libretto for Peri's "Euridice". Musicologist <a href="Gary%20Tomlinson">Gary Tomlinson</a> remarks on the many similarities between Striggio's and Rinuccini's texts, noting that some of the speeches in "L'Orfeo" "correspond closely in content and even in locution to their counterparts in "L'Euridice"". The critic <a href="Barbara%20Russano%20Hanning">Barbara Russano Hanning</a> writes that Striggio's verses are less subtle than those of Rinuccini, although the structure of Striggio's libretto is more interesting. Rinuccini, whose work had been written for the festivities accompanying a <a href="House%20of%20Medici">Medici</a> wedding, was obliged to alter the myth to provide a "happy ending" suitable for the occasion. By contrast, because Striggio was not writing for a formal court celebration he could be more faithful to the spirit of the myth's conclusion, in which Orfeo is killed and dismembered by deranged <a href="maenad">maenad</a>s or "Bacchantes". He chose, in fact, to write a somewhat muted version of this bloody finale, in which the Bacchantes threaten Orfeo's destruction but his actual fate is left in doubt.

The libretto was published in Mantua in 1607 to coincide with the premiere and incorporated Striggio's ambiguous ending. However, Monteverdi's score published in Venice in 1609 by <a href="Ricciardo%20Amadino">Ricciardo Amadino</a> shows an entirely different resolution, with Orpheus transported to the heavens through the intervention of Apollo. According to Ringer, Striggio's original ending was almost certainly used at the opera's premiere, but there is no doubt that Monteverdi believed the revised ending was aesthetically correct. The musicologist <a href="Nino%20Pirrotta">Nino Pirrotta</a> argues that the Apollo ending was part of the original plan for the work, but was not staged at the premiere because the small room which hosted the event could not contain the theatrical machinery that this ending required. The Bacchantes scene was a substitution; Monteverdi's intentions were restored when this constraint was removed.

When Monteverdi composed "L'Orfeo" he had a thorough grounding in theatrical music. He had been employed at the Gonzaga court for 16 years, much of it as a performer or arranger of stage music, and in 1604 he had written the <a href="ballo">ballo</a> "Gli amori di Diane ed Endimone" for the 1604–05 Mantua Carnival. The elements from which Monteverdi constructed his first opera score—the <a href="aria">aria</a>, the <a href="strophic%20form">strophic song</a>, <a href="recitative">recitative</a>, choruses, dances, dramatic musical interludes—were, as conductor <a href="Nikolaus%20Harnoncourt">Nikolaus Harnoncourt</a> has pointed out, not created by him, but "he blended the entire stock of newest and older possibilities into a unity that was indeed new". Musicologist <a href="Robert%20Donington">Robert Donington</a> writes similarly: "[The score] contains no element which was not based on precedent, but it reaches complete maturity in that recently developed form ... Here are words as directly expressed in music as [the pioneers of opera] wanted them expressed; here is music expressing them ... with the full inspiration of genius."

Monteverdi states the orchestral requirements at the beginning of his published score, but in accordance with the practice of the day he does not specify their exact usage. At that time it was usual to allow each interpreter of the work freedom to make local decisions, based on the orchestral forces at their disposal. These could differ sharply from place to place. Furthermore, as Harnoncourt points out, the instrumentalists would all have been composers and would have expected to collaborate creatively at each performance, rather than playing a set text. Another practice of the time was to allow singers to embellish their arias. Monteverdi wrote plain and embellished versions of some arias, such as Orfeo's "<a href="Possente%20spirto">Possente spirto</a>", but according to Harnoncourt "it is obvious that where he did not write any embellishments he did not want any sung".

Each act of the opera deals with a single element of the story, and each ends with a chorus. Despite the five-act structure, with two sets of scene changes, it is likely that "L'Orfeo" conformed to the standard practice for court entertainments of that time and was played as a continuous entity, without intervals or curtain descents between acts. It was the contemporary custom for scene shifts to take place in sight of the audience, these changes being reflected musically by changes in instrumentation, key and style.

For the purpose of analysis the music scholar <a href="Jane%20Glover">Jane Glover</a> has divided Monteverdi's list of instruments into three main groups: strings, brass and <a href="figured%20bass%23Basso%20continuo">continuo</a>, with a few further items not easily classifiable. The strings grouping is formed from ten members of the violin family ("viole da brazzo"), two <a href="double%20basses">double basses</a> ("contrabassi de viola"), and two <a href="kit%20violin">kit violins</a> ("violini piccoli alla francese"). The "viole da brazzo" are in two five-part ensembles, each comprising two violins, two violas and a cello. The brass group contains four or five trombones (<a href="sackbut">sackbut</a>s), three trumpets and two <a href="cornett">cornett</a>s. The continuo forces include two harpsichords ("duoi gravicembani"), a double harp ("arpa doppia"), two or three <a href="chitarrone">chitarroni</a>, two pipe organs ("organi di legno"), three bass <a href="viola%20da%20gamba">viola da gamba</a>, and a <a href="regal%20%28musical%20instrument%29">regal</a> or small reed organ. Outside of these groupings are two recorders ("flautini alla vigesima secunda"), and possibly one or more <a href="cittern">cittern</a>s—unlisted by Monteverdi, but included in instructions relating to the end of act 4.

Instrumentally, the two worlds represented within the opera are distinctively portrayed. The pastoral world of the fields of <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> is represented by the strings, harpsichords, harp, organs, recorders and chitarroni. The remaining instruments, mainly brass, are associated with the Underworld, though there is not an absolute distinction; strings appear on several occasions in the <a href="Hades">Hades</a> scenes. Within this general ordering, specific instruments or combinations are used to accompany some of the main characters—Orpheus by harp and organ, shepherds by harpsichord and chitarrone, the Underworld gods by trombones and regal. All of these musical distinctions and characterisations were in accordance with the longstanding traditions of the Renaissance orchestra, of which the large "L'Orfeo" ensemble is typical.

Monteverdi instructs his players generally to "[play] the work as simply and correctly as possible, and not with many florid passages or runs". Those playing ornamentation instruments such as strings and flutes are advised to "play nobly, with much invention and variety", but are warned against overdoing it, whereby "nothing is heard but chaos and confusion, offensive to the listener." Since at no time are all the instruments played together, the number of players needed is less than the number of instruments. Harnoncourt indicates that in Monteverdi's day the numbers of players and singers together, and the small rooms in which performances were held, often meant that the audience barely numbered more than the performers.

Of all the instruments used in the original performance of "L'Orfeo" three instruments are no longer used in modern society. These instruments are as followed: The Double Harp, The Cornetto, and the Regal. The <a href="Cornett">Cornetto</a> was a woodwind that was comparable to a trumpet. The <a href="Multi-course%20harp">Double harp</a> was a string instrument that is similar to a modern-day harp. The <a href="Regal%20%28instrument%29">Regal</a> was a keyboard similar to a modern-day piano or organ. These instruments were used almost as characters in the play. Particularly the Regal was used in many scenes depicting <a href="Hades">Hades</a> to symbolize death and mirroring the music of a modern-day funeral procession. 

In his "personaggi" listed in the 1609 score, Monteverdi unaccountably omits La messaggera (the Messenger), and indicates that the final chorus of shepherds who perform the <a href="moresca">moresca</a> (Moorish dance) at the opera's end are a separate group ("che fecero la moresca nel fine"). Little information is available about who sang the various roles in the first performance. A letter published at Mantua in 1612 records that the distinguished tenor and composer <a href="Francesco%20Rasi">Francesco Rasi</a> took part, and it is generally assumed that he sang the title role. Rasi could sing in both the tenor and bass ranges "with exquisite style ... and extraordinary feeling". The involvement in the premiere of a Florentine castrato, <a href="Giovanni%20Gualberto%20Magli">Giovanni Gualberto Magli</a>, is confirmed by correspondence between the Gonzaga princes. Magli sang the prologue, Proserpina and possibly one other role, either La messaggera or Speranza. The musicologist and historian <a href="Hans%20Redlich">Hans Redlich</a> mistakenly allocates Magli to the role of Orfeo.

A clue about who played Euridice is contained in a 1608 letter to Duke Vincenzo. It refers to "that little priest who performed the role of Euridice in the Most Serene Prince's "Orfeo"". This priest was possibly Padre <a href="Girolamo%20Bacchini">Girolamo Bacchini</a>, a castrato known to have had connections to the Mantuan court in the early 17th century. The Monteverdi scholar <a href="Tim%20Carter%20%28musicologist%29">Tim Carter</a> speculates that two prominent Mantuan tenors, Pandolfo Grande and Francesco Campagnola may have sung minor roles in the premiere.

There are solo parts for four shepherds and three spirits. Carter calculates that through the doubling of roles that the text allows, a total of ten singers—three sopranos, two altos, three tenors and two basses—is required for a performance, with the soloists (except Orfeo) also forming the chorus. Carter's suggested role-doublings include La musica with Euridice, Ninfa with Proserpina and La messaggera with Speranza.

The action takes place in two contrasting locations: the fields of <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> (acts 1, 2 and 5) and the Underworld (acts 3 and 4). An instrumental <a href="toccata">toccata</a> (English: "tucket", meaning a flourish on trumpets) precedes the entrance of La musica, representing the "spirit of music", who sings a prologue of five stanzas of verse. After a gracious welcome to the audience she announces that she can, through sweet sounds, "calm every troubled heart." She sings a further paean to the power of music, before introducing the drama's main protagonist, Orfeo, who "held the wild beasts spellbound with his song".

After La musica's final request for silence, the curtain rises on act 1 to reveal a pastoral scene. <a href="Orpheus">Orfeo</a> and <a href="Euridice">Euridice</a> enter together with a chorus of nymphs and shepherds, who act in the manner of a <a href="Greek%20chorus">Greek chorus</a>, commenting on the action both as a group and as individuals. A shepherd announces that this is the couple's wedding day; the chorus responds, first in a stately invocation ("Come, <a href="Hymen%20%28god%29">Hymen</a>, O come") and then in a joyful dance ("Leave the mountains, leave the fountains"). Orfeo and Euridice sing of their love for each other before leaving with most of the group for the wedding ceremony in the temple. Those left on stage sing a brief chorus, commenting on how Orfeo used to be one "for whom sighs were food and weeping was drink" before love brought him to a state of sublime happiness.

Orfeo returns with the main chorus, and sings with them of the beauties of nature. Orfeo then muses on his former unhappiness, but proclaims: "After grief one is more content, after pain one is happier". The mood of contentment is abruptly ended when La messaggera enters, bringing the news that, while gathering flowers, Euridice has received a fatal snakebite. The chorus expresses its anguish: "Ah, bitter happening, ah, impious and cruel fate!", while the Messaggera castigates herself as the bearing of bad tidings ("For ever I will flee, and in a lonely cavern lead a life in keeping with my sorrow"). Orfeo, after venting his grief and incredulity ("Thou art dead, my life, and I am breathing?"), declares his intention to descend into the Underworld and persuade its ruler to allow Euridice to return to life. Otherwise, he says, "I shall remain with thee in the company of death". He departs, and the chorus resumes its lament.

Orfeo is guided by Speranza to the gates of Hades. Having pointed out the words inscribed on the gate ("Abandon hope, all ye who enter here"), Speranza leaves. Orfeo is now confronted with the ferryman <a href="Charon%20%28mythology%29">Caronte</a>, who addresses Orfeo harshly and refuses to take him across the river <a href="Styx">Styx</a>. Orfeo attempts to persuade Caronte by singing a flattering song to him ("Mighty spirit and powerful divinity"), but the ferryman is unmoved. However, when Orfeo takes up his lyre and plays, Caronte is soothed into sleep. Seizing his chance, Orfeo steals the ferryman's boat and crosses the river, entering the Underworld while a chorus of spirits reflects that nature cannot defend herself against man: "He has tamed the sea with fragile wood, and disdained the rage of the winds."

In the Underworld, <a href="Proserpina">Proserpina</a>, Queen of Hades, who has been deeply affected by Orfeo's singing, petitions King <a href="Pluto%20%28mythology%29">Plutone</a>, her husband, for Euridice's release. Moved by her pleas, Plutone agrees on the condition that, as he leads Euridice towards the world, Orfeo must not look back. If he does, "a single glance will condemn him to eternal loss". Orfeo enters, leading Euridice and singing confidently that on that day he will rest on his wife's white bosom. But as he sings a note of doubt creeps in: "Who will assure me that she is following?". Perhaps, he thinks, Plutone, driven by envy, has imposed the condition through spite? Suddenly distracted by an off-stage commotion, Orfeo looks round; immediately, the image of Euridice begins to fade. She sings, despairingly: "Losest thou me through too much love?" and disappears. Orfeo attempts to follow her but is drawn away by an unseen force. The chorus of spirits sings that Orfeo, having overcome Hades, was in turn overcome by his passions.

Back in the fields of Thrace, Orfeo has a long <a href="soliloquy">soliloquy</a> in which he laments his loss, praises Euridice's beauty and resolves that his heart will never again be pierced by Cupid's arrow. An off-stage echo repeats his final phrases. Suddenly, in a cloud, Apollo descends from the heavens and chastises him: "Why dost thou give thyself up as prey to rage and grief?" He invites Orfeo to leave the world and join him in the heavens, where he will recognise Euridice's likeness in the stars. Orfeo replies that it would be unworthy not to follow the counsel of such a wise father, and together they ascend. A shepherds' chorus concludes that "he who sows in suffering shall reap the fruit of every grace", before the opera ends with a vigorous <a href="moresca">moresca</a>.

In Striggio's 1607 libretto, Orfeo's act 5 soliloquy is interrupted, not by Apollo's appearance but by a chorus of <a href="maenad">maenad</a>s or Bacchantes—wild, drunken women—who sing of the "divine fury" of their master, the god <a href="Dionysus">Bacchus</a>. The cause of their wrath is Orfeo and his renunciation of women; he will not escape their heavenly anger, and the longer he evades them the more severe his fate will be. Orfeo leaves the scene and his destiny is left uncertain, as the Bacchantes devote themselves for the rest of the opera to wild singing and dancing in praise of Bacchus. The early music authority <a href="Claude%20V.%20Palisca">Claude Palisca</a> believes that the two endings are not incompatible; Orfeo might evade the fury of the Bacchantes and be rescued by Apollo. However, this alternative ending in any case nearer to original classic myth, where the Bacchantes also appear, but it is made explicit that they torture him to his death, followed by reunion as a shade with Euridice but no apotheosis nor any interaction with Apollo.

The date for the first performance of "L'Orfeo", 24 February 1607, is evidenced by two letters, both dated 23 February. In the first, Francesco Gonzaga informs his brother that the "musical play" will be performed tomorrow; it is clear from earlier correspondence that this refers to "L'Orfeo". The second letter is from a Gonzaga court official, Carlo Magno, and gives more details: "Tomorrow evening the Most Serene Lord the Prince is to sponsor a [play] in a room in the apartments which the Most Serene Lady had the use of ...it should be most unusual, as all the actors are to sing their parts." The "Serene Lady" is Duke Vincenzo's widowed sister Margherita Gonzaga d'Este, who lived within the <a href="Ducal%20palace%2C%20Mantua">Ducal Palace</a>. The room of the premiere cannot be identified with certainty; according to Ringer, it may have been the Galleria dei Fiumi, which has the dimensions to accommodate a stage and orchestra with space for a small audience.

There is no detailed account of the premiere, although Francesco wrote on 1 March that the work had "been to the great satisfaction of all who heard it", and had particularly pleased the Duke. The Mantuan court theologian and poet, Cherubino Ferrari wrote that: "Both poet and musician have depicted the inclinations of the heart so skilfully that it could not have been done better ... The music, observing due propriety, serves the poetry so well that nothing more beautiful is to be heard anywhere". After the premiere Duke Vincenzo ordered a second performance for 1 March; a third performance was planned to coincide with a proposed state visit to Mantua by the <a href="Charles%20Emmanuel%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Savoy">Duke of Savoy</a>. Francesco wrote to the Duke of Tuscany on 8 March, asking if he could retain the services of the castrato Magli for a little longer. However, the visit was cancelled, as was the celebratory performance.

There are suggestions that in the years following the premiere, "L'Orfeo" may have been staged in Florence, Cremona, Milan and Turin, though firmer evidence suggests that the work attracted limited interest beyond the Mantuan court. Francesco may have mounted a production in <a href="Casale%20Monferrato">Casale Monferrato</a>, where he was governor, for the 1609–10 Carnival, and there are indications that the work was performed on several occasions in <a href="Salzburg">Salzburg</a> between 1614 and 1619, under the direction of Francesco Rasi. Years later, during the first flourish of Venetian opera in 1637–43, Monteverdi chose to revive his second opera, "<a href="L%27Arianna">L'Arianna</a>" there, but not "L'Orfeo". There is some evidence of performances shortly after Monteverdi's death: in Geneva in 1643, and in Paris, at the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>, in 1647. Although according to Carter the work was still admired across Italy in the 1650s, it was subsequently forgotten, as largely was Monteverdi, until the revival of interest in his works in the late 19th century.<ref name="Fortune/Whenham">Fortune and Whenham, "Modern editions and performances" pp. 173–81</ref>

After years of neglect, Monteverdi's music began to attract the interest of pioneer music historians in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and from the second quarter of the 19th century onwards he is discussed increasingly in scholarly works. In 1881 a truncated version of the "L'Orfeo" score, intended for study rather than performance, was published in Berlin by <a href="Robert%20Eitner">Robert Eitner</a>. In 1904 the composer <a href="Vincent%20d%27Indy">Vincent d'Indy</a> produced an edition in French, which comprised only act 2, a shortened act 3 and act 4. This edition was the basis of the first public performance of the work in two-and-a-half centuries, a concert performance at d'Indy's <a href="Schola%20Cantorum%20de%20Paris">Schola Cantorum</a> on 25 February 1904. The distinguished writer <a href="Romain%20Rolland">Romain Rolland</a>, who was present, commended d'Indy for bringing the opera to life and returning it "to the beauty it once had, freeing it from the clumsy restorations which have disfigured it"—presumably a reference to Eitner's edition. The d'Indy edition was also the basis of the first modern staged performance of the work, at the <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20R%C3%A9jane">Théâtre Réjane</a>, Paris, on 2 May 1911.

An edition of the score by the minor Italian composer <a href="Giacomo%20Orefice">Giacomo Orefice</a> (Milan, 1909) received several concert performances in Italy and elsewhere before and after the First World War. This edition was the basis of the opera's United States debut, another concert performance at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">New York Met</a> in April 1912. The opera was introduced to London, in d'Indy's edition, when it was sung to piano accompaniment at the Institut Français on 8 March 1924. The first British staged performance, with only small cuts, was given by the Oxford University Operatic Society on 7 December 1925, using an edition prepared for the event by <a href="Jack%20Westrup">Jack Westrup</a>. In the London "<a href="Saturday%20Review%20%28London%29">Saturday Review</a>", music critic <a href="Dyneley%20Hussey">Dyneley Hussey</a> called the occasion "one of the most important events of recent years"; the production had "indicated at once Monteverdi's claim to rank among the great geniuses who have written dramatic music". Westrup's edition was revived in London at the <a href="Scala%20Theatre">Scala Theatre</a> in December 1929, the same year in which the opera received its first US staged performance, at <a href="Smith%20College">Smith College</a>, Northampton, Massachusetts. The three Scala performances resulted in a financial disaster, and the opera was not seen again in Britain for 35 years.

Among a flurry of revivals after 1945 was <a href="Paul%20Hindemith">Paul Hindemith</a>'s edition, a full period reconstruction of the work prepared in 1943, which was staged and recorded at the <a href="Vienna%20Festival">Vienna Festival</a> in 1954. This performance had a great impact on the young <a href="Nikolaus%20Harnoncourt">Nikolaus Harnoncourt</a>, and was hailed as a masterpiece of scholarship and integrity. The first staged New York performance, by the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Opera">New York City Opera</a> under <a href="Leopold%20Stokowski">Leopold Stokowski</a> on 29 September 1960, saw the American operatic debut of <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Souzay">Gérard Souzay</a>, one of several baritones who have sung the role of Orfeo. The theatre was criticised by "New York Times" critic <a href="Harold%20C.%20Schonberg">Harold C. Schonberg</a> because, to accommodate a performance of <a href="Luigi%20Dallapiccola">Luigi Dallapiccola</a>'s contemporary opera "<a href="Il%20prigioniero">Il prigioniero</a>", about a third of "L'Orfeo" was cut. Schonberg wrote: "Even the biggest aria in the opera, "Possente spirito", has a good-sized slash in the middle ... ["L'Orfeo"] is long enough, and important enough, not to mention beautiful enough, to have been the entire evening's opera."

By the latter part of the 20th century the opera was being shown all over the world. In 1965, <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells%20Theatre">Sadler's Wells</a>, forerunner of <a href="English%20National%20Opera">English National Opera</a> (ENO), staged the first of many ENO presentations which would continue into the 21st century. Among various celebrations marking the opera's 400th anniversary in 2007 were a semi-staged performance at the <a href="Teatro%20Bibiena">Teatro Bibiena</a> in <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a>, a full-scale production by the English Bach Festival (EBF) at the Whitehall Banqueting House in London on 7 February, and an unconventional production by <a href="Glimmerglass%20Festival">Glimmerglass Opera</a> in <a href="Cooperstown%2C%20New%20York">Cooperstown, New York</a>, conducted by Antony Walker and directed by <a href="Christopher%20Alden%20%28director%29">Christopher Alden</a>. On 6 May 2010 the <a href="British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">BBC</a> broadcast a performance of the opera from <a href="La%20Scala">La Scala</a>, <a href="Milan">Milan</a>. Despite the reluctance of some major opera houses to stage "L'Orfeo", it is a popular work with the leading Baroque ensembles. During the period 2008–10, the French-based <a href="Les%20Arts%20Florissants%20%28ensemble%29">Les Arts Florissants</a>, under its director <a href="William%20Christie%20%28musician%29">William Christie</a>, presented the Monteverdi trilogy of operas ("L'Orfeo", "<a href="Il%20ritorno%20d%27Ulisse%20in%20patria">Il ritorno d'Ulisse</a>" and "<a href="L%27incoronazione%20di%20Poppea">L'incoronazione di Poppea</a>") in a series of performances at the <a href="Teatro%20Real">Teatro Real</a> in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>,

"L'Orfeo" is, in Redlich's analysis, the product of two musical epochs. It combines elements of the traditional <a href="madrigal%20%28music%29">madrigal</a> style of the 16th century with those of the emerging Florentine mode, in particular the use of <a href="recitative">recitative</a> and <a href="monody">monodic</a> singing as developed by the Camerata and their successors. In this new style, the text dominates the music; while <a href="sinfonia">sinfonia</a>s and instrumental <a href="ritornello">ritornelli</a> illustrate the action, the audience's attention is always drawn primarily to the words. The singers are required to do more than produce pleasant vocal sounds; they must represent their characters in depth and convey appropriate emotions.

Monterverdi's recitative style was influenced by Peri's, in "Euridice", although in "L'Orfeo" recitative is less preponderant than was usual in dramatic music at this time. It accounts for less than a quarter of the first act's music, around a third of the second and third acts, and a little under half in the final two acts.

The importance of "L'Orfeo" is not that it was the first work of its kind, but that it was the first attempt to apply the full resources of the art of music, as then evolved, to the nascent genre of opera. In particular, Monteverdi made daring innovations in the use of <a href="polyphony">polyphony</a>, of which <a href="Giovanni%20Pierluigi%20da%20Palestrina">Palestrina</a> had been the principal exponent. In "L'Orfeo", Monteverdi extends the rules, beyond the conventions which polyphonic composers, faithful to Palestrina, had previously considered as sacrosanct. Monteverdi was not in the generally understood sense an orchestrator; Ringer finds that it is the element of instrumental improvisation that makes each performance of a Monteverdi opera a "unique experience, and separates his work from the later operatic canon."

The opera begins with a martial-sounding <a href="toccata">toccata</a> for trumpets which is repeated twice. When played on period wind instruments the sound can be startling to modern audiences; Redlich calls it "shattering". Such flourishes were the standard signal for the commencement of performances at the Mantuan court; the opening chorus of Monteverdi's <a href="Vespro%20della%20Beata%20Vergine%201610">1610 Vespers</a>, also composed for Gonzaga's court, employs the same fanfare. The toccata acted as a salute to the Duke; according to Donington, if it had not been written, precedent would have required it to be improvised. As the brass sound of the toccata fades, it is replaced by the gentler tone of the strings ritornello which introduces La musica's prologue. The ritornello is repeated in shortened form between each of the prologue's five verses, and in full after the final verse. Its function within the opera as a whole is to represent the "power of music"; as such it is heard at the end of act 2, and again at the beginning of act 5, one of the earliest examples of an operatic <a href="leitmotif">leitmotiv</a>. It is temporally structured as a palindrome and its form of strophic variations allows Monteverdi to carefully shape musical time for expressive and structural purposes in the context of "seconda prattica".

After the prologue, act 1 follows in the form of a pastoral idyll. Two choruses, one solemn and one jovial are repeated in reverse order around the central love-song "Rosa del ciel" ("Rose of the heavens"), followed by the shepherds' songs of praise. The buoyant mood continues into act 2, with song and dance music influenced, according to Harnoncourt, by Monteverdi's experience of French music. The sudden entrance of La messaggera with the doleful news of Euridice's death, and the confusion and grief which follow, are musically reflected by harsh dissonances and the juxtaposition of keys. The music remains in this vein until the act ends with La musica's ritornello, a hint that the "power of music" may yet bring about a triumph over death. Monteverdi's instructions as the act concludes are that the violins, the organ and harpsichord become silent and that the music is taken up by the trombones, the <a href="cornett">cornett</a>s and the <a href="regal%20%28musical%20instrument%29">regal</a>, as the scene changes to the Underworld.

The centrepiece of act 3, perhaps of the entire opera, is Orfeo's extended aria "Possente spirto e formidabil nume" ("Mighty spirit and powerful divinity"), by which he attempts to persuade Caronte to allow him to enter Hades. Monteverdi's vocal embellishments and virtuoso accompaniment provide what Carter describes as "one of the most compelling visual and aural representations" in early opera. Instrumental colour is provided by a <a href="chitarrone">chitarrone</a>, a pipe-organ, two violins, two cornetts and a double-harp. This array, according to music historian and analyst <a href="John%20Whenham">John Whenham</a>, is intended to suggest that Orfeo is harnessing all the available forces of music to support his plea. In act 4 the impersonal coldness of the Underworld is broken by the warmth of Proserpina's singing on behalf of Orfeo, a warmth that is retained until the dramatic moment at which Orfeo "looks back". The cold sounds of the sinfonia from the beginning of act 3 then remind us that the Underworld is, after all, entirely devoid of human feeling. The brief final act, which sees Orfeo's rescue and metamorphosis, is framed by the final appearance of La musica's ritornello and the lively <a href="moresca">moresca</a> that ends the opera. This dance, says Ringer, recalls the jigs danced at the end of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s tragedies, and provides a means of bringing the audience back to their everyday world, "just as the toccata had led them into another realm some two hours before. The toccata and the moresca unite courtly reality with operatic illusion."

The first recording of "L'Orfeo" was issued in 1939, a freely adapted version of Monteverdi's music by <a href="Giacomo%20Benvenuti">Giacomo Benvenuti</a>, given by the orchestra of <a href="La%20Scala">La Scala</a> Milan conducted by <a href="Ferrucio%20Calusio">Ferrucio Calusio</a>. In 1949, for the recording of the complete opera by the Berlin Radio Orchestra under Helmut Koch, the new medium of <a href="LP%20record">long-playing records</a> (LPs) was used. The advent of LP recordings was, as <a href="Harold%20C.%20Schonberg">Harold C. Schonberg</a> later wrote, an important factor in the postwar revival of interest in Renaissance and Baroque music, and from the mid-1950s recordings of "L'Orfeo" have been issued on many labels. The 1969 recording by Nikolaus Harnoncourt and the Vienna Concentus Musicus, using Harnoncourt's edition based on period instruments, was praised for "making Monteverdi's music sound something like the way he imagined". In 1981 Siegfried Heinrich, with the Early Music Studio of the Hesse Chamber Orchestra, recorded a version which re-created the original Striggio libretto ending, adding music from Monteverdi's 1616 ballet "Tirsi e Clori" for the Bacchante scenes. Among more recent recordings, that of <a href="Emmanuelle%20Ha%C3%AFm">Emmanuelle Haïm</a> in 2004 has been praised for its dramatic effect.

After the publication of the "L'Orfeo" score in 1609, the same publisher (<a href="Ricciardo%20Amadino">Ricciardo Amadino</a> of Venice) brought it out again in 1615. Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first "modern" edition of "L'Orfeo" in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including <a href="Carl%20Orff">Carl Orff</a> (1923 and 1939) and <a href="Ottorino%20Respighi">Ottorino Respighi</a> in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.

In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of <a href="Jack%20Westrup">Jack Westrup</a> used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and <a href="Gian%20Francesco%20Malipiero">Gian Francesco Malipiero</a>'s 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from <a href="August%20Wenzinger">August Wenzinger</a> that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by <a href="Raymond%20Leppard">Raymond Leppard</a> (1965), <a href="Denis%20Stevens">Denis Stevens</a> (1967), <a href="Nikolaus%20Harnoncourt">Nikolaus Harnoncourt</a> (1969), <a href="Jane%20Glover">Jane Glover</a> (1975), <a href="Roger%20Norrington">Roger Norrington</a> (1976) and <a href="John%20Eliot%20Gardiner">John Eliot Gardiner</a>. Only the composers <a href="Valentino%20Bucchi">Valentino Bucchi</a> (1967), <a href="Bruno%20Maderna">Bruno Maderna</a> (1967) and <a href="Luciano%20Berio">Luciano Berio</a> (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra. In the 21st century editions continue to be produced, often for use in conjunction with a particular performance or recording.

Astrophysics Data System

The Astrophysics Data System (ADS) is an online database of over eight million <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a> and <a href="physics">physics</a> papers from both <a href="peer%20review">peer review</a>ed and non-peer reviewed sources. <a href="abstract%20%28summary%29">Abstracts</a> are available free online for almost all articles, and full scanned articles are available in <a href="Graphics%20Interchange%20Format">Graphics Interchange Format</a> (GIF) and <a href="Portable%20Document%20Format">Portable Document Format</a> (PDF) for older articles. It was developed by the <a href="National%20Aeronautics%20and%20Space%20Administration">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> (NASA), and is managed by the <a href="Harvard%E2%80%93Smithsonian%20Center%20for%20Astrophysics">Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</a>.

ADS is a powerful research tool and has had a significant impact on the efficiency of astronomical research since it was launched in 1992. Literature searches that previously would have taken days or weeks can now be carried out in seconds via the ADS search engine, which is custom-built for astronomical needs. Studies have found that the benefit to astronomy of the ADS is equivalent to several hundred million <a href="USD">US dollars</a> annually, and the system is estimated to have tripled the readership of astronomical journals.

Use of ADS is almost universal among astronomers worldwide, and therefore ADS usage statistics can be used to analyze global trends in astronomical research. These studies have revealed that the amount of research an astronomer carries out is related to the per capita <a href="gross%20domestic%20product">gross domestic product</a> (GDP) of the country in which he/she is based, and that the number of astronomers in a country is proportional to the GDP of that country, so the total amount of research done in a country is proportional to the square of its GDP divided by its population.

For many years, a growing problem in astronomical research (as in other academic disciplines) was that the number of papers published in the major astronomical journals was increasing steadily, meaning astronomers were able to read less and less of the latest research findings. During the 1980s, astronomers saw that the nascent technologies which formed the basis of the <a href="Internet">Internet</a> could eventually be used to build an electronic indexing system of astronomical research papers which would allow astronomers to keep abreast of a much greater range of research.

The first suggestion of a database of journal paper abstracts was made at a conference on "Astronomy from Large Data-bases" held in <a href="Garching%20bei%20M%C3%BCnchen">Garching bei München</a> in 1987. Initial development of an electronic system for accessing astrophysical abstracts took place during the following two years; in 1991 discussions took place on how to integrate ADS with the <a href="SIMBAD">SIMBAD</a> database, containing all available catalog designations for objects outside the <a href="solar%20system">solar system</a>, to create a system where astronomers could search for all the papers written about a given object.

An initial version of ADS, with a database consisting of 40 papers, was created as a <a href="proof%20of%20concept">proof of concept</a> in 1988, and the ADS database was successfully connected with the SIMBAD database in the summer of 1993. The creators believed this was the first use of the Internet to allow simultaneous querying of transatlantic scientific databases. Until 1994, the service was available via proprietary network software, but it was transferred to the nascent <a href="World%20Wide%20Web">World Wide Web</a> early that year. The number of users of the service quadrupled in the five weeks following the introduction of the ADS web-based service.

At first, the journal articles available via ADS were <a href="Image%20scanner">scan</a>ned <a href="bitmap">bitmap</a>s created from the paper journals, but from 1995 onwards, the "<a href="Astrophysical%20Journal">Astrophysical Journal</a>" began to publish an on-line edition, soon followed by the other main journals such as "<a href="Astronomy%20and%20Astrophysics">Astronomy and Astrophysics</a>" and the "<a href="Monthly%20Notices%20of%20the%20Royal%20Astronomical%20Society">Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</a>". ADS provided links to these electronic editions from their first appearance. Since about 1995, the number of ADS users has doubled roughly every two years. ADS now has agreements with almost all astronomical journals, who supply abstracts. Scanned articles from as far back as the early 19th century are available via the service, which now contains over eight million documents. The service is distributed worldwide, with twelve <a href="Web%20mirror">mirror sites</a> in twelve countries on five continents, with the database synchronized by means of weekly updates using <a href="rsync">rsync</a>, a mirroring utility which allows updates to only the portions of the database which have changed. All updates are triggered centrally, but they initiate scripts at the mirror sites which "pull" updated data from the main ADS servers.

Papers are indexed within the database by their bibliographic record, containing the details of the journal they were published in and various associated <a href="metadata">metadata</a>, such as author lists, <a href="Image%20resolution">reference</a>s and <a href="citation">citation</a>s. Originally this data was stored in <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> format, but eventually the limitations of this encouraged the database maintainers to migrate all records to an <a href="XML">XML</a> (Extensible Markup Language) format in 2000. Bibliographic records are now stored as an XML element, with sub-elements for the various metadata.

Since the advent of online editions of journals, abstracts are loaded into the ADS on or before the publication date of articles, with the full journal text available to subscribers. Older articles have been scanned, and an abstract is created using <a href="optical%20character%20recognition">optical character recognition</a> software. Scanned articles from before about 1995 are usually available free, by agreement with the journal publishers.

Scanned articles are stored in <a href="TIFF">TIFF</a> format, at both medium and high <a href="Image%20resolution">resolution</a>. The TIFF files are converted on demand into GIF files for on-screen viewing, and <a href="PDF">PDF</a> or <a href="PostScript">PostScript</a> files for printing. The generated files are then <a href="cache%20%28computing%29">cached</a> to eliminate needlessly frequent regenerations for popular articles. As of 2000, ADS contained 250 <a href="gigabyte">GB</a> of scans, which consisted of 1,128,955 article pages comprising 138,789 articles. By 2005 this had grown to 650 GB, and is expected to grow further, to about 900 GB by 2007. No further information has been published.

The database initially contained only astronomical references, but has now grown to incorporate three databases, covering <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>
(including planetary sciences and solar physics) references, <a href="physics">physics</a> (including instrumentation and geosciences) references, as well as preprints of scientific papers from <a href="arXiv">arXiv</a>. The astronomy database is by far the most advanced and its use accounts for about 85% of the total ADS usage. Articles are assigned to the different databases according to the subject rather than the journal they are published in, so that articles from any one journal might appear in all three subject databases. The separation of the databases allows searching in each discipline to be tailored, so that words can automatically be given different <a href="weight%20function">weight function</a>s in different database searches, depending on how common they are in the relevant field.

Data in the preprint archive is updated daily from the <a href="arXiv">arXiv</a>, the main repository of physics and astronomy preprints. The advent of preprint servers has, like ADS, had a significant impact on the rate of astronomical research, as papers are often made available from preprint servers weeks or months before they are published in the journals. The incorporation of preprints from the arXiv into ADS means that the search engine can return the most current research available, with the caveat that preprints may not have been peer reviewed or <a href="proofread">proofread</a> to the required standard for publication in the main journals. ADS's database links preprints with subsequently published articles wherever possible, so that citation and reference searches will return links to the journal article where the preprint was cited.

The software runs on a system that was written specifically for it, allowing for extensive customization for astronomical needs that would not have been possible with general purpose <a href="database">database</a> software. The scripts are designed to be as <a href="platform%20independent">platform independent</a> as possible, given the need to facilitate mirroring on different systems around the world, although the growing use of <a href="Linux">Linux</a> as the <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a> of choice within astronomy has led to increasing optimization of the scripts for installation on that platform.

The main ADS server is located at the Harvard-Smithsonian <a href="Center%20for%20Astrophysics">Center for Astrophysics</a> in <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>, and is a dual 64-bit X86 <a href="Intel">Intel</a> server with two quad-core 3.0 <a href="GHz">GHz</a> <a href="Central%20processing%20unit">CPU</a>s and 32 GB of <a href="random%20access%20memory">RAM</a>, running the <a href="CentOS">CentOS</a> 5.4 <a href="Linux">Linux</a> distribution. Mirrors are located in Brazil, China, Chile, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the Ukraine.

ADS currently receives abstracts or tables of contents from almost two hundred journal sources. The service may receive data referring to the same article from multiple sources, and creates one bibliographic reference based on the most accurate data from each source. The common use of <a href="TeX">TeX</a> and <a href="LaTeX">LaTeX</a> by almost all scientific journals greatly facilitates the incorporation of bibliographic data into the system in a standardized format, and importing <a href="HTML">HTML</a>-coded web-based articles is also simple. ADS utilizes <a href="Perl">Perl</a> scripts for importing, processing and standardizing bibliographic data.

The apparently mundane task of converting author names into a standard "<a href="Surname">Surname</a>, Initial" format is actually one of the more difficult to automate, due to the wide variety of naming conventions around the world and the possibility that a given name such as Davis could be a <a href="first%20name">first name</a>, <a href="middle%20name">middle name</a> or surname. The accurate conversion of names requires a detailed knowledge of the names of authors active in astronomy, and ADS maintains an extensive database of author names, which is also used in searching the database (see below).

For electronic articles, a list of the references given at the end of the article is easily extracted. For scanned articles, reference extraction relies on OCR. The reference database can then be "inverted" to list the citations for each paper in the database. Citation lists have been used in the past to identify popular articles missing from the database; mostly these were from before 1975 and have now been added to the system.

The database now contains over eight million articles. In the cases of the major journals of astronomy ("<a href="Astrophysical%20Journal">Astrophysical Journal</a>", "<a href="Astronomical%20Journal">Astronomical Journal</a>", "<a href="Astronomy%20and%20Astrophysics">Astronomy and Astrophysics</a>", "<a href="Publications%20of%20the%20Astronomical%20Society%20of%20the%20Pacific">Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific</a>" and the "<a href="Monthly%20Notices%20of%20the%20Royal%20Astronomical%20Society">Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</a>"), coverage is complete, with all issues indexed from number 1 to the present. These journals account for about two-thirds of the papers in the database, with the rest consisting of papers published in over 100 other journals from around the world, as well as in conference proceedings.

While the database contains the complete contents of all the major journals and many minor ones as well, its coverage of references and citations is much less complete. References in and citations of articles in the major journals are fairly complete, but references such as "private communication", "in press" or "in preparation" cannot be matched, and author errors in reference listings also introduce potential errors. Astronomical papers may cite and be cited by articles in journals which fall outside the scope of ADS, such as <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>, <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> or <a href="biology">biology</a> journals.

Since its inception, the ADS has developed a highly complex search engine to query the abstract and object databases. The search engine is tailor-made for searching astronomical abstracts, and the engine and its <a href="user%20interface">user interface</a> assume that the user is well-versed in astronomy and able to interpret search results which are designed to return more than just the most relevant papers. The database can be queried for author names, <a href="astronomical%20object">astronomical object</a> names, title words, and words in the abstract text, and results can be filtered according to a number of criteria. It works by first gathering synonyms and simplifying search terms as described above, and then generating an "inverted file", which is a list of all the documents matching each search term. The user-selected logic and filters are then applied to this inverted list to generate the final search results.

The system indexes author names by surname and initials, and accounts for the possible variations in spelling of names using a list of variations. This is common in the case of names including accents such as <a href="Umlaut%20%28diacritic%29">umlaut</a>s and transliterations from <a href="Arabic%20alphabet">Arabic</a> or <a href="Cyrillic%20script">Cyrillic</a> script. An example of an entry in the author synonym list is:

The capability to search for papers on specific astronomical objects is one of ADS's most powerful tools. The system uses data from the <a href="SIMBAD">SIMBAD</a>, the <a href="NASA/IPAC%20Extragalactic%20Database">NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database</a>, the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> Circulars and the <a href="Lunar%20and%20Planetary%20Institute">Lunar and Planetary Institute</a> to identify papers referring to a given object, and can also search by object position, listing papers which concern objects within a 10 <a href="arcminute">arcminute</a> radius of a given <a href="Right%20Ascension">Right Ascension</a> and <a href="Declination">Declination</a>. These databases combine the many catalogue designations an object might have, so that a search for the <a href="Pleiades">Pleiades</a> will also find papers which list the famous <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> in <a href="Taurus%20%28constellation%29">Taurus</a> under any of its other catalog designations or popular names, such as M45, the Seven Sisters or Melotte 22.

The search engine first filters search terms in several ways. An M followed by a space or <a href="hyphen">hyphen</a> has the space or hyphen removed, so that searching for <a href="Messier%20catalogue">Messier catalogue</a> objects is simplified and a user input of M45, M 45 or M-45 all result in the same query being executed; similarly, <a href="New%20General%20Catalogue">NGC</a> designations and common search terms such as <a href="Comet%20Shoemaker-Levy%209">Shoemaker Levy</a> and <a href="T%20Tauri%20star">T Tauri</a> are stripped of spaces. Unimportant words such as AT, OR and TO are stripped out, although in some cases <a href="case%20sensitivity">case sensitivity</a> is maintained, so that while and is ignored, And is converted to "<a href="Andromeda%20%28constellation%29">Andromeda</a>e", and Her is converted to "<a href="Hercules%20%28constellation%29">Herculis</a>", but her is ignored.

Once search terms have been pre-processed, the database is queried with the revised search term, as well as synonyms for it. As well as simple <a href="synonym">synonym</a> replacement such as searching for both <a href="plural">plural</a> and <a href="Grammatical%20number">singular</a> forms, ADS also searches for a large number of specifically astronomical synonyms. For example, <a href="spectrograph">spectrograph</a> and <a href="spectroscope">spectroscope</a> have basically the same meaning, and in an astronomical context <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a> and <a href="Abundance%20of%20the%20chemical%20elements">abundance</a> are also synonymous. ADS's synonym list was created manually, by grouping the list of words in the database according to similar meanings.

As well as <a href="English%20language">English language</a> synonyms, ADS also searches for English translations of foreign search terms and vice versa, so that a search for the <a href="French%20language">French</a> word "soleil" retrieves references to <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, and papers in languages other than English can be returned by English search terms.

Synonym replacement can be disabled if required, so that a rare term which is a synonym of a much more common term (such as '<a href="dateline">dateline</a>' rather than '<a href="calendar%20date">date</a>') can be searched for specifically.

The search engine allows selection <a href="logic">logic</a> both within fields and between fields. Search terms in each field can be combined with OR, AND, simple logic or <a href="Boolean%20logic">Boolean logic</a>, and the user can specify which fields must be matched in the search results. This allows complex searches to be built; for example, the user could search for papers concerning <a href="NGC%206543">NGC 6543</a> OR <a href="NGC%207009">NGC 7009</a>, with the paper titles containing (radius OR velocity) AND NOT (abundance OR temperature).

Search results can be filtered according to a number of criteria, including specifying a range of years such as '1945 to 1975', '2000 to the present day' or 'before 1900', and what type of journal the article appears in – non-peer reviewed articles such as <a href="academic%20conference">conference</a> proceedings can be excluded or specifically searched for, or specific journals can be included in or excluded from the search.

Although it was conceived as a means of accessing abstracts and papers, ADS provides a substantial amount of ancillary information along with search results. For each abstract returned, links are provided to other papers in the database which are referenced, and which cite the paper, and a link is provided to a preprint, where one exists. The system also generates a link to 'also-read' articles – that is, those which have been most commonly accessed by those reading the article. In this way, an ADS user can determine which papers are of most interest to astronomers who are interested in the subject of a given paper.

Also returned are links to the SIMBAD and/or NASA Extragalactic Database object name databases, via which a user can quickly find out basic observational data about the objects analyzed in a paper, and find further papers on those objects.

ADS is almost universally used as a research tool among astronomers, and there are several studies that have estimated quantitatively how much more efficient ADS has made astronomy; one estimated that ADS increased the efficiency of astronomical research by 333 full-time equivalent research years per year, and another found that in 2002 its effect was equivalent to 736 full-time researchers, or all the astronomical research done in France. ADS has allowed literature searches that would previously have taken days or weeks to carry out to be completed in seconds, and it is estimated that ADS has increased the readership and use of the astronomical literature by a factor of about three since its inception.

In monetary terms, this increase in efficiency represents a considerable amount. There are about 12,000 active astronomical researchers worldwide, so ADS is the equivalent of about 5% of the working population of astronomers. The global astronomical research budget is estimated at between 4,000 and US$5,000 million, so the value of ADS to astronomy would be about 200–250 million USD annually. Its operating budget is a small fraction of this amount.

The great importance of ADS to astronomers has been recognized by the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, the <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a> of which has commended ADS on its work and success, particularly noting its importance to astronomers in the developing world, in reports of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Committee%20on%20the%20Peaceful%20Uses%20of%20Outer%20Space">United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space</a>. A 2002 report by a visiting committee to the Center for Astrophysics, meanwhile, said that the service had "revolutionized the use of the astronomical literature", and was "probably the most valuable single contribution to astronomy research that the CfA has made in its lifetime".

Because it is used almost universally by astronomers, ADS can reveal much about how astronomical research is distributed around the world. Most users access the system from institutes of higher education, whose <a href="IP%20address">IP address</a> can easily be used to determine the user's geographical location. Studies reveal that the highest per-capita users of ADS are France and <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>-based astronomers, and while more developed countries (measured by <a href="GDP%20per%20capita">GDP per capita</a>) use the system more than less developed countries; the relationship between GDP per capita and ADS use is not linear. The range of ADS usage per capita far exceeds the range of GDPs per capita, and basic research carried out in a country, as measured by ADS usage, has been found to be proportional to the square of the country's GDP divided by its population.

ADS usage statistics also suggest that astronomers in more developed countries tend to be more productive than those in less developed countries. The amount of basic research carried out is proportional to the number of astronomers in a country multiplied by the GDP per capita. Statistics also imply that astronomers in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>an cultures carry out about three times as much research as those in <a href="Culture%20of%20Asia">Asian culture</a>s, perhaps suggesting cultural differences in the importance attached to astronomical research.

ADS has also been used to show that the fraction of single-author astronomy papers has decreased substantially since 1975 and that astronomical papers with more than 50 authors have become more common since 1990.

HMS Neptune (1909)

HMS "Neptune" was a <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a> built for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in the first decade of the 20th century, the sole ship of her <a href="ship%20class">class</a>. She was the first British battleship to be built with <a href="superfiring">superfiring</a> guns. Shortly after her completion in 1911, she carried out trials of an experimental <a href="Fire-control%20system">fire-control</a> <a href="Director%20%28military%29">director</a> and then became the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a>. "Neptune" became a <a href="private%20ship">private ship</a> in early 1914 and was assigned to the <a href="1st%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Battle Squadron</a>.

The ship became part of the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> when it was formed shortly after the beginning of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in August 1914. Aside from participating in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> in May 1916, and the inconclusive <a href="Action%20of%2019%20August%201916">Action of 19 August</a> several months later, her service during the war generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. "Neptune" was deemed obsolete after the war and was reduced to <a href="Reserve%20fleet">reserve</a> before being sold for <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a> in 1922 and subsequently broken up.

The <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launch</a> of in 1906 precipitated a <a href="Anglo-German%20naval%20arms%20race">naval arms race</a> when Germany accelerated its <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">naval construction plans</a> in response. Despite this sudden expansion of another nation's fleet, the British <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> felt secure in the knowledge that Germany would only have four modern capital ships in commission by 1910, while the Royal Navy would have eleven. Accordingly they only proposed the construction of a single battleship and a <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> in the 1908–1909 naval budget that they sent to the government in December. The <a href="Liberal%20government%2C%201905%E2%80%931915">Liberals</a>, committed to reducing military expenditures and increasing social welfare spending, wished to cut the budget by <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>1,340,000 below the previous year's budget, but were ultimately persuaded not to do so after the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, Sir <a href="Henry%20Campbell-Bannerman">Henry Campbell-Bannerman</a>, was thoroughly briefed on each part of the budget in February 1908. The debates over the budget in March were heated; critics were dissatisfied with the number of ships being built, arguing that the Government was too complacent about the superiority of the Royal Navy over the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a>, but they were satisfied when <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">H. H. Asquith</a>, <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, filling in for the fatally-ill Prime Minister, announced that the government was prepared to build as many dreadnoughts as required to negate any possible German superiority as of the end of 1911.

"Neptune" was an improved version of the preceding with additional armour and the armament rearranged for greater efficiency. She was the first British dreadnought that differed in her <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a> layout from "Dreadnought". Unlike the earlier ships, her <a href="wing%20turret">wing turret</a>s were staggered "<a href="En%20echelon%20%28turret%20arrangement%29">en echelon</a>" so that all five turrets could shoot on the <a href="broadside">broadside</a>, although in practise the <a href="muzzle%20blast">blast</a> damage to the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> and boats made this impractical except in an emergency. This was done to match the 10-gun broadside of the latest foreign designs like the American , although the all-centreline turret configuration of the American ships eliminated the blast problems that compromised the effectiveness of the "en echelon" arrangement. "Neptune" was also the first British dreadnought to be equipped with superfiring turrets, in an effort to shorten the ship and reduce costs. A further saving in length was achieved by siting the ship's boats on <a href="girder">girder</a>s over the two wing turrets to reduce the length of the vessel. The drawback to this arrangement was that if the girders were damaged during combat, they could fall onto the turrets, immobilising them. The <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> was also situated above the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a>, which similarly risked being obscured if the bridge collapsed.

"Neptune" had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a deep <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . She <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at normal load and at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. The ship had a <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a> of at deep load. Her crew numbered about 756 officers and <a href="naval%20rating">ratings</a> upon completion and 813 in 1914.

The ship was powered by two sets of <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> <a href="direct-drive">direct-drive</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each of which was housed in a separate <a href="engine%20room">engine room</a>. The outer <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>s were coupled to the high-pressure turbines and these exhausted into low-pressure turbines which drove the inner shafts. The turbines used steam from eighteen <a href="Yarrow%20boiler">Yarrow boiler</a>s at a working pressure of . They were rated at and gave "Neptune" a maximum speed of . She carried a maximum of of coal and an additional of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. This gave her a range of at a cruising speed of .

"Neptune" was equipped with ten 50-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">calibre</a> <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23BL">breech-loading (BL)</a> <a href="BL%2012%20inch%20Mk%20XI%20-%20XII%20naval%20gun">Mark XI guns</a> in five hydraulically powered twin-gun turrets, three along the centreline and the remaining two as wing turrets. The centreline turrets were designated 'A', 'X' and 'Y', from front to rear, and the <a href="port%20and%20starboard">port and starboard</a> wing turrets were 'P' and 'Q' respectively. The guns had a maximum <a href="elevation%20%28ballistics%29">elevation</a> of +20° which gave them a range of . They fired projectiles at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of at a rate of two <a href="Cartridge%20%28firearms%29">rounds</a> per minute. The ship carried 100 shells per gun.
"Neptune" was the first British dreadnought with her <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> of sixteen 50-calibre <a href="BL%204%20inch%20naval%20gun%20Mk%20VII">BL four-inch (102 mm) Mark VII</a> guns installed in unshielded single mounts in the superstructure. This change was made to address the problems that plagued the turret-roof locations used in earlier battleships. Notably, the exposed guns were difficult to work when the main armament was in action as was replenishing their ammunition. Furthermore, the guns could not be centrally controlled to coordinate fire at the most dangerous targets. The guns had a maximum elevation of +15° which gave them a range of . They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . They were provided with 150 rounds per gun. Four <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing</a> <a href="QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss">three-pounder () Hotchkiss</a> <a href="saluting%20gun">saluting gun</a>s were also carried. The ships were equipped with three <a href="British%2018%20inch%20torpedo">18-inch (450 mm)</a> submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, one on each broadside and another in the <a href="stern">stern</a>, for which 18 <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es were provided.

The control positions for the main armament were located in the <a href="Top%20%28sailing%20ship%29">spotting top</a>s at the head of the fore and <a href="mainmast">mainmast</a>s. Data from a <a href="Barr%20and%20Stroud">Barr and Stroud</a> <a href="coincidence%20rangefinder">coincidence rangefinder</a> located at each control position was input into a <a href="Dumaresq">Dumaresq</a> <a href="mechanical%20computer">mechanical computer</a> and electrically transmitted to <a href="Vickers%20range%20clock">Vickers range clock</a>s located in the transmitting station located beneath each position on the main deck, where it was converted into elevation and <a href="Deflection%20%28ballistics%29">deflection</a> data for use by the guns. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The turrets, transmitting stations, and control positions could be connected in almost any combination.

"Neptune" was the first British dreadnought to be built with a gunnery director, albeit an experimental <a href="prototype">prototype</a> designed by <a href="Vice-Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Vice-Admiral</a> Sir <a href="Percy%20Scott">Percy Scott</a>. This was mounted on the foremast, underneath the spotting top and electrically provided data to the turrets via pointer on a <a href="dial%20%28measurement%29">dial</a>, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the <a href="ship%20motions">roll</a> on the dispersion of the shells. The ship's director was later replaced as a new one was ordered in 1913 and installed by May 1916.

Additional nine-foot rangefinders, protected by armoured hoods, were added for each gun turret in late 1914. Furthermore, the ship was fitted with Mark I <a href="Frederic%20Charles%20Dreyer%23Dreyer%20Fire%20Control%20Table">Dreyer Fire-control Table</a>s by early 1916 in each transmission station that combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock.

"Neptune" had a <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="Belt%20armor">belt</a> of <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armour">Krupp cemented armour</a> that was thick between the fore and aftmost <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s that reduced to before it reached the ships' ends. It covered the side of the <a href="hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> from the middle <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> down to below the waterline where it thinned to <a href="amidships">amidships</a>. Above this was a <a href="strake">strake</a> of 8-inch armour. The forward oblique <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>s connected the amidships portion of waterline and upper armour belts once they reached the outer portions of the forward barbette. Similarly the aft bulkhead connected the armour belts to the rearmost barbette, although it was 8 inches thick. The three centreline barbettes were protected by armour thick above the main deck and thinned to below it. The wing barbettes were similar except that they had 10 inches of armour on their outer faces. The gun turrets had faces and sides with 3-inch roofs.

The three armoured decks ranged in thickness from with the greater thicknesses outside the central <a href="armoured%20citadel">armoured citadel</a>. The front and sides of the conning tower were protected by 11-inch plates, although the rear and roof were 8 inches and 3 inches thick respectively. The torpedo control tower aft had 3-inch sides and a 2-inch roof. "Neptune" had two longitudinal anti-<a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a>s that ranged in thickness from and extended from the forward end of 'A' barbette to the end of 'Y' <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>. She was the first British dreadnought to protect her boiler uptakes with 1-inch armour plates. The compartments between the <a href="boiler%20room%20%28ship%29">boiler room</a>s were used as <a href="coal%20bunker">coal bunker</a>s.

<a href="Gun%20shield">Gun shield</a>s were fitted to the forward four-inch guns after September 1913 and the upper forward four-inch guns were enclosed. In 1914–1915, the upper amidships four-inch guns were enclosed, the forward boat girder was removed and a three-inch (76 mm) <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft (AA) gun</a> was added on the <a href="quarterdeck">quarterdeck</a>. Approximately of deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. By early 1917, four guns had been removed from the aft superstructure and a single four-inch AA gun had been added, for a total of a dozen four-inch guns. The stern torpedo tube was removed in 1917–1918 as was the aft spotting top. A high-angle <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a> was fitted on the remaining spotting top and a <a href="Flight%20deck%23Early%20flight%20decks">flying-off platform</a> was installed on the 'A' turret in 1918.

"Neptune", named after <a href="Neptune%20%28mythology%29">the Roman god of the sea</a>, was ordered on 14 December 1908. She was <a href="laid%20down">laid down</a> at <a href="HMNB%20Portsmouth">HM Dockyard, Portsmouth</a> on 19 January 1909, launched on 30 September and completed in January 1911 at the cost of £1,668,916, including her armament. The ship was <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 19 January 1911 for trials with Scott's experimental gunnery director that lasted until 11 March and were witnessed by <a href="Rear-Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Rear-Admiral</a> Sir <a href="John%20Jellicoe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Jellicoe">John Jellicoe</a>, commander of the <a href="Atlantic%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Atlantic Fleet</a>. "Neptune" relieved "Dreadnought" as the flagship of the Home Fleet and of the 1st <a href="Division%20%28naval%29">Division</a> on 25 March and then participated in the <a href="Fleet%20Review%2C%20Royal%20Navy%23George%20V">Coronation Fleet Review</a> at <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a> on 24 June. On 1 May 1912, the 1st Division was renamed the 1st Battle Squadron (BS); "Neptune" was relieved as the <a href="squadron%20%28naval%29">squadron</a>'s flagship on 22 June. The ship participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead. "Neptune" became a private ship on 10 March 1914 when she was replaced by as the flagship of the Home Fleet and rejoined the 1st BS.

Between 17 and 20 July 1914 "Neptune" took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the <a href="July%20Crisis">July Crisis</a>. Arriving in <a href="Isle%20of%20Portland">Portland</a> on 27 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> two days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible German surprise attack. In August 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Jellicoe. Most of it was briefly based (22 October to 3 November) at <a href="Lough%20Swilly">Lough Swilly</a>, Ireland, while the defences at Scapa were strengthened. On the evening of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; "Neptune" stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty</a>'s <a href="1st%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron">1st Battlecruiser Squadron</a>. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November and the ship began a refit on 11 December.
"Neptune"s refit had concluded by the evening of 23 January 1915 as she joined the rest of the Grand Fleet when it sailed in support of Beatty's battlecruisers, but the fleet was too far away participate in the ensuing <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a> the following day. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet made a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March; while returning home after the conclusion of the exercises, "Neptune" was unsuccessfully attacked by the German <a href="submarine">submarine</a> . While manoeuvering for another attack, the submarine was spotted by "Dreadnought" which <a href="naval%20ram">rammed</a> and cut it in half. There were no survivors. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet, including "Neptune", made a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off the <a href="Shetland%20Islands">Shetland Islands</a> on 20–21 April.

The Grand Fleet conducted sweeps into the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. During 11–14 June the fleet practised gunnery and battle exercises west of the Shetlands, and trained off the Shetlands three days later. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea, conducting gunnery drills, and spent the rest of the month performing numerous training exercises. The ship, together with the majority of the Grand Fleet, made another sweep into the North Sea from 13 to 15 October. Almost three weeks later, "Neptune" participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November.

The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February 1916; Jellicoe had intended to use the <a href="Harwich%20Force">Harwich Force</a> to sweep the <a href="Heligoland%20Bight">Heligoland Bight</a>, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s. On the night of 25 March, "Neptune" and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty's battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> base at <a href="Tondern">Tondern</a>. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong <a href="gale">gale</a> threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off <a href="Horns%20Reef">Horns Reef</a> to distract the Germans while the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a> relaid its defensive <a href="minefields">minefields</a> in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>. During the night of 22/23 April, "Neptune" was accidentally rammed by the neutral merchant ship in thick fog, but the battleship was only lightly damaged. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Yarmouth%20and%20Lowestoft">raid on Lowestoft</a>, but only arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet made another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

The German <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>, composed of sixteen dreadnoughts, six <a href="Pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnoughts</a> and supporting ships, departed the <a href="Jade%20Bight">Jade Bight</a> early on the morning of 31 May in an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet. The High Seas Fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s five battlecruisers. The Royal Navy's <a href="Room%2040">Room 40</a> had <a href="Signals%20intelligence">intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic</a> containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to <a href="sortie">sortie</a> the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

On 31 May, "Neptune", under the command of <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Vivian%20Bernard">Vivian Bernard</a>, was assigned to the 5th Division of the 1st BS and was the nineteenth ship from the head of the <a href="battle%20line">battle line</a> after deployment. During the first stage of the general engagement, the ship fired two <a href="salvo">salvo</a>s from her main guns at a barely visible battleship at 18:40. Around the time that the High Seas Fleet was reversing course beginning at 18:55 to re-engage the Grand Fleet, "Neptune" fired one salvo at the crippled <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> with unknown effect. After the turn the ships of the 1st BS were the closest ones to the Germans and, at approximately 19:10, she fired four salvos at the battlecruiser , claiming two hits, although neither can be confirmed. Shortly afterwards, the ship fired her main and secondary guns at enemy destroyers without result and then had to turn away to dodge three torpedoes. This was the last time that "Neptune" fired her guns during the battle. She expended a total of 48 twelve-inch shells (21 <a href="Explosive%20material%23High%20explosives">high explosive</a> and 27 <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23Common%20Pointed">common pointed, capped</a>) and 48 shells from her four-inch guns during the battle.

After the battle, the ship was transferred to the <a href="4th%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">4th Battle Squadron</a>. The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30' North due to the prevalence of German submarines and <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a>. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.

On 22 April 1918, the High Seas Fleet sailed north for the last time in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept a convoy to Norway, and had to turn back two days later after the battlecruiser suffered engine damage. The Grand Fleet sortied from Rosyth on the 24th when the operation was discovered, but was unable to catch the Germans. "Neptune" was present at Rosyth when the German fleet surrendered on 21 November and was reduced to reserve there on 1 February 1919 as she was thoroughly obsolete in comparison to the latest dreadnoughts. The ship was listed for disposal in March 1921 and was sold for scrap to <a href="Hughes%20Bolckow">Hughes Bolckow</a> in September 1922. She was towed to <a href="Blyth%2C%20Northumberland">Blyth, Northumberland</a> on 22 September to begin demolition.

St Vincent-class battleship

The "St Vincent"-class battleships were a group of three <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s built for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in the first decade of the 20th century. The <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s spent their entire careers assigned to the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home</a> and <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>s. Aside from participating in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> in May 1916 and the inconclusive <a href="Action%20of%2019%20August%201916">Action of 19 August</a> several months later, their service during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. was destroyed in 1917 by a <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a> explosion with the near total loss of her crew. The remaining pair were obsolete by the end of the war in 1918, and spent their remaining time either in <a href="Reserve%20fleet">reserve</a> or as <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a>s before being sold for <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a> in the early 1920s.

"Vanguard"s wreck was extensively <a href="Marine%20salvage">salvaged</a> before it was declared a <a href="war%20grave">war grave</a>. Since 2002, it has been designated as a controlled site under the <a href="Protection%20of%20Military%20Remains%20Act%201986">Protection of Military Remains Act 1986</a> and diving on the wreck is generally forbidden.

The <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a>'s 1905 draft building plan called for four <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s in the 1907–1908 Naval Programme, but the new <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> government cut one of these ships in mid-1906 and postponed another to the 1908–1909 Naval Programme, pending the conclusion of the ongoing <a href="Hague%20Conventions%20of%201899%20and%201907%23Hague%20Convention%20of%201907">Hague Peace Convention</a>. The failure of the Germans to agree to any sort of naval arms control caused the government to reinstate the third ship. The Admiralty took until 12 June 1907 to decide not to build one of them as a <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>, in favour of a <a href="squadron%20%28naval%29">squadron</a> of four homogeneous battleships. Three of these would be part of the "St Vincent" class, while the single battleship planned for the 1908–1909 Naval Programme was later authorised as .
The design of the "St Vincent" class was derived from the preceding , with more powerful guns and a slight increase in size and armour. The ships had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a normal <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . They <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at normal load and at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. In comparison to the "Bellerophon" class, the displacement of the "St Vincent"s was increased by , the length by and the beam by ; their crews numbered about 755 officers and <a href="naval%20rating">ratings</a> upon completion and 835 during the war.

The "St Vincent"-class ships were powered by two sets of <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> <a href="direct-drive">direct-drive</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each of which was housed in a separate <a href="engine%20room">engine room</a>. The outer <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>s were coupled to the high-pressure turbines and these exhausted into low-pressure turbines which drove the inner shafts. Separate cruising turbines were provided for each shaft. The turbines used steam from eighteen <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s at a working pressure of . They were rated at and were intended to give the ships a maximum speed of . During their <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, the "St Vincent"s handily exceeded their designed speed and horsepower, reaching from . They carried of coal and an additional of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. This gave them a range of at a cruising speed of .

These ships were the first to carry the new 50-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">calibre</a> <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23BL">breech-loading (BL)</a> <a href="BL%2012%20inch%20Mk%20XI%20-%20XII%20naval%20gun">Mark XI gun</a>, which was 5 calibres longer and had a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> about higher than the 45-calibre <a href="BL%2012%20inch%20Mk%20X%20naval%20gun">Mark X gun</a> used in the earlier dreadnoughts. They had a reputation for drooping at the <a href="muzzle%20%28firearms%29">muzzle</a>, which was believed to have an adverse effect at long range, but testing at sea showed the muzzle droop to be within normal tolerances and the accuracy at long range to be satisfactory. The increased muzzle velocity of the Mark XI gun gave it a longer range over the Mark X gun as well as increasing the distance at which it could penetrate 12 inches of armour from using the same shell. The higher velocity reduced its service life by increasing the wear in the barrel.

The "St Vincent" class were equipped with ten Mark XI guns in five hydraulically powered twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, three along the centreline and the remaining two as <a href="wing%20turret">wing turret</a>s. The centreline turrets were named 'A', 'X' and 'Y' from front to rear, and the <a href="port%20and%20starboard">port and starboard</a> wing turrets were 'P' and 'Q' respectively. The guns had a maximum <a href="elevation%20%28ballistics%29">elevation</a> of +20° which gave them a range of . They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of two <a href="Cartridge%20%28firearms%29">rounds</a> per minute. The ships carried between 80 and 100 shells per gun.

The <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> of the "St Vincent"s consisted of twenty 50-calibre <a href="BL%204%20inch%20naval%20gun%20Mk%20VII">BL four-inch (102 mm) Mark VII</a> guns. Pairs of these guns were installed in unshielded mounts on the roofs of 'A', 'P', 'Q' and 'Y' turrets and the other dozen were positioned in single mounts at <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a>-deck level in the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. The guns had a maximum elevation of +15° which gave them a range of firing projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . They were provided with 150 rounds per gun; the wartime allowance for each gun was 200 rounds. Four 3-pounder <a href="saluting%20gun">saluting gun</a>s were also carried. The ships were equipped with three <a href="British%2018%20inch%20torpedo">18-inch (450 mm)</a> submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, one on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a> and another in the <a href="stern">stern</a>, for which nine <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es were provided.

The control positions for the main armament were located in the <a href="Top%20%28sailing%20ship%29">spotting tops</a> at the head of the fore and <a href="mainmast">mainmast</a>s. Data from a <a href="Barr%20and%20Stroud">Barr and Stroud</a> <a href="coincidence%20rangefinder">coincidence rangefinder</a> located at each control position, together with the target's speed and course information, was input into a <a href="Dumaresq">Dumaresq</a> mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to <a href="Vickers%20range%20clock">Vickers range clock</a>s located in the transmitting station located beneath each position on the main deck. Wind speed and direction was called down to the transmitting station by either <a href="voicepipe">voicepipe</a> or <a href="sound-powered%20telephone">sound-powered telephone</a>. The range clock integrated all the data and converted it into elevation and <a href="Deflection%20%28ballistics%29">deflection</a> data for use by the guns. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The turrets, transmitting stations and control positions could be connected in almost any combination. As a backup, two turrets in each ship ('A' and 'Y' in "St Vincent") could take over if necessary.

In 1910–1911, the four-inch guns on the roof of the forward turret of "Vanguard" were replaced by a rangefinder. This was removed about a year later, roughly at the same time when the rooftop guns were removed from the forward turrets of the other two ships. In late 1914, the remaining rooftop guns were replaced on the three <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s by 9-foot rangefinders protected by armoured hoods.

<a href="Fire-control%20system">Fire-control technology</a> advanced quickly during the years between the "St Vincent"s' commissioning and the start of World War I and the most important development was the <a href="Director%20%28military%29">director</a> firing system. Mounted high in the ship, a fire-control director electrically provided data to the turrets via a pointer on a <a href="dial%20%28measurement%29">dial</a>, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the <a href="ship%20motions">roll</a> on the dispersion of the shells. While the exact dates of installation are unknown, "St Vincent" was equipped with a director by December 1915 and the others by May 1916. The ships were fitted with Mark I <a href="Frederic%20Charles%20Dreyer%23Dreyer%20Fire%20Control%20Table">Dreyer Fire-control Tables</a> in the transmission stations by early 1916, which combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock.

The "St Vincent"-class ships had a <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="Belt%20armor">belt</a> of <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armour">Krupp cemented armour</a> that was thick between the fore and aftmost <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s that reduced to before it reached the ships' ends. It covered the side of the <a href="hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> from the middle <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> down to below the waterline where it thinned to <a href="amidships">amidships</a>. Above this was a <a href="strake">strake</a> of 8-inch armour. Transverse <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkheads</a> thick terminated the thickest parts of the waterline and upper armour belts once they reached the outer portions of the endmost barbettes. The three centreline barbettes were protected by armour thick above the main deck and thinned to below it. The wing barbettes were similar except that they had 10 inches of armour on their outer faces. The gun turrets had faces and sides with 3-inch roofs.

The three armoured decks ranged in thickness from with the greatest thickness outside the central <a href="armoured%20citadel">armoured citadel</a>. The front and sides of the forward <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> were protected by 11-inch plates, although the rear and roof were 8 inches and 3 inches thick respectively. The aft conning tower had 8-inch sides and a 3-inch roof. The "St Vincent"s had two longitudinal anti-<a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a>s thick that extended from the forward end of 'A' barbette to the end of 'Y' <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>. In the vicinity of the <a href="boiler%20room%20%28ship%29">boiler rooms</a>, the compartments between them were used as <a href="coal%20bunker">coal bunker</a>s.

The guns on the forward turret roof were replaced in 1910–1911 by a rangefinder on "Vanguard", and on her sisters in 1911–1912. About two years later, <a href="gun%20shield">gun shield</a>s were fitted to most of the guns in the superstructure and the <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> structure was enlarged around the base of the forward tripod mast. During the first year of the war, the base of the forward superstructure was rebuilt to house eight 4-inch guns and the turret-top guns were removed, which reduced their secondary armament to a total of fourteen guns; a pair of 3-inch (76 mm) <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft (AA) guns</a> were added. Approximately of additional deck armour were added after the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. By April 1917, the sisters mounted thirteen 4-inch anti-torpedo boat guns as well as single 4-inch and 3-inch AA guns. The stern torpedo tube was removed in 1917–1918 and "St Vincent" was equipped to operate <a href="kite%20balloon">kite balloon</a>s. In 1918, a high-angle <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a> was fitted on the forward spotting top of the surviving ships and <a href="Flight%20deck%23Early%20flight%20decks">flying-off platforms</a> were installed on the roofs of the fore and aft turrets of "Collingwood".

Upon commissioning, all three ships were assigned to the 1st <a href="Division%20%28naval%29">Division</a> of the Home Fleet and "St Vincent" became the flagship of the division's <a href="second-in-command">second-in-command</a>. In July, they were present when <a href="King%20George%20V">King George V</a> visited the fleet in <a href="Torbay">Torbay</a> and participated in his <a href="Fleet%20Review%2C%20Royal%20Navy%23George%20V">Coronation Fleet Review</a> at <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a> on 24 June 1911. Less than a year later, the 1st Division was renamed the <a href="1st%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Battle Squadron</a> (BS) on 1 May 1912. "Collingwood" became the squadron flagship on 22 June and reverted to a <a href="private%20ship">private ship</a> again two years later. Each of the sisters underwent a lengthy refit before the First World War began in mid-1914.
Between 17 and 20 July 1914, the sisters took part in a test <a href="mobilisation">mobilisation</a> and fleet review. Arriving in <a href="Isle%20of%20Portland">Portland</a> afterwards, they were ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> two days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a>. After the British declaration of war on Germany on 4 August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> and placed under the command of Admiral <a href="John%20Jellicoe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Jellicoe">John Jellicoe</a>. According to pre-war doctrine, the role of the Grand Fleet was to fight a decisive battle against the German High Seas Fleet, but German reluctance to commit their battleships against the superior British force led to indecisive operations. The Grand Fleet spent its time training in the North Sea, punctuated by the occasional mission to intercept a German raid or major fleet <a href="sortie">sortie</a>. In April 1916, "Vanguard" was transferred to the <a href="4th%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">4th Battle Squadron</a> while her sisters remained in the 1st Battle Squadron.

In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the German <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> departed the <a href="Jade%20Bight">Jade Bight</a> early on the morning of 31 May 1916 in support of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s battlecruisers, which were to act as bait. The British code breakers of <a href="Room%2040">Room 40</a> at the Admiralty had <a href="Signals%20intelligence">decoded</a> German radio traffic containing plans of the operation and the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet to sortie the night before the Germans, to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

The Grand Fleet rendezvoused with the <a href="2nd%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2nd Battle Squadron</a>, coming from <a href="Cromarty">Cromarty</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, on the morning of 31 May and Jellicoe organised the main body of the Grand Fleet in parallel columns of four-ship divisions. The two divisions of the 2nd BS were on his left (east), the 4th BS was in the centre and the 1st BS on the right. "Vanguard" and "St Vincent" were the rear ships of their divisions while "Collingwood" was the second ship in its division. When Jellicoe ordered the Grand Fleet to deploy to the left and form <a href="line%20astern">line astern</a> in anticipation of encountering the High Seas Fleet, this naturally placed the 4th and 1st Battle Squadrons in the centre and rear of the line of battle, respectively, which meant that the sisters were in the rear of the Grand Fleet once it was deployed. This limited their ability to engage the German ships in the poor visibility. All three ships fired at the crippled <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> , possibly scoring some hits, but only "St Vincent" and "Collingwood" were able to engage any of the German capital ships. The former hit the battlecruiser twice, inflicting only minor damage, while "Collingwood" hit the battlecruiser once, also with little effect. "Vanguard" and "Collingwood" also fired at German <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, but failed to achieve any hits. None of the sisters fired more than 98 rounds from their main guns during the battle.

After the battle, "St Vincent" and "Collingwood" joined "Vanguard" in the 4th BS. The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of communication failures and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide not to risk the major units of the fleet to German submarines and <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a> south of 55° 30' North. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions. The Admiralty order meant that the Grand Fleet spent far less time at sea. In late February 1917, the 4th BS conducted tactical exercises for a few days. In January 1918, "Collingwood" and some of the older dreadnoughts cruised off the coast of Norway for several days, possibly to provide distant cover for a convoy to Norway. Along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, she sortied on the afternoon of 23 April when radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea, after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British to be caught and no shots were fired. "St Vincent" was under repair at <a href="Invergordon">Invergordon</a>, Scotland, and could not sortie, but was present at <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a> when the German fleet surrendered on 21 November; "Collingwood" was refitting in Invergordon.

In the evening of 9 July 1917, "Vanguard"s magazines exploded and she sank almost instantly, with only three survivors, one of whom died soon afterwards; 842 men aboard were lost. "Collingwood"s crew recovered the bodies of three men killed in the explosion. The <a href="Board%20of%20Inquiry">Board of Inquiry</a> concluded that a fire of unknown origin began in a 4-inch magazine and spread to one or both of the nearby 12-inch magazines, which detonated and sank the ship.

In March 1919, "St Vincent" was reduced to reserve and became a gunnery training ship at <a href="HMNB%20Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>. She then became flagship of the <a href="Reserve%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Reserve Fleet</a> in June and was relieved as gunnery training ship in December, when she was transferred to Rosyth. There she remained until listed for disposal in March 1921; she was sold for scrap on 1 December 1921 and demolished.

In January 1919, "Collingwood" was transferred to Devonport and assigned to the Reserve Fleet. Upon the dissolution of the Grand Fleet on 18 March, the Reserve Fleet was renamed the Third Fleet and "Collingwood" became its flagship. She became a <a href="Ship%27s%20tender">tender</a> to <a href="HMS%20Vivid%20%28shore%20establishment%201890%29">HMS "Vivid"</a> on 1 October and served as a gunnery and <a href="wireless%20telegraphy">wireless telegraphy</a> training ship until early August 1920, when the ship returned to the reserve. "Collingwood" served as a <a href="Boy%20seaman">boys'</a> training ship on 22 September 1921 until she was <a href="Ship%20decommissioning">paid off</a> on 31 March 1922. "Collingwood" was sold for scrap on 12 December and was broken up.

Much of "Vanguard"s wreck was salvaged before it was declared a war grave in 1984. The amidships portion of the ship is almost completely gone and 'P' and 'Q' turrets are some away, presumably blown there by the magazine explosions. The bow and stern areas are almost intact as has been revealed by a survey authorised by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a> in 2016 in preparation for the centenary commemoration planned for 2017. The wreck was named a controlled site in 2002 and cannot be dived upon, except with permission from the Ministry.

HMS Collingwood (1908)

HMS "Collingwood" was a <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a> built for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in the first decade of the 20th century. She spent her whole career assigned to the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home</a> and <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>s and often served as a <a href="flagship">flagship</a>. Prince Albert (later <a href="King%20George%20VI">King George VI</a>) spent several years aboard the ship before and during <a href="Naval%20warfare%20of%20World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> in May 1916, "Collingwood" was in the middle of the <a href="battleline">battleline</a> and lightly damaged a German <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>. Other than that battle, and the inconclusive <a href="Action%20of%2019%20August%201916">Action of 19 August</a>, her service during the war generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. The ship was deemed obsolete after the war; she was reduced to <a href="Reserve%20fleet">reserve</a> and used as a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> before being sold for <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a> in 1922.

The design of the "St Vincent" class was derived from that of the previous , with a slight increase in size, armour and more powerful guns, among other more minor changes. "Collingwood" had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a normal <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . She <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at normal load and at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. In 1911 her crew numbered 758 officers and <a href="naval%20rating">ratings</a>.
"Collingwood" was powered by two sets of <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> <a href="direct-drive">direct-drive</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each driving two shafts, using steam from eighteen <a href="Yarrow%20boiler">Yarrow boiler</a>s. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . During her full-power, eight-hour <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s on 17 January 1910, she only reached a top speed of from . "Collingwood" carried enough coal and <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .

The "St Vincent" class was equipped with ten <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23BL">breech-loading</a> (BL) <a href="BL%2012%20inch%20Mk%20XI%20-%20XII%20naval%20gun">12-inch (305 mm) Mk XI guns</a> in five twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, three along the centreline and the remaining two as <a href="wing%20turret">wing turret</a>s. The secondary, or anti-<a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>, armament comprised twenty <a href="BL%204%20inch%20naval%20gun%20Mk%20VII">BL 4-inch (102 mm) Mk VII guns</a>. Two of these guns were each installed on the roofs of the fore and aft centreline turrets and the wing turrets in unshielded mounts, and the other ten were positioned in the superstructure. All guns were in single mounts. The ships were also fitted with three <a href="British%2018%20inch%20torpedo">18-inch (450 mm)</a> <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, one on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a> and the third in the <a href="stern">stern</a>.

The "St Vincent"-class ships had a <a href="Belt%20armor">waterline belt</a> of <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armour">Krupp cemented armour</a> (KC) that was thick between the fore and aftmost <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s, reducing to a thickness of before it reached the ships' ends. Above this was a <a href="strake">strake</a> of armour thick. Transverse <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>s inches thick terminated the thickest parts of the waterline and upper armour belts once they reached the outer portions of the endmost barbettes.

The three centreline barbettes were protected by armour thick above the main <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> that thinned to below it. The wing barbettes were similar except that they had 10 inches of armour on their outer faces. The gun turrets had faces and sides with roofs. The three armoured decks ranged in thicknesses from . The front and sides of the forward <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> were protected by 11-inch plates, although the rear and roof were 8 inches and 3 inches thick, respectively.

The guns on the forward turret roof were removed in 1911–1912 and the upper forward pair of guns in the superstructure were removed in 1913–1914. In addition, <a href="gun%20shield">gun shield</a>s were fitted to all guns in the superstructure and the <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> structure was enlarged around the base of the forward tripod mast. During the first year of the war, a <a href="fire-control%20director">fire-control director</a> was installed high on the forward tripod mast. Around the same time, the base of the forward superstructure was rebuilt to house eight 4-inch guns and the turret-top guns were removed, which reduced her secondary armament to a total of fourteen guns. In addition, a pair of 3-inch <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft (AA) guns</a> were added.

By April 1917, "Collingwood" mounted thirteen 4-inch anti-torpedo boat guns as well as single 4-inch and 3-inch AA guns. Approximately of additional deck armour had been added after the Battle of Jutland. Before the end of the war the AA guns were moved from the deckhouse between the aft turrets to the stern and the stern torpedo tube was removed. In 1918, a high-angle <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a> was fitted and <a href="Flight%20deck%23Early%20flight%20decks">flying-off platforms</a> were installed on the roofs of the fore and aft turrets.

"Collingwood", named after <a href="Vice-Admiral">Vice-Admiral</a> <a href="Cuthbert%20Collingwood%2C%201st%20Baron%20Collingwood">Cuthbert Collingwood</a>, was ordered on 26 October 1907. She was <a href="laid%20down">laid down</a> at <a href="HMNB%20Devonport">Devonport Royal Dockyard</a> on 3 February 1908, <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 7 November 1908 and completed in April 1910. Including her armament, the ship's cost is quoted at £1,680,888 or £1,731,640.

On 19 April 1910, "Collingwood" was <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> and assigned to the 1st Division of the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a> under the command of <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="William%20Pakenham%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">William Pakenham</a>. She joined other members of the fleet in regular peacetime exercises, and on 11 February 1911 damaged her bottom plating on an uncharted rock off <a href="Ferrol%2C%20Spain">Ferrol</a>. On 24 June the ship was present at the <a href="Coronation%20Fleet%20Review">Coronation Fleet Review</a> for <a href="King%20George%20V">King George V</a> at <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a>. Pakenham was relieved by Captain <a href="Charles%20Vaughan-Lee">Charles Vaughan-Lee</a> on 1 December. On 1 May 1912, the 1st Division was renamed the <a href="1st%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Battle Squadron</a>. On 22 June, Vaughan-Lee was transferred to the battleship and Captain <a href="James%20Ley%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">James Ley</a> assumed command; Vice-Admiral <a href="Stanley%20Colville">Stanley Colville</a> hoisted his flag in "Collingwood" as commander of the 1st Battle Squadron. The ship participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead before beginning a refit late in the year. In March 1913, "Collingwood" and the 1st Battle Squadron undertook a port visit to <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a>, France. <a href="Midshipman">Midshipman</a> Prince Albert (later <a href="King%20George%20VI">King George VI</a>) was assigned to the ship on 15 September 1913. "Collingwood" hosted Albert's older brother, <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward</a>, <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>, during a short cruise on 18 April 1914. She became a <a href="private%20ship">private ship</a> when Colville hauled down his flag on 22 June.

Between 17 and 20 July, "Collingwood" took part in a test <a href="mobilisation">mobilisation</a> and fleet review as part of the British response to the <a href="July%20Crisis">July Crisis</a>. Arriving in <a href="Isle%20of%20Portland">Portland</a> on 27 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> two days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">German</a> surprise attack. In August 1914, following the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>, and placed under the command of Admiral <a href="John%20Jellicoe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Jellicoe">John Jellicoe</a>. Most of it was briefly based (22 October to 3 November) at <a href="Lough%20Swilly">Lough Swilly</a>, Ireland, while the defences at Scapa were strengthened. On the evening of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>; "Collingwood" stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty</a>'s <a href="1st%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron">1st Battlecruiser Squadron</a>. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. The 1st Battle Squadron cruised north-west of the <a href="Shetland%20Islands">Shetland Islands</a> and conducted gunnery practice on 8–12 December. Four days later, the Grand Fleet <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d during the German <a href="raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby</a>, but failed to make contact with the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>. "Collingwood" and the rest of the Grand Fleet conducted another sweep of the North Sea on 25–27 December.
The Grand Fleet, including "Collingwood", conducted gunnery drills on 10–13 January 1915 west of the <a href="Orkneys">Orkneys</a> and Shetlands. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty's <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s, but "Collingwood" and the rest of the fleet did not participate in the ensuing <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a> the following day. The ship sailed for <a href="Portsmouth%20Royal%20Dockyard">Portsmouth Royal Dockyard</a> on 2 February to begin a brief refit and returned on 18 February. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. From 25 March to 14 April 1915, <a href="Rear-Admiral">Rear-Admiral</a> <a href="Hugh%20Evan-Thomas">Hugh Evan-Thomas</a> temporarily hoisted his flag aboard "Collingwood". On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off the Shetlands on 20–21 April.

The Grand Fleet conducted sweeps into the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. During 11–14 June the fleet conducted gunnery practice and battle exercises west of the Shetlands. "Collingwood" was briefly docked at <a href="Invergordon">Invergordon</a> from 23 to 25 June. King George V inspected the ship on 8 July, and the Grand Fleet conducted training off the Shetlands beginning three days later. Rear-Admiral <a href="Ernest%20Gaunt">Ernest Gaunt</a> temporarily used "Collingwood" as his flagship from 24 August to 24 September and from 10 December to 16 January 1916. On 2–5 September 1915, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises. The ship, together with the majority of the Grand Fleet, conducted another sweep into the North Sea from 13 to 15 October. Almost three weeks later, "Collingwood" participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November. On 21 November, she sailed for Devonport Royal Dockyard for a minor <a href="wikt%3Aoverhaul">overhaul</a> and arrived back at Scapa on 9 December.

The Grand Fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February 1916; Jellicoe had intended to use the <a href="Harwich%20Force">Harwich Force</a> to sweep the <a href="Heligoland%20Bight">Heligoland Bight</a>, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s. On the night of 25 March, "Collingwood" and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty's battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> base at <a href="Tondern">Tondern</a>. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong <a href="gale">gale</a> threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off <a href="Horns%20Reef">Horns Reef</a> to distract the Germans while the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Russian Navy</a> relaid its defensive <a href="naval%20mine">minefields</a> in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Yarmouth%20and%20Lowestoft">raid on Lowestoft</a>. The Grand Fleet arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the German High Seas Fleet, composed of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 <a href="Pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnoughts</a>, 6 <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s, and 31 <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s, departed the <a href="Jade%20Bight">Jade Bight</a> early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy's <a href="Room%2040">Room 40</a> had <a href="Signals%20intelligence">intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic</a> containing plans of the operation. In response, the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. "Collingwood" was the eighteenth ship from the head of the battle line after the Grand Fleet deployed for battle.

The initial action was fought primarily by the British and German battlecruiser formations in the afternoon, but by 18:00, the Grand Fleet approached the scene. Fifteen minutes later, Jellicoe gave the order to turn and deploy the fleet for action. The transition from cruising formation caused congestion with the rear divisions, forcing many ships to reduce speed to to avoid colliding with each other. During the first stage of the general engagement, "Collingwood" fired eight <a href="salvo">salvo</a>s from her main guns at the crippled <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> from 18:32, although the number of hits made, if any, is unknown. Her secondary armament then engaged the destroyer , which was attempting to come to "Wiesbaden"s assistance, but failed to hit her. At 19:15 "Collingwood" fired two salvoes of <a href="Explosive%20material%23High%20explosives">high explosive</a> (HE) shells at the battlecruiser , hitting her target once before she disappeared into the mist. The shell detonated in the German ship's <a href="sickbay">sickbay</a> and damaged the surrounding superstructure. Shortly afterwards, during the attack of the German destroyers around 19:20, the ship fired her main armament at a damaged destroyer without success and dodged two torpedoes that missed by behind and in front. This was the last time she fired her guns during the battle.

Following the German destroyer attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and "Collingwood" and the rest of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard the fleet flagship over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its night-time cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. "Collingwood" fired a total of 52 <a href="Armor-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">armour-piercing, capped</a> and 32 HE shells from her main armament and 35 four-inch shells during the battle. Prince Albert was a <a href="sub-lieutenant">sub-lieutenant</a> commanding the forward turret during the battle and sat in the open on the turret roof during a lull in the action.

After the battle the ship was transferred to the <a href="4th%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">4th Battle Squadron</a> under the command of Vice-Admiral Sir <a href="Doveton%20Sturdee">Doveton Sturdee</a>, who inspected "Collingwood" on 8 August 1916. The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30' North due to the prevalence of German submarines and <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a>. The <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.

"Collingwood" received a brief refit at <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a> in early September before rejoining the Grand Fleet. On 29 October Sturdee came aboard to present the ship with her <a href="battle%20honour">battle honour</a>, "Jutland 1916". Captain <a href="Wilmot%20Nicholson">Wilmot Nicholson</a> briefly assumed command on 1 December before transferring to the new battlecruiser upon his relief by Captain <a href="Cole%20Fowler">Cole Fowler</a> on 26 March 1917. Together with the rest of the 4th Battle Squadron, "Collingwood" put to sea for tactical exercises for a few days in February 1917. The ship was present at Scapa Flow when her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> s <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> exploded on 9 July and her crew recovered the bodies of three men killed in the explosion. In January 1918, "Collingwood" and other of the older dreadnoughts cruised off the coast of Norway for several days, possibly to provide distant cover for a convoy to Norway. Along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, she sortied on the afternoon of 23 April after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British, and no shots were fired. By early November, "Collingwood" was at Invergordon to receive a brief refit in the floating dock based there, and missed the surrender of the High Seas Fleet on the 21st. She was slightly damaged on 23 November while attempting to come alongside the <a href="Replenishment%20oiler">oiler</a> <a href="Royal%20Fleet%20Auxiliary">RFA</a> <a href="RFA%20Ebonol">"Ebonol"</a>.

In January 1919, "Collingwood" was transferred to Devonport and assigned to the Reserve Fleet. Upon the dissolution of the Grand Fleet on 18 March, the Reserve Fleet was redesignated the Third Fleet and "Collingwood" became its flagship. She became a <a href="Ship%27s%20tender">tender</a> to <a href="HMS%20Vivid%20%28shore%20establishment%201890%29">HMS "Vivid"</a> on 1 October and served as a gunnery and <a href="wireless%20telegraphy">wireless telegraphy</a> (W/T) training ship. The W/T school was transferred to "Glorious" on 1 June 1920 and the gunnery duties followed in early August; "Collingwood" returned to the reserve. She became a <a href="Boy%20seaman">boys'</a> training ship on 22 September 1921 until she was <a href="Ship%20decommissioning">paid off</a> on 31 March 1922. "Collingwood" was sold to <a href="John%20Cashmore%20Ltd">John Cashmore Ltd</a> for scrap on 12 December and arrived at <a href="Newport%2C%20Wales">Newport, Wales</a>, on 3 March 1923 to be broken up.

<a href="Battle%20ensign">Battle ensign</a>s flown by the ship during Jutland survive at the <a href="shore%20establishment">shore establishment</a> of the <a href="HMS%20Collingwood%20%28shore%20establishment%29">same name</a> and at the <a href="Roedean%20School">Roedean School</a> in <a href="East%20Sussex">East Sussex</a>.

HMS Vanguard (1909)

HMS "Vanguard" was one of three <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s built for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in the first decade of the 20th century. She spent her career assigned to the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home</a> and <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>s. Aside from participating in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> in May 1916 and the inconclusive <a href="Action%20of%2019%20August%201916">Action of 19 August</a> several months later, her service during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> mostly consisted of routine patrols and training in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>.

Shortly before midnight on 9 July 1917 at <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>, "Vanguard" suffered a series of <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a> explosions. She sank almost instantly, killing 843 of the 845 men aboard. The wreck was heavily salvaged after the war, but was eventually protected as a <a href="war%20grave">war grave</a> in 1984. It was designated as a controlled site under the <a href="Protection%20of%20Military%20Remains%20Act%201986">Protection of Military Remains Act 1986</a>, and diving on the wreck is generally forbidden.

The design of the <a href="St%20Vincent-class%20battleship">"St Vincent" class</a> was derived from that of the previous , with a slight increase in size, armour and more powerful guns, among other minor changes. "Vanguard" had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a normal <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . She <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at normal load and at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. In 1910 her crew numbered 753 officers and <a href="naval%20rating">ratings</a>.
"Vanguard" was powered by two sets of <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> <a href="direct-drive">direct-drive</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each driving two shafts, using steam from eighteen <a href="Babcock%20%26amp%3B%20Wilcox%20boiler">Babcock & Wilcox boiler</a>s. The turbines were rated at and intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . During her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s on 17 December 1909, she unofficially reached a top speed of from , although she must have been lightly loaded to reach this speed. "Vanguard" carried enough coal and <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .
The "St Vincent" class was equipped with ten <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23BL">breech-loading</a> (BL) <a href="BL%2012%20inch%20Mk%20XI%20-%20XII%20naval%20gun">Mk XI guns</a> in five twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, three along the centreline and the remaining two as <a href="wing%20turret">wing turret</a>s. The centreline turrets were designated 'A', 'X' and 'Y', from front to rear, and the <a href="port%20and%20starboard">port and starboard</a> wing turrets were 'P' and 'Q' respectively. The secondary, or anti-<a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a> armament, comprised twenty <a href="BL%204%20inch%20naval%20gun%20Mk%20VII">BL Mk VII guns</a>. Two of these guns were each installed on the roofs of the fore and aft centreline turrets and the wing turrets in unshielded mounts, and the other ten were positioned in the superstructure. All guns were in single mounts. The ships were also fitted with three <a href="British%2018%20inch%20torpedo">18-inch (450 mm)</a> <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, one on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a> and the third in the <a href="stern">stern</a>.

The "St Vincent"-class ships were protected by a <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="armoured%20belt">armoured belt</a> thick that extended between the end <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s. Their <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a>s ranged in thickness between with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes thick.

The guns on the forward turret roof were removed in 1910–1911. About three years later, <a href="gun%20shield">gun shield</a>s were fitted to most of the 4-inch guns in the superstructure and the <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> structure was enlarged around the base of the forward <a href="tripod%20mast">tripod mast</a>. During the first year of World War I, the base of the forward superstructure was rebuilt to house eight 4-inch guns and the turret-top guns were removed, which reduced her secondary armament to a total of fourteen guns. In addition a pair of 3-inch (76 mm) <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft (AA) guns</a> were added. A <a href="fire-control%20director">fire-control director</a> was installed high on the forward tripod mast before the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> in May 1916. Approximately of additional deck armour were added afterwards. By April 1917, "Vanguard" mounted thirteen 4-inch anti-torpedo boat guns as well as one 4-inch and one 3-inch AA gun.

"Vanguard", the eighth ship of that name to serve in the Royal Navy, was ordered on 6 February 1908. She was <a href="laid%20down">laid down</a> by <a href="Vickers%20Armstrong">Vickers Armstrong</a> at their <a href="Barrow-in-Furness">Barrow-in-Furness</a> shipyard on 2 April 1908, <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 22 April 1909, and completed on 1 March 1910. Including armament, the ship cost about <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>1.6 million. "Vanguard" was <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 1 March 1910, under the command of <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="John%20Eustace%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John Eustace</a>, and assigned to the 1st <a href="Division%20%28naval%29">Division</a> of the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a>. She was present in <a href="Torbay">Torbay</a> when <a href="King%20George%20V">King George V</a> visited the fleet in late July. "Vanguard" also participated in the <a href="Fleet%20Review%2C%20Royal%20Navy%23George%20V">Coronation Fleet Review</a> at <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a> on 24 June 1911 and she trained with the <a href="Atlantic%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Atlantic Fleet</a> the following month before beginning a refit. Captain <a href="Arthur%20Ricardo">Arthur Ricardo</a> relieved Eustace on 23 September.

The ship was recommissioned on 28 March 1912 and rejoined the 1st Division shortly before it was renamed the <a href="1st%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Battle Squadron</a> on 1 May. She participated in exercises with the <a href="First%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Fleet</a> in October. "Vanguard" was refitted in December, with new <a href="bilge%20keel">bilge keel</a>s being installed. On 5 June 1913, Captain <a href="Cecil%20Hickley">Cecil Hickley</a> replaced Ricardo upon the latter's promotion to <a href="Commodore%20%28rank%29">commodore, second class</a>.

Between 17 and 20 July 1914, "Vanguard" took part in a test <a href="mobilisation">mobilisation</a> and fleet review as part of the British response to the <a href="July%20Crisis">July Crisis</a>. Arriving in <a href="Isle%20of%20Portland">Portland</a> on 27 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> two days later to forestall a possible surprise attack by the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a>. In August 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>, and placed under the command of Admiral <a href="John%20Jellicoe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Jellicoe">John Jellicoe</a>. On 1 September, the Grand Fleet was anchored at Scapa Flow when the light cruiser spotted a suspected German submarine, provoking a panic across the fleet. "Vanguard" also spotted what was believed to be a <a href="periscope">periscope</a> and opened fire, but the whole incident proved to be a false alarm. Submarine scares such as this caused the fleet to be briefly (22 October to 3 November) based at <a href="Lough%20Swilly">Lough Swilly</a>, Ireland, while the defences at Scapa were strengthened. On the evening of 22 November, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>; "Vanguard" stood with the main body in support of <a href="Vice-Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Vice-Admiral</a> <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty</a>'s <a href="1st%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron">1st Battlecruiser Squadron</a>. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. The 1st Battle Squadron cruised north-west of the <a href="Shetland%20Islands">Shetland Islands</a> and exercised their guns on 8–12 December. Four days later, the Grand Fleet <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d during the German <a href="raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby</a>, but failed to make contact with the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>. "Vanguard" and the rest of the Grand Fleet made another sweep of the North Sea on 25–27 December.
Jellicoe's ships, including "Vanguard", conducted gunnery drills west of the <a href="Orkneys">Orkneys</a> and Shetlands on 10–13 January 1915. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty's <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s, but they were too far away to participate in the ensuing <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a> the following day. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet made a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the fleet patrolled the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off the Shetlands on 20–21 April.

The Grand Fleet swept the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. During 11–14 June the fleet practised gunnery and battle exercises west of the Shetlands, and on 11 July there was more training off the Shetlands. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet was performing numerous training exercises before making another sweep into the North Sea on 13–15 October. Almost three weeks later, "Vanguard" participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November.
Captain James Dick relieved Hickley on 22 January 1916. The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Jellicoe had intended to use the <a href="Harwich%20Force">Harwich Force</a> to sweep the <a href="Heligoland%20Bight">Heligoland Bight</a>, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s. On the night of 25 March, "Vanguard" and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty's battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> base at <a href="Tondern">Tondern</a>. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong <a href="gale">gale</a> threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. In April the ship was transferred to the <a href="4th%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">4th Battle Squadron</a>. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off <a href="Horns%20Reef">Horns Reef</a> to distract the Germans while the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Russian Navy</a> re-laid its defensive <a href="naval%20mine">minefields</a> in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Yarmouth%20and%20Lowestoft">raid on Lowestoft</a>. The Grand Fleet arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, composed of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 <a href="Pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnoughts</a>, and supporting ships, departed the <a href="Jade%20Bight">Jade Bight</a> early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s five battlecruisers. The Royal Navy's <a href="Room%2040">Room 40</a> had <a href="Signals%20intelligence">intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic</a> containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

During the Battle of Jutland on 31 May, Beatty's battlecruisers managed to bait Scheer and Hipper into a pursuit as they fell back upon the main body of the Grand Fleet. After Jellicoe deployed his ships into <a href="line%20of%20battle">line of battle</a>, "Vanguard" was the eighteenth ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. Shortly after deploying from column into <a href="line%20ahead">line ahead</a>, her crew recorded that shells from the High Seas Fleet were falling nearby. During the first stage of the general engagement, the ship fired 42 rounds from her main guns at the crippled <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> beginning at 18:32, claiming several hits. Between 19:20 and 19:30, "Vanguard" engaged several German destroyer <a href="flotilla">flotilla</a>s with her main armament without result. This was the last time that the ship fired her guns during the battle, as the poor visibility hindered Jellicoe's ability to close with the Germans before Scheer was able to disengage under the cover of darkness. "Vanguard" fired a total of 65 <a href="Explosive%20material%23High%20explosives">high-explosive</a> and 15 <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23Common%20Pointed">common-pointed, capped</a>, twelve-inch shells and 10 shells from her four-inch guns during the battle.

The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet, while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30' North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions. "Vanguard" was refitted in Rosyth in December.

The ship anchored in the northern part of Scapa Flow at about 18:30 on 9 July 1917 after having spent the afternoon practising the routine for abandoning ship. There is no record of anyone detecting anything amiss until the first explosion at 23:20. "Vanguard" sank almost instantly, with only three of the crew surviving, one of whom died soon afterwards. A total of 843 men were lost, including two Australian <a href="Stoker%20%28occupation%29">stoker</a>s from the light cruiser who were serving time in the battleship's <a href="brig%20%28prison%29">brig</a>. Another casualty was Captain <a href="Ky%C5%8Dsuke%20Eto">Kyōsuke Eto</a>, a <a href="military%20attach%C3%A9">military observer</a> from the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>, which was allied with the Royal Navy at the time through the <a href="Anglo-Japanese%20Alliance">Anglo-Japanese Alliance</a>. The bodies of 17 of the 22 men recovered after the explosion, plus that of <a href="Lieutenant%20commander%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Lieutenant Commander</a> Alan Duke, who died after being rescued, were buried at the Royal Naval Cemetery at <a href="Lyness">Lyness</a>, not far from the site of the explosion. The others are commemorated on the <a href="Chatham%20Naval%20Memorial">Chatham</a>, <a href="Plymouth%20Naval%20Memorial">Plymouth</a> and <a href="Portsmouth%20Naval%20Memorial">Portsmouth Naval Memorial</a>s.

A <a href="Board%20of%20Inquiry">Board of Inquiry</a> heard accounts from many witnesses on nearby ships. They accepted the consensus that there had been a small explosion with a white glare between the <a href="foremast">foremast</a> and 'A' turret, followed after a brief interval by two much larger explosions. The board decided, on the balance of the available evidence, that the main detonations were in either 'P' magazine, 'Q' magazine, or both. A great deal of debris thrown out by the explosions landed on nearby ships; a section of plating measuring approximately landed on board the battleship . It was found to be from the No. 2 Hydraulic Room <a href="abaft">abaft</a> 'A' barbette. It showed no signs of a blast from 'A' magazine, which reinforced the visual evidence suggesting that the explosion took place in the central part of the ship.

Although the explosion was obviously a detonation of the <a href="cordite">cordite</a> charges in a main magazine, the reason for it was less clear. There were several theories. The inquiry found that some of the cordite on board, which had been temporarily offloaded in December 1916 and catalogued at that time, was past its stated safe life. The possibility of spontaneous detonation was raised, but could not be proved. It was also noted that a number of ship's boilers were still in use, and some watertight doors, which should have been closed in wartime, were open as the ship was in port. It was suggested that this might have contributed to a dangerously high temperature in the magazines. The final conclusion of the board was that a fire started in a four-inch magazine, perhaps when a raised temperature caused spontaneous ignition of cordite, spreading to one or the other main magazines, which then exploded.

"Vanguard"s wreck was heavily <a href="Marine%20salvage">salvaged</a> in search of <a href="non-ferrous%20metal">non-ferrous metal</a>s before it was declared a war grave in 1984. Some of the main armament and armour plate was also removed.

As might be expected, the wreck and its associated debris cover a large area and is lying at a depth of approximately at . The amidships portion of the ship is almost completely gone and 'P' and 'Q' turrets were blown some away. The bow and stern areas are almost intact as has been revealed by an extensive survey, carried out by a team of volunteer specialist divers and authorised by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a> in 2016. A report of the survey was published in April 2018.

The wreck was designated as a controlled site in 2002 and cannot be dived upon except with permission from the Ministry of Defence. The centenary of "Vanguard"s loss was commemorated on 9 July 2017: descendants of the crew laid 40 wreaths above her wreckage, Royal Navy divers placed a new <a href="Union%20Jack">Union Jack</a> on the wreck, and Lyness Royal Naval Cemetery—where some of the crew were buried—held a wreath-laying ceremony.

Drakengard (video game)

Drakengard, known as in Japan, is an <a href="Action%20role-playing%20game">action role-playing</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="Cavia%20%28company%29">Cavia</a> and published by <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a> for the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>. A Europe-exclusive <a href="Mobile%20game">mobile</a> adaptation was developed by <a href="Macrospace">Macrospace</a> and published by Square Enix for <a href="Vodafone">Vodafone</a> devices in August 2004.

The game is the first installment of the <a href="Drakengard">"Drakengard" series</a> and features a mixture of ground-based hack-and-slash, aerial combat, and role-playing elements which have become a staple of the series. The story is set during a religious war between two factions—the Union and the Empire—with the war tipping in favor of the Empire. The player controls Caim, a deposed prince of the Union, in his quest for vengeance against the Empire. Wounded in battle while protecting his sister Furiae, he is forced to make a pact with a red dragon named Angelus. As they journey together, they join with Hierarch Verdelet on a quest to prevent the Empire from destroying magical seals that keep the world in balance: Furiae acts as the central seal, and her death will drop the world into chaos.

Takamasa Shiba and Takuya Iwasaki conceived the game as a hybrid between the popular "<a href="Dynasty%20Warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a>" series and Namco's aerial combat game "<a href="Ace%20Combat">Ace Combat</a>". It was Shiba's first project as a producer. The dark story was created by director <a href="Yoko%20Taro">Yoko Taro</a> and Sawako Natori, who wrote the majority of the script. The music was written by <a href="Nobuyoshi%20Sano">Nobuyoshi Sano</a> and Takayuki Aihara. "Drakengard" sold well in Japan and received mixed to positive reviews in the west: reviewers praised the game's story and music, but were mixed about the graphics and criticized the gameplay for being repetitive.

"Drakengard" is an <a href="Action%20role-playing%20game">action role-playing</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> featuring three types of gameplay: ground missions, aerial missions, and Free Expedition Mode. The gameplay modes are called Ground Mode, Strafe Mode, and Air Mode. In some <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a>, players can switch between ground-based and aerial combat. Ground-based gameplay primarily has the player controlling the main protagonist, Caim. He has access to three types of attack: a standard sword-slash, a magic attack and a dash attack that throws enemies to the ground. Additional weapons can be accessed and swapped via the menu. Weapons gain <a href="Experience%20point%23Level-based%20progression">experience levels</a> through use, dealing more damage as a result. Each has a <a href="level%20cap">four-level cap</a>. The player can access up to eight weapons during a mission. Pressing the attack button repeatedly while in combat with enemy units triggers <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combos</a>, and pressing another button mid-combo will trigger a special attack which will temporarily incapacitate enemy units in the immediate area. The player can also temporarily switch between Caim and an assigned ally, who shares similar attacks but deals more damage. These allies are gained in optional levels and can only be summoned a limited number of times.

In aerial combat missions, players control Caim's dragon partner Angelus. During these moments, players are directed against multiple aerial targets that must be destroyed in order to win. As Angelus gains <a href="experience%20points">experience points</a> through combat, she levels up and is able to do more damage – similar to the weapons used in ground-based combat. Boss battles are all located in these aerial stages. Angelus has access to two types of standard fire attacks: a free-aim blast that causes high damage, and homing bolts that can hit multiple targets but do less damage. Homing shots can be dodged or countered by some enemy types later in the game. Angelus can also perform a special area-affecting magical attack that damages or kills multiple enemy units. She can be used to quickly traverse battle areas during primarily ground-based missions. Players can summon Angelus during certain ground-based missions and play her in Strafe Mode. Controls are identical to ground-based combat. Pressing the select button causes Caim to dismount Angelus. Caim and Angelus level up during combat in different ways: as Caim levels up, their shared health meter grows, while Angelus' leveling increases the damage her attacks do to enemy units.

Players can navigate the game world and select missions via a <a href="Overworld">world map</a> accessed between levels. While playing, a mini-map allows the player to see enemy locations, and a full-screen map can be switched to that covers the entire area and shows mission objectives. "Drakengard"s levels are called verses, and the verses are grouped across thirteen chapters. Each level has a time limit of one hour for players to complete them. Normal levels are numbered, while additional levels are marked by Roman numerals. The game features five endings: the normal ending and four additional endings which are unlocked when certain conditions are met, such as completing optional chapters or obtaining powerful weapons. 

"Drakengard" takes place in a medieval <a href="dark%20fantasy">dark fantasy</a> world called Midgard. The world is protected from falling into chaos by the Seals, objects magically linked to a woman chosen as the Goddess of the Seal. If the seals and the Goddess were destroyed, malevolent beings known as the Watchers would enter the world to destroy humanity. A key element of the world is the ability for a human and a beast to form a pact, a ritual that ties their souls together and grants great power. Their lives become bound by the pact, and the human pays a price for it in the form of some attribute (e.g. their voice, their eyesight or their ability to age). During the events of "Drakengard", the Union, which protects the Seals, is in the midst of a religious war with the Empire, a power led by a cult who believe that destroying the seals will bring them good fortune.

The main characters are , a deposed prince of the Union, and , a red dragon. Joining Caim and Angelus in optional sections of the story are , a hermit who loses his brothers in an attack by the Empire; , an elf woman driven mad by the murder of her family; and , a young boy from the Empire whose village was destroyed by the cult's devotees. Other prominent characters are , Caim's sister and the current Goddess of the Seal; , Furiae's former fiancé; , a priest in charge of protecting the Goddess Seal; and , Seere's sister, leader of the enemy cult and the game's main antagonist.

"Drakengard" opens with Caim in the midst of a battle to protect his sister from the Empire. During the battle, Caim is injured, and going to Furiae's castle finds Angelus severely wounded from torture. Despite their mutual mistrust, Caim and Angelus agree to make a pact and save each other. After repelling the attack, Furiae and Inuart go with Caim to find safety, encountering Verdelet on their travels. Inuart is captured, tortured and brainwashed by Manah, eventually kidnapping Furiae in the belief that he can save her from her fate as the Goddess and earn her love. Verdelet and Caim travel to each of the three Seals, but each time arrive too late to stop them being destroyed. Eventually, the Union and the Empire engage in battle and the Union are victorious. After the battle, however, the Union's surviving troops are decimated by an unknown force and the Empire's troops return to life. Caim and Angelus travel to a fortress that has appeared in the sky, where they find that Furiae has killed herself, breaking the final seal. Inuart, seeing her body, is released from his brainwashing and takes her away.

Optional areas allow Caim to find and recruit Leonard and Seere, and take along Arioch to protect others from her madness. Subsequent playthroughs and extra chapters reveal further details about the characters. Leonard's self-imposed seclusion is because he was trying to suppress his <a href="pedophilia">pedophilia</a>, and the guilt at his brothers' deaths stems from the fact that he gave in to his cravings and left them unprotected. Arioch's madness takes the form of cannibalism of children, in the belief that they would be safe from harm within her. Furiae is also revealed to feel romantic love for Caim, which led to Inuart becoming jealous and vulnerable to Manah's influence. During the events leading to the third ending, Manah reveals Furiae's feelings for Caim, who shows revulsion at the revelation: due to this and the Watchers' influence, Furiae stabs herself. Manah was abused by her and Seere's mother, but Seere was never subjected to the abuse, leading him to feel guilty. The abuse Manah received and her longing for love eventually drove her insane, and she was chosen to become the Watchers' agent.

There are five possible endings, four of which are unlocked after fulfilling certain conditions. In the first ending, Caim and Angelus confront Manah and defeat her. Manah asks them to kill her, but Angelus declares that she must live with her crimes. Angelus then offers herself as the new Goddess of the Seal for Caim's sake. As Verdelet performs the ritual, Angelus tells Caim her name before fading away. In the second ending Inuart uses a magical object called a "Seed of Resurrection" to resurrect Furiae: while successful, the Seed turns her into a monster, and she kills Inuart. Caim is forced to kill her, but not before clones of her are produced from other Seeds to destroy humanity. In the third ending, after Furiae's suicide, Caim and Angelus stop Inuart's attempt to resurrect her and confront Manah, who is killed by another dragon. With the dragons now being driven to destroy mankind, Angelus breaks her pact with Caim and fights him to the death. Caim then prepares to die fighting the other dragons. In the fourth ending, Seere has his Golem pact partner kill the deranged Manah, causing the fortress to collapse. Caim, Seere, Leonard and Arioch escape, while Inuart and Furiae are killed inside. With Manah dead, the Watchers descend on the Imperial capital, with Leonard and Arioch dying at their hands. Caim and Angelus then sacrifice themselves to allow Seere to use his powers to seal the city and the Watchers in a timeless zone, nullifying their threat. In the fifth ending, Caim and Angelus instead attack the queen and the three disappear through a portal. After engaging the queen monster in a <a href="rhythm%20game">rhythm game</a> in modern-day <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, the two destroy it, and are then shot down by a fighter jet.

The original idea for "Drakengard" originated between Takamasa Shiba and Takuya Iwasaki when they were working at Cavia. It was conceived as an aerial battle game similar to "<a href="Ace%20Combat">Ace Combat</a>". The four-year development was Shiba's first project as a producer. The team developing the game went under the moniker of "Project Dragonsphere". As development progressed, ground-based battles were also incorporated after the success in Japan of "<a href="Dynasty%20Warriors%202">Dynasty Warriors 2</a>". Creating the change from ground to aerial gameplay was exceptionally difficult for the team as they encountered problems with the PlayStation 2 hardware. Jun Iwasaki, president and <a href="chief%20executive%20officer">chief executive officer</a> of Square Enix USA, described "Drakengard" as a "perfect hybrid of genres", citing its story and gameplay as reasons why it would be enjoyed by players who wanted a "deeper action game". Speaking in 2013, Shiba commented that Cavia had been inexperienced in creating action games, and as such it was not up to the standards of its contemporaries. The game's battle scenes were inspired by films such as the 1999 version of "<a href="The%20Mummy%20%281999%20film%29">The Mummy</a>" and its spin-off "<a href="The%20Scorpion%20King">The Scorpion King</a>", as well as films like "<a href="Dragonheart">Dragonheart</a>" and epic films from Asia. Iwasaki was unable to take up the position of director because of other projects he was involved with: the position instead went to <a href="Yoko%20Taro">Yoko Taro</a>. Cavia staff member Yosuke Saito acted as the game's programmer—Saito would go on to work on later entries in the series.

During production, the team were asked to make multiple adjustments and changes to its content by "Drakengard"s advisory board. It was annoying enough for Yoko that he decided at the time not to make another "Drakengard". "Drakengard" was first shown off to the western public at <a href="History%20of%20E3%232003">E3 2003</a>. It underwent multiple changes for its western release. The original title, "Drag-On Dragoon," was chosen for its sound, but was not considered right for the western market. Because of this, it was changed to "Drakengard". In addition, some of the more mature themes, such as references to incest and sexual taboos, were censored in the western localization. It also underwent major debugging and an alteration in the angle of the in-game camera before its European release. While Square Enix published the title in Japan and North America, <a href="Take-Two%20Interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> was chosen to publish it in European territories. The mobile port was part of Square Enix's plans to branch out into the European mobile game market. It was co-developed with London-based mobile developer <a href="Macrospace">Macrospace</a> as part of a collaboration between Square Enix and <a href="Vodafone">Vodafone</a>, designed to function on the <a href="Vodafone%20live%21">Vodafone live!</a> service. It was first released in Germany, then made available in the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy.

The setting, mythos and landscape were primarily inspired by the folklore of <a href="Northern%20Europe">Northern Europe</a>, while other elements drew from Japanese-style <a href="Revisionism%20%28fictional%29">revisionism</a>. According to Shiba, multiple elements of the story and world were created to be dark, sad and serious in tone, in contrast to the likes of "<a href="Dragon%20Quest">Dragon Quest</a>" and "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>". One of the core narrative threads, involving romantic feelings between siblings, was inspired in Yoko's mind by the <a href="anime">anime</a> series "<a href="Sister%20Princess">Sister Princess</a>". Another series that inspired the team was "<a href="Neon%20Genesis%20Evangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>", with a comparison being drawn between them due to a shared trait: while having standard premises, darker narrative elements were hidden in its content. The central narrative theme was "Immorality", which was mostly demonstrated by writer Sawako Natori through the characters. Multiple endings were made because Yoko was told that the game would not have a sequel. The characters' stories were created by Yoko and Iwasaki, who independently created the character backgrounds: Yoko took charge of Seere, Leonard and Arioch, while Iwasaki was involved in developing Verdelet, Inuart and Caim. In an interview concerning her role in the game, Natori admitted to feeling embarrassed by her writing when hearing <a href="Sota%20Murakami">Sota Murakami</a> and Natsuki Yamashita, who voiced Seere and Manah, speak their lines.

Caim, the main protagonist, was meant to be an examination of the typical action game hero, which Yoko felt should not have a happy ending in a story focused on violence. The nature of Caim and Angelus' relationship underwent changes during development: Yoko had conceived their relationship as a parasitic one, but Iwasaki wanted to create a different type of romance, and so wrote the love story for the two of them. The actor who portrayed the two was <a href="Peter%20%28actor%29">Shinnosuke Ikehata</a>: though originally cast for the role of Caim, his versatility also got him the role of Angelus. Furiae was designed by Yoko as both an explanation for Caim and Inuart's rivalry, and as a representation of his distaste for the kind of forgettable character she represented. The relationship between Caim and Furiae, as well as their ultimate fates, was Yoko's response to the standard happy ending found in most role-playing games at the time, which he felt did not fit in with a protagonist who had killed hundreds during their quest. The second ending was principally inspired by this and his dislike for "Sister Princess". Caim and Furiae were respectively based around Guts from "<a href="Berserk%20%28manga%29">Berserk</a>" and <a href="Rei%20Ayanami">Rei Ayanami</a> from "Neon Genesis Evangelion", with Caim being codenamed "Guts" during development.

Inuart was originally designed as the main protagonist of "Drakengard", with him being a "useless hero". A pivotal scene in the game, where he first clashes with Caim, became one of the ways Yoko was able to properly project his vision of the game's world. Verdelet was portrayed as the "despicable elder", who cared for no-one except himself: his personality was intended to be both ineffectual and bossy, even in the face of catastrophe. Manah's role in "Drakengard" was designed to represent unloved children. The fifth ending, a boss battle in modern-day Tokyo, was created as a joke ending in the same vein as the "<a href="Silent%20Hill">Silent Hill</a>" series and an unexpected twist for players who were expecting an upbeat tone after the previous endings. Titled "the End of dragon sphere", this ending served as a tribute to "<a href="The%20End%20of%20Evangelion">The End of Evangelion</a>".

Character designs were done by Kimihiko Fujisaka. "Drakengard" was his first job as a character designer: his designs were firmly seated within the Medieval European aesthetic. To achieve this, he imagined that he had been sent back to that historical period. His designs were inspired by the character designs of "Final Fantasy" and "Dragon Quest". Caim was one of the earliest characters created for "Drakengard". In Inuart's design, Fujisaka incorporated heavy armor into his design to give a more forceful impression for players. His ultimate role and final design were based around the idea of him being Caim's rival. The design of the black dragon, which acted as Inuart's pact beast, did not impress Shiba, who considered cutting it from the final product. Manah's red clothing was designed to evoke both its status as the game's key color, and her status as the leader of the Cult of the Watchers. Shiba approved of the design, feeling that it contrasted nicely with Furiae's predominantly white design. Fujisaka also helped design Furiae's monster form for the game's second ending. In hindsight, Fujisaka was dissatisfied with his work on "Drakengard", particularly his work on Caim. The game's monsters were designed by Taro Hasegawa.

The music was composed by <a href="Nobuyoshi%20Sano">Nobuyoshi Sano</a> and Takayuki Aihara: the two used excerpts from pieces of classical music (selected by Aihara), then rearranged, remixed and layered them. Their main objective was to create music that emulated the gameplay, as well as the story and general narrative theme of "madness". The music was intended to be "experimental" and "expressionistic" rather than "commercial". The theme song, , was composed by Sano, written by Natori and sung by <a href="Eriko%20Hatsune">Eriko Hatsune</a>. The soundtrack was originally released in two volumes under the names "Drag-On Dragoon Original Soundtrack Vol.1" and "Drag-On Dragoon Original Soundtrack Vol.2", released on October 22 and November 21, 2003, respectively. The soundtrack was re-released on April 20, 2011, as a two-disc set under the title "Drag-On Dragoon Original Soundtrack".

"Drakengard" sold more than 122,000 units in its first week of release in Japan, taking ""s place at the top of the sales charts. By the end of 2003, it had sold 241,014 copies. Gaming magazine "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" ranked it as the 50th best-selling title of 2003, and sold well enough that it was made part of <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a>'s Ultimate Hits series, re-releases of popular titles. Its strong sales were attributed by the team to its cinematic story and similarity to the popular "Dynasty Warriors" series. In Europe, the game sold 110,000 units by November 2004.

According to <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>, "Drakengard" received favorable reviews in Japan. "Famitsu" gave it an overall score of 29/40. After the game's reveal at E3, multiple video game publications, including "", <a href="IGN">IGN</a> and "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>", praised its promising story and mixture of gameplay genres. The game received "average" reviews, according to video game <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>.

The story received the highest amount of praise. IGN's Jeremy Dunham called it the game's "biggest strength", praising the edgy themes explored and the balance between fantasy and realism. He also praised the multiple parallels with "Neon Genesis Evangelion". The reviewer for <a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a> (CVG) praised "the maturity and wit of the dialogue and unfolding plot", noting that they stood alongside other Square Enix RPGs of the time. VideoGamer.com's Adam Jarvis praised the game's storytelling style, saying that while it became "a little bogged down at various points, it is deep enough to keep your interest throughout the game." GameSpot's <a href="Greg%20Kasavin">Greg Kasavin</a> said that "though the story itself is awkwardly paced and is sometimes difficult to keep up with, it becomes one of the main motivating factors for wanting to get all the way through to the end of the game."

The graphics received mixed responses. Kasavin said the game "looks decent but, ultimately, not all that good". He criticized the bland environments and awkward movements for enemy units and the playable character, but praised the design of the dragon. "Game Informer" was more positive, praising the graphical detail and cutscenes and the look of enemy units, despite finding pop-up issues and framerate dips. Jarvis praised the design of the main cast, but cited the repetitive enemy design and dark environments as detracting elements. Dunham praised the character and monster designs as well as the full-motion cutscenes, but was less impressed by the repetitive human enemy designs, bland environments and low <a href="draw%20distance">draw distance</a>. The full-motion videos were also praised by the CVG reviewer.

Reaction to the sound design was mixed to positive. Dunham praised the majority of the British-style voice acting, but called the music "disappointing". "Game Informer" cited the low number of background tracks and voice acting "straight out of a renaissance festival" as poorer parts of the game. Kasavin praised the voice acting and called the music "the most nerve-racking and most intense aspect of the game." Jarvis was also positive, praising the sound design for battles, most of the voice acting and the music, which "[helped] create a suitably dark atmosphere."

Reception of the gameplay was mixed to negative, with Dunham saying it suffered the same problems as its derivative games despite its easy entertainment value, while Jarvis called the options in gameplay "fairly limited". The CVG reviewer praised the aerial segments of gameplay, calling them the most entertaining, and found that the standard combat served to embellish the protagonist's "kick-ass persona, making him more than just another anonymous dragon rider". The main criticism was repetition in the gameplay. Kasavin was exceptionally critical, saying that the gameplay both made the process of playing laborious and detracted from the main story. "Game Informer" called the gameplay "fun, but [lacking] any semblance of depth."

"Drakengard" received two novelizations by Emi Nagashima (writing as Jun Eishima) and Takashi Aizawa. The game's events were retold again in a special story titled "Drakengard 1.3", which followed on from the spin-off manga "Drag-On Dragoon: Shi ni Itaru Aka". In March 2014, <a href="Hardcore%20Gamer">Hardcore Gamer</a>'s Jahanzeb Khan favorably referred to the game as a precursor to the <a href="Game%20of%20Thrones">TV adaptation</a> of the book series "<a href="A%20Song%20of%20Ice%20and%20Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a>" in its handling of taboo themes and violence. The game was considered successful enough in Japan by Square Enix that a sequel was commissioned. "<a href="Drakengard%202">Drakengard 2</a>" was again produced by Shiba, but Yoko was replaced as director by Akira Yasui, resulting in numerous thematic changes. Originally set following the first ending of "Drakengard", it was later <a href="Retroactive%20continuity">retconned</a> into an isolated timeline. A prequel, "<a href="Drakengard%203">Drakengard 3</a>", was released in 2013, with multiple staff members returning to their original roles.

An attempt to create another title in the series resulted in the spin-off "<a href="Nier%20%28video%20game%29">Nier</a>", which retains links and themes from the main series. "Nier" takes place over a thousand years after the events of "Drakengard"s fifth ending. When Cavia was absorbed by <a href="AQ%20Interactive">AQ Interactive</a> after "Nier"s release, a future attempt by Shiba to continue the series was unsuccessful. A sequel, "", was developed by <a href="PlatinumGames">PlatinumGames</a> in collaboration with previous "Nier" staff and released in 2017, taking place after "Nier"'s fourth ending.

M-1 (Michigan highway)

M-1, commonly known as Woodward Avenue, is a north–south <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> in the <a href="Metro%20Detroit">Metro Detroit</a> area of the US state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. The highway, called "Detroit's Main Street", runs from <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> north-northwesterly to <a href="Pontiac%2C%20Michigan">Pontiac</a>. It is one of the five principal avenues of Detroit, along with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2012%20in%20Michigan">Michigan</a>, <a href="U.S.%20Route%2016%20in%20Michigan">Grand River</a>, <a href="M-3%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">Gratiot</a>, and <a href="Jefferson%20Avenue%20%28Detroit%29">Jefferson</a> avenues. These streets were <a href="plat">plat</a>ted in 1805 by Judge <a href="Augustus%20B.%20Woodward">Augustus B. Woodward</a>, namesake to Woodward Avenue. The <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> (FHWA) has listed the highway as the Automotive Heritage Trail, an <a href="All-American%20Road">All-American Road</a> in the National Scenic Byways Program. It has also been designated a <a href="Pure%20Michigan%20Byway">Pure Michigan Byway</a> by the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT), and was also included in the <a href="MotorCities%20National%20Heritage%20Area">MotorCities National Heritage Area</a> designated by the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">US Congress</a> in 1998.

The trunkline is the dividing line between Detroit's East and West sides, and connects to some of the city's major freeways like <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">Interstate 94</a> (I-94, Edsel Ford Freeway) and <a href="M-8%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-8</a> (Davison Freeway). Woodward Avenue exits Detroit at <a href="M-102%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-102</a> (8 Mile Road) and runs through the city's northern suburbs in <a href="Oakland%20County%2C%20Michigan">Oakland County</a> on its way to Pontiac. In between, Woodward Avenue passes through several historic districts in Detroit and provides access to many businesses in the area. The name "Woodward Avenue" has become synonymous with Detroit, <a href="Cruising%20%28driving%29">cruising</a> culture and the automotive industry.

Woodward Avenue was created after the Detroit Fire of 1805. The thoroughfare followed the route of the <a href="Saginaw%20Trail">Saginaw Trail</a>, an Indian trail that linked Detroit with Pontiac, <a href="Flint%2C%20Michigan">Flint</a>, and <a href="Saginaw%2C%20Michigan">Saginaw</a>. The Saginaw Trail connected to the <a href="Mackinaw%20Trail">Mackinaw Trail</a>, which ran north to the <a href="Straits%20of%20Mackinac">Straits of Mackinac</a> at the tip of the <a href="Lower%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Lower Peninsula of Michigan</a>. In the age of the <a href="auto%20trail">auto trail</a>s, Woodward Avenue was part of the <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt%20International%20Highway">Theodore Roosevelt International Highway</a> that connected <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland, Maine</a>, with <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, through <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> in Canada. It was also part of the <a href="Dixie%20Highway">Dixie Highway</a>, which connected Michigan with <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. Woodward Avenue was the location of the first mile (1.6 km) of concrete-paved roadway in the country. When Michigan created the State Trunkline Highway System in 1913, the roadway was included, numbered as part of <a href="M-10%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-10</a> in 1919. Later, it was part of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2010%20in%20Michigan">US Highway 10</a> (US 10) following the creation of the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a>. Since 1970, it has borne the M-1 designation. The roadway carried <a href="streetcar">streetcar</a> lines from the 1860s until the 1950s; a new streetcar line known as the <a href="QLine">QLine</a> opened along part of M-1 in 2017.

Like other state highways in Michigan, the section of Woodward Avenue designated M-1 is maintained by MDOT. In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on <a href="average%20annual%20daily%20traffic">average</a>, 64,713 vehicles used the highway daily north of 11 Mile Road and 17,345 vehicles did so each day in <a href="Highland%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Highland Park</a>, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. All of M-1 north of <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">I-75</a> is listed on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. As well as the sections of Woodward Avenue in Pontiac that are part of <a href="Interstate%2075%20Business%20%28Pontiac%2C%20Michigan%29">Business Loop I-75</a> (BL I-75) and <a href="U.S.%20Route%2024%20Business%20%28Pontiac%2C%20Michigan%29">Business US 24</a> (Bus. US 24), all of M-1 is a <a href="Pure%20Michigan%20Byway">Pure Michigan Byway</a> and an <a href="All-American%20Road">All-American Road</a>. Woodward Avenue is considered to be the divider between the East and West sides of the city of Detroit.

Woodward Avenue starts at an intersection with <a href="Jefferson%20Avenue%20%28Detroit%29">Jefferson Avenue</a> next to <a href="Hart%20Plaza">Hart Plaza</a> about from the <a href="Detroit%20River">Detroit River</a>. The plaza is regarded as the birthplace of the <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford Motor Company</a>, and it is located near <a href="Cobo%20Center">Cobo Center</a> and the <a href="Renaissance%20Center">Renaissance Center</a>, headquarters for <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> (GM). Woodward Avenue runs north-northwesterly away from the river through the heart of downtown Detroit and the <a href="Detroit%20Financial%20District">Financial District</a>. Along the way, it passes several important and historic sites, including <a href="List%20of%20buildings%20located%20along%20Woodward%20Avenue">notable buildings</a> like <a href="One%20Woodward%20Avenue">One Woodward Avenue</a>, the <a href="Guardian%20Building">Guardian Building</a>, and <a href="The%20Qube%20%28Detroit%29">The Qube</a>. Woodward also passes "<a href="The%20Spirit%20of%20Detroit">The Spirit of Detroit</a>", a statue used to symbolize the city. Further north, Woodward Avenue runs around <a href="Campus%20Martius%20Park">Campus Martius Park</a> and enters the <a href="Lower%20Woodward%20Avenue%20Historic%20District">Lower Woodward Avenue Historic District</a>, a retail, commercial, and residential district listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> (NRHP). After that historic district, the avenue travels through the middle of <a href="Grand%20Circus%20Park%20Historic%20District">Grand Circus Park</a>; the northern edge of the park is bounded by Adams Avenue, where state maintenance begins.

North of Adams Avenue, Woodward Avenue is a state trunkline designated M-1. The highway crosses to the west of <a href="Comerica%20Park">Comerica Park</a> and <a href="Ford%20Field">Ford Field</a>, home of Major League Baseball's <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> and the National Football League's <a href="Detroit%20Lions">Detroit Lions</a>, respectively. Woodward passes the historic <a href="Fox%20Theatre%20%28Detroit%2C%20Michigan%29">Fox Theatre</a> before it crosses over I-75 (Fisher Freeway) without an interchange; access between the two highways is through the <a href="service%20drive">service drive</a>s that connect to adjacent interchanges. North of the freeway, M-1 passes <a href="Little%20Caesars%20Arena">Little Caesars Arena</a>, home of the National Hockey League's <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a> and the National Basketball Association's <a href="Detroit%20Pistons">Detroit Pistons</a>. A six-lane street, the highway travels through mixed residential and commercial areas of <a href="Midtown%2C%20Detroit">Midtown</a> including the <a href="Midtown%20Woodward%20Historic%20District">Midtown Woodward Historic District</a>, another district listed on the NRHP. South of I-94, Woodward heads through the <a href="Cultural%20Center%20Historic%20District%20%28Detroit%2C%20Michigan%29">Cultural Center Historic District</a>, which includes the campus of <a href="Wayne%20State%20University">Wayne State University</a>, the <a href="Detroit%20Public%20Library">Detroit Public Library</a>, and the <a href="Detroit%20Institute%20of%20Arts">Detroit Institute of Arts</a>; the institute and the nearby <a href="Detroit%20Historical%20Museum">Detroit Historical Museum</a> showcase the city's automotive history.
North of I-94, Woodward passes through <a href="New%20Center%2C%20Detroit">New Center</a>; this district is home to <a href="Cadillac%20Place">Cadillac Place</a>, the former headquarters of GM. The neighborhoods on either side of the highway transition in composition north of New Center; this area is mostly residential in nature. Between the intersections with Webb Street/Woodland Street and Tuxedo Street/Tennyson Street, Woodward Avenue leaves the city of Detroit for the first time and crosses into Highland Park, an <a href="enclave">enclave</a> within Detroit. It is within Highland Park that M-1 intersects M-8, the Davison Freeway. Woodward passes over the Davison, which was the first urban, depressed freeway in the US, at an interchange south of Highland Park's downtown business district. M-1 crosses that district and runs next to the historic <a href="Highland%20Park%20Ford%20Plant">Highland Park Ford Plant</a>, home of the original moving assembly line used to produce <a href="Model%20T">Model T</a>s; opened in 1910, the plant's assembly line dropped the time needed to build a car from 12 hours to 93 minutes and allowed Ford to meet demand for the car.

M-1 crosses back into Detroit at the intersection with McNichols Road; the latter street occupies the 6 Mile location in Detroit's <a href="Mile%20Road%20System%20%28Detroit%29">Mile Road System</a>. North of this intersection, Woodward Avenue widens into a <a href="boulevard">boulevard</a>, a divided street with a median; left turns along this section of roadway are made by performing a <a href="Michigan%20left">Michigan left</a> maneuver using the U-turn crossovers in the median. Between McNichols and 7 Mile Road, Woodward Avenue travels to the east of the <a href="Detroit%20Golf%20Club">Detroit Golf Club</a> in the <a href="Palmer%20Park%20%28Detroit%29">Palmer Park</a> area. North of 7 Mile, the highway runs to the west of the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Fair">Michigan State Fair</a>grounds and to the east of the <a href="Palmer%20Woods%20Historic%20District">Palmer Woods Historic District</a>. The northern edge of the fairgrounds is at <a href="M-102%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-102</a> (8 Mile Road), which is also where Woodward Avenue exits Detroit for the second time; the two boulevards cross in a large <a href="interchange%20%28road%29">interchange</a>.

Crossing the border into the suburb of <a href="Ferndale%2C%20Michigan">Ferndale</a> in <a href="Oakland%20County%2C%20Michigan">Oakland County</a>, the highway runs through residential neighborhoods but is lined with adjacent businesses. The intersection with 9 Mile Road marks the suburb's downtown area. Further north in <a href="Pleasant%20Ridge%2C%20Michigan">Pleasant Ridge</a>, the north-northwesterly path of Woodward Avenue changes as the road turns to the northwest. After the curve, M-1 meets <a href="Interstate%20696">I-696</a> (Reuther Freeway); immediately north of this interchange in <a href="Huntington%20Woods%2C%20Michigan">Huntington Woods</a> is the <a href="Detroit%20Zoo">Detroit Zoo</a>. North of 11 Mile Road, Woodward Avenue forms the border between <a href="Berkley%2C%20Michigan">Berkley</a> to the west and <a href="Royal%20Oak%2C%20Michigan">Royal Oak</a> to the east. The highway passes the Roseland Park Cemetery north of 12 Mile Road before crossing fully into Royal Oak. Near 13 Mile Road, the trunkline passes through a commercial district anchored by a shopping center and the Beaumont Hospital. North of 14 Mile Road in <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Michigan">Birmingham</a>, M-1 and Woodward Avenue leaves the original route, which is named Old Woodward Avenue, and runs to the east of it to bypass that suburb's downtown area. The highway crosses the <a href="River%20Rouge%20%28Michigan%29">River Rouge</a> and returns to its original routing north of Maple (15 Mile) Road.
North of Birmingham, Woodward crosses through part of <a href="Bloomfield%20Township%2C%20Oakland%20County%2C%20Michigan">Bloomfield Township</a> for the first time before entering <a href="Bloomfield%20Hills%2C%20Michigan">Bloomfield Hills</a>. That suburb's downtown is centered on the intersection with Long Lake Road; Woodward passes between a pair of golf courses north of there. The highway enters the south side of Pontiac's residential neighborhoods after crossing back into Bloomfield Township. At the intersection with Square Lake Road, M-1 terminates. Woodward Avenue continues northwesterly into Pontiac carrying the BL I-75 and Bus. US 24 designations; it terminates after the two directions of the boulevard diverge and form a <a href="one-way%20traffic">one-way</a> loop around the city's business district.

Many historical sites are located along Woodward Avenue, which was included in the <a href="MotorCities%20National%20Heritage%20Area">MotorCities National Heritage Area</a> when it was created on November 6, 1998. The road was designated what is now called a <a href="Pure%20Michigan%20Byway">Pure Michigan Byway</a> by MDOT in 1999, and a <a href="National%20Scenic%20Byway">National Scenic Byway</a> by the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">FHWA</a> National Scenic Byways Program on June 13, 2002, the only urban road at the time with that classification. It was later upgraded to All-American Road status on October 16, 2009; such roads have highly unique features and are significant enough to be tourist destinations unto themselves. In announcing the byway status in 2002, <a href="Norman%20Mineta">Norman Mineta</a>, then <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Transportation">United States Secretary of Transportation</a>, said that "Woodward Avenue put the world on wheels, and America's automobile heritage is represented along this corridor."
The Woodward Avenue Action Association (WA3), the local agency that acts as the stewards and advocates for the All-American Road and Pure Michigan Byway designations as well as adjacent historical sites, obtained a grant for $45,000 from the FHWA in 2011 to install a set of 50 custom road signs along M-1 between Detroit and Pontiac. WA3 sells replicas of these signs to discourage theft. Profits are also being used along with money from clothing and other merchandise to support the Woodward Avenue Beautification Fund, a special endowment created in 2010 to aid the 11 communities along the highway with maintenance and to defray costs associated with special events on the avenue.

As well as the custom signage, WA3 has received FHWA grant funding to erect a series of lighted "tributes": solar-powered, lighted pillars that contain artwork related to the roadway. The $150,000 glass and concrete sculptures are being placed in the median along Woodward Avenue to serve as landmarks along the route of the roadway and to brand it for tourists. A total of 10 to 12 installations are planned for the length of the highway in Wayne and Oakland counties. The art project received a 2011 National Scenic Byway Award for the Byways interpretation category.

The area around Woodward was once nicknamed "Piety Hill". There are 22 <a href="Religious%20Structures%20of%20Woodward%20Avenue%20Thematic%20Resource">churches on the NRHP</a> along the street in Detroit and Highland Park. According to "<a href="The%20Detroit%20News">The Detroit News</a>", the sounds of church bells and horse hooves were some of the most distinctive sounds on Sundays along Woodward Avenue in the early 20th century. The street was home to jazz clubs starting in the 1910s and 1920s, starting a period of transition. During the 1940s, ministers lobbied for a law to prevent the issuance of additional liquor licenses in their neighborhood; the law was later overturned in 1950. Nightclubs along Woodward hosted a burgeoning music scene in the early days of rock 'n roll, and the area also had plenty of bars and burlesque shows as late as the 1970s. One local journalist called the mix of churches, clubs, and bars along Woodward Avenue "a precarious balance between the sacred and the profane".

As well as music clubs, many of Detroit's other major entertainment venues are located on or near Woodward in downtown Detroit, including the <a href="Fox%20Theatre%20%28Detroit%29">Fox Theatre</a>, <a href="Majestic%20Theater%20%28Detroit%2C%20Michigan%29">Majestic Theater</a>, and the rest of the <a href="Detroit%20Theater%20District">theater district</a>, the second-largest in the country. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the area was likewise home to 24-hour movie theaters and bowling alleys. Curfews across the river in <a href="Windsor%2C%20Ontario">Windsor, Ontario</a>, meant that many patrons during the war years were Canadian. They frequented the establishments along with the Americans, many of whom worked in the factories of the Detroit area. The theater district has undergone a renaissance after renovations and improvements during the 1980s and 1990s, leading to a resurgence in the performing arts in the city. In 2002, the Fox Theatre outsold the larger <a href="Radio%20City%20Music%20Hall">Radio City Music Hall</a> in Manhattan, earning the "No. 1 theater in North America" title from "Pollstar", an industry trade journal, and the district is considered the second largest in the country.
An adjacent sports and entertainment district has been created near Woodward Avenue in the 21st century. "District Detroit" as it is called includes <a href="Comerica%20Park">Comerica Park</a> (2000), <a href="Ford%20Field">Ford Field</a> (2002) and <a href="Little%20Caesars%20Arena">Little Caesars Arena</a> (2017), which are the home venues for all four of Detroit's professional sports teams. The district is the most compact collection in any American city, according to Patrick Rishe, the director of the Sports Business Program at <a href="Washington%20University%20in%20St.%20Louis">Washington University in St. Louis</a>.

Woodward Avenue's connection to Detroit's automobile culture dates back to the early 20th century. Around 100 automobile companies were founded along the roadway. <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a> developed and first produced the <a href="Model%20T">Model T</a> in 1907–08 at his <a href="Ford%20Piquette%20Avenue%20Plant">Piquette Avenue Plant</a> to the east of Woodward Avenue. The first 12,000 Model Ts were built there, before Ford moved production of his cars to the Highland Park plant adjacent to Woodward Avenue in 1910. Employees at the plant used the <a href="streetcar">streetcar</a> system along Woodward to get to work; these lines also provided transportation options to assembly plant workers affected by gas rationing during World War II. During the 1950s and 1960s, automobile engineers street tested their cars along Woodward Avenue between 8 Mile and Square Lake roads; the roadway was the only such location where this activity was practiced.

Young carriage drivers raced one another along Woodward Avenue after the roadway was converted from logs to planks in 1848. They placed bets on each other's carriages while racing from tavern to tavern. By 1958, the roadway was used for unofficial street racing with cars. The wide width, median and sections lacking a large commercial presence attracted a reputation for the competition. The numerous <a href="drive-in">drive-in</a>s, each with its dedicated local teenaged clientele, were also popular. Woodward had numerous car dealerships and automobile accessory shops in the age of the <a href="muscle%20car">muscle car</a> which completed the formula for young adults to "<a href="Cruising%20%28driving%29">cruise</a>", race and hang out along the road.

The Woodward Dream Cruise takes place on Woodward Avenue between Pontiac and Ferndale during August of each year, evoking nostalgia of the 1950s and 1960s, when it was common for young drivers to cruise with their cars on Woodward Avenue. The event attracts huge crowds of classic car owners and admirers from around the world to the Metro Detroit area in celebration of Detroit's automotive history; an estimated one million spectators attended the 2009 event. The cruise was founded in 1995 as a fundraiser for a soccer field in Ferndale. Neighboring cities joined in, and by 1997, auto manufacturers and other vendors had begun sponsoring the event.

In 1701, the first transportation routes through what became the state of Michigan were the lakes, rivers and Indian trails. One of these, the <a href="Saginaw%20Trail">Saginaw Trail</a>, followed what is now Woodward Avenue from the Detroit area north to <a href="Saginaw%2C%20Michigan">Saginaw</a>, where it connected with the <a href="Mackinaw%20Trail">Mackinaw Trail</a> north to the <a href="Straits%20of%20Mackinac">Straits of Mackinac</a>. The Town of Detroit created <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">rights-of-way</a> for the principal streets of the city in 1805. This street plan was devised by Augustus Woodward and others following a devastating fire in Detroit, with a mandate from the territorial governor to improve on the previous plan. Two of these principal streets were established by the territorial government on September 18, 1805, as "permanent public roads, avenues or highways", one of which was to run along the modern routing of Woodward Avenue. The wide avenues, in emulation of the street plan for <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington, DC</a>, were intended to make Detroit look like the "Paris of the West".

Augustus Woodward was a judge in the <a href="Michigan%20Territory">Michigan Territory</a> appointed by his friend, President <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>. He was also a colonel in the territorial militia and a president of one of Detroit's first banks. Woodward named the street for himself, responding whimsically to the resulting criticism: "Not so. The avenue is named Woodward because it runs wood-ward, toward the woods." Other proposals for names included Court House Street or Market Street. For a time, one section was named Congress Street, Witherell Street, Saginaw Road or Saginaw Turnpike, with another section dubbed Pontiac Road. Unlike these other monikers, the avenue retained the judge's name.

Detroit was incorporated in 1815, and the initial roadway to connect Detroit north to Pontiac along the Saginaw Trail was started in 1817; this was a <a href="corduroy%20road">corduroy road</a> built by laying down logs and filling in the gaps with clay or sand. The territorial legislature authorized a survey of the roadway to Pontiac on December 7, 1818, and the route was approved by Governor <a href="Lewis%20Cass">Lewis Cass</a> on December 15, 1819, the first to be done in the future state. The <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a> authorized the construction of a private <a href="plank%20road">plank road</a> with <a href="toll%20road">tolls</a> to connect Detroit with Pontiac in 1848. By the next year, and oak planks were laid along the road between the two communities. Tolls were for vehicles and for a herd of cattle. Tolls along some segments of Woodward Avenue remained in place as late as 1908.
The first automobile in Detroit was driven by Charles Brady King along Woodward Avenue on March 3, 1896, a few weeks before Henry Ford drove his first car in the city. In 1909, the first mile (1.6 km) of <a href="Road%20surface%23Concrete">concrete roadway</a> in the country was paved between 6 and 7 Mile roads at a cost of $14,000 (equivalent to $ in ).

On May 13, 1913, the Legislature created the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state's highway system</a>; Woodward Avenue was included as part of "Division 2". The full length was paved in 1916. The first crows nest traffic tower in the US was installed at the intersection of Woodward and Michigan avenues on October 9, 1917; the tower elevated a police officer above the center of the intersection to direct traffic before the structure was replaced in October 1920 with the world's first four-way <a href="traffic%20light">traffic light</a>. The state signposted its highways in 1919, and Woodward Avenue was assigned the <a href="M-10%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-10</a> designation. The same year, two auto trail designations were applied to the avenue. The <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt%20International%20Highway">Theodore Roosevelt International Highway</a> was created in February 1919, running from Detroit northward along Woodward Avenue. Later that year, the <a href="Dixie%20Highway">Dixie Highway</a> was extended through Detroit to the Straits of Mackinac, following the route of the old Saginaw Trail northward along Woodward Avenue.

Since 1924, Woodward Avenue has hosted <a href="America%27s%20Thanksgiving%20Parade">America's Thanksgiving Parade</a>, the second oldest <a href="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> Day parade in the United States. In 1925, the intersection between Woodward Avenue and State Street was busier than <a href="Times%20Square">Times Square</a>. On November 11, 1926, the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a> was approved by the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20Officials">American Association of State Highway Officials</a> (AASHO); the M-10 designation along Woodward was replaced with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2010%20in%20Michigan">US 10</a>, a moniker that ran from Detroit to <a href="Seattle%2C%20Washington">Seattle, Washington</a>.

Legal disputes over a plan to widen Woodward Avenue dating back to 1874 were resolved in 1932. Permission was needed from a majority of the landowners along Woodward Avenue to finalize the deal. John W. Chandler, general manager of the Woodward Avenue Improvement Association, pledged not to shave his face until he had the necessary permissions in hand. This resolution allowed Woodward to be widened from . Several buildings were removed to clear the wider street path, and <a href="St.%20John%27s%20Episcopal%20Church%20%28Detroit%2C%20Michigan%29">St. John's Episcopal Church</a> was moved to avoid demolition. Work started in 1933 and cost $7.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) to complete.

A bypass of downtown Birmingham opened in 1939, drawing through traffic away from the busy Woodward Avenue–Maple Road intersection. The bypass was originally named Hunter Boulevard. On September 6, 1997, Birmingham renamed the bypass to Woodward Avenue, with the previous alignment of Woodward signed as Old Woodward Avenue.

In October 1969, AASHO approved a realignment of US 10 in the Detroit area; the next year the designation was rerouted to follow the Lodge Freeway (what is now <a href="M-10%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-10</a>) and the portion of Jefferson Avenue between the Lodge Freeway and Randolph Street (then <a href="U.S.%20Route%2025%20in%20Michigan">US 25</a>, now <a href="M-3%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-3</a>). The M-1 designation was applied to the section of Woodward Avenue from Jefferson Avenue in downtown Detroit to Square Lake Road along the southern border of Pontiac. Woodward north of Square Lake Road was designated as a <a href="business%20route">business route</a> of both US 10 and I-75. When US 10 was truncated to <a href="Bay%20City%2C%20Michigan">Bay City</a> in 1986, the Bus. US 10 portion of Woodward became <a href="U.S.%20Route%2024%20Business%20%28Pontiac%2C%20Michigan%29">Bus. US 24</a>.

In the early 1980s, M-1 was truncated in downtown Detroit, as the Woodward Mall was designated in the area around Cadillac Square. At the end of 2000, MDOT proposed several highway transfers in Detroit. Some of these involved transferring city streets in the <a href="Campus%20Martius%20Park">Campus Martius Park</a> area under the department's jurisdiction to city control; another part of the proposal involved MDOT assuming control over a section of Woodward Avenue from Adams Avenue south to Grand River Avenue. These transfers were completed the following year. In 2004, the southern terminus was moved north three blocks to Adams Avenue. In June 2017, the southernmost block of Woodward Avenue south of Larned Street closed to automobiles to create a temporary pedestrian plaza. This closure was made permanent the following November.

On August 27, 1863, the <a href="Detroit%20City%20Railway%20Company">Detroit City Railway Company</a> (DCRC) established streetcar service along Woodward from Jefferson to Adams avenues. The company was formed by investors from <a href="Syracuse%2C%20New%20York">Syracuse, New York</a>, earlier that year. Later, on September 18, 1886, a separate electrified line, the Highland Park Railway, was added that ran along Woodward Avenue through Highland Park. In mid-December 1893, the main streetcar line was electrified by the DCRC. In 1901, the various lines throughout the city were consolidated as the <a href="Detroit%20United%20Railway">Detroit United Railway</a>.

Detroit took control of the Detroit Unified Railway on May 15, 1922; afterwards, the streetcar system became the city's <a href="Detroit%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Department of Street Railways</a>. Following the change in control, the city also formed the Detroit Rapid Transit Commission to build a <a href="subway%20%28rail%29">subway</a> system. Early proposals included a next to <a href="Detroit%20City%20Hall">Detroit City Hall</a>. In 1926, a four-line system encompassing of lines was proposed at a cost of $280 million (equivalent to $ in ). By 1929, plans were scaled back further in the face of tough local economic conditions; the plan submitted to voters included one line of that interconnected with the city's streetcar system by way of two streetcar tunnels. The bond proposal failed by a 2.5:1 margin that year, killing any proposal for a city subway system in Detroit.

The streetcar system, like those in other cities across the US, fell into decline after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Unlike the <a href="Great%20American%20streetcar%20conspiracy">streetcar conspiracy</a> alleged in other cities, the decline of Detroit's publicly owned system was related to a multitude of different factors. Increased spending on roads benefitted competing bus lines, and zoning changes coupled with freeway construction shifted the city's population to areas away from the older streetcar lines. During the early 1950s, several lines were converted to buses after labor strikes, and other lines were eliminated completely. On April 8, 1956, a parade was held when the last streetcars stopped running along Woodward Avenue and in Detroit; the remaining cars were sent to <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>.
In the first decade of the 21st century, local business and government officials proposed two projects to add modern streetcars to M-1, an approximately line from the transit center at Michigan Avenue north to the state fairgrounds, or a line in the downtown area only. Suggestions to unify the two plans were made in late 2008, and the Detroit City Council approved the sale of $125 million in bonds on April 11, 2011, for the longer system. Through various approvals in 2011, and subsequent changes including a <a href="bus%20rapid%20transit">bus rapid transit</a> system with a dedicated Woodward Avenue bus lane. Private investors who supported the shorter three-mile line to New Center continued developing that project.

On July 28, 2014, construction started for a streetcar line to stretch from downtown Detroit to Grand Boulevard in New Center. The line was to have 20 different stations serving 12 stops, with most of the stations curbside on either side of Woodward Avenue going uptown or downtown. The line will have center road stations at the north and south ends of the system. Named <a href="QLine">QLine</a> in 2016, the system opened in May 2017. The last car of Detroit's previous streetcar system was numbered 286, so the planners numbered the cars for the new line 287–292 to pick up where the old number series had left off.

Juan Manuel de Rosas

Juan Manuel de Rosas (30 March 1793 – 14 March 1877), nicknamed "Restorer of the Laws", was a politician and army officer who ruled <a href="Buenos%20Aires%20Province">Buenos Aires Province</a> and briefly the <a href="Argentine%20Confederation">Argentine Confederation</a>. Although born into a wealthy family, Rosas independently amassed a personal fortune, acquiring large tracts of land in the process. Rosas enlisted his workers in a <a href="private%20army">private militia</a>, as was common for rural proprietors, and took part in the disputes that led to numerous civil wars in his country. Victorious in warfare, personally influential, and with vast landholdings and a loyal private army, Rosas became a <a href="caudillo">caudillo</a>, as provincial warlords in the region were known. He eventually reached the rank of brigadier general, the highest in the <a href="Argentine%20Army">Argentine Army</a>, and became the undisputed leader of the <a href="Federales%20%28Argentina%29">Federalist Party</a>.

In December 1829, Rosas became governor of the province of Buenos Aires and established a <a href="dictatorship">dictatorship</a> backed by <a href="state%20terrorism">state terrorism</a>. In 1831, he signed the <a href="Federal%20Pact">Federal Pact</a>, recognising provincial autonomy and creating the Argentine Confederation. When his term of office ended in 1832, Rosas departed to the frontier <a href="Desert%20Campaign%20%281833%E2%80%9334%29">to wage war on the indigenous peoples</a>. After his supporters launched a "coup" in Buenos Aires, Rosas was asked to return and once again took office as governor. Rosas reestablished his dictatorship and formed the repressive "Mazorca", an armed <a href="parapolice">parapolice</a> that killed thousands of citizens. Elections became a farce, and the legislature and judiciary became docile instruments of his will. Rosas created a <a href="cult%20of%20personality">cult of personality</a> and his regime became <a href="Totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> in nature, with all aspects of society rigidly controlled.

Rosas faced many threats to his power during the late 1830s and early 1840s. He <a href="War%20of%20the%20Confederation">fought a war</a> against the <a href="Peru%E2%80%93Bolivian%20Confederation">Peru–Bolivian Confederation</a>, endured a <a href="French%20blockade%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">blockade by France</a>, faced a <a href="Freemen%20of%20the%20South">revolt in his own province</a> and battled a <a href="Coalition%20of%20the%20North">major rebellion</a> that lasted for years and spread to several Argentine provinces. Rosas persevered and extended his influence in the provinces, exercising effective control over them through direct and indirect means. By 1848, he had extended his power beyond the borders of Buenos Aires and was ruler of all of Argentina. Rosas also attempted to annex the neighbouring nations of <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> and <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>. France and Great Britain jointly retaliated against Argentine expansionism, <a href="Anglo-French%20blockade%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">blockading Buenos Aires</a> for most of the late 1840s, but were unable to halt Rosas, whose prestige was greatly enhanced by his string of successes.

When the <a href="Empire%20of%20Brazil">Empire of Brazil</a> began aiding Uruguay in its struggle against Argentina, Rosas declared war in August 1851, starting the <a href="Platine%20War">Platine War</a>. This short conflict ended with Rosas being defeated and absconding to Britain. His last years were spent in exile living as a <a href="tenant%20farmer">tenant farmer</a> until his death in 1877. Rosas garnered an enduring public perception among Argentines as a brutal tyrant. Since the 1930s, an authoritarian, anti-Semitic, and racist political movement in Argentina called Revisionism has tried to improve Rosas's reputation and establish a new dictatorship in the model of his regime. In 1989, his remains were repatriated by the government in an attempt to promote national unity, seeking forgiveness for him and especially for the <a href="National%20Reorganization%20Process">1970s military dictatorship</a>. Rosas remains a controversial figure in Argentina in the 21st century.

Juan Manuel José Domingo Ortiz de Rosas was born on 30 March 1793 at his family's town house in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, the capital of the <a href="Viceroyalty%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata</a>. He was the first child of <a href="Le%C3%B3n%20Ortiz%20de%20Rosas">León Ortiz de Rosas</a> and <a href="Agustina%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Osornio">Agustina López de Osornio</a>. León Ortiz was the son of an immigrant from the Spanish <a href="Province%20of%20Burgos">Province of Burgos</a>. A military officer with an undistinguished career, León Ortiz had married into a wealthy "<a href="Criollo%20people">Criollo</a>" family. The young Juan Manuel de Rosas's character was heavily influenced by his mother Agustina, a strong-willed and domineering woman who derived these character traits from her father <a href="Clemente%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Osornio">Clemente López de Osornio</a>, a landowner who died defending his estate from an Indian attack in 1783.

As was common practice at the time, Rosas was schooled at home until the age of 8, and then enrolled in what was regarded the best private school in Buenos Aires. Though befitting the son of a wealthy landowner, his education was unremarkable. According to historian John Lynch, Rosas' education "was supplemented by his own efforts in the years that followed. Rosas was not entirely unread, though the time, the place, and his own bias limited the choice of authors. He appears to have had a sympathetic, if superficial, acquaintance with minor political thinkers of French <a href="Absolute%20monarchy">absolutism</a>."

In 1806, a <a href="British%20invasions%20of%20the%20River%20Plate">British expeditionary force invaded Buenos Aires</a>. A 13-year-old Rosas served distributing ammunition to troops in a force organised by Viceroy <a href="Santiago%20de%20Liniers%2C%201st%20Count%20of%20Buenos%20Aires">Santiago Liniers</a> to counter the invasion. The British were defeated in August 1806, but returned a year later. Rosas was then assigned to the "Caballería de los <a href="Miquelet%20%28militia%29">Migueletes</a>" (a militia cavalry), although he was probably barred from active duty during this time due to illness.

After the British invasions had been repelled, Rosas and his family moved from Buenos Aires to their "<a href="estancia">estancia</a>" (<a href="ranch">ranch</a>). His work there further shaped his character and outlook as part of the <a href="R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata%20Basin">Platine region</a>'s social establishment. In the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, owners of large landholdings (including the Rosas family) provided food, equipment and protection for families living in areas under their control. Their private defense forces consisted primarily of laborers who were drafted as soldiers. Most of these <a href="peon">peon</a>s, as such workers were called, were <a href="gaucho">gaucho</a>s.

The landed aristocracy of Spanish descent considered the illiterate, mixed-race gauchos, who comprised the majority of the population, to be ungovernable and untrustworthy. The gauchos were tolerated because there was no other <a href="labor%20force">labor force</a> available, but were treated with contempt by the landowners. Rosas got along well with the gauchos in his service, despite his harsh and authoritarian comportment. He was known to dress like them, joke with them, take part in their horse-play, and pay them well, but he never allowed them to forget that he was their master rather than their equal. Shaped by the colonial society in which he lived, Rosas was conservative, an advocate of hierarchy and authority, like the other great landowners in the region.

Rosas acquired a working knowledge of administering ranchlands and, beginning in 1811, took charge of his family's "estancias". In 1813, he married <a href="Encarnaci%C3%B3n%20Ezcurra">Encarnación Ezcurra</a>, daughter of a wealthy family from Buenos Aires. He soon afterwards sought to establish a career for himself, leaving his parent's estate. He produced salted meat and acquired landholdings in the process. As the years passed he became an "estanciero" (rancher) in his own right, accumulating land while establishing a successful partnership with second cousins from the politically powerful Anchorena clan. His hard work and organisational skills in deploying labour were key to his success, rather than creating new or applying nontraditional approaches to production.

The <a href="May%20Revolution">May Revolution</a> of 1810 marked the early stage of a process which later led to the disintegration of Spain's Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, independence and the eventual formation of <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. Rosas, like many landowners in the countryside, was suspicious of a movement advanced primarily by merchants and bureaucrats in the city of Buenos Aires. Rosas was specially outraged by the execution of Viceroy Santiago Liniers at the hands of the revolutionaries. Rosas felt nostalgic about colonial times, seeing them as stable, orderly and prosperous.

When the <a href="Congress%20of%20Tucum%C3%A1n">Congress of Tucumán</a> severed all remaining ties with Spain in July 1816, Rosas and his peers accepted independence as an accomplished fact. Independence resulted in a breakup of the territories that had formed the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. The province of Buenos Aires <a href="Argentine%20Civil%20Wars">fought a civil war</a> with the other provinces over the degree of autonomy which the provincial governments were to have. The <a href="Unitarian%20Party">Unitarian Party</a> supported the preeminence of Buenos Aires, while the <a href="Federales%20%28Argentina%29">Federalist Party</a> defended provincial autonomy. A decade of strife over the issue destroyed the ties between capital and provinces, with new republics being declared throughout the country. Efforts by the Buenos Aires government to quash these independent states were met with determined local resistance. In 1820 Rosas and his gauchos, all dressed in red and nicknamed ""Colorados del Monte"" ("Reds of the Mount"), enlisted in the army of Buenos Aires as the Fifth Regiment of Militia. They repulsed invading provincial armies, saving Buenos Aires.

At the end of the conflict, Rosas returned to his "estancias" having acquired prestige for his military service. He was promoted to cavalry colonel and was awarded further landholdings by the government. These additions, together with his successful business and fresh property acquisitions, greatly boosted his wealth. By 1830, he was the 10th largest landowner in the <a href="Buenos%20Aires%20Province">province of Buenos Aires</a> (in which the city of the same name was located), owning 300,000 cattle and of land. With his newly gained influence, military background, vast landholdings and a private army of gauchos loyal only to him, Rosas became the quintessential <a href="caudillo">caudillo</a>, as provincial warlords in the region were known.

National unity crumbled under the weight of a continuous round of civil wars, rebellions and coups. The Unitarian–Federalist struggle brought perennial instability while caudillos fought for power and laid waste to the countryside. By 1826, Rosas had built a power base, consisting of relatives, friends and clients, and joined the Federalist Party. He remained a strong advocate of his native province of Buenos Aires, with little concern for political ideology. In 1820, Rosas fought alongside the Unitarians because he saw the Federalist invasion as a menace to Buenos Aires. When the Unitarians sought to appease the Federalists by proposing to grant the other provinces a share in the customs revenues flowing through Buenos Aires, Rosas saw this as a threat to his province's interests. In 1827, four provinces led by Federalist caudillos rebelled against the Unitarian government. Rosas was the driving force behind the Federalist takeover of Buenos Aires and the election of <a href="Manuel%20Dorrego">Manuel Dorrego</a> as provincial governor that year. Rosas was awarded with the post of general commander of the rural militias of the province of Buenos Aires on 14 July, which increased his influence and power.

In December 1828 <a href="Juan%20Lavalle">Juan Lavalle</a>, the Unitarian governor of Buenos Aires had Dorrego seized and executed without trial. With Dorrego gone, Rosas filled the vacant Federalist leadership and rebelled against the Unitarians. He allied with <a href="Estanislao%20L%C3%B3pez">Estanislao López</a>, caudillo and ruler of <a href="Santa%20Fe%20Province">Santa Fe Province</a>, and they defeated Lavalle at the <a href="Battle%20of%20M%C3%A1rquez%20Bridge">Battle of Márquez Bridge</a> in April 1829. When Rosas entered the city of Buenos Aires in November of that year, he was hailed both as a victorious military leader and as the head of the Federalists. Rosas was considered a handsome man, standing tall with blond hair and "piercing blue eyes". <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>, who met Rosas <a href="Second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle%23Gauchos%2C%20rheas%2C%20fossils%20and%20geology">during the "Beagle" survey expedition</a>, assessed him as "a man of extraordinary character". British diplomat <a href="Henry%20Southern%20%28journalist%29">Henry Southern</a> said that in "appearance Rosas resembles an English gentleman farmer—his manners are courteous without being refined. He is affable and agreeable in conversation, which however nearly always turns on himself, but his tone is pleasant and agreeable enough. His memory is stupendous: and his accuracy in all points of detail never failing."

On 6 December 1829, the House of Representatives of Buenos Aires elected Rosas governor and granted him "facultades extraordinarias" (extraordinary powers). This marked the beginning of his regime, described by historians as a dictatorship. He saw himself as a <a href="Benevolent%20dictatorship">benevolent dictator</a>, saying: "For me the ideal of good government would be paternal autocracy, intelligent, disinterested and indefatigable ... I have always admired the autocratic dictators who have been the first servants of their people. That is my great title: I have always sought to serve the country." He used his power to censor his critics and banish his enemies. He later justified these measures, stating: "When I took over the government I found the government in anarchy, divided into warring factions, reduced to pure chaos, a hell in miniature ..."

Rosas' early administration was preoccupied with the severe deficits, large public debts and the impact of currency devaluation which his government inherited. A great drought that began in December 1828, which would last until April 1832, greatly impacted the economy. The Unitarians were still at large, controlling several provinces that had banded together in the <a href="Unitarian%20League">Unitarian League</a>. The capture of <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Paz">José María Paz</a>, the main Unitarian leader, in March 1831 resulted in the end of the Unitarian–Federalist civil war and the collapse of the Unitarian League. Rosas was content, for the moment, to agree to recognize provincial autonomy in the <a href="Federal%20Pact">Federal Pact</a>. In an effort to alleviate the government's financial problems, he improved revenue collection while not raising taxes and curtailed expenditure.

By the end of his first term, Rosas was generally credited with having staved off political and financial instability, but he faced increased opposition in the House of Representatives. All members of the House were Federalists, as Rosas had restored the legislature that had been in place under Dorrego, and which had subsequently been dissolved by Lavalle. A liberal Federalist faction, which accepted dictatorship as a temporary necessity, called for the adoption of a constitution. Rosas was unwilling to govern constrained by a constitutional framework and only grudgingly relinquished his dictatorial powers. His term of office ended soon after, on 5 December 1832.

While the government in Buenos Aires was distracted with political infighting, ranchers began moving into territories in the south inhabited by indigenous peoples. The resulting conflict with native peoples necessitated a government response. Rosas steadfastly endorsed policies which supported this expansion. During his governorship he granted lands in the south to war veterans and to ranchers seeking alternative pasture lands during the drought. Although the south was regarded as a virtual desert at the time, it had great potential and resources for agricultural development, particularly for ranching operations. The government gave Rosas command of an army with orders to subdue the Indian tribes in the coveted territory. Rosas was generous to those Indians who surrendered, rewarding them with animals and goods. Although he personally disliked killing Indians, he relentlessly hunted down those who refused to yield. The <a href="Desert%20Campaign%20%281833%E2%80%9334%29">Desert Campaign</a> lasted from 1833 to 1834, with Rosas subjugating the entire region. His conquest of the south opened up many possibilities for further territorial expansion, which led him to state: "The <a href="Patagonia">fine territories</a>, which extend from the <a href="Andes">Andes</a> to the coast and down to the <a href="Strait%20of%20Magellan">Magellan Straits</a> are now wide open for our children."

While Rosas was away on the Desert Campaign in October 1833, a group of "Rosistas" (Rosas's supporters) laid siege to Buenos Aires. Inside the city, Rosas's wife, Encarnación, assembled a contingent of associates to aid the besiegers. The <a href="Revolution%20of%20the%20Restorers">Revolution of the Restorers</a>, as the "Rosista" coup came to be known, forced the provincial governor <a href="Juan%20Ram%C3%B3n%20Balcarce">Juan Ramón Balcarce</a> to resign. In quick succession, Balcarce was followed by two others who presided over weak and ineffective governments. The "Rosismo" (Rosism) had become a powerful faction within the Federalist Party, and pressured other factions to accept a return of Rosas, endowed with dictatorial powers, as the only way to restore stability. The House of Representatives yielded, and on 7 March 1835, Rosas was reelected governor and invested with the "suma del poder público" (<a href="sum%20of%20public%20power">sum of public power</a>).

A plebiscite was held to determine whether the citizens of Buenos Aires supported Rosas's reelection and resumption of dictatorial powers. During his governorship from 1829 to 1832, Rosas had reduced the election process to a farce. He had installed loyal associates as justices of the peace, powerful officeholders with administrative and judicial functions who were also charged with tax collection, leading militia and presiding over elections. Through the exclusion of voters and intimidation of the opposition, the justices of the peace delivered any result Rosas favored. Half of the members of the House of Representatives faced reelection each year, and the opposition to Rosas had quickly been eliminated through rigged elections, allowing him to control the legislature. Control over finances had been stripped from the legislature, and its approval of legislation turned into a <a href="Rubber%20stamp%20%28politics%29">rubber stamp</a> to preserve a semblance of democracy. The result of the 1835 election was a predictable 99.9 percent "yes" vote.

Rosas believed that the manipulation of elections were necessary for political stability, because most of the country's population was illiterate. He acquired absolute power over the province with the assent and support of most "estancieros" and businessmen, who shared his views. The "estancia" formed the power base on which Rosas relied. Lynch said that there "was a great deal of group cohesion and solidarity among the landed class. Rosas himself was the center of a vast kinship group based on land. He was surrounded by a closely knit economic and political network linking deputies, law officers, officials, and military who were also landowners and related among themselves or with Rosas."

Rosas's authority and influence spread far beyond the House of Representatives. He exercised tight control over the bureaucracy as well as his cabinet, stating: "Do not imagine that my Ministers are anything but my Secretaries. I put them in their offices to listen and report, and nothing more." His supporters were rewarded with positions within the state apparatus, and anyone he deemed a threat was purged. Opposition newspapers <a href="Book%20burning">were burned in public squares</a>. Rosas created an elaborate <a href="cult%20of%20personality">cult of personality</a>, presenting himself as an almighty and fatherlike figure who protected the people. His portraits were carried in street demonstrations and placed on church altars to be venerated. "Rosismo" was no longer a mere faction within the Federalist ranks; it had become a political movement. As early as 1829, Rosas had confided to an Uruguayan diplomatic envoy: "I tell you I am not a Federalist, and I have never belonged to that party." During his governorship, he still claimed to have favoured Federalism against Unitarianism, although in practice Federalism had by that time been subsumed into the "Rosismo" movement.

Rosas established a <a href="Totalitarianism">totalitarian regime</a>, in which the government sought to dictate every aspect of public and private life. It was mandated that the slogan "Death to the Savage Unitarians" be inscribed at the head of all official documents. Anyone on the state payroll—from military officers, priests, to civil servants and teachers—was obliged to wear a red badge with the inscription "Federation or Death". Every male was required to have a "federal look", i.e., to sport a large moustache and sideburns, leading many to wear false moustaches. The red colour—symbol of both the Federalist Party and of "Rosismo"—became omnipresent in the province of Buenos Aires. Soldiers wore red "chiripás" (blankets worn as trousers), caps and jackets, and their horses sported red <a href="Horse%20tack">accoutrements</a>. Civilians were also required to wear the colour. A red waistcoat, red badge and red hat band were required for men, while women wore ribbons in that colour and children donned school uniforms based upon "Rosismo" paradigms. Building exteriors and interiors were also decorated in red.

Most Catholic clergy in Buenos Aires willingly backed Rosas' regime. The <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuits</a>, the only ones who refused to do so, were expelled from the country. The lower social strata in Buenos Aires, which formed the vast majority of its populace, experienced no improvement in the conditions under which they lived. When Rosas slashed expenditures, he cut resources from education, social services, general welfare and public works. None of the lands confiscated from Indians and Unitarians were turned over to rural workers, including gauchos. <a href="Afro-Argentine">Black people</a> did not experience any improvement in their conditions either. Rosas was himself a slave-owner, and helped revive the <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">slave trade</a>. Despite doing little to promote their interests, he remained popular among blacks and gauchos. He employed blacks, patronized their festivities and attended their "<a href="Candombl%C3%A9">candombles</a>". The gauchos admired his leadership and willingness to fraternize with them to some extent.

In addition to purges, banishments and censorship, Rosas took measures against the opposition and anyone else he deemed a threat that historians have considered <a href="state%20terrorism">state terrorism</a>. Terror was a tool used to intimidate dissident voices, to shore up support among his own partisans and to exterminate his foes. His targets were denounced, sometimes inaccurately, as having ties to Unitarians. Those victimised included members of his government and party who were suspected of being insufficiently loyal. If actual opponents were not at hand, the regime found other targets that were punished to make an example. A climate of fear was used to create unquestioning conformity to Rosas' dictates.

State terrorism was carried out by the "Mazorca", an armed <a href="parapolice">parapolice</a> unit of the "<a href="Sociedad%20Popular%20Restauradora">Sociedad Popular Restauradora</a>" political organization. The "Sociedad Popular Restauradora" and the "Mazorca" were creations of Rosas, who retained tight control over both. The tactics of the "mazorqueros" included neighborhood sweeps in which houses would be searched and occupants intimidated. Others who fell into their power were arrested, tortured and killed. Killings were generally by shooting, lance-thrusting or throat-slitting. Many were castrated, or had their beards <a href="scalping">scalped</a> or their tongues cut out. Modern estimates report around 2,000 people were killed from 1829 until 1852.

Although a judicial system still existed in Buenos Aires, Rosas removed any independence the courts might have exercised, either by controlling appointments to the judiciary, or by circumventing their authority entirely. He would sit in judgement over cases, issuing sentences which included fines, service in the army, imprisonment, or execution. The exercise of state terror as a tool of intimidation was restricted to Rosas himself; his subordinates had no control over it. It was used against specific targets, rather than randomly. Terrorism was orchestrated rather than a product of popular zeal, was targeted for effect rather than indiscriminate. Anarchic demonstrations, vigilantism and disorderliness were antithetical to a regime touting a law and order agenda. Foreigners were exempted from abuses, as were people too poor or inconsequential to serve as effective examples. Victims were selected for their usefulness as tools of intimidation.

Throughout the late 1830s and early 1840s, Rosas faced a series of major threats to his power. The Unitarians found an ally in <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20de%20Santa%20Cruz">Andrés de Santa Cruz</a>, the ruler of the <a href="Peru%E2%80%93Bolivian%20Confederation">Peru–Bolivian Confederation</a>. Rosas declared war against the Peru–Bolivian Confederation on 19 March 1837, joining the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Confederation">War of the Confederation</a> between Chile and Peru–Bolivia. The "Rosista" army played a minor role in the conflict, which resulted in the overthrow of Santa Cruz and the dissolution of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation. On 28 March 1838, France declared a blockade of the <a href="Port%20of%20Buenos%20Aires">Port of Buenos Aires</a>, eager to extend its influence over the region. Unable to confront the French, Rosas increased internal repression to forestall potential uprisings against his regime.

The blockade caused severe damage to the economy across all the provinces, as they exported their goods through the port of Buenos Aires. Despite the 1831 <a href="Federal%20Pact">Federal Pact</a>, all provinces had long been discontent with the "de facto" primacy that Buenos Aires province held over them. On 28 February 1839, the <a href="Corrientes%20Province">province of Corrientes</a> revolted and attacked both Buenos Aires and <a href="Entre%20R%C3%ADos%20Province">Entre Ríos</a> provinces. Rosas counterattacked and defeated the rebels, killing their leader, the governor of Corrientes. In June, Rosas uncovered a plot by dissident "Rosistas" to oust him from power in what became known as the <a href="Maza%20conspiracy">Maza conspiracy</a>. Rosas imprisoned some of the plotters and executed others. <a href="Manuel%20Vicente%20Maza">Manuel Vicente Maza</a>, president of both the House of Representatives and the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Argentina">Supreme Court</a>, was murdered by Rosas's "Mazorca" agents within the halls of the parliament on the pretext that his son was involved in the conspiracy. In the countryside, "estancieros", including a younger brother of Rosas, revolted, beginning the <a href="Freemen%20of%20the%20South">Rebellion of the South</a>. The rebels attempted to ally with France, but were easily crushed, many losing their lives and properties in the process.

In September 1839, <a href="Juan%20Lavalle">Juan Lavalle</a> returned after ten years in exile. He allied with the governor of Corrientes, which revolted once again, and invaded Buenos Aires province at the head of Unitarian troops armed and supplied by the French. Emboldened by Lavalle's actions, the provinces of <a href="Tucum%C3%A1n%20Province">Tucumán</a>, <a href="Salta%20Province">Salta</a>, <a href="La%20Rioja%20Province%2C%20Argentina">La Rioja</a>, <a href="Catamarca%20Province">Catamarca</a> and <a href="Jujuy%20Province">Jujuy</a> formed the <a href="Coalition%20of%20the%20North">Coalition of the North</a> and also rebelled against Buenos Aires. Great Britain intervened on behalf of Rosas, and France lifted the blockade on 29 October 1840. The struggle with his internal enemies was hard-fought. By December 1842, Lavalle had been killed and the rebellious provinces subdued, except for Corrientes, which was only defeated in 1847. Terrorism was also employed on the battlefield, as the "Rosistas" refused to take prisoners. The defeated men had their throats cut and their heads put on display.

Around 1845, Rosas managed to establish absolute dominance over the region. He exercised complete control over all aspects of society with the solid backing of the army. Rosas was raised from colonel to brigadier general (the highest army rank) on 18 December 1829. On 12 November 1840 he declined the newly created and higher rank of grand marshal ("gran mariscal"), which had been bestowed on him by the House of Representatives. The army was led by officers who had backgrounds and values similar to his. Confident of his power, Rosas made some concessions by returning confiscated properties to their owners, disbanding the "Mazorca" and ending torture and political assassinations. The inhabitants of Buenos Aires still dressed and behaved according to the set of rules Rosas had imposed, but the climate of constant and widespread fear greatly diminished.

When Rosas was elected governor for the first time in 1829, he held no power outside the province of Buenos Aires. There was no national government or national parliament. The former Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata had been succeeded by the <a href="United%20Provinces%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">United Provinces of the Río de la Plata</a>, which by 1831, following the Federal Pact and officially from 22 May 1835, had increasingly been known as the <a href="Argentine%20Confederation">Argentine Confederation</a>, or simply, Argentina. Rosas's victory over the other Argentine provinces in the early 1840s turned them into satellites of Buenos Aires. He gradually put in place provincial governors who were either allied or too weak to have real independence, which allowed him to exercise dominance over all the provinces. By 1848, Rosas began calling his government the "government of the confederacy" and the "general government", which would have been inconceivable a few years before. The next year, with acquiescence of the provinces, he named himself "Supreme Head of the Confederacy" and became the indisputable ruler of Argentina.

As Rosas aged and his health declined, the question of who would succeed him became a growing concern among his supporters. His wife Encarnación had died in October 1838 after a long illness. Although devastated by his loss, Rosas exploited her death to raise support for his regime. Not long after, at the age of 47, he began an affair with his fifteen-year-old maid, María Eugenia Castro, with whom he had five illegitimate children. From his marriage to Encarnación, Rosas had two children: Juan Bautista Pedro and <a href="Manuela%20Rosas">Manuela Robustiana</a>. Rosas established a <a href="Family%20dictatorship">hereditary dictatorship</a>, naming the children from his marriage as his successors, stating that "[t]hey are both worthy children of my beloved Encarnación, and if, God willing, I die, then you will find that they are capable of succeeding me." It is unknown whether Rosas was a closet <a href="Monarchism">monarchist</a>. Later during his exile, Rosas would declare that <a href="Princess%20Alice%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Princess Alice of the United Kingdom</a> would be the ideal ruler for his country. Nonetheless, in public he stated that his regime was republican in nature.

The breakup of the old Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata during the 1810s eventually resulted in the emergence of independent nations of <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> in the northern portion of the Viceroyalty, while its southern territories coalesced into the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. Rosas planned to restore, if not all, at least a considerable part of the former borders of the old Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. He never recognized the independence of Paraguay and regarded it a rebel Argentine province that would inevitably be reconquered. He sent an army under <a href="Manuel%20Oribe">Manuel Oribe</a> who invaded Uruguay and conquered most of the country, except for its capital <a href="Montevideo">Montevideo</a> that <a href="Great%20Siege%20of%20Montevideo">endured a long siege</a> starting in 1843. When pressed by the British, Rosas declined to guarantee Uruguayan independence. In <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, all potential foreign threats to Rosas's plans of conquest collapsed, including <a href="Gran%20Colombia">Gran Colombia</a> and the <a href="Peru%E2%80%93Bolivian%20Confederation">Peru–Bolivian Confederation</a>, or were troubled by internal turmoil, as was the <a href="Empire%20of%20Brazil">Empire of Brazil</a>. To reinforce his claims over Uruguay and Paraguay, and maintain his dominance over the Argentine provinces, Rosas blockaded the port of Montevideo and closed the interior rivers to foreign trade.

The loss of trade was unacceptable to Britain and France. On 17 September 1845 both nations established the <a href="Anglo-French%20blockade%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata</a> and enforced the free navigation in the <a href="R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata%20Basin">Río de la Plata Basin</a> (or Platine region). Argentina resisted the pressure and fought back to a standstill. This <a href="undeclared%20war">undeclared war</a> caused more economic harm to France and Britain than to Argentina. The British faced increasing pressure at home once they realised that the access gained to the other ports within the Platine region did not compensate for the loss of trade with Buenos Aires. Britain ended all hostilities and lifted the blockade on 15 July 1847, followed by France on 12 June 1848. Rosas had successfully resisted the two most powerful nations on Earth; his standing, and Argentina's, increased among <a href="Hispanic%20America">Hispanic America</a>n nations. The Venezuelan <a href="Humanism">humanist</a> <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20Bello">Andrés Bello</a>, summarizing the prevailing opinion, considered Rosas among "the leading ranks of the great men of America".

Although his prestige was on the rise, Rosas made no serious attempts to further liberalise his regime. Every year he presented his resignation and the pliant House of Representatives predictably declined, claiming that maintaining him in office was vital for the nation's welfare. Rosas also allowed exiled Argentines to return to their homeland, but only because he was so confident of his control and that no one was willing to risk defying him. The execution in August 1848 of the pregnant young <a href="Camila%20O%27Gorman">Camila O'Gorman</a>, charged with a forbidden romance with a priest, caused a backlash throughout the continent. Nonetheless, it served as a clear warning that Rosas had no intention of loosening his grip.

Rosas failed to realize that discontent was steadily growing throughout the country. Throughout the 1840s he became increasingly secluded in his country house in <a href="Palermo%2C%20Buenos%20Aires">Palermo</a>, some miles away from Buenos Aires. There he ruled and lived under heavy protection provided by guards and patrols. He declined to meet with his ministers and relied solely on secretaries. His daughter <a href="Manuela%20Rosas">Manuela</a> replaced his wife at his right hand and became the link between Rosas and the outside world. The reason for Rosas's increasing isolation was given by a member of his secretariat: "The dictator is not stupid: he knows the people hate him; he goes in constant fear and always has one eye on the chance to rob and abuse them and the other on making a getaway. He has a horse ready saddled at the door of his office day and night".

Meanwhile, Brazil, now ascendant under Emperor <a href="Dom%20%28title%29">Dom</a> <a href="Pedro%20II%20of%20Brazil">Pedro II</a>, provided support to the Uruguayan government that still held out in Montevideo, as well as to the ambitious <a href="Justo%20Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Urquiza">Justo José de Urquiza</a>, a caudillo in Entre Ríos who rebelled against Rosas. Once one of Rosas' most trusted lieutenants, Urquiza now claimed to fight for a constitutional government, although his ambition to become head of state was barely disguised. In retaliation, Rosas declared war on Brazil on 18 August 1851, beginning the <a href="Platine%20War">Platine War</a>. The army under Oribe in Uruguay surrendered to Urquiza in October. With arms and financial aid given by Brazil, Urquiza then marched through Argentine territory heading to Buenos Aires.

Uncharacteristically, Rosas remained passive throughout the conflict. The Argentine ruler lost heart once he realized that he had fallen into a trap. Even if he defeated Urquiza, his forces would probably be weakened enough to prevent him from challenging the Brazilian army that was ready to invade Argentina. With no other alternative, Rosas remarked: "There is no other way; we have to play for the high stakes and go for everything. Here we are, and from here there is no retreat." After an <a href="Battle%20of%20Caseros">unsuccessful battle</a> against Urquiza on 3 February 1852, Rosas fled to Buenos Aires. Once there, he disguised himself and boarded a ship that took him to Britain to live in exile. Embittered, he remarked: "It is not the people who have overthrown me. It is the monkeys, the Brazilians."

Rosas arrived in <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>, Great Britain, on 26 April 1852. The British gave him asylum, paid for his travel and welcomed him with a <a href="21-gun%20salute">21-gun salute</a>. These honours were granted because, according to the British Foreign Secretary <a href="James%20Harris%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Malmesbury">James Harris, 3rd Earl of Malmesbury</a>, "General Rosas was no common refugee, but one who had shown great distinction and kindness to the British merchants who had traded with his country". Months before his fall, Rosas had arranged with the British <a href="charg%C3%A9%20d%27affaires">chargé d'affaires</a> Captain <a href="Robert%20Gore%20%28officer%29">Robert Gore</a> for protection and asylum in the event of his defeat. Both his children by Encarnación followed him into exile, although Juan Bautista soon returned with his family to Argentina. His daughter Manuela married the son of an old associate of Rosas, an act which the former dictator never forgave. A domineering father, Rosas wanted his daughter to remain devoted to him alone. Although he forbade her from writing or visiting, Manuela remained loyal to him and maintained contact.

The new Argentine government confiscated all of Rosas' properties and tried him as a criminal, later sentencing him to death. Rosas was appalled that most of his friends, supporters and allies abandoned him and became either silent or openly critical of him. "Rosismo" vanished overnight. "The landed class, supporters and beneficiaries of Rosas, now had to make their peace—and their profits—with his successors. Survival, not allegiance, was their politics", argued Lynch. Urquiza, a one-time ally and later an enemy, reconciled with Rosas and sent him financial assistance, hoping for political support in return—although Rosas had scant political capital left. Rosas followed Argentina's developments while in exile, always hoping for an opportunity to return, but he never again insinuated himself into Argentine affairs.

In exile Rosas was not destitute, but he lived modestly amid financial constraints during the remainder of his life. A very few loyal friends sent him money, but it was never enough. He sold one of his "estancias" before the confiscation and became a <a href="tenant%20farmer">tenant farmer</a> in <a href="Swaythling">Swaythling</a>, near <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a>. He employed a housekeeper and two to four laborers, to whom he paid above-average wages. Despite constant concern over his shortage of funds, Rosas found joy in farm life, once remarking: "I now consider myself happy on this farm, living in modest circumstances as you see, earning a living the hard way by the sweat of my brow". A contemporary described him in final years: "He was then eighty, a man still handsome and imposing; his manners were most refined, and the modest environment did nothing to lessen his air of a great lord, inherited from his family." After a walk on a cold day, Rosas caught pneumonia and died at 07:00 on the morning of 14 March 1877. Following a private mass attended by his family and a few friends, he was buried in the <a href="Southampton%20Old%20Cemetery">town cemetery</a> of Southampton.

Serious attempts to reassess Rosas's reputation began in the 1880s with the publication of scholarly works by <a href="Adolfo%20Sald%C3%ADas">Adolfo Saldías</a> and <a href="Ernesto%20Quesada">Ernesto Quesada</a>. Later, a more blatant "Revisionist" movement would flourish under "<a href="Nacionalismo%20%28Argentine%20political%20movement%29">Nacionalismo</a>" (Nationalism). "Nacionalismo" was a political movement that appeared in Argentina in the 1920s and reached its apex in the 1930s. It was the Argentine equivalent of the authoritarian ideologies that arose during the same period, such as <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a>, <a href="Fascism">Fascism</a> and <a href="Integralism">Integralism</a>. Argentine Nationalism was an authoritarian, <a href="Antisemitism">anti-Semitic</a>, racist and <a href="Misogyny">misogynistic</a> political movement with support for racially based pseudo-scientific theories such as <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a>. "Revisionismo" (Revisionism) was the historiographical wing of Argentine "Nacionalismo". The main goal of Argentine "Nacionalismo" was to establish a national dictatorship. For the "Nacionalismo" movement, Rosas and his regime were idealized and portrayed as paragons of governmental virtue. "Revisionismo" served as a useful tool, as the main purpose of the revisionists within the "Nacionalismo" agenda was to rehabilitate Rosas's image.

Despite a decades-long struggle, "Revisionismo" failed to be taken seriously. According to Michael Goebel, the revisionists had a "lack of interest in scholarly standards" and were known for "their institutional marginality in the intellectual field". They also never succeeded in changing mainstream views regarding Rosas. William Spence Robertson said in 1930: "Among the enigmatical personages of the 'Age of Dictators' in South America none played a more spectacular role than the Argentine dictator, Juan Manuel de Rosas, whose gigantic and ominous figure bestrode the Plata River for more than twenty years. So despotic was his power that Argentine writers have themselves styled this age of their history as 'The Tyranny of Rosas'." In 1961, William Dusenberry said: "Rosas is a negative memory in Argentina. He left behind him the black legend of Argentine history—a legend which Argentines in general wish to forget. There is no monument to him in the entire nation; no park, plaza, or street bears his name."

In the 1980s, Argentina was a fractured, deeply divided nation, having faced <a href="Dirty%20War">military dictatorships</a>, severe <a href="Hyperinflation%23Argentina">economic crises</a> and a defeat in the <a href="Falklands%20War">Falklands War</a>. President <a href="Carlos%20Menem">Carlos Menem</a> decided to repatriate Rosas's remains and take advantage of the occasion to unite the Argentines. Menem believed that if the Argentines could forgive Rosas and his regime, they might do the same regarding the more recent and vividly remembered past. On 30 September 1989, an elaborate and enormous cortege organized by the government was held, after which the remains of the Argentine ruler were interred in his family vault at <a href="La%20Recoleta%20Cemetery">La Recoleta Cemetery</a>, Buenos Aires. Closely allied with neorevisionists, Menem (and his fellow <a href="Justicialist%20Party">Peronist</a> presidential successors <a href="N%C3%A9stor%20Kirchner">Néstor Kirchner</a> and <a href="Cristina%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20de%20Kirchner">Cristina Fernández de Kirchner</a>) have honoured Rosas on <a href="Argentine%20peso%23Banknotes">banknotes</a>, postage stamps and monuments, causing mixed reactions among the public. Rosas remains a controversial figure among Argentines, who "have long been fascinated and outraged" by him, as historian John Lynch noted.

Giovanni Villani

Giovanni Villani (; 1276 or 1280 – 1348) was an Italian <a href="bank">bank</a>er, official, <a href="diplomat">diplomat</a> and <a href="chronicle">chronicle</a>r from <a href="Florence">Florence</a> who wrote the "<a href="Nuova%20Cronica">Nuova Cronica</a>" ("New Chronicles") on the <a href="history%20of%20Florence">history of Florence</a>. He was a leading statesman of Florence but later gained an unsavory reputation and served time in prison as a result of the bankruptcy of a trading and banking company he worked for. His interest in and elaboration of economic details, statistical information, and political and psychological insight mark him as a more modern chronicler of late medieval Europe. His "Cronica" is viewed as the first introduction of statistics as a positive element in history.
However, historian <a href="Kenneth%20R.%20Bartlett">Kenneth R. Bartlett</a> notes that, in contrast to his <a href="Italian%20Renaissance">Renaissance-era successors</a>, "his reliance on such elements as <a href="divine%20providence">divine providence</a> links Villani closely with the medieval vernacular chronicle tradition." In recurring themes made implicit through significant events described in his "Cronica", Villani also emphasized three assumptions about the relationship of sin and morality to historical events, these being that excess brings disaster, that forces of right and wrong are in constant struggle, and that events are directly influenced by the will of <a href="God">God</a>.

Villani was inspired to write his "Cronica" after attending the <a href="Jubilee%20%28Christian%29">jubilee</a> celebration in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> in 1300 and noting the venerable history of that city. He outlined the events in his "Cronica" year for year, following a strictly linear narrative format. He provided intricate details on many important historical events of the city of Florence and the wider region of <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a>, such as construction projects, floods, fires, famines, and plagues.

While continuing work on the "Cronica" and detailing the enormous loss of life during the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a> in 1348, Villani died of the same illness. His work on the "Cronica" was continued by his brother and nephew. Villani's work has received both praise and criticism from modern historians. The criticism is mostly aimed at his emphasis on <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a> guidance of events, his organizational style, and his glorification of the <a href="papacy">papacy</a> and Florence.

Giovanni Villani was born into the Florentine merchant middle class. He was the son of Villano di Stoldi di Bellincione, who came from an old and well-respected "arti maggiori" family of merchants. Villani was a member of the "<a href="Arte%20di%20Calimala">Arte di Calimala</a>" (wool finishers) <a href="guild">guild</a> in Florence since 1300, serving on the "mercanzia" council of eight. During that year he visited <a href="Rome">Rome</a> during the jubilee celebration. After observing the well-known <a href="Architecture%20of%20ancient%20Rome">ancient monuments</a> of Rome and acknowledging its renowned historical personages, he was inspired to write the "Cronica", a <a href="universal%20history">universal history</a> of Florence in a strictly linear, year-by-year format. During the early years of the 14th century, he gained political perspective by travelling throughout Italy, Switzerland, France and <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> for the <a href="Peruzzi">Peruzzi</a> bank, of which he was a shareholder from 1300 to 1308. Traveling abroad as a <a href="Factor%20%28agent%29">factor</a> for the company, Villani was paid a regular salary in addition to his shareholding profits. On May 15, 1306, one of the first exchange contracts ("cambium") to mention the city of <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> involved two parties: Giovanni Villani, representing the Peruzzi Company, granting a loan to Tommaso Fini, representing the Gallerani Company of <a href="Siena">Siena</a>. Villani and his brother <a href="Matteo%20Villani">Matteo</a> transferred most of their economic activities to the Buonaccorsi firm by 1322. Giovanni Villani was a co-director of Buonaccorsi in 1324. The Buonaccorsi handled banking and commodity trade activities, spreading their influence throughout Italy, France, Flanders, England and several places in the Mediterranean.

Villani returned to Florence in 1307 where he married and settled down for a life of city politics. He became one of the <a href="prior">prior</a>s of Florence in 1316 and 1317. At the same time, he participated in the crafty diplomatic tactics that resulted in peace with <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a> and <a href="Lucca">Lucca</a>. As head of the <a href="Mint%20%28coin%29">mint</a> beginning in 1316, he collected its earlier records and created a register of all the coins struck in Florence. In 1321, he was again chosen prior, and in 1324 was deputed to inspect the rebuilding of the <a href="city%20wall">city wall</a>s. He went with the Florentine army to fight against <a href="Castruccio%20Castracani">Castruccio Castracani</a>, lord of Lucca, and was present at <a href="Altopascio">Altopascio</a> during <a href="Battle%20of%20Altopascio">Florence's defeat</a>. In his "Cronica", he gave a detailed account of why Florence was unable to acquire Lucca after the death of Castruccio Castracani.

A <a href="famine">famine</a> spread across Tuscany in 1328. From 1329 to 1330 Villani was a <a href="Medieval%20commune">commune</a>-appointed magistrate of provisioning protecting Florence from the famine's worst effects. In order to mitigate rising levels of starvation and assuage peasant discontent, grain was speedily imported from <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> through <a href="Talamone">Talamone</a>, were taken from the city purse by the Florentine commune to aid the relief effort, and all the city's bakers had their ovens requisitioned by the government so that loaves of bread could be sold at affordable prices to the riotous and starving poor.
Villani was sent on another diplomatic mission in 1329, this time to <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a> to meet Cardinal <a href="Bertrand%20de%20Pouget">Bertrand de Pouget</a>. From 1330 to 1331 he superintended the making of <a href="Andrea%20Pisano">Andrea Pisano</a>'s bronze doors for the <a href="Florence%20Baptistry">Baptistry</a>. At the same time, he served as the consul for his guild of the "Arte di Calimala" and watched over the raising of the "<a href="campanile">campanile</a>" of the <a href="Badia%20Fiorentina">Badìa</a>. He was also sent with others as a hostage to <a href="Ferrara">Ferrara</a>, to ensure that Florence made good on a debt; he resided there for some months in 1341.

Villani often expressed an optimistic viewpoint in his writing; this changed with the short-lived regime of <a href="Walter%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVI%20of%20Brienne">Walter VI of Brienne</a>, a despot invited to Florence and granted "<a href="signoria">signoria</a>". In fact, after experiencing his own financial troubles, a terminated career, and the failure of Florence in international affairs, and witnessing a host of different natural calamities and the onset of the Black Death in Europe, he became convinced that the <a href="apocalypse">apocalypse</a> and final judgement was near. The bankruptcy of the Buonaccorsi Company led to Villani's conviction and imprisonment in 1346, as he was a main partner. Other banking companies also went bankrupt, such as the Peruzzi in 1343 and the <a href="Compagnia%20dei%20Bardi">Compagnia dei Bardi</a> in 1346 (they were allied in a joint venture by 1336); Villani calculated that before their bankruptcy the Peruzzi had lost some 600,000 florins and the Bardi had lost some 900,000 florins. Although Villani attributed the losses to the companies' massive monetary loans to <a href="Edward%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII%20of%20England">Edward III of England</a> which were never repaid, historian Edwin S. Hunt suggests that the firms simply lacked the resources to have made such loans, which in all probability were much smaller and were not the key reasons for the companies' failures. The Bardi and Peruzzi were just two of many European banks that Edward III accepted loans from, prominent members of the Bardi and other Florentine families were owed only 63,000 Florins by Edward in 1348, and even a mass of small lenders and investors in Florence could not have made the necessary loan to England. The figure Villani asserted of 400,000 Florins owed to the Peruzzi by Edward alone equalled Villani's estimate for the entire payroll of 30,000 workers of the Florentine cloth industry in 1338. Hunt asserts that the failures of the Florentine banks seems closely tied to the expansionist policy of Florence in Tuscany, hoping that newly conquered territory would yield greater security for their trade in northern Europe, but instead resulted in costly campaigns and little profit. In addition to the questionable figures Villani posed for the Peruzzi and Bardi companies, it is also known that several events described in his "Cronica" surrounding the Buonaccorsi's bankruptcy were written to deliberately obscure the truth about the company's fraudulent behavior; Miller writes that "this is one of the most convincing conclusions" of historian Michele Luzzati's "Giovanni Villani e la Compagnia dei Buonaccorsi" (1971).
Villani and the Buonaccorsi had gained an unsavory reputation as early as 1331, when Villani was tried (and cleared) for <a href="Simony">barratry</a> for his part in building the new third circuit of walls around Florence. <a href="Charles%2C%20Duke%20of%20Calabria">Charles, Duke of Calabria</a> had granted the Buonaccorsi the right to tax three of the six districts of Florence, which did not help Villani's reputation amongst his fellow citizens. In early June 1342, partners and agents of the Buonaccorsi suddenly fled Florence, <a href="Avignon">Avignon</a>, and <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, following bankruptcy proceedings by creditors, nearly all of whom had deposits in the Buonaccorsi bank. Like other Florentine bankers and companies having difficulty with bankruptcy at the time, in September 1342 they supported the move to invite Walter VI of Brienne to become the next "<a href="Signoria%20of%20Florence">signor</a>" of Florence. Walter later suspended all legal actions taken against the Buonaccorsi and other company partners for nearly a year.

However, the legal case against the company was reopened and resumed in October 1343, after the violent overthrow of Walter VI. It is unclear how long Villani served his prison sentence for alleged misconduct during the economic disaster of 1346. It is known that he was imprisoned in the "Carceri delle Stinche". After the overthrow of the Brienne regime and a subsequent but short-lived aristocratic signoria, the "novi cives" or new families—some even from the lesser guilds—rose up in late September 1343 and established a government that provided them with much greater representation in officialdom. Villani and other chroniclers disdained these rustic non-aristocrats who suddenly rose to power, considering them brazen upstarts incapable of governance. Villani's class was at a constitutional disadvantage, as twenty-one guilds representing twenty-one equal voices in government meant that the oligarchy of higher guildsmen was "helplessly outnumbered" as historian John M. Najemy states. Yet by the 1350s the general attitude towards the "novi cives" had changed much, as even Villani's brother Matteo depicted them in a heroic light for being united in a coalition with the merchants and artisans to curb <a href="Oligarchy">oligarchic</a> power. Villani was also a staunch supporter of what he deemed the liberties of the Church, while criticizing the new popular government of the "novi cives" since they protested against the many legal exemptions the Church enjoyed. However, he did find civic pride in that the whole city—including the "novi cives"—had joined together in an uprising against Walter VI, whose sins of imposing tyranny were, to Villani, sufficient justification for the violence needed to overthrow him.

Villani's work is an <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a> chronicle written from the perspective of the political class of Florence just as the city rose to a rich and powerful position. Only scanty and partly legendary records had preceded his work, and there is little known of events before the death of <a href="Matilda%20of%20Tuscany">Countess Matilda</a> in 1115. The "Chronica de origine civitatis" was composed sometime before 1231, but there is little comparison between this work and Villani's; mid-20th-century historian Nicolai Rubinstein states that the legendary accounts in this earlier chronicle were "arbitrarily selected by a compiler whose learning and critical faculties were considerably below the standard of his age." In contrast, Rubinstein states Villani provided "a mature expression" of Florentine history. Yet Villani still relied upon the "Chronica de origine civitatis" as the prime source for Florence's early history in his narrative.

In the 36th chapter of Book 8, Villani states that the idea of writing the "Cronica" was suggested to him during the jubilee of Rome in 1300, under the following circumstances after <a href="Pope%20Boniface%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVIII">Pope Boniface VIII</a> made in honor of <a href="Nativity%20of%20Jesus">Christ's nativity</a> a great indulgence; Villani writes:
And being on that blessed pilgrimage in the sacred city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as described by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history ... I took my prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But in view of the fact that our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle the origins of the city of Florence, so far as I have been able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, and at the same time to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.
In his writing, Villani states that he considers Florence to be the "daughter and creation of Rome," but asserts <a href="Decline%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire">Rome's decline</a> and Florence's rise as a great city compelled him to lay out a detailed history of the city. To emphasize the imperial greatness of Florentine history, Villani also asserted that the city was given a second founding when it was rebuilt by <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> (r. 800–814 as <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>)—which was absent from the "Chronica de origine civitatis". Historian <a href="Kenneth%20Hyde">J. K. Hyde</a> writes that the idea of Florence being the daughter of Rome would have given the Florentines a sense of destiny, while the second founding by Charlemagne provided historical context for alliance with France, which Hyde calls "the touchstone of <a href="Guelphs%20and%20Ghibellines">Guelphism</a>". Villani's reasoning for Rome's decline was the schisms of the Church and rebellion against the papal institution, while the ascension of <a href="Otto%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor</a> (r. 962–973) allowed for the conditions of Florence's rise against enemies of papal authority, such as Florentine-conquered <a href="Fiesole">Fiesole</a>. Villani was certain that the Republic of Florence had experienced a great setback on its path to glory with the defeat of the <a href="Guelphs%20and%20Ghibellines">Guelphs by the Ghibellines</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Montaperti">Battle of Montaperti</a> in 1260. Despite this, Villani states that the paramount prosperity and tranquility of the city by 1293 was evidenced by the fact that its gates were no longer locked at night and that indirect taxes such as the gate fee (common in times of war) were not levied. Historian Felicity Ratté states that the validity of this comment should be heavily scrutinized considering the Florence statutes of 1290 that designated employment for individuals in charge of locking the city gates. Villani also contradicts himself by writing of a night attack on Florence in 1323 which clearly demonstrates the fact that the gates were locked at night.
In 1300 or shortly after, Villani began working on the "Cronica", which was divided into twelve books; the first six deal with the largely legendary history of Florence, starting at conventionally biblical times with the story of the <a href="Tower%20of%20Babel">Tower of Babel</a> up to the year 1264. The second phase, in six books, covered the history from 1264 until his own time, all the way up to 1346. He outlined the events in his "Cronica" in year-to-year accounts; for this he has gained criticism over the years for writing in an episodic manner lacking a unifying theme or point of view. He wrote his "Cronica" in the <a href="vernacular">vernacular</a> language rather than <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, the language of the educated elite. His chronicles are intercut with historical episodes reported just as he heard them, sometimes with little interpretation. This often led to historical inaccuracies in his work, especially in the biographies of historical or contemporary people living outside of Florence (even with well-known monarchs).

Despite numerous mistakes, Villani often displayed an insider's knowledge on many subjects, as a result of his extensive travels and access to both official and private documents. For example, De Vries states that he wrote one of the most accurate accounts of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy">Battle of Crécy</a> during the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>, including information that the archers were placed precariously behind the English and Welsh infantry, not on the flanks as others asserted. While describing detailed events unfolding within the city, Villani would name every individual street, square, bridge, family, and person involved, assuming his readers would have the same intimate knowledge of Florence as he did.

Villani is perhaps unequalled for the value of the statistical data he has preserved. For example, he recorded that in Florence there were 80 banks, 146 bakeries, 80 members in an association of city judges with 600 notaries, 60 physicians and surgical doctors, 100 shops and dealers of spices, 8,000 to 10,000 children attending primary school each year, 550 to 600 students attending 4 different schools for <a href="Scholasticism">Scholastic</a> knowledge, 13,200 <a href="bushel">bushel</a>s of grain consumed weekly by the city, and 70,000 to 80,000 pieces of cloth produced in the workshops of the "<a href="Arte%20della%20Lana">Arte della Lana</a>" each year, the latter having a total value of .

Villani was a Guelph, but his book is much more taken up with an inquiry into what is useful and true than with factional party considerations. In a departure from Guelph politics, he favored <a href="republicanism">republicanism</a> over <a href="monarchy">monarchy</a>, praising the philosopher <a href="Brunetto%20Latini">Brunetto Latini</a> as "the master and initiator in refining the Florentines, in making them skilled in good speaking and in knowing how to guide and rule our republic according to political science." However, Villani admitted in his writing that republicanism bred factional strife, that benevolent rulers like <a href="Robert%20of%20Naples">Robert of Naples</a> were sometimes needed to keep order, and republicanism could become tyrannical if it came to represent only one class (such as exclusive favoring of aristocrats, merchants, or artisans). When detailing the construction of the <a href="Florence%20Cathedral">Florence Cathedral</a> and the artist <a href="Giotto%20di%20Bondone">Giotto di Bondone</a> as the designer of the new bell tower, Villani called him "the most sovereign master of painting in his time." Villani's "Cronica" also provides the first known biography of <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> (1265–1321), author of the "<a href="Divine%20Comedy">Divine Comedy</a>", who Villani described as haughty, disdainful, and reserved. In his revised "Cronica" of 1322, Villani shortened Dante's biography and the amount of quotations taken from his "Divine Comedy". Villani's actions are explained by Richard H. Lansing and <a href="Teodolinda%20Barolini">Teodolinda Barolini</a>, who write: "Evidently two decades after the poet's death a conservative writer closely identified with the Florentine state still felt obliged to distance himself from the most outspoken critic of the basis of that state's prestige."
Historian Louis Green writes that the "Cronica" was written with three general assumptions about morality which shaped the organization of the work, "[channeling] events into recurring patterns of significance." These general assumptions were that excess brings disaster, that history is governed by a struggle between right and wrong, and that there is a direct connection between the events of the natural world and the overriding, supernatural and divine will of God who intercedes in these events. For example, Villani described the story of Count Ugolini of <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a>, who at the height of attaining his ill-gotten wealth and power was overthrown and eventually starved to death along with his sons. Green writes that this story in the "Cronica" bears a resemblance to the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greek</a> story of <a href="Polycrates">Polycrates</a> and his ring in the work of <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>. However, Green notes that Villani's "cautionary tales" disembarked from the Classical Greek tradition of the arrogant and haughty rich falling from fortune due to the Greek belief in equalizing forces determining one's unavoidable fate, which Green calls "excessive good fortune having to be balanced by an appropriate measure of sorrow." Villani's adherence to Medieval Christianity allowed him to suggest retribution was delivered because of <a href="sin">sin</a> and insult to God. He stressed that those who gained prestige would fall prey to pride; confidence in their position would then lead them to sin, and sin would bring on a stage of decline. Villani wrote:
... it seems that it happens in the lordships and states of earthly dignitaries, that as they are at their highest peak, so presently does their decline and ruin follow, and not without the providence of divine justice, in order to punish sins and so that no one should place his trust in fallacious good fortune.

For Villani, this theory of sin and morality being tied directly with fate and fortune fit well with the ultimate fate of the <a href="Capetian%20dynasty">Capetian dynasty</a> of France. The <a href="House%20of%20Capet">House of Capet</a> was once the champion of the Church and ally of the papacy. However, Villani correlated <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20France">Philip the Fair</a>'s defiance of <a href="Pope%20Boniface%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVIII">Pope Boniface VIII</a> and seizure of the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Templar's</a> wealth with later Capetian misfortunes, such as Philip's death in a hunting accident, the adultery of the wives of his three sons, the death of his heirs, and even French defeats in the Hundred Years' War. Green points out that in Villani's writing there are two significant earthly powers that seem to be exempt or immune from this theory of immorality leading to downfall: Florence and the papacy. The interests of these two powers represent, as Green states, "the kingpin of Villani's scheme of historical interpretation."

Besides Divine Providence, Villani acknowledged other events that he believed were explainable via the supernatural. He wrote of many instances where holy men offered prophetic statements that later proved true, such as <a href="Pope%20Clement%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIV">Pope Clement IV</a>'s prophecy on the outcome for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tagliacozzo">Battle of Tagliacozzo</a>. He believed that certain events were really <a href="omen">omen</a>s of what was to come. For instance, when a lion was sent to Florence as a gift by Boniface VIII, a donkey purportedly killed the lion. He interpreted this as an omen that foretold the Pope's beating and untimely death shortly after fighting Philip IV at <a href="Anagni">Anagni</a>; Villani wrote: "when the tamed beast kills the King of Beasts, then the dissolution of the Church will begin." He also believed in <a href="astrology">astrology</a> and changes in the heavens as indication of political changes, the deaths of rulers and popes, and natural calamities. However, he noted that the movement of the heavens would not always predetermine the actions of men and did not trump the divine plan of God.

Marilyn Aronberg Lavin states that Villani was most likely serving as a Peruzzi representative in Flanders when he heard the story of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20France">French Jew</a> who in 1290 tried to destroy <a href="Host%20%28Holy%20Communion%29">Host bread</a> (of the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>) but was unsuccessful as the bread allegedly bled profusely as he stabbed it, and turned into flesh as he attempted to boil it in water. In the original account by the <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a> monk Jean de Thilrode in 1294, the Jew was compelled to convert to Christianity, but Villani's account followed that of the later "<a href="Saint-Denis%2C%20Seine-Saint-Denis">Chronicles of Saint-Denis</a>" (1285–1328) which told that the Jew was burned to death for his crime. Villani's "Cronica" marks the first appearance in Italian literature of this legend, while "Villani's report includes details which establish an independent Italian branch of the tradition" according to Lavin. <a href="Antoninus%20of%20Florence">St. Antoninus</a>, <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Florence">archbishop of Florence</a>, repeated the story of Villani in his Latin "Chronicles", while Villani's illustrated "Cronica" featured a scene of this French Jew that later appeared in a painting by <a href="Paolo%20Uccello">Paolo Uccello</a>.

Villani wrote during the <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a>: "The priest who confessed the sick and those who nursed them so generally caught the infection that the victims were abandoned and deprived confession, sacrament, medicine, and nursing ... And many lands and cities were made desolate. And this plague lasted till ________"; Villani left the "_______" in order to record the time in which the plague was to end. Villani was unable to finish the line as he succumbed to the same plague. He was buried in the Church of <a href="Santissima%20Annunziata%2C%20Florence">Santissima Annunziata, Florence</a>.

Villani's "Cronica" was considered an important work at the time, valuable enough for his brother and nephew to continue it. Little is known of Villani's brother, <a href="Matteo%20Villani">Matteo</a>, save that he was twice married, that he died of the plague in 1363, and that he continued work on the "Cronica" until his death. <a href="Filippo%20Villani">Filippo Villani</a>, Matteo's son, flourished in the latter half of the 14th century and ended the "Cronica" at 1364; his portion includes details of the lives of many Florentine artists and musicians, including <a href="Giotto%20di%20Bondone">Giotto di Bondone</a> and <a href="Francesco%20Landini">Francesco Landini</a>. Filippo's chronicles were approved by the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Florence">Chancellor of Florence</a>, <a href="Coluccio%20Salutati">Coluccio Salutati</a>, who made corrections to the work and added commentary. The 15th-century Florentine historian Domenico di Leonardo Buoninsegni also featured in the first two chapters of his "Istoria Fiorentina" a summary of Villani's "Cronica".

By the 16th century, more than one edition of the "Cronica" was available in <a href="Printing">printed form</a>. There was also an abundance of handwritten <a href="Manuscript">illuminated manuscripts</a>, including one from Venice by Bartholomeo Zanetti Casterzagense in 1537 and one from Florence by Lorenzo Torrentino in 1554.

Historian J.K. Hyde states that the "Nuova Cronica" of Villani is representative of the strong vernacular tradition in Florence, appealing to the people of the time as a narrative that was "easy to read, full of human interest and occasionally spiced with <a href="novella">novella</a>-type anecdotes." Hyde also notes that Villani's criticisms of the commune politics in Florence promoted a trend of personal expression amongst later chroniclers that defied official conformity. The "Cronica" is also an incredibly rich historical record; its greatest value to modern historians is its descriptions of the people, data, and events experienced by Villani during his lifetime. Historian Mark Phillips states that all subsequent Florentine accounts of the tyrannical regime of Walter VI of Brienne—including those by <a href="Leonardo%20Bruni">Leonardo Bruni</a> and <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Machiavelli">Niccolò Machiavelli</a>—were based upon the primary source of Villani's "Cronica". Villani's written work on Dante Alighieri and the age in which he lived has provided insight into Dante's work, reasoning, and psyche. The reprinting of new editions of Villani's work in the early 20th century provided material for a resurgence in the study of Dante. However, Villani's descriptions of events which preceded him by centuries are riddled with inaccurate traditional accounts, popular legend, and hearsay.

In regard to his own time, Villani provides modern historians with valuable details on Florentine social and living habits, such as the growing trend and craze of wealthy Florentines in building large country homes far outside of the city. However, the early 20th-century historian <a href="Philip%20Wicksteed">Philip Wicksteed</a> stated of Villani, "When dealing with his own times, and with events immediately connected with Florence, he is a trustworthy witness, but minute accuracy is never his strong point; and in dealing with distant times and places he is hopelessly unreliable." For example, although Nicolai Rubinstein acknowledged that Villani's chronicles were much more matured and developed than earlier ones, Villani still relied on legend and hearsay to account for the origins of cities such as <a href="Fiesole">Fiesole</a>. On Villani's estimation that a third of <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>'s population died off during the <a href="Great%20Famine%20of%201315-1317">Great Famine of 1315-1317</a>, the early 20th-century historian Henry S. Lucas wrote, "not much faith can be placed in such statistics which are little better than guesses." Louis Green notes Villani's limitation as a chronicler and not a full-fledged <a href="historian">historian</a>:
Recording as he did incidents in the order of their occurrence without any of the historian's pretensions to a thematic organization of his material, he could not feed back the lessons of a changing present into a reinterpreted past. Nor did his devotion to the justification and glorification of Florence permit him to see in the altered fortunes of his city a repetition of the pattern of decline he had illustrated in the histories of the great dynasties of his age.
Louis Green asserts that Giovanni's "Cronica" expressed the outlook of the merchant community in Florence at the time, but also provided valuable indications of "how that outlook was modified in a direction away from characteristically medieval to embryonically modern attitudes." Green writes that Villani's "Cronica" was one of three types of chronicles found in the 14th century, the type which was largely a <a href="universal%20history">universal history</a>. Other types would be chronicles of particular historic episodes such as <a href="Dino%20Compagni">Dino Compagni</a>'s account of the White Guelphs and Black Guelphs or the more domestic chronicle that focused on the fortunes and events of one family, as written by Donato Velluti or Giovanni Morelli.

HMS Hood

HMS "Hood" (<a href="pennant%20number">pennant number</a> 51) was the last <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> built for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. Commissioned in 1920, she was named after the 18th-century Admiral <a href="Samuel%20Hood%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Hood">Samuel Hood</a>. One of four ordered in mid-1916, "Hood" had design limitations, though her design was revised after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> and improved while she was under construction. For this reason, she was the only ship of her class to be completed. Despite the appearance of new and more modern ship designs over time, "Hood" remained the largest and most powerful warship in the world for 20 years after her commissioning, and her prestige was reflected in her nickname, "The Mighty Hood".

"Hood" was involved in several <a href="wikt%3Ashow%20the%20flag">showing-the-flag</a> exercises between her commissioning in 1920 and the outbreak of war in 1939, including training exercises in the Mediterranean Sea and a circumnavigation of the globe with the <a href="Cruise%20of%20the%20Special%20Service%20Squadron">Special Service Squadron</a> in 1923 and 1924. She was attached to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet">Mediterranean Fleet</a> following the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20Italo-Abyssinian%20War">Second Italo-Abyssinian War</a>. When the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> broke out, "Hood" was officially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet until she had to return to Britain in 1939 for an overhaul. By this time, advances in naval gunnery had reduced "Hood"s usefulness. She was scheduled to undergo a major rebuild in 1941 to correct these issues, but the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in September 1939 forced the ship into service without the upgrades.

When war with Germany was declared, "Hood" was operating in the area around <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>, and she spent the next several months hunting for German <a href="commerce%20raider">commerce raider</a>s and <a href="blockade%20runner">blockade runner</a>s between Iceland and the <a href="Norwegian%20Sea">Norwegian Sea</a>. After a brief overhaul of her propulsion system, she sailed as the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of <a href="Force%20H">Force H</a>, and participated in the <a href="destruction%20of%20the%20French%20Fleet%20at%20Mers-el-Kebir">destruction of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir</a>. Relieved as flagship of Force H, "Hood" was dispatched to <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>, and operated in the area as a convoy escort and later as a defence against a potential German invasion fleet. In May 1941, the <a href="battleship">battleship</a> and she were ordered to intercept the and the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> , which were "en route" to the Atlantic, where they were to attack convoys. On 24 May 1941, early in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Denmark%20Strait">Battle of the Denmark Strait</a>, "Hood" was struck by several German shells, exploded, and sank within 3 minutes, with the loss of all but three of her crew. Due to her perceived invincibility, the loss affected British morale.

The <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> conducted two inquiries into the reasons for the ship's quick demise. The first, held soon after the ship's loss, concluded that "Hood"s aft <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a> had exploded after one of "Bismarck"s shells penetrated the ship's armour. A second inquiry was held after complaints that the first board had failed to consider alternative explanations, such as an explosion of the ship's <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es. It was more thorough than the first board and concurred with the first board's conclusion. Despite the official explanation, some historians continued to believe that the torpedoes caused the ship's loss, while others proposed an accidental explosion inside one of the ship's <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s that reached down into the magazine. Other historians have concentrated on the cause of the magazine explosion. The discovery of the ship's wreck in 2001 confirmed the conclusion of both boards, although the exact reason the magazines detonated is likely to remain unknown since that area of the ship was destroyed in the explosion.

The" Admiral"-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the German s, which were reported to be more heavily armed and armoured than the latest British battlecruisers of the and the es. The design was revised after the Battle of Jutland to incorporate heavier armour and all four ships were laid down. Only "Hood" was completed, because the ships were very expensive and required labour and material that could be put to better use building merchant ships needed to replace those lost to the <a href="Atlantic%20U-boat%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">German U-boat campaign</a>.

"Hood" was significantly larger than her predecessors of the "Renown" class. As completed, she had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a maximum <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. This was longer and wider than the older ships. She displaced at load and at deep load, over more than the older ships. The ship had a complete <a href="double%20bottom">double bottom</a>. "Hood" had a <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a> of at deep load, which minimised her roll and made her a steady gun platform.

The additional armour added during construction increased her draught by about at deep load, which reduced her <a href="freeboard%20%28nautical%29">freeboard</a> and made her very wet. At full speed, or in heavy seas, water would flow over the ship's <a href="quarterdeck">quarterdeck</a> and often entered the <a href="messdeck">messdeck</a>s and living quarters through ventilation shafts. This characteristic earned her the nickname of "the largest submarine in the Navy". The persistent dampness, coupled with the ship's poor ventilation, was blamed for the high incidence of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> aboard. The ship's complement varied widely over her career; in 1919, she was authorised 1433 men as a squadron flagship; in 1934, she had 81 officers and 1244 men aboard.

The propulsion system consisted of 24 <a href="Yarrow%20boiler">Yarrow boiler</a>s, connected to Brown-Curtis geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s driving four propellers. The battlecruiser's turbines were designed to produce , which would propel the ship at , but during <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s in 1920, "Hood"s turbines provided , which allowed her to reach . She carried about of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, which gave an estimated range of at .

"Hood" carried eight 42-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">calibre</a> <a href="British%20ordnance%20terms%23BL">BL</a> <a href="BL%2015%20inch%20Mk%20I%20naval%20gun">15-inch Mk I guns</a> in hydraulically powered twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s. The guns could depress to −5° and elevate to +30°. At maximum elevation, they fired a shell to a maximum range of . The turrets were designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear, and 120 shells were carried for each gun.

"Hood"s secondary armament was a dozen 50-calibre <a href="BL%205.5%20inch%20Mark%20I%20naval%20gun">BL 5.5-inch Mk I</a> guns, each with 200 rounds. They were shipped on <a href="gun%20shield">shielded</a> single-<a href="pivot%20gun">pivot mounts</a> fitted along the upper deck and the forward shelter deck. This high position allowed them to be worked during heavy weather, as they were less affected by waves and spray compared with the <a href="casemate">casemate</a> mounts of earlier British <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s. Two of these guns on the shelter deck were temporarily replaced by <a href="QF%204%20inch%20Mk%20V%20naval%20gun">QF 4-inch Mk V</a> <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">antiaircraft</a> (AA) guns between 1938 and 1939. All the 5.5-inch guns were removed during another refit in 1940. The gun fired a shell to a maximum range of .

The original antiaircraft armament consisted of four QF 4-inch Mk V guns on single mounts. These were joined in early 1939 by four twin mounts for the 45-calibre <a href="QF%204%20inch%20Mk%20XVI%20naval%20gun">QF 4-inch Mark XVI</a> <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a>. The single guns were removed in mid-1939 and a further three twin Mark XIX mounts were added in early 1940. This mounting could elevate from −10 to +80°. The Mk XVI gun fired about twelve <a href="British%20ordnance%20terms%23HE">high-explosive</a> shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of . Against surface targets, it had a range of and a maximum ceiling of , but an effective anti-aircraft range of much less.

In 1931, a pair of octuple mountings for the <a href="QF%202%20pounder%20naval%20gun">QF 2-pounder Mk VIII gun</a> were added on the shelter deck, abreast of the funnels, and a third mount was added in 1937. These gun mounts could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of +80°. The Mk VIII 2-pounder gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a distance of . The gun's rate of fire was around 96–98 rounds per minute.

Two quadruple mountings for the <a href="Vickers%20machine%20gun">0.5-inch Vickers Mk III</a> machine gun were added in 1933 with two more mountings added in 1937. These mounts could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of +70°. The machine guns fired a bullet at a muzzle velocity of . This gave the gun a maximum range around , although its effective range was only . To these were added five <a href="unrotated%20projectile">unrotated projectile</a> launchers in 1940, each launcher carrying 20 rockets. When they detonated, the rockets shot out lengths of cable that were kept aloft by <a href="parachute">parachute</a>s; the cable was intended to snag aircraft and draw up the small aerial mine that would destroy the aircraft.

Six fixed <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s were mounted on "Hood", three on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. Two of these were submerged forward of 'A' turret's <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a> and the other four were above water, <a href="wikt%3Aabaft">abaft</a> the rear funnel. The <a href="British%2021%20inch%20torpedo">Mk IV torpedoes</a> had a warhead of of <a href="Trinitrotoluene">TNT</a>. They had two speed and range settings - with a maximum range of or to . About 28 torpedoes were carried.

"Hood" was completed with two <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control directors</a>. One was mounted above the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a>, protected by an armoured hood, and was fitted with a <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>. The other was fitted in the <a href="Top%20%28sailing%20ship%29">spotting top</a> above the tripod <a href="foremast">foremast</a> and equipped with a rangefinder. Each turret was also fitted with a rangefinder.

The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a>. They were supplemented by two additional control positions in the fore-top, which were provided with rangefinders, fitted in 1924–25. The antiaircraft guns were controlled by a simple high-angle rangefinder mounted on the aft control position, fitted in 1926–27. Three torpedo-control towers were fitted, each with a rangefinder. One was on each side of the amidships control tower and the third was on the centreline abaft the aft control position.

During the 1929–31 refit, a <a href="HACS">high-angle control system</a> (HACS) Mark I director was added on the rear searchlight platform and two positions for 2-pounder "pom-pom" antiaircraft directors were added at the rear of the spotting top, although only one director was initially fitted. The 5.5-inch control positions and their rangefinders on the spotting top were removed during the 1932 refit. In 1934, the "pom-pom" directors were moved to the former locations of the 5.5-inch control positions on the spotting top and the rangefinders for the 5.5-inch control positions were reinstalled on the signal platform.

Two years later, the "pom-pom" directors were moved to the rear corners of the bridge to get them out of the funnel gases. Another "pom-pom" director was added on the rear superstructure, abaft the HACS director in 1938. Two HACS Mark III directors were added to the aft end of the signal platform the following year, and the Mark I director aft was replaced by a Mark III. During "Hood"s last refit in 1941, a <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20279">Type 279</a> air warning radar and a <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20284">Type 284</a> gunnery radar were installed, although the Type 279 radar lacked its receiving aerial and was inoperable.

"Hood"s armour scheme was originally based on that of the battlecruiser with an <a href="Belt%20armor">waterline belt</a>. Unlike on "Tiger", the armour was angled outwards 12° from the waterline to increase its relative thickness in relation to flat-trajectory shells. This change increased the ship's vulnerability to <a href="plunging%20fire">plunging</a> (high-trajectory) shells, as it exposed more of the vulnerable deck armour. of armour were added to the design in late 1916, based on British experiences at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a>, at the cost of deeper draught and slightly decreased speed.

To save construction time, this was accomplished by thickening the existing armour, rather than redesigning the entire ship. "Hood"s protection accounted for 33% of her displacement, a high proportion by British standards, but less than was usual in contemporary German designs (for example, 36% for the battlecruiser ).

The armoured belt consisted of face-hardened <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armour">Krupp cemented armour</a> (KC), arranged in three <a href="strake">strake</a>s. The main waterline belt was 12 inches (305 mm) thick between 'A' and 'Y' <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s and thinned to 5 to 6 inches (127 to 152 mm) towards the ship's ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. The middle armour belt had a maximum thickness of 7 inches (178 mm) over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to five inches abreast 'A' barbette. The upper belt was 5 inches thick amidships and extended forward to 'A' barbette, with a short 4-inch (102 mm) extension aft.

The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by of KC armour, except for the turret roofs, which were 5 inches thick. The decks were made of high-tensile steel. The <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> deck ranged from 1.75 to 2.0 inches (44 to 51 mm) in thickness, while the upper deck was 2 inches (51 mm) thick over the <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and 0.75 inches (19 mm) elsewhere. The main deck was 3 inches (76 mm) thick over the magazines and 1 inch (25 mm) elsewhere, except for the 2-inch-thick slope that met the bottom of the main belt. The lower deck was 3 inches thick over the <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>s, 2 inches thick over the magazines and 1 inch elsewhere.

The 3-inch plating on the main deck was added at a very late stage of construction and the four aftermost 5.5-inch guns and their ammunition hoists were removed in partial compensation. Live-firing trials with the new 15-inch APC (armour-piercing, capped) shell against a mock-up of "Hood" showed that this shell could penetrate the ship's vitals via the 7-inch middle belt and the 2-inch slope of the main deck. A proposal was made to increase the armour over the forward magazines to 5 inches and 6 inches over the rear magazines in July 1919 in response to these trials. To compensate for the additional weight, the two submerged torpedo tubes and the armour for the rear torpedo warheads were removed, and the armour for the aft torpedo-control tower was reduced in thickness from 6 to . However, the additional armour was never fitted pending further trials. As completed, "Hood" remained susceptible to plunging shells and bombs. The torpedo warhead armour was reinstated during the ship's 1929–1931 refit.

For protection against torpedoes, she was given a deep <a href="torpedo%20bulge">torpedo bulge</a> that ran the length of the ship between the fore and aft barbettes. It was divided into an empty outer compartment and an inner compartment filled with five rows of water-tight "crushing tubes" intended to absorb and distribute the force of an explosion. The bulge was backed by a 1.5-inch-thick <a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a>.

"Hood" was initially fitted with flying-off platforms mounted on top of 'B' and 'X' turrets, from which <a href="Fairey%20Flycatcher">Fairey Flycatcher</a>s could launch. During her 1929–31 refit, the platform was removed from 'X' turret and a trainable, folding <a href="aircraft%20catapult">catapult</a> was installed on her <a href="quarterdeck">quarterdeck</a>, along with a crane to recover a <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a>. She embarked a <a href="Fairey%20III">Fairey III</a>F from No. 444 Flight of the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>. During the 1932 <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a> cruise, the catapult proved to be difficult to operate in anything but a calm sea, as it was frequently awash in bad weather. The catapult and crane were removed in 1932, along with the flying-off platform on 'B' turret.

Although the Royal Navy always designated "Hood" as a battlecruiser, some modern writers such as <a href="Anthony%20Preston%20%28naval%20historian%29">Anthony Preston</a> have classified her as a <a href="fast%20battleship">fast battleship</a>, since "Hood" appeared to have improvements over the fast s. On paper, "Hood" retained the same armament and level of protection, while being significantly faster.

Around 1918, American commanders, including Vice Admiral <a href="William%20Sims">William Sims</a>, commander of US naval forces in Europe, and Admiral <a href="Henry%20T.%20Mayo">Henry T. Mayo</a>, commander of the <a href="United%20States%20Fleet%20Forces%20Command">Atlantic Fleet</a>, became extremely impressed by "Hood", which they described as a "fast battleship", and they advocated that the US Navy develop a fast battleship of its own. However, the US continued with their established design direction, the slower, but well-protected battleship and the fast and lightly armoured , both of which were later cancelled in accordance with the terms of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> of 1922.

Influences from "Hood" showed on subsequent "Lexington" designs, with the reduction of the main armour belt, the change to "<a href="sloped%20armour">sloped armour</a>", and the addition of four above-water torpedo tubes to the four underwater tubes of the original design. To add to the confusion, Royal Navy documents of the period often describe any battleship with a maximum speed over as a battlecruiser, regardless of the amount of protective armour. For instance, the never-built <a href="G3%20battlecruiser">G3 battlecruiser</a> was classified as such, although it would have been more of a fast battleship than "Hood".

The scale of "Hood"s protection, though adequate for the Jutland era, was at best marginal against the new generation of gunned capital ships that emerged soon after her completion in 1920, typified by the American and the Japanese s. The Royal Navy were fully aware that the ship's protection flaws still remained, even in her revised design, so "Hood" was intended for the duties of a battlecruiser and she served in the battlecruiser squadrons through most of her career. Late in her career, "Hood" was outclassed by the armour and protective arrangement of World War II-era fast battleships, but few available "big gun" vessels could match "Bismarck"s speed, and in 1941, the Admiralty included "Hood" among the ships sent to engage the German battleship "<a href="German%20battleship%20Bismarck">Bismarck</a>".

Construction of "Hood" began at the <a href="John%20Brown%20%26amp%3B%20Company">John Brown & Company</a> shipyards in <a href="Clydebank">Clydebank</a>, Scotland, on 1 September 1916. Following the loss of three British battlecruisers at the Battle of Jutland, 5,000 tons of extra armour and bracing were added to "Hood"s design. Most seriously, the deck protection was flawed—spread over three decks, it was designed to detonate an incoming shell on impact with the top deck, with much of the energy being absorbed as the exploding shell had to penetrate the armour of the next two decks. The development of effective time-delay shells at the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> made this scheme much less effective, as the intact shell would penetrate layers of weak armour and explode deep inside the ship. In addition, she was grossly overweight compared to her original design, making her a wet ship with a highly stressed structure.

She was launched on 22 August 1918 by the widow of Rear Admiral Sir <a href="Horace%20Hood">Horace Hood</a>, a great-great-grandson of Admiral Samuel Hood, after whom the ship was named. Sir Horace Hood had been killed while commanding the <a href="3rd%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">3rd Battlecruiser Squadron</a> and flying his flag on —one of the three battlecruisers which blew up at the Battle of Jutland. To make room in John Brown's shipyard for merchant construction, "Hood" sailed for <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a> to complete her <a href="fitting-out">fitting-out</a> on 9 January 1920. After <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, she was commissioned on 15 May 1920, under <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> Wilfred Tompkinson. She had cost £6,025,000 to build (roughly equivalent to £ today).

With her conspicuous twin funnels and lean profile, "Hood" was widely regarded one of the finest-looking warships ever built. She was also the largest warship afloat when she was commissioned, and retained that distinction for the next 20 years. Her size and powerful armament earned her the nickname of "Mighty Hood" and she came to symbolise the might of the British Empire itself.

Shortly after commissioning on 15 May 1920, "Hood" became the flagship of the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet, under the command of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> Sir <a href="Roger%20Keyes%2C%201st%20Baron%20Keyes">Roger Keyes</a>. After a cruise to Scandinavian waters that year, Captain Geoffrey Mackworth assumed command. "Hood" visited the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> in 1921 and 1922 to show the flag and to train with the Mediterranean fleet, before sailing on a cruise to Brazil and the West Indies in company with the battlecruiser squadron.

Captain John im Thurn was in command when "Hood", accompanied by the battlecruiser and s of the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron, set out <a href="Cruise%20of%20the%20Special%20Service%20Squadron">on a world cruise</a> from west to east via the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> in November 1923. The objective of the cruise was to remind the <a href="dominion">dominion</a>s of their dependence on British sea power and encourage them to support it with money, ships, and facilities. They returned home 10 months later in September 1924, having visited <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="British%20India">India</a>, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and some smaller colonies and dependencies, and the United States.

While in Australia in April 1924, the squadron escorted the battlecruiser out to sea, where she was <a href="scuttled">scuttled</a> in compliance with the Washington Naval Treaty. The battlecruiser squadron visited <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> in January 1925 to participate in the <a href="Vasco%20da%20Gama">Vasco da Gama</a> celebrations before continuing on to the Mediterranean for exercises. "Hood" continued this pattern of a winter training visit to the Mediterranean for the rest of the decade. Captain Harold Reinold relieved Captain im Thurn on 30 April 1925 and was relieved in turn by Captain <a href="Wilfred%20French">Wilfred French</a> on 21 May 1927.

"Hood" was given a major refit from 1 May 1929 to 10 March 1931, and afterwards resumed her role as flagship of the battlecruiser squadron under the command of Captain <a href="Julian%20Patterson">Julian Patterson</a>. Later that year, her crew participated in the <a href="Invergordon%20Mutiny">Invergordon Mutiny</a> over pay cuts for the sailors. It ended peacefully and "Hood" returned to her home port afterwards. The battlecruiser squadron made a Caribbean cruise in early 1932, and "Hood" was given another brief refit between 31 March and 10 May at <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>. Captain Thomas Binney assumed command on 15 August 1932 and the ship resumed her previous practice of a winter cruise in the Mediterranean the next year. Captain Thomas Tower replaced Captain Binney on 30 August 1933. Her secondary and antiaircraft fire-control directors were rearranged during another quick refit between 1 August and 5 September 1934.

While "en route" to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> for a Mediterranean cruise, "Hood" was rammed in the port side <a href="quarterdeck">quarterdeck</a> by the battlecruiser on 23 January 1935. The damage to "Hood" was limited to her left outer propeller and an 18-inch (460 mm) dent, although some hull plates were knocked loose from the impact. Temporary repairs were made at Gibraltar before the ship sailed to Portsmouth for permanent repairs between February and May 1935. The captains of both ships were <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>led, as was the squadron commander, Rear Admiral Sidney Bailey. Tower and Bailey were acquitted, but "Renown"s Captain Sawbridge was relieved of command. The Admiralty dissented from the verdict, reinstated Sawbridge, and criticised Bailey for ambiguous signals during the manoeuvre.

The ship participated in <a href="King%20George%20V">King George V</a>'s Silver Jubilee <a href="Fleet%20Review">Fleet Review</a> at <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a> the following August. She was attached to the Mediterranean fleet shortly afterwards and stationed at Gibraltar at the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20Italo-Abyssinian%20War">Second Italo-Abyssinian War</a> in October. Captain Arthur Pridham assumed command on 1 February 1936 and "Hood" returned to Portsmouth for a brief refit between 26 June and 10 October 1936. She formally transferred to the Mediterranean fleet on 20 October, shortly after the beginning of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. On 23 April 1937, the ship escorted three British merchantmen into <a href="Bilbao">Bilbao</a> harbour despite the presence of the <a href="Spanish%20State">Nationalist</a> cruiser that attempted to blockade the port. "Hood" was refitted at Malta in November and December 1937, and had her submerged torpedo tubes removed. Captain Pridham was relieved by Captain Harold Walker on 20 May 1938 and he, in turn, was relieved when the ship returned to Portsmouth in January 1939 for an overhaul that lasted until 12 August.

"Hood" was due to be modernised in 1941 to bring her up to a standard similar to that of other modernised World War I-era capital ships. She would have received new, lighter turbines and boilers, a secondary armament of eight twin 5.25-inch gun turrets and six octuple 2-pounder pom-poms. Her 5-inch upper-armour strake would have been removed and her deck armour reinforced. A catapult would have been fitted across the deck and the remaining torpedo tubes removed. In addition, the conning tower would have been removed and her <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> rebuilt. The ship's near-constant active service, resulting from her status as the Royal Navy's most battle-worthy fast <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>, meant that her material condition gradually deteriorated, and by the mid-1930s, she was in need of a lengthy overhaul. The outbreak of World War II made removing her from service near impossible, and as a consequence, she never received the scheduled modernisation afforded to other capital ships such as the battlecruiser and several of the s. The ship's condensers were in such bad condition by this time that much of the output from the fresh-water evaporators was required to replenish the boiler feed water and could not be used by the crew to wash and bathe or even to heat the mess decks during cold weather, as the steam pipes were too leaky. These problems also reduced her steam output so that she was unable to attain her designed speed.

Captain <a href="Irvine%20Glennie">Irvine Glennie</a> assumed command in May 1939 and "Hood" was assigned to the Home Fleet's Battlecruiser Squadron while still refitting. When war broke out later that year, she was employed principally to patrol in the vicinity of <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> and the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a> to protect convoys and intercept German <a href="merchant%20raider">merchant raider</a>s and <a href="blockade%20runner">blockade runner</a>s attempting to break out into the Atlantic. On 25 September 1939, the Home Fleet sortied into the central <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> to cover the return of the damaged submarine . The fleet was spotted by the Germans and attacked by aircraft from the <a href="Kampfgeschwader%2026">KG 26</a> and <a href="Kampfgeschwader%2030">KG 30</a> bomber wings. "Hood" was hit by a 250 kg (550 lb) bomb from a <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2088">Junkers Ju 88</a> <a href="bomber">bomber</a> that damaged her port torpedo bulge and her condensers. By early 1940, "Hood"s machinery was in dire shape and limited her best speed to ; she was refitted between 4 April and 12 June.

"Hood" and the aircraft carrier were ordered to Gibraltar to join <a href="Force%20H">Force H</a> on 18 June where "Hood" became the flagship. Force H took part in the <a href="Attack%20on%20Mers-el-K%C3%A9bir">destruction of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir</a> in July 1940. Just eight days after the French surrender, the British Admiralty issued an ultimatum that the French fleet at <a href="Oran">Oran</a> intern its ships in a British or neutral port to ensure they would not fall into <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> hands. The terms were rejected and the Royal Navy opened fire on the French ships berthed there. The results of "Hood"s fire are not known exactly, but she damaged the , which was hit by four fifteen-inch shells and was forced to beach herself. "Hood" was <a href="wikt%3Astraddle">straddled</a> during the engagement by "Dunkerque"; shell splinters wounded two men. "Dunkerque"s <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>, , managed to escape from the harbour. "Hood" and several light cruisers gave chase, but gave up after two hours: "Hood" had dodged a salvo of torpedoes from a French <a href="sloop-of-war">sloop</a> and had stripped a turbine reaching .

"Hood" was relieved as flagship of Force H by "Renown" on 10 August, after returning to Scapa Flow. On 13 September, after a short refit, she was sent to <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a> along with the battleships and and other ships, to be in a better position to intercept a German invasion fleet. When the threat of an invasion diminished, the ship resumed her previous roles in convoy escort and patrolling against German commerce raiders. Twice, "Hood" was dispatched against enemy warships. On 28 October she sailed to intercept the "pocket battleship" , and again on 24 December to locate the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> , but "Hood" failed to find either ship.

In January 1941, the ship began a refit that lasted until March; even after the refit she was still in poor condition, but the threat from the German capital ships was such that she could not be taken into dock for a major overhaul until more of the battleships came into service. Captain <a href="Ralph%20Kerr">Ralph Kerr</a> assumed command during the refit, and "Hood" was ordered to sea in an attempt to intercept the German battleships and upon the refit's completion in mid-March. Unsuccessful, she was ordered to patrol the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a> against any breakout attempt by the German ships from <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a>. "Hood" was ordered to the <a href="Norwegian%20Sea">Norwegian Sea</a> on 19 April when the Admiralty received a false report that the had sailed from Germany. Afterwards, she patrolled the North Atlantic before putting into Scapa Flow on 6 May.

When "Bismarck" sailed for the Atlantic in May 1941, "Hood", together with the newly commissioned battleship , was sent out in pursuit along with several other groups of British capital ships to intercept the German ships before they could break into the Atlantic and attack Allied convoys. "Hood" was commanded by <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Ralph%20Kerr">Ralph Kerr</a> and was flying the flag of <a href="Vice-Admiral">Vice-Admiral</a> <a href="Lancelot%20Holland">Lancelot Holland</a>. The German ships were spotted by two British heavy cruisers ( & ) on 23 May, and Holland's ships intercepted "Bismarck" and her consort, the heavy cruiser , in the <a href="Denmark%20Strait">Denmark Strait</a> between <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a> and <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> on 24 May.

The British squadron spotted the Germans at 05:37 (ship's clocks were set four hours ahead of local time – the engagement commenced shortly after dawn), but the Germans were already aware of their presence, "Prinz Eugen"s <a href="hydrophone">hydrophone</a>s having previously detected the sounds of high-speed propellers to their southeast. The British opened fire at 05:52 with "Hood" engaging "Prinz Eugen", the lead ship in the German formation, and the Germans returned fire at 05:55, both ships concentrating on "Hood". "Prinz Eugen" was probably the first ship to score when a shell hit "Hood"s boat deck, between her <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnels</a>, and started a large fire among the ready-use ammunition for the anti-aircraft guns and rockets of the UP mounts.
Just before 06:00, while "Hood" was turning 20° to port to unmask her rear turrets, she was hit again on the boat deck by one or more shells from "Bismarck"s fifth salvo, fired from a range of approximately . A shell from this salvo appears to have hit the <a href="spotting%20top">spotting top</a>, as the boat deck was showered with body parts and debris. A huge jet of flame burst out of "Hood" from the vicinity of the mainmast, followed by a devastating magazine explosion that destroyed the aft part of the ship. This explosion broke the back of "Hood", and the last sight of the ship, which sank in only three minutes, was her bow, nearly vertical in the water. A note on a survivor's sketch in the British RN Historical Branch Archives gives as the position of the sinking. "Hood" sank stern first with 1418 men aboard. Only three survived: <a href="Ordinary%20seaman%20%28rating%29">Ordinary</a> <a href="Signalman%20%28rank%29">Signalman</a> <a href="Ted%20Briggs">Ted Briggs</a>, <a href="Able%20Seaman%20%28rank%29">Able Seaman</a> Robert Tilburn, and <a href="Midshipman">Midshipman</a> William John Dundas. The three were rescued about two hours after the sinking by the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> , which spotted substantial debris but no bodies.

"Prince of Wales" was forced to disengage by a combination of damage from German hits and mechanical failures in her guns and turrets after "Hood" was sunk. Despite these problems, she had hit "Bismarck" three times. One of these hits contaminated a good portion of the ship's fuel supply and subsequently caused her to steer for safety in <a href="occupied%20France">occupied France</a> where she could be repaired. "Bismarck" was temporarily able to evade detection, <a href="Last%20battle%20of%20the%20battleship%20Bismarck">but was later spotted and sunk by the British on 27 May</a>.

The official Admiralty <a href="communiqu%C3%A9">communiqué</a> on the loss, broadcast on the day of the sinking, reported that: "during the ... action, HMS "Hood" ... received an unlucky hit in a <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29%23Naval%20magazines">magazine</a> and blew up." The first formal board of enquiry into the loss, presided over by Vice-Admiral <a href="Geoffrey%20Blake%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Sir Geoffrey Blake</a>, reported on 2 June, less than a fortnight after the loss. It endorsed this opinion, stating that:
The conduct of the inquiry became subject to criticism (e.g. from Admiral <a href="Tom%20Phillips%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Tom Phillips</a>), largely because no verbatim record of witnesses' testimony had been kept. Moreover, Sir Stanley V. Goodall, <a href="Director%20of%20Naval%20Construction">Director of Naval Construction</a> came forward with an alternative theory, that the "Hood" had been destroyed by the explosion of her own torpedoes. As a result, a second Board was convened under Rear Admiral Sir <a href="Harold%20Walker%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Harold Walker</a> and reported in September 1941. This investigation was "much more thorough than was the first, taking evidence from a total of 176 eyewitnesses to the disaster", and examined both Goodall's theory and others (see below). The Board came to a conclusion almost identical to that of the first board, expressed as follows:

Both boards of enquiry exonerated Vice-Admiral Holland from any blame regarding the loss of "Hood".

Memorials to those who died are spread widely around the UK, and some of the crew are commemorated in different locations. One casualty, George David Spinner, is remembered on the Portsmouth Naval memorial, the Hood Chapel at the Church of St John the Baptist, in <a href="Boldre">Boldre</a>, Hampshire, and also on the gravestone of his brother, who died while serving in the Royal Air Force in 1942, in the <a href="Hamilton%20Road%20Cemetery%2C%20Deal">Hamilton Road Cemetery</a>, Deal, Kent.

The exact cause of the loss of "Hood" remains a subject of debate. The principal theories include the following causes:

At the second board, expert witnesses suggested that what was observed was the venting, through the engine-room ventilators, of a violent—but not instantaneous—explosion or <a href="deflagration">deflagration</a> in the 4-inch shell magazines. The same deflagration would have collapsed the bulkhead separating the 4-inch and 15-inch magazines, resulting very quickly in a catastrophic explosion similar to those previously witnessed at Jutland. This theory was ultimately adopted by the board.

An extensive review of these theories (excepting that of Preston) is given in Jurens's 1987 article. Its main conclusion is that the loss was almost certainly precipitated by the explosion of a 4-inch magazine, but that there are several ways this could have been initiated, although he rules out the boat deck fire or the detonation of her torpedoes as probable causes. In Jurens's opinion, the popular image of plunging shells penetrating "Hood"s deck armour is inaccurate, as by his estimation the angle of fall of "Bismarck"s 15-inch shells at the moment of the loss would not have exceeded about 14°, an angle so unfavourable to penetration of horizontal armour that it is actually off the scale of contemporaneous German penetration charts. Moreover, computer-generated profiles of "Hood" show that a shell falling at this angle could not have reached an aft magazine without first passing through some part of the belt armour. On the other hand, the 12-inch belt could have been penetrated if "Hood" had progressed sufficiently far into her final turn.

A more recent development is the discovery of "Hood"s wreck. Inspection of the wreck has confirmed that the aft magazines did indeed explode. The stern of the "Hood" was located, with the rudder still in place, and it was found that this was set to port at the time of the explosion. Furthermore, a section of the bow immediately forward of 'A' turret is missing, which has led historian and former <a href="Britannia%20Royal%20Naval%20College">Dartmouth</a> lecturer <a href="Eric%20J.%20Grove">Eric J. Grove</a> and expedition leader <a href="David%20Mearns">David Mearns</a> to believe that "either just before or just after leaving the surface, the bow suffered massive internal damage from an internal explosion", possibly a partial detonation of the forward 15-inch magazines.

It has been suggested that the fatal fire spread from the aft end of the ship through the starboard fuel tanks, since the starboard side of "Hood" "appears to be missing most, if not all of its torpedo bulge plating".

The evidence of the wreck refutes Goodall's theory of a torpedo explosion, while the eyewitness evidence of venting from the 4-inch magazine prior to the main explosion conflicts with the theory that the "Hood" was blown up by her own guns. The other theories listed above remain valid possibilities.

In 2001, British broadcaster <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> commissioned shipwreck hunter <a href="David%20Mearns">David Mearns</a> and his company, Blue Water Recoveries, to locate the wreck of "Hood", and if possible, produce underwater footage of both the battlecruiser and her attacker, "Bismarck". This was to be used for a major event documentary to be aired on the 60th anniversary of the ships' battle. This was the first time anyone had attempted to locate "Hood"s resting place. Mearns had spent the previous six years privately researching the fate of "Hood" with the goal of finding the battlecruiser, and had acquired the support of the Royal Navy, the HMS "Hood" Association and other veterans groups, and the last living survivor, <a href="Ted%20Briggs">Ted Briggs</a>.

The search team and equipment had to be organised within four months, to take advantage of a narrow window of calm conditions in the North Atlantic. Organisation of the search was complicated by the presence on board of a documentary team and their film equipment, along with a television journalist who made live news reports via satellite during the search. The search team also planned to <a href="Streaming%20media">stream</a> video from the <a href="remotely%20operated%20underwater%20vehicle">remotely operated underwater vehicle</a> (ROV) directly to Channel 4's website.

After footage of "Bismarck" was collected, Mearns and the search team began scanning a search box for "Hood"; completely covering the area was estimated to take six days. Areas that Mearns felt were more likely to hold the wreck were prioritised, and the <a href="side-scan%20sonar">side-scan sonar</a> located the battlecruiser in the 39th hour of the search.

"Hood"s wreck lies on the seabed in pieces among two debris fields at a depth of about . The eastern field includes the small piece of the stern that survived the magazine explosion, as well as the surviving section of the bow and some smaller remains such as the propellers. The 4-inch fire-control director lies in the western debris field. The heavily armoured conning tower is located by itself a distance from the main wreck. The amidships section, the biggest part of the wreck to survive the explosions, lies inverted south of the eastern debris field in a large impact crater. The starboard side of the amidships section is missing down to the inner wall of the fuel tanks and the plates of the hull are curling outward; this has been interpreted as indicating the path of the explosion through the starboard fuel tanks.

It is further supposed that the small debris fields are the fragments from the aft hull where the magazines and turrets were located, since that section of the hull was totally destroyed in the explosion. The fact that the bow section separated just forward of 'A' turret is suggestive that a secondary explosion might have occurred in this area. Other researchers have claimed that the final salvo fired by "Hood" was not a salvo at all, but flame from the forward magazine explosion, which gave the illusion of "Hood" firing for the last time. This damage, ahead of the armoured bulkhead, could have been implosion damage suffered while "Hood" sank, as a torpedo room that had been removed during one of her last refits approximates the site of the break.

It was the opinion of Mearns and White who investigated the wreck that this was unlikely as the damage was far too limited in scale, nor could it account for the outwardly splayed plates also observed in that area. Bill Jurens points out that there was no magazine of any kind at the location of the break and that the location of the break just forward of the forward transverse armoured bulkhead suggests that the ship's structure failed there as a result of stresses inflicted when the bow was lifted into the vertical position by the sinking stern section. Furthermore, the current position of the plates at the edge of the break only reflects their last position, not the direction that they first moved.

The forward section lies on its port side, with the amidships section keel up. The stern section rises from the seabed at an angle. This position shows the rudder locked into a 20° port turn, confirming that orders had been given (just prior to the aft magazines detonating) to change the ship's heading and bring the aft turrets 'X' and 'Y' to bear on the German ships.

In 2002, the site was officially designated a <a href="war%20grave">war grave</a> by the British government. As such, it remains a protected place under the <a href="Protection%20of%20Military%20Remains%20Act">Protection of Military Remains Act</a> of 1986.

In 2012, the British Government gave permission for Mearns to return to the site of "Hood"s final resting place to retrieve one of her two ship's bells which were lying in a small open debris field some way from the wreck herself. With the backing of the HMS "Hood" Association, Mearns planned to return the bell to Portsmouth where it would form part of the first official and permanent memorial to the sacrifice of her last crew at the newly refitted <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20the%20Royal%20Navy">National Museum of the Royal Navy</a>.

The expedition also took the opportunity to re-film the wreck and survey her using techniques unavailable in 2001. As before, with the exception of the attempted retrieval of the ship's bell, a strict look-but-don't-touch policy was adhered to. The original attempt, sponsored by <a href="Paul%20Allen">Paul Allen</a> and using his yacht <a href="Octopus%20%28yacht%29">"Octopus"</a>, was abandoned after ten days in September 2012 due to unfavourable weather conditions. In 2015, the same team attempted a second recovery operation and "Hood"s bell was finally retrieved on 7 August 2015. After conservation work, it was put on display in the museum in May 2016.

The recovered bell was originally carried on the <a href="predreadnought">predreadnought</a> battleship . Before being installed on the battlecruiser, the bell was inscribed around its base with the words: "This bell was preserved from HMS Hood battleship 1891-1914 by the late Rear Admiral, The Honourable Sir Horace Hood KCB, DSO, MVO killed at Jutland on 31st May 1916." There is a second inscription on the side of the bell that reads "In accordance with the wishes of Lady Hood it was presented in memory of her husband to HMS Hood battle cruiser the ship she launched 22nd August 1918." In addition to the two inscriptions, the bell still wears vivid royal blue paint work on its crown as well as its interior.

Some relics from the time of "Hood"s sinking still exist. A large fragment of the wooden <a href="Transom%20%28nautical%29">transom</a> from one of "Hood"s boats was washed up in Norway after her loss and is preserved in the <a href="National%20Maritime%20Museum">National Maritime Museum</a> in London. A metal container holding administrative papers was discovered washed ashore on the Norwegian <a href="Senja%20%28island%29">island of Senja</a> in April 1942, almost a year after the Battle of the Denmark Strait. The container and its contents were subsequently lost, but its lid survived and was eventually presented to the Royal Navy shore establishment HMS "Centurion" in 1981.

Other surviving relics are items that were removed from the ship prior to her sinking:

Two of "Hood"s <a href="BL%205.5%20inch%20Mark%20I%20naval%20gun">5.5-inch guns</a> were removed and replaced during a refit in 1935, and shipped to <a href="Ascension%20Island">Ascension Island</a>, where they were installed as a shore battery in 1941, sited on a hill above the port and main settlement, <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Ascension%20Island">Georgetown</a>, where they remain. The guns were restored by the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> in 1984.

The Ascension Island guns saw action only once, on 9 December 1941, when they fired on the German <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a> , as it approached Georgetown on the surface to shell the cable station or sink any ships at anchor. No hits were scored, but the submarine crash-dived.

As a result of a collision off the coast of Spain on 23 January 1935, one of "Hood"s propellers struck the bow of "Renown". While dry-docked for repairs, "Renown" had fragments of this propeller removed from her bilge section. The pieces of the propeller were kept by dockyard workers: ""Hood" v "Renown" Jan. 23rd. 1935" was stamped on one surviving example, and ""Hood V Renown off Arosa 23–1–35"" on another. Of the known surviving pieces, one is privately held and another was given by the Hood family to the "Hood" Association in 2006. Recently a third piece has come to light in Glasgow, where the "Hood" was built. It is held by a private collector and stamped "HMS HOOD v HMS RENOWN 23 1 35".

Sissinghurst Castle Garden

Sissinghurst Castle Garden, at <a href="Sissinghurst">Sissinghurst</a> in the <a href="Weald">Weald</a> of <a href="Kent">Kent</a> in England, was created by <a href="Vita%20Sackville-West">Vita Sackville-West</a>, poet and writer, and her husband <a href="Harold%20Nicolson">Harold Nicolson</a>, author and diplomat. It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a>'s <a href="Register%20of%20Historic%20Parks%20and%20Gardens%20of%20Special%20Historic%20Interest%20in%20England">register of historic parks and gardens</a>. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of "squalor and slovenly disorder" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was gifted to the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty</a>. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017.

The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of <a href="Garden%20roses%23Old%20garden%20roses">old garden roses</a>. The writer <a href="Anne%20Scott-James">Anne Scott-James</a> considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be "one of the finest collections in the world". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The <a href="garden%20design">garden design</a> is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed "garden rooms", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual "garden rooms", the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist <a href="Tony%20Lord">Tony Lord</a> describing it as "the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type."

The site of Sissinghurst is ancient and has been occupied since at least the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. The present-day buildings began as a house built in the 1530s by <a href="John%20Baker%20%28died%201558%29">Sir John Baker</a>. In 1554 Sir John's daughter Cecily married <a href="Thomas%20Sackville%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Dorset">Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset</a>, an ancestor of Vita Sackville-West. By the 18th century the Baker's fortunes had waned, and the house, renamed Sissinghurst Castle, was leased to the government to act as a prisoner-of-war camp during the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>. The prisoners caused great damage and by the 19th century much of Sir Richard's house had been demolished. In the mid-19th century, the remaining buildings were in use as a <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a>, and by the 20th century Sissinghurst had declined to the status of a farmstead. In 1928 the castle was advertised for sale but remained unsold for two years.

Sackville-West was born in 1892 at <a href="Knole">Knole</a>, the ancestral home of the <a href="Duke%20of%20Dorset">Sackvilles</a>. But for her sex, Sackville-West would have inherited Knole on the death of her father in 1928. Instead, following <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a>, the house and the title passed to her uncle, a loss she felt deeply. In 1930, after she and Nicolson became concerned that their home <a href="Long%20Barn">Long Barn</a> was threatened by development, Sackville-West bought Sissinghurst Castle. On purchasing Sissinghurst, Sackville-West and Nicolson inherited little more than some oak and nut trees, a <a href="quince">quince</a>, and a single old rose. Sackville-West planted the <a href="Garden%20roses%23Noisette">noisette</a> rose 'Madame Alfred Carrière' on the south face of the South Cottage even before the deeds to the property had been signed. Nicolson was largely responsible for planning the garden design, while Sackville-West undertook the planting. Over the next thirty years, working with her head gardeners, she cultivated some two hundred varieties of roses and large numbers of other flowers and shrubs. Decades after Sackville-West and Nicolson created "a garden where none was", Sissinghurst remains a major influence on <a href="Horticulture">horticultural</a> thought and practice.

The site is ancient; "hurst" is the <a href="Saxons">Saxon</a> term for an enclosed wood. <a href="Nigel%20Nicolson">Nigel Nicolson</a>, in his 1964 guide, "Sissinghurst Castle: An Illustrated History", records the earliest owners as the de Saxinhersts. Stephen de Saxinherst is named in an 1180 charter about the nearby <a href="Combwell%20Priory">Combwell Priory</a>. At the end of the 13th century the estate had passed, through marriage, to the de Berhams. Nicolson suggested that the de Berhams constructed a moated house in stone, of an appearance similar to that of <a href="Ightham%20Mote">Ightham Mote</a>, which was later replaced by a brick manor. More recent studies, including those of Nicolson's son, <a href="Adam%20Nicolson">Adam</a>, cast doubt on the existence of an earlier stone manor, suggesting instead that the brick house, or perhaps a timber construction of a slightly earlier date, occupying the corner of the orchard nearest the moat, was the earliest house on the site. <a href="Edward%20I">Edward I</a> is reputed to have stayed at this house in 1305.

In 1490 the de Berhams sold the manor of Sissinghurst to Thomas Baker of <a href="Cranbrook%2C%20Kent">Cranbrook</a>. The Bakers were cloth producers and in the following century, through marriage and careers at court and in the law, Thomas's successors greatly expanded their wealth and their estates in Kent and <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>. In the 1530s Sir John Baker, one of <a href="Henry%20VIII">Henry VIII</a>'s <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Councillors</a>, built a new brick gatehouse, the current West Range. In 1554 Sir John's daughter Cecily married Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, creating the earliest connection between the Sackville family and the house. Sir John's son Richard undertook a massive <a href="Prodigy%20house">prodigy expansion</a> in the 1560s. The Tower is part of that expansion, and formed the entrance to a very large courtyard house, of which the South Cottage and some walls are the only other remaining fragments. Sir Richard surrounded the mansion with an enclosed <a href="Deer%20park%20%28England%29">deer park</a> and in August 1573 entertained <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20I">Queen Elizabeth I</a> at Sissinghurst. 

After the collapse of the Baker family fortunes following the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> (1642–1651), the building declined in importance. <a href="Horace%20Walpole">Horace Walpole</a> visited in 1752: "yesterday, after twenty mishaps, we got to Sissinghurst for dinner. There is a park in ruins and a house in ten times greater ruins." During the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>, it became a prisoner-of-war camp. The historian <a href="Edward%20Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a>, then serving in the <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> <a href="militia">militia</a>, was stationed there and recorded "the inconceivable dirtiness of the season, the country and the spot". It was during its use as a camp for French prisoners that the name Sissinghurst Castle was adopted; although it was never a castle, there is debate as to the extent to which the house was a fortified manor. In 2018 an important collection of historical <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a> drawn by some of the 3,000 prisoners was uncovered beneath 20th-century plaster.
Around 1800, the estate was purchased by the <a href="Sir%20Horatio%20Mann%2C%202nd%20Baronet">Mann family</a> and the majority of Sir Richard's <a href="Elizabethan%20era">Elizabethan</a> house was demolished; the stone and brick were reused in buildings throughout the locality. The castle later became a workhouse for the Cranbrook Union, after which it housed farm labourers. In 1928, the castle was put up for sale for a price of £12,000, but attracted no bids for two years.

Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a>, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover <a href="Violet%20Trefusis">Violet Trefusis</a> in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like "to live alone in a tower with her books", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. 
From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, "Some Flowers", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: "I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed." In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, "bending some stubborn acres to my will", she was awarded the <a href="Royal%20Horticultural%20Society">Royal Horticultural Society</a>'s <a href="Veitch%20Memorial%20Medal">Veitch Medal</a>. Her biographer <a href="Victoria%20Glendinning">Victoria Glendinning</a> considers Sissinghurst to be Sackville-West's "one magnificent act of creation".

Harold Nicolson, diplomat, author, diarist, and politician, was born in <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a> on 21 September 1886. Following his father into the diplomatic corps, he served as a junior member of the British delegation at the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919">Paris Peace Conference</a> at the end of the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, and returned to Iran as Counsellor in 1925. In 1929 he resigned from the <a href="Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office">Foreign Office</a> to pursue a career in journalism, editing the "<a href="Londoner%27s%20Diary">Londoner's Diary</a>" for <a href="Max%20Aitken%2C%201st%20Baron%20Beaverbrook">Lord Beaverbrook's</a> "<a href="Evening%20Standard">Evening Standard</a>". This proved unsuccessful, as did his subsequent political career, which saw him move from <a href="Oswald%20Mosley">Oswald Mosley's</a> <a href="New%20Party%20%28UK%29">New Party</a> to <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee's</a> <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>. Throughout, he maintained a detailed private diary. His entry for 4 April 1930, records, "Vita telephones to say she has seen the ideal house – a place in Kent, near Cranbrook, a sixteenth-century castle".

Sackville-West and Nicolson found Sissinghurst in April 1930, after <a href="Dorothy%20Wellesley%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Wellington">Dorothy Wellesley</a>, their near neighbour and a former lover of Sackville-West's, saw the estate for sale. They had become increasingly concerned about encroaching development near their property <a href="Long%20Barn">Long Barn</a>, near <a href="Sevenoaks">Sevenoaks</a>, Kent. Their offer on Sissinghurst was accepted on 6 May and the castle and the farm around it were bought for £12,375, using only Sackville-West's money rather than Nicolson's. The property was in total. The house had no electricity, running water, or drains, and the garden was in disarray. Anne Scott-James notes their "planting inheritance" as "a grove of nut-trees, some apple trees, a <a href="quince">quince</a> [and] a tangle of [old roses]". The physical assets on the site were "four buildings of beautiful mellow brick, part of a moat [and] various fine walls". Clearing the ground took almost three years, but by 1939 the garden was largely complete, with the exception of the White Garden. Nicolson was responsible for the design and layout, while Sackville-West, at the head of her team of gardeners, undertook the planting. <a href="Simon%20Jenkins">Simon Jenkins</a>, the architectural writer, describes Nicolson's design as "post-Picturesque, a garden not as an imitation of nature but as imitation of a house", and suggests his thinking was much influenced by <a href="Lawrence%20Johnston">Lawrence Johnston</a>'s garden at <a href="Hidcote%20Manor%20Garden">Hidcote</a>. Sackville-West's approach was plant-centred, within the constraints of her husband's plan, "profusion, even extravagance and exuberance, within confines of the utmost linear severity".

The buildings scattered around the site were converted to become an unconventional home. Part of the long brick gatehouse range from Sir John Baker's construction of c.1533 became the library, or Big Room; the tower gatehouse dating from Richard Baker's rebuilding in 1560–1570 became Sackville-West's sitting room, study, and sanctuary. The Priest's House was home to their sons <a href="Benedict%20Nicolson">Ben</a> and Nigel, and held the family dining room, while the South Cottage housed their bedrooms and Nicolson's writing room.

The garden was first opened to the paying public for two days in mid-1938. Thereafter, the opening hours were gradually increased. Despite her love of privacy, Sackville-West came to enjoy greatly her encounters with the visitors, known as "shillingses" on account of the entrance fees they deposited in a bowl at the gate. She described her relationship with them in a 1939 article in the "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>": "between them and myself a particular form of courtesy survives, a gardener's courtesy". Nicolson was less welcoming. Sackville-West's "Observer" articles raised awareness of the garden; Scott-James records photographic articles in "<a href="The%20Gardeners%27%20Chronicle">Gardening Illustrated</a>," "<a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>", and "<a href="Picture%20Post">Picture Post</a>", and notes consequently that "increasingly paying visitors poured into Sissinghurst, coming in thousands in the course of a summer".

Nicolson's diary entry for 26 September 1938 records the tense European atmosphere at the time of the <a href="Munich%20Agreement">Munich Crisis</a>. "They are making the big room at Sissinghurst gas-proof. I know one who will not be there. He will be in his bed minus gas-mask and with all the windows open." He drove down to Sissinghurst on the day war was declared, encountering an angry woman who shook her fist at him while declaring that the war was the fault of the rich. He found on his arrival at the castle that the Sackville flag had been lowered from the tower. During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, Sissinghurst saw much of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a>, which was mainly fought over the Weald and the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>. Nicolson's diary entry for 2 September 1940 reads: "a tremendous raid in the morning and the whole upper air buzzes and zooms with the noise of aeroplanes. There are many fights over our sunlight fields".

In 1956, the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> proposed making a television programme at Sissinghurst. Although Sackville-West was in favour, Nicolson was opposed. "I have a vague prejudice against (a) exposing my intimate affections to the public gaze; (b) indulging in private theatricals." He later withdrew his objections, but Sackville-West declined the BBC's offer in order to please him. In 1959 the American <a href="CBS">CBS</a> network broadcast a four-way discussion from the dining room at the Priest's House, between Nicolson, the journalist <a href="Edward%20R.%20Murrow">Edward R. Murrow</a>, and the diplomats <a href="Charles%20E.%20Bohlen">Chip Bohlen</a> and <a href="Clare%20Boothe%20Luce">Clare Boothe Luce</a>. Sackville-West intensely disliked the result. 

Sackville-West died in the first-floor bedroom of the Priest's House on 2 June 1962. Nicolson recorded her death in his diary: "Ursula is with Vita. At about 1.5 she observes that Vita is breathing heavily, and then suddenly is silent. She dies without fear or self-reproach. I pick some of her favourite flowers and lay them on her bed". Her death devastated Nicolson and his last years were not happy. Giving up his <a href="Albany%20%28London%29">Albany</a> apartment in May 1965, he retired to Sissinghurst and thereafter he never stayed anywhere else. He died of a heart attack in his bedroom at the South Cottage on 1 May 1968.

Nigel Nicolson had always been devoted to his father, and admiring of his more distant mother. Preserving Sissinghurst was "an act of intense filial duty". He had first raised the possibility of giving the house and garden to the National Trust in 1954, but Sackville-West was adamantly opposed. After her death in 1962, which saw the castle pass to him although Benedict was the elder son, he began lengthy negotiations to bring about the handover. The Trust was cautious: it felt that an endowment beyond the Nicolsons' means would be required, and it was also unsure that the garden was of sufficient importance to warrant acceptance. <a href="George%20Taylor%20%28botanist%29">Sir George Taylor</a>, Chairman of the National Trust's Gardens Committee doubted it was "one of the great gardens of England", and had to be persuaded of its merits by Sackville-West's close friend and one-time lover, the gardener <a href="Alvilde%20Lees-Milne">Alvilde Lees-Milne</a>. Discussions continued until, in April 1967, the castle, garden, and Sissinghurst Farm were finally accepted.

Although always intending to transfer Sissinghurst to the Trust, Nigel Nicolson undertook major remodelling at the castle. Unwilling to live in four separate structures – the Big Room, the Tower, the Priest's House, and the South Cottage – he built a substantial family home in the half of the entrance range that stood on the side of the gateway opposite from the library. He died at the castle on 23 September 2004.

The National Trust took over the whole of Sissinghurst – its garden, farm, and buildings – in 1967. Since then, the number of visitors has steadily increased. <a href="Anne%20Scott-James">Anne Scott-James</a>, the author of the first non-Nicolson history of the garden, records 13,200 visitors in 1961, the year of Sackville-West's death, 47,100 in 1967, when the castle passed to the Trust, and 91,584 by 1973. It is now among the Trust's most popular properties, receiving nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. Although the increased foot traffic has necessitated the replacement of the grass paths with York paving stones, the entry fees generate considerable income which, under the terms of the handover, can only be expended on Sissinghurst. In 2008, Adam Nicholson described the estate as "better funded than it has been since the 16th century". Major works of reconstruction, such as the restoration of the Tower brickwork, and the cataloguing and conservation of the collection of books in the library, have been made possible by the availability of these funds. 

The property has an iconic status in <a href="LGBT">LGBTQ</a> culture; Adam Nicolson has noted "rivers of lesbians coming through the gate" each spring. The castle was one of the sites chosen in 2017 as a focus for the celebration of the LGBTQ history of Trust buildings. In the same year, the Trust opened the South Cottage to visitors for the first time. the gardens are open to the public daily from 7 March to 31 October.

Adam Nicolson, Nigel's son and the resident donor after his father's death, and his wife <a href="Sarah%20Raven">Sarah Raven</a>, have sought to restore a form of traditional <a href="Weald%20of%20Kent">Wealden</a> agriculture to Sissinghurst Farm. Their work to reunite the garden with its wider landscape is described in Adam's 2008 book, "Sissinghurst: An Unfinished History", which won the <a href="Ondaatje%20Prize">Ondaatje Prize</a>, and was the subject of a <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> documentary, "Sissinghurst", in 2009. Their efforts have generated some controversy, reflecting the tension between the demands of traditional agricultural practices and the requirements of a major tourism destination in the 21st century.

The site is a Grade I <a href="registered%20garden">registered garden</a>, and many other structures within the garden are <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>s in their own right.

The West Range forms part of Sir John Baker's original house of the 1530s. Sackville-West and Nicolson enlisted architect <a href="Albert%20Powys">A.R. Powys</a> to help convert the stables into a library, known as the Big Room and containing an important literary collection. The room as a whole is a recreation of Knole, "Vita's record of her disinheritance". Powys provided most of the architectural input into the conversion of the buildings at Sissinghurst, including the Priest's House and the South Cottage, as well as occasionally advising on elements of the design of the gardens. 

The range is of brick and of two storeys, with attics and decorated gables and chimneys. The wing to the south was converted into a family home by Nigel Nicolson. The <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> of the <a href="Baron%20Carnock">Carnocks</a> above the entrance archway was brought to Sissinghurst by Nicolson. The West Range has a Grade I listing.

The Tower is of brick and was the entrance to the <a href="cour%20d%27honneur">cour d'honneur</a> of the 1560s rebuilding. Of four storeys, it has recessed staircase turrets to each side, creating what the architectural historian <a href="Mark%20Girouard">Mark Girouard</a> described as an "extraordinarily slender and elegant" appearance. The courtyard was open on the tower side, its three facades containing seven <a href="Classical%20architecture">classical</a> doorways. Girouard notes Horace Walpole's observation of 1752, "perfect and very beautiful". Such an arrangement of a three-sided courtyard with a prominent gatehouse set some way in front became popular from Elizabethan times, similar examples being <a href="Rushton%20Hall">Rushton Hall</a> and the original <a href="Lanhydrock">Lanhydrock</a>. 

The Tower was Sackville-West's sanctum; her study was out of bounds to all but her dogs and a small number of guests by invitation. Her writing room is maintained largely as it was at the time of her death. Nigel Nicolson records his discovery in the Tower of his mother's manuscript describing her affair with Violet Trefusis. This went on to form the basis of his book "Portrait of a Marriage". The clock, below the Tower parapet, was installed in 1949. A plaque is affixed to the arch of the Tower; the words were chosen by Harold Nicolson: "Here lived V. Sackville-West who made this garden". Nigel Nicolson always felt that the memorial failed to acknowledge his father's contribution. The Tower has a Grade I listing.

The architectural historian <a href="John%20Newman%20%28architectural%20historian%29">John Newman</a> suggests that this building was a "viewing pavilion or lodge". Its name derives from the tradition that it was used to house a Catholic priest, the Baker family having been Catholic adherents. Sackville-West and Nicolson converted the cottage to provide accommodation for their sons, and the family kitchen and dining room. Of red brick and two storeys, Historic England suggests that the building may originally have been attached to Sir Richard Baker's 1560s house but Newman disagrees.

This building formed the southeast corner of the courtyard enclosure buildings. It was restored by Beale & Son, builders from <a href="Royal%20Tunbridge%20Wells">Tunbridge Wells</a>, and provided the pair with separate bedrooms, a shared sitting room, and Nicolson's writing room. His diary entry for 20 April 1933 records: "My new wing has been done. The sitting room is lovely ... My bedroom, <a href="Flush%20toilet">w.c.</a> and bathroom are divine". Of two storeys in red brick, with an extension dating from the 1930s, South Cottage has a Grade II* listing.

Although the estate as a whole is , the gardens themselves occupy only . Anne Scott-James sets out the principles of the design: "a garden of formal structure, of a private and secret nature, truly English in character, and plant[ed] with romantic profusion". As gardeners and landscapers, both Sackville-West and Nicolson were amateurs. Nicolson largely undertook the design and Sackville-West the planting. The landscape is designed as a series of "garden rooms", each with a different character of colour or theme, the enclosures being high clipped hedges and pink brick walls. The rooms and "doors" are so arranged as to offer glimpses into other parts of the garden. 

Sackville-West described the overall design: "a combination of long axial walks, usually with terminal points, and the more intimate surprise of small geometrical gardens opening off them, rather as the rooms of an enormous house would open off the corridors". Nicolson considered the garden's success was down to this "succession of privacies: the forecourt, the first arch, the main court, the tower arch, the lawn, the orchard. All a series of escapes from the world, giving the impression of cumulative escape". In the White Garden and along some paths in other gardens, the flower beds were set off from the paths by closely clipped low square hedges of <a href="Buxus">box</a>.
Sackville-West's planting philosophy is summed up in the advice from one of her gardening columns in the "Observer": "Cram, cram, cram, every chink and cranny". Gardener Sarah Raven (Adam Nicolson's wife) notes the use of the vertical dimension, as well as horizontal paths, in her planting. Assisted by the number of walls still standing from the <a href="Tudor%20period">Tudor</a> manor, and constructing more of her own, Sackville-West remarked "I see we are going to have heaps of wall space for climbing things." 

Old roses formed the centrepiece of the planting, and their history appealed to her as much as their appearance did: "there is nothing scrimpy or stingy about them. They have a generosity which is as desirable in plants as in people", and ultimately around 200 varieties were grown at Sissinghurst.

<a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Edwin Lutyens</a>, long-time gardening partner of <a href="Gertrude%20Jekyll">Gertrude Jekyll</a>, was a friend to both Sackville-West and Nicolson and a frequent visitor to Long Barn, and gave advice regarding Sissinghurst. Sackville-West denied that Jekyll's work had an impact on her own designs, but Nigel Nicolson described Lutyens' influence as "pervasive". Fleming and Gore go further, suggesting that the use of groupings of colours "followed Jekyll"; "a purple border, a cottage garden in red, orange and yellow, a walled garden pink [and] purple, a white garden, a herb garden". Scott-James notes however that <a href="herbaceous%20borders">herbaceous borders</a>, "Jekyll's speciality", were much disliked by Sackville-West. Other influencers and friends were the noted plantswoman <a href="Norah%20Lindsay">Norah Lindsay</a>, the plant collector <a href="Collingwood%20Ingram">Collingwood Ingram</a>, who was their neighbour at <a href="Benenden">Benenden</a>, and Reginald Cooper, one of Nicolson's closest friends, whose earlier garden at <a href="Cothay%20Manor">Cothay Manor</a> in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a> has been described as the "Sissinghurst of the West Country". Sackville-West's considerable knowledge of old roses was deepened by her friendship with <a href="Edward%20Bunyard">Edward Bunyard</a>, plantsman, epicure, and the author of "Old Garden Roses", who was a frequent visitor. The historian Peter Davey places the garden at the very end of a tradition of <a href="Arts%20and%20Crafts%20movement">Arts and Crafts gardening</a> which by the 1930s, in the face of changes in "taste and economics", had almost come to its close.
The concept of "garden rooms" has been dated to the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>, who included rooms within some homes that opened on one side onto a garden. The horticultural scholar and gardener <a href="Marie-Luise%20Gothein">Marie-Luise Gothein</a> identified such a room at <a href="Pliny%20the%20Younger">Pliny's</a> Villa Tusci, in her study "A History of Garden Art". In the late 19th century, reaction set in against both the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> fashion for elaborate <a href="Bedding%20%28horticulture%29">bedding</a> and <a href="Italianate%20architecture">Italianate</a> formality, and the earlier 18th century <a href="English%20landscape%20garden">landscape gardening</a> modelled on the paintings of <a href="Claude%20Lorrain">Claude Lorrain</a> and <a href="Nicolas%20Poussin">Nicolas Poussin</a>. This led in part to a concept of the "garden room" (distinct from the architectural concept of a <a href="sunroom">garden room</a>) as a space out of doors, in which paths, corresponding to halls in a house, lead to enclosed gardens within the garden as a whole, conceived of as rooms. The architect <a href="Hermann%20Muthesius">Hermann Muthesius</a> described the style which developed into the Arts and Crafts approach in his "" ("<a href="The%20English%20House">The English House</a>"): "the garden is seen as a continuation of the rooms of the house, almost a series of ... outdoor rooms, each of which is self-contained". A number of pre-Sissinghurst gardeners, including Jekyll and Lawrence Johnston, had designed in this style, and much of their work was known to Sackville-West and Nicolson. This landscaping feature has since become an established one in garden design.

Many of the gardening themes developed at Sissinghurst were conceived during Sackville-West's and Nicolson's time at Long Barn: the prominence of roses, the emphasis on "rectilinear perspectives" through axial paths, and an informal, massed planting approach. Jane Brown suggests that "without Long Barn there would have been no Sissinghurst."

John Vass, appointed head gardener in 1939, left in 1957. Called up to the <a href="RAF">RAF</a> in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 <a href="Pamela%20Schwerdt">Pamela Schwerdt</a> and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, "as much, if not more than Vita's, 
mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England". In 2006 they were awarded the <a href="Royal%20Horticultural%20Society">Royal Horticultural Society's</a> <a href="Victoria%20Medal%20of%20Honour">Victoria Medal of Honour</a> for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta. 

In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at <a href="Bodnant%20Garden">Bodnant</a>, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden "in the manner of its creator, after they have gone". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic <a href="Tim%20Richardson%20%28writer%29">Tim Richardson</a>, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: "Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a "Mecca" and a "place of pilgrimage" for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators.

Entered through the archway in the West Range, that had been blocked for over 100 years before Sackville-West and Nicolson's arrival, the Top Courtyard is dominated by the Tower. Planted against a new wall constructed on ancient foundations is the Purple Border, a colour palette deliberately chosen by Sackville-West in defiance of Gertrude Jekyll's dictum against massing purple flowers. The gardening writer <a href="Tony%20Lord">Tony Lord</a> considers it "the courtyard's greatest glory". The height of the Tower attracts considerable wind which necessitates intensive staking of the plants, particularly the taller specimens such as Sackville-West's much-favoured "<a href="Rosa%20moyesii">Rosa moyesii</a>". On the opposite side of the Tower is the Tower Lawn, also known as the Lower Courtyard; Nicolson emphasised that "the English lawn is the basis of our garden design". The west-east vista from the Top Courtyard, through the Tower gateway, across the Tower Lawn, and to the statue of Dionysus across the moat, forms one of the most important horizontal axes. It bisects the north-south axis running from the White Garden, across the Tower Lawn, to the Roundel in the Rose Garden. In the southwestern corner of the Tower Lawn is a small garden known as the Sunk Garden. It was created in 1930 as the Lion Pond, but the pond was prone to leaking and was drained in 1939. The site was subsequently considered for planting what became the White Garden, but was ultimately rejected as too confined, shady, and damp. The Trust is considering reinstatement of the pool.

"A symphony in subtle shades of white and green", the White Garden is considered the "most renowned" and most influential of all of Sissinghurst's garden rooms. Planned before the war, it was completed in the winter of 1949–1950. Using a palette of white, silver, grey, and green, it has been called "one of Vita and Harold's most beautiful and romantic visions". Sackville-West recorded her original inspiration in a letter to Nicolson dated 12 December 1939: "I have got what I hope will be a lovely scheme for it: all white flowers, with some clumps of very pale pink". The concept of single-colour gardens had enjoyed some popularity at the end of the 19th century, but few such gardens remained when Sissinghurst was designed. Influences for the White Garden include <a href="Hidcote%20Manor%20Garden">Hidcote</a> and Phyllis Reiss's garden at <a href="Tintinhull%20Garden">Tintinhull</a>, both of which Vita had seen. Gertrude Jekyll had discussed the concept, but argued for varying the white palette with the use of blue or yellow plants, advice followed by Reiss. But neither Hidcote nor Tintinhull equals the "full-scale symphony" of the White Garden at Sissinghurst. A more prosaic motivation for the colour scheme was to provide reflected illumination for Sackville-West and Nicolson as they made their way from their bedrooms at the South Cottage to the Priest's House for dinner.

The focal point of the garden was originally four almond trees, encased in a canopy of the white rose, <a href="List%20of%20Rosa%20species">"Rosa mulliganii"</a>. By the 1960s, the weight of the roses had severely weakened the trees, and they were replaced with an iron <a href="arbor%20%28garden%29">arbour</a> designed by Nigel Nicolson. Beneath the arbour is sited a <a href="Ming%20dynasty">Ming dynasty</a> vase bought in Cairo. A lead statue of a <a href="Vestal%20Virgin">Vestal Virgin</a>, cast by <a href="Toma%20Rosandi%C4%87">Toma Rosandić</a> from the wooden original which is in the Big Room, presides over the garden. Sackville-West intended that the statue should be enveloped by a weeping pear tree, "<a href="Pyrus%20salicifolia">Pyrus salicifolia</a>" 'Pendula', and the present tree was planted after her original was destroyed in the <a href="Great%20Storm%20of%201987">Great Storm of 1987</a>. Lord considers the White Garden "the most ambitious and successful of its time, the most entrancing of its type".

A possibly apocryphal story records a visit by the colour-loving gardener <a href="Christopher%20Lloyd%20%28gardener%29">Christopher Lloyd</a>, during which he is supposed to have scattered seeds of brightly coloured <a href="Tropaeolum">nasturtiums</a> across the lawn. Troy Scott Smith, the current head gardener, is undertaking a major research project on the history of the White Garden with the intention of recreating the original planting scheme in its entirety. This project has seen the number of plants being propagated in the Sissinghurst nursery rise from 400 to over 530.

The Rose Garden was constructed on the site of the old kitchen garden from 1937. It terminates the north-south axis running from the White Garden and concludes with a brick wall, designed by A. R. Powys and known as the Powys Wall, constructed in 1935. <a href="Garden%20roses%23Old%20garden%20roses">Old garden roses</a>, those bred before 1867, formed the heart of the garden's planting. Such roses appealed not only for their lavish appearance, but also for their history. The informal and unstructured massing of the plants was Sackville-West's deliberate choice, and has become one of Sissinghurst's defining features. Roses were supplied by, among others, <a href="Hilda%20Murrell">Hilda Murrell</a> of Edwin Murrell Ltd., notable rose growers in <a href="Shropshire">Shropshire</a>, and the florist <a href="Constance%20Spry">Constance Spry</a> from her home <a href="Winkfield">Winkfield Place</a>. In addition to using established suppliers and receiving plants as gifts from friends, Sackville-West sometimes sourced specimens herself. Sarah Raven records Sackville-West digging up the <a href="Garden%20roses%23Hybrid%20perpetual">hybrid perpetual rose</a> 'Souvenir du Docteur Jamain' at an old nursery; Anne Scott-James noted that the rose had passed out of commerce and it was Sackville-West who returned it to cultivation. The Rose Garden is divided by the Roundel, constructed of yew hedging by Nicolson and Nigel in 1933. As elsewhere in the garden, the Trust has replaced the original grass paths with stone and brick, to cope with the increases in visitor numbers. Scott-James considered the roses in the Rose Garden "one of the finest collections in the world". The writer Jane Brown describes the Rose Garden, more than any other including the White, as expressing "the essence of Vita's gardening personality, just as her writing-room enshrines her poetic ghost".

Delos, between the Priest's House and the courtyard wall, was the one area of the garden that neither Sackville-West nor Nicolson considered a success. She explained its origins in an article in <a href="Country%20Life%20%28magazine%29">"Country Life"</a> in 1942 as being inspired by the terraced ruins covered with wild flowers she had observed on the island of <a href="Delos">Delos</a>. Neither the shade nor the soil, nor its inter-relationships with other parts of the garden, have proved satisfactory, either in the Nicolson's time or subsequently. The <a href="Erechtheion">Erechtheum</a>, named after one of the temples at the <a href="Acropolis%20of%20Athens">Acropolis</a>, is a vine-covered <a href="loggia">loggia</a> and was used as a place for eating out of doors.

The dominating colours in the <a href="Cottage%20Garden">Cottage Garden</a> are hot saturated shades of red, orange, and yellow, a colour scheme that both Sackville-West and Nicolson claimed as their own conception. Lord considers it as much a traditional "cottage garden as <a href="Marie%20Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a> was a milkmaid". Here, as elsewhere, Sackville-West was much influenced by <a href="William%20Robinson%20%28gardener%29">William Robinson</a>, a gardener she greatly admired and who had done much to popularise the concept of the cottage garden. It contains four beds, surrounded by simple paths, with planting in colours that Sackville-West described as those of the sunset. Plants include a range of <a href="dahlias">dahlias</a>, a particular favourite of Nicolson's, and the <a href="Kniphofia">red-hot poker</a>, which he despised. In a 1937 letter to his wife he observed, "I think the secret of your gardening is simply that you have the courage to abolish ugly or unsuccessful flowers. Except for those beastly red-hot pokers which you have a weakness for, there is not an ugly flower in the whole place."

The Herb Garden contains <a href="Salvia%20officinalis">sage</a>, <a href="thyme">thyme</a>, <a href="hyssop">hyssop</a>, <a href="fennel">fennel</a> and an unusual seat built around a <a href="camomile">camomile</a> bush. Known to the family as <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor's</a> chair, it was constructed by Copper, the Nicolson's chauffeur. Originally laid out in the 1930s, the garden was revitalised by John Vass in the years immediately after the Second World War. The Lion Basin in the centre of the garden was brought back from Turkey in 1914. Most of the over one hundred herbs in the garden are now started in the nurseries and planted out at appropriate times of year.

The Lime Walk, also known as the Spring Garden, was the one part of Sissinghurst where Nicolson undertook the planting as well as the design. He had originally intended a single axis running straight from the Rose Garden, through the Cottage Garden, and then through the Nuttery to the moat, but the topography of the site precluded that. Instead, an angled walk was established in the mid-1930s, and substantially replanted in 1945–1962. Sackville-West was critical of the angularity of the design, comparing it to Platform 5 at <a href="Charing%20Cross%20railway%20station">Charing Cross station</a>, but treasured it as her husband's creation. "I walked down the Spring Garden and all your little flowers tore and bit at my heart. I do love you so, Hadji. It is quite simple: I do love you so. Just that." The <a href="Tilia">limes</a> are <a href="pleaching">pleached</a> and the dominant plant is <a href="Euphorbia%20epithymoides">"Euphorbia polychroma" 'Major'</a>. Nicolson kept meticulous gardening records of his efforts in the Lime Walk from 1947 to the late 1950s and, providing consolation after the end of his parliamentary career, he described the walk as "My Life's Work".

The Yew Walk runs parallel to the Tower Lawn. Its narrow width has been problematic, and by the late 1960s the yew hedges were failing. Extensive pruning proved successful in revitalising the avenue.

The Nuttery was famed for its carpet of <a href="Primula">polyanthus</a>. Nicolson called it "the loveliest planting scheme in the whole world". Unlike the other gardens, where flowering plants were placed within flower beds, in the Nuttery and the Orchard plants were allowed to spread across lawns as though they were growing in the wild. By the 1960s, the plants were dying, and attempts to improve the soil did not assist. The primrose carpet was replaced in the 1970s by a mixture of woodland flowers and grasses. 
The Moat Walk stands on the old bowling green constructed by Sir Richard Baker in the 1560s and his reconstructed moat wall provides the axis. The <a href="azaleas">azaleas</a> were bought with the £100 Heinemann prize Sackville-West received in 1946 for her last published poem, "The Land". The <a href="wisteria">wisteria</a> were a gift from her mother, <a href="Victoria%20Sackville-West%2C%20Baroness%20Sackville">Lady Sackville</a>, as were the six bronze vases. A bench designed by Lutyens terminates one end of the walk, the other focal point being the statue of Dionysus across the moat. The two sides of the moat that remain from the medieval house are populated by <a href="goldfish">goldfish</a>, <a href="Carp%23As%20ornamental%20fish">carp</a>, and <a href="Ide%20%28fish%29">golden orfe</a>.

The Orchard was an unproductive area of fruit trees when the Nicolsons arrived. The unplanned layout was retained as a contrast to the formality of most of the garden; the fruit trees were paired with climbing roses and the area provided space for the many gifts of plants and trees they received. The rose "<a href="Rosa%20filipes">Rosa filipes</a>" 'Kiftsgate', a present from Sackville-West's friend and fellow gardener Heather Muir of <a href="Kiftsgate%20Court%20Gardens">Kiftsgate Court</a>, is one example. This part of the garden suffered particularly severe losses in the <a href="Great%20Storm%20of%201987">Great Storm of 1987</a> and much replanting has taken place. The Orchard is the setting for two structures planned by Nigel Nicolson and commissioned in memory of his father: the boathouse and the gazebo. The gazebo, of 1969, is by Francis Pym and has a <a href="Candle%20snuffer">candlesnuffer</a> roof intended to evoke those of Kentish <a href="Oast%20house">oast houses</a>. The boathouse, of timber construction and with <a href="Tuscan%20order">Tuscan</a> <a href="colonnades">colonnades</a>, dates from 2002 and is by the local architectural firm <a href="Purcell%20%28architects%29">Purcell Miller Tritton</a>.

Tony Lord has noted that Sackville-West and Nicolson intended the gardens at Sissinghurst to be a source of personal enjoyment, rather than to be a public garden displaying rare plants. Aside from Sackville-West's interest in collecting and preserving rare varieties of old roses, the other garden plants were selected primarily for their abilities to look good and grow successfully in their intended planting sites, as opposed to assembling a collection of rare plants from around the world. Later, in the 1960s, Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger decided to propagate the most successful flowering plant varieties in order to offer them for sale and make them more easily available to amateur gardeners.

The collection of rose varieties at Sissinghurst is considered to be extraordinary as well as to encapsulate Sackville-West's approach to gardening. In 1953, John Vass counted 194 rose varieties on the property. A few modern rose varieties are included: the <a href="Floribunda%20%28rose%29">floribunda</a> rose <a href="Rosa%20Iceberg">'Iceberg'</a> is planted in the White Garden, having been supplied by Hilda Murrell to supplement plant losses after a hard winter following Sackville-West's death, and the bright scarlet <a href="Garden%20rose%23Climbing%20and%20rambling">climbing</a> <a href="Hybrid%20tea%20rose">hybrid tea</a> 'Allen Chandler' grows on each side of the entrance gate to the Top Courtyard.

The focus of Sackville-West's collection was, however, on <a href="List%20of%20Rosa%20species">species roses</a> and <a href="Garden%20roses%23Old%20garden%20roses">old garden varieties</a>. Sackville-West described her love of the old roses, saying that one should "discard the idea that roses must be limited to certain accepted and accustomed colours, and to welcome the less familiar purples and lilacs, and the striped, flaked, mottled variations which recall the old Dutch flower-paintings; to approach them, in fact, with open and unprejudiced eyes, and also with a nose that esteems the true scent of a rose warmed by the sun." She was especially fond of the <a href="Garden%20roses%23Bourbons">bourbon roses</a> 'Madame Isaac Péreire' and 'Madame Pierre Oger'. <a href="Graham%20Stuart%20Thomas">Graham Stuart Thomas</a>, who helped locate rose varieties for Sissinghurst and advised Sackville-West on the design of the Rose Garden, described 'Madame Isaac Péreire' as "[p]ossibly the most powerfully fragrant of all roses", and 'Madame Pierre Oger' as having a "formal perfection unique among roses".

When she first visited the property, Sackville-West came upon a dark red, <a href="double-flowered">double-flowered</a> form of "<a href="Rosa%20gallica">Rosa gallica</a>" growing wild and apparently dating from earlier plantings there. She eventually planted it in the Orchard, and it is now known as the <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a> 'Sissinghurst Castle'. In 1930, even before the deeds to the property had been signed, she planted the <a href="Garden%20roses%23Noisette">noisette</a> rose 'Madame Alfred Carrière' on the south face of the South Cottage, making it the first rose she would plant in the gardens.

In the Rose Garden itself, many roses were planted singly, but two deep pink varieties, the bourbon 'Madame Lauriol de Barny' and the <a href="Garden%20roses%23Damask">damask</a> 'La Ville de Bruxelles', were planted closely in groups of three and allowed to grow together, providing focal points on the left and right sides, respectively, of the garden.

In the White Garden, "Rosa mulliganii" is trained over an arbour to provide the centrepiece of the design. Several varieties are trained to climb up trees in the Orchard. These include <a href="Rosa%20%27Alb%C3%A9ric%20Barbier%27">'Albéric Barbier'</a>, described by Thomas as "a great favourite" among the hybrids of "<a href="Rosa%20wichuraiana">Rosa wichuraiana</a>". Another is 'Félicité et Perpétue', a "<a href="Rosa%20sempervirens">Rosa sempervirens</a>" hybrid that was named for the two daughters of the gardener to the <a href="Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Duke of Orléans</a> in 1827, who were, in turn, named after <a href="Passion%20of%20Saint%20Perpetua%2C%20Saint%20Felicitas%2C%20and%20their%20Companions">two saints</a>. A third is the noisette 'Madame Plantier', of which Sackville-West wrote: "I go out and look at her in the moonlight: she gleams, a pear-shaped ghost, contriving to look both matronly and virginal."

For the most part, Sackville-West and Nicolson simply kept the large trees that were already growing on the property, to serve as the major specimens. These included numerous ancient <a href="Quercus%20robur">oaks</a> that frame many of the individual gardens. The Orchard was made up of apple and pear trees that had been planted long before; Sackville-West and Nicolson decided to keep them and use them as supports for climbing roses. Similarly, the Nuttery consisted entirely of <a href="Corylus%20maxima">filberts</a> that appear to have been planted around 1900.
Some trees were added to the plantings, notably the limes of the Lime Walk. A bed of "<a href="Magnolia%20liliiflora">Magnolia liliiflora</a>" 'Nigra' is at the southern end of the Lower Courtyard, and some "<a href="Magnolia%20grandiflora">Magnolia grandiflora</a>" are on the walls of the Top Courtyard. A <a href="Erythrina%20crista-galli">coral tree</a> is in the Lower Courtyard. Some "<a href="Malus">Malus</a>" and "<a href="Prunus">Prunus</a>" in the Rose Garden died out, as have "<a href="Robinia%20pseudoacacia">Robinia pseudoacacia</a>", "<a href="Cercidiphyllum%20japonicum">Cercidiphyllum japonicum</a>", and "<a href="Koelreuteria%20paniculata">Koelreuteria paniculata</a>" in the Cottage Garden. A <a href="catalpa">catalpa</a> was planted as a focal point of the Lower Courtyard lawn in 1932, and Nicolson liked to sit beneath it and read, but it died in the 1960s.

<a href="Hedge">Hedge</a>s play a critical role in defining the "garden rooms". <a href="Taxus%20baccata">Yews</a>, <a href="hornbeams">hornbeams</a>, and box are each used in this way, clipped into formal square-edged rows of various heights. Yews are also pruned into vertical accents that mimic the shape of <a href="Cupressus%20sempervirens">Italian cypress</a>.

In addition to the 'Sissinghurst Castle' rose, multiple other flowering plants have been grown at Sissinghurst and given names honouring the property or the people associated with it. Sackville-West herself had low enthusiasm for naming plants in this way, and she and Nicolson actually dug up and discarded a rose that was named 'Lady Sackville' after her mother. There are numerous plants that have been given trade names based on the gardens, including "<a href="Tanacetum%20parthenium">Tanacetum parthenium</a>" 'Rowallane' which has often been mislabelled as 'Sissinghurst', but there are several that are grown at or were discovered at Sissinghurst and were named to reflect the association.

Sackville-West made an exception to her dislike of naming plants in memory of people and purchased <a href="Viola%20%28plant%29">"Viola"</a> 'Lady Sackville' late in her life, around 1960, planting it in the Delos. A few years after her death, a seedling appeared that seems to have been a spontaneous cross between 'Lady Sackville' and the variety 'Nellie Britton' that was growing alongside it. It had flowers of a rich pink that were larger than those of the parent varieties. The gardeners named it 'Vita'. Sackville-West had also grown a variety of <a href="rosemary">rosemary</a> ("Rosmarinus officinalis") that self-seeded in the Tower steps, and differed from the common variety in having upright rather than trailing stems, and flowers of a deeper shade of blue. It has come to be recognized as a distinct cultivar, and named 'Sissinghurst Blue'.
In 1969, a gardener in Kent bred a cultivar of <a href="Iris%20%28plant%29%23Bearded%20rhizome%20iris">dwarf bearded iris</a> with reddish-purple flowers. He gave a specimen to Sissinghurst, where it was planted in the Purple Border, and named "Iris" 'Sissinghurst'. During the 1970s, a pink-flowered specimen of "<a href="Glandularia">Glandularia</a>" ("<a href="Verbena">Verbena</a>") was given to the garden and named 'Sissinghurst'. In 1976, the garden was given a distinctive specimen of "<a href="Pulmonaria%20officinalis">Pulmonaria officinalis</a>" that, unlike the species, has large white flowers (along with the white-spotted leaves of the species). It was planted in the White Garden and named 'Sissinghurst White'. Around 1977, the gardeners purchased a collection of seedlings of "<a href="Thalictrum%20aquilegiifolium">Thalictrum aquilegiifolium</a>". They selected the best plant, having larger flowers, and propagated it. This plant was added to the White Garden and named 'White Cloud'. From a planting of "Penstemon" 'Evelyn', which is a selection of "<a href="Penstemon%20barbatus">Penstemon barbatus</a>", a specimen was named 'Sissinghurst Pink', although Lord does not consider it to be distinct from 'Evelyn'.

In the late 1980s, Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger found a specimen of "<a href="Phlox%20stolonifera">Phlox stolonifera</a>" with a remarkably rich purple colour in a florist's shop near the <a href="Chelsea%20Flower%20Show">Chelsea Flower Show</a>. They planted it in the Top Courtyard and named it 'Violet Vere' after Schwerdt's mother, who had been President of the <a href="Wild%20Flower%20Society%20%28UK%29">Wild Flower Society</a> and was celebrating her ninetieth birthday.

Ratanakiri Province

Ratanakiri (), officially Ratanak Kiri ( ), is a <a href="provinces%20of%20Cambodia">province</a> of northeast <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>. It borders the provinces of <a href="Mondulkiri%20Province">Mondulkiri</a> to the south and <a href="Stung%20Treng%20Province">Stung Treng</a> to the west and the countries of <a href="Laos">Laos</a> and <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> to the north and east, respectively. The province extends from the mountains of the <a href="Annamite%20Range">Annamite Range</a> in the north, across a hilly plateau between the <a href="Tonle%20San">Tonle San</a> and <a href="Tonle%20Srepok">Tonle Srepok</a> rivers, to tropical <a href="deciduous%20forests">deciduous forests</a> in the south. In recent years, logging and mining have scarred Ratanakiri's environment, long known for its beauty.

For over a millennium, Ratanakiri has been occupied by the highland <a href="Khmer%20Loeu">Khmer Loeu</a> people, who are a minority elsewhere in Cambodia. During the region's early history, its Khmer Loeu inhabitants were exploited as slaves by neighboring empires. The slave trade economy ended during the <a href="Colonial%20Cambodia">French colonial era</a>, but a harsh <a href="Khmer%20people">Khmerization</a> campaign after Cambodia's independence again threatened Khmer Loeu ways of life. The <a href="Khmer%20Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> built its headquarters in the province in the 1960s, and bombing during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> devastated the region. Today, rapid development in the province is altering traditional ways of life.

Ratanakiri is sparsely populated; its 184,000 residents make up just over 1% of the country's total population. Residents generally live in villages of 20 to 60 families and engage in subsistence <a href="shifting%20cultivation">shifting agriculture</a>. Ratanakiri is among the least developed provinces of Cambodia. Its infrastructure is poor, and the local government is weak. Health indicators in Ratanakiri are extremely poor; men's life expectancy is 39 years, and women's is 43 years. Education levels are also low, with just under half of the population illiterate.

Ratanakiri has been occupied since at least the <a href="stone%20age">Stone</a> or <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>, and trade between the region's highlanders and towns along the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Thailand">Gulf of Thailand</a> dates to at least the 4th century A.D. The region was invaded by <a href="History%20of%20Vietnam">Annamites</a>, the <a href="Champa">Cham</a>, the <a href="Khmer%20Empire">Khmer</a>, and the <a href="History%20of%20Thailand">Thai</a> during its early history, but no empire ever brought the area under centralized control. From the 13th century or earlier until the 19th century, highland villages were often raided by <a href="History%20of%20slavery%23Southeast%20Asia">Khmer, Lao, and Thai slave traders</a>. The region was conquered by local <a href="Laos">Laotian</a> rulers in the 18th century and then by the Thai in the 19th century. The area was incorporated into <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a> in 1893, and colonial rule replaced slave trading. The French built huge rubber plantations, especially in Labansiek (present-day <a href="Banlung">Banlung</a>); indigenous workers were used for construction and rubber harvesting. While under French control, the land comprising present-day Ratanakiri was transferred from Siam (<a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>) to Laos and then to Cambodia. Although highland groups initially resisted their colonial rulers, by the end of the colonial era in 1953 they had been subdued.

Ratanakiri Province was created in 1959 from land that had been the eastern area of <a href="Stung%20Treng%20Province">Stung Treng Province</a>. The name "Ratanakiri" (រតនគិរី) is formed from the <a href="Khmer%20language">Khmer</a> words រតនៈ ("ratana" "gem" from <a href="Sanskrit%20language">Sanskrit</a> "ratna") and គិរី ("kiri" "mountain" from Sanskrit "giri"), describing two features for which the province is known. During the 1950s and 1960s, <a href="Norodom%20Sihanouk">Norodom Sihanouk</a> instituted a development and Khmerization campaign in northeast Cambodia that was designed to bring villages under government control, limit the influence of insurgents in the area, and "modernize" indigenous communities. Some <a href="Khmer%20Loeu">Khmer Loeu</a> were forcibly moved to the lowlands to be educated in Khmer language and culture, ethnic <a href="Khmer%20people">Khmer</a> from elsewhere in Cambodia were moved into the province, and roads and large rubber plantations were built. After facing harsh working conditions and sometimes involuntary labor on the plantations, many Khmer Loeu left their traditional homes and moved farther from provincial towns. In 1968, tensions led to an uprising by the <a href="Brao">Brao</a> in which several Khmer were killed. The government responded harshly, torching settlements and killing hundreds of villagers.
In the 1960s, the ascendant <a href="Khmer%20Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> forged an alliance with ethnic minorities in Ratanakiri, exploiting Khmer Loeu resentment of the central government. The <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Kampuchea">Communist Party of Kampuchea</a> headquarters was moved to Ratanakiri in 1966, and hundreds of Khmer Loeu joined CPK units. During this period, there was also extensive <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>ese activity in Ratanakiri. Vietnamese <a href="communist">communist</a>s had operated in Ratanakiri since the 1940s; at a June 1969 press conference, Sihanouk said that Ratanakiri was "practically <a href="North%20Vietnamese">North Vietnamese</a> territory". Between March 1969 and May 1970, the United States undertook a massive <a href="Operation%20Menu">covert bombing campaign</a> in the region, aiming to disrupt sanctuaries for communist Vietnamese troops. Villagers were forced outside of main towns to escape the bombings, foraging for food and living on the run with the Khmer Rouge. In June 1970, the central government withdrew its troops from Ratanakiri, abandoning the area to Khmer Rouge control. The Khmer Rouge regime, which had not initially been harsh in Ratanakiri, became increasingly oppressive. The Khmer Loeu were forbidden from speaking their native languages or practicing their traditional customs and religion, which were seen as incompatible with communism. Communal living became compulsory, and the province's few schools were closed. Purges of ethnic minorities increased in frequency, and thousands of refugees fled to Vietnam and Laos. Preliminary studies indicate that bodies accounting for approximately 5% of Ratanakiri's residents were deposited in mass graves, a significantly lower rate than elsewhere in Cambodia.

After the <a href="Cambodian-Vietnamese%20War">Vietnamese defeated the Khmer Rouge</a> in 1979, government policy toward Ratanakiri became one of benign neglect. The Khmer Loeu were permitted to return to their traditional livelihoods, but the government provided little infrastructure in the province. Under the Vietnamese, there was little contact between the provincial government and many local communities. Long after the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime, however, Khmer Rouge rebels remained in the forests of Ratanakiri. Rebels largely surrendered their arms in the 1990s, though attacks along provincial roads continued until 2002.

Ratanakiri's recent history has been characterized by development and attendant challenges to traditional ways of life. The national government has built roads, encouraged tourism and agriculture, and facilitated rapid immigration of lowland Khmers into Ratanakiri. Road improvements and political stability have increased land prices, and <a href="Land%20Alienation%20in%20Ratanakiri%20Province">land alienation in Ratanakiri</a> has been a major problem. Despite a 2001 law allowing indigenous communities to obtain collective title to traditional lands, some villages have been left nearly landless. The national government has granted <a href="Concession%20%28contract%29">concessions</a> over land traditionally possessed by Ratanakiri's indigenous peoples, and even land "sales" have often involved bribes to officials, coercion, threats, or misinformation. Following the involvement of several international <a href="non-governmental%20organizations">non-governmental organizations</a> (NGOs), land alienation had decreased in frequency as of 2006. In the 2000s, Ratanakiri also <a href="Degar%20refugees%20in%20Cambodia">received hundreds of Degar (Montagnard) refugees</a> fleeing unrest in neighboring Vietnam; the Cambodian government was criticized for its forcible repatriation of many refugees.

The geography of Ratanakiri Province is diverse, encompassing rolling hills, mountains, plateaus, lowland <a href="Drainage%20basin">watershed</a>s, and <a href="crater%20lake">crater lake</a>s. Two major rivers, <a href="Tonle%20San">Tonle San</a> and <a href="Tonle%20Srepok">Tonle Srepok</a>, flow from east to west across the province. The province is known for its lush forests; as of 1997, 70–80% of the province was forested, either with old-growth forest or with <a href="secondary%20forest">secondary forest</a> regrown after <a href="shifting%20cultivation">shifting cultivation</a>. In the far north of the province are mountains of the <a href="Annamite%20Range">Annamite Range</a>; the area is characterized by dense <a href="broadleaf">broadleaf</a> <a href="evergreen%20forest">evergreen forest</a>s, relatively poor soil, and abundant wildlife. In the highlands between Tonle San and Tonle Srepok, the home of the vast majority of Ratanakiri's population, a hilly <a href="basalt">basalt</a> plateau provides fertile red soils. Secondary forests dominate this region. South of the Srepok River is a flat area of tropical <a href="deciduous%20forests">deciduous forests</a>.

<a href="Geography%20of%20Cambodia%23Climate">Like other areas of Cambodia</a>, Ratanakiri has a <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a>al climate with a rainy season from June to October, a cool season from November to January, and a hot season from March to May. Ratanakiri tends to be cooler than elsewhere in Cambodia. The average daily high temperature in the province is , and the average daily low temperature is . Annual precipitation is approximately . Flooding often occurs during the rainy season and has been exacerbated by the recently built <a href="Yali%20Falls%20Dam">Yali Falls Dam</a>.
Ratanakiri has some of the most <a href="Biodiversity">biologically diverse</a> lowland tropical rainforest and <a href="montane%20forest">montane forest</a> ecosystems in mainland Southeast Asia. One 1996 survey of two sites in Ratanakiri and one site in neighboring Mondulkiri recorded 44 mammal species, 76 bird species, and 9 reptile species. A 2007 survey of Ratanakiri's <a href="Virachey%20National%20Park">Virachey National Park</a> recorded 30 ant species, 19 katydid species, 37 fish species, 35 reptile species, 26 amphibian species, and 15 mammal species, including several species never before observed. <a href="Wildlife%20in%20Ratanakiri">Wildlife in Ratanakiri</a> includes <a href="Asian%20elephants">Asian elephants</a>, <a href="gaur">gaur</a>, and monkeys. Ratanakiri is an important site for the conservation of endangered birds, including the <a href="giant%20ibis">giant ibis</a> and the <a href="greater%20adjutant">greater adjutant</a>. The province's forests contain a wide variety of flora; one half-hectare forest inventory identified 189 species of trees and 320 species of ground flora and saplings.

Nearly half of Ratanakiri has been set aside in protected areas, which include <a href="Lomphat%20Wildlife%20Sanctuary">Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary</a> and Virachey National Park. Even these protected areas, however, are subject to <a href="illegal%20logging">illegal logging</a>, poaching, and mineral extraction. Though the province has been known for its relatively pristine environment, recent development has spawned environmental problems. The unspoiled image of the province often conflicts with the reality on the ground: visitors "expecting to find pristine forests teeming with wildlife are increasingly disappointed to find lifeless patches of freshly cut tree stumps". Land use patterns are changing as population growth has accelerated and agriculture and logging have intensified. <a href="Soil%20erosion">Soil erosion</a> is increasing, and <a href="microclimates">microclimates</a> are being altered. Habitat loss and unsustainable hunting have contributed to the province's decreasing biodiversity.

Government in Ratanakiri is weak, largely due to the province's remoteness, ethnic diversity, and recent history of Khmer Rouge dominance. The provincial legal framework is poor, and the rule of law is even weaker in Ratanakiri than elsewhere in Cambodia. Furthermore, government services are ineffective and insufficient to meet the needs of the province. The Cambodian government has traditionally accepted substantial support from <a href="Non-governmental%20organizations%20in%20Ratanakiri%20Province">NGOs in the region</a>.

Thon Saron is the provincial governor. As of the <a href="Cambodian%20communal%20elections%2C%202017">2017 communal elections</a>, <a href="commune%20council">commune council</a>s in Ratanakiri are composed of 207 members representing the CPP, 51 members representing the <a href="Cambodia%20National%20Rescue%20Party">Cambodia National Rescue Party</a>, and two members representing the <a href="Grassroots%20Democracy%20Party">Grassroots Democracy Party</a>. Political scientist Caroline Hughes has suggested that the CPP's overwhelming dominance in rural areas such as Ratanakiri stems from the central government's ability to suppress collective action, which in urban areas is offset by international donors and NGOs that provide support for opposition parties. Fifty-one commune council members in Ratanakiri (20%) were women as of the <a href="Cambodian%20communal%20elections%2C%202012">2012 communal elections</a>, and 98% of Ratanakiri's government staff was Khmer as of 2006. <a href="Bou%20Lam">Bou Lam</a>, a member of the CPP, represents Ratanakiri in the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Cambodia">National Assembly of Cambodia</a>.

Village government in Ratanakiri has both traditional and administrative components. Traditional forms of government, namely village <a href="Elder%20%28society%29">elders</a> and other indigenous institutions, are dominant. Members of each village designate one or more community elders to manage village affairs, mediate conflicts, and ensure that villagers follow customary laws, particularly about land and resource use. Elders do not play an autocratic role, and are instead primarily respected advisors and consensus builders. Village elders are generally male, but women also play a role in the management of the community and its resources. A village may also have a village chief, i.e., a local government person who is appointed by a higher governmental official. The village chief serves as a liaison between the village and outside government officials, but lacks traditional authority. The role of the village chief in village governance may be poorly defined; in one Kreung village, residents told a researcher that they were "very unclear exactly what the work of the village chief entailed."
The province is subdivided into 8 <a href="Administrative%20divisions%20of%20Cambodia">districts</a> and 1 municipality, as follows:

The vast majority of workers in Ratanakiri are employed in agriculture. Most of the indigenous residents of Ratanakiri are <a href="subsistence%20farmers">subsistence farmers</a>, practicing <a href="slash%20and%20burn">slash and burn</a> <a href="shifting%20cultivation">shifting cultivation</a>. (See <a href="%23Culture">Culture</a> below for more information on traditional subsistence practices.) Many families are beginning to shift production to <a href="cash%20crops">cash crops</a> such as <a href="cashews">cashews</a>, <a href="mangoes">mangoes</a>, and <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a>, a trend that has accelerated in recent years. Ratanakiri villagers have traditionally had little contact with the cash economy. Barter exchange remains widespread, and Khmer Loeu villagers tended to visit markets only once per year until quite recently. As of 2005, monetary income in the province averaged US$5 per month per person; purchased possessions such as motorcycles, televisions, and <a href="karaoke">karaoke</a> sets have become extremely desirable.

Larger-scale agriculture occurs on <a href="rubber">rubber</a> and <a href="cashew">cashew</a> plantations. Other economic activities in the province include gem mining and commercial logging. The most abundant gem in Ratanakiri is blue <a href="zircon">zircon</a>. Small quantities of <a href="amethyst">amethyst</a>, <a href="peridot">peridot</a>, and black <a href="opal">opal</a> are also produced. Gems are generally mined using traditional methods, with individuals digging holes and tunnels and manually removing the gems; recently, however, commercial mining operations have been moving into the province. Logging, particularly illegal logging, has been a problem both for environmental reasons and because of land alienation. This illegal logging has been undertaken by the Cambodian military and by Vietnamese loggers. In 1997, an estimated 300,000 cubic meters of logs were exported illegally from Ratanakiri to Vietnam, compared to a legal limit of 36,000 cubic meters. John Dennis, a researcher for the Asian Development Bank, described the logging in Ratanakiri as a "human rights emergency".
Ratanakiri's tourist industry has rapidly expanded in recent years: visits to the province increased from 6,000 in 2002 to 105,000 in 2008 and 118,000 in 2011. The region's tourism development strategy focuses on encouraging ecotourism. Increasing tourism in Ratanakiri has been problematic because local communities receive very little income from tourism and because guides sometimes bring tourists to villages without residents' consent, disrupting traditional ways of life. A few initiatives have sought to address these issues: a provincial tourism steering committee aims to ensure that tourism is non-destructive, and some programs provide English and tourism skills to indigenous people.

Ox-cart and motorcycle are common means of transportation in Ratanakiri. The provincial road system is better than in some parts of the country, but remains in somewhat bad condition. National Road 78 between Banlung and the Vietnam border was built between 2007 and 2010; the road was expected to increase trade between Cambodia and Vietnam. There is a <a href="Ratanakiri%20Airport">small airport</a> in Banlung, but commercial flights to Ratanakiri have long been discontinued.

As of 2013, Ratanakiri Province had a population of approximately 184,000. Its population nearly doubled between 1998 and 2013, largely due to internal migration. In 2013, Ratanakiri made up 1.3% of Cambodia's total population; its population density of 17.0 residents per square kilometer was just over one fifth the national average. About 70% of the province's population lives in the highlands; of the other 30%, approximately half live in more urbanized towns, and half live along rivers and in the lowlands, where they practice wetland rice cultivation and engage in market activities. <a href="Banlung">Banlung</a>, the provincial capital located in the central highlands, is by far the province's largest town, with a population of approximately 25,000. Other significant towns include <a href="Veun%20Sai">Veun Sai</a> in the north and <a href="Lomphat">Lomphat</a> in the south, with populations of 2,000 and 3,000 respectively.

In 2013, 37% of Ratanakiri residents were under age 15, 52% were age 15 to 49, 7% were age 50 to 64, and 3% were aged 65 or older; 49.7% of residents were male, and 50.3% were female. Each household had an average of 4.9 members, and most households (85.6%) were headed by men.

While highland peoples have inhabited Ratanakiri for well over a millennium, lowland peoples have migrated to the province in the last 200 years. As of 2013, various highland groups collectively called <a href="Khmer%20Loeu">Khmer Loeu</a> made up approximately half of Ratanakiri's population, ethnic <a href="Khmer%20people">Khmers</a> made up 36%, and ethnic <a href="Lao%20people">Lao</a> made up 10%. Within the Khmer Loeu population, 35% were <a href="Tampuan%20people">Tampuan</a> as of 1998, 24% were <a href="Jarai%20people">Jarai</a>, 23% were <a href="Kreung">Kreung</a>, 11% were <a href="Brou%20people">Brou</a>, 3% were <a href="Kachok">Kachok</a>, and 3% were <a href="Kavet%20people">Kavet</a>, with other groups making up the remaining one percent. There are also very small <a href="Vietnamese%20people">Vietnamese</a>, <a href="Cham%20%28Asia%29">Cham</a>, and <a href="Chinese%20people">Chinese</a> minorities. Though the official language of Ratanakiri (like all of Cambodia) is <a href="Khmer%20language">Khmer</a>, each indigenous group speaks its own language. Less than 10% of Ratanakiri's indigenous population can speak Khmer fluently.

Health indicators in Ratanakiri are the worst in Cambodia. Life expectancy is 39 years for men and 43 years for women. <a href="Malaria">Malaria</a>, <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, <a href="intestinal%20parasites">intestinal parasites</a>, <a href="cholera">cholera</a>, <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a>, and <a href="vaccine">vaccine</a>-preventable diseases are <a href="Endemic%20%28epidemiology%29">endemic</a>. Ratanakiri has very high rates of <a href="maternal%20mortality">maternal</a> and <a href="child%20mortality">child mortality</a>; in Ratanakiri and neighboring Mondulkiri (whose figures were combined in the most recent survey), over 10% of children die before the age of five. Ratanakiri also has the country's highest rates of severe <a href="malnutrition">malnutrition</a>. Ratanakiri residents' poor health can be attributed to a variety of factors, including poverty, remoteness of villages, poor quality medical services, and language and cultural barriers that prevent Khmer Loeu from obtaining medical care. The province has one referral hospital, 10 health centers, and 17 health posts. Medical equipment and supplies are minimal, and most health facilities are staffed by nurses or midwives, who are often poorly trained and irregularly paid.
As of 1998, Ratanakiri had 76 primary schools, one junior high school, and one high school. Education levels, particularly among Khmer Loeu, are very low. A 2002 survey of residents in six villages found that fewer than 10% of respondents had attended any primary school. Access to education is limited because of the expense of books, distance to schools, children's need to contribute to their families' livelihood, frequent absence of teachers, and instruction that is culturally inappropriate and in a language foreign to most students. Only 55% of Ratanakiri adults were <a href="literate">literate</a> as of 2013 (compared to 80% in Cambodia overall). Bilingual education initiatives, in which students begin instruction in native languages and gradually transition to instruction in Khmer, began in Ratanakiri in 2002 and appear to have been successful. The programs aim to make education more accessible to speakers of indigenous languages, as well as to give Khmer Loeu access to national political and economic affairs by providing Khmer language skills.

Ratanakiri is one of the least developed provinces in Cambodia. As of 2013, the average home had 1.9 rooms, and only 14.9% of buildings in the province had permanent roofs, walls, and flooring. Relatively few households (27.8%) had toilet facilities. The largest share of households (38.0%) obtained water from springs, streams, ponds, or rain; much of the remainder obtained water from protected (23.9%) or unprotected (15.1%) dug <a href="water%20well">wells</a>. Only 21.6% of Ratanakiri residents obtained water from sources that are considered safe (purchased water, piped water, or tube/piped wells). Household water sources were within the home for 28.0% of households, near the home for 39.1%, and away from the home for 32.9%. The most common source of light was battery power (39.5%), followed by government-provided power (25.5%), and kerosene (16.5%). Most households (85%) used firewood as the main fuel for cooking. A <a href="non-governmental%20organizations%20in%20Ratanakiri%20Province">variety of NGOs</a>, including <a href="Oxfam">Oxfam</a> and <a href="Health%20Unlimited">Health Unlimited</a>, work to improve health and living conditions in the province.

Khmer Loeu typically practice <a href="Subsistence%20agriculture">subsistence</a> <a href="slash%20and%20burn">slash and burn</a> <a href="shifting%20cultivation">shifting cultivation</a> in small villages of between 20 and 60 <a href="nuclear%20families">nuclear families</a>. Each village <a href="Common%20ownership">collectively owns</a> and governs a forest territory whose boundaries are known though not marked. Within this land, each family is allocated, on average, 1–2 <a href="hectares">hectares</a> (2.5–5 <a href="acre">acre</a>s) of actively cultivated land and 5–6 hectares (12.5–15 acres) of fallow land. The ecologically sustainable cultivation cycle practiced by the Khmer Loeu generally lasts 10 to 15 years. Villagers supplement their agricultural livelihood with low-intensity hunting, fishing, and gathering over a large area.

Khmer Loeu diets in Ratanakiri are largely dictated by the food that is available for harvesting or gathering. Numerous food taboos also limit food choice, particularly among pregnant women, children, and the sick. The primary staple grain is <a href="rice">rice</a>, though most families experience rice shortages during the six months before harvest time. Some families have begun to plant <a href="maize">maize</a> to alleviate this problem; other sources of grain include <a href="potatoes">potatoes</a>, <a href="cassava">cassava</a>, and <a href="taro">taro</a>. Most Khmer Loeu diets are low in <a href="Protein%20in%20nutrition">protein</a>, which is limited in availability. <a href="Wild%20game">Wild game</a> and fish are major protein sources, and smaller animals such as rats, wild chickens, and insects are also sometimes eaten. Domestic animals such as pigs, cows, and <a href="Domestic%20buffalo">buffaloes</a> are only eaten when sacrifices are made. In the rainy season, many varieties of vegetables and leaves are gathered from the forest. (Vegetables are generally not cultivated.) Commonly eaten fruits include bananas, <a href="jackfruit">jackfruit</a>, <a href="papayas">papayas</a>, and <a href="mangoes">mangoes</a>.
Houses in rural Ratanakiri are made from <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a>, <a href="rattan">rattan</a>, wood, <a href="saek%20%28plant%29">saek</a>, and <a href="kanma">kanma</a> leaves, all of which are collected from nearby forests; they typically last for around three years. Village spatial organization varies by ethnic group. Kreung villages are constructed in a circular manner, with houses facing inwards toward a central meeting house. In Jarai villages, vast longhouses are inhabited by all extended families, with the inner house divided into smaller compartments. Tampuan villages may follow either pattern.

Nearly all Khmer Loeu are <a href="animist">animist</a>, and their cosmologies are intertwined with the natural world. Some forests are believed to be inhabited by local spirits, and local taboos forbid cutting in those areas. Within spirit forests, certain natural features such as rock formations, waterfalls, pools, and vegetation are sacred. Major <a href="sacrificial">sacrificial</a> festivals in Ratanakiri occur during March and April, when fields are selected and prepared for the new planting season. <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> <a href="Mission%20%28Christian%29">missionaries</a> are present in the province, and some Khmer Loeu have converted to Christianity. The region's ethnic Khmer are <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a>. There is also a small <a href="Islam">Muslim</a> community, consisting mainly of ethnic Cham.

Because of the province's high prevalence of malaria and its distance from regional centers, Ratanakiri was isolated from Western influences until the late 20th century. Major cultural shifts have occurred in recent years however, particularly in villages near roads and district towns; these changes have been attributed to contact with internal immigrants, government officials, and NGO workers. Clothing and diets are becoming more standardized, and traditional music is being displaced by Khmer music. Many villagers have also observed a loss of respect for elders and a growing divide between the young and the old. Young people have begun to refuse to abide by traditional rules and have stopped believing in spirits.
