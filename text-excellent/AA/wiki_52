Anna May Wong

Anna May Wong (born Wong Liu Tsong; January 3, 1905 – February 3, 1961) was an American actress, considered to be the first Toisonese (<a href="Taishanese">Taishanese</a>) <a href="Chinese%20Americans">Chinese American</a> <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a> movie star, as well as the first Chinese American actress to gain international recognition. Her long and varied career spanned silent film, sound film, television, stage, and radio.

Born in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> to second-generation Toisonese (Taishanese)-Chinese-American parents, Wong became infatuated with the movies and began acting in films at an early age. During the <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> era, she acted in "<a href="The%20Toll%20of%20the%20Sea">The Toll of the Sea</a>" (1922), one of the first movies made in color and <a href="Douglas%20Fairbanks">Douglas Fairbanks</a>' "<a href="The%20Thief%20of%20Bagdad%20%281924%20film%29">The Thief of Bagdad</a>" (1924). Wong became a fashion icon and had achieved international stardom in 1924. Frustrated by the stereotypical supporting roles she reluctantly played in <a href="Classical%20Hollywood%20cinema">Hollywood</a>, Wong left for Europe in the late 1920s, where she starred in several notable plays and films, among them "<a href="Piccadilly%20%28film%29">Piccadilly</a>" (1929). She spent the first half of the 1930s traveling between the United States and Europe for film and stage work. Wong was featured in films of the early sound era, such as "<a href="Daughter%20of%20the%20Dragon">Daughter of the Dragon</a>" (1931) and "<a href="Daughter%20of%20Shanghai">Daughter of Shanghai</a>" (1937) and with <a href="Marlene%20Dietrich">Marlene Dietrich</a> in <a href="Josef%20von%20Sternberg">Josef von Sternberg</a>'s "<a href="Shanghai%20Express%20%28film%29">Shanghai Express</a>" (1932).

In 1935 Wong was dealt the most severe disappointment of her career, when <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> refused to consider her for the leading role of the Chinese character O-Lan in the film version of <a href="Pearl%20S.%20Buck">Pearl S. Buck's</a> "<a href="The%20Good%20Earth%20%28film%29">The Good Earth</a>", choosing instead the white actress <a href="Luise%20Rainer">Luise Rainer</a> to play the leading role. Wong spent the next year touring China, visiting her family's ancestral village and studying Chinese culture. In the late 1930s, she starred in several <a href="B%20movie">B movie</a>s for <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>, portraying Chinese and Chinese Americans in a positive light. She paid less attention to her film career during World War II, when she devoted her time and money to helping the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Chinese cause against Japan</a>. Wong returned to the public eye in the 1950s in several television appearances.

In 1951, Wong made history with her television show "<a href="The%20Gallery%20of%20Madame%20Liu-Tsong">The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong</a>", the first ever U.S. television show starring an <a href="Asian%20American">Asian American</a> <a href="American%20TV%20shows%20with%20an%20Asian%20Lead">series lead</a>. She had been planning to return to film in "<a href="Flower%20Drum%20Song%20%28film%29">Flower Drum Song</a>" when she died in 1961, at the age of 56 from a heart attack. For decades after her death, Wong was remembered principally for the stereotypical "<a href="Dragon%20Lady">Dragon Lady</a>" and demure "Butterfly" roles that she was often given. Her life and career were re-evaluated in the years around the centennial of her birth, in three major literary works and film retrospectives.

Anna May Wong was born Wong Liu Tsong ("Liu Tsong" literally meaning "willow frost") on January 3, 1905, on Flower Street in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, one block north of Chinatown, in an integrated community of Chinese, Irish, German and Japanese residents. She was the second of seven children born to Wong Sam Sing, owner of the Sam Kee Laundry, and his second wife Lee Gon Toy.

Wong's parents were <a href="second%20generation%20immigrant">second-generation</a> Chinese Americans; her maternal and paternal grandparents had resided in the U.S. since at least 1855. Her paternal grandfather, A Wong Wong, was a <a href="merchant">merchant</a> who owned two stores in Michigan Hills, a gold-mining area in <a href="Placer%20County%2C%20California">Placer County</a>. He had come from Chang On, a village near <a href="Taishan%2C%20Guangdong">Taishan</a>, <a href="Guangdong%20Province">Guangdong Province</a>, China in 1853. Anna May's father spent his youth traveling between the U.S. and China, where he married his first wife and fathered a son in 1890. He returned to the U.S. in the late 1890s and in 1901, while continuing to support his family in China, he married a second wife, Anna May's mother. Anna May's older sister Lew Ying (Lulu) was born in late 1902, and Anna May in 1905, followed by five more children.

In 1910, the family moved to a neighborhood on <a href="Figueroa%20Street">Figueroa Street</a> where they were the only Chinese on their <a href="City%20block">block</a>, living alongside mostly Mexican and Eastern European families. The two hills separating their new home from Chinatown helped Wong to assimilate into American culture. She attended public school with her older sister at first, but then, when the girls became the target of racial taunts from other students, they moved to a <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> Chinese school. Classes were taught in English, but Wong attended a <a href="Chinese%20school">Chinese language school</a> afternoons and on Saturdays.

About that same time, U.S. motion picture production began to relocate from the <a href="East%20Coast%20%28U.S.%29">East Coast</a> to the Los Angeles area. Movies were shot constantly in and around Wong's neighborhood. She began going to <a href="Nickelodeon%20%28movie%20theater%29">Nickelodeon movie theaters</a> and quickly became obsessed with the "<a href="Film">flickers</a>", missing school and using lunch money to attend the cinema. Her father was not happy with her interest in films, feeling that it interfered with her studies, but Wong decided to pursue a film career regardless. At the age of nine, she constantly begged filmmakers to give her roles, earning herself the nickname "C.C.C." or "Curious Chinese Child". By the age of 11, Wong had come up with her <a href="stage%20name">stage name</a> of Anna May Wong, formed by joining both her English and family names.

Wong was working at Hollywood's Ville de Paris <a href="department%20store">department store</a> when <a href="Metro%20Pictures">Metro Pictures</a> needed 300 female <a href="extra%20%28actor%29">extras</a> to appear in <a href="Alla%20Nazimova">Alla Nazimova</a>'s film "<a href="The%20Red%20Lantern">The Red Lantern</a>" (1919). Without her father's knowledge, a friend of his with movie connections helped her land an uncredited role as an <a href="Movie%20extra">extra</a> carrying a lantern.

Wong worked steadily for the next two years as an extra in various movies, including <a href="Priscilla%20Dean">Priscilla Dean</a> and <a href="Colleen%20Moore">Colleen Moore</a> pictures. While still a student, Wong came down with an illness identified as <a href="Sydenham%27s%20Chorea">St. Vitus's Dance</a> which caused her to miss months of school. She was on the verge of emotional collapse when her father took her to a practitioner of <a href="traditional%20Chinese%20medicine">traditional Chinese medicine</a>. The treatments proved successful, though Wong later claimed this had more to do with her dislike of the methods. Other Chinese thought such as <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and particularly <a href="Taoism">Taoism</a> and the teachings of <a href="Laozi">Laozi</a> had a strong influence on Wong's personal philosophy throughout her life. The family's religious life also included <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> thought, in the form of <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterianism</a> and as an adult she was a <a href="Christian%20Science">Christian Scientist</a> for some time.

Finding it difficult to keep up with both her schoolwork and her passion, Wong dropped out of <a href="Los%20Angeles%20High%20School">Los Angeles High School</a> in 1921 to pursue a full-time acting career. Reflecting on her decision, Wong told "Motion Picture Magazine" in 1931: "I was so young when I began that I knew I still had youth if I failed, so I determined to give myself 10 years to succeed as an actress."

In 1921, Wong received her first <a href="screen%20credit">screen credit</a> for "<a href="Bits%20of%20Life">Bits of Life</a>", the first <a href="anthology%20film">anthology film</a>, in which she played the wife of <a href="Lon%20Chaney%2C%20Sr.">Lon Chaney</a>'s character, Toy Ling, in a segment entitled "Hop". She later recalled it fondly as the only time she played the role of a mother; her appearance earned her a <a href="cover%20photo">cover photo</a> on the British magazine "Picture Show".

At the age of 17, Wong played her first <a href="leading%20role">leading role</a>, in the early Metro <a href="two-color%20Technicolor">two-color Technicolor</a> movie "<a href="The%20Toll%20of%20the%20Sea">The Toll of the Sea</a>". Written by <a href="Frances%20Marion">Frances Marion</a>, the story was based loosely on "<a href="Madama%20Butterfly">Madama Butterfly</a>". <a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">"Variety" magazine</a> singled Wong out for praise, noting her "extraordinarily fine" acting. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" commented, "Miss Wong stirs in the spectator all the sympathy her part calls for and she never repels one by an excess of theatrical 'feeling'. She has a difficult role, a role that is botched nine times out of ten, but hers is the tenth performance. Completely unconscious of the camera, with a fine sense of proportion and remarkable pantomimic accuracy ... She should be seen again and often on the screen."

Despite such reviews, Hollywood proved reluctant to create starring roles for Wong; her <a href="ethnicity">ethnicity</a> prevented U.S. filmmakers from seeing her as a leading lady. David Schwartz, the chief curator of the <a href="Museum%20of%20the%20Moving%20Image%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Museum of the Moving Image</a>, notes, "She built up a level of stardom in Hollywood, but Hollywood didn't know what to do with her." She spent the next few years in <a href="supporting%20role">supporting role</a>s providing "exotic atmosphere", for instance playing a concubine in <a href="Tod%20Browning">Tod Browning</a>'s "<a href="Drifting%20%281923%20film%29">Drifting</a>" (1923). Film producers capitalized on Wong's growing fame but they relegated her to supporting roles. Still optimistic about a film career, in 1923 Wong said: "Pictures are fine and I'm getting along all right, but it's not so bad to have the laundry back of you, so you can wait and take good parts and be independent when you're climbing."

At the age of 19, Wong was cast in a supporting role as a scheming Mongol slave in the 1924 <a href="Douglas%20Fairbanks">Douglas Fairbanks</a> picture "<a href="The%20Thief%20of%20Bagdad%20%281924%20film%29">The Thief of Bagdad</a>". Playing a stereotypical "Dragon Lady" role, her brief appearances on-screen caught the attention of audiences and critics alike. The film grossed more than $2 million and helped introduce Wong to the public. Around this time, Wong had an affair with director <a href="Tod%20Browning">Tod Browning</a>. It was a romance largely known of at the time: it was an <a href="Miscegenation">interracial relationship</a> and Wong was underage.

After this second prominent role, Wong moved out of the family home into her own apartment. Conscious that Americans viewed her as "foreign born" even though she was born and raised in California, Wong began cultivating a <a href="flapper">flapper</a> image. In March 1924, planning to make films about <a href="Chinese%20mythology">Chinese myths</a>, she signed a deal creating Anna May Wong Productions; when her <a href="business%20partner">business partner</a> was found to be engaging in dishonest practices, Wong brought a lawsuit against him and the company was dissolved.

It soon became evident that Wong's career would continue to be limited by American <a href="anti-miscegenation%20laws">anti-miscegenation laws</a>, which prevented her from sharing an on-screen kiss with any person of another race, even if the character was Asian, but being portrayed by a white actor. The only leading Asian man in U.S. films in the silent era was <a href="Sessue%20Hayakawa">Sessue Hayakawa</a>. Unless Asian leading men could be found, Wong could not be a <a href="leading%20lady">leading lady</a>.

Wong continued to be offered exotic supporting roles that followed the rising "vamp" stereotype in cinema. She played <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">indigenous native girls</a> in two 1924 films. Filmed on location in the <a href="Territory%20of%20Alaska">Territory of Alaska</a> she portrayed an <a href="Eskimo">Eskimo</a> in "<a href="The%20Alaskan%20%281924%20film%29">The Alaskan</a>". She returned to Los Angeles to perform the part of Princess <a href="Characters%20of%20Peter%20Pan%23Tiger%20Lily">Tiger Lily</a> in "<a href="Peter%20Pan%20%281924%20film%29">Peter Pan</a>". Both films were shot by <a href="cinematographer">cinematographer</a> <a href="James%20Wong%20Howe">James Wong Howe</a> but "Peter Pan" was more successful; the hit of the Christmas season. The next year, Wong was singled out for critical praise in a manipulative Oriental vamp role in the film <a href="Forty%20Winks%20%28film%29">"Forty Winks"</a>. Despite such favorable reviews, she became increasingly disappointed with her <a href="casting">casting</a> and began to seek other roads to success. In early 1925 she joined a group of <a href="serial%20%28film%29">serial</a> stars on a tour of the <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> circuits; when the tour proved to be a failure, Wong and the rest of the group returned to Hollywood.

In 1926, Wong put the first rivet into the structure of <a href="Grauman%27s%20Chinese%20Theatre">Grauman's Chinese Theatre</a> when she joined <a href="Norma%20Talmadge">Norma Talmadge</a> for its <a href="groundbreaking">groundbreaking</a> ceremony, although she was not invited to leave her hand- and foot-prints in cement.

In the same year Wong starred in "The Silk Bouquet". Re-titled "The Dragon Horse" in 1927, the film was one of the first U.S. films to be produced with Chinese backing, provided by <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>'s <a href="Chinese%20Six%20Companies">Chinese Six Companies</a>. The story was set in China during the <a href="Ming%20Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a> and featured Asian actors playing the Asian roles.

Wong continued to be assigned supporting roles. Hollywood's Asian female characters tended toward two stereotypical poles: the naïve and self-sacrificing "Butterfly" and the sly and deceitful "Dragon Lady". In "<a href="Old%20San%20Francisco%20%28film%29">Old San Francisco</a>" (1927), directed by <a href="Alan%20Crosland">Alan Crosland</a> for <a href="Warner%20Brothers">Warner Brothers</a>, Wong played a "Dragon Lady", a gangster's daughter. In "<a href="Mr.%20Wu">Mr. Wu</a>" (1927) she played a supporting role as increasing <a href="censorship">censorship</a> against mixed race onscreen couples cost her the lead. In "<a href="The%20Crimson%20City">The Crimson City</a>", released the following year, this happened again.

Tired of being both typecast and being passed over for lead Asian character roles in favor of non-Asian actresses, Wong left Hollywood in 1928 for Europe. Interviewed by Doris Mackie for "Film Weekly" in 1933, Wong complained about her Hollywood roles: "I was so tired of the parts I had to play." She commented: "There seems little for me in Hollywood, because, rather than real Chinese, producers prefer Hungarians, Mexicans, American Indians for Chinese roles."

In Europe, Wong became a sensation, starring in notable films such as "<a href="Song%20%28film%29">Schmutziges Geld</a>" (aka "Song" and "Show Life", 1928) and "Großstadtschmetterling" ("<a href="Pavement%20Butterfly">Pavement Butterfly</a>"). Of the German critics' response to "Song", "The New York Times" reported that Wong was "acclaimed not only as an actress of transcendent talent but as a great beauty". The article noted that Germans passed over Wong's American background: "Berlin critics, who were unanimous in praise of both the star and the production, neglect to mention that Anna May is of American birth. They mention only her Chinese origins." In Vienna, she played the title role in the <a href="operetta">operetta</a> "Tschun Tschi" in fluent German. An Austrian critic wrote, "Fräulein Wong had the audience perfectly in her power and the unobtrusive tragedy of her acting was deeply moving, carrying off the difficult German-speaking part very successfully."

While in Germany, Wong became an inseparable friend of the director <a href="Leni%20Riefenstahl">Leni Riefenstahl</a>. Her close friendships with several women throughout her life, including <a href="Marlene%20Dietrich">Marlene Dietrich</a> and <a href="Cecil%20Cunningham">Cecil Cunningham</a>, led to rumors of <a href="lesbian">lesbian</a>ism which damaged her public reputation. These rumors, in particular of her supposed relationship with Dietrich, embarrassed Wong's family who in any case had long been opposed to her acting career, at that time not considered to be an entirely respectable profession.

London producer <a href="Basil%20Dean">Basil Dean</a> bought the play "<a href="A%20Circle%20of%20Chalk">A Circle of Chalk</a>" for Wong to appear in with the young <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>, her first stage performance in the UK. Criticism of her California accent, described by one critic as a "Yankee squeak", led to Wong seeking vocal tutoring at <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a>, where she trained in <a href="received%20pronunciation">received pronunciation</a>. Composer <a href="Constant%20Lambert">Constant Lambert</a>, infatuated with the actress after having seen her in films, attended the play on its opening night and subsequently composed "Eight Poems of Li Po", dedicated to her.

Wong made her last silent film, "<a href="Piccadilly%20%28film%29">Piccadilly</a>", in 1929, the first of five English films in which she had a starring role. The film caused a sensation in the UK. <a href="Gilda%20Gray">Gilda Gray</a> was the top-billed actress, but "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" commented that Wong "outshines the star" and that "from the moment Miss Wong dances in the kitchen's rear, she steals 'Piccadilly' from Miss Gray." Though the film presented Wong in her most sensual role in a British film, once again she was not permitted to kiss her Caucasian love interest and a controversial planned scene involving a kiss was cut before the film was released. Forgotten for decades after its release, "Piccadilly" was later restored by the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine's <a href="Richard%20Corliss">Richard Corliss</a> calls "Piccadilly" Wong's best film, and "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" reports that the rediscovery of this film and Wong's performance in it has been responsible for a restoration of the actress' reputation.

While in London, Wong was romantically linked with writer and broadcasting executive <a href="Eric%20Maschwitz">Eric Maschwitz</a>, who possibly wrote the lyrics to "<a href="These%20Foolish%20Things%20%28Remind%20Me%20Of%20You%29">These Foolish Things (Remind Me Of You)</a>" as an evocation of his longing for her after they parted. Wong's first <a href="talkie">talkie</a> was "<a href="The%20Flame%20of%20Love">The Flame of Love</a>" (1930), which she recorded in French, English and German. Though Wong's performance – particularly her handling of the three languages – was lauded, all three versions of the film received negative reviews.

During the 1930s, American studios were looking for fresh European talent. Ironically, Wong caught their eye, and she was offered a contract with <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Studios</a> in 1930. Enticed by the promise of lead roles and top billing, she returned to the United States. The prestige and training she had gained during her years in Europe led to a starring role on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> in "On the Spot", a drama that ran for 167 performances and which she would later film as "<a href="Dangerous%20to%20Know">Dangerous to Know</a>". When the play's director wanted Wong to use stereotypical Japanese mannerisms, derived from "Madame Butterfly", in her performance of a Chinese character, Wong refused. She instead used her knowledge of Chinese style and gestures to imbue the character with a greater degree of authenticity. Following her return to Hollywood in 1930, Wong repeatedly turned to the stage and cabaret for a creative outlet.

In November 1930, Wong's mother was struck and killed by an automobile in front of the <a href="Figueroa%20Street">Figueroa Street</a> house. The family remained at the house until 1934, when Wong's father returned to his hometown in China with Anna May's younger brothers and sister. Anna May had been paying for the education of her younger siblings, who put their education to work after they relocated to China. Before the family left, Wong's father wrote a brief article for "Xinning", a magazine for overseas Taishanese, in which he expressed his pride in his famous daughter.
With the promise of appearing in a <a href="Josef%20von%20Sternberg">Josef von Sternberg</a> film, Wong accepted another stereotypical role – the title character of <a href="Fu%20Manchu">Fu Manchu</a>'s vengeful daughter in "<a href="Daughter%20of%20the%20Dragon">Daughter of the Dragon</a>" (1931). This was the last stereotypically "evil Chinese" role Wong played, and also her one starring appearance alongside the only other well-known Asian actor of the era, <a href="Sessue%20Hayakawa">Sessue Hayakawa</a>. Though she was given the starring role, this status was not reflected in her paycheck: she was paid $6,000, while Hayakawa received $10,000 and <a href="Warner%20Oland">Warner Oland</a>, who is only in the film for 23 minutes, was paid $12,000.

Wong began using her newfound celebrity to make political statements: late in 1931, for example, she wrote a harsh criticism of the <a href="Mukden%20Incident">Mukden Incident</a> and Japan's subsequent <a href="Japanese%20invasion%20of%20Manchuria">invasion of Manchuria</a>. She also became more outspoken in her advocacy for Chinese American causes and for better film roles. In a 1933 interview for "Film Weekly" entitled "I Protest", Wong criticized the negative stereotyping in "Daughter of the Dragon", saying, "Why is it that the screen Chinese is always the villain? And so crude a villain – murderous, treacherous, a snake in the grass! We are not like that. How could we be, with a civilization that is so many times older than the West?"

Wong appeared alongside <a href="Marlene%20Dietrich">Marlene Dietrich</a> as a self-sacrificing courtesan in Sternberg's "<a href="Shanghai%20Express%20%28film%29">Shanghai Express</a>". Her sexually charged scenes with Dietrich have been noted by many commentators and fed rumors about the relationship between the two stars. Though contemporary reviews focused on Dietrich's acting and Sternberg's direction, film historians today judge that Wong's performance upstaged that of Dietrich.

The Chinese press had long given Wong's career very mixed reviews, and were less than favorable to her performance in "Shanghai Express". A Chinese newspaper ran the headline: "Paramount Utilizes Anna May Wong to Produce Picture to Disgrace China" and continued, "Although she is deficient in artistic portrayal, she has done more than enough to disgrace the Chinese race." Critics in China believed that Wong's on-screen sexuality spread negative stereotypes of Chinese women. The most virulent criticism came from the <a href="Kuomintang">Nationalist government</a>, but China's <a href="Chinese%20intellectualism">intellectuals</a> and liberals were not always so opposed to Wong, as demonstrated when <a href="Peking%20University">Peking University</a> awarded the actress an honorary doctorate in 1932. Contemporary sources reported that this was probably the only time that an actor had been so honored.

In both America and Europe, Wong had been seen as a fashion icon for over a decade. In 1934, the Mayfair Mannequin Society of New York voted her "The World's best-dressed woman" and in 1938 "<a href="Look%20%28American%20magazine%29">Look</a>" magazine named her "The World's most beautiful Chinese girl".

After her success in Europe and prominent role in "Shanghai Express", Wong's Hollywood career returned to its old pattern. Because of the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Production%20Code">Hays Code</a>'s anti-miscegenation rules, she was passed over for the leading female role in "<a href="The%20Son-Daughter">The Son-Daughter</a>" in favor of <a href="Helen%20Hayes">Helen Hayes</a>. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer deemed her "too Chinese to play a Chinese" in the film, and the Hays Office would not have allowed her to perform romantic scenes since the film's male lead, <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20Novarro">Ramón Novarro</a>, was not Asian. Wong was scheduled to play the role of a mistress to a corrupt Chinese general in <a href="Frank%20Capra">Frank Capra</a>'s "<a href="The%20Bitter%20Tea%20of%20General%20Yen">The Bitter Tea of General Yen</a>" (1933), but the role went instead to <a href="Toshia%20Mori">Toshia Mori</a>.
Again disappointed with Hollywood, Wong returned to Britain, where she stayed for nearly three years. In addition to appearing in four films she toured Scotland and Ireland as part of a vaudeville show. She also appeared in the <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George</a> <a href="Silver%20Jubilee">Silver Jubilee</a> program in 1935. Her film "<a href="Java%20Head%20%281934%20film%29">Java Head</a>" (1934), though generally considered a minor effort, was the only film in which Wong kissed the lead male character, her white husband in the film. Wong's biographer, Graham Russell Hodges, commented that this may be why the film remained one of Wong's personal favorites. While in London, Wong met <a href="Mei%20Lanfang">Mei Lanfang</a>, one of the most famous stars of the <a href="Beijing%20Opera">Beijing Opera</a>. She had long been interested in Chinese opera and Mei offered to instruct Wong if she ever visited China.

In the 1930s, the popularity of <a href="Pearl%20Buck">Pearl Buck</a>'s novels, especially "<a href="The%20Good%20Earth">The Good Earth</a>", as well as growing American sympathy for China in its struggles with Japanese Imperialism, opened up opportunities for more positive Chinese roles in U.S. films. Wong returned to the U.S. in June 1935 with the goal of obtaining the role of O-lan, the lead female character in MGM's film version of "The Good Earth". Since its publication in 1931, Wong had made known her desire to play O-lan in a film version of the book; and as early as 1933, Los Angeles newspapers were touting Wong as the best choice for the part. Nevertheless, the studio apparently never seriously considered Wong for the role because <a href="Paul%20Muni">Paul Muni</a>, an actor of European descent, was to play O-lan's husband, Wang Lung, and the <a href="Hays%20Code">Hays Code</a> prohibited portraying <a href="miscegenation">miscegenation</a> on camera (although both the characters were Chinese, the actors not being of the same race risked running afoul of the Code). The Chinese government also advised the studio against casting Wong in the role. The Chinese advisor to MGM commented: "whenever she appears in a movie, the newspapers print her picture with the caption 'Anna May again loses face for China' ".

According to Wong, she was instead offered the part of Lotus, a deceitful <a href="Sing-song%20girls">song girl</a> who helps to destroy the family and seduces the family's oldest son. Wong refused the role, telling MGM head of production <a href="Irving%20Thalberg">Irving Thalberg</a>, "If you let me play O-lan, I will be very glad. But you're asking me – with Chinese blood – to do the only unsympathetic role in the picture featuring an all-American cast portraying Chinese characters." The role Wong hoped for went to <a href="Luise%20Rainer">Luise Rainer</a>, who won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance. Wong's sister, Mary Liu Heung Wong, appeared in the film in the role of the Little Bride. MGM's refusal to consider Wong for this most high-profile of Chinese characters in U.S. film is remembered today as "one of the most notorious cases of casting discrimination in the 1930s".

After the major disappointment of losing the role in "The Good Earth", Wong announced plans for a year-long tour of China, to visit her father and his family in <a href="Taishan%2C%20Guangdong">Taishan</a>. Wong's father had returned to his hometown in China with her younger brothers and sister in 1934. Aside from Mei Lanfang's offer to teach her, she wanted to learn more about the Chinese theater and through English translations to better perform some Chinese plays before international audiences. She told the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" on her departure, "... for a year, I shall study the land of my fathers. Perhaps upon my arrival, I shall feel like an outsider. Perhaps instead, I shall find my past life assuming a dreamlike quality of unreality."

Embarking in January 1936, Wong chronicled her experiences in a series of articles printed in U.S. newspapers such as the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a>", the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Examiner">Los Angeles Examiner</a>", the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", and "<a href="Photoplay">Photoplay</a>". In a stopover in Tokyo on the way to Shanghai, local reporters, ever curious about her romantic life, asked if she had marriage plans, to which Wong replied, "No, I am wedded to my art." The following day, however, Japanese newspapers reported that Wong was married to a wealthy Cantonese man named Art.

During her travels in China, Wong continued to be strongly criticized by the Nationalist government and the film community. She had difficulty communicating in many areas of China because she was raised with the <a href="Taishan%20dialect">Taishan dialect</a> rather than Mandarin. She later commented that some of the <a href="varieties%20of%20Chinese">varieties of Chinese</a> sounded "as strange to me as <a href="Goidelic%20languages">Gaelic</a>. I thus had the strange experience of talking to my own people through an interpreter."

The toll of international celebrity on Wong's personal life manifested itself in bouts of depression and sudden anger, as well as excessive smoking and drinking. Feeling irritable when she disembarked in Hong Kong, Wong was uncharacteristically rude to the awaiting crowd, which then quickly turned hostile. One person shouted: "Down with Huang Liu Tsong – the stooge that disgraces China. Don't let her go ashore." Wong began crying and a stampede ensued. After she left for a short trip to the Philippines, the situation cooled and Wong joined her family in Hong Kong. With her father and her siblings, Wong visited his family and his first wife at the family's ancestral home near Taishan. Conflicting reports claim that she was either warmly welcomed or met with hostility by the villagers. She spent over 10 days in the family's village and some time in neighboring villages before continuing her tour of China. After returning to Hollywood, Wong reflected on her year in China and her career in Hollywood: "I am convinced that I could never play in the Chinese Theatre. I have no feeling for it. It's a pretty sad situation to be rejected by Chinese because I'm 'too American' and by American producers because they prefer other races to act Chinese parts." Wong's father returned to Los Angeles in 1938.

To complete her contract with Paramount Pictures, Wong made a string of B movies in the late 1930s. Often dismissed by critics, the films gave Wong non-stereotypical roles which were publicized in the Chinese-American press for their positive images. These smaller-budgeted films could be bolder than the higher-profile releases and Wong used this to her advantage to portray successful, professional, Chinese-American characters. Competent and proud of their Chinese heritage, these roles worked against the prevailing U.S. film portrayals of Chinese Americans. In contrast to the usual official Chinese condemnation of Wong's film roles, the Chinese consul to Los Angeles gave his approval to the final scripts of two of these films, "<a href="Daughter%20of%20Shanghai">Daughter of Shanghai</a>" (1937) and "<a href="King%20of%20Chinatown">King of Chinatown</a>" (1939).
In "Daughter of Shanghai", Wong played the Asian-American female lead in a role that was rewritten for her as the heroine of the story, actively setting the plot into motion rather than the more passive character originally planned. The script was so carefully tailored for Wong that at one point it was given the working title "Anna May Wong Story". Of this film, Wong told "Hollywood Magazine", "I like my part in this picture better than any I've had before ... because this picture gives Chinese a break – we have sympathetic parts for a change! To me that means a great deal." "The New York Times" gave the film a generally positive review, commenting of its B-movie origins, "An unusually competent cast saves the film from the worst consequences of certain inevitable banalities. [The cast] ... combine with effective sets to reduce the natural odds against any pictures in the "Daughter of Shanghai" tradition." In October 1937, the press carried rumors that Wong had plans to marry her male co-star in this film, childhood friend and <a href="Korean%20American">Korean-American</a> actor <a href="Philip%20Ahn">Philip Ahn</a>. Wong replied, "It would be like marrying my brother."

<a href="Bosley%20Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a> was not so kind to "<a href="Dangerous%20to%20Know">Dangerous to Know</a>" (1938), which he called a "second-rate <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a>, hardly worthy of the talents of its generally capable cast". In "King of Chinatown" Wong played a surgeon who sacrifices a high-paying promotion in order to devote her energies to helping the Chinese fight the Japanese invasion. "The New York Times"' <a href="Frank%20S.%20Nugent">Frank Nugent</a> gave the film a negative review. Though he commented positively on its advocacy of the Chinese in their fight against Japan, he wrote, "... Paramount should have spared us and its cast ... the necessity of being bothered with such folderol".

Paramount also employed Wong as a tutor to other actors, such as <a href="Dorothy%20Lamour">Dorothy Lamour</a> in her role as a Eurasian in "<a href="Disputed%20Passage">Disputed Passage</a>". Wong performed on radio several times, including a 1939 role as "Peony" in Pearl Buck's "The Patriot" on <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a>' "<a href="The%20Campbell%20Playhouse%20%28radio%20series%29">The Campbell Playhouse</a>". Wong's cabaret act, which included songs in Cantonese, French, English, German, Danish, Swedish, and other languages, took her from the U.S. to Europe and Australia through the 1930s and 1940s.

In 1938, having auctioned off her movie costumes and donated the money to Chinese aid, the Chinese Benevolent Association of California honored Wong for her work in support of Chinese refugees. The proceeds from the preface that she wrote in 1942 to a cookbook entitled "New Chinese Recipes", one of the first Chinese cookbooks, were also dedicated to United China Relief. Between 1939 and 1942, she made few films, instead engaging in events and appearances in support of the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Chinese struggle against Japan</a>.

Being sick of the negative typecasting that had enveloped her throughout her American career, Wong visited Australia for more than three months in 1939. There she was the star attraction in a vaudeville show entitled 'Highlights from Hollywood' at the Tivoli Theatre in Melbourne.

Wong starred in "<a href="Bombs%20over%20Burma">Bombs over Burma</a>" (1942) and "<a href="Lady%20from%20Chungking">Lady from Chungking</a>" (1942), both <a href="anti-Japanese%20propaganda">anti-Japanese propaganda</a> made by the <a href="poverty%20row">poverty row</a> studio <a href="Producers%20Releasing%20Corporation">Producers Releasing Corporation</a>. She donated her salary for both films to United China Relief. "The Lady from Chungking" differed from the usual Hollywood war film in that the Chinese were portrayed as heroes rather than as victims rescued by Americans. Even after American characters are captured by the Japanese, the primary goal of the heroes is not to free the Americans, but to prevent the Japanese from entering the city of <a href="Chongqing">Chongqing</a> (Chungking). Also, in an interesting twist, the Chinese characters are portrayed by Chinese-American actors, while the Japanese villains – normally played by Chinese-American actors – are acted by European Americans. The film ends with Wong making a speech for the birth of a "new China". "The Hollywood Reporter" and "Variety" both gave Wong's performance in "The Lady from Chungking" positive reviews, but commented negatively on the film's plot.

Later in life, Wong invested in real estate and owned a number of properties in Hollywood. She converted her home on San Vicente Boulevard in <a href="Santa%20Monica">Santa Monica</a> into four apartments that she called "Moongate Apartments". She served as the apartment house manager from the late 1940s until 1956, when she moved in with her brother Richard on 21st Place in Santa Monica.

In 1949, Wong's father died in Los Angeles at the age of 91. After a six-year absence, Wong returned to film the same year with a small role in a B movie called "<a href="Impact%20%281949%20film%29">Impact</a>". From August 27 to November 21, 1951, Wong starred in a detective series that was written specifically for her, the <a href="DuMont%20Television%20Network">DuMont Television Network</a> series "<a href="The%20Gallery%20of%20Madame%20Liu-Tsong">The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong</a>", in which she played the title role that used her birth name. Wong's character was a dealer in <a href="Chinese%20art">Chinese art</a> whose career involved her in detective work and international intrigue. The ten half-hour episodes aired during <a href="prime%20time">prime time</a>, from 9:00 to 9:30 p.m. Although there were plans for a second season, DuMont canceled the show in 1952. No copies of the show or its scripts are known to exist. After the completion of the series, Wong's health began to deteriorate. In late 1953 she suffered an <a href="internal%20bleeding">internal hemorrhage</a>, which her brother attributed to the onset of <a href="menopause">menopause</a>, her continued heavy drinking, and financial worries.

In 1956, Wong hosted one of the first U.S. documentaries on China narrated entirely by a Chinese American. Broadcast on the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> travel series "<a href="Bold%20Journey">Bold Journey</a>", the program consisted of film footage from her 1936 trip to China. Wong also did guest spots on television series such as "<a href="Adventures%20in%20Paradise%20%28TV%20series%29">Adventures in Paradise</a>", "<a href="The%20Barbara%20Stanwyck%20Show">The Barbara Stanwyck Show</a>", and "<a href="The%20Life%20and%20Legend%20of%20Wyatt%20Earp">The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp</a>".

For her contribution to the film industry, Anna May Wong received a star at 1708 Vine Street on the inauguration of the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> in 1960. She is also depicted larger-than-life as one of the four supporting pillars of the "Gateway to Hollywood" sculpture located on the southeast corner of Hollywood Boulevard and La Brea Avenue, with the actresses <a href="Dolores%20del%20R%C3%ADo">Dolores del Río</a> (<a href="Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Hispanic American</a>), <a href="Dorothy%20Dandridge">Dorothy Dandridge</a> (<a href="African%20American">African American</a>), and <a href="Mae%20West">Mae West</a> (<a href="White%20American">White American</a>).

In 1960, Wong returned to film in "<a href="Portrait%20in%20Black">Portrait in Black</a>", starring <a href="Lana%20Turner">Lana Turner</a>. She still found herself stereotyped, with one press release explaining her long absence from films with a supposed proverb, which was claimed to have been passed down to Wong by her father: "Don't be photographed too much or you'll lose your soul", a quote that would be inserted into many of her obituaries.

Wong was scheduled to play the role of Madame Liang in the film production of <a href="Rodgers%20and%20Hammerstein">Rodgers and Hammerstein</a>'s "<a href="Flower%20Drum%20Song%20%28film%29">Flower Drum Song</a>", but was unable to take the role due to failing health. On February 3, 1961, at the age of 56, Wong died of a <a href="myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a> as she slept at home in Santa Monica, two days after her final screen performance on the television show "<a href="The%20Barbara%20Stanwyck%20Show">The Barbara Stanwyck Show</a>". Her cremated remains were interred in her mother's grave at <a href="Angelus-Rosedale%20Cemetery">Rosedale Cemetery</a> in Los Angeles. The headstone is marked with her mother's Anglicized name on top, the Chinese names of Anna May (on the right), and her sister Mary (on the left) along the sides.

Wong's image and career have left a notable legacy. Through her films, public appearances and prominent magazine features, she helped to humanize Chinese Americans to white audiences during a period of overt racism and discrimination. Chinese Americans had been viewed as perpetually foreign in U.S. society but Wong's films and public image established her as a Chinese-American citizen at a time when laws discriminated against Chinese immigration and citizenship. Wong's hybrid image dispelled contemporary notions that the East and West were inherently different.

Among Wong's films, only "Shanghai Express" retained critical attention in the U.S. in the decades after her death. In Europe and especially England, her films appeared occasionally at festivals. Wong remained popular with the gay community who often claimed her as one of their own and for whom her marginalization by the mainstream became a symbol. Although the Chinese Nationalist criticism of her portrayals of the "Dragon Lady" and "Butterfly" stereotypes lingered, she was forgotten in China. Nevertheless, the importance of Wong's legacy within the Asian-American film community can be seen in the Anna May Wong Award of Excellence, which is given yearly at the Asian-American Arts Awards; the annual award given out by the Asian Fashion Designers was also named after Wong in 1973.

For decades following her death, Wong's image remained as a symbol in literature as well as in film. In the 1971 poem "The Death of Anna May Wong", <a href="Jessica%20Hagedorn">Jessica Hagedorn</a> saw Wong's career as one of "tragic glamour" and portrayed the actress as a "fragile maternal presence, an Asian-American woman who managed to 'birth' however ambivalently, Asian-American screen women in the jazz age". Wong's character in "Shanghai Express" was the subject of <a href="John%20Yau">John Yau</a>'s 1989 poem "No One Ever Tried to Kiss Anna May Wong", which interprets the actress' career as a series of tragic romances. In <a href="David%20Cronenberg">David Cronenberg</a>'s <a href="M.%20Butterfly%20%28film%29">1993 film version</a> of <a href="David%20Henry%20Hwang">David Henry Hwang</a>'s 1986 play, "<a href="M.%20Butterfly">M. Butterfly</a>", Wong's image was used briefly as a symbol of a "tragic diva". Her life was the subject of "China Doll, The Imagined Life of an American Actress", an award-winning fictional play written by <a href="Elizabeth%20Wong%20%28playwright%29">Elizabeth Wong</a> in 1995.

As the centennial of Wong's birth approached, a re-examination of her life and career took shape; three major works on the actress appeared and comprehensive retrospectives of her films were held at both the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> and the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20the%20Moving%20Image">American Museum of the Moving Image</a> in New York City. Anthony Chan's 2003 biography, "Perpetually Cool: The Many Lives of Anna May Wong (1905–1961)", was the first major work on Wong and was written, Chan says, "from a uniquely Asian-American perspective and sensibility". In 2004, Philip Leibfried and <a href="Chei%20Mi%20Lane">Chei Mi Lane</a>'s exhaustive examination of Wong's career, "Anna May Wong: A Complete Guide to Her Film, Stage, Radio and Television Work" was published, as well as a second full-length biography, "Anna May Wong: From Laundryman's Daughter to Hollywood Legend" by Graham Russell Hodges. Though Anna May Wong's life, career, and legacy reflect many complex issues which remain decades after her death, Anthony Chan points out that her place in Asian-American cinematic history, as its first female star, is permanent. An illustrated biography for children, "Shining Star: The Anna May Wong Story", was published in 2009.

HMS Princess Royal (1911)

HMS "Princess Royal" was the second of two s built for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> before World War I. Designed in response to the s of the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a>, the ships significantly improved on the speed, armament, and armour of the preceding . The ship was named for The <a href="Princess%20Royal">Princess Royal</a>, a title occasionally granted to the Monarch's eldest daughter.

Laid down in 1912 and commissioned in 1913, "Princess Royal" served in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20%281914%29">Battle of Heligoland Bight</a> a month after the war began. She was then sent to the Caribbean to prevent the <a href="German%20East%20Asia%20Squadron">German East Asia Squadron</a> from using the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>. After the East Asia Squadron was sunk at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">Battle of the Falkland Islands</a> in December 1914, "Princess Royal" rejoined the <a href="1st%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Battlecruiser Squadron</a>. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a>, "Princess Royal" scored only a few hits, although one crippled the German <a href="armoured%20cruiser">armoured cruiser</a> . Shortly afterwards, she became the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the 1st Battlecruiser <a href="Squadron%20%28naval%29">Squadron</a>, under the command of <a href="Rear-Admiral">Rear-Admiral</a> <a href="Osmond%20Brock">Osmond Brock</a>.

"Princess Royal" was moderately damaged during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> and required a month and a half of repairs. Apart from providing distant support during the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20Bight">Second Battle of Heligoland Bight</a> in 1917, the ship spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols of the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. "Princess Royal" was placed into reserve in 1920, then was sold for <a href="ship%20breaking">breaking up</a> as <a href="scrap">scrap</a> in 1922 to meet the terms of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>.

The "Lion"-class battlecruisers, nicknamed the "Splendid Cats", were designed by <a href="Philip%20Watts%20%28naval%20architect%29">Philip Watts</a>, the <a href="Director%20of%20Naval%20Construction">Director of Naval Construction</a>, to be as superior to the new German battlecruisers of the "Moltke" class as the German ships were to the . The increase in speed, armour and gun size forced a 70% increase in size over the "Indefatigable" class and made them the largest warships in the world.

"Princess Royal" was significantly larger than her predecessors. She had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. The ship normally displaced and at deep load, over more than the earlier ships. She had a <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a> of at deep load.

"Princess Royal" had two paired sets of <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> direct-drive steam turbines housed in separate engine-rooms. Each set consisted of a high-pressure ahead-and-astern turbine driving an outboard shaft, and a low-pressure ahead-and-astern turbine driving an inner shaft. Designed power was for a speed of . In September 1912, "Princess Royal" began her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s and developed for a speed of . During maximum power trials in July 1913, the battlecruiser achieved for a speed of while at the unusually high displacement of .

The steam plant consisted of 42 <a href="Yarrow%20Shipbuilders">Yarrow</a> <a href="water-tube%20boiler%23Yarrow">large-tube boilers</a> arranged in seven boiler rooms. Maximum <a href="wikt%3Abunker">bunkerage</a> was of coal and an additional of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At , the ship's range was .

"Princess Royal" was armed with eight <a href="BL%2013.5%20inch%20/45%20naval%20gun">BL 13.5-inch Mk V guns</a> ("BL" for <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23BL">breech-loading</a>) in four twin hydraulically powered turrets, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q' and 'X' from bow to stern. Her secondary armament consisted of 16 <a href="BL%204%20inch%20naval%20gun%20Mk%20VII">BL 4-inch Mk VII guns</a>, most of which were mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s in the superstructure. The two guns mounted on the deck above the forward group of casemates were fitted with <a href="gun%20shield">gun shield</a>s in 1913 and 1914 to better protect their crews from enemy fire.

The battlecruiser was built without <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> (AA) guns, but from October 1914 to December 1916 she was fitted with a single <a href="QF%206%20pounder%20Hotchkiss">QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss</a> gun ("QF" for <a href="Quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing</a>) on a high-angle mount, which had a maximum depression of 8° and a maximum elevation of 60°. Its shell was fired at a muzzle velocity of and a rate of fire of 20 rounds per minute. It had a maximum ceiling of , but an effective range of only . A single <a href="QF%203%20inch%2020%20cwt">QF 3-inch 20 cwt</a> AA gun was added in January 1915 and carried until April 1917. Its high-angle mount had a maximum depression of 10° and a maximum elevation of 90°. The gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of 12 to 14 rounds per minute. It had a maximum effective ceiling of .

"Princess Royal" received a <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control director</a> between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire-control under the gunnery officer who now fired the guns. To align their guns on the target, the turret crewmen had to follow pointers whose position was transmitted from the director. This greatly increased accuracy as it was easier for the director to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the shell spread caused by the ship's roll as the turrets fired individually.

By early 1918, "Princess Royal" carried a <a href="Sopwith%20Pup">Sopwith Pup</a> and a <a href="Sopwith%201%C2%BD%20Strutter">Sopwith 1½ Strutter</a> on <a href="Flight%20deck%23Early%20flight%20decks">flying-off ramps</a> fitted on top of 'Q' and 'X' turrets. The Pup was intended to shoot down <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a>s while the 1½ Strutter was used for spotting and reconnaissance. Each platform had a canvas <a href="hangar">hangar</a> to protect the aircraft during inclement weather.

The armour protection given to "Lion" and "Princess Royal" was heavier than on the "Indefatigable"s. The waterline <a href="Belt%20armour">belt</a> of <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armour">Krupp cemented armour</a> measured thick amidships; this thinned to 4 inches towards the ships' ends, and did not reach the bow or stern. The upper armour <a href="strake">strake</a> had a maximum thickness of 6 inches over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to abreast of the end turrets. The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by of armour, except for the turret roofs which used . The thickness of the nickel steel deck ranged from . Nickel-steel <a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a>s thick were fitted abreast of the <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and shell rooms. The sides of the conning tower were thick. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> revealed a vulnerability to plunging shellfire, 1 inch of additional armour, weighing approximately , was added to the magazine crowns and turret roofs.

"Princess Royal" was laid down at the <a href="Vickers">Vickers</a> Shipyard in <a href="Barrow-in-Furness">Barrow-in-Furness</a> on 2 May 1910. She was launched on 29 April 1911 by <a href="Louise%2C%20Princess%20Royal%20and%20Duchess%20of%20Fife">Princess Louise, The Princess Royal</a>, and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 14 November 1912. She cost £1,955,922 plus an additional £120,300 for her armament. Upon commissioning, "Princess Royal" joined the 1st Cruiser Squadron, which was renamed the <a href="1st%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Battlecruiser Squadron</a> (BCS) in January 1913. Rear-Admiral <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">Beatty</a> assumed command of the 1st BCS on 1 March 1913. The squadron, including "Princess Royal", visited <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> in February 1914 and ports in Russia during June.

"Princess Royal" first saw combat during the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914. She was part of Admiral Beatty's battlecruiser force, which was originally to provide distant support to the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast if the German <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d in response. The battlecruisers headed south at full speed at <a href="12-hour%20clock">11:35 a.m.</a> when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule, as the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the <a href="Bar%20%28river%20morphology%29">bar</a> at the mouth of the <a href="Jade%20Estuary">Jade Estuary</a>. The British light cruiser had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the German light cruisers and when Beatty's battlecruisers appeared out of the mist at 12:37 p.m. "Strassburg" was able to duck into the mists and evade fire, but "Cöln" was quickly crippled by the squadron's guns. Before "Cöln" could be sunk, Beatty was distracted by the sudden appearance of the German light cruiser directly to his front, and ordered pursuit. "Ariadne" was reduced to a burning hulk after only three salvos at less than .

"Princess Royal" sailed from <a href="Cromarty">Cromarty</a> on 28 September to rendezvous with a Canadian troop convoy bound for the United Kingdom. She rejoined the 1st BCS on 26 October, but was detached again a few days later to reinforce the <a href="North%20America%20and%20West%20Indies%20Station">North Atlantic and Caribbean Squadrons</a> in the search for Admiral <a href="Maximilian%20von%20Spee">Graf Spee</a>'s German East Asia Squadron after it <a href="Battle%20of%20Coronel">destroyed the West Indies Squadron</a> on 1 November 1914. "Princess Royal" arrived at <a href="City%20of%20Halifax">Halifax</a> on 21 November, then spent several days off New York City before she steamed down to the Caribbean to guard against the possibility that Graf Spee would use the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>. The East Asia Squadron was <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">sunk off the Falkland Islands</a> on 7 December, and "Princess Royal" left <a href="Kingston%2C%20Jamaica">Kingston, Jamaica</a> to sail to the UK on 19 December.

On 23 January 1915 a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a> sortied to clear the <a href="Dogger%20Bank">Dogger Bank</a> of any British vessels that might be collecting intelligence on German movements. The British <a href="Room%2040">were reading the German coded messages</a>, and a large battlecruiser force under Admiral Beatty, aboard "Lion", sailed to intercept. Contact was initiated at 7:20 a.m. on the 24th, when the British light cruiser "Arethusa" spotted the German light cruiser . By 7:35, the Germans had seen Beatty's force; Hipper, aboard , ordered his ships south at , thinking that he could outpace any British battleships, and could increase to "Blücher"s maximum speed of if the pursuing ships were battlecruisers.

Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to catch the Germans before they could escape. The leading ships, "Lion", "Princess Royal" and , pursued at , and "Lion" opened fire at 8:52 at a range of . The other ships followed a few minutes later but the extreme range and decreasing visibility meant they did not start scoring hits until 9:09. The German battlecruisers opened fire two minutes later at a range of and concentrated their fire on "Lion", hitting her once. At 9:35, Beatty signalled to "engage the corresponding ships in the enemy's line", but "Tiger"s captain, believing that was already engaging "Blücher", fired at , as did "Lion", which left unengaged and able to fire on "Lion" without risk. "Moltke" and combined their fire to badly damage "Lion" over the next hour, even with "Princess Royal" attacking "Derfflinger".

Meanwhile, "Blücher" had been heavily damaged; her speed had dropped to , and her steering gear was jammed. Beatty ordered "Indomitable" to attack her at 10:48 a.m. Six minutes later, he spotted what he thought was a submarine <a href="periscope">periscope</a> on the starboard bow and ordered an immediate 90° turn to port to avoid the submarine, although the submarine warning flag was not raised because most of "Lion"s signal <a href="halyard">halyard</a>s had been shot away. Soon afterwards "Lion" lost her remaining dynamo to the rising water, which knocked out all remaining light and power. At 11:02, Beatty had flags hoisted signalling "course north-east", to bring his ships back to their pursuit of Hipper, and "attack the rear of the enemy". Rear-Admiral Sir <a href="Gordon%20Moore%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Gordon Moore</a>, temporarily commanding the squadron from , thought that the signals meant to attack "Blücher", which was about to the north-east, and ordered the four other battlecruisers away from the pursuit of Hipper's main force to engage. Beatty tried to correct the mistake, but he was so far behind the leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read in the smoke and haze.

Beatty transferred to the destroyer at 11:50 and set off in pursuit of his battlecruisers, reaching them shortly before "Blücher" sank. He boarded "Princess Royal" at 12:20 p.m. and ordered the ships to pursue the main German force. This order was rescinded when it became clear that the time wasted in sinking "Blücher" meant the rest of Hipper's battlecruisers would reach friendly waters before they could be caught. Beatty's battlecruisers turned for home, catching up to "Lion", which was limping along at .

"Princess Royal" hit "Derfflinger" once, but only damaged two armour plates and caused a coal bunker to flood. She hit "Blücher" at least twice, including the shot that crippled her, out of a total of 271 shells fired during the battle, a hit rate of only 0.7%. By way of contrast, her <a href="sister%20ship">sister</a> made four hits out of 243 shells fired, a rate of 1.6%. She also fired two 13.5-inch <a href="shrapnel%20shell">shrapnel shell</a>s at the German <a href="airship">airship</a> L5 as its crew attempted to bomb the sinking "Blücher", mistaking it for a British ship, despite the fact that the maximum elevation of those guns was only 20°. "Princess Royal" was not damaged during the battle.

On 31 May 1916, "Princess Royal" was the flagship of Rear-Admiral <a href="Osmond%20Brock">Osmond Brock</a> and the 1st BCS under Beatty's overall command; they had put to sea with the rest of the Battlecruiser Fleet to intercept a sortie by the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> into the North Sea. The British had decoded the German radio messages, and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 3:20 p.m., but Beatty's ships did not see the Germans to their east until 3:30. Two minutes later, Beatty ordered a course change to east south-east, positioning the British ships to cut off the Germans' line of retreat, and signalled <a href="action%20stations">action stations</a>. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn, Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, behind him. Beatty altered course to the east, as he was still too far north to cut Hipper off.

This began what was to be called the "Run to the South" as Beatty changed course to steer east south-east at 3:45, now paralleling Hipper's course less than away. The Germans opened fire first at 3:48, followed by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships, "Lion" and "Princess Royal", had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The two battlecruisers engaged , the leading German ship, while "Derfflinger" targeted "Princess Royal". The German fire was accurate from the start, with two hits on "Princess Royal" within the first three minutes. British gunnery was less effective; the range was incorrectly estimated as the German ships blended into the haze. "Princess Royal"s 'A' turret stopped working effectively early in the battle: the left gun was rendered inoperable when the breech pinion gear sheared, and the right gun misfired frequently. By 3:54, the range was down to ; Beatty ordered a course change two <a href="Boxing%20the%20compass">points</a> to starboard to open up the range at 3:57.

At 4:11 p.m. a torpedo fired by "Moltke" passed under "Princess Royal". Those aboard the British ship saw the torpedo's track, but incorrectly concluded that a <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a> was positioned on the opposite side of the British line (away from the German battlecruisers) and was firing towards both groups of ships. This false impression was compounded by reports of a periscope sighting by the destroyer . By this time, the distance between the British and German ships was too great for accurate fire, so Beatty altered course four points to port between 4:12 and 4:15, closing the range. This manoeuvre exposed "Lion" to the fire of the German battlecruisers, and the smoke from multiple successful hits caused "Derfflinger" to lose sight of "Princess Royal" and switch targets to at 4:16. By 4:25, the range was down to and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. Around this time, "Queen Mary" was hit multiple times in quick succession and her forward magazines exploded. At 4:30, the light cruiser , scouting in front of Beatty's ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed. Three minutes later, they sighted the topmasts of <a href="Vice-Admiral">Vice-Admiral</a> <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a>'s battleships, but did not report this to the fleet for another five minutes. Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting before ordering his force to turn north.

The German battlecruisers made their own turn north in pursuit, but Beatty's ships maintained full speed, and gradually moved out of range. The British battlecruisers turned north, then north-east, to try to rendezvous with the main body of the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>, and at 5:40 p.m. opened fire again on their German counterparts. Facing the setting sun, the Germans could not make out the British ships and turned away to the north-east at 5:47. Beatty gradually turned towards the east so his ships could cover the Grand Fleet as it deployed into battle formation, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading British division to manoeuvre away from the Germans. About 6:22, "Princess Royal" was hit by two shells fired by the battleship ; one of these disabled 'X' turret and the other penetrated the ship's side armour. By 6:35, Beatty was following the 3rd BCS as they were leading the Grand Fleet east-southeast, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their south-west. A few minutes earlier, Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° starboard turn, and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. At 6:44, Beatty turned his ships south-east, then south-southeast four minutes later, to find Hipper's force. He then ordered the two surviving ships of the 3rd BCS to take position astern of "New Zealand", while slowing to and altering course to the south. Beatty then ordered his ships to make a complete circle to stay within visual range of the Grand Fleet. At 6:55, Scheer ordered another 180° turn, which put the German ships on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet. However, the British had altered course to the south, allowing the Grand Fleet to <a href="Crossing%20the%20T">cross Scheer's "T"</a> and inflict damage on the leading German ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180° turn at 7:13, and successfully extricated the High Seas Fleet from the danger precipitated by his previous turn. About this time "Princess Royal" fired at the leading German battlecruiser for three minutes without result.

The British lost sight of the Germans until spotted smoke to the west-northwest at 8:05 p.m., then identified and engaged several German torpedo boats. Hearing the sound of gunfire, Beatty ordered his ships west, and spotted the German battlecruisers only away. "Inflexible" opened fire at 8:20, followed almost immediately by the rest of the battlecruisers. Shortly after 8:30, the <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s of Rear-Admiral Mauve's II Battle Squadron were spotted. The British battlecruisers and German pre-dreadnoughts exchanged fire; the Germans only fired a few times before turning away to the west because of poor visibility and the more accurate British gunnery, and disappeared into the mist around 8:40. Beatty's battlecruisers sailed south-southeast, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until the order to reverse course for home was given at 2:55 a.m.

Along with the rest of the battlecruisers, "Princess Royal" reached <a href="Rosyth%20Dockyard">Rosyth Dockyard</a> in Scotland on the morning of 2 June, and she immediately received temporary repairs over the next eight days. She then sailed for Plymouth, where permanent repairs were completed on 15 July, and returned to Rosyth by 21 July. "Princess Royal" was hit nine times during the battle—six times by "Derfflinger" during the "Run to the South", twice by "Markgraf" during the "Run to the North", and once by just after II Battle Squadron appeared—with 22 killed and 81 injured. The battlecruiser fired only 230 13.5-inch shells during the battle, as her visibility was often impaired by the funnel smoke and fires aboard "Lion". She was credited with three hits on "Lützow" and two on . A torpedo fired at the German pre-dreadnoughts failed to hit.

As the German High Seas Fleet was forbidden from taking any unnecessary risks, the majority of "Princess Royal"s post-Jutland activities consisted of uneventful patrols of the North Sea. On the evening of 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a deciphered message that the High Seas Fleet, minus the II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The Germans planned to bombard the port of <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a> on the 19th, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and 6 battlecruisers to their anticipated rendezvous in the North Sea; for fear that they had entered a minefield after was torpedoed, they turned north before turning south again. Scheer steered south-eastward pursuing a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the <a href="Harwich%20Force">Harwich Force</a> under Commodore <a href="Reginald%20Tyrwhitt">Tyrwhitt</a>. Realising their mistake, the Germans then set course for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off. Both the British and German fleets returned home; two British light cruisers, HMS "Nottingham" and had been sunk by submarines, and the German <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> had been damaged by a torpedo.

"Princess Royal" provided support for British light forces involved in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20Bight">Second Battle of Heligoland Bight</a> on 17 November 1917, but never came within range of any German ships. She sailed with the 1st BCS on 12 December after German destroyers sank seven ships of a Norway-bound convoy, including <a href="HMS%20Partridge%20%281916%29">HMS Partridge</a>, four naval trawlers and four cargo ships earlier that day, but the British were unable to intercept and returned to base the following day. "Princess Royal", along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, sortied on the afternoon of 23 April 1918 after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. However, the Germans were too far ahead of the British, and no shots were fired. Starting in July 1918, the Grand Fleet was affected by the <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">1918 flu pandemic</a>; at one point, "Princess Royal" lacked sufficient healthy crewmen to sail.

Following the <a href="Scuttling%20of%20the%20German%20fleet%20at%20Scapa%20Flow%23Surrender%20of%20the%20fleet">surrender of the High Seas Fleet</a> at the end of the war, "Princess Royal" and the 1st BCS made up part of the guard force at <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>. "Princess Royal" was reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet in April 1919. The battlecruiser was placed in reserve in 1920, and an attempt to sell her to Chile later that year was unsuccessful. She became the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief of the Scottish Coast on 22 February 1922. She was sold for scrap in December 1922 to meet the tonnage limitations set on the Royal Navy by the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>, and arrived at the <a href="ship%20breaking">breakers</a> on 13 August 1923.

Ketogenic diet

The ketogenic diet is a high-<a href="fat">fat</a>, adequate-<a href="protein">protein</a>, <a href="low-carbohydrate%20diet">low-carbohydrate diet</a> that in medicine is used primarily to treat difficult-to-control (refractory) <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a> in children. The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s. Normally, the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into <a href="glucose">glucose</a>, which is then transported around the body and is particularly important in <a href="Brain%20metabolism">fueling brain function</a>. However, if little carbohydrate remains in the diet, the <a href="liver">liver</a> converts <a href="triacylglycerol">fat</a> into <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s and <a href="ketone%20bodies">ketone bodies</a>. The ketone bodies pass into the brain and replace glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood, a state known as <a href="ketosis">ketosis</a>, leads to a reduction in the frequency of <a href="epileptic%20seizure">epileptic seizure</a>s. Around half of children and young people with epilepsy who have tried some form of this diet saw the number of seizures drop by at least half, and the effect persists even after discontinuing the diet. Some evidence indicates that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet, and that a less strict regimen, such as a modified <a href="Atkins%20diet">Atkins diet</a>, is similarly effective. Potential side effects may include <a href="constipation">constipation</a>, <a href="Hypercholesterolemia">high cholesterol</a>, growth slowing, <a href="acidosis">acidosis</a>, and <a href="Kidney%20stone%20disease">kidney stones</a>.

The original therapeutic diet for <a href="epilepsy%20in%20children">paediatric epilepsy</a> provides just enough protein for body growth and repair, and sufficient <a href="food%20energy">calories</a> to maintain the correct weight for age and height. The classic therapeutic ketogenic diet was developed for treatment of paediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used into the next decade, but its popularity waned with the introduction of effective <a href="anticonvulsant">anticonvulsant</a> medications. This classic ketogenic diet contains a 4:1 ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate. This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables, bread, pasta, grains, and sugar, while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts, cream, and butter. Most dietary fat is made of molecules called long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). However, <a href="medium-chain%20triglyceride">medium-chain triglyceride</a>s (MCTs)—made from fatty acids with shorter <a href="carbon%20chain">carbon chain</a>s than LCTs—are more ketogenic. A variant of the classic diet known as the MCT ketogenic diet uses a form of <a href="coconut%20oil">coconut oil</a>, which is rich in MCTs, to provide around half the calories. As less overall fat is needed in this variant of the diet, a greater proportion of carbohydrate and protein can be consumed, allowing a greater variety of food choices.

In the mid-1990s, Hollywood producer <a href="Jim%20Abrahams">Jim Abrahams</a>, whose son's severe epilepsy was effectively controlled by the diet, created the Charlie Foundation to promote it. Publicity included an appearance on NBC's <a href="Dateline%20NBC">"Dateline"</a> programme and "<a href="...First%20Do%20No%20Harm">...First Do No Harm</a>" (1997), a <a href="television%20movie">made-for-television film</a> starring <a href="Meryl%20Streep">Meryl Streep</a>. The foundation sponsored a multicentre research study, the results of which—announced in 1996—marked the beginning of renewed scientific interest in the diet.

Possible therapeutic uses for the ketogenic diet have been studied for many additional neurological disorders, some of which include: <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>, <a href="amyotrophic%20lateral%20sclerosis">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a>, <a href="autism">autism</a>, <a href="brain%20cancer">brain cancer</a>, headache, <a href="neurotrauma">neurotrauma</a>, pain, <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a>, and <a href="sleep%20disorder">sleep disorder</a>s.

<a href="Epilepsy">Epilepsy</a> is one of the most common <a href="neurology">neurological</a> disorders after <a href="stroke">stroke</a>, and affects around 50 million people worldwide. It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent, unprovoked <a href="seizure">seizure</a>s. These occur when <a href="cortex%20%28anatomy%29">cortical</a> <a href="neuron">neuron</a>s fire excessively, <a href="Hypersynchronization%20of%20electrophysiological%20activity%20in%20epilepsy">hypersynchronously</a>, or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be <a href="focal%20seizure">focal</a> (confined to one part of the brain) or <a href="generalised%20seizure">generalised</a> (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy can occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic <a href="syndrome">syndrome</a>s, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three <a href="anticonvulsant">anticonvulsant</a> drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas around 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include <a href="epilepsy%20surgery">epilepsy surgery</a>, <a href="vagus%20nerve%20stimulation">vagus nerve stimulation</a>, and the ketogenic diet.

The ketogenic diet is a <a href="Mainstream%23In%20science">mainstream</a> dietary therapy that was developed to reproduce the success and remove the limitations of the non-mainstream use of <a href="fasting">fasting</a> to treat epilepsy. Although popular in the 1920s and '30s, it was largely abandoned in favour of new anticonvulsant drugs. Most individuals with epilepsy can successfully control their seizures with medication. However, 20–30% fail to achieve such control despite trying a number of different drugs. For this group, and for children in particular, the diet has once again found a role in epilepsy management.

Physicians of <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a> treated diseases, including epilepsy, by altering their patients' diet. An early treatise in the <a href="Hippocratic%20Corpus">Hippocratic Corpus</a>, "<a href="On%20the%20Sacred%20Disease">On the Sacred Disease</a>", covers the disease; it dates from . Its author argued against the prevailing view that epilepsy was supernatural in origin and cure, and proposed that dietary therapy had a rational and physical basis. In the same collection, the author of "Epidemics" describes the case of a man whose epilepsy is cured as quickly as it had appeared, through complete abstinence of food and drink. The royal physician <a href="Erasistratus">Erasistratus</a> declared, "One inclining to epilepsy should be made to fast without mercy and be put on short rations." <a href="Galen">Galen</a> believed an "attenuating diet" might afford a cure in mild cases and be helpful in others.

The first modern study of fasting as a treatment for epilepsy was in France in 1911. Twenty epilepsy patients of all ages were "detoxified" by consuming a low-calorie vegetarian diet, combined with periods of fasting and purging. Two benefited enormously, but most failed to maintain compliance with the imposed restrictions. The diet improved the patients' mental capabilities, in contrast to their medication, <a href="potassium%20bromide">potassium bromide</a>, which dulled the mind.

Around this time, <a href="Bernarr%20Macfadden">Bernarr Macfadden</a>, an American exponent of <a href="physical%20culture">physical culture</a>, popularised the use of fasting to restore health. His disciple, the <a href="Osteopathic%20medicine%20in%20the%20United%20States">osteopathic physician</a> Dr. Hugh William Conklin of <a href="Battle%20Creek%2C%20Michigan">Battle Creek, Michigan</a>, began to treat his epilepsy patients by recommending fasting. Conklin conjectured that epileptic seizures were caused when a toxin, secreted from the <a href="Peyer%27s%20patches">Peyer's patches</a> in the intestines, was discharged into the bloodstream. He recommended a fast lasting 18 to 25 days to allow this toxin to dissipate. Conklin probably treated hundreds of epilepsy patients with his "water diet" and boasted of a 90% cure rate in children, falling to 50% in adults. Later analysis of Conklin's case records showed 20% of his patients achieved freedom from seizures and 50% had some improvement.

Conklin's fasting therapy was adopted by <a href="neurology">neurologists</a> in mainstream practice. In 1916, a Dr McMurray wrote to the "New York Medical Journal" claiming to have successfully treated epilepsy patients with a fast, followed by a starch- and sugar-free diet, since 1912. In 1921, prominent <a href="endocrinology">endocrinologist</a> Henry Rawle Geyelin reported his experiences to the <a href="American%20Medical%20Association">American Medical Association</a> convention. He had seen Conklin's success first-hand and had attempted to reproduce the results in 36 of his own patients. He achieved similar results despite only having studied the patients for a short time. Further studies in the 1920s indicated that seizures generally returned after the fast. <a href="Charles%20P.%20Howland">Charles P. Howland</a>, the parent of one of Conklin's successful patients and a wealthy New York corporate lawyer, gave his brother John Elias Howland a gift of $5,000 to study "the ketosis of starvation". As professor of paediatrics at <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital">Johns Hopkins Hospital</a>, John E. Howland used the money to fund research undertaken by neurologist <a href="Stanley%20Cobb">Stanley Cobb</a> and his assistant <a href="William%20G.%20Lennox">William G. Lennox</a>.

In 1921, Rollin Turner Woodyatt reviewed the research on diet and <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, <a href="beta-Hydroxybutyric%20acid">β-hydroxybutyrate</a>, <a href="acetoacetate">acetoacetate</a>, and <a href="acetone">acetone</a> (known collectively as <a href="ketone%20bodies">ketone bodies</a>), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Dr. Russell Morse Wilder, at the <a href="Mayo%20Clinic">Mayo Clinic</a>, built on this research and coined the term "ketogenic diet" to describe a diet that produced a high level of ketone bodies in the blood (<a href="ketonemia">ketonemia</a>) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.

Wilder's colleague, paediatrician Mynie Gustav Peterman, later formulated the classic diet, with a ratio of one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10–15 g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder of calories from fat. Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour, and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Joseph Barborka, Sr., also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were least likely to benefit from the diet, and the use of the ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.

During the 1920s and 1930s, when the only anticonvulsant drugs were the sedative <a href="Potassium%20bromide">bromides</a> (discovered 1857) and <a href="phenobarbital">phenobarbital</a> (1912), the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied. This changed in 1938 when <a href="H.%20Houston%20Merritt">H. Houston Merritt, Jr.</a> and <a href="Tracy%20Putnam">Tracy Putnam</a> discovered <a href="phenytoin">phenytoin</a> (Dilantin), and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs. With the introduction of <a href="sodium%20valproate">sodium valproate</a> in the 1970s, drugs were available to neurologists that were effective across a broad range of epileptic syndromes and seizure types. The use of the ketogenic diet, by this time restricted to difficult cases such as <a href="Lennox%E2%80%93Gastaut%20syndrome">Lennox–Gastaut syndrome</a>, declined further.

In the 1960s, <a href="medium-chain%20triglyceride">medium-chain triglyceride</a>s (MCTs) were found to produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the <a href="hepatic%20portal%20system">hepatic portal system</a> rather than the <a href="lymphatic%20system">lymphatic system</a>. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, <a href="Peter%20Huttenlocher">Peter Huttenlocher</a> devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on 12 children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.

The ketogenic diet achieved national media exposure in the US in October 1994, when NBC's <a href="Dateline%20NBC">"Dateline"</a> television programme reported the case of Charlie Abrahams, son of Hollywood producer <a href="Jim%20Abrahams">Jim Abrahams</a>. The two-year-old suffered from epilepsy that had remained uncontrolled by mainstream and alternative therapies. Abrahams discovered a reference to the ketogenic diet in an epilepsy guide for parents and brought Charlie to <a href="John%20M.%20Freeman%20%28neurologist%29">John M. Freeman</a> at <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital">Johns Hopkins Hospital</a>, which had continued to offer the therapy. Under the diet, Charlie's epilepsy was rapidly controlled and his developmental progress resumed. This inspired Abrahams to create the Charlie Foundation to promote the diet and fund research. A multicentre prospective study began in 1994, the results were presented to the American Epilepsy Society in 1996 and were published in 1998. There followed an explosion of scientific interest in the diet. In 1997, Abrahams produced a TV movie, "<a href="...First%20Do%20No%20Harm">...First Do No Harm</a>", starring Meryl Streep, in which a young boy's intractable epilepsy is successfully treated by the ketogenic diet.

By 2007, the ketogenic diet was available from around 75 centres in 45 countries, and less restrictive variants, such as the modified Atkins diet, were in use, particularly among older children and adults. The ketogenic diet was also under investigation for the treatment of a wide variety of disorders other than epilepsy.

The ketogenic diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50% in half of the patients who try it and by more than 90% in a third of patients. Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though experts recommend a trial of at least three months before assuming it has been ineffective. Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to benefit from the ketogenic diet than from trying another anticonvulsant drug. Some evidence indicates that adolescents and adults may also benefit from the diet.

Early studies reported high success rates; in one study in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a <a href="Cohort%20study">cohort</a> of patients recently treated by the physician (a <a href="retrospective%20study">retrospective study</a>) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from <a href="selection%20bias">selection bias</a>, as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a <a href="prospective%20cohort%20study">prospective cohort</a> (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as <a href="Intention%20to%20treat%20analysis">intent-to-treat analysis</a>).

Another difference between older and newer studies is that the type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment <a href="Protocol%20%28natural%20sciences%29">protocol</a> has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged <a href="fasting">fast</a>, designed to lose 5–10% <a href="body%20weight">body weight</a>, and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions. Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.

A study with an intent-to-treat prospective design was published in 1998 by a team from the <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital">Johns Hopkins Hospital</a> and followed-up by a report published in 2001. As with most studies of the ketogenic diet, no <a href="control%20group">control group</a> (patients who did not receive the treatment) was used. The study enrolled 150 children. After three months, 83% of them were still on the diet, 26% had experienced a good reduction in seizures, 31% had had an excellent reduction, and 3% were seizure-free. At 12 months, 55% were still on the diet, 23% had a good response, 20% had an excellent response, and 7% were seizure-free. Those who had discontinued the diet by this stage did so because it was ineffective, too restrictive, or due to illness, and most of those who remained were benefiting from it. The percentage of those still on the diet at two, three, and four years was 39%, 20%, and 12%, respectively. During this period, the most common reason for discontinuing the diet was because the children had become seizure-free or significantly better. At four years, 16% of the original 150 children had a good reduction in seizure frequency, 14% had an excellent reduction, and 13% were seizure-free, though these figures include many who were no longer on the diet. Those remaining on the diet after this duration were typically not seizure-free, but had had an excellent response.

It is possible to combine the results of several small studies to produce evidence that is stronger than that available from each study alone—a statistical method known as <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a>. One of four such analyses, conducted in 2006, looked at 19 studies on a total of 1,084 patients. It concluded that a third achieved an excellent reduction in seizure frequency and half the patients achieved a good reduction.

A <a href="Cochrane%20%28organisation%29">Cochrane</a> systematic review in 2018 found and analysed eleven randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet in people with epilepsy for whom drugs failed to control their seizures. Six of the trials compared a group assigned to a ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable. In the largest trial of the ketogenic diet with a non-diet control, nearly 38% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared 6% with the group not assigned to the diet. Two large trials of the Modified Atkins Diet compared to a non-diet control had similar results, with over 50% of children having half or fewer seizures with the diet compared to around 10% in the control group.

A systematic review in 2018 looked at 16 studies on the ketogenic diet in adults. It concluded that the treatment was becoming more popular for that group of patients, that the efficacy in adults was similar to children, the side effects relatively mild. However, many patients gave up with the diet, for various reasons, and the quality of evidence inferior to studies on children. Health issues include high levels of <a href="low-density%20lipoprotein">low-density lipoprotein</a>, high total <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a>, and <a href="weight%20loss">weight loss</a>.

The ketogenic diet is indicated as an adjunctive (additional) treatment in children and young people with <a href="drug-resistant%20epilepsy">drug-resistant epilepsy</a>. It is approved by national <a href="Medical%20guideline">clinical guidelines</a> in Scotland, England, and Wales and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies. Children with a focal <a href="lesion">lesion</a> (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for <a href="epilepsy%20surgery">surgery</a> are more likely to become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet. About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants—the low <a href="glycaemic%20index">glycaemic index</a> treatment and the modified Atkins diet—to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults. A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are <a href="feeding%20tube">tube-fed</a>.

Advocates for the diet recommend that it be seriously considered after two medications have failed, as the chance of other drugs succeeding is only 10%. The diet can be considered earlier for some epilepsy and genetic syndromes where it has shown particular usefulness. These include <a href="Dravet%20syndrome">Dravet syndrome</a>, <a href="infantile%20spasms">infantile spasms</a>, <a href="myoclonic-astatic%20epilepsy">myoclonic-astatic epilepsy</a>, and <a href="tuberous%20sclerosis%20complex">tuberous sclerosis complex</a>.

A survey in 2005 of 88 paediatric neurologists in the US found that 36% regularly prescribed the diet after three or more drugs had failed, 24% occasionally prescribed the diet as a last resort, 24% had only prescribed the diet in a few rare cases, and 16% had never prescribed the diet. Several possible explanations exist for this gap between <a href="Evidence-based%20medicine">evidence</a> and clinical practice. One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained <a href="dietitian">dietitian</a>s, who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme.

Because the ketogenic diet alters the body's metabolism, it is a <a href="first-line%20therapy">first-line therapy</a> in children with certain <a href="congenital%20metabolic%20disease">congenital metabolic disease</a>s such as <a href="Pyruvate%20dehydrogenase%20deficiency">pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency</a> and <a href="De%20Vivo%20disease">glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome</a>, which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication. However, it is absolutely <a href="contraindication">contraindicated</a> in the treatment of other diseases such as <a href="pyruvate%20carboxylase%20deficiency">pyruvate carboxylase deficiency</a>, <a href="porphyria">porphyria</a>, and other rare <a href="Inborn%20errors%20of%20lipid%20metabolism">genetic disorders of fat metabolism</a>. Persons with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation are unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their bodies would consume their own protein stores for fuel, leading to <a href="ketoacidosis">ketoacidosis</a>, and eventually coma and death.

The ketogenic diet is usually initiated in combination with the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. Some evidence of synergistic benefits is seen when the diet is combined with the <a href="vagus%20nerve%20stimulation">vagus nerve stimulator</a> or with the drug <a href="zonisamide">zonisamide</a>, and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving <a href="phenobarbital">phenobarbital</a>.

The ketogenic diet is not a benign, holistic, or natural treatment for epilepsy; as with any serious medical therapy, complications may result. These are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery. Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include <a href="constipation">constipation</a>, low-grade <a href="acidosis">acidosis</a>, and <a href="hypoglycaemia">hypoglycaemia</a> if an initial fast is undertaken. <a href="Hyperlipidemia">Raised levels of lipids in the blood</a> affect up to 60% of children and <a href="Hypercholesterolemia">cholesterol levels may increase</a> by around 30%. This can be treated by changes to the fat content of the diet, such as from saturated fats towards polyunsaturated fats, and if persistent, by lowering the ketogenic ratio. Supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many <a href="micronutrient">micronutrient</a>s.

Long-term use of the ketogenic diet in children increases the risk of slowed or stunted growth, bone fractures, and <a href="kidney%20stone">kidney stone</a>s. The diet reduces levels of <a href="insulin-like%20growth%20factor%201">insulin-like growth factor 1</a>, which is important for childhood growth. Like many anticonvulsant drugs, the ketogenic diet has an adverse effect on bone health. Many factors may be involved such as acidosis and suppressed growth hormone. About one in 20 children on the ketogenic diet develop kidney stones (compared with one in several thousand for the general population). A class of anticonvulsants known as <a href="carbonic%20anhydrase%20inhibitors">carbonic anhydrase inhibitors</a> (<a href="topiramate">topiramate</a>, <a href="zonisamide">zonisamide</a>) are known to increase the risk of kidney stones, but the combination of these anticonvulsants and the ketogenic diet does not appear to elevate the risk above that of the diet alone. The stones are treatable and do not justify discontinuation of the diet. Johns Hopkins Hospital now gives oral <a href="potassium%20citrate">potassium citrate</a> supplements to all ketogenic diet patients, resulting in one-seventh of the incidence of kidney stones. However, this empiric usage has not been tested in a prospective controlled trial. Kidney stone formation (nephrolithiasis) is associated with the diet for four reasons:

In adolescent and adults, common side effects reported include weight loss, constipation, <a href="dyslipidemia">dyslipidemia</a>, and in women, <a href="dysmenorrhea">dysmenorrhea</a>.

The ketogenic diet is a <a href="medical%20nutrition%20therapy">medical nutrition therapy</a> that involves participants from various disciplines. Team members include a registered paediatric <a href="dietitian">dietitian</a> who coordinates the diet programme; a paediatric <a href="neurologist">neurologist</a> who is experienced in offering the ketogenic diet; and a <a href="registered%20nurse">registered nurse</a> who is familiar with childhood epilepsy. Additional help may come from a <a href="medical%20social%20worker">medical social worker</a> who works with the family and a <a href="pharmacist">pharmacist</a> who can advise on the carbohydrate content of medicines. Lastly, the parents and other caregivers must be educated in many aspects of the diet for it to be safely implemented.

Implementing the diet can present difficulties for caregivers and the patient due to the time commitment involved in measuring and planning meals. Since any unplanned eating can potentially break the nutritional balance required, some people find the discipline needed to maintain the diet challenging and unpleasant. Some people terminate the diet or switch to a less demanding diet, like the modified Atkins diet or the low-glycaemic index treatment diet, because they find the difficulties too great.

The Johns Hopkins Hospital protocol for initiating the ketogenic diet has been widely adopted. It involves a consultation with the patient and their caregivers and, later, a short hospital admission. Because of the risk of complications during ketogenic diet initiation, most centres begin the diet under close medical supervision in the hospital.

At the initial consultation, patients are <a href="screening%20%28medicine%29">screened</a> for conditions that may <a href="contraindicate">contraindicate</a> the diet. A dietary <a href="medical%20history">history</a> is obtained and the parameters of the diet selected: the ketogenic ratio of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate, the calorie requirements and the fluid intake.

The day before admission to hospital, the proportion of carbohydrate in the diet may be decreased and the patient begins fasting after his or her evening meal. On admission, only calorie- and caffeine-free fluids are allowed until dinner, which consists of "<a href="eggnog">eggnog</a>" restricted to one-third of the typical calories for a meal. The following breakfast and lunch are similar, and on the second day, the "eggnog" dinner is increased to two-thirds of a typical meal's caloric content. By the third day, dinner contains the full calorie quota and is a standard ketogenic meal (not "eggnog"). After a ketogenic breakfast on the fourth day, the patient is discharged. Where possible, the patient's current medicines are changed to carbohydrate-free formulations.

When in the hospital, <a href="blood%20sugar">glucose levels</a> are checked several times daily and the patient is monitored for signs of symptomatic <a href="ketosis">ketosis</a> (which can be treated with a small quantity of orange juice). Lack of energy and lethargy are common, but disappear within two weeks. The parents attend classes over the first three full days, which cover nutrition, managing the diet, preparing meals, avoiding sugar, and handling illness. The level of parental education and commitment required is higher than with medication.

Variations on the Johns Hopkins protocol are common. The initiation can be performed using <a href="outpatient">outpatient</a> clinics rather than requiring a stay in hospital. Often, no initial fast is used (fasting increases the risk of <a href="metabolic%20acidosis">acidosis</a>, hypoglycaemia, and weight loss). Rather than increasing meal sizes over the three-day initiation, some institutions maintain meal size, but alter the ketogenic ratio from 2:1 to 4:1.

For patients who benefit, half achieve a seizure reduction within five days (if the diet starts with an initial fast of one to two days), three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks, and 90% achieve a reduction within 23 days. If the diet does not begin with a fast, the time for half of the patients to achieve an improvement is longer (two weeks), but the long-term seizure reduction rates are unaffected. Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet for at least three months before any final consideration is made regarding efficacy.

After initiation, the child regularly visits the hospital outpatient clinic where they are seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital <a href="dietitian">dietitian</a> and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. <a href="ketonuria">Urinary ketone levels</a> are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using ketone test strips containing <a href="nitroprusside">nitroprusside</a>, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).

A short-lived increase in seizure frequency may occur during illness or if <a href="ketone">ketone</a> levels fluctuate. The diet may be modified if seizure frequency remains high, or the child is losing weight. Loss of seizure-control may come from unexpected sources. Even "sugar-free" food can contain carbohydrates such as <a href="maltodextrin">maltodextrin</a>, <a href="sorbitol">sorbitol</a>, <a href="starch">starch</a>, and <a href="fructose">fructose</a>. The sorbitol content of suntan lotion and other skincare products may be high enough for some to be absorbed through the skin and thus negate ketosis.

About 20% of children on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether. Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or after six months of being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions. This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure-free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.

Children who discontinue the diet after achieving seizure freedom have about a 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable, but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where part of the brain is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those who have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an <a href="electroencephalogram">electroencephalogram</a> shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an <a href="MRI%20scan">MRI scan</a> shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with <a href="tuberous%20sclerosis">tuberous sclerosis</a>). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.

The ketogenic diet is calculated by a <a href="dietitian">dietitian</a> for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture, and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children or those with muscle <a href="spasticity">spasticity</a> require more food energy than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18 months, older than 12 years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9 kcal/g (38 kJ/g) compared to 4 kcal/g (17 kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1 g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or <a href="dietary%20supplement">supplements</a> must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein, and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.

A computer program such as KetoCalculator may be used to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: <a href="cream">heavy whipping cream</a>, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil, or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas, and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned, or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic <a href="weighing%20scale">scale</a> accurate to 1 g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil may be used to help with constipation or to increase ketosis.

The classic ketogenic diet is not a <a href="balanced%20diet">balanced diet</a> and only contains tiny portions of fresh fruit and vegetables, <a href="Food%20fortification">fortified</a> cereals, and calcium-rich foods. In particular, the <a href="B%20vitamins">B vitamins</a>, <a href="calcium">calcium</a>, and <a href="vitamin%20D">vitamin D</a> must be artificially supplemented. This is achieved by taking two sugar-free supplements designed for the patient's age: a <a href="multivitamin">multivitamin</a> with <a href="Dietary%20mineral">minerals</a> and <a href="calcium">calcium</a> with vitamin D. A typical day of food for a child on a 4:1 ratio, 1,500 kcal (6,300 kJ) ketogenic diet comprises three small meals and three small snacks:
Normal dietary fat contains mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). <a href="Medium-chain%20triglycerides">Medium-chain triglycerides</a> (MCTs) are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones per unit of energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and a greater proportion of protein and carbohydrate, leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes. The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil. Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant. The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by <a href="health%20insurance">insurance companies</a>.

First reported in 2003, the idea of using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (about 1:1) does not need to be consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10 g per day in children or 20 g per day in adults, and are increased to 20–30 g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.

The modified Atkins diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50% in 43% of patients who try it and by more than 90% in 27% of patients. Few adverse effects have been reported, though cholesterol is increased and the diet has not been studied long term. Although based on a smaller data set (126 adults and children from 11 studies over five centres), these results from 2009 compare favourably with the traditional ketogenic diet.

The low glycaemic index treatment (LGIT) is an attempt to achieve the stable <a href="blood%20glucose">blood glucose</a> levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose may be one of the mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet, which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content. Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat), the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40–60 g per day. However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a glycaemic index lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.

Short-term results for the LGIT indicate that at one month approximately half of the patients experience a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, with overall figures approaching that of the ketogenic diet. The data (coming from one centre's experience with 76 children up to the year 2009) also indicate fewer side effects than the ketogenic diet and that it is better tolerated, with more palatable meals.

Infants and patients fed via a <a href="Feeding%20tube">gastrostomy tube</a> can also be given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a <a href="Medical%20prescription">prescribed</a> powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed. Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula. Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a> than a solid ketogenic diet. KetoCal is a <a href="Enteral%20formula">nutritionally complete food</a> containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding. Other formula products include KetoVolve and Ketonia. Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.

There are theoretically no restrictions on where the ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants. However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues. A culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, it can be difficult to separate the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory so calculating the proportions of fat, protein and carbohydrate is difficult. In some countries, it may be hard to find sugar-free forms of medicines and supplements, to purchase an accurate electronic scale, or to afford MCT oils.

In Asia, the normal diet includes rice and noodles as the main energy source, making their elimination difficult. Therefore, the MCT-oil form of the diet, which allows more carbohydrate, has proved useful. In India, religious beliefs commonly affect the diet: some patients are vegetarians, will not eat root vegetables or avoid beef. The Indian ketogenic diet is started without a fast due to cultural opposition towards fasting in children. The low-fat, high-carbohydrate nature of the normal Indian and Asian diet means that their ketogenic diets typically have a lower ketogenic ratio (1:1) than in America and Europe. However, they appear to be just as effective.

In many developing countries, the ketogenic diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat are more expensive than grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet has been proposed as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.

The brain is composed of a network of <a href="Neurotransmission">neurons that transmit signals</a> by propagating <a href="nerve%20impulse">nerve impulse</a>s. The propagation of this impulse from one neuron to another is typically controlled by <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a>s, though there are also <a href="Electrical%20synapse">electrical pathways</a> between some neurons. Neurotransmitters can inhibit impulse firing (primarily done by <a href="Gamma-Aminobutyric%20acid">γ-aminobutyric acid</a>, or GABA) or they can excite the neuron into firing (primarily done by <a href="glutamate">glutamate</a>). A neuron that releases inhibitory neurotransmitters from its terminals is called an inhibitory neuron, while one that releases excitatory neurotransmitters is an excitatory neuron. When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in all or part of the brain, a seizure can occur. The GABA system is an important target for anticonvulsant drugs, since seizures may be discouraged by increasing GABA synthesis, decreasing its breakdown, or enhancing its effect on neurons.

The nerve impulse is characterised by a great influx of sodium ions through <a href="Voltage-gated%20sodium%20channel">channels</a> in the neuron's <a href="cell%20membrane">cell membrane</a> followed by an efflux of potassium ions through other channels. The neuron is unable to fire again for a short time (known as the <a href="Refractory%20period%20%28physiology%29">refractory period</a>), which is mediated by another <a href="Calcium-activated%20potassium%20channel">potassium channel</a>. The flow through these <a href="ion%20channel">ion channel</a>s is governed by a "gate" which is opened by either a voltage change or a <a href="Ligand-gated%20ion%20channel">chemical messenger</a> known as a <a href="Ligand%20%28biochemistry%29">ligand</a> (such as a neurotransmitter). These channels are another target for anticonvulsant drugs.

There are many ways in which epilepsy occurs. Examples of pathological physiology include: unusual excitatory connections within the neuronal network of the brain; abnormal neuron structure leading to altered current flow; decreased inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis; ineffective receptors for inhibitory neurotransmitters; insufficient breakdown of excitatory neurotransmitters leading to excess; immature synapse development; and impaired function of ionic channels.

Although many hypotheses have been put forward to explain how the ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include <a href="Metabolic%20acidosis">systemic acidosis</a> (high levels of acid in the blood), <a href="Electrolyte%20disturbance">electrolyte changes</a> and <a href="hypoglycaemia">hypoglycaemia</a> (low <a href="blood%20glucose">blood glucose</a>). Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.

On the ketogenic diet, carbohydrates are restricted and so cannot provide for all the metabolic needs of the body. Instead, fatty acids are used as the major source of fuel. These are used through <a href="fatty%20acid%20metabolism">fatty-acid oxidation</a> in the cell's <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a> (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans can convert some <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s into glucose by a process called <a href="gluconeogenesis">gluconeogenesis</a>, but cannot do this by using fatty acids. Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues, these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This could pose a problem for the brain, since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most fatty acids do not cross the <a href="blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier">blood–brain barrier</a>. However, the liver can use long-chain fatty acids to synthesise the three <a href="ketone%20bodies">ketone bodies</a> <a href="beta-Hydroxybutyric%20acid">β-hydroxybutyrate</a>, <a href="acetoacetate">acetoacetate</a> and <a href="acetone">acetone</a>. These ketone bodies enter the brain and "partially" substitute for <a href="blood%20glucose">blood glucose</a> as a source of energy.

The ketone bodies are possibly anticonvulsant; in <a href="animal%20model">animal model</a>s, acetoacetate and acetone protect against seizures. The ketogenic diet results in adaptive changes to brain energy metabolism that increase the energy reserves; ketone bodies are a more efficient fuel than glucose, and the number of mitochondria is increased. This may help the <a href="neuron">neuron</a>s to remain stable in the face of increased energy demand during a seizure, and may confer a <a href="neuroprotective">neuroprotective</a> effect.

The ketogenic diet has been studied in at least 14 rodent animal models of seizures. It is protective in many of these models and has a different protection profile than any known anticonvulsant. Conversely, <a href="fenofibrate">fenofibrate</a>, not used clinically as an antiepileptic, exhibits experimental <a href="anticonvulsant">anticonvulsant</a> properties in adult rats comparable to the ketogenic diet. This, together with studies showing its efficacy in patients who have failed to achieve seizure control on half a dozen drugs, suggests a unique mechanism of action.

Anticonvulsants suppress epileptic seizures, but they neither cure nor prevent the development of seizure susceptibility. The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) is a process that is poorly understood. A few anticonvulsants (<a href="valproate">valproate</a>, <a href="levetiracetam">levetiracetam</a> and <a href="benzodiazepine">benzodiazepine</a>s) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The ketogenic diet has been found to have antiepileptogenic properties in rats.

The ketogenic diet has been studied for potential therapeutic use in various neurological disorders other than epilepsy: <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a> (AD), <a href="amyotrophic%20lateral%20sclerosis">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a> (ALS), <a href="autism">autism</a>, headache, <a href="neurotrauma">neurotrauma</a>, pain, <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a> (PD) and <a href="sleep%20disorder">sleep disorder</a>s.

Because some cancer cells are <a href="Warburg%20effect%20%28oncology%29">inefficient in processing ketone bodies for energy</a>, the ketogenic diet has also been suggested as a treatment for cancer. A 2018 review looked at the evidence from preclinical and clinical studies of ketogenic diets in cancer therapy. The clinical studies in humans are typically very small, with some providing weak evidence for anti-tumour effect, particularly for <a href="glioblastoma">glioblastoma</a>, but in other cancers and studies, no anti-tumour effect was seen. Taken together, results from preclinical studies, albeit sometimes contradictory, tend to support an anti-tumor effect rather than a pro-tumor effect of the KD for most solid cancers.

The evidence of benefit for these conditions has not reached the level where clinical recommendations can be made.

Theoren Fleury

Theoren Wallace "Theo" Fleury (born June 29, 1968) is a <a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> former professional <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> player. Fleury played for the <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a>, <a href="Colorado%20Avalanche">Colorado Avalanche</a>, <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a>, and <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a> of the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL), <a href="Tappara">Tappara</a> of <a href="Finland">Finland</a>'s <a href="SM-liiga">SM-liiga</a>, and the <a href="Belfast%20Giants">Belfast Giants</a> of the <a href="UK">UK</a>'s <a href="Elite%20Ice%20Hockey%20League">Elite Ice Hockey League</a>. He was drafted by the Flames in the 8th round, 166th overall, at the <a href="1987%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1987 NHL Entry Draft</a>, and played over <a href="List%20of%20National%20Hockey%20League%20players%20with%201000%20games%20played">1,000 games</a> in the NHL between 1989 and 2003.

One of the smallest players of his generation, Fleury played a physical style that often led to altercations. As a <a href="junior%20ice%20hockey">junior</a>, he was at the centre of the infamous <a href="Punch-up%20in%20Piestany">Punch-up in Piestany</a>, a brawl that resulted in the disqualification of both Canada and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> from the <a href="1987%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships</a>. Once considered unlikely to play in the NHL due to his small size, Fleury scored over <a href="List%20of%20National%20Hockey%20League%20players%20with%201000%20points">1,000 points</a> in his career, placing him 61st in career NHL scoring and won the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> in <a href="1989%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1989</a> with the Flames. During his career Fleury recorded 90+ points four times, and 100+ points twice. He twice represented Canada at the <a href="Winter%20Olympics">Winter Olympics</a>, winning a gold medal in <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%202002%20Winter%20Olympics">2002</a>. Throughout his career, he battled drug and alcohol <a href="addiction">addiction</a>s that ultimately forced him out of the NHL in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20NHL%20season">2003</a>. He played one season in the British Elite Ice Hockey League in <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20EIHL%20season">2005–06</a>, and made two attempts to win the <a href="Allan%20Cup">Allan Cup</a>. After an unsuccessful NHL comeback attempt with the Flames, he retired in 2009.

Outside of hockey, Fleury overcame his addictions, operated a concrete business in Calgary with his family, and filmed a <a href="television%20pilot">pilot</a> for a <a href="reality%20television">reality television</a> show about it. He marketed his own brand of clothing, which led him to play two professional <a href="baseball">baseball</a> games for the <a href="Calgary%20Vipers">Calgary Vipers</a> of the <a href="Golden%20Baseball%20League">Golden Baseball League</a>. In 1995, he was diagnosed with <a href="Crohn%27s%20disease">Crohn's disease</a>, and his annual charity golf tournament has helped raise more than $1 million for the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada.

Fleury co-wrote "<a href="Playing%20with%20Fire%20%28Fleury%20book%29">Playing with Fire</a>", a best-selling <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a> released in October 2009, in which he revealed that he had been sexually abused by former coach <a href="Graham%20James%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Graham James</a>. Fleury filed a criminal complaint against James, who subsequently pleaded guilty to charges of sexual assault. Fleury has since become an <a href="advocate">advocate</a> for sexual abuse victims and developed a career as a <a href="public%20speaker">public speaker</a>. He was a recipient of the <a href="Indspire%20Awards">Indspire Award</a> in the sports category in 2013. Additionally, Theoren hosts the “Theo Fleury 14 Hockey Camp” which helps to teach, inspire and educate young hockey players ages 6 to 16. Moreover, Fleury travelled to Vancouver in 2013 where he assisted and co-hosted the 19th Annual Aboriginal Achievement Awards.

Fleury was born on June 29, 1968, in <a href="Oxbow%2C%20Saskatchewan">Oxbow, Saskatchewan</a>, the first of Wally and Donna Fleury's three sons. Wally was a hockey player whose dreams of a professional career ended when he broke his leg playing baseball in the summer of 1963; the injury helped fuel a drinking problem. Donna was a quiet, religious woman who battled drug addiction for many years. Fleury is of <a href="M%C3%A9tis%20people%20%28Canada%29">Métis</a> heritage, as his grandmother Mary was <a href="Cree">Cree</a>. Fleury was subject to racism for being of the Metis descent throughout his playing career. The Fleurys lived in <a href="Williams%20Lake%2C%20British%20Columbia">Williams Lake, British Columbia</a>, for four years, a period that saw Theo's brother Ted born in 1970, before settling in <a href="Russell%2C%20Manitoba">Russell, Manitoba</a>, by 1973, the year his youngest brother Travis was born. Wally worked as a truck driver and maintenance worker at the arena in Russell. Fleury and his family shared a passion for music. One of his fondest memories when he was a child was listening to his grandfather play the fiddle. Fleury's dad was a talented man who could play a variety of instruments, such as the piano and guitar. This passion for music brought happiness and joy to Theoren and his family as it was a part of their Metis heritage growing up.

Always one of the smallest children in his class and without stable supervision at home, Fleury adopted an aggressive posture and later described himself as a <a href="bullying">bully</a>. He turned to hockey as an outlet when he borrowed an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five. From that point on, he played hockey at every opportunity, often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre-dawn hours. He was described by his teachers as a determined youth, who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right.

Although his mother was a <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witness</a>, Fleury was raised as a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>. He attended mass from age 6 to 12, serving as an altar boy until the church's priest died of a heart attack, depriving Fleury of one of his earliest positive influences. Always lacking money and a stable home, Fleury received support from the community, in particular the Peltz family in Russell, who ensured that he and his brothers were fed and bought them new clothes when required. In January 1982, Fleury's dreams of playing in the NHL nearly ended at the age of 13 when, during a game, he suffered a deep cut under his arm that severed his <a href="brachial%20artery">brachial artery</a>. He missed nearly a year of contact hockey as a result. Five months after the incident, the community raised money to send him to the <a href="Andy%20Murray%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Andy Murray</a> Hockey School in <a href="Brandon%2C%20Manitoba">Brandon, Manitoba</a>. It was there that Fleury met <a href="Graham%20James%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Graham James</a>, who was working as a scout for the <a href="Winnipeg%20Warriors">Winnipeg Warriors</a> of the <a href="Western%20Hockey%20League">Western Hockey League</a> (WHL). James told Fleury that he had the skill to play in the NHL despite his size, and promised to recruit him to play junior hockey for the Warriors when he was old enough.

Fleury began his junior career in 1983–84 as a 15-year-old with the <a href="St.%20James%20Canadians">St. James Canadians</a> of the <a href="Manitoba%20Junior%20Hockey%20League">Manitoba Junior Hockey League</a>, scoring 33 <a href="goal%20%28ice%20hockey%29">goals</a> and 64 <a href="point%20%28ice%20hockey%29">points</a> in 22 games, an incredible pace of nearly three points per game. In <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20WHL%20season">1984–85</a> he moved to the <a href="Moose%20Jaw%20Warriors">Moose Jaw Warriors</a>, who had just relocated from <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>, scoring 29 goals and 75 points in 71 games as a 16-year-old. He improved his totals in each of his four years in the WHL, culminating with a 68-goal, 92-<a href="assist%20%28ice%20hockey%29">assist</a> season in <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20WHL%20season">1987–88</a>. Fleury's 160 points tied him for the league lead with <a href="Joe%20Sakic">Joe Sakic</a>, and the two players shared the <a href="Bob%20Clarke%20Trophy">Bob Clarke Trophy</a> as the WHL's top scorers. Fleury's 92 assists and 160 points remain team records; he also holds the Warriors' career records for goals (201), assists (271) and points (472). , he remains 10th all-time in WHL scoring.

Always one of the smallest players in the game, Fleury learned early that he had to play an unpredictable style of game to survive against players much larger than he was. He found that the best way to protect himself was to intimidate his opponents by playing a feisty, physical game, which he said led to many retaliatory penalties and several arguments with his coaches. He recorded 235 minutes in <a href="Penalty%20%28ice%20hockey%29">penalties</a> in his final year of junior, nearly 100 more than any of the other top 10 WHL scorers. Fleury retained this style of play throughout his hockey career, routinely surprising opponents who felt their size was an advantage.
Fleury twice represented <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">Canada</a> at the <a href="IIHF%20World%20U20%20Championship">World Junior Hockey Championships</a>. He first joined the team for the <a href="1987%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1987 tournament</a> in <a href="Pie%C5%A1%C5%A5any">Piešťany</a>, <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>. The tournament is best remembered for the "<a href="Punch-up%20in%20Piestany">Punch-up in Piestany</a>" on January 4, 1987, an infamous <a href="bench-clearing%20brawl">bench-clearing brawl</a> between the Canadians and the <a href="Soviet%20Union%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Soviet Union</a>. Fleury scored the first goal of the game and, as part of his celebration, used his stick to mimic firing a <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a> at the Soviet bench, a move that was criticized by Canadian officials. The brawl began early in the second period with Canada leading 4–2, when Pavel Kostichkin slashed Fleury, leading to a fight between the two. It quickly escalated into a <a href="line%20brawl">line brawl</a> involving all skaters on the ice, after which the Soviet players left their bench, followed closely by the Canadians. Both teams were disqualified from the tournament, costing Fleury and the Canadians a medal -– potentially the gold.

The <a href="International%20Ice%20Hockey%20Federation">International Ice Hockey Federation</a> suspended all players involved in the brawl from participating in international tournaments for 18 months, though the bans were later reduced to 6 months on appeal. This reduction allowed Fleury to participate in the <a href="1988%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1988 tournament</a> in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>. He was named captain, finished second in team scoring with eight points in seven games, and was named a tournament all-star as Canada won the gold medal.

Although he scored 129 points for the Warriors in <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20WHL%20season">1986–87</a>, Fleury's small stature led many teams to doubt that he could play in the NHL. The <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a> drafted him in the 8th round, 166th overall, of the <a href="1987%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1987 NHL Entry Draft</a>. Upon completing his junior season in 1988, Fleury signed his first professional contract, worth <a href="Canadian%20Dollar">C$</a>415,000, and joined the Flames' <a href="International%20Hockey%20League%20%281945%E2%80%932001%29">International Hockey League</a> (IHL) affiliate, the <a href="Salt%20Lake%20Golden%20Eagles">Salt Lake Golden Eagles</a>. He scored seven points in two regular season games, then 16 more in eight playoff games as the Eagles won the <a href="Turner%20Cup">Turner Cup</a> championship.

Fleury arrived at the Flames' 1988 training camp overweight, and was assigned back to Salt Lake to begin the 1988–89 season. He averaged nearly two points per game, recording 37 goals and 37 assists to lead the IHL in scoring after 40 games. Mired in a slump, the Flames recalled Fleury on January 1, 1989, in the hope he could help their offence. He played his first NHL game against the <a href="Quebec%20Nordiques">Quebec Nordiques</a> two nights later and recorded his first points – three assists – on January 5 against the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a>. He scored his first two NHL goals in a 7–2 victory over the <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a> on January 7. Fleury continued to score, and finished with 34 points in 36 games in his NHL rookie season. He added 11 points in the playoffs, helping the Flames to the first <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> championship in franchise history.
After improving to 33 goals in his first full season, Fleury broke out in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20NHL%20season">1990–91</a>, scoring <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%2050%20goal%20seasons">51 goals</a> and <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%20100%20point%20seasons">104 points</a> to lead the Flames offensively. He played in the <a href="42nd%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">1991 All-Star Game</a>, scoring a goal in an 11–5 victory by the <a href="Campbell%20Conference">Campbell Conference</a> over the <a href="Wales%20Conference">Wales Conference</a>. Towards the end of the season, Fleury set a league record by scoring three <a href="Goal%20%28ice%20hockey%29">shorthanded goals</a> in one game against the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a>. He shared the <a href="NHL%20Plus-Minus%20Award">NHL Plus-Minus Award</a> with <a href="Marty%20McSorley">Marty McSorley</a>, whom he tied for the league lead with <a href="Plus-minus%20%28ice%20hockey%29">+48</a>. Fleury scored only two goals in the <a href="1991%20Stanley%20Cup%20Playoffs">1991 Stanley Cup Playoffs</a>, but after his overtime winner in game six against the Oilers he famously slid the entire length of the ice in jubilation before crashing into the boards as his teammates attempted to catch up to him. The Flames were defeated in game seven, which ended their season.

Fleury fell back to 33 goals in <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20NHL%20season">1991–92</a> as the Flames missed the playoffs. That season, he made his <a href="43rd%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">second All-Star Game</a> appearance, recording a goal for the Campbell Conference. Fleury finished with over 100 points for the second time in his career in <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20NHL%20season">1992–93</a> to lead the team in scoring, and set a franchise record by going +9 in a 13–1 victory over the <a href="San%20Jose%20Sharks">San Jose Sharks</a> on February 10, 1993, in which he scored six points.

The <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20NHL%20lockout">1994–95 NHL lockout</a> reduced the season to 48 games from 84. During the lockout, Fleury played for <a href="Tappara">Tappara</a> in <a href="Finland">Finland</a>'s top league, the <a href="SM-liiga">SM-liiga</a>. He recorded 17 points in ten games before the NHL's labour dispute was resolved, bringing him back to Calgary. Late in the season, Fleury recorded two goals and an assist against the Oilers on March 31, 1995, to surpass 500 career points.

Lacking a contract prior to the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20NHL%20season">1995–96 season</a>, Fleury staged a brief hold-out during training camp before signing a five-year, $12 million deal with the Flames. He agreed to take less money than he could have received on the open market out of loyalty to the franchise that had given him his NHL opportunity. He missed much of the pre-season with a stomach ailment, but joined the team for the season opener. Although he felt like somebody was "stabbing a knife in [his] gut every five minutes", Fleury had played every game for the Flames when he revealed in December 1995 that he had been diagnosed with <a href="Crohn%27s%20disease">Crohn's disease</a> and doctors had finally found the correct medication to control it. Despite the ailment, Fleury led the team in goals, assists and points, and played in his third <a href="46th%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star Game</a>, serving as Calgary's only representative.

When <a href="Joe%20Nieuwendyk">Joe Nieuwendyk</a> refused to report to the Flames prior to the 1995 season, they named Fleury interim <a href="captain%20%28ice%20hockey%29">captain</a>. The title was made permanent when Nieuwendyk was traded in December. Fleury was reluctant to assume the captaincy, but did so out of loyalty to the team and because there was nobody else capable of taking on the role. He relinquished it two seasons later after deciding that it was harming his play and affecting his relationship with his teammates and coach <a href="Pierre%20Pag%C3%A9">Pierre Pagé</a>.

The Flames struggled in <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20NHL%20season">1996–97</a>, finishing last in the <a href="Pacific%20Division%20%28NHL%29">Pacific Division</a> and missing the playoffs for only the second time since their arrival in Calgary in 1980. Fleury again led the team in scoring, but his 29 goals were the fewest he had scored in a full season in the NHL. He was the Flames' lone representative at the <a href="47th%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">1997 All-Star Game</a>. He scored only 27 goals in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20NHL%20season">1997–98</a>, but increased his point total from 67 to 78 while also leading the team with 197 <a href="Penalty%20%28ice%20hockey%29">penalties in minutes</a>. On November 29, 1997, Fleury scored his 315th career goal, breaking Nieuwendyk's franchise record. The same day, he was named to Team Canada for the <a href="1998%20Winter%20Olympics">1998 Winter Olympics</a>. Fleury participated in his <a href="48th%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">fifth All-Star Game</a> that season, but the Flames again missed the playoffs.
On February 19, 1999, he surpassed <a href="Al%20MacInnis">Al MacInnis</a> as the franchise scoring leader with his 823rd career point. He held the record for ten years until surpassed by <a href="Jarome%20Iginla">Jarome Iginla</a> in 2009. The Flames, who had been struggling financially and were unable to sign Fleury to a new contract, chose to trade him less than two weeks after he broke the record rather than risk losing him to <a href="free%20agent">free agency</a>. He was dealt to the <a href="Colorado%20Avalanche">Colorado Avalanche</a> on February 28 for <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Corbet">René Corbet</a>, <a href="Wade%20Belak">Wade Belak</a> and <a href="Robyn%20Regehr">Robyn Regehr</a>. Although it was expected to a certain extent, the trade nonetheless stunned fans in Calgary. His popularity was such that during a game in 1999, after Fleury was sent off the ice to change a bloody jersey, a fan threw his own souvenir jersey over the boards so that Fleury would not miss a shift. He put the jersey on before realizing it was autographed and handed it back.

The trade was viewed as another sign that small-market Canadian teams could no longer compete in the NHL. The economics of hockey had changed such that the Flames felt that they had to deal their top player despite being just two points out of a playoff spot. Following the trade, Fleury said that any team looking to sign him to a new contract would have to pay him $7 million per year. In his autobiography, "Playing with Fire", Fleury claims that he was offered $16 million over four years by the Flames before the trade, and countered with an offer of $25 million over five years.

Fleury made his debut for the Avalanche the day after the trade and was met with loud cheers from the <a href="Denver">Denver</a> crowd. He scored a goal in a 4–3 loss to Edmonton, but also sprained his knee and missed the next two weeks. He had missed only seven games during his 11-year career in Calgary. He played in 15 regular-season games for the Avalanche, scoring 10 goals and 14 assists, and another 5 goals and 12 assists in 18 playoff games before the Avalanche were eliminated by the <a href="Dallas%20Stars">Dallas Stars</a> in the <a href="1999%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">Western Conference Finals</a>.

The Avalanche chose not to re-sign Fleury, and he joined the <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a> on a three-year contract worth $21 million that included a club option for a fourth year at $7 million. He touched off a wave of anger on signing with the Rangers when he claimed he was unappreciated in Calgary, comments he later stated were directed at the Flames' owners and not the team's fans, who he said always supported him. Fleury's first year in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> was a disappointment. He scored only 15 goals in <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20NHL%20season">1999–2000</a>, struggling under the pressure of trying to lead the Rangers into the playoffs and adapting to life in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>. After the season, he voluntarily entered a league-operated program that treats substance abuse and emotional problems, though he denied that either had any effect on his play.

Fleury rebounded to score 30 goals in <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20NHL%20season">2000–01</a> and participated in his <a href="51st%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">seventh All-Star Game</a>. He scored his 400th NHL goal on November 4, 2000, in a 5–2 victory over the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>. Fleury was leading his team, and was fourth in the league, with 74 points in 62 games, when the Rangers announced that he had again entered the league's substance abuse program. The decision ended his season.

Prior to the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20NHL%20season">2001–02 season</a> Fleury said that he continued to struggle with substance abuse and had difficulty adapting to life in Manhattan after growing up in a Canadian prairie town of 1,500. He played all 82 games in 2001–02, but his problems affected his behavior on the ice. After receiving a major and game misconduct penalty in a game against the San Jose Sharks on December 28, he wound up in a confrontation with the Sharks' mascot, S.J. Sharkie, in a hallway of the HP Pavilion, reportedly breaking the rib of the mascot portrayer. Fleury himself later downplayed the incident, saying that he "nudged" Sharkie. Upon taking a penalty in a January 2002 game against the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a>, Fleury left the arena rather than skate to the penalty box. He later apologized to his teammates, claiming he was deeply stressed by family problems. Two weeks later, he was fined $1,000 for making an obscene gesture to fans of the <a href="New%20York%20Islanders">New York Islanders</a> who had been taunting him over his drug use. Towards the end of February, he lashed out against the league's officials. He claimed they were not judging him fairly, and threatened to retire. The league dismissed his complaints. He did achieve a personal milestone during the season, however: on October 27, 2001, Fleury assisted on a goal by <a href="Mike%20York">Mike York</a>, scoring the <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%201000%20points">1,000th point</a> of his NHL career. The Rangers presented him with a silver stick in honour of the achievement.

Following the season, the Rangers did not exercise their <a href="Option%20%28finance%29">option</a>, and traded Fleury's playing rights to the <a href="San%20Jose%20Sharks">San Jose Sharks</a>, which entitled the Sharks to a compensatory draft pick if Fleury signed elsewhere. He did so with a two-year, $8.5 million contract with the <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a>. Two days prior to the opening of the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20NHL%20season">2002–03 season</a>, he was suspended by the NHL for violating the terms of the league's substance abuse program. The Blackhawks hired one of Fleury's friends, also a recovering alcoholic, to ensure that he attended <a href="Alcoholics%20Anonymous">Alcoholics Anonymous</a> meetings and abided by the terms of the NHL's aftercare program.

Fleury missed the first two months of the season before being reinstated. While out with teammates in January 2003, he was involved in a drunken brawl with bouncers at a strip club in <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>, that left him bloodied; he has no memory of the night and described it as among the lowest points of his life. He was not suspended, but the incident contributed to a collapse in the standings by the Blackhawks, and they placed him on <a href="waiver">waiver</a>s in March. No team claimed him, and Fleury finished the season with the Blackhawks, recording 12 goals and 21 assists in 54 games. Following the season, in April 2003, he was suspended again by the league for violations of its substance abuse program. The suspension ended his NHL career.

In January 2005, Fleury announced that he had joined his cousin <a href="Todd%20Holt">Todd Holt</a> and former NHL players <a href="Gino%20Odjick">Gino Odjick</a>, <a href="Sasha%20Lakovic">Sasha Lakovic</a> and <a href="Dody%20Wood">Dody Wood</a> in playing for the <a href="Horse%20Lake%20Thunder">Horse Lake Thunder</a> of the <a href="North%20Peace%20Hockey%20League">North Peace Hockey League</a> for the <a href="Allan%20Cup">Allan Cup</a>, Canada's national senior amateur championship. He also hoped to serve as a role model for kids on the <a href="Horse%20Lakes%20152b">Horse Lake First Nation</a>. <a href="Hockey%20Alberta">Hockey Alberta</a> initially ruled that he was ineligible to play <a href="senior%20ice%20hockey">senior hockey</a> in 2004–05 because he had been signed to a professional contract during the 2003–04 season. Hockey Alberta denied an appeal, citing a new policy it had put in effect to prevent NHL players from joining senior teams during the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20NHL%20lockout">2004–05 NHL lockout</a>. It reversed its decision on a second appeal after the NHL and <a href="National%20Hockey%20League%20Players%20Association">National Hockey League Players Association</a> both agreed that Fleury was a free agent, and not a locked-out player. Fleury played his first game for the Thunder on January 22, 2005, scoring a goal and two assists.

Fleury remained embroiled in controversy at the <a href="2005%20Allan%20Cup">2005 Allan Cup</a> tournament. The Thunder were repeatedly accused of paying players despite being an amateur team, and Fleury angrily denied rumours that he was secretly being paid $100,000. Tournament fans were extremely hostile towards the Thunder, and after it was eliminated in the semi-finals Fleury accused them of racism and threatened to return his 2002 Olympic gold medal: "The one thing that's really bothered me through this whole thing is the prejudice, still, in this country when it comes to native people. I've seen it first-hand in every building we go into, how these people are treated, and it's absolutely embarrassing to be a Canadian and know that stuff is still going on."

Fleury was convinced by a friend to move to <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> to play with the <a href="Belfast%20Giants">Belfast Giants</a> of the <a href="Elite%20Ice%20Hockey%20League">Elite Ice Hockey League</a> (EIHL) for the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20EIHL%20season">2005–06 season</a>. He scored <a href="hat-trick">three goals</a> and added four assists and a fight in his first game, against the <a href="Edinburgh%20Capitals">Edinburgh Capitals</a>. He scored 22 goals and 52 assists in 34 games, as Belfast won the regular season league title. Described as the "most talented" player ever to play in the United Kingdom, Fleury was named the EIHL's <a href="Player%20of%20the%20Year%20Trophy%20%28IHJUK%29">Player of the Year</a> and voted a <a href="EIHL%20All-Star%20Team">first team All-Star</a> by the <a href="Ice%20Hockey%20Journalists%20UK">British Ice Hockey Writers Association</a>. Fleury argued with visiting fans, as well as officials, which led him not to return to Belfast in 2006–07.

In late 2008, Fleury joined his brother Ted with the <a href="Steinbach%20North%20Stars">Steinbach North Stars</a> in a second bid to win the Allan Cup. He played 13 league games, scoring eight goals and 19 assists. At the <a href="2009%20Allan%20Cup">2009 Allan Cup</a> tournament, he recorded a goal and an assist to lead the host North Stars to a 5–0 win in their opening game, and finished tied for the lead in tournament scoring at seven points. The North Stars lost the semi-finals to the <a href="South%20East%20Prairie%20Thunder">South East Prairie Thunder</a>, 4–2.

Unhappy with how his NHL career ended, Fleury hired a personal trainer in February 2009 and began an attempt to return to the NHL. By August, he petitioned Commissioner <a href="Gary%20Bettman">Gary Bettman</a> to lift his suspension. He was reinstated on September 10 following a meeting with Bettman, Deputy Commissioner <a href="Bill%20Daly">Bill Daly</a> and league doctors. Fleury then accepted a try-out offer from the Flames. He said he wanted to prove to himself that he could still play at the NHL level, though his skeptics pointed to his child support payments and the failure of his concrete business, as well as the planned release of his autobiography, and argued Fleury's comeback was financially motivated.

He made his return to the NHL in an exhibition game in Calgary against the <a href="New%20York%20Islanders">New York Islanders</a> on September 17 on a line with <a href="Daymond%20Langkow">Daymond Langkow</a> and <a href="Nigel%20Dawes">Nigel Dawes</a>. Fleury was met with loud cheers throughout the game, and scored the only goal in a <a href="Overtime%20%28ice%20hockey%29">shootout</a> to give the Flames a 5–4 win. After the game, he saluted the crowd as the fans chanted "Theo! Theo! Theo!" Three nights later, he scored a goal and an assist in a 5–2 victory over the <a href="Florida%20Panthers">Florida Panthers</a>.

Fleury played four exhibition games, scoring four points, before being released by the Flames. General Manager <a href="Darryl%20Sutter">Darryl Sutter</a> expressed his pride in Fleury's attempt and commended his effort, but decided he was not one of the top six wingers in camp, which Sutter and Fleury had agreed was a condition of the tryout continuing. On September 28, 2009, Fleury announced his retirement at a news conference at the <a href="Pengrowth%20Saddledome">Saddledome</a>. He thanked the Flames for allowing him to attempt the comeback, and expressed satisfaction at how his career ended. "I get to retire a Calgary Flame. I HAD to retire a Calgary Flame. It’s been a long journey. It’s time to put down some roots. And there’s no better place than here," said Fleury of his decision not to seek an offer from another team.

Fleury made his debut with the <a href="Canada%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">Canadian senior team</a> at the <a href="1990%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1990 World Hockey Championships</a>, scoring 11 points in nine games for the fourth-place Canadians. He returned the following year despite a knee injury, helping Canada win the silver medal at the <a href="1991%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1991 tournament</a>. His 51-goal NHL season in 1990–91 also earned Fleury a spot at the <a href="1991%20Canada%20Cup">1991 Canada Cup</a>, where he scored a goal and four assists in seven games for the tournament champion Canadians. Five years later, he played in the <a href="1996%20World%20Cup%20of%20Hockey">1996 World Cup of Hockey</a>, the successor to the <a href="Canada%20Cup%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Canada Cup</a>. He finished fourth in the tournament with four goals, but Canada finished in second place after giving up four goals in the final four minutes of the championship game against the <a href="United%20States%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">American team</a>.

National Hockey League players were first allowed to participate in the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%20Winter%20Olympics">Olympic ice hockey</a> tournament at the <a href="1998%20Winter%20Olympics">1998 games</a>. Invited to join Canada's "Dream Team", Fleury described his selection as a highlight of his life. He scored a goal for Canada, who lost their semi-final match-up against the <a href="Czech%20Republic%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">Czech Republic</a> in a <a href="Shootout%20%28ice%20hockey%29">shootout</a> and failed to medal. Four years later, Fleury was invited by General Manager <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> to participate in Canada's selection camp for the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%202002%20Winter%20Olympics">2002 Olympics</a>. The invitation was controversial, as his behavioural and substance abuse issues had become increasingly public in previous months. Fleury wanted to justify Gretzky's support and, knowing that he would be removed from consideration if he failed, refrained from drinking or taking drugs during the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20NHL%20season">2001–02 NHL season</a>, later describing himself as a "dry drunk". He earned a spot on the team and recorded two assists in six games as the Canadian hockey team won its first Olympic gold medal in 50 years. Fleury considers the championship to be the pinnacle of his career.

Fleury continued to battle drug and alcohol addictions, revealing in a November 2004 interview that he had not overcome the problems that ended his NHL career a year and a half earlier. He credits his second wife, Jennifer, with turning his life around after they met when he was playing for Horse Lake in 2005. Fleury feared that Jennifer's frustration with his drug use would cost him the relationship, and, with her help, quit drugs and drinking on September 18, 2005. They were married one year later and have a daughter, Skylah. Fleury also has a son and daughter, Beaux and Tatym, from his relationship with his first wife, Veronica, and a son, Josh, born in 1987 to his high school girlfriend, Shannon.

In 1994, Fleury joined a group that involved his former junior coach, <a href="Graham%20James%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Graham James</a>, fellow NHL player <a href="Joe%20Sakic">Joe Sakic</a>, and professional wrestler <a href="Bret%20Hart">Bret Hart</a> as a minority owner of the expansion <a href="Calgary%20Hitmen">Calgary Hitmen</a> of the <a href="Western%20Hockey%20League">Western Hockey League</a>. He sold his share of the team to the Flames in 1997 in the aftermath of James' conviction for sexually abusing <a href="Sheldon%20Kennedy">Sheldon Kennedy</a> and another player. After returning from Northern Ireland, he operated Fleury's Concrete Coatings, a concrete sealing business he started with his wife Jennifer and brother Travis, until it closed in 2009. He filmed a <a href="pilot%20episode">pilot episode</a> in 2007 for a <a href="reality%20TV">reality TV</a> series based on his concrete business called "Theoren Fleury: Rock Solid": "We want to show people that if you have a dream, anything is possible with a little ambition," Fleury said of the show. It was not picked up by any network.

The 2008 launch of clothing line "FAKE" (Fleury's Artistic Kustom Enterprises) led him to approach the <a href="Calgary%20Vipers">Calgary Vipers</a> of the <a href="Golden%20Baseball%20League">Golden Baseball League</a> in the hope of convincing them to use his brand of practice jerseys. The conversation led to talk of Fleury playing a game for the Vipers as a publicity stunt. He made his professional baseball debut on August 9, 2008, at the age of 40, hitting a <a href="single%20%28baseball%29">single</a> in a <a href="pinch%20hitter">pinch-hit</a> appearance against the <a href="Yuma%20Scorpions">Yuma Scorpions</a>. He started the second game at <a href="left%20fielder">left field</a> and <a href="strikeout">struck out</a> twice before he was replaced. "I've had so many things happen in my life already that I sometimes surprise myself with the things I've done, the things I've accomplished. This was just another one of those days," Fleury said of his appearance with the Vipers.

Fleury has organized or participated in numerous charitable causes. He launched a hockey school in the mid-1990s that ran for seven years in Calgary and another eight in Russell, and donated the proceeds to minor hockey associations. Following his diagnosis with <a href="Crohn%27s%20disease">Crohn's disease</a> in 1995, Fleury joined with the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada to host an annual golf tournament in Calgary. The event has raised over $1 million, and is one of the organization's largest fundraising events in the Calgary area. He participates in Flames Alumni events and volunteers with the Calgary Dream Centre, which helps people overcome addiction.

Fleury was a participant on the second season of the <a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> <a href="figure%20skating">figure skating</a> reality show "<a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Blades">Battle of the Blades</a>", aired in the fall of 2010, and was donating his winnings to The Men's Project, a charity that provides support for men abused in childhood. His partner was <a href="Jamie%20Sal%C3%A9">Jamie Salé</a> and the pair finished 5th.

With the help of <a href="Kirstie%20McLellan%20Day">Kirstie McLellan Day</a>, Fleury wrote his <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a>, "<a href="Playing%20with%20Fire%20%28Fleury%20book%29">Playing with Fire</a>", which was released on October 16, 2009. In it, he alleged that he was sexually abused by Graham James over a period of two years. While he stated he "doesn't want to become the poster boy for abuse by James", Fleury hoped that speaking out might make it easier for other childhood sexual abuse victims to come forward. He blamed the abuse for turning him into a "raging, alcoholic lunatic", and claimed to have placed a loaded gun in his mouth and contemplated suicide in 2004. He revealed that he had spent most of his income on alcohol, drugs, gambling and women. Fleury also claimed that he failed 13 consecutive drug tests while playing for the Rangers, but that the league did not want to suspend him because he was a leading scorer. The league disputed this, and stated that its substance abuse program functioned appropriately.

"Playing with Fire" became the top seller on <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.ca</a> within a week of its release, and Fleury stated that he had been contacted by several sexual abuse victims who were motivated by his book to seek help. He also revealed that he was contemplating a criminal complaint against James, and had begun volunteering with an organization dedicated to helping male sexual abuse victims. Fleury was surprised that his story became the top-selling non-fiction book in Canada; without help, he and his wife were unable to keep up with the mail they were receiving. It is the second book about Fleury's life, following "Fury", released in 1997, which did not discuss many of the problems he was facing at the time.

<a href="Sheldon%20Kennedy">Sheldon Kennedy</a>, who was also a victim of James, encouraged Fleury to press charges. Fleury met with <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a> police in January 2010, who began an investigation when he formally filed a complaint. James ultimately pleaded guilty to charges stemming from his abuse of Fleury and his cousin <a href="Todd%20Holt">Todd Holt</a>. James was sentenced to two years in prison, a decision which sparked outrage across Canada for its perceived leniency. Fleury praised the response by Canadians and stated his desire to use it to press for changes to the legal system. Fleury is now a motivational speaker, hoping that sharing his story will encourage others to seek help for their problems.

McLellan Day adapted the autobiography into a one-man play, entitled "Playing with Fire: The Theo Fleury Story", which was produced by <a href="Alberta%20Theatre%20Projects">Alberta Theatre Projects</a> in Calgary. The play made its world premiere May 1, 2012. Fleury and his autobiography were also the subject of a 2012 documentary by <a href="HBO%20Canada">HBO Canada</a>.

In September 2015, it was announced through Fleury's Twitter account he had been working on a Country music record to be released in the fall of 2015. He released his first single titled "My Life's Been a Country Song" and it reached over 20,000 plays on Soundcloud within the first 24 hours of being released. His debut record "<a href="I%20Am%20Who%20I%20Am%20%28album%29">I Am Who I Am</a>" was released on October 16, 2015 through <a href="eOne%20Music">eOne Music</a> Canada. The hockey star turned Country star transformation did not happen overnight as Fleury claims this project has been ongoing for the past six years with him receiving vocal and performance training from industry professionals. He collaborated with long-time friends Phil Deschambault and Paddy McCallion and together they created over 30 songs worth of material that would be later cut to ten songs for the album.

In 2017, Fleury wrote a song, "Longshot", for the video game "<a href="Madden%20NFL%2018">Madden NFL 18</a>" story mode of the same name.

Aside from Fleury's hockey accomplishments, he has also been awarded the Canadian Humanitarian Award and the Queen's Jubilee Medallion. The Medallion is awarded to those individuals who have made a significant contribution to Canada. Along with these awards Fleury has also received the Aboriginal Inspire Award. Fleury has also received the honorary Siksika Nation Chief and an honorary doctorate in science from the University of Guelph-Humber for outstanding contributions to the mental health of Canadians.

Resident Evil: Apocalypse

Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a 2004 <a href="action%20horror">action horror film</a> directed by <a href="Alexander%20Witt">Alexander Witt</a> and written by <a href="Paul%20W.%20S.%20Anderson">Paul W. S. Anderson</a>. A direct sequel to "<a href="Resident%20Evil%20%28film%29">Resident Evil</a>" (2002), it is the second installment in the <a href="Resident%20Evil%20%28film%20series%29">"Resident Evil" film series</a>, which is loosely based on the <a href="Resident%20Evil">video game series of the same name</a>. The film marks Witt's feature directorial debut; Anderson, the director of the first film, turned down the job due to other commitments, though stayed on as one of its producers. <a href="Milla%20Jovovich">Milla Jovovich</a> reprises her role as <a href="Alice%20%28Resident%20Evil%29">Alice</a>, and is joined by <a href="Sienna%20Guillory">Sienna Guillory</a> as <a href="Jill%20Valentine">Jill Valentine</a> and <a href="Oded%20Fehr">Oded Fehr</a> as <a href="List%20of%20Resident%20Evil%20characters%23Carlos%20Oliveira">Carlos Oliveira</a>.

"Resident Evil: Apocalypse" is set directly after the events of the first film, where Alice escaped from an underground facility overrun by <a href="zombie">zombie</a>s. She now bands together with other survivors to escape the zombie outbreak which has spread to the nearby Raccoon City. The film borrows elements from several games in the "Resident Evil" series, such as the characters Valentine and Oliveira and the villain <a href="Nemesis%20%28Resident%20Evil%29">Nemesis</a>. Filming took place in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, Canada, at locations including <a href="Toronto%20City%20Hall">Toronto City Hall</a> and <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Viaduct">Prince Edward Viaduct</a>.

"Resident Evil: Apocalypse" received mostly negative reviews from critics who complained about the plot; however, the film garnered praise for its action sequences. It is the lowest-rated of the six films in the "Resident Evil" series on <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, with an approval rating of 21%. Earning $129 million worldwide on a $45 million budget, it surpassed the box office gross of the original film. A third film, "", was released in 2007.

In <a href="Resident%20Evil%20%28film%29">the previous film</a>, former security operative <a href="Alice%20%28Resident%20Evil%29">Alice</a> and environmental activist Matt Addison fought to escape an underground genetic research facility called the Hive, the source of a <a href="zombie">zombie</a> outbreak. The pair were part of an attempt to expose illegal experiments being performed there by pharmaceutical company <a href="Umbrella%20Corporation">Umbrella Corporation</a>. The film ended as Alice and Addison were taken into custody by Umbrella.

Umbrella sends a team to the Hive to investigate what happened there; the team is overrun by zombies who quickly spread to the nearby Raccoon City. Umbrella responds by quarantining the city and evacuating their personnel from it. Angela Ashford, the daughter of Umbrella researcher Dr. Charles Ashford, goes missing after her security car is involved in a collision while being extradited from the city. Meanwhile, disgraced Raccoon City Police Department Special Tactics And Rescue Squad (STARS) operative <a href="Jill%20Valentine">Jill Valentine</a> returns to her former precinct to suggest her fellow officers that they evacuate Raccoon City. Alice awakens in a deserted hospital and wanders the city in search of supplies, while Umbrella uses the only bridge out of the area to evacuate civilians. At the bridge, Valentine meets with her former partner, Sgt. Payton Wells. A zombie bites and infects Wells. In response to the virus reaching the bridge, Major Timothy Cain, leader of the Umbrella forces in Raccoon City, seals the exit and forces the residents to return to the city.

After being abandoned by their employer following a failed attempt to rescue a civilian, Umbrella soldiers <a href="List%20of%20Resident%20Evil%20characters%23Carlos%20Oliveira">Carlos Oliveira</a> and Nicholai Ginovaef team up with the surviving <a href="List%20of%20Resident%20Evil%20characters%23STARS">STARS</a> operatives to repel zombie attacks. Their position is overrun, and Oliveira is bitten and infected. At a separate location, Valentine, Wells, and news reporter Terri Morales, are about to be overrun, though they are saved by Alice. Umbrella deploys a heavily mutated experimental <a href="supersoldier">supersoldier</a>, <a href="Nemesis%20%28Resident%20Evil%29">Nemesis</a>, who kills the remaining STARS members before searching for Alice. Dr. Ashford hacks into the city's <a href="Closed-circuit%20television">CCTV</a> system and uses it to contact Alice and the other survivors, offering to arrange their evacuation from the city in exchange for help in locating his daughter. He makes an identical offer to Oliveira and Ginovaef, and explains that Umbrella intends to rid Raccoon City of the zombie infection by destroying it using a nuclear bomb.

Alice and the others head to Angela's location, where they are ambushed by Nemesis. Valentine kills Wells after he turns into a zombie. Alice engages Nemesis but is wounded and forced to retreat separately, luring Nemesis away from the rest of the group. Valentine and Morales continue, picking up stranded civilian L.J. en route. Valentine meets Oliveira and they find and rescue Angela, although Morales and Ginovaef are both killed. Angela reveals that the zombie outbreak is the result of a virus created by her father to treat the genetic disease from which she suffers: only by regularly injecting herself with the virus is Angela able to survive, though she must also take anti-virus serum to prevent turning into a zombie. Alice uses some of the anti-virus to cure Oliveira. Dr. Ashford gives Alice the location of an extraction point where a helicopter awaits. The group makes it to the rendezvous point, but are ambushed by Umbrella forces. Major Cain kills Dr. Ashford and forces Alice to fight Nemesis. Alice gains the upper hand over the supersoldier, though she ceases fighting after realizing that he is Matt Addison, mutated by Umbrella's experiments.

Nemesis turns on Major Cain and attacks the Umbrella troops, but is killed protecting Alice. The rest of the survivors seize the helicopter; they eject Major Cain from it and he is eaten by zombies, including a zombified Dr. Ashford. As the survivors escape, the nuclear bomb detonates over the city, and the resulting blast wave causes the helicopter to crash. Alice sacrifices herself to save Angela and is impaled on a metal pole. TV footage attributes the nuclear attack to a meltdown of the city's power plant, covering up Umbrella's involvement. Alice wakes up in an Umbrella research facility and escapes with help from Oliveira, Valentine, L.J., and Angela. As they are escaping, Dr. Alexander Isaacs, a high-ranking Umbrella employee, reveals that Alice's escape is part of Umbrella's plan for her.

Media studies scholar Stephen Harper said that both "Apocalypse" and the first "Resident Evil" film present "highly ambiguous" perspectives on the themes of corporate power, race, gender and sexuality. Describing them both as <a href="Postmodernism">postmodern</a> and <a href="Postfeminism">postfeminist</a> texts, Harper argued that, despite containing some progressive elements including feminist themes that undermine patriarchal power, the films also played into several stereotypes. He said the relationship between Alice and Valentine differs from interactions between male characters in action films as seen by a lack of camaraderie and co-operation between the two and, unlike male characters in "Apocalypse", both Valentine and Alice are separately shown being "protective and nurturing" of the young Angela; Harper stated even violent action heroines are often portrayed with such characteristics. Harper also criticized how their revealing clothing and camera angles objectified Alice and Valentine throughout the film, and noted that through the <a href="African%20Americans">African-American</a> character L.J. "Apocalypse" showed an "ironic awareness" of racist stereotypes, though "it stops short of challenging them and, indeed, often deploys them".

<a href="Douglas%20Kellner">Douglas Kellner</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">University of California</a> argued the film's ending played "on fears of out of control nuclear technology and government cover-ups". A news segment shown in the film, which claimed that reports of corporate wrongdoing were false and that people should instead be thanking the Umbrella Corporation, was "a barely disguised allegory of lying by corporations and the state during the <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">Bush</a>-<a href="Dick%20Cheney">Cheney</a> era".

While promoting the first "Resident Evil" film in late February 2002, <a href="Milla%20Jovovich">Milla Jovovich</a> and director <a href="Paul%20W.%20S.%20Anderson">Paul W. S. Anderson</a> discussed a potential sequel. Anderson said he began writing the screenplay for the second film after completing the first, and had plans for Alice to meet up with Jill Valentine. Jovovich confirmed her character would return in the sequel if the first film was successful. In early March, <a href="Eric%20Mabius">Eric Mabius</a>, who played Matt Addison in the first film, stated a sequel was confirmed, would be set in Raccoon City, and would feature the Nemesis character. The sequel was officially <a href="Green-light">greenlit</a> by <a href="Sony%20Pictures">Sony Pictures</a> in mid-2002 but Anderson chose not to direct due to his commitments to "<a href="Alien%20vs.%20Predator%20%28film%29">Alien vs. Predator</a>" (2004). He stayed on as the film's <a href="screenwriter">screenwriter</a> and as one of its <a href="Film%20producer">producer</a>s. Anderson used the game "" as the basis of the story and wrote in elements from his favorite films, such as the perimeter wall in "<a href="Escape%20from%20New%20York">Escape from New York</a>" and the deserted city in "<a href="The%20Omega%20Man">The Omega Man</a>". <a href="Alexander%20Witt">Alexander Witt</a> was hired to direct the film, marking his feature film directorial debut. The script had already been completed when Witt was hired. He made some suggestions to Anderson and fellow producer <a href="Jeremy%20Bolt">Jeremy Bolt</a>, which resulted in some minor script changes.

Jovovich was the only person to reprise a role from the first film. It was initially reported that Mabius would be reprising his role as Matt Addison in the form of portraying Nemesis, but the part ended up going to <a href="Matthew%20G.%20Taylor">Matthew G. Taylor</a>. Mabius still appears via stock footage from the previous film used in a <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashback</a> scene. The original film did not feature any characters from the games, but it had always been the intention to add several to "Apocalypse". <a href="Gina%20Philips">Gina Philips</a> was originally to apprear in the film portraying the character <a href="Claire%20Redfield">Claire Redfield</a>, but she eventually turned down the role which was then given to <a href="Emily%20Bergl">Emily Bergl</a>, who left before production began. The character was dropped, but did appear in the film's sequel, "" (2007), portrayed by <a href="Ali%20Larter">Ali Larter</a>. For the role of Valentine, Anderson first considered <a href="Natasha%20Henstridge">Natasha Henstridge</a>, but she was unavailable; he then considered <a href="Mira%20Sorvino">Mira Sorvino</a> though she declined. The role eventually went to <a href="Sienna%20Guillory">Sienna Guillory</a> who prepared for the role by studying Valentine's movements and posture in the games. The role of L.J. was written specifically for <a href="Snoop%20Dogg">Snoop Dogg</a>, though he dropped out of production and was replaced by <a href="Mike%20Epps">Mike Epps</a>; the character was rewritten to suit Epps's personality. <a href="Evanescence">Evanescence</a> guitarist <a href="Ben%20Moody">Ben Moody</a> was given a cameo as a zombie Ginovaef kills.

The film was shot in <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, Canada; <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> and its surrounding suburbs stood in for Raccoon City. Cinematography was performed by <a href="Christian%20Sebaldt">Christian Sebaldt</a> and Derek Rogers, and filming took place at 47 locations. Very few <a href="Set%20construction">sets</a> were made for the film. Several city blocks were closed down and the <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Viaduct">Prince Edward Viaduct</a> bridge was closed for three days so scenes could be filmed on it. Scenes were shot outside <a href="Toronto%20City%20Hall">Toronto City Hall</a> for two weeks. Jovovich and Matthew Taylor spent several hours a day for six weeks practicing martial arts together for the fight scene between Alice and Nemesis. The fight was originally scripted to appear in a train station and focus heavily on interaction with props, though was eventually shot in an open space outside Toronto City Hall after Witt decided to give the fight less screen time. Actors portraying zombies spent four days training with <a href="Choreography">choreographers</a> at a zombie "boot camp" to make sure they all had consistent behavior and movements. Anderson and other crew members considered making the zombies move faster but decided that it would be breaking a fundamental element of the games. Anderson only appeared on set for a couple of days due to other commitments, though he communicated with Witt via email about several dialogue and production changes during filming. The script's original ending had Alice escaping from Umbrella on her own via greater use of her <a href="Psychokinesis">telekinetic</a> powers before meeting up with Valentine. Approximately half of the scene was filmed before the ending was rewritten.

The original "Resident Evil" film took only broad elements from the games; "Apocalypse" incorporated many specific features from them, such as the re-enactment of scenes. The introductory <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a> of "" featuring Claire Redfield inspired the scene where Alice runs through a building while an Umbrella helicopter fires. The introduction of "Resident Evil 3: Nemesis" inspired another scene where Raccoon City is overrun by zombies, and the police and Umbrella soldiers are fighting back. Valentine's outfit in the film, which consisted of a <a href="tube%20top">tube top</a> and miniskirt, is based on her costume from "Nemesis". Anderson considered several ways to justify having the revealing costume in the storyline, such as making it her <a href="Undercover%20operation">undercover</a> outfit, though eventually decided to ignore the issue on the grounds that anyone questioning her attire "probably shouldn't be watching a "Resident Evil" movie". The film also references several aspects from the original "<a href="Resident%20Evil%20%281996%20video%20game%29">Resident Evil</a>" game and "<a href="Resident%20Evil%202">Resident Evil 2</a>", such as locations, place names, character moves, props, and camera perspectives.

Special effects for the film included <a href="Chroma%20key">green screens</a>, <a href="computer-generated%20imagery">computer-generated imagery</a> (CGI), <a href="Matte%20%28filmmaking%29">matte</a> paintings, <a href="Tracking%20shot">tracking</a>, <a href="wire%20removal">wire removal</a> and <a href="scale%20model">scale model</a>s. The Nemesis character was created with a costume, and the only CGI effect added was an adjustment to his eye. Taylor was chosen as his height at and weight of made him suitable to portray the character. The costume was specifically built for his body and weighed about . Despite the character's height, <a href="Aspect%20ratio%20%28image%29">aspect ratios</a> were still modified to make him appear 10–20% larger in certain scenes. The Lickers, a type of mutated zombie, were completely CGI. The effects team had originally used <a href="animatronics">animatronics</a> for some of the scenes, but were unhappy with the results. <a href="C.O.R.E.">C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures</a> won the contract to animate the Lickers, beating several other effects companies who had submitted preliminary designs, and described it as the most challenging special effect they created for the film. The studio created over 250 special effects including superimposing Jovovich's face onto a stunt double; Jovovich performed most of her own stunts though her insurance company would not allow her to attempt several of the more dangerous ones. <a href="Frantic%20Films">Frantic Films</a> created 78 special effects for the film including <a href="Tracer%20ammunition">tracer fire</a>, <a href="muzzle%20flash">muzzle flash</a>es, lasers and slow motion, using effects programs <a href="Blackmagic%20Fusion">Eyeon Fusion</a>, <a href="Autodesk%203ds%20Max">Autodesk 3ds Max</a> as well as in-house software. Mr. X Inc. created additional effects including the scene showing the destruction of the Toronto City Hall building. Four months were spent making a 1/6 scale model of the building with 1,600 panes of glass, each of which was wired with an explosive to create the final effect. <a href="Digital%20intermediate">Digital intermediate</a> work was completed by the <a href="Framestore">Computer Film Company</a>. Colors in the film were edited heavily in post-production, giving it a darker look overall while enhancing the brightness of blood and gore. The colors of the Nemesis costume were also tweaked to make it look more lifelike and Alice and Valentine were given modifications such as increasing the glow of their skin and redness of their lips.

The soundtrack for "Apocalypse" was released on August 31, 2004, and contained <a href="alternative%20metal">alternative metal</a> songs both featured in the film and "inspired" by it. Johnny Loftus of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> gave the soundtrack three stars out of five, saying it was an "unscrupulous moneymaker" that predictably catered to the film's target audience of teenage boys, adding the "aggression, mania, and generally apocalyptic tone of this material fits well with a movie based on a video game about blowing away crazy zombies".

<a href="Jeff%20Danna">Jeff Danna</a> composed the <a href="film%20score">film's score</a> performed by the <a href="Philharmonia%20Orchestra">London Philharmonia Orchestra</a>. It was released on September 28, 2004. Mike Brennan from Soundtrack.net gave the score 2½ stars out of five, praising the blend of orchestral and electronic styles, though saying it "could have easily benefited from some more thematic development and a bit more variation in the sound of the music".

<a href="Marcus%20Nispel">Marcus Nispel</a> was hired to create a <a href="Teaser%20campaign">teaser trailer</a>, titled "Regenerate". It purports to be advertising a skin rejuvenation product created by the Umbrella Corporation, before the woman in the commercial turns into a zombie. By May 2004, the teaser had been downloaded 8.5million times from the film's official website. Part of the teaser was shown in the film briefly on a television in the background and a part of it also appears in a <a href="Post-credits%20scene">mid-credits scene</a>. The film's <a href="Trailer%20%28promotion%29">theatrical trailer</a> was released on <a href="Yahoo%21%20Movies">Yahoo! Movies</a> in July 2004. A novelization of the film written by <a href="Keith%20DeCandido">Keith DeCandido</a> was published by <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster">Simon & Schuster</a> the following month.

"Apocalypse" opened at number one in the United States on September 10, 2004, where it grossed over <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>23million on its opening weekend. The film also opened at number one in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Mexico, and performed well in Japan, France and Brazil, though the horror film "<a href="Saw%20%282004%20film%29">Saw</a>" overshadowed it at the box office in the United Kingdom, and it received a lackluster reception in Sweden, where it grossed $473,550. Earning over <a href="Canadian%20dollar">$</a>6million in Canada, "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" was the highest grossing, domestically produced Canadian film in 2004. "Apocalypse" went on to earn $129,394,835 worldwide against a budget of $45million, surpassing the earnings of the first film which generated $102,984,862.

Based on 124 reviews, "Apocalypse" holds an approval rating of 21% on <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, giving it the lowest rating of the six films in the series. The site's critics consensus reads: ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse" has lots of action, but not much in terms of plot or creativity". <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> gives the film a score of 35/100 based on 26 reviews.

<a href="Leonard%20Maltin">Leonard Maltin</a> rated the film a "bomb" in his book "<a href="Leonard%20Maltin%27s%20Movie%20Guide">Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide</a>" and called it a "tiresome" sequel that ended up playing more like a <a href="remake">remake</a>. <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> gave the film a score of half a star out of four, calling it "an utterly meaningless waste of time" that lacked any wit or imagination and also failed to provide entertaining violence or special effects. Carrie Rickey of "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>" gave the film one star out of four, concluding that even for people interested in the <a href="List%20of%20body%20horror%20media">biological horror</a> genre, "Apocalypse" was "pretty generic stuff".

<a href="Dave%20Kehr">Dave Kehr</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" gave the film a positive review, praising Anderson's screenplay and describing Witt's direction as "fast, funny, smart and highly satisfying in terms of visceral impact". M. E. Russell of "<a href="The%20Oregonian">The Oregonian</a>" said, "The bad news? The movie is monumentally stupid. The good news? It's a fun kind of stupid". "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>"s Nathan Rabin said that it progressed too slowly to be considered a good film, "but when Jovovich finally starts kicking zombified ass, it becomes good enough". Ben Kenigsberg of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" said the film is "not without its moments of elemental dread" though he complained there was too much action and <a href="Filler%20%28media%29">padding</a> and not enough irony.

Gregory Kirschling of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>", who gave the film a 'D−' rating, praised Jovovich but felt that "the rest of the cast was strictly <a href="direct-to-video">straight-to-DVD</a>"; "<a href="Cinefantastique">Cinefantastique</a>", on the other hand, commented that Jovovich looked bored and that Guillory's portrayal of Jill Valentine was the film's "saving grace".

In 2009, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" ranked the film as one of the top ten worst <a href="Film%20adaptation%23Video%20game%20adaptation">video game films</a>. While criticizing all three films released in the "Resident Evil" series at the time, they concluded that "Apocalypse" deserved their vote "Because, like any sequel, it’s an enabler ... sequels to bad movies just enable further sequels to be considered". In 2016, separate journalists from <a href="Bloody%20Disgusting">Bloody Disgusting</a> ranked it as both the best and worst film in the series. In 2017, Michael Nordine of "<a href="TheWrap">TheWrap</a>" ranked it as the worst film in the series, saying its only redeeming features were the fact it expanded the series and the "awesomely stupid" fight between Alice and Nemesis.

RSPB Minsmere

RSPB Minsmere is a <a href="nature%20reserve">nature reserve</a> owned and managed by the <a href="Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Birds">Royal Society for the Protection of Birds</a> (RSPB) at <a href="Minsmere">Minsmere</a>, Suffolk. The site has been managed by the RSPB since 1947 and covers areas of <a href="reed%20bed">reed bed</a>, <a href="lowland%20heath">lowland heath</a>, <a href="acid%20grassland">acid grassland</a>, <a href="wet%20meadow">wet grassland</a>, <a href="woodland">woodland</a> and <a href="shingle%20beach">shingle</a> vegetation. It lies within the <a href="Suffolk%20Coast%20and%20Heaths">Suffolk Coast and Heaths</a> <a href="Area%20of%20Outstanding%20Natural%20Beauty">Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a> and the Suffolk Heritage Coast area. It is conserved as a <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a>, <a href="Special%20Area%20of%20Conservation">Special Area of Conservation</a>, <a href="Special%20Protection%20Area">Special Protection Area</a> and <a href="Ramsar%20site">Ramsar site</a>.

The nature reserve is managed primarily for bird conservation, particularly through control and improvement of wetland, <a href="heath">heath</a> and grassland habitats, with particular emphasis on encouraging nationally uncommon breeding species such as the <a href="Eurasian%20bittern">bittern</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20stone-curlew">stone-curlew</a>, <a href="western%20marsh%20harrier">marsh harrier</a>, <a href="European%20nightjar">nightjar</a> and <a href="common%20nightingale">nightingale</a>. The diversity of habitats has also led to a wide variety of other animals and plants being recorded on the site.

Before becoming a nature reserve, the area was the site of an ancient abbey and a <a href="Tudor%20period">Tudor</a> <a href="artillery%20battery">artillery battery</a>. The marshes were reclaimed as farmland in the 19th century, but were re-flooded during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> as a protection against possible invasion.

The reserve has a visitor centre, eight <a href="bird%20hide">bird hide</a>s and an extensive network of footpaths and trails. Entry is free for RSPB members. Potential future threats to the site include flooding or <a href="soil%20salinity">salination</a> as <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a> causes rising sea levels, coastal erosion and possible effects on water levels due to the construction of a new <a href="nuclear%20power%20plant">reactor</a> at the neighbouring <a href="Sizewell%20nuclear%20power%20stations">Sizewell nuclear power stations</a>.

The area around Minsmere consists of the wide valley of the <a href="Minsmere%20River">Minsmere River</a> with Dunwich cliffs to the north and Sizewell cliffs to the south. Two extensive sandbanks lie off the coast, and the beach is sand overlain with shingle. The cliffs have a maximum height of about and are amongst the most rapidly eroding in the UK, at an annual rate of .

From 500 BC to 700 AD, the sea level in Suffolk was about higher than it is today, and the low-lying areas of the present coast were then tidal estuaries. The river mouth was finally closed in the 18th century as sand and shingle deposits formed off the coast. The higher land consists of a deep layer of gravel and sand, the legacy of the beach formed by the sea before it retreated. The geology of the wetland areas below the <a href="topsoil">topsoil</a> is <a href="marine%20clay">marine clay</a> with darker freshwater deposits from the Minsmere River.

In the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Survey</a> in 1086 Minsmere was known as "Menesmara" or "Milsemere". It is recorded as having six households headed by freemen with one plough team. The manor, which was in the <a href="Blything%20Hundred">Hundred of Blythling</a>, was held by <a href="Roger%20Bigod%20of%20Norfolk">Roger Bigot</a>.

<a href="Ranulf%20de%20Glanvill">Ranulf de Glanvill</a>, <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">King Henry II</a>'s <a href="Justiciar">Lord Chief Justice</a>, founded a <a href="Premonstratensians">Premonstratensian</a> abbey on the marshes at Minsmere in 1182. The area was embanked to protect the abbey from the sea and to reclaim farmland, but still suffered several years of severe flooding in the 14th century. The site was abandoned in 1363, and the stone from the buildings was used to rebuild <a href="Leiston%20Abbey">Leiston Abbey</a> at a new location further inland. The remains of the abbey church, <a href="fish%20pond">fish pond</a> and other buildings can still be detected below ground, but the only visible structure is the ruined chapel of St Mary, built within the <a href="nave">nave</a> of the former church. The lower section of the chapel was built soon after the demolition of the abbey in 1363, and the brick upper parts are thought to have been added by former abbot John Green, who lived there as a hermit when he retired from his post in 1527. The site was abandoned in 1537 during the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a>, the only further construction being a <a href="Pillbox%20%28military%29">pillbox</a> that was built inside the chapel during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The ruins are a <a href="scheduled%20monument">scheduled monument</a> of national importance.

<a href="Peat">Peat</a> cutting took place at Minsmere from at least the 12th century, and a 1237 description of the coastline describes Minsmere as a port. In a survey of 1587, an early <a href="Tudor%20period">Tudor period</a> <a href="artillery%20battery">artillery battery</a>, constructed sometime after 1539 at Minsmere, was in ruins; the survey recommended that it be rebuilt. A coastguard station operated at Minsmere in the 1840s in an attempt to control smuggling along this stretch of the coast.

In about 1780 a sandbank closed the mouth of the Minsmere River, creating a large freshwater wetland on its inland side. The reeds that grew there were cut for <a href="thatching">thatching</a>, and access was improved by using sand from the higher <a href="alluvium">alluvial</a> areas to build tracks across the marshes. These marshes were <a href="enclosure">enclosed</a> and drained for agricultural use in 1812 and 1813, following the passing of the relevant Act in 1810, with the main <a href="sluice">sluice</a> being built to control drainage to the sea. The New Cut, a <a href="canal">canal</a> south of the river, was built as part of the drainage works, joining the river again at the sea sluice. The canal was used to transport the thatch crop inland by barge, its bridges being built particularly high to enable the bulky cargo to pass beneath. The drainage was improved after 1846 using steam-powered pumps. These were made by <a href="Richard%20Garrett%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">Richard Garrett & Sons</a> of the Leiston Iron Works.

There were four windmill sites on the levels. The <a href="Eastbridge%20Windpump">Eastbridge Windpump</a> was a <a href="smock%20mill">smock mill</a> built in the mid-19th century, probably by the <a href="millwright">millwright</a> Robert Martin of <a href="Beccles">Beccles</a>. It stood north of the New Cut. The mill worked a three throw pump with square pistons. The windpump was working until 1939 and collapsed in February 1977. The remains were rescued by the Suffolk Mills Group in July 1977 and the mill was rebuilt at the <a href="Museum%20of%20East%20Anglian%20Life">Museum of East Anglian Life</a> in <a href="Stowmarket">Stowmarket</a> in the early 1980s. The Sea Wall Mill stood north of the New Cut but closer to the coast than the Eastbridge Windpump. It was a smock mill built in the early 19th century. The mill worked by wind until it was tailwinded in January 1935, breaking the windshaft and rendering the mill sail-less. The <a href="scoopwheel">scoopwheel</a> was subsequently worked by a <a href="Hupmobile">Hupmobile</a> petrol engine, and later by a diesel engine. The mill collapsed in the summer of 1976. A third smock mill stood south of the New Cut and seaward of the ruins of the chapel. Built by the millwright Collins of <a href="Melton%2C%20Suffolk">Melton</a>, it was blown down in the 1920s and a <a href="John%20Wallis%20Titt">Titt</a> windpump was erected on the site to drive the scoopwheel. This windpump had sails diameter. Another Titt windpump, with sails diameter stood 1.6 km (a mile) south of this. Both Titt windpumps were standing in 1938.

The levels were re-flooded during World War II to <a href="British%20anti-invasion%20preparations%20of%20the%20Second%20World%20War">defend against invasion</a> along the <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>n coast. <a href="British%20hardened%20field%20defences%20of%20World%20War%20II">Military defences</a> were built at Minsmere and neighbouring <a href="Dunwich">Dunwich</a>, including pillboxes, <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft defences</a>, anti-tank blocks and <a href="barbed%20wire">barbed wire</a> defence lines. The <a href="British%20Army">Army</a> also used much of the heathland for military manoeuvres, including preparations for the invasion of continental Europe.

Before the war, the Ogilvie family had owned and managed the area as farmland and as a shooting estate, planting many <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> trees as part of their hunting management plan. After the war, they decided to leave the marshes undrained, realising their <a href="ornithology">ornithological</a> value.

The RSPB had been considering the Minsmere site, at that time about in extent, as a potential reserve from the late 1930s, and a management agreement was signed in 1947. The appointment of <a href="Bert%20Axell">Bert Axell</a> as warden in 1959 led to major changes in reserve management, which were in due course also adopted elsewhere. He realised that <a href="ecological%20succession">ecological succession</a> would eventually lead to the loss of important habitats, such as bare ground on the heaths or open water in the reed beds, unless natural plant colonisation was actively prevented. He created the "scrape", an area with shallow water, islands and bare mud, by lowering land levels and managing the water level with new sluices. A circular path led around the scrape, giving access to hides on each of the four sides. In 1977, two years after Axell's retirement, the RSPB purchased the reserve outright.

The <a href="Great%20Storm%20of%201987">Great Storm of 1987</a> destroyed 3,000 trees in one night. Many areas were reforested, but it was noticed that other badly affected woodlands nearby were colonised by <a href="woodlark">woodlark</a>s, so some recently acquired <a href="arable%20land">arable land</a> was acidified and converted to heathland to encourage open-ground species.

Minsmere is one of a small number of UK sites at which <a href="Eurasian%20bittern">bitterns</a> breed. In 1979, nine booming males were counted but the population at Minsmere has varied over time, reaching a low of only one booming male in 1991. During the 1990s the existing reed beds were managed specifically for bitterns; when <a href="grazing%20marsh">grazing marsh</a>es known as the North and South Levels were purchased, the North Levels were converted to reed bed and the South Levels to wet grassland.

The Minsmere reserve covers about of reed bed, open water, lowland heath, grassland, scrub, woodland, dune and shingle vegetation. The nature reserve, its habitats and wildlife, are protected under UK law as part of <a href="Minsmere%E2%80%93Walberswick%20Heaths%20and%20Marshes">Minsmere–Walberswick Heaths and Marshes</a>, which is a <a href="Special%20Protection%20Area">Special Protection Area</a>, a <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar Site</a>, a <a href="Special%20Area%20of%20Conservation">Special Area of Conservation</a> and a <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a>. The site is also included in the areas covered by the Suffolk Coast and Heaths <a href="Area%20of%20Outstanding%20Natural%20Beauty">Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a> (AONB) and the Suffolk Heritage Coast.

The reserve is accessible by car from the <a href="A12%20road%20%28England%29">A12</a> via the village of <a href="Westleton">Westleton</a>. It is also connected to <a href="National%20Cycle%20Route%201">Route 1</a> of the <a href="Sustrans">Sustrans</a> <a href="National%20Cycle%20Network">National Cycle Network</a> by the <a href="Regional%20Cycle%20Route%2042">Suffolk Coast Cycle route</a>. The nearest bus access is in the town of <a href="Leiston">Leiston</a> away and rail access is in <a href="Darsham">Darsham</a> distant. Coastlink, a <a href="Demand%20responsive%20transport">demand responsive bus</a> service, is available from these places to travel to the reserve but requires booking a day in advance. RSPB Minsmere is accessible on foot from <a href="Dunwich%20Heath">Dunwich Heath</a>, <a href="Sizewell">Sizewell</a> Beach and <a href="Eastbridge">Eastbridge</a>, and there are of <a href="Rights%20of%20way%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">public rights of way</a> around the reserve. Two <a href="Long-distance%20trail">long-distance walks</a>, the <a href="Suffolk%20Coast%20Path">Suffolk Coast Path</a> and the <a href="Sandlings%20Walk">Sandlings Walk</a>, also connect to Minsmere.

The reserve was originally conceived as a protected site for rare breeding birds, and before 1980 permits were needed to visit. Only since 2005 has Minsmere opened every day of the week. The visitor centre was built in 1996 and expanded in 2012 using <a href="Heritage%20Lottery%20Fund">National Lottery</a> and <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> funding. Visitor access to the various habitats has also been improved. Entry to the reserve is free for RSPB members, although a fee is charged for non-members. The site is open daily from dawn to dusk, year-round. The visitor centre and facilities are open from 9 am to 5 pm with some seasonal variations. The visitor centre provides a café, picnic area, shop, toilets and baby-changing facilities; guided walks, binocular hire and children's 'explorer packs' are also available. Only <a href="assistance%20dogs">assistance dogs</a> are allowed within the reserve; all other dogs must be kept within the car park or visitor centre, or on the public rights of way that surround the site.

The reserve was featured in the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> "Birdwatch" live TV broadcasts in 1980, 1981 and 1989, and on "<a href="Springwatch">Springwatch</a>" from 2014 to 2016.

The main management objectives at Minsmere are to maintain and improve the wetland, <a href="heath">heath</a> and grassland habitats. Water levels are managed using a system of sluices, surplus water eventually flowing into the sea at the main sluice on the New Cut. The sluices also keep seawater out of the reed beds, allowing control of salinity in the scrape. Vegetation is removed from the lagoons annually, and sections of the scrape are dried out and re-flooded on a five-year rotation. The scrape is protected from predators by an electric fence, improved in 2014 and 2015 when it was realised that <a href="European%20badger">badgers</a> were attacking ground-nesting birds. The reed beds are grazed by <a href="Konik">Konik</a> horses and <a href="Highland%20cattle">Highland cattle</a> while they are drained; this helps maintain the boundary between reed beds and open water areas. This control of reed density provides open water feeding pools for bitterns within the reed beds. The grazing regime was instituted following investigations into similar schemes in Sweden and Denmark.

The heathland and acidic grassland areas of Minsmere are managed by grazing, heather and scrub control and removal of trees and unwanted <a href="Ulex%20gallii">western gorse</a>. The areas of gorse and scrub remaining are cut in rotation to keep the gorse short and dense, providing a scrub structure optimal for nightingales. In 1989, of arable land were purchased in a project to recreate lowland heath and acidic grassland habitat by <a href="Soil%20acidification">acidification</a> of the soil, the aim being to join fragmented patches of heathland together and to provide increased habitat for the stone-curlew, woodlark and nightjar, three threatened bird species. Methods used to acidify the land, which had been arable farmland for 150 years, included grazing by sheep or the addition of <a href="sulfur">sulphur</a>, either with <a href="bracken">bracken</a> and heather waste, or on its own, followed by reseeding.

Minsmere's large size and variety of different habitats, some of which are scarce elsewhere in the UK, make it attractive to many species of animals and plants; around 5800 species have been recorded on the reserve.

As of 2017, 342 bird species have been sighted at Minsmere, of which 230 are annual and more than 100 have bred. In the 1990s the bittern was in serious decline with only one booming male on the reserve. Creation of ditches and pools and better water-level management led to 9–12 males being present annually, and application of these techniques elsewhere has revived the fortunes of this species in the UK as a whole. The <a href="Eurasian%20stone-curlew">stone curlew</a> has also benefited from the creation of suitable bare-ground nesting habitat, and the reserve's population is now nearly 10 pairs each year, against a single pair in Suffolk in the mid-1990s. The <a href="pied%20avocet">avocet</a> first started its recolonisation of Britain in 1947, four pairs breeding a month after the reserve was acquired by the RSPB. Numbers at Minsmere now vary between 40 and about 140 pairs per year.

In 1971, the only nesting pair of marsh harriers in the UK were at Minsmere. The population of this <a href="polygyny">polygynous</a> species reached 17 nesting females in 2007, up from the more typical 8 to 10. Other important species are <a href="bearded%20reedling">bearded tits</a>, woodlarks, nightjars in open habitats, nightingales in the woodlands, and <a href="Dartford%20warbler">Dartford warbler</a>s, which returned to Minsmere's heaths in the mid-1990s, having been lost to the area six decades earlier.

Many wildfowl winter on the reserve, including <a href="Eurasian%20wigeon">wigeon</a>, <a href="gadwall">gadwall</a> and <a href="common%20teal">teal</a>, and easterly winds can bring in passage <a href="bird%20migration">migrants</a>, sometimes in large numbers. These may include uncommon species such as <a href="bluethroat">bluethroat</a>s, <a href="Eurasian%20wryneck">wrynecks</a> and <a href="eurasian%20dotterel">dotterels</a>.

Minsmere's east-coast location and range of habitats make it a major site for rare species. Notable recent occurrences include Great Britain's first <a href="western%20swamphen">western swamphen</a> in 2016, a <a href="black-browed%20albatross">black-browed albatross</a> in 2015, <a href="pallid%20harrier">pallid harrier</a> and <a href="collared%20pratincole">collared pratincole</a> in 2014, and <a href="Audouin%27s%20gull">Audouin's gull</a> and <a href="red-flanked%20bluetail">red-flanked bluetail</a> in 2011.

Mammals found at Minsmere include a herd of about 300 <a href="red%20deer">red deer</a>, <a href="Lutra%20lutra">otter</a>s, badgers and <a href="Arvicola%20amphibius">water vole</a>s, the last being protected by active control of introduced <a href="American%20mink">American mink</a> which have led to major declines elsewhere. Other <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s include <a href="Vipera%20berus">adders</a>, small numbers of <a href="natterjack%20toad">natterjack toad</a>s and 13 species of fish, of which <a href="common%20rudd">common rudd</a> is an important food source for bitterns.

Over 1000 species of <a href="Lepidoptera">moths and butterflies</a> have been found at Minsmere, including a large breeding population of the <a href="silver-studded%20blue">silver-studded blue</a>. Rare species include the <a href="nymphalis%20xanthomelas">scarce tortoiseshell</a> butterfly and Britain's only record of the moth species "<a href="Catocala%20coniuncta">Catocala coniuncta</a>", now given the English name of "Minsmere crimson underwing".
Threatened moths include the <a href="Senta%20flammea">flame wainscot</a>, <a href="Protarchanara%20brevilinea">Fenn's wainscot</a> and <a href="Archanara%20neurica">white-mantled wainscot</a>. The reserve has been colonised by two insect species that are currently expanding their ranges, the <a href="European%20beewolf">European beewolf</a> and the <a href="antlion">antlion</a>, and it also hosts the <a href="Dasypoda">hairy-legged mining bee</a> and the <a href="Typhaeus%20typhoeus">minotaur beetle</a>; the latter large insect is a food item for stone-curlews.

Dead and decaying trees in the woodlands support a wide range of <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s and over 1500 species of fungus, including rare species such as <a href="Clavaria%20argillacea">moor club</a>, <a href="Suillellus%20queletii">deceiving bolete</a> and <a href="Hericium%20erinaceus">lion's mane mushroom</a>. The shingle ridges on the beaches hold a variety of uncommon plants including <a href="Glaucium%20flavum">yellow horned-poppy</a>, <a href="Filago%20%28plant%29">red-tipped cudweed</a> and <a href="Pyrola%20rotundifolia">round-leaved wintergreen</a>.

The Suffolk coast has been subject to incursions from the sea for centuries, particularly notable events being the loss to the sea of most of the once-important town of <a href="Dunwich">Dunwich</a>, next to Minsmere, in a series of storms in 1286, 1328 and 1347, and the <a href="North%20Sea%20flood%20of%201953">1953 storm</a> which caused flooding and destruction in much of eastern England.

Minsmere faces threats from rising sea levels, caused by <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>, which adversely affect the drainage of the reserve and can lead to river flooding. Coastal erosion also threatens the integrity of the reserve. An <a href="Environment%20Agency">Environment Agency</a> assessment in 2011 estimated that Dunwich Heath, the beach at Minsmere and the artificial clay bank behind the beach could suffer severe damage within 20 years, although work by the Environment Agency at the north end of the reserve should hold the sea at bay there for 50 years.

The construction of two new <a href="nuclear%20power%20plant">reactors</a> at the neighbouring <a href="Sizewell%20nuclear%20power%20stations">Sizewell nuclear power</a> site may also have a potential impact on the reserve. The RSPB and others have argued that the water table in the marshes could be adversely affected by the adjacent construction, both through contamination and by a change in water levels. There could also be changes to the coastline caused directly or indirectly by the actual construction.

An article written on behalf of the RSPB suggested that any damage to the wetlands at Minsmere is likely to have a major effect on UK bittern numbers since the reserve holds a significant proportion of the national breeding population. In 2018, expansion plans for Sizewell were called into question by <a href="National%20Infrastructure%20Commission">National Infrastructure Commission</a> proposals to scale back the nuclear power programme on safety and environmental grounds.

Early Netherlandish painting

Early Netherlandish painting is the work of artists, sometimes known as the Flemish Primitives, active in the <a href="Burgundian%20Netherlands">Burgundian</a> and <a href="Habsburg%20Netherlands">Habsburg Netherlands</a> during the 15th- and 16th-century <a href="Northern%20Renaissance">Northern Renaissance</a>, especially in the flourishing cities of <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a>, <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a>, <a href="Mechelen">Mechelen</a>, <a href="Louvain%2C%20Belgium">Louvain</a>, <a href="Tournai">Tournai</a> and <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, all in present-day <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>. The period begins approximately with <a href="Robert%20Campin">Robert Campin</a> and <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a> in the 1420s and lasts at least until the death of <a href="Gerard%20David">Gerard David</a> in 1523, although many scholars extend it to the start of the <a href="Dutch%20Revolt">Dutch Revolt</a> in 1566 or 1568 (<a href="Max%20J.%20Friedl%C3%A4nder">Max J. Friedländer</a>'s acclaimed surveys run through <a href="Pieter%20Bruegel%20the%20Elder">Pieter Bruegel the Elder</a>). Early Netherlandish painting coincides with the Early and <a href="High%20Renaissance">High</a> <a href="Italian%20Renaissance">Italian Renaissance</a> but the early period (until about 1500) is seen as an independent artistic evolution, separate from the <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">Renaissance humanism</a> that characterised developments in Italy, although beginning in the 1490s as increasing numbers of Netherlandish and other Northern painters traveled to Italy, <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> ideals and painting styles were incorporated into Netherlandish and other Northern painting. As a result, Early Netherlandish painters are often categorised as belonging to both the <a href="Northern%20Renaissance">Northern Renaissance</a> and the Late or <a href="International%20Gothic">International Gothic</a>.

The major Netherlandish painters include Campin, van Eyck, <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>, <a href="Dieric%20Bouts">Dieric Bouts</a>, <a href="Petrus%20Christus">Petrus Christus</a>, <a href="Hans%20Memling">Hans Memling</a>, <a href="Hugo%20van%20der%20Goes">Hugo van der Goes</a> and <a href="Hieronymus%20Bosch">Hieronymus Bosch</a>. These artists made significant advances in natural representation and <a href="illusionism%20%28art%29">illusionism</a>, and their work typically features complex <a href="iconography">iconography</a>. Their subjects are usually religious scenes or small portraits, with narrative painting or mythological subjects being relatively rare. Landscape is often richly described but relegated as a background detail before the early 16th century. The painted works are generally oil on panel, either as single works or more complex portable or fixed altarpieces in the form of <a href="diptych">diptych</a>s, <a href="triptych">triptych</a>s or <a href="polyptych">polyptych</a>s. The period is also noted for its sculpture, <a href="tapestry">tapestries</a>, <a href="illuminated%20manuscripts">illuminated manuscripts</a>, <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> and carved <a href="retable">retable</a>s.

The first generations of artists were active during the height of Burgundian influence in Europe, when the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a> became the political and economic centre of Northern Europe, noted for its crafts and luxury goods. Assisted by the workshop system, panels and a variety of crafts were sold to foreign princes or merchants through private engagement or market stalls. A majority of the works were destroyed during waves of <a href="iconoclasm">iconoclasm</a> in the 16th and 17th centuries; today only a few thousand examples survive. Early northern art in general was not well regarded from the early 17th to the mid-19th century, and the painters and their works were not well documented until the mid-19th century. Art historians spent almost another century determining attributions, studying iconography, and establishing bare outlines of even the major artists' lives. Attribution of some of the most significant works is still debated.

Scholarship of Early Netherlandish painting was one of the main activities of 19th- and 20th-century art history, and a major focus of two of the most important art historians of the 20th century: <a href="Max%20J.%20Friedl%C3%A4nder">Max J. Friedländer</a> ("From Van Eyck to Breugel" and "<a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20Painting%20%28Friedl%C3%A4nder%29">Early Netherlandish Painting</a>") and <a href="Erwin%20Panofsky">Erwin Panofsky</a> ("<a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20Painting%20%28Panofsky%29">Early Netherlandish Painting</a>").

The term "Early Netherlandish art" applies broadly to painters active during the 15th and 16th centuries in the northern European areas controlled by the <a href="Burgundian%20Netherlands">Dukes of Burgundy</a> and later the <a href="Seventeen%20Provinces">Habsburg dynasty</a>. These artists became an early driving force behind the Northern Renaissance and the move away from the Gothic style. In this political and art-historical context, the north follows the Burgundian lands which straddled areas that encompass parts of modern France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.

The Netherlandish artists have been known by a variety of terms. "Late Gothic" is an early designation which emphasises continuity with the <a href="medieval%20art">art of the Middle Ages</a>. In the early 20th century, the artists were variously referred to in English as the "<a href="Ghent-Bruges%20school">Ghent-Bruges school</a>" or the "Old Netherlandish school". "Flemish Primitives" is a traditional art-historical term borrowed from the French "primitifs flamands" that became popular after the <a href="Exposition%20des%20primitifs%20flamands%20%C3%A0%20Bruges">famous exhibition in Bruges in 1902</a> and remains in use today, especially in Dutch and German. In this context, "primitive" does not refer to a perceived lack of sophistication, but rather identifies the artists as originators of a new tradition in painting. <a href="Erwin%20Panofsky">Erwin Panofsky</a> preferred the term "<a href="ars%20nova">ars nova</a>" ("new art"), which linked the movement with innovative composers of music such as <a href="Guillaume%20Dufay">Guillaume Dufay</a> and <a href="Gilles%20Binchois">Gilles Binchois</a>, who were favoured by the Burgundian court over artists attached to the lavish French court. When the <a href="House%20of%20Valois-Burgundy">Burgundian dukes</a> established centres of power in the Netherlands, they brought with them a more cosmopolitan outlook. According to <a href="Otto%20P%C3%A4cht">Otto Pächt</a> a simultaneous shift in art began sometime between 1406 and 1420 when a "revolution took place in painting"; a "new beauty" in art emerged, one that depicted the visible rather than the metaphysical world.

In the 19th century the Early Netherlandish artists were classified by nationality, with <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a> identified as German and van der Weyden (born Roger de la Pasture) as French. Scholars were at times preoccupied as to whether the school's genesis was in France or Germany. These arguments and distinctions dissipated after World War I, and following the leads of <a href="Max%20Jakob%20Friedl%C3%A4nder">Friedländer</a>, Panofsky, and Pächt, English-language scholars now almost universally describe the period as "Early Netherlandish painting", although many art historians view the Flemish term as more correct.

In the 14th century, as <a href="Gothic%20art">Gothic art</a> gave way to the <a href="International%20Gothic">International Gothic</a> era, a number of schools developed in northern Europe. Early Netherlandish art originated in French courtly art, and is especially tied to the tradition and conventions of <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a>s. Modern art historians see the era as beginning with 14th-century manuscript illuminators. They were followed by panel painters such as <a href="Melchior%20Broederlam">Melchior Broederlam</a> and <a href="Robert%20Campin">Robert Campin</a>, the latter generally considered the first Early Netherlandish master, under whom van der Weyden served his apprenticeship. Illumination reached a peak in the region in the decades after 1400, mainly due to the patronage of Burgundian and <a href="House%20of%20Valois-Anjou">House of Valois-Anjou</a> dukes such as <a href="Philip%20the%20Bold">Philip the Bold</a>, <a href="Louis%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Anjou">Louis I of Anjou</a> and <a href="Jean%2C%20Duke%20of%20Berry">Jean, Duke of Berry</a>. This patronage continued in the low countries with the Burgundian dukes, <a href="Philip%20the%20Good">Philip the Good</a> and his son <a href="Charles%20the%20Bold">Charles the Bold</a>. The demand for illuminated manuscripts declined towards the end of the century, perhaps because of the costly production process in comparison to panel painting. Yet illumination remained popular at the luxury end of the market, and <a href="old%20master%20print">prints</a>, both <a href="engraving">engraving</a>s and <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a>s, found a new mass market, especially those by artists such as <a href="Martin%20Schongauer">Martin Schongauer</a> and <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a>.
Following van Eyck's innovations, the first generation of Netherlandish painters emphasised light and shadow, elements usually absent from 14th-century illuminated manuscripts. Biblical scenes were depicted with more naturalism, which made their content more accessible to viewers, while individual portraits became more evocative and alive. <a href="Johan%20Huizinga">Johan Huizinga</a> said that art of the era was meant to be fully integrated with daily routine, to "fill with beauty" the devotional life in a world closely tied to the liturgy and sacraments. After about 1500 a number of factors turned against the pervasive Northern style, not least the rise of Italian art, whose commercial appeal began to rival Netherlandish art by 1510, and overtook it some ten years later. Two events symbolically and historically reflect this shift: the transporting of a marble "<a href="Madonna%20of%20Bruges">Madonna and Child</a>" by <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> to Bruges in 1506, and the arrival of <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>'s <a href="Raphael%20Cartoons">tapestry cartoons</a> to Brussels in 1517, which were widely seen while in the city. Although the influence of Italian art was soon widespread across the north, it in turn had drawn on the 15th-century northern painters, with Michelangelo's "Madonna" based on a type developed by <a href="Hans%20Memling">Hans Memling</a>.

Netherlandish painting ends in the narrowest sense with the death of <a href="Gerard%20David">Gerard David</a> in 1523. A number of mid- and late-16th-century artists maintained many of the conventions, and they are frequently but not always associated with the school. The style of these painters is often dramatically at odds with that of the first generation of artists. In the early 16th century, artists began to explore illusionistic depictions of three dimensions. The painting of the early 16th century can be seen as leading directly from the artistic innovations and iconography of the previous century, with some painters, following the traditional and established formats and symbolism of the previous century, continuing to produce copies of previously painted works. Others came under the influence of <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">Renaissance humanism</a>, turning towards secular narrative cycles, as biblical imagery was blended with mythological themes. A full break from the mid-15th-century style and subject matter was not seen until the development of <a href="Northern%20Mannerism">Northern Mannerism</a> around 1590. There was considerable overlap, and the early- to mid-16th-century innovations can be tied to the Mannerist style, including naturalistic secular portraiture, the depiction of ordinary (as opposed to courtly) life, and the development of elaborate landscapes and cityscapes that were more than background views.

The origins of the Early Netherlandish school lie in the miniature paintings of the late Gothic period. This was first seen in manuscript illumination, which after 1380 conveyed new levels of realism, perspective and skill in rendering colour, peaking with the <a href="Limbourg%20brothers">Limbourg brothers</a> and the Netherlandish artist known as Hand G, to whom the most significant leaves of the <a href="Turin-Milan%20Hours">Turin-Milan Hours</a> are usually attributed. Although his identity has not been definitively established, Hand G, who contributed c. 1420, is thought to have been either Jan van Eyck or his brother <a href="Hubert%20van%20Eyck">Hubert</a>. According to <a href="Georges%20Hulin%20de%20Loo">Georges Hulin de Loo</a>, Hand G's contributions to the Turin-Milan Hours "constitute the most marvelous group of paintings that have ever decorated any book, and, for their period, the most astounding work known to the history of art".

Jan van Eyck's use of oil as a medium was a significant development, allowing artists far greater manipulation of paint. The 16th-century art historian <a href="Giorgio%20Vasari">Giorgio Vasari</a> claimed van Eyck invented the use of oil paint; a claim that, while exaggerated, indicates the extent to which van Eyck helped disseminate the technique. Van Eyck employed a new level of virtuosity, mainly from taking advantage of the fact that oil dries so slowly; this gave him more time and more scope for blending and mixing layers of different pigments, and his technique was quickly adopted and refined by both Robert Campin and <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>. These three artists are considered the first rank and most influential of the early generation of Early Netherlandish painters. Their influence was felt across northern Europe, from <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a> and Poland in the east to Austria and <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a> in the south.
A number of artists traditionally associated with the movement had origins that were neither Dutch nor Flemish in the modern sense. Van der Weyden was born Roger de la Pasture in <a href="Tournai">Tournai</a>. The German Hans Memling and the Estonian <a href="Michael%20Sittow">Michael Sittow</a> both worked in the Netherlands in a fully Netherlandish style. <a href="Simon%20Marmion">Simon Marmion</a> is often regarded as an Early Netherlandish painter because he came from <a href="Amiens">Amiens</a>, an area intermittently ruled by the Burgundian court between 1435 and 1471. The Burgundian duchy was at its peak influence, and the innovations made by the Netherlandish painters were soon recognised across the continent. By the time of van Eyck's death, his paintings were sought by wealthy patrons across Europe. Copies of his works were widely circulated, a fact that greatly contributed to the spread of the Netherlandish style to central and southern Europe. Central European art was then under the dual influence of innovations from Italy and from the north. Often the exchange of ideas between the Low Countries and Italy led to patronage from nobility such as <a href="Matthias%20Corvinus">Matthias Corvinus</a>, <a href="King%20of%20Hungary">King of Hungary</a>, who commissioned manuscripts from both traditions.

The first generation were literate, well educated and mostly from middle-class backgrounds. Van Eyck and van der Weyden were both highly placed in the Burgundian court, with van Eyck in particular assuming roles for which an ability to read Latin was necessary; inscriptions found on his panels indicate that he had a good knowledge of both Latin and Greek. A number of artists were financially successful and much sought-after in the Low Countries and by patrons across Europe. Many artists, including David and Bouts, could afford to donate large works to the churches, monasteries and convents of their choosing. Van Eyck was a <a href="valet%20de%20chambre">valet de chambre</a> at the Burgundian court and had easy access to Philip the Good. Van der Weyden was a prudent investor in stocks and property; Bouts was commercially minded and married the heiress Catherine "Mettengelde" ("with the money"). <a href="Vrancke%20van%20der%20Stockt">Vrancke van der Stockt</a> invested in land.

The Early Netherlandish masters' influence reached artists such as <a href="Stefan%20Lochner">Stefan Lochner</a> and the painter known as the <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Life%20of%20the%20Virgin">Master of the Life of the Virgin</a>, both of whom, working in mid-15th-century <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, drew inspiration from imported works by van der Weyden and Bouts. New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up; <a href="Ulm">Ulm</a>, <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>, <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> and <a href="Munich">Munich</a> were the most important artistic centres in the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> at the start of the 16th century. There was a rise in demand for <a href="printmaking">printmaking</a> (using woodcuts or copperplate <a href="engraving">engraving</a>) and other innovations borrowed from France and southern Italy. Some 16th-century painters borrowed heavily from the previous century's techniques and styles. Even progressive artists such as <a href="Jan%20Gossaert">Jan Gossaert</a> made copies, such as his reworking of van Eyck's "<a href="Madonna%20in%20the%20Church">Madonna in the Church</a>". Gerard David linked the styles of <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> and <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, often travelling between the cities. He moved to Antwerp in 1505, when Quentin Matsys was the head of the local <a href="Guild%20of%20Saint%20Luke">painters' guild</a>, and the two became friends.

By the 16th century the iconographic innovations and painterly techniques developed by van Eyck had become standard throughout northern Europe. Albrecht Dürer emulated van Eyck's precision. Painters enjoyed a new level of respect and status; patrons no longer simply commissioned works but courted the artists, sponsoring their travel and exposing them to new and wide-ranging influences. <a href="Hieronymus%20Bosch">Hieronymus Bosch</a>, active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, remains one of the most important and popular of the Netherlandish painters. He was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective, while his work is almost entirely free of Italian influences. His better-known works are instead characterised by fantastical elements that tend towards the hallucinatory, drawing to some extent from the vision of hell in van Eyck's "<a href="Crucifixion%20and%20Last%20Judgement%20diptych">Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych</a>". Bosch followed his own muse, tending instead towards moralism and pessimism. His paintings, especially the <a href="triptych">triptych</a>s, are among the most significant and accomplished of the late Netherlandish period

The <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a> brought changes in outlook and artistic expression as secular and landscape imagery overtook biblical scenes. Sacred imagery was shown in a didactic and moralistic manner, with religious figures becoming marginalized and relegated to the background. <a href="Pieter%20Bruegel%20the%20Elder">Pieter Bruegel the Elder</a>, one of the few who followed Bosch's style, is an important bridge between the Early Netherlandish artists and their successors. His work retains many 15th-century conventions, but his perspective and subjects are distinctly modern. Sweeping landscapes came to the fore in paintings that were provisionally religious or mythological, and his <a href="genre%20art">genre scenes</a> were complex, with overtones of religious skepticism and even hints of nationalism.

Campin, van Eyck and van der Weyden established <a href="Realism%20%28arts%29">naturalism</a> as the dominant style in 15th-century northern European painting. These artists sought to show the world as it actually was, and to depict people in a way that made them look more human, with a greater complexity of emotions than had been previously seen. This first generation of Early Netherlandish artists were interested in the accurate reproduction of objects (according to Panofsky they painted "gold that looked like gold"), paying close attention to natural phenomena such as light, shadow and <a href="Reflection%20%28physics%29">reflection</a>. They moved beyond the flat <a href="Perspective%20%28visual%29">perspective</a> and outlined figuration of earlier painting in favour of three-dimensional pictorial spaces. The position of viewers and how they might relate to the scene became important for the first time; in the "<a href="Arnolfini%20Portrait">Arnolfini Portrait</a>", Van Eyck arranges the scene as if the viewer has just entered the room containing the two figures. Advancements in technique allowed far richer, more luminous and closely detailed representations of people, landscapes, interiors and objects.
Although, the use of oil as a <a href="Binder%20%28material%29">binding agent</a> can be traced to the 12th century, innovations in its handling and manipulation define the era. <a href="Tempera">Egg tempera</a> was the dominant medium until the 1430s, and while it produces both bright and light colours, it dries quickly and is a difficult medium in which to achieve naturalistic textures or deep shadows. Oil allows smooth, translucent surfaces and can be applied in a range of thicknesses, from fine lines to thick broad strokes. It dries slowly and is easily manipulated while still wet. These characteristics allowed more time to add subtle detail and enable <a href="wet-on-wet">wet-on-wet</a> techniques. Smooth transitions of colour are possible because portions of the intermediary layers of paint can be wiped or removed as the paint dries. Oil enables differentiation among degrees of reflective light, from shadow to bright beams, and minute depictions of light effects through the use of transparent glazes. This new freedom in controlling light effects gave rise to more precise and realistic depictions of surface textures; van Eyck and van der Weyden typically show light falling on surfaces such as jewellery, wooden floors, textiles and household objects.

The paintings were most often made on wood, but sometimes on the less expensive canvas. The wood was usually oak, often imported from the Baltic region, with the preference for radially cut boards which are less likely to warp. Typically the sap was removed and the board well-seasoned before use. Wood supports allow for <a href="Dendrochronology">dendrochronological</a> dating, and the particular use of Baltic oak gives clues as to the artist's location. The panels generally show very high degrees of craftsmanship. <a href="Lorne%20Campbell%20%28art%20historian%29">Lorne Campbell</a> notes that most are "beautifully made and finished objects. It can be extremely difficult to find the joins". Many paintings' frames were altered, repainted or gilded in the 18th and early 19th centuries when it was common practice to break apart hinged Netherlandish pieces so they could be sold as genre pieces. Many surviving panels are painted on both sides or with the reverse bearing family emblems, crests or ancillary outline sketches. In the case of single panels, the markings on the reverse are often wholly unrelated to the obverse and may be later additions, or as Campbell speculates, "done for the artist's amusement". Painting each side of a panel was practical since it prevented the wood from warping. Usually the frames of hinged works were constructed before the individual panels were worked on.

<a href="Glue-size">Glue</a> binder was often used as an inexpensive alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived. Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' "<a href="Virgin%20and%20Child%20with%20Saints%20Barbara%20and%20Catherine">Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine</a>" (c. 1415–25) and Bouts' "<a href="The%20Entombment%20%28Bouts%29">Entombment</a>" (c. 1440–55). The paint was generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush handles. The artists often softened the contours of shadows with their fingers, at times to blot or reduce the <a href="Glaze%20%28painting%20technique%29">glaze</a>.

The most usual way in the 15th century for a patron to commission a piece was to visit a master's workshop. Only a certain number of masters could operate within any city's bounds; they were regulated by artisan <a href="guild">guild</a>s to whom they had to be affiliated to be allowed to operate and receive commissions. Guilds protected and regulated painting, overseeing production, export trade and raw material supply; and they maintained discrete sets of rules for panel painters, cloth painters and book illuminators. For example, the rules set higher citizenship requirements for miniaturists and prohibited them from using oils. Overall, panel painters enjoyed the highest level of protection, with cloth painters ranking below.

Membership of a guild was highly restricted and access was difficult for newcomers. A master was expected to serve an apprenticeship in his region, and show proof of citizenship, which could be obtained through birth in the city or by purchase. Apprenticeship lasted four to five years, ending with the production of a "<a href="masterpiece">masterpiece</a>" that proved his ability as a craftsman, and the payment of a substantial entrance fee. The system was protectionist at a local level through the nuances of the fee system. Although it sought to ensure a high quality of membership, it was a self-governing body that tended to favour wealthy applicants. Guild connections sometimes appear in paintings, most famously in van der Weyden's "<a href="The%20Descent%20from%20the%20Cross%20%28van%20der%20Weyden%29">Descent from the Cross</a>", in which Christ's body is given the t-shape of a <a href="crossbow">crossbow</a> to reflect its commission for a chapel for the <a href="Leuven">Leuven</a> guild of archers.

Workshops typically consisted of a family home for the master and lodging for apprentices. The masters usually built up inventories of pre-painted panels as well as patterns or outline designs for ready sale. With the former, the master was responsible for the overall design of the painting, and typically painted the focal portions, such as the faces, hands and the embroidered parts of the figure's clothing. The more prosaic elements would be left to assistants; in many works it is possible to discern abrupt shifts in style, with the relatively weak <a href="Deesis">Deesis</a> passage in van Eyck's "Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych" being a better-known example. Often a master's workshop was occupied with both the reproduction of copies of proven commercially successful works, and the design of new compositions arising from commissions. In this case, the master would usually produce the <a href="underdrawing">underdrawing</a> or overall composition to be painted by assistants. As a result, many surviving works that evidence first-rank compositions but uninspired execution are attributed to workshop members or followers.

By the 15th century the reach and influence of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries' merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy. The early to mid-century saw great rises in international trade and domestic wealth, leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art. Artists from the area attracted patronage from the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> coast, the north German and Polish regions, the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland. At first, masters had acted as their own dealers, attending fairs where they could also buy frames, panels and pigments. The mid-century saw the development of <a href="art%20dealer">art dealer</a>ship as a profession; the activity became purely commercially driven, dominated by the mercantile class.
Smaller works were not usually produced on commission. More often the masters anticipated the formats and images that would be most sought after and their designs were then developed by workshop members. Ready made paintings were sold at regularly held fairs, or the buyers could visit workshops, which tended to be clustered in certain areas of the major cities. The masters were allowed to display in their front windows. This was the typical mode for the thousands of panels produced for the middle class – city officials, clergy, guild members, doctors and merchants.

Less expensive cloth paintings ("<a href="Glue-size">tüchlein</a>") were more common in middle-class households, and records show a strong interest in domestically owned religious panel paintings. Members of the merchant class typically commissioned smaller devotional panels, containing specified subject matter. Alterations varied from having individualised panels added to a prefabricated pattern, to the inclusion of a donor portrait. The addition of coats-of-arms were often the only change – an addition seen in van der Weyden's "<a href="Saint%20Luke%20Drawing%20the%20Virgin">Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin</a>", which exists in several variations.

Many of the Burgundian dukes could afford to be extravagant in their taste. Philip the Good followed the example set earlier in France by his great-uncles including <a href="John%2C%20Duke%20of%20Berry">John, Duke of Berry</a> by becoming a strong patron of the arts and commissioning a large number of artworks. The Burgundian court was seen as the arbiter of taste and their appreciation in turn drove demand for highly luxurious and expensive illuminated manuscripts, gold-edged tapestries and jewel-bordered cups. Their appetite for finery trickled down through their court and nobles to the people who for the most part commissioned local artists in Bruges and Ghent in the 1440s and 1450s. While Netherlandish panel paintings did not have intrinsic value as did for example objects in precious metals, they were perceived as precious objects and in the first rank of European art. A 1425 document written by Philip the Good explains that he hired a painter for the "excellent work that he does in his craft". Jan van Eyck painted the "<a href="Annunciation%20%28van%20Eyck%2C%20Washington%29">Annunciation</a>" while in Philip's employ, and Rogier van der Weyden became the duke's portrait painter in the 1440s.
Burgundian rule created a large class of courtiers and functionaries. Some gained enormous power and commissioned paintings to display their wealth and influence. Civic leaders also commissioned works from major artists, such as Bouts' "", van der Weyden's "<a href="The%20Justice%20of%20Trajan%20and%20Herkinbald">The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald</a>" and David's "". Civic commissions were less common and were not as lucrative, but they brought notice to and increased a painter's reputation, as with Memling, whose "<a href="St%20John%20Altarpiece%20%28Memling%29">St John Altarpiece</a>" for Bruges' <a href="Old%20St.%20John%27s%20Hospital">Sint-Janshospitaal</a> brought him additional civic commissions.

Wealthy foreign patronage and the development of international trade afforded the established masters the chance to build up workshops with assistants. Although first-rank painters such as <a href="Petrus%20Christus">Petrus Christus</a> and Hans Memling found patrons among the local nobility, they catered specifically to the large foreign population in Bruges. Painters not only exported goods but also themselves; foreign princes and nobility, striving to emulate the opulence of the Burgundian court, hired painters away from Bruges.

The paintings of the first generation of Netherlandish artists are often characterised by the use of symbolism and biblical references. Van Eyck pioneered, and his innovations were taken up and developed by van der Weyden, Memling and Christus. Each employed rich and complex iconographical elements to create a heightened sense of contemporary beliefs and spiritual ideals. Morally the works express a fearful outlook, combined with a respect for restraint and stoicism. The paintings above all emphasise the spiritual over the earthly. Because the cult of Mary was at an apex at the time, iconographic elements related to the "<a href="Life%20of%20the%20Virgin">Life of Mary</a>" vastly predominate.

Craig Harbison describes the blending of realism and symbolism as perhaps "the most important aspect of early Flemish art". The first generation of Netherlandish painters were preoccupied with making religious symbols more realistic. Van Eyck incorporated a wide variety of iconographic elements, often conveying what he saw as a co-existence of the spiritual and material worlds. The iconography was embedded in the work unobtrusively; typically the references comprised small but key background details. The embedded symbols were meant to meld into the scenes and "was a deliberate strategy to create an experience of spiritual revelation". Van Eyck's religious paintings in particular "always present the spectator with a transfigured view of visible reality". To him the day-to-day is harmoniously steeped in symbolism, such that, according to Harbison, "descriptive data were rearranged ... so that they illustrated not earthly existence but what he considered supernatural truth." This blend of the earthly and heavenly evidences van Eyck's belief that the "essential truth of Christian doctrine" can be found in "the marriage of secular and sacred worlds, of reality and symbol". He depicts overly large Madonnas, whose unrealistic size shows the separation between the heavenly from earthly, but placed them in everyday settings such as churches, domestic chambers or seated with court officials.

Yet the earthly churches are heavily decorated with heavenly symbols. A heavenly throne is clearly represented in some domestic chambers (for example in the "<a href="Lucca%20Madonna">Lucca Madonna</a>"). More difficult to discern are the settings for paintings such as "Madonna of Chancellor Rolin", where the location is a fusion of the earthly and celestial. Van Eyck's iconography is often so densely and intricately layered that a work has to be viewed multiple times before even the most obvious meaning of an element is apparent. The symbols were often subtly woven into the paintings so that they only became apparent after close and repeated viewing, while much of the iconography reflects the idea that, according to John Ward, there is a "promised passage from sin and death to salvation and rebirth".

Other artists employed symbolism in a more prosaic manner, despite van Eyck's great influence on both his contemporaries and later artists. Campin showed a clear separation between spiritual and earthly realms; unlike van Eyck, he did not employ a programme of concealed symbolism. Campin's symbols do not alter the sense of the real; in his paintings a domestic scene is no more complicated than a one showing religious iconography, but one the viewer would recognise and understand. Van der Weyden's symbolism was far more nuanced than Campin's but not as dense as van Eyck's. According to Harbison, van der Weyden incorporated his symbols so carefully, and in such an exquisite manner, that "Neither the mystical union that results in his work, nor his reality itself for that matter, seems capable of being rationally analyzed, explained or reconstructed." His treatment of architectural details, <a href="Niche%20%28architecture%29">niches</a>, colour and space is presented in such an inexplicable manner that "the particular objects or people we see before us have suddenly, jarringly, become symbols with religious truth".
Paintings and other precious objects served an important aid in the religious life of those who could afford them. Prayer and meditative contemplation were means to attain salvation, while the very wealthy could also build churches (or extend existing ones), or commission artworks or other devotional pieces as a means to guarantee salvation in the afterlife. Vast numbers of Virgin and Child paintings were produced, and original designs were widely copied and exported. Many of the paintings were based on <a href="Byzantine%20art">Byzantine</a> prototypes of the 12th and 13th century, of which the "<a href="Cambrai%20Madonna">Cambrai Madonna</a>" is probably the best known. In this way the traditions of the earlier centuries were absorbed and re-developed as a distinctly rich and complex iconographical tradition.

Marian devotion grew from the 13th century, mostly forming around the concepts of the <a href="Immaculate%20Conception">Immaculate Conception</a> and her <a href="Assumption%20of%20Mary">Assumption into heaven</a>. In a culture that venerated the possession of <a href="relic">relic</a>s as a means to bring the earthly closer to the divine, Mary left no bodily relics, thus assuming a special position between heaven and humanity. By the early 15th century, Mary had grown in importance within the Christian doctrine to the extent that she was commonly seen as the most accessible intercessor with God. It was thought that the length each person would need to suffer in <a href="limbo">limbo</a> was proportional to their display of devotion while on earth. The veneration of Mary reached a peak in the early 15th century, an era that saw an unending demand for works depicting her likeness. From the mid-15th century, Netherlandish portrayals of the life of Christ tended to be centred on the iconography of the <a href="Man%20of%20Sorrows">Man of Sorrows</a>.

Those who could afford to commissioned <a href="donor%20portrait">donor portrait</a>s. Such a commission was usually executed as part of a triptych, or later as a more affordable diptych. Van der Weyden popularised the existing northern tradition of half-length <a href="Madonna%20%28art%29">Marian portraits</a>. These echoed the "miracle-working" Byzantine icons then popular in Italy. The format became extremely popular across the north, and his innovations are an important contributing factor to the emergence of the Marian diptych.
Although the Netherlandish artists are primarily known for their panel paintings, their output includes a variety of formats, including illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, tapestries, carved <a href="retable">retable</a>s, <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a>, brass objects and carved <a href="tomb">tomb</a>s. According to art historian <a href="Susie%20Nash">Susie Nash</a>, by the early 16th century, the region led the field in almost every aspect of portable visual culture, "with specialist expertise and techniques of production at such a high level that no one else could compete with them". The Burgundian court favoured tapestry and <a href="metalwork">metalwork</a>, which are well recorded in surviving documentation, while demand for panel paintings is less evident – they may have been less suited to itinerant courts. Wall hangings and books functioned as political propaganda and as a means to showcase wealth and power, whereas portraits were less favoured. According to Maryan Ainsworth, those that were commissioned functioned to highlight lines of succession, such as van der Weyden's of Charles the Bold; or for betrothals as in the case of van Eyck's lost "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Isabella%20of%20Portugal%20%28van%20Eyck%29">Portrait of Isabella of Portugal</a>".

Religious paintings were commissioned for royal and ducal palaces, for churches, hospitals, and convents, and for wealthy clerics and private donors. The richer cities and towns commissioned works for their civic buildings. Artists often worked in more than one medium; van Eyck and Petrus Christus are both thought to have contributed to manuscripts. Van der Weyden designed tapestries, though few survive. The Netherlandish painters were responsible for many innovations, including the advancement of the diptych format, the conventions of <a href="donor%20portrait">donor portrait</a>s, new conventions for Marian portraits, and, through works such as van Eyck's "Madonna of Chancellor Rolin" and van der Weyden's "<a href="Saint%20Luke%20Drawing%20the%20Virgin">Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin</a>" in the 1430s, laying the foundation for the development of <a href="landscape%20art">landscape painting</a> as a separate genre.

Before the mid-15th century, illuminated books were considered a higher form of art than panel painting, and their ornate and luxurious qualities better reflected the wealth, status and taste of their owners. Manuscripts were ideally suited as <a href="diplomatic%20gift">diplomatic gift</a>s or offerings to commemorate dynastic marriages or other major courtly occasions. From the 12th century, specialist monastery-based workshops (in French "libraires") produced <a href="books%20of%20hours">books of hours</a> (collections of prayers to be said at <a href="canonical%20hours">canonical hours</a>), <a href="psalter">psalter</a>s, prayer books and histories, as well as romance and poetry books. At the start of the 15th century, Gothic manuscripts from Paris dominated the northern European market. Their popularity was in part due to the production of more affordable, single leaf miniatures which could be inserted into unillustrated books of hours. These were at times offered in a serial manner designed to encourage patrons to "include as many pictures as they could afford", which clearly presented them as an item of fashion but also as form of <a href="indulgence">indulgence</a>. The single leaves had other uses rather than inserts; they could be attached to walls as aids to private meditation and prayer, as seen in Christus' 1450–60 panel "Portrait of a Young Man", now in the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a>, which shows a small leaf with text to the "<a href="Veil%20of%20Veronica">Vera icon</a>" illustrated with the head of Christ. The French artists were overtaken in importance from the mid-15th century by masters in Ghent, Bruges and <a href="Utrecht">Utrecht</a>. English production, once of the highest quality, had greatly declined and relatively few Italian manuscripts went north of the Alps. The French masters did not give up their position easily however, and even in 1463 were urging their guilds to impose sanctions on the Netherlandish artists.

The <a href="Limbourg%20brothers">Limbourg brothers</a>'s ornate "<a href="Tr%C3%A8s%20Riches%20Heures%20du%20Duc%20de%20Berry">Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry</a>" perhaps marks both the beginning and a highpoint of Netherlandish illumination. Later the <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Legend%20of%20Saint%20Lucy">Master of the Legend of Saint Lucy</a> explored the same mix of illusionism and realism. The Limbourgs' career ended just as van Eyck's began – by 1416 all the brothers (none of whom had reached 30) and their patron Jean, Duke of Berry were dead, most likely from <a href="Black%20death">plague</a>. Van Eyck is thought to have contributed several of the more acclaimed <a href="Miniature%20%28illuminated%20manuscript%29">miniatures</a> of the Turin-Milan Hours as the anonymous artist known as Hand G. A number of illustrations from the period show a strong stylistic resemblance to Gerard David, though it is unclear whether they are from his hands or those of followers.
A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of <a href="Liturgical%20book">liturgical texts</a>. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's "library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and <a href="Margaret%20of%20York">Margaret of York</a>; his granddaughter <a href="Mary%20of%20Burgundy">Mary of Burgundy</a> and her husband <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian I</a>; and to his son-in-law, <a href="Edward%20IV%20of%20England">Edward IV</a>, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the <a href="Royal%20Library%20of%20Belgium">Royal Library of Belgium</a> and the <a href="Royal%20manuscripts%2C%20British%20Library">English Royal Library</a>.

Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, <a href="James%20IV%20of%20Scotland">James IV of Scotland</a> and <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Viseu">Eleanor of Viseu</a>.
There was considerable overlap between panel painting and illumination; van Eyck, van der Weyden, Christus and other painters designed manuscript miniatures. In addition, miniaturists would borrow motifs and ideas from panel paintings; Campin's work was often used as a source in this way, for example in the "Hours of Raoul d'Ailly". Commissions were often shared between several masters, with junior painters or specialists assisting, especially with details such as the border decorations, these last often done by women. The masters rarely signed their work, making attribution difficult; the identities of some of the more significant illuminators are lost.

Netherlandish artists found increasingly inventive ways to highlight and differentiate their work from manuscripts from surrounding countries; such techniques included designing elaborate page borders and devising ways to relate scale and space. They explored the interplay between the three essential components of a manuscript: border, miniature and text. An example is the <a href="Hours%20of%20Mary%20of%20Burgundy">Nassau book of hours</a> (c. 1467–80) by the <a href="Vienna%20Master%20of%20Mary%20of%20Burgundy">Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy</a>, in which the borders are decorated with large illusionistic flowers and insects. These elements achieved their effect by being broadly painted, as if scattered across the gilded surface of the miniatures. This technique was continued by, among others, the Flemish <a href="Master%20of%20James%20IV%20of%20Scotland">Master of James IV of Scotland</a> (possibly <a href="Gerard%20Horenbout">Gerard Horenbout</a>), known for his innovative page layout. Using various illusionistic elements, he often blurred the line between the miniature and its border, frequently using both in his efforts to advance the narrative of his scenes.

During the early 19th century, the collection of 15th- and 16th-century Netherlandish cut-out, as miniatures or parts for albums, became fashionable amongst connoisseurs such as <a href="William%20Young%20Ottley">William Young Ottley</a>, leading to the destruction of many manuscripts. Originals were highly sought after, a revival that helped the rediscovery of Netherlandish art in the later part of the century.

During the mid-15th century, <a href="tapestry">tapestry</a> was one of the most expensive and prized artistic products in Europe. Commercial production proliferated across the Netherlands and northern France from the early 15th century, especially in the cities of <a href="Arras">Arras</a>, Bruges and <a href="Tournai">Tournai</a>. The perceived technical ability of these artisans was such that, in 1517, <a href="Pope%20Julius%20II">Pope Julius II</a> sent <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>'s <a href="Raphael%20Cartoons">cartoons</a> to Brussels to be woven into hangings. Such woven wall hangings played a central political role as diplomatic gifts, especially in their larger format; Philip the Good gifted several to participants at the <a href="Congress%20of%20Arras">Congress of Arras</a> in 1435, where the halls were draped from top to bottom and all around ("tout autour") with tapestries showing scenes of the "Battle and Overthrow of People of Liege". At Charles the Bold and Margaret of York's wedding the room "was hung above with draperies of wool, blue and white, and on the sides was tapestried with a rich tapestry woven with the history of Jason and the Golden Fleece". Rooms typically were hung from ceiling to floor with tapestries and some rooms named for a set of tapestries, such as a chamber Philip the Bold named for a set of white tapestries with scenes from "<a href="Roman%20de%20la%20Rose">The Romance of the Rose</a>". For about two centuries during the Burgundian period, master weavers produced "innumerable series of hangings heavy with gold and silver thread, the like of which the world had never seen".

The practical use of textiles results from their portability; tapestries provided easily assembled interior decorations suited to religious or civic ceremonies. Their value is reflected in their positioning in contemporary inventories, in which they are typically found at the top of the record, then ranked in accordance with their material or colouring. White and gold were considered of the highest quality. <a href="Charles%20V%20of%20France">Charles V of France</a> had 57 tapestries, of which 16 were white. <a href="John%2C%20Duke%20of%20Berry">Jean de Berry</a> owned 19, while <a href="Mary%20of%20Burgundy">Mary of Burgundy</a>, <a href="Isabella%20of%20Valois">Isabella of Valois</a>, <a href="Isabeau%20of%20Bavaria">Isabeau of Bavaria</a> and Philip the Good all held substantial collections.

Tapestry production began with design. The designs, or <a href="Cartoon%23Fine%20art">cartoons</a> were typically executed on paper or parchment, put together by qualified painters, then sent to weavers, often across a great distance. Because cartoons could be re-used, craftsmen often worked on source material that was decades old. As both paper and parchment are highly perishable, few of the original cartoons survive. Once a design was agreed upon its production might be farmed out among many weavers. Looms were active in all the major Flemish cities, in most of the towns and in many of the villages.
Looms were not controlled by the guilds. Dependent on a migrant workforce, their commercial activity was driven by entrepreneurs, who were usually painters. The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to be imported. The entrepreneur was in direct contact with the patron, and they would often go through the nuances of the design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by <a href="Colart%20de%20Laon">Colart de Laon</a> having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon's – and presumably his commissioner's – considerable embarrassment.

Because tapestries were designed largely by painters, their formal conventions are closely aligned with the conventions of panel painting. This is especially true with the later generations of 16th-century painters who produced panoramas of heaven and hell. Harbison describes how the intricate, dense and overlaid detail of Bosch's "<a href="The%20Garden%20of%20Earthly%20Delights">Garden of Earthly Delights</a>" resembles, "in its precise symbolism ... a medieval tapestry".

Northern <a href="triptych">triptych</a>s and <a href="polyptych">polyptych</a>s were popular across Europe from the late 14th century, with the peak of demand lasting until the early 16th century. During the 15th century, they were the most widely produced format of northern panel painting. Preoccupied with religious subject matter, they come in two broad types: smaller, portable private devotional works, or larger altarpieces for <a href="liturgy">liturgical</a> settings. The earliest northern examples are compound works incorporating engraving and painting, usually with two painted wings that could be folded over a carved central corpus.
Polyptychs were produced by the more accomplished masters. They provide greater scope for variation, and a greater number of possible combinations of interior and exterior panels that could be viewed at one time. That hinged works could be opened and closed served a practical purpose; on religious holidays the more prosaic and everyday outer panels were replaced by the lush interior panels. The "<a href="Ghent%20Altarpiece">Ghent Altarpiece</a>", completed in 1432, had different configurations for weekdays, Sundays and church holidays.

The first generation of Netherlandish masters borrowed many customs from 13th- and 14th-century Italian altarpieces. The conventions for Italian triptychs before 1400 were quite rigid. In central panels the mid-ground was populated by members of the <a href="Holy%20Family">Holy Family</a>; early works, especially from the <a href="Siena">Sienese</a> or Florentine traditions, were overwhelmingly characterised by images of the enthroned Virgin set against a gilded background. The wings usually contain a variety of angels, donors and saints, but there is never direct eye contact, and only rarely a narrative connection, with the central panel's figures. Netherlandish painters adapted many of these conventions, but subverted them almost from the start. Van der Weyden was especially innovative, as apparent in his 1442–45 "<a href="Miraflores%20Altarpiece">Miraflores Altarpiece</a>" and c. 1452 "<a href="Braque%20Triptych">Braque Triptych</a>". In these paintings members of the Holy Family appear on the wings instead of just the central panels, while the latter is notable for the continuous landscape connecting the three inner panels. From the 1490s Hieronymus Bosch painted at least 16 triptychs, the best of which subverted existing conventions. Bosch's work continued the move towards secularism and emphasised landscape. Bosch also unified the scenes of the inner panels.

Triptychs were commissioned by German patrons from the 1380s, with large-scale export beginning around 1400. Few of these very early examples survive, but the demand for Netherlandish altarpieces throughout Europe is evident from the many surviving examples still extant in churches across the continent. <a href="Till-Holger%20Borchert">Till-Holger Borchert</a> describes how they bestowed a "prestige which, in the first half of the 15th century, only the workshops of the Burgundian Netherlands were capable of achieving". By the 1390s, Netherlandish altarpieces were produced mostly in Brussels and Bruges. The popularity of Brussels' altarpieces lasted until about 1530, when the output of the Antwerp workshops grew in favour. This was in part because they produced at a lower cost by allocating different portions of the panels among specialised workshop members, a practice Borchert describes as an early form of <a href="division%20of%20labour">division of labour</a>.

Multi-panel Netherlandish paintings fell out of favour and were considered old-fashioned as Antwerp Mannerism came to the fore in the mid-16th century. Later the <a href="iconoclasm">iconoclasm</a> of the Reformation deemed them offensive, and many works in the Low Countries were destroyed. Extant examples are found mostly in German churches and monasteries. As secular works grew in demand, triptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works, especially if a panel or section contained an image that could pass as a secular portrait. A panel would sometimes be cut down to only the figure, with the background over-painted so that "it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well-known collection of Dutch 17th-century paintings".

<a href="Diptych">Diptych</a>s were widely popular in northern Europe from the mid-15th to the early 16th century. They consisted of two equally sized panels joined by hinges (or, less often, a fixed frame); the panels were usually linked thematically. Hinged panels could be opened and closed like a book, allowing both an interior and exterior view, while the ability to close the wings allowed protection of the inner images. Originating from conventions in <a href="Book%20of%20Hours">Books of Hours</a>, diptychs typically functioned as less expensive and more portable altarpieces. Diptychs are distinct from pendants in that they are physically connected wings and not merely two paintings hung side by side. They were usually near-miniature in scale, and some emulated medieval "treasury art" -small pieces made of gold or ivory. The <a href="tracery">tracery</a> seen in works such as van der Weyden's "<a href="Virgin%20and%20Child%20Enthroned%20%28van%20der%20Weyden%29">Virgin and Child</a>" reflects ivory carving of the period. The format was adapted by van Eyck and van der Weyden on commission from members of the <a href="House%20of%20Valois-Burgundy">House of Valois-Burgundy</a>, and refined by <a href="Hugo%20van%20der%20Goes">Hugo van der Goes</a>, Hans Memling and later <a href="Jan%20van%20Scorel">Jan van Scorel</a>.
Netherlandish diptychs tend to illustrate only a small range of religious scenes. There are numerous depictions of the Virgin and Child, reflecting the Virgin's contemporary popularity as a subject of devotion. The inner panels consisted mainly of donor portraits – often of husbands and their wives – alongside saints or the Virgin and Child. The donor was nearly always shown kneeling in full or half length, with hands clasped in prayer. The Virgin and Child are always positioned on the right, reflecting the Christian reverence for the right hand side as the "place of honour" alongside the divine.

Their development and commercial worth has been linked to a change in religious attitude during the 14th century, when a more meditative and solitary devotion – exemplified by the <a href="Devotio%20Moderna">Devotio Moderna</a> movement – grew in popularity. Private reflection and prayer was encouraged and the small-scale diptych fitted this purpose. It became popular among the newly emerging middle class and the more affluent monasteries across the Low Countries and northern Germany. Ainsworth says that regardless of size, whether a large altarpiece or a small diptych, Netherlandish painting is a "matter of small scale and meticulous detail". The small size was meant to entice the viewer into a meditative state for personal devotion and perhaps the "experience of miraculous visions".

Late 20th-century technical examination has shown significant differences in technique and style between the panels of individual diptychs. The technical inconsistencies may be the result of the workshop system, in which the more prosaic passages were often completed by assistants. A change in style between panels can be seen, according to historian John Hand, because the divine panel was usually based on general designs sold on the open market, with the donor panel added after a patron was found.

Few intact diptychs survive. As with altarpieces, the majority were later separated and sold as single "genre" pictures. In the workshop system some were interchangeable, and the religious works may have been paired with newly commissioned donor panels. Later many diptychs were broken apart, thus creating two saleable works from one. During the Reformation, religious scenes were often removed.
Secular portraiture was a rarity in European art before 1430. The format did not exist as a separate genre and was only found infrequently at the highest end of the market in betrothal portraits or royal family commissions. While such undertakings may have been profitable, they were considered a lower art form and the majority of surviving pre-16th-century examples are unattributed. Large numbers of single devotional panels showing saints and biblical figures were being produced, but depictions of historical, known individuals did not begin until the early 1430s. Van Eyck was the pioneer; his seminal 1432 "<a href="L%C3%A9al%20Souvenir">Léal Souvenir</a>" is one of the earliest surviving examples, emblematic of the new style in its realism and acute observation of the small details of the sitter's appearance. His "<a href="Arnolfini%20Portrait">Arnolfini Portrait</a>" is filled with symbolism, as is the "Madonna of Chancelor Rolin", commissioned as testament to Rolin's power, influence, and piety.

Van der Weyden developed the conventions of northern portraiture and was hugely influential on the following generations of painters. Rather than merely follow van Eyck's meticulous attention to detail, van der Weyden created more abstract and sensual representations. He was highly sought after as a portraitist, yet there are noticeable similarities in his portraits, likely because he used and reused the same underdrawings, which met common ideals of rank and piety. These were then adapted to show the facial characteristics and expressions of the particular sitter.

Petrus Christus placed his sitter in a naturalistic setting rather than a flat and featureless background. This approach was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces. In his 1462 "", Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape, while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in <a href="fresco">fresco</a> and illuminated manuscripts. Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power. Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo</a>'s positioning of the "<a href="Mona%20Lisa">Mona Lisa</a>" in front of a landscape view. Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist <a href="Jean%20Fouquet">Jean Fouquet</a> and the Germans <a href="Hans%20Pleydenwurff">Hans Pleydenwurff</a> and Martin Schongauer among others.

The Netherlandish artists moved away from the profile view – popularised during the Italian <a href="Quattrocento">Quattrocento</a> – towards the less formal but more engaging three-quarter view. At this angle, more than one side of the face is visible as the sitter's body is rotated towards the viewer. This pose gives a better view of the shape and features of the head and allows the sitter to look out towards the viewer. The gaze of the sitter rarely engages the viewer. Van Eyck's 1433 "<a href="Portrait%20of%20a%20Man%20%28Self%20Portrait%3F%29">Portrait of a Man</a>" is an early example, which shows the artist himself looking at the viewer. Although there is often direct eye contact between subject and viewer, the look is normally detached, aloof and uncommunicative, perhaps to reflect the subject's high social position. There are exceptions, typically in bridal portraits or in the case of potential <a href="betrothal">betrothal</a>s, when the object of the work is to make the sitter as attractive as possible. In these cases the sitter was often shown smiling, with an engaging and radiant expression designed to appeal to her intended.

Around 1508, Albrecht Dürer described the function of portraiture as "preserving a person's appearance after his death". Portraits were objects of status, and served to ensure that the individual's personal success was recorded and would endure beyond his lifetime. Most portraits tended to show royalty, the upper nobility or princes of the church. The new affluence in the Burgundian Netherlands brought a wider variety of clientele, as members of the upper middle class could now afford to commission a portrait. As a result, more is known about the appearance and dress of the region's people than at any time since the late Roman period. Portraits did not generally require lengthy sittings; typically a series of preparatory drawings were used to flesh out the final panel. Very few of these drawings survive, a notable exception being for his "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Cardinal%20Niccol%C3%B2%20Albergati">Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati</a>".

Landscape was a secondary concern to Netherlandish painters before the mid 1460s. Geographical settings were rare and when they did appear usually consisted of glimpses through open windows or <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcades</a>. They were rarely based on actual locations; the settings tended to be largely imagined, designed to suit the thematic thrust of the panel. Because most of the works were donor portraits, very often the landscapes were tame, controlled and served merely to provide a harmonious setting for the idealised interior space. In this, the northern artists lagged behind their Italian counterparts who were already placing their sitters within geographically identifiable and closely described landscapes. Some of the northern landscapes are highly detailed and notable in their own right, including van Eyck's unsentimental c. 1430 "<a href="Crucifixion%20and%20Last%20Judgement%20diptych">Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych</a>" and van der Weyden's widely copied 1435–40 "<a href="Saint%20Luke%20Drawing%20the%20Virgin">Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin</a>".

Van Eyck was almost certainly influenced by the <a href="Labours%20of%20the%20Months">Labours of the Months</a> landscapes the Limbourg brothers painted for the "Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry". The influence can be seen in the illuminations painted in the <a href="Turin-Milan%20Hours">Turin-Milan Hours</a>, which show rich landscapes in the tiny "bas de page" scenes. These, according to Pächt, should be defined as early examples of Netherlandish landscape painting. The landscape tradition in illuminated manuscripts would continue for at least the next century. <a href="Simon%20Bening">Simon Bening</a> "explored new territory in the genre of landscape", seen in several of the leaves he painted for the c. 1520 "<a href="Grimani">Grimani Breviary</a>".

From the late 15th century, a number of painters emphasised landscape in their works, a development led in part by the shift in preference from religious iconography to secular subjects. Second-generation Netherlandish painters applied the mid-14th-century dictum of natural representation. This was born of the rising affluence of the region's middle class, many of whom had now travelled south and seen countryside noticeably different from their flat homeland. At the same time, the later part of the century saw the emergence of specialisation and a number of masters focused on detailing landscape, most notably <a href="Konrad%20Witz">Konrad Witz</a> in the mid-15th century, and later <a href="Joachim%20Patinir">Joachim Patinir</a>. Most innovations in this format came from artists living in the Dutch regions of the Burgundian lands, most notably from <a href="Haarlem">Haarlem</a>, <a href="Leiden">Leiden</a> and <a href="%27s-Hertogenbosch">'s-Hertogenbosch</a>. The significant artists from these areas did not slavishly reproduce the scenery before them, but in subtle ways adapted and modified their landscapes to reinforce the emphasis and meaning of the panel they were working on.

Patinir developed what is now called the <a href="world%20landscape">world landscape</a> genre, which is typified by biblical or historical figures within an imagined panoramic landscape, usually mountains and lowlands, water and buildings. Paintings of this type are characterised by an elevated viewpoint, with the figures dwarfed by their surroundings. The format was taken up by, among others, Gerard David and Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and became popular in Germany, especially with painters from the <a href="Danube%20school">Danube school</a>. Patinir's works are relatively small and use a horizontal format; this was to become so standard for landscapes in art that it is now called "landscape" format in ordinary contexts, but at the time it was a considerable novelty, as the vast majority of panel paintings before 1520 were vertical in format. World landscape paintings retain many of the elements developed from the mid-15th century, but are composed, in modern cinematic terms, as a <a href="long%20shot">long</a> rather than a <a href="medium%20shot">medium shot</a>. The human presence remained central rather than serving as mere <a href="staffage">staffage</a>. Hieronymus Bosch adapted elements of the world landscape style, with the influence especially notable in his single-panel paintings.

The most popular subjects of this type include the <a href="Flight%20into%20Egypt">Flight into Egypt</a> and the plight of hermits such as Saints <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> and <a href="Anthony%20the%20Great">Anthony</a>. As well as connecting the style to the later <a href="Age%20of%20Discovery">Age of Discovery</a>, the role of Antwerp as a booming centre both of world trade and <a href="cartography">cartography</a>, and the wealthy town-dweller's view of the countryside, art historians have explored the paintings as religious metaphors for the pilgrimage of life.

The progressions in northern art developed almost simultaneously with the early <a href="Italian%20Renaissance">Italian Renaissance</a>. The philosophical and artistic traditions of the Mediterranean were not however part of the northern heritage, to the extent that many elements of Latin culture were actively disparaged in the north. The role of Renaissance humanism in art, for example, was less pronounced in the Low Countries than in Italy. Local religious trends had a strong influence on early northern art, as can be seen in the subject matter, composition and form of many late 13th- and early 14th-century artworks. The northern painters' doctrine was also built on elements of recent Gothic tradition, and less on the classical tradition prevalent in Italy.

While devotional paintings – especially altarpieces – remained dominant in Early Netherlandish art, secular portraiture became increasingly common in both northern and southern Europe as artists freed themselves from the prevailing idea that portraiture should be restricted to saints and other religious figures. In Italy this development was tied to the ideals of <a href="humanism">humanism</a>.

Italian influences on Netherlandish art are first apparent in the late 15th century, when some of the painters began to travel south. This also explains why a number of later Netherlandish artists became associated with, in the words of art historian Rolf Toman, "picturesque gables, bloated, barrel-shaped columns, droll cartouches, 'twisted' figures, and stunningly unrealistic colours – actually employ[ing] the visual language of Mannerism". Wealthy northern merchants could afford to buy paintings from the top tier of artists. As a result, painters became increasingly aware of their status in society: they signed their works more often, painted portraits of themselves, and became well-known figures because of their artistic activities.
The northern masters were greatly admired in Italy. According to Friedländer they exercised a strong influence over 15th-century Italian artists, a view Panofsky agrees with. However, Italian painters began to move beyond Netherlandish influences by the 1460s, as they concentrated on composition with a greater emphasis on harmony of parts belonging together – "that elegant harmony and grace ... which is called beauty", evident, for example, in <a href="Andrea%20Mantegna">Andrea Mantegna</a>'s "". By the early 16th century, the reputation of the northern masters was such that there was an established north-south trade in their works, although many of the paintings or objects sent south were by lesser artists and of lower quality. Innovations introduced in the north and adopted in Italy included the setting of figures in domestic interiors and the viewing of interiors from multiple vantage points, through openings such as doors or windows. Hugo van der Goes' "<a href="Portinari%20Altarpiece">Portinari Altarpiece</a>", in Florence's <a href="Uffizi">Uffizi</a>, played an important role in introducing Florentine painters to trends from the north, and artists like <a href="Giovanni%20Bellini">Giovanni Bellini</a> came under the influence of northern painters working in Italy.

Memling successfully merged the two styles, exemplified in his "Virgin and Child with Two Angels". By the mid-16th-century, however, Netherlandish art was seen as crude; <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> claimed it was appealing only to "monks and friars". At this point northern art began to fall almost completely out of favour in Italy. By the 17th century, when Bruges had lost its prestige and position as the pre-eminent European trading city (the rivers silted and ports were forced to close), the Italians dominated European art.

Religious images came under close scrutiny as actually or potentially <a href="idolatrous">idolatrous</a> from the start of the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> in the 1520s. <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> accepted some imagery, but few Early Netherlandish paintings met his criteria. <a href="Andreas%20Karlstadt">Andreas Karlstadt</a>, <a href="Huldrych%20Zwingli">Huldrych Zwingli</a> and <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a> were wholly opposed to public religious images, above all in churches, and <a href="Calvinism">Calvinism</a> soon became the dominant force in Netherlandish Protestantism. From 1520, outbursts of reformist <a href="iconoclasm">iconoclasm</a> broke out across much of Northern Europe. These might be official and peaceable, as in England under the <a href="Tudor%20dynasty">Tudors</a> and the <a href="English%20Commonwealth">English Commonwealth</a>, or unofficial and often violent, as in the "<a href="Beeldenstorm">Beeldenstorm</a>" or "Iconoclastic Fury" in 1566 in the Netherlands. On 19 August 1566, this wave of mob destruction reached Ghent, where <a href="Marcus%20van%20Vaernewijck">Marcus van Vaernewijck</a> chronicled the events. He wrote of the "Ghent Altarpiece" being "taken to pieces and lifted, panel by panel, into the tower to preserve it from the rioters". Antwerp saw very thorough destruction in its churches in 1566, followed by more losses in the Spanish <a href="Sack%20of%20Antwerp">Sack of Antwerp</a> in 1576, and a further period of official iconoclasm in 1581, which now included city and guild buildings, when Calvinists controlled the city council.

Many thousands of religious objects and artefacts were destroyed, including paintings, sculptures, altarpieces, stained glass, and crucifixes, and the survival rate of works by the major artists is low – even Jan van Eyck has only some 24 extant works confidently attributed to him. The number grows with later artists, but there are still anomalies; Petrus Christus is considered a major artist, but is given a smaller number of works than van Eyck. In general the later 15th-century works exported to southern Europe have a much higher survival rate.

Many of the period's artworks were commissioned by clergy for their churches, with specifications for a physical format and pictorial content that would complement existing architectural and design schemes. An idea of how such church interiors might have looked can be seen from both van Eyck's "Madonna in the Church" and van der Weyden's "". According to Nash, van der Weyden's panel is an insightful look at the appearance of pre-Reformation churches, and the manner in which images were placed so that they resonated with other paintings or objects. Nash goes on to say that, "any one would necessarily be seen in relation to other images, repeating, enlarging, or diversifying the chosen themes". Because iconoclasts targeted churches and cathedrals, important information about the display of individual works has been lost, and with it, insights about the meaning of these artworks in their own time. Many other works were lost to fires or in wars; the break-up of the Valois Burgundian state made the Low Countries the cockpit of European conflict until 1945. Van der Weyden's "<a href="The%20Justice%20of%20Trajan%20and%20Herkinbald">The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald</a>" polyptych is perhaps the most significant loss; from records it appears to have been comparable in scale and ambition to the "Ghent Altarpiece". It was destroyed by French artillery during the <a href="bombardment%20of%20Brussels">bombardment of Brussels</a> in 1695, and is today known only from a tapestry copy.

There have been significant challenges for art historians in establishing the names of Netherlandish masters and attributing specific works. The historical record is very poor, such that some major artists' biographies are still bare outlines, while attribution is an ongoing and often contentious debate. Even the most widely accepted attributions are typically only as a result of decades of scientific and historical research originating from after the start of the 20th century. Some painters, such as <a href="Adriaen%20Isenbrandt">Adriaen Isenbrandt</a> and <a href="Ambrosius%20Benson">Ambrosius Benson</a> of Bruges, who were mass-producing panels to be sold at fair stalls, have had as many as 500 painting attributed to them.

The avenues for research have been limited by many historical factors. Many archives were destroyed in bombing campaigns in the two world wars, and a great number of works for which records do exist are themselves lost or destroyed. The record-keeping in the region was inconsistent, and often the export of works by major artists was, owing to the pressures of commercial demand, not adequately recorded. The practice of signing and dating works was rare until the 1420s, and while the inventories of collectors may have elaborately described the works, they attached little importance to recording the artist or workshop that produced them. Surviving documentation tends to come from inventories, wills, payment accounts, employment contracts and guild records and regulations.

Because Jan van Eyck's life is well documented in comparison to his contemporary painters, and because he was so clearly the period's innovator, a great number of works were attributed to him after art historians began to research the period. Today Jan is credited with about 26–28 extant works. This reduced number in part follows from the identification of other mid-15th-century painters such as van der Weyden, Christus and Memling, while Hubert, so highly regarded by late-19th-century critics, is now relegated as a secondary figure with no works definitively attributed to him. Many early Netherlandish masters have not been identified, and are today known by "names of convenience", usually of the "Master of ..." format. The practice lacks an established descriptor in English, but the "notname" term is often used, a derivative of a German term. Collecting a group of works under one notname is often contentious; a set of works assigned one notname could have been produced by various artists whose artistic similarities can be explained by shared geography, training, and response to market-demand influences. Some major artists who were known by pseudonyms are now identified, sometimes controversially, as in the case of Campin, who is usually, but not always, associated with the Master of Flémalle.

Many unidentified late-14th- and early-15th-century northern artists were of the first rank, but have suffered academic neglect because they have not been attached to any historical person; as Nash puts it, "much of what cannot be firmly attributed remains less studied". Some art historians believe that this situation has fostered a lack of caution in connecting works with historical persons, and that such connections often rest on tenuous circumstantial evidence. The identities of a number of well-known artists have been founded on the basis of a single signed, documented or otherwise attributed work, from which follow further attributions based on technical evidence and geographical proximity. The so-called <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Legend%20of%20the%20Magdalen">Master of the Legend of the Magdalen</a>, who may have been <a href="Pieter%20van%20Coninxloo">Pieter van Coninxloo</a>, is one of the more notable examples; others include Hugo van der Goes, Campin, Stefan Lochner and Simon Marmion.

The lack of surviving theoretical writing on art and recorded opinion from any of the pre-16th-century major artists presents still more difficulties in attribution. Dürer, in 1512, was the first artist of the era to properly set down in writing his theories of art, followed by <a href="Lucas%20de%20Heere">Lucas de Heere</a> in 1565 and <a href="Karel%20van%20Mander">Karel van Mander</a> in 1604. Nash believes a more probable explanation for the absence of theoretical writing on art outside Italy is that the northern artists did not yet have the language to describe their aesthetic values, or saw no point in explaining in writing what they had achieved in painting. Surviving 15th-century appreciations of contemporary Netherlandish art are exclusively written by Italians, the best known of which include <a href="Ciriaco%20de%27%20Pizzicolli">Cyriacus Ancona</a> in 1449, <a href="Bartolomeo%20Facio">Bartolomeo Facio</a> in 1456, and <a href="Giovanni%20Santi">Giovanni Santi</a> in 1482.

The dominance of Northern <a href="Mannerism">Mannerism</a> in the mid-16th century was built on a subversion of the conventions of Early Netherlandish art, which in turn fell out of public favour. Yet it remained popular in some royal art collections; <a href="Mary%20of%20Hungary%20%28governor%20of%20the%20Netherlands%29">Mary of Hungary</a> and <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II of Spain</a> both sought out Netherlandish painters, sharing a preference for van der Weyden and Bosch. By the early 17th century, no collection of repute was complete without 15th- and 16th-century northern European works; the emphasis however tended to be on the Northern Renaissance as a whole, more towards the German Albrecht Dürer, by far the most collectable northern artist of the era. <a href="Giorgio%20Vasari">Giorgio Vasari</a> in 1550 and Karel van Mander (c. 1604) placed the art works of era at the heart of Northern Renaissance art. Both writers were instrumental in forming later opinion about the region's painters, with emphasis on van Eyck as the innovator.

The Netherlandish painters were largely forgotten in the 18th century. When <a href="The%20Louvre">Musée du Louvre</a> was converted to an art gallery during the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, Gerard David's "Marriage at Cana" – then attributed to van Eyck – was the only piece of Netherlandish art on display there. More large panels were added to the collection after the French <a href="Campaigns%20of%201794%20in%20the%20French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">conquered the Low Countries</a>. These works had a profound effect on German literary critic and philosopher <a href="Karl%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Schlegel">Karl Schlegel</a>, who after a visit in 1803 wrote an analysis of Netherlandish art, sending it to <a href="Ludwig%20Tieck">Ludwig Tieck</a>, who had the piece published in 1805.

In 1821 <a href="Johanna%20Schopenhauer">Johanna Schopenhauer</a> became interested in the work of Jan van Eyck and his followers, having seen early Netherlandish and Flemish paintings in the collection of the brothers <a href="Sulpiz%20Boisser%C3%A9e">Sulpiz</a> and <a href="Melchior%20Boisser%C3%A9e">Melchior Boisserée</a> in Heidelberg. Schopenhauer did primary archival research because there was very little historical record of the masters, apart from official legal documents. She published "Johann van Eyck und seine Nachfolger" in 1822, the same year <a href="Gustav%20Friedrich%20Waagen">Gustav Friedrich Waagen</a> published the first modern scholarly work on early Netherlandish painting, "Ueber Hubert van Eyck und Johann van Eyck"; Waagen's work drew on Schlegel and Schopenhauer's earlier analyses. Waagen went on to become director of the <a href="Gem%C3%A4ldegalerie%2C%20Berlin">Gemäldegalerie</a> in Berlin, amassing a collection of Netherlandish art, including most of the "Ghent" panels, a number of van der Weyden triptychs, and a Bouts altarpiece. Subjecting the works to meticulous analysis and examination in the course of acquisition, based on distinguishing characteristics of individual artists, he established an early scholarly system of classification.

In 1830 the <a href="Belgian%20Revolution">Belgian Revolution</a> split Belgium from the Netherlands of today; as the newly created state sought to establish a cultural identity, Memling's reputation came to equal that of van Eyck in the 19th century. Memling was seen as the older master's match technically, and as possessing a deeper emotional resonance. When in 1848 the collection of Prince Ludwig of <a href="House%20of%20Oettingen-Wallerstein">Oettingen-Wallerstein</a> at Schloss Wallerstein was forced onto the market, his cousin <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a> arranged a viewing at <a href="Kensington%20Palace">Kensington Palace</a>; though a catalogue of works attributed to the School of Cologne, Jan van Eyck and van der Weyden was compiled by Waagen, there were no other buyers so Albert purchased them himself. At a period when London's <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a> sought to increase its prestige, <a href="Charles%20Lock%20Eastlake">Charles Eastlake</a> purchased Rogier van der Weyden's "<a href="The%20Magdalen%20Reading">The Magdalen Reading</a>" panel in 1860 from Edmond Beaucousin's "small but choice" collection of early Netherlandish paintings.

Netherlandish art became popular with museum-goers in the late 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century, van Eyck and Memling were the most highly regarded, with van der Weyden and Christus little more than footnotes. Later many of the works then attributed to Memling were found to be from van der Weyden or his workshop. In 1902, Bruges hosted the first <a href="Exposition%20des%20primitifs%20flamands%20%C3%A0%20Bruges">exhibition of Netherlandish art</a> with 35,000 visitors, an event that was a "turning point in the appreciation of early Netherlandish art". For a number of reasons, the chief of which was the difficulty of securing paintings for the exhibition, only a few of van Eyck's and van der Weyden's panels were displayed, while almost 40 of Memling's pieces were shown. Nevertheless, van Eyck and van der Weyden, to an extent, were then considered the first rank of Netherlandish artists.

The Bruges exhibition renewed interest in the period and initiated scholarship that was to flourish in the 20th century. <a href="Johan%20Huizinga">Johan Huizinga</a> was the first historian to place Netherlandish art squarely in the Burgundian period – outside of nationalistic borders – suggesting in his book "<a href="The%20Waning%20of%20the%20Middle%20Ages">The Waning of the Middle Ages</a>", published in 1919, that the flowering of the school in the early 15th century resulted wholly from the tastes set by the Burgundian court. Another exhibition visitor, Georges Hulin de Loo, published an independent critical catalogue highlighting the large number of mistakes in the official catalogue, which had used attributions and descriptions from the owners. He and Max Friedländer, who visited and wrote a review of the Bruges exhibition, went on to become leading scholars in the field.

The most significant early research of Early Netherlandish art occurred in the 1920s, in German art historian <a href="Max%20Jakob%20Friedl%C3%A4nder">Max Jakob Friedländer</a>'s pioneering "Meisterwerke der Niederländischen Malerei des 15. und 16. Jahrhunderts". Friedländer focused on the biographical details of the painters, establishing attribution, and examining their major works. The undertaking proved extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists. Fellow-German <a href="Erwin%20Panofsky">Erwin Panofsky</a>'s analysis in the 1950s and 1960s followed and in many ways challenged Friedländer's work. Writing in the United States, Panofsky made the work of the German art historians accessible to the English-speaking world for the first time. He effectively legitimized Netherlandish art as a field of study, and raised its status to something similar to the early <a href="Italian%20Renaissance%20painting">Italian renaissance</a>.
Panofsky was one of the first art historians to abandon <a href="Formalism%20%28art%29">formalism</a>. He built on Friedländer's attempts at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography. Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – as a prelude to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.

Otto Pächt and <a href="Friedrich%20Winkler">Friedrich Winkler</a> continued and developed on Panofsky's work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, or at least differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience. The paucity of surviving documentation has made attribution especially difficult, a problem compounded by the workshop system. It was not until the late 1950s, after the research of Friedländer, Panofsky and <a href="Meyer%20Schapiro">Meyer Schapiro</a>, that the attributions generally accepted today were established.
More recent research from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography to develop an understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters. The conservation of the "Ghent Altarpiece" in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, hint at the relationships between the masters of the first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence.

Scholarship since the 1970s has tended to move away from a pure study of iconography, instead emphasizing the paintings' and artists' relation to the social history of their time. According to <a href="Craig%20Harbison">Craig Harbison</a>, "Social history was becoming increasingly important. Panofsky had never really talked about what kind of people these were." Harbison sees the works as objects of devotion with a "prayer book mentality" available to middle-class burghers who had the means and the inclination to commission devotional objects. Most recent scholarship is moving away from the focus on religious iconography; instead, it investigates how a viewer is meant to experience a piece, as with donor paintings that were meant to elicit the feeling of a religious vision. James Marrow thinks the painters wanted to evoke specific responses, which are often hinted at by the figures' emotions in the paintings.

La Coupole

La Coupole (), also known as the Coupole d'Helfaut-Wizernes and originally <a href="codename">codename</a>d Bauvorhaben 21 ("Building Project 21") or Schotterwerk Nordwest ("Northwest Gravel Works"), is a <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> bunker complex in the <a href="Pas-de-Calais">Pas-de-Calais</a> "<a href="Departments%20of%20France">department</a>" of northern France, about from <a href="Saint-Omer">Saint-Omer</a>, and some 14.4 kilometers (8.9 miles) south-southeast from the less developed <a href="Blockhaus%20d%27Eperlecques">Blockhaus d'Eperlecques</a> V-2 launch installation in the same area. It was built by the forces of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> between 1943 and 1944 to serve as a launch base for <a href="V-2%20rocket">V-2 rocket</a>s directed against London and southern England, and is the earliest known precursor to modern <a href="Missile%20launch%20facility">underground missile silo</a>s still in existence.

Constructed in the side of a disused chalk quarry, the most prominent feature of the complex is an immense concrete dome, to which its modern name refers. It was built above a network of tunnels housing storage areas, launch facilities and crew quarters. The facility was designed to store a large stockpile of V-2s, warheads and fuel and was intended to launch V-2s on an industrial scale. Dozens of missiles a day were to be fuelled, prepared and launched in rapid sequence against London and southern England.

Following repeated heavy bombing by Allied forces during <a href="Operation%20Crossbow">Operation Crossbow</a>, the Germans were unable to complete the construction works and the complex never entered service. It was captured by the Allies in September 1944, partially demolished on the orders of <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> to prevent its reuse as a military base, and then abandoned. It remained derelict until the mid-1990s. In 1997 it opened to the public for the first time, as a museum. Exhibits in the tunnels and under the dome tell the story of the <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20France%20during%20World%20War%20II">German occupation of France during World War II</a>, the <a href="V-weapons">V-weapons</a> and the history of <a href="space%20exploration">space exploration</a>.

The V-2 rocket was one of several innovative long-range weapons developed by the Germans after the failure of the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> to strike a decisive blow against Britain. It was a revolutionary weapon – the world's first operational <a href="SRBM">SRBM</a> – that had been developed in a secret programme begun in 1936. The German leadership hoped that a barrage of rockets unleashed against London would force Britain out of the war. Although <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was at first ambivalent, he eventually became an enthusiastic supporter of the V-2 programme as Allied air forces carried out increasingly devastating attacks on German cities.

The 12.5-ton missile, standing high on its launch pad, was fuelled primarily by <a href="liquid%20oxygen">liquid oxygen</a> (LOX) and <a href="methyl%20alcohol">methyl alcohol</a>. Deploying the V-2 on a large scale required far more LOX than was available from existing production sites in Germany and the occupied countries. New sources of LOX were required, situated close to the missile launching sites to reduce as far as possible the loss of propellant through evaporation. The missile's operational range of meant that the launch sites had to be fairly close to the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> or southern <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> coasts, in northern France, Belgium or the western Netherlands.

Because of the complexity of the missile and the need for extensive testing prior to launch, the V-2's designers at the <a href="Peenem%C3%BCnde%20Army%20Research%20Center">Peenemünde Army Research Center</a> favoured using heavily defended fixed sites where the missiles could be stored, armed, and fuelled from an on-site LOX production plant before launching. But the <a href="German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German Army</a> and the V-2 project's head, Major-General <a href="Walter%20Dornberger">Walter Dornberger</a>, were concerned that the sites would be vulnerable to aerial attack by the Allies. The Army's preferred option was to use "<a href="Meillerwagen">Meillerwagen</a>s", mobile firing batteries, which presented a much smaller target for the Allied air forces.

The Army was nonetheless overruled by Hitler, who had a long-standing preference for huge, grandiose constructions. He preferred fixed installations along the lines of the virtually impregnable <a href="submarine%20pen">U-boat pens</a> that had been built to protect Germany's <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a> fleet. In March 1943, he ordered the construction of a massive bunker (now known as the <a href="Blockhaus%20d%27%C3%89perlecques">Blockhaus d'Éperlecques</a>) in the <a href="Forest%20of%20%C3%89perlecques">Forest of Éperlecques</a> near <a href="Watten%2C%20Nord">Watten</a>, north of Saint-Omer. The bunker was soon spotted by Allied reconnaissance, and on 27 August 1943, a raid by 187 <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress</a> bombers wrecked the construction site before it could be completed. A surviving portion was reused by the Germans as a LOX production facility.

The successful attack against the Watten bunker forced the German Army to find an alternative location for a launch site nearby. They had already taken possession of an old quarry between the villages of Helfaut and <a href="Wizernes">Wizernes</a>, south-west of Saint-Omer and some south of the Watten bunker, near the <a href="Aa%20River%20%28France%29">Aa river</a> alongside the <a href="Boulogne">Boulogne</a>–Saint-Omer railway line, about from Wizernes station. The quarry had been designated for use as a missile storage depot where V-2s would be housed in tunnels bored into the chalk hillside before being transported for launching. The Germans undertook major work in August 1943 to lay extensive railway sidings to connect the quarry to the main line.

On 30 September 1943, Hitler met with <a href="Albert%20Speer">Albert Speer</a>, the Minister of Armaments and War Production, and <a href="Franz%20Xaver%20Dorsch">Franz Xaver Dorsch</a>, the chief engineer of the <a href="Todt%20Organisation">Todt Organisation</a>, to discuss plans for a replacement for the out-of-commission Watten facility. Dorsch proposed to transform the Wizernes depot into a vast bomb-proof underground complex that would require a million tons of concrete to build. It would be constructed within a network of tunnels to be dug inside the hillside at the edge of the quarry. A concrete dome, thick, in diameter and weighing 55,000 tons, would be built over the top of the central part of the facility to protect it from Allied bombing. Beneath it, about of tunnels were to be dug into the chalk hillside to accommodate workshops, storerooms, fuel supplies, a LOX manufacturing plant, generators, barracks and a hospital.

A standard gauge railway tunnel, codenamed "Ida", was to be built on a curving path that would connect it with both the east- and west-bound main line railway, allowing trains to run straight through the complex without needing to reverse or be turned around. This would serve as the main unloading station, where missiles and supplies would be offloaded onto trolleys that would transport them into the connecting galleries "Mathilde" and "Hugo". "Hugo" connected in turn with "Sophie", a dead-end railway tunnel branching from the main line into "Ida". Each of the main tunnels had a number of unnamed side tunnels of the same dimensions as the main tunnels and up to long. The central feature of the complex was a huge octagonal rocket-preparation chamber directly under the dome. It was never completed but would have been in diameter and up to high. A number of intermediate floors, possibly as many as ten, would have been built up the sides of the chamber.

The western side of the chamber opened onto two tall passageways, opening onto two tracks to the outdoor launchpads, with the tracked passages and launchpads named "Gustav" (the southerly-located pad) and "Gretchen" (the northerly-located pad), both on the western side of the domed complex. Each was to have been protected by bomb-proof doors made of steel and concrete. The passageways were to be wide and at least high and were angled in a Y-shape, both exiting westwards into the quarry. The outdoor launchpads for the V-2 rockets would have been at the end of each passageway. The two passageways were angled at 64° 50' and 99° 50' west of north respectively – not aligned with any probable target but merely permitting the rockets to be transported to either one or the other, of their pair of sufficiently-separated launch pads.

The facility was designed, as was its predecessor at Watten, to receive, process and launch V-2 rockets at a high rate. Trains carrying V-2s would enter the heart of the complex through the "Ida" rail tunnel, where they would be unloaded. A large number of V-2s could be stored in the side tunnels; LOX would also be produced on-site ready for use. When the time came, the rockets would be moved into the octagonal preparation chamber where they would be lifted to a vertical position for fuelling and arming. From there they would be transported on motorised launch carriages, still in a vertical position, through the "Gustav" and "Gretchen" passageways. The launch pads were located at the end of the track on the floor of the quarry, from where the missiles would be fired.

The priority target for the V-2s was away: London, which Hitler wanted to see pulverised by the end of 1943. The Allies were alarmed when an analyst found that part of the complex was aligned within half a degree of the <a href="Great%20Circle">Great Circle</a> bearing on <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>, and its equipment was large enough to accommodate a rocket twice the size of the V-2: the "America Rocket", the proposed <a href="Aggregate%20%28rocket%20family%29%23A9.2FA10">A10</a> <a href="intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile">intercontinental ballistic missile</a>.

Although physically separate, another facility built in nearby <a href="Roquetoire">Roquetoire</a> was an integral part of the Wizernes complex. "Umspannwerk C" was built to house a <a href="Leitstrahl">Leitstrahl</a> radio command guidance system which could be used to send course corrections to missiles launched from Wizernes to fine-tune their trajectory during the launch phase.

The Allies first noticed construction activity at Wizernes in mid-August 1943 when the Germans began building railway track and the offloading stores into the old quarry. After Hitler authorised the decision to turn the depot into a missile launch site, construction was stepped up. Work on the dome began in November 1943 and tunnelling in the cliff face below began in December. At the start of January, Allied reconnaissance aircraft observed an elaborate system of camouflage on the hill top, installed to conceal the dome. The building works were greatly hindered by the constant air-raid warnings, which stopped work 229 times in May 1944 alone. In response to Hitler's desire to see the site completed the workforce was expanded substantially from 1,100 in April 1944 to nearly 1,400 by June. About 60% of the workers were Germans; skilled workers, such as miners from <a href="Westphalia">Westphalia</a>, were recruited to excavate the tunnels and build the dome. The remainder were principally Frenchmen conscripted by the <a href="Service%20du%20travail%20obligatoire">Service du travail obligatoire</a> (STO), plus Soviet prisoners of war. The project was overseen by several large German construction companies, with <a href="Philipp%20Holzmann">Philipp Holzman A.G.</a> of <a href="Frankfurt%20am%20Main">Frankfurt am Main</a> and the Grossdeutsche Schachtbau and Tiefbohr GmbH serving as the chief contractors.

One of the most difficult challenges faced by the Germans was constructing the great dome while under regular air attack. The dome's designer, Todt Organisation engineer Werner Flos, devised a plan under which the dome would be built first, flat upon the ground, and the soil underneath it would be excavated so that the construction works below would be protected against aerial attacks. A circular trench was excavated on the top of the hill above the quarry to an outside diameter of . The dome was built within this trench and the galleries and octagonal preparation chamber were excavated below.

As an additional bomb-proofing method, the dome was surrounded by a bomb-proof "skirt" or "Zerschellerplatte" of steel-reinforced concrete, wide and thick. This was supported by a series of buttresses, which were not tied into the dome itself, above the entrances to the "Gustav" and "Gretchen" tunnels. Another concrete structure was tied into the skirt to the north-west of the dome, which was perhaps intended for use as an observation and control tower. A separate underground building was constructed on the western side of the quarry to serve as a hospital and as offices for the engineers. A <a href="Decauville">Decauville</a> narrow-gauge railway was installed on the quarry floor to transport supplies from the main line to the construction site.

A cube-shaped concrete building was constructed on the top of the hill, next to the dome. This was intended to be used as the bomb-proof outlet for a ventilation and air conditioning shaft. It was an essential component of a facility where dangerous and explosive gases were expected to be used in large quantities on a daily basis. It was never finished, and the Allies found when they captured the site that the ventilation shaft had not been fully excavated. The building survived the bombing intact and is still prominently visible today.

Unlike its sister site at Watten, there was no on-site power plant. Electricity at Wizernes was provided by a connection to the main electric grid, with power consumption estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000 <a href="Volt-ampere">kVA</a>.

The Allies became aware of the Wizernes site in August 1943 when the Germans began laying extensive new rail sidings which were spotted by RAF reconnaissance flights. Late 1943, a Belgian, Jacques de Duve, supported by German opponents, informed MI5 about the existence of a rocket production site in Saint-Omer. MI5 did not believe Jacques de Duve, who was interned for the rest of the war in Latchmere House. In November 1943, the <a href="RAF%20Medmenham">Allied Central Interpretation Unit</a> reported that the Germans had begun constructing the concrete dome and were undertaking tunnelling works in the east face of the quarry. However, it was not until the following March that the Allies added the site to the list of targets for <a href="Operation%20Crossbow">Operation Crossbow</a>, the ongoing bombing campaign against V-weapon sites that had already wrecked the Watten bunker and numerous <a href="V-1%20flying%20bomb">V-1</a> launching sites. Over the next few months, the USAAF and RAF carried out 16 air raids involving 811 bombers that dropped some 4,260 tons of bombs. The bombing caused destruction across a wide area, killing 55 residents of the nearby village of Helfault.

Conventional bombing raids only achieved a single bomb hit on the dome itself, causing negligible damage. However, in June and July 1944 the RAF began attacking the site with , <a href="Bunker%20buster%23World%20War%20II">ground-penetrating</a> <a href="Tallboy%20%28bomb%29">Tallboy bombs</a>. The external construction works were completely wrecked by the bombing and one Tallboy landed just beside the dome, blowing out the entire quarry cliff face and burying the entrances to the "Gustav" and "Gretchen" tunnels. The entrance to "Sophie" was also buried, leaving "Ida" as the only entrance to the facility. The dome was unscathed but the buttresses supporting the protective "Zerschellerplatte" were dislodged and slid partway down into the quarry. Serious damage was also caused to the tunnels beneath the dome. The damage made it impossible to continue work on the site. Dornberger complained: "Persistent air attack with heavy and super-heavy bombs so battered the rock all around that in the spring of 1944 landslides made further work impossible." His staff reported on 28 July 1944 that, although the dome had not been hit by the Tallboys, "the whole area around has been so churned up that it is unapproachable, and the bunker is jeopardised from underneath."

Although three launch battalions were formed by the Germans in late 1943, they never got the chance to deploy to the V-weapons launch sites at Watten and Wizernes. On 3 July 1944, the <a href="Oberkommando%20der%20Wehrmacht">Oberkommando West</a> authorised the cessation of construction at the heavily damaged sites. On 18 July 1944, Hitler abandoned plans for launching V-2s from bunkers and authorized the downgrading of the Wizernes bunker to make it a LOX production facility. However, these plans were overtaken by the Allied liberation of Northern France following the <a href="Normandy%20landings">Normandy landings</a>. The site was finally abandoned a few days before the Allies reached it at the start of September during the rapid liberation of the area by British, American, Canadian and Polish troops. British engineers inspected it on 5 September.

Shortly after the Wizernes site had been captured in September 1944, <a href="Duncan%20Sandys">Duncan Sandys</a>, the head of the British "Crossbow Committee" investigating the V-weapons programme, ordered the constitution of a Technical Inter-Services Mission under Colonel <a href="Terence%20Sanders">T.R.B. Sanders</a>. It was given the task of investigating the sites at <a href="Fortress%20of%20Mimoyecques">Mimoyecques</a>, <a href="Siracourt%20V-1%20bunker">Siracourt</a>, Watten, and Wizernes, collectively known to the Allies as the "Heavy Crossbow" sites. Sanders' report was submitted to the War Cabinet on 19 March 1945.

The purpose of the Wizernes site had been unclear prior to its capture but Sanders was able to deduce its connection with the V-2 from the dimensions of the complex and some intelligence information that his team had been able to retrieve. Sanders' report concluded that it was "an assembly site for long projectiles most conveniently handled and prepared in a vertical position". He conjectured the approximate length of the projectiles from the height of the "Gustav" and "Gretchen" tunnels, though he noted that there was some doubt about the height of the doors at the tunnel entrances. Segments of the doors had been recovered from a storage dump near Watten railway station, but were incomplete. Judging from the size of the tunnel entrance, the maximum size of the projectile could have been between and in length and in breadth. (This was substantially larger than the V-2, which measured long and wide.) Two witnesses interviewed by the Sanders team reported "an intention of firing a projectile 18 metres long". Sanders noted that "the dimensions of the site make it suitable for the A.4 (V-2) rocket, but the possibility of a new rocket up to half as long again as the A.4 and twice the weight cannot be ruled out." He concluded that much of the site was becoming unsafe due to the progressive collapse of timbering and recommended that the tunnels and workings under the dome should be destroyed to prevent subsequent accidents or misuse.

The site reverted to private ownership after the war. As the quarry had long since been worked out, it was abandoned. The tunnels were not destroyed but were sealed off, though at some point they were reopened by local people and could be entered; the octagon remained sealed off with a ceiling-to-floor barricade. The quarry itself remained in almost the same condition as it had been in 1944, with sections of railway track still in place on the quarry floor. The hospital section remained relatively intact and was used by the local gendarmes as a shooting range.

In 1986, the Espace Naturel Régional in <a href="Lille">Lille</a> earmarked 10 million <a href="French%20franc">francs</a> to develop the site as a tourist attraction for the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region with the intention of establishing a World War II museum there. The plan was publicised in a special open weekend on 20–21 June 1987, attended by over 20,000 people, in which the dome's designer Werner Flos met Professor <a href="Reginald%20Victor%20Jones">Reginald Victor Jones</a>, a surviving member of the "Crossbow Committee", at Wizernes. The "Ida" tunnel and side chambers were opened to the public and used for an audio-visual exhibition of the site's history.

Local historian Yves le Maner was charged with the task of developing the project while a feasibility study was conducted into the possibility of completing some of the original excavation work to make the site safe for public access. The plans were approved in 1993 and the site was purchased by the Commune de Helfaut. The following year, the Conseil Général du Pas-de-Calais acquired the site. The 69-million-franc project (£7.5 million at 1997 prices) was largely underwritten by the Conseil Général, which provided 35 million francs, with another 17 million coming from the regional council. The European Union provided a further 12 million, the French State provided 3 million and the Saint-Omer municipal administration funded the remaining 1 million francs; a number of private shareholders were also involved. The Societé d'Equipement du Pas-de-Calais was contracted to carry out the development work, which involved excavating a further two metres (six feet) beneath the dome, clearing out and completing the unfinished concreting of some of the tunnels, building an exhibition centre and car park in the quarry floor and installing a lift to carry visitors up from the octagon to the dome.

The museum opened in May 1997. Visitors enter and leave through the "Ida" railway tunnel, though the rails have been removed and the floor levelled. Short branch tunnels lead off on either side; originally used for storage, they now display wartime objects. Headphone stands along the way present multi-lingual accounts of the construction and purpose of the facility. The tour continues along the "Mathilde" tunnel to reach a lift that has been installed to bring visitors up to the space beneath the dome, where the main exhibition area is located. Focusing on the story of the V-weapons, life in occupied France, and the conquest of space after the war, the tour presents audio-visual displays in English, French, Dutch and German. The museum houses a large number of original artifacts including a V-1 provided by London's <a href="Science%20Museum%20%28London%29">Science Museum</a> and a V-2 provided by the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>, and incorporates a memorial to the 8,000 people who were shot in or deported from the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region during the war; computer terminals track the paths of several hundred of the deportees. In 2011, the museum welcomed 120,000 visitors. In July 2012, the museum opened a planetarium as part of Cerendac, a newly established "Centre de ressources numériques pour le développement de l'accès à la connaissance" (Resource Centre for the development of digital access to knowledge). The €6 million centre is funded by the Pas-de-Calais "department", the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region, the French state, the European Union and the <a href="Communes%20of%20France%23Intercommunality">intercommunality</a> of Saint-Omer. Since 2010, the museum has also managed the <a href="V-3%20cannon">V-3</a> site of the <a href="Fortress%20of%20Mimoyecques">Fortress of Mimoyecques</a>.

Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.

Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co., 248 N.Y. 339, 162 <a href="North%20Eastern%20Reporter">N.E.</a> 99 (1928), is a leading case in <a href="United%20States%20tort%20law">American tort law</a> on the question of <a href="legal%20liability">liability</a> to an unforeseeable <a href="plaintiff">plaintiff</a>. The case was heard by the <a href="New%20York%20Court%20of%20Appeals">New York Court of Appeals</a>, the highest state court in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>; its opinion was written by Chief Judge <a href="Benjamin%20Cardozo">Benjamin Cardozo</a>, a leading figure in the development of American <a href="common%20law">common law</a> and later a <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a> justice.

The plaintiff, Helen Palsgraf, was waiting at a <a href="Long%20Island%20Rail%20Road">Long Island Rail Road</a> station in August 1924 while taking her daughters to the beach. Two men attempted to board the train before hers; one (aided by railroad employees) dropped a package that exploded, causing a large coin-operated scale on the platform to hit her. After the incident, she began to <a href="stuttering">stammer</a>, and subsequently sued the railroad, arguing that its employees had been <a href="negligence">negligent</a> while assisting the man, and that she had been harmed by the neglect. In May 1927 she obtained a jury verdict of $6,000, which the railroad appealed. Palsgraf gained a 3–2 decision in the <a href="New%20York%20Supreme%20Court%2C%20Appellate%20Division">Appellate Division</a>, and the railroad appealed again. Cardozo wrote for a 4–3 majority of the Court of Appeals, ruling that there was no negligence because the employees, in helping the man board, did not have a <a href="duty%20of%20care">duty of care</a> to Palsgraf as injury to her was not a foreseeable harm from aiding a man with a package. The original jury verdict was overturned, and the railroad won the case.

A number of factors, including the bizarre facts and Cardozo's outstanding reputation, made the case prominent in the legal profession, and it remains so, taught to most if not all American <a href="Law%20school%20in%20the%20United%20States">law students</a> in <a href="tort">tort</a>s class. Cardozo's conception, that tort liability can only occur when a defendant breaches a duty of care the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely accepted in <a href="Law%20of%20the%20United%20States">American law</a>. In dealing with <a href="proximate%20cause">proximate cause</a>, many states have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in "Palsgraf", Judge <a href="William%20Shankland%20Andrews">William S. Andrews</a>.

At the time of the 1928 <a href="New%20York%20Court%20of%20Appeals">New York Court of Appeals</a> decision in "Palsgraf", that state's case law followed a classical formation for negligence: the plaintiff had to show that the <a href="Long%20Island%20Railroad">Long Island Railroad</a> ("LIRR" or "the railroad") had a <a href="duty%20of%20care">duty of care</a>, and that she was injured through a breach of that duty. It was not required that she show that the duty owed was to her. Under New York precedent, the usual duty of utmost care that the railroad as a <a href="common%20carrier">common carrier</a> owed its customers did not apply to <a href="railway%20platform">platforms</a> and other parts of the station.

Sunday, August 24, 1924, was a warm summer day in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, and Helen Palsgraf, a 40-year-old janitor and housekeeper, was taking her two daughters, Elizabeth and Lillian, aged 15 and 12, to <a href="Rockaway%20Beach%2C%20New%20York">Rockaway Beach</a>. Having paid the necessary fare, they were on the platform at the <a href="East%20New%20York%20%28LIRR%20station%29">East New York</a> station of the LIRR on <a href="Atlantic%20Avenue%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Atlantic Avenue</a> in Brooklyn, when a train, not theirs, pulled in. As it began to move again, two men raced for the train, and one made it without incident, as the doors had not closed. The other, a man carrying a package, leapt aboard, with the help of a platform guard pushing him from behind as a member of the train's crew pulled him into the car. But in the process, the man lost the package, which dropped and exploded, for it apparently contained <a href="fireworks">fireworks</a>. Either the force of the explosion or the panicking of those on the platform caused a tall, coin-operated scale to topple onto Helen Palsgraf. No one was hurt enough to spend the night in the hospital, though several people, Palsgraf among them, were listed as injured.

Contemporary accounts and witnesses at trial described the man as Italian in appearance, and there was speculation that the package was being taken for use at an Italian-American celebration of some sort; no great effort was made to identify the owner. Palsgraf's injury was listed in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" as shock; she also suffered bruising. The distance between Helen Palsgraf and the explosion was never made clear in the trial transcript, or in the opinions of the judges who ruled on the case, but the distance from the explosion to the scale was described in the "Times" as "more than ten feet away" (3 metres). Several days after the incident, she developed a bad stammer, and her doctor testified at trial that it was due to the trauma of the events at East New York station. She had not recovered from the stammer when the case came to court.

Palsgraf brought suit against the railroad in the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20New%20York">Supreme Court of New York</a>, <a href="Brooklyn">Kings County</a>, a trial-level court, in Brooklyn on October 2, 1924. The summons was served the following month, and the defendant filed its answer on December 3. The case was heard on May 24 and 25, 1927, with Justice Burt Jay Humphrey presiding. Humphrey had served for over twenty years on the <a href="New%20York%20County%20Court">county court</a> in <a href="Queens">Queens</a> before unexpectedly being nominated for election to the Supreme Court in 1925; he was noted for his courteous and friendly manner. Manhattan lawyers tried the Brooklyn case: Matthew W. Wood, who worked from 233 Broadway (the <a href="Woolworth%20Building">Woolworth Building</a>) represented Palsgraf, while Joseph F. Keany, whose office was at <a href="Pennsylvania%20Station%20%281910%E2%80%931963%29">Pennsylvania Station</a>, was for the railroad, along with William McNamara. Wood was an experienced solo practitioner with two degrees from <a href="Ivy%20League">Ivy League</a> schools; Keany had headed the LIRR's legal department for twenty years—McNamara, who tried the case, was one of the department's junior lawyers, who had advanced from clerk to counsel after graduation from law school. At trial, Palsgraf testified that she had been hit in the side by the scale, and had been treated at the scene, and then took a taxicab home. She testified to trembling then for several days, and then the stammering started. Her health forced her to give up her work in mid-1926. Wood called Herbert Gerhardt, an engraver, who had seen the man with the package hurry towards the train, and whose wife had been hit in the stomach in the man's rush. He testified that the scale had been "blown right to pieces".

On the second day of the trial, Wood called Dr. Karl A. Parshall, Palsgraf's physician. He testified that he had treated Palsgraf occasionally for minor ailments before the incident at East New York, but on the day after found her shaken and bruised. He gave it as his opinion that Palsgraf's ills were caused by the accident. Grace Gerhardt, Herbert's wife, was the next witness. She testified to being hit by one of "the two young Italian fellows" who were racing to make the train, and how one made it unaided and the other only with the help of two LIRR employees. She had nothing to say about the scale or Palsgraf, having seen neither. Elizabeth and Lillian Palsgraf, the elder and younger daughter of the plaintiff, were next to testify and spoke of what they had seen. Wood indicated his only remaining witness was a neurologist, an <a href="expert%20witness">expert witness</a>, and McNamara for the LIRR moved to dismiss the case on the ground that Palsgraf had failed to present evidence of negligence, but Justice Humphrey denied it. The neurologist, <a href="Graeme%20M.%20Hammond">Graeme M. Hammond</a> of Manhattan, had examined Palsgraf two days before, observing her stammering, speaking only with difficulty. She told him of depression and headaches. He diagnosed her with traumatic hysteria, for which the explosion was a plausible cause, and said the hysteria was likely to continue as long as the litigation did, for only once it was resolved were the worries connected with it likely to vanish.

Wood rested his case on behalf of the plaintiff; McNamara offered no evidence but again moved to dismiss, which Humphrey denied. The judge told the all-male jury that if the LIRR employees "omitted to do the things which prudent and careful trainmen do for the safety of those who are boarding their trains, as well as the safety of those who are standing upon the platform waiting for other trains, and that the failure resulted in the plaintiff's injury, then the defendant would be liable." The jury was out for two hours and 35 minutes, including the lunch hour, and they awarded Palsgraf $6,000 ($ today). Pursuant to statute, she also recovered costs of $142, an amount added to the verdict. A motion for a new trial was denied on May 27, 1927 by Justice Humphrey, who did not issue a written opinion, and a judgment was entered on the verdict on May 31, from which the LIRR appealed on June 14. Once Palsgraf had gotten her jury verdict, the Gerhardts also sued the railroad, with Wood as their counsel.

William H. Manz, in his article on the facts in "Palsgraf", suggested that neither side spent much time preparing for trial. Wood did not contact his fact witnesses, the Gerhardts, until shortly before the trial, and Palsgraf was examined by Dr. Hammond the day before the trial started. McNamara, one of the most junior members of the LIRR's legal team, called no witnesses, and Manz suggested the entire defense strategy was to get the judge to dismiss the case. In his later book, Judge <a href="Richard%20Posner">Richard Posner</a> indicated that the much-sued LIRR did not present a better case than the first-time plaintiff: "it put on a bargain-basement defense".

The LIRR's appeal took the case to the <a href="New%20York%20Supreme%20Court%2C%20Appellate%20Division">Appellate Division</a> of the New York Supreme Court, for the Second Department, the state's intermediate appeals court. In its briefs before the Appellate Division, the LIRR argued that the verdict had been contrary to the law and the evidence. It stressed that it had no foreknowledge that the package was dangerous, and that no law required it to search the contents of passenger luggage. The brief stated that given this, there was no negligence in helping a man make a train, and even if there was, that negligence was not the <a href="proximate%20cause">proximate cause</a> of Palsgraf's injuries. Wood, for Palsgraf, argued that the jury verdict finding negligence was supported by undisputed facts, and should not be questioned by the appellate courts. The plaintiff's brief also suggested that the failure of the railroad to call as witnesses the employees who had aided the man should decide any inferences of negligence against it. Wood deemed the trainmen guilty of a "dereliction of duty", misconduct that was the proximate cause of Palsgraf's injuries.

The lawyers argued the case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, 3–2. <a href="Albert%20H.%20F.%20Seeger">Albert H. F. Seeger</a> wrote the majority opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices <a href="William%20F.%20Hagarty">William F. Hagarty</a> and <a href="William%20B.%20Carswell">William B. Carswell</a>. Seeger had been born in <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor <a href="Al%20Smith">Al Smith</a> in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of "Palsgraf", he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by the jury was supported by the evidence, and speculated that the jury might have found that helping a passenger board a moving train was a negligent act. He wrote that while the set of facts might be novel, the case was no different in principle from well-known court decisions on causation, such as the <a href="Squib%20case">Squib case</a>, in which an explosive (a <a href="squib%20%28explosive%29">squib</a>) was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people not wanting to be hurt until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; his suit against the man who had set the squib in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on the high degree of <a href="duty%20of%20care">duty of care</a> that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.

Presiding Justice <a href="Edward%20Lazansky">Edward Lazansky</a> (joined by Justice <a href="J.%20Addison%20Young">J. Addison Young</a>) wrote a dissent. Lazansky, the son of Czech immigrants, had been elected <a href="New%20York%20Secretary%20of%20State">New York Secretary of State</a> as a Democrat in 1910. Elected to the Supreme Court in 1917, he had been designated presiding justice of the Second Department by Governor Smith earlier in 1927. Lazansky did not question the jury finding of negligence, but felt that the employees' conduct was not the proximate cause of Palsgraf's injuries, since the man's conduct in bringing a package that might explode to a crowded passenger station was an independent act of negligence, rendering the neglect by the railroad too remote in causation for there to be liability.

The LIRR was entitled by law to take the case to the New York Court of Appeals (the state's highest court) as there had been a dissent in the Appellate Division, and it did. The railroad argued again that Palsgraf had failed to establish that she had come to harm through the railroad's negligence: that there was no negligence, and even if there was, that neglect had not harmed Palsgraf, since such injury was not "a natural and probable consequence of assisting a man to board a train". Its brief alleged that the trainmen could not have stopped the man from boarding, and once he had flung himself onto the train, had little choice but to help him, "faced with such an emergency they cannot be charged with negligence because they elected to assist the man rather than stand idly by and leave him to his fate." Wood, for his part, argued that negligence had been found by the jury, and by both majority and dissenting justices in the Appellate Division. He wrote that there were many facts from which the jury could have found negligence, including the fact that the train had not shut its doors as it departed (though whether this was to allow latecomers to board or because it was a summer day is uncertain). The case was argued before the Court of Appeals in <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany</a> on February 24, 1928.

The Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, <a href="Benjamin%20N.%20Cardozo">Benjamin N. Cardozo</a>, was a judge who was greatly respected; he later became a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. After a standout legal career, Cardozo had been elected to the trial-level Supreme Court in 1913, but was quickly designated by the governor for service on the Court of Appeals. He was in 1917 appointed a judge of that court, and in 1926 was elected chief judge by the voters. In "Palsgraf", Cardozo wrote for a 4–3 majority of the Court of Appeals, reversing the appellate judgment and directing that the case be decided for the defendant, the LIRR. Cardozo was joined by Judges <a href="Cuthbert%20W.%20Pound">Cuthbert W. Pound</a>, <a href="Irving%20Lehman">Irving Lehman</a> and <a href="Henry%20T.%20Kellogg">Henry Kellogg</a>.

Despite being the longest statement of the facts in any of the four appellate opinions generated by the case, Cardozo's was described by Posner as "elliptical and slanted". It has also been deemed "highly abstract". According to Professor Walter O. Weyrauch in his 1978 journal article, "Cardozo's famous opinion reduced the complicated facts of the case to a bare minimum. Mrs. Palsgraf was transformed into a 'plaintiff' without age, family status, or occupation. The opinion omitted the nature of her injury, the amount of damages that she sought, and the size of the jury award." For example, Cardozo describes Palsgraf (whom he does not name, nor mention her daughters) as standing on the LIRR's platform, rather than waiting for a train, thus downplaying her status as a customer entitled to a high degree of care by the railroad. The explosive package is described as small, though the witnesses had described it as large. The scales are described as being "at the other end of the platform, many feet away" from the explosion, but the record does not support this statement. This characterization may have been based on testimony by Lillian Palsgraf, who had gone to buy a paper from a newsstand "at the other end of the platform", but who was yet close enough to see the package fall. Cardozo's characterization of distance would be challenged by the plaintiff in her motion for reargument, which would be denied with the rejoinder that however close she was to the explosion, she was not so close as to bring her within the zone of foreseeable risk.
After the fact pattern, Cardozo began his discussion of the law with "the conduct of the defendant's guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a wrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away. Relative to her it was not negligence at all." Cardozo quoted "Pollock on Torts" and cited several cases for the proposition that "proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do." Only if there is a duty to the injured plaintiff, the breach of which causes injury, can there be liability. He defended his decision, "a different conclusion will involve us, and swiftly too, in a maze of contradictions." Cardozo posed hypothetical situations: if a railway guard stumbles over a bundle of newspapers, and there are explosives within, will there be liability to an injured passenger at the other end of the platform? Will the result be different if the object containing the explosives is a valise instead? If there was negligence that day, Cardozo argued, it was only negligence that resulted in the fall and destruction of the package, and there was no wrong done by the railroad to Palsgraf for personal injury, "the diversity of incidents emphasizes the futility of the effort to build the plaintiff's right upon the basis of a wrong to some one else." The chief judge instructed, "The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed". Cardozo did not absolve the defendant who knowingly unleashes a destructive force, such as by shooting a gun, just because the bullet takes an unexpected path. This is not such a case, Cardozo held: even if the railway guard had thrown down the package intentionally, without knowing the contents he could not knowingly risk harm to Palsgraf, and would not be liable. Negligence cannot impose liability where an intentional act would not.

Negligence, Cardozo emphasized, derives from human relations, not in the abstract. Negligence that does no one harm is not a tort. It is not enough, he found, to prove negligence by the defendant and damage to the plaintiff; there must be a breach of duty owed to the plaintiff by the defendant. He traced the history of the law of negligence, a concept not known in medieval times, and noted that it evolved as an offshoot of the law of <a href="trespass">trespass</a>, and one could not sue for trespass to another. Had the railroad been negligent towards Palsgraf, it might have been liable, but "the consequences to be followed must first be rooted in a wrong", and there was no legal wrong done by the railroad to Palsgraf. Thus, the lower courts were incorrect, and must be reversed, and the case dismissed, with Palsgraf to bear the costs of suit.

<a href="William%20Shankland%20Andrews">William S. Andrews</a> of Syracuse was a 69-year-old judge, noted for his scholarship, who had been on the Court of Appeals since 1917. The son of <a href="Charles%20Andrews%20%28judge%29">Charles Andrews</a>, a former Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, William Andrews is best remembered today because he wrote an opinion in "Palsgraf". In that dissent, he was joined by Judges <a href="Frederick%20E.%20Crane">Frederick E. Crane</a> and <a href="John%20F.%20O%27Brien">John F. O'Brien</a>. Andrews began with a brief recitation of facts: that a railroad employee had negligently dislodged the package, the contents of which the trainman was unaware, and the subsequent explosion broke the scale and injured the plaintiff, "an intending passenger". Andrews noted the fundamental difference among the judges concerning the law of negligence: whether there must be a duty to the plaintiff, the breach of which injured her, and whether, when there is an act that is a threat to the safety of others, the doer of it should be "liable for all its proximate consequences, even where they result in injury to one who would generally be thought to be outside the radius of danger". Andrews believed that if there was a negligent act, the proximate cause of injury to the plaintiff, that should establish liability.

Andrews found Cardozo's reasoning too narrow, and felt that the focus should be on the unreasonable act: driving down <a href="Broadway%20%28Manhattan%29">Broadway</a> at high speed is negligent whether or not an accident occurs. Such an act is wrong to the public at large, not only to those who might be injured. "Due care is a duty imposed on each one of us to protect society from unnecessary danger, not to protect A, B or C alone ... In an empty world, negligence would not exist. It does involve a relationship between man and his fellows. But not merely a relationship between man and those whom he might reasonably expect his act would injure. Rather, a relationship between him and those whom he does in fact injure. If his act has a tendency to harm some one, it harms him a mile away as surely as it does those on the scene."

Andrews pointed out that the law allows plaintiffs to recover from defendants who had no duty towards them: orphans may recover for their negligently-killed parents; a bereaved person may recover for negligence in the death of a spouse. An insurance company may sue in <a href="subrogation">subrogation</a> and recover the sum paid out from the person who started the fire. "Behind the cloud of words is the fact they hide, that the act, wrongful as to the insured, has also harmed the company."

An event may have many causes, Andrews noted, and only some may be deemed proximate. Liability for negligence may only be found where that proximate cause exists, a term that the judge admitted was inexact. He suggested the analogy of a river, made up of water from many sources, and by the time it wound to sea, fully intermixed. But for a time, after water from a muddy swamp or a clayey bed joins, its origin may be traced. Beyond a certain point, it cannot be traced, and such is proximate cause, "because of convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice, the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point. This is not logic. It is practical politics."

That point, beyond which there is no proximate cause, is drawn differently by different judges, and by different courts, Andrews explained. He listed factors that courts might consider, such as remoteness in time or space, and discussed some hypotheticals, such as a chauffeur who causes an accident, the noise of which startles a nursemaid into dropping a child, then returned to the case being decided,

Given that, Andrews concluded, the jury verdict should be upheld. "Under these circumstances I cannot say as a matter of law that the plaintiff's injuries were not the proximate result of the negligence. That is all we have before us."

Wood, Palsgraf's lawyer, moved the Court of Appeals to allow reargument of the case, alleging that Cardozo had confused the position of Palsgraf with that of her daughter Lillian (at the newsstand), and complained about the chief judge's use of such terms as "distant" and "far away". Wood warned that the decision could have far-reaching adverse effects on innocent passengers. The court denied the motion with a one-sentence statement likely written by Cardozo, "If we assume that the plaintiff was nearer the scene of the explosion than the prevailing opinion would suggest, she was not so near that injury from a falling package, not known to contain explosives, would be within the range of reasonable prevision." Costs of $559.60 were due from Palsgraf to the railroad under Cardozo's order. Posner doubted the sum was ever collected, noting that Palsgraf's family spoke to legal scholars and periodicals about the case in later years, and never mentioned an attempt to collect what would have been about a year's salary for the disabled former janitor.

Helen Palsgraf remained embittered about the loss of her case. She became mute, and suffered from other health problems prior to her death on October 27, 1945, at the age of 61. At the time of her death, Palsgraf was living in <a href="Richmond%20Hill%2C%20Queens">Richmond Hill, Queens</a> with her daughter Elizabeth. Her former attorney, Wood, maintained a law office in the Woolworth Building until his death in 1972 at age 96. His opposing trial counsel, McNamara, remained with the LIRR's legal department until his retirement in 1959, while McNamara's superior and counsel of record, Keany, continued as the railroad's general solicitor until he died in 1935. Justice Humphrey retired in 1936, a year after he gained notoriety for presiding over the marriage of heiress <a href="Doris%20Duke">Doris Duke</a>; he died in 1940. Andrews retired at the end of 1928, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 70; he died in 1936. Cardozo was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1932 by President <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> and served there until his death in 1938.

After the "Palsgraf" case became prominent among lawyers, having been taught to many of them in law school, members of the family sometimes encountered startled reactions when lawyers learned their last name. Frank Palsgraf, Helen's grandson, told in 1978 of "being treated like a celebrity" by a prosecutor when called for jury duty, and causing the judge to reminisce about hard nights studying the case in law school. Nevertheless, the prosecutor struck him from the jury. According to Posner, the later coverage of the family "makes it clear that, with the exception of Mrs. Palsgraf, the Palsgraf family was thrilled by its association with a famous case, notwithstanding the outcome". In 1991, that association became closer, as Lisa Newell, first cousin four times removed of Judge Cardozo, married Palsgraf's great-grandson, J. Scott Garvey.

"Palsgraf" came to the attention of the legal world quickly. Dean <a href="William%20L.%20Prosser">William L. Prosser</a> of the <a href="Boalt%20Hall">University of California Law School</a> wrote that the Appellate Division's decision fell into the hands of Professor Francis H. Bohlen of the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania%20Law%20School">University of Pennsylvania Law School</a>. Bohlen was at that time the Reporter compiling the first "<a href="Restatement%20of%20Torts">Restatement of Torts</a>" for the <a href="American%20Law%20Institute">American Law Institute</a> (ALI), and Cardozo was informally one of the advisers. In that task, Bohlen was having difficulty dealing with the concept of duty of care in negligence, especially involving unforeseeable plaintiffs, and Prosser related that Cardozo was treated to a learned discussion by the other advisers of a case that might come before his court and, convinced by the arguments, used them to decide "Palsgraf". Kaufman doubted this story, which was told to Prosser by Dean Young B. Smith of <a href="Columbia%20Law%20School">Columbia</a>, noting that the only meeting of the advisers between the two appeal decisions in "Palsgraf" took place in New York on December 12–13, 1927, beginning only three days after the Appellate Division ruled, and the notes reveal that Cardozo was absent; the chief judge was hearing arguments all that week in Albany. Nevertheless, the discussions and materials from the "Restatement" compilation likely influenced Cardozo in his decision.

Bohlen dwelt heavily upon Cardozo's opinion in "Palsgraf" in presenting the Tentative Draft of the "Restatement" to the ALI's annual meeting, which approved the section citing "Palsgraf" with little discussion. "Palsgraf" quickly became well known in the legal community, and was cited in many cases, some of dubious relevance. According to Kaufman, "the bizarre facts, Cardozo's spin on the legal issue, the case's timing in relation to the Restatement project, its adaptability for law-school teaching, the policy-oriented dissent by Andrews, Cardozo's rhetoric, and Cardozo's name—all these factors combined to make "Palsgraf" a legal landmark." According to Prosser, writing in his <a href="hornbook%20%28law%29">hornbook</a> for law students, "what the Palsgraf case actually did was submit to the nation's most excellent state court a law professor's dream of an examination question". But Professor (later Judge) <a href="John%20T.%20Noonan">John T. Noonan</a> saw more than this, noting that Cardozo was then the nation's most prominent state-court judge: "The excitement of "Palsgraf" was not merely that it was a brilliant examination question; it was an examination question answered by Cardozo."

The first mentions of "Palsgraf" in <a href="law%20review">law review</a>s were case notes written by law students, appearing over the course of the year following the decision by the Court of Appeals. Professor Robert L. Goodhart, in the "<a href="Yale%20Law%20Journal">Yale Law Journal</a>" in 1930, was at the front of an avalanche of commentary to such an extent that by 1938, <a href="Louisiana%20State%20University">Louisiana State University</a> professor Thomas A. Cowan deemed "Palsgraf" "a legal institution". The case entered the standard legal <a href="casebook">casebook</a>s, from which law students learn, in the early 1930s, usually to illustrate the necessary connection between defendant's misconduct and plaintiff's injury in negligence cases. According to Posner, writing in 1990, ""Palsgraf" is now the subject of a large scholarly literature, and is, I believe, the only case reprinted in "all" American casebooks on tort law." Manz wrote, "everyone who has sat in an American law school torts class can recall the basic facts—the crowded railroad platform, the running men, the dropped package, the explosion, and the falling scale. "Palsgraf" has become a sort of legal 'urban legend'—an allegedly true, but improbable, tale told and retold to each new class of law students." Professor W. Jonathan Cardi noted, "in law school classrooms, 'Palsgraf Day' is often celebrated with food and drink, dramatic reenactments, interpretive poems, and even mock duels between Judges Cardozo and Andrews".

"Palsgraf" was soon adopted by some state courts, at times in different contexts: Though some state courts outside New York approved it, others did not, sometimes feeling that foreseeability was an issue for the jury to consider. According to Posner, writing in 1990, Cardozo's holding that there is no liability to a plaintiff who could not have been foreseen "has been followed by a number of states besides New York, but it remains the minority rule. Most states continue to muddle along with the nebulous 'proximate cause' approach, which emphasizes the proximity in time and space of the defendant's careless act to the plaintiff's injury; that was the approach taken by Judge Andrews's dissent in "Palsgraf"."

The overwhelming majority of state courts accept that there must be a duty of care for there to be liability: the courts of Wisconsin, though, have stated that they have adopted Andrews' approach, and impose liability when there was a duty to any person, whether or not that person is the plaintiff. The "Restatement (Second) of Torts" (1965) amended the earlier formulation only slightly, but the third "Restatement" (2009), takes an approach closer to that of Andrews in focusing on whether the defendant engaged in an activity that carried a risk of harm to another (not necessarily the plaintiff), and on whether the defendant exercised reasonable care. The new formulation makes foreseeability, or the scope of the risk, not a hurdle that must be overcome, as in "Palsgraf", but a factor to be weighed with others when determining whether there was negligence. Thus, according to law professor David Owen in his 2009 article, "the "Restatement (Third)" discards Judge Cardozo's elemental work in "Palsgraf" so long ago. And ... also rejects Judge Andrew's valuable insight that juries should be offered a wide range of fairness factors, beginning with foreseeability, in figuring how far responsibility should extend".

According to Posner, "Cardozo's 'bottom line' is that there is no liability to an unforeseeable plaintiff". Don Herzog, in his 2017 book, deemed the "Palsgraf" principle to mean that "if anyone was wronged here, it was the man with the parcel. The guards' wronging him happened to harm Mrs. Palsgraf. But that doesn't mean they wronged Mrs. Palsgraf. And if they didn't wrong her, she can't conceivably prevail in a tort action. Cardozo is not thinking that if he were on the jury, he wouldn't find the railroad liable. He is saying it was a legal error to let the jury finding stand." This is because "the crucial fact for Cardozo is that the parcel of explosives was unmarked. So reasonably careful conductors worry only that if they make it fall, it will break ... They have no reason to worry about the welfare of Mrs. Palsgraf."

Cardozo has been praised for his style of writing in "Palsgraf". Posner noted that in the facts of the case Cardozo "saw instantiated the basic principles of negligence law and was able to articulate them in prose of striking freshness, clarity, and vividness", in an opinion mostly written in short sentences and lacking footnotes or block quotes. University of Pennsylvania Law School Professor <a href="Kim%20Lane%20Scheppele">Kim Lane Scheppele</a> noted that the opinion was "written by Judge Benjamin Cardozo at the height of his formidable powers". Richard Polenberg, in his study of that jurist, stated, "Cardozo had a genius for making it seem that the results he reached were logical, inevitable, and legally unassailable". Prosser stated, "with due respect to the superlative style in which both [Cardozo's and Andrews' opinions] are written, neither of them wears well on long acquaintance. Both of them beg the question shamelessly, stating dogmatic propositions without reason or explanation." Herzog was also less enthusiastic, noting that "the majority opinion is unfortunately written in the curious idiolect I sometimes call Cardozo-speak."

From its early days, there has been criticism of "Palsgraf", and more recently, of Cardozo for authoring it. Cowan, writing in 1938, described its holding as limited to its facts, that given the identical circumstances recurring, the railroad would breach no duty to the new plaintiff by assisting a man with such a package in boarding. Prosser in his 1953 article wondered "how can any rule as to the 'scope of the risk' evolved from two guards, a package of fireworks and a scale aid in the slightest degree in the solution of this question? Is it proper, in "Palsgraf" itself, so utterly to ignore the fact that the plaintiff was a passenger[?] ... until the question is decided, is "Palsgraf" really definite authority even for "Palsgraf" ?"

Noonan's 1976 book chronicled the unwillingness by legal scholars to utilize the "multitude of legal facts not mentioned by Cardozo and Andrews", even though the lower-court record in "Palsgraf" was reproduced in a <a href="civil%20procedure">civil procedure</a> casebook in the 1950s. Noonan criticized Cardozo for not taking Palsgraf's circumstances into account when making his decision, and listed factors that may have influenced Cardozo against the plaintiff, including that he was a lifelong bachelor who did not have Palsgraf's experience of caring for children, and he may have frowned upon Wood's representation of Palsgraf (likely on a <a href="contingent%20fee">contingent fee</a>, something not favored at the time). Posner, writing in 1990, disagreed with Noonan and with <a href="feminist">feminist</a> critics following him, noting that judges take an oath to do equal justice to rich and poor, "so the fact that Mrs. Palsgraf was poor would not have been a principled ground for bending the rules in her favor". Noonan had considered unjust the award of court costs against Palsgraf, and in her 2016 book, law professor Cathleen Kaveny agreed, "the penalty imposed on Palsgraf for seeking justice through the courts was to deprive her, a single mother, of the ability to support her children ... All judges, however can develop empathy. And in telling the story of Helen Palsgraf, Judge Noonan makes a good case for why they should."

In 2011, Cardi analyzed the present-day influence that "Palsgraf" has had on state courts. He found that neither Cardozo nor Andrews has won on the question of how duty of care is formulated, with courts applying policy analyses. "As to the proper doctrinal home for plaintiff-foreseeability, Cardozo has undoubtedly prevailed. Although a clear majority of jurisdictions state that duty is the proper home for plaintiff-foreseeability, Cardozo's vision of foreseeability as a categorical determination has not been widely adopted." But, he noted, "Andrews may have found a back door to victory. Arguably the most important consequence of the "Palsgraf" decision, the resolution of the judge/jury question, appears to lean in Andrews' direction. A majority of courts prefer to leave foreseeability—even as a part of duty—to the jury."

Scheppele put "Palsgraf" in social context, noting that 108 passengers were killed in railroad operations on the LIRR in 1924, a typical figure for it in the 1920s.

1991 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1991 Atlantic hurricane season was the first <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">season</a> since <a href="1984%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1984</a> in which no hurricanes developed from <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a>s, which are the source for most <a href="North%20Atlantic%20tropical%20cyclones">North Atlantic tropical cyclones</a>. The <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">hurricane season</a> officially began on June 1, and ended on November 30. It was the least active in four years due to higher than usual <a href="Wind%20shear%23Effects%20on%20tropical%20cyclones">wind shear</a> across the Atlantic Ocean. The first storm, Ana, developed on July 2 off the <a href="Southeastern%20United%20States">southeast United States</a> and dissipated without causing significant effects. Two other tropical storms in the season – Danny and Erika – did not significantly affect land. Danny dissipated east of the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>, and Erika passed through the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> before becoming <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a>. In addition, there were four non-developing <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20scales">tropical depressions</a>. The second depression of the season struck <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> with significant accompanying rains.

The most significant storm of the season was <a href="Hurricane%20Bob">Hurricane Bob</a>, which at the time was among the ten costliest United States hurricanes. After brushing the <a href="Outer%20Banks">Outer Banks</a> of <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> and <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a> in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, the hurricane made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> on <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>. It caused $1.5 billion in damage (1991 USD), mostly in Massachusetts, and 17 fatalities. The strongest hurricane of the season was Claudette, which reached peak winds of 135 mph (215 km/h) near <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. It passed near the island but did not cause any damage. <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Fabian%20%281991%29">Tropical Storm Fabian</a> was the only tropical storm to move over or near <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> or <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, producing heavy rainfall but no damage. <a href="Hurricane%20Grace%20%281991%29">Hurricane Grace</a>, the final named storm of the season, provided the energy that led to the development of a powerful <a href="nor%27easter">nor'easter</a> known as the <a href="1991%20Perfect%20Storm">Perfect Storm</a>. Originating from an extratropical storm, the Perfect Storm intensified while moving westward toward <a href="New%20England">New England</a>, leaving $200 million in damage and causing coastal damage from <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> to Florida and northward through Canada. It later transitioned into a hurricane over the Gulf Stream, finally dissipating over <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> on November 2.

Before the start of the season, hurricane expert <a href="William%20M.%20Gray">William M. Gray</a> released his forecast for the year's activity, a yearly practice that he began in 1984. In early April, Gray anticipated a "mild" season with fewer than ten <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical storms</a>, of which less than six would become hurricanes. Later that month, the Weather Research Center forecast ten named storms and six hurricanes, of which five would become major hurricanes while three would hit the United States. In early June, Gray released an updated report that predicted the formation of eight tropical storms, four hurricanes, and one major hurricane. The revised June total was very close to the actual season activity, with the exception of forecasting one fewer major hurricane. However, a later revision in August incorrectly anticipated less activity, when Gray predicted seven storms and three hurricanes.

Overall activity in 1991 was below normal. This was partially due to decreased <a href="tropical%20cyclogenesis">tropical cyclogenesis</a> from African tropical waves, which are <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">troughs</a> that move across the ocean with associated <a href="convection%20%28meteorology%29">convection</a>. In most seasons, the majority of storms develop from tropical waves. Of the season's twelve tropical cyclones, only five originated from tropical waves; in addition, only three of the eight tropical storms were from tropical waves, and none had the characteristics of a <a href="Cape%20Verde-type%20hurricane">Cape Verde-type hurricane</a>. From late April to late November, there were 73 tropical waves that exited the west coast of Africa. The total was higher than average, although many of them were poorly defined and had little thunderstorm activity. The waves traversed the Atlantic Ocean further south than normal, typically not becoming convectively active until moving across northern South America. Cyclogenesis was also suppressed by higher than normal <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>, as well as low rainfall amounts across the <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a>. There were also no tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico for only the third time in the 20th century, after <a href="1927%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1927</a> and <a href="1962%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1962</a>. The season produced twelve tropical depressions, which was the lowest in five years. The eight tropical storms was the lowest amount in four years. Four of the storms developed into hurricanes, although for the first time in over 24 years, none of the hurricanes originated from tropical waves.

The season's activity was reflected with a low cumulative <a href="accumulated%20cyclone%20energy">accumulated cyclone energy</a> (ACE) rating of 36. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 <a href="knot%20%28unit%29">knot</a>s (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. Although officially, <a href="subtropical%20cyclone">subtropical cyclone</a>s are excluded from the total, the figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase.

The first storm of the season was Ana, which originated from a <a href="cold-core%20low">cold-core low</a> that persisted east of <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a> by June 25. With an <a href="anticyclone">anticyclone</a> located over Florida, the system moved in a clockwise motion around an <a href="anticyclone">anticyclone</a> located over Florida. The cold-core low gradually developed to the surface, and on June 29, a <a href="low%20pressure%20area">low pressure area</a> formed within a surface <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> over the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>. It moved westward across southern Florida, dropping heavy rainfall along its path. <a href="Punta%20Gorda%2C%20Florida">Punta Gorda</a> recorded a statewide peak of of precipitation. The low moved northwestward and later curved northeastward, exiting into the Atlantic Ocean near <a href="Saint%20Augustine%2C%20Florida">Saint Augustine</a> by early on July 2. Although it was initially disorganized as it moved offshore, the <a href="convection%20%28meteorology%29">convection</a> quickly developed in organization, and by 1800 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> that day it had developed into Tropical Depression One about 85 mi (135 km) south of <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>.

As the depression moved northeastward parallel to the southeast United States coastline, it dropped light rainfall, although portions of Virginia recorded more than 5 inches (130 mm). Late on July 3, a buoy reported <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">sustained winds</a> of 38 mph (61 km/h) over a period of eight and a half minutes. As a result, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Ana. The storm accelerated east-northeastward toward a stalled frontal zone, entering an area of increased <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>. Despite hostile conditions, Ana strengthened slightly, reaching peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). Moving over cooler waters and interacting with the frontal zone, the <a href="atmospheric%20circulation">circulation</a> became broad as the thunderstorms diminished. On July 5, Ana became <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a> (non-tropical) in the northern Atlantic Ocean about 680 mi (1,090 km) to the south of <a href="Cape%20Race">Cape Race</a>.

A <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> emerged off the coast of Africa on June 20, and no significant development occurred until it became Tropical Depression Two in the western Gulf of Mexico on July 5. On its first advisory, a tropical storm watch was issued for from <a href="Baffin%20Bay%2C%20Texas">Baffin Bay, Texas</a> southward to <a href="Tampico%2C%20Tamaulipas">Tampico, Tamaulipas</a>. Nearing the coast of Mexico, the depression attained its peak intensity with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) and a minimum pressure of . Failing to intensify further, Tropical Depression Two made landfall near <a href="La%20Pesca%2C%20Tamaulipas">La Pesca, Tamaulipas</a>, <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> on July 6. The National Hurricane Center issued the final advisory on July 7, although the circulation persisted until July 9 southwest of Texas. The depression had only minor impacts in Mexico and Texas, other than rainfall. Precipitation was heaviest in <a href="San%20Luis%20Potos%C3%AD">San Luis Potosí</a>, where the rainfall peaked at 17.47 in (444 mm) in <a href="Tamazunchale">Tamazunchale</a>, Mexico.
Hurricane Bob originated from a decaying cold front, developing into a tropical depression early on August 16 near the Bahamas. It produced an area of organized convection, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bob roughly 18 hours after forming. It gradually organized over the <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a>, and based on reports from the <a href="Hurricane%20Hunters">Hurricane Hunters</a>, Bob attained hurricane status on August 17. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane began to turn towards the north-northeast in response to a <a href="subtropical%20ridge">subtropical ridge</a> over the Atlantic and the trough over the southeastern United States. After further intensification off the Carolinas, Bob reached peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) to the east of Virginia on August 19, making it a major hurricane. Significantly cooler <a href="sea%20surface%20temperatures">sea surface temperatures</a> resulted in weakening. After brushing <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>, the center of Bob moved over <a href="Block%20Island%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Block Island, Rhode Island</a>. About 40 minutes later it struck <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a> with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h), making it a Category 2 hurricane. It rapidly weakened to tropical storm intensity while moving through the remainder of New England, hitting <a href="Rockport%2C%20Maine">Rockport, Maine</a> early on August 20. After crossing <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>, Bob became extratropical in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20St.%20Lawrence">Gulf of St. Lawrence</a> and lasted another nine days before dissipating west of <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>.

The hurricane first affected the Carolinas, spawning four confirmed and nine unconfirmed tornadoes in North Carolina. One person each died in North and South Carolina, and about 10% of houses in the <a href="Outer%20Banks">Outer Banks</a> sustained minor roof damage. As the storm moved up the coast, heavy rain fell on the western side of the center. High winds left 300,000 people without power on <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>. In neighboring Connecticut, strong winds downed trees across the region, with damage heaviest in the southeastern portion near the coast. Damage was heaviest as Bob made its final landfall, with wind gusts of 105 mph (168 km/h) reported on <a href="Block%20Island">Block Island</a>, <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>. The hurricane produced extensive <a href="Coastal%20erosion">beach erosion</a> which destroyed coastal roads in the state. Monetary damage was greatest in Massachusetts, and along Bob's path through southeastern New England more than 60% of people were left without power. High tides and strong winds destroyed boats and houses along the Massachusetts coastline. The heaviest rainfall from the hurricane fell at the <a href="Portland%20International%20Jetport">Portland International Jetport</a> in <a href="Maine">Maine</a>, where fell during its passage. Across the United States, damage totaled $1.5 billion (1991 USD), including over $1 billion in Massachusetts. The high damage total made Bob among the ten costliest U.S. hurricanes at the time. In addition, there were 15 fatalities in the country. In Canada, high waves killed two people. In <a href="Fredericton">Fredericton</a>, <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>, tropical storm-force winds downed trees and power lines.

One of the few vigorous tropical waves of the season emerged from the western coast of Africa with a large area of convection in late August. On August 24 it developed into a tropical depression near Cape Verde. Upon first forming, the depression had a circular area of convection near the center. It was initially well-organized, but the depression was not expected to intensify due to marginal water temperatures; tropical cyclones generally require warm waters to develop. By August 25, the system lost much of its deep convection, and on August 26 the depression dissipated to the west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands.

Around the same time as the previous system dissipated, another tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 26. On August 28 it formed into a tropical depression about southwest of <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a>. Upon developing, the depression had a small area of convection with a spiral rainband, and the NHC anticipated slow strengthening to tropical storm status. With a <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> to the north, the depression maintained a general westward track. Ultimately, the depression failed to organize significantly. By August 29, it had a broad and poorly organized circulation with only scattered convection. Due to cool water temperatures, the system was unable to maintain deep convection, and on August 31 the depression degenerated into a tropical wave about 400 miles (645 km) east of the Lesser Antilles.

The origins of Claudette were non-tropical, developing on September 4 about 650 mi (1,000 km) southeast of <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> from an upper-level disturbance. Following its formation, it developed slowly while moving southwestward, and on September 5 it intensified into Tropical Storm Claudette. Conditions were favorable for development, with low wind shear and a large anticyclone providing <a href="outflow%20%28meteorology%29">outflow</a>, or the outward wind flow from a storm. On September 6 at 0600 UTC, Claudette attained hurricane status. It underwent rapid intensification, and early on September 7 a reconnaissance flight reported that Claudette attained major hurricane status with winds of . Based on satellite estimates, Hurricane Claudette attained its peak intensity with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum pressure .

After peaking, Claudette began steady weakening. Around that time, a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches">hurricane watch</a> was issued for the island of Bermuda, which was later upgraded to a warning. The hurricane turned to the northwest, passing east of Bermuda as a Category 1 hurricane on September 8. Winds on the island peaked at , with gusts to , and waves reached up to 8 ft (2.43 m) in height. By September 10, Claudette weakened to tropical storm status as it accelerated eastward. The next day it deteriorated further to tropical depression status, and the next day Claudette became extratropical to the southwest of the Azores. It persisted two more days until dissipating over the Azores.

One of the most vigorous tropical waves of the season (which also led to the formation of <a href="1991%20Pacific%20hurricane%20season%23Hurricane%20Jimena">Hurricane Jimena</a> in the eastern <a href="Pacific">Pacific</a>) was first observed in western Africa on September 2. Three days later it emerged from the coast at <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a>, moving into the tropical Atlantic Ocean with rainbands around its convection. By early on September 7, the system organized into Tropical Depression Seven about south-southwest of Cape Verde. Upon developing, the depression had a broad circulation, located in an environment generally favorable for intensification. With a strong ridge to the north, the depression tracked steadily westward. After remaining a tropical depression for about 36 hours, the system became better organized and developed well-defined <a href="rainband">banding features</a>. Based on satellite intensity estimates, the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Danny on September 8.

Upon becoming a tropical storm, only slow strengthening was forecast, due to the presence of an upper-level trough to its west. The storm ultimately reached peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h), which it maintained for about 36 hours. On September 10 it attained its organizational maximum after developing a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%23structure">central dense overcast</a>. Later that day, an upper-level low increased wind shear over the storm, which exposed the circulation from the deep convection. As Danny approached the Lesser Antilles, it weakened to tropical depression status on September 11. Later that day, a Hurricane Hunters flight was unable to locate a closed circulation, which indicated that Danny degenerated into a tropical wave about east of the Lesser Antilles. The remnants tracked to the northwest and later to the north before being absorbed by a frontal system.

The origins of Tropical Storm Erika were from a tropical wave that exited the coast of Africa on September 2. It moved northwestward, passing through Cape Verde the following day. The system had most of the thunderstorms along the southern portion of the wave as it maintained a very large low-level circulation. Thunderstorms began developing on September 7, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Eight the following day about 920 mi (1480 km) northeast of the Lesser Antilles; at the same time, it was located about midway between Hurricane Claudette and Tropical Storm Danny. Initially the center was difficult to locate on satellite imagery, but despite the proximity with Claudette, conditions were generally favorable for intensification. By late on September 9, the depression had become much better organized, and based on satellite estimates the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Erika.

Upon becoming a tropical storm, Erika began a motion to the northeast. There was initial uncertainty whether Erika or nearby Claudette would become the dominant system through <a href="Fujiwhara%20effect">their interaction</a>. On September 10, the storm developed a central dense overcast as it attained its peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). It accelerated east-northeastward toward the Azores along the northern periphery of a ridge, briefly interacting with Claudette. By September 11, the convection had diminished, leaving the center exposed as Erika underwent extratropical transition. Shortly thereafter it passed through the Azores, striking <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Miguel%20Island">São Miguel Island</a>. Nearby <a href="Santa%20Maria%20Island%20%28Azores%29">Santa Maria Island</a> reported tropical storm force winds with gusts to 67 mph (107 km/h), prompting the closure of the airfield for several hours. On September 12, Erika weakened to a tropical depression before completing the transition into an extratropical cyclone. It dissipated later that day.
Tropical Storm Fabian developed on October 15 in the western Caribbean from the interaction of a cold front and a tropical wave. Initially the storm was disorganized, with its strongest winds located primarily east of the center. An eastward-moving upper-level <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> imparted a northeast motion as well as unfavorable <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>. After reaching peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h), Fabian crossed the <a href="Isle%20of%20Youth">Isle of Youth</a> before crossing western Cuba. There, it dropped heavy rainfall, including in a six-hour period in one location. By early on October 16, the center was becoming difficult to locate as Fabian moved through the <a href="Florida%20Straits">Florida Straits</a>. It passed just southeast of the Florida coastline, prompting the closure of two state parks and dropping of rainfall in <a href="Conch%20Key%2C%20Florida">Conch Key</a>. Effects were minimal, with winds gusting to 32 mph (52 km/h) in <a href="Key%20West%2C%20Florida">Key West</a>. The storm later moved through the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> and became extratropical as it interacted with an approaching front.

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on October 19. Moving westward, it developed a weak circulation on October 23. Despite the presence of strong shear, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression at 2200 UTC on October 24 about 1100 miles (1775 km) east of the Lesser Antilles. This was based on a rating of 1.5 on the <a href="Dvorak%20technique">Dvorak technique</a>, which is a method of estimating the intensity of tropical cyclones via satellite. At the time of development, the depression had a small area of convection near and east of the center, and due to the wind shear it was never expected to intensify. By October 25, the circulation had become dissociated from the convection. The depression dissipated soon after without affecting land.

On October 23 a mid-level low formed south of <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. By two days later it had become a surface low, and on October 26 it developed into a <a href="subtropical%20storm">subtropical storm</a>. The system was labeled as such due to the initial lack of deep convection over the center, although following an increase in thunderstorms the NHC reclassified it as Tropical Storm Grace late on October 27. By that time, the storm had executed a path generally to the northwest. Grace continued to intensify and organize, and based on Hurricane Hunter reports the storm was upgraded to a hurricane early on October 28. Shortly thereafter, Grace turned sharply to the east due to the influence of a rapidly intensifying extratropical cyclone off the <a href="New%20England">New England</a> coast. An eye developed in the center of Grace, despite shallow convection.

As the hurricane accelerated eastward, it attained a peak intensity of 100 mph (155 km/h) on October 29. The rapid motion caused an asymmetry in the wind field, and the center passed approximately south of Bermuda without significantly affecting the island. A rapidly approaching cold front absorbed Grace on October 29, contributing moisture to the developing extratropical storm that was eventually known as the <a href="1991%20Perfect%20Storm">Perfect Storm</a>. As a tropical cyclone, Grace produced squally conditions across Bermuda, but no damage was reported. The hurricane generated large swells along the <a href="U.S.%20East%20Coast">East Coast</a> of the United States, causing minor beach erosion.
The origins of the Perfect Storm were from an area of <a href="low%20pressure">low pressure</a> that developed off <a href="Atlantic%20Canada">Atlantic Canada</a> on October 28. It moved southward and westward as an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> due to a ridge to its north, and reached its peak intensity. The storm lashed the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast of the United States</a> with high waves and coastal flooding, before turning to the southwest and weakening. Moving over warmer waters, the system transitioned into a <a href="subtropical%20cyclone">subtropical cyclone</a> before becoming a tropical storm. It executed a loop off the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic states</a> and turned toward the northeast. On November 1 the system evolved into a full-fledged hurricane with peak winds of . The tropical system weakened, striking Nova Scotia as a tropical storm before dissipating.

Damage totaled over $200 million (1991 USD) and the death toll was thirteen. Most of the damage occurred while the storm was extratropical, after waves up to struck the coastline from Canada to Florida and southeastward to Puerto Rico. In Massachusetts, where damage was heaviest, over 100 homes were destroyed or severely damaged. To the north, more than 100 homes were affected in Maine, including the vacation home of <a href="George%20H.W.%20Bush">George H.W. Bush</a>, the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">president</a> at the time. More than 38,000 people were left without power, and along the coast high waves inundated roads and buildings. In portions of New England, damage was worse than had occurred from <a href="Hurricane%20Bob">Hurricane Bob</a> two months prior. However, aside from tidal flooding along rivers, the storm's effects were primarily along the coastline. A buoy off the coast of Nova Scotia reported a wave height of 100.7 ft (30.7 m), the highest ever recorded in the province's offshore waters. In the middle of the storm, the "<a href="Andrea%20Gail">Andrea Gail</a>" sunk, claiming the lives of its crew of six, which later inspired the <a href="The%20Perfect%20Storm%20%28book%29">book</a> as well as the <a href="The%20Perfect%20Storm%20%28film%29">movie</a> "The Perfect Storm". Off the coast of New York, a Coast Guard helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed, and although four members of its crew were rescued, one was killed. Two people died after their boat sank off <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a>. High waves swept a person to their death in both Rhode Island and Puerto Rico, and another person was blown off a bridge in New York. The tropical cyclone that formed late in the storm's duration caused little impact, limited to power outages and slick roads; one person was killed in Newfoundland from a traffic accident related to the storm.
The list below shows the names that appeared on the tropical cyclone naming list in the <a href="Atlantic%20basin">Atlantic basin</a> in 1991. Although the Perfect Storm later evolved into a hurricane, in which could have been named "Henri", the National Hurricane Center left it unnamed due to the heavy damage and media interest in the predecessor extratropical storm. It later received the name the "Perfect Storm" after a conversation between Boston <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a> forecaster <a href="Robert%20Case">Robert Case</a> and author <a href="Sebastian%20Junger">Sebastian Junger</a>. The names not retired from this list in 1991 appeared again on the naming list for the <a href="1997%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1997 season</a>. This is the same list used for the <a href="1985%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1985 season</a>, with the exception of the names Erika and Grace, which replaced the names Elena and Gloria after the 1985 season, and were used for the first time in 1991. Names that were not assigned are marked in .

At their meeting in the spring of 1992, the <a href="World%20Meteorological%20Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a> retired the name Bob from the list above due to its high impact. The name that replaced it on the naming list for the <a href="1997%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1997 season</a> was Bill.

This is a table of all of the storms that have formed in the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s) –denoted by bold location names – damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1991 USD.

Lee Smith (baseball)

Lee Arthur Smith (born December 4, 1957) is an American right-handed <a href="baseball">baseball</a> <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> who played 18 years in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) for eight teams. Lee served mostly as a <a href="relief%20pitcher">relief pitcher</a> during his career. One of the dominant <a href="closer%20%28baseball%29">closers</a> in baseball history, Smith held the major league record for career <a href="save%20%28baseball%29">saves</a> from until , when <a href="San%20Diego%20Padres">San Diego Padres</a> relief pitcher <a href="Trevor%20Hoffman">Trevor Hoffman</a> passed his final total of 478. Smith was elected to the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Baseball Hall of Fame</a> on December 9, 2018 as part of the <a href="Veterans%20Committee%232016%20revisions">Today's Game Era Committee</a> vote.

A native of <a href="Jamestown%2C%20Louisiana">Jamestown</a> in <a href="Bienville%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Bienville Parish</a> in north <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, Smith was scouted by <a href="Buck%20O%27Neil">Buck O'Neil</a> and drafted by the Cubs in the 1975 <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Draft">Major League Baseball Draft</a>. Smith was an intimidating figure on the pitcher's mound at 6 feet, 6 inches (1.98 m) and 265 <a href="pound%20%28mass%29">pounds</a> (120 <a href="kilogram">kg</a>) with a 95-mile per hour (150 km/h) <a href="fastball">fastball</a>. In , Smith set a <a href="National%20League">National League</a> (NL) record with 47 saves for the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a>, and was runner-up for the league's <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a>; it was the second of three times he led the NL in saves, and he later led the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL) once while with the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> in . He also set the major league career record for <a href="games%20finished">games finished</a> (802), and his 1,022 career <a href="games%20pitched">games pitched</a> were the third-most in history when he retired; he still holds the team records for career saves for the Cubs (180), and he also held the Cardinals record (160) until 2006.

After the end of his major league career, Smith spent time working as a pitching instructor at the minor-league level with the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Giants">San Francisco Giants</a>. He then served as the pitching coach for the <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20baseball%20team">South Africa national baseball team</a> in the <a href="2006%20World%20Baseball%20Classic">2006 World Baseball Classic</a> and 2009 World Baseball Classic. Lee currently continues his job as a minor-league roving pitching instructor for the Giants.

Lee Smith was born in <a href="Jamestown%2C%20Louisiana">Jamestown, Louisiana</a>, and raised in the small town of <a href="Castor%2C%20Louisiana">Castor</a> in <a href="Bienville%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Bienville Parish</a>. <a href="Buck%20O%27Neil">Buck O'Neil</a> claimed credit for having <a href="Scout%20%28sport%29">scouted</a> him. At age 17, partly on O'Neil's recommendation, Smith was <a href="Draft%20%28sports%29">drafted</a> in the second round as the 28th overall pick by the Chicago Cubs in the 1975 draft. Smith began his professional career as a <a href="starting%20pitcher">starting pitcher</a>. In 1978 with the <a href="Double-A%20%28baseball%29">Class AA</a> <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor league</a> <a href="Midland%20Cubs">Midland Cubs</a>, Smith struggled as a starter with an <a href="Earned%20run%20average">ERA</a> near 6.00, prompting manager <a href="Randy%20Hundley">Randy Hundley</a> to move him to the <a href="bullpen">bullpen</a>. Smith resisted the move and briefly tried <a href="college%20basketball">college basketball</a> at <a href="Northwestern%20State%20University">Northwestern State University</a>. At the behest of former Cubs outfielder <a href="Billy%20Williams%20%28left%20fielder%29">Billy Williams</a>, Smith returned to Midland as a reliever for the 1979 season and pitched well enough to earn a promotion to Class AAA baseball for 1980. With the major league Chicago Cubs struggling to a last-place finish, Smith came into the big leagues as a September call-up that season.

Smith made his major league debut with the Cubs on September 1, , against the <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a>, coming in relief for starting pitcher <a href="Dennis%20Lamp">Dennis Lamp</a>, who had given up four runs and eight hits in the four innings he pitched. Smith pitched one inning, giving up no hits, striking out one and walking two. He finished the season for the last-place Cubs and was invited back to the majors for 1981. He was used mostly as a <a href="middle%20relief%20pitcher">middle relief pitcher</a>. A streak of poor pitching was interrupted by the <a href="1981%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">1981 Major League Baseball strike</a>, and he finished with an ERA of 3.51.

The Cubs' closer for 1981, <a href="Dick%20Tidrow">Dick Tidrow</a>, had a 3–10 season with a 5.06 ERA, and as a result, in 1982 Smith, <a href="Willie%20Hern%C3%A1ndez">Willie Hernández</a> and <a href="Bill%20Campbell%20%28baseball%29">Bill Campbell</a> shared closing duties. Smith pitched well and even <a href="starting%20pitcher">started</a> five games from mid-June to early July. Significantly, former Cubs star pitcher <a href="Ferguson%20Jenkins">Ferguson Jenkins</a> returned to the team in 1982, and became a major influence on the young reliever; Smith credited Jenkins with simplifying his delivery, introducing him to the <a href="slider">slider</a> and <a href="forkball">forkball</a>, and teaching him how to set up hitters. In what would be the last start of his career, Smith picked up his first major league <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hit</a>, a <a href="home%20run">home run</a> off eventual Hall of Famer <a href="Phil%20Niekro">Phil Niekro</a>. Smith managed only two <a href="single%20%28baseball%29">singles</a> for the rest of his career. He saved 17 games during that season and performed as the regular closer for the Cubs, a position he held for the next five years.

In 1983, Smith had his best season in the majors up to that point. By May 6, he had pitched in ten games without allowing any <a href="run%20%28baseball%29">runs</a> while allowing only three hits and <a href="strikeout">striking out</a> 12 batters. His ERA rose to 1.85 by the end of May, but he lowered it to 1.15 in July. Smith was selected for his first All-Star Game but did not fare well, surrendering the final two runs in the <a href="American%20League">American League</a>'s 13–3 rout. Although the Cubs continued losing, Smith finished with a career-best 1.65 ERA—more than two points below the league average—and a career-best 1.074 <a href="Walks%20plus%20hits%20per%20inning%20pitched">WHIP</a> while leading the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> with 29 saves and 56 games finished. He also received a point in the NL's <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a> voting and eight points in the NL <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">Most Valuable Player Award</a> voting.

The Cubs were the best team Smith pitched for in his career. While they finished with the franchise's best record and had their first postseason appearance since 1945, Smith compiled his worst ERA of the decade—although he saved more than 30 games for the first time in his career. In Game 2 of the <a href="1984%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">NL Championship Series</a>, Smith recorded two <a href="Out%20%28baseball%29">outs</a> for the save to give Chicago a 2–0 lead in the best-of-five series against the <a href="San%20Diego%20Padres">San Diego Padres</a>, putting them one win away from the <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a>. In Game 4, the score was tied when Smith began the eighth inning. After a scoreless eighth and a strikeout to start the bottom of the ninth, Smith allowed a one-out ninth-inning single to <a href="Tony%20Gwynn">Tony Gwynn</a>, and <a href="Steve%20Garvey">Steve Garvey</a> followed with a two-run homer to force Game 5. The Cubs led that game in the seventh inning, but the underdog Padres scored four runs and won a trip to the World Series. It would be the Cubs' only winning season in Smith's eight years with the team.

In 1985, Smith for the first time dominated the league in strikeouts as a relief pitcher. After averaging fewer than eight <a href="strikeouts%20per%20nine%20innings">strikeouts per nine innings</a> in each prior season, he improved to 10.32 in 1985. He finished the season with a career-high 112 strikeouts in only 97.2 <a href="innings%20pitched">innings</a>. Meanwhile, the Cubs were in first place until a 13-game losing streak from June 12 to June 25 from which they never recovered.

Smith saved more than 30 games while the Cubs had losing records in 1985, 1986 and 1987. In 1987, he was chosen for his second All-Star Game. When the midsummer classic went into <a href="extra%20innings">extra innings</a>, Smith pitched the 10th, 11th and 12th innings, striking out four and getting credit for the <a href="win%20%28baseball%29">win</a> when the NL scored the only two runs of the game in the 13th.

With his 30th save in , Smith became only the second pitcher (joining <a href="Dan%20Quisenberry">Dan Quisenberry</a>) to reach the mark in four consecutive seasons. Even before then, he was known as one of the most feared relief pitchers in the game. One player told writers Bruce Nash and Allan Zullo for their book, "Baseball Confidential", that one of the most daunting sights in the majors was Smith throwing "pure gas from the shadows" of <a href="Wrigley%20Field">Wrigley Field</a>, which didn't have lights at the time.

Despite his numbers, rumors were swirling about his weight and its effect on his knees and his request for a trade out of Chicago. On December 8, Smith, the team's career leader in saves, was traded to the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> for pitchers <a href="Al%20Nipper">Al Nipper</a> and <a href="Calvin%20Schiraldi">Calvin Schiraldi</a>. Nipper pitched only 104 more innings in the majors, and Schiraldi was out of baseball before age 30. Smith, meanwhile, registered nearly 300 saves after the trade. The trade started Smith on a journey involving seven teams in eight seasons, which may have hurt his chances in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

After losing the <a href="1986%20World%20Series">1986 World Series</a> to the <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a>, the Red Sox compiled a winning percentage below .500 for 1987. One of the main problems was a weak <a href="bullpen">bullpen</a>, and Smith was brought in to rectify the relief problems.

Despite giving up a game-winning home run in his 1988 <a href="opening%20day">opening day</a> <a href="Fenway%20Park">Fenway Park</a> debut, Smith posted his best ERA in five years. The Red Sox had the good fortune of being in the American League's Eastern division; in September, they caught the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> and held off every other team to clinch Smith's second and last trip to the postseason. In Game 2 of the <a href="1988%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">1988 ALCS</a> against the <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Oakland Athletics</a>, Smith gave up three singles, including <a href="Walt%20Weiss">Walt Weiss</a>' game-winning RBI single, in the ninth inning of a tied game. Boston had a 0–2 series deficit going to <a href="McAfee%20Coliseum">Oakland</a>. After Boston lost Game 3, Smith surrendered two insurance runs after entering Game 4 with the score 2–1 to complete the four-game sweep.

Smith's salary rose to over $1.4 million, but he followed his 1988 season with a mediocre 1989, finishing with his worst ERA in five years. For the seventh consecutive season, his number of innings pitched decreased or remained the same. However, he compiled 12.23 strikeouts per nine innings, nearly two higher than any other season of his career. It was also the last of his four seasons with more than 10 strikeouts per nine innings.

Smith's statistics for the 1980s gave him a valid claim as the best reliever of the decade, although he was rivaled by <a href="Jeff%20Reardon">Jeff Reardon</a>. While Smith had four consecutive 30-save seasons, Reardon finished the decade with five consecutive. Smith saved 234 games by the end of 1989, and Reardon had 266. Reardon was also a member of the <a href="1987%20World%20Series">1987 World Series</a>-winning <a href="Minnesota%20Twins">Minnesota Twins</a>. On December 6, , the Red Sox had both closers on their roster when they signed Reardon as a <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a>. Two of the past decade's most dominating closers in history were even pitching in games together for Boston for the first month of 1990 with Reardon <a href="Setup%20pitcher">setting up</a> Smith for a save on April 18—a game started by a third famous pitcher, <a href="Roger%20Clemens">Roger Clemens</a>. The unusual double-closer situation lasted less than a month before Smith was traded to St. Louis for slugging <a href="outfielder">outfielder</a> <a href="Tom%20Brunansky">Tom Brunansky</a> on May 4, 1990.

As was the case in Boston, Lee Smith's first game with St. Louis went poorly as he gave up two runs in his only inning of pitching. He recovered quickly, registered a 0.00 ERA for the entire month of July, and finished his partial season with St. Louis with a 2.10 ERA and 27 saves. The Cardinals, however, were at a low point in 1990, finishing in last place for the only time since 1918. In 1991, St. Louis righted their ship, and Smith accumulated saves at a record pace. With his salary roughly doubled to nearly $2.8 million, Smith reached 40 saves for the first time in his career. On September 28, he picked up save number 45 to tie <a href="Bruce%20Sutter">Bruce Sutter</a>'s National League record from 1984 (Coincidentally, when Sutter and Smith reached 45 saves in their respective seasons, both were ex-Cubs pitching for St. Louis against the Cubs). Smith claimed the league record for himself three days later and finished the season with a career-high 47 saves. One difference for him in 1991 was <a href="Base%20on%20balls">walks</a> as he surrendered only 1.60 <a href="walks%20per%20nine%20innings">walks per nine innings</a>, by far the best in his career to that point. Smith won his first Rolaids Relief Award, received the most significant consideration for league MVP in his career, and finished second in Cy Young Award voting behind only <a href="Tom%20Glavine">Tom Glavine</a>, who had a breakout 20-win season in 1991.

In the early 1990s, records were falling quickly for closers. Lee Smith set the single-season National League record for saves in 1991 and was on pace to break his own record in 1992. However, he fell four short of his record, which was broken the following season by <a href="Rod%20Beck">Rod Beck</a>. In 1992, Smith's former teammate, Jeff Reardon, broke the career saves record held for over a decade by Hall of Famer <a href="Rollie%20Fingers">Rollie Fingers</a>. However, Smith was registering saves at a faster pace than Reardon and by the end of 1992, he was not far behind him on the career list. Just two weeks into the 1993 season, Smith passed Reardon with career save number 358. At age 37, Reardon was slowing down, and Smith was well in front of him when Reardon retired in 1994. The day after setting the career major league record, he saved his 301st National League game to break that record as well. (As had been the case with the single-season NL record, the career NL record was held by Bruce Sutter). Smith had 15 saves in June 1993, the most ever in one month for a pitcher until <a href="John%20Wetteland">John Wetteland</a> and <a href="Chad%20Cordero">Chad Cordero</a> tied him in June 1996 and June 2005, respectively. He reached 30 saves in only the 83rd game of the season, tying the record set by <a href="Bobby%20Thigpen">Bobby Thigpen</a> in 1990 for the earliest any pitcher had reached 30 saves. (<a href="%C3%89ric%20Gagn%C3%A9">Éric Gagné</a> broke the record in 2002). While only in August, Smith logged his 40th save for the third consecutive year, but his ERA had ballooned to a career-worst 4.50. Also, the Cardinals were ten games behind <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia</a>, seemingly out of contention, and Smith was poised to become a free agent after the season. On August 31, , the Cardinals traded Smith to the Yankees for <a href="Rich%20Batchelor">Rich Batchelor</a>. Smith left the team as their all-time save leader until <a href="Jason%20Isringhausen">Jason Isringhausen</a> passed him on June 13, .

The Yankees were just 1½ <a href="games%20behind">games behind</a> the <a href="Toronto%20Blue%20Jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a> when they acquired Lee Smith, and he pitched nearly perfectly for the last month of the season. In eight games, Smith did not allow a single run and picked up three saves and 11 strikeouts. The Yankees as a team, however, did poorly during the remainder of the season, and Toronto easily pulled away to win the division. Smith's New York career lasted just those eight games as he filed for free agency after the season. He signed with Baltimore for 1994 for $1.5 million plus incentives.

At age 36, Smith started 1994 pitching better than ever. In his first 12 games, he had 12 saves and a 0.00 ERA. After nearly two months, his ERA was still under 1.00 and it was still under 2.00 in mid-July. Smith had been selected for the All-Star Game in 1991, 1992 and 1993 but had not played. After his sixth selection in 1994, Smith was brought into the game to hold a two-run American League lead in the ninth inning. Instead, he gave up a game-tying two-run home run to <a href="Fred%20McGriff">Fred McGriff</a>, and the AL lost in ten innings. Smith's bad streak continued for the next several weeks until the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike%20">1994–95 Major League Baseball strike </a> ended the season. He filed for free agency again and signed a two-year contract with the <a href="California%20Angels">California Angels</a> for over $2.5 million while the strike was still in progress.

In 1995, Smith registered a save in every appearance from April 28 to June 25. On June 11, he saved his 16th consecutive game to break the major league record set by <a href="Doug%20Jones%20%28baseball%29">Doug Jones</a> in 1988. He ran his streak to 19 games before finally blowing a save on June 28. (John Wetteland broke the record the next year by saving 24 straight). After keeping his ERA at 0.00 through the first two months of the season, he was selected to his seventh and final All-Star Game, thereby becoming only the fourth player to be an All-Star for four different teams (after <a href="Walker%20Cooper">Walker Cooper</a>, <a href="George%20Kell">George Kell</a> and <a href="Rich%20Gossage">Goose Gossage</a>). Smith did not fare well for the next month, pushing his ERA all the way up to 5.40. Regardless, the Angels held a double-digit lead in the division and seemed set for the postseason. Instead, California suffered one of the worst collapses in major league history, blowing the entire double-digit lead in less than six weeks. While the rest of the team was reeling, Smith reverted to his early-season form and pitched fantastically for the last two months, only blowing one save attempt in that span. He finished the season with 37 saves and a 3.47 ERA, which was more than a point higher than the league average.

For 1996, the Angels replaced Smith in the closer role with second-year pitcher <a href="Troy%20Percival">Troy Percival</a>. After only eight games as a setup pitcher, Smith, who was unhappy in California, was traded to Cincinnati for <a href="Chuck%20McElroy">Chuck McElroy</a> on May 27. He resumed setup duty for the Reds—this time for <a href="Jeff%20Brantley">Jeff Brantley</a>, who was in the midst of his best season—but did not fare as well in his return to the National League. His ERA was nearly as high as the league average, his strikeout rate was the lowest in 15 years, and the Reds granted him free agency after the season.

He was picked up by the Montreal Expos in the following season for only $400,000 and had the worst season of his career. His last game of the season was two innings of relief during extra innings of an all-Canada <a href="interleague%20play">interleague</a> game (sometimes called the <a href="Pearson%20Cup">Pearson Cup</a>) won by Toronto on July 2. It turned out to be the last game of his major league career. On July 15, 1997, Lee Smith announced his retirement.

After posting career-worsts in ERA (5.82), <a href="hits%20per%20nine%20innings">hits per nine innings</a> (11.63) and several other statistics and then announcing his retirement in mid-July, Smith was released by the Expos on September 25, . Regardless, the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Royals">Kansas City Royals</a> signed Smith as a free agent and invited him to <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> for 1998. When he refused to start the season in the minor leagues, the Royals released him. Later in 1998, he signed a minor league deal with the <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a>, but with an ERA near 7.00 at Triple-A, he retired from the majors again.

Two years after his retirement in 1998, Smith went to work as a roving minor league pitching instructor for the San Francisco Giants. A former teammate, Dick Tidrow, and the manager of the Double-A <a href="Shreveport%20Sports">Shreveport Captains</a>, Jack Hiatt, offered the job to Smith, who gladly agreed, since it was right in his hometown. Smith still held this job with the Giants as of 2009.

In the 2006 World Baseball Classic, Smith served as the pitching coach of the South Africa national baseball team, which was given 20,000 to 1 odds of winning the tournament. In 2007, Smith participated as a coach in the second annual European Baseball Academy for Major League Baseball International in <a href="Tirrenia">Tirrenia</a>, Italy. The Academy provides instruction to young players from Europe and Africa, several of whom have signed professional contracts. He also has three children from a previous marriage, Nikita (born c. 1987), Lee Jr. (born c. 1988) and Dimitri (born c. 1992).

In 1995, Pulitzer Prize-winning sportswriter <a href="Jim%20Murray%20%28sportswriter%29">Jim Murray</a> selected Lee Smith as the active player most likely to be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, describing him as "the best one-inning pitcher the game ever saw", and "the best at smuggling a game into the clubhouse in history." Since his retirement two years later, much speculation has centered on Smith's specific chances of becoming a member of the Hall of Fame as well as the criteria for relief pitchers and closers in general. Only <a href="Hoyt%20Wilhelm">Hoyt Wilhelm</a>, <a href="Rollie%20Fingers">Rollie Fingers</a>, <a href="Dennis%20Eckersley">Dennis Eckersley</a>, <a href="Rich%20Gossage">Goose Gossage</a>, <a href="Bruce%20Sutter">Bruce Sutter</a>, and <a href="Trevor%20Hoffman">Trevor Hoffman</a> have been inducted into the Hall of Fame-based primarily on their relief pitching, and only Sutter and Hoffman have been inducted with fewer innings or starting appearances than Smith. In addition, Fingers and Eckersley – the only two to be elected in fewer than eight tries – won MVP awards, and Sutter captured a <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a>, but Smith was rarely a serious contender for either trophy. He pitched in a transitional era, when closers began to be expected to pitch only a single inning; although Smith and <a href="Rich%20Gossage">Goose Gossage</a> each pitched in slightly over 1,000 games, Gossage ended his career with over 500 more innings. Sutter was the first pitcher ever elected to the Hall with fewer than 1,700 innings pitched; Smith, who pitched fewer innings every year from 1982 through 1989 and never pitched more than 75 innings after 1990, ended his career with fewer than 1,300. In 2005, statistician <a href="Alan%20Schwarz">Alan Schwarz</a> described Smith as a long shot for election despite the career record, and used <a href="Retrosheet">Retrosheet</a> data to compare the saves of several top relievers including Smith, Eckersley, Fingers, Gossage and Sutter. While Smith's save percentage (82%), outs per save (3.72) and average of inherited runners per game (.50) compared well with Eckersley's marks (84%, 3.33, .49), his figures in the last two categories sharply trailed those of the others; Fingers, Gossage and Sutter all averaged between 4.72 and 4.82 outs per save, with Sutter inheriting .67 runners per game and the other two .86, suggesting their saves were harder to achieve. Smith started his career earning multiple-inning saves, but the strategy in baseball for closers changed, and he was later used as a one-inning pitcher. He had a higher career save percentage than Fingers, Gossage and Sutter. <a href="Trevor%20Hoffman">Trevor Hoffman</a> and <a href="Mariano%20Rivera">Mariano Rivera</a> both exceeded Smith's former record of 478 saves, and the two are now widely considered the best one-inning closers ever.

At Sutter's July 2006 induction to the Hall, Smith talked with reporters about his chances for election. Like many others, he commented that he was puzzled that he had not yet been selected. "This confuses the hell out of me. But I've always been baffled by it", he said. Smith's candidacy may have been hampered by the number of outstanding relievers on the ballot; Sutter had earned increasing vote totals for nine years before Smith appeared on the ballot, and Gossage—who first appeared on the ballot three years before Smith—has received greater support in each year from 2004 until his induction in 2008.

To be eligible for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame, a candidate needs to receive votes on 75 percent of the total ballots cast by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. However, if the candidate receives less than 5 percent, he is no longer eligible for future Hall of Fame consideration by the BBWAA. Smith was first eligible for the ballot five years after he retired, and was allowed to be on the ballot through 2017 if he continued to meet the minimum vote threshold. Should he fail to be elected by the BBWAA, he would remain eligible for consideration by the <a href="Veterans%20Committee">Veterans Committee</a>; under current rules, his first chance for consideration by that body would be in 2018 for the induction class of 2019. In his first year of eligibility, <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%202003">2003</a>, Smith received 210 votes, or 42 percent of the 496 total ballots cast. The <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%202004">following year</a>, Smith only received 185 votes, or 37 percent of the 506 total ballots cast. In <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%202005">2005</a>, Smith improved from the previous year's results, and received a total of 200 votes, or 39 percent of the 516 total cast. Smith came closer to joining the Hall of Fame in <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%202006">2006</a> by receiving 45 percent of the ballots cast, or 234 votes. In <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%202007">2007</a>, Smith's received only 217 votes, just 40 percent of the 545 total ballots cast. Smith increased his total in <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%202008">2008</a>, with 235 votes, 43.3% of the total ballots cast. He received 44.5% of the vote in 2009 and 47.3% of the vote in 2010. In 2011, he received 45.3% of the vote. He peaked at a new high of 50.6% in 2012, but dropped down to 47.8% the following year. In 2014, he dropped to 29.9%, but received 30.2% of the vote in 2015. He failed to gain induction in 2017, when he received 34.2% of the vote in his 15th and final year on the ballot. Smith is the last player to appear on fifteen BBWAA ballots, grandfathered after a 2014 change limited players to ten years on the ballot.

Smith was eventually elected to the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Baseball Hall of Fame</a> on December 9, 2018 as part of the <a href="Veteran%27s%20Committee">Today's Game Committee</a> vote alongside outfielder <a href="Harold%20Baines">Harold Baines</a>. Smith was voted in unanimously, while Baines reached the 75% threshold with 12 out of 16 votes.

Ridge Route

The Ridge Route, officially the Castaic–Tejon Route, was a two-lane highway between <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County%2C%20California">Los Angeles County</a> and <a href="Kern%20County%2C%20California">Kern County</a>, California. Opened in 1915 and paved with <a href="concrete">concrete</a> between 1917 and 1921, the road was the first <a href="paved%20highway">paved highway</a> directly linking the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Basin">Los Angeles Basin</a> with the <a href="San%20Joaquin%20Valley">San Joaquin Valley</a> over the <a href="Tejon%20Pass">Tejon Pass</a> and the rugged <a href="Sierra%20Pelona%20Mountains">Sierra Pelona Mountains</a> ridge south of <a href="Gorman%2C%20California">Gorman</a>. Much of the old road runs through the <a href="Angeles%20National%20Forest">Angeles National Forest</a>, and passes by many historical landmarks, including the National Forest Inn, Reservoir Summit, Kelly's Half Way Inn, Tumble Inn, and Sandberg's Summit Hotel. North of the forest, the Ridge Route passed through Deadman's Curve before ending at <a href="Grapevine%2C%20California">Grapevine</a>.

Most of the road was bypassed in 1933–34 by the three-lane Ridge Route Alternate, then <a href="U.S.%20Route%2099%20in%20California">U.S. Route 99</a> (US 99), to handle increased traffic and remove many curves. The four-lane US 99 was completed in 1953 and replaced by a <a href="freeway">freeway</a>, <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20California">Interstate 5</a> (I-5) around 1968. The portion of the road within the Angeles National Forest was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1997, following the efforts of Harrison Scott. Much of the road has been closed by the <a href="U.S.%20Forest%20Service">U.S. Forest Service</a>; other remnants of the road are used by local traffic.

The Ridge Route was officially the Castaic–Tejon Route. The official limits of the Ridge Route, as built in the 1910s, were <a href="State%20Route%20126%20%28California%29">SR 126</a> at <a href="Castaic%20Junction%2C%20California">Castaic Junction</a> and the bottom of the grade at <a href="Grapevine%2C%20California">Grapevine</a>. Until 1930–31 the road from <a href="San%20Fernando%2C%20California">San Fernando</a> to Castaic Junction ran through the <a href="Newhall%20Tunnel">Newhall Tunnel</a> at <a href="San%20Fernando%20Pass">San Fernando Pass</a> and along San Fernando Road, Magic Mountain Parkway (both part of SR 126 until the early 2000s) and Feedmill Road to a former bridge over the <a href="Santa%20Clara%20River%20%28California%29">Santa Clara River</a>. A 1930 bypass of the tunnel and <a href="Newhall%2C%20California">Newhall</a> through <a href="Weldon%20Canyon">Weldon Canyon</a> is now part of The Old Road.

From Castaic Junction north to <a href="Castaic%2C%20California">Castaic</a> the Ridge Route has been largely buried by the Ridge Route Alternate and Interstate 5. At Castaic the Ridge Route Alternate turned northwest from the old road at , now the intersection of Castaic Road and Neely Street. The first piece of Ridge Route Road out of Castaic has been realigned as recently as the late 1990s when the North Lake housing development was built. The road begins to climb after passing North Lake; a portion was straightened in 1924 and now is next to the southbound lanes of I-5. In this area, known as the Five-Mile Grade, the four-lane Ridge Route Alternate became the northbound lanes of I-5, while the added four-lane alignment, built to the east (next to the old Ridge Route), had lower grades and became the southbound (downhill) lanes to cut down on <a href="runaway%20truck">runaway truck</a>s. Two bridges were built to allow traffic to cross to the left side. Near the north end of this area, the Ridge Route curves away from the newer bypass. The road enters the <a href="Angeles%20National%20Forest">Angeles National Forest</a> about south of <a href="Templin%20Highway">Templin Highway</a>, with the Forest Service road designation 8N04.

Establishments in the forest included the National Forest Inn, Kelly's Half Way Inn, Tumble Inn, and Sandberg's Summit Hotel.

The National Forest Inn was on the west side of the road. A popular place along the route, composed of white <a href="Clapboard%20%28architecture%29">clapboard</a> buildings, it was described in a 1932 <a href="highway%20beautification">highway beautification</a> pamphlet as "the sort of filling station that gets into a national forest and is no addition thereto". On October 14, 1932, a fire began in the garage, and took over a day to put out. When the Ridge Route Alternate bypassed the site to the west, the inn was not rebuilt, and all that remains are <a href="concrete">concrete</a> steps.

About north of the National Forest Inn is Serpentine Drive, where the road curves around the sides of hills as it climbs out of a low point in the route (about above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>). North of the curves, the road passes through Swede's Cut, also called Big Cut, Culebra Excavation, or Castaic Cut. The cut was the largest on the route, with a depth of .

Reservoir Summit, also called Reservoir Hill, is above sea level. The Reservoir Summit Café was a popular <a href="high-class">high-class</a> restaurant on the east side of the road, closed in the late 1920s; the <a href="Foundation%20%28architecture%29">foundation</a> remains. The summit was named after a now-dry <a href="reservoir">reservoir</a>, one of three probably built for the concrete used in paving the road. Kelly's Half Way Inn was roughly halfway between Los Angeles and Bakersfield. Located on a small knoll with a single tree on the east side of the road, all that remains is remnants of the foundation. The Tumble Inn, later Mountain View Lodge, was on the west side of the road, and closed when the Ridge Route Alternate opened in 1933. Steps, including the top step with "TUMBLE INN" in the concrete, and a <a href="retaining%20wall">retaining wall</a> remain.
The Sandberg's Summit Hotel, later Sandberg's Lodge, was located just north of Liebre Summit, the highest point () on the road, at above sea level. The hotel was built in 1914, and thus served travelers from the opening of the road in 1915. Built of <a href="timber">log</a>s, it was a high-class hotel. The place, which had become a <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a>s factory, burned down on April 29, 1961, from a fire started by the new owner—who was converting it into a "camp-type operation" for <a href="underprivileged%20children">underprivileged children</a>—burning trash in the fireplace. The lease from the <a href="U.S.%20Forest%20Service">U.S. Forest Service</a> was canceled in 1963, and only portions of the foundation and a rock wall remain. The name "Sandberg" is still used by the <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a> for an automated weather station a short distance to the north at Pine Canyon Road. Pine Canyon Road (<a href="County%20Route%20N2%20%28California%29">CR N2</a>) marks the end of the forest and the beginning of county maintenance, and CR N2 uses the old Ridge Route alignment to reach <a href="State%20Route%20138%20%28California%29">SR 138</a> near <a href="Quail%20Lake">Quail Lake</a>.
The Ridge Route crosses the <a href="West%20Branch%20California%20Aqueduct">West Branch California Aqueduct</a> with SR 138, splitting to the northwest on Gorman Post Road. It rejoins the path of I-5 at <a href="Gorman%2C%20California">Gorman</a>, and, from Gorman to the end at Grapevine, most of the old road has been covered over by the Ridge Route Alternate or I-5. The path of the Ridge Route is now named Peace Valley Road and Lebec Road, passing over <a href="Tejon%20Pass">Tejon Pass</a> and past <a href="Lebec%2C%20California">Lebec</a> and <a href="Fort%20Tejon">Fort Tejon</a>. Past Fort Tejon, the route descends through <a href="Grapevine%20Canyon%20%28Kern%20County%2C%20California%29">Grapevine Canyon</a> to Grapevine (named for <a href="grape">grape</a>vines in the area). The best-known curve on the road, Deadman's Curve or Death Curve, is visible from Digier Road on the west side of I-5. The next part of the old road that still exists is near the bottom of the grade, where a number of curves brought the road down to Grapevine. The original plan was to build the road nearer to the center of the canyon, but a March 1914 flood destroyed the work, and the grading was redone higher up. Deadman's Curve and the Grapevine loops were both bypassed by the Ridge Route Alternate, which was built directly over most of the old road in this area. At Grapevine, the land suddenly flattens out, and the road north of Grapevine was the longest straight section of road in the state——in 1926. Most of this road lies under I-5 and <a href="State%20Route%2099%20%28California%29">SR 99</a>, but the southernmost piece in Grapevine was bypassed by the Alternate, and is now in the <a href="median%20%28road%29">median</a> of I-5.

Before the Ridge Route, passage between Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley was more indirect. For example, <a href="El%20Camino%20Real%20%28California%29">El Camino Real</a> (Spanish, "the King's road"), the first major road in California, connected Los Angeles and the various <a href="Spanish%20missions%20in%20California">missions</a>, <a href="presidio">presidio</a>s and settlements with <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> and <a href="Sonoma%20County%2C%20California">Sonoma</a>. The San Joaquin Valley route split from the El Camino Real at present-day <a href="Universal%20City%2C%20California">Universal City</a>, the western leg running along the <a href="Pacific%20Coast">Pacific Coast</a> and coastal valleys and the eastern <a href="El%20Camino%20Viejo">El Camino Viejo</a>, (Spanish, "the old road") laid out via the San Joaquin Valley to San Antonio, now <a href="East%20Oakland">East Oakland</a>.

An alternate route between Los Angeles and Bakersfield followed the southern approach to the Ridge Route to <a href="Saugus%2C%20California">Saugus</a>, but took a longer route between Saugus and Gorman, heading northeast through the <a href="San%20Francisquito%20Canyon">San Francisquito Canyon</a> to the <a href="Antelope%20Valley">Antelope Valley</a> and west to Gorman. The rest of the route, from Gorman toward Bakersfield via the Tejon Pass, followed the same path as the Ridge Route.

The <a href="Butterfield%20Overland%20Mail">Butterfield Overland Stage</a>, the first overland mail service to California, went from <a href="Tipton%2C%20Missouri">Tipton</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> and <a href="Memphis%2C%20TN">Memphis</a> to San Francisco via Los Angeles. From October 1858, when the first stage passed through Tejon Pass, until April 1861, the route was identical to El Camino Viejo, running via San Francisquito Canyon. In order to keep the stages from running directly northwest from <a href="San%20Bernardino%2C%20California">San Bernardino</a> and bypassing Los Angeles, the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County%20Board%20of%20Supervisors">Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors</a> spent $8000 in 1858 (about $ in ) to deepen the cut—later <a href="Beale%27s%20Cut">Beale's Cut</a>—at San Fernando Pass, south of Saugus and Newhall (east of Sierra Highway, west of the Antelope Valley Freeway or State Route 14). The path followed by the stages was changed to pass along the Pacific Coast from Los Angeles in April 1861.

Similarly, the residents of the City of Los Angeles approved the expenditure of a good deal of money towards the building of the <a href="Southern%20Pacific%20Railroad">Southern Pacific Railroad</a>, which had originally planned to bypass the city. The line to San Francisco, including the <a href="San%20Fernando%20Tunnel">San Fernando Tunnel</a> through San Fernando Pass, was completed on September 5, 1876. The railroad's route between Saugus and Bakersfield was even longer than that of El Camino Viejo and the Butterfield Overland Stage, heading east through <a href="Soledad%20Canyon">Soledad Canyon</a> before turning north via <a href="Palmdale%2C%20California">Palmdale</a> to <a href="Mojave%2C%20California">Mojave</a> and northwest over <a href="Tehachapi%20Pass">Tehachapi Pass</a>.

In the 1910s, several power companies built lines through the area. The <a href="General%20Pipe%20Line%20Company">General Pipe Line Company</a> completed an <a href="oil%20pipeline">oil pipeline</a> connecting the San Joaquin Valley's <a href="Midway-Sunset%20Oil%20Field">Midway-Sunset Oil Field</a> with the port at <a href="San%20Pedro%2C%20California">San Pedro</a> in 1913. Its alignment followed the Ridge Route north of Gorman and south of <a href="Reservoir%20Summit%2C%20California">Reservoir Summit</a>, a longer distance than any of the earlier transportation routes, but from Gorman south to the present location of <a href="Pyramid%20Lake%20%28Southern%20California%29">Pyramid Lake</a>, where it turned east to Reservoir Summit, it roughly followed the later Ridge Route Alternate. That same year, the <a href="Midway%20Gas%20Company">Midway Gas Company</a> opened a <a href="natural%20gas%20line">natural gas line</a>, and the <a href="Pacific%20Light%20and%20Power%20Company">Pacific Light and Power Company</a> opened a <a href="electric%20power%20transmission">power line</a>, both staying fairly close to the entire Ridge Route.

The two general routes followed by the Butterfield Overland Stage and the Southern Pacific Railroad—known respectively as the Tejon Pass Route and the Tehachapi or Midway Route—were the main <a href="automobile">automobile</a> routes between Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley around the start of the 20th century. The <a href="State%20Bureau%20of%20Highways%20%28California%29">State Bureau of Highways</a> recommended in 1895 that a more direct route be built to shorten this distance. A <a href="bond%20issue">bond issue</a> was approved in 1909 and 1910 to build a <a href="state%20highway">state highway</a> system, including the Ridge Route. The new <a href="California%20Highway%20Commission">California Highway Commission</a> was unable to raise funds in the <a href="Eastern%20United%20States">East</a>, but Los Angeles again contributed funds to ensure that construction would go forward.

These routes all shared the roadway south of Saugus, which was generally flat but included the crossing of San Fernando Pass. As discussed earlier, this was deepened at the county's expense in 1858. The <a href="California%20State%20Legislature">California State Legislature</a> authorized a <a href="Toll%20road">turnpike</a> in 1861, and it was completed in 1863, then owned by <a href="Edward%20Fitzgerald%20Beale">Edward Fitzgerald Beale</a>. The cut, which came to be known as <a href="Beale%27s%20Cut">Beale's Cut</a>, was deepened by Beale, and lowered once more by the county in 1904. To improve the crossing, the county bypassed the cut with the narrow <a href="Newhall%20Tunnel">Newhall Tunnel</a>, for railroad traffic only, which opened in October 1910.

The California Highway Commission considered several easterly routes between Saugus and Gorman: <a href="Soledad%20Canyon">Soledad Canyon</a> (used by the Southern Pacific) had frequent <a href="Washout%20%28erosion%29">washout</a>s; <a href="Mint%20Canyon">Mint Canyon</a> (used by the Midway Route) was too long and cost too much; <a href="Bouquet%20Canyon">Bouquet Canyon</a> (used by both automobile routes) had bad drainage; and <a href="San%20Francisquito%20Canyon">San Francisquito Canyon</a> (used by the Tejon Pass Route) was steep and narrow. Another possible route, through <a href="Piru%20Canyon">Piru Canyon</a> to the west, was rejected because of a proposal for a dam. This route was later chosen for the "Ridge Route Alternate", but had to be abandoned in the 1970s due to the construction of Pyramid Lake.

Thus, the route chosen was a direct line between Saugus and Gorman, over the top of the ridge for many miles. Due to cost and drainage concerns, and a desire to reduce altering the terrain, the road was built with 697 curves, high in the mountains. Construction on the Ridge Route, officially considered to run from Castaic Junction (west of Saugus on the road to <a href="Ventura%2C%20California">Ventura</a>) to the bottom of the grade at <a href="Grapevine%2C%20California">Grapevine</a>, began in 1914. The highway was one of the earliest projects completed by the California Highway Commission. To construct the road, horse-drawn scrapers were used.

The new road, designed with an ideal <a href="grade%20%28land%29">grade</a> of 6 percent (but with several 7 percent grades, including at Grapevine,) cut the distance by over the Tejon Pass Route or over the Midway Route. A <a href="speed%20limit">speed limit</a> of was enforced between Castaic and Quail Lake, making the trip from Los Angeles to Bakersfield take about 12 hours. On the Ridge Route, between Castaic Junction and Grapevine, the curves added up to a total of about 109.5 complete circles, with a minimum <a href="radius%20of%20curvature%20%28mathematics%29">radius</a> of . The <a href="unpaved">unpaved</a> road, which had cost $450,000 (about $ in ), opened in October 1915.

In addition to being part of the state highway system (as a portion of the unsigned <a href="Sacramento%2C%20California">Sacramento</a>-Los Angeles <a href="Legislative%20Route%204%20%28California%20pre-1964%29">Legislative Route 4</a>), the road was also part of the <a href="National%20Park%20to%20Park%20Highway">National Park to Park Highway</a>, a privately designated <a href="auto%20trail">auto trail</a>, and became part of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2099%20%28California%29">US 99</a> in 1926. The continuation south via Saugus and the Newhall Tunnel towards Los Angeles, also part of Route 4, was added to the state highway system in 1917.

According to the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>", the new route was "one of the most remarkable engineering feats accomplished by the State Highway Commission. It is Southern California's <a href="masterpiece">Magnus Opus</a> ["<a href="sic">sic</a>"] in mountain highway construction." It was also credited with stopping efforts to split California into two states, by linking its two halves over the rugged terrain separating them.

Work on <a href="pavement%20%28material%29">paving</a> the Ridge Route with wide and thick <a href="reinforced%20concrete">reinforced concrete</a> began in 1917, but was delayed until 1919 by the U.S. entry into <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. During work on the road, traffic was <a href="Detour%20%28road%29">detour</a>ed via Mint and Bouquet Canyons. The road was reopened on November 15, 1919, completely paved except north of Lebec, including the grade at Grapevine, which was only <a href="oiled%20%28road%29">oiled</a>. After a <a href="bond%20issue">bond issue</a> was passed in July 1919, this portion was paved from September 1919 to May 1921; the dangerous detour included a 20 percent grade. This paving added about $1 million to the cost, for a total price of about $1.5 million (about $ in ), which was not paid off until 1965. <a href="Asphalt">Asphalt</a> was added on top of the concrete for south from Swede's Cut in 1922, and in 1924 a number of dangerous <a href="blind%20curve">blind curve</a>s were widened and straightened.

In 1929, the state decided to build a new <a href="bypass%20route">bypass</a> of the central portion through Piru Canyon, and to upgrade the northern portion over Tejon Pass and down the hill at Grapevine. This Ridge Route Alternate, or Ridge Alternate Highway, shortened the route by and increased the minimum <a href="radius%20of%20curvature%20%28mathematics%29">curve radius</a> from . This was done over concerns regarding the safety of the road, which had a high number of traffic accidents, as well as the highway's increased use. The old highway was to be relinquished to Los Angeles County, and incorporated into the county road system. Construction began in 1930, and the road south of Tejon Pass was officially opened on October 29, 1933; replacement of the Grapevine grade was completed by 1936. The road, which included a center <a href="suicide%20lane">"suicide" passing lane</a>, cost $3.5 million (about $ in ), paid for by the state <a href="gas%20tax">gas tax</a>. It was estimated that it would pay itself off in 2.5 years with the savings in time and gas. A new bypass of the <a href="Newhall%20Tunnel">Newhall Tunnel</a>, through <a href="Weldon%20Canyon">Weldon Canyon</a>, had been opened on May 28, 1930, thus giving drivers a better route all the way from Los Angeles to Bakersfield. The roadway was widened to an <a href="Limited-access%20road">expressway</a> by 1952 at a cost of $13.5 million (about $ in ), providing two lanes in each direction and a center <a href="median%20%28road%29">median</a>, but retaining <a href="at-grade%20intersection">at-grade intersection</a>s. 

Even this four-lane Ridge Route Alternate was not adequate for the volume of traffic using the road, and construction of the eight-lane <a href="freeway">freeway</a> I-5 with a minimum curve radius of began in June 1963. Large parts of the Ridge Route Alternate were incorporated into the new roadway, but the area through the present <a href="Pyramid%20Lake%20%28Southern%20California%29">Pyramid Lake</a> was completely bypassed. I-5 over the mountains between Castaic Junction and Grapevine was completed on August 24, 1970, at a cost of $103 million (about $ in ).
Meanwhile, portions of the old road continued to exist in as a <a href="county%20road">county road</a>. The longest preserved segment was the part completely bypassed by the Ridge Route Alternate, between <a href="Castaic%2C%20California">Castaic</a> and <a href="State%20Route%20138%20%28California%29">SR 138</a> near <a href="Sandberg%2C%20California">Sandberg</a>, including the portion through the <a href="Angeles%20National%20Forest">Angeles National Forest</a>. The road for about south from SR 138 is part of CR N2.

Harrison Scott, a retired engineer, was traveling north on I-5 with his son in 1991, when his son speculated about the difficulty of driving over the first road through the rugged terrain. Having some extra time, and recalling a drive on the old road in 1955, they left the freeway and traveled along most of the abandoned section. Near SR 138, Scott asked a county road crew which was resurfacing the road if it was still maintained by the county, and the crew replied that they didn't know who maintained it through the desert. It turned out that the county officially owned it but did not maintain it; Scott has since convinced the county and forest to exchange ownership with the <a href="Santa%20Anita%20Canyon%20Road">Santa Anita Canyon Road</a>, then a county road.
For the next six years, Scott worked on getting the road added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>, and finally succeeded when, on September 25, 1997, the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> added the within the forest to the National Register. He subsequently wrote a book, "Ridge Route: The Road That United California", from the research he had done for the National Register application, that was published in 2002.

The route was repaired in 2005 following heavy rainfall, but the road was not reopened , due to objections from Angeles National Forest officials.

Smythe's Megalith

Smythe's Megalith, also known as the Warren Farm Chamber, was a <a href="chambered%20long%20barrow">chambered long barrow</a> located near the village of <a href="Aylesford">Aylesford</a> in the <a href="South%20East%20England">south-eastern</a> <a href="England">English</a> county of <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. Probably constructed in the <a href="4th%20millennium%20BC">fourth millennium</a> <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a>, during Britain's <a href="Neolithic%20British%20Isles">Early Neolithic</a> period, it was discovered in 1822, at which point it was dismantled. Built out of earth and at least five local <a href="sarsen">sarsen</a> <a href="megalith">megalith</a>s, the long barrow consisted of a roughly rectangular earthen <a href="tumulus">tumulus</a> with a stone chamber in its eastern end. Human remains were deposited into this chamber. 

<a href="Archaeology">Archaeologists</a> have established that the monument was built by <a href="pastoralism">pastoralist</a> communities shortly after the introduction of <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a> to Britain from continental Europe. Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe, Smythe's Megalith belonged to a localised regional variant of barrows produced in the vicinity of the <a href="River%20Medway">River Medway</a>, now known as the <a href="Medway%20Megaliths">Medway Megaliths</a>. Several of these still survive: <a href="Coldrum%20Long%20Barrow">Coldrum Long Barrow</a>, <a href="Addington%20Long%20Barrow">Addington Long Barrow</a>, and <a href="Chestnuts%20Long%20Barrow">Chestnuts Long Barrow</a> are on the river's western side, while <a href="Kit%27s%20Coty%20House">Kit's Coty House</a>, the <a href="Little%20Kit%27s%20Coty%20House">Little Kit's Coty House</a>, and the <a href="Coffin%20Stone">Coffin Stone</a> are on the eastern side nearer to Smythe's Megalith. Close to the site of the lost monument is the <a href="White%20Horse%20Stone">White Horse Stone</a>, a <a href="standing%20stone">standing stone</a> that may have once been part of another chambered long barrow.

The site may have been ransacked during the Middle Ages, as other Medway Megaliths were; by the early 19th century it was buried beneath soil, largely due to millennia of <a href="hillwash">hillwash</a> coming down from the adjacent <a href="Blue%20Bell%20Hill">Blue Bell Hill</a>. In 1822, it was discovered by farm labourers ploughing the land; the local <a href="antiquarian">antiquarian</a>s Clement Smythe and Thomas Charles were called in to examine it. Shortly after, the labourers pulled away the stones and dispersed most of the human remains, destroying the monument. Smythe and Charles produced, but did not publish, reports on their findings, and these have been discussed by archaeologists since the mid-20th century. 

Smythe's Megalith was located on the south-facing <a href="combe">combe</a> of <a href="Blue%20Bell%20Hill">Blue Bell Hill</a>, within the vicinity of Warren Farm, near the village of <a href="Aylesford">Aylesford</a> in the south-eastern English county of <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. The location where it was found lies in a large field now to the east of the <a href="A229">A229</a> dual carriageway. Nothing of the monument can now be seen and the specific location cannot be publicly accessed.

The Early Neolithic was a revolutionary period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a> adopted <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a> as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a> lifestyle that had characterised the preceding <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> period. This came about through contact with continental societies, although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The modern Kent region would have been key for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> and its proximity to the continent.

Britain was then largely forested; widespread forest clearance did not occur in Kent until the <a href="Bronze%20Age%20Britain">Late Bronze Age</a> (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Environmental data from the vicinity of the <a href="White%20Horse%20Stone">White Horse Stone</a>, a putatively prehistoric <a href="monolith">monolith</a> near the <a href="River%20Medway">River Medway</a>, supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and <a href="amygdaloideae">amygdaloideae</a>. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely <a href="pastoralism">pastoral</a>, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.

Across Western Europe, the Early Neolithic marks the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape. These constructs include <a href="chambered%20long%20barrow">chambered long barrow</a>s, rectangular or oval earthen <a href="tumulus">tumuli</a> which had a chamber built into one end. Some of these chambers were constructed from timber, although others were built using large stones, now known as "<a href="megalith">megalith</a>s". The long barrows often served as tombs, housing the physical remains of the dead within their chamber. Individuals were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic, instead being interred in collective burials with other members of their community. These chambered tombs were built all along the Western European seaboard during the Early Neolithic, from southeastern Spain up to southern Sweden, taking in most of the British Isles; the architectural tradition was introduced to Britain from continental Europe in the first half of the fourth millennium BCE. Although there are stone buildings — like <a href="G%C3%B6bekli%20Tepe">Göbekli Tepe</a> in modern Turkey — which predate them, the chambered long barrows constitute humanity's first widespread tradition of construction using stone.

Although now all ruined and not retaining their original appearance, at the time of construction the megaliths would have been some of the largest and most visually imposing Early Neolithic funerary monuments in Britain. Grouped along the River Medway as it cuts through the <a href="North%20Downs">North Downs</a>, they constitute the most southeasterly group of megalithic monuments in the British Isles, and the only megalithic group in eastern England. The archaeologists Brian Philp and Mike Dutto deemed the Medway Megaliths to be "some of the most interesting and well known" archaeological sites in Kent, while the archaeologist <a href="Paul%20Ashbee">Paul Ashbee</a> described them as "the most grandiose and impressive structures of their kind in southern England".

The megaliths can be divided into two separate clusters: one to the west of the River Medway and the other on Blue Bell Hill to the east, with a distance between the two clusters of between 8 and 10 kilometres (5 and 6 miles). The western group includes <a href="Coldrum%20Long%20Barrow">Coldrum Long Barrow</a>, <a href="Addington%20Long%20Barrow">Addington Long Barrow</a>, and the <a href="Chestnuts%20Long%20Barrow">Chestnuts Long Barrow</a>. The eastern group consists of Smythe's Megalith, <a href="Kit%27s%20Coty%20House">Kit's Coty House</a>, <a href="Little%20Kit%27s%20Coty%20House">Little Kit's Coty House</a>, the <a href="Coffin%20Stone">Coffin Stone</a>, and several other stones which might have once been parts of chambered tombs, most notably the White Horse Stone. It is not known if they were all built at the same time, or whether they were constructed in succession, while similarly it is not known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage.

The Medway long barrows all conformed to the same general design plan, and all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. The chambers were constructed from <a href="sarsen">sarsen</a>, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of silicified sand from the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them to the site of the monument to be erected.

These common architectural features among the Medway Megaliths indicate a strong regional cohesion with no direct parallels elsewhere in the British Isles. For instance, they would have been taller than most other chambered long barrows in Britain, with internal heights of up to 3.8 metres (10 feet). Nevertheless, as with other regional groupings of Early Neolithic long barrows — like the <a href="Severn-Cotswold%20tomb">Cotswold-Severn group</a> in south-western Britain — there are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments, such as Coldrum's rectilinear shape, the Chestnut Long Barrow's facade, and the long, thin mounds at Addington and Kit's Coty. These variations might have been caused by the monuments being altered over the course of their use.

The builders were probably influenced by pre-existing tomb-shrines. Whether those people had grown up locally, or moved into the Medway area from elsewhere is not known. Based on a stylistic analysis of their architectural designs, the archaeologist <a href="Stuart%20Piggott">Stuart Piggott</a> thought that the plan behind the Medway Megaliths had originated in the area around the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a>; conversely, <a href="Glyn%20Daniel">Glyn Daniel</a> thought their design derived from Scandinavia, John H. Evans thought Germany, and Ronald F. Jessup suggested an influence from the Cotswold-Severn group. Ashbee noted that their close clustering in the same area was reminiscent of the megalithic tomb-shrine traditions of continental Northern Europe, and emphasised that the megaliths were a regional manifestation of a tradition widespread across Early Neolithic Europe. He nevertheless stressed that a precise place of origin was "impossible to indicate" with the available evidence.

The part of the chambered long barrow that was discovered was a stone chamber composed of four large stones. The stones used were sarsens. The northern stone measured by by . The southern stone measured by by . The third stone, on the western side, measured by by . A fourth, smaller stone, measuring by by , was placed to prevent the north stone falling onto its southern counterpart. This may have once been used to divide the chamber in two. Given the recorded dimensions of the stones, Ashbee suggested that the chamber may have once measured in length and could have included as many as ten sarsen stones in its original construction. He also suggested that it would have had a height of around , making it one of the smaller chambers in the Medway region; the chamber at Kits Cot House, for instance, reached over in height, and that at Chestnuts Long Barrow reached a height of about .

Below these megaliths was a flat stone, measuring in length and in width. Lying atop this stone were human remains, reportedly aligned in an east to west orientation. Ashbee noted that such paving stones are rare in recorded chambered tombs, and suggested that it might instead have once been a cover stone that sat atop the chamber, but which had been knocked down at some point in the monument's history. In this scenario, the bones found atop it would have to have been disturbed from their original position. Also on the flat stone, near to the human remains, was the skull of a mole. A small sherd of unglazed pottery was also found with the bones. This need not have dated from the original period of the site's construction; as found at other, better-recorded sites, chambered long barrows could remain open for centuries or millennia after they were built, during which time other material was placed inside. For instance, small sherds of <a href="Beaker%20pottery">Beaker pottery</a>, dating from the Late Neolithic, were found at Kit's Coty House, and the sherd found at Smythe's Megalith might also date from this period.

At the time of the site's discovery, there was no was apparent barrow, in part because the ground level of the area had been raised by millennia of <a href="hillwash">hillwash</a> coming down from further up Blue Bell Hill. However, as a result of what is known of this architectural style from better-recorded sites, it is apparent that this stone chamber would have been located at the eastern end of a long earthen barrow. Ashbee noted that this could have reached a length of 55 metres (180 feet). It may be that kerbstones also lined the sides of this barrow, as is evident at several other of the Medway Megaliths; Ashbee suggested that this could have contained as many as 110 or 120 sarsen stones. The monument may have had ditches flanking its sides, and chalk rubble collected in digging these ditches may have been piled up to help form the barrow.

During the Early Neolithic, the site may have been close to other chambered long barrows; the White Horse Stone, for instance, is nearby and may have once been part of the chamber of these monuments. Various sarsen stones have been found in the vicinity of both, again perhaps reflecting the remnants of since-destroyed long barrows. To the south of the White Horse Stone was a building — termed "Structure 4806" by its excavators in the 2000s — that was constructed in the Early Neolithic period. <a href="Radiocarbon%20dating">Radiocarbon dating</a> from the site suggests a usage date of between 4110-3820 and 3780-3530 calibrated BCE. long and wide, it was a <a href="Neolithic%20long%20house">longhouse</a> of a type known from across various parts of Europe. If it had been a domestic residence, its size would mean that it was only "occupied by a small number of occupants, probably no more than a small family group". A smaller, circular building approximately in diameter was present just to the south-east of the longhouse; there was little dating evidence for this, but what existed suggested a Late Neolithic origin. The archaeologists who excavated these buildings suggested that they might have been "houses of the living" that were intervisible with the "houses of the dead", including Smythe's Megalith. Alternately, they suggested that the longhouse was "part of the funerary tradition", used in preparing "the remains of the dead or for communal activities such as feasting".

Analysis of the bones found in the chamber took place in the 1820s. At the time, it was noted that most of the bones were broken into small pieces — something the examiner believed had been caused by the workmen who recovered them — but that they included pieces of skull, ribs, thigh, leg, and arm bones. There were two right sides of <a href="mandible">mandible</a>s and two portions of <a href="ulna">ulnae</a> including the <a href="olecranon">olecranon</a>, indicating that the remains of at least two individuals were present in the chamber. Analysis of the recovered teeth showed that the <a href="molars">molars</a> were worn down and flattened, indicating that the deceased had been of middle age.

Around away from the Neolithic houses, a settlement was established on a spur of higher ground during the Late Bronze Age and <a href="Iron%20Age%20Britain">Iron Age</a>. This included several <a href="Roundhouse%20%28dwelling%29">round houses</a> and deep pits cut into the underlying chalk. These pits were perhaps originally used for corn storage, although were later infilled with ceramics, iron objects, animal bone, and two human burials. Archaeologists believed that this was not just domestic refuse but had been deposited with greater meaning as part of a <a href="ritual">ritualistic</a> act.

The archaeologist Paul Ashbee suggested that the chambered long barrow may have remained visible into the Middle Ages, and at this point may have been damaged by individuals digging into it. To support this idea, he noted the evidence for such deliberate medieval damage revealed through the archaeological excavation of Chestnuts Long Barrow. Similar claims of medieval destruction have also been made for Lower Kit's Coty House, Kit's Coty House, Coldrum Long Barrow, and Addington Long Barrow. Ashbee suggested that <a href="iconoclasm">iconoclasm</a> was likely, believing that the burial of the stones likely indicated that Christian zealots were trying to deliberately destroy and defame the pre-Christian monument. 

Conversely, the archaeologist John Alexander believed that this damage resulted from a robbery by medieval treasure hunters. Supporting this idea is comparative evidence, with the <a href="Close%20Roll">Close Roll</a> of 1237 ordering the opening of barrows on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a> in search for treasure, a practice that may have spread to Kent around the same time. Alexander believed that the destruction may have been brought about by a special commissioner, highlighting that the "expertness and thoroughness of the robbery" — as evidenced at Chestnuts — would have necessitated resources beyond that which a local community could likely produce.

In 1822, workmen were ploughing in a field that was at the time part of Warren Farm when they found that their ploughs were repeatedly striking stones beneath the surface. Removing the soil, they discovered three large stones several inches below. The farm's owner, George Fowle of Cobtree Manor, called in two men from <a href="Maidstone">Maidstone</a> to inspect the monument: the antiquarian and historian Clement Taylor Smythe, and Thomas Charles, a doctor who lived in Maidstone and who had founded a museum at <a href="Chillington%20House">Chillington House</a>. With Smythe present, the workmen removed the soil around the three stones, also revealing a smaller stone as part of the construct; he was aware of its similarity to the nearby Kit's Coty House. The stones were then removed, likely with the assistance of horses, destroying what remained of the monument. 

The following day, the workmen returned to the site, where they dug deeper and revealed a flat stone on which the human remains were found; Smythe was not present on this occasion. The workmen threw most of the human remains to the side, but some were collected by Smythe and analysed by Charles.

A brief article mentioning the discovery appeared in the "<a href="Maidstone%20Journal">Maidstone Journal</a>" on 4 July 1822; the information in it was then largely repeated in a volume of the "<a href="Gentleman%27s%20Magazine">Gentleman's Magazine</a>" that year. The latter also features some brief discussion as to who the deceased individuals in the chamber had been, speculating that it was "some chief slain in the battle fought here between Vortimer, King of Britain, and the Saxons". A second description of the site appeared in "Gentleman's Magazine" in 1834, written by <a href="S.%20C.%20Lampreys">S. C. Lampreys</a>.

About a year after the discovery, Smythe wrote an account in which he included both a sketch and plan of the chamber. Smythe's original report was not published at the time, but deposited in the archive of <a href="Maidstone%20Museum">Maidstone Museum</a>. In this unpublished document, he referred to the monument as a "British Tomb" or a "Druidical Monument". The document was only published in 1948, in an article written for the "Archaeologia Cantiana" journal by the archaeologist <a href="John%20H.%20Evans">John H. Evans</a>. Evans noted that "meagre and incomplete as it is", "we must be grateful" for this document "when we remember the unrecorded destruction wrought throughout the centuries upon this interesting and isolated megalithic necropolis". 

Alongside Smythe's report, another brief account was also produced and placed in the museum, likely written by Charles and again published in Evans' 1948 article. Ashbee later related that both of the reports written in the 1820s were "brief but valuable" and "in many ways in advance of their age". He noted that the destruction of prehistoric monuments during this "age of agricultural development" would have been quite commonplace and thus these antiquarians' records — written "almost half a century before the emergence of the outlines of present-day prehistory" as a field of scholarly study — were particularly important.

In the 1920s, the archaeologist <a href="O.%20G.%20S.%20Crawford">O. G. S. Crawford</a> accessed the Maidstone Museum archives to determine the probable location of Smythe's Megalith. He then included it in his 1924 <a href="Ordnance%20Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> guide to archaeological sites in southeastern England. In 1955, several substantial stones were also found in the area. In 2000, Ashbee stated that some of the kerbstones had "recently come to light, buried in the ditches" of the monument.

Homer Davenport

Homer Calvin Davenport (March 8, 1867 – May 2, 1912) was a <a href="political%20cartoonist">political cartoonist</a> and writer from the United States. He is known for drawings that satirized figures of the <a href="Gilded%20Age">Gilded Age</a> and <a href="Progressive%20Era">Progressive Era</a>, most notably Ohio Senator <a href="Mark%20Hanna">Mark Hanna</a>. Although Davenport had no formal art training, he became one of the highest paid political cartoonists in the world. Davenport also was one of the first major American breeders of <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian horse</a>s and one of the founders of the <a href="Arabian%20Horse%20Association">Arabian Horse Club of America</a>.

A native <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>ian, Davenport developed interests in both art and horses as a young boy. He tried a variety of jobs before gaining employment as a cartoonist, initially working at several newspapers on the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a>, including "<a href="The%20San%20Francisco%20Examiner">The San Francisco Examiner</a>", purchased by <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>. His talent for drawing and interest in Arabian horses dovetailed in 1893 at the "<a href="Chicago%20Herald%20%281881%E2%80%931895%29">Chicago Daily Herald</a>" when he studied and drew the Arabian horses exhibited at the <a href="World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition">World's Columbian Exposition</a>. When Hearst obtained the <a href="New%20York%20Journal-American">"New York Morning Journal"</a> in 1895, money was no object in his attempt to establish the "Journal" as a leading New York newspaper, and Hearst moved Davenport east in 1885 to be part of what is regarded as one of the greatest newspaper staffs ever assembled. Working with columnist <a href="Alfred%20Henry%20Lewis">Alfred Henry Lewis</a>, Davenport created many cartoons in opposition to the 1896 Republican presidential candidate, former Ohio governor <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a>, and Hanna, his campaign manager. McKinley was elected and Hanna elevated to the Senate; Davenport continued to draw his sharp cartoons during the 1900 presidential race, though McKinley was again victorious.

In 1904, Davenport was hired away from Hearst by the "<a href="New%20York%20Evening%20Mail">New York Evening Mail</a>", a Republican paper, and there drew a favorable cartoon of President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> that boosted Roosevelt's election campaign that year. The President in turn proved helpful to Davenport in 1906 when the cartoonist required diplomatic permission to travel abroad in his quest to purchase pure desertbred Arabian horses. In partnership with millionaire Peter Bradley, Davenport traveled extensively amongst the <a href="Anazeh">Anazeh</a> people of Syria and went through a brotherhood ceremony with the <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> leader who guided his travels. The 27 horses Davenport purchased and brought to America had a profound and lasting impact on Arabian horse breeding. Davenport's later years were marked by fewer influential cartoons and a troubled personal life; he dedicated much of his time to his animal breeding pursuits, traveled widely, and gave lectures. He was a lifelong lover of animals and of country living; he not only raised horses, but also exotic <a href="poultry">poultry</a> and other animals. He died in 1912 of pneumonia, which he contracted after going to the docks of New York City to watch and chronicle the arrival of survivors of the "<a href="RMS%20Titanic">Titanic</a>".

Davenport was born in 1867 in the <a href="Waldo%20Hills">Waldo Hills</a>, several miles south of <a href="Silverton%2C%20Oregon">Silverton, Oregon</a>. His parents were Timothy Woodbridge and Florinda Willard (Geer) Davenport, The family had deep progressive roots; Davenport's grandfather, Benjamin, had been a doctor and <a href="abolitionist">abolitionist</a> whose home in Ohio was a stop on the <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a>. Davenport's parents, who had married in 1854, previously lost two other children in infancy to <a href="diphtheria">diphtheria</a>, but Homer and his older sister, Orla, lived to adulthood. Timothy Davenport trained in medicine, but became a surveyor and writer later dubbed "The Sage of Silverton". He had been the <a href="Indian%20agent">Indian agent</a> for the <a href="Umatilla%20Indian%20Reservation">Umatilla Agency</a> in 1862, surveyor of Marion County in 1864, and later in his life, Oregon Land Agent (1895-1899). He was one of the founders of the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> in Oregon, served as an Oregon state representative from 1868-1872 and was elected a state senator in 1882. He ran unsuccessfully for the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> on the Independent Party ticket in 1874.

Florinda Davenport was an admirer of the political cartoons of <a href="Thomas%20Nast">Thomas Nast</a> that appeared in <a href="Harper%27s%20Weekly">Harper's Weekly</a>. While pregnant with Homer, she developed a belief, which she viewed as a prophecy, that her child would become as famous a cartoonist as Nast. She was also influenced by the essay "How To Born A Genius," by Russell Trall, and closely followed his recommendations for diet and "concentration" during her pregnancy. She died of smallpox in 1870, when Homer was three years old, and on her deathbed asked her husband to give Homer "every opportunity" to become a cartoonist.

Young Davenport was given a box of paints as a Christmas gift. At this stage of his youth, as his father later stated, Homer also had "horse on the brain". Cooped up inside during the winter of 1870–1871, in part because the entire family was quarantined on account of the smallpox outbreak that had killed Florinda, Timothy told Homer stories of <a href="Bedouin">Arab people</a> and their horses. Soon after, at the age of three years and nine months, the boy used his paints to produce an image he called "Arabian horses." He <a href="equestrianism">learned to ride</a> on the family's pet horse, Old John. Following his mother's death, both of Davenport's grandmothers helped raise him. Timothy Davenport remarried in 1872, to Elizabeth "Nancy" Gilmour Wisner, and in 1873, the family moved to Silverton—the cartoonist later recounted that the move to the community, about south of <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a> and with a population of 300 at the time, was so he "might live in the Latin Quarter of that village and inhale any artistic atmosphere that was going to waste".

Homer began to study music, and was allowed to help Timothy clerk at the store the elder Davenport purchased when he first moved to Silverton. Timothy required Homer to milk the cows, but otherwise Homer was to "study faces and draw." He was well-liked by the villagers, but they considered him shiftless—they did not consider drawing to be real work. He exhibited a love of animals, especially fast horses and fighting cocks. Davenport later wrote that his fascination with Arabian horses was reawakened in his adolescent years with his admiration of a picture of an Arabian-type horse found on an empty can of <a href="horse%20liniment">horse liniment</a>. He carefully cleaned the can and kept it as his "only piece of artistic furniture" for many years until forced to leave it behind when he moved to San Francisco. He also played in the community band in his formative years, and with that group young Davenport once traveled as far as Portland.

Davenport's initial jobs were not successful. His first position outside Silverton began when a small circus came to town, and Davenport, in his late teenage years, left with it. He was assigned as a clown and to care for the circus's small herd of horses, which he also sketched. He became disenchanted with the circus when he was told to brush the elephant's entire body with <a href="linseed%20oil">linseed oil</a>, a difficult task. He left the tour and tried to succeed as a <a href="jockey">jockey</a>, despite being tall. Other early positions included clerking in a store, working as a railway fireman, and being a <a href="stoker%20%28occupation%29">stoker</a> on the "<a href="Multnomah%20%28sternwheeler%29">Multnomah</a>".

In 1889, Davenport attended the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Art%20Institute%23History">Mark Hopkins School of Art</a> in San Francisco, California, where he was expelled after a month because of his cartooning; he returned to the school for a brief time in 1892. He worked for free at the "<a href="Newspapers%20in%20Oregon%23Defunct">Portland Evening Telegram</a>", which published several of his drawings, but not for pay. In 1890, he attended Armstrong Business College, but dropped out after a few months.

Although his work took him from Silverton, for the remainder of his life, Davenport was often melancholy for his native Oregon, and in writing to relatives there, he repeatedly told them not to send him anything that would remind him of Silverton, because he would be plunged into despair.

Davenport's first paid job in journalism, in 1889, was drawing for the Portland newspaper, "<a href="The%20Oregonian">The Oregonian</a>", where he showed a talent for sketching events from memory. He was fired in 1890, it was said, for poorly drawing a stove for an advertisement—he could not draw buildings and appliances well. By another story, he was let go when there was only work for one in the paper's engraving department, and he was junior man. He then worked for the "<a href="Newspapers%20in%20Oregon%23Defunct">Portland Sunday Mercury</a>", traveling to New Orleans for a <a href="prizefight">prizefight</a> in January 1891 between <a href="Jack%20Nonpareil%20Dempsey">Jack Nonpareil Dempsey</a> of Portland and <a href="Bob%20Fitzsimmons">Bob Fitzsimmons</a>. When he returned, earned money through selling his drawings as postcards.
Davenport's talent came to the attention of C.W. Smith, general manager of the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a>, and also Timothy Davenport's first cousin. Smith got the young cartoonist a free pass on the railroad to San Francisco in 1891 and wrote a letter to the business manager of "<a href="The%20San%20Francisco%20Examiner">The San Francisco Examiner</a>", essentially a demand that Davenport be hired. He was; the "Examiner"'s business manager had been greatly impressed by doodles that Davenport drew while waiting. At the "Examiner", Davenport was not a cartoonist, but a newspaper artist who illustrated articles—the technology to directly reproduce photographs in newspapers was still a few years away. After a year at the "Examiner", he was fired; several stories state that this occurred after he asked for a raise from his meager salary of $10 per week.

His work, including the New Orleans postcards, had attracted admirers, who, in addition to Smith, helped him to get a job with the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" in 1892. While there, he attracted reader attention for his ability to draw animals. He resigned in April 1893 because he wanted to go to <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> and see the World's Columbian Exposition, and his contacts secured him a position with the "<a href="Chicago%20Herald%20%281881%E2%80%931895%29">Chicago Herald</a>". At the "Herald", one of his jobs was to illustrate the horse races at <a href="Washington%20Park%20Race%20Track">Washington Park</a>. He was dismissed from the "Herald", and in one account ascribed his dismissal to going every day to visit and sketch the Arabian horses on exhibit at the World's Fair. However, more likely, the poor economy and the end of the fair caused the "Herald" to lay him off, and Davenport suggested as much in a 1905 interview. While at the "Daily Herald", he married Daisy Moor, who traveled from her home in San Francisco's to Chicago in order to marry him.

Davenport returned to San Francisco and regained his position at the "Chronicle". This time, he was allowed to caricature California political figures. By then, <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a> owned the "Examiner". In his early days as a newspaper tycoon, Hearst followed Davenport's cartoons in the "Chronicle", and when the cartoonist became well known for his satires of figures in the 1894 California gubernatorial campaign, hired him, more than doubling his salary. When a famous horse died and the "Examiner" lacked an image, Davenport, who had seen the animal the previous year, drew it from memory. Impressed, Hearst purchased the original drawing. Davenport took his responsibilities as political cartoonist seriously, traveling to <a href="Sacramento">Sacramento</a>, the state capital, to observe the legislative process and its participants.

Hearst had been successful in California with the "Examiner", and sought to expand operations to the nation's largest city, New York. Several newspapers were available for sale, including "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", but Hearst then lacked the resources to purchase them. In September 1895, having lost most of its circulation and its advertisers over the past year, Cincinnati publisher <a href="John%20R.%20McLean%20%28publisher%29">John R. McLean</a> made his New York "Morning Journal" available at a price within Hearst's means, and he bought it for $180,000. Hearst changed the name to the "<a href="New%20York%20Journal-American">New York Journal</a>" and began to assemble what Hearst biographer Ben Procter deemed one of the greatest staffs in newspaper history. Under editor-in-chief <a href="Willis%20J.%20Abbot">Willis J. Abbot</a>, the well paid staff included foreign correspondent <a href="Richard%20Harding%20Davis">Richard Harding Davis</a>, columnist <a href="Alfred%20Henry%20Lewis">Alfred Henry Lewis</a>, and humorist <a href="Edgar%20Wilson%20Nye">Bill Nye</a>. Contributors included <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a> and <a href="Stephen%20Crane">Stephen Crane</a>. Davenport was among a number of talented staff on the "Examiner" whom Hearst transferred to New York and employed on the "Journal" at a high salary.

In 1896, a presidential election year, Davenport was sent to Washington to meet and study some of the Republican Party's potential candidates, such as <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> <a href="Thomas%20Brackett%20Reed">Thomas B. Reed</a>. Hearst's "Journal" was a Democratic paper, and Davenport would be expected to harshly caricature the Republican presidential candidate. The Republicans were anxious to take over the White House from Democrat <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>; they were widely expected to do so, as the Democrats were blamed for the economic <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a>, which had brought depression to the nation for the past three years. None of the potential Democratic candidates seemed particularly formidable, and the Republican nominee was expected to win in a landslide.

Reporters and illustrators on the "Journal" often worked in pairs. Davenport was teamed with Lewis and the two soon forged a solid relationship. In early 1896, Lewis went to Ohio to investigate the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, that state's former governor, <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a>. To interview the candidate, Lewis was required to undergo an interview himself, with McKinley's political manager, Cleveland industrialist <a href="Mark%20Hanna">Mark Hanna</a>. Hanna had set aside his business career to manage McKinley's campaign, and was paying all expenses for a <a href="machine%20politics">political machine</a> which helped make McKinley the frontrunner in the Republican race. Lewis got his interview with McKinley, then remained in Ohio, investigating Hanna. In 1893, Governor McKinley had been called upon to pay the obligations of a friend for whom he had co-signed loans; Hanna and other McKinley supporters had bought up or paid these debts. Lewis viewed Hanna as controlling McKinley, able to ruin the candidate by calling in the purchased notes. Becoming increasingly outraged by what he deemed as Hanna's purchase of the Republican nomination, and so likely the presidency, Lewis began to popularize this view in the pages of the "Journal". The first Davenport cartoon depicting Hanna appeared soon after.

McKinley, with the exception of his 1893 financial crisis, had avoided scandal and carefully guarded his image, making him difficult to attack. Hanna proved an easier target. Although Davenport had depicted Hanna in his cartoons before the Republican convention in June, these efforts were uninspired. This changed once Davenport got a look at his subject while attending the <a href="1896%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1896 Republican National Convention</a> in St. Louis. After three days spent closely observing Hanna managing the convention to secure McKinley's nomination and passage of a platform supporting the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>, Davenport was impressed with Hanna's dynamic behavior. Convinced that he could effectively lampoon Hanna, Davenport's cartoons became more effective. Hanna was a tall man; Davenport exaggerated this trait, in part by shrinking everybody else. He also increased Hanna's already substantial girth. Hanna's short sideburns were lengthened and made rougher—Davenport described them as "like an unplaned cedar board". Davenport borrowed from the animal kingdom for his creation, drawing Hanna's ears so they stuck out like a monkey's. The cartoonist described Hanna's eyes as like a parrot's, leaving no movement unseen, or as those of a circus elephant—scanning the street for peanuts.

The resultant caricature of Hanna was given props such as <a href="moneybags">moneybags</a> and laborer's skulls to rest his feet upon, as well as cufflinks engraved with the dollar sign to wear with his plaid businessman's suits. He was often accompanied by William McKinley, usually drawn as a shrunken though dignified figure dominated by the giant Hanna. Even so, Davenport felt the figure seemed to lack something until the cartoonist took the dollar signs from the cufflink and placed them inside every check of the cartoon Hanna's suit. Davenport likely acted at the suggestion of his cartoonist colleague at the "Journal", M. de Lipman, who had depicted McKinley as <a href="Buddha">Buddha</a> in a <a href="loincloth">loincloth</a> with Hanna as his attendant, robes ablaze with an array of dollar signs. According to Hearst biographer Kenneth Whyte, "whatever its origins, Davenport's 'plutocratic plaid', as it became known, was an instant hit."

In July 1896, the Democrats nominated former Nebraska congressman <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> for president. Bryan had electrified the <a href="1896%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic National Convention</a> with his <a href="Cross%20of%20Gold%20speech">Cross of Gold speech</a>. Bryan was an eloquent supporter of "<a href="free%20silver">free silver</a>", a policy which would inflate the currency by allowing <a href="silver%20bullion">silver bullion</a> to be submitted by the public and converted into coins even though the intrinsic value of a <a href="Morgan%20dollar">silver dollar</a> was about half its stated value. <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201896">Bryan's candidacy</a> divided the Democratic Party and its supporters, and caused many normally Democratic papers to abandon him. Hearst called a meeting of his senior staff to decide the "Journal"'s policy. Though few favored the Democrat, Hearst decided, "Unlimber the guns; we are going to fight for Bryan."

Davenport's cartoons had an effect on Hanna. West Virginia Senator <a href="Nathan%20B.%20Scott">Nathan B. Scott</a> remembered being with Hanna as he viewed his caricature wearing a suit covered with dollar signs, trampling women and children underfoot, and hearing the Ohioan state, "that hurts". Hanna could not make public appearances without having to field questions about the cartoons. Nevertheless, publisher J.B. Morrow, a friend of both McKinley and his campaign manager, stated that Hanna "took his course regardless of local criticism". McKinley made no attempt to deflect criticism from Hanna and in fact kept a file of Davenport cartoons that particularly amused him. Despite Hanna's discomfiture, both men were content to have Hanna attacked if it meant that McKinley would not be.

Most of the cartoons Davenport drew during the 1896 campaign were simple in execution and somber in mood. One, for example, depicts Hanna walking down Wall Street, bags of money in each hand and a grin on his face. Another shows only Hanna's hand and wrist—and McKinley dangling from his fob chain. One that is intended to be funny depicts McKinley as a small boy accompanied by Hanna as nursemaid; McKinley tugs at Hanna's skirts, wanting to go into a shop where the labor vote is for sale. Another shows Hanna wearing a <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> hat (McKinley was said to resemble the late emperor), raising a mask of McKinley's face to his own.
Davenport's cartoons ran a few times per week in the "Journal", generally on an inside page. They were, however, widely reprinted—including in Bryan's campaign materials—and according to Whyte, "nothing in any paper came close to matching their impact [on the presidential race]". Hanna biographer William T. Horner noted, "Davenport's image of Hanna in a suit covered with dollar signs remains an iconic view of the man to this day".

Despite great public excitement after his nomination, Bryan was unable to overcome his disadvantages in financing, organization, lack of party unity, and public mistrust of the Democrats, and he was defeated in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201896">the November election</a>. A few days after the election, Davenport went to Republican headquarters in New York to be formally introduced to the man he had so sharply characterized. As witnesses such as Vice President-elect <a href="Garret%20Hobart">Garret Hobart</a> came in to see the good-humored proceedings, Hanna told Davenport, "I admire your genius and execution, but damn your conception."

With the 1896 campaign over, a reporter asked Davenport in February 1897 who would replace Hanna as a special subject of his cartoons, and Davenport replied, "Hanna is by no means out of the way. He will probably continue a good subject for some time." Hanna, having declined the position of <a href="Postmaster%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Postmaster General</a>, secured appointment to the <a href="US%20Senate">Senate</a> when McKinley made Ohio's aging senior senator, <a href="John%20Sherman">John Sherman</a>, his <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>. Until 1913, state legislatures, not the people, elected senators, and so Hanna had to seek election to a full term when the <a href="Ohio%20General%20Assembly">Ohio General Assembly</a> met in January 1898. Hanna campaigned in the 1897 legislative election, and was <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Ohio%2C%201898">elected to the Senate</a> in his own right the following January, in a very close vote. Davenport drew cartoons against Hanna in the senatorial race. Nevertheless, when he attended the legislature's meeting in Columbus, he wore a Hanna button, and seemed happy after Hanna's triumph. When asked why, he replied, "that insures me six more years at him, and he's a good subject".

The 1896 campaign made Davenport famous and well paid, earning $12,000 per year, the highest compensation of any cartoonist of his time. Hearst, who had lost a fortune but who had established the "Journal" as one of New York's most influential newspapers, also gave him a $3,000 bonus with which to take a trip to Europe with Daisy. In London, Davenport interviewed and drew the elderly former prime minister, <a href="William%20Gladstone">William Gladstone</a>. In Venice, he came upon a large statue of <a href="Samson">Samson</a>. He was impressed by the large muscles of the work, and immediately conceived of it as representing America's powerful <a href="trust%20%28monopoly%29">corporate trust</a>s, the status of which was then a major political issue. A large, powerful, grass-skirted figure representing the trusts would be seen with McKinley and Hanna in Davenport's cartoons during the President's re-election bid in 1900.

In 1897, Davenport was sent to <a href="Carson%20City%2C%20Nevada">Carson City, Nevada</a>, to cover the heavyweight championship fight between boxers <a href="Bob%20Fitzsimmons">Bob Fitzsimmons</a> and <a href="James%20J.%20Corbett">Jim Corbett</a>, a match heavily promoted by the "Journal". Fitzsimmons won. Davenport traveled to Nevada by way of Silverton, visiting there for the first time since becoming famous. The following year, Davenport went to <a href="Asbury%20Park%2C%20New%20Jersey">Asbury Park, New Jersey</a>, to watch Corbett in training. Davenport both interviewed him and made several drawings which the "Journal" published, including one of cartoonist and boxer sparring.

Davenport's drawings left few public figures unscathed; he even caricatured himself and his boss, Hearst. Ultimately, Davenport's work became so well recognized for skewering political figures he considered corrupt, that in 1897 his opponents attempted to pass a law banning political cartoons in New York. The bill, introduced in the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Legislature">state legislature</a> with the prodding of U.S. Senator <a href="Thomas%20C.%20Platt">Thomas C. Platt</a>, (R-NY), did not pass, but the effort inspired Davenport to create one of his most famous works: "No Honest Man Need Fear Cartoons."

In 1897 and into 1898, the Hearst papers pounded a drumbeat for war with Spain. Davenport drew cartoons depicting President McKinley as cowardly and unwilling to go to war because it might harm Wall Street. Once the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> was under way, one of the American war heroes was Admiral <a href="George%20Dewey">George Dewey</a>, victor at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Manila%20Bay">Battle of Manila Bay</a>, who was welcomed home in 1899 with celebrations and the gift of a house. The admiral promptly deeded the residence over to his newlywed wife, a Catholic, turning public opinion (especially among Protestants) against him. However, resentment eased after Davenport depicted Dewey on his bridge during the battle, with the caption, "Lest we forget".

In 1899, Davenport returned to Europe, covering the <a href="Dreyfus%20case">Dreyfus case</a> in Rennes. In 1900, <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201900">the presidential election</a> again featured McKinley defeating Bryan, and again featured Davenport, reprising his depictions of Hanna, this time aided by the giant figure of the trusts. Also a subject of Hearst's cartoonists was McKinley's running mate, war hero and New York Governor <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, presented as a child with a <a href="Rough%20Rider">Rough Rider</a>'s outfit and little self-control.

The "Journal" was renamed the "American" in 1901. Davenport continued there until 1904, eventually earning $25,000 per year, a very large salary at the time. Following Hearst's policy, he relentlessly attacked President Roosevelt, who had succeeded <a href="Assassination%20of%20William%20McKinley">the assassinated McKinley</a> in September 1901. Davenport both cartooned and wrote for the "American"; one column mockingly alleged that the new President had hidden all portraits of previous presidents in the White House basement, with the visitor left to view a large portrait of Roosevelt as well-armed Rough Rider.

Nevertheless, the Republicans wooed Davenport, seeking to deprive the Democrats of one of their weapons, and eventually President and cartoonist met. In 1904, Davenport left the "American" for the "<a href="New%20York%20Evening%20Mail">New York Evening Mail</a>", a Republican paper, to be paid $25,000 for the final six months of 1904 (most likely paid by the party's backers) and an undisclosed salary after that. The 1904 presidential campaign featured Roosevelt, seeking a full term in his own right, against the Democratic candidate, Judge <a href="Alton%20B.%20Parker">Alton B. Parker</a> of New York. Again Davenport affected the campaign, this time with a cartoon of <a href="Uncle%20Sam">Uncle Sam</a> with his hand on Roosevelt's shoulder, "He's good enough for me". The Republicans spent $200,000 reproducing it; the image was used as cover art on sheet music for marches written in support of Roosevelt.

Although Davenport continued at the "Evening Mail" after Roosevelt was elected, the quality of his work declined; fewer and fewer of his images were selected for inclusion in <a href="Albert%20Shaw%20%28journalist%29">Albert Shaw's</a> "<a href="Review%20of%20Reviews">Review of Reviews</a>". He also began to devote large periods to other activities; in 1905, he spent months in his home state of Oregon, first visiting Silverton and then showing, at Portland's <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Exposition">Lewis and Clark Exposition</a>, the animals he bred. 
In 1902, James Pond, a lecture circuit manager, hired Davenport as a speaker. Beginning in 1905, Davenport traveled on the <a href="Chatauqua">Chatauqua</a> lecture circuit, giving engaging talks, during which he sketched on stage. He sometimes appeared on the same program as Bryan, though on different days, and like him drew thousands of listeners. In 1906, he traveled to the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> to purchase Arabian horses from their native land, and then wrote a book in 1908 about his experiences. Davenport authored an autobiographical book, "The Diary of a Country Boy", in 1910, and collections of his cartoons, including "The Dollar or the Man" and "Cartoons by Davenport". Apparently as a joke, Davenport once included "The Belle "(or sometimes, "Bell" ) "of Silverton and Other Oregon Stories" in a list of his publications, and reference books for years listed it among his works. A book of that name did not exist, however. Some speculate that this was an early working title for "The Country Boy."

Davenport's marriage had failed by 1909, and he suffered a breakdown that year, related to his ongoing divorce case. As he recovered, he announced a forthcoming series to be available for license to newspapers, "Men I have sketched". This project was aborted when, in 1911, Davenport was invited by Hearst to return to the "American". He was on assignment for the "American" on April 19, 1912, when he met the <a href="RMS%20Carpathia">RMS "Carpathia"</a> at the docks in New York to draw the survivors of the <a href="RMS%20Titanic">RMS "Titanic"</a>. He drew three cartoons, but upon leaving his office was in a "highly nervous state". That evening he fell ill at the apartment of a friend, Mrs. William Cochran, a medium and <a href="Spiritualism">spiritualist</a>. Diagnosed with <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, he died in her home two weeks later, on May 2, 1912. Hearst paid for eight doctors to treat Davenport, and later for an elaborate funeral—the publisher had Davenport's body returned to his beloved Silverton for burial. His funeral was a <a href="Freethought%23United%20States">freethought</a> service conducted by a spiritualist, Jean Morris Ellis.

Addison Bennett of "The Oregonian" wrote, "Yes, Homer has come home for the last time, home to wander again never".

In addition to his cartooning, Davenport is remembered for playing a key role in bringing some of the earliest desertbred or "<a href="Al%20Khamsa">asil</a>" <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian horse</a>s to America. A longtime admirer of horses, Davenport stated in 1905, "I have dreamed of Arabian horses all my life." He had been captivated by the beauty of the Arabians brought to the Chicago Columbian Exposition in 1893. Upon learning that these horses had remained in America and had been sold at auction, he sought them out, finding most of the surviving animals in 1898 in the hands of millionaire fertilizer magnate Peter Bradley of <a href="Hingham%2C%20Massachusetts">Hingham</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. Davenport bought some Arabian horses outright between 1898 and 1905, paying $8,500 for one <a href="stallion">stallion</a>, but he later partnered with Bradley in the horse business. Among his purchases, he managed to gather all but one of the surviving horses that had been a part of the Chicago Exhibition.

In 1906, Davenport, with Bradley's financial backing, used his political connections, particularly those with President Theodore Roosevelt, to obtain the diplomatic permissions required to travel into the lands controlled by the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. Roosevelt himself was interested in breeding quality <a href="Light%20cavalry">cavalry</a> horses, had tried but failed to get Congress to fund a government cavalry <a href="stud%20farm">stud farm</a>, and considered Arabian blood useful for army horses. Davenport originally intended to travel alone, but was soon joined by two young associates anxious for an adventure in the Middle East: C.A. "Arthur" Moore, Jr., and John H. "Jack" Thompson, Jr. He traveled throughout what today is Syria and Lebanon, and successfully brought 27 horses to America.

To travel to the Middle East and purchase horses, Davenport needed to obtain diplomatic permission from the government of the Ottoman Empire, and specifically from Sultan <a href="Abdul%20Hamid%20II">Abdul Hamid II</a>. In December 1905, Davenport approached President Roosevelt for help, and in January 1906, Roosevelt provided him a letter of support that he was able to present to the Turkish Ambassador to the United States, <a href="Chikeb%20Bey">Chikeb Bey</a>, who contacted the Sultan. To the surprise of both Davenport and the Ambassador, the permit, called an "<a href="Hatt-i%20humayun">Iradé</a>", was granted, allowing the export of "six or eight" horses. Davenport and his traveling companions left the United States on July 5, 1906, traveling to France by ship and from there to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> by train. Upon arrival, the "Iradé" was authenticated, and clarified that Davenport would be allowed to export both mares and stallions. Davenport's accomplishment was notable for several reasons. It was the first time Arabian horses officially had been allowed to be exported from the Ottoman Empire in 35 years. It was also notable that Davenport not only was able to purchase <a href="stallion%20%28horse%29">stallions</a>, which were often available for sale to outsiders, but also <a href="mare%20%28horse%29">mares</a>, which were treasured by the Bedouin; the best war mares generally were not for sale at any price.

Before Davenport left Constantinople to travel to <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a> and then into the desert, he visited the royal stables, and also took advantage of an opportunity to view the Sultan during a public appearance. He displayed his artistic ability and talent for detail by sketching several portraits of Abdul Hamid II from memory about a half-hour after observing him, as Davenport believed the ruler unwilling to have his image drawn. Davenport's personal impression of the Sultan was sympathetic, viewing him as a frail, elderly man burdened by the weight of his office but kind and fatherly to his children. Davenport compared his appearance as a melding of the late congressman from Maine, <a href="Nelson%20Dingley">Nelson Dingley</a>, with merchant and philanthropist <a href="Nathan%20Straus">Nathan Straus</a>, commenting of the Sultan, "I thought ... that no matter what crimes had been charged to him, his expressionless soldiers, his army and its leaders were possibly more to blame than he." Believing that he needed to keep his sketches a secret, he carried the sketch book in a hidden pocket throughout his journey, and at customs smuggled it onto the steamer home hidden inside a bale of <a href="hay">hay</a>.

One reason for Davenport's success in obtaining high-quality, pure-blooded Arabian horses was his (possibly accidental) decision to breach protocol and visit Akmet Haffez, a Bedouin who served as a liaison between the Ottoman government and the tribal people of the <a href="Anazeh">Anazeh</a>, before calling upon the Governor of Syria, <a href="Nazim%20Pasha">Nazim Pasha</a>. Haffez considered the timing of Davenport's visit a great honor, and gave Davenport his finest mare, a war mare named *<a href="Wadduda">Wadduda</a>. Not to be outdone, the <a href="Pasha">Pasha</a> gave Davenport the stallion *<a href="Haleb%20%28horse%29">Haleb</a>, who was a well-respected sire throughout the region, known as the "Pride of the Desert." Haleb had been given to the Pasha as a reward for keeping the camel tax low. Haffez then personally escorted Davenport into the desert, and at one point in the journey the two men took an oath of brotherhood. Haffez helped arrange for the best-quality horses to be presented, negotiated fair prices, and verified that their pedigrees were "asil". Davenport chronicled this journey in his 1908 book, "My Quest of the Arabian Horse."

The impact of the 17 stallions and 10 mares purchased by Davenport was of major importance to the Arabian horse breed in America. While what are now called "Davenport" bloodlines can be found in thousands of Arabian horse pedigrees, there are also some <a href="preservation%20breeding">preservation breeders</a> whose horses have bloodlines that are entirely descended from the horses he imported. Davenport's efforts, as well as those of his successors, allowed the Arabian horse in America to be bred with authentic Arabian <a href="Glossary%20of%20equestrian%20terms%23T">type</a> and pure bloodlines.

Upon his return to America, his newly imported horses became part of his Davenport Desert Arabian Stud in Morris Plains, New Jersey. By 1908, however, the Davenport Desert Arabian Stud was listed in the Arabian Stud Book as located in Hingham, Massachusetts, and he remained closely affiliated with Bradley's Hingham Stock Farm, which became the sole owner of the horses after Davenport's death in 1912. In 1908, Davenport became one of the five incorporators of the Arabian Horse Club of America (now the <a href="Arabian%20Horse%20Association">Arabian Horse Association</a>). The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) recognized the organization as the official registry for Arabian horses in 1909. Prior to that time, the <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> stud books of both the United Kingdom and the United States also handled the <a href="breed%20registry">registration</a> of Arabian horses. The reason a new organization, separate from the American <a href="The%20Jockey%20Club">Jockey Club</a>, was needed to register Arabians came about largely because of Davenport. He had meticulously sought horses with pure bloodlines and known breeding strains with the expert assistance of Haffez, but once out of the desert, he was not aware that he also needed to obtain written affidavits and other paperwork to document their bloodlines. Additionally, because his Arabians were not shipped via Britain, they were not certified by the United Kingdom's <a href="Jockey%20Club">Jockey Club</a> before arriving in America, and without that authentication, the American Jockey Club refused to register his imported horses. Another factor may have influenced the organization's stance: in a cartoon, Davenport had satirized Jockey Club President <a href="August%20Belmont%2C%20Jr.">August Belmont</a>.

Haleb in particular became widely admired by American breeders, and in addition to siring Arabians, he was also <a href="crossbreed">crossed</a> with <a href="Morgan%20horse">Morgan</a> and <a href="Standardbred">Standardbred</a> mares. In 1907, Davenport entered the stallion into the <a href="Justin%20Morgan">Justin Morgan</a> Cup, a <a href="horse%20show">horse show</a> competition he won, defeating 19 Morgan horses. In 1909, Haleb died under mysterious circumstances. Davenport believed the horse had been poisoned. He had the stallion's skull and partial skeleton prepared and sent to the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>, where it became part of the museum's research collection. Davenport also purchased horses from the <a href="Crabbet%20Park%20Stud">Crabbet Park Stud</a> in England, notably the stallion *Abu Zeyd, considered the best son of his famous sire, <a href="Mesaoud">Mesaoud</a>. In 1911, Davenport described *Abu Zeyd as "the grandest specimen of the Arabian horse I have ever seen and I will give a $100 cup to the owner of any horse than can beat him."

Upon Davenport's death, a significant number of his horses were obtained by <a href="William%20Robinson%20Brown">W.R. Brown</a> and his brother Herbert, where they became the <a href="foundation%20bloodstock">foundation bloodstock</a> for Brown's Maynesboro Stud of <a href="Berlin%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Berlin, New Hampshire</a>. Included in the purchase was *Abu Zeyd. The Maynesboro stud also acquired 10 <a href="mare">mare</a>s from the Davenport estate.

Davenport married Daisy Moor of San Francisco, who traveled to Chicago while the artist was working there, and the couple wed on September 7, 1893. They had three children: Homer Clyde, born 1896; Mildred, born 1899; and Gloria Ward, born 1904. While living in a New York apartment between 1895 and 1901 not much is known of the Davenport home life except that the furnishings were luxurious. By 1901, Davenport had bought both a house in <a href="East%20Orange%2C%20New%20Jersey">East Orange, New Jersey</a>, and a farm in <a href="Morris%20Plains%2C%20New%20Jersey">Morris Plains, New Jersey</a>. He kept many of the animals he collected and bred, including pheasants and horses, at East Orange, but decided to move both animals and himself to Morris Plains, and take <a href="Morris%20%26amp%3B%20Essex%20Lines">the rail line dubbed the "Millionaire's Special"</a> to work in New York. He moved away from East Orange in 1906, though he still owned the house as late as 1909. In Morris Plains, the Davenports hosted large parties attended by celebrities, artists, writers, and other influential people of the day, including <a href="Ambrose%20Bierce">Ambrose Bierce</a>, <a href="Lillian%20Russell">Lillian Russell</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a>, William Jennings Bryan, <a href="Buffalo%20Bill%20Cody">Buffalo Bill Cody</a>, <a href="Frederick%20Remington">Frederick Remington</a>, and the <a href="Florodora%23Background">Florodora girls</a>. Instead of using a regular guestbook, Davenport would have his guests sign the clapboard siding of his home to commemorate their visits.

Davenport bred various animals. "I was born with a love of horses and for all animals that do not hurt anything ... I feel happiest when I am with these birds and animals," he said, "I am a part of them without anything to explain." His understanding of the dynamics of <a href="purebred">purebred</a> animal breeding was that deviation from the original, useful type led to degeneration of a breed. While best known as a horse breeder, he also raised pheasants—including exotic varieties from the Himalayas—and other breeds of birds. By 1905 he started a pheasant farm on his property in Morris Plains, gathering the birds he had kept on the west coast, and buying others from overseas using the profits from his first published book of cartoons. As of 1908 he owned the largest private collection of pheasants and wild waterfowl in America. At various times, his menagerie also contained <a href="angora%20goat">angora goat</a>s, Persian <a href="fat-tailed%20sheep">fat-tailed sheep</a>, Sicilian donkeys, and Chinese ducks. Three times, he built up collections of <a href="cockfighting">cockfighting</a> roosters, once selling them to finance his start the first time he lived and worked in San Francisco.

In addition to his interest in horses and birds, Davenport was also fond of dogs, notably a <a href="bull%20terrier">bull terrier</a> named Duff, obtained as a puppy. Davenport taught Duff to do tricks and profited by loaning the dog to perform in <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> acts. In 1908, Davenport involved himself in a controversy over the breeding of show-quality dogs, stating that he thought breeding solely for show purposes was creating an animal that was of inferior quality. He targeted certain popular breeders of purebred <a href="collie">collie</a>s as producing animals that had less intelligence, were of poor temperament, and lacked utility. He pointedly named famous breeders whom he felt were making particularly poor decisions.

The Davenport marriage did not last; Daisy did not share many of her husband's interests and intensely disliked Silverton. In 1909 they separated, and the parting was acrimonious. Homer initially returned to New York to live, but soon suffered a breakdown; he spent months recuperating in a resort hotel in <a href="San%20Diego%2C%20California">San Diego, California</a>, at the expense of his friend, sporting goods mogul <a href="Albert%20Spalding">Albert Spalding</a>. Though he deeded his two properties over to Daisy, she sued for alimony, and had Homer held in contempt by a New York court for failure to pay support when he was not working. He returned to New York and obtained a new stock farm at <a href="Holmdel%2C%20New%20Jersey">Holmdel, New Jersey</a>, in 1910. Though his father died in 1911, he began to pull his life together and returned to cartooning. He met a new companion, referred to in his papers only as "Zadah", whom he intended to marry once his divorce case was concluded. However, he died before his scheduled August 1912 trial date.

Davenport's cartoons have had a lasting impact on the public image of Mark Hanna, both on how he was perceived at the time and on how he is remembered today. Early Hanna biographer <a href="Herbert%20Croly">Herbert Croly</a>, writing in 1912, the year Davenport died, deemed his subject portrayed as a "monster" by the "powerful but brutal caricatures of Homer Davenport". According to Horner, the portrayal of Hanna that has stood the test of time is one that depicts him "side by side with a gigantic figure representing the trusts, and a tiny, childlike, William McKinley. He will forever be known as "Dollar Mark", thanks to Homer Davenport and many other columnists who drew him as a malevolent presence. McKinley biographer Margaret Leech regretted Davenport's effect on the former president's image: "the representation of McKinley as pitiable and victimized was a poor service to his reputation. The graphic impression of his spineless subservience to Hanna would long outlive the lies of ["Journal" columnist] Alfred Henry Lewis."

According to Davenport's biographers, Leland Huot and Alfred Powers, his Arabian horses "were to perpetuate his fame on and on into future years more than his political cartoons, so that in ten thousand stables today he is known as having been a great, great man". Today, the term "CMK", meaning "Crabbet/Maynesboro/Kellogg", is a label for specific lines of "Domestic" or "American-bred" Arabian horses. It describes the descendants of horses imported to America from the desert or from Crabbet Park Stud in the late 1800s and early 1900s then bred on in the US by the Hamidie Society, Randolph Huntington, Spencer Borden, Davenport, W.R. Brown's Maynesboro Stud, <a href="Will%20Keith%20Kellogg">W. K. Kellogg</a>, Hearst's <a href="Hearst%20Ranch">San Simeon</a> Stud, and "General" J. M. Dickinson's Traveler's Rest Stud.

Silverton, Oregon, gives tribute to Davenport during its annual Homer Davenport Community Festival, held annually in August. The festival began in 1980.

In addition to his newspaper cartoons and postcards, Davenport wrote or provided illustrations for the following books:

Millennium Park

Millennium Park is a public <a href="park">park</a> located in the <a href="Chicago%20Loop">Loop</a> <a href="Community%20areas%20of%20Chicago">community area</a> of <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> in Illinois operated by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and managed by MB Real Estate. The park was originally intended to celebrate the <a href="third%20millennium">third millennium</a> and is a prominent <a href="civic%20center">civic center</a> near the city's <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> shoreline that covers a section of northwestern <a href="Grant%20Park%20%28Chicago%29">Grant Park</a>. The area was previously occupied by parkland, <a href="Illinois%20Central">Illinois Central</a> rail yards, and parking lots. The park, which is bounded by <a href="Michigan%20Avenue%20%28Chicago%29">Michigan Avenue</a>, <a href="Randolph%20Street">Randolph Street</a>, <a href="Columbus%20Drive%20%28Chicago%29">Columbus Drive</a> and East Monroe Drive, features a variety of <a href="public%20art">public art</a>. As of 2009, Millennium Park trailed only <a href="Navy%20Pier">Navy Pier</a> as a Chicago tourist attraction and by 2017 it had become the number one tourist attraction in the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwestern United States</a>. In 2015, the park became the location of the city's annual <a href="Christmas%20tree">Christmas tree</a> lighting.

Planning of the park began in October 1997. Construction began in October 1998, and Millennium Park was opened in a ceremony on July 16, 2004, four years behind schedule. The three-day opening celebrations were attended by some 300,000 people and included an inaugural concert by the <a href="Grant%20Park%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Grant Park Orchestra</a> and Chorus. The park has received awards for its <a href="accessibility">accessibility</a> and green design. Millennium Park has free admission, and features the <a href="Jay%20Pritzker%20Pavilion">Jay Pritzker Pavilion</a>, "<a href="Cloud%20Gate">Cloud Gate</a>", the "<a href="Crown%20Fountain">Crown Fountain</a>", the <a href="Lurie%20Garden">Lurie Garden</a>, and various other attractions. The park is connected by the <a href="BP%20Pedestrian%20Bridge">BP Pedestrian Bridge</a> and the <a href="Nichols%20Bridgeway">Nichols Bridgeway</a> to other parts of Grant Park. Because the park sits atop a parking garage and the commuter rail <a href="Millennium%20Station">Millennium Station</a>, it is considered the world's largest <a href="rooftop%20garden">rooftop garden</a>.

Some observers consider Millennium Park the city's most important project since the <a href="World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition">World's Columbian Exposition</a> of 1893. It far exceeded its originally proposed budget of $150 million. The final cost of $475 million was borne by Chicago taxpayers and private donors. The city paid $270 million; private donors paid the rest, and assumed roughly half of the financial responsibility for the <a href="cost%20overrun">cost overrun</a>s. The construction delays and cost overruns were attributed to poor planning, many design changes, and <a href="cronyism">cronyism</a>. Many critics have praised the completed park.

In 2017, Millennium Park was the top tourist destination in <a href="Tourism%20in%20Chicago">Chicago</a> and the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwest</a>, and placed among the top ten in the <a href="Tourism%20in%20the%20United%20States">United States</a> with 25 million annual visitors.

From 1852 until 1997, the <a href="Illinois%20Central%20Railroad">Illinois Central Railroad</a> owned a right of way between downtown Chicago and <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a>, in the area that became <a href="Grant%20Park%20%28Chicago%29">Grant Park</a> and used it for railroad tracks. In 1871, <a href="Union%20Base-Ball%20Grounds">Union Base-Ball Grounds</a> was built on part of the site that became Millennium Park; the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Stockings%20%281870%E2%80%9389%29">Chicago White Stockings</a> played home games there until the grounds were destroyed in the <a href="Great%20Chicago%20Fire">Great Chicago Fire</a>. Lake Front Park, the White Stockings' new ball grounds, was built in 1878 with a short <a href="right%20field">right field</a> due to the railroad tracks. The grounds were improved and the seating capacity was doubled in 1883, but the team had to move after the season ended the next year, as the federal government had given the city the land "with the stipulation that no commercial venture could use it". <a href="Daniel%20Burnham">Daniel Burnham</a> planned Grant Park around the Illinois Central Railroad property in his <a href="1909%20Plan%20of%20Chicago">1909 Plan of Chicago</a>. In 1997, when the city gained <a href="Air%20rights">airspace rights</a> over the tracks, it decided to build a parking facility over them in the northwestern corner of Grant Park. Eventually, the city realized that a grand civic amenity might lure private dollars in a way that a municipal improvement would not, and thus began the effort to create Millennium Park. The park was originally planned under the name Lakefront Millennium Park.

The park was conceived as a landscape-covered bridge over an underground parking structure to be built on top of the <a href="Metra">Metra</a>/Illinois Central Railroad tracks in Grant Park. Originally, the park was to be designed by <a href="Skidmore%2C%20Owings%20%26amp%3B%20Merrill">Skidmore, Owings & Merrill</a>, but gradually additional architects and artists such as <a href="Frank%20Gehry">Frank Gehry</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Beeby">Thomas Beeby</a> were incorporated into the plan. Sponsors were sought by invitation only.
In February 1999, the city announced it was negotiating with Frank Gehry to design a <a href="proscenium">proscenium</a> arch and orchestra enclosure for a bandshell, as well as a pedestrian bridge crossing Columbus Drive, and that it was seeking donors to cover his work. At the time, the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" dubbed Gehry "the hottest architect in the universe" in reference to the acclaim for his <a href="Guggenheim%20Museum%20Bilbao">Guggenheim Museum Bilbao</a>, and they noted the designs would not include Mayor <a href="Richard%20M.%20Daley">Richard M. Daley</a>'s trademarks, such as <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a> and seasonal flower boxes. Millennium Park project manager Edward Uhlir said "Frank is just the cutting edge of the next century of architecture," and noted that no other architect was being sought. Gehry was approached several times by Skidmore architect <a href="Adrian%20Smith%20%28architect%29">Adrian Smith</a> on behalf of the city. His hesitance and refusal to accept the commission was overcome by Cindy Pritzker, the philanthropist, who had developed a relationship with the architect when he won the <a href="Pritzker%20Prize">Pritzker Prize</a> in 1989. According to <a href="John%20H.%20Bryan">John H. Bryan</a>, who led fund-raising for the park, Pritzker enticed Gehry in face-to-face discussions, using a $15 million funding commitment toward the bandshell's creation. Having Gehry get involved helped the city realize its vision of having modern themes in the park; upon rumors of his involvement the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" proclaimed "Perhaps the future has arrived", while the "Chicago Tribune" noted that "The most celebrated architect in the world may soon have a chance to bring Chicago into the 21st Century".
Plans for the park were officially announced in March 1998 and construction began in September of that year. Initial construction was under the auspices of the <a href="Chicago%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Chicago Department of Transportation</a>, because the project bridges the railroad tracks. However, as the project grew and expanded, its broad variety of features and amenities outside the scope of the field of transportation placed it under the jurisdiction of the city's Public Buildings Commission.

In April 1999, the city announced that the <a href="Pritzker%20family">Pritzker family</a> had donated $15 million to fund Gehry's bandshell and an additional nine donors committed $10 million. The day of this announcement, Gehry agreed to the design request. In November, when his design was unveiled, Gehry said the bridge design was preliminary and not well-conceived because funding for it was not committed. The need to fund a bridge to span the eight-lane Columbus Drive was evident, but some planning for the park was delayed in anticipation of details on the redesign of <a href="Soldier%20Field">Soldier Field</a>. In January 2000, the city announced plans to expand the park to include features that became "Cloud Gate", the "Crown Fountain", the <a href="McDonald%27s%20Cycle%20Center">McDonald's Cycle Center</a>, and the BP Pedestrian Bridge. Later that month, Gehry unveiled his new winding design for the bridge.

Mayor Daley's influence was key in getting corporate and individual sponsors to pay for much of the park. Bryan, the former <a href="chief%20executive%20officer">chief executive officer</a> (CEO) of <a href="Sara%20Lee%20Corporation">Sara Lee Corporation</a> who spearheaded the fundraising, says that sponsorship was by invitation and no one refused the opportunity to be a sponsor. One "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine writer describes the park as the crowning achievement for Mayor Daley, while another suggests the park's cost and time overages were examples of the city's mismanagement. The July 16–18, 2004, opening ceremony was sponsored by <a href="J.P.%20Morgan%20Chase%20%26amp%3B%20Co">J.P. Morgan Chase & Co</a>.

The community surrounding Millennium Park has become one of the most fashionable residential addresses in Chicago. In 2006, Forbes named the park's 60602 <a href="zip%20code">zip code</a> as the hottest in terms of price appreciation in the country, with upscale buildings such as <a href="The%20Heritage%20at%20Millennium%20Park">The Heritage at Millennium Park</a> (130 N. Garland) leading the way for other buildings, such as <a href="Waterview%20Tower">Waterview Tower</a>, <a href="The%20Legacy%20at%20Millennium%20Park">The Legacy</a> and <a href="Joffrey%20Tower">Joffrey Tower</a>. The median sale price for residential real estate was $710,000 in 2005 according to Forbes, also ranking it on the list of most expensive zip codes. The park has been credited with increasing residential real estate values by $100 per square foot ($1,076 per m).

Millennium Park is a portion of the Grant Park, known as the "front lawn" of downtown Chicago, and has four major artistic highlights: the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, "Cloud Gate", the "Crown Fountain", and the Lurie Garden. Millennium Park is successful as a public art venue in part due to the grand scale of each piece and the open spaces for display. A showcase for <a href="postmodern%20architecture">postmodern architecture</a>, it also features the <a href="McCormick%20Tribune%20Ice%20Skating%20Rink">McCormick Tribune Ice Skating Rink</a>, the BP Pedestrian Bridge, the <a href="Harris%20Theater%20%28Chicago%29">Joan W. and Irving B. Harris Theater for Music and Dance</a>, <a href="Wrigley%20Square">Wrigley Square</a>, the <a href="McDonald%27s%20Cycle%20Center">McDonald's Cycle Center</a>, the <a href="Exelon%20Pavilions">Exelon Pavilions</a>, the <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Plaza">AT&T Plaza</a>, the <a href="Boeing%20Galleries">Boeing Galleries</a>, the <a href="Chase%20Promenade">Chase Promenade</a>, and the <a href="Nichols%20Bridgeway">Nichols Bridgeway</a>.

Millennium Park is considered one of the largest <a href="green%20roof">green roof</a>s in the world, having been constructed on top of a railroad yard and large parking garages. The park, which is known for being user friendly, has a very rigorous cleaning schedule with many areas being swept, wiped down or cleaned multiple times a day. Although the park was unveiled in July 2004, some features opened earlier, and upgrades continued for some time afterwards. Along with the cultural features above ground (described below) the park has its own 2218-space parking garage.

The centerpiece of Millennium Park is the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, a <a href="bandshell">bandshell</a> designed by Frank Gehry. The pavilion has 4,000 fixed seats, plus additional lawn seating for 7,000; the stage is framed by curving plates of stainless steel, characteristic of Gehry. It was named after <a href="Jay%20Pritzker">Jay Pritzker</a>, whose family is known for owning <a href="Hyatt%20Hotels">Hyatt Hotels</a> and was a major donor. The Pritzker Pavilion is Grant Park's outdoor performing arts venue for small events, and complements <a href="Petrillo%20Music%20Shell">Petrillo Music Shell</a>, the park's older and larger bandshell. The pavilion is built partially atop the Harris Theater for Music and Dance, the park's indoor performing arts venue, with which it shares a loading dock and backstage facilities. The pavilion is seen as a major upgrade from the Petrillo Music Shell for those events it hosts. Initially, the pavilion's lawn seats were free for all concerts, but this changed when <a href="Tori%20Amos">Tori Amos</a> performed the first rock concert there on August 31, 2005.

The Pritzker Pavilion is the home of the Grant Park Symphony Orchestra and Chorus and the <a href="Grant%20Park%20Music%20Festival">Grant Park Music Festival</a>, the nation's only remaining free, municipally supported, outdoor, classical music series. The Festival is presented by the <a href="Chicago%20Park%20District">Chicago Park District</a> and the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs. The Pavilion hosts a wide range of other music series and annual performing arts events. Performers ranging from mainstream rock bands to classical musicians and opera singers have appeared at the pavilion, which also hosts physical fitness activities such as yoga. All rehearsals at the pavilion are open to the public; trained guides are available for the music festival rehearsals, which are well-attended.

The construction of the pavilion created a legal controversy, given that there are historic limitations on the height of buildings in Grant Park. To avoid these legal restrictions, the city classifies the bandshell as a work of art rather than a building. With several design and assembly problems, the construction plans were revised over time, with features eliminated and others added as successful fundraising allowed the budget to grow. In the end, the performance venue was designed with a large fixed seating area, a Great Lawn, a <a href="Trellis%20%28architecture%29">trellis</a> network to support the sound system, and a headdress fashioned from signature Gehry stainless steel. It features a sound system with an acoustic design that replicates an indoor concert hall sound experience. The pavilion and Millennium Park have received favorable recognition by critics, especially for their accessibility; an accessibility award ceremony held at the pavilion in 2005 described it as "one of the most accessible parks—not just in the United States but possibly the world".

The AT&T Plaza is a public space that hosts the "<a href="Cloud%20Gate">Cloud Gate</a>" sculpture. The plaza opened in July 2004 with the unveiling of the sculpture during the grand opening weekend of the park. <a href="Ameritech">Ameritech</a> donated $3 million for the naming right for the plaza, but it was SBC Plaza when the park opened, as a merger had changed the company name to <a href="SBC%20Communications">SBC Communications</a>. The 2005 merger of SBC and <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Corporation">AT&T Corporation</a> led to the present name. The sculpture and the AT&T Plaza are located on top of <a href="Park%20Grill">Park Grill</a>, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. The plaza has become a place to view the McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. During the holiday season, the plaza hosts Christmas caroling.

"Cloud Gate", dubbed "The Bean" by Chicagoans because of its legume-like shape, is a three-story reflective steel sculpture. The first public artwork in the United States by world-renowned artist <a href="Anish%20Kapoor">Anish Kapoor</a>, the privately funded piece cost $23 million, considerably more than the original estimate of $6 million. Composed of 168 stainless steel plates welded together, its highly polished exterior has no visible seams. It is and weighs . Its smooth shape and mirror-like surface were inspired by liquid mercury. It reflects the city skyline, particularly the <a href="Historic%20Michigan%20Boulevard%20District">historic Michigan Avenue "streetwall"</a>, and the sky. It provides striking reflections of visitors, who can walk around and under its high arch. On the underside is the "omphalos" (Greek for "navel"), a concave chamber that warps and multiplies reflections. The sculpture builds upon many of Kapoor's artistic themes, and is a popular photo subject with tourists.

After Kapoor's design for the sculpture was selected in a design competition, numerous technological concerns regarding its construction and assembly arose, in addition to concerns about the sculpture's upkeep and maintenance. Experts were consulted, some of whom believed the design could not be implemented. Eventually, a feasible method was found, but the sculpture's construction fell behind schedule. "Cloud Gate" was unveiled in an incomplete form during the Millennium Park grand opening celebration, as the grid of welds around each metal panel was still visible. The sculpture was concealed again while it was completed; in early 2005, workers polished out the seams. "Cloud Gate" was formally dedicated on May 15, 2006, and it has since gained considerable popularity, domestically and internationally.

The "Crown Fountain" is an interactive work of public art and <a href="video%20sculpture">video sculpture</a>, named in honor of Chicago's <a href="Lester%20Crown">Crown family</a> and opened in July 2004. It was designed by <a href="Catalan%20people">Catalan</a> conceptual artist <a href="Jaume%20Plensa">Jaume Plensa</a> and executed by <a href="Krueck%20and%20Sexton%20Architects">Krueck and Sexton Architects</a>. The fountain is composed of a black granite reflecting pool placed between a pair of transparent <a href="glass%20brick">glass brick</a> towers. The towers are tall, and use <a href="light-emitting%20diode">light-emitting diode</a>s behind the bricks to display digital videos on their inward faces. Construction and design of the "Crown Fountain" cost $17 million.

Weather permitting, the water operates from May to October, intermittently cascading down the two towers and spouting through a nozzle on each tower's front face. To achieve the effect in which water appears to be flowing from subjects' mouths, each video has a segment where the subject's lips are puckered, which is then timed to correspond to the spouting water, reminiscent of <a href="gargoyle">gargoyle</a> fountains; this happens roughly every five minutes. The park and fountain are open to the public daily from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.

Residents and critics have praised the fountain for its artistic and entertainment features. It highlights Plensa's themes of dualism, light, and water, extending the use of video technology from his prior works. The fountain promotes physical interaction between the public and the water in an artistic setting. Both the fountain and Millennium Park are highly accessible because of their universal design.

The "Crown Fountain" has been the most controversial of all the Millennium Park features. Before it was built, some were concerned that the sculpture's height violated the aesthetic tradition of the park. After construction, surveillance cameras were installed atop the fountain, which led to a public outcry (and their quick removal). However, the fountain has survived its somewhat contentious beginnings to find its way into Chicago pop culture. It is a popular subject for photographers and a common gathering place. While some of the videos displayed are of scenery, most attention has focused on its video clips of local residents, in which almost a thousand Chicagoans randomly appear on two screens. The fountain is a public play area and offers people an escape from summer heat, allowing children to frolic in the fountain's water.

The Lurie Garden is a public garden located at the southern end of Millennium Park; designed by <a href="landscape%20architecture">landscape architecture</a> firm GGN (<a href="Kathryn%20Gustafson">Gustafson</a> Guthrie Nichol), <a href="Piet%20Oudolf">Piet Oudolf</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Israel%20%28garden%20designer%29">Robert Israel</a>, it opened on July 16, 2004. The garden is a combination of perennials, bulbs, grasses, shrubs and trees. It is the featured nature component of the world's largest <a href="green%20roof">green roof</a>. The garden cost $13.2 million and has a $10 million <a href="financial%20endowment">financial endowment</a> for maintenance and upkeep. It was named after philanthropist Ann Lurie, who donated the $10 million endowment. The garden is a tribute to the city, whose motto is ""Urbs in Horto"", Latin for "City in a Garden". The Lurie Garden is composed of two "plates". The dark plate depicts Chicago's history by presenting shade-loving plants, and has a combination of trees that will provide a shade <a href="canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> for these plants when they fill in. The light plate, which has no trees, represents the city's future with sun-loving perennials that thrive in heat and light.

The McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink is a multipurpose venue located along the western edge of Millennium Park opposite the streetwall of the <a href="Historic%20Michigan%20Boulevard%20District">Historic Michigan Boulevard District</a>. On December 20, 2001, it became the first attraction in Millennium Park to open, a few weeks ahead of the Millennium Park underground parking garage. The $3.2 million plaza was funded by a donation from the McCormick Tribune Foundation. For four months a year, it operates as McCormick Tribune Ice Rink, a free public outdoor <a href="ice%20skating%20rink">ice skating rink</a>. It is generally open for skating from mid-November until mid-March and hosts over 100,000 skaters annually. It is known as one of Chicago's better outdoor <a href="people%20watching">people watching</a> locations during the winter months. The rink is operated by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs rather than the <a href="Chicago%20Park%20District">Chicago Park District</a>, which operates most major public ice skating rinks in Chicago.

For the rest of the year, it serves as The Plaza at Park Grill or Park Grill Plaza, Chicago's largest <a href="al%20fresco%20dining">al fresco dining</a> facility. The 150-seat outdoor restaurant offers scenic views of the park, and hosts various culinary events and musical performances during its months of operation. From June 21 to September 15, 2002, the plaza served as an open-air exhibition space and hosted the inaugural exhibit in Millennium Park, "<a href="Exelon">Exelon</a> Presents Earth From Above" by <a href="Yann%20Arthus-Bertrand">Yann Arthus-Bertrand</a>, a French <a href="aerial%20photography">aerial photographer</a>.

The Park Grill Plaza is affiliated with the 300-seat indoor <a href="Park%20Grill">Park Grill</a> restaurant, located beneath the AT&T Plaza and "Cloud Gate". The Park Grill is the only full-service restaurant in Millennium Park and opened on November 24, 2003. It regularly places among the leaders in citywide best-of competitions for best burger, and it is widely praised for its views. The restaurant has been the focus of controversies about the numerous associates of Mayor Daley who are investors, its exclusive location and lucrative contract terms. One of the most financially successful restaurants in Chicago, the Park Grill remains exempt from <a href="property%20taxes">property taxes</a> after a multi-year litigation which reached the <a href="appellate%20courts">appellate courts</a> in Illinois.

The BP Pedestrian Bridge is a <a href="girder%20bridge">girder</a> <a href="footbridge">footbridge</a> over Columbus Drive that connects Millennium Park with <a href="Maggie%20Daley%20Park">Maggie Daley Park</a> (formerly, Daley Bicentennial Plaza), both parts of the larger Grant Park. The pedestrian bridge is the first bridge Gehry designed to be built, and was named for <a href="BP">BP plc</a>, which donated $5 million to the construction of the park. It opened on July 16, 2004, along with the rest of Millennium Park. Gehry had been courted by the city to design the bridge and the neighboring Jay Pritzker Pavilion, and eventually agreed to do so after the <a href="Pritzker%20family">Pritzker family</a> funded the Pavilion. The bridge is known for its aesthetics, and Gehry's style is seen in its <a href="Biomorphism">biomorphic</a> allusions and extensive sculptural use of stainless steel plates to express abstraction. The bridge is referred to as snakelike in character due to its curving form. The bridge's design, which meets highway standards to accommodate rushes of pedestrian traffic simultaneously exiting Pritzker Pavilion events, enables it to bear a heavy load.

The pedestrian bridge serves as a <a href="noise%20barrier">noise barrier</a> for the pavilion, blocking traffic sounds from Columbus Drive. It is a connecting link between Millennium Park and destinations to the east, such as the nearby lakefront, other parts of Grant Park and a parking garage. The BP Bridge uses a concealed <a href="box%20girder">box girder</a> design with a concrete base, and its deck is covered by hardwood floor boards. It is designed without handrails, using stainless steel <a href="parapet">parapet</a>s instead. The total length is , with a five percent slope on its inclined surfaces that makes it <a href="barrier-free">barrier-free</a> and accessible. It has won awards for its use of sheet metal. Although the bridge is closed in winter because ice cannot be safely removed from its wooden walkway, it has received favorable reviews for its design and aesthetics.

The Joan W. and Irving B. Harris Theater for Music and Dance is a 1525-seat theater for the performing arts located along the northern edge of Millennium Park. Constructed in 2002–03, it is the city's premier performance venue for small- and medium-sized performance groups, which had previously been without a permanent home and were underserved by the city's performing venue options. The theater, which is largely underground due to Grant Park-related height restrictions, was named for its primary benefactors, Joan and <a href="Irving%20Harris">Irving Harris</a>.
It serves as the park's indoor performing venue, a compliment to Jay Pritzker Pavilion, which hosts the park's outdoor performances. Among the regularly featured local groups are the <a href="Joffrey%20Ballet">Joffrey Ballet</a>, <a href="Hubbard%20Street%20Dance%20Chicago">Hubbard Street Dance Chicago</a> and <a href="Chicago%20Opera%20Theater">Chicago Opera Theater</a>. It provides subsidized rental, technical expertise, and marketing support for the companies using it, and turned a profit in its fourth fiscal year.

The Harris Theater has hosted notable national and international performers, such as the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Ballet">New York City Ballet</a>, which made its first visit to Chicago in over 25 years (in 2006). The theater began offering subscription series of traveling performers in its 2008–09 fifth anniversary season. Performances through this series have included the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Ballet">San Francisco Ballet</a>, <a href="Mikhail%20Baryshnikov">Mikhail Baryshnikov</a>, and <a href="Stephen%20Sondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a>.

The theater has been credited as contributing to the performing arts renaissance in Chicago, and it has been favorably reviewed for its <a href="acoustics">acoustics</a>, <a href="sightline">sightline</a>s, <a href="proscenium">proscenium</a> and for providing a home base for numerous performing organizations. Although it is seen as a high-caliber venue for its music audiences, the theater is regarded as less than ideal for jazz groups, because it is more expensive and larger than most places where jazz is performed. The design has been criticized for traffic flow problems, with an elevator bottleneck. However, the theater's prominent location and its underground design to preserve Millennium Park have been praised. Although there were complaints about high-priced events in its early years, discounted ticket programs were introduced in the 2009–10 season.

Wrigley Square is a public square located in the northwest corner of Millennium Park near the intersection of East <a href="Randolph%20Street%20%28Chicago%29">Randolph Street</a> and North <a href="Michigan%20Avenue%20%28Chicago%29">Michigan</a>, across from the <a href="Historic%20Michigan%20Boulevard%20District">Historic Michigan Boulevard District</a>. It contains the Millennium Monument, a nearly full-sized replica of the semicircle of paired Greek <a href="Doric%20order">Doric</a>-style columns (called a <a href="peristyle">peristyle</a>) that originally sat in this area of Grant Park between 1917 and 1953. The square also contains a large lawn and a public fountain. The <a href="Wrigley%20Company">William Wrigley, Jr. Foundation</a> contributed $5 million for the monument and square, which was named in its honor. The pedestal of the Millennium Monument's peristyle is inscribed with the names of the 115 financial donors who made the 91 contributions of at least $1 million each to help pay for Millennium Park.

The McDonald's Cycle Center is a 300-space heated and air conditioned indoor <a href="bike%20station">bike station</a> located in the northeast corner of Millennium Park. The facility provides lockers, showers, a snack bar with outdoor summer seating, bike repair, bike rental and other amenities for downtown <a href="bicycle%20commuting">bicycle commuters</a> and <a href="utility%20cycling">utility cyclists</a>. The bike station also accommodates runners and <a href="in-line%20skating">in-line skaters</a>, and provides space for a <a href="Chicago%20Police%20Department">Chicago Police Department</a> Bike Patrol Group. The city-built center opened in July 2004 as the Millennium Park Bike Station; since June 2006, it has been sponsored by <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a> and several other partners, including city departments and bicycle advocacy organizations. Suburban Chicago-based McDonald's sponsorship of the Cycle Center fit in well with its efforts to help its customers become more healthy by encouraging "balanced, active lifestyles". The Cycle Center is accessible by membership and day pass.

Planning for the Cycle Center was part of the larger "Bike 2010 Plan", in which the city aimed to make itself more accommodating to bicycle commuters. This plan (since replaced by the "Bike 2015 Plan") included provisions for front-mounted two-bike carriers on <a href="Chicago%20Transit%20Authority">Chicago Transit Authority</a> (CTA) buses, permitting bikes to be carried on <a href="Chicago%20%27L%27">Chicago 'L'</a> trains, installing numerous bike racks and creating bicycle lanes in streets throughout the city. Additionally, the <a href="Chicago%20metropolitan%20area">Chicago metropolitan area</a>'s other mass transit providers, Metra and <a href="Pace%20%28transit%29">Pace</a>, have developed increased bike accessibility. Mayor Daley was an advocate of the plan, noting it is also an environmentally friendly effort to cut down on traffic. Environmentalists, <a href="urban%20planner">urban planner</a>s and cycling enthusiasts around the world have expressed interest in the Cycle Center, and want to emulate what they see as a success story in urban planning and transit-oriented development. Pro-cycling and environmentalist journalists in publications well beyond Chicago have described the Cycle Center as exemplary, impressive, unique and ground-breaking. The "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" notes that it is revered as "a kind of <a href="Shangri-La">Shangri-La</a>", and describes it as "a jewel-like glass building on the Chicago waterfront, <nowiki>[that]</nowiki> has many of the amenities of an upscale health club ... close to the heart of the city", with the additional statement that "It's not heaven, but it's close". A Vancouver official told "<a href="The%20Oregonian">The Oregonian</a>" that it was "the ultimate in bicycle stations", and would be natural for bicycle friendly cities to emulate.

The Exelon Pavilions are a set of four <a href="solar%20energy">solar energy</a>-generating structures in Millennium Park. The pavilions provide sufficient energy to power the equivalent of 14 <a href="Energy%20star">Energy star</a>-rated energy-efficient houses in Chicago. The pavilions were designed in January 2001 and construction began in January 2004. The Southeast and Southwest Exelon Pavilions (jointly the South Exelon Pavilions) along Madison Street were completed and opened in July 2004, and flank the Lurie Garden. The Northeast and Northwest Exelon Pavilions (jointly the North Exelon Pavilions) flank the Harris Theater along Randolph Street and were completed in November 2004, with a grand opening on April 30, 2005. Besides producing energy, three of the four pavilions provide access to the park's underground parking garages and the fourth serves as the park's welcome center. <a href="Exelon">Exelon</a>, a company that generates the electricity transmitted by its subsidiary <a href="Commonwealth%20Edison">Commonwealth Edison</a>, donated approximately $6 million for the pavilions.

The Boeing Galleries are a pair of outdoor exhibition spaces within Millennium Park; they are located along the south and north mid-level terraces, above and east of Wrigley Square and the "Crown Fountain". They were added after the park opened; in March 2005, <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> President and <a href="Chief%20executive%20officer">Chief Executive Officer</a> <a href="James%20A.%20Bell">James Bell</a> announced the firm would make a $5 million grant to fund construction of the spaces, and for an endowment to "help fund visual arts exhibitions" in them. The galleries, which were built between March and June 2005, have hosted grand-scale art exhibits, some of which have run for two full summers.

The Chase Promenade is an open-air tree-lined pedestrian walkway in Millennium Park that opened July 16, 2004. The promenade was made possible by a gift from the <a href="Bank%20One%20Corporation">Bank One Foundation</a>; Bank One merged with <a href="JPMorgan%20Chase">JPMorgan Chase</a> in 2004, and the name became Chase Promenade. The walkway accommodates exhibitions, festivals and other family events. It also serves as a private-event rental venue. The Chase Promenade hosted the 2009 <a href="Burnham%20Pavilions">Burnham Pavilions</a>, which were the cornerstone of the citywide <a href="Burnham%20Plan">Burnham Plan</a> centennial celebration.

The Nichols Bridgeway, a pedestrian bridge that opened on May 16, 2009, connects the south end of Millennium Park with the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago%20Building%23Modern%20Wing">Modern Wing</a> of the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">Art Institute of Chicago</a>. The bridge begins at the southwest end of the Jay Pritzker Pavilion's Great Lawn and extends across Monroe Street, where it connects to the third floor of the Art Institute's West Pavilion. The bridge design by <a href="Renzo%20Piano">Renzo Piano</a>, the architect of the Modern Wing, was inspired by the <a href="Hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> of a boat.

The Nichols Bridgeway is approximately long and wide. The bottom of the bridge is made of white, painted structural steel, the floor is made of aluminum planking and the tall railings are steel set atop stainless steel mesh. The bridge features anti-slip walkways and heating elements to prevent the formation of ice. It meets standards for universal accessibility, as required by the <a href="Americans%20with%20Disabilities%20Act%20of%201990">Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990</a> (ADA). The bridge is named after museum donors Alexandra and John Nichols.
During development and construction of the park, many structures were added, redesigned or modified. These changes often resulted in budget increases. For example, the bandshell's proposed budget was $10.8 million. When the elaborate, cantilevered Gehry design required extra pilings to be driven into the bedrock to support the added weight, the cost of the bandshell eventually spiraled to $60.3 million. The cost of the park, as itemized in the following table, amounted to almost $500 million.

Mayor Daley at first placed much of the blame for the delay and cost overrun on Frank Gehry, who designed the pavilion and its connecting bridge; Daley's office later apologized to the architect. A 2001 investigative report by the "Chicago Tribune" described the park then under construction and its budget overruns as an "expensive public-works debacle that can be traced to haphazard planning, design snafus and cronyism". According to Lois Weisberg, commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs, and James Law, executive director of the Mayor's Office of Special Events, once the full scope of the project was finalized the project was completed within the revised budget.

Millennium Park had 3 million visitors in its first year; annual attendance was projected to grow to between 3.31 and 3.65 million by 2010. According to "Crain's Chicago Business", however, the park had about 4 million visitors in 2009. In addition to the different uses detailed for each of the permanent features (above), the park has hosted some other notable events, including the annual Grant Park Music Festival, and two temporary pavilions to mark the centennial of <a href="Daniel%20Burnham">Daniel Burnham</a>'s 1909 <a href="Plan%20of%20Chicago">Plan of Chicago</a>. Millennium Park has also been featured in several films and television shows.

The Grant Park Music Festival (formerly Grant Park Concerts) is an annual 10-week <a href="classical%20music">classical music</a> concert series, which features the <a href="Grant%20Park%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Grant Park Symphony Orchestra</a> and the Grant Park Chorus as well as guest performers and conductors. Since 2004, the festival has been housed in the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park. On occasion, the festival has been held at the Harris Theater instead of the Pritzker Pavilion.
The festival has earned <a href="non-profit%20organization">non-profit organization</a> status, and claims to be the nation's only free, outdoor classical music series.

The Grant Park Music Festival has been a Chicago tradition since 1931, when Chicago Mayor <a href="Anton%20Cermak">Anton Cermak</a> suggested free concerts to lift spirits of Chicagoans during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. The tradition of symphonic Grant Park Music Festival concerts began in 1935. The 2004 season, during which the festival moved to the Pritzker Pavilion, was the event's 70th season. Formerly, the Grant Park Music Festival was held at the <a href="Petrillo%20Music%20Shell">Petrillo Music Shell</a> in <a href="Grant%20Park%20%28Chicago%29">Grant Park</a>.

Over time the festival has had various financial supporters, three primary locations and one name change. At times it has been broadcast nationally on the <a href="NBC">National Broadcasting Corporation</a> (NBC) and <a href="CBS">Columbia Broadcasting Service</a> (CBS) radio networks, and many of the world's leading classical musicians have performed there. In 2000, the festival organizers agreed to release some of the concerts to the public via <a href="compact%20disc">compact disc</a> recordings.

In 2009, architects <a href="Zaha%20Hadid">Zaha Hadid</a> and <a href="Ben%20van%20Berkel">Ben van Berkel</a> were invited to design and build two pavilions on the Chase Promenade South, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Daniel Burnham's 1909 Plan of Chicago. The pavilions were privately funded and were designed to be temporary structures. They served as the focal point of Chicago's year-long celebration of Burnham's Plan, and were meant to symbolize the city's continued pursuit of the plan's architectural vision.

The van Berkel Pavilion was composed of two parallel rectangular planes joined by curving scoops, all built on a steel frame covered with glossy white plywood. It was situated on a raised platform, which was sliced by a ramp entrance, making it ADA accessible. The Hadid Pavilion was a tensioned fabric shell fitted over a curving aluminum framework made of more than 7,000 pieces. A centennial-themed video presentation was projected on its interior fabric walls after dark.

Both pavilions were scheduled to be unveiled on June 19, 2009. However, Hadid's pavilion was not ready in time; it had construction delays and a construction team change, which led to coverage of the delay in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>". Only its aluminum skeleton was available for public viewing on the scheduled date; the work was completed and unveiled on August 4, 2009. The van Berkel pavilion was temporarily closed for repairs August 10–14, due to unanticipated wear and tear. Both pavilions were dismantled after November 1, 2009; the materials from van Berkel's were recycled, while Hadid's was stored for possible exhibition elsewhere.

In October 2015, the City announced that its official annual <a href="Christmas%20tree">Christmas tree</a> lighting, which had been held at <a href="Daley%20Center">Daley Center</a> since 1966 (except for 1982), would be held at the park in order that the official Christmas tree of the city could be closer to ice skating at McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink, the annual <a href="Christmas%20carol">Christmas carol</a>ing at Cloud Gate and to the new offerings of the nearby <a href="Maggie%20Daley%20Park">Maggie Daley Park</a>. The annual lighting will occur near Michigan Avenue and Washington Street. Some parties opposed the move that separated the annual tree from the <a href="Christkindlmarket">Christkindlmarket</a> and the "<a href="Chicago%20Picasso">Chicago Picasso</a>". The city's first official tree lighting by Mayor <a href="Carter%20Harrison%2C%20Jr.">Carter Harrison, Jr.</a> in 1913 had been held in Grant Park on Michigan Avenue two blocks south of the new location.

<a href="Jeff%20Garlin">Jeff Garlin</a> claims that "<a href="I%20Want%20Someone%20to%20Eat%20Cheese%20With">I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With</a>" was the first Hollywood movie to incorporate Millennium Park. The film was not released until 2006, after the release of several other movies. These include the 2005 film "<a href="The%20Weather%20Man">The Weather Man</a>", which starred <a href="Nicolas%20Cage">Nicolas Cage</a> and was filmed in part at the park's McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. The 2006 romantic comedy "<a href="The%20Break-Up">The Break-Up</a>" shot scenes in the park, then had to reshoot some of them because "Cloud Gate" was under cover in some of the initial shots. Other movies which include scenes filmed in Millennium Park include the 2005 thriller "<a href="Derailed%20%282005%20film%29">Derailed</a>", the 2006 romance "<a href="The%20Lake%20House%20%28film%29">The Lake House</a>", and the 2007 thriller "<a href="Butterfly%20on%20a%20Wheel">Butterfly on a Wheel</a>". At least two television series have filmed in the park, including "<a href="Leverage%20%28TV%20series%29">Leverage</a>" and "<a href="Prison%20Break">Prison Break</a>", which featured shots of the "Crown Fountain" in the first few episodes of its first season (2005). In the ending scene of "<a href="Source%20Code">Source Code</a>" (2011), <a href="Jake%20Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>'s and <a href="Michelle%20Monaghan">Michelle Monaghan</a>'s characters are seen walking through Millennium Park, and make their way to the "Cloud Gate". In the 2012 <a href="romantic%20comedy">romantic comedy</a>, "<a href="The%20Vow%20%282012%20film%29">The Vow</a>", the characters run from the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">Art Institute of Chicago</a> across the <a href="Nichols%20Bridgeway">Nichols Bridgeway</a> to Millennium Park, where they kiss under "<a href="Cloud%20Gate">Cloud Gate</a>".
The book series <a href="Divergent%20trilogy">Divergent</a> has several events set in the part, with mentions of the <a href="Cloud%20Gate">Cloud Gate</a> sculpture (referred to as The Bean), the <a href="Jay%20Pritzker%20Pavilion">Jay Pritzker Pavilion</a>, as well as the park itself, though it is only referred to as Millennium in the novel. The faction Erudite has their headquarters across from the park in the book series. The park was featured in the 2014 action-adventure video game <a href="Watch%20Dogs">Watch Dogs</a>.

In 1836, a year before Chicago was incorporated, the Board of Canal Commissioners held public auctions for the city's first lots. Foresighted citizens, who wanted the lakefront kept as public open space, convinced the commissioners to designate the land east of Michigan Avenue between <a href="Randolph%20Street">Randolph Street</a> and Park Row (11th Street) "Public Ground—A Common to Remain Forever Open, Clear and Free of Any Buildings, or Other Obstruction, whatever." Grant Park has been "forever open, clear and free" since, protected by legislation that has been affirmed by four previous <a href="Illinois%20Supreme%20Court">Illinois Supreme Court</a> rulings. In 1839, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">United States Secretary of War</a> <a href="Joel%20Roberts%20Poinsett">Joel Roberts Poinsett</a> upon decommissioning the <a href="Fort%20Dearborn">Fort Dearborn</a> reserve, declared the land between Randolph Street and Madison Street east of Michigan Avenue "Public Ground forever to remain vacant of buildings".

<a href="Aaron%20Montgomery%20Ward">Aaron Montgomery Ward</a>, who is known both as the inventor of <a href="mail%20order">mail order</a> and the protector of Grant Park, twice sued the city of Chicago to force it to remove buildings and structures from Grant Park and to keep it from building new ones. In 1890, arguing that Michigan Avenue property owners held <a href="easement">easement</a>s on the park land, Ward commenced legal actions to keep the park free of new buildings. In 1900, the Illinois Supreme Court concluded that all landfill east of Michigan Avenue was subject to dedications and easements. In 1909, when Ward sought to prevent the construction of the <a href="Field%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Field Museum of Natural History</a> in the center of the park, the courts affirmed his arguments.

As a result, the city has what are termed Montgomery Ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park. However, the "Crown Fountain" and the Pritzker Pavilion were exempt from the height restrictions, because they were classified as works of art and not buildings or structures. According to "<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>", the pavilion is described as a work of art to dodge the protections established by Ward, who is said to continue to rule and protect Grant Park from his grave. The Harris Theater, which is adjacent to Pritzker Pavilion, was built almost entirely underground to avoid the height restrictions. The height of the "Crown Fountain", which is also exempted as a work of art, has been described as stemming from a "pissing contest" with other park feature artists.

The Millennium Park project has been the subject of some criticism since its inception. In addition to concerns about cost overruns, individuals and organizations have complained that the money spent on the park might have gone to other worthy causes. Although the park's design and architectural elements have won wide praise, there has been some criticism of its aesthetics. Other criticism has revolved around the larger issue of political favors in the city. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported in July 2004 that a contract for park cleanup had gone to a company that made contributions to Mayor Daley's election campaign. The park's full service restaurant, Park Grill, has been criticized for its connection to numerous friends and associates of the mayor.

Concerns have also been raised over the mixed use of taxpayer and corporate funding and associated naming rights for sections of the park. While a monument in Wrigley Square honors the park's many private and corporate donors, many park features are also named for their corporate underwriters, with the sponsors' names prominently indicated with stone markers (The Boeing Gallery, The Exelon Pavilion, The AT&T Plaza, The Wrigley Square). Some critics have deemed this to be inappropriate for a public space. Julie Deardorff, "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" health and fitness reporter, described the naming of the McDonald's Cycle Center as a continuation of the " 'McDonaldization' of America" and as somewhat "insidious" because the company is making itself more prominent as the social sentiment is to move away from <a href="fast%20food">fast food</a>. Timothy Gilfoyle, author of "Millennium Park: Creating a Chicago Landmark", notes that a controversy surrounds the corporate naming of several of the park's features, including the BP Bridge, named for an <a href="Oil%20major">oil company</a>. Naming rights were sold for high fees, and Gilfoyle was not the only one who chastised park officials for selling naming rights to the highest bidder. Public interest groups have crusaded against commercialization of parks. However, many of the donors have a long history of local philanthropy and their funds were essential to provide necessary financing for several park features.

Ticket prices for both the Harris Theater and the Pritzker Pavilion have been controversial. John von Rhein, classical music critic for the "Chicago Tribune", notes that the theater's size poses a challenge to performers attempting to fill its seats, and feels that it overemphasizes high-priced events. In 2009–2010, the theater introduced two discounted ticket programs: a $5 lunchtime series of 45-minute dance performances, and a $10 ticket program for in-person, cash-only purchases in the last 90 minutes before performances. Once the pavilion was built, the initial plan was that the lawn seating would be free for all events. An early brochure for the Grant Park Music Festival said "You never need a ticket to attend a concert! The lawn and the general seating section are always admission free." However, when parking garage revenue fell short of estimates during the first year, the city charged $10 for lawn seating at the August 31, 2005, concert by <a href="Tori%20Amos">Tori Amos</a>. Amos, a classically trained musician who chose only piano and organ accompaniment for her concert, earned positive reviews as the inaugural <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> performer in a venue that regularly hosts classical music. The city justified the charge by contending that since the pavilion is an open-air venue, there were many places in Millennium Park where people could have enjoyed the music or the atmosphere of the park without having to pay.

When Millennium Park first opened in 2004, Metra police stopped a <a href="Columbia%20College%20Chicago">Columbia College Chicago</a> <a href="journalism">journalism</a> student working on a photography project, and confiscated his film because of fears of terrorism. In 2005, "Cloud Gate" attracted some controversy when a professional photographer without a paid permit was denied access to the piece. As is the case for all works of art currently covered by United States <a href="copyright">copyright</a> law, the artist holds the copyright for the sculpture. The public may freely photograph "Cloud Gate", but permission from Kapoor or the City of Chicago (which has licensed the art) is required for any commercial reproductions of the photographs. Initially the city charged photographers permit fees of $350 per day for professional still photographers, $1,200 per day for professional <a href="videographer">videographer</a>s and $50 per hour for wedding photographers. The policy has been changed so permits are only required for large-scale film, video and photography requiring 10-person crews.

Almost all of Millennium Park was closed for a day for corporate events in 2005 and 2006. Closing a public park partly paid for with taxpayer money was controversial, as was the exclusion of commuters who walk through the park and tourists lured by its attractions. On September 8, 2005, <a href="Toyota%20Motor%20Sales%20USA">Toyota Motor Sales USA</a> paid $800,000 to rent all park venues from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m, except Wrigley Square, the Lurie Garden, the McDonald's Cycle Center and the "Crown Fountain". The city said the money was used to fund day-to-day operations, and for free events in the park, including the Lurie Garden Festival, a <a href="Steppenwolf%20Theatre%20Company">Steppenwolf Theater</a> production, musical performers along the Chase Promenade all summer long, a jazz series, and children's concerts. The name of Toyota, one of the sponsors, was included on Millennium Park brochures, web site, and advertising signage. The closure provided a public relations opportunity for <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a>, which shuttled 1,500 tourists from the park to see other Chicago attractions. Toyota said it considered $300,000 a rental expense and $500,000 a sponsoring donation. On August 7, 2006, <a href="Allstate">Allstate</a>, which paid $200,000 as a rental expense and $500,000 as a sponsoring donation, acquired the visitation rights to a different set of park features (including Lurie Garden), and only had exclusive access to certain features after 4 p.m.

The park is closed from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. daily. Chicago is a dog-friendly city with a half dozen dog beaches, however the city does not permit dogs in the park. Only on-duty <a href="service%20dog">service dog</a>s for the disabled or visually impaired are permitted.

In November 2006, the "Crown Fountain" became the focus of a public controversy when the city added <a href="surveillance%20camera">surveillance camera</a>s atop each tower. Purchased with a $52 million <a href="Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security">Department of Homeland Security</a> grant, the cameras augmented eight others covering all of Millennium Park. City officials had consulted the architects who collaborated with Plensa on the tower designs, but not Plensa himself. Public reaction was negative, as bloggers and the artistic community decried the cameras as inappropriate and a blight on the towers. The city said that the cameras would be replaced with permanent, less intrusive models in several months; it contended that the cameras, similar to those used throughout Chicago in high-crime areas and at traffic intersections, had been added largely for security reasons but also partly to help park officials monitor burnt-out LED lights on the fountain. The "Chicago Tribune" published an article on the cameras and the public reaction; the cameras were removed the next day, with Plensa's support.

The "<a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a>" describes Millennium Park as "an extraordinary public park that is set to create new iconic images of the city", and further notes that it is "a genuinely 21st-century interactive park [that] could trigger a new way of thinking about public outdoor spaces". "Time" magazine views both "Cloud Gate" and the Jay Pritzker Pavilion as part of a well-planned visit to Chicago. <a href="Frommer%27s">Frommer's</a> lists exploring Millennium Park as one of the four best free things to do in the city, and it commends the park for its various artistic offerings. "<a href="Lonely%20Planet">Lonely Planet</a>" recommends an hour-long stroll to see the park's playful art. The park is praised as a "showcase of art and urban design" by the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>", while "Time" refers to it as an "artfully re-arranged ... civic phantasmagoria like <a href="Antonio%20Gaud%C3%AD">Antonio Gaudí</a>'s <a href="Park%20G%C3%BCell">Park Güell</a> in Barcelona, with the difference that this one is the product of an ensemble of creative spirits". The book "1,000 Places to See in the U.S.A. & Canada Before You Die" describes Millennium Park as a renowned attraction.

The park was designed to be <a href="accessible">accessible</a>; it only needs a single <a href="wheelchair%20lift">wheelchair lift</a> and its accessibility won its project director the 2005 Barrier-Free America Award. The McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink and the Jay Pritzker Pavilion both provide accessible restrooms. The park opened with 78 women's toilet fixtures and 45 for men, with heated facilities on the east side of the Pritzker Pavilion. It also had about six dozen park benches designed by GGN (Gustafson Guthrie Nichol), the <a href="landscape%20architect">landscape architect</a> responsible for the Lurie Garden. In 2005, the park won the Green Roof Award of Excellence in the Intensive Industrial/Commercial category from Green Roofs for Healthy Cities (GRHC). GRHC considers the park to be one of the largest <a href="green%20roof">green roof</a>s in the world; it covers "a structural deck supported by two reinforced concrete cast-in-place garages and steel structures that span over the remaining railroad tracks". In 2005 the park also received "<a href="Travel%20%2B%20Leisure">Travel + Leisure</a>"'s Design Award for "Best Public Space", and the American Public Works Association's "Project of the Year" Award. In its first year, the park, its features and associated people received over 30 awards.

Some mayors from other cities have admired the park as an example of successful <a href="urban%20planning">urban planning</a>. The mayor of <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> enjoyed his visit to the park, and San Francisco Mayor <a href="Gavin%20Newsom">Gavin Newsom</a> wished his city could create a similar type of civic amenity. Closer to home, <a href="Blair%20Kamin">Blair Kamin</a>, the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning architecture critic for the "Chicago Tribune", concluded his 2004 review of Millennium Park with the following: "...a park provides a respite from the city, yet it also reflects the city. In that sense, all of Millennium Park mirrors the rebirth of Chicago ... the ambition of its patrons, the creativity of its artists and architects, and the ongoing miracle of its ability to transform a no place into a someplace that's extraordinary." In 2009 Millennium Park won the <a href="Rudy%20Bruner%20Award%20for%20Urban%20Excellence">Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence</a> silver medal.

In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, Millennium Park was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the <a href="American%20Institute%20of%20Architects">American Institute of Architects</a> Illinois component (AIA Illinois) and was recognized by USA Today Travel magazine, as one of AIA Illinois' selections for Illinois 25 Must See Places.

USS Chesapeake (1799)

Chesapeake was a 38-gun wooden-<a href="hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a>ed, three-<a href="Mast%20%28sailing%29">masted</a> <a href="heavy%20frigate">heavy frigate</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. She was one of the <a href="original%20six%20frigates%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Navy">original six frigates</a> whose construction was authorized by the <a href="Naval%20Act%20of%201794">Naval Act of 1794</a>. <a href="Joshua%20Humphreys">Joshua Humphreys</a> designed these frigates to be the young navy's <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s. "Chesapeake" was originally designed as a 44-gun frigate but construction delays, material shortages, and budget problems caused builder <a href="Josiah%20Fox">Josiah Fox</a> to alter her design to 38 guns. Launched at the <a href="Gosport%20Navy%20Yard">Gosport Navy Yard</a> on 2 December 1799, "Chesapeake" began her career during the <a href="Quasi-War">Quasi-War</a> with France and saw service in the <a href="First%20Barbary%20War">First Barbary War</a>.

On 22 June 1807 she was fired upon by of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> for refusing to comply with a search for deserters. The event, now known as the <a href="Chesapeake%E2%80%93Leopard%20Affair">"Chesapeake–Leopard" Affair</a>, angered the American populace and government and was a precipitating factor that led to the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. As a result of the affair, "Chesapeake"s commanding officer, <a href="James%20Barron">James Barron</a>, was <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>ed and the United States instituted the <a href="Embargo%20Act%20of%201807">Embargo Act of 1807</a> against Great Britain.

Early in the War of 1812 she made one patrol and captured five British <a href="merchant%20ship">merchant ship</a>s before returning. She was captured by shortly after sailing from Boston, Massachusetts, on 1 June 1813. The Royal Navy took her into their service as HMS "Chesapeake", where she served until she was broken up and her timbers sold in 1819; they are now part of the <a href="Chesapeake%20Mill">Chesapeake Mill</a> in <a href="Wickham%2C%20Hampshire">Wickham</a>, England.

American <a href="merchant%20vessel">merchant vessel</a>s began to fall prey to <a href="Barbary%20corsairs">Barbary Pirates</a>, most notably from <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a>, in the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> during the 1790s. Congress responded with the <a href="Naval%20Act%20of%201794">Naval Act of 1794</a>. The Act provided funds for the construction of six frigates, and directed that the construction would continue unless and until the United States agreed to peace terms with Algiers.

<a href="Joshua%20Humphreys">Joshua Humphreys</a>' design was long on <a href="keel">keel</a> and narrow of <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> (width) to allow for the mounting of very heavy guns. The design incorporated a diagonal <a href="scantling">scantling</a> (rib) scheme to limit <a href="hogging%20and%20sagging">hogging</a> (warping) and included extremely heavy planking. This gave the <a href="Hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates. Since the fledgling United States could not match the numbers of ships of the European states, Humphreys designed his frigates to be able to overpower other frigates, but with the speed to escape from a <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ship of the line</a>.

Originally designated as "Frigate D", the ship remained unnamed for several years. Her keel was laid down in December 1795 at the <a href="Gosport%20Navy%20Yard">Gosport Navy Yard</a> in Norfolk, Virginia, where <a href="Josiah%20Fox">Josiah Fox</a> had been appointed her naval constructor and <a href="Richard%20Dale">Richard Dale</a> as superintendent of construction. In March 1796 a peace accord was announced between the United States and Algiers and construction was suspended in accordance with the Naval Act of 1794. The keel remained on blocks in the navy yard for two years.

The onset of the <a href="Quasi-War">Quasi-War</a> with France in 1798 prompted Congress to authorize completion of "Frigate D", and they approved resumption of the work on 16 July. When Fox returned to Norfolk he discovered a shortage of timber caused by its diversion from Norfolk to Baltimore in order to finish . He corresponded with Secretary of the Navy <a href="Benjamin%20Stoddert">Benjamin Stoddert</a>, who indicated a desire to expedite construction of the ship and reduce the overall cost. Fox, always an opponent of Humphreys's large design, submitted new plans to Stoddert which called for utilizing the existing keel but reducing the overall dimensions substantially in length and partially of beam. Fox's plans essentially proposed an entirely different design than originally planned by Humphreys. Secretary Stoddert approved the new design plans.

When construction finished, she had the smallest dimensions of the six frigates. A length of <a href="length%20between%20perpendiculars">between perpendiculars</a> and of beam contrasted with her closest sisters, and "Constellation", which were built to in length and of beam. The final cost of her construction was $220,677—the second-least expensive frigate of the six. The least expensive was "Congress" at $197,246.

During construction, a sloop named "Chesapeake" was launched on 20 June 1799 but was renamed between 10 October and 14 November, apparently to free up the name "Chesapeake" for "Frigate D". In communications between Fox and Stoddert, Fox repeatedly referred to her as "Congress", further confusing matters, until he was informed by Stoddert the ship was to be named "Chesapeake", after <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>. She was the only one of the six frigates not named by President <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>, nor after a principle of the United States Constitution.

"Chesapeake"s nominal rating is stated as either 36 or 38 guns. Originally designated as a 44-gun ship, her redesign by Fox led to a rerating, apparently based on her smaller dimensions when compared to "Congress" and "Constellation". Joshua Humphreys may have rerated "Chesapeake" to 38 guns, or Secretary Stoddert rerated "Congress" and "Constellation" to 38 guns because they were larger than "Chesapeake", which was rated to 36 guns. The most recent information on her rating is from the "Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships", which states she was rerated "from 44 guns to 36, eventually increased to 38". Her gun rating remained a matter of confusion throughout her career; Fox used a 44-gun rating in his correspondence with Secretary Stoddert. In preparing for the War of 1812 Secretary of the Navy <a href="Paul%20Hamilton%20%28politician%29">Paul Hamilton</a> directed Captain Samuel Evans to recruit the number of crewmen required for a 44-gun ship. Hamilton was corrected by <a href="William%20Bainbridge">William Bainbridge</a> in a letter stating, "There is a mistake in the crew ordered for the "Chesapeake", as it equals in number the crews of our 44-gun frigates, whereas the "Chesapeake" is of the class of the "Congress" and "Constellation"." Lastly, when sold for scrap by the Royal Navy in 1819, she was rated as a 48-gun ship.

Gun ratings did not correspond to the actual number of guns a ship would carry. "Chesapeake" was noted as carrying 40 guns during her encounter with and 50 guns during her engagement with in 1813. The 50 guns consisted of twenty-eight 18-pounder (8 kg) long guns on the <a href="gun%20deck">gun deck</a>, fourteen on each side. This main battery was complemented by two long 12-pounders (5.5 kg), one long 18-pounder, eighteen 32-pounder (14.5 kg) <a href="carronade">carronade</a>s, and one 12-pound carronade on the <a href="spar%20deck">spar deck</a>. Her <a href="broadside">broadside</a> weight was .

The ships of this era had no permanent battery of guns; guns were completely portable and were often exchanged between ships as situations warranted. Each commanding officer modified his vessel's armaments to his liking while taking into consideration factors such as the overall tonnage of cargo, complement of personnel aboard, and planned routes to be sailed. Consequently, a vessel's armament would change often during its career; records of the changes were not generally kept.

"Chesapeake" was <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 2 December 1799 during the undeclared Quasi-War (1798–1800), which arose after the French navy seized American merchant ships. Her <a href="fitting-out">fitting-out</a> continued through May 1800. In March Josiah Fox was reprimanded by Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert for continuing to work on "Chesapeake" while "Congress", still awaiting completion, was fully manned with a crew drawing pay. Stoddert appointed <a href="Thomas%20Truxton">Thomas Truxton</a> to ensure that his directives concerning "Congress" were carried out.

"Chesapeake" first put to sea on 22 May commanded by Captain <a href="Samuel%20Barron%20%281765%E2%80%931810%29">Samuel Barron</a> and marked her departure from Norfolk with a 13-gun salute. Her first assignment was to carry currency from Charleston, South Carolina, to Philadelphia. On 6 June she joined a squadron patrolling off the southern coast of the United States and in the West Indies escorting American merchant ships.

Capturing the 16-gun French <a href="privateer">privateer</a> "La Jeune Creole" on 1 January 1801 after a chase lasting 50 hours, she returned to Norfolk with her <a href="prize%20%28law%29">prize</a> on 15 January. "Chesapeake" returned briefly to the West Indies in February, soon after a <a href="Convention%20of%201800">peace treaty</a> was ratified with France. She returned to Norfolk and decommissioned on 26 February, subsequently being placed <a href="reserve%20fleet">in reserve</a>.

During the Quasi-War, the United States had paid <a href="tribute">tribute</a> to the <a href="Barbary%20Coast">Barbary States</a> to ensure that they would not seize or harass American merchant ships. In 1801 <a href="Yusuf%20Karamanli">Yusuf Karamanli</a> of <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a>, dissatisfied with the amount of tribute in comparison to that paid to Algiers, demanded an immediate payment of $250,000. <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> responded by sending a squadron of warships to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and to pursue peace negotiations with the Barbary States. The first squadron was under the command of Richard Dale in "President" and the second was assigned to the command of <a href="Richard%20Valentine%20Morris">Richard Valentine Morris</a> in "Chesapeake". Morris's squadron eventually consisted of the vessels "Constellation", , , , and . It took several months to prepare the vessels for sea; they departed individually as they became ready.

"Chesapeake" departed from Hampton Roads on 27 April 1802 and arrived at <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on 25 May; she immediately put in for repairs, as her main mast had split during the voyage. Morris remained at Gibraltar while awaiting word on the location of his squadron, as several ships had not reported in. On 22 July "Adams" arrived with belated orders for Morris, dated 20 April. Those orders were to "lay the whole squadron before Tripoli" and negotiate peace. "Chesapeake" and "Enterprise" departed Gibraltar on 17 August bound for <a href="Livorno">Leghorn</a>, while providing protection for a convoy of merchant ships that were bound for intermediate ports. Morris made several stops in various ports before finally arriving at Leghorn on 12 October, after which he sailed to <a href="Malta">Malta</a>. "Chesapeake" undertook repairs of a rotted <a href="bowsprit">bowsprit</a>. "Chesapeake" was still in port when "John Adams" arrived on 5 January 1803 with orders dated 23 October 1802 from Secretary of the Navy <a href="Robert%20Smith%20%28cabinet%29">Robert Smith</a>. These directed "Chesapeake" and "Constellation" to return to the United States; Morris was to transfer his command to "New York". "Constellation" sailed directly as ordered, but Morris retained "Chesapeake" at Malta, claiming that she was not in any condition to make an Atlantic voyage during the winter months.

Morris now had the ships "New York", "John Adams", and "Enterprise" gathered under him, while "Adams" was at Gibraltar. On 30 January "Chesapeake" and the squadron got underway for Tripoli, where Morris planned to burn <a href="Karamanli%20dynasty">Tripolitan</a> ships in the harbor. Heavy gales made the approach to Tripoli difficult. Fearing "Chesapeake" would lose her masts from the strong winds, Morris returned to Malta on 10 February. With provisions for the ships running low and none available near Malta, Morris decided to abandon plans to blockade Tripoli and sailed the squadron back to Gibraltar for provisioning. They made stops at <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a> on 22 February and Algiers on 19 March. "Chesapeake" arrived at Gibraltar on 23 March, where Morris transferred his command to "New York". Under <a href="James%20Barron">James Barron</a>, "Chesapeake" sailed for the United States on 7 April and she was placed in reserve at the <a href="Washington%20Navy%20Yard">Washington Navy Yard</a> on 1 June.

Morris remained in the Mediterranean until September, when orders from Secretary Smith arrived suspending his command and instructing him to return to the United States. There he faced a <a href="Naval%20Board%20of%20Inquiry">Naval Board of Inquiry</a> which found that he was censurable for "inactive and dilatory conduct of the squadron under his command". He was dismissed from the navy in 1804. Morris's overall performance in the Mediterranean was particularly criticized for the state of affairs aboard "Chesapeake" and his inactions as a commander. His wife, young son, and housekeeper accompanied him on the voyage, during which Mrs. Morris gave birth to another son. Midshipman Henry Wadsworth wrote that he and the other midshipman referred to Mrs. Morris as the "Commodoress" and believed she was the main reason behind "Chesapeake" remaining in port for months at a time. Consul <a href="William%20Eaton%20%28soldier%29">William Eaton</a> reported to Secretary Smith that Morris and his squadron spent more time in port sightseeing and doing little but "dance and wench" rather than blockading Tripoli.

In January 1807 Master Commandant Charles Gordon was appointed "Chesapeake"s commanding officer (Captain). He was ordered to prepare her for patrol and convoy duty in the Mediterranean to relieve her sister ship , which had been on duty there since 1803. James Barron was appointed overall commander of the squadron as its Commodore. "Chesapeake" was in much disarray from her multi-year period of inactivity and many months were required for repairs, provisioning, and recruitment of personnel. Lieutenant Arthur Sinclair was tasked with the recruiting. Among those chosen were three sailors who had deserted from . The British ambassador to the United States requested the return of the sailors. Barron found that, although they were indeed from "Melampus", they had been <a href="Impressment">impressed</a> into Royal Navy service from the beginning. He therefore refused to release them back to "Melampus" and nothing further was communicated on the subject.

In early June "Chesapeake" departed the Washington Navy Yard for Norfolk, Virginia, where she completed provisioning and loading armaments. Captain Gordon informed Barron on the 19th that "Chesapeake" was ready for sea and they departed on 22 June armed with 40 guns. At the same time, a British squadron consisting of HMS "Melampus", , and "Leopard" (a 50-gun <a href="fourth%20rate">fourth rate</a>) were lying off the port of Norfolk blockading two French ships there. As "Chesapeake" departed, the squadron ships began signaling each other and "Leopard" got under way preceding "Chesapeake" to sea.

After sailing for some hours, "Leopard", commanded by Captain <a href="Salusbury%20Pryce%20Humphreys">Salusbury Pryce Humphreys</a>, approached "Chesapeake" and hailed a request to deliver dispatches to England, a customary request of the time. When a British lieutenant arrived by boat he handed Barron an order, given by Vice-Admiral <a href="George%20Cranfield-Berkeley">George Berkeley</a> of the Royal Navy, which instructed the British ships to stop and board "Chesapeake" to search for deserters. Barron refused to allow this search, and as the lieutenant returned to "Leopard" Barron ordered the crew to <a href="general%20quarters">general quarters</a>. Shortly afterward "Leopard" hailed "Chesapeake"; Barron could not understand the message. "Leopard" fired a <a href="shot%20across%20the%20bow">shot across the bow</a>, followed by a broadside, at "Chesapeake". For fifteen minutes, while "Chesapeake" attempted to arm herself, "Leopard" continued to fire broadside after broadside until Barron <a href="Striking%20the%20colors">struck his colors</a>. "Chesapeake" only managed to fire one retaliatory shot after hot coals from the galley were brought on deck to ignite the cannon. The British boarded "Chesapeake" and carried off four crewmen, declining Barron's offer that "Chesapeake" be taken as a prize of war. "Chesapeake" had three sailors killed and Barron was among the 18 wounded.

Word of the incident spread quickly upon "Chesapeake"s return to Norfolk, where the British squadron that included "Leopard" was provisioning. Mobs of angry citizens destroyed two hundred water casks destined for the squadron and nearly killed a British lieutenant before local authorities intervened. President Jefferson recalled all US warships from the Mediterranean and issued a proclamation: all British warships were banned from entering US ports and those already in port were to depart. The incident eventually led to the <a href="Embargo%20Act%20of%201807">Embargo Act of 1807</a>.

"Chesapeake" was completely unprepared to defend herself during the incident. None of her guns were primed for operation and the spar deck was filled with materials that were not properly stowed in the cargo hold. A court-martial was convened for Barron and Captain Gordon, as well as Lieutenant Hall of the Marines. Barron was found guilty of "neglecting on the probability of an engagement to clear his Ship for action" and suspended from the navy for five years. Gordon and Hall were privately reprimanded, and the ship's gunner was discharged from the navy.

After the heavy damage inflicted by "Leopard", "Chesapeake" returned to Norfolk for repairs. Under the command of <a href="Stephen%20Decatur">Stephen Decatur</a>, she made patrols off the New England coast enforcing the laws of the Embargo Act throughout 1809.

The "Chesapeake"–"Leopard" Affair, and later the <a href="Little%20Belt%20Affair">"Little Belt" Affair</a>, contributed to the United States' decision to declare war on Britain on 18 June 1812. "Chesapeake", under the command of Captain <a href="Samuel%20Evans%20%28naval%20officer%29">Samuel Evans</a>, was prepared for duty in the Atlantic. Beginning on 13 December, she ranged from <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a> and traveled clockwise to the <a href="Cape%20Verde%20Islands">Cape Verde Islands</a> and South America, and then back to Boston. She captured six ships as prizes: the British ships "Volunteer", "Liverpool Hero", "Earl Percy", and "Ellen"; the brig "Julia", an American ship trading under a British license; and "Valeria", an American ship recaptured from British privateers. During the cruise she was chased by an unknown British <a href="ship-of-the-line">ship-of-the-line</a> and frigate but, after a passing storm squall, the two pursuing ships were gone the next morning. The cargo of "Volunteer", 40 tons of pig iron and copper, were sold for $185,000. "Earl Percy" never made it back to port as she ran aground off the coast of Long Island, and "Liverpool Hero" was burned as she was considered leaky. "Chesapeake"s total monetary damage to British shipping was $235,675. She returned to Boston on 9 April 1813 for refitting.

Captain Evans, now in poor health, requested relief of command. Captain <a href="James%20Lawrence">James Lawrence</a>, late of and her victory over , took command of "Chesapeake" on 20 May. Affairs of the ship were in poor condition. The term of enlistment for many of the crew had expired and they were daily leaving the ship. Those who remained were disgruntled and approaching mutiny, as the prize money they were owed from her previous cruise was held up in court. Lawrence paid out the prize money from his own pocket in order to appease them. Some sailors from "Constitution" joined "Chesapeake" and they filled the crew along with sailors of several nations.

Meanwhile, Captain <a href="Philip%20Broke">Philip Broke</a> and HMS "Shannon", a 38-gun frigate, were patrolling off the port of Boston on blockade duty. "Shannon" had been under the command of Broke since 1806 and, under his direction, the crew held daily great gun and small arms drills lasting up to three hours each. Crew members who hit their bullseye were awarded a pound (454 g) of tobacco for their good marksmanship. Broke had also fitted out his cannons with dispart and tangent sights to increase accuracy as well as degree bearings on the decks and gun carriages to allow the crew to focus their fire on a specific target. In this regard "Chesapeake", with traditional gun practice and a crew that had only been together for a few months, was greatly inferior.

Lawrence, advised that "Shannon" had moved in closer to Boston, began preparations to sail on the evening of 31 May. The next morning Broke wrote a challenge to Lawrence and dispatched it to "Chesapeake"; it did not arrive before Lawrence set out to meet "Shannon" on his own accord.

Leaving port with a broad white flag bearing the motto "Free Trade and Sailors' Rights", "Chesapeake" met with "Shannon" near 5 pm that afternoon. During six minutes of firing, each ship managed two full broadsides. "Chesapeake"s first broadside was fired while the ship was heeling, causing most hits on "Shannon" to strike the water or waterline causing little damage to "Shannon" although carronade fire caused serious damage to "Shannon"s rigging. A second round of fire was more effective, landing hits on "Shannon"s 12-pounder shot locker. "Chesapeake"s 32-pound carronades punished "Shannon"s forecastle, killing three men, wounding others and disabling "Shannon"s nine-pounder bow gun. However "Chesapeake" suffered far more heavily in the exchange as accurate British fire caused heavy losses among American gun crews and crippling losses to the men and officers on "Chesapeake"s quarterdeck. A succession of helmsmen were killed and her wheel itself was destroyed. At the same time, her foretopsail halyard was shot away causing the ship to lose maneuverability.

Unable to maneuver, "Chesapeake" "luffed up" and her port stern quarter caught against the side of "Shannon" amidships and the two ships were lashed together. Confusion and disarray reigned on the deck of "Chesapeake"; Captain Lawrence tried rallying a party to board "Shannon", but the bugler failed to sound the call. At this point a shot from a sniper mortally wounded Lawrence; as his men carried him below, he gave his last order: "Don't give up the ship. Fight her till she sinks."

Captain Broke boarded "Chesapeake" at the head of a party of 20 men. They met little resistance from "Chesapeake"s crew, most of whom had run below deck. The only resistance from "Chesapeake" came from her contingent of marines. The British soon overwhelmed them; only nine escaped injury out of 44. Captain Broke was severely injured in the fighting on the forecastle, being struck in the head with a sword. Soon after, "Shannon"s crew pulled down "Chesapeake"s flag. Only 15 minutes had elapsed from the first exchange of gunfire to the capture.

Reports on the number of killed and wounded aboard "Chesapeake" during the battle vary widely. Broke's after-action report from 6 July states 70 killed and 100 wounded. Contemporary sources place the number between 48–61 killed and 85–99 wounded. Discrepancies in the number of killed and wounded are possibly caused by the addition of sailors who died of their wounds in the ensuing days after the battle. The counts for "Shannon" have fewer discrepancies with 23 killed; 56 wounded. Despite his serious injuries, Broke ordered repairs to both ships and they proceeded on to <a href="Halifax%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Halifax</a>, Nova Scotia. Captain Lawrence died en route and was buried in Halifax with military honors. The British imprisoned his crew; those who died in captivity are buried at <a href="Deadman%27s%20Island%20%28Nova%20Scotia%29">Dead Man's Island</a>. Captain Broke survived his wounds and was later made a <a href="baronet">baronet</a>.

The Royal Navy repaired "Chesapeake" and took her into service as HMS "Chesapeake". She served on the Halifax station under the command of Alexander Dixie through 1814, and under the command of George Burdett she sailed to Plymouth, England, for repairs in October of that year. Afterward she made a voyage to <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, South Africa, until learning of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Ghent">peace treaty</a> with the United States in May 1815. Later that year a report was made concerning "Chesapeake"s performance in British service. Her captain observed that she was strongly constructed, but criticized the excessive overhang of the stern. He concluded that she was not a suitable ship to serve as a model for copying. Her speed under sail was not particularly impressive: close-hauled and large. In July 1819 the Commissioners of the Royal Navy put her up for sale at Plymouth. A Portsmouth timber merchant purchased her for £500; he dismantled the ship and sold her timbers to Joshua Holmes for £3,450. Eventually her timbers became part of the <a href="Chesapeake%20Mill">Chesapeake Mill</a> in <a href="Wickham%2C%20Hampshire">Wickham</a>, Hampshire, England, where one can still view them. In 1996 a timber fragment from the Chesapeake Mill was returned to the United States. It is on display at the <a href="Hampton%20Roads%20Naval%20Museum">Hampton Roads Naval Museum</a>.

Almost from her beginnings, "Chesapeake" was considered an "unlucky ship", the "runt of the litter" to the superstitious sailors of the 19th century, and the product of a disagreement between Humphreys and Fox. Her ill-fated encounters with HMS "Leopard" and "Shannon", the <a href="court-martial">courts-martial</a> of two of her captains, and the accidental deaths of several crewmen led many to believe she was cursed.

Arguments defending both Humphreys and Fox regarding their long-standing disagreements over the design of the frigates carried on for years. Humphreys disowned any credit for Fox's redesign of "Chesapeake". In 1827 he wrote, "She ["Chesapeake"] spoke his [Fox's] talents. Which I leave the Commanders of that ship to estimate by her qualifications."

Lawrence's last command of "Don't give up the ship!" became a rallying cry for the US Navy. <a href="Oliver%20Hazard%20Perry">Oliver Hazard Perry</a>, in command of naval forces on Lake Erie during September 1813, named his <a href="flagship">flagship</a> , which flew a broad blue flag bearing the words " give up the ship!" The phrase is still used in the US Navy today.

"Chesapeake"s blood-stained and bullet-ridden American flag was sold at auction in London in 1908. Purchased by <a href="William%20Waldorf%20Astor%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Astor">William Waldorf Astor</a>, it now resides in the <a href="National%20Maritime%20Museum">National Maritime Museum</a> in <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a>, England, along with her signal book. The <a href="Maritime%20Museum%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Maritime Museum of the Atlantic</a> in Halifax, Nova Scotia, holds several artifacts from the battle including the mess kettle, and an officers chest from "Chesapeake". One of the <a href="18-pounder%20long%20gun">18-pounder guns</a> from "Chesapeake" is mounted beside <a href="Province%20House%20%28Nova%20Scotia%29">Province House</a>, the Nova Scotia Legislature.

Witold Pilecki

Witold Pilecki (13 May 190125 May 1948; ; codenames "Roman Jezierski, Tomasz Serafiński, Druh, Witold") was a Polish cavalry officer, intelligence agent, and resistance leader. He served as a "Rotmistrz" (captain) with the Polish Army in the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Soviet%20War">Polish–Soviet War</a>, <a href="Second%20Polish%20Republic">Second Polish Republic</a>, and <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. He was also a co-founder of the <a href="Secret%20Polish%20Army">Secret Polish Army</a> ("Tajna Armia Polska"), a resistance group in German-occupied Poland, and later a member of the underground <a href="Home%20Army">Home Army</a> ("Armia Krajowa"). He was the author of <a href="Witold%27s%20Report">Witold's Report</a>, the first comprehensive Allied intelligence report on <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz concentration camp</a> and the Holocaust. He was a Roman Catholic.

During World War II, Pilecki volunteered for a Polish resistance operation that involved being imprisoned in the Auschwitz concentration camp in order to gather intelligence and later escape. While in the camp, he organized a resistance movement and informed the Western Allies of Nazi Germany's Auschwitz atrocities as early as 1941. He escaped from the camp in 1943 after nearly 2½ years of imprisonment. He took part as a combatant in the <a href="Warsaw%20Uprising">Warsaw Uprising</a> in August–October 1944. He remained loyal to the London-based <a href="Polish%20government-in-exile">Polish government-in-exile</a> after the Communist takeover of Poland, and he was arrested for espionage in 1947 by the Stalinist secret police (Urząd Bezpieczeństwa) on charges of working for "foreign imperialism", a euphemism for British Intelligence. He was executed after a show trial in 1948. Information was suppressed about his exploits and fate until 1989 by the Communist regime in Poland.

Pilecki is considered as "one of the greatest wartime heroes" because of his efforts. Poland's Chief Rabbi <a href="Michael%20Schudrich">Michael Schudrich</a> writes in "The Auschwitz Volunteer: Beyond Bravery": "When God created the human being, God had in mind that we should all be like Captain Witold Pilecki, of blessed memory." British historian <a href="Norman%20Davies">Norman Davies</a> writes: "If there was an Allied hero who deserved to be remembered and celebrated, this was a person with few peers." Polish ambassador <a href="Ryszard%20Schnepf">Ryszard Schnepf</a> described Pilecki as a "diamond among Poland's heroes" and "the highest example of Polish patriotism" at the commemoration event of <a href="International%20Holocaust%20Remembrance%20Day">International Holocaust Remembrance Day</a> held in the US Holocaust Memorial Museum on 27 January 2013.

Witold Pilecki was born on 13 May 1901 in the town of <a href="Olonets">Olonets</a>, <a href="Republic%20of%20Karelia">Karelia</a>, in the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>. He was a descendant of an <a href="aristocratic">aristocratic</a> family (<a href="szlachta">szlachta</a>) originally from the <a href="Grodno%20Region">Grodno Region</a>. His grandfather, Józef Pilecki <a href="Nobiliary%20particle">h.</a> <a href="Leliwa">Leliwa</a>, was a member of the <a href="Polish%20landed%20gentry">Polish landed gentry</a> and a dedicated <a href="Polish%20nationalism">Polish nationalist</a>. He had been a supporter of the <a href="secessionist">secessionist</a> <a href="January%20Uprising">January Uprising</a> of 1863–1864. Following the brutal <a href="January%20Uprising%23Uprising%20in%20the%20former%20Polish-Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">defeat of the uprising</a> by Russian forces, Józef Pilecki, like most Polish nobles who supported the rebellion, had his <a href="List%20of%20Polish%20titled%20nobility">title</a> revoked; his <a href="Estate%20%28law%29">estate</a> near <a href="Lida">Lida</a> and his other properties were confiscated by the <a href="Imperial%20Russia">Russian government</a>. He was also condemned to exile in <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> for seven years. After his release he and his family were <a href="Forced%20displacement">forcibly resettled</a> by <a href="Ministry%20of%20Internal%20Affairs%20%28Russia%29">Tsarist authorities</a> to the remote territory of <a href="Republic%20of%20Karelia">Karelia</a>. The family was prohibited from living outside this province for the next 30 years and its members were bound by law to be employed only by the Russian state.

Witold's father, Julian Pilecki, was trained as a <a href="forester">forester</a> in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> and joined the <a href="Tsarist%20bureaucracy">Russian civil service</a>, taking a position as a senior inspector with the Board of National Forests in <a href="Republic%20of%20Karelia">Karelia</a>. He would eventually settle in the town of <a href="Olonets">Olonets</a> where he married Ludwika Pilecki née Osiecimska. Witold Pilecki was the fourth of the couple's five children. In 1910, Ludwika and the children left Karelia and relocated to the <a href="Northwestern%20Krai">Northwestern Krai</a>. After being joined by their father the family settled in <a href="Wilno">Wilno</a> (now: Vilnius, <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>), where Pilecki completed <a href="primary%20school">primary school</a> and became a member of the secret <a href="Zwi%C4%85zek%20Harcerstwa%20Polskiego">ZHP Scouts organization</a>. During the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, Wilno was <a href="Military%20occupation">occupied</a> by the <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German Army</a> on 5 September 1915 and was incorporated into <a href="Ober%20Ost">Ober Ost</a>, the German military administration. Pilecki and his family fled to <a href="Mogilev">Mogilev</a>, <a href="Belarus">Byelorussia</a>. In 1916 Pilecki moved to the Russian city of <a href="Oryol">Oryol</a>, where he attended <a href="Gymnasium%20%28school%29">gymnasium</a> and founded a local chapter of the ZHP group.

In 1918, following the outbreak of the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> and the defeat of the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a> in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Pilecki returned to <a href="Wilno">Wilno</a> (now part of the newly independent <a href="Polish%20Second%20Republic">Polish Second Republic</a>) and joined a ZHP Scout section of the <a href="Lithuanian%20and%20Belarusian%20Self-Defence">Lithuanian and Belarusian Self-Defense Militia</a>, a <a href="paramilitary">paramilitary</a> formation aligned with the <a href="White%20movement">White movement</a> under General <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Wejtko">Władysław Wejtko</a>. The militia disarmed the retreating German troops and took up positions to defend the city from a looming attack by the <a href="Soviet%20Red%20Army">Soviet Red Army</a>. However, Wilno fell to <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> forces on 5 January 1919, and Pilecki and his unit resorted to <a href="partisan%20warfare">partisan warfare</a> behind Soviet lines. He and his comrades then retreated to <a href="Bia%C5%82ystok">Białystok</a> where Pilecki enlisted as a "<a href="Private%20%28rank%29">szeregowy</a>" (private) in Poland's newly-established <a href="Volunteer%20Army%20%28Poland%29">volunteer army</a>. He took part in the <a href="Polish-Soviet%20War">Polish-Soviet War</a> of 1919–1921, serving under Captain <a href="Jerzy%20D%C4%85browski%20%28Lieutenant%20Colonel%29">Jerzy Dąbrowski</a>. He fought in the <a href="Kiev%20Offensive%20%281920%29">Kiev Offensive (1920)</a> and as part of a <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> unit defending the city of <a href="Grodno">Grodno</a>. On 5 August 1920, Pilecki joined the 211th <a href="Uhlan">Uhlan</a> Regiment and fought in the crucial <a href="Battle%20of%20Warsaw%20%281920%29">Battle of Warsaw</a> and in the Rudniki Forest ("Puszcza Rudnicka"). Pilecki later took part in the <a href="Vilna%20offensive">liberation of Wilno</a> and briefly served in the ongoing <a href="Polish-Lithuanian%20War">Polish-Lithuanian War</a> as a member of the October 1920 <a href="%C5%BBeligowski%27s%20Mutiny">Żeligowski rebellion</a>. He was twice awarded the <a href="Krzy%C5%BC%20Walecznych">Krzyż Walecznych</a> (Cross of Valor) for gallantry.

Following the conclusion of Polish-Soviet War in March 1921 Pilecki was transferred to the <a href="Military%20reserves">army reserves</a>. He was promoted to the rank of "<a href="plutonowy">plutonowy</a>" (<a href="corporal%20%28rank%29">corporal</a>) and was designated as a <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>. He went on to complete his <a href="secondary%20education">secondary education</a> ("<a href="matura">matura</a>") later that same year. In 1922 Pilecki briefly attended the <a href="University%20of%20Pozna%C5%84">University of Poznań</a> where he studied <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>. He soon returned to Wilno and enrolled with the <a href="Fine%20art">Faculty of Fine Arts</a> at <a href="University%20of%20Vilnius">Stefan Batory University</a>. Pilecki was forced to abandon his studies in 1924 due to both financial issues and the declining health of his father. He remained active in the military as a member of the <a href="military%20reserve">army reserves</a> and served as a military instructor in <a href="Nowe%20%C5%9Awi%C4%99cice">Nowe Święcice</a>. Pilecki later underwent <a href="Officer%20training">officer-training</a> at the Cavalry Reserve Officers' Training School in <a href="Grudzi%C4%85dz">Grudziądz</a>. Following his graduation Pilecki was assigned to the 26th Lancer Regiment in July 1925 with the rank of "<a href="Chor%C4%85%C5%BCy">Chorąży</a>" (<a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">ensign</a>). Pilecki would be promoted to "<a href="Podporucznik">Podporucznik</a>" (second lieutenant) the following year.

In September 1926 Pilecki became the owner of his family's ancestral estate, , in the <a href="Lida%20district">Lida district</a> of the <a href="Nowogr%C3%B3dek%20Voivodeship%20%281919%E2%80%931939%29">Nowogródek Voivodeship</a>. Pilecki rebuilt and modernized the property's <a href="manor%20house">manor house</a>, which had been destroyed during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. On 7 April 1931, he married Maria Pilecka née Ostrowska (19066 February 2002), a local school teacher originally from <a href="Narach%20%28town%29">Kupa</a> (Narach, currently Belarus). They had two children, born in Wilno: Andrzej (16 January 1932) and Zofia (14 March 1933). Pilecki and his family would later take up residence at Sukurcze. Pilecki developed a reputation as a community leader, a prominent <a href="social%20work">social work</a>er and amateur painter. He was also a vigorous advocate of <a href="rural%20development">rural development</a>, founding an <a href="agricultural%20cooperative">agricultural cooperative</a>, heading the local <a href="fire%20brigade">fire brigade</a> and also serving as chairman of a local <a href="Food%20processing">milk-processing plant</a> built in the district. In 1932 Pilecki established a cavalry training school in <a href="Lida">Lida</a>. Shortly afterward he was appointed commander of the newly-established <a href="Lida">1st Lidsky</a> <a href="Squadron%20%28army%29">Squadron</a>, a position he would hold until 1937, when this unit was absorbed into the <a href="Polish%2019th%20Infantry%20Division">Polish 19th Infantry Division</a>. In 1938, Pilecki received the Silver <a href="Cross%20of%20Merit%20%28Poland%29">Cross of Merit</a> for his community activism and his social work.

Pilecki was mobilized as a cavalry platoon commander on 26 August 1939. He was assigned to the 19th Infantry Division under General Józef Kwaciszewski, part of the Polish Army Prusy, and his unit took part in heavy fighting against the advancing Germans during the <a href="invasion%20of%20Poland">invasion of Poland</a>. The platoon was almost completely destroyed following a clash with the German forces on 10 September, and it withdrew to the southeast toward <a href="Lw%C3%B3w">Lwów</a> (now L'viv in Ukraine) and the <a href="Romanian%20bridgehead">Romanian bridgehead</a>. It was incorporated into the 41st Infantry Division, in which Pilecki served as divisional second-in-command under Major <a href="Jan%20W%C5%82odarkiewicz">Jan Włodarkiewicz</a>. He and his men destroyed seven German tanks, shot down one aircraft, and destroyed two more on the ground.

On 17 September, the Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland following the <a href="Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop%20Pact">Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact</a>. The Polish government formally surrendered to Nazi Germany on 27 September 1939, but Pilecki and many of his men continued fighting as partisans. His division was disbanded on 17 October, with parts of it surrendering to the enemy. Pilecki went into hiding in Warsaw with his commander Major Włodarkiewicz. On 9 November 1939, the two men founded the <a href="Secret%20Polish%20Army">Secret Polish Army</a> ("Tajna Armia Polska", TAP), one of the first underground organizations in Poland. Pilecki became organizational commander of TAP as it expanded to cover Warsaw, <a href="Siedlce">Siedlce</a>, <a href="Radom">Radom</a>, <a href="Lublin">Lublin</a>, and other major cities of central Poland.

By 1940, TAP had approximately 8,000 men, 20 machine guns, and several anti-tank rifles. To maintain his cover, Pilecki worked as a manager of a cosmetics storehouse. Later, TAP was incorporated into the <a href="Union%20for%20Armed%20Struggle">Union for Armed Struggle</a> ("Związek Walki Zbrojnej"), later renamed the Home Army ("Armia Krajowa", AK). Within the AK, TAP elements became the core of the "<a href="Wachlarz">Wachlarz</a>" unit.

In 1940, Pilecki presented a plan to his superiors to enter Germany's <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz concentration camp</a> at <a href="O%C5%9Bwi%C4%99cim">Oświęcim</a> to gather intelligence on the camp from the inside and organize inmate resistance. Little was known about how the Germans ran the camp, and it was thought to be an internment camp or large prison rather than a death camp. His superiors approved the plan and provided him with a false identity card in the name of "Tomasz Serafiński". He went out during a Warsaw street roundup on 19 September 1940 and was caught by the Germans along with 2,000 civilians, including <a href="Wladyslaw%20Bartoszewski">Wladyslaw Bartoszewski</a>. He was detained for two days in the Light Horse Guards Barracks, where prisoners suffered beatings with rubber truncheons, then sent to Auschwitz where he was assigned inmate number 4859. During his imprisonment, Pilecki was promoted by the Home Army to the rank of "Porucznik" (first lieutenant).
Pilecki organized the underground <a href="Zwi%C4%85zek%20Organizacji%20Wojskowej">Union of Military Organizations</a> (ZOW) at Auschwitz while working in various kommandos and surviving pneumonia. Many smaller <a href="Resistance%20movement%20in%20Auschwitz">underground organizations at Auschwitz</a> eventually merged with ZOW. ZOW's tasks were to improve inmate morale, provide news from outside, distribute extra food and clothing to members, set up intelligence networks, and train detachments to take over the camp in the event of a relief attack by the Home Army, arms airdrops, or an airborne landing by the Polish <a href="1st%20Independent%20Parachute%20Brigade%20%28Poland%29">1st Independent Parachute Brigade</a> based in Britain.

ZOW provided the Polish underground with invaluable information about the camp; they sent reports to Warsaw from October 1940, and the reports were forwarded via the Polish resistance to the British government in London beginning in March 1941. In 1942, Pilecki's resistance movement was also broadcasting details on the number of arrivals and deaths in the camp and the inmates' conditions using a radio transmitter that was built by camp inmates. The secret radio station was built over seven months using smuggled parts; it was broadcasting from the camp until the autumn of 1942, when it was dismantled by Pilecki's men after concerns that the Germans might discover its location because of "one of our fellows' big mouth".

These reports were a principal source of intelligence on Auschwitz for the Western Allies. Pilecki hoped that either the Allies would drop arms or troops into the camp, or that the Home Army would organize an assault on it from outside. Meanwhile, the Camp Gestapo under SS-Untersturmfuhrer <a href="Maximilian%20Grabner">Maximilian Grabner</a> redoubled its efforts to ferret out ZOW members, killing many of them. Pilecki decided to break out of the camp with the hope of convincing Home Army leaders personally that a rescue attempt was a valid option. He was assigned to a night shift at a camp bakery outside the fence, and he and two comrades overpowered a guard, cut the phone line, and escaped on the night of 26/27 April 1943, taking with them documents stolen from the Germans.

After several days as a fugitive Pilecki made contact with units of the <a href="Home%20Army">Home Army</a>. On 25 August 1943, Pilecki reached Warsaw and was attached to <a href="Second%20Department%20of%20Polish%20General%20Staff">Section II</a> (intelligence and counter-intelligence) of the <a href="District%20of%20Warsaw%20%28of%20Armia%20Krajowa%29">Home Army's regional headquarters</a>. After losing several operatives reconnoitering the vicinity of Auschwitz, including the <a href="Cichociemni">Cichociemny</a> Stefan Jasieński, it was decided that the Home Army lacked sufficient strength to liberate the camp without Allied help. Pilecki's detailed report ("Raport Witolda" – <a href="Witold%27s%20Report">Witold's Report</a>) estimated that "By March 1943 the number of people gassed on arrival reached 1.5 million", which was remarkably accurate considering post-war estimates suggest 1.1 million people died in Auschwitz during the war.

On 11 November 1943, Pilecki was promoted to "<a href="Rotmistrz">Rotmistrz</a>" (cavalry captain) and joined a secret anti-communist organization, <a href="NIE%20%28resistance%29">NIE</a> (in Polish: "NO or NIEpodległość – INdependence"), formed as a clandestine unit within the Home Army with the goal of preparing resistance against a possible Soviet occupation. The <a href="Red%20Army">Soviet Red Army</a>, despite being within attacking distance of the camp, showed no interest in a joint effort with the Home Army and the ZOW to free it. Until he became involved in the <a href="Warsaw%20Uprising">Warsaw Uprising</a>, Pilecki remained in charge of coordinating ZOW and AK activities and provided what limited support he was able to offer to ZOW.

When the <a href="Warsaw%20Uprising">Warsaw Uprising</a> broke out on 1 August 1944, Pilecki volunteered for service with <a href="Kedyw">Kedyw</a>'s <a href="Chrobry%20II%20Battalion">Chrobry II Battalion</a>. At first, Pilecki served as a common soldier in the northern city center, without revealing his actual rank to his superiors. Later, after many officers were killed in the fierce fighting that occurred during the early days of the uprising, Pilecki disclosed his true identity to his superiors and accepted command of the 1st "Warszawianka" Company located in <a href="%C5%9Ar%C3%B3dmie%C5%9Bcie%2C%20Warsaw">Śródmieście</a> in downtown Warsaw. Pilecki fought under the <a href="nom%20de%20guerre">nom de guerre</a> "Captain Roman".

After the capitulation of the uprising, Pilecki hid a cache of weapons in a private apartment and surrendered to the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> on 5 October 1944. He was sent to Germany and imprisoned at <a href="Stalag%20VIII-B">Stalag VIII-B</a>, a prisoner-of-war camp near <a href="%C5%81ambinowice">Lamsdorf</a>, <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a>. He was later transferred to <a href="Oflag%20VII-A">Oflag VII-A</a> in <a href="Murnau%20am%20Staffelsee">Murnau</a>, <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> where he was eventually liberated by troops of the <a href="12th%20Armored%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">US 12th Armored Division</a> on 28 April 1945.

In July 1945 he left Murnau and was reassigned to the <a href="military%20intelligence">military intelligence</a> division of the <a href="Polish%20II%20Corps">Polish II Corps</a> under General <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Anders">Władysław Anders</a> in <a href="Ancona">Ancona</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. While stationed there Pilecki began writing a <a href="monograph">monograph</a> on his experiences at Auschwitz.

In October 1945, as relations between the <a href="Polish%20government-in-exile">Polish government-in-exile</a> and the <a href="Polish%20Committee%20of%20National%20Liberation">Soviet-backed regime</a> of <a href="Boleslaw%20Bierut">Boleslaw Bierut</a> deteriorated, Pilecki was ordered by General Anders and his intelligence chief, Lt. Colonel , to return to Poland and report on the prevailing military and political situation under <a href="Northern%20Group%20of%20Forces">Soviet-occupation</a>.

Pilecki arrived in Warsaw in December 1945 and proceeded to begin organizing an <a href="intelligence%20gathering%20network">intelligence gathering network</a>, which included several wartime associates from <a href="Resistance%20movement%20in%20Auschwitz">Auschwitz</a> and the <a href="Secret%20Polish%20Army">Secret Polish Army</a> (TAP).

To maintain his cover identity, Pilecki lived under various assumed names and changed jobs frequently. He would work as a jewelry salesman, a <a href="Wine%20label">bottle label</a> painter and as night manager of a construction warehouse. Nevertheless, Pilecki was informed in July 1946 that his actual identity had been uncovered by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Public%20Security%20%28Poland%29">MBP</a>. He was ordered to leave the country, but he refused to do so.

In April 1947, he began independently collecting evidence of <a href="Soviet%20war%20crimes">Soviet atrocities</a> committed in Poland during the <a href="Territories%20of%20Poland%20annexed%20by%20the%20Soviet%20Union">1939–1941 occupation</a> as well as evidence of the unlawful arrest and prosecution of <a href="Home%20Army">Home Army</a> veterans and ex-members of the <a href="Polish%20Armed%20Forces%20in%20the%20West">Polish Armed Forces in the West</a>, which often resulted in execution or imprisonment.

Pilecki was arrested by agents of the Ministry of Public Security on 8 May 1947, and he was repeatedly tortured before going to trial. The investigation of his activities was supervised by Colonel <a href="Roman%20Romkowski">Roman Romkowski</a>. He was interrogated by Col. <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20R%C3%B3%C5%BCa%C5%84ski">Józef Różański</a> and lieutenants S. Łyszkowski, W. Krawczyński, J. Kroszel, T. Słowianek, Eugeniusz Chimczak, and S. Alaborski—men who were infamous for their savagery. But Pilecki sought to protect other prisoners and revealed no sensitive information.

A show trial took place on 3 March 1948, and testimony against Pilecki was presented by future Polish prime minister <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Cyrankiewicz">Józef Cyrankiewicz</a>, himself an Auschwitz survivor. Pilecki was charged with illegal border crossing, use of forged documents, not enlisting with the military, carrying illegal arms, espionage for General <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Anders">Władysław Anders</a>, espionage for "foreign imperialism" (British intelligence), and planning to assassinate several officials of the Ministry of Public Security of Poland. Pilecki denied the assassination charges, as well as espionage, although he admitted to passing information to the <a href="2nd%20Polish%20Corps">2nd Polish Corps</a>, of which he considered himself an officer and thus claimed that he was not breaking any laws. He pleaded guilty to the other charges. He was sentenced to death on 15 May with three of his comrades, and he was executed with a shot to the back of the head at the <a href="Mokot%C3%B3w%20Prison">Mokotów Prison</a> in Warsaw on 25 May 1948 by Staff Sergeant <a href="Piotr%20%C5%9Amieta%C5%84ski">Piotr Śmietański</a> (who was nicknamed "The Butcher of Mokotow Prison" by the inmates).

Pilecki's place of burial has never been found but is thought to be somewhere within Warsaw's <a href="Pow%C4%85zki%20Cemetery">Powązki Cemetery</a>. After the fall of Communism in Poland, a cenotaph was erected in his memory at Ostrowa Mazowiecka Cemetery. In 2012, Powązki Cemetery was partially excavated in an effort to find his remains.

Pilecki's show trial and execution was part of a wider campaign of repression against former Home Army members and others connected with the Polish government in exile in London. In 2003, prosecutor Czesław Łapiński and several others involved in the trial were charged with complicity in Pilecki's murder. Chief prosecution witness <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Cyrankiewicz">Józef Cyrankiewicz</a> was already dead, and Łapiński died in 2004 before the trial was concluded.
Pilecki and all others sentenced in the show trial were rehabilitated on 1 October 1990. He was awarded the Order of <a href="Polonia%20Restituta">Polonia Restituta</a> in 1995, and he received the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20White%20Eagle%20%28Poland%29">Order of the White Eagle</a> in 2006, the highest Polish decoration. On 6 September 2013, he was promoted to Colonel by the Minister of National Defence.

Films about Pilecki include "Śmierć rotmistrza Pileckiego" (The Death of Captain Pilecki, 2006) starring Marek Probosz, "Pilecki" (2015) starring Mateusz Bieryt, and the documentaries "Against the Odds: Resistance in Nazi Concentration Camps" (2004) and "Heroes of War: Poland" (2014) produced by Sky Vision for the History Channel UK. A number of books have been written about him, and his comprehensive 1945 report on his undercover mission at Auschwitz was published in English in 2012 under the title "The Auschwitz Volunteer: Beyond Bravery". "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called it "a historical document of the greatest importance".

United States Bicentennial coinage

The United States Bicentennial coinage was a set of <a href="List%20of%20circulating%20currencies">circulating</a> commemorative <a href="coin">coin</a>s, consisting of a <a href="Quarter%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">quarter</a>, <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a> and <a href="Dollar%20coin%20%28United%20States%29">dollar</a> struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> in 1975 and 1976. Regardless of when struck, each coin bears the double date 1776–1976 on the normal <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverses</a> for the <a href="Washington%20quarter">Washington quarter</a>, <a href="Kennedy%20half%20dollar">Kennedy half dollar</a> and <a href="Eisenhower%20dollar">Eisenhower dollar</a>. No coins dated 1975 of any of the three denominations were minted.

Given past abuses in the system, the Mint advocated against the issuance of <a href="United%20States%20commemorative%20coin">commemorative coins</a> starting in the 1950s. Beginning in 1971, members of Congress introduced bills to authorize coins to honor the <a href="United%20States%20Bicentennial">United States Bicentennial</a>, which would occur in 1976. The Mint, through its director, <a href="Mary%20Brooks">Mary Brooks</a>, initially opposed such proposals, but later supported them, and Congress passed legislation requiring the temporary redesign of the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">reverse</a> of the quarter, half dollar and dollar.

A nationwide competition resulted in designs of a Colonial drummer for the quarter, <a href="Independence%20Hall%20%28United%20States%29">Independence Hall</a> for the half dollar and the <a href="Liberty%20Bell">Liberty Bell</a> superimposed against the moon for the dollar. All three coins remain common today due to the quantity struck. Circulation pieces were in copper nickel; Congress also mandated 45,000,000 part-silver pieces be struck for collectors. The Mint sold over half of the part-silver coins before melting the remainder after withdrawing them from sale in 1986.

<a href="Commemorative%20coin">Commemorative coin</a>s had been struck for a number of events and anniversaries by the United States Mint since 1892. Organizations would get Congress to authorize a coin and would be allowed to buy up the issue, selling it to the public at a premium. The final issue among <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">these commemoratives</a>, half dollars honoring <a href="Booker%20T.%20Washington">Booker T. Washington</a> and <a href="George%20Washington%20Carver">George Washington Carver</a> were struck over a number of years, and were discontinued in 1954. Originally priced at $3.50, they were repeatedly discounted; many could not be sold at a premium and entered circulation. The promoter of these issues, S.J. Phillips, mishandled the distribution and lost $140,000. The negative publicity caused the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">Department of the Treasury</a>, of which the Mint is a part, to oppose subsequent commemorative coin proposals, and until the 1970s, Congress passed none.

In 1966, Congress established the American Revolutionary Bicentennial Commission (ARBC) to plan and coordinate activities connected with the 1976 bicentennial of American Independence ("the Bicentennial"). In February 1970, the ARBC established a Coins and Medals Advisory Committee. The committee's initial report, in July 1970, called for the production of a commemorative half dollar for the Bicentennial. In December 1970, the committee called for special designs for all denominations of US coinage for the Bicentennial; the ARBC endorsed this position the following month. The Treasury, however, opposed the change, following its longstanding position against commemorative coins. Several proposals for Bicentennial coins were introduced in Congress in 1971 and 1972, but did not pass.

Mint Director <a href="Mary%20Brooks">Mary Brooks</a> had attended the Advisory Committee meetings. At one meeting, she supported having a 1776–1976 double date on circulating coins to mark the anniversary in 1976, although accommodating two dates on the obverse would involve production difficulties. However, in a newspaper interview she termed the idea of changing the six circulating coins (cent through dollar) "a disaster". She felt if any Bicentennial coin was issued, it should be non-circulating, perhaps a <a href="half%20cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half cent</a> or a gold piece. Brooks believed that such a coin would not disrupt the Mint in the production of coins for circulation. During 1972, however, she retreated from that position, and by the end of the year had persuaded <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="George%20Shultz">George Shultz</a> to support a Bicentennial coin bill.

In January 1973, <a href="Texas">Texas</a> Representative <a href="Richard%20C.%20White">Richard C. White</a> introduced legislation for commemorative dollars and half dollars. <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> Senator <a href="Mark%20Hatfield">Mark Hatfield</a> also put forward a bill, calling for a $25 <a href="gold%20coin">gold piece</a>. On March 2, 1973, the Treasury announced its support for Bicentennial coin legislation for design changes to the reverses of the circulating dollars and half dollars, and sent proposed legislation to Congress three days later. Hearings before a subcommittee in the House of Representatives were held on May 2, 1973. Brooks testified, supporting the limited redesign in the bill, but opposing a more extensive coin redesign. Separately from the Bicentennial matter, she asked for authority to strike US coins at the <a href="West%20Point%20Mint">West Point Bullion Depository</a>, where space was available to install older coinage presses. Brooks deprecated the Hatfield proposal, stating that the coin would have to be .667 pure or less to avoid hoarding.

As a result of the hearings, several additional bills were introduced, and additional hearings were held before a Senate subcommittee on June 6. Brooks testified again, and responding to criticism that only the two least popular denominations were to be changed, indicated her support for a Bicentennial quarter as well. On June 13, a bill, S. 1141 which provided for a circulating Bicentennial quarter, half dollar and dollar, gave permission for coins to be struck at West Point and allowed for 40% silver <a href="clad%20coinage">clad</a> versions of the new coins for collectors was reported favorably by the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Banking%2C%20Housing%2C%20and%20Urban%20Affairs">Senate Banking Committee</a>. It passed the Senate on July 13. However, amendments authorizing US citizens to own gold, and to implement the Hatfield proposal were attached to the bill. A similar bill passed the House of Representatives on September 12, differing from the Senate bill in lacking any provision relating to gold, and in not authorizing silver versions of the new coins.

Members of the two houses met in a <a href="United%20States%20congressional%20conference%20committee">conference committee</a> on September 19 in a session described by onlookers as "fairly hot and heavy". The resulting bill had no gold provisions, but authorized changes to the reverses of the quarter, half dollar and dollar for the Bicentennial. The obverses of the three coins would not change, but would bear the double date 1776–1976. By the terms of the statute, all coins minted to be issued after July 4, 1975 and before January 1, 1977 would bear the Bicentennial dates and designs. Congress directed the Mint to strike 45,000,000 silver clad coins (that is, 15,000,000 sets), and the Mint received the requested authority to strike coins at West Point. Circulation quarters, half dollars and dollars would continue to be of copper nickel bonded to an internal layer of copper, that is, copper nickel clad. The modified bill passed both houses of Congress on October 4, 1973, and the bill was signed into law by President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> on October 18. Hatfield's measure, along with similar legislation from other senators, was reintroduced in 1975, but died in committee, as did legislation seeking a Bicentennial two-cent piece and a bill seeking a coin honoring <a href="Abigail%20Adams">Abigail Adams</a> and <a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony">Susan B. Anthony</a>. The extra production at West Point was key to overcoming a shortage of cents in 1974, and permitted the Mint greater flexibility as it geared up to strike the Bicentennial pieces.

On October 23, 1973, the Department of the Treasury announced a competition for the three reverse designs. Any US citizen could submit one drawing, or photograph of a plaster model in diameter. Submissions were to include the legend "". Treasury Secretary Shultz, advised by a panel of judges, would decide which design would be used for which denomination—the inscription would be changed to and for the higher denominations. Additionally, the reverses were to bear the name of the country and the motto "", as required by law.

At Director Brooks' request, the <a href="National%20Sculpture%20Society">National Sculpture Society</a> selected the five judges for the competition. The judges were society President <a href="Robert%20Weinman">Robert Weinman</a> (son of <a href="Adolph%20Weinman">Adolph Weinman</a>, who had designed the <a href="Mercury%20dime">Mercury dime</a> and <a href="Walking%20Liberty%20half%20dollar">Walking Liberty half dollar</a>), Connecticut sculptor Adlai S. Hardin, former Mint Chief Engraver <a href="Gilroy%20Roberts">Gilroy Roberts</a>, Julius Lauth of the <a href="Medallic%20Art%20Company">Medallic Art Company</a>, and Elvira Clain-Stefanelli, curator in the Division of <a href="Numismatics">Numismatics</a>, <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>.

The deadline was originally December 14, 1973, but was extended to January 9, 1974 because of <a href="1973%20oil%20crisis">the energy crisis</a> and Christmas mail delays. Brooks traveled more than to publicize the competition. By the deadline, the Mint had received 15,000 inquiries and 884 entries. Members of the panel and any person employed by the US government as a sculptor were ineligible to enter. The prize for each of the three winners was $5,000. The judging was originally supposed to take place at West Point; with the delay, it took place instead at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>.

From the entries, the judges selected twelve semifinalist designs; the sculptor submitting each received a prize of $750. The competitors were to place their work on plaster models, if that had not already been done, and were offered assistance in making the models.

The twelve remaining designs were released by the Treasury for public comment in early 1974. Two of the proposed coins featured sailing ships, two featured <a href="Independence%20Hall%20%28United%20States%29">Independence Hall</a> in Philadelphia, where the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a> was signed, and three depicted the moon or lunar spacecraft. Another depicted the <a href="Liberty%20Bell">Liberty Bell</a> superimposed on an atomic symbol. According to numismatist Michael Marotta in his 2001 article on the Bicentennial coins, "the numismatic community's reaction to the entries was predictable: everyone complained by writing letters to the editor".

From the twelve, the judges selected six finalists for review by the National Bicentennial Coin Design Competition Committee, consisting of Brooks, Representative <a href="Wright%20Patman">Wright Patman</a>, Senator <a href="John%20Sparkman">John Sparkman</a>, <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> Secretary Charles H. Atherton and <a href="Eric%20P.%20Newman">Eric P. Newman</a>, chairman of the ARBC's coins and medals advisory committee. After receiving the committee's recommendations, Secretary Shultz selected the winners and on March 6, 1974, Brooks went on the "<a href="Today%20%28NBC%20program%29">Today</a>" show to announce them. Jack L. Ahr's design featuring a colonial drummer, with a torch of victory surrounded by thirteen stars (representing the original states) was selected for the quarter. Seth Huntington's image of Independence Hall was selected for the half dollar while Dennis R. Williams' superimposition of the Liberty Bell against the moon was successful for the dollar. Ahr owned a commercial art firm and Huntington was head artist for <a href="Brown%20and%20Bigelow">Brown and Bigelow</a>, a <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> publishing firm. Williams, at age 21 the youngest person to design a US coin, was an art student who had originally created his design for a class assignment. No change would be made to the obverses of the coins, except for the double dating.

Ahr was accused of copying his drummer from a 1973 stamp by the stamp's designer, William A. Smith; he denied it. According to numismatic historian <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, "both obviously derive from <a href="Archibald%20Willard">Archibald Willard</a>'s 1876 painting "Spirit of '76"," a painting which numismatic author David L. Ganz suggests that both undoubtedly saw sometime in their lives. Ahr, however, stated that his son had been the model for the drummer. Brooks, in a letter to Smith, stated that the design for the quarter was "sufficiently original" to impress the National Sculpture Society. Weinman later deprecated the winning designs:
I really don't think what we got was a great bargain. Nothing we selected was a real winner that I'd fight to the death for. In terms of what we had to work with, though, I think we did the best we could.
On April 24, 1974, the three winning designers were brought to Washington, D.C. After a tour of the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> and meetings with the congressional committees which considered the coin bills, they went to the <a href="Treasury%20Building%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">Treasury Building</a> and received their $5,000 checks from the new Treasury Secretary, <a href="William%20E.%20Simon">William E. Simon</a>, who jokingly asked them if they wanted to invest their awards in <a href="savings%20bond">savings bond</a>s.

Mint Chief Engraver <a href="Frank%20Gasparro">Frank Gasparro</a> made minor changes to all three reverse designs. Gasparro simplified the quarter design, altered the drum for the sake of authenticity, changed the lettering and modified the expression on the drummer's face. He made slight changes to Independence Hall on the half dollar and altered the lettering on the dollar to facilitate the metal flow during stamping and asked the designer to straighten the bottom edge of the Liberty Bell. Ahr later stated that he would have liked more time to finalize his design, wishing to clarify the features of the drummer's face. The initials of the designer were added to the design by the Mint. All three agreed that Gasparro's changes improved their designs.

On August 12, 1974, the three designers were at the Philadelphia Mint, where they ceremonially operated the presses to strike the first coins bearing their designs. These prototypes were exhibited under armed guard at the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a> convention in Florida the next day. They differ from all other Bicentennial coins in that they were struck in silver proof without <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a>; other silver proof coins bear an "S" mint mark as struck at the San Francisco Assay Office (as the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a> was then known). Coins struck at Denver bear a "D" on the obverse; pieces lacking a mint mark were struck at Philadelphia. Sets of these prototypes were presented to President <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a>, <a href="Counselor%20to%20the%20President">Counselor to the President</a> <a href="Anne%20Armstrong">Anne Armstrong</a> and Director <a href="John%20Warner">John Warner</a> of the American Revolutionary Bicentennial Administration (the successor to the ARBC). All other first strikes were melted, with copies not even kept for the <a href="National%20Numismatic%20Collection">National Numismatic Collection</a>.

The Mint believed that if it was required to strike 1975 quarters, half dollars and dollars, not enough could be struck before it had to begin the Bicentennial issues to prevent the 1975 pieces from becoming collector's items. This risked coin shortages at a time when the Mint was seeking to build a surplus of quarters. Mint officials returned to Congress to seek amending legislation. President Ford signed a bill on December 26, 1974 that made several noncontroversial changes to law, including provisions to allow the Mint to keep striking 1974-dated pieces until it began striking the Bicentennial coins. By terms of the amending legislation, the commemorative coins could not be issued until after July 4, 1975.

On November 15, 1974, the Mint began taking orders for the silver clad pieces, at a price of $15 for proof sets and $9 for uncirculated, with a deadline for orders of January 31, 1975. Uncirculated coins are like those newly released into circulation; proof coins have a mirror finish. Buyers were initially limited to five sets per person. On January 19, 1975, Brooks announced that the silver proof set price was cut to $12, and the order limit was waived. Buyers who had paid the higher price were sent refunds by check. Brooks stated that the price reduction was because of production efficiencies, the benefit of which she wished to pass along to the public. Numismatic columnist Ed Reiter noted, though, that the reduction came amidst protests from the numismatic community that the price was too high. Coin dealer Herby Skelton suggested in 1977 that the initial high price for the sets followed by the reduction, together with the large mintage of silver sets made the public suspicious and contributed to lagging sales. On August 20, 1975, the price for the uncirculated silver sets was reduced to $7 when bulk purchases of 50 or more were made. A bank in Taiwan ordered 250,000 sets at this price.

The first Bicentennial coins to be produced that were intended for the public were dollars, struck during February 1975. The first for collectors were struck at San Francisco on April 23, 1975. The San Francisco Assay Office struck the 45,000,000 silver coins first, producing eleven million sets in uncirculated and four million in proof, then began the base metal pieces. Once striking began, the Mint found that the copper nickel dollar was striking indistinctly, a problem not seen with the silver pieces. The Mint modified the dies; the most noticeable change is that the revised issue, or Type II as it came to be known, have narrower, sharper lettering on the reverse. All silver pieces (struck only at San Francisco) are Type I; all three mints struck both Type I and Type II copper nickel pieces. All dollars included in 1975 proof sets are Type I; all those included in 1976 proof sets are Type II. Bicentennial coins for collectors were not delivered until after July 4, 1975. The Bicentennial pieces, in base metal, were included in 1975 proof sets and mint sets together with 1975-dated cents, nickels and dimes.

The new coins first entered circulation on July 7, 1975, when the half dollar was released in conjunction with ceremonies in Minneapolis, Huntington's hometown. The quarter followed in September and the dollar in October, each also with ceremonies to mark the issuance. The pieces were struck in numbers exceeding those needed for circulation; a Mint spokesman stated, "The theory in striking them was to have enough available so as many Americans as possible would have an opportunity to have a coinage commemoration of the Bicentennial year. They're momentos."

In 1977, the Mint returned to the old reverse designs for the quarter, half dollar and dollar. Sales by mid-1977 had dropped off considerably, to perhaps 300 sets a week, with one Mint official describing the sales against the massive unsold quantities as "a drop in the bucket". By 1979, the Mint anticipated an eventual sellout for the silver proof set, but admitted that with massive quantities unsold, there was no realistic possibility of selling all uncirculated silver sets. On September 17, 1979, faced with <a href="Silver%20Thursday">a spike in silver prices</a>, Mint Director <a href="Stella%20Hackel%20Sims">Stella B. Hackel</a> announced that the sets were being removed from sale. They were returned to sale in August 1980, at increased prices of $20 in proof and $15 in uncirculated. In September 1981, the Mint, citing a decline in the price of silver, reduced the price of the sets to $15 in proof and $12 in uncirculated. A limit of 100 sets per person was set on proof sales, with none on uncirculated. A large number of sets were melted by the government in 1982. <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Reagan</a> administration Mint Director <a href="Donna%20Pope">Donna Pope</a> later stated,
"Sales of 1776–1976 regular-issue Bicentennial coins went on and on, seemingly forever." On December 31, 1986, the remaining Bicentennial uncirculated silver sets were removed from sale. At the time, it was announced that proof sets had already sold out when coins went off sale. However, Marotta, writing in 2001, stated that when sales ceased, 400,000 proof sets and 200,000 uncirculated sets remained in inventory.

Due to the large quantities struck, Bicentennial coins remain inexpensive. A set of three silver coins contains .5381 troy ounces of the precious metal. In a 1996 statistical study, T.V. Buttrey found that about 750,000,000 of the circulation quarters, more than a third, had been hoarded and did not circulate. Coin dealer Marcel Sassola suggested in 1977 of the silver sets, "There were just too many sold, and I think it will take a long time before they have any real value. Maybe by the Tricentennial."

The Eisenhower dollar is a one-dollar coin issued by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> from 1971 to 1978; it was the first <a href="dollar%20coin%20%28United%20States%29">coin of that denomination</a> issued by the Mint since the <a href="Peace%20dollar">Peace dollar</a> series ended in 1935. The coin depicts <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> on the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a>, and a stylized image honoring the 1969 <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a> Moon mission on the reverse, with both sides designed by <a href="Frank%20Gasparro">Frank Gasparro</a>.

In 1965, because of rises in bullion prices, the Mint began to strike copper-nickel <a href="cladding%20%28metalworking%29">clad</a> coins instead of silver. No dollar coins had been issued in thirty years, but beginning in 1969, legislators sought to reintroduce a dollar coin into commerce. After Eisenhower died that March, there were a number of proposals to honor him with the new coin. While these bills generally commanded wide support, enactment was delayed by a dispute over whether the new coin should be in base metal or 40% silver. In 1970, a compromise was reached to strike the Eisenhower dollar in base metal for circulation, and in 40% silver as a collectible. President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, who had served as <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice president</a> under Eisenhower, signed legislation authorizing mintage of the new coin on December 31, 1970.

Although the collector's pieces sold well, the new dollars failed to circulate to any degree, except in and around <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> casinos, where they took the place of privately issued tokens. There are no dollars dated 1975; coins from that year and from 1976 bear a double date 1776–1976, and a special reverse by Dennis R. Williams in honor of the <a href="United%20States%20Bicentennial">bicentennial of American independence</a>. Beginning in 1977, the Mint sought to replace the Eisenhower dollar with a smaller-sized piece. Congress authorized the <a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony%20dollar">Susan B. Anthony dollar</a>, struck beginning in 1979, but that coin also failed to circulate. Given their modest cost and the short length of the series, complete sets of Eisenhower dollars are becoming more popular among coin collectors.

The silver dollar had never been a popular coin, circulating little except in the West; it served as a means of monetizing metal and generally sat in bank vaults once struck. The <a href="Peace%20dollar">Peace dollar</a>, the last circulating dollar made of silver, was not struck after 1935, and in most years in the quarter century after that, the bullion value of a silver dollar did not exceed 70 cents. In the early 1960s, though, silver prices rose, and the huge stocks of silver dollars in the hands of banks and the government were obtained by the public through the redemption of <a href="Silver%20certificate%20%28United%20States%29">silver certificates</a>. This caused shortages of silver dollars in the western states where the pieces circulated, and interests there sought the issuance of more dollars.

On August 3, 1964, <a href="88th%20United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> passed legislation providing for the striking of 45 million silver dollars. This legislation was enacted when coins vanished from circulation as the price of silver rose past $1.29 per ounce, making silver dollars worth more as bullion than as currency. The new pieces were intended to be used at Nevada casinos and elsewhere in the West where "hard money" was popular. Numismatic periodicals complained that striking the dollars was a waste of resources. The law had been passed at the urging of the <a href="Senate%20Majority%20Leader">Senate Majority Leader</a>, <a href="Mike%20Mansfield">Mike Mansfield</a> (Democrat–Montana), who represented a state that heavily used silver dollars. Despite the efforts of Mint Director <a href="Eva%20Adams">Eva Adams</a> and her staff to persuade him, Senator Mansfield refused to consider any cancellation or delay, and on May 12, 1965 the <a href="Denver%20Mint">Denver Mint</a> began striking 1964-D Peace dollars—the Mint had obtained congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.

A public announcement of the new pieces was made on May 15, 1965, only to be met with a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources at a time of severe coin shortages, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 pieces had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure that there would be no repetition, <a href="89th%20United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> inserted a provision in the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201965">Coinage Act of 1965</a> forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. That act also removed silver from the dime and quarter, and reduced the silver content of the half dollar to 40%.

In 1969, <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Nixon administration</a> Mint Director <a href="Mary%20Brooks">Mary Brooks</a> sought the reissuance of the dollar coin. By this time, rising bullion prices threatened the continued use of silver in the <a href="Kennedy%20half%20dollar">Kennedy half dollar</a>, but Brooks hoped to maintain the dollar as a silver coin. Brooks' proposal for a new silver dollar was opposed by the chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Financial%20Services">House Banking Committee</a>, <a href="Wright%20Patman">Wright Patman</a>, who had been persuaded, against his better judgment, by Nixon's predecessor, <a href="Lyndon%20Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a>, to support the continued use of silver in the half dollar.

On March 28, 1969, former president and World War II general <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> died. Soon after, New Jersey Representative <a href="Florence%20Dwyer">Florence Dwyer</a>, like Eisenhower, a Republican, suggested that the proposed dollar coin bear his likeness. She spoke to Democratic Missouri Representative <a href="Leonor%20Sullivan">Leonor Sullivan</a>, who agreed that the dollar should bear a portrait of Eisenhower as "equal time" to the half dollar, which bore the likeness of Democratic president <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>. A bill was filed by Connecticut Congressman <a href="Robert%20N.%20Giaimo">Robert N. Giaimo</a> to authorize an Eisenhower dollar, to be struck without silver content. The <a href="Joint%20Commission%20on%20the%20Coinage">Joint Commission on the Coinage</a>, drawing members from the administration and from Congress, including Giaimo, recommended the dollar in spring 1969. It also called for the elimination of silver from the half dollar, and for the transfer from the Treasury to the <a href="General%20Services%20Administration">General Services Administration</a> (GSA) of quantities of rare silver dollars, so they could be sold. Giaimo noted that the coin would be useful in casinos, which were striking their own tokens in the absence of circulating dollar coins, and in the vending industry, which was starting to sell higher-priced items.

On October 3, 1969, the House Banking Committee passed legislation for a silverless Eisenhower dollar, with Patman stating that he hoped to have it approved by the full House in time for the late president's birthday on October 14. On October 6, the bill's sponsors lost a procedural vote which would have allowed for no amendments. While some representatives spoke against the manner in which the legislation was to be considered, Iowa Congressman <a href="H.%20R.%20Gross">H. R. Gross</a> objected to the base-metal composition of the proposed coin: "You would be doing the memory of President Eisenhower no favor to mint a dollar made perhaps of scrap metal." Both houses voted on October 14, Eisenhower's birthday. Although the House passed the administration-backed bill for a base metal dollar, the Senate passed the bill as amended by Colorado Senator <a href="Peter%20Dominick">Peter Dominick</a>, calling for the piece to be minted in 40% silver. Instrumental in the passage of the Senate amendment was a letter from <a href="Mamie%20Eisenhower">Mamie Eisenhower</a>, recalling that her husband had liked to give silver dollars as mementoes, and had gone to some effort to obtain coins struck in the year of his birth, 1890. Idaho Senator <a href="James%20A.%20McClure">James McClure</a> stated, "It is somehow beneath the dignity of a great president like General Eisenhower to withhold silver from the coin." On October 29, 1969, Texas Representative <a href="Robert%20R.%20Casey">Robert R. Casey</a> introduced legislation to honor both Eisenhower and the recent <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a> <a href="Moon%20landing">Moon landing</a>. These provisions would become part of the enacted bill authorizing the Eisenhower dollar. Casey originally wanted the mission theme of Apollo 11, "We came in peace for all mankind," to appear on the coin; when the Mint informed him that there was not room for that inscription, he settled for requiring that the reverse design be emblematic of that theme.

In March 1970, the two houses reached a compromise whereby 150 million dollars would be struck in the 40% silver alloy for collectors and others. The circulating dollar, though, would have no silver and would be struck in larger quantities. The 47.4 million troy ounces of silver needed to strike the collectors' pieces would come from bullion already held by the government. The compromise was worked out by McClure and other congressional Republicans, with the aid of Brooks, an Idahoan. McClure described the deal as "a lot less than the country deserves, but a lot more than it appeared we would get." The reason for having a collector's edition with silver was to avoid the hoarding which had driven the Kennedy half dollar from circulation.

Although the compromise passed the Senate in March 1970, it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who was determined to end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a <a href="rider%20%28legislation%29">rider</a> to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a <a href="conference%20committee">conference committee</a> and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as <a href="91st%20United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> had adjourned, not signing the bill would <a href="pocket%20veto">pocket veto</a> it, on December 31, 1970, Nixon hastily signed it only minutes before the midnight deadline.

For Mint Chief Engraver <a href="Frank%20Gasparro">Frank Gasparro</a>, the opportunity to put Eisenhower on a coin was the fulfillment of a longtime dream. On June 19, 1945, Gasparro had been one of more than 4 million people who gathered in New York to watch a parade celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. Although Gasparro, then an assistant engraver at the Mint, only saw a glimpse of General Eisenhower, he stepped back from the crowd and drew the general's features. That sketch served as the basis of his design for the obverse. Gasparro consulted with the late president's widow, <a href="Mamie%20Eisenhower">Mamie Eisenhower</a>, as to the designs of both sides of the coin; the former <a href="First%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States">First Lady</a> was presented with a galvano (a metallic model used in the coin design process) by Brooks and Gasparro on January 1, 1971. Gasparro wrote in 1991 that he had six weeks to complete the work beginning in mid-November 1970, that his extensive research into eagles over the years was a great help in creating the reverse, and that his sketches were adopted without change. The chief engraver was not given full freedom of design; he was instructed to have the layout of the obverse resemble that of the <a href="Washington%20quarter">Washington quarter</a>.

Before the legislation passed, Gasparro had prepared two reverses, the one actually used, and a reverse with a more formal <a href="spreadeagle%20%28heraldry%29">heraldic eagle</a>, which numismatic historian and coin dealer <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> finds reminiscent of <a href="pattern%20coin">pattern coin</a>s prepared in the 1870s. At Congress's insistence, the chief engraver created a design in commemoration of the <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a> lunar landing, based on the <a href="mission%20patch">mission patch</a> conceived by astronaut <a href="Michael%20Collins%20%28astronaut%29">Michael Collins</a> and others. Bowers deems the choice of the lunar landing "a stroke of genius," allowing the dollar, which would be little-used in commerce, to be a commemorative both of Eisenhower and of the Moon mission. The reverse depicts an eagle (representing the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">lunar lander</a>, "Eagle") swooping low over the Moon's surface, holding an olive branch, token of peace, in its claws.

The use of Collins' mission patch design had initially been opposed by some government officials because of the fierce expression of the eagle; Gasparro's initial concept met similar objections. The Mint Director recalled that Gasparro had gone to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Zoo">Philadelphia Zoo</a> to look at eagles, and on his return had prepared a design which she felt emphasized the eagle's predatory nature. Brooks informed Gasparro that the eagle was "too fierce, too warlike, a little too aggressive" and asked that the expression be made friendlier. Gasparro, who reportedly was unhappy at having to change the eagle, described the final version as "pleasant looking." The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">State Department</a> also feared that the eagle's expression might offend, and sought a neutral visage. The distant Earth may be seen above the bird, and there are 13 stars in honor of the original states.

Bowers deems the bust of Eisenhower "well modeled" by Gasparro, and notes that the fact that the eagle on the reverse holds only an olive branch, rather than arrows as well (token of war), "meant that the public would like the design." Nevertheless, he notes that Eisenhower's stern expression was widely criticized as not typical of a man noted for geniality. Numismatic author David Lange opines that "the Eisenhower dollar is one of the poorest products to emanate from the U.S. Mint." Lange writes that, although Gasparro had designed only one side of the coin for the Kennedy half dollar and <a href="Lincoln%20cent%23Lincoln%20Memorial%20design%20%281959%E2%80%932008%29">Lincoln Memorial reverse</a> for the cent, "the Eisenhower dollar was his design alone and should have served as a showcase for his talent. Sadly, it is a mediocre design that reveals his typically unnatural treatment of Ike's hair and the eagle's feathers." Some collectors complained after the release that the Earth was not fully shown, not realizing that Gasparro had carefully followed the mission badge. The chief engraver responded by clarifying the design.

Two prototype dollars were struck at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> on January 25, 1971; they were subsequently destroyed. However, collectors have found at least two 1971-S coins have been certified as prototypes. Striking such large pieces of tough copper-nickel proved destructive to the Mint's dies, and Gasparro repeatedly used the Janvier <a href="reducing%20lathe">reducing lathe</a> to lower the relief to be used on the circulation strikes and the uncirculated silver clad coins. The chief engraver altered the resulting master die directly to restore at least some of the detail which was lost as the relief was lowered. The proof coins struck at San Francisco, nevertheless, remained in high relief. This meant that in 1971 and for much of 1972 (until better-quality steel was used in the dies), the uncirculated strikes had a lower relief, less detailed surface, compared with the proof coins. Proof coins are struck slowly, and generally multiple times, to bring out the full detail. Striking of Eisenhower dollars for circulation began at Denver on February 3, apparently without any ceremony; minting at Philadelphia also began early in the year, although Bowers, in his comprehensive encyclopedia of silver and clad dollar coins, does not record a specific date. The first Eisenhower dollars in 40% silver, with an uncirculated finish, were struck at the San Francisco Assay Office (today the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a>) on March 31, 1971; Brooks ceremoniously operated the presses. The first coin struck was for presentation to Mamie Eisenhower; the second to <a href="David%20Eisenhower">David Eisenhower</a> (grandson of Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower) and the third to David Eisenhower's father-in-law, President Nixon.
On January 29, 1971, the Mint announced the prices for the 40% silver pieces which would be struck at San Francisco: $3 for uncirculated specimens and $10 for mirror-surfaced <a href="proof%20coinage">proof pieces</a>, with orders to be taken by mail beginning on July 1, with a limit of five of each per customer. Order forms for the public were shipped to 44,000 post offices and 33,000 banks, with instructions not to hand them out until June 18. The Mint returned some orders for being sent in too early. <a href="United%20States%20Mint%20coin%20sets">Mint sets</a> of the circulating coinage for 1971 did not include the Eisenhower dollar.

The first proof strikes, at San Francisco, took place in July. The proof pieces were sold in a plastic holder inside a brown box with a gold eagle seal; the uncirculated silver pieces were encased in pliofilm inside a blue envelope. These were dubbed "brown Ikes" and "blue Ikes" and are still known by those terms. On July 27, 1971, President Nixon presented the first piece to be struck to Mamie Eisenhower at a White House ceremony. Sales of the 40% silver pieces were ended on October 8; the first proof coins were mailed to collectors on October 14, President Eisenhower's birthday.

The circulation version of the Eisenhower dollar, the largest clad coin ever attempted by the Mint, was released through banks on November 1, 1971. Many were obtained by collectors; there was sufficient demand that many banks imposed a limit of one coin per customer. The clad pieces were struck from coinage strip purchased by the Mint from contractors. Many were not well-struck, causing collectors to search through rolls in search of better specimens. An oil film was found on a large number of specimens; this was removed by collectors.

From the start, the coin failed to circulate. In 1976, a Treasury study done in conjunction with a private-sector firm found that the Eisenhower dollar had a near-100 percent attrition rate, that is, almost always, a coin was used in only one transaction, and then stopped circulating (by comparison, the attrition rate of the quarter was close to zero). This was because of the coin's large size, its weight, and the lack of potential uses for it. Even so, it was successful in replacing private-issue tokens in Nevada casinos. According to numismatist Randy Camper, about 70% of Eisenhower dollars were used in casinos. Although the vending machine industry lobbied for the Eisenhower dollar, they converted few machines to take the pieces. Lange recalled, "The fact is that these coins never circulated outside of casinos and nearby areas, and I don't recall ever seeing a vending machine that accepted them."

The Mint struck over 125 million of the Eisenhower dollars in 1971, more than doubling its largest annual production for a dollar coin. Despite an increased mintage in 1972 to over 170 million, and despite what "CoinAge" magazine termed "near-heroic measures on the part of the Mint", the piece did not circulate. In a 1974 article for "CoinAge", numismatist Clement F. Bailey noted, "the circulation value of the coin has been nil". Many Eisenhower dollars were put aside as souvenirs by non-collectors. Nevertheless, the silver coins sold so well that in October 1971, Mint Director Brooks warned that orders for 1971-S proof dollars would not all be filled until well into 1972. She ascribed the delay to the large public demand and to production difficulties which she indicated had been corrected. More than 11 million of the 1971-S silver pieces were sold, in proof and uncirculated, with nearly 7 million in proof. In May 1972, Treasury Secretary <a href="John%20Connally">John Connally</a>, testifying before a Senate committee, described the profits the Mint had made on the silver version of the Eisenhower dollar as "just unconscionable", with the average profit on a silver coin at $3.89, and expected to increase as production became more efficient. Mint officials felt that reducing the price would anger those who had already purchased the pieces.

The 1972 silver pieces were again struck at San Francisco. Sales dropped considerably, to just under 2.2 million specimens in uncirculated and 1.8 million in proof. The part-silver 1972-S Eisenhower dollars were available for sale by mail order, with the ordering period from May 1 to July 15 for the proof coins and August 1 to October 16 for the uncirculated version.

With ample supplies of Eisenhower dollars, the Federal Reserve had no need to order any in 1973, and none were struck for circulation. The 1973 and 1973-D were the first Eisenhower dollars struck for inclusion in mint sets, and were, in theory, only available that way. Many 1973 and 1973-D are known in circulated condition, leading to speculation that the 230,798 pieces which were reported melted after the Mint failed to sell as many mint sets as anticipated, were in fact released into circulation. John Wexler, Bill Crawford, and Kevin Flynn, in their volume on Eisenhower dollars, deny this, citing a 1974 letter from Assistant Director of the Mint for Public Services Roy C. Cahoon, which stated that all 1973 Eisenhower dollars from unsold mint sets were melted. The 1973-S was struck for inclusion in base-metal proof sets, as well as for the regular "blue Ikes" and "brown Ikes". Sales of the part-silver pieces dipped to a total of just under 2.9 million. The coin was struck again for circulation in 1974, was included in mint sets and proof sets, and was available in proof and uncirculated silver clad from San Francisco. Congress ordered that some of the money from the sale of 1974-S silver pieces be used to support <a href="Eisenhower%20College">Eisenhower College</a> in <a href="Seneca%20Falls%2C%20New%20York">Seneca Falls, New York</a>. Coin collectors felt that this set a bad precedent, but about $9 million was paid to the college between 1974 and 1978; yet, despite the infusion of money, the college closed its doors in 1982.

The United States had issued commemorative coins between 1892 and 1954, as a means for fundraising for organizations deemed worthy of federal support. A sponsoring organization would be designated in the authorizing legislation, and was permitted to buy up the issue at face value, selling it to the public at a premium, and pocketing the difference. Various problems with the issues, including mishandling of distributions and complaints that public coins should not be used for private profit, resulted in firm Treasury Department opposition to such issues, and none were struck after 1954.

The American Revolutionary Bicentennial Commission (ARBC) was established by Congress in 1966 as an oversight body for the 1976 two-hundredth anniversary of American independence (the "Bicentennial"). In 1970, its coins and medals advisory committee recommended the issuance of a special half dollar, and subsequently the committee sought the temporary redesign of circulating American coins. Brooks and the Mint initially opposed legislation to effect these proposals, but eventually Brooks supported legislation to redesign the reverses of the quarter, half dollar and dollar coins, and to issue special collector's sets in silver clad. Legislation to authorize this was signed by President Nixon on October 18, 1973. By the terms of this legislation, coins of these denomination minted for delivery after July 4, 1975 and before December 31, 1976 would bear special reverses, and also be dated 1776–1976. A total of 15 million sets (45 million) coins in all would be struck in silver clad for sale to the public at a premium.

The reverse designs for the three Bicentennial coins were determined by a design competition open to the public. This competition closed in January 1974, and in March, a design submitted by 22-year-old art student Dennis R. Williams was selected for the dollar. Williams, the youngest person to that point to design a U.S. coin, had submitted a design depicting the <a href="Liberty%20Bell">Liberty Bell</a> superimposed against the Moon. Gasparro slightly modified the design, simplifying the features visible on the lunar surface, and altering the lettering and the bell. Williams and the designers of the other denominations operated the presses to strike the first coins on August 12, 1974; a set of these prototypes was later given to the new president, <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a>. Williams' design was liked by the public but attracted criticism from some numismatists as the Liberty Bell had been previously used on coinage (for example, on the <a href="Franklin%20half%20dollar">Franklin half dollar</a>). Fearing that a low-mintage 1975 piece would be hoarded, the Mint obtained legislation in December 1974 allowing it to continue coining 1974-dated pieces until it began coinage of Bicentennial pieces.

The Bicentennial dollars were the first of the three denominations to be struck for distribution to the public; these were coined beginning in February 1975. The silver pieces were struck at San Francisco beginning on April 23, 1975. The Mint found that the copper nickel dollar was striking indistinctly, a problem not seen with the silver pieces. Brooks called a halt in production to allow Gasparro to modify the dies; the most noticeable change is that the revised issue, or Type II as it came to be known, have narrower, sharper lettering on the reverse. All silver pieces (struck only at San Francisco) are Type I; all three mints struck both Type I and Type II copper nickel pieces. All dollars included in 1975 proof sets are Type I; all those included in 1976 proof sets are Type II. The first Bicentennial dollars were released into circulation on October 13, 1975. Over 220 million were struck. The Bicentennial design was not used after 1976; sets of silver clad Bicentennial coins were sold by the Mint until sales were finally closed at the end of 1986.

One proof Bicentennial coin in silver clad and lacking a mint mark, similar to the dollar in the prototype set given to President Ford, is known. This piece supposedly came from a cash register drawer at the <a href="Woodward%20%26amp%3B%20Lothrop">Woodward & Lothrop</a> department store in Washington, D.C. Thomas K. DeLorey, who was then a reporter for "<a href="Coin%20World">Coin World</a>", spoke to the discoverer and was suspicious of the story, thinking it more likely the coin was surreptitiously obtained from the government. He declined to question the origin then, fearing it might be seized and, therefore, not available to numismatists. The piece brought almost $30,000 by private sale in 1987.

By 1975, the Treasury was concerned about the drain on resources from striking the dollar, which did not circulate. It engaged a private firm to study the six current denominations of U.S. coinage, and make recommendations. The firm concluded in its report that the Eisenhower dollar was too large and heavy to circulate effectively, but if the diameter was reduced by about a third, and the weight by two-thirds, it might be used. That report found that "the Eisenhower dollar has not been widely accepted by the public because of its large size and weight". In January 1977, just prior to leaving office, Ford's Treasury Secretary, <a href="William%20E.%20Simon">William E. Simon</a>, proposed the elimination of the cent and half dollar, and a reduction in size of the dollar. According to Bowers, the Treasury had come to believe that a coin as large as the Eisenhower dollar simply would not circulate in the United States.

The Mint struck pattern pieces of the smaller size, with various shapes and compositions. An 11-sided coin was considered, which would have differentiated it from the quarter, but the patterns would not work in vending machines. Such exotic metals as titanium were considered before the Mint decided on the standard clad composition. Gasparro prepared, for the circulating pieces, a design showing <a href="Liberty%20%28goddess%29">Liberty</a> with flowing hair, similar to early American coins.

As the Eisenhower dollar awaited its demise, approximately 50 million per year were struck, using the eagle design for the reverse. In both years, the majority coined were at Denver. No silver collector's edition was issued; the blue and brown Ikes ended with 1974.

The new Treasury Secretary, <a href="Michael%20Blumenthal">Michael Blumenthal</a>, supported Gasparro's design in testimony before Congress; Wisconsin Senator <a href="William%20Proxmire">William Proxmire</a> dubbed Blumenthal's position a "cop-out". Proxmire refused to introduce the bill, which would have left the choice of design up to Blumenthal or his successor, instead introducing his own legislation to commemorate early women's rights leader <a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony">Susan B. Anthony</a>. Many in the new Congress and in the Carter Administration were social progressives, and supported <a href="women%27s%20lib">women's lib</a>. Ohio Representative <a href="Mary%20Rose%20Oakar">Mary Rose Oakar</a> also introduced legislation for a <a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony%20dollar">Susan B. Anthony dollar</a> in October 1978; it proceeded rapidly through <a href="95th%20United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> and was signed by President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>. Gasparro was given photographs of Anthony and told to reproduce her appearance exactly on the coin. Anthony's stern expression caused some to dub it the "Susan B. Agony" dollar. The Eisenhower dollar's reverse was used for the Anthony dollar. Convinced that the public would hoard the new pieces, the Mint Bureau produced half a billion before its official release to the public on July 2, 1979. It need not have worried; the public quickly rejected the new coin as too close in size and weight to the quarter dollar, and production for circulation ceased after 1980. Mint Director <a href="Stella%20Hackel%20Sims">Stella Hackel Sims</a> stated, "people are accustomed to the Eisenhower dollar, but in time, they'll become accustomed to the Susan". Attempts were made to give the new smaller dollars out as change in postal transactions, and to force their use by U.S. military personnel in Europe; both failed.

Collected by date and mint mark, no Eisenhower dollar is rare, and a complete set may be acquired without difficulty. However, many were badly struck, without full detail, especially in 1971 and 1972, and most pieces acquired nicks, scratches or "bag marks" from contact with each other soon after striking. Although lower-grade silver coins can be melted, this is not practical for Eisenhower dollars due to the lack of precious metal content, and dealers often try to get any premium they can on face value. Completing a set of highest-grade specimens may be difficult and expensive, especially for the 1971 and 1972 from Philadelphia or Denver, which were not sold in mint sets, and thus only came to collectors through banks. A 1973-D piece, tied with ten other specimens for the finest known of that date and mint mark in near-pristine <a href="coin%20grading">MS-67</a> condition sold in June 2013 for $12,925. According to numismatic writer Steve Reach, "as more people submit modern-era coins like Eisenhower dollars for third-party certification, the true rarity of many issues in top-grades is becoming clear."

Some of the 1971-D pieces exhibit a variety in which (among several differences) the eagle lacks brow lines, these have been dubbed by Eisenhower dollar specialists the "Friendly Eagle Pattern". The 1972 dollar struck at Philadelphia is broken down into three varieties, which were made as Gasparro adjusted the design to take advantage of better steel being used in the Mint's dies. A midyear change in the design was announced by Brooks at the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a>'s 1972 convention in New Orleans, although she did not state exactly what was being changed. The three varieties may be differentiated by examining the depiction of the Earth on the reverse. Type I dollars show the Earth somewhat flattened, Florida pointing to the southeast, with the islands mostly to the southeast of the tip of the peninsula. The Earth is round and Florida points to the south on the Type II, with a single, large island to the southeast. The Type III is similar to the Type II, except that there are two islands directly to the south of the peninsula. The Type II is from a single reverse die, used in March 1972, and erroneously placed in service at Philadelphia—it is identical to and should have been used for the silver proof strikes at San Francisco. The Type III was placed in service, replacing the Type I, in September 1972. The Type I is most common; the Type III design was used in 1973 and after. The 1972 Type II is expensive in top grades, as is the 1776–1976 Type I from Philadelphia, which was only available in mint sets.

Some 1971-S proof pieces (and a few uncirculated 1971-S) have the <a href="serif">serif</a>s at the foot of the "R" in "LIBERTY" missing; this is dubbed the "peg leg" variety. The serifs are missing on all 1972-S, both uncirculated and proof. After the Mint obtained better steel for dies, the serifs returned for all of the remaining non-Bicentennial coinage, from all mints, though the leg of the R was shortened, and also for the Type II Bicentennial (the Type I lacks serifs on the R). Gasparro was often trying to improve the detail of Eisenhower's head during the coin's tenure, and as the R is the letter closest to it, these changes were most likely made in an effort to improve the flow of metal as the coins were struck.

In 1974 and again in 1977, the <a href="Denver%20Mint">Denver Mint</a> struck a small number of pieces on silver-clad planchets, or blanks. Both times, these came from planchets which had been shipped from the San Francisco Assay Office to Denver. The first ones in 1974 were found independently by two Las Vegas blackjack dealers. The 1974 planchets were initially intended to be used for "brown Ike" proof strikings; Mint policy then was that rejected silver proof planchets were to be used for uncirculated "blue Ikes", but these were placed in the bin for rejected copper-nickel proof planchets, intended to be shipped to be coined for circulation at Denver. The 1977 pieces resulted from pieces rejected for Bicentennial silver proof use, which were again placed in the wrong bin (they should have been melted, as the Mint was no longer striking silver uncirculated Eisenhower dollars). Between 10 and 20 of each date are known. Wexler, Crawford, and Flynn report an even rarer 1776–1976-D dollar in silver, but state that none have been offered at auction or submitted to the major coin grading services.

Bowers notes that the <a href="Morgan%20dollar">Morgan dollar</a> (struck between 1878 and 1921) was not widely collected at the time, only to become very popular later, and suggests that one day, the turn of the Eisenhower dollar will come. Numismatist Charles Morgan said of the Eisenhower dollar in 2012,

Priyanka Chopra was born on 18 July 1982 in <a href="Jamshedpur">Jamshedpur</a>, <a href="Bihar">Bihar</a> (now in <a href="Jharkhand">Jharkhand</a>), to Ashok and Madhu Chopra, both physicians in the <a href="Indian%20Army">Indian Army</a>. Her father was a <a href="Punjabi%20Hindu">Punjabi Hindu</a> from <a href="Ambala">Ambala</a>. Her mother, from Jharkhand, is the eldest daughter of the late <a href="Shrimati">Smt.</a> Madhu Jyotsna Akhouri, a former member of <a href="Bihar%20Legislative%20Assembly">Bihar Legislative Assembly</a>, and Dr. Manohar Kishan Akhouri, a former <a href="Indian%20National%20Congress">Congress</a> veteran. Her late maternal grandmother was a practicing <a href="Jacobite%20Syrian%20Christian%20Church">Jacobite Syrian Christian</a> originally named Mary John, belonging to the <a href="Kavalappara">Kavalappara</a> family of <a href="Kumarakom">Kumarakom</a>, <a href="Kottayam%20district">Kottayam district</a>, <a href="Kerala">Kerala</a> before her marriage. Chopra has a brother, Siddharth, who is seven years her junior and actresses <a href="Parineeti%20Chopra">Parineeti Chopra</a>, <a href="Meera%20Chopra">Meera Chopra</a> and <a href="Mannara%20Chopra">Mannara Chopra</a> are her cousins. Due to her parents' occupations the family relocated to a number of places in India, including <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a>, <a href="Chandigarh">Chandigarh</a>, <a href="Ambala">Ambala</a>, <a href="Ladakh">Ladakh</a>, <a href="Lucknow">Lucknow</a>, <a href="Bareilly">Bareilly</a>, and <a href="Pune">Pune</a>. Among the schools she attended were <a href="La%20Martiniere%20Lucknow">La Martiniere Girls' School</a> in Lucknow and St. Maria Goretti College in Bareilly. In an interview published in "<a href="Daily%20News%20and%20Analysis">Daily News and Analysis</a>", Chopra said that she did not mind travelling regularly and changing schools; she welcomed it as a new experience and a way to discover India's multicultural society. Among the many places that she lived, Chopra has fond memories as a child of playing in the valleys of <a href="Leh">Leh</a>, in the cold northwestern Indian desert region of <a href="Jammu%20and%20Kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir</a>. She has said, "I think I was in Class 4 when I was in Leh. My brother was just born. My dad was in the army and was posted there. I stayed in Leh for a year and my memories of that place are tremendous ... We were all army kids there. We weren't living in houses, we were in bunkers in the valley and there was a <a href="stupa">stupa</a> right on top of a hill which used to overlook our valley. We used to race up to the top of the stupa". She now considers Bareilly her home town, and maintains strong connections there.
At the age of thirteen, Chopra moved to the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> to study, living with her aunt, and attending schools in <a href="Newton%2C%20Massachusetts">Newton, Massachusetts</a>, and <a href="Cedar%20Rapids%2C%20Iowa">Cedar Rapids, Iowa</a>, after a stop in <a href="Queens%2C%20New%20York">Queens, New York</a>, as her aunt's family also moved frequently. While in Massachusetts, she participated in several theatre productions and studied Western classical music, choral singing and <a href="Kathak">Kathak</a> dance. During her teenage years in the United States, Chopra sometimes faced racial issues and was bullied for being Indian by an <a href="African-American">African-American</a> classmate. She has said, "I was a gawky kid, had low self-esteem, came from a modest middle-class background, had white marks on my legs ... But I was damn hard working. Today, my legs sell 12 brands."

After three years, Chopra returned to India, finishing the senior year of her high-school education at the <a href="Indian%20Army%20Public%20Schools">Army Public School</a> in Bareilly. During this period, she won the local "May Queen" beauty pageant, after which she was pursued by admirers, leading her family to equip their home with bars for her protection. Her mother then entered her in the <a href="Femina%20Miss%20India">Femina Miss India</a> contest of 2000; she finished second, winning the Femina <a href="Miss%20India%20World">Miss India World</a> title. Chopra then went on to the <a href="Miss%20World">Miss World</a> pageant, where she was crowned <a href="Miss%20World%202000">Miss World 2000</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Miss%20World%20Continental%20Queen%20of%20Beauty%20winners">Miss World Continental Queen of BeautyAsia & Oceania</a> at the <a href="Millennium%20Dome">Millennium Dome</a> in London on 30 November 2000. Chopra was the fifth Indian contestant to win Miss World, and the fourth to do so in seven years. She had enrolled in college, but left after winning the Miss World pageant. Chopra said that the Miss India and Miss World titles brought her recognition, and she then began receiving offers for film roles.

After winning Miss India World, Chopra was cast as the female lead in <a href="Abbas-Mustan">Abbas-Mustan</a>'s romantic thriller "<a href="Humraaz">Humraaz</a>" (2002), in which she was to make her film debut. However, this fell through for various reasons: she stated the production conflicted with her schedule, while the producers said they re-cast because Chopra took on various other commitments. Her screen debut occurred in the 2002 <a href="Tamil%20cinema">Tamil</a> film "<a href="Thamizhan">Thamizhan</a>" as the love interest of the protagonist, played by <a href="Joseph%20Vijay">Vijay</a>. A review published in "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" was appreciative of the film for its wit and dialogue, however it felt that Chopra's role was limited from an acting viewpoint.

In 2003, Chopra made her <a href="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> film debut as the second female lead opposite <a href="Sunny%20Deol">Sunny Deol</a> and <a href="Preity%20Zinta">Preity Zinta</a> in <a href="Anil%20Sharma">Anil Sharma</a>'s "". Set against the backdrop of the Indian Army in Kashmir, the film tells the story of an agent and his fight against terrorism. "The Hero" was one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films that year, but received mixed reviews from critics. <a href="Derek%20Elley">Derek Elley</a> from "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" said that "mega-looker Chopra makes a solid screen debut." Later that year she appeared in <a href="Raj%20Kanwar">Raj Kanwar</a>'s box-office success "<a href="Andaaz">Andaaz</a>" with <a href="Akshay%20Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a>, again sharing the female lead (this time with the debuting <a href="Lara%20Dutta">Lara Dutta</a>). Chopra played a vivacious young girl who falls in love with Kumar's character. The "<a href="Hindustan%20Times">Hindustan Times</a>" noted the glamour that she brought to the role; Kunal Shah of <a href="Sify">Sify</a> praised her performance and stated she had "all the qualities to be a star." Her performance earned her the <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Debut">Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut</a> (along with Dutta) and a nomination for the <a href="Filmfare%20Award">Filmfare Award</a> for <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a>.

Chopra's first three releases in 2004—"<a href="Plan%20%28film%29">Plan</a>", "<a href="Kismat%20%282004%20film%29">Kismat</a>", and "<a href="Asambhav">Asambhav</a>"—performed poorly at the box-office. Chopra was typically cast during this earlier period as a "glamour quotient", in roles that were considered "forgettable" by film critic Joginder Tuteja. Later that year she starred with <a href="Salman%20Khan">Salman Khan</a> and Akshay Kumar in <a href="David%20Dhawan">David Dhawan</a>'s romantic comedy "<a href="Mujhse%20Shaadi%20Karogi">Mujhse Shaadi Karogi</a>", which became the third-highest-grossing film of the year in India and emerged as a commercial success.

In late 2004, she starred opposite Kumar and <a href="Kareena%20Kapoor">Kareena Kapoor</a> in Abbas-Mustan's thriller "<a href="Aitraaz">Aitraaz</a>". Chopra considers her first role as an antagonist, portraying Soniya Roy, an ambitious woman who accuses her employee of sexual harassment, as the "biggest learning experience of her career." The film was a critical and commercial success, and Chopra's performance received critical acclaim. Author Rini Bhattacharya credited her with bringing back the seductress to the silver screen. The "Hindustan Times" cited it as the film that changed her career significantly. A reviewer writing for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> said, ""Aitraaz" is Priyanka Chopra's film. As the deliciously wicked, gold digging, scheming seductress, she chews up every scene she is in with her magnetic screen presence." She won a <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Performance%20in%20a%20Negative%20Role">Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role</a>, becoming the second and final actress to win the award after <a href="Kajol">Kajol</a> (the category was discontinued in 2008). Chopra also received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress, and the <a href="Producers%20Guild%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role</a>.

In 2005, Chopra appeared in six films. Her first two releases—"<a href="Blackmail%20%282005%20film%29">Blackmail</a>", and "<a href="Karam%20%28film%29">Karam</a>"—were commercially unsuccessful. Shilpa Bharatan-Iyer of <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a> considered "Blackmail" to be a very predictable film and believed that her role as a police commissioner's wife was very limited from an acting point of view. Her performance in "Karam" was better received, <a href="Subhash%20K.%20Jha">Subhash K. Jha</a> wrote that Chopra "with her poised interpretation of high drama, flies high creating a character whose vulnerability and beauty are endorsed by both the inner and outer worlds created for her character." Later that year Chopra played the wife of Akshay Kumar in <a href="Vipul%20Amrutlal%20Shah">Vipul Amrutlal Shah</a>'s family drama "", the story of a small businessman (played by <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a>) who, hiding his illness, wants to teach his irresponsible son some lessons before he dies. During production, Chopra revisited Leh, a favourite childhood haunt, for the shooting of the song "Subah Hogi". She suffered an accident during the filming for the song "Do Me A Favour Let's Play Holi" when she electrocuted herself, spending a day recovering in hospital. The film was well received by critics, and was a commercial success.
She next starred opposite <a href="Arjun%20Rampal">Arjun Rampal</a> in the romantic mystery thriller "<a href="Yakeen%20%282005%20film%29">Yakeen</a>", portraying the role of a possessive lover. Critical reaction towards the film was mixed, but her performance received praise. <a href="Taran%20Adarsh">Taran Adarsh</a> wrote that Chopra "is bound to win laurels yet again [...] the actor is emerging as one of the finest talents in these fast-changing times". Her next release was <a href="Suneel%20Darshan">Suneel Darshan</a>'s romance "<a href="Barsaat%20%282005%20film%29">Barsaat</a>", co-starring <a href="Bobby%20Deol">Bobby Deol</a> and <a href="Bipasha%20Basu">Bipasha Basu</a>. The film was a critical and commercial failure in India but fared better in the overseas market. Chopra's performance received mixed reviews, with <a href="Bollywood%20Hungama">Bollywood Hungama</a> describing it as "mechanical". However, Rediff.com considered Chopra to be an "epitome of calm intelligence, who underplayed her role to perfection". Later that year, <a href="Rohan%20Sippy">Rohan Sippy</a> cast her with <a href="Abhishek%20Bachchan">Abhishek Bachchan</a>, <a href="Ritesh%20Deshmukh">Ritesh Deshmukh</a> and <a href="Nana%20Patekar">Nana Patekar</a> in the comedy "<a href="Bluffmaster%21">Bluffmaster!</a>" Chopra played independent working woman Simran Saxena, Bachchan's love interest. The film proved to be a box-office success.

After starting 2006 with special appearances in three films, Chopra starred in <a href="Rakesh%20Roshan">Rakesh Roshan</a>'s superhero film "<a href="Krrish">Krrish</a>" (a sequel to the 2003 science-fiction film "<a href="Koi...%20Mil%20Gaya">Koi... Mil Gaya</a>"). Co-starring with <a href="Hrithik%20Roshan">Hrithik Roshan</a>, <a href="Rekha">Rekha</a> and <a href="Naseeruddin%20Shah">Naseeruddin Shah</a>, Chopra played a young television journalist who schemes to take advantage of an innocent young man with remarkable physical abilities, but eventually falls in love with him. The film was the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India and grossed over worldwide attaining a <a href="Blockbuster%20%28entertainment%29">blockbuster</a> status. Her next film was <a href="Dharmesh%20Darshan">Dharmesh Darshan</a>'s romantic comedy "<a href="Aap%20Ki%20Khatir%20%282006%20film%29">Aap Ki Khatir</a>", co-starring <a href="Akshaye%20Khanna">Akshaye Khanna</a>, <a href="Ameesha%20Patel">Ameesha Patel</a> and <a href="Dino%20Morea">Dino Morea</a>. Neither the film nor Chopra's performance were well received. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com stated that Chopra's portrayal of Anu was "erratically sketched" and that her character was never consistent: "first flaky, then cool, and later, sensitive".

Chopra's final release of 2006 was <a href="Farhan%20Akhtar">Farhan Akhtar</a>'s action-thriller "<a href="Don%20%282006%20Hindi%20film%29">Don</a>" (a remake of the <a href="Don%20%281978%20film%29">1978 film of the same name</a>), with <a href="Shah%20Rukh%20Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a>. Chopra portrayed Roma (played by <a href="Zeenat%20Aman">Zeenat Aman</a> in the original film), who joins the underworld to avenge Don for killing her brother. Chopra received martial-arts training for her role in the movie, and performed her own stunts. The film was declared a box-office success in India and overseas, with revenues of . Raja Sen of Rediff.com found Chopra to be film's "big surprise"; he believed that Chopra convincingly portrayed Roma, "looking every bit the competent woman of action" and wrote "This is an actress willing to push herself, and has definite potential for screen magic. Not to mention a great smile."

In 2007, Chopra had two leading roles. Her first film was <a href="Nikhil%20Advani">Nikhil Advani</a>'s "", a romantic comedy in six chapters with an <a href="ensemble%20cast">ensemble cast</a>. She was featured opposite Salman Khan in the first chapter as Kamini, an <a href="Item%20number">item girl</a> and aspiring actress who tries to land the lead role in a <a href="Karan%20Johar">Karan Johar</a> film with a publicity gimmick. Film critic Sukanya Verma praised her flair for comedy, especially her impressions of <a href="Meena%20Kumari">Meena Kumari</a>, <a href="Nargis">Nargis</a> and <a href="Madhubala">Madhubala</a>. Both "Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love" and her next film, "<a href="Big%20Brother%20%282007%20film%29">Big Brother</a>", proved unsuccessful at the domestic box-office.
In 2008, Chopra starred opposite <a href="Harman%20Baweja">Harman Baweja</a> in <a href="Harry%20Baweja">his father's</a> "<a href="Love%20Story%202050">Love Story 2050</a>". Chopra played a double role, so she coloured her hair twice; once red to portray the girl from the future and then black for the girl of the past. Her performance was poorly received; <a href="Rajeev%20Masand">Rajeev Masand</a> was unimpressed with Chopra's chemistry with her co-star, remarking that her character "fails to inspire either affection or sympathy". She next appeared in the comedy "<a href="God%20Tussi%20Great%20Ho">God Tussi Great Ho</a>", portraying a TV anchor opposite Salman Khan, <a href="Sohail%20Khan">Sohail Khan</a> and Amitabh Bachchan. Chopra next starred as a kindergarten teacher in "<a href="Chamku%20%28film%29">Chamku</a>" opposite <a href="Bobby%20Deol">Bobby Deol</a> and <a href="Irrfan%20Khan">Irrfan Khan</a>, and played the role of Sonia in <a href="Goldie%20Behl">Goldie Behl</a>'s fantasy superhero film "<a href="Drona%20%282008%20film%29">Drona</a>" opposite Abhishek Bachchan and <a href="Jaya%20Bachchan">Jaya Bachchan</a>. "Drona", widely criticised for its extensive use of special effects, marked Chopra's sixth film in succession which had failed at both the box-office and critically, although Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com stated that Chopra displayed convincing action heroine skills. Critics generally perceived at this time that her career was over.

The string of poorly received films ended when Chopra starred in <a href="Madhur%20Bhandarkar">Madhur Bhandarkar</a>'s "<a href="Fashion%20%282008%20film%29">Fashion</a>", a drama about the Indian fashion industry which followed the lives and careers of several fashion models. She portrayed the ambitious supermodel Meghna Mathur, a role which she initially thought was out of her depth, but after six months' consideration she accepted the role, inspired by Bhandarkar's confidence in her. For the role, Chopra had to gain and steadily shed the weight during the production as the character progressed in the film. Both the film and her performance received critical acclaim, becoming a major turning point in her career. Rajeev Masand wrote, "Priyanka Chopra turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best." For her performance, she won several awards, including the <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">National Film Award for Best Actress</a>, the <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Filmfare Award for Best Actress</a>, the <a href="IIFA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">IIFA Award for Best Actress</a>, the <a href="Screen%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Screen Award for Best Actress</a>, and the <a href="Producers%20Guild%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role</a>. With a worldwide revenue of , "Fashion" emerged as a commercial success, and was listed by Subhash K. Jha as one of the best films of the decade with women protagonists.

She said after her first year of writing: "I'm a private person and never thought that I could express my feelings. But strangely enough, whenever I sat down to write this column, my inner most thoughts came to the fore." In March 2009, she met several readers who had submitted feedback on her weekly column.

She continued to write sporadically for newspapers. In August 2012 she wrote a column published in "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" titled "No woman in Mumbai feels safe any longer", discussing the murder of 25-year-old Pallavi Purkayastha, whom she met while working on "Don".

Having not come from a film background, she describes herself as a <a href="self-made%20woman">self-made woman</a>. Her mother, a well-established <a href="gynaecologist">gynaecologist</a> in Bareilly, gave up her practice to support Chopra as she embarked upon a film career.

Although she is known for her media-friendly attitude, Chopra is publicly reticent about her personal life. She had signed on to play one of the leading ladies in "<a href="Bharat%20%28film%29">Bharat</a>", but opted out days before filming her scenes. Nikhil Namit, a producer of the film, said that she quit due to her engagement to <a href="Nick%20Jonas">Nick Jonas</a> and accused her of being "a little unprofessional". Chopra and Jonas became engaged in August 2018 in a <a href="Punjabi%20wedding%20traditions%23Rokka%20%28pre-engagement%29">Punjabi Roka ceremony</a> in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>.

Analysing Chopra's career highlights, <a href="Bollywood%20Hungama">Bollywood Hungama</a> noted: "Despite a career that has seen a constant flip-flop  [...] the performer in her has seen a constant growth with every passing year."

Slay Tracks: 1933–1969

Slay Tracks: 1933–1969 (usually referred to as Slay Tracks) is American <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a> band <a href="Pavement%20%28band%29">Pavement</a>'s debut <a href="extended%20play">extended play</a> (EP). Pavement—at that time, a duo of just its two founding members <a href="Stephen%20Malkmus">Stephen Malkmus</a> (<a href="rhythm%20guitar">guitar</a>, <a href="vocalist">vocals</a>) and <a href="Scott%20Kannberg">Scott Kannberg</a> (<a href="lead%20guitar">guitar</a>)—recorded "Slay Tracks" with <a href="Record%20producer">producer</a> and future member <a href="Gary%20Young%20%28drummer%29">Gary Young</a> (<a href="drummer">drums</a>) during a four-hour session. Pavement self-released the EP as a <a href="Gramophone%20record%23Common%20formats">7"</a> vinyl record on the band's own <a href="record%20label">record label</a> Treble Kicker in 1989. The music of "Slay Tracks" was influenced by indie and <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> bands such as <a href="Swell%20Maps">Swell Maps</a> and <a href="The%20Fall%20%28band%29">The Fall</a>, and many of the lyrics were inspired by life in the band's hometown of <a href="Stockton%2C%20California">Stockton, California</a>.

Although only 1000 copies of "Slay Tracks" were pressed, the EP became an underground hit. Upon release, the EP was critically praised by independently produced <a href="zine">zine</a>s. The EP managed to generate buzz for Pavement in the UK after a cover of the song "Box Elder" by <a href="The%20Wedding%20Present">The Wedding Present</a> received some airplay from the famous radio <a href="disc%20jockey">disc jockey</a> <a href="John%20Peel">John Peel</a>. The release and relative success of "Slay Tracks" was significant to Pavement's subsequent signing to <a href="Drag%20City%20%28record%20label%29">Drag City</a>, and later to <a href="Matador%20Records">Matador Records</a>. The band's "<a href="Westing%20%28By%20Musket%20and%20Sextant%29">Westing (By Musket and Sextant)</a>" (1993) compiled the songs from the band's three EPs prior to their debut album "<a href="Slanted%20and%20Enchanted">Slanted and Enchanted</a>": "Slay Tracks", "<a href="Demolition%20Plot%20J-7">Demolition Plot J-7</a>", and "<a href="Perfect%20Sound%20Forever%20%28EP%29">Perfect Sound Forever</a>". The compilation allowed those songs to reach a wider audience than the EP's limited initial release.

Pavement was formed in 1989 in <a href="Stockton%2C%20California">Stockton, California</a>, by <a href="Stephen%20Malkmus">Stephen Malkmus</a> and <a href="Scott%20Kannberg">Scott Kannberg</a>. Malkmus and Kannberg had previously performed together in the band Bag O' Bones. Pavement had its start playing at <a href="open%20mike">open mike</a> nights at clubs and bars. The songs the band played during this time were mostly <a href="Cover%20version">covers</a>, although they also performed many original songs that would later be released on "Slay Tracks". Malkmus recalls, "It was pretty reasonable to be able to make a single for <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>1,000, so we decided to go for it. We didn't have any real plans because we weren't a real band." Two local studios existed in Stockton, the cheaper and less professionally minded of which was <a href="Gary%20Young%20%28drummer%29">Gary Young</a>'s Louder Than You Think Studio. The band decided to record at Young's studio due to their admiration of other local punk bands who had recorded there, including The Young Pioneers and The Authorities. Kannberg reportedly borrowed $800 from his father to record "Slay Tracks".

"Slay Tracks" was recorded during a four-hour session on January 17, 1989, at Young's studio. Kannberg, describing the studio and the recording process, said, "You go into his house and it's stuff everywhere, old dogs lying around, big <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">pot</a> plants everywhere, and Gary tells us that he got all his equipment by selling pot! It was us going in and pretty much just laying down the songs with a guide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top." Young, though bewildered by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, "[Malkmus and Kannberg] come in and they play this weird guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums were in there so I said, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'" Kannberg said, "We did it really fast. We probably spent one day tracking and one day mixing it." The title of the EP had been decided prior to its recording, and the <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a>s S.M. and Spiral Stairs were used to credit Malkmus and Kannberg respectively.

The music on "Slay Tracks" was written entirely by Malkmus, and he stated his influences on the record included <a href="Chrome%20%28band%29">Chrome</a>, <a href="Swell%20Maps">Swell Maps</a>, and <a href="The%20Fall%20%28band%29">The Fall</a>. The songs on the EP drew comparisons to the likes of <a href="R.E.M.">R.E.M.</a>, <a href="Pixies">Pixies</a>, and <a href="Sonic%20Youth">Sonic Youth</a> by <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> and Heather Phares of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>. <a href="Noise%20%28radio%29">Radio static</a> and <a href="noise">noise</a> are prominently used on the EP, techniques which are characteristic of the <a href="lo-fi%20music">lo-fi</a> and <a href="noise%20pop">noise pop</a> genres that Pavement are frequently associated with. According to Malkmus, "We decided to use static as the third instrument. ... It was pretty exciting to be so experimental." Young played drums on "Box Elder" and "Price Yeah!", and frequently <a href="musical%20improvisation">improvised</a>. Malkmus played drums on "Maybe Maybe", while both Malkmus and Kannberg drummed on "She Believes".

"You're Killing Me", the longest song on the EP at three minutes and 20 seconds, is an example of the impact <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> had on Pavement. The song features <a href="Distortion%20%28music%29">fuzz effects</a>, repetitive lyrics, and no percussion or drums. "Box Elder", an <a href="irony">ironic</a> song about someone wanting to move to <a href="Box%20Elder%2C%20Montana">Box Elder, Montana</a>, was considered by <a href="Gerard%20Cosloy">Gerard Cosloy</a> to be an example of Malkmus's "honest, direct, and simplistic" lyrical style, and features greater influence from <a href="pop%20music">pop music</a> than the rest of the EP. "Maybe Maybe" features <a href="Distortion%20%28guitar%29">distorted guitars</a> and indiscernible vocals, and "Price Yeah!" has a sound typical of <a href="hardcore%20punk">hardcore punk</a>. The band's hometown of Stockton inspired the band's lyrics and sound. Malkmus stated that "There's something empty about Stockton. I wanted to convey that in our music." Malkmus told "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" in 1992 that "Pavement was originally a pathetic effort by us to do something to escape the terminal boredom we were experiencing in Stockton."

After recording was completed Kannberg was tasked with releasing the music himself, as Malkmus had left on a trip to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Kannberg designed the cover of the EP and sent copies to various <a href="independent%20label">independent label</a>s, distributors, and <a href="zine">zine</a>s. He recalled "I had no idea how to do it. I'd send off these little notes to my favorite labels like <a href="SST%20Records">SST</a> and <a href="Twin/Tone%20Records">Twin Tone</a> and ask, 'How do I do this?'" A representative from SST recommended that Kannberg use Erica Records, a <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> 7" manufacturer. Erica Records became the manufacturer of "Slay Tracks"; however, Kannberg was unhappy with the <a href="Audio%20mastering">master</a> recording produced by the company: "It sounds like it sounds now—it's just a mess—but being poor and not really caring I said, 'Okay, that's cool, if it sounds like that–whatever.'" 1000 copies of "Slay Tracks" were pressed, and the first 50 included a green dinosaur stamp on the label. The EP was distributed on Kannberg's own Treble Kicker Records in the United States and England, although Malkmus came across a copy in a record store while visiting <a href="Austria">Austria</a>.

"Slay Tracks" found unexpected attention after the <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a>, England-based band <a href="The%20Wedding%20Present">The Wedding Present</a> covered "Box Elder" on their own 1990 EP, "Brassneck". The Wedding Present's bassist, Keith Gregory, had been introduced to "Slay Tracks" by future Pavement bassist <a href="Mark%20Ibold">Mark Ibold</a> while visiting New York City. The Wedding Present cover is different from the original in that the line "that I had to get the fuck out of this town" was changed to "that I had to get right out of this town". The "Box Elder" cover received radio airplay from influential English <a href="disc%20jockey">disc jockey</a> <a href="John%20Peel">John Peel</a>, which generated publicity for both The Wedding Present and Pavement. Neither member of Pavement was aware of the cover until Kannberg was informed of it. Kannberg remembered "I was kind of mad. I had no idea that people could do that, so I was all offended." However, his opinion of the cover and its significance later changed: "It was so cool that some band from the UK wanted to cover this obscure, horribly recorded song. At the time I probably never appreciated the full extent of how them covering the song helped Pavement, especially in the UK, but it really did, and I'll always be grateful to them for that."

Shortly after its release, "Slay Tracks" became a <a href="Record%20collecting">collector's</a> item. According to an April 1990 <a href="Drag%20City%20%28record%20label%29">Drag City</a> press release, copies were typically sold for $500–$600. Malkmus and Kannberg each kept 100 copies of the EP, and Malkmus said "I used to sell them for fifty dollars. When I needed money I'd go in and sell a couple to the store and they'd sell for a hundred dollars each. I rarely meet anyone who bought it when it originally came out." Malkmus also said that the pair "probably gave away about one-hundred to friends and bands we later toured with." The songs on "Slay Tracks" found <a href="airplay">airplay</a> on several <a href="college%20radio">college radio</a> stations, including <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a>'s <a href="WTJU">WTJU</a> and <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>'s <a href="KALX">KALX</a>. Kannberg commented on the EP's unanticipated popularity, saying "It was very surprising to find that people were into ["Slay Tracks"]."

"Slay Tracks" received generally positive reviews. Much of the initial critical reception to "Slay Tracks" was from zines to whom Kannberg had sent the EP. A review in the <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>-based zine "<a href="Maximum%20RocknRoll">Maximum RocknRoll</a>" said "Most of the tunes work by virtue of their eclecticism, freshness, and originality—this is a good one." The zine "Conflict" called the EP "absolutely perfect." "Slay Tracks" also received attention from mainstream publications. <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> of the "<a href="Village%20Voice">Village Voice</a>" rated "Slay Tracks" an A-, and selected it as his fourth favorite EP of 1990. "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s review said: "a long stream of noise water is omitted by Pavement. ... What a party!" A reviewer for "<a href="Option%20%28music%20magazine%29">Option</a>" praised the band's lo-fi characteristics and attitude, calling the EP "loose and intentionally lo-fi," and saying "let's hope this Pavement stays cracked." "<a href="College%20Music%20Journal">College Music Journal</a>"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> review was also favorable, noting "You're Killing Me" and "She Believes" as highlights, and calling the EP a "deep, intoxicating breath of homemade music from people with tongues in their cheeks and hearts on their sleeves ... the twin engine feedback and fuzz hits dead center with naive melodic balance, and whether that is in spite of or because of the sloppy, one-take feel is inconsequential."

Young's drum performance on "Slay Tracks" eventually led to him joining Pavement as a full-time member. Young produced the group's 1990 EP "<a href="Demolition%20Plot%20J-7">Demolition Plot J-7</a>", but displayed hostility toward then-current drummer Jason Fawkes. Fawkes left Pavement in 1991 due to animosity with Malkmus, allowing Young to drum on their third EP, "<a href="Perfect%20Sound%20Forever%20%28EP%29">Perfect Sound Forever</a>". Young drummed on all Pavement releases from then on until 1992's "<a href="Watery%2C%20Domestic">Watery, Domestic</a>", after which he was fired for his increasingly erratic behavior and was replaced with <a href="Steve%20West%20%28musician%29">Steve West</a>. Young's drumming on "Slay Tracks" was later recognized as an important turning point in Pavement's history, and was considered to be "the opportunity of a lifetime" by C. Harris-Nystrom of the "<a href="News%20%26amp%3B%20Review">News & Review</a>".

Dan Koretzky, founder of <a href="Drag%20City%20%28record%20label%29">Drag City</a>, ordered 200 copies of the EP for the <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> Reckless Records store he worked for at the time. Koretzky asked Kannberg if he would sign to Drag City during the same phone call that he ordered the EP. Kannberg remembered expressing reluctance to sign to any label, but Drag City producer and session musician <a href="Rian%20Murphy">Rian Murphy</a> recalled that "We asked, they said yes. Lives didn't seem to be on the line." Chris Lombardi and Gerard Cosloy of <a href="Matador%20Records">Matador Records</a> also first heard of Pavement after Kannberg sent a copy of "Slay Tracks" to their zine, "Conflict". Matador signed Pavement in 1992 for the release of their debut studio album, "<a href="Slanted%20and%20Enchanted">Slanted and Enchanted</a>".

The songs on "Slay Tracks" are all included on the 1993 compilation "<a href="Westing%20%28By%20Musket%20and%20Sextant%29">Westing (By Musket and Sextant)</a>", along with several of Pavement's other early material. "Westing" has sold 63,000 copies, and was praised by Robert Christgau and Stephen Thomas Erlewine for making songs previously found exclusively on vinyl available on <a href="compact%20disc">compact disc</a>. All of the songs from "Slay Tracks" were played live throughout Pavement's history, with "Box Elder" particularly cited as an "old favorite" for fans at concerts. Live performances of "Box Elder" has also been included on the compilation reissues "" and "", with the version on the latter beginning with a short <a href="jam%20session">jam session</a>. In a 1999 retrospective of the band's career, Donna Freydkin of <a href="CNN%23Online">CNN.com</a> called "Slay Tracks" "a quick underground favorite", while John Hicks of the "Planet Weekly" wrote "Although Pavement was conceived as a studio-only project, the underground success of "Slay Tracks" ensured that it was only a matter of time before the group became a full-fledged performing entity."

All tracks were written by <a href="Stephen%20Malkmus">Stephen Malkmus</a>.

Jacob van Ruisdael

Jacob Isaackszoon van Ruisdael (;  1629 – 10 March 1682) was a Dutch painter, <a href="drafter">draughtsman</a>, and <a href="etching">etcher</a>. He is generally considered the pre-eminent <a href="Landscape%20painting">landscape painter</a> of the <a href="Dutch%20Golden%20Age">Dutch Golden Age</a>, a period of great wealth and cultural achievement when <a href="Dutch%20Golden%20Age%20painting">Dutch painting</a> became highly popular.

Prolific and versatile, Ruisdael depicted a wide variety of landscape subjects. From 1646 he painted Dutch countryside scenes of remarkable quality for a young man. After a trip to <a href="Germany%20in%20the%20early%20modern%20period">Germany</a> in 1650, his landscapes took on a more heroic character. In his late work, conducted when he lived and worked in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, he added city panoramas and seascapes to his regular repertoire. In these, the sky often took up two-thirds of the canvas. In total he produced more than 150 <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n views featuring waterfalls.

Ruisdael's only registered pupil was <a href="Meindert%20Hobbema">Meindert Hobbema</a>, one of several artists who painted figures in his landscapes. Hobbema's work has at times been confused with Ruisdael's. There is difficulty in attributing Ruisdael's work, which has not been helped by the fact that three members of his family were also landscape painters, some of whom spelled their name "Ruysdael": his father <a href="Isaack%20van%20Ruisdael">Isaack van Ruisdael</a>, his well-known uncle <a href="Salomon%20van%20Ruysdael">Salomon van Ruysdael</a>, and his cousin, confusingly called <a href="Jacob%20Salomonsz%20van%20Ruysdael">Jacob van Ruysdael</a>.

Ruisdael's work was in demand in the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a> during his lifetime. Today it is spread across private and institutional collections around the world; the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a> in London, the <a href="Rijksmuseum">Rijksmuseum</a> in Amsterdam, and the <a href="Hermitage%20Museum">Hermitage Museum</a> in St. Petersburg hold the largest collections. Ruisdael shaped landscape painting traditions worldwide, from the English <a href="Romanticism">Romantics</a> to the <a href="Barbizon%20school">Barbizon school</a> in France, and the <a href="Hudson%20River%20School">Hudson River School</a> in the US, and influenced generations of Dutch landscape artists.

Jacob Isaackszoon van Ruisdael was born in <a href="Haarlem">Haarlem</a> in 1628 or 1629 into a family of painters, all <a href="landscape%20painting">landscapists</a>. The number of painters in the family, and the multiple spellings of the Ruisdael name, have hampered attempts to document his life and attribute his works.

The name Ruisdael is connected to a castle, now lost, in the village of <a href="Blaricum">Blaricum</a>. The village was the home of Jacob's grandfather, the furniture maker Jacob de Goyer. When De Goyer moved away to <a href="Naarden">Naarden</a>, three of his sons changed their name to Ruysdael or Ruisdael, probably to indicate their origin. Two of De Goyer's sons became painters: Jacob's father <a href="Isaack%20van%20Ruisdael">Isaack van Ruisdael</a> and his well-known uncle <a href="Salomon%20van%20Ruysdael">Salomon van Ruysdael</a>. Jacob himself always spelled his name with an "i", while his cousin, Salomon's son <a href="Jacob%20Salomonsz%20van%20Ruysdael">Jacob Salomonszoon van Ruysdael</a>, also a landscape artist, spelled his name with a "y". Jacob's earliest biographer, <a href="Arnold%20Houbraken">Arnold Houbraken</a>, called him Jakob Ruisdaal.

It is not known whether Ruisdael's mother was Isaack van Ruisdael's first wife, whose name is unknown, or his second wife, Maycken Cornelisdochter. Isaack and Maycken married on 12 November 1628.

Ruisdael's teacher is also unknown. It is often assumed Ruisdael studied with his father and uncle, but there is no archival evidence for this. He appears to have been strongly influenced by other contemporary local Haarlem landscapists, most notably <a href="Cornelis%20Vroom">Cornelis Vroom</a> and <a href="Allaert%20van%20Everdingen">Allaert van Everdingen</a>.

The earliest date that appears on Ruisdael's paintings and <a href="etching">etching</a>s is 1646. Two years after this date he was admitted to membership of the <a href="Haarlem%20Guild%20of%20St.%20Luke">Haarlem Guild of St. Luke</a>. By this time landscape paintings were as popular as history paintings in Dutch households, though at the time of Ruisdael's birth, history paintings appeared far more frequently. This growth in popularity of landscapes continued throughout Ruisdael's career.

Around 1657, Ruisdael moved to <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, by then a prosperous city which was likely to have offered a bigger market for his work. His fellow Haarlem painter Allaert van Everdingen had already moved to Amsterdam and found a market there. On June 17, 1657 he was baptized in <a href="Ankeveen">Ankeveen</a>, near Naarden. Ruisdael lived and worked in Amsterdam for the rest of his life. In 1668, his name appears as a witness to the marriage of <a href="Meindert%20Hobbema">Meindert Hobbema</a>, his only registered pupil, a painter whose works have been confused with Ruisdael's own.

For a landscape artist, it seems Ruisdael travelled relatively little: to Blaricum, <a href="Egmond%20aan%20Zee">Egmond aan Zee</a>, and <a href="Rhenen">Rhenen</a> in the 1640s, with <a href="Nicolaes%20Pieterszoon%20Berchem">Nicolaes Berchem</a> to <a href="County%20of%20Bentheim%20%28district%29">Bentheim</a> and <a href="Steinfurt">Steinfurt</a> just across the border in Germany in 1650, and possibly with Hobbema across the German border again in 1661, via <a href="Veluwe">the Veluwe</a>, <a href="Deventer">Deventer</a> and <a href="Ootmarsum">Ootmarsum</a>. Despite Ruisdael's numerous Norwegian landscapes, there is no record of him having travelled to Scandinavia.

There is some speculation that Ruisdael was also a doctor. In 1718, his biographer Houbraken reports that he studied medicine and performed surgery in Amsterdam. Archival records of the 17th century show the name "Jacobus Ruijsdael" on a list of Amsterdam doctors, albeit crossed out, with the added remark that he earned his medical degree on 15 October 1676 in <a href="Caen">Caen</a>, northern France. Various art historians have speculated that this was a case of mistaken identity. Pieter Scheltema suggests it was Ruisdael's cousin who appeared on the record. The Ruisdael expert <a href="Seymour%20Slive">Seymour Slive</a> argues that the spelling "uij" is not consistent with Ruisdael's own spelling of his name, that his unusually high production suggests there was little time to study medicine, and that there is no indication in any of his art that he visited northern France. However, Slive is willing to accept that Ruisdael may still have been a doctor. In 2013, Jan Paul Hinrichs agreed that the evidence is inconclusive.

Ruisdael was not <a href="Jews">Jewish</a>. Slive reports that, because of Ruisdael's depiction of a Jewish cemetery and various biblical names in the Ruisdael family, he often heard speculation that Ruisdael must surely be Jewish. The evidence shows otherwise. Ruisdael was buried in the <a href="Grote%20Kerk%2C%20Haarlem">Saint Bavo's Church, Haarlem</a>, a <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> church at that time. His uncle Salomon van Ruysdael belonged to the <a href="Young%20Flemish">Young Flemish</a> subgroup of the <a href="Mennonite">Mennonite</a> congregation, one of several types of <a href="Anabaptists">Anabaptists</a> in Haarlem, and it is probable that Ruisdael's father was also a member there. His cousin Jacob was a registered Mennonite in Amsterdam.

Ruisdael did not marry. According to Houbraken, whose short Ruisdael biography does contain a few errors, this was "to reserve time to serve his old father". It is not known what Ruisdael looked like, as no known portrait or self-portrait of him exists.

The art historian Hendrik Frederik Wijnman disproved the myth that Ruisdael died a poor man, supposedly in the old men's almshouse in Haarlem. Wijnman showed that the person who died there was in fact Ruisdael's cousin, Jacob Salomonszoon. Although there is no record of Ruisdael owning land or shares, he appears to have lived comfortably, even after the economic downturn of the <a href="Rampjaar">disaster year 1672</a>. His paintings were valued fairly highly. In a large sample of inventories between 1650 and 1679 the average price for a Ruisdael was 40 guilders, compared to an average of 19 guilders for all attributed paintings. In a ranking of contemporary Dutch painters based on price-weighted frequency in these inventories, Ruisdael ranks seventh; <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a> ranks first.

Ruisdael died in Amsterdam on 10 March 1682. He was buried 14 March 1682 in Saint Bavo's Church, Haarlem.

Ruisdael's work from c. 1646 to the early 1650s, when he was living in Haarlem, is characterised by simple motifs and careful and laborious study of nature: dunes, woods, and atmospheric effects. By applying heavier paint than his predecessors, Ruisdael gave his foliage a rich quality, conveying a sense of sap flowing through branches and leaves. His accurate rendering of trees was unprecedented at the time: the genera of his trees are the first to be unequivocally recognisable by modern-day botanists. His early sketches introduce motifs that would return in all his work: a sense of spaciousness and luminosity, and an airy atmosphere achieved through <a href="Pointillism">pointillist</a>-like touches of chalk. Most of his thirty black chalk sketches that survive date from this period.

An exemplar of Ruisdael's early style is "<a href="Wooded%20Dunes">Dune Landscape</a>", one of the earliest works, dated 1646. It breaks with the classic Dutch tradition of depicting broad views of dunes that include houses and trees flanked by distant vistas. Instead, Ruisdael places tree-covered dunes prominently at centre stage, with a cloudscape concentrating strong light on a sandy path. The resulting heroic effect is enhanced by the large size of the canvas, "so unexpected in the work of an inexperienced painter" according to Irina Sokolova, curator at the <a href="Hermitage%20Museum">Hermitage Museum</a>. The art historian <a href="Cornelis%20Hofstede%20de%20Groot">Hofstede de Groot</a> said of "Dune Landscape": "It is hardly credible that it should be the work of a boy of seventeen".
Ruisdael's first panoramic landscape, "View of Naarden with the Church at Muiderberg in the Distance", dates from 1647. The theme of an overwhelming sky and a distant town, in this case the birthplace of his father, is one he returned to in his later years.

For unknown reasons, Ruisdael almost entirely stopped dating his work from 1653. Only five works from the 1660s have a, partially obscured, year next to his signature; none from the 1670s and 1680s have a date. Dating subsequent work has therefore been largely based on detective work and speculation.

All thirteen known Ruisdael etchings come from his early period, with the first one dated 1646. It is unknown who taught him the art of etching. No etchings exist signed by his father, his uncle, or his fellow Haarlem landscapist Cornelis Vroom, who influenced his other work. His etchings show little influence from Rembrandt, either in style or technique. Few original impressions exist; five etchings survive in only a single impression. The rarity of prints suggests that Ruisdael considered them trial essays, which did not warrant large editions. The etching expert <a href="Georges%20Duplessis">Georges Duplessis</a> singled out "<a href="Grainfield%20at%20the%20Edge%20of%20a%20Wood">Grainfield at the Edge of a Wood</a>" and "<a href="Forest%20Marsh%20with%20Travellers%20on%20a%20Bank">The Travellers</a>" as unrivalled illustrations of Ruisdael's genius.

Following Ruisdael's trip to Germany, his landscapes took on a more heroic character, with forms becoming larger and more prominent. A view of "<a href="Bentheim%20Castle%20%28Dublin%29">Bentheim Castle</a>", dated 1653, is just one of a dozen of Ruisdael's depictions of a particular castle in Germany, almost all of which pronounce its position on a hilltop. Significantly, Ruisdael made numerous changes to the castle's setting (it is actually on an unimposing low hill) culminating in a 1653 version which shows it on a wooded mountain. These variations are considered by art historians to be evidence of Ruisdael's compositional skills.

On his trip to Germany, Ruisdael encountered water mills which he turned into a principal subject for painting, the first artist to ever do so. "<a href="Two%20Water%20Mills%20with%20an%20Open%20Sluice">Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice</a>", dated 1653, is a prime example. The ruins of Egmont Castle near Alkmaar were another favourite subject of Ruisdael's and feature in "<a href="The%20Jewish%20Cemetery">The Jewish Cemetery</a>", of which he painted two versions. With these, Ruisdael pits the natural world against the built environment, which has been overrun by the trees and shrubs surrounding the cemetery.

Ruisdael's first Scandinavian views contain big firs, rugged mountains, large boulders and rushing torrents. Though convincingly realistic, they are based on previous art works, rather than on direct experience. There is no record that Ruisdael made any trip to Scandinavia, although fellow Haarlem painter van Everdingen had travelled there in 1644 and had popularised the subgenre. Ruisdael's work soon outstripped van Everdingen's finest efforts. In total Ruisdael produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls, of which "<a href="Waterfall%20in%20a%20Mountainous%20Landscape%20with%20a%20Ruined%20Castle">Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with a Ruined Castle</a>",  1665–1670, is seen as his greatest by Slive.

In this period Ruisdael started painting coastal scenes and sea-pieces, influenced by <a href="Simon%20de%20Vlieger">Simon de Vlieger</a> and <a href="Jan%20Porcellis">Jan Porcellis</a>. Among the most dramatic is "<a href="Rough%20Sea%20at%20a%20Jetty">Rough Sea at a Jetty</a>", with a restricted palette of only black, white, blue and a few brown earth colours. However, forest scenes remain a subject of choice, such as the Hermitage's most famous Ruisdael, "<a href="A%20Wooded%20Marsh">A Wooded Marsh</a>", dated  1665, which depicts a primeval scene with broken birches and oaks, and branches reaching for the sky amidst an overgrown pond.

During Ruisdael's last period he began to depict mountain scenes, such as "<a href="Mountain%20Landscape%20with%20a%20Watermill">Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River</a>", dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian <a href="Wolfgang%20Stechow">Wolfgang Stechow</a> identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses all but two of them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the <a href="Italianate">Italianate</a> and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.

The imaginary landscapes of gardens that Ruisdael painted in the 1670s actually reflect an ongoing discourse on the picturesque in circles of gardening aesthetes like <a href="Constantijn%20Huygens">Constantijn Huygens</a>.
Slive finds it appropriate that a windmill is the subject of one of Ruisdael's most famous works. "<a href="Windmill%20at%20Wijk%20bij%20Duurstede">Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede</a>", dated 1670, shows <a href="Wijk%20bij%20Duurstede">Wijk bij Duurstede</a>, a riverside town about from <a href="Utrecht">Utrecht</a>, with a dominant cylindrical windmill. In this composition, Ruisdael united typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water and expansive sky, so that they converge on the equally characteristic Dutch windmill. The painting's enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the <a href="Rijksmuseum">Rijksmuseum</a>, with the "Windmill" ranking third after Rembrandt's "<a href="The%20Night%20Watch">Night Watch</a>" and <a href="Johannes%20Vermeer">Vermeer</a>'s "<a href="View%20of%20Delft">View of Delft</a>". Windmills featured throughout Ruisdael's entire career.

Various panoramic views of the Haarlem skyline and its bleaching grounds appear during this stage, a specific genre called <a href="Haerlempjes">Haerlempjes</a>, with the clouds creating various gradations of alternating bands of light and shadow towards the horizon. The paintings are often dominated by Saint Bavo's Church, in which Ruisdael would one day be buried.

While Amsterdam does feature in his work, it does so relatively rarely given that Ruisdael lived there for over 25 years. It does feature in his only known architectural subject, a drawing of the interior of the <a href="Oude%20Kerk%2C%20Amsterdam">Old Church</a>, as well as in views of the Dam, and the "<a href="Panoramic%20view%20of%20the%20Amstel%20looking%20toward%20Amsterdam">Panoramic view of the Amstel looking toward Amsterdam</a>", one of Ruisdael's last paintings.

Figures are introduced sparingly into Ruisdael's compositions, and are by this period rarely from his own hand but executed by various artists, including his pupil Meindert Hobbema, Nicolaes Berchem, <a href="Adriaen%20van%20de%20Velde">Adriaen van de Velde</a>, <a href="Philips%20Wouwerman">Philips Wouwerman</a>, <a href="Jan%20Vonck">Jan Vonck</a>, <a href="Thomas%20de%20Keyser">Thomas de Keyser</a>, <a href="Gerrit%20Battem">Gerard van Battum</a> and <a href="Johannes%20Lingelbach">Jan Lingelbach</a>.

In his 2001 catalogue raisonné, Slive attributes 694 paintings to Ruisdael and lists another 163 paintings with dubious or, he believes, incorrect attribution. There are three main reasons why there is uncertainty over whose hand painted various Ruisdael-style landscapes. Firstly, four members of the Ruysdael family were landscapists with similar signatures, some of which were later fraudulently altered into Jacob's. This is further complicated by the fact that Ruisdael used variations of his signature. This typically reads "JvRuisdael" or the <a href="monogram">monogram</a> "JVR", sometimes using a small italic 's' and sometimes a Gothic long 's', such as on "<a href="Landscape%20with%20Waterfall">Landscape with Waterfall</a>". Secondly, many 17th-century landscape paintings are unsigned and could be from pupils or copyists. Finally, fraudsters imitated Ruisdaels for financial gain, with the earliest case reported by Houbraken in 1718: a certain Jan Griffier the Elder could imitate Ruisdael's style so well that he often sold them for real Ruisdaels, especially with figurines added in the style of the artist Wouwerman. There is no large-scale systematic approach to ascertaining Ruisdael's attributions, unlike the forensic science used to find the correct attributions of Rembrandt's paintings through the <a href="Rembrandt%20Research%20Project">Rembrandt Research Project</a>.

Ruisdael has shaped landscape painting traditions from the English <a href="Romanticism">Romantics</a> to the <a href="Barbizon%20school">Barbizon school</a> in France, and the <a href="Hudson%20River%20School">Hudson River School</a> in the US, as well as generations of Dutch landscape artists. Among the English artists influenced by Ruisdael are <a href="Thomas%20Gainsborough">Thomas Gainsborough</a>, <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a>, and <a href="John%20Constable">John Constable</a>. Gainsborough drew, in black chalk and grey wash, a replica of a Ruisdael in the 1740s—now both paintings are housed in the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a> in Paris. Turner made many copies of Ruisdaels and even painted fantasy views of a nonexistent port he called "Port Ruysdael". Constable also copied various drawings, etchings and paintings by Ruisdael, and was a great admirer from a young age. "It haunts my mind and clings to my heart", he wrote after seeing a Ruisdael. However, he thought "Jewish Cemetery" was a failure, because he considered that it attempted to convey something outside the reach of art.

In the 19th century, <a href="Vincent%20van%20Gogh">Vincent van Gogh</a> acknowledged Ruisdael as a major influence, calling him sublime, but at the same time saying it would be a mistake to try to copy him. Van Gogh had two Ruisdael prints, "<a href="Dune%20Landscape%20near%20Haarlem">The Bush</a>" and a "Haerlempje", on his wall, and thought the Ruisdaels in the Louvre were "magnificent, especially "The Bush", "<a href="Storm%20Off%20a%20Sea%20Coast">The Breakwater</a>" and "<a href="The%20Ray%20of%20Light">The Ray of Light</a>"". His experience of the French countryside was informed by his memory of Ruisdael's art. Van Gogh's contemporary <a href="Claude%20Monet">Claude Monet</a> is also said to be indebted to Ruisdael. Even <a href="Piet%20Mondrian">Piet Mondriaan</a>'s minimalism has been traced back to Ruisdael's panoramas.

Among art historians and critics, Ruisdael's reputation has had its ups and downs over the centuries. The first account, in 1718, is from Houbraken, who waxed lyrical over the technical mastery which allowed Ruisdael to realistically depict falling water and the sea. In 1781, Sir <a href="Joshua%20Reynolds">Joshua Reynolds</a>, founder of the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a>, admired the freshness and force of Ruisdael's landscapes. A couple of decades later other English critics were less impressed. In 1801, <a href="Henry%20Fuseli">Henry Fuseli</a>, professor at the Royal Academy, expressed his contempt for the entire Dutch School of Landscape, dismissing it as no more than a "transcript of the spot", a mere "enumeration of hill and dale, clumps of trees". Of note is that one of Fuseli's students was Constable, whose admiration for Ruisdael remained unchanged. Around the same time in Germany, the writer, statesman and scientist <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a> lauded Ruisdael as a thinking artist, even a poet, saying "he demonstrates remarkable skill in locating the exact point at which the creative faculty comes into contact with a lucid mind". <a href="John%20Ruskin">John Ruskin</a> however, in 1860, raged against Ruisdael and other Dutch Golden Age landscapists, calling their landscapes places where "we lose not only all faith in religion but all remembrance of it". In 1915, the Dutch art historian <a href="Abraham%20Bredius">Abraham Bredius</a> called his compatriot not so much a painter as a poet.

More recent art historians have rated Ruisdael highly. <a href="Kenneth%20Clark">Kenneth Clark</a> described him as "the greatest master of the natural vision before Constable". <a href="Waldemar%20Januszczak">Waldemar Januszczak</a> finds him a marvellous storyteller. Januszczak does not consider Ruisdael the greatest landscape artist of all time, but is especially impressed by his works as a teenager: "a prodigy whom we should rank at number 8 or 9 on the Mozart scale". Slive states Ruisdael is acknowledged "by general consent, as the pre-eminent landscapist of the Golden Age of Dutch art".

Ruisdael is now seen as the leading artist of the "classical" phase in Dutch landscape art, which built upon the realism of the previous "tonal" phase. The tonal phase suggested atmosphere through the use of tonality, while the classical phase strived for a more grandiose effect, with paintings built up through a serious of vigorous contrasts of solid form against the sky, and of light against shade, with a tree, animal, or windmill often singled out.

Although many of Ruisdael's works were on show in the <a href="Art%20Treasures%20Exhibition%2C%20Manchester%201857">Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857</a>, and various other grand exhibitions across the world since, it was not until 1981 that an exhibition was solely dedicated to Ruisdael. Over fifty paintings and thirty-five drawings and etchings were exhibited, first at the <a href="Mauritshuis">Mauritshuis</a> in <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a>, then, in 1982, at the <a href="Fogg%20Museum">Fogg Museum</a> in <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>. In 2006, the Royal Academy in London hosted a Ruisdael "Master of Landscape" exhibition, displaying works from over fifty collections.

There are no 17th-century documents to indicate, either at first or second hand, what Ruisdael intended to convey through his art. While "The Jewish Cemetery" is universally accepted as an allegory for the fragility of life, how other works should be interpreted is much disputed. At one end of the spectrum is Henry Fuseli, who contends they have no meaning at all, and are simply a depiction of nature. At the other end is <a href="Franz%20Theodor%20Kugler">Franz Theodor Kugler</a> who sees meaning in almost everything: "They all display the silent power of Nature, who opposes with her mighty hand the petty activity of man, and with a solemn warning as it were, repels his encroachments".

In the middle of the spectrum are scholars such as E. John Walford, who sees the works as "not so much bearers of narrative or emblematic meanings but rather as images reflecting the fact that the visible world was essentially perceived as manifesting inherent spiritual significance". Walford advocates abandoning the notion of "disguised symbolism". All of Ruisdael's work can be interpreted according to the religious world view of his time: nature serves as the "first book" of God, both because of its inherent divine qualities and because of God's obvious concern for man and the world. The intention is spiritual, not moral.

<a href="Andrew%20Graham-Dixon">Andrew Graham-Dixon</a> asserts all Dutch Golden Age landscapists could not help but search everywhere for meaning. He says of the windmill in "The Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede" that it symbolises "the sheer hard work needed to keep Holland above water and to safeguard the future of the nation's children". The symmetries in the landscapes are "reminders to fellow citizens always to remain on the straight and narrow". Slive is more reluctant to read too much into the work, but does put "The Windmill" in its contemporary religious context of man's dependence on the "spirit of the Lord for life". With regards to interpreting Ruisdael's Scandinavian paintings, he says "My own view is that it strains credulity to the breaking point to propose that he himself conceived of all his depictions of waterfalls, torrents and rushing streams and dead trees as visual sermons on the themes of transcience and vanitas".

Ruisdaels are scattered across collections globally, both private and institutional. The most notable collections are at the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a> in London, which holds twenty paintings; the <a href="Rijksmuseum">Rijksmuseum</a> in Amsterdam, which holds sixteen paintings; and the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, which holds nine. In the US, the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in New York has five Ruisdaels in its collection, and the <a href="J.%20Paul%20Getty%20Museum">J. Paul Getty Museum</a> in California has three.

On occasion a Ruisdael changes hands. In 2014, "Dunes by the Sea" was auctioned at <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a> in New York, and realised a price of $1,805,000. Of his surviving drawings, 140 in total, the Rijksmuseum, the <a href="Teylers%20Museum">Teylers Museum</a> in Haarlem, <a href="Kupferstich-Kabinett%2C%20Dresden">Dresden's Kupferstich-Kabinett</a>, and the Hermitage each hold significant collections. Ruisdael's rare etchings are spread across institutions. No collection holds a print of each of the thirteen etchings. Of the five unique prints, the British Museum holds two, two are in the <a href="Albertina">Albertina</a> in Vienna, and one is in Amsterdam.

Ruisdael and his art should not be considered apart from the context of the incredible wealth and significant changes to the land that occurred during the <a href="Dutch%20Golden%20Age">Dutch Golden Age</a>. In his study on 17th-century Dutch art and culture, <a href="Simon%20Schama">Simon Schama</a> remarks that "it can never be overemphasized that the period between 1550 and 1650, when the political identity of an independent Netherlands nation was being established, was also a time of dramatic physical alteration of its landscape". Ruisdael's depiction of nature and emergent Dutch technology are wrapped up in this. Christopher Joby places Ruisdael in the religious context of the <a href="Calvinism">Calvinism</a> of the Dutch Republic. He states that landscape painting does conform to Calvin's requirement that only what is visible may be depicted in art, and that landscape paintings such as those of Ruisdael have an <a href="epistemology">epistemological</a> value which provides further support for their use within Reformed Churches.

The art historian Yuri Kuznetsov places Ruisdael's art in the context of the <a href="Eighty%20Years%27%20War">war of independence against Spain</a>. Dutch landscape painters "were called upon to make a portrait of their homeland, twice rewon by the Dutch people – first from the sea and later from foreign invaders". Jonathan Israel, in his study of the Dutch Republic, calls the period between 1647 and 1672 the third phase of Dutch Golden Age art, in which wealthy merchants wanted large, opulent and refined paintings, and civic leaders filled their town halls with grand displays containing republican messages.

As well, ordinary middle class Dutch people began buying art for the first time, creating a high demand for paintings of all kinds. This demand was met by enormous painter guilds. Master painters set up studios to produce large numbers of paintings quickly. Under the master's direction, studio members would specialise in parts of a painting, such as figures in landscapes, or costumes in portraits and history paintings. Masters would sometimes add a few touches to authenticate a work mostly done by pupils, to maximise both speed and price. Numerous art dealers organised commissions on behalf of patrons, as well as buying uncommissioned stock to sell on. Landscape artists did not depend on commissions in the way most painters had to do, and could therefore paint for stock. In Ruisdael's case, it is not known whether he kept stock to sell directly to customers, or sold his work through dealers, or both. Art historians only know of one commission, a work for the wealthy Amsterdam <a href="burgomaster">burgomaster</a> <a href="Cornelis%20de%20Graeff">Cornelis de Graeff</a>, jointly painted with Thomas de Keyser.

Barthélemy Boganda

Barthélemy Boganda (4 April 1910 – 29 March 1959) was the leading <a href="Nationalism">nationalist</a> politician of what is now the <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a>. Boganda was active prior to his country's independence, during the period when the area, part of <a href="French%20Equatorial%20Africa">French Equatorial Africa</a>, was administered by <a href="France">France</a> under the name of <a href="Oubangui-Chari">Oubangui-Chari</a>. He served as the first <a href="List%20of%20heads%20of%20government%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic%20and%20Central%20African%20Empire">Prime Minister</a> of the Central African Republic <a href="territorial%20autonomy">autonomous territory</a>.

Boganda was born into a family of subsistence farmers, and was adopted and educated by <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> <a href="Mission%20%28Christian%29">missionaries</a>. In 1938, he was ordained as the first Roman Catholic priest from Oubangui-Chari. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Boganda served in a number of missions and after was persuaded by the Bishop of <a href="Bangui">Bangui</a> to enter politics. In 1946, he became the first Oubanguian elected to the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20France">French National Assembly</a>, where he maintained a political <a href="party%20platform">platform</a> against <a href="racism">racism</a> and the <a href="Colonialism">colonial regime</a>. He then returned to Oubangui-Chari to form a grassroots movement in opposition of <a href="French%20colonial%20empires">French colonialism</a>. The movement led to the 1949 foundation of the <a href="MESAN">Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa</a> (MESAN), which became popular among villagers and the <a href="working%20class">working class</a>. Boganda's reputation was slightly damaged when he was <a href="Defrocking">laicized</a> from the priesthood after marrying Michelle Jourdain, a parliamentary secretary. Nonetheless, he continued to advocate for equal treatment and <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> for blacks in the territory well into the 1950s.

In 1958, after the <a href="French%20Fourth%20Republic">French Fourth Republic</a> began to consider granting independence to most of its African colonies, Boganda met with <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20France">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> to discuss terms for the independence of Oubangui-Chari. De Gaulle accepted Boganda's terms, and on 1 December, Boganda declared the establishment of the Central African Republic. He became the autonomous territory's first Prime Minister and intended to serve as the first <a href="List%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic%20and%20Central%20African%20Empire">President of the independent CAR</a>. He was killed in a mysterious plane crash on 29 March 1959, while en route to Bangui. Experts found a trace of explosives in the plane's wreckage, but revelation of this detail was withheld. Although those responsible for the crash were never identified, people have suspected the <a href="List%20of%20intelligence%20agencies%20of%20France">French secret service</a>, and even Boganda's wife, of being involved. Slightly more than one year later, Boganda's dream was realized, when the Central African Republic attained formal independence from France.

Boganda was born to a family of <a href="subsistence%20agriculture">subsistence farmers</a> in <a href="Bobangui">Bobangui</a>, a large <a href="M%27Baka">M'Baka</a> village in the <a href="Lobaye">Lobaye</a> basin located at the edge of the equatorial forest some southwest of <a href="Bangui">Bangui</a>. French commercial exploitation of Central Africa had reached an apogee around the time of Boganda's birth, and although interrupted by <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, activity resumed in the 1920s. The French consortia used what was essentially a form of slavery—the "corvée"—and one of the most notorious was the Compagnie forestière de la Sangha-Oubangui, involved in rubber gathering in the Lobaye district.

In the late 1920s, Boganda's mother was beaten to death by the company's officials while collecting rubber in the forest. His uncle, whose son <a href="Jean-B%C3%A9del%20Bokassa">Jean-Bédel Bokassa</a> would later crown himself as the Emperor of the <a href="Central%20African%20Empire">Central African Empire</a>, was beaten to death at the colonial police station as a result of his alleged resistance to <a href="employment">work</a>. Boganda's father was a <a href="witch%20doctor">witch doctor</a> who had engaged in <a href="cannibalism">cannibalistic</a> rituals.

During his early years, Boganda was adopted by Catholic missionaries. As a boy he attended the school opened at <a href="Mbaiki">Mbaiki</a> (the administrative centre for the Lobaye <a href="prefecture">prefecture</a>) by the post's founder, Lieutenant Mayer. From December 1921 to December 1922, he spent two hours a day with <a href="Monsignor">Monsignor</a> Jean-Réné Calloch learning how to read, while spending the rest of his time performing manual labour. On 24 December, he was received into the church under the name <a href="Bartholomew%20the%20Apostle">Barthélemy</a>, in honour of one of the <a href="Twelve%20Apostles">Twelve Apostles</a> of <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus Christ</a> who was believed to have worked as <a href="Mission%20%28Christian%29">Christian missionary</a> in Africa. Father Gabriel Herrau sent Boganda to the Catholic School of Betou and then to the school of the Saint Paul Mission at Bangui, where he completed his primary studies under Mgr Calloch, whom he would consider his spiritual father. The missionaries there, encouraged by his intellectual promise and pious demeanour, helped him continue secondary studies at small seminaries in <a href="Brazzaville">Brazzaville</a> and <a href="Kisantu">Kisantu</a> (under <a href="Belgium">Belgian</a> <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuits</a>) before he moved on to the great seminary at <a href="Yaound%C3%A9">Yaoundé</a>. On 17 March 1938, fulfilling an ambition he had had since age twelve, he was ordained and became the first <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> priest native to <a href="Oubangui-Chari">Oubangui-Chari</a>, as the colony was then called. He ministered at Bangui, <a href="Grimari">Grimari</a> and <a href="Bangassou">Bangassou</a>, and in 1939, his bishop denied his request to join the <a href="French%20Army">French Army</a>. He was needed at home, as many Frenchmen involved with the church had been recalled to the metropole to fight in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, during which he served in a number of missions.

After World War II, Boganda was urged by the Bishop of Bangui, Mgr Grandin, to complement his humanitarian and social works through political action. Boganda decided to run for election to the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20France">National Assembly of France</a>. On 10 November 1946, he became the first Oubanguian <a href="French%20legislative%20election%2C%20November%201946">elected</a> to the assembly after winning almost half of the total votes cast and defeating three other candidates, including the outgoing incumbent, François Joseph Reste, who had formerly served as the Governor-General of <a href="French%20Equatorial%20Africa">French Equatorial Africa</a>. Boganda arrived in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> attired in his clerical garb and introduced himself to his fellow legislators as the son of a polygamous cannibal. From 1947 on, Boganda conducted a lively campaign against racism and the colonial regime. Soon realizing the limits of his influence in France (he served in parliament until 1958 but gradually detached himself from its activities), he returned to Oubangui-Chari to organise a grassroots movement of teachers, truck drivers and small producers to oppose French colonialism, although his previous attempt to set up a marketing cooperative among African planters of his own ethnicity had failed. On 28 September 1949, at Bangui, he founded the <a href="Movement%20for%20the%20Social%20Evolution%20of%20Black%20Africa">Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa</a> (MESAN), a quasi-religious <a href="political%20movement">political movement</a> and <a href="political%20party">party</a> that sought to affirm black humanity and quickly came to dominate local politics. His political creed was summed up in the <a href="Sango%20language">Sango</a> phrase ""zo kwe zo"", which translated to "every human being is a person". Effectively, he was looking for equal treatment and civil rights for blacks within the <a href="French%20Union">French Union</a> rather than independence, at least for the time being. He demarginalised large masses of people—women, youth, workers, poor cultivators—with the intent of unleashing the creativity of the Oubanguian people by placing them centre stage in the making of their country's history.
The movement was more popular among villagers than among "<a href="%C3%A9volu%C3%A9">évolué</a>" townsmen, whom Boganda considered servile and to whom he applied the derogatory term ""Mboundjou-Voko"" ("Black-Whites"). Additionally, he created the Intergroupe Liberal Oubanguien (ILO) in 1953, which aimed to elect an equal number of black and white politicians to the assembly, so that a united <a href="electoral%20college">electoral college</a> could be established. MESAN's activities angered the French administration and the companies trading in cotton, coffee, diamonds and other commodities. The Bangui chamber of commerce was controlled by these companies, and the men who gathered at this club strongly resented the demise of forced labour and the resultant rise of black nationalism. They hated Boganda in particular, viewing him as a dangerous revolutionary demagogue and a threat to their "free enterprise", and they resolved to get rid of him. They also set up local <a href="Rally%20of%20the%20French%20People">RPF</a> branches to counter MESAN, and the presence of African Democratic Rally (RDA) in the other three territories of French Equatorial Africa posed some menace for MESAN, but by 1958, although other parties were allowed, they had been reduced to tiny groups. On many occasions, General <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> expressed his sympathy for Oubangui-Chari, which had supported de Gaulle's <a href="Free%20French%20Forces">Free French Forces</a> as early as August 1940, and refused to support the violent intrigues of the RPF against Boganda and his men. He received Boganda, by then head of the Grand Council of French Equatorial Africa and pushing for independence, in Paris in July 1958 and was in turn received at Brazzaville in August. The discussions there led to the General accepting Boganda's demands for independence and the endorsement of the <a href="French%20Community">French Community</a> in September throughout <a href="French%20Equatorial%20Africa">French Equatorial Africa</a>.

Boganda's attachment to his chosen calling weakened when he met and fell in love with a young Frenchwoman, Michelle Jourdain, who was employed as a parliamentary secretary. They were married on 13 June 1950, for which Boganda was expelled from the priesthood and cut off from the Catholic hierarchy's support. Boganda and Jourdain would later have two daughters and a son. The affair caused a minor scandal in Paris, but it did little to dent his popularity with his people. In the National Assembly he continued to battle, often in vain, against repressive features of the French administration in Oubangui-Chari. Arbitrary arrest, low wages, compulsory cotton cultivation, and the exclusion of blacks from restaurants and cinemas were all targets of his rhetoric.

On 29 March 1951, Boganda was sentenced to two months in prison following his arrest on 10 January for "endangering the peace" after intervening in a local market dispute (the "Bokanga incident" in Lobaye). His wife was sentenced to 15 days in prison, but neither served their terms. On 17 June, he was <a href="French%20legislative%20election%2C%201951">re-elected</a> to the National Assembly with 48% of the vote despite the obstacles placed in his way by the administration and strong opposition by the authorities, colonists, and the missions, with two prominent French candidates seeking to oust him. At this time, he emerged as an extraordinarily popular messianic folk hero and his country's leading nationalist; MESAN became the majority party in the <a href="Ubangi-Shari%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201952">Territorial Assembly elections</a> in March 1952. In this period he divided his time between his coffee plantation, his emancipation work and new political positions. In April 1954, an incident that would showcase Boganda's talent and appeal with crowds erupted at <a href="Berb%C3%A9rati">Berbérati</a>. A white public works agent, who had recently been reprimanded for his brutality toward Africans, announced that his cook and the cook's wife had died. A riot broke out and the governor sent in parachutists while armoured vehicles patrolled the streets. Boganda hesitated to appear in a village that was not one of his strongholds, but did so anyway and declared before the rioters that justice would be the same for blacks and whites. Upon hearing Boganda's words, the crowd became calm and dispersed.
He played a crucial role at the beginning of internal autonomy (1956–1958), although the relatively conservative Boganda remained sympathetic to French interests and still did not advocate immediate independence. For Boganda, the <a href="French%20legislative%20election%2C%201956">1956 election</a>, in which he took 89% of the vote against another Oubanguian, was an uncontested speaker's platform with which the colonial administration had come to terms; the French had realised that opposing him would be dangerous and sought to accommodate him. That year he agreed to European representation on election lists in exchange for the financial support of French business leaders, and on 18 November, was elected as the first mayor of Bangui. On 31 March 1957, MESAN won all seats in the <a href="Ubangi-Shari%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201957">Territorial Assembly election</a>; on 18 June, Boganda was elected president of the Grand Council of French Equatorial Africa (a forum he used to broadcast his views on African unity) and in May was appointed vice-president of the Oubangui-Chari Government Council (the French governor was still its president).

A pragmatist, Boganda spoke before the local assembly on 30 December 1957 in praise of the new Comité de Salut Economique, which envisioned joint administration of the economy between French colonials and MESAN territorial councilors (he called it "the union of capital and Oubanguian labour"), but lack of French investment and opposition by Oubanguians soon led him to turn away from the idea. With the numerous declarations of independence being made in much of Francophone Africa, Boganda advised that an independent Oubangui-Chari would face major economic problems from the onset. Instead, he advocated the independence of all of <a href="French%20Equatorial%20Africa">French Equatorial Africa</a> and its integration into a <a href="United%20States%20of%20Latin%20Africa">United States of Latin Africa</a> comprising the former French, Belgian, and <a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> colonies of Central Africa; he intended for Oubangui-Chari to become a federal unit within that structure. However, such a federation proved unrealistic, foundering on the rocks of regional jealousy and personal ambition, and Boganda came to accept a constitution covering only Oubangui-Chari as the Central African Republic. Thus, after 1 December 1958, when Boganda declared the establishment of the Central African Republic as an autonomous member of the French Community, the name was applied only to the former Oubangui-Chari. On 8 December, the CAR's first government came into being with Boganda as prime minister; a French governor remained in the country but was now called high commissioner. The new government began by adopting a law banning nudity and vagabondage, Boganda's missionary education still showing through. Its main task, however, was to draw up a constitution, which was democratic and modelled to some extent on that of France; this was approved by the assembly on 16 February 1959. Formal independence came later, on 13 August 1960.

Boganda was poised to become the first president of the independent CAR when he boarded a plane at Berbérati for a flight to Bangui on 29 March 1959, just prior to legislative elections. The aircraft exploded in midair over Boukpayanga in the <a href="Sub-prefectures%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic">sub-prefecture</a> of <a href="Boda%2C%20Lobaye">Boda</a> (about west of Bangui), killing all passengers and crew. No clear cause has ever been ascertained for the mysterious crash and no commission of inquiry was ever formed; sabotage was widely suspected. The nation was shocked at the death of its revered leader, whose funeral on 2 April at the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Bangui saw a great outpouring of grief from thousands of Oubanguians. The 7 May edition of the Paris weekly "<a href="L%27Express%20%28France%29">L'Express</a>" revealed that experts had found traces of explosive in the wreckage, but the French high commissioner banned the sale of that magazine edition when it appeared in the CAR. Many suspected that expatriate businessmen from the Bangui chamber of commerce, possibly aided by the French secret service, played a role. Michelle Jourdain was also suspected of being involved: by 1959, relations between Boganda and his wife had deteriorated, and he thought of leaving her and returning to the priesthood. She had a large insurance policy on his life, taken just days before the accident. According to Brian Titley, author of "Dark Age: The Political Odyssey of Emperor Bokassa", there are good reasons for suspecting her involvement in the plane crash.

<a href="Abel%20Goumba">Abel Goumba</a>, the vice-premier and finance minister whom Titley describes as "intelligent, honest, and strongly nationalistic", emerged as Boganda's logical successor. However, his close confidant and cousin, interior minister <a href="David%20Dacko">David Dacko</a>, more likely to lead a regime deferential to foreign interests, was backed by the high commissioner, Colonel Roger Barberot, with the support of the chamber of commerce and Michelle Jourdain. He thus brushed aside Goumba and by 1962 had shut down the opposition, with MESAN becoming the country's single party. The events after Boganda's death are strongly evocative of other French efforts to maintain economic domination by ensuring that compliant leaders came to power in its former colonies. It also robbed the country of a charismatic leader in the <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Houphou%C3%ABt-Boigny">Houphouët-Boigny</a> or <a href="L%C3%A9opold%20S%C3%A9dar%20Senghor">Senghor</a> mould, whose prestige alone might have sufficed to retain civilian rule, which ended when Bokassa deposed the unpopular Dacko in 1966.

Boganda is not only considered the hero and father of his nation but also as one of the great leaders of <a href="decolonization%20of%20Africa">decolonization in Africa</a>; the historian Georges Chaffard described him after his death as "the most prestigious and the most capable of Equatorial political men," while political historian <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Prunier">Gérard Prunier</a> called him "probably the most gifted and most inventive of French Africa's decolonization generation of politicians." Among the places named after him are an avenue in Bangui, one of the city's largest high schools, a Château Boganda and <a href="Barth%C3%A9lemy%20Boganda%20Stadium">Barthélemy Boganda Stadium</a>. 29 March, the anniversary of his death, is Boganda Day, a public holiday. Boganda was also the designer of the <a href="flag%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic">flag of the Central African Republic</a>, originally intended for the <a href="United%20States%20of%20Latin%20Africa">United States of Latin Africa</a>.

Boganda is one in a long line of African political leaders who, in an attempt to develop specifically national political cultures, were presented (or presented themselves) as the great national leader, glorified and sometimes nearly deified. They were hailed as the fathers of their nations and considered wise in the ways of understanding the best interests of their peoples. Others who became particular objects of hero-worship include <a href="L%C3%A9opold%20S%C3%A9dar%20Senghor">Léopold Sédar Senghor</a>, <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Houphou%C3%ABt-Boigny">Félix Houphouët-Boigny</a>, <a href="Moktar%20Ould%20Daddah">Moktar Ould Daddah</a>, <a href="Ahmed%20S%C3%A9kou%20Tour%C3%A9">Ahmed Sékou Touré</a>, <a href="Modibo%20Ke%C3%AFta">Modibo Keïta</a>, <a href="L%C3%A9on%20M%27ba">Léon M'ba</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Ouezzin%20Coulibaly">Daniel Ouezzin Coulibaly</a>. Boganda did little to discourage wide circulation of tales about his supernatural powers, putative invulnerability and even immortality. Shortly before his death, a large crowd waited on the shore of the <a href="Ubangui%20River">Ubangui River</a> to see him cross by walking upon the waters. He did not show up, but apparently a good many people still believed that he could have made the miraculous crossing. More than just a charismatic political leader, he was seen as the "black Christ", a great religious figure endowed with extraordinary powers. Along with <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Congo-Brazzaville</a>'s <a href="Fulbert%20Youlou">Fulbert Youlou</a>, who remained a priest while president, Boganda was not particularly concerned with his religious mission once he entered politics, but he unabashedly used the enormous popular respect for the Church and the cloth to political advantage. He successfully manipulated religious symbols (clerical garb, crosses, baptism, disciples, acolytes, etc.) for political purposes.

Once he died, his mystique grew: he was a national martyr, and miracles were regularly attributed to him. The Boganda myth continues to exercise a strong hold on many people in the CAR, and it has frequently been used by his successors in their appeals for national unity. Those who were related to him even tenuously, such as Bokassa (who was from the same village and minority ethnic group, was the son of his mother's uncle, justified his coup using Boganda's name and created a cult of Boganda as founder of the party and state), or Dacko (who posed as the ideological successor of Boganda by championing for "national reconciliation" during the <a href="Central%20African%20Republic%20presidential%20election%2C%201981">1981 election</a>) were able to capture some of his aura and use it to their advantage.

Louie Nunn

Louie Broady Nunn (March 8, 1924 – January 29, 2004) was the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Kentucky">52nd governor of Kentucky</a>. His election in 1967 made him the first <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> to hold that office since the end of <a href="Simeon%20Willis">Simeon Willis</a>' term in 1947, and the last to hold the position until the election of <a href="Ernie%20Fletcher">Ernie Fletcher</a> in 2003.

After rendering noncombat service in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and graduating from law school, Nunn entered local politics, becoming the first Republican <a href="county%20judge">county judge</a> in the history of <a href="Barren%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Barren County, Kentucky</a>. He worked on the campaigns of Republican candidates for national office, including <a href="John%20Sherman%20Cooper">John Sherman Cooper</a>, <a href="Thruston%20Morton">Thruston Morton</a>, and <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>. He was the Republican nominee for governor in 1963, but ultimately lost a close election to <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> <a href="Edward%20T.%20Breathitt">Ned Breathitt</a>. An executive order signed by Governor <a href="Bert%20T.%20Combs">Bert T. Combs</a> that desegregated Kentucky's public services became a major issue in the campaign. Nunn vowed to repeal the order if elected, while Breathitt promised to continue it.

In 1967, Nunn again ran for governor. After defeating <a href="Marlow%20Cook">Marlow Cook</a> in the Republican gubernatorial <a href="primary%20election">primary</a>, he eked out a victory over Democrat <a href="Henry%20Ward%20%28Kentucky%29">Henry Ward</a>. The state offices were split between Democrats and Republicans, and Nunn was saddled with a Democratic <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">lieutenant governor</a>, <a href="Wendell%20Ford">Wendell Ford</a>. Despite a Democratic majority in the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a>, Nunn was able to enact most of his priorities, including tax increases that funded improvements to the <a href="List%20of%20Kentucky%20state%20parks">state park system</a> and the construction of a statewide network of mental health centers. He oversaw the transition of <a href="Northern%20Kentucky%20University">Northern Kentucky University</a> from a <a href="community%20college">community college</a> to a senior institution and brought the <a href="University%20of%20Louisville">University of Louisville</a> into the state university system. The later years of his administration were marred by <a href="Louisville%20riots%20of%201968">race riots in Louisville</a> and a violent protest against the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a>. Following his term as governor, he lost to <a href="Walter%20Huddleston">Walter "Dee" Huddleston</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20elections%2C%201972">1972 senatorial election</a> and <a href="John%20Y.%20Brown%2C%20Jr.">John Y. Brown, Jr.</a> in the 1979 gubernatorial contest. In his later years, he sometimes supported the political ambitions of his son, <a href="Steve%20Nunn">Steve</a>, and advocated for the legalization of <a href="industrial%20hemp">industrial hemp</a> in Kentucky. He died of a heart attack on January 29, 2004.

Louie Broady Nunn was born in <a href="Park%2C%20Kentucky">Park, Kentucky</a> – a small community on the border of <a href="Barren%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Barren</a> and <a href="Metcalfe%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Metcalfe</a> counties – on March 8, 1924. His given name, Louie, honored a deceased friend of his father's; his middle name, Broady, was a surname in his mother's family. Louie was the youngest of the four sons born to Waller Harrison and Mary (Roberts) Nunn; their youngest child, Virginia, was their only daughter. The Nunns were farmers and operated a general store, though Waller suffered from a congenital heart condition and severe <a href="arthritis">arthritis</a> and was limited to light chores. The eldest brother, Lee Roy, became an influential campaigner and fundraiser for the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>.

Nunn obtained the first eight years of his education in a one-room, one-teacher schoolhouse in Park. During his teenage years, he gave himself a <a href="hernia">hernia</a> while lifting a heavy piece of farm equipment. This, combined with his father's health history, may have contributed to back pain issues that plagued him for most of his life. In 1938, he matriculated to Hiseville High School. He earned a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree at Bowling Green Business University, now <a href="Western%20Kentucky%20University">Western Kentucky University</a>.

After the <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">bombing of Pearl Harbor</a> on December 7, 1941, Nunn departed for <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, to take flying lessons in hopes of becoming a <a href="B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">B-17</a> pilot. By the time he finished his flight training, however, the <a href="United%20States%20Army">Army</a> had discontinued its air cadet program. On June 2, 1943, he enlisted in the Army and received his <a href="recruit%20training">recruit training</a> at <a href="Fort%20Wolters">Fort Wolters</a> near <a href="Fort%20Worth%2C%20Texas">Fort Worth, Texas</a>. He was transferred numerous times. First, he was stationed at <a href="Sheppard%20Air%20Force%20Base">Sheppard Air Force Base</a> near <a href="Wichita%20Falls%2C%20Texas">Wichita Falls, Texas</a>. Next, he was assigned to the <a href="97th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">97th Infantry Division</a>, then received additional training at <a href="Fort%20Leonard%20Wood%20%28military%20base%29">Fort Leonard Wood</a> in <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>. Finally, he transferred to the <a href="Medical%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Army Medical Corps</a>, but his back injury flared up, and he received a medical discharge on September 13, 1945. He held the rank of <a href="corporal">corporal</a> at the time of his discharge.

Following his military duty, Nunn pursued a pre-law degree at the <a href="University%20of%20Cincinnati">University of Cincinnati</a>. Three years later, he matriculated to the <a href="University%20of%20Louisville%20School%20of%20Law">University of Louisville School of Law</a> where he was a classmate of future congressman <a href="Marlow%20Cook">Marlow Cook</a>. Nunn earned his <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Laws">Bachelor of Laws</a> degree in 1950. He opened his legal practice in <a href="Glasgow%2C%20Kentucky">Glasgow, Kentucky</a>, in September 1950.

On October 12, 1950, Nunn married Beula Cornelius Aspley, a divorcee from Bond, Kentucky. The couple had two children – Jennie Lou, born in 1951, and <a href="Steve%20Nunn">Steve</a>, born in 1952. Aspley also had three children from her first marriage. Nunn left the <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> denomination in which he had been raised after marrying Aspley, joining her as a member of the <a href="Christian%20Church%20%28Disciples%20of%20Christ%29">Christian Church</a>.

On June 17, 1953, Nunn declared as a Republican candidate for <a href="county%20judge">county judge</a> and was ultimately the only Republican to declare. In the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> primary, one of the challengers charged that the incumbent had used his office for personal gain. In the wake of the investigation, a group of disgruntled Democrats formed an organization to elect Nunn, who defeated his Democratic challenger by a vote of 5,171 to 4,378, becoming the first Republican elected county judge in the history of the heavily Democratic county.

In 1956, Nunn served as statewide campaign manager for <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>'s presidential bid, as well as the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">senatorial</a> campaigns of <a href="John%20Sherman%20Cooper">John Sherman Cooper</a> and <a href="Thruston%20Morton">Thruston Morton</a>. The Kentucky Junior Chamber of Commerce named him "Young Man of the Year" in 1956. He was not a candidate for re-election as county judge in 1957, but was appointed as <a href="city%20attorney">city attorney</a> for the city of Glasgow in 1958. He considered running for governor in 1959, but became convinced it would be a bad year for Republicans and did not make the race. He managed successful re-election campaigns for Senator Cooper in 1960 and Senator Morton in 1962. He also managed the state campaign of presidential candidate <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> in 1960. Although <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> won the election, Nixon carried Kentucky 54% to 46%.

Nunn was the Republican nominee for <a href="governor%20of%20Kentucky">governor of Kentucky</a> in 1963. During the campaign, he attacked an executive order issued by sitting Democratic governor <a href="Bert%20T.%20Combs">Bert T. Combs</a> that desegregated public accommodations in the state. Calling the order "a dictatorial edict of questionable constitutionality", Nunn charged that it had been dictated by <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">U.S. Attorney General</a> <a href="Robert%20Kennedy">Robert Kennedy</a>. In a television appearance, Nunn displayed a copy of the order and declared "My first act will be to abolish this." "<a href="The%20New%20Republic">The New Republic</a>" accused him of conducting "the first outright segregationist campaign in Kentucky". He lost the election to Democrat <a href="Edward%20T.%20Breathitt">Ned Breathitt</a> by a margin of just over 13,000 votes.

In 1967, Nunn faced his old classmate, <a href="Jefferson%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Jefferson County</a> Judge Marlow Cook, in Kentucky's first Republican gubernatorial <a href="primary%20election">primary</a> in many years. Nunn attacked Cook as a "<a href="Liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States">liberal</a>, former New Yorker", and some of his supporters made reference to Cook's "Jewish backers". The injection of <a href="antisemitism">antisemitism</a> into the campaign drew criticism from Senator John Sherman Cooper, who threw his support to Cook. Nunn also attacked Cook for his Catholic faith, a tactic that proved particularly effective with the state's <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> voters. In a close vote, Nunn defeated Cook to secure the nomination.

Nunn then faced Democrat <a href="Henry%20Ward%20%28Kentucky%29">Henry Ward</a> in the general election. During the campaign, Nunn charged that Democrats wanted to raise taxes to pay for administrative inefficiencies. He also played up divisions within the Democratic party, and was endorsed by two-time former Democratic Governor <a href="Happy%20Chandler">A. B. "Happy" Chandler</a>. Nunn allied himself closely with the national Republican campaign against <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>, bringing several prominent Republicans to the state to speak for him. He won the election by a vote of 454,123 to 425,674, despite the fact that half of the other state offices went to Democrats, including the <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">lieutenant governorship</a>, won by <a href="Wendell%20Ford">Wendell Ford</a>.

The General Assembly was controlled by Democrats, but Nunn was able to pass most of his agenda. Despite a campaign promise not to raise taxes, when the outgoing Breathitt administration projected a shortfall of $24 million in the state budget, Nunn convinced the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a> to pass an increase in the motor vehicle license fee from $5.00 to $12.50 and raise the state <a href="sales%20tax">sales tax</a> from three percent to five percent. Nunn's budget focused on increased funding for education, mental health, and economic development. In the 1970 legislative session, the General Assembly enacted Nunn's proposals to eliminate taxes on prescription drugs and the use fee charged on vehicles transferred within families, but rejected his plans to reduce the <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a> for low-income families and increase tax credits for the blind and the elderly.

Nunn oversaw the entry of the <a href="University%20of%20Louisville">University of Louisville</a> into the state's public university system. Fulfilling a campaign promise, he helped transform Northern Kentucky Community College into Northern Kentucky State College (which later became <a href="Northern%20Kentucky%20University">Northern Kentucky University</a>), a four-year institution and member of the state university system. Historian <a href="Lowell%20H.%20Harrison">Lowell H. Harrison</a> argued that these actions diluted state support to existing higher education institutions. Nunn also supported the newly created <a href="Kentucky%20Educational%20Television">Kentucky Educational Television</a>.

Nunn doubled the accommodations in the <a href="List%20of%20Kentucky%20state%20parks">state park system</a>. <a href="Barren%20River%20Lake%20State%20Resort%20Park">Barren River Lake State Resort Park</a> was completed during his tenure, and three other parks were planned and funded during his administration. He also greatly improved the state mental health system. Under his leadership, a statewide network of 22 mental health centers was completed, and all four state psychiatric hospitals were accredited for the first time. Nunn called the revamping of the state mental health system his proudest accomplishment as governor. There was not total agreement between Nunn and the legislature, however. The governor vetoed one-quarter of the bills passed in the 1968 legislative session and 14 percent of those passed in the 1970 session. An <a href="fair%20housing">open housing</a> bill became law without Nunn's signature, and he also refused to sign the 1970 state budget as a form of protest. (Unsigned bills become law after ten days under the <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">Kentucky Constitution</a>, in contrast to the <a href="pocket%20veto">pocket veto</a> provision in the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">federal constitution</a>.)

A supporter of President Nixon's <a href="Law%20and%20order%20%28politics%29">law-and-order philosophies</a>, Nunn called out the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Guard">National Guard</a> to break up violent protests in the state. In May 1968, he sent the Guard to <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a> to break up <a href="Louisville%20riots%20of%201968">race-related protests</a> that followed peaceful <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> marches. This action was criticized by civil rights leaders across the state. In May 1970, Nunn again dispatched the Guard to quell protests against the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a>, and imposed a curfew that interfered with <a href="final%20examination">final examination</a>s. The latter protest culminated in the burning of one of the university's <a href="Reserve%20Officers%20Training%20Corps">ROTC</a> buildings.

From 1968 to 1969, Nunn served on the Executive Committee of the <a href="National%20Governors%20Association">National Governors' Conference</a> and, in 1971, chaired the <a href="Republican%20Governors%20Association">Republican Governors Association</a>. "<a href="The%20Courier-Journal">The Courier-Journal</a>" said of Nunn's administration "On the whole, his management of the state's finances has been sound. ... [H]e took a general fund facing a deficit, restored it to solvency, and kept it healthy. No scandals have marred the Nunn record. He chose able men to direct his revenue and finance departments, and their efficiency saved the state millions of dollars." Historian <a href="Thomas%20D.%20Clark">Thomas D. Clark</a> called Nunn the strongest of Kentucky's eight Republican governors. At the time, Kentucky governors could not serve consecutive terms; in the 1971 race, Nunn backed Tom Emberton, who lost to Ford.

Following his term as governor, Nunn opened a law practice in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington</a>. He campaigned for the retiring Cooper's seat in 1972, losing to Democrat <a href="Walter%20Huddleston">Walter "Dee" Huddleston</a>, a state senator who had managed Ford's campaign. His loss came despite a landslide victory for Richard Nixon in the state and was generally blamed on his advocacy of raising the sales tax to 5 percent from 3 percent in 1968. Democrats called him "Nickel Nunn." He continued working on behalf of Republican candidates, and backed <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s primary challenge to incumbent <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a> in 1975. His last run for office came in <a href="1979%20Kentucky%20gubernatorial%20election">1979</a> when he was again the Republican nominee for governor against Democrat <a href="John%20Y.%20Brown%2C%20Jr.">John Y. Brown, Jr.</a> He decried the excessive spending, expanding government, and increased state employment that had occurred under Democratic administrations. He also attacked Brown for his playboy image (he was married to former <a href="Miss%20America">Miss America</a> <a href="Phyllis%20George">Phyllis George</a>) and his refusal to release his tax returns, as well as his inexperience in government. Despite these attacks, Nunn lost by a vote of 558,008 to 381,278 and returned to his legal practice.

In the 1980s, Nunn served on the boards of regents of <a href="Morehead%20State%20University">Morehead State University</a> and <a href="Kentucky%20State%20University">Kentucky State University</a>. He served as a lecturer at <a href="Western%20Kentucky%20University">Western Kentucky University</a>, and received the Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Louisville in 1999. During the late 1980s, he criticized Senator <a href="Mitch%20McConnell">Mitch McConnell</a>, one of the emerging leaders of the state's Republican party, for not doing more to support other Republicans in their bids for office; McConnell maintained that he had to focus on his own reelection campaign in 1990. In 1988, Nunn unsuccessfully challenged <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Congressman</a> <a href="Jim%20Bunning">Jim Bunning</a> in his bid to retain his position as Kentucky's Republican national committeeman.

In 1994, Nunn's wife Beula filed for divorce from a hospital bed where she lay dying of cancer. She claimed she was trying to preserve some of her estate for her children. A Metcalfe County judge granted the divorce, but Nunn challenged the ruling, and it was later set aside. Some property issues were still pending at the time of Beula's death in 1995. During the divorce proceedings, Nunn's son Steve sided with his mother, causing a rift between him and his father. A 1994 letter from the elder Nunn alleged that Steve Nunn physically and verbally abused Louie Nunn and other members of his family. The letter was discovered in 2009 when Steve Nunn was charged with the murder of his former fiancée, Amanda Ross.

In 1999, Nunn again considered a bid for governor, precluding a potential bid by his son, Steve, a state representative from Glasgow. He cited personal and health issues for not making the race. In 2000, he backed the presidential campaign of Senator <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a>. Nunn reconciled with his son, and when Steve ran for governor in 2003, Louie supported him. After Steve Nunn ran third in a four-way primary, the elder Nunn supported the Republican nominee, Ernie Fletcher, hosting a fundraiser for him.

Nunn also became an advocate of legalizing <a href="industrial%20hemp">industrial hemp</a> in Kentucky, writing, "Frankly, I was opposed to the legalization of hemp for years because I had been of the opinion hemp was <a href="marijuana">marijuana</a>. I was short-sighted in my thinking, and I was wrong." In 2000, Nunn secured an acquittal for actor <a href="Woody%20Harrelson">Woody Harrelson</a>, who came to <a href="Lee%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Lee County, Kentucky</a>, and planted hemp seeds in open defiance of Kentucky's law forbidding the cultivation of hemp. Later, he traveled to <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a> where, at the base of <a href="Mount%20Rushmore">Mount Rushmore</a>, he publicly presented an <a href="Oglala%20Lakota">Oglala Lakota</a> leader with bales of hemp after the tribe's crop was confiscated by officers from the federal <a href="Drug%20Enforcement%20Administration">Drug Enforcement Administration</a>.

Louie B. Nunn died of a heart attack at his home just outside <a href="Versailles%2C%20Kentucky">Versailles, Kentucky</a>, on January 29, 2004, hours after hosting a luncheon with labor leaders seeking help in dealing with the newly elected Fletcher administration. He was buried at the Cosby Methodist Church cemetery in <a href="Hart%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Hart County, Kentucky</a>. The Cumberland Parkway was renamed the <a href="Louie%20B.%20Nunn%20Cumberland%20Parkway">Louie B. Nunn Cumberland Parkway</a> in 2000, and the main lodge at the Barren River Lake State Resort Park is also named in Nunn's honor.

Ludwigsburg Palace

Ludwigsburg Palace (Residenzschloss Ludwigsburg), also known as the "<a href="Versailles">Versailles</a> of <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>", is a 452-room palace complex of 18 buildings located in <a href="Ludwigsburg">Ludwigsburg</a>, <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a>, Germany. Its total area, including the gardens, is —the largest palatial estate in the country. The palace has four wings: the northern wing, the Alter Hauptbau, is the oldest and was used as a ducal residence; the east and west wings were used for court purposes and housing guests and courtiers; the southern wing, the Neuer Hauptbau, was built to house more court functions and was later used as a residence.

<a href="Eberhard%20Louis%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Eberhard Louis, Duke of Württemberg</a>, appointed Philipp Joseph Jenisch to direct the work and construction began in 1704. In 1707, Jenisch was replaced with <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Nette">Johann Friedrich Nette</a>, who completed the majority of the palace and surrounding gardens. Nette died in 1714, and <a href="Donato%20Giuseppe%20Frisoni">Donato Giuseppe Frisoni</a> finished much of the palace <a href="facades">facades</a>. In the final year of construction, Eberhard Louis died and the Neue Hauptbau's interiors were left incomplete. <a href="Charles%20Eugene%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Charles Eugene</a>'s court architect, <a href="Philippe%20de%20La%20Gu%C3%AApi%C3%A8re">Philippe de La Guêpière</a>, completed and refurbished parts of the New Hauptbau in the <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a> style, especially the palace theatre. Charles Eugene abandoned the palace for <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> in 1775. Duke Frederick II, later King Frederick I, began using Ludwigsburg as his summer residence in the last years of Charles Eugene's reign. Frederick and his wife <a href="Charlotte%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Charlotte, Princess Royal</a>, resided at Ludwigsburg and employed <a href="Nikolaus%20Friedrich%20von%20Thouret">Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret</a> to renovate the palace in the <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">Neoclassical style</a>. Thouret converted much of Ludwigsburg's interiors over the reign of Frederick and later life of Charlotte. As a result of each architect's work, Ludwigsburg is a combination of Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassical, and <a href="Empire%20style">Empire style</a> architecture.

The constitutions of the <a href="Free%20People%27s%20State%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Free People's State</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Kingdom of Württemberg</a> were ratified at Ludwigsburg Palace in 1919 and 1819, respectively. It was the residence for four of Württemberg's monarchs and some other members of the <a href="House%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">House of Württemberg</a> and their families. The palace was opened to the public in 1918 and then survived <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> intact. It later underwent periods of restoration in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1990s and again for the palace's 300th anniversary in 2004. The palace had more than 350,000 visitors in 2017 and has hosted the <a href="Ludwigsburg%20Festival">Ludwigsburg Festival</a> every year since 1947.

Surrounding the palace are the Blooming Baroque ("Blühendes Barock") gardens, arranged in 1954 as they might have appeared in 1800. Nearby is <a href="Schloss%20Favorite%2C%20Ludwigsburg">Schloss Favorite</a>, a <a href="lustschloss">hunting lodge</a> built in 1717 by Frisoni. Within the palace are two museums operated by the <a href="Landesmuseum%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Landesmuseum Württemberg</a> dedicated to <a href="fashion">fashion</a> and <a href="porcelain">porcelain</a> respectively.

"Ludwigsburg," meaning "Louis's castle," was named after its builder, <a href="Eberhard%20Louis%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Eberhard Louis, Duke of Württemberg</a>, in 1705. It had been previously known as the Erlachhof, a traditional hunting estate and lodge of the Dukes of Württemberg that was destroyed in 1692, during the <a href="Nine%20Years%27%20War">Nine Years' War</a>. Eberhard Louis commissioned a replacement lodge that was built from 1697 to 1701. Construction was interrupted by the beginning of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, fought against <a href="Kingdom%20of%20France">France</a> and <a href="Electorate%20of%20Bavaria">Bavaria</a>. Württemberg resisted entry into the war until late 1702. Two years later, Eberhard Louis participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Blenheim">Battle of Blenheim</a> in August 1704 that was followed by the exile of the Bavarian Elector. The duke used the battle to press claims to Bavarian lands, but he illegally occupied those lands and was further weakened by a French invasion of Württemberg in 1707. As a result of this attack, the ducal residence in the capital, <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, was burned and the royal family fled to Switzerland. With the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Utrecht">Treaty of Utrecht</a> in 1713, the occupied Bavarian territory and status of the exiled Elector were restored.

Construction of Ludwigsburg Palace began in May 1704 with the laying of the Alter Hauptbau's <a href="cornerstone">cornerstone</a> by Eberhard Louis. The year before, he sent to study architecture abroad. Eberhard Louis made Jenisch director of construction upon his return the next year, but he only managed to finish the Alter Hauptbau's (Old main building) first floor and some of the southern garden before 1707. The duke spent the winter of 1705–06 at <a href="Nymphenburg%20Palace">Nymphenburg Palace</a>, residence of the Elector of Bavaria, and was impressed by what he saw there and in architectural publications. Unable to compete with Bavaria militarily or politically, and defiant following the loss of the Stuttgart residence, Eberhard Louis decided to follow the example of Bavaria, <a href="Baden-Durlach">Baden-Durlach</a>, and the <a href="Rhineland%20Palatinate">Rhineland Palatinate</a>. He elected to build a new palace and town inspired by <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Versailles</a>, which would be the center of his domestic society and diplomacy. Located from Stuttgart, Eberhard Louis could set up a court with his mistress, <a href="Wilhelmine%20von%20Gr%C3%A4venitz">Wilhelmine von Grävenitz</a>, and demonstrate his absolutist status as a monarch. Eberhard Louis lost faith in Jenisch's ability and in 1707 replaced him with <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Nette">Johann Friedrich Nette</a>, an engineer. Two years later, in 1709, it was apparent that the massive undertaking of the palace's construction eventually necessitated the building of a town, also known as <a href="Ludwigsburg">Ludwigsburg</a>. That cost of construction provoked financial consequences, opposition at court, and criticism from the populace. A major retrenchment of court functions took place in 1709 that shrank the orchestra to eight members. That same year, after a fatal workplace accident at the palace, a <a href="pastor">pastor</a> in nearby said of the palace at his pulpit, "May God spare our land the chastising that the Ludwigsburg brood of sinners conjure."

Nette was now charged with building a complete Baroque palace from Jenisch's central "<a href="corps%20de%20logis">corps de logis</a>", to which an east wing and a west wing were to be added, aligned at 11°. Nette based his plans on those of Jenisch, enabling him to complete his design for a three-wing palace in the same year as his appointment. The galleries of the Alter Hauptbau were completed in 1707, then the "corps de logis" the next year. The Ordensbau and Riesenbau were constructed from 1709 to 1713, and their interiors were completed in 1714. Nette began the interior of the Alter Hauptbau, which he would never finish. Construction of the building's pavilions dragged on into 1722. Nette made two trips to Prague and his native <a href="Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a> to expand his pool of talent. He hired , Tomasso Soldati, and <a href="Donato%20Giuseppe%20Frisoni">Donato Giuseppe Frisoni</a> in 1708, Andreas Quitainner in 1709, and then <a href="Luca%20Antonio%20Colomba">Luca Antonio Colomba</a>, Riccardo Retti and <a href="Diego%20Francesco%20Carlone">Diego Francesco Carlone</a>. Nette fled to Paris from an accusation of <a href="embezzlement">embezzlement</a> from Jenisch's allies but was ordered back to Ludwigsburg by Eberhard Louis. On his return trip, he died suddenly of a stroke on 9 December 1714 in <a href="Nancy%2C%20France">Nancy</a> at the age of 41. At the time of his death, most of the northern section of the modern palace and its northern garden was complete.

Eberhard Louis stunted an attempt by Jenisch to reprise his previous role as director, replacing Nette in 1715 with Frisoni. Frisoni, although having no formal training in architecture, enjoyed the support of the court <a href="Chamberlain%20%28office%29">chamberlain</a> and impressed the duke with his stucco work in the Alter Hauptbau. Frisoni resumed construction with the palace's churches, beginning the Schlosskapelle in 1716 and the Ordenskapelle in 1720, then finished the Kavalierbauten (<a href="Cavalier%20house">Cavaliers' Buildings</a>) in 1722. Frisoni also added the <a href="mansard%20roof">mansard roof</a> to the top of the Alter Hauptbau, as its flat roof was prone to water damage. This had become a common issue with Nette's work because of the pressure the duke placed on him to finish the palace as soon as possible. Frisoni's work thus far led him to believe that he did not have a large enough talent pool to satisfy the duke's desires for the palace and town, so Frisoni brought in and Paolo Retti, his brother and son-in-law respectively, who were followed by Diego Carlone in 1718.

In 1721, the duke began to run out of room in the Alter Hauptbau for the functions of his court and Frisoni began planning to enlarge it. The duke dismissed the idea in 1724 and ordered Frisoni to construct the Neuer Hauptbau. Frisoni designed a four-story structure, double the height of the existing palace, but plans changed several times after construction began in 1725 atop the first terrace of the south garden. Frisoni settled on a three-story building that still afforded Eberhard Louis six rooms for his suite to the three in the Alter Hauptbau. To connect the Neuer Hauptbau to the existing palace, Frisoni built the Bildergalerie and Festinbau on the west side, and the Ahnengalerie and Schlosstheater (Palace theater) on the east. The Bildergalerie and Ahnengalerie were decorated from 1731 to 1733. With the exception of the interiors of the Neuer Hauptbau and Schlosstheater, all work was finished in 1733, but Eberhard Louis died that same year. Only a few rooms in the west end of the Neuer Hauptbau had been completed when he died. Construction of the Neuer Hauptbau and its connecting galleries cost 465,000 <a href="guilder">guilder</a>s and was managed by Paolo Retti, who at times had more than 650 <a href="stone%20masons">stone masons</a>, cutters, and basic laborers working on the <a href="facade">facade</a>s between 1726 and 1728. Construction of Ludwigsburg Palace cost the Duchy of Württemberg 3,000,000 <a href="florins">florins</a>.

Eberhard Louis left no heirs and was succeeded by <a href="Charles%20Alexander%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Charles Alexander</a>. Charles Alexander ended funding for the palace, dismissed its staff, and moved the capital back to <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> in 1733 to modernize <a href="Army%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Württemberg's army</a> and fortifications. As central figures in the construction of what was now decried as the "sin palace", Frisoni and Paolo Retti were arrested in 1733 on fraudulent charges of embezzlement. The two men were acquitted in 1735 after they paid a hefty fine to the ducal treasury, despite attempted intervention by the <a href="Margrave%20of%20Ansbach">Margrave of Ansbach</a> to free them earlier. Frisoni died in Ludwigsburg on 29 November 1735. Charles Alexander himself died suddenly two years later on 12 March 1737 as he prepared to leave Ludwigsburg Palace to inspect the duchy's fortresses. After his death, the nine-year-old <a href="Charles%20Eugene%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Charles Eugene</a> became Duke, beginning a regency that lasted until 1744.

Charles Eugene began the construction of <a href="New%20Palace%20%28Stuttgart%29">a new palace in Stuttgart</a> in 1746 but unofficially used Ludwigsburg as his residence until 1775. The function of certain rooms at Ludwigsburg changed frequently; converted the Ordenskapelle to a <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> church from 1746 to 1748 for Duchess <a href="Margravine%20Elisabeth%20Fredericka%20Sophie%20of%20Brandenburg-Bayreuth">Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie</a>. Beginning in 1757 and lasting into the next year, the suites of the <a href="beletage">beletage</a> were extensively modified by <a href="Philippe%20de%20La%20Gu%C3%AApi%C3%A8re">Philippe de La Guêpière</a>. La Guêpière completed the Schlosstheater in 1758–59, adding a stage, machinery, and the auditorium. A wooden <a href="opera%20house">opera house</a>, adorned with mirrors, was constructed in 1764–65, located east of the Alter Hauptbau. Although Charles Eugene officially declared Ludwigsburg Palace his residence in 1764, he made no further modifications after 1770. The palace that had hosted a court that <a href="Giacomo%20Casanova">Giacomo Casanova</a> called "the most magnificent in Europe" began a steady decline. Charles Eugene died without a legitimate heir in 1793 and was succeeded by his brother, <a href="Frederick%20II%20Eugene%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Frederick II Eugene</a>, who was succeeded by his son <a href="Frederick%20I%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Frederick II</a> in 1797. Ludwigsburg Palace had already been Frederick II's summer residence since 1795, and he continued to use it as such with Duchess <a href="Charlotte%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Charlotte</a> after marrying her on 18 May 1797.

<a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s armies occupied Württemberg from 1800–01, forcing the duke and duchess to flee to <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>. The royals returned when Frederick II agreed in 1803 to pledge allegiance to Napoleon and part with Württemberg's territory on the <a href="Left%20Bank%20of%20the%20Rhine">Left Bank</a>, an area of . In exchange, according <a href="Treaty%20of%20Lun%C3%A9ville">Treaty of Lunéville</a>, Frederick II was named an <a href="Elector-prince">Elector-prince</a> and given of Right Bank territory. Frederick II, now Elector Frederick I, now tasked his court architect <a href="Nikolaus%20Friedrich%20von%20Thouret">Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret</a> with renovating the palace in the <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">Neoclassical style</a>. Thouret started in the Ahengalerie and the Ordensbau, working there from 1803 to 1806. For two days in October 1805, Napoleon visited Ludwigsburg to coerce Frederick I into joining the <a href="Confederation%20of%20the%20Rhine">Confederation of the Rhine</a> and thus becoming his ally, <a href="German%20mediatization">compensating Württemberg with neighboring territories</a> in the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and Frederick I with the title of <a href="King">King</a>. Frederick I again tasked Thouret with a remodeling, from 1808 to 1811, of the Ordenskapelle and the king's apartment. The final modernizations ordered by the king took place from 1812 to 1816 in the Schlosstheater and Marble Hall. During this time, the ceiling frescoes of the Guard Room and the main staircases of the Neuer Hauptbau were repainted. By the time Frederick I died in 1816, the majority of the palace had been converted to reflect the latest style.

Following her husband's death, Charlotte continued to reside at Ludwigsburg, receiving visitors such as her siblings. She tasked Thouret with the renovation of her own apartment, which was carried out between 1816 and 1824. The <a href="dowager%20queen">dowager queen</a> died at the palace on 5 October 1828 following a bout of <a href="apoplexy">apoplexy</a>. Charlotte was the last ruler of Württemberg to reside at Ludwigsburg, as Frederick's son and successor, <a href="William%20I%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">William I</a>, and future kings did not show any interest in the palace. Members of the House of Württemberg continued to reside at the palace into the early 20th century, while the Württembergs moved to <a href="Bebenhausen%20Abbey">Bebenhausen Abbey</a> after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918.

In 1817, ownership of Ludwigsburg Palace passed from the <a href="House%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">House of Württemberg</a> to the government of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Kingdom of Württemberg</a>, which established offices there the next year. King <a href="William%20I%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">William I</a> chose the Order Hall, the <a href="throne%20room">throne room</a> of his father, for the ratification of the kingdom's constitution in 1819. The palace's first restoration took place at the Alter Hauptbau in 1865.

On 9 November 1918, the King of Württemberg was dissolved with the abdication of King <a href="Wilhelm%20II%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Wilhelm II</a>. Ludwigsburg Palace was opened to the public that same year and a new constitution was ratified for the <a href="Free%20People%27s%20State%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Free People's State of Württemberg</a> on 12 January 1919. At this time, two apartments at Ludwigsburg Palace were still occupied by members of the House of Württemberg, Duke Ulrich and <a href="Duchess%20Olga%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Princess Olga</a>. The new state ordered them vacated until 1 April for the ratification. Ulrich moved out of Ludwigsburg in January, but Olga rented a new suite in the Neuer Hauptbau in February. She continuing residing at Ludwigsburg in her apartment with her family until her death in 1932.

The Schlosstheater hosted the <a href="W%C3%BCrttemberg%20State%20Theatre">Württemberg State Theatre</a> for a production of Handel's "<a href="Rodelinda%20%28opera%29">Rodelinda</a>" in 1923, the first musical performance at the palace since 1853. In the early 1930s, began hosting the Ludwigsburger Schloßkonzerte (Ludwigsburg Palace Concerts), which comprised six to ten concerts annually from 1933 to 1939. The palace survived <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> unscathed, though its furnishings were removed in 1944–45 and held at the monasteries at <a href="Alpirsbach">Alpirsbach</a> and <a href="Lorch%20%28W%C3%BCrttemberg%29">Lorch</a>. It was chosen as the site of the <a href="Borkum%20Island%20war%20crimes%20trial">Borkum Island war crimes trial</a> in 1946. The concerts resumed in 1947 with 34 performances, a record that would not be broken until 1979. In 1952, the concerts were packed into a single week as the Ludwigsburger Schloßtage ("Palace Days"). They gained national significance when President <a href="Theodor%20Heuss">Theodor Heuss</a> attended a production of Mozart's "<a href="La%20clemenza%20di%20Tito">Titus</a>" two years later. The concerts were named Ludwigsburger Schloßfestspiele in 1966, and were internationally known as the <a href="Ludwigsburg%20Festival">Ludwigsburg Festival</a>. In 1980, the state of <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a> made the festival an official state event. On 9 September 1962, <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> delivered his "speech to the German youth" in the courtyard of Ludwigsburg Palace to 20,000 people.

Restorations were undertaken in the 1950s and 1960s and again in the 1990s, in time for the palace's tricentenary in 2004. The anniversary was commemorated by the state government with three new museums. On 19 October 2011, Minister-President <a href="Winfried%20Kretschmann">Winfried Kretschmann</a> hosted a reception for the U.S. Army's <a href="21st%20Theater%20Sustainment%20Command">21st Theater Sustainment Command</a> at the palace, which was attended by <a href="John%20D.%20Gardner">John D. Gardner</a>, former deputy commander of <a href="EUCOM">EUCOM</a>, and , commander of all German troops in <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a>. Ludwigsburg appeared again on Federal postage stamps in the "Burgen und Schlösser" series. The 50th anniversary of Charles de Gaulle's speech at Ludwigsburg was celebrated on 22 September 2012 and included appearances by German Chancellor <a href="Angela%20Merkel">Angela Merkel</a>, Minister-President Kretschmann, and French President <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Hollande">François Hollande</a>. Merkel and Hollande both spoke at the event, the former directly referencing de Gaulle's speech in <a href="French%20language">French</a>. A painting of <a href="Frederick%20the%20Great">Frederick the Great</a> on display was found to be a rare original by <a href="Antoine%20Pesne">Antoine Pesne</a> in November 2017. Michael Hörrmann – the director of the – valued the portrait at a minimum of €1 million. Baden-Württemberg's Minister of Finance, visited Ludwigsburg to see the painting and attend a press conference, where she spoke about the cultural importance of Ludwigsburg Palace.

In 2017, 350,642 people visited Ludwigsburg Palace. By March 2020, Staatliche Schlösser und Gärten Baden-Württemberg plans to have spent €4 million to furnish the Neuer Hauptbau as it would have been during the reign of King Frederick I. To this end, about 500 paintings, 400 pieces of furniture, and 500 lamps, clocks, and sculptures – will be sourced, sorted, and restored.

Ludwigsburg Palace's <a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque architecture</a> was built under Eberhard Louis from 1704 to 1733 and is characterized by a great deal of Austrian and <a href="Czech%20Baroque%20architecture">Czech Baroque</a> influence. This is most evident in the two churches, which resemble the Hospital Church of <a href="Kuks">Kuks</a> and the in <a href="Steyr">Steyr</a>. The palace's two Baroque architects, <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Nette">Johann Friedrich Nette</a> and <a href="Donato%20Giuseppe%20Frisoni">Donato Frisoni</a>, were educated and worked in Bohemia and hired staff experienced in the Bohemian style. Frisoni even knew or was related to some of the artisans who worked at the Steyr church. French influence is also present, visible for example in the mirror halls in both the "<a href="corps%20de%20logis">corps de logis</a>" and the palace's many <a href="mansard%20roof">mansard roof</a>s. The combination of work by Germans (Philipp Jenisch and Nette) and Italians (Frisoni, <a href="Diego%20Francesco%20Carlone">Diego</a> and <a href="Carlo%20Carlone">Carlo Carlone</a>, , Scotti and <a href="Luca%20Antonio%20Colomba">Luca Antonio Colomba</a>) produced a strong resemblance to late 17th century works in <a href="Prague">Prague</a> and <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>. <a href="Charles%20Eugene%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Charles Eugene</a> brought the <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a> style to Ludwigsburg in 1747 and his court architect, <a href="Philippe%20de%20La%20Gu%C3%AApi%C3%A8re">Philippe de La Guêpière</a>, worked in that style until 1775.

<a href="Nikolaus%20Friedrich%20von%20Thouret">Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret</a>, working with <a href="Antonio%20Isopi">Antonio Isopi</a>, renovated much of Ludwigsburg Palace for <a href="Frederick%20I%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Frederick I</a> and <a href="Charlotte%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Charlotte Mathilde</a> from 1797 to 1824. Thouret's work was heavily influenced by the <a href="Empire%20style">French Imperial</a> and <a href="Renaissance%20architecture">Renaissance styles</a>, the work of <a href="Charles%20Percier">Charles Percier</a> and <a href="Pierre%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20L%C3%A9onard%20Fontaine">Pierre François Léonard Fontaine</a>, and <a href="Egyptian%20art">Egyptian motifs</a> that became popular in Europe with <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s <a href="French%20campaign%20in%20Egypt%20and%20Syria">three-year Egyptian campaign</a>. Isopi would simplify Thouret's plans, which were then carried out by the <a href="Biedermeier">Biedermeier</a> woodworker Johannes Klinckerfuß and court painter Jean Pernaux. As a result, the palace's <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">Neoclassical architecture</a> does not reflect a single style or correspond to any one designer.

The north wing, referred to as the Alter Hauptbau (Old Main building), is the oldest portion of the palace. It was originally built to house the apartments of Eberhard Louis and <a href="Henrietta%20Maria%20of%20Brandenburg-Schwedt">Princess Henrietta Maria</a>. Its facade was built from 1705 to 1708 and its interiors were mostly completed by 1715, although work inside its <a href="pavilion">pavilion</a>s lasted into 1722. In 1809, and from 1826 to 1828, the rooms facing the courtyard in the "<a href="beletage">beletage</a>" (main floor) were remodeled in the Neoclassical style, but their Baroque frescoes were revealed in 1865. The "<a href="corps%20de%20logis">corps de logis</a>" opens with a wide <a href="Vestibule%20%28architecture%29">vestibule</a>, decorated by Frisoni in 1712, that terminates in an unadorned staircase. At the top of the stairs is a guard room and the four suites on the "beletage". These follow the <a href="French%20Baroque%20architecture">French Baroque</a> model of a living room, audience chamber, and bedroom. Eberhard Louis's apartment features a hall of mirrors decorated with <a href="stucco">stucco</a> by Frisoni and a hidden staircase, since removed, into the room of his mistress <a href="Wilhelmine%20von%20Gr%C3%A4venitz">Wilhelmine von Grävenitz</a>. The third floor, finished in 1708, houses two galleries. The first takes up most of the south wall and served as a portrait gallery and "<a href="ahnentafel">ahnentafel</a>" (table of ancestors), with stucco portraits of Eberhard Louis and his ancestors created by Frisoni and Soldati in 1713. The ceiling fresco were lost in the 1808 renovation that divided into smaller rooms. The gallery was restored to between 2000 and 2004. Above the third floor is a mansard roof that now houses <a href="Zwiefalten%20Abbey">Zwiefalten Abbey</a>'s original <a href="clockwork">clockwork</a>, taken from by King Frederick I in 1809.

The two pavilions to the west and east of the "corps de logis" are connected to it by arcaded galleries, completed in 1713 and 1715 respectively, that close off the northern edge of the "<a href="cour%20d%27honneur">cour d'honneur</a>". The western gallery celebrates peace with stucco statuary, medallions, and reliefs of the <a href="Judgement%20of%20Paris">Judgement of Paris</a>, <a href="Aeneas">Aeneas</a> fleeing <a href="Troy">Troy</a>, <a href="Hercules">Hercules</a> and <a href="Omphale">Omphale</a>, and <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> and <a href="Daphne">Daphne</a>. Its terminus, the Jagdpavillon (Hunting pavilion), contains the "Marmorsaletta" (Little marble hall) decorated with <a href="scagliola">scagliola</a> by Riccardo Retti and frescoes by Luca Antonio Colomba. Adjoined to the hall are three cabinet rooms, the first and third of which are decorated with Turkish and <a href="Chinoiserie">Chinese imagery</a> respectively. The eastern gallery celebrates war with stucco <a href="Trophy%20of%20arms">trophy captives and weapons</a>, reliefs of Eberhard Louis's monogram, and depictions of the <a href="cardinal%20virtues">cardinal virtues</a> and the <a href="classical%20elements">classical elements</a>. Spanning the entire gallery is Colomba's ceiling fresco of the <a href="Gigantomachy">Gigantomachy</a>, the war between the <a href="Olympian%20gods">Olympian gods</a> and the giants. At the end of the gallery is the Spielpavillon, completed in 1716, whose center is a rounded, cruciform hall with four corner rooms that contain imitation <a href="Delftware">Delftware</a> images of <a href="Jacques%20Callot">Jacques Callot</a>'s "Grotesque Dwarves". The dome fresco by Colomba and depicts the four seasons and their corresponding zodiac signs.

The first structure of the eastern wing is the Riesenbau (Giants' building), built by Johann Friedrich Nette in 1712–13. The <a href="Vestibule%20%28architecture%29">vestibule</a>, decorated by Andreas Quittainer and Colomba, prominently features two sphinxes and four giants as the <a href="Atlas%20%28architecture%29">atlases</a> under the staircase to the "beletage". Originally, these stairs led up to a room for the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Crown%20%28W%C3%BCrttemberg%29">Hunting Order</a>, which was segregated into residences from 1720 to 1723. Ahead of the giants is a statue of <a href="Minerva">Minerva</a>, and the frescoes on the ceiling above the staircase show <a href="Justitia">Justitia</a> and Fortitudo, the four seasons, and the four classical elements. In 1810, the rooms on the "beletage" were remodeled in the Neoclassical style, but they were restored to the Baroque style and opened as a museum in the 1950s. The apartments of <a href="Crown%20Prince%20Friedrich%20Ludwig">Frederick Louis</a> and Charles Alexander were decorated by Frisoni and Colomba, but Charles Alexander's apartment also features a landscape painting by .

Directly south of the Riesenbau is the Östlicher Kavalierbau (East Cavaliers' Building), built from 1715 to 1719 for housing <a href="courtiers">courtiers</a>. It contains four apartments on both floors, decorated with stucco ornament by Riccardo Retti and an original fresco on the ceiling of the "beletage" by Leopoldo Retti. The southwestern apartment on the second floor contains a museum dedicated to the Schlosstheater (Palace theater), attached by a gallery to the Östlicher Kavalierbau and the Schlosskapelle. Europe's oldest theater was constructed by Frisoni from 1729 to 1733 but was first furnished in 1758–59 by La Guêpière, who added the <a href="Stage%20%28theatre%29">stage</a>, <a href="auditorium">auditorium</a>, and machinery. Thouret remodeled the Schlosstheater in Neoclassical in 1811–12. <a href="Casanova">Casanova</a> is known to have visited the Schlosstheater, making notes on the performances held there.

The Schlosskapelle (Palace chapel) was built from 1716 to 1724. The chapel is made up of a <a href="Rotunda%20%28architecture%29">rotunda</a> with three <a href="semi-domes">semi-domes</a> and a private box for the duke and his family, accessed from the second floor. The box was painted around 1731 with the story of <a href="David">David</a> and given its red velvet wallpaper and a ceiling fresco by <a href="Livio%20Retti">Livio Retti</a>. The chapel was painted by Frisoni, Colomba, and <a href="Carlo%20Carlone">Carlo Carlone</a>, who were restricted by Protestant doctrine to illustrations of biblical topics, such as the <a href="Apostles">Apostles</a> and scenes from the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>. A <a href="crypt">crypt</a> under the chapel is the burial site of all rulers of Württemberg from Duke Eberhard Louis to King Frederick I. The Schlosskapelle did not receive any major remodeling in the 19th century.

The southernmost part of the east wing is the <a href="ahnentafel">Ahnengalerie</a>, built in 1729 and long. The original ceiling frescoes by Carlo Carlone, which illustrate the story of <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a>, were moved to the Bildergalerie after their completion in 1732. Instead, Carlone painted an homage to Eberhard Louis from 1731 to 1733, glorifying his reign with depictions of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>, <a href="Apelles">Apelles</a>, <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a>, <a href="Mars%20%28mythology%29">Mars</a>, <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>, <a href="Phobos%20%28mythology%29">Phobos</a>, and the <a href="Muses">Muses</a>, among others. Frederick I had Thouret remodel the Ahnengalerie in 1805–06, retaining Carlone's frescoes and adding stucco to the two antechambers. The portraits in the Ahnengalerie trace the lineage of the <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">rulers of Württemberg</a> from <a href="Eberhard%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Eberhard I the Bearded</a>, the first <a href="Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Duke of Württemberg</a>, to <a href="Wilhelm%20II%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Wilhelm II</a>, the last <a href="King%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">King of Württemberg</a>.

The first building of the west wing is the Ordensbau (Order building, in reference to the ducal <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Crown%20%28W%C3%BCrttemberg%29">Order of the Golden Eagle</a>), containing three apartments on the ground floor and the <a href="banquet%20hall">banquet hall</a>. The vestibule features a ceiling fresco of <a href="Pheme">Pheme</a> with a <a href="Genius%20%28mythology%29">genius</a>. Pictures of Hercules adorn its walls and continue into the stairwell. The <a href="antechamber">antechamber</a> of the Order Hall is decorated with stucco reliefs of <a href="cherubs">cherubs</a>, masks, birds, and weapons by Tomasso Soldati and Frisoni. The Order Hall's stucco was also by Soldati and Frisoni, but the ceiling fresco is a later repainting by Scotti and Baroffio in 1731, as the original by Colomba was damaged by water and removed. King Frederick I had the Hall renovated into a throne room in 1805–06 and moved the ceremonies of the Order to the Ordenskapelle. Thouret designed the king's throne and <a href="baldachin">baldachin</a>, opposite 's 1808 portrait of the king. It was in the Order Hall that the constitutions of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Kingdom</a> and the <a href="Free%20People%27s%20State%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Free People's State of Württemberg</a> were ratified in 1819 and 1919, respectively.

Immediately southwest of the Ordensbau is the oval Ordenskapelle (Order chapel), built from 1715 to 1723. The Ordenskapelle was remodeled from 1746 to 1748 by on behalf of Duke Charles Eugene for Duchess <a href="Margravine%20Elisabeth%20Fredericka%20Sophie%20of%20Brandenburg-Bayreuth">Elisabeth Fredericka</a>. Leger removed the floor between the chapel and a second-floor Order hall and reused existing pilasters for new Rococo decor by Pietro Brilli. Retti painted scenes from the <a href="Life%20of%20Jesus%20in%20the%20New%20Testament">life of Jesus</a> on the ceiling. On the second floor is the duchess's box, decorated in 1747–48 with stucco and frescoes of the <a href="Nativity%20of%20Jesus">birth of Christ</a> and allegories of <a href="Theological%20virtues">faith, hope, and love</a>. In 1798, Frederick I moved the Ordenskapelle's church functions to the Schlosskapelle. Nine years later, he designated it for use by the Order of the Golden Eagle and tasked Thouret with remodeling it in the Empire style. Thouret walled up the first-floor windows in 1807–08 for additional seating room and for the king's canopied throne under its star-studded <a href="semidome">semidome</a>.

The Westlicher Kavalierbau (West Cavaliers' building) is attached to the Ordenskapelle, identical in layout and design to its eastern counterpart. It was built in 1719–20, and retains some original stucco and ceiling frescoes by Riccardo and Retti. The Festinbau, attached to the Westlicher Kavalierbau, was originally designed as a kitchen built from 1729 to 1733, and used from 1770 to 1775 as a theater. Since 2004, the Westlicher Kavalierbau and Festinbau have housed a <a href="fashion%20museum">fashion museum</a>. The actual kitchen, the Küchenbau, was built separate from the palace to its west, to keep odors and possible fires at bay. Inside are seven <a href="hearth">hearth</a>s, a bakery, a butcher's shop, several <a href="pantries">pantries</a>, and the quarters for the servant staff in the attic and on the first floor.

The Bildergalerie (Picture gallery), the southernmost part of the west wing, was built by Frisoni in 1731–32. The only remaining Baroque decor is Scotti's ceiling fresco depicting the life of Achilles, which first adorned the ceiling of the Ahnengalerie. Thouret renovated the Bildergalerie in Tuscan Neoclassicism from 1803 to 1805, adding a fireplace by Isopi and a statue of Apollo opposite it. The frescoes in the Bildergalerie's antechambers were painted in 1730 by either Scotti or Carlo Carlone.

The south wing, the Neuer Hauptbau (New Main building), was designed and constructed by Frisoni on the order of Duke Eberhard Louis, who found that the Alter Hauptbau was too small to serve the needs of his court. Frisoni planned for a four-story building in 1725 but wound up building three stories. Eberhard Louis died before he could move into the Neuer Hauptbau, leaving its interiors unfinished until Duke Charles Eugene finished them in 1747, but abandoned the palace in 1775. The next royals to reside there were Württemberg's first King and Queen, Frederick I and <a href="Charlotte%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Charlotte Mathilde</a>, who extensively remodeled parts of the palace in the Neoclassical style from 1802 to 1824. The building was used in 1944–45 to store furnishings recovered from the recently destroyed <a href="New%20Palace%20%28Stuttgart%29">New Palace</a> in <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>.

The Neuer Hauptbau opens with an oval vestibule decorated by Carlo Carlone. It houses a statue of Duke Eberhard Louis, surrounded by <a href="Term%20%28architecture%29">terms</a> supporting the ceiling. In the <a href="Niche%20%28architecture%29">niches</a> behind the columns are statues of Apollo, a woman and a <a href="sphinx">sphinx</a>, and two <a href="maenad">maenad</a>s with a <a href="satyr">satyr</a>. A <a href="Vault%20%28architecture%29">vaulted</a> passageway decorated with two figures of Hercules leads into a <a href="Drawing%20room">salon</a>, featuring a ceiling fresco by Diego Carlone and statues of <a href="Roman%20deities">Roman deities</a> in niches. The King's and Queen's Staircases bookend the vestible and lead up to the Neuer Hauptbau's "beletage". The King's Staircase has statuary themed after unhappy romances, and the <a href="cavetto">cavetto</a>s above are adorned with stucco depictions of the <a href="seasons">seasons</a> personified and medals bearing Eberhard Louis's initials. The Queen's Staircase is a mirror of the King's, but the statuary depicts virtues and the ribbonwork above displays Apollo, <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a>, and the four classical elements.

Two galleries lead from the stairs to a guardroom decorated by Diego Carlone in 1730 with stucco weapon trophies and fresco. Thouret covered over Carlone's work with Neoclassical ornamentation in 1815. The guardroom leads into the Marble Hall ("Marmorsaal"), the palatial <a href="dining%20hall">dining hall</a> once used to receive <a href="Francis%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Francis II of Austria</a> and <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Russia">Alexander I of Russia</a>. Thouret began work here in 1813–14 by installing a new, curved ceiling and finished two years later with the Marble Hall's scagliola walls. <a href="Pilaster">Pilaster</a>s and windows form the lower wall, decorated with stucco <a href="garland">garland</a>s and <a href="candelabra">candelabra</a>s by Antonio Isopi. Reproductions of the "<a href="Medusa%20Rondanini">Medusa Rondanini</a>", "<a href="Hermes%20Ludovisi">Hermes Ludovisi</a>", and the <a href="Medici%20Vase">Medici Vase</a> are present around the doors. Above the hall is a walkway in the <a href="Attic%20style">attica</a>, divided by pillars clad with <a href="caryatid">caryatid</a>s holding plates and <a href="Pitcher%20%28container%29">pitchers</a> designed by <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20von%20Dannecker">Johann Heinrich von Dannecker</a>. The ceiling fresco, by Pernaux, is of a partly cloudy blue sky that contains an <a href="eagle">eagle</a> and four smaller birds that each hoist a <a href="chandelier">chandelier</a>. The roof above the Marble Hall, though curved, has no visible supports. This was achieved by <a href="cantilever">cantilever</a>ing its weight upon the <a href="entablature">entablature</a>s at the top of the walls of the Marble Hall.

To the east of the Marble Hall is Queen Charlotte's apartment, originally the suites intended to house Prince <a href="Crown%20Prince%20Friedrich%20Ludwig">Frederick Louis</a> and Princess <a href="Henrietta%20Maria%20of%20Brandenburg-Schwedt">Henrietta Maria</a>. When Charlotte joined Frederick I in residence at Ludwigsburg in 1798, the separating walls were removed to form one suite. Thouret only made small changes to the queen's suite from 1802 to 1806, principally adding <a href="damask">damask</a> to the primary antechamber and to the assembly and audience rooms. Extensive renovations, lasting from 1816 to 1824, came after the queen fully established herself at Ludwigsburg. Charlotte's audience chamber contains her throne, red <a href="silk">silk</a> walls, and paintings of <a href="Cybele">Cybele</a>, Minerva, and personified virtues by over the doors and in the <a href="lunette">lunette</a>s of the <a href="mirror">mirror</a>s. The adjacent bedroom was remodeled in 1824 with marbled green pilasters and an <a href="Alcove%20%28architecture%29">alcove</a> containing red silk from 1760. The <a href="Study%20%28room%29">study</a> is unusual for a Neoclassical interior because of its large mirrors. Finally, there is the summer study and the queen's <a href="library">library</a>, remodeled in 1818 with blue damask and Rococo overdoors that carry over into the library to the west. The entire apartment is furnished in the Biedermeier style by Johannes Klinckerfuß, whose work Charlotte herself covered with <a href="embroidery">embroidery</a>.

The king's apartment, to the west of Charlotte's, was to house Duke Eberhard Louis and Wilhelmine von Grävenitz, and later <a href="Johanna%20Elisabeth%20of%20Baden-Durlach">Johanna Elisabeth of Baden-Durlach</a>. Charles Eugene became the first to reside here in 1744 with his wife. When Frederick I took up residence, he had Thouret remodel his 12-room suite from 1802 to 1811. The suite opens with the antechamber, containing decorations dated to 1785, likely taken from <a href="Hohenheim%20Palace">Hohenheim Palace</a>, and an original ceiling fresco by Carlo Carlone of <a href="Bacchus">Bacchus</a> and Venus. Adjacent to it is the audience chamber, decorated with Baroque red damask and Neoclassical borders. The room contains Frederick's throne and furniture by Isopi, embellished with <a href="griffin">griffin</a>s in relief. Past the conference room and its Rococo overdoors by Heideloff are the king's bedchambers. The Baroque wooden wall paneling and overdoors survived the room's 1811 remodeling. The walls and furnishings of the king's office are Neoclassical, decorated with the heads of Greek gods and <a href="cornucopia">cornucopia</a>s, but the ceiling fresco is a Guibal original from 1779 of <a href="Chronos">Chronos</a> and <a href="Clio">Clio</a>.

Duke Charles Eugene moved into the Neuer Hauptbau in 1757 and tasked La Guêpière with the apartment's decoration. Two years later, La Guêpière completed the entire suite except for the bedchamber, as the Duke occupied his wife's former suite in 1760 for his actual residence. The rest of the suite was used for social functions until it was emptied of furnishings in the next decade. A staircase and antechamber lead to the entrance of today's apartment, a gallery decorated by Ludovico Bossi. The initial rooms are the first and second antechambers, clad in green damask with <a href="portraits">portraits</a> by <a href="Antoine%20Pesne">Antoine Pesne</a> and paneling by Michel Fressancourt, overdoors by <a href="Matth%C3%A4us%20G%C3%BCnther">Matthäus Günther</a>, <a href="boiserie">boiserie</a> flooring, and furniture by <a href="Jacques-Philippe%20Carel">Jacques-Philippe Carel</a> and Jean-Baptiste Hédouin that Charles Eugene acquired around 1750. The Assembly Room, restored in 2003, prominently features overdoors by Adolf Friedrich Harper and trophies of musical instruments above the windows. Charles Eugene's third-floor residence begins with the Corner Room, again painted by Harper, which feeds into a cabinet room and then finally the bedchamber, completed in 1770. Bossi created the ceiling's stucco in 1759–60, but the room and its two closets took another decade to complete. Additional rooms on the third floor housed relatives of the rulers of Württemberg and these have been occupied by the Ceramics Museum since 2004.

The gardens were to be centered in the north with an Italian terraced garden and were largely completed when Eberhard Louis turned his attention to the south garden. There he laid out a large symmetrical <a href="French%20formal%20garden">French garden</a>. Charles Eugene filled in the terraces in 1749 to replace them with a large "<a href="Broderie%20%28garden%20feature%29">broderie</a>". He then reorganized and expanded the south garden over the next decade. Frederick I again reorganized the south garden in 1797 in a <a href="Neoclassicism%23Neoclassical%20gardens">Neoclassical style</a> and Mediterranean theme. He retained the original pathways, but added a canal and fountain to the garden's center. The south garden was divided into four equally sized lawns, with <a href="hillocks">hillocks</a> in their center topped with a large vase crafted by Antonio Isopi. Frederick also expanded the garden east to form an <a href="English%20landscape%20garden">English landscape garden</a> (Lower east) and demolished Charles Eugene's <a href="opera%20house">opera house</a> to form a medieval-themed landscape garden (Upper east). Two additional gardens, for Frederick and Charlotte, were laid out adjacent to their palace suites. Also in the fantasy garden is the Emichsburg, a <a href="folly">folly</a> built from 1798 to 1802 and named after the fabled ancestor of the <a href="House%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">House of Württemberg</a>, a knight of the <a href="House%20of%20Hohenstaufen">House of Hohenstaufen</a>. <a href="William%20I%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">William I</a> abandoned Ludwigsburg for <a href="Rosenstein%20Palace">Rosenstein Palace</a> in <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> and opened the south garden to the public in 1828. The canal was filled in and an <a href="orchard">orchard</a> planted on the southern lawns, later used to grow <a href="potatoes">potatoes</a>.

In 1947, , Director of the State Parks and Gardens Authority, was charged with maintaining the gardens. After visiting the 1951 <a href="Bundesgartenschau">Bundesgartenschau</a> in <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a>, he decided to restore the gardens. Schöchle convinced Baden-Württemberg's Minister of Finance to help fund the venture in 1952 on the condition that the town of Ludwigsburg also assisted. Ludwigsburg's mayor, , and the town council agreed to this stipulation. Frank approved the start of work on 23 March 1953, but it lasted late into the year. The restoration of the garden required the moving of of earth by <a href="bulldozer">bulldozer</a>s supplied and operated by American soldiers and the planting of tens of thousands of trees and hedges, 22,000 <a href="roses">roses</a>, and 400,000 other flowers. The Blooming Baroque ("Blühendes Barock") gardens were opened on 23 April 1954 as a special horticultural show and attracted more than 500,000 visitors by the end of May, among them President <a href="Theodor%20Heuss">Theodor Heuss</a>. When the show closed in the fall of 1954, it had recouped all but 150,000 <a href="Deutsche%20Marks">Deutsche Marks</a> of the investment in the restoration of the gardens and became a permanent landmark. The Blooming Baroque gardens, covering an area of , attract 520,000 to 550,000 visitors annually.

On the far east side is the Fairy-Tale Garden ("Märchengarten"), opened in 1959. It is made up of some 40 recreations of <a href="fairy-tales">fairy-tales</a> such as <a href="Rapunzel">Rapunzel</a>, <a href="Sleeping%20Beauty">Sleeping Beauty</a>, and <a href="The%20Frog%20Prince">The Frog Prince</a>. The Fairy-Tale Garden was an immediate success and increased revenue by 50% for that year.

By 1710 Eberhard Louis had decided to use Ludwigsburg as his main residence, but he still desired a hunting retreat. Inspired by <a href="Liechtenstein%20Museum">a garden palace</a> he had seen in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, he tasked Frisoni with the design of a new <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a> palace on a hill to the north of Ludwigsburg. Frisoni largely completed Favorite within that year but was unable to complete his extensive plans for its grounds. Only the roads to the main palace and to <a href="Monrepos%20Palace">Monrepos Palace</a> were laid out. In 1800, the interior was remodeled by Thouret for Frederick I. Only one room, in the western half of the building, retains its original baroque appearance. When Frederick was appointed an <a href="Prince-elector">elector</a> in 1803 and then a king in 1806, he chose both times to celebrate the occasion at Schloss Favorite. Favorite fell into disrepair in the 20th century but was extensively restored from 1972 to 1982.

On the first and third floors of the Alter Hauptbau is the Baroque Gallery ("Barockgalerie"), a subsidiary museum of the <a href="Staatsgalerie%20Stuttgart">Staatsgalerie Stuttgart</a> opened in 2004. It displays 120 paintings, some of which are originals from a purchase Duke <a href="Charles%20Alexander%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Charles Alexander</a> made in 1736 of about 400 paintings from . Examples of German and Italian Baroque paintings on display include <a href="Martin%20van%20Meytens">Martin van Meytens</a>'s portrait of Charles Alexander, works by <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20Sch%C3%B6nfeld">Johann Heinrich Schönfeld</a>, Carl Borromäus Andreas Ruthart, , and Katharina Treu, as well as works that formerly were in the collection of <a href="Cosimo%20III%20de%27%20Medici%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Tuscany">Cosimo III</a>, <a href="Grand%20Duke%20of%20Tuscany">Grand Duke of Tuscany</a>.

The <a href="Landesmuseum%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Landesmuseum Württemberg</a> maintains two subsidiary museums at Ludwigsburg Palace, the Ceramics Museum and Fashion Museum ("Keramikmuseum" and "Modemuseum", respectively), both opened in 2004. The first of these takes up all of the third floor of the Neuer Hauptbau except the apartment of Duke <a href="Charles%20Eugene%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Charles Eugene</a>, a space of containing more than 4,500 exhibits of <a href="porcelain">porcelain</a>, <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a>s, <a href="faience">faience</a> and <a href="pottery">pottery</a>, and of their history, making it one of the largest collections of ceramics in Europe. It includes 2,000 pieces of original <a href="Ludwigsburg%20porcelain">Ludwigsburg porcelain</a> and 800 pieces of <a href="maiolica">maiolica</a>, purchased by Charles Eugene from dealers in <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a> and <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>. It also includes porcelain from the manufactories at <a href="Meissen%20porcelain">Meissen</a>, <a href="Royal%20Porcelain%20Factory%2C%20Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="Manufacture%20nationale%20de%20S%C3%A8vres">Sèvres</a>, and <a href="Vienna%20Porcelain%20Manufactory">Vienna</a>, and 20th century <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> pieces purchased from six countries since 1950. The Fashion Museum, housed in the Festinbau and West Kavalierbau, displays about 700 pieces of clothing and accessories from the 1750s to the 1960s, including works by <a href="Charles%20Frederick%20Worth">Charles Frederick Worth</a>, <a href="Paul%20Poiret">Paul Poiret</a>, <a href="Christian%20Dior">Christian Dior</a>, and <a href="Issey%20Miyake">Issey Miyake</a>.

On the ground floor of the Neuer Hauptbau is a <a href="lapidarium">lapidarium</a>, housing original Baroque statuary by Andreas Quittainer, <a href="Johann%20Wilhelm%20Beyer">Johann Wilhelm Beyer</a> and Pierre François Lejeune. Charles Eugene's apartment houses the <a href="Duchess%20Olga%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Princess Olga</a> Cabinet Exhibition, exploring the lives of Princess Olga and her family at Ludwigsburg from 1901 to 1932.

"Kinderreich" (Children's Kingdom) is an interactive museum that educates children four years and older about life at the court of the <a href="Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Duke of Württemberg</a>. In the Palace Theatre, about 140 original set pieces and props from the 18th and 19th centuries are preserved that were discovered during restoration of the theatre, such as oil lamps used for stage lighting. These items were extensively restored to their original condition from 1987 to 1995, and since 1995 one of the original stage pieces, a winter background, has been used for the "Junge Bühne" (Young stage).

Unknown (magazine)

Unknown (also known as Unknown Worlds) was an American <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp</a> <a href="fantasy%20fiction%20magazine">fantasy fiction magazine</a>, published from 1939 to 1943 by <a href="Street%20%26amp%3B%20Smith">Street & Smith</a>, and edited by <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John W. Campbell</a>. "Unknown" was a companion to Street & Smith's science fiction pulp, "<a href="Analog%20Science%20Fiction%20and%20Fact">Astounding Science Fiction</a>", which was also edited by Campbell at the time; many authors and illustrators contributed to both magazines. The leading fantasy magazine in the 1930s was "<a href="Weird%20Tales">Weird Tales</a>", which focused on shock and horror. Campbell wanted to publish a fantasy magazine with more finesse and humor than "Weird Tales", and put his plans into action when <a href="Eric%20Frank%20Russell">Eric Frank Russell</a> sent him the manuscript of his novel "Sinister Barrier", about aliens who own the human race. "Unknown"s first issue appeared in March 1939; in addition to "Sinister Barrier", it included <a href="H.%20L.%20Gold">H. L. Gold</a>'s "Trouble With Water", a humorous fantasy about a New Yorker who meets a water gnome. Gold's story was the first of many in "Unknown" to combine commonplace reality with the fantastic.

Campbell required his authors to avoid simplistic horror fiction and insisted that the fantasy elements in a story be developed logically: for example, Jack Williamson's "<a href="Darker%20Than%20You%20Think">Darker Than You Think</a>" describes a world in which there is a scientific explanation for the existence of <a href="werewolf">werewolves</a>. Similarly, <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a> and <a href="Fletcher%20Pratt">Fletcher Pratt</a>'s <a href="Harold%20Shea">Harold Shea</a> series, about a modern American who finds himself in the worlds of various mythologies, depicts a system of magic based on mathematical logic. Other notable stories included several well-received novels by <a href="L.%20Ron%20Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a> and short stories such as <a href="Manly%20Wade%20Wellman">Manly Wade Wellman</a>'s "When It Was Moonlight" and <a href="Fritz%20Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a>'s "Two Sought Adventure", the first in his <a href="Fafhrd%20and%20the%20Gray%20Mouser">Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser</a> series.

"Unknown" was forced to a bimonthly schedule in 1941 by poor sales, and cancelled in 1943 when wartime paper shortages became so acute that Campbell had to choose between turning "Astounding" into a bimonthly or ending "Unknown". The magazine is generally regarded as the finest fantasy fiction magazine ever published, despite the fact that it was not commercially successful, and in the opinion of science fiction historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a> it was responsible for the creation of the modern fantasy publishing genre.

In May 1923, the first issue of "<a href="Weird%20Tales">Weird Tales</a>" appeared, from Rural Publications in Chicago. "Weird Tales" was a pulp magazine that specialized in fantasy stories and material that no other magazine would accept. It was not initially successful, but by the 1930s had established itself and was regularly publishing science fiction (sf) as well as fantasy. "Weird Tales" was the first magazine to focus solely on fantasy, and it remained the pre-eminent magazine in this field for over a decade. In the meantime, science fiction was starting to form a separately marketed genre, with the appearance in 1926 of "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", a pulp magazine edited by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>. In 1930 pulp publisher Clayton Publications launched "<a href="Analog%20Science%20Fiction%20and%20Fact">Astounding Stories of Super Science</a>", but the company's bankruptcy in 1933 led to the acquisition of the magazine by <a href="Street%20%26amp%3B%20Smith">Street & Smith</a>. The title was shortened to "Astounding Stories", and it became the leading magazine in the science fiction field over the next few years under the editorship of <a href="F.%20Orlin%20Tremaine">F. Orlin Tremaine</a>. At the end of 1937 <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John W. Campbell</a> took over as editor.

By 1938, Campbell was planning a fantasy companion to "Astounding": "Weird Tales" was still the leader in the fantasy genre, though competitors such as "<a href="Strange%20Stories">Strange Stories</a>" were also being launched. Campbell began acquiring stories suitable for the new magazine, without a definite launch date in mind. When <a href="Eric%20Frank%20Russell">Eric Frank Russell</a> sent him the manuscript of his novel "Sinister Barrier", Campbell decided it was time to put his plans into action. The first issue of "Unknown" appeared in March 1939. It was a monthly at first, but poor sales forced a switch to a bimonthly schedule beginning in February 1941. In December 1940 the subtitle "Fantasy Fiction" was added, and in October 1941 the main title was changed to "Unknown Worlds"; both changes were intended to make the genre of the magazine clearer to potential readers. When wartime paper shortages became severe in late 1943, Campbell made the choice to keep "Astounding" monthly and cancel "Unknown", rather than switch the former to a bimonthly schedule as well. The last issue was dated October 1943.

Campbell's plans for "Unknown" were laid out in the February 1939 issue of "Astounding", in the announcement of the new magazine. He argued that "it has been the quality of the fantasy that you have read in the past that has made the very word anathema ... ["Unknown"] will offer fantasy of a quality so far different from that which has appeared in the past as to change your entire understanding of the term". The first issue, the following month, led with Russell's "Sinister Barrier", the novel that had persuaded Campbell to set his plans for a fantasy magazine into motion: the plot, involving aliens who own the human race, has been described by sf historian Mike Ashley as "a strange mixture of science fiction and occult fantasy". Campbell asked Russell for revisions to the story to emphasize the fantastic elements, but still demanded that Russell work out the logical implications of his premises. This became a defining characteristic of the fiction published in "Unknown"; in Ashley's words, Campbell "brought the science fiction rationale to fantasy". The first issue also contained <a href="Horace%20L.%20Gold">Horace L. Gold</a>'s "Trouble with Water", a comic fantasy about a modern New Yorker who offends a water gnome; in its whimsicality and naturalistic merging of a modern background with a classic fantasy trope, "Trouble with Water" was a better indication than "Sinister Barrier" of the direction "Unknown" would take. Campbell commented in a letter at the time that "Sinister Barrier", "Trouble with Water", and Where Angels Fear ... by <a href="Manly%20Wade%20Wellman">Manly Wade Wellman</a> were the only stories in the first issue that accurately reflected his goals for the magazine.

Under Campbell's editorial supervision, the fantasy element in "Unknown" stories had to be treated rigorously. This naturally led to the appearance in "Unknown" of writers already comfortable with similar rigor in science fiction stories, and Campbell soon established a small group of writers as regular contributors, many of whom were also appearing in the pages of "Astounding". <a href="L.%20Ron%20Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a>, <a href="Theodore%20Sturgeon">Theodore Sturgeon</a>, and <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a> were among the most prolific. Hubbard contributed eight lead novels including "<a href="Typewriter%20in%20the%20Sky">Typewriter in the Sky</a>", "<a href="Slaves%20of%20Sleep">Slaves of Sleep</a>", and "<a href="Fear%20%28Hubbard%20novella%29">Fear</a>", described by Ashley as a "classic psychological thriller"; sf historian and critic Thomas Clareson describes all eight as "outstanding". De Camp, in collaboration with <a href="Fletcher%20Pratt">Fletcher Pratt</a>, contributed three stories featuring <a href="Harold%20Shea">Harold Shea</a>, who finds himself in a world where magic operates by rigorous rules. The title of one of these, "The Mathematics of Magic", is, according to sf critic <a href="John%20Clute">John Clute</a>, "perfectly expressive of the terms under which magic found easy mention in "Unknown"".

Other "Astounding" writers who wrote for "Unknown" included <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>, whose "The Devil Makes the Law" (reprinted as "<a href="Magic%2C%20Inc.">Magic, Inc.</a>") depicts a world where magic is a part of normal everyday life. Heinlein also contributed "<a href="The%20Unpleasant%20Profession%20of%20Jonathan%20Hoag">The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag</a>" and "<a href="They%20%28Heinlein%29">They</a>", described by Ashley as "perhaps the ultimate solipsist fantasy". <a href="A.E.%20van%20Vogt">A.E. van Vogt</a>, a frequent "Astounding" contributor, appeared in the final issue with "The Book of Ptath" (later expanded into a novel). <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, despite multiple attempts to write for "Unknown", never appeared in the magazine. On his sixth attempt, he sold "<a href="Author%21%20Author%21%20%28short%20story%29">Author! Author!</a>" to Campbell, but the magazine was cancelled before it could appear. It eventually appeared in the anthology "<a href="The%20Unknown%20Five">The Unknown Five</a>".

In addition to the overlap between the writers of "Unknown" and "Astounding", there was a good deal of overlap between their readerships: Asimov records that during the war, he read only these two magazines. Sf historian Paul Carter has argued that the spectrum of fantastic fiction from "Weird Tales" through "Unknown" to "Astounding" was far less cleanly separated than is sometimes assumed: many stories in the early science fiction magazines such as "Wonder Stories" were more like the works of <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> than they were tales of scientific imagination.

<a href="Fritz%20Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a>'s first published story was "Two Sought Adventure", which appeared in the August 1939 issue of "Unknown"; this was the first story in his long-running <a href="Fafhrd%20and%20the%20Gray%20Mouser">Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser</a> series about a pair of adventurers in a <a href="sword%20and%20sorcery">sword and sorcery</a> setting. Four more Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories appeared in "Unknown" in as many years, and Leiber's novel "<a href="Conjure%20Wife">Conjure Wife</a>", about a man who discovers that all women are secretly witches, was the lead story in the April 1943 issue. The protagonist, a university professor, "is forced to abandon scepticism and discover the underlying equations of magic, via symbolic logic", in critic David Langford's description. Leiber also contributed "Smoke Ghost" in October 1941, described by Ashley as "arguably the first seriously modern ghost story". Another writer whose first story appeared in "Unknown" was <a href="James%20H.%20Schmitz">James H. Schmitz</a>, whose "Greenface" appeared in the August 1943 issue.

Other notable stories that appeared in "Unknown" include Jack Williamson's "Darker Than You Think" (December 1940), which provides a scientific basis for a race of werewolves living undetected alongside human beings. Expanded into a novel in 1948, it remains Williamson's best-known fantasy, and sf historian <a href="Malcolm%20Edwards">Malcolm Edwards</a> comments that the two protagonists' relationship is "depicted with a tortured (and still haunting) erotic frankness unusual in genre literature of the 1940s". In addition to the Harold Shea pieces, de Camp published several other well-received stories, including "The Wheels of If" (October 1940) and "<a href="Lest%20Darkness%20Fall">Lest Darkness Fall</a>" (December 1939), an <a href="alternate%20history">alternate history</a> story about a time-traveler who attempts to save the Roman Empire from the coming Dark Ages; Edwards and Clute comment that the story is "the most accomplished early excursion into history in magazine sf, and is regarded as a classic". Also highly regarded is Wellman's "When It Was Moonlight" (December 1940), a story about Poe.

The first sixteen issues of "Unknown" had cover paintings, but from July 1940 the cover style was changed to a table of contents, with a small ink drawing usually accompanying the summary of each story, in an attempt to make the magazine appear more dignified. The cover art came almost entirely from artists who did not contribute to many science fiction or fantasy magazines: six of the sixteen paintings were by <a href="Harold%20Winfield%20Scott">H. W. Scott</a>; Manuel Islip, <a href="Modest%20Stein">Modest Stein</a>, <a href="Graves%20Gladney">Graves Gladney</a>, and <a href="Edd%20Cartier">Edd Cartier</a> provided the others. Cartier was the only one of these who regularly contributed to sf and fantasy periodicals; he painted four of "Unknown"s last six covers before the change to a text-heavy design.

"Unknown" was, along with "<a href="Weird%20Tales">Weird Tales</a>", an important early influence on the fantasy genre. In the foreword to "From Unknown Worlds", in 1948, Campbell commented that fantasy before "Unknown" had been too much infused with "gloom and terror"; his approach in "Unknown" had been to assume that the "creatures of mythology and folklore" could be characters in an amusing tale as easily as they could be made part of a horror story. Horror stories, he said, had a place, but "horror injected with a sharp and poisoned needle is just as effective as when applied with the blunt-instrument technique of the so-called Gothic horror tale". Campbell insisted on the same rational approach to fantasy that he required of his science fiction writers, and in the words of Clareson, this led to the destruction of "not only the prevalent narrative tone but also most of the trappings that had dominated fantasy from "<a href="The%20Castle%20of%20Otranto">The Castle of Otranto</a>" and "<a href="The%20Monk">The Monk</a>" through the nineteenth century to "Weird Tales"". "Unknown" quickly separated itself from "Weird Tales", whose fantasies still primarily aimed to produce fear or shock. The closest predecessor to "Unknown" was <a href="Thorne%20Smith">Thorne Smith</a>, whose <a href="prohibition-era%20%28US%29">prohibition-era</a> "Topper" stories also mixed fantasy with humor. Before "Unknown", fantasy had received little serious attention, though on occasion writers such as <a href="James%20Branch%20Cabell">James Branch Cabell</a> had achieved respectability. In Ashley's opinion, "Unknown" created the modern genre of fantasy, though commercial success for the genre had to wait until the 1970s.

Clareson also suggests that "Unknown" influenced the science fiction that appeared in "Astounding" after "Unknown" folded. According to this view, stories such as <a href="Clifford%20Simak">Clifford Simak</a>'s "<a href="City%20%28novel%29">City</a>" series would not have appeared without the destruction of genre boundaries that Campbell oversaw. Clareson further proposes that "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction">Galaxy Science Fiction</a>" and "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction</a>", two of the most important and successful science fiction and fantasy magazines, were direct descendants of "Unknown".

"Unknown" is widely regarded as the finest fantasy magazine ever published: Ashley says, for example, that ""Unknown" published without doubt the greatest collection of fantasy stories produced in one magazine." Despite its lack of commercial success, "Unknown" is the most lamented of all science fiction and fantasy magazines; <a href="Lester%20del%20Rey">Lester del Rey</a> describes it as having gained "a devotion from its readers that no other magazine can match". Edwards comments that "Unknown" "appeared during Campbell's peak years as an editor; its reputation may stand as high as it does partly because it died while still at its best".

In a conversation with <a href="David%20G.%20Hartwell">David G. Hartwell</a> in 1962, <a href="Shirley%20Jackson">Shirley Jackson</a> stated she owned a complete run
of "Unknown" and expressed strong admiration for the publication, stating "It's the best".

"Unknown" was edited by John W. Campbell and published by Street & Smith Publications throughout its run. It was pulp-sized from its launch through August 1941, and then <a href="bedsheet">bedsheet</a>-sized from October 1941 to April 1943. The last three issues were pulp-sized again. Street & Smith had planned to switch it to <a href="digest%20size">digest size</a> with the December 1943 issue, but it was cancelled before that issue appeared. The price began at 20 cents and rose to 25 cents with the change to bedsheet size; it remained at 25 cents when the size changed back to pulp. It had 164 pages when pulp-sized and 130 pages while it was bedsheet-sized. It began as a monthly and switched to bimonthly from December 1940 on. The volume numbering was regular, with six volumes of six numbers and a final volume of three numbers. The title began as simply "Unknown". In December 1940 ""Fantasy Fiction"" was added as a subtitle, and from the October 1941 issue the title became "Unknown Worlds".

The first six U.S. issues were available directly in the UK, but thereafter an abridged British reprint edition was issued by Atlas Publications, beginning in September 1939. It was pulp-sized, and priced at 9d (nine <a href="Coins%20of%20the%20pound%20sterling%23Pre-decimal%20coinage">pence</a>) throughout. It appeared on a regular monthly schedule until December 1940, after which the schedule became quite irregular, with two or three issues appearing each year until 1949. The volume numbering initially followed the corresponding U.S. editions, with some omitted numbers in 1942 and 1943, and then disappeared for four issues; from the twenty-eighth issue (Spring 1945) the magazine was numbered as if it had been given volumes of twelve numbers since the start of the run. The title was changed from "Unknown" to "Unknown Worlds" with the March 1942 issue.

In 1948, Street & Smith reprinted several stories from "Unknown" in a bedsheet-sized magazine format, priced at 25 cents, with the title "<a href="From%20Unknown%20Worlds">From Unknown Worlds</a>". This was an attempt to determine if there was a market for a revived "Unknown". Street & Smith printed 300,000 copies, against the advice of John Campbell, but although it sold better than the original, too many copies were returned for the publisher to be willing to revive the magazine. The issue was reprinted in Britain in 1952, reduced in size to and cut from 130 pages to 124; it was priced at 2/6 (two <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s and six pence). Part of the run was issued in a hardcover binding at a higher price. One story from the U.S. version was omitted: "One Man's Harp" by <a href="Babette%20Rosmond">Babette Rosmond</a>.

Three anthologies of stories from "Unknown" were published in the early 1960s. "<a href="The%20Unknown%20Five">The Unknown Five</a>" includes four stories reprinted from "Unknown" and the first print appearance of "<a href="Author%21%20Author%21%20%28short%20story%29">Author! Author!</a>", by Isaac Asimov, which was sold to "Unknown" shortly before Street & Smith shut it down. Two additional "Unknown" anthologies were published in the late 1980s.

He won his Olympic gold medal during the <a href="2002%20Winter%20Olympics">2002 Winter Olympics</a>. For this accomplishment, he was inducted into the <a href="BC%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">BC Sports Hall of Fame</a> with his British Columbian <a href="List%20of%20Canadian%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team%20rosters%232002%20Winter%20Olympics">teammates</a> in 2003.

Brewer was born on April 17, 1979, in <a href="Vernon%2C%20British%20Columbia">Vernon</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, to Anna and Frank Brewer. He was raised in <a href="Ashcroft%2C%20British%20Columbia">Ashcroft</a>, British Columbia, and began playing ice hockey in the Ashcroft Minor Hockey program. When he was fourteen, his family moved to <a href="Kamloops">Kamloops</a>, British Columbia, where he attended junior and senior <a href="High%20school%23Canada">high school</a>. Brewer excelled with the Kamloops <a href="Minor%20hockey">Bantam</a> AAA Jardine Blazers of the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Amateur%20Hockey%20Association">British Columbia Amateur Hockey Association</a> (BCAHA). In 1995, Brewer was exposed to BCAHA Best Ever, a program designed to find and develop players and coaches for play in international competition. As a young hockey player, Brewer looked up to NHL stars <a href="Scott%20Niedermayer">Scott Niedermayer</a> and <a href="Jeremy%20Roenick">Jeremy Roenick</a> as role models.

In mid-2004, Brewer married Rebecca Flann, whom he met while playing junior hockey with the <a href="Prince%20George%20Cougars">Prince George Cougars</a>; they live in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, British Columbia. Brewer's sister, Kristi, played for the <a href="UBC%20Thunderbirds">University of British Columbia Thunderbirds</a> women's ice hockey team. Eric and Rebecca have two daughters.

Brewer is involved in numerous <a href="charitable%20organization">charitable organization</a>s. During the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20NHL%20lockout">2004–05 NHL lockout</a>, Brewer participated in several charity hockey games, playing in the four-game <a href="Ryan%20Smyth">Ryan Smyth</a> and Friends All-Star Charity Tour, the three-game <a href="Brad%20May">Brad May</a> and Friends Hockey Challenge, as well as the Our Game to Give charity hockey game held at <a href="Ivor%20Wynne%20Stadium">Ivor Wynne Stadium</a> in <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Ontario">Hamilton</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>. During <a href="Close%20season">off-season</a>s, Brewer has participated in numerous charity <a href="golf">golf</a> tournaments, including the Burn Fund Golf Tournament in <a href="Prince%20George%2C%20British%20Columbia">Prince George</a> and the <a href="Mark%20Recchi">Recchi</a>-<a href="Shane%20Doan">Doan</a> Charity Classic in Kamloops.

Brewer was drafted in the sixth round, 81st overall, by the <a href="Prince%20George%20Cougars">Prince George Cougars</a> in the <a href="WHL%20Bantam%20Draft">1994 WHL Bantam Draft</a>. After being drafted, he played one final season with the Jardine Blazers, recording 38 points in only forty games. The following year, Brewer began his WHL career with the Cougars, playing 63 games in the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20WHL%20season">1995–96 season</a>. Brewer finished his rookie WHL season with fourteen points, including four goals, and was named Cougars' Rookie of the Year.

In his <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20WHL%20season">sophomore season</a>, Brewer became a leader on the Cougars' <a href="Hockey%20rink%23Lines">blue line</a>. He was named to play for Team <a href="Bobby%20Orr">Orr</a> in the <a href="CHL%20Top%20Prospects%20Game">1997 CHL Top Prospects Game</a> in February 1997 at <a href="Maple%20Leaf%20Gardens">Maple Leaf Gardens</a>. He doubled his point total from the previous season, finishing with 29 points in 71 games played. Brewer followed his regular season by helping the Cougars go on a <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20WHL%20season%23WHL%20Playoffs">playoff</a> run. After clinching the last spot in the West Division with a losing record, the Cougars defeated the number-one seed <a href="Portland%20Winter%20Hawks">Portland Winter Hawks</a> in the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20WHL%20season%23Western%20Conference">conference quarterfinals</a> and the third-ranked <a href="Spokane%20Chiefs">Spokane Chiefs</a> in the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20WHL%20season%23Conference%20semifinals">conference semifinals</a> before finally losing to the second-ranked <a href="Seattle%20Thunderbirds">Seattle Thunderbirds</a> in the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20WHL%20season%23Conference%20finals">Western Conference final</a>. Brewer finished this run with six points in the Cougars' fifteen games.

Brewer's <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20WHL%20season">final season</a> with Prince George was his best, statistically, in the WHL. After representing Canada at the <a href="1998%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1998 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships</a>, he was named to the Western Conference team for the WHL All-Star Game in <a href="Regina%2C%20Saskatchewan">Regina</a>, <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, which he missed, as well as much of the season, due to injury. However, Brewer finished the year with 33 points in only 34 games, a near one point-per-game average, and was named to the WHL West Second All-Star Team. Brewer was the highest ranked defenceman at sixth overall among North American skaters heading into the <a href="1997%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1997 NHL Entry Draft</a>. He was drafted fifth overall by the <a href="New%20York%20Islanders">New York Islanders</a> in June 1997.

Just over a year after being drafted, Brewer signed his first professional contract with his draft team, the New York Islanders, in August 1998. Entering the NHL, Brewer was regarded as a future <a href="James%20Norris%20Memorial%20Trophy">Norris Trophy</a> candidate, and as a result, his contract was an entry level three-year, $2.775-million deal complemented by a $1-million signing bonus, the highest base salary available for a rookie. Brewer made his NHL debut on October 10, 1998, against the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a>, and on November 5, Brewer scored his first career goal against the <a href="Carolina%20Hurricanes">Carolina Hurricanes</a>' <a href="Trevor%20Kidd">Trevor Kidd</a>. Throughout his rookie season, Brewer was considered an integral part of the Islanders' defence, and, along with <a href="Zdeno%20Ch%C3%A1ra">Zdeno Chára</a>, <a href="Kenny%20J%C3%B6nsson">Kenny Jönsson</a> and <a href="Roberto%20Luongo">Roberto Luongo</a>, was considered untouchable by management at the <a href="NHL%20trade%20deadline%231998%E2%80%9399%20NHL%20season">1999 NHL trade deadline</a>. Brewer finished his rookie season with eleven points in 63 games.

After playing just three games of the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20NHL%20season">1999–2000 NHL season</a>, Brewer was assigned to the Islanders' AHL affiliate, the <a href="Lowell%20Lock%20Monsters">Lowell Lock Monsters</a>. It was speculated that the reason behind this move was laziness by Brewer, who was benched during the final thirty minutes by head coach <a href="Butch%20Goring">Butch Goring</a> after losing a race for the puck against <a href="Mike%20Knuble">Mike Knuble</a> in the Islanders' October 11, 1999, loss to the <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a>. Brewer also took a bad penalty earlier in the game, putting the Islanders down two men. After a two-week, five-game stint with the Lock Monsters, Brewer was subsequently recalled by the Islanders. After playing 26 games with the Islanders in which he only recorded two assists, Brewer was reassigned to the Lock Monsters on January 8, 2000, for the remainder of the season. Shortly after joining the Lock Monsters, Brewer suffered a sprained knee and missed the next two-and-a-half months of the season. Brewer went on to play 25 games for the Lock Monsters, recording two goals and two assists. He also participated in his first professional playoffs, as the Lock Monsters swept the <a href="Saint%20John%20Flames">Saint John Flames</a> in three games in the first round, before being swept themselves in four games in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the <a href="Providence%20Bruins">Providence Bruins</a>.

At the <a href="2000%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2000 NHL Entry Draft</a>, the <a href="New%20York%20Islanders">Islanders</a> traded Brewer, <a href="Josh%20Green%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Josh Green</a> and their second round selection (<a href="Brad%20Winchester">Brad Winchester</a>) in the same draft to the <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a> for <a href="Roman%20Hamrl%C3%ADk">Roman Hamrlík</a>. Although surprised to be traded, Brewer was excited at the prospect of playing for the Oilers, who saw Brewer as a top-four defenceman. However, Brewer's Oiler career began on a sour note as he suffered a bruised left <a href="Hip%20%28anatomy%29">hip</a> and <a href="Coccyx">tailbone</a> in his first game with the team. Brewer missed the next four games before returning to the lineup. Brewer scored his first goal as an Oiler on November 7, 2000, against the New York Rangers. Brewer finished his first Oiler season with career highs in goals, assists and points, as well as the best <a href="Plus-minus%20%28ice%20hockey%29">plus/minus</a> rating on the Oilers team, a plus-15. Further, Brewer gained his first NHL playoff experience, a <a href="2001%20Stanley%20Cup%20Playoffs%23Dallas%20Stars%20v.%20Edmonton%20Oilers">quarterfinal series</a> versus the <a href="Dallas%20Stars">Dallas Stars</a>. Brewer had six points, but the Oilers were eliminated four games to two by the Stars.

The Oilers re-signed Brewer, who was a free agent, to a one-year, $907,500 contract in August 2001. In his <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20NHL%20season">second season</a> with the Oilers, Brewer was assigned to play against the opposing teams' best offensive players by Oilers head coach <a href="Craig%20MacTavish">Craig MacTavish</a>. Brewer began to play more minutes in games, typically placing among the NHL leaders in average minutes played per game. With this enhanced role on the team, Brewer finished his season with new career highs in assists and points for the second consecutive season, and matched his career high in goals. Although his single year contract expired, his role on the Oilers had become more important and Brewer expected a large raise for his <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20NHL%20season">third season</a> with the Oilers.

After a long holdout that lasted until the beginning of Oilers training camp, Brewer finally signed a two-year, $4-million contract in September 2002. At the half of the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20NHL%20season">2002–03 NHL season</a>, Brewer was named to play in his first <a href="National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">NHL All-Star Game</a>, dressing for the <a href="Western%20Conference%20%28NHL%29">Western Conference</a> in the <a href="53rd%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">fifty-third edition</a> of the game. He finished with career highs for assists and points and set a career high for goals for the third consecutive season. He appeared in his second NHL playoffs, another <a href="2003%20Stanley%20Cup%20Playoffs%23%281%29%20Dallas%20Stars%20vs.%20%288%29%20Edmonton%20Oilers">quarterfinal series</a> against the Dallas Stars in which the Oilers were once again eliminated four games to two. Brewer finished the playoffs with four points in the Oilers' six games.

In his <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20NHL%20season">fourth season</a> with the Oilers, Brewer continued his role as a top defenceman. On November 22, 2003, Brewer was among the participants in the historic <a href="2003%20Heritage%20Classic">2003 Heritage Classic</a> ice hockey game versus the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a> at <a href="Commonwealth%20Stadium%20%28Edmonton%29">Commonwealth Stadium</a> in <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>. Brewer scored the Oilers first goal of the game in a 4–3 loss in front of a then record crowd of 57,167. Later in the season, in a game on January 29, 2004, versus the <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a>, Brewer recorded his one-hundredth career point. Since his team depended on Brewer to play against the opposing teams' best offensive players, he finished the season with an average time on ice of 24:39, ranking fourteenth in the league. In the final year of his two-year contract, Brewer finished the season with his point totals matching those from his <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20NHL%20season">2001–02 NHL season</a>, a slight fall from his career highs set in his third season with the Oilers.

With the Oilers unwilling to pay what he was expecting, Brewer decided to go to salary <a href="arbitration">arbitration</a> to get a new contract. However, on August 4, 2004, Brewer signed a one-year, $2.65 million contract with the Oilers, avoiding his arbitration hearing set for only a few days later. Brewer was unable to play out his new contract due to the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20NHL%20lockout">2004–05 NHL lockout</a>.

In August 2005, following the lockout, the Oilers traded Brewer, <a href="Jeff%20Woywitka">Jeff Woywitka</a> and <a href="Doug%20Lynch%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Doug Lynch</a> to the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a> in exchange for defenceman <a href="Chris%20Pronger">Chris Pronger</a>. At the time of the trade, Brewer was a restricted free agent, so on August 15, 2005, Brewer accepted the Blues' qualifying offer, signing a one-year, $2-million contract. Brewer's <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20NHL%20season">first season</a> with the Blues was a particularly poor one. After playing the first 18 games of the season, Brewer separated his <a href="shoulder">shoulder</a> on November 16, 2005, in a 2–0 victory over the <a href="Columbus%20Blue%20Jackets">Columbus Blue Jackets</a>. Brewer missed ten games before being activated from the <a href="injured%20reserve%20list">injured reserve list</a>, returning to the St. Louis line-up for a game on December 17, 2005, against the <a href="Philadelphia%20Flyers">Philadelphia Flyers</a>. Less than a month later, in a game on January 13, 2006, against the <a href="Atlanta%20Thrashers">Atlanta Thrashers</a>, Brewer collided with the Thrashers' <a href="Centre%20%28ice%20hockey%29">centre</a> <a href="Karl%20Stewart">Karl Stewart</a>, and <a href="Joint%20dislocation">dislocated</a> his left shoulder, which ended his season. In just 32 games, Brewer finished his season with nine points, including six goals, two shy of his career best of eight set in the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20NHL%20season">2002–04 season</a>. Despite his limited play, the Blues re-signed Brewer to a one-year, $2.014 million contract for the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20NHL%20season">2006–07 season</a>.

Brewer's <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20NHL%20season">second season</a> with the Blues began as a disappointment. By the first half of December 2006, Brewer had only amassed six points and a <a href="Plus-minus%20%28ice%20hockey%29">plus-minus</a> rating of –11, often referred to as "the worst player on the ice" by both the media and Blues fans alike. Brewer was often involved in trade rumours, as he was set to become an unrestricted free agent following the completion of the season. Brewer believed his performance was the result of having only played in 32 NHL games since the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20NHL%20season">2003–04 season</a>. However, after the firing of head coach <a href="Mike%20Kitchen">Mike Kitchen</a> on December 11, 2006, Brewer began playing much better under new head coach, <a href="Andy%20Murray%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Andy Murray</a>. Over the next nineteen games, Brewer changed his –11 into a +2 and became an integral part of the Blues' defence. His turnaround was rewarded on February 24, 2007, when, rather than being traded as was previously rumoured, Brewer signed a four-year, $17-million contract extension with the Blues. Brewer continued his turnaround through the end of the season, finishing the year with six goals and 23 assists for 29 points, tying his career high for points set in the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20NHL%20season">2002–03 season</a> and setting a new career high for assists.

In his <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20NHL%20season">third season</a> with the Blues, Brewer continued to do well under Andy Murray. Brewer evolved into one of the top two-way defencemen in the NHL, with comparisons being made between him and former first overall draft pick <a href="Chris%20Phillips">Chris Phillips</a> of the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators">Ottawa Senators</a>. His play and leadership abilities were recognized, when on February 8, 2008, Brewer was named as the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues%23Team%20captains">nineteenth</a> <a href="Captain%20%28ice%20hockey%29">captain</a> in the history of the St. Louis Blues, filling the vacancy created when former Blues captain <a href="Dallas%20Drake">Dallas Drake</a> had his contract <a href="Buyout">bought out</a> following the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20NHL%20season">2006–07 season</a>. On February 17, 2008, in a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets, Brewer set a career high for points in a game with four, all assists, eclipsing his previous career high of three points set on January 16, 2007. Brewer finished the season with only one goal in his 77 games played, his lowest goal total since the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20NHL%20season">1999–2000 season</a>, although he added 21 assists, three short of a career high. At the completion of the season, Brewer underwent <a href="reconstructive%20surgery">reconstructive surgery</a> on his right shoulder to repair damage suffered in a <a href="Fighting%20in%20ice%20hockey">fight</a> in the Blues' season opening game against the Phoenix Coyotes on October 4, 2007.

On February 18, 2011, Brewer was traded to the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Lightning">Tampa Bay Lightning</a> for <a href="Brock%20Beukeboom">Brock Beukeboom</a> and Tampa Bay's third-round selection in the <a href="2011%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2011 NHL Entry Draft</a>. In 22 games with Tampa Bay, he notched a goal and an assist. He also led the Lightning in average ice time per game, with 21:34. At the end of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20NHL%20season">2010–11 season</a>, Brewer recorded a career-high nine goals and also amassed 81 penalty minutes, good for the second-highest total of his NHL career. He also appeared in a career-high 18 post-season contests with the Lightning in the <a href="2011%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">2011 playoffs</a>, registering three goals and 17 points, helping the Bolts in their first playoff appearance in four seasons. During the 2011 playoffs, he set a career-high with three points in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Quarter-finals against the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> and ranked third among all post-season skaters with 51 blocked shots. On June 24, 2011, Brewer signed a four-year, $15.4 million contract extension with the Lightning.

On November 28, 2014, while in the final year of his contract with the Lightning, Brewer was traded to the <a href="Anaheim%20Ducks">Anaheim Ducks</a> in exchange for a third-round pick in the <a href="2015%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2015 NHL Entry Draft</a>. At the time, Brewer had appeared in 17 games with the Lightning during the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20NHL%20season">2014–15 NHL season</a> and had four assists on the year. He finished his career with the Lightning having played in 246 games and scored ten goals and 46 assists. The next night, Brewer played in his first game with the Ducks, recording 15:07 in ice time in a 6–4 loss to the <a href="San%20Jose%20Sharks">San Jose Sharks</a>. On December 3, 2014, after playing in only two games for the Ducks, the team announced that Brewer was expected to miss four-to-six weeks after breaking a bone in his foot from a blocked shot. Brewer returned to the Ducks lineup two months later on February 3, 2015 against the <a href="Carolina%20Hurricanes">Carolina Hurricanes</a> and scored his first goal for Anaheim on February 8, 2015 against his former teammates in a 5–3 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning.

On March 2, 2015, the 2015 NHL trade deadline, the Ducks traded Brewer and a fifth-round pick in the <a href="2016%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2016 NHL Entry Draft</a> to the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> in exchange for defenceman <a href="Korbinian%20Holzer">Korbinian Holzer</a>, ending a brief nine game career with the Anaheim Ducks. Brewer's first game as a member of the Maple Leafs came on March 5, 2015 against the Tampa Bay Lighting. On March 21, 2015, Brewer became the 300th NHL player to play in <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%201%2C000%20games%20played">1,000 career games</a> in a 5–3 loss to the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators">Ottawa Senators</a>. Two days later, the Maple Leafs honored Brewer's achievement with a ceremony prior to their game against the <a href="Minnesota%20Wild">Minnesota Wild</a>, at which they presented him with a silver stick, and <a href="Rolex">Rolex</a> watch, and a $10,000 charitable donation in his name. He scored his first goal with the club two games later, the game-winning <a href="Overtime%20%28ice%20hockey%29">overtime</a> goal in a 4–3 victory over the Ottawa Senators on March 28, 2015. After missing the playoffs with the Maple Leafs, Brewer finished the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20NHL%20season">2014–15 NHL season</a> with two goals and three assists in eighteen games with the Maple Leafs. Through his entire <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20NHL%20season">2014–15 NHL season</a> with the Lighting, Ducks, and Maple Leafs, Brewer scored three goals and eight assists in 44 games played, the fewest games played of his career since his injury-plagued <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20NHL%20season">2008–09 NHL season</a> with the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a>.

Ahead of the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20NHL%20season">2015–16 NHL season</a>, Brewer was not re-signed by the Maple Leafs and became an unrestricted free agent on July 1, 2015. He spent the summer training in hopes of signing an NHL contract, but realized by mid-August that he was unlikely to find a team interested in his services, and chose not to extend his career by playing in Europe.

Throughout his career, Brewer has represented Canada at various international ice hockey tournaments. He first competed internationally as a member of Team Pacific Canada at the <a href="World%20U-17%20Hockey%20Challenge">1995 World U-17 Hockey Challenge</a> in <a href="Moncton">Moncton</a>, <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>. Three years later, he represented Canada as a whole as a member of the <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">national junior team</a> at the <a href="1998%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1998 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships</a>, where he was named an <a href="Captain%20%28ice%20hockey%29">alternate captain</a>. This was the tournament in which Canada had its worst ever showing, an eighth-place finish including a loss to <a href="Kazakhstan%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Kazakhstan</a>, giving Brewer an unkind welcome to <a href="International%20Ice%20Hockey%20Federation">IIHF</a> international ice hockey. Although eligible for the <a href="1999%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1999</a> edition of the same tournament, Brewer was unable to play due to NHL commitments with the New York Islanders.

Brewer made his debut with the <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Canadian national men's team</a> on April 24, 2001, when he joined Canada for the <a href="2001%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2001 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships</a> in <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>, <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, and <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a>, Germany. Later that year, on July 24, 2001, Brewer was invited to the orientation camp for the Canadian team for the <a href="2002%20Winter%20Olympics">2002 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah">Salt Lake City</a>, <a href="Utah">Utah</a>. Five months later, on December 12, 2001, Brewer was named to the final Canadian roster for the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%202002%20Winter%20Olympics">tournament</a>. In the opening game of the tournament against <a href="Sweden%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">Sweden</a>, Brewer scored Canada's second goal of the game in a 5–2 loss, while in the semi-finals of the tournament, Brewer scored the game-winning goal against <a href="Belarus%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">Belarus</a> in a 7–1 victory, helping send Canada to the gold medal game against the host <a href="United%20States%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">United States</a>. Canada would go on to defeat the Americans by a score of 5–2, winning their first <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%20Olympic%20Games">Olympic</a> <a href="Gold%20medal%23Olympic%20Games">gold medal</a> in fifty years.

Shortly after his Olympic experience, Brewer was named to the Canadian roster for the <a href="2002%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2002 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships</a> in <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>, <a href="Karlstad">Karlstad</a> and <a href="J%C3%B6nk%C3%B6ping">Jönköping</a>, <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, his second consecutive <a href="Ice%20Hockey%20World%20Championships">Ice Hockey World Championships</a>. He represented Canada once again the following year, when on April 22, 2003, Brewer was named to the Canadian roster for the <a href="2003%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2003 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships</a>. In the tournament quarterfinals versus <a href="Germany%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Germany</a>, Brewer scored the game-winning goal 37 seconds into <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">overtime</a> to give Canada a 3–2 victory. Canada would go on to win their first Ice Hockey World Championships gold medal since the <a href="1997%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1997</a> tournament, defeating Sweden 3–2 in overtime in the final. Brewer once again participated for Canada at the <a href="2004%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2004 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships</a>, his fourth consecutive Ice Hockey World Championships, where he helped Canada win its second consecutive championship after defeating Sweden 5–3 in the gold medal game.

On May 15, 2004, Brewer was named to the Canadian roster for the <a href="2004%20World%20Cup%20of%20Hockey">2004 World Cup of Hockey</a>. In the semifinal of the tournament, Brewer scored Canada's first goal of the game in 4–3 overtime victory against the <a href="Czech%20Republic%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Czech Republic</a>. Team Canada would go on to win the tournament on home ice in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, defeating <a href="Finland%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">Finland</a> 3–2 in the final. Just under one year following his World Cup appearance, Brewer was named to the orientation camp for the Canadian team at the <a href="2006%20Winter%20Olympics">2006 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Turin">Turin</a>, Italy held from August 15–20, 2005, in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> and <a href="Kelowna%2C%20British%20Columbia">Kelowna</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>. Following the camp, on October 18, 2005, Brewer was named to the preliminary 81-man Canadian roster for the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%202006%20Winter%20Olympics">tournament</a>. However, when the final roster was announced on December 21, 2005, Brewer was not among the 26 players listed. As a result, it would be nearly three years before Brewer would next suit up for his country, when on April 3, 2007, Brewer was among the first five players named to play for Canada at the <a href="2007%20IIHF%20World%20Championship">2007 IIHF World Championship</a> in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> and <a href="Mytishchi">Mytishchi</a>, Russia. For the tournament, Brewer was named as the team's only permanent alternate captain and helped the team to its third gold medal at the tournament in the past five years.

Russulaceae

The Russulaceae are a diverse <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> of <a href="fungi">fungi</a> in the order <a href="Russulales">Russulales</a>, with roughly 1,900 known <a href="species">species</a> and a worldwide distribution. They comprise the <a href="Russula">brittlegills</a> and the <a href="milk-cap">milk-cap</a>s, well-known <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>-forming fungi that include some <a href="Edible%20fungi">edible species</a>. These <a href="Lamella%20%28mycology%29">gilled</a> mushrooms are characterised by the brittle <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> of their <a href="basidiocarp">fruitbodies</a>.

In addition to these typical <a href="agaric">agaric</a>oid forms, the family contains species with fruitbodies that are laterally stiped (<a href="Pleurotoid%20fungi">pleurotoid</a>), closed (<a href="secotioid">secotioid</a> or <a href="Gasteroid%20fungi">gasteroid</a>), or crust-like (<a href="Corticioid%20fungi">corticioid</a>). <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular phylogenetics</a> has demonstrated close affinities between species with very different fruitbody types and has discovered new, distinct <a href="Lineage%20%28evolution%29">lineages</a>.

An important group of root-<a href="symbiosis">symbiotic</a> <a href="ectomycorrhiza">ectomycorrhiza</a>l fungi in forests and shrublands around the world includes "<a href="Lactifluus">Lactifluus</a>", "<a href="Multifurca">Multifurca</a>", "<a href="Russula">Russula</a>", and "<a href="Lactarius">Lactarius</a>". The crust-forming genera "<a href="Boidinia">Boidinia</a>", "<a href="Gloeopeniophorella">Gloeopeniophorella</a>", and "<a href="Pseudoxenasma">Pseudoxenasma</a>", all <a href="Wood-decay%20fungus">wood-decay fungi</a>, have <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> positions in the family.

The family Russulaceae was first <a href="valid%20name%20%28botany%29">validly named</a> in 1907 by Dutch botanist <a href="Johannes%20Paulus%20Lotsy">Johannes Paulus Lotsy</a>, who included three genera: "<a href="Russula">Russula</a>", "<a href="Lactarius">Lactarius</a>", and "Russulina" (now considered a synonym of "Russula"). He emphasised features such as the granular <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a>, thick gills, spiny <a href="basidiospore">spores</a>, and milky <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e and rounded cells (sphaerocytes). A prior usage of ""Russulariées"" by French mycologist <a href="Ernst%20Roze">Ernst Roze</a> in 1876 is not considered a valid publication, since the proper Latin termination for the family rank specified in article 18.4 of the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Nomenclature%20for%20algae%2C%20fungi%2C%20and%20plants">nomenclature code</a> was not used.

<a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">Synonyms</a> of Russulaceae include: <a href="Ernst%20Albert%20G%C3%A4umann">Ernst Albert Gäumann</a>'s Lactariaceae (1926), <a href="Fernand%20Moreau">Fernand Moreau</a>'s Asterosporaceae (1953), and <a href="David%20Pegler">David Pegler</a> and Thomas Young's Elasmomycetaceae (1979). The latter family was proposed to contain species with statismosporic (non-forcibly discharged) and symmetric spores, including the gasteroid genera "<a href="Elasmomyces">Elasmomyces</a>", "<a href="Gymnomyces">Gymnomyces</a>", "<a href="Martellia">Martellia</a>", and "<a href="Zelleromyces">Zelleromyces</a>". Calonge and Martín reduced the Elasmomycetaceae to synonymy with the Russulaceae when molecular analysis confirmed the close genetic relationship between the gasteroid and agaricoid genera.

Historically, the <a href="Agaric">gilled mushrooms</a> of the family Russulaceae were classified with other gilled species in the order <a href="Agaricales">Agaricales</a>, but microscopical studies of spore and fruitbody flesh features raised the possibility that they were more closely related with certain "lower fungi" presenting nongilled, <a href="Corticioid%20fungi">crust-like</a> fruitbodies. The use of <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetics</a> confirmed that these morphologically diverse fungi form a distinct lineage, first termed the "russuloid <a href="clade">clade</a>" and today classified as order <a href="Russulales">Russulales</a> in the class <a href="Agaricomycetes">Agaricomycetes</a>. The family's <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a> within the order appears to be the crust-like <a href="Gloeocystidiellaceae">Gloeocystidiellaceae</a>.

A 2008 molecular phylogenetic study clarified the relationships among the <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>-forming species of the family. The authors demonstrated the existence of four distinct lineages of gilled mushrooms, which led to the description of "<a href="Multifurca">Multifurca</a>" as a new genus separated from "Russula" and the segregation of "<a href="Lactifluus">Lactifluus</a>" from "Lactarius".

Genera with closed fruitbodies within the family are <a href="form%20classification">form taxa</a> instead of natural groups: "Arcangeliella", "Gastrolactarius", and "Zelleromyces" are phylogenetically part of "Lactarius", while "Cystangium", "Elasmomyces", "Gymnomyces", "Macowanites", and "Martellia" belong to "Russula". Nevertheless, some of these genus names are still in use, as many of the concerned species have not yet formally been synonymised with "Lactarius" or "Russula".

The crust-like genera "<a href="Boidinia">Boidinia</a>", "<a href="Gloeopeniophorella">Gloeopeniophorella</a>", and "<a href="Pseudoxenasma">Pseudoxenasma</a>", formerly placed in the <a href="Corticiaceae">Corticiaceae</a> or Gloeocystidiellaceae, are now classified in the Russulaceae and basal to the clade of mushroom-forming species described above. Studies have so far failed to clearly <a href="circumscription%20%28taxonomy%29">circumscribe</a> and place these genera within the family. "Boidinia" in its current extent is <a href="polyphyletic">polyphyletic</a>, with some species not falling into the Russulaceae.

Altogether, the Russulaceae comprise around 1,900 accepted species. "Russula" is by far the largest genus with c. 1100 species, "Lactarius" has c. 550, "Lactifluus" c. 120, "Boidinia" 13, "Multifurca" 6, "Gloeopeniophorella" 6, and "Pseudoxenasma" 1 species. Closed-fruitbody species not yet synonymised with "Lactarius" or "Russula" ("see above") account for some 150 species.

New species in the Russulaceae continue to be described from various regions, such as the US, Guyana, Brazil, Patagonia, Togo, Sri Lanka, or Thailand. It has been estimated that the real number of "Russula" species in North America alone (currently around 400 described) might be as high as 2000. <a href="Cryptic%20species%20complex">Cryptic species</a> may increase true diversity: some morphologically well-defined species, especially in "Lactifluus", have been shown to actually encompass several phylogenetic species.

Three major types of <a href="Sporocarp%20%28fungi%29">fruitbodies</a> occur in the Russulaceae: "<a href="agaricoid">agaricoid</a>" and "<a href="pleurotoid">pleurotoid</a>" forms with a <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a>, <a href="Lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a>, and a <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>; forms with closed ("<a href="gasteroid">gasteroid</a>") or partially closed ("<a href="secotioid">secotioid</a>") fruitbodies, and "<a href="corticioid">corticioid</a>", crust-like forms.

The "agaricoid" species in "Lactarius", "Lactifluus", "Multifurca", and "Russula" are readily distinguished from other gilled mushrooms by the consistency of their flesh, which is granular, brittle and breaks easily, somewhat like a piece of chalk. Russulaceae never have a <a href="Volva%20%28mycology%29">volva</a>, but a <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a> can be found in some tropical species. Gills are <a href="adnation">adnate</a> to <a href="decurrent">decurrent</a>, and the colour of the <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> ranges from white to ochre or orange (with the brown-spored "<a href="Lactarius%20chromospermus">Lactarius chromospermus</a>" as an exception).

Caps can be dull to very colourful, the latter especially in "Russula"; their size ranges from 17 mm diameter or less in "<a href="Russula%20campinensis">Russula campinensis</a>" to in "<a href="Lactifluus%20vellereus">Lactifluus vellereus</a>". Concentrically ringed (<a href="zonate">zonate</a>) caps occur in all "Multifurca" and several "Lactarius" species. Laterally stiped ("pleurotoid") fruitbodies exist in some, mainly tropical "Lactifluus" and "Russula" species. Taste is a distinguishing characteristic in many species, from mild to very acrid. A conspicuous feature of the "milk-caps" in "Lactarius, Lactifluus", and "<a href="Multifurca%20furcata">Multifurca furcata</a>" is the <a href="latex">latex</a> or "milk" their fruitbodies exude when bruised.

The "secotioid" and "gasteroid" species in "Lactarius" and "Russula" are derived from agaricoid forms. Secotioid species still have a stipe but the cap does not open fully, while in gasteroid species, fruitbodies are completely closed and the stipe is reduced; in both cases, the spore-bearing structure is made up of convoluted gills that are more or less crowded and <a href="anastomosis">anastomosed</a>. These closed-fruitbody species represent a continuum of secotioid to gasteroid, <a href="epigeous">above-ground</a> to <a href="hypogeous">below-ground</a> fruitbodies, with spores forcibly discharged or not. Secotioid or gasteroid "Lactarius" exude latex just like their agaricoid relatives.

The "corticioid" species of "Boidinia", "Gloeopeniophorella", and "Pseudoxenasma" develop crust-like fruitbodies with a smooth, porous, or flaky surface and grow on tree logs or dead branches.
All Russulaceae, including the corticioid species, are characterised by spherical to elliptic <a href="basidiospores">basidiospores</a> with a faint to very distinct (e.g. warty, spiny, or crested) ornamentation that <a href="staining">stains</a> bluish-black with <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a> (an <a href="Amyloid%20%28mycology%29">amyloid</a> stain reaction). <a href="Basidia">Basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells) are usually club-shaped and four-spored. Russulaceae species do not have <a href="clamp%20connection">clamp connection</a>s.

Characteristic cells with an oily content ("<a href="Cystidium">gloeocystidia</a>") are found in the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>. In Russulaceae, these show a positive colour reaction when treated with sulfoaldehydes (<a href="Chemical%20tests%20in%20mushroom%20identification%23sulfo-vanillin">sulfovanillin</a> is mostly used). They are also present in the hyphal sheath of ectomycorrhizal roots colonised by Russulaceae.

The feature responsible for the brittle fruitbody structure in the mushroom-forming species are globular cells, called "sphaerocytes" or "sphaerocysts", that compose the flesh (<a href="Trama%20%28mycology%29">"trama"</a>) alongside the usual <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e. Sometimes, these cells are clustered, and the position and arrangement of these clusters differs among genera.

Another particular trama cell type are "lactiferous" hyphae (also "lactifers"). These are hyphae carrying the "milk" or "latex" exuded by the <a href="milk-caps">milk-caps</a>; they react positively with sulfoaldehydes, form an abundantly branched system in the trama and end as "pseudocystidia" in the hymenium. In general, only "Lactarius", "Lactifluus" and "Multifurca furcata" possess lactifers. In "Russula", similar hyphae can sometimes be observed in the trama, but these are not as abundantly branched as real lactifers and do not extend into the hymenium as pseudocystidia. This traditional distinction line between the "milk-caps" and "Russula" is however less evident in some tropical species presenting intermediate states.

Some characteristics of the mushroom-forming genera (marked with * below) can be less obvious or absent in tropical species. Distinguishing between "Lactarius" and "Lactifluus" based on morphology alone is quite difficult, as clear <a href="synapomorphy">synapomorphies</a> for both genera have yet to be identified. Most field guides treat the two genera together, often because "Lactifluus" is not yet recognised as a separate genus.

The Russulaceae as a whole have a worldwide distribution, but patterns differ among genera. "Russula" is the most widespread, found in North, Central and South America, Europe, temperate and tropical Asia, Africa, and Australasia. It is the only Russulaceae genus that occurs in the "<a href="Nothofagus">Nothofagus</a>" zone of temperate South America.

"Lactarius" is mainly known from the north temperate zone, but some species also occur in tropical Asia and Africa. "Lactifluus" has a more tropical distribution than "Lactarius", with most species known from tropical Africa, Asia, South America, and Australasia, but some also occurring in the north temperate zone. "Multifurca" is the rarest among the four mushroom genera, known only from some punctual records in North and Central America, Asia, and Australasia.

Species of "Lactarius", "Lactifluus", and "Russula" have repeatedly been <a href="Introduced%20species">introduced</a> with trees outside their native range: An overview article lists introductions in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, the USA, Great Britain, the Faroe Islands, South Africa, China, Thailand, and New Zealand.

Among the corticioid genera, "Pseudoxenasma" is only known from Europe. In contrast, "Boidinia" species have been found in Europe, Taiwan, and Japan, and "Gloeopeniophorella" species in North America, South America, Europe, West Africa, Taiwan, Australia, and New Zealand.

The genera "Lactarius", "Lactifluus", "Multifurca" and "Russula" form a mutualistic <a href="ectomycorrhiza">ectomycorrhiza</a>l root <a href="symbiosis">symbiosis</a> with trees and shrubs, exchanging mineral nutrients for <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthetic</a> sugar. They are one of several fungal lineages that have evolved such a lifestyle and are sometimes referred to as the "/russula-lactarius" clade in the scientific literature. Worldwide, they are one of the most frequently encountered lineages on ectomycorrhizal roots. While some tropical species were initially believed to be parasitic, the observation that species fruiting on tree trunks do form ectomycorrhiza in tropical Guyana supports the view of an exclusively symbiotic lineage.

Associations are known with several plant families. In the Northern Hemisphere, these are essentially the well-known ectomycorrhizal trees and shrubs in the <a href="Betulaceae">Betulaceae</a>, <a href="Fagaceae">Fagaceae</a>, <a href="Pinaceae">Pinaceae</a> and <a href="Salicaceae">Salicaceae</a>, but in arctic and alpine habitats, Russulaceae also associate with "<a href="Bistorta%20vivipara">Bistorta vivipara</a>" (Polygonaceae), "<a href="Kobresia">Kobresia</a>" (Cyperaceae), and "<a href="Dryas%20octopetala">Dryas octopetala</a>" (Rosaceae), ectomycorrhizal plants untypic in their respective families. In the tropics, known plant partners include <a href="Dipterocarpaceae">Dipterocarpaceae</a>, <a href="Fabaceae">Fabaceae</a>, <a href="Nyctaginaceae">Nyctaginaceae</a>, <a href="Phyllanthaceae">Phyllanthaceae</a>, Polygonaceae ("<a href="Coccoloba">Coccoloba</a>"), <a href="Sarcolaenaceae">Sarcolaenaceae</a>, and the gymnosperm "<a href="Gnetum%20gnemon">Gnetum gnemon</a>", and in the Southern Hemisphere, <a href="Nothofagaceae">Nothofagaceae</a>, Myrtaceae ("<a href="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a>" and "<a href="Leptospermum">Leptospermum</a>"), and Rhamnaceae ("<a href="Pomaderris">Pomaderris</a>"). Some Russulaceae are quite specialised in their ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, such as "Lactarius" and "Russula" species that only grow with "<a href="Cistus">Cistus</a>" shrubs in the Mediterranean basin.

The different plant partners are reflected in the wide variety of habitats worldwide. Ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae have been observed in arctic and alpine <a href="tundra">tundra</a>, <a href="Taiga">boreal</a> and alpine forest, <a href="Temperate%20broadleaf%20and%20mixed%20forest">north temperate forest</a>, <a href="mire">mire</a>s, mediterranean forests and scrub (<a href="Maquis%20shrubland">maquis</a>), <a href="miombo">miombo</a> woodland, <a href="Tropical%20rainforest">tropical lowland rainforest</a>, <a href="Cloud%20forest">tropical cloud forest</a>, <a href="Tropical%20and%20subtropical%20dry%20broadleaf%20forest">tropical dry forest</a>, Australian <a href="Eucalyptus">eucalypt</a> woodlands, and south temperate forests. Where they are introduced, they typically grow in plantations of their native host species, e.g. with <a href="pine">pine</a> in South Africa, "Eucalyptus" in Thailand, or <a href="birch">birch</a> in New Zealand.

Some of the ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae are also involved in other types of root symbioses with plants.

A mutualistic association similar to ectomycorrhiza but with some hyphae penetrating into the plant root cells, termed "<a href="arbutoid%20mycorrhiza">arbutoid mycorrhiza</a>", is formed by Russulaceae with shrubs of the genera "<a href="Arbutus">Arbutus</a>" and "<a href="Arctostaphylos">Arctostaphylos</a>", both in subfamily <a href="Arbutoideae">Arbutoideae</a> of the <a href="Ericaceae">Ericaceae</a>.

Some Russulaceae are associated with <a href="myco-heterotrophic">myco-heterotrophic</a> plants of the Ericaceae subfamily <a href="Monotropoideae">Monotropoideae</a>, forming "<a href="monotropoid%20mycorrhiza">monotropoid mycorrhiza</a>". This is an <a href="Epiparasite">epiparasitic</a> relationship, where the heterotrophic plant ultimately derives its carbon from the primary, ectomycorrhizal plant partner of the fungus. The association is often very specific, with the heterotrophic plants only associating with selected fungus partners, including Russulaceae.

Russulaceae are also an important group of <a href="orchid%20mycorrhiza">orchid mycorrhiza</a>l fungi. This symbiosis is mutualistic in the case of green orchids, but a partly or fully epiparasitic relationship in the case of myco-heterotrophic and <a href="mixotroph">mixotroph</a>ic orchids, respectively. In some cases, the association with Russulaceae is, as in monotropoid mycorrhiza, very specific: the Mediterranean orchid "<a href="Limodorum%20abortivum">Limodorum abortivum</a>" predominantly associates with "<a href="Russula%20delica">Russula delica</a>" and closely related species; in "<a href="Corallorhiza%20maculata">Corallorhiza maculata</a>", different genotypes of the same species have distinct "Russula" partners.

The corticioid species in "Boidinia", "Gloeopeniophorella", and "Pseudoxenasma" are <a href="saprotrophic">saprotrophic</a>, <a href="Wood-decay%20fungus">wood-degrading fungi</a> that develop on <a href="Coarse%20woody%20debris">dead wood</a>. Their early-branching positions in the phylogeny suggests this has been the ancestral trophic mode of the Russulaceae, and that the mycorrhizal lifestyle "(see above)" evolved later. The saprotrophic nature of these species has been questioned, based on the observation that other inconspicuous, crust-forming fungi are ectomycorrhizal; a subsequent author reaffirms nevertheless that "[n]one of the corticioid species in the family shows any sign of mycorrhizal activity."

Hypogeous fruitbodies, or fruitbodies developing below ground, occur in "Lactarius" and "Russula" and have previously been considered as distinct genera (see "Systematics and taxonomy: Internal systematics"). As such species are especially diverse in some warm and dry regions, e.g. in Spain, California, or Australia, below-ground fruiting has been interpreted as an adaptation to drought. However, hypogeous Russulaceae are also known from cold temperate regions and tropical rainforest. The fact that hypogeous species in the Russulaceae do not form their own lineages but are scattered in "Russula" or "Lactarius" shows that this type of fruiting evolved several times. It is believed that these changes are evolutionarily quite recent.

Russulaceae fruitbodies are subject to <a href="parasitism">parasitisation</a> by other fungi. The genus "<a href="Asterophora">Asterophora</a>" develops on old fruitbodies of the mushroom species in the family, as does "<a href="Dendrocollybia%20racemosa">Dendrocollybia racemosa</a>" on at least "<a href="Russula%20crassotunicata">Russula crassotunicata</a>". Fruitbodies of "Lactifluus" or "Russula" species otherwise hot-tasting and unpalatable are regarded as choice edibles in North America when infected by the "lobster mushroom" "<a href="Hypomyces%20lactifluorum">Hypomyces lactifluorum</a>". Heterotrophic plants, including <a href="orchids">orchids</a> or <a href="Monotropoideae">monotropoids</a>, also parasitise ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae and their plant partners – see above, "Other types of mycorrhiza".

As with most fungi, little information is available on the threat of extinction for Russulaceae species, and they have not been assessed in the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List</a>. However, national lists contain some species of "Lactarius", "Lactifluus" and "Russula", indicating that they have small populations and are endangered, e.g. in Great Britain, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand.

Although data on Russulaceae themselves are scarce, more is known about the habitats they occur in, especially for the ectomycorrhizal species which depend on their host plants: Several of these habitats are affected by loss or degradation, such as peatlands, Mediterranean forests and scrub or tropical African dry woodland. Similarly, dead wood, the habitat of the corticioid Russulaceae, is rare in many exploited forests and needs special management.

Recent studies have found some traditional Russulaceae species to comprise several cryptic species (see "Systematics and taxonomy: Species diversity"). This may imply that distribution range and population size for each of such distinct species are smaller than previously thought.

Several species of "Lactarius", "Lactifluus" and "Russula" are valued as excellent edible mushrooms. This is the case for example for the north temperate species "<a href="Lactarius%20deliciosus">Lactarius deliciosus</a>", "<a href="Lactifluus%20volemus">Lactifluus volemus</a>", or "<a href="Russula%20vesca">Russula vesca</a>", and other species are popular in other parts of the world, e.g. "<a href="Lactarius%20indigo">Lactarius indigo</a>" in Mexico, or "<a href="Lactifluus%20edulis">Lactifluus edulis</a>" in tropical Africa. Some species, like "Russula vesca", can even be eaten raw. The brittle texture of "Russula" fruitbodies makes them different from other mushrooms and is not appreciated by some.

Several species have a hot to very acrid taste and can cause <a href="gastrointestinal%20symptom">gastrointestinal symptom</a>s. Despite this, such species are eaten in some regions, e.g. "<a href="Lactarius%20torminosus">Lactarius torminosus</a>" in Finland or Russia. Often, they are <a href="parboiled">parboiled</a> or <a href="pickled">pickled</a> to make them palatable, and sometimes, they are used as spice, for example "<a href="Russula%20emetica">Russula emetica</a>" in Eastern Europe. Some species are however truly <a href="Mushroom%20poisoning">poisonous</a>: the East Asian and North American "<a href="Russula%20subnigricans">Russula subnigricans</a>" causes <a href="rhabdomyolysis">rhabdomyolysis</a> and is potentially lethal, and "<a href="Lactarius%20turpis">Lactarius turpis</a>" from Eurasia contains a <a href="mutagenic">mutagenic</a> substance.

Cultivation of edible Russulaceae, as in other ectomycorrhizal fungi, is challenging, since the presence of host trees is required. In spite of this difficulty, the European "Lactarius deliciosus" has been successfully grown in "mushroom orchards" in New Zealand.

Fruitbodies of Russulaceae have been the subject of <a href="natural%20product">natural product</a> research, and different classes of organic compounds have been isolated from them.

<a href="Aroma%20compounds">Aroma compounds</a> are responsible for the particular odour or taste in some species, e.g. "<a href="sotolon">sotolon</a>" in the <a href="fenugreek">fenugreek</a>-smelling "<a href="Lactarius%20helvus">Lactarius helvus</a>", or the similar "quabalactone III" in "<a href="Lactarius%20rubidus">Lactarius rubidus</a>" which causes a maple syrup-like odour in dried specimens. <a href="Pigments">Pigments</a> have been isolated from brightly coloured species, e.g. "(7-isopropenyl-4-methylazulen-1-yl)methyl stearate" from the blue "Lactarius indigo" or "russulaflavidin" and a derivative from the yellow "<a href="Russula%20flavida">Russula flavida</a>". Some "Russula" species contain pigmented "<a href="pteridine">pteridine</a>" derivatives called "russupteridines" that are not found in the milk-caps. "<a href="Sesquiterpenes">Sesquiterpenes</a>" are characteristic secondary metabolites of many Russulaceae, especially milk-caps which have been quite intensively studied. They are thought to be responsible for the hot taste in many species and may have deterrent, antifeeding functions in nature.

Other metabolites isolated from different species include "dibenzonaphtyridinone <a href="alkaloid">alkaloid</a>s", <a href="Prenylation">prenylated</a> "<a href="phenol">phenol</a>s", "<a href="benzofuran">benzofuran</a>s", "<a href="chromene">chromene</a>s", natural rubber ("<a href="polyisoprene">polyisoprene</a>"), "sterols", and the sugar alcohol <a href="volemitol">volemitol</a>. Among toxic substances, "Lactarius turpis" contains the mutagenic alkaloid "necatorin", and the small compound "<a href="cycloprop-2-ene%20carboxylic%20acid">cycloprop-2-ene carboxylic acid</a>" has been identified as the toxic agent in "Russula subnigricans". Some secondary metabolites showed antibiotic properties in laboratory tests. An ethanolic extract of "Russula delica" was antibacterial, and a "<a href="lectin">lectin</a>" from "<a href="Russula%20rosea">Russula rosea</a>" showed antitumor activity.
