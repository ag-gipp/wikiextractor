Isabella quarter

The Isabella quarter or Columbian Exposition quarter was a <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">United States commemorative coin</a> struck in 1893. Congress authorized the piece at the request of the Board of Lady Managers of the <a href="World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition">World's Columbian Exposition</a>. The <a href="quarter%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">quarter</a> depicts the Spanish queen <a href="Isabella%20I%20of%20Castile">Isabella I of Castile</a>, who sponsored <a href="Voyages%20of%20Christopher%20Columbus">Columbus's voyages to the New World</a>. It was designed by <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Bureau of the Mint</a> Chief Engraver <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a>, and is the only U.S. commemorative of that denomination that was not intended for circulation.

The Board of Lady Managers, headed by Chicago socialite <a href="Bertha%20Palmer">Bertha Palmer</a>, wanted a woman to design the coin and engaged Caroline Peddle, a sculptor. Peddle left the project after disagreements with Mint officials, who then decided to have Barber do the work. The reverse design, showing a kneeling woman spinning flax, with a <a href="distaff">distaff</a> in her left hand and a <a href="Spindle%20%28textiles%29">spindle</a> in her right, symbolizes women's industry and was based on a sketch by Assistant Engraver <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a>.

The quarter's design was deprecated in the <a href="Numismatics">numismatic</a> press. The coin did not sell well at the Exposition; its price of $1 was the same as for the <a href="Columbian%20half%20dollar">Columbian half dollar</a>, and the quarter was seen as the worse deal. Nearly half of the authorized issue was returned to the Mint to be melted; thousands more were purchased at face value by the Lady Managers and entered the coin market in the early 20th century. Today, they are popular with collectors and are valued in the hundreds to thousands of dollars, depending on condition.

In August 1892, Congress passed an act authorizing the first <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">United States commemorative coin</a>, <a href="Columbian%20half%20dollar">a half dollar</a>, to be sold at a premium by the managers of the <a href="World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition">World's Columbian Exposition</a> in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. The event had been authorised by <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> two years previously; that legislation created a Board of Lady Managers and a Board of Gentleman Managers to oversee the fair. The Board of Lady Managers was headed by <a href="Bertha%20Palmer">Bertha Palmer</a>, whose husband <a href="Potter%20Palmer">Potter</a> owned the <a href="Palmer%20House">Palmer House</a>, the leading hotel in Chicago. The decisions of the Lady Managers were often reversed by their male counterparts on controversial matters: for example, Palmer sought to shut the fair's "Egyptian Girls" dancing show after deeming it obscene. The show was one of the exposition's few successful moneymakers, and the Lady Managers were overruled by the men.

Authorization for the Board of Lady Managers had been included in the 1890 law giving federal authority for the Exposition at the insistence of women's advocate, <a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony">Susan B. Anthony</a>, who was determined to show that women could successfully assist in the management of the fair. To that end, the Lady Managers sought a coin to sell in competition with <a href="Columbian%20half%20dollar">the commemorative half dollar</a> at the Exposition, which Congress had approved in 1892. Passage of the half dollar legislation had been difficult, and the Lady Managers decided to wait until the next session of Congress to make their request. When the half dollar appeared in November 1892, the Lady Managers considered it inartistic and determined to do better. Palmer wanted the Lady Managers "to have credit of being the authors of the first really beautiful and artistic coin that has ever been issued by the government of the United States".

In January 1893, Palmer approached the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Appropriations">House Appropriations Committee</a>, asking that $10,000 of the funds already designated to be paid over to the Lady Managers by the federal government be in the form of souvenir quarters, which they could sell at a premium. On March 3, 1893, Congress duly passed an act authorising the souvenir coin, which was to be to the specifications of <a href="Barber%20coinage">the quarter</a> struck for circulation, and with a design to be approved by the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a>. Total mintage of the special quarter would be limited to 40,000 specimens.

Desiring a beautiful coin to sell, Palmer asked artist <a href="Kenyon%20Cox">Kenyon Cox</a> to produce sketches. She was, however, determined to have a woman actually design the coin. She also consulted with Sara Hallowell, who was both the secretary to the fair's Director of Fine Arts and was helping the Palmers amass a major art collection. Hallowell contacted sculptor <a href="Augustus%20Saint-Gaudens">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a>, who recommended his onetime student, Caroline Peddle, who was already engaged in exposition work, having been commissioned by <a href="Tiffany%27s">Tiffany's</a> to produce an exhibit. Palmer agreed to have Peddle do the work.

After Congress authorized the souvenir quarter, the <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Director of the Bureau of the Mint</a>, <a href="Edward%20O.%20Leech">Edward O. Leech</a>, wrote to Palmer on March 14, 1893. Although he expressed a willingness to have the Lady Managers select the design, Mint Chief Engraver <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a> and <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> Superintendent <a href="Oliver%20Bosbyshell">Oliver Bosbyshell</a> had already urged Leech to keep the design process in-house at the Mint. Palmer replied that the Lady Managers had decided that the quarter would bear a portrait of <a href="Isabella%20I%20of%20Castile">Isabella I</a>, <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">Queen of Castile</a> (in Spain), whose assistance had helped pay for Columbus's expedition. Palmer indicated that she was consulting artists and suggested that the Mint submit a design for consideration. She also met with Illinois Congressman <a href="Allan%20C.%20Durborow%2C%20Jr.">Allen Durborow</a>, chairman of the House of Representatives' Fair Committee and a former colleague of Secretary of the Treasury <a href="John%20G.%20Carlisle">John G. Carlisle</a>, Leech's superior. Palmer suggested to the congressman that he advocate for the Lady Managers with Carlisle and Leech.

Palmer, by letter, hired Peddle to do the design work in late March. She instructed the artist that the coin was to have a figure of Isabella on the obverse, and the inscription "Commemorative coin issued for the Board of Lady Managers of the World's Columbian Exposition by Act of Congress, 1492–1892" on the reverse, as well as the denomination and the name of the country. The chairwoman did not request that Peddle provide the Lady Managers with the design before sending it to the Mint. Palmer informed Carlisle and Leech of her instructions. Carlisle had no objection to a coin being designed by a woman, or to the use of Isabella's head. The secretary told Palmer that the reverse, with its long inscription, would appear like a business advertising token, and he asked that it be revised. Leech sent a note to Superintendent Bosbyshell informing him that the Lady Managers would likely have an outside sculptor create the obverse and asking him to have Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber create some designs for the reverse for possible use.
Obedient to Palmer's instructions, Peddle sent Leech sketches of a seated Isabella, with the long inscription on the reverse; she hoped the Mint Director would allow her to shorten it. Leech was unhappy with the reverse, and decided that Barber would design that side of the coin. Barber and Bosbyshell wrote to Leech that Isabella's legs would appear distorted if the seated figure were used and advocated a head in profile. Carlisle agreed, stating that he had only given permission for a head of Isabella. Peddle was informed that Barber would produce the reverse, though the design would be sent to her for approval, and she would have to change her obverse. Meanwhile, Palmer was growing increasingly anxious: with a timeline of two months from design approval to the availability of the actual coins, she feared that the pieces would not be available for sale until well into the fair's May to October run. Under pressure from all sides, Peddle threatened to quit the project, writing that she "could not consent to do half of a piece of work".

What finally wore down Peddle's patience were two letters dated April 7. One, from Leech, asserted his right as Mint director to prescribe coin designs, and told Peddle that the obverse would be a head of Isabella, while the reverse would be based on sketches by a Mint engraver which she would be free to model. The second, from Bosbyshell, imposed the additional requirement that Isabella not wear a crown, which he deemed inappropriate on an American coin. On April 8, 1893, Caroline Peddle withdrew from the project.

Following Peddle's resignation, Leech wrote a conciliatory letter to Palmer, who responded regretting that the three of them had not worked together, rather than at cross-purposes. Palmer had written to suggest an alternative to the inscription reverse: that the coin depict the Women's Building at the fair. Barber prepared sketches and rejected the idea, stating that the building would appear a mere streak on the coin in the required low relief. Instead, he favored a sketch prepared by Assistant Engraver <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a>, showing a kneeling woman spinning flax, with a <a href="distaff">distaff</a> in her hands. Leech was not fully satisfied with the proposal, stating that the juxtaposition of Isabella on the obverse and the Morgan reverse was "too much woman". Before accepting Morgan's design, Leech wanted Barber to produce some reverses himself, which the chief engraver did, and Bosbyshell forwarded them to Leech on April 11 and 12. These showed various uses of a <a href="spreadeagle%20%28heraldry%29">heraldic eagle</a>. After considering these efforts, Leech decided on Morgan's design and wrote to Palmer accordingly, stating that "the distaff is used in art to symbolize patient industry, and especially the industry of women." In response, the Lady Managers suggested the use of the building's portal, and asked if it was possible to place a living person on the coin. Leech stated that Secretary Carlisle had selected the distaff reverse, and his determination was binding.

Bosbyshell informed Leech by letter that Stewart Cullin, curator at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, possessed a number of medals depicting Isabella, and former general <a href="Oliver%20O.%20Howard">Oliver O. Howard</a> was engaged in writing a biography of the late queen and possessed likenesses of her. Leech agreed that these men be consulted. Carlisle was reluctant to allow an inscription which made distinctions by sex, such as "Board of Lady Managers", to appear on the coin, but he eventually agreed to that wording. On April 24, the Mint Director sent Palmer a box containing two plaster models of the obverse, one of Isabella as a young queen, the other showing her more mature. He also informed her that distaff reverse would be used, with the wording agreed to by Carlisle. The obverse models were supposedly made by Barber based on an engraving of Isabella forwarded by Peddle to the Mint at Palmer's request, but Moran suggests that the period of only a day between receipt of the engraving and completion of the models (during which Barber also attended the funeral of Bosbyshell's grandson) means that Barber was working on them before that. The Board of Lady Managers on May 5 selected the young queen.

The obverse of the Isabella quarter depicts a crowned and richly clothed bust of that Spanish queen. According to art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, Barber's obverse design "follow[s] Gilbert Scott's Victorian Gothic tradition of photographic classicism, best summed up by the groups of continents and the reliefs of famous persons on the <a href="Albert%20Memorial">Albert Memorial</a> in London." The reverse depicts a kneeling woman with distaff and spindle. Vermeule traces that imagery to the figure of a young female servant, carved upon the east pediment of the <a href="Temple%20of%20Zeus%2C%20Olympia">Temple of Zeus</a> at <a href="Olympia%2C%20Greece">Olympia</a> in the 5th century B.C. Nevertheless, a contemporary account in the "American Journal of Numismatics" compared the reverse to an anti-slavery token with a kneeling woman and the legend "Am I not a woman and a sister". The art historian, writing in 1971, noted that "nowadays the coin seems charming for its quaintness and its Victorian flavor, a mixture of cold Hellenism and Renaissance romance. Perhaps one of its greatest joys is that none of the customary inscriptions, mottoes and such, appear on it."

Numismatic historian <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a>, in his study of early U.S. commemoratives, dismissed contemporary accounts (such as in the fair's official book) that Kenyon Cox had provided a design for the quarter; he noted that the artist's son had strongly denied that his father was involved in the coin's creation. Taxay deemed the design "commonplace" and "typical of Barber's style", stating that "the modeling, though somewhat more highly relieved than on the half dollar, is without distinction".

The "American Journal of Numismatics" had other criticisms of the quarter:

Minting of what Barber dubbed "showy quarters" began at the Philadelphia Mint on June 13, 1893, six weeks after the exposition opened. Leech had planned to strike the pieces using polished blanks, or <a href="planchet">planchet</a>s, and workers at that mint handled the coins carefully; unlike the half dollar, surviving specimens display relatively few contact marks from other coins. The first piece struck, along with numbers 400, 1,492, and 1,892, were struck in proof condition and sent to the Lady Managers along with certificates attesting to their status. A total of 40,023 pieces were struck, with the 23 coins over the authorized mintage retained by the Mint for inspection by the 1894 <a href="Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>.

The pieces did not sell well at the exposition. They were for sale only at the Women's Building at the fair, or by mail; the half dollar could be purchased at several outlets. Some 15,000 quarters were sold to collectors, dealers, and fairgoers, including several thousand of them purchased by the <a href="John%20Walter%20Scott">Scott Stamp and Coin Company</a>. Fairgoers viewed the quarter as not as good a deal as the half dollar, as both sold for the same price of $1. Of the remainder, approximately 10,000 quarters were bought at face value by Palmer and other Lady Managers; 15,809 were returned to the government for melting. After deducting pieces returned for melting, a total of 24,214 coins were distributed to the public.

The large quantities possessed by the Lady Managers made their way into the market through dealers and other vendors in the 1920s. By 1930, prices had risen to the original issue price; by 1955, uncirculated specimens sold for $20. The pieces are popular among collectors because they are the only U.S. quarter dollars issued strictly as a commemorative, not for circulation. The 2018 deluxe edition of <a href="R.S.%20Yeoman">R.S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" lists the piece as ranging between $325 in almost uncirculated AU-50 on the <a href="Sheldon%20coin%20grading%20scale">Sheldon coin grading scale</a> and $3,750 in near-pristine MS-66.

Neil Hamilton Fairley

<a href="Brigadier">Brigadier</a> Sir Neil Hamilton Fairley, (15 July 1891 – 19 April 1966) was an Australian physician, medical scientist, and army officer; who was instrumental in saving thousands of Allied lives from <a href="malaria">malaria</a> and other diseases.

A graduate of the <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a>, Fairley joined the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Australian Army Medical Corps</a> in 1915. He investigated an epidemic of <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a> that was occurring in Army camps in Australia. While with the 14th General Hospital in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, he investigated <a href="schistosomiasis">schistosomiasis</a> (then known as bilharzia) and developed tests and treatments for the disease. In the inter-war period he became renowned as an expert on tropical medicine.

Fairley returned to the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> as Director of Medicine. He played an important role in the planning for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">Battle of Greece</a>, convincing the British <a href="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</a>, General <a href="Archibald%20Wavell%2C%201st%20Earl%20Wavell">Sir Archibald Wavell</a> to alter his <a href="campaign%20plan">campaign plan</a> to reduce the danger from <a href="malaria">malaria</a>. In the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area">South West Pacific Area</a>, Fairley became responsible for co-ordinating the activities of all allied forces in the fight against malaria and other tropical diseases. Fairley again sounded the alarm on the dangers of malaria, persuading authorities in the United States and United Kingdom to greatly step up production of anti-malarial drugs. Through the activities of the LHQ Medical Research Unit, he fast-tracked research into new drugs. Fairley convinced the Army of the efficacy of the new drug <a href="atebrin">atebrin</a>, and persuaded commanders to adopt a tough approach to administering the drug to the troops.

After the war Fairley returned to London where he became a consulting physician to the <a href="Hospital%20for%20Tropical%20Diseases">Hospital for Tropical Diseases</a> and Wellcome Professor of Tropical Medicine at the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Hygiene%20and%20Tropical%20Medicine">London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</a>. A serious illness in 1948 forced him to resign his professorship, but he retained his practice and membership of numerous committees, becoming an "elder statesman" of tropical medicine.

Neil Hamilton Fairley was born in <a href="Inglewood%2C%20Victoria">Inglewood, Victoria</a>, on 15 July 1891, as the third of six sons of James Fairley, a bank manager, and his wife Margaret Louisa, née Jones. All four of their sons who survived to adulthood took up medicine as a career. One qualified as a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Medicine">Doctor of Medicine</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a> and a <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20College%20of%20Surgeons">Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons</a> in England and became a surgeon; he was <a href="killed%20in%20action">killed in action</a> in the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. A second also qualified as a Doctor of Medicine at the University of Melbourne, and later as a <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Australasian%20College%20of%20Physicians">Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians</a> and <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20College%20of%20Physicians">Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians</a>; he became senior physician at <a href="Royal%20Melbourne%20Hospital">Royal Melbourne Hospital</a>. A third son became a <a href="general%20practitioner">general practitioner</a>.

Neil was educated at <a href="Scotch%20College%2C%20Melbourne">Scotch College, Melbourne</a>, where he was <a href="dux">dux</a> of his class. He attended the <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a>, graduating with his <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Medicine%20and%20Surgery">Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery</a> with first class honours in 1915, and his Doctor of Medicine in 1917. While there, he won the Australian inter-varsity <a href="high%20jump">high jump</a>ing championship and represented <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> in tennis.

Fairley joined the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Australian Army Medical Corps</a> with the rank of <a href="Captain%20%28land%29">captain</a> on 1 August 1915 and was posted to Royal Melbourne Hospital as a resident medical officer. He investigated an epidemic of <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a> that was occurring in local Army camps, and his first published paper was an analysis of this disease, documenting fifty cases. In 1916, he co-authored a monograph published by the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Federal government</a> detailing 644 cases, of which 338 (52%) were fatal, this being before the invention of <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a> drugs.
Fairley enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">First Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) on 24 August 1916. On 5 September 1916, he embarked for <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> on RMS "Kashgar", joining the 14th General Hospital in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>. There he encountered Major <a href="Charles%20James%20Martin%20%28scientist%29">Charles Martin</a>, formerly Professor of <a href="Physiology">Physiology</a> at the University of Melbourne and Director of the <a href="The%20Lister%20Institute%20for%20Preventive%20Medicine">Lister Institute</a> from 1903 to 1930. At this time, Martin was working as a Consulting Physician to the AIF in Egypt and commanded the Anzac Field Laboratory.

While in Egypt, Fairley investigated <a href="schistosomiasis">schistosomiasis</a> (then known as bilharzia). The disease was known to be caused by contact with fresh water inhabited by certain species of <a href="snail">snail</a>s, and orders had been issued that prohibited bathing in fresh water, but the troops were slow to appreciate the danger involved. In its toxic phase, the disease was easily confused with <a href="typhus">typhus</a>, so Fairley developed a <a href="complement%20fixation%20test">complement fixation test</a> for the disease along the lines of the <a href="Wassermann%20test">Wassermann test</a>. He studied its <a href="pathology">pathology</a>, confirming that the worms in the <a href="circulatory%20system">circulatory system</a> could be cured by intravenous <a href="tartaric%20acid">tartaric acid</a>. Fairley also studied, and later published papers on <a href="typhus">typhus</a>, <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, and <a href="Shigellosis">bacillary dysentery</a>.

Fairley married Staff Nurse Violet May Phillips at the Garrison Church, Abbassia, Cairo on 12 February 1919. They later divorced on 21 November 1924. He was promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> on 15 March 1919 and commanded the 14th General Hospital for a time before embarking for the United Kingdom in June 1919. For his services in the First World War, Fairley was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> and made an Officer of the Military Division of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Order of the British Empire</a>. His citation read: 

Fairley was one of a number of AIF officers granted leave "to visit various hospitals in the United Kingdom so that they become conversant with the latest developments in the medical sciences". For a time, he worked for Martin at the Lister Institute in London where he qualified for membership of the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Physicians">Royal College of Physicians</a> of London. He also received a Diploma of Public Health from the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>. He returned to Australia on the transport "Orontes" in February 1920, to become a <a href="research%20assistant">research assistant</a> to Sydney Patterson, director of the <a href="Walter%20and%20Eliza%20Hall%20Institute%20of%20Medical%20Research">Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research</a>, where Fairley worked on developing a test for <a href="echinococcosis">echinococcosis</a> along the lines of the test that he had already developed for bilharzia.

Fairley remained for less than a year before resigning to take up a five-year appointment in <a href="Mumbai">Bombay</a> as Chair of Clinical Tropical Medicine at a newly created School of Tropical Medicine, a post for which he had been nominated by the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>. On arrival in <a href="British%20Raj">India</a>, he found that the scheme had been abandoned and that as his appointment could be terminated at six-months' notice, he would no longer be required after October 1922. Fairley demanded and received an audience with the <a href="Governor%20of%20Bombay">Governor of Bombay</a>, <a href="George%20Lloyd%2C%201st%20Baron%20Lloyd">Sir George Lloyd</a>, the result of which was that the Secretary of State agreed to create a special five-year post of Medical Officer of the <a href="Haffkine%20Institute">Bombay Bacteriological Laboratory</a> and Honorary Consulting Physician to the <a href="Grant%20Medical%20College%20and%20Sir%20Jamshedjee%20Jeejebhoy%20Group%20of%20Hospitals">Sir Jamshedjee Jeejebhoy Hospital</a> and <a href="St%20George%20Hospital%2C%20Mumbai">St George Hospital</a>.

In India, Fairley continued his research into schistosomiasis. The disease was unknown in India but snails were abundant and there was danger that troops returning from Egypt might introduce it. In the absence of human schistosoma, Fairley investigated bovine schistosoma, which infected water buffalo and other domesticated animals in the Bombay area. Experiments with monkeys proved that daily intravenous doses of tartaric acid were an effective treatment. Fairley also carried out pioneering work on Guinea worm disease (<a href="dracunculiasis">dracunculiasis</a>). However, his main interest was <a href="Tropical%20sprue">Tropical sprue</a>. But he was unable to determine its cause or discover a cure; in spite of contracting the disease himself and making some advances in its treatment. He was invalided out of India, travelling to the United Kingdom to recuperate in 1925. While in India he had met Mary Evelyn Greaves, and they were married at the Presbyterian Church, <a href="Marylebone">Marylebone</a>, on 28 October 1925.

Fairley returned to Australia in 1927 and rejoined the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He worked there for two years, collaborating with the new director, <a href="Charles%20Kellaway">Charles Kellaway</a> in studies of <a href="snake%20venom">snake venom</a>s and with Harold Dew on the development of diagnostic tests for <a href="echinococcosis">echinococcosis</a>. Fairley dedicated most of 1928 to the snake venom programme, co-ordinating an enormous body of epidemiological data – including a questionnaire to Australian clinicians – on the frequency and outcome of bites by Australian <a href="elapid">elapid</a> snakes. This work involved numerous milkings to establish typical and maximal venom yields, innovative studies of snake dentition using wax moulds, and detailed dissections to describe each species' biting apparatus. Fairley furthermore undertook "in vivo" studies of envenomation in a range of large animal species, to determine the efficacy of prevailing first-aid measures. He concluded that at best, ligature and local venesection might slow time to death after a significant envenomation. This reinforced the need for effective antivenenes (<a href="antivenom">antivenom</a>s) for the more dangerous local species of snakes, notably the tiger snake ("<a href="Notechis%20scutatus">Notechis scutatus</a>"), death adder ("<a href="Acanthophis%20antarcticus">Acanthophis antarcticus</a>") and copperhead ("<a href="Austrelaps%20superbus">Austrelaps superbus</a>"), although only the former was suitable for manufacture by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (now <a href="CSL%20Limited">CSL Limited</a>).

In 1928, Fairley received an appointment in London as Assistant Physician to the <a href="Hospital%20for%20Tropical%20Diseases">Hospital for Tropical Diseases</a> and Lecturer at the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Hygiene%20and%20Tropical%20Medicine">London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</a>. Although he and Kellaway convinced the governors to delay Fairley's commencement until their major venom work was completed, he departed for London by the end of that year. He also opened a consulting practice in <a href="Harley%20Street">Harley Street</a>. In London he encountered patients with <a href="filariasis">filariasis</a> and devised a test to diagnose the disease at an early stage; but when he went to write up his results he discovered that details of a similar test had already been published. In 1934, a sewer worker was referred to his ward with acute <a href="jaundice">jaundice</a> which Fairley diagnosed as caused by <a href="filariasis">filariasis</a>. The disease was revealed to be an occupational hazard of sewer workers, and steps were taken to protect the workers. Perhaps his most important work in this period was research into <a href="blackwater%20fever">blackwater fever</a>. Since malaria cases were uncommon in the United Kingdom, he made annual visits to the Malaria Research Laboratory of the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> at the Refugee Hospital in <a href="Salonika">Salonika</a>. In the process, he described <a href="Methemalbumin">methaemalbumin</a>, a previously unknown blood pigment. For his scientific accomplishments in London, Fairley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1942.

With the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, the Australian Army's director general of medical services, Major General <a href="Rupert%20Downes">Rupert Downes</a> tapped Fairley as consulting physician. Fairley was seconded to the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) with the rank of <a href="colonel">colonel</a> on 15 July 1940 and given the serial number VX38970. He joined the AIF Headquarters in Cairo in September, taking advantage of the initial quiet period to familiarise himself with the AIF's medical units and their commanders. As the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> in the Middle East had no consulting physician in tropical diseases, Fairley accepted an offer to act in this capacity as well.

In January 1941 the British Army began planning for <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">operations in Greece</a>. Fairley and his British colleague, Colonel J. S. K. Boyd, the consulting <a href="pathologist">pathologist</a>, drafted a medical appreciation. Drawing on the experience of the <a href="Macedonian%20front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Salonika front</a> in the First World War, where very heavy casualties suffered from malaria, plus Fairley's more recent experience in that part of the world, they painted a gloomy picture, emphasising the grave risks, and going so far as to suggest that the Germans might attempt to entice the allies into a summer campaign in which they could be destroyed by malaria. The British <a href="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</a>, General <a href="Archibald%20Wavell%2C%201st%20Earl%20Wavell">Sir Archibald Wavell</a> decried their report as "typical of a very non-medical and non-military spirit", but a face-to-face meeting with Boyd and Fairley convinced Wavell that they were serious and not merely uncooperative, and Wavell promised his assistance in mitigating the danger. The campaign plan was altered to position allied forces further south, away from the plains of Macedonia and the <a href="Vardar">Vardar</a> and <a href="Struma%20River">Struma River</a> basins, where malaria was hyper-endemic and heavy casualties had been suffered from malaria by British troops during the First World War.

Fairley tackled an outbreak of bacilliary dysentery among the troops in Egypt. In most cases the patients recovered of their own accord but some cases of <a href="shigellosis">shigellosis</a> became seriously ill and died. Fairley had some Shiga anti-toxin with him, but it proved ineffective in serious cases, even when administered in large doses. However, he also had an experimental supply of <a href="sulphaguanidine">sulphaguanidine</a> that had been given to him by Dr E. K. Marshall of <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital">Johns Hopkins Hospital</a>. The drug was administered to a patient with severe shigellosis who was not expected to live, and the patient soon recovered. Of the 21,015 Australian soldiers who contracted bacilliary dysentery during the Second World War, only 21 died.

Malaria again became a concern in the <a href="Syria-Lebanon%20Campaign">Syria-Lebanon Campaign</a>. The Australian Army raised malaria control units for the first time and as soon as the operational situation permitted swamps and areas of open water were drained and mosquito breeding areas were sprayed. There were 2,435 cases of malaria in the AIF in 1941, a rate of 31.8 per thousand per year. <a href="Quinine">Quinine</a> was used as a <a href="prophylaxis">prophylaxis</a>. On Fairley's advice, patients with relapses were treated with intravenous quinine for three days followed by a course of <a href="atebrin">atebrin</a> and <a href="plasmoquine">plasmoquine</a>. For his services in the Middle East, Fairley was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> a second time, and made a Commander of the Military Division <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> for his "immense and specialised knowledge of tropical diseases in the Middle East".

With the entry of <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japan</a> into the war, Fairley flew to <a href="Java">Java</a> in January 1942. Fairley was well aware that Java produced 90% of the world's supply of quinine and that the implications would be serious if Java was lost. He arranged for the purchase of all available stocks of quinine, some . Fairley was informed that the quinine had been loaded on board two ships. One was never seen again. The other, the SS "Klang", reached <a href="Fremantle%2C%20Western%20Australia">Fremantle</a> in March. Although of quinine was loaded on board, it was apparently unloaded when the ship stopped at <a href="Tjilatjap">Tjilatjap</a>, possibly due to <a href="fifth%20column">fifth column</a>ists. Thus, none of the shipment reached Australia. Fairley himself departed Java with the <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">I Corps</a> staff on the transport "Orcades" on 21 February 1942 shortly before Java fell.

In General <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Sir Thomas Blamey</a>'s reorganisation of the Australian Army in April 1942, Fairley was appointed director of medicine at <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">Allied Land Forces</a> Headquarters (LHQ) in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. Fairley was soon facing a series of medical emergencies caused by the <a href="Kokoda%20Track%20campaign">Kokoda Track campaign</a>. An epidemic of bacillary dysentery was headed off by Fairley's decision to rush all available supplies of sulphaguanadine to New Guinea. On Fairley's advice every man who complained of diarrhoea was given the drug and the epidemic was brought under control in ten days.
But Fairley's main concern was malaria. Despite the experience with malaria in the Middle East, most of the troops had a poor understanding of anti-malaria precautions and few medical officers had encountered the disease. In combination with critical shortages of drugs and anti-malarial supplies such as netting, insecticides and repellents, the result was a medical disaster. In the 13-week period from 31 October 1942 to 1 January 1943, the Army reported 4,137 battle casualties, but 14,011 casualties from tropical diseases, of which 12,240 were from malaria. The government grimly contemplated disbanding divisions to replace malaria casualties. "Our worst enemy in New Guinea," General Blamey declared, "is not the Nip—it’s the bite."

This caused Blamey to despatch a medical mission headed by Fairley to the United States and the United Kingdom in September 1942 to present the Army's case for a more adequate and equitable share of anti-malarial supplies. The mission was successful. Fairley was able to secure supplies and expedite the delivery of those that were already on order but held up for lack of shipping or priority. In bringing the problem to the attention of the highest allied military and civil authorities overseas, he lifted the global profile and priority of malaria control measures.

It was calculated that Allied requirements for atebrin would be per annum, of which would be manufactured in the United Kingdom and in the United States. American production in 1942 was estimated at 60 tons but efforts were soon under way to increase production. The possibility of producing atebrin in Australia was considered, but the drug was complicated to synthesise and required little shipping space, although steps were taken to produce mosquito repellent. As in the Middle East, the Army relied on a combination of quinine, atebrin and plasmoquine (QAP) to cure malaria. The United States and United Kingdom agreed to each produce two tons of plasmoquine each per annum. The requested drugs and supplies began arriving in December 1942.

As "one of the reasons for the lamentable record in malaria control in 1942 and early 1943 was the absence of medical authority at the level of the theatre commander's headquarters", Fairley suggested that there be a body responsible for co-ordinating the activities of all allied forces in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific Area</a>. General Blamey took the matter up with the General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>, the Supreme Commander. MacArthur, who had himself suffered an attack of malaria back in 1904 (and a serious relapse the next year), created the Combined Advisory Committee on Tropical Medicine, Hygiene and Sanitation with Colonel Fairley as its chairman in March 1943. After its first meeting, Fairley met with MacArthur, who emphasised that he did not wish the committee to concern itself with matters of academic interest but to make concrete recommendations on essential medical matters. The committee proceeded to make a series of recommendations regarding training, discipline, equipment, procedures and priorities, which then went out as GHQ orders to all commands.

Fairley's proposed use of atebrin as a prophylactic agent was accepted and Fairley switched the Australian Army over to using atebrin as a prophylaxis instead of quinine in March 1943. The most acute problem at this time was a shortage of atebrin. The Australian Army had only seven weeks' stock was on hand in March 1943 and US forces in both the South West Pacific and <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20Areas%20%28command%29">South Pacific Area</a> were drawing on Australian Army stocks as they had not yet received adequate stocks of their own. The drug is also a dye, and had the known side effect of making the skin and eyeballs of the user go yellow in colour after repeated use but this was an acceptable drawback in wartime. Prolonged use could cause <a href="lichen%20planus">lichen planus</a> and <a href="psychosis">psychosis</a> in rare cases, but atebrin still turned out to be much safer than quinine. <a href="Blackwater%20fever">Blackwater fever</a>—which had a mortality rate of 25%—disappeared entirely.

Fairley was acutely aware that much remained unknown about malaria. In particular, he was interested in the possibility that sulphaguanidine (or a related <a href="sulfonamide%20%28medicine%29">sulphonamide</a>) might be a causal prophylactic against malaria, as they could be manufactured in Australia, unlike atebrin and plasmoquine. Fairley decided to establish a unit in <a href="Cairns">Cairns</a> to investigate malaria. The LHQ Medical Research Unit commenced work in June 1943.

Fairley travelled to New Guinea at the end of June 1943 and arranged for "<a href="Plasmodium%20falciparum">Plasmodium falciparum</a>" cases to be evacuated to Cairns for treatment. As the flight time from Port Moresby to Cairns was only a few hours, this was considered safe, but since the disease can be fatal if not treated promptly, Fairley was concerned lest the cases be delayed for some reason. Movement Control suggested that a special priority be allocated to such cases, and Major General <a href="Frank%20Berryman">Frank Berryman</a> suggested calling it priority Neil after Fairley himself. Because movement priorities had to have five letters, an extra L was added on the end. Priority Neill soon came to be applied to the entire Cairns project.

The LHQ Medical Research Unit used <a href="Human%20subject%20research">human test subjects</a>, all volunteers drawn from the Australian Army, including a small but notable group of '<a href="HMT%20Dunera">Dunera Boys</a>' (<a href="Jewish%20refugees">Jewish refugees</a>) from the 8th Employment Company. The volunteers were infected with strains of malaria from infected mosquitoes, or from the blood of other test subjects, which was then treated with various drugs. The volunteers were rewarded with three weeks' leave and a certificate of appreciation signed by General Blamey. The LHQ Medical Research Unit researched <a href="quinine">quinine</a>, <a href="sulfonamide%20%28medicine%29">sulphonamides</a>, <a href="Quinacrine">atebrin</a>, <a href="chloroquine">plasmoquine</a>, and <a href="Proguanil">paludrine</a>.

In June 1944, a conference was held at <a href="Atherton%2C%20Queensland">Atherton, Queensland</a> on "Prevention of Disease in Warfare". Chaired by <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Vernon%20Sturdee">Vernon Sturdee</a>, the commander of the <a href="First%20Army%20%28Australia%29">First Army</a>, it was attended by key corps and division commanders. Fairley, who had been promoted to brigadier in February 1944, described the results of the work at Cairns on anti-malarial drugs; other officers described practical measures that could be taken to reduce the toll of disease on the men. The Director General of Medical Services, Major General <a href="Samuel%20Burston">S. R. (Ginger) Burston</a>, told the senior commanders "the ball is in your court".

Using draconian drills that required officers to place atebrin tablets in their men's mouths, the army attempted to reduce the incidence of malaria to zero. For the most part they were successful but in the <a href="Aitape-Wewak%20campaign">Aitape-Wewak campaign</a> the <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th Division</a> suffered an epidemic of malaria despite its best efforts. Fairley was urgently recalled from a tour of <a href="South%20East%20Asia%20Command">South East Asia Command</a> and given orders by General Blamey to personally proceed to Wewak and investigate the situation. A special section was formed from the LHQ Medical Research Unit to assist the 6th Division and certain relapsing personnel were evacuated to Cairns. The epidemic was ultimately brought under control by doubling the dosage of atebrin. Fairley was forced to confront the fact—confirmed by research at Cairns—that an atebrin resistant strain of malaria had arisen. The ability of malaria to develop resistant strains would have profound implications in the post-war world.

After the war Australian medical research was substantially reorganised, but Fairley joined the ranks of senior Australian medical scientists who spent the remainder of their professional lives in Britain. In London he became consulting physician to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Wellcome Professor of Tropical Medicine at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. His early post war research was a continuation of his wartime work on malaria. He became seriously ill in 1948 and his health steadily declined thereafter, forcing him to resign his professorship. He retained his practice and membership of numerous committees, becoming an "elder statesman" of tropical medicine. In recognition of his service to tropical medicine, he was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 8 June 1950.

Fairley's declining health prompted him to leave London and move to The Grove, <a href="Sonning">Sonning</a>, Berkshire, where he died on 19 April 1966, and was buried in the graveyard of <a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20Church%2C%20Sonning">St Andrew's Church, Sonning</a>. He was survived by his wife and their two sons, who were both medical doctors, and also by the son of his first marriage, who had become an Australian Army officer. His son <a href="Gordon%20Hamilton-Fairley">Gordon Hamilton-Fairley</a>, a renowned <a href="oncology">oncologist</a>, was killed by a <a href="Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army">Provisional Irish Republican Army</a> bomb on 22 October 1975.

<a href="William%20Dargie">Sir William Dargie</a> painted a portrait of Fairley in 1943, which is in the possession the Fairley family. A later 1960 portrait by Dargie, together with a 1945 one by <a href="Nora%20Heysen">Nora Heysen</a>, is in the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a>. Neither is on display, although the latter can be viewed online. A 1954 Dargie portrait of <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> painted while Dargie was staying at Fairley's home at 81 <a href="Duke%20Street%2C%20Marylebone">Duke Street</a>, <a href="Grosvenor%20Square">Grosvenor Square</a>, in London, and subsequently given to Fairley, was sold at auction to the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Australia">National Museum of Australia</a> in 2009 for $120,000. Fairley's papers are in the <a href="Basser%20Library">Basser Library</a> at the <a href="Australian%20Academy%20of%20Science">Australian Academy of Science</a>. He is commemorated by the Neil Hamilton Fairley Overseas Clinical Fellowship, which provides full-time training in Australia and overseas in areas of clinical research including the social and behavioural sciences.

William T. Stearn

William Thomas Stearn (16 April 1911 – 9 May 2001) was a British <a href="botanist">botanist</a>. Born in <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> in 1911, he was largely <a href="self-educated">self-educated</a>, and developed an early interest in books and <a href="natural%20history">natural history</a>. His initial work experience was at a Cambridge bookshop, but he also had a position as an assistant in the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Botanic%20Garden">university botany department</a>. At the age of 29 he married Eldwyth Ruth Alford, who later became his collaborator. He died in London in 2001, survived by his widow and three children.

While at the bookshop, he was offered a position as a <a href="librarian">librarian</a> at the <a href="Royal%20Horticultural%20Society">Royal Horticultural Society</a> in London (1933–1952). From there he moved to the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a> as a scientific officer in the botany department (1952–1976). After his retirement, he continued working there, writing, and serving on a number of professional bodies related to his work, including the <a href="Linnean%20Society">Linnean Society</a>, of which he became president. He also taught botany at <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a> as a visiting professor (1977–1983).

Stearn is known for his work in <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">botanical taxonomy</a> and <a href="botanical%20history">botanical history</a>, particularly classical botanical literature, <a href="botanical%20illustration">botanical illustration</a> and for his studies of the Swedish scientist <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>. His best known books are his "Dictionary of Plant Names for Gardeners", a popular guide to the <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">scientific names</a> of plants, and his "Botanical Latin" for scientists.

Stearn received many honours for his work, at home and abroad, and was made a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in 1997. Considered one of the most eminent British botanists of his time, he is remembered by an essay prize in his name from the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20History%20of%20Natural%20History">Society for the History of Natural History</a>, and a named <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a> of "<a href="Epimedium">Epimedium</a>", one of many <a href="genera">genera</a> he produced <a href="monographs">monographs</a> on. He is the <a href="botanical%20authority">botanical authority</a> for over 400 plants that he named and described.
William Thomas Stearn was born at 37 Springfield Road, <a href="Chesterton%2C%20Cambridge">Chesterton, Cambridge</a>, England, on 16 April 1911, the eldest of four sons, to Thomas Stearn (1871 or 1872–1922) and Ellen ("Nellie") Kiddy (1886–1986) of <a href="West%20Suffolk%20%28county%29">West Suffolk</a>. His father worked as a coachman to a Cambridge doctor. Chesterton was then a village on the north bank of the <a href="River%20Cam">River Cam</a>, about two miles north of Cambridge's city centre, where Springfield Road ran parallel to <a href="A1309%20road">Milton Road</a> to the west. William Stearn's early education was at the nearby Milton Road Junior Council School ("see <a href="%23MJRS">image</a>"). Despite not having any family background in science (though he recalled that his grandfather was the university rat-catcher) he developed a keen interest in <a href="natural%20history">natural history</a> and books at an early age. He spent his school holidays on his uncle's Suffolk farm, tending cows grazing by the roadside where he would observe the <a href="wild%20flowers">wild flowers</a> of the <a href="hedgerows">hedgerows</a> and fields. Stearn's father died suddenly in 1922 when Stearn was only eleven, leaving his working-class family in financial difficulties as his widow (Stearn's mother) had no pension.

That year, William Stearn succeeded in obtaining a scholarship to the local <a href="Cambridge%20High%20School%20for%20Boys">Cambridge High School for Boys</a> on <a href="Hills%20Road">Hills Road</a>, close to the <a href="Cambridge%20Botanic%20Garden">Cambridge Botanic Garden</a>, which he attended for eight years till he was 18. The school had an excellent reputation for biology education, and while he was there, he was encouraged by Mr Eastwood, a biology teacher who recognised his talents. The school also provided him with a thorough education in both <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a>. He became secretary of the school's Natural History Society, won an essay prize from the <a href="Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Birds">Royal Society for the Protection of Birds</a> and spent much of his time at the Botanic Garden. Stearn also gained horticultural experience by working as a gardener's boy during his school holidays, to supplement the family income.

Stearn attended evening lectures on <a href="paleobotany">paleobotany</a> given by <a href="Albert%20Seward">Albert Seward</a> (<a href="Regius%20Professor%20of%20Botany%20%28Cambridge%29">chair of botany</a> at <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a> 1906–1936), and <a href="Harry%20Godwin">Harry Godwin</a>. Seward was impressed by the young Stearn, giving him access to the <a href="herbarium">herbarium</a> of the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Department%20of%20Botany">Botany School</a> (now Department of Plant Sciences—"see <a href="%231904image">1904 photograph</a>") and allowing him to work there as a part-time research assistant. Later, Seward also gave Stearn access to the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Library">Cambridge University Library</a> to pursue his research.

Stearn was largely self-educated and his widowed mother worked hard to support him while at school but could not afford a university education for him, there being no <a href="grants">grants</a> available then. When not at the Botany School, he attended evening classes to develop linguistic and <a href="bibliographic">bibliographic</a> skills. His classes there included German and <a href="the%20classics">the classics</a>. He obtained his first employment at the age of 18 in 1929, a time of high unemployment, to support himself and his family. He worked as an apprentice antiquarian bookseller and cataloguer in the second-hand section at <a href="Bowes%20%26amp%3B%20Bowes">Bowes & Bowes</a> bookshop, 1 <a href="Trinity%20Street%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity Street</a> (now <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Press">Cambridge University Press</a>), between 1929 and 1933 where he was able to pursue his passion for bibliography. During his employment there, he spent much of his lunchtimes, evenings and weekends, at the Botany School and Botanic Garden. This was at a time when botany was thriving at Cambridge under the leadership of Seward and <a href="Humphrey%20Gilbert-Carter">Humphrey Gilbert-Carter</a>.

On 3 August 1940, he married Eldwyth Ruth Alford (1910–2013), by whom he had a son and two daughters, and who collaborated with him in much of his work. Ruth Alford was a secondary school teacher from <a href="Tavistock">Tavistock</a>, Devon, the daughter of Roger Rice Alford a <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> preacher and mayor of Tavistock. When their engagement was announced in "The Times", Stearn was vastly amused to see that he was described as a "Fellow of the Linen Society", a <a href="typographical%20error">typographical error</a> for <a href="Linnean%20Society">Linnean Society</a>. Stearn was brought up an <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a>, but was a <a href="conscientious%20objector">conscientious objector</a> and after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> he became a <a href="Quakers">Quaker</a>. In his later years, following official retirement in 1976 he continued to live in <a href="Kew">Kew</a>, <a href="Richmond%2C%20London">Richmond</a>. His entry in "<a href="Who%27s%20Who%20%28UK%29">Who's Who</a>" lists his interests as "gardening and talking". He died on 9 May 2001 of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> at <a href="Kingston%20Hospital">Kingston Hospital</a>, Kingston upon Thames, at the age of 90. His funeral took place on 18 May at <a href="Mortlake">Mortlake</a> crematorium. He was survived by his widow and three children (Roger Thomas Stearn, Margaret Ruth Stearn and Helen Elizabeth Stearn) leaving an estate of £461,240. His wife, whose 100th birthday was celebrated at the Linnean Society in 2010, lived to the age of 103.

Professor Stearn had a reputation for his encyclopedic knowledge, geniality, wit and generosity with his time and knowledge, being always willing to contribute to the work of others. He had a mischievous sense of fun and was famous for his anecdotes while lecturing, while his colleagues recalled that "he had a happy genius for friendship". He was described as having a striking figure, "a small man, his pink face topped with a thatch of white hair", and earned the nickname of "Wumpty" after his signature of "Wm. T. Stearn".

While working at the bookshop he made many friends among the Cambridge botanists and participated in their activities, including botanical excursions. In addition to Professor Seward, those influencing him included the <a href="morphologist">morphologist</a> <a href="Agnes%20Arber">Agnes Arber</a>, Humphrey Gilbert-Carter the first <a href="Director%2C%20Cambridge%20University%20Botanic%20Garden">scientific director of the Botanic Garden</a>, <a href="John%20Gilmour%20%28botanist%29">John Gilmour</a> then curator of the university <a href="herbarium">herbarium</a> and later director of the Garden (1951–1973), the horticulturalist <a href="Edward%20Augustus%20Bowles">E. A. Bowles</a> (1865–1954), who became his patron, <a href="Harry%20Godwin">Harry Godwin</a>, then a research fellow and later professor and <a href="Tom%20Tutin">Tom Tutin</a> who was working with Seward at that time. Seward gave him full research facilities in the herbarium. He continued his research, visiting the <a href="Royal%20Botanical%20Gardens%2C%20Kew">Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew</a>, in 1930, at the age of 19, and also spent two weeks at the herbarium of the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20National%20d%27Histoire%20Naturelle">Musée National d'Histoire Naturelle</a>, Paris, with the aid of a £15 grant from the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> to study "<a href="Epimedium">Epimedium</a>". Also in 1930, the Fifth <a href="International%20Botanical%20Congress">International Botanical Congress</a> was held at Cambridge, and Stearn was able to attend. During this time he commuted between the bookshop, the Botany School, Botanic Garden and home by bicycle, his preferred means of transportation throughout his life.

In 1933, H. R. Hutchinson, who was the Librarian at the <a href="Lindley%20Library">Lindley Library</a>, <a href="Royal%20Horticultural%20Society">Royal Horticultural Society</a>'s (RHS) in London, was due to retire. John Gilmour, now assistant director at the <a href="Kew%20Gardens">Kew Gardens</a>, put forward Stearn's name, together with Bowles, a vice-president of the Society, who had discovered Stearn at the bookshop. Stearn was 22 when he began work at the library, initially as assistant librarian, before taking over Hutchinson's position after six months. He later explained his appointment at such a young age as being the result of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>: "All the people who should have had those jobs were dead." There he collaborated with Bowles on a number of plant <a href="monographs">monographs</a>, such as Bowles' "Handbook of Crocus" and their work on "<a href="Anemone%20japonica">Anemone japonica</a>" ("Anemone hupehensis" var. "japonica"). Written in 1947, it is still considered one of the most comprehensive accounts of the origins and nomenclature of fall-blooming <a href="anemones">anemones</a>. Stearn was one of the last people to see Bowles alive, and when Bowles died, Stearn wrote an appreciation of him, and later contributed the entry on Bowles to the <a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>. Much of his spare time was spent studying at the Kew Gardens.

The Lindley Library, the largest horticultural library in the world and named after the British botanist <a href="John%20Lindley">John Lindley</a> (1799–1865), was established in 1868 by the acquisition of Lindley's 1,300 volumes upon his death. It had recently undergone considerable change. In 1930, the library had been rehoused in a new floor added to the society's <a href="Vincent%20Square">Vincent Square</a> headquarters, but the role of the library was somewhat downgraded. <a href="Frederick%20Chittenden">Frederick Chittenden</a> had been appointed as Keeper of the Library (1930–1939), and Hutchinson reported directly to him. Stearn related that when he reported for duty, Hutchinson was completely unaware of the appointment of his new assistant.

Lindley was one of Stearn's inspirations, also being a librarian who had a long association with the RHS. Lindley also <a href="bequeathed">bequeathed</a> his herbarium to the Cambridge University Herbarium, where it now forms the Lindley Collection. As Stearn remarked "I came to know his numerous publications and to admire the industry, tenacity and ability with which he undertook successfully so many different things". Later Stearn would publish a major work on Lindley's life and work. Lindley's contributions to horticultural taxonomy were matched only by those of Stearn himself. Stearn soon set about using his antiquarian knowledge to reorganise the library, forming a pre-Linnean section. Not long after his arrival the library acquired one of its largest collections, the <a href="Reginald%20Cory">Reginald Cory</a> Bequest (1934), which Stearn set about cataloguing on its arrival two years later, resulting in at least fifteen publications.

While at the library he continued his self-education through evening classes, learning Swedish, and travelling widely. Stearn used his three-week annual leaves in the pre-war years to visit other European botanical libraries, botanic gardens, museums, herbaria and collections, as well as collecting plants, with special emphasis on "<a href="Epimedium">Epimedium</a>" and "<a href="Allium">Allium</a>". His travels took him to Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, and Sweden.

The only break from this employment was the <a href="World%20War%20II">war years</a> 1941–1946, leaving his assistant Ms. Cardew as acting librarian. Initially Stearn served as an <a href="air%20raid%20warden">air raid warden</a>, before <a href="enlisting">enlisting</a>. As a <a href="conscientious%20objector">conscientious objector</a>, he could not serve in a <a href="combatant">combatant</a> role, but was accepted into the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) <a href="RAF%20Medical%20Services">Medical Services</a>, as he had previously worked with the <a href="St%20John%20Ambulance%20Brigade">St John Ambulance Brigade</a>. He served in the RAF in both England, and Asia (India and Burma, where he worked in <a href="military%20intelligence">intelligence</a>, and was awarded the <a href="Burma%20Star">Burma Star</a>). While there he undertook studies of <a href="Indo-Malayan">Indo-Malayan</a> and <a href="Sikkim">Sikkim</a>-<a href="Himalaya">Himalaya</a>n tropical vegetation, carried out <a href="botanical%20explorations">botanical explorations</a>, taught biology to troops and began work on his "Botanical Latin". His wartime observations led to collaborative publications such as "An enumeration of the flowering plants of Nepal" (1978–1982), "Beautiful Indian Trees" (2nd ed. 1954), as well as works on <a href="Himalayas">Himalayan</a> species of "Allium". On returning from the war, Stearn and his new wife, Eldwyth Ruth Stearn, were obliged to live in the Lindley Library for a while till they found a more permanent home, due to the acute housing shortage in London.

From the Lindley Library, Stearn ("see <a href="%231950Image">1950 Photograph</a>") moved to the Botany Department at the <a href="British%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Natural History Museum</a>, <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a> in 1952, and by the time he retired in 1976, he was the Senior Principal Scientific Officer there. He had now achieved his aim of becoming a research scientist, despite lack of formal qualifications, enabling him to spend more of his time collecting and studying plants. During this time the museum was undergoing steady expansion, with new staff and programmes. At the museum he was put in charge of Section 3 of the General Herbarium (the last third of the <a href="Dicotyledons">Dicotyledons</a> in the <a href="Bentham%20%26amp%3B%20Hooker%20system">Bentham & Hooker system</a>, i.e., <a href="Monochlamydae">Monochlamydae</a>) and <a href="floristic">floristic</a> treatment of the regions of Europe, Jamaica, the United States, Australia and Nepal, including work on the museum's "Flora of Jamaica" and the Nepal flora he started work on during the war. Seven volumes of the "Flora of Jamaica" had appeared prior to the Second World War. Although the project was revived after the war, and Stearn carried out six months of <a href="field%20work">field work</a> in Jamaica, it never came to fruition; no further volumes appeared. In Jamaica, Stearn followed in the footsteps of Sir <a href="Hans%20Sloane">Hans Sloane</a> (1660–1753), whose collection had been left to the Natural History Museum. Stearn's generic work at the museum concentrated on "Allium", "<a href="Lilium">Lilium</a>" and "<a href="Peony">Paeonia</a>". He continued to travel widely, with field work in Europe (particularly Greece), Australia, and the United States, and published 200 papers during his twenty-four years at the museum, and although the library was not his responsibility, he spent much time there adding written notes to many of the critical texts.

While at the museum, Stearn became increasingly involved in the work of the <a href="Linnean%20Society">Linnean Society</a> during his Kensington years. He was also offered the George A. Miller professorship of botany at the <a href="University%20of%20Illinois">University of Illinois</a> (1966), but felt he would be unable to leave his commitments in London. At the time of his retirement in 1976, he was still using a <a href="fountain%20pen">fountain pen</a> as his only means of communication and scholarship, a fact commemorated by his retirement present of a <a href="Montblanc%20%28company%29">Mont Blanc pen</a> capable of writing for long periods without refills.

Following his retirement on 30 November 1976 he continued to work, both at the museum and at the <a href="Royal%20Botanical%20Gardens%2C%20Kew">Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew</a>, where his home at 17 High Park Road, Kew Gardens, <a href="Richmond%2C%20London">Richmond</a> ("see <a href="%2317HPR">image</a>"), gave him access to the herbarium and library, a short bicycle trip away. Indeed, 35 percent of his total publications appeared in the quarter century of his retirement. He was commissioned to write a history of the museum for its centenary (1981), although he did so with some difficulty, due to deadlines and budget constraints. The task, which took three years, was made more difficult for him by the museum's decision to censor his critical comments. He continued his association with the Lindley Library all his life, being an active committee member and regularly attended <a href="Chelsea%20Flower%20Show">RHS flower shows</a> even after he was barely able to walk.

As a student of the classics he was passionate about <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, its mountains and plants (such as "Paeonia") and all things Greek, both ancient and modern. The Stearns had formed a friendship with <a href="Constantine%20Goulimis">Constantine Goulimis</a> and <a href="Niki%20Goulandris">Niki</a> and Angelos Goulandris, founders of the <a href="Goulandris%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Goulandris Museum of Natural History</a> in <a href="Kifissia">Kifissia</a>, Athens. Stearn first met the Goulandris' in 1967, and offered practical help with their museum. He also stayed with them when he and his wife visited Greece. Niki Goulandris illustrated both "Wild Flowers of Greece" that Goulimis and Stearn wrote in 1968, as well as his "Peonies of Greece" (1984). The latter work typified Stearn's encyclopedic approach, including topics such as mythology and herbalism in addition to taxonomy. Stearn then took on the editorship of "Annales Musei Goulandris", the scientific journal of the museum (1976–1999), succeeding <a href="Werner%20Greuter">Werner Greuter</a>, the first editor, having been instrumental in getting the journal launched in 1973. Eldwyth Ruth Stearn took on the job of compiling the indexes. When he retired from this position he was 88, and was succeeded by John Akeroyd. He was a liberal contributor to the journal, and during this time he and Eldwyth Ruth Stearn undertook their translation of "The Greek Plant World in Myth, Art, and Literature" (1993).

Stearn was a member of the Linnean Society for many years, becoming a fellow as early as 1934. He served as botanical curator 1959–1985, council member 1959–1963 and as vice-president 1961–1962 and president 1979–1982, producing a revised and updated history of the society in 1988. He also served as president of the <a href="Garden%20History%20Society">Garden History Society</a> and the <a href="Ray%20Society">Ray Society</a> (1975–1977). The Royal Horticultural Society had made him an honorary fellow in 1946 and in 1986 he became a vice-president. Stearn became a member of the <a href="Botanical%20Society%20of%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland</a> (BSBI) in 1954, joining the Maps Committee the following year to prepare their "<a href="Atlas%20of%20the%20British%20Flora">Atlas of the British Flora</a>" (1962). He remained on that committee till 1968, when it became the Records Committee. For 40 years he was the BSBI referee for "Allium". While at the Lindley Library, he became a founding member of the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Bibliography%20of%20Natural%20History">Society for the Bibliography of Natural History</a> (later, the Society for the History of Natural History) in 1936, was one of its most active publishing members based on his cataloguing work at the library, and published a history of the society for their 50th anniversary in 1986. Other societies on which he served include the <a href="British%20Society%20for%20the%20History%20of%20Science">British Society for the History of Science</a> (vice-president), the <a href="British%20Society%20for%20the%20History%20of%20Medicine">British Society for the History of Medicine</a> (Council), the <a href="Garden%20History%20Society">Garden History Society</a> (president 1977–1982) and was a corresponding member of the <a href="Botanical%20Society%20of%20America">Botanical Society of America</a>.

Stearn was appointed Sandars Reader in Bibliography, University of Cambridge in 1965 and from 1977 to 1983 he was visiting professor at Cambridge University's Department of Botany, and also Visiting Professor in Botany at <a href="Reading%20University">Reading University</a> 1977–1983, and then Honorary Research Fellow (1983–). He was also a fellow of the <a href="Institute%20of%20Biology">Institute of Biology</a> (1967) and honorary fellow, <a href="Sidney%20Sussex%20College">Sidney Sussex College</a>, Cambridge.

William Stearn was the author of nearly 500 publications, including his autobiography. These included monographs, partial floras, books on botanical illustration, scholarly editions of historical botanical texts, dictionaries, bibliographies and botanical histories.

During Stearn's initial four years in Cambridge (1929–1933), he published twenty-four papers, predominantly in the "<a href="Gardeners%27%20Chronicle">Gardeners' Chronicle" and "Gardening Illustrated</a>" and the "<a href="Journal%20of%20Botany%2C%20British%20and%20Foreign">Journal of Botany</a>", his first in 1929. While working as a gardener's boy during school holidays he had observed a specimen of "Campanula pusilla" ("<a href="Campanula%20cochleariifolia">Campanula cochleariifolia</a>") with a distorted <a href="Petal">corolla</a>. He then described and published the first appearance of the causative agent, the <a href="mould">mould</a> "<a href="Peronospora">Peronospora corollaea</a>", in Britain, using the facilities of the Botany library.

At the Botanic Garden he developed a special interest in "<a href="Vinca">Vinca</a>", "Epimedium", "<a href="Hosta">Hosta</a>" and "<a href="Symphytum">Symphytum</a>", all of which he published monographs on. A series of botanical publications followed, starting with a new species of "<a href="Allium">Allium</a>" ("<a href="Allium%20cyathophorum">A. farreri</a>" Stearn, 1930). Stearn repeatedly returned to the genus "Allium", and was considered a world expert on it; many species bear his name. 1930 would also see his first bibliographic work, on the botanist <a href="Reginald%20Farrer">Reginald Farrer</a>, whom he named "Allium farreri" after, and also described "<a href="Rose">Rosa farreri</a>" (1933) and other species named after Farrer. It was while he was compiling Farrer's works in 1930 that he came across the latter's work, "The English Rock-Garden" (1919) and its account of Barren-worts ("Epimedium"), and kindled a lifetime interest in the <a href="genus">genus</a>. From 1932, he produced a series of papers on this genus, studying it at Cambridge, Kew and Paris. It became one of the genera which he was best known, and many <a href="species">species</a> of which now bear his name. "Epimedium" and the related <a href="woodland">woodland</a> <a href="perennial">perennial</a> "<a href="Vancouveria">Vancouveria</a>" (<a href="Berberidaceae">Berberidaceae</a>) would be the subject of his first <a href="monograph">monograph</a> (1938) and were genera to which he would return at the end of his life. At the time the taxonomy of this genus was very confused, and with the help of the Cambridge Herbarium he obtained specimens from all over Europe to produce a comprehensive monograph. The work was so thorough that it was mistakenly considered a doctoral thesis by other botanists. He also began a series of contributions to the catalogue of the Herbarium, together with Gilmour and Tutin.

After moving to London, Stearn produced a steady output of publications during his years at the Royal Horticultural Society's Lindley Library (1933–1952). These covered a wide range of topics from bibliography to plant nomenclature, taxonomy and garden plants, with a particular emphasis on "Vinca", "Epimedium" and "<a href="Lilium">Lilium</a>". Within two years of joining the library in 1933, he had produced his first major monograph, "Lilies" (1935), in collaboration with <a href="Drysdale%20Woodcock">Drysdale Woodcock</a> and John Coutts. This text, in an expanded and revised edition, as Woodcock and Stearn's "Lilies of the World" (1950) became a standard work on the <a href="Liliaceae">Liliaceae</a> "<a href="sensu%20lato">sensu lato</a>". While at the library he also continued his collaboration with his Cambridge colleagues, publishing catalogues of the Herbarium collections, including the "Catalogue of the Collections of the Herbarium of the University Botany School, Cambridge" (1935). The second task imposed on him at this time involved the RHS role in maintaining revision of the <a href="Code%20of%20Botanical%20Nomenclature">Code of Botanical Nomenclature</a> ("see" <a href="%23Botanical%20taxonomy">Botanical taxonomy</a>).

After his return to London in 1946, at the end of the Second World War, a number of major publications ensued, including "Lilies of the World" in 1950. The RHS also imposed two major tasks on their librarian. In 1950, <a href="Frederick%20Chittenden">Frederick Chittenden</a>, a previous director of RHS <a href="Wisley%20Garden">Wisley</a> and Keeper of the Library, died leaving unfinished the four volume RHS "Dictionary of Gardening" that the society had commissioned from him before the war. The war had interrupted the work as many of the expected contributors were unavailable. Stearn, together with <a href="Patrick%20Synge">Patrick Synge</a>, the RHS Publications Editor, undertook to complete the work, particularly volume IV (R–Z), a task he completed within six months, with 50 new articles. The finished work was published in 1951 and not only did he undertake the role of editing this large work but his contributions covered 50 genera, 600 species and complex identification keys such as "<a href="Solidago">Solidago</a>" and "<a href="Viola%20%28plant%29">Viola</a>". Since Stearn's entries in volume IV extended from "<a href="Soldanella">Soldanella</a>" to "<a href="Zygotritonia">Zygotritonia</a>", he would jest that he was but "a peculiar authority on plants from 'So-' onwards". He issued a revised version in 1956 with Synge in which he added a further 86 articles. His recollection of this task was that he acquired "that occupational hazard of compilers of encyclopaedias", encyclopedic knowledge.

Many of Stearn's collaborative works used his bibliographic skills. While his genus monographs largely concentrated on <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> <a href="flora">flora</a>, notably "Epimedium", "Allium" and "<a href="Peony">Paeonia</a>", he was also the author of species articles both popular and technical as well as a number of classical treatises. In addition he produced <a href="floristic">floristic</a> treatments of a number of regions such as Jamaica and <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>. He also contributed to many national <a href="flora%20%28publication%29">Florae</a> as diverse as <a href="Bhutan">Bhutan</a> and Greece, as well as major regional florae including the "<a href="Flora%20Europaea">Flora Europaea</a>" and "European Garden Flora".

While his output covered a wide range of topics, he is best known for his contributions to <a href="botanical%20history">botanical history</a>, <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a>, botanical bibliography, and botanical illustration. "Botanical Latin" (four editions 1966–1992), is his best known work, having become a standard reference and described as both the bible of plant <a href="taxonomists">taxonomists</a> and a <a href="philological">philological</a> masterwork. It was begun during the war years and the first edition was basically a guide to Latin for botanists with no or limited knowledge of the language, which he described as a "do-it-yourself Latin kit" for taxonomists. Later, the work evolved into an <a href="etymological">etymological</a> dictionary, but then Stearn learned that such a work had already been published in the Netherlands before the war. He then continued to expand it with the assistance of his wife and son, systematically collecting botanical terms from botanical texts. It is said that only he could have written this work, which explains not just the derivation of plant names but also the philological principles involved in forming those names. The work is considered responsible for the continued survival of Latin as the <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a> of botany. In addition to this seminal text, he frequently delighted in the illumination that the classics could add to understanding plants and plant lore, such as his "Five Brethren of the Rose" (1965).

His best known popular work is his "Dictionary of Plant Names", which found its way into the libraries of most horticulturalists. One of the focuses of his work at the Natural History Museum was the flora of the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, where he carried out <a href="field%20work">field work</a>. Stearn continued to return to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, cared for his own garden and worked with the RHS to become an authority on horticulture as well as botany. William Stearn collaborated with his wife, Eldwyth Ruth Stearn, on a number of his most important works, including "Botanical Latin" and "Dictionary of Plant Names" and translating German botanical history into English. Just before his death he completed a revision of his original "Epimedium" monograph.

William Stearn wrote extensively on the history of botany and horticulture, from <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greece</a> to his own times. He collected together <a href="J.%20E.%20Raven">J. E. Raven</a>'s 1976 J. H. Gray Lectures, editing and annotating them as "Plants and Plant Lore in Ancient Greece" (1990). In 1993, he and Eldwyth Ruth Stearn translated and expanded Baumann's "Die griechische Pflanzenwelt in Mythos, Kunst und Literatur" (1986) as "The Greek Plant World in Myth, Art, and Literature".

Stearn compiled a major work on the life of John Lindley and produced an edited version of the classic book on <a href="herbals">herbals</a> by <a href="Agnes%20Arber">Agnes Arber</a>, one of the influences of his Cambridge years, and whose obituary he would later write for "The Times". He also wrote a number of histories of the organisations he worked with as well as a number of introductions and commentaries on classic botanical texts such as <a href="John%20Ray">John Ray</a>'s "Synopsis methodica stirpium Britannicarum" (1691), together with historical introductions to reference books, including Desmond's "Dictionary of British and Irish Botanists" (1994).

In his "Botanical Gardens and Botanical Literature in the Eighteenth Century" (1961), Stearn provides some insight into his interpretation of botanical history: The progress of botany, as of other sciences, comes from the interaction of so many factors that undue emphasis on any one can give a very distorted impression of the whole, but certainly among the most important of these for any given period are the prevailing ideas and intellectual attitudes, the assumptions and stimuli of the time, for often upon them depends the extent to which a particular study attracts an unbroken succession of men of industry and originality intent on building a system of knowledge and communicating it successfully to others of like mind.

Stearn's historical research is best known for his work on Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778), which he began while at the Natural History Museum, and which won him a number of awards at home and abroad. Between 1953 and 1994 he produced more than 20 works describing Linnaeus' life and work.

Of Stearn's writings on Linnaeus, the most well known is his edition of the 1753 "<a href="Species%20plantarum">Species plantarum</a>", published in <a href="facsimile">facsimile</a> by the <a href="Ray%20Society">Ray Society</a> in 1957, for which he wrote both a 176-page introduction and an appendix. Concerned that Linnaeus' methods were imperfectly understood by his contemporaries, Stearn wrote that his introduction "provided concisely all the information about his <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a>' life, herbaria, publications, methodology etc. which a botanical taxonomist needs to know". "The Times" stated that no other botanist possessed the historical knowledge and linguistic skills to write, what is considered one of the classic studies of the Swedish naturalist and a highpoint of 20th century botanical scholarship. Subsequently, Stearn became a recognised authority on Linnaeus. Stearn produced similar introductions to a number of other editions of Linnaeus' works, including "<a href="Genera%20Plantarum">Genera Plantarum</a>", "<a href="Mantissa%20plantarum%20altera">Mantissa plantarum</a>" and "". Later, he would produce a <a href="anniversary">bicentenary</a> guide to Linnaeus (1978) for the Linnean Society.

Although Stearn spent much of his life studying and writing about Linnaeus, he did not admire the man's character, describing him as mean—"a jealous egoist, with a driving ambition". When asked which botanists in history he did admire, he cited <a href="John%20Lindley">John Lindley</a>, <a href="Carolus%20Clusius">Carolus Clusius</a> (1526–1609) and <a href="Olof%20Swartz">Olof Swartz</a> (1760–1818).

Stearn made major contributions to <a href="plant%20taxonomy">plant taxonomy</a> and its history. In 1950 the Seventh <a href="International%20Botanical%20Congress">International Botanical Congress</a> was held in Stockholm, and the RHS would have been represented by Chittenden, but he had been taken ill. Bowles then arranged for Stearn and Gilmour to represent the society in his stead. The congress appointed a special committee to consider nomenclatural issues related to cultivated plants, which became known as the Committee for the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants (the "Stockholm Committee"), with Stearn as secretary (1950–1953). Stearn then proposed an <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Nomenclature%20for%20Cultivated%20Plants">International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants</a> (the "Cultivated Code"), producing the first draft that day. The code was accepted in principle by the committee, conditional on its approval by a parallel committee of the <a href="International%20Horticultural%20Congress">International Horticultural Congress</a> (the Horticultural Nomenclature Committee), which would next meet in London in 1952 (the "London Committee"). Later that year Stearn was also appointed secretary of the London Committee so that he now represented both organisations. The two committees then met jointly on 22–24 November 1951 at the RHS building in London to draft a final joint proposal that was published by Stearn as secretary of an editorial committee and adopted by the 13th International Horticultural Congress the following year.

The resulting code was formulated as a supplement to the existing <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Botanical%20Nomenclature">International Code of Botanical Nomenclature</a>. Stearn introduced two important concepts, the terms "<a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>" and "<a href="Grex%20%28horticulture%29">grex</a>". Cultivar, a term first proposed by <a href="L.%20H.%20Bailey">L. H. Bailey</a> in 1923, refers to a distinctive genus or species variety raised or maintained in cultivation, such as "<a href="Euphorbia">Euphorbia dulcis</a>" "Chameleon". Grex (Latin for "<a href="flock%20%28birds%29">flock</a>" or "<a href="herd">herd</a>") refers to a group of hybrids of common parentage, such as "<a href="Lilium">Lilium</a>" Pink Perfection Group. These concepts contributed a similar clarity to the nomenclature of garden or agricultural plants that Linnaeus had brought to the naming of native plants two centuries earlier. Stearn continued to play an active part in the International Botanical Congresses over many years, where he was remembered for his rhetorical persuasion on nomenclatural matters. He was also a pioneer in the application of computer-aided technology to (<a href="numerical%20taxonomy">numerical taxonomy</a>), as in his work on "<a href="Columnea">Columnea</a>" (1969).

Motivated by his interest in botanical history and taxonomy, Stearn devoted a considerable part of his output to botanical bibliography, including numerous papers and catalogues establishing the exact publication dates of books on natural history, particularly from the early nineteenth century, including <a href="William%20Herbert%20%28botanist%29">William Herbert</a>'s work on <a href="Amaryllidaceae">Amaryllidaceae</a> (1821, 1837) and complete bibliographies of botanists such as John Gilmour (1989). At the RHS library he transformed the minimalist card indexing by introducing British Museum rules and adding extensive bibliographic information. He quickly realised that one of the major deficits in contemporary taxonomic nomenclature was a lack of precise dates of all the names, and set about rectifying this over a fifteen-year period, resulting in 86 publications, which was a major step in stabilising nomenclature. The importance of this lay in the rules of <a href="botanical%20nomenclature">botanical nomenclature</a>, which gives <a href="botanical%20names">botanical names</a> priority based on dates of publication. He considered his most important contribution in this regard to be his elucidation of the dating of the early 19th century collection of studies of <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> <a href="flora">flora</a> by <a href="Philip%20Barker-Webb">Webb</a> and <a href="Sabin%20Berthelot">Berthelot</a> (1836–1850). Another important work from this period was on <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Pierre%20Ventenat">Ventenat</a>'s "Jardin de la Malmaison" (1803–1804), also published in the new "<a href="Journal%20of%20the%20Society%20for%20the%20Bibliography%20of%20Natural%20History">Journal of the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History</a>". In a number of instances his contributions to others' work went unacknowledged, particularly when he was younger, even though his introductions (often with the title "Revised and enlarged by W. T. Stearn") could be as lengthy as the texts they preceded. His contributions to botanical bibliography and in particular the correct interpretation of historical texts from Linnaeus to Arber are considered of central importance to the field of taxonomy.

Within a few years after Stearn returned from the war, his "Art of Botanical Illustration" (1950) was published, remaining the standard work on the subject to this day. There was, however, some bibliographic confusion<a href="William%20Collins%2C%20Sons">Collins</a>, the publisher, had planned a book on botanical art for its New Naturalist series, but mistakenly commissioned both Stearn and the <a href="art%20historian">art historian</a> <a href="Wilfrid%20Jasper%20Walter%20Blunt">Wilfred Blunt</a> independently to produce the work. After the error was discovered the two decided to collaborate; Blunt wrote the work while Stearn edited and revised it. When it was published, Blunt's name was on the title page, while Stearn was only acknowledged in the preface. The omission was not rectified till he prepared the second edition in 1994, although the preface reveals Stearn's extensive contribution.

His continuing interest in botanical illustration led him to produce work on both historical and contemporary artists, including the "<a href="Banks%27%20Florilegium">Florilegium</a>" of <a href="Captain%20Cook">Captain Cook</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Joseph Banks</a> from their first voyage to the Pacific on the "<a href="HMS%20Endeavour">Endeavour</a>", the similar account of <a href="Ferdinand%20Bauer">Ferdinand Bauer</a>'s later botanical expedition to Australia with <a href="Matthew%20Flinders">Matthew Flinders</a> on the "<a href="HMS%20Investigator%20%281801%29">Investigator</a>" (1801–1803), and the work of illustrator <a href="Franz%20Bauer">Franz Bauer</a> (the brother of Ferdinand). Stearn's studies of Ferdinand Bauer's "<a href="Flora%20Graeca">Flora Graeca</a>" (1806–1840) enabled him to combine his passion for Greece with that of illustration. Other illustrators of this period that he wrote about included <a href="William%20Hooker%20%28botanical%20illustrator%29">William Hooker</a>.

William Stearn received three honorary doctorates during his lifetime, from <a href="Leiden%20University">Leiden</a> (D.Sc.1960), Cambridge (Sc.D.1967), and <a href="Uppsala%20University">Uppsala</a> (Fil.Dr.1972). He was the Masters Memorial Lecturer, Royal Horticultural Society in 1964. In 1976 the Linnean Society awarded him their Gold Medal for his contributions to Linnean scholarship and taxonomic botany. In 1985 he was the <a href="Wilkins%20Lecturer">Wilkins Lecturer</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>, entitled "<a href="John%20Wilkins">Wilkins</a>, John Ray, and Carl Linnaeus." In 1986 he received the Founder's Medal of the Society for the History of Natural History and in 1993 he received the <a href="Adolf%20Engler">Engler</a> Gold Medal from the <a href="International%20Association%20for%20Plant%20Taxonomy">International Association for Plant Taxonomy</a>. The Royal Horticultural Society awarded him both their <a href="Veitch%20Memorial%20Medal">Veitch Memorial Medal</a> (1964) and <a href="Victoria%20Medal%20of%20Honour">Victoria Medal of Honour</a> (VMH, 1965). In 2000 he received the <a href="Asa%20Gray%20Award">Asa Gray Award</a>, the highest honour of the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Plant%20Taxonomists">American Society of Plant Taxonomists</a>. Stearn was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in the <a href="1997%20Birthday%20Honours">1997 Birthday Honours</a> for services to horticulture and botany.

He was well regarded in Sweden for his studies on Linnaeus, and possessed a good grasp of the language. In addition to his honorary doctorate from Uppsala, the <a href="Royal%20Swedish%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> awarded him their Linnaeus Medal in 1972, he was granted the title of <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Polar%20Star">Commander of the Swedish Order of the Star of the North</a> (Polar Star) in 1980 and admitted to membership of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1983. Stearn was also elected to membership of the <a href="Swedish%20Linnaeus%20Society">Swedish Linnaeus Society</a>.

Stearn is considered a preeminent British botanist, and of equal stature with botanical scholars such as <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28Scottish%20botanist%20from%20Montrose%29">Robert Brown</a>, <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Darwin</a>, the Hookers (<a href="William%20Jackson%20Hooker">William</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Dalton%20Hooker">Joseph</a>) and <a href="Frans%20Stafleu">Frans Stafleu</a>. He has been variously described as a Renaissance man, a <a href="polymath">polymath</a>, "the modern Linnaeus", "the great Linnaean scholar of our day", "one of the world's greatest botanists" and a giant among botanists and horticulturalists. On his death, "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" noted his encyclopedic grasp of his field, stating that he was "acknowledged as the greatest botanical authority of the twentieth century". One description that Stearn rejected, however, was "the complete naturalist"an allusion to the title of his biography of Linnaeus. His contribution to his field was far greater than his extensive bibliography suggests, since he was known for his input into many of his colleagues' work, leading Professor <a href="P.%20B.%20Tomlinson">P. B. Tomlinson</a> to observe "he left no tome unstearned". The <a href="Society%20for%20the%20History%20of%20Natural%20History">Society for the History of Natural History</a> of which he was a founding member has created the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20History%20of%20Natural%20History%23Medals%20and%20prizes">William T. Stearn Student Essay Prize</a> in his honour.

Stearn is the <a href="botanical%20authority">botanical authority</a> for over 400 taxa that bear his name, such as "<a href="Allium%20chrysonemum">Allium chrysonemum</a>" Stearn. Many plants have been named (<a href="eponymy">eponymy</a>) after him, including the orchid <a href="nothogenus">nothogenus</a> <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrid</a> ×"Stearnara" J. M. H. Shaw. A number of species have been designated "stearnii" after William Stearn, including:

In light of his work on "Epimedium", a <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a> was named in his honour in 1988, "Epimedium" 'William Stearn'.

Artur Phleps

Artur Gustav Martin Phleps (29 November 1881 – 21 September 1944) was an <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austro-Hungarian</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Romanian</a> and <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a> army officer who held the rank of "<a href="Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer">SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS</a>" (lieutenant general) in the "<a href="Waffen-SS">Waffen-SS</a>" during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. An <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Army">Austro-Hungarian Army</a> officer before and during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, he specialised in <a href="mountain%20warfare">mountain warfare</a> and <a href="logistics">logistics</a>, and had been promoted to "<a href="Oberstleutnant">Oberstleutnant</a>" (lieutenant colonel) by the end of the war. During the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a> he joined the <a href="Romanian%20Army">Romanian Army</a>, reaching the rank of "General-locotenent" (major general), and also became an adviser to <a href="Carol%20II%20of%20Romania">King Carol</a>. After he spoke out against the government, he asked to be dismissed from the army after being sidelined.

In 1941 he left Romania and joined the "Waffen-SS" as an "SS-<a href="Standartenf%C3%BChrer">Standartenführer</a>" (colonel) under his mother's maiden name of Stolz. Seeing action on the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern Front</a> as a regimental commander with the <a href="5th%20SS%20Panzergrenadier%20Division%20Wiking">SS Motorised Division "Wiking"</a>, he later raised and commanded the <a href="7th%20SS%20Volunteer%20Mountain%20Division%20Prinz%20Eugen">7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division "Prinz Eugen"</a>, raised the <a href="13th%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Handschar%20%281st%20Croatian%29">13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS "Handschar" (1st Croatian)</a>, and commanded the <a href="V%20SS%20Mountain%20Corps">V SS Mountain Corps</a>. Units under his command committed many crimes against the civilian population of the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a>, <a href="Territory%20of%20the%20Military%20Commander%20in%20Serbia">German-occupied territory of Serbia</a> and <a href="Italian%20governorate%20of%20Montenegro">Italian governorate of Montenegro</a>. His final appointment was as plenipotentiary general in south <a href="Transylvania">Siebenbürgen</a> (Transylvania) and the <a href="Banat%20%281941%E2%80%9344%29">Banat</a>, during which he organised the evacuation of the "<a href="Volksdeutsche">Volksdeutsche</a>" (ethnic Germans) of Siebenbürgen to the Reich. In addition to the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a>, Phleps was awarded the <a href="German%20Cross">German Cross in Gold</a>, and after he was killed in September 1944, he was awarded the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross%20with%20Oak%20Leaves">Oak Leaves</a> to his Knight's Cross.

Phleps was born in <a href="Biertan">Birthälm</a> (Biertan), near <a href="Sibiu">Hermannstadt</a> in <a href="Transylvania">Siebenbürgen</a>, then a part of the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Empire">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a> (modern-day Transylvania, <a href="Romania">Romania</a>). At the time, Siebenbürgen was densely populated by <a href="Germans%20of%20Romania">ethnic Germans</a>, commonly referred to as <a href="Transylvanian%20Saxons">Transylvanian Saxons</a>. He was the third son of a surgeon, Dr. Gustav Phleps and Sophie (née Stolz), the daughter of a peasant. Both families had lived in Siebenbürgen for centuries. After finishing the Lutheran "<a href="Realschule">Realschule</a>" school in Hermannstadt, Phleps entered the <a href="Imperial%20and%20Royal">Imperial and Royal</a> cadet school in <a href="Bratislava">Pressburg</a> (modern-day <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>) in 1900, and on 1 November 1901 was commissioned as a "<a href="Leutnant">Leutnant</a>" (lieutenant) in the 3rd Regiment of the "<a href="County%20of%20Tyrol">Tiroler</a> <a href="Gebirgsj%C3%A4ger">Kaiserjäger</a>" (mountain infantry).

In 1903, Phleps was transferred to the 11th "Feldjäger" (rifle) Battalion in <a href="K%C5%91szeg">Güns</a> (in modern-day <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>), and in 1905 was accepted into the <a href="Theresian%20Military%20Academy">Theresian Military Academy</a> in <a href="Wiener%20Neustadt">Wiener Neustadt</a>. He completed his studies in two years, and was endorsed as suitable for service in the <a href="Staff%20%28military%29">General Staff</a>. Following promotion to "<a href="Oberleutnant">Oberleutnant</a>" (first lieutenant) he was transferred to the staff of the 13th Infantry Regiment at <a href="Osijek">Esseg</a> in <a href="Slavonia">Slavonia</a>, then to the 6th Infantry Division in <a href="Graz">Graz</a>. This was followed by a promotion to "<a href="Hauptmann">Hauptmann</a>" (captain) in 1911, along with a position on the staff of the XV <a href="Corps">Army Corps</a> in <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>. There, he specialised in <a href="mobilisation">mobilisation</a> and <a href="military%20communications">communications</a>, in the difficult terrain of <a href="Bosnia%20%28region%29">Bosnia</a> and <a href="Herzegovina">Herzegovina</a>.

At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Phleps was serving with the staff of the 32nd Infantry Division in <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>. His division was involved in the early stages of the <a href="Serbian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Serbian campaign</a>, during which Phleps was transferred to the <a href="Operations%20%28military%20staff%29">operations staff</a> of the Second <a href="Field%20army">Army</a>. This Army was soon withdrawn from the Serbian front and deployed via the <a href="Carpathian%20Mountains">Carpathian Mountains</a> to the Austro-Hungarian province of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Galicia%20and%20Lodomeria">Galicia</a> (modern-day <a href="Poland%20and%20Ukraine">Poland and Ukraine</a>), to defend against a successful offensive by the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Imperial</a> army. The Second Army continued to fight the Russians in and around the Carpathians through the winter of 1914–1915. In 1915 Phleps was again transferred, this time to "Armeegruppe Rohr" commanded by "<a href="General%20of%20the%20Cavalry%20%28Germany%29">General der Kavallerie</a>" (General) <a href="Franz%20Rohr%20von%20Denta">Franz Rohr von Denta</a>, which was formed in the <a href="Carinthia%20%28state%29">Austrian Alps</a>, in response to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italian</a> declaration of war in May 1915. "Armeegruppe Rohr" became the basis for the formation of the <a href="10th%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">10th Army</a>, which was headquartered in <a href="Villach">Villach</a>. Phleps subsequently became the deputy <a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a> of the 10th Army, responsible for organising the supply of the troops fighting the Italians in the mountains.

On 1 August 1916, Phleps was promoted to <a href="Major%20%28Germany%29">Major</a>. Later that month, King <a href="Ferdinand%20of%20Romania">Ferdinand of Romania</a> led the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Kingdom of Romania</a> in joining the <a href="Triple%20Entente">Triple Entente</a>, subsequently invading Phleps' homeland of Siebenbürgen. On 27 August, Phleps became the chief of staff of the 72nd Infantry Division, which was involved in Austro-Hungarian operations to repel the Romanian invasion. He remained in this theatre of operations for the next two years, ultimately serving as the chief quartermaster of the German <a href="9th%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">9th Army</a>, and was awarded the <a href="Iron%20Cross">Iron Cross</a> 2nd Class, on 27 January 1917. In 1918 he returned to the mountains when he was transferred to "Armeegruppe Tirol", and ended the war as an "<a href="Oberstleutnant">Oberstleutnant</a>" (lieutenant colonel) and chief quartermaster for the entire <a href="Italian%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Alpine Front</a>.

After the war the Austro-Hungarian Empire <a href="Austria-Hungary%23Dissolution">was dissolved</a>, and Phleps returned to his homeland, which had become part of the Kingdom of Romania under the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Trianon">Treaty of Trianon</a>. He joined the <a href="Romanian%20Land%20Forces">Romanian Army</a> and was appointed commander of the Saxon National Guard, a <a href="militia">militia</a> formed of the German-speaking people of Siebenbürgen. In this role he opposed the Hungarian communist revolutionary government of <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Kun">Béla Kun</a>, which <a href="Hungarian%E2%80%93Romanian%20war%20of%201919">fought against Romania in 1919</a>. During a battle at the <a href="Tisza">Tisza</a> river against Kun's forces, Phleps disobeyed direct orders and was subsequently <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>led. The trial concluded that he had saved the Romanian forces through his actions, and he was promoted to "<a href="Oberst">Oberst</a>" (colonel). He commanded the 84th Infantry Regiment, then joined the general army headquarters and started teaching <a href="Military%20logistics">logistics</a> at the Romanian <a href="Carol%20I%20National%20Defence%20University">War Academy</a> in <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>. He attended the V Army Corps <a href="staff%20college">staff college</a> in <a href="Bra%C8%99ov">Brașov</a>, and published a book titled "Logistics: Basics of Organisation and Execution" in 1926, which became the standard work on logistics for the Romanian Army. Ironically, after the book was published, Phleps failed his first general's examination on the topic of logistics. He commanded various Romanian units, including the 1st Brigade of the "<a href="v%C3%A2n%C4%83tori%20de%20munte">vânători de munte</a>" (mountain ranger troops), while serving also as a military advisor to King <a href="Carol%20II%20of%20Romania">Carol II</a> in the 1930s. Phleps reached the rank of "General-locotenent" (major general) despite his reported disdain for the corruption, intrigue and hypocrisy of the royal court. After criticising the government's policy and publicly calling King Carol a liar when another general tried to twist his words, he was transferred to the reserves in 1940 and finally dismissed from service at his own request in 1941.

In November 1940, with the support of the leader of the "Volksgruppe in Rumänien" (ethnic Germans in Romania), Andreas Schmidt, Phleps wrote to the key "Waffen-SS" recruiting officer "SS-<a href="Brigadef%C3%BChrer">Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen SS</a>" (Brigadier) <a href="Gottlob%20Berger">Gottlob Berger</a> offering his services to the Third Reich. He subsequently asked for permission to leave Romania in order to join the "<a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>", and this was approved by the recently installed Romanian "<a href="Conduc%C4%83tor">Conducător</a>" (dictator), General <a href="Ion%20Antonescu">Ion Antonescu</a>. Phleps volunteered for the "<a href="Waffen-SS">Waffen-SS</a>" instead, enlisting under his mother's maiden name of Stolz. According to the historian Hans Bergel, Phleps joined the "Waffen-SS" because "Volksdeutsche" were not permitted to join the "Wehrmacht". He was appointed an "SS-<a href="Standartenf%C3%BChrer">Standartenführer</a>" (colonel) by "<a href="Reichsf%C3%BChrer-SS">Reichsführer-SS</a>" <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a> and joined the <a href="5th%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Wiking">SS Motorised Division "Wiking"</a>, where he commanded Dutch, Flemish, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish volunteers. When <a href="Hilmar%20W%C3%A4ckerle">Hilmar Wäckerle</a>, the commander of SS-Regiment "Westland", was killed in action near <a href="Lvov">Lvov</a> in late June 1941, Phleps took over command of that regiment. He distinguished himself in fighting at <a href="Kremenchuk">Kremenchuk</a> and <a href="Dnipropetrovsk">Dnipropetrovsk</a> in the Ukraine, commanded his own "<a href="Kampfgruppe">Kampfgruppe</a>", became a <a href="confidant">confidant</a> of "<a href="Generalmajor">Generalmajor</a>" (Brigadier General) <a href="Hans-Valentin%20Hube">Hans-Valentin Hube</a>, commander of the <a href="16th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">16th Panzer Division</a>, and was subsequently promoted to "SS-<a href="Oberf%C3%BChrer">Oberführer</a>" (senior colonel). In July 1941 he was awarded the 1939 clasp to his Iron Cross (1914) 2nd Class and then the Iron Cross (1939) 1st Class.

On 30 December 1941, "<a href="Generalfeldmarschall">Generalfeldmarschall</a>" (Field Marshal) <a href="Wilhelm%20Keitel">Wilhelm Keitel</a> advised Himmler that <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> had authorised the raising of a seventh "Waffen-SS" division from the "Volksdeutsche" (ethnic Germans) of Yugoslavia. In the meantime, Phleps reverted to his birth name from his mother's maiden name. Two weeks later, "SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen SS" Phleps was selected to organise the new division. On 1 March 1942, the division was officially designated the "SS-Freiwilligen-Division "Prinz Eugen"". Phleps was promoted to "SS-<a href="Gruppenf%C3%BChrer">Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Waffen SS</a>" (major general) on 20 April 1942. After recruitment, formation and training in the <a href="Banat%20%281941%E2%80%9344%29">Banat</a> region in October 1942, the two regiments and supporting arms were deployed into the southwestern part of the <a href="Territory%20of%20the%20Military%20Commander%20in%20Serbia">German-occupied territory of Serbia</a> as an anti-<a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Partisan</a> force. Headquartered in <a href="Kraljevo">Kraljevo</a>, with its two mountain infantry regiments centred on <a href="U%C5%BEice">Užice</a> and <a href="Ra%C5%A1ka%2C%20Serbia">Raška</a>, the division continued its training. Some artillery batteries, the anti-aircraft battalion, the motorcycle battalion and cavalry squadron continued to form in the Banat. During his time with the 7th SS Division, Phleps was referred to as "Papa Phleps" by his troops.

In early October 1942, the division commenced Operation "Kopaonik", targeting the <a href="Chetnik">Chetnik</a> force of Major <a href="Dragutin%20Keserovi%C4%87">Dragutin Keserović</a> in the <a href="Kopaonik">Kopaonik Mountains</a>. The operation ended with little success, since the Chetniks had forewarning of the operation and were able to avoid contact. After a quiet winter, in January 1943 Phleps deployed the division to the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a> (NDH) to participate in <a href="Case%20White">Case White</a>. Between 13 February and 9 March 1943 he was responsible for the initial aspects of raising the <a href="13th%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Handschar%20%281st%20Croatian%29">13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS "Handschar" (1st Croatian)</a> in the NDH in addition to his duties commanding the 7th SS Division.
In his strongly apologetic divisional history of the division which he later commanded, <a href="Otto%20Kumm">Otto Kumm</a> claims that his division captured <a href="Biha%C4%87">Bihać</a> and <a href="Bosanski%20Petrovac">Bosanski Petrovac</a>, killed over 2,000 Partisans and captured nearly 400 during Case White. After a short rest and refit in April, the division was committed to <a href="Case%20Black">Case Black</a> in May and June 1943, during which it advanced from the <a href="Mostar">Mostar</a> area into the <a href="Italian%20governorate%20of%20Montenegro">Italian governorate of Montenegro</a> killing, according to Kumm, 250 Partisans and capturing over 500. The historian Thomas Casagrande notes that all German units fighting partisans routinely counted the civilians they had murdered as partisans. Therefore, it can be assumed that the reported number of inflicted casualties included many civilians. The division played a decisive role during the fighting. Although Himmler had already planned to award Phleps the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a> for his role in organising the 7th SS Division, it was for the achievements of his division during Case Black that Phleps received the award. Phleps was also portrayed in the SS-magazine "<a href="Das%20Schwarze%20Korps">Das Schwarze Korps</a>". He received the Knight's Cross in July 1943, while being also promoted to "Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS" (lieutenant general), and placed in command of the <a href="V%20SS%20Mountain%20Corps">V SS Mountain Corps</a>.

In May 1943, Phleps became frustrated by the failure of his Italian allies to cooperate with German operations, which was demonstrated in his reputation for forthright speech. During a meeting with his Italian counterpart in <a href="Podgorica">Podgorica</a>, Montenegro, Phleps called the Italian corps commander General <a href="Ercole%20Roncaglia">Ercole Roncaglia</a> a "lazy macaroni". Phleps scolded his "Wehrmacht" interpreter, "Leutnant" <a href="Kurt%20Waldheim">Kurt Waldheim</a> for toning down his language, saying "Listen Waldheim, I know some Italian and you are not translating what I am telling this so-and-so". On another occasion, he threatened to shoot Italian sentries who were delaying his passage through a checkpoint. On 15 May 1943, Phleps handed over command of the division to "SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen SS" <a href="Karl%20von%20Oberkamp">Karl von Oberkamp</a>.

While under Phleps' command, the division committed many crimes against civilian population of the NDH, especially during Case White and Case Black. These included "burning villages, massacre of inhabitants, torture and murder of captured partisans", thence the division thereby developed a distinctive reputation for cruelty. These charges have been denied by Kumm, among others. Still, the divisional orders routinely called for the annihilation of hostile civilian population and documents by the "Waffen-SS" themselves show that these orders were regularly put into practice. For example, Himmler's police representative in the NDH, "SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Polizei" <a href="Konstantin%20Kammerhofer">Konstantin Kammerhofer</a>, reported on 15 July 1943 that units of the 7th SS Division had shot the Muslim population of <a href="Ko%C5%A1utica%2C%20Sokolac">Kosutica</a>, about 40 men, women, and children gathered in a "church". The division claimed that "bandits" in the village had opened fire, but the police could not discover any traces of combat. Such incidents, which jeopardized the plan to raise a Muslim SS division, led to a dispute between Kammerhofer and Phleps' successor Oberkamp. Himmler ordered Phleps to intervene, and he reported on 7 September 1943 that he could not discover anything wrong with the shootings in Kosutica and that Kammerhofer and Oberkamp had resolved their dispute. The war crimes committed by the 7th SS Division became the subject of international controversy when Waldheim's service in the Balkans became public in the mid-1980s, during his successful bid for the <a href="President%20of%20Austria">Austrian presidency</a>.

The formations under the command of V SS Mountain Corps varied during Phlep's command. In July 1944, it consisted of the <a href="118th%20J%C3%A4ger%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">118th Jäger Division</a> and <a href="369th%20%28Croatian%29%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">369th (Croatian) Infantry Division</a> in addition to the 7th SS and 13th SS divisions. Throughout Phlep's command, the corps was under the overall control of <a href="2nd%20Panzer%20Army">2nd Panzer Army</a> and conducted anti-Partisan operations throughout the NDH and Montenegro. These operations included Operations <a href="Operation%20Kugelblitz">"Kugelblitz"</a> (ball lightning) and "Schneesturm" (blizzard), which were part of a major offensive in eastern Bosnia in December 1943, but they were only a limited success. Phleps had met personally with Hitler to discuss the planning for Operation "Kugelblitz".

Due to the unreliable nature of the troops loyal to the NDH government, Phleps utilised Chetnik forces as auxiliaries, stating to a visiting officer that he could not disarm the Chetniks unless the NDH government provided him with the same strength in reliable troops. In January 1944, due to fears that the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Western Allies</a> would invade along the <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>n coastline and islands, V SS Mountain Corps forced the mass evacuation of male civilians between the ages of 17 and 50 from that area. Phleps was criticised by both NDH and German authorities for the harshness with which the evacuation was carried out. During the first six months of 1944, elements of the V SS Mountain Corps were involved in Operation "Waldrausch" (Forest Fever) in central Bosnia, <a href="13th%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Handschar%20%281st%20Croatian%29%23Anti-Partisan%20operations%20March%20to%20May%201944">Operation "Maibaum"</a> (Maypole) in eastern Bosnia, and <a href="Operation%20R%C3%B6sselsprung%20%281944%29">Operation "Rösselsprung"</a> (Knight's Move), the attempt to capture or kill the Partisan leader <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a>.

On 20 June 1944, Phleps was awarded the <a href="German%20Cross">German Cross</a> in Gold. In September, he was appointed <a href="plenipotentiary">plenipotentiary</a> general of German occupation troops in south Siebenbürgen and the <a href="Banat%20%281941%E2%80%9344%29">Banat</a>, organising the flight of the "Volksdeutsche" of north Siebenbürgen ahead of the advancing <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a>.

Following the 23 August 1944 <a href="King%20Michael%27s%20Coup">King Michael's Coup</a>, while en route to a meeting with Himmler in Berlin, Phleps and his entourage made a detour to reconnoitre the situation near <a href="Arad%2C%20Romania">Arad, Romania</a> after receiving reports of Soviet advances in that area. Accompanied only by his adjutant and his driver, and unaware of the presence of Red Army units in the vicinity, he entered <a href="%C8%98imand">Șimand</a>, a village approximately north of Arad, on the afternoon of 21 September 1944. Soviet forces were already in the village, and Phleps and his men were captured and brought in for interrogation. When the building in which they were held was attacked by German aircraft later that afternoon, the prisoners tried to escape and were shot by their guards. Bergel suspects that Phleps had been set up by Hungarian army officers who had found out that he knew of plans for Hungary to switch sides as Romania had done shortly before. Phleps' personal effects, including his identity card, tags and decorations, were found by a Hungarian patrol and handed over to German authorities on 29 September 1944. Phleps had been listed as missing in action since 22 September 1944 when he did not show up for his meeting with Himmler, who had issued a warrant for his arrest.

Phleps was posthumously awarded the Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross on 24 November 1944, which was presented to his son, "<a href="SS-Obersturmf%C3%BChrer">SS-Obersturmführer</a>" (First Lieutenant) Dr.med. Reinhart Phleps, a battalion doctor serving in the 7th SS Division. Soon after his death, the 13th "Gebirgsjäger" Regiment of the 7th SS Division was given the <a href="cuff%20title">cuff title</a> "Artur Phleps" in his honour. Phleps was married; his wife's name was Grete and in addition to their son Reinhart, they had a daughter, Irmingard. One of Phleps' brothers became a doctor, and the other was a professor at the <a href="Gda%C5%84sk">Danzig</a> technical university, now <a href="Gda%C5%84sk%20University%20of%20Technology">Gdańsk University of Technology</a>.

Phleps was accused by the Yugoslav authorities of war crimes in association with the atrocities committed by 7th SS Division in the area of <a href="Nik%C5%A1i%C4%87">Nikšić</a> in <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a> during Case Black. At the <a href="Nuremberg%20trials">Nuremberg trials</a> on 6 August 1946, a document from the Yugoslav State Commission for Crimes of Occupiers and their Collaborators regarding the crimes of the 7th SS Division was quoted as follows:

At the end of May 1943 the division came to Montenegro to the area of Niksic in order to take part in the fifth enemy offensive in conjunction with the Italian troops. [...] The officers and men of the SS division "Prinz Eugen" committed crimes of an outrageous cruelty on this occasion. The victims were shot, slaughtered and tortured, or burnt to death in burning houses. [...] It has been established from the investigations entered upon that 121 persons, mostly women, and including 30 persons aged 60–92 years and 29 children of ages ranging from 6 months to 14 years, were executed on this occasion in the horrible manner narrated above. The villages [and then follows the list of the villages] were burnt down and razed to the ground. [...] For all of these most serious War Crimes those responsible besides the actual culprits--the members of the SS Division Prinz Eugen--are all superior and all subordinate commanders as the persons issuing and transmitting the orders for murder and devastation. Among others the following war criminals are known: SS Gruppenfuehrer and Lieutenant General of the Waffen-SS Phleps; Divisional Commander, Major General of the Waffen-SS Karl von Oberkamp; Commander of the 13th Regiment, later Divisional Commander, Major General Gerhard Schmidhuber...

Phleps received the following awards during his service:

Attalus I

Attalus I (), surnamed Soter (, "Savior"; 269–197 BC) ruled <a href="Pergamon">Pergamon</a>, an Ionian Greek <a href="polis">polis</a> (what is now <a href="Bergama">Bergama</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>), first as <a href="dynast">dynast</a>, later as king, from 241 BC to 197 BC. He was the first cousin once removed and the adoptive son of <a href="Eumenes%20I">Eumenes I</a>, whom he succeeded, and was the first of the <a href="Attalid%20dynasty">Attalid dynasty</a> to assume the title of king in 238 BC. He was the son of Attalus and his wife Antiochis.

Attalus won an important victory over the <a href="Galatia">Galatia</a>ns, newly arrived <a href="Celt">Celt</a>ic tribes from <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, who had been, for more than a generation, plundering and exacting tribute throughout most of <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a> without any serious check. This victory, celebrated by the triumphal monument at Pergamon (famous for its <a href="The%20Dying%20Gaul">Dying Gaul</a>) and the liberation from the Gallic "terror" which it represented, earned for Attalus the name of "Soter", and the title of "<a href="basileus">king</a>". A courageous and capable general and loyal ally of <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a>, he played a significant role in the first and second <a href="Macedonian%20Wars">Macedonian Wars</a>, waged against <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Macedon">Philip V of Macedon</a>. He conducted numerous naval operations, harassing Macedonian interests throughout the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a>, winning honors, collecting spoils, and gaining for Pergamon possession of the Greek islands of <a href="Aegina">Aegina</a> during the first war, and <a href="Andros">Andros</a> during the second, twice narrowly escaping capture at the hands of Philip.

Attalus was a protector of the Greek cities of <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> and viewed himself as the champion of <a href="Greek%20people">Greeks</a> against <a href="barbarians">barbarians</a>. During his reign he established Pergamon as a considerable power in the <a href="Greek%20East">Greek East</a>. He died in 197 BC, shortly before the end of the second war, at the age of 72, having suffered an apparent <a href="stroke">stroke</a> while addressing a <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a>n war council some months before. He and his wife were admired for their rearing of their four sons. He was succeeded as king by his son <a href="Eumenes%20II">Eumenes II</a>.

Little is known about Attalus' early life. He was born a <a href="Greek%20people">Greek</a>, the son of Attalus, and Antiochis. The elder Attalus was the son of a brother (also called Attalus) of both <a href="Philetaerus">Philetaerus</a>, the founder of the <a href="Attalid%20dynasty">Attalid dynasty</a>, and Eumenes, the father of <a href="Eumenes%20I">Eumenes I</a>, Philetaerus' successor; he is mentioned, along with his uncles, as a benefactor of <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a>, won fame as a charioteer, winning at <a href="Olympia%2C%20Greece">Olympia</a>, and was honored with a monument at Pergamon.

Attalus was a young child when his father died, sometime before 241 BC, after which he was adopted by Eumenes I, the incumbent dynast. Attalus' mother, <a href="Antiochis">Antiochis</a>, was related to the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid</a> royal family (being a granddaughter of <a href="Seleucus%20I%20Nicator">Seleucus I Nicator</a>) with her marriage to Attalus' father likely arranged by Philetaerus to solidify his power. This would be consistent with the conjecture that Attalus' father had been Philetaerus' heir designate, but was succeeded by Eumenes, since Attalus I was too young when his father died.

According to the 2nd century AD Greek writer <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a>, "the greatest of his achievements" was the defeat of the "<a href="Gauls">Gauls</a>" (). Pausanias was referring to the Galatians, immigrant <a href="Celts">Celts</a> from <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, who had recently settled in <a href="Galatia">Galatia</a> in central <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, and whom the Romans and Greeks called Gauls, associating them with the Celts of what is now France, Switzerland, and northern Italy. Since the time of Philetaerus, the first Attalid ruler, the Galatians had posed a problem for Pergamon, indeed for all of Asia Minor, by exacting tributes to avoid war or other repercussions. Eumenes I had (probably), along with other rulers, dealt with the Galatians by paying these tributes. Attalus however refused to pay them, being the first such ruler to do so. As a consequence, the Galatians set out to attack Pergamon. Attalus met them near the sources of the river Caïcus and won a <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Caecus%20River">decisive victory</a>, after which, following the example of <a href="Antiochus%20I">Antiochus I</a>, Attalus took the name of Soter, which means "savior", and claimed the title of king. The victory brought Attalus legendary fame. A story arose, related by Pausanias, of an oracle who had foretold these events a generation earlier:

Pausanias adds that by "son of a bull" the oracle "meant Attalus, king of Pergamon, who was styled bull-horned". On the acropolis of Pergamon was erected a triumphal monument, which included the famous sculpture the "<a href="Dying%20Gaul">Dying Gaul</a>", commemorating this battle.

Several years after the first victory over the Gauls, Pergamon was again attacked by the Gauls together with their ally <a href="Antiochus%20Hierax">Antiochus Hierax</a>, the younger brother of <a href="Seleucus%20II%20Callinicus">Seleucus II Callinicus</a>, and ruler of Seleucid Asia Minor from his capital at <a href="Sardis">Sardis</a>. Attalus defeated the Gauls and Antiochus at the battle of Aphrodisium and again at a second battle in the east. Subsequent battles were fought and won against Antiochus alone: in Hellespontine <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a>, where Antiochus was perhaps seeking refuge with his father-in law, <a href="Ziaelas">Ziaelas</a> the king of <a href="Bithynia">Bithynia</a>; near Sardis in the spring of 228 BC; and, in the final <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Harpasus">battle of the campaign</a>, further south in <a href="Caria">Caria</a> on the banks of the Harpasus, a tributary of the <a href="B%C3%BCy%C3%BCk%20Menderes%20River">Maeander</a>.

As a result of these victories, Attalus gained control over all of Seleucid Asia Minor north of the <a href="Taurus%20Mountains">Taurus Mountains</a>. He was able to hold on to these gains in the face of repeated attempts by <a href="Seleucus%20III%20Ceraunus">Seleucus III Ceraunus</a>, eldest son and successor of Seleucus II, to recover the lost territory, culminating in Seleucus III himself crossing the Taurus, only to be assassinated by members of his army in 223 BC. <a href="Achaeus%20%28general%29">Achaeus</a>, who had accompanied Seleucus III, assumed control of the army. He was offered and refused the kingship in favor of Seleucus III's younger brother <a href="Antiochus%20III%20the%20Great">Antiochus III the Great</a>, who then made Achaeus governor of Seleucid Asia Minor north of the Taurus. Within two years Achaeus had recovered all the lost Seleucid territories, "shut up Attalus within the walls of Pergamon", and assumed the title of king.

After a period of peace, in 218 BC, while Achaeus was involved in an expedition to <a href="Selge">Selge</a> south of the Taurus, Attalus, with some Thracian Gauls, recaptured his former territories. However Achaeus returned from victory in Selge in 217 BC and resumed hostilities with Attalus.

Under a treaty of alliance with Attalus, Antiochus crossed the Taurus in 216 BC, attacked Achaeus and besieged Sardis, and in 214 BC, the second year of the siege, was able to take the city. However the citadel remained under Achaeus' control. Under the pretense of a rescue, Achaeus was finally captured and put to death, and the citadel surrendered. By 213 BC, Antiochus had regained control of all of his Asiatic provinces.

Thwarted in the east, Attalus now turned his attention westward. Perhaps because of concern for the ambitions of <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Macedon">Philip V of Macedon</a>, Attalus had sometime before 219 BC become allied with Philip's enemies the <a href="Aetolian%20League">Aetolian League</a>, a union of Greek states in <a href="Aetolia">Aetolia</a> in central Greece, having funded the fortification of Elaeus, an Aetolian stronghold in <a href="Calydon">Calydon</a>ia, near the mouth of the river <a href="Acheloos%20River">Acheloos</a>.

Philip's alliance with <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a> of <a href="Ancient%20Carthage">Carthage</a> in 215 BC also caused concern in <a href="Roman%20Republic">Rome</a>, then involved in the <a href="Second%20Punic%20War">Second Punic War</a>. In 211 BC, a treaty was signed between Rome and the Aetolian League, a provision of which allowed for the inclusion of certain allies of the League, Attalus being one of these. Attalus was elected one of the two "<a href="strategos">strategoi</a>" (generals) of the Aetolian League, and in 210 BC his troops probably participated in capturing the island of <a href="Aegina">Aegina</a>, acquired by Attalus as his base of operations in Greece.

In the following spring (209 BC), Philip marched south into Greece. Under command of <a href="Pyrrhias%20of%20Aetolia">Pyrrhias</a>, Attalus' colleague as strategos, the allies lost two battles at <a href="Lamia%20%28city%29">Lamia</a>. Attalus himself went to Greece in July and was joined on Aegina by the Roman <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a> <a href="Publius%20Sulpicius%20Galba%20Maximus">P. Sulpicius Galba</a> who wintered there. The following summer (208 BC) the combined fleet of thirty-five Pergamene and twenty-five Roman ships failed to take <a href="Lemnos">Lemnos</a>, but occupied and plundered the countryside of the island of Peparethos (<a href="Skopelos">Skopelos</a>), both Macedonian possessions. Attalus and Sulpicius then attended a meeting in <a href="Heraclea%20Trachinia">Heraclea Trachinia</a> of the Council of the Aetolians, at which the Roman argued against making peace with Philip.

When hostilities resumed, they sacked both <a href="Oreus">Oreus</a>, on the northern coast of <a href="Euboea">Euboea</a> and <a href="Opus%2C%20Greece">Opus</a>, the chief city of eastern <a href="Locris">Locris</a>. The spoils from Oreus had been reserved for Sulpicius, who returned there, while Attalus stayed to collect the spoils from Opus. With their forces divided, Philip attacked Opus. Attalus, caught by surprise, was barely able to escape to his ships.

Attalus was now forced to return to Asia, for he had learned at Opus that, at the instigation of Philip, <a href="Prusias%20I%20of%20Bithynia">Prusias I</a> king of Bithynia, related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Soon after, the Romans also abandoned Greece to concentrate their forces against Hannibal, their objective of preventing Philip from aiding Hannibal having been achieved. In 206 BC the Aetolians sued for peace on conditions imposed by Philip. A treaty was drawn up at Phoenice in 205 BC, formally ending the <a href="First%20Macedonian%20War">First Macedonian War</a>. Attalus was included as an "adscriptus" on the side of Rome. He retained Aegina, but had accomplished little else. Since Prusias was also included in the treaty, the war between Attalus and Prusias must also have ended by that time.

In 205 BC, following the "Peace of Phoenice", Rome turned to Attalus, as its only friend in Asia, for help concerning a religious matter. An unusual number of meteor showers caused concern in Rome, and an inspection was made of the <a href="Sibylline%20Books">Sibylline Books</a>, which discovered verses saying that if a foreigner were to make war on Italy, he could be defeated if the "Magna Idaea", the Mother Goddess, associated with <a href="Mount%20Ida">Mount Ida</a> in <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a>, were brought to Rome. Hoping to bring about a speedy conclusion to the war with Hannibal, a distinguished delegation, led by <a href="Marcus%20Valerius%20Laevinus">M. Valerius Laevinus</a>, was dispatched to Pergamon, to seek Attalus' aid. According to <a href="Livy">Livy</a>, Attalus received the delegation warmly, and "handed over to them the sacred stone which the natives declared to be 'the Mother of the Gods', and bade them carry it to Rome." In Rome the goddess became known as the <a href="Magna%20Mater%20deorum%20Idaea">Magna Mater</a>.

Prevented by the treaty of Phoenice from expansion in the west, Philip set out to extend his power in the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a> and in Asia Minor. In the spring of 201 BC he took <a href="Samos%20Island">Samos</a> and the <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian</a> fleet stationed there. He then besieged <a href="Chios">Chios</a> to the north. These events caused Attalus, allied with <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>, <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a> and <a href="Cyzicus">Cyzicus</a>, to enter the war. A large naval battle occurred in the strait between Chios and the mainland, just southwest of <a href="Erythrae">Erythrae</a>. According to <a href="Polybius">Polybius</a>, fifty-three decked warships and over one hundred and fifty smaller warships, took part on the Macedonian side, with sixty-five decked warships and a number of smaller warships on the allied side. During the battle Attalus, having become isolated from his fleet and pursued by Philip, was forced to run his three ships ashore, narrowly escaping by spreading various royal treasures on the decks of the grounded ships, causing his pursuers to abandon the pursuit in favor of plunder.

The same year, Philip invaded Pergamon; although unable to take the easily defended city, in part due to precautions taken by Attalus to provide for additional fortifications, he demolished the surrounding temples and altars.
Meanwhile, Attalus and Rhodes sent envoys to Rome, to register their complaints against Philip.

In 200 BC, Attalus became involved in the <a href="Second%20Macedonian%20War">Second Macedonian War</a>. <a href="Acarnania">Acarnania</a>ns with Macedonian support invaded <a href="Attica">Attica</a>, causing <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, which had previously maintained its neutrality, to seek help from the enemies of Philip. Attalus, with his fleet at Aegina, received an embassy from Athens, to come to the city for consultations. A few days later, he learned that Roman ambassadors were also at Athens, and decided to go there at once. His reception at Athens was extraordinary. Polybius writes:

Sulpicius Galba, now <a href="Roman%20consul">consul</a>, convinced Rome to declare war on Philip and asked Attalus to meet up with the Roman fleet and again conduct a naval campaign, harassing Macedonian possessions in the Aegean. In the spring of 199 BC, the combined Pergamon and Roman fleets took <a href="Andros">Andros</a> in the <a href="Cyclades">Cyclades</a>, the spoils going to the Romans and the island to Attalus. From Andros they sailed south, made a fruitless attack on another Cycladic island, <a href="Kithnos">Kithnos</a>, turned back north, scavenged the fields of <a href="Skiathos">Skiathos</a> off the coast of <a href="Magnesia%20Prefecture">Magnesia</a>, for food, and continued north to <a href="Mende%20%28Greece%29">Mende</a>, where the fleets were wracked by storm. On land they were repulsed at <a href="Cassandrea">Cassandrea</a>, suffering heavy loss. They continued northeast along the Macedonian coast to <a href="Acanthus%20%28Greece%29">Acanthus</a>, which they sacked, after which they returned to Euboea, their vessels laden with spoils. On their return, the two leaders went to Heraclea to meet with the Aetolians, who under the terms of their treaty, had asked Attalus for a thousand soldiers. He refused, citing the Aetolians' own refusal to honor Attalus' request to attack Macedonia during Philip's attack on Pergamon two years earlier. Resuming operations, Attalus and the Romans attacked but failed to take Oreus and, deciding to leave a small force to invest it, attacked across the strait in <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>. When they returned to Oreus, they again attacked, this time successfully, the Romans taking the captives, Attalus the city. The campaigning season now over, Attalus attended the <a href="Eleusinian%20Mysteries">Eleusinian Mysteries</a> and then returned to Pergamon having been away for over two years.

In the spring of 198 BC, Attalus returned to Greece with twenty-three <a href="quinquereme">quinquereme</a>s joining a fleet of twenty Rhodian decked warships at Andros, to complete the conquest of Euboea begun the previous year. Soon joined by the Romans, the combined fleets took <a href="Eretria">Eretria</a> and later <a href="Carystus">Carystus</a>. Thus, the allies controlled all of Euboea except for <a href="Chalcis">Chalcis</a>. The allied fleet then sailed for <a href="Cenchreae">Cenchreae</a> in preparation for an attack on <a href="Corinth">Corinth</a>. Meanwhile, the new Roman consul for that year, <a href="Titus%20Quinctius%20Flamininus">Titus Quinctius Flamininus</a>, had learned that the <a href="Achaean%20League">Achaean League</a>, allies of Macedon, had had a change in leadership which favored Rome. With the hope of inducing the Achaeans to abandon Philip and join the allies, envoys were sent, including Attalus himself, to <a href="Sicyon">Sicyon</a>, where they offered the incorporation of Corinth into the Achaean League. Attalus apparently so impressed the Sicyonians, that they erected a colossal statue of him in their market place and instituted sacrifices in his honor. A meeting of the League was convened and after a heated debate and the withdrawal of some of delegates the rest agreed to join the alliance. Attalus led his army from Cenchreae (now controlled by the allies) through the Isthmus and attacked Corinth from the north, controlling the access to <a href="Lechaeum">Lechaeum</a>, the Corinthian port on the Gulf of Corinth, the Romans attacked from the east controlling the approaches to Cenchreae, with the Achaeans attacking from the west controlling the access to the city via the Sicyonian gate. However the city held, and when Macedonian reinforcements arrived, the siege was abandoned. The Achaeans were dismissed, the Romans left for <a href="Corcyra">Corcyra</a>, while Attalus sailed for <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>.

Early in 197 BC, Flamininus summoned Attalus to join him at <a href="Elateia">Elateia</a> (now in Roman hands) and from there they traveled together to attend a <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a>n council in <a href="Thebes%20%28Greece%29">Thebes</a> to discuss which side Boeotia would take in the war. At the council Attalus spoke first, reminding the Boeotians of the many things he and his ancestors had done for them, but during his address he stopped talking and collapsed, with one side of his body paralyzed. Attalus was taken back to Pergamon, where he died around the time of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cynoscephalae">Battle of Cynoscephalae</a>, which brought about the end of the Second Macedonian War.

Attalus married Apollonis, from <a href="Cyzicus">Cyzicus</a>. They had four sons, <a href="Eumenes%20II">Eumenes</a>, <a href="Attalus%20II%20Philadelphus">Attalus</a>, Philetaerus and Athenaeus (after Apollonis' father). Apollonis was thought to be a model of motherly love. <a href="Polybius">Polybius</a> describes Apollonis as "a woman who for many reasons deserves to be remembered, and with honor. Her claims upon a favourable recollection are that, though born of a private family, she became a queen, and retained that exalted rank to the end of her life, not by the use of meretricious fascinations, but by the virtue and integrity of her conduct in private and public life alike. Above all, she was the mother of four sons with whom she kept on terms of the most perfect affection and motherly love to the last day of her life."

The filial affection of the brothers as well as their upbringing is remarked on by several ancient sources. A decree of <a href="Antiochus%20IV">Antiochus IV</a> praises "king Attalus and queen Apollonis … because of their virtue and goodness, which they preserved for their sons, managing their education in this way wisely and well." An inscription at Pergamon represents Apollonis as saying that "she always considered herself blessed and gave thanks to the gods, not for wealth or empire, but because she saw her three sons guarding the eldest and him reigning without fear among those who were armed." When Attalus died in 197 BC at the age of 72, he was succeeded by his eldest son Eumenes II. Polybius, describing Attalus' life says "and what is more remarkable than all, though he left four grown-up sons, he so well settled the question of succession, that the crown was handed down to his children's children without a single dispute."

Apollonis died in the mid-second-century BC. In her honor, Attalus' sons built a temple in Cyzicus decorated with bas-reliefs representing several scenes of sons displaying love for their mothers, with one scene also showing love for a father.

Western Chalukya Empire

The Western Chalukya Empire ruled most of the <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">western Deccan</a>, <a href="South%20India">South India</a>, between the 10th and 12th centuries. This <a href="Kannadiga">Kannadiga</a> dynasty is sometimes called the "Kalyani Chalukya" after its regal capital at Kalyani, today's <a href="Basavakalyan">Basavakalyan</a> in the modern Bidar District of <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> state, and alternatively the "Later Chalukya" from its theoretical relationship to the 6th-century <a href="Chalukya%20dynasty">Chalukya dynasty</a> of <a href="Badami">Badami</a>. The dynasty is called Western Chalukyas to differentiate from the contemporaneous <a href="Eastern%20Chalukyas">Eastern Chalukyas</a> of <a href="Vengi">Vengi</a>, a separate dynasty. Prior to the rise of these Chalukyas, the <a href="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a> empire of <a href="Manyakheta">Manyakheta</a> controlled most of <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan</a> and <a href="Central%20India">Central India</a> for over two centuries. In 973, seeing confusion in the Rashtrakuta empire after a successful invasion of their capital by the ruler of the <a href="Paramara">Paramara</a> dynasty of <a href="Malwa">Malwa</a>, <a href="Tailapa%20II">Tailapa II</a>, a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta Dynasty ruling from <a href="Bijapur%20district%2C%20Karnataka">Bijapur</a> region defeated his overlords and made Manyakheta his capital. The dynasty quickly rose to power and grew into an empire under <a href="Someshvara%20I">Someshvara I</a> who moved the capital to Kalyani.

For over a century, the two empires of <a href="Southern%20India">Southern India</a>, the Western Chalukyas and the <a href="Chola%20dynasty">Chola dynasty</a> of <a href="Tanjore">Tanjore</a> fought many fierce wars to control the fertile region of <a href="Vengi">Vengi</a>. During these conflicts, the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi, distant cousins of the Western Chalukyas but related to the Cholas by marriage took sides with the Cholas further complicating the situation. During the rule of <a href="Vikramaditya%20VI">Vikramaditya VI</a>, in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, the Western Chalukyas convincingly contended with the Cholas and reached a peak ruling territories that spread over most of the Deccan, between the <a href="Narmada%20River">Narmada River</a> in the north and <a href="Kaveri%20River">Kaveri River</a> in the south. His exploits were not limited to the south for even as a prince, during the rule of Someshvara I, he had led successful military campaigns as far east as modern <a href="Bihar">Bihar</a> and <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a>. During this period the other major ruling families of the Deccan, the <a href="Hoysalas">Hoysalas</a>, the <a href="Seuna%20Yadavas%20of%20Devagiri">Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri</a>, the <a href="Kakatiya%20dynasty">Kakatiya dynasty</a> and the Southern <a href="Kalachuris%20of%20Kalyani">Kalachuris of Kalyani</a>, were subordinates of the Western Chalukyas and gained their independence only when the power of the Chalukya waned during the later half of the 12th century.

The Western Chalukyas developed an <a href="Western%20Chalukya%20architecture">architectural style</a> known today as a transitional style, an architectural link between the style of the early Chalukya dynasty and that of the later Hoysala empire. Most of its monuments are in the districts bordering the <a href="Tungabhadra%20River">Tungabhadra River</a> in central Karnataka. Well known examples are the <a href="Kasivisvesvara%20Temple">Kasivisvesvara Temple</a> at <a href="Lakkundi">Lakkundi</a>, the <a href="Mallikarjuna%20Temple%2C%20Kuruvatti">Mallikarjuna Temple</a> at Kuruvatti, the <a href="Kalleshvara%20Temple%2C%20Bagali">Kallesvara Temple</a> at Bagali and the <a href="Mahadeva%20Temple%20%28Itagi%29">Mahadeva Temple</a> at Itagi. This was an important period in the development of fine arts in Southern India, especially in literature as the Western Chalukya kings encouraged writers in the native language <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a>, and <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>.

Knowledge of Western Chalukya history has come through examination of the numerous Kannada language <a href="Epigraphy">inscriptions</a> left by the kings (scholars <a href="Sheldon%20Pollock">Sheldon Pollock</a> and Jan Houben have claimed 90 percent of the Chalukyan royal inscriptions are in Kannada), and from the study of important contemporary literary documents in <a href="Western%20Chalukya%20literature">Western Chalukya literature</a> such as "Gada Yuddha" (982) in Kannada by <a href="Ranna%20%28Kannada%20poet%29">Ranna</a> and "Vikramankadeva Charitam" (1120) in Sanskrit by <a href="Bilhana">Bilhana</a>. The earliest record is dated 957, during the rule of <a href="Tailapa%20II">Tailapa II</a> when the Western Chalukyas were still a feudatory of the Rashtrakutas and Tailapa II governed from Tardavadi in present-day <a href="Bijapur%20district%2C%20Karnataka">Bijapur district</a>, <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>. The genealogy of the kings of this empire is still debated. One theory, based on contemporary literary and inscriptional evidence plus the finding that the Western Chalukyas employed titles and names commonly used by the early Chalukyas, suggests that the Western Chalukya kings belonged to the same family line as the illustrious Badami <a href="Chalukya">Chalukya</a> dynasty of 6th-century, while other Western Chalukya inscriptional evidence indicates they were a distinct line unrelated to the early Chalukyas.

The records suggests a possible rebellion by a local Chalukya King, Chattigadeva of <a href="Banavasi">Banavasi-12000</a> province (c. 967), in alliance with local <a href="Kadamba%20dynasty">Kadamba</a> chieftains. This rebellion however was unfruitful but paved the way for his successor Tailapa II. A few years later, Tailapa II re-established Chalukya rule and defeated the Rashtrakutas during the reign of <a href="Karka%20II">Karka II</a> by timing his rebellion to coincide with the confusion caused in the Rashtrakuta capital of Manyakheta by the invading Paramaras of Central India in 973. After overpowering the Rashtrakutas, Tailapa II moved his capital to Manyakheta and consolidated the Chalukya empire in the western Deccan by subjugating the Paramara and other aggressive rivals and extending his control over the land between the Narmada River and Tungabhadra River. However, some inscriptions indicate that Balagamve in Mysore territory may have been a power centre up to the rule of Someshvara I in 1042.

The intense competition between the kingdom of the western Deccan and those of the <a href="Ancient%20Tamil%20country">Tamil country</a> came to the fore in the 11th century over the acutely contested fertile river valleys in the <a href="doab">doab</a> region of the <a href="Krishna%20River">Krishna</a> and <a href="Godavari%20River">Godavari River</a> called <a href="Vengi">Vengi</a> (modern coastal <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>). The Western Chalukyas and the <a href="Chola%20Dynasty">Chola Dynasty</a> fought many bitter wars over control of this strategic resource. The imperial Cholas gained power during the time of the famous king <a href="Rajaraja%20Chola%20I">Rajaraja Chola I</a> and the crown prince <a href="Rajendra%20Chola%20I">Rajendra Chola I</a>. The Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi were cousins of the Western Chalukyas but became increasingly influenced by the Cholas through their marital ties with the Tamil kingdom. As this was against the interests of the Western Chalukyas, they wasted no time in involving themselves politically and militarily in Vengi. When King <a href="Satyashraya">Satyashraya</a> succeeded Tailapa II to the throne, he was able to protect his kingdom from Chola aggression as well as his northern territories in <a href="Konkan">Konkan</a> and <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> although his control over Vengi was shaky. His successor, <a href="Jayasimha%20II%20%28Western%20Chalukya%20dynasty%29">Jayasimha II</a>, fought many battles with the Cholas in the south around c. 1020–21 when both these powerful kingdoms struggled to choose the Vengi king. Shortly thereafter in c. 1024, Jayasimha II subdued the Paramara of central India and the rebellious Yadava King Bhillama.
It is known from records that Jayasimha's son <a href="Someshvara%20I">Someshvara I</a>, whose rule historian Sen considers a brilliant period in the Western Chalukya rule, moved the Chalukya capital to Kalyani in c. 1042. Hostilities with the Cholas continued while both sides won and lost battles, though neither lost significant territory during the ongoing struggle to install a puppet on the Vengi throne. In 1068 Someshvara I, suffering from an incurable illness, drowned himself in the Tungabhadra River ("Paramayoga"). Despite many conflicts with the Cholas in the south, Someshvara I had managed to maintain control over the northern territories in Konkan, Gujarat, <a href="Malwa">Malwa</a> and <a href="Kalinga%20%28historical%20region%29">Kalinga</a> during his rule. His successor, his eldest son <a href="Someshvara%20II">Someshvara II</a>, feuded with his younger brother, <a href="Vikramaditya%20VI">Vikramaditya VI</a>, an ambitious warrior who had initially been governor of <a href="Mysore%20State">Gangavadi</a> in the southern Deccan when Someshvara II was the king. Before 1068, even as a prince, <a href="Vikramaditya%20VI">Vikramaditya VI</a> had invaded <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a>, weakening the ruling <a href="Pala%20Empire">Pala Empire</a>. These incursions led to the establishment of "Karnata" dynasties such as the <a href="Sena%20dynasty">Sena dynasty</a> and Varman dynasty in Bengal, and the Nayanadeva dynasty in Bihar., Married to a Chola princess (a daughter of Vira Rajendra Chola), Vikramaditya VI maintained a friendly alliance with them. After the death of the Chola king in 1070, Vikramaditya VI invaded the Tamil kingdom and installed his brother-in-law, <a href="Athirajendra%20Chola">Adhirajendra</a>, on the throne creating conflict with <a href="Kulothunga%20Chola%20I">Kulothunga Chola I</a>, the powerful ruler of Vengi who sought the Chola throne for himself. At the same time Vikramaditya VI undermined his brother, Someshvara II, by winning the loyalty of the Chalukya feudatories: the Hoysala, the Seuna and the <a href="Kadambas">Kadambas</a> of Hangal. Anticipating a civil war, Someshvara II sought help from Vikramaditya VI's enemies, Kulothunga Chola I and the Kadambas of <a href="Goa">Goa</a>. In the ensuing conflict of 1076, Vikramaditya VI emerged victorious and proclaimed himself king of the Chalukya empire.

The fifty-year reign of Vikramaditya VI, the most successful of the later Chalukya rulers, was an important period in Karnataka's history and is referred to by historians as the "Chalukya Vikrama era". Not only was he successful in controlling his powerful feudatories in the north (Kadamba Jayakesi II of Goa, Silhara Bhoja and the Yadava King) and south (Hoysala Vishnuvardhana), he successfully dealt with the imperial Cholas whom he defeated in the battle of Vengi in 1093 and again in 1118. He retained this territory for many years despite ongoing hostilities with the Cholas. This victory in Vengi reduced the Chola influence in the eastern Deccan and made him emperor of territories stretching from the Kaveri River in the south to the Narmada River in the north, earning him the titles "Permadideva" and "Tribhuvanamalla" (lord of three worlds). The scholars of his time paid him glowing tributes for his military leadership, interest in fine arts and religious tolerance. Literature proliferated and scholars in Kannada and Sanskrit adorned his court. Poet Bilhana, who immigrated from far away <a href="Kashmir">Kashmir</a>, eulogised the king in his well-known work "Vikramankadeva Charita". Vikramaditya VI was not only an able warrior but also a devout king as indicated by his numerous inscriptions that record grants made to scholars and centers of religion.
The continual warring with the Cholas exhausted both empires, giving their subordinates the opportunity to rebel. In the decades after Vikramaditya VI's death in 1126, the empire steadily decreased in size as their powerful feudatories expanded in autonomy and territorial command. The time period between 1150 and 1200 saw many hard fought battles between the Chalukyas and their feudatories who were also at war with each other. By the time of <a href="Jagadhekamalla%20II">Jagadhekamalla II</a>, the Chalukyas had lost control of Vengi and his successor, <a href="Tailapa%20III">Tailapa III</a>, was defeated by the Kakatiya king Prola in 1149. Tailapa III was taken captive and later released bringing down the prestige of the Western Chalukyas. Seeing decadence and uncertainty seeping into Chalukya rule, the Hoysalas and <a href="Seuna%20Yadavas%20of%20Devagiri">Seunas</a> also encroached upon the empire. Hoysala <a href="Narasimha%20I">Narasimha I</a> defeated and killed Tailapa III but was unable to overcome the Kalachuris who were vying for control of the same region. In 1157 the <a href="Kalachuris%20of%20Kalyani">Kalachuris of Kalyani</a>s under <a href="Bijjala%20II">Bijjala II</a> captured Kalyani and occupied it for the next twenty years, forcing the Chalukyas to move their capital to <a href="Annigeri">Annigeri</a> in the present day <a href="Dharwad%20district">Dharwad district</a>.

The Kalachuris were originally immigrants into the southern Deccan from central India and called themselves "Kalanjarapuravaradhisavaras". Bijjala II and his ancestors had governed as Chalukya commanders ("Mahamandaleshwar") over the Karhad-4000 and Tardavadi-1000 provinces (overlapping region in present-day Karnataka and Maharashtra) with Mangalavada or Annigeri as their capital. Bijjala II's Chikkalagi record of 1157 calls him "Mahabhujabala Chakravarti" ("emperor with powerful shoulders and arms") indicating he no longer was a subordinate of the Chalukyas. However the successors of Bijjala II were unable to hold on to Kalyani and their rule ended in 1183 when the last Chalukya scion, <a href="Someshvara%20IV">Someshvara IV</a> made a final bid to regain the empire by recapturing Kalyani. Kalachuri King Sankama was killed by Chalukya general Narasimha in this conflict. During this time, Hoysala <a href="Veera%20Ballala%20II">Veera Ballala II</a> was growing ambitious and clashed on several occasions with the Chalukyas and the other claimants over their empire. He defeated Chalukya Someshvara IV and Seuna Bhillama V bringing large regions in the Krishna River valley under the Hoysala domains, but was unsuccessful against Kalachuris. The Seunas under Bhillama V were on an imperialistic expansion too when the Chalukyas regained Kalyani. Their ambitions were temporarily stemmed by their defeat against Chalukya general Barma in 1183 but they later had their vengeance in 1189.

The overall effort by Someshvara IV to rebuild the Chalukya empire failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Someshvara IV into exile in <a href="Banavasi">Banavasi</a> 1189. After the fall of the Chalukyas, the Seunas and Hoysalas continued warring over the Krishna River region in 1191, each inflicting a defeat on the other at various points in time. This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western Deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.

The Western Chalukya kingship was hereditary, passing to the king's brother if the king did not have a male heir. The administration was highly decentralised and feudatory clans such as the <a href="Alupas">Alupas</a>, the Hoysalas, the Kakatiya, the Seuna, the southern Kalachuri and others were allowed to rule their autonomous provinces, paying an annual tribute to the Chalukya emperor. Excavated inscriptions record titles such as "Mahapradhana" (Chief minister), "Sandhivigrahika", and "Dharmadhikari" (chief justice). Some positions such as "Tadeyadandanayaka" (commander of reserve army) were specialised in function while all ministerial positions included the role of "Dandanayaka" (commander), showing that cabinet members were trained as army commanders as well as in general administrative skills.

The kingdom was divided into provinces such as "Banavasi-12000", "Nolambavadi-32000", "Gangavadi-96000", each name including the number of villages under its jurisdiction. The large provinces were divided into smaller provinces containing a lesser number of villages, as in "Belavola-300". The big provinces were called "Mandala" and under them were "Nadu" further divided into "Kampanas" (groups of villages) and finally a "Bada" (village). A "Mandala" was under a member of the royal family, a trusted feudatory or a senior official. <a href="Tailapa%20II">Tailapa II</a> himself was in charge of Tardavadi province during the <a href="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a> rule. Chiefs of "Mandalas" were transferable based on political developments. For example, an official named Bammanayya administered Banavasi-12000 under King Someshvara III but was later transferred to Halasige-12000. Women from the royal family also administered "Nadus" and "Kampanas". Army commanders were titled "Mahamandaleshwaras" and those who headed a "Nadu" were entitled "Nadugouvnda".

The Western Chalukyas minted punch-marked gold <a href="pagoda%20%28coin%29">pagodas</a> with Kannada and <a href="Devanagari">Nagari</a> legends which were large, thin gold coins with several varying punch marks on the obverse side. They usually carried multiple punches of symbols such as a stylised lion, "Sri" in Kannada, a spearhead, the king's title, a lotus and others. Jayasimha II used the legend "Sri Jaya", Someshvara I issued coins with "Sri Tre lo ka malla", Someshvara II used "Bhuvaneka malla", Lakshmideva's coin carried "Sri Lasha", and Jagadhekamalla II coinage had the legend "Sri Jagade". The Alupas, a feudatory, minted coins with the <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> and "<a href="Devanagari">Nagari</a>" legend "Sri Pandya Dhanamjaya". <a href="Lakkundi">Lakkundi</a> in <a href="Gadag%20district">Gadag district</a> and Sudi in <a href="Dharwad%20district">Dharwad district</a> were the main mints ("Tankhashaley"). Their heaviest gold coin was Gadyanaka weighting 96 <a href="Grain%20%28measure%29">grains</a>, Dramma weighted 65 grains, Kalanju 48 grains, Kasu 15 grains, Manjadi 2.5 grains, Akkam 1.25 grains and Pana 9.6 grain.

Agriculture was the empire's main source of income through taxes on land and produce. The majority of the people lived in villages and worked farming the staple crops of <a href="rice">rice</a>, <a href="Pulse%20%28legume%29">pulses</a>, and <a href="cotton">cotton</a> in the dry areas and sugarcane in areas having sufficient rainfall, with <a href="areca">areca</a> and <a href="betel">betel</a> being the chief cash crops. The living conditions of the labourers who farmed the land must have been bearable as there are no records of revolts by the landless against wealthy landlords. If peasants were disgruntled the common practice was to migrate in large numbers out of the jurisdiction of the ruler who was mistreating them, thereby depriving him of revenue from their labor.

Taxes were levied on mining and forest products, and additional income was raised through tolls for the use of transportation facilities. The state also collected fees from customs, professional licenses, and judicial fines. Records show horses and salt were taxed as well as commodities (gold, textiles, perfumes) and agricultural produce (black pepper, paddy, spices, betel leaves, palm leaves, coconuts and sugar). Land tax assessment was based on frequent surveys evaluating the quality of land and the type of produce. Chalukya records specifically mention black soil and red soil lands in addition to wetland, dry land and wasteland in determining taxation rates.

Key figures mentioned in inscriptions from rural areas were the Gavundas (officials) or <a href="Gowda%20%28caste%29">Goudas</a>. The Gavundas belonged to two levels of economic strata, the "Praja Gavunda" (people's Gavunda) and the "<a href="Prabhu">Prabhu</a> Gavunda" (lord of Gavundas). They served the dual purpose of representing the people before the rulers as well as functioning as state appointees for tax collection and the raising of militias. They are mentioned in inscriptions related to land transactions, irrigation maintenance, village tax collection and village council duties.

The organisation of corporate enterprises became common in the 11th century. Almost all arts and crafts were organised into guilds and work was done on a corporate basis; records do not mention individual artists, sculptors and craftsman. Only in the regions ruled by the Hoysala did individual sculptors etched their names below their creations.
Merchants organised themselves into powerful <a href="guild">guild</a>s that transcended political divisions, allowing their operations to be largely unaffected by wars and revolutions. Their only threat was the possibility of theft from <a href="Piracy">brigands</a> when their ships and caravans traveled to distant lands. Powerful South Indian merchant guilds included the "<a href="Manigramam">Manigramam</a>", the "<a href="Nagarattar">Nagarattar</a>" and the "<a href="Anjuvannam">Anjuvannam</a>". Local guilds were called "nagaram", while the "<a href="Nanadesis">Nanadesis</a>" were traders from neighbouring kingdoms who perhaps mixed business with pleasure. The wealthiest and most influential and celebrated of all South Indian merchant guilds was the self-styled "<a href="Ainnurruvar">Ainnurruvar</a>", also known as the 500 "Svamis" of Ayyavolepura (<a href="Brahmins">Brahmins</a> and "<a href="Mahajanas">Mahajanas</a>" of present-day <a href="Aihole">Aihole</a>), who conducted extensive land and sea trade and thereby contributed significantly to the total foreign trade of the empire. It fiercely protected its trade obligations ("Vira Bananjudharma" or law of the noble merchants) and its members often recorded their achievements in <a href="Epigraphy">inscriptions</a> ("<a href="prashasti">prasasti</a>"). Five hundred such excavated "Prasasti" inscriptions, with their own flag and emblem, the bull, record their pride in their business.

Rich traders contributed significantly to the king's treasury through paying import and export taxes. The edicts of the Aihole "Svamis" mention trade ties with foreign kingdoms such as <a href="Chera%20dynasty">Chera</a>, <a href="Pandya">Pandya</a>, Maleya (<a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>), <a href="Magadh">Magadh</a>, <a href="Kosala">Kaushal</a>, <a href="Saurashtra%20%28region%29">Saurashtra</a>, Kurumba, Kambhoja (<a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>), <a href="Lata%20%28region%29">Lata</a> (<a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>), Parasa (<a href="Persia">Persia</a>) and <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>. Travelling both land and sea routes, these merchants traded mostly in precious stones, spices and perfumes, and other specialty items such as camphor. Business flourished in precious stones such as diamonds, <a href="lapis%20lazuli">lapis lazuli</a>, <a href="onyx">onyx</a>, <a href="topaz">topaz</a>, <a href="Carbuncle%20%28gemstone%29">carbuncles</a> and <a href="emeralds">emeralds</a>. Commonly traded spices were cardamom, saffron, and cloves, while perfumes included the by-products of sandalwood, <a href="bdellium">bdellium</a>, musk, <a href="civet">civet</a> and rose. These items were sold either in bulk or hawked on streets by local merchants in towns. The Western Chalukyas controlled most of South India's west coast and by the 10th century they had established extensive trade ties with the <a href="Tang%20Empire">Tang Empire</a> of <a href="China">China</a>, the empires of <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> and the <a href="Abbasid">Abbasid Caliphate</a> in <a href="Bhagdad">Bhagdad</a>, and by the 12th century Chinese fleets were frequenting Indian ports. Exports to <a href="Song%20Dynasty">Song Dynasty</a> China included textiles, spices, medicinal plants, jewels, ivory, rhino horn, ebony and camphor. The same products also reached ports in the west such as <a href="Dhofar">Dhofar</a> and <a href="Aden">Aden</a>. The final destinations for those trading with the west were Persia, Arabia and Egypt. The thriving trade center of <a href="Siraf">Siraf</a>, a port on the eastern coast of the Persian Gulf, served an international clientele of merchants including those from the Chalukya empire who were feasted by wealthy local merchants during business visits. An indicator of the Indian merchants' importance in Siraf comes from records describing dining plates reserved for them. In addition to this, Siraf received <a href="aloe">aloe</a> wood, perfumes, sandalwood and condiments. The most expensive import to South India were Arabian horse shipments, this trade being monopolised by Arabs and local Brahmin merchants. Traveller <a href="Marco%20Polo">Marco Polo</a>, in the 13th century, recorded that the breeding of horses never succeeded in India due to differing climatic, soil and grassland conditions.

The fall of the Rashtrakuta empire to the Western Chalukyas in the 10th century, coinciding with the defeat of the <a href="Western%20Ganga%20Dynasty">Western Ganga Dynasty</a> by the Cholas in <a href="Mysore%20State">Gangavadi</a>, was a setback to <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a>. The growth of <a href="Virashaivism">Virashaivism</a> in the Chalukya territory and <a href="Vaishnavism">Vaishnava Hinduism</a> in the Hoysala region paralleled a general decreased interest in Jainism, although the succeeding kingdoms continued to be religiously tolerant. Two locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory continued to be patronaged, <a href="Shravanabelagola">Shravanabelagola</a> and <a href="Kambadahalli">Kambadahalli</a>. The decline of Buddhism in South India had begun in the 8th century with the spread of <a href="Adi%20Shankara">Adi Shankara</a>'s <a href="Advaita">Advaita</a> philosophy. The only places of Buddhist worship that remained during the Western Chalukya rule were at <a href="Dambal">Dambal</a> and <a href="Balligavi">Balligavi</a>. There is no mention of religious conflict in the writings and inscriptions of the time which suggest the religious transition was smooth.

Although the origin of the Virashaiva faith has been debated, the movement grew through its association with <a href="Basavanna">Basavanna</a> in the 12th century. Basavanna and other Virashaiva saints preached of a faith without a <a href="caste%20system">caste system</a>. In his <a href="Vachanas">Vachanas</a> (a form of poetry), Basavanna appealed to the masses in simple Kannada and wrote "work is worship" (Kayakave Kailasa). Also known as the <a href="Lingayats">Lingayats</a> (worshipers of the "Linga", the universal symbol of Shiva), these Virashaivas questioned many of the established norms of society such as the belief in rituals and the theory of rebirth and supported the remarriage of widows and the marriage of unwed older women. This gave more social freedom to women but they were not accepted into the priesthood. <a href="Ramanujacharya">Ramanujacharya</a>, the head of the Vaishnava monastery in <a href="Srirangam">Srirangam</a>, traveled to the Hoysala territory and preached the way of devotion (<a href="bhakti">bhakti marga</a>). He later wrote "Sribhashya", a commentary on Badarayana <a href="Brahmasutra">Brahmasutra</a>, a critique on the <a href="Advaita">Advaita</a> philosophy of Adi Shankara. Ramanujacharya's stay in <a href="Melkote">Melkote</a> resulted in the Hoysala King <a href="Vishnuvardhana">Vishnuvardhana</a> converting to Vaishnavism, a faith that his successors also followed.

The impact of these religious developments on the culture, literature, and architecture in South India was profound. Important works of metaphysics and poetry based on the teachings of these philosophers were written over the next centuries. <a href="Akka%20Mahadevi">Akka Mahadevi</a>, <a href="Allama%20Prabhu">Allama Prabhu</a>, and a host of Basavanna's followers, including Chenna Basava, Prabhudeva, Siddharama, and Kondaguli Kesiraja wrote hundreds of poems called <a href="Vachanas">Vachanas</a> in praise of <a href="Lord%20Shiva">Lord Shiva</a>. The esteemed scholars in the Hoysala court, <a href="Harihara%20%28poet%29">Harihara</a> and <a href="Raghavanka">Raghavanka</a>, were Virashaivas. This tradition continued into the <a href="Vijayanagar%20empire">Vijayanagar empire</a> with such well-known scholars as Singiraja, Mallanarya, Lakkana Dandesa and other prolific writers of Virashaiva literature. The Saluva, Tuluva and Aravidu dynasties of the Vijayanagar empire were followers of Vaishnavism and a Vaishnava temple with an image of Ramanujacharya exists today in the Vitthalapura area of Vijayanagara. Scholars in the succeeding Mysore Kingdom wrote Vaishnavite works supporting the teachings of Ramanujacharya. King Vishnuvardhana built many temples after his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism.

The rise of <a href="Veerashaiva">Veerashaiva</a>ism was revolutionary and challenged the prevailing <a href="Hindu%20caste%20system">Hindu caste system</a> which retained royal support. The social role of women largely depended on their economic status and level of education in this relatively liberal period. Freedom was more available to women in the royal and affluent urban families. Records describe the participation of women in the fine arts, such as Chalukya queen Chandala Devi's and <a href="Kalachuris%20of%20Kalyani">Kalachuris of Kalyani</a> queen Sovala Devi's skill in dance and music. The compositions of thirty <a href="Vachana">Vachana</a> women poets included the work of the 12th-century <a href="Virashaiva">Virashaiva</a> mystic Akka Mahadevi whose devotion to the "<a href="bhakti">bhakti</a>" movement is well known. Contemporary records indicate some royal women were involved in administrative and martial affairs such as princess Akkadevi, (sister of King Jayasimha II) who fought and defeated rebellious feudals. Inscriptions emphasise public acceptance of widowhood indicating that <a href="Sati%20%28practice%29">Sati</a> (a custom in which a dead man's widow used to <a href="Self-immolation">immolate</a> herself on her husband's funeral <a href="pyre">pyre</a>) though present was on a voluntary basis. Ritual deaths to achieve salvation were seen among the <a href="Jainism">Jains</a> who preferred to fast to death (<a href="Sallekhana">Sallekhana</a>), while people of some other communities chose to jump on spikes ("Shoolabrahma") or walking into fire on an eclipse.

In a Hindu caste system that was conspicuously present, <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a>s enjoyed a privileged position as providers of knowledge and local justice. These Brahmins were normally involved in careers that revolved around religion and learning with the exception of a few who achieved success in martial affairs. They were patronised by kings, nobles and wealthy aristocrats who persuaded learned Brahmins to settle in specific towns and villages by making them grants of land and houses. The relocation of Brahmin scholars was calculated to be in the interest of the kingdom as they were viewed as persons detached from wealth and power and their knowledge was a useful tool to educate and teach ethical conduct and discipline in local communities. Brahmins were also actively involved in solving local problems by functioning as neutral arbiters ("Panchayat").

Regarding eating habits, Brahmins, Jains, Buddhists and Shaivas were strictly vegetarian while the partaking of different kinds of meat was popular among other communities. Marketplace vendors sold meat from domesticated animals such as goats, sheep, pigs and fowl as well as exotic meat including partridge, hare, wild fowl and boar. People found indoor amusement by attending wrestling matches ("Kusti") or watching animals fight such as cock fights and ram fights or by gambling. Horse racing was a popular outdoor pastime. In addition to these leisurely activities, festivals and fairs were frequent and entertainment by traveling troupes of acrobats, dancers, dramatists and musicians was often provided.

Schools and hospitals are mentioned in records and these were built in the vicinity of temples. Marketplaces served as open air town halls where people gathered to discuss and ponder local issues. Choirs, whose main function was to sing devotional hymns, were maintained at temple expense. Young men were trained to sing in choirs in schools attached to monasteries such as Hindu "<a href="Matha">Matha</a>", Jain "Palli" and Buddhist "<a href="Vihara">Vihara</a>". These institutions provided advanced education in religion and ethics and were well equipped with libraries ("Saraswati Bhandara"). Learning was imparted in the local language and in Sanskrit. Schools of higher learning were called "Brahmapuri" (or "Ghatika" or "Agrahara"). Teaching Sanskrit was a near monopoly of Brahmins who received royal endowments for their cause. Inscriptions record that the number of subjects taught varied from four to eighteen. The four most popular subjects with royal students were Economics ("Vartta"), Political Science ("Dandaniti"), Veda ("trayi") and Philosophy ("<a href="Anviksiki">Anvikshiki</a>"), subjects that are mentioned as early as <a href="Kautilya">Kautilya</a>s <a href="Arthashastra">Arthashastra</a>.

The Western Chalukya era was one of substantial literary activity in the native Kannada, and Sanskrit. In a golden age of Kannada literature, <a href="Jain">Jain</a> scholars wrote about the life of <a href="Tirthankaras">Tirthankaras</a> and <a href="Virashaiva">Virashaiva</a> poets expressed their closeness to God through pithy poems called <a href="Vachanas">Vachanas</a>. Nearly three hundred contemporary "Vachanakaras" ("Vachana" poets) including thirty women poets have been recorded. Early works by <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a> writers were on the epics, <a href="Ramayana">Ramayana</a>, <a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>, <a href="Bhagavata">Bhagavata</a>, <a href="Puranas">Puranas</a> and <a href="Vedas">Vedas</a>. In the field of secular literature, subjects such as romance, erotics, medicine, lexicon, mathematics, astrology, encyclopedia etc. were written for the first time.

Most notable among Kannada scholars were <a href="Ranna%20%28Kannada%20poet%29">Ranna</a>, grammarian <a href="Nagavarma%20II">Nagavarma II</a>, minister <a href="Durgasimha">Durgasimha</a> and the Virashaiva saint and social reformer <a href="Basavanna">Basavanna</a>. Ranna who was patronised by king Tailapa II and Satyashraya is one among the "three gems of Kannada literature". He was bestowed the title "Emperor among poets" ("Kavi Chakravathi") by King Tailapa II and has five major works to his credit. Of these, "Saahasabheema Vijayam" (or "Gada yuddha") of 982 in "Champu" style is a eulogy of his patron King Satyashraya whom he compares to Bhima in valour and achievements and narrates the duel between <a href="Bhima">Bhima</a> and <a href="Duryodhana">Duryodhana</a> using clubs on the eighteenth day of the <a href="Kurukshetra%20War">Mahabharata war</a>. He wrote "<a href="Ajitha%20purana">Ajitha purana</a>" in 993 describing the life of the second <a href="Tirthankara">Tirthankara</a>, Ajitanatha.

Nagavarma II, poet laureate ("Katakacharya") of King Jagadhekamalla II made contributions to Kannada literature in various subjects. His works in poetry, prosody, grammar and vocabulary are standard authorities and their importance to the study of Kannada language is well acknowledged. "Kavyavalokana" in poetics, "Karnataka-Bhashabhushana" on grammar and "Vastukosa" a lexicon (with Kannada equivalents for Sanskrit words) are some of his comprehensive contributions. Several works on medicine were produced during this period. Notable among them were Jagaddala Somanatha's "Karnataka Kalyana Karaka".

A unique and native form of poetic literature in Kannada called <a href="Vachanas">Vachanas</a> developed during this time. They were written by mystics, who expressed their devotion to God in simple poems that could appeal to the masses. Basavanna, <a href="Akka%20Mahadevi">Akka Mahadevi</a>, <a href="Allama%20Prabhu">Allama Prabhu</a>, <a href="Channabasavanna">Channabasavanna</a> and <a href="Siddheshwar">Siddharama</a> are the best known among them.

In Sanskrit, a well-known poem ("<a href="Mahakavya">Mahakavya</a>") in 18 cantos called "Vikramankadeva Charita" by Kashmiri poet <a href="Bilhana">Bilhana</a> recounts in epic style the life and achievements of his patron king Vikramaditya VI. The work narrates the episode of Vikramaditya VI's accession to the Chalukya throne after overthrowing his elder brother Someshvara II. The great Indian mathematician <a href="Bh%C4%81skara%20II">Bhāskara II</a> (born c.1114) flourished during this time. From his own account in his famous work "Siddhanta Siromani" (c. 1150, comprising the "Lilavati", "Bijaganita" on algebra, "Goladhaya" on the celestial globe and "Grahaganita" on planets) Bijjada Bida (modern <a href="Bijapur%20district%2C%20Karnataka">Bijapur</a>) was his native place.

"<a href="Manasollasa">Manasollasa</a>" or "Abhilashitartha Chintamani" by king <a href="Someshvara%20III">Someshvara III</a> (1129) was a Sanskrit work intended for all sections of society. This is an example of an early encyclopedia in Sanskrit covering many subjects including medicine, magic, veterinary science, valuing of precious stones and pearls, fortifications, painting, music, games, amusements etc. While the book does not give any of dealt topics particular hierarchy of importance, it serves as a landmark in understanding the state of knowledge in those subjects at that time. Someshwara III also authored a biography of his famous father Vikramaditya VI called Vikraman-Kabhyudaya. The text is a historical prose narrative which also includes a graphic description of the geography and people of <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>.

A Sanskrit scholar <a href="Vijnaneshwara">Vijnaneshwara</a> became famous in the field of legal literature for his "<a href="Mitakshara">Mitakshara</a>", in the court of Vikramaditya VI. Perhaps the most acknowledged work in that field, Mitakshara is a treatise on law (commentary on "Yajnavalkya") based on earlier writings and has found acceptance in most parts of modern India. An <a href="Englishman">Englishman</a> Colebrooke later translated into <a href="English%20language">English</a> the section on inheritance giving it currency in the British Indian court system. Some important literary works of the time related to music and musical instruments were "Sangita Chudamani", "Sangita Samayasara" and "Sangita Ratnakara".

The reign of Western Chalukya dynasty was an important period in the development of Deccan architecture. The architecture designed during this time served as a conceptual link between the <a href="Badami%20Chalukya%20Architecture">Badami Chalukya Architecture</a> of the 8th century and the <a href="Hoysala%20architecture">Hoysala architecture</a> popularised in the 13th century. The art of the Western Chalukyas is sometimes called the "<a href="Gadag">Gadag</a> style" after the number of ornate temples they built in the Tungabhadra River-Krishna River <a href="doab">doab</a> region of present-day <a href="Gadag%20district">Gadag district</a> in Karnataka. The dynasty's temple building activity reached its maturity and culmination in the 12th century with over a hundred temples built across the Deccan, more than half of them in present-day central Karnataka. Apart from temples, the dynasty's architecture is well known for the ornate stepped wells ("Pushkarni") which served as ritual bathing places, a few of which are well preserved in Lakkundi. These stepped well designs were later incorporated by the Hoysalas and the Vijayanagara empire in the coming centuries.

The <a href="Kasivisvesvara%20Temple">Kasivisvesvara Temple</a> at Lakkundi (Gadag district), the <a href="Dodda%20Basappa%20Temple">Dodda Basappa Temple</a> at <a href="Dambal">Dambal</a> (Gadag district), the <a href="Mallikarjuna%20Temple%2C%20Kuruvatti">Mallikarjuna Temple</a> at Kuruvatti (<a href="Bellary%20district">Bellary district</a>), the <a href="Kalleshvara%20Temple%2C%20Bagali">Kallesvara Temple</a> at Bagali (<a href="Davangere%20district">Davangere district</a>), the <a href="Siddhesvara%20Temple">Siddhesvara Temple</a> at <a href="Haveri">Haveri</a> (<a href="Haveri%20district">Haveri district</a>), the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri (<a href="Dharwad%20district">Dharwad district</a>), the <a href="Mahadeva%20Temple%20%28Itagi%29">Mahadeva Temple</a> at Itagi (<a href="Koppal%20district">Koppal district</a>), the <a href="Kaitabheshvara%20Temple%2C%20Kubatur">Kaitabheshvara Temple</a> at Kubatur, and the <a href="Kedareshvara%20Temple%2C%20Balligavi">Kedareshvara Temple</a> at <a href="Balligavi">Balligavi</a> are the finest examples produced by the later Chalukya architects. The 12th-century Mahadeva Temple with its well executed sculptures is an exquisite example of decorative detail. The intricate, finely crafted carvings on walls, pillars and towers speak volumes about Chalukya taste and culture. An inscription outside the temple calls it "Emperor of Temples" ("devalaya chakravarti") and relates that it was built by Mahadeva, a commander in the army of king Vikramaditya VI. The Kedareswara Temple (1060) at <a href="Balligavi">Balligavi</a> is an example of a transitional Chalukya-Hoysala architectural style. The Western Chalukyas built temples in <a href="Badami">Badami</a> and <a href="Aihole">Aihole</a> during their early phase of temple building activity, such as Mallikarjuna Temple, the Yellamma Temple and the <a href="Bhutanatha%20group">Bhutanatha group of Temples</a>.
The "<a href="vimana%20%28tower%29">vimana</a>" of their temples (tower over the shrine) is a compromise in detail between the plain stepped style of the early Chalukyas and the decorative finish of the Hoysalas. To the credit of the Western Chalukya architects is the development of the <a href="lathe">lathe</a> turned (tuned) pillars and use of <a href="Soapstone">Soapstone</a> (Chloritic Schist) as basic building and sculptural material, a very popular idiom in later Hoysala temples. They popularised the use of decorative "<a href="Kirtimukha">Kirtimukha</a>" (demon faces) in their sculptures. Famous architects in the Hoysala kingdom included Chalukyan architects who were natives of places such as Balligavi. The artistic wall decor and the general sculptural idiom was <a href="dravidian%20architecture">dravidian architecture</a>. This style is sometimes called "Karnata dravida", one of the notable traditions in Indian architecture.

The local language Kannada was mostly used in Western (Kalyani) Chalukya inscriptions and epigraphs. Some historians assert that ninety percent of their inscriptions are in the Kannada language while the remaining are in Sanskrit language. More inscriptions in Kannada are attributed to Vikramaditya VI than any other king prior to the 12th century, many of which have been deciphered and translated by historians of the Archaeological Survey of India. Inscriptions were generally either on stone ("Shilashasana") or copper plates ("Tamarashasana"). This period saw the growth of Kannada as a language of literature and poetry, impetus to which came from the devotional movement of the Virashaivas (called <a href="Lingayatism">Lingayatism</a>) who expressed their closeness to their deity in the form of simple lyrics called Vachanas. At an administrative level, the regional language was used to record locations and rights related to land grants. When bilingual inscriptions were written, the section stating the title, genealogy, origin myths of the king and benedictions were generally done in Sanskrit. Kannada was used to state terms of the grants, including information on the land, its boundaries, the participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues, and witnesses. This ensured the content was clearly understood by the local people without any ambiguity.

In addition to inscriptions, chronicles called "Vamshavalis" were written to provide historical details of dynasties. Writings in Sanskrit included poetry, grammar, lexicon, manuals, rhetoric, commentaries on older works, prose fiction and drama. In Kannada, writings on secular subjects became popular. Some well-known works are "Chandombudhi", a prosody, and "Karnataka Kadambari", a romance, both written by <a href="Nagavarma%20I">Nagavarma I</a>, a lexicon called "Rannakanda" by Ranna (993), a book on medicine called "Karnataka-Kalyanakaraka" by Jagaddala Somanatha, the earliest writing on astrology called "Jatakatilaka" by Sridharacharya (1049), a writing on erotics called "Madanakatilaka" by Chandraraja, and an encyclopedia called "Lokapakara" by Chavundaraya II (1025).

Atomic line filter

An atomic line filter (ALF) is an advanced <a href="optical%20filter">optical</a> <a href="band-pass%20filter">band-pass filter</a> used in the <a href="physical%20science">physical science</a>s for filtering <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> with precision, accuracy, and minimal signal strength loss. Atomic line filters work via the <a href="absorption%20%28optics%29">absorption</a> or <a href="resonance">resonance</a> <a href="Atomic%20spectral%20line">lines</a> of atomic vapors and so may also be designated an atomic resonance filter (ARF).

The three major types of atomic line filters are absorption-re-emission ALFs, Faraday filters and Voigt filters. Absorption-re-emission filters were the first type developed, and so are commonly called simply "atomic line filters"; the other two types are usually referred to specifically as "Faraday filters" or "Voigt filters". Atomic line filters use different mechanisms and designs for different applications, but the same basic strategy is always employed: by taking advantage of the narrow lines of absorption or resonance in a metallic vapor, a specific <a href="frequency">frequency</a> of light bypasses a series of filters that block all other light.

Atomic line filters can be considered the optical equivalent of <a href="lock-in%20amplifier">lock-in amplifier</a>s; they are used in scientific applications requiring the effective detection of a narrowband signal (almost always laser light) that would otherwise be obscured by broadband sources, such as <a href="daylight">daylight</a>. They are used regularly in "Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging" (<a href="LIDAR">LIDAR</a>) and are being studied for their potential use in <a href="laser">laser</a> communication systems. Atomic line filters are superior to conventional dielectric optical filters such as <a href="interference%20filter">interference filter</a>s and <a href="Lyot%20filter">Lyot filter</a>s, but their greater complexity makes them practical only in background-limited detection, where a weak signal is detected while suppressing a strong background. Compared to <a href="etalon">etalon</a>s, another high-end optical filter, Faraday filters are significantly sturdier and may be six times cheaper at around <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>15,000 per unit.

The predecessor of the atomic line filter was the <a href="infrared%20quantum%20counter">infrared quantum counter</a>, designed in the 1950s by <a href="Nicolaas%20Bloembergen">Nicolaas Bloembergen</a>. This was a quantum mechanical <a href="amplifier">amplifier</a> theorized by <a href="Joseph%20Weber">Joseph Weber</a> to detect <a href="infrared">infrared</a> radiation with very little noise. Zero spontaneous emission was already possible for <a href="x-ray">x-ray</a> and <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a> amplifiers and Weber thought to bring this technology to the infrared spectrum. Bloembergen described such a device in detail and dubbed it the "infrared quantum counter".

The media of these devices were <a href="crystal">crystal</a>s with <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a> <a href="ion">ion</a> impurities, absorbing low-energy light and re-emitting it in the visible range. By the 1970s, atomic vapors were used in atomic vapor quantum counters for detection of infrared electromagnetic radiation, as they were found to be superior to the metallic <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">salt</a>s and crystals that had been used.

The principles hitherto employed in infrared amplification were put together into a passive sodium ALF. This design and those that immediately followed it were primitive and suffered from low <a href="quantum%20efficiency">quantum efficiency</a> and slow response time. As this was the original design for ALFs, many references use only the designation "atomic line filter" to describe specifically the absorption-re-emission construction. In 1977, Gelbwachs, Klein and Wessel created the first active atomic line filter.

Faraday filters, developed sometime before 1978, were "a substantial improvement" over absorption-re-emission atomic line filters of the time. The Voigt filter, <a href="patent">patent</a>ed by James H. Menders and Eric J. Korevaar on August 26, 1992, was more advanced. Voigt filters were more compact and "[could] be easily designed for use with a permanent magnet". By 1996, Faraday filters were being used for LIDAR.

A technical definition of an atomic line filter is as an "ultra-narrow-band, large-acceptance-angle, <a href="Optical%20isotropy">isotropic</a> optical filter". "Ultra-narrow-band" defines the thin range of frequencies that an ALF may accept; an ALF generally has a <a href="passband">passband</a> on the order of 0.001 nanometer. That atomic line filters also have wide acceptance angles (near 180°) is another important characteristic of the devices; conventional dielectric filters based on the spacing of reflective or refractive layers change their effective spacing when light enters at an angle.

The exact parameters (temperature, magnetic field strength, length, etc.) of any filter may be tuned to a specific application. These values are calculated by computers due to the extreme complexity of the systems.

Atomic line filters may operate in the <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a>, <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible</a> and infrared regions of the <a href="electromagnetic%20spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a>. In absorption-re-emission ALFs, the frequency of light must be shifted in order for the filter to operate, and in a passive device, this shift must be to a lower frequency (i.e. red shifted) simply because of energy conservation. This means that passive filters are rarely able to work with infrared light, because the output frequency would be impractically low. If <a href="photomultiplier">photomultiplier tubes</a> (PMTs) are used then the "output wavelength of the ARF should lie in a spectral region in which commercial, large-area, long-lived PMT's [sic] possess maximum sensitivity". In such a case, active ALFs would have the advantage over passive ALFs as they would more readily, "generate output wavelengths in the near UV, the spectral region in which well-developed <a href="photocathode">photocathode</a>s possess their highest sensitivity".

In a passive ALF, the input frequency must correspond almost exactly to the natural absorption lines of the vapor cell. Active ARFs are much more flexible, however, as the vapor may be stimulated so that it will absorb other frequencies of light.

Faraday and Voigt filters do not shift the frequency or wavelength of the signal light.

The response time of an absorption-re-emission atomic line filter directly affects the rate information is transmitted from the light source to the receiver. Therefore, a minimal response time is an important property of these ALFs. The response time of such an ALF, is largely dependent on the spontaneous decay of the excited atoms in the vapor cell. In 1988, Jerry Gelbwachs cited, "typical rapid spontaneous emission times are ~ 30 <a href="second">ns</a>, which suggests that the upper limit on the information rate is approximately 30 <a href="hertz">MHz</a>".

Many methods of decreasing the response time of ALFs have been developed. Even in the late 1980s, certain gases were used to catalyze the decay of the electrons of the vapor cell. In 1989, Eric Korevaar had developed his Fast ALF design which detected emitted fluorescence without photosensitive plates. With such methods employed, gigahertz frequencies are easily attainable.

Atomic line filters are inherently very efficient filters, generally classified as "ultra-high-Q" as their <a href="Q%20factor">"Q" factor</a> is in the 10 to 10 range. This is partially because the, "crossed polarizers ... serve to block out background light with a rejection ratio better than 10". The passband of a typical Faraday filter may be a few GHz. The total output of a Faraday filter may be around 50% of the total input light intensity. The light lost is reflected or absorbed by imperfect lenses, filters and windows.

The band-pass of an atomic line filter is usually equal to the <a href="Doppler%20profile">Doppler profile</a> of the vapor cell, the natural range of frequencies at which a vapor cell will be excited by a pure light source. The Doppler profile is the width of the spectrum of Doppler shifted radiation emitted by the vapor cell due to its <a href="thermal%20motion">thermal motion</a>. This value is less for larger atoms at lower temperatures, a system considered more ideal.

There are some circumstances where this is not the case, and it is desirable to make the width of the transition line larger than the Doppler profile. For instance, when tracking a quickly accelerating object, the band-pass of the ALF must include within it the maximum and minimum values for the reflected light. The accepted method for increasing the band-pass involves placing an inert gas in the vapor cell. This gas both widens the spectral line and increases the transmission rate of the filter.

For all of their efficiency, atomic line filters are not perfect; there are many sources of error, or "noise", in a given system. These are manifest as electromagnetic radiation independent of the working processes of the filter and the intensity of the signal light. One source of error is the <a href="thermal%20radiation">thermal radiation</a> of and within the ALF itself. Some thermal radiation comes directly from the filter and happens to be within the bandpass of the second broad band filter. More noise is created if the filter is designed for output in the infrared range, as most of the thermal radiation would be in that spectrum. These emissions may stimulate the vapor and create the radiation it is trying to detect in the first place.

Active atomic line filters are more likely to produce noise than passive ones because actives have no "state selectivity"; the pumping source may accidentally excite atoms hit by the wrong light up to the critical energy level, emitting radiation spontaneously.

Other errors may be caused by atomic absorption/resonance lines not targeted but still active. Though most "near" transitions are over 10 nanometers away (far enough to be blocked by the broad-band filters), the <a href="fine%20structure">fine</a> and <a href="hyperfine%20structure">hyperfine structure</a> of the target absorption line may absorb incorrect frequencies of light and pass them through to the output sensor.

<a href="Radiation%20trapping">Radiation trapping</a> in an atomic line filter may seriously affect the performance and therefore tuning of an ALF. In the original studies of atomic line filters in the 1970s and early 1980s, there was a "large overestimation of the [signal bandwidth]". Later, radiation trapping was studied, analyzed and ALFs were optimized to account for it.

In all atomic line filters, the position and widths of the vapor cell resonance lines are among the most important properties. By the <a href="Stark%20effect">Stark effect</a> and <a href="Zeeman%20splitting">Zeeman splitting</a>, the base absorption lines may be "split" into finer lines. "Stark and Zeeman tuning... can be used to tune the detector." Consequently, manipulation of electric and <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>s may alter other properties of the filter (i.e. shifting the passband).

An absorption-re-emission atomic line filter absorbs the desired wavelength of light and emits light that bypasses broadband filters. In passive absorption-re-emission ALFs, a <a href="high-pass%20filter">high-pass filter</a> blocks all low-energy incoming light. The vapor cell absorbs the signal, which coincides with the vapor's thin absorption line, and the cell's atoms become excited. The vapor cell then re-emits the signal light by undergoing <a href="fluorescence">fluorescence</a> at a lower frequency. A <a href="low-pass%20filter">low-pass filter</a> blocks radiation above the frequency of the fluorescent light. In an active ALF, <a href="optical%20pumping">optical</a> or <a href="electrical%20pumping">electrical pumping</a> is used for exciting these atoms so they absorb or emit light of different wavelengths. For active ALFs, other systems of conventional filters may be needed.

A Faraday filter, magneto-optical filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday Dispersive Optical Filter) works by rotating the polarization of the light passing through the vapor cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic <a href="spectral%20line">absorption lines</a> by the <a href="Faraday%20effect">Faraday effect</a> and <a href="anomalous%20dispersion">anomalous dispersion</a>. Only light at the resonant frequency of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the <a href="Zeeman%20Effect">Zeeman Effect</a>, or the splitting of atomic absorption lines in the presence of the magnetic field. Light at the resonant frequency of the vapor exits a FADOF near its original strength but with an orthogonal polarization.

Following the laws which govern the Faraday effect, the rotation of the targeted radiation is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the width of the vapor cell and the <a href="Verdet%20constant">Verdet constant</a> (which is dependent on the <a href="temperature">temperature</a> of the cell, <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> of the light and sometimes intensity of the field) of the vapor in the cell. This relationship is represented the following equation:

A Voigt filter is a Faraday filter with its magnetic field shifted to be perpendicular to the direction of the light and at 45° to the polarization of the polarized plates. In a Voigt filter, the vapor cell acts as a <a href="wave%20plate">half wave plate</a>, retarding one polarization by 180° per the <a href="Voigt%20effect">Voigt effect</a>.

Preceding an atomic line filter may be a <a href="collimator">collimator</a>, which straightens incident light rays for passing through the rest of the filter consistently; however, collimated light is not always necessary. After the collimator, a high-pass filter blocks almost half of the incoming light (that of too long a wavelength). In Faraday and Voigt filters, the first <a href="polarizer">polarizing plate</a> is used here to block light.

The next component in an atomic line filter is the <a href="vapor%20cell">vapor cell</a>; this is common to all atomic line filters. It either absorbs and re-emits the incident light, or rotates its polarization by the Faraday or Voigt effect. Following the vapor cell is a low-pass filter, designed to block all of the light that the first filter did not, except the designated frequency of light which came from the fluorescence. In Faraday and Voigt filters, a second polarizing plate is used here.

Other systems may be used in conjunction with the rest of an atomic line filter for practicality. For instance, the polarizers used in the actual Faraday filter don't block most radiation, "because these polarizers only work over a limited wavelength region ... a broad band interference filter is used in conjunction with the Faraday filter". The passband of the interference filter may be 200 times that of the actual filter. Photomultiplier tubes, too, are often used for increasing the intensity of the output signal to a usable level. <a href="Avalanche%20breakdown">Avalanche</a> <a href="photomultiplier">photomultiplier</a>s, which are more efficient, may be used instead of a PMT.

While every implementation of each kind of ALF is different, the vapor cell in each is relatively similar. The thermodynamic properties of vapor cells in filters are carefully controlled because they determine important qualities of the filter, for instance the necessary strength of the magnetic field. Light is let into and out of this vapor chamber by way of two low-reflection windows made of a material such as <a href="magnesium%20fluoride">magnesium fluoride</a>. The other sides of the cell may be of any opaque material, though generally a heat-resistant <a href="metal">metal</a> or <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a> is used as the vapor is usually kept at temperatures upwards of 100 °C.

Most ALF vapor cells use <a href="alkali%20metal">alkali metal</a>s because of their high vapor pressures; many alkali metals also have absorption lines and resonance in the desired spectra. Common vapor cell materials are <a href="sodium">sodium</a>, potassium and <a href="caesium">caesium</a>. Note that <a href="Nonmetal">non-metallic</a> vapors such as <a href="neon">neon</a> may be used. As the early quantum counters used <a href="Solid-state%20laser">solid state</a> metal ions in crystals, it is conceivable that such a medium could be used in the ALFs of today. This is presumably not done because of the superiority of atomic vapors in this capacity.

Atomic line filters are most often used in LIDAR and other exercises in laser tracking and detection, for their ability to filter daylight and effectively discern weak, narrowband signals; however, they may be used for filtering out the earth's <a href="Thermal%20radiation">thermal</a> background, measuring the efficiencies of <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s and general filtering applications.

Without an atomic line filter, laser tracking and communication may be difficult. Usually, <a href="intensified%20charge-coupled%20device">intensified charge-coupled device</a> cameras must be used in conjunction with simple dielectric optical filters (e.g. interference filters) to detect laser emissions at a distance. Intensified CCDs are inefficient and necessitate the use of a pulsed laser transmission within the visible spectrum. With the superior filtering system of an ALF, a non-intensified <a href="charge-coupled%20device">CCD</a> may be used with a <a href="continuous%20wave">continuous wave</a> laser more efficiently. "[Atomic line filters] with passbands of about 0.001 nm have been developed to improve the background rejection of conventionally filtered laser receivers". The total energy consumption of the latter system is "30 to 35 times less" than that of the former, so space-based, underwater and agile laser communications with ALFs have been proposed and developed.

LIDAR comprises firing lasers at relevant portions of the atmosphere where light is <a href="backscatter">backscatter</a>ed. By analyzing the reflected laser beam for <a href="Doppler%20shift">Doppler shift</a>s, wind speeds and wind directions in the target region may be calculated. The thermal structure, diurnal/semi-diurnal <a href="tide">tide</a>s, and seasonal variations in the <a href="mesosphere">mesopause</a> region may thus be studied. This is a valuable faculty for <a href="meteorology">meteorologists</a> and <a href="climatology">climatologists</a>, as these properties can be significant.

However, without the ability to effectively track weak laser signals, collection of atmospheric data would be relegated to times of day where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not drown out the laser's signal. The addition of an atomic line filter to the LIDAR equipment effectively filters interference to the laser's signal to the point where LIDAR data can be collected at any time of the day. For the past decade, Faraday filters have been used to do this. Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they did before the advent of the FADOF.

Carnaby's black cockatoo

Carnaby's black cockatoo ("Calyptorhynchus latirostris"), also known as the short-billed black cockatoo, is a large <a href="Calyptorhynchus">black cockatoo</a> endemic to <a href="southwest%20Australia">southwest Australia</a>. It was described in 1948 by <a href="natural%20history">naturalist</a> <a href="Ivan%20Carnaby">Ivan Carnaby</a>. Measuring in length, it has a short <a href="crest%20%28feathers%29">crest</a> on the top of its head. Its <a href="plumage">plumage</a> is mostly greyish black, and it has prominent white cheek patches and a white tail band. The body feathers are edged with white giving a scalloped appearance. <a href="Sexual%20dimorphism%23Birds">Adult males</a> have a dark grey <a href="beak">beak</a> and pink eye-rings. Adult females have a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings and ear patches that are paler than those of the males.

This cockatoo usually lays a <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> of one to two eggs. It generally takes 28 to 29 days for the female to <a href="Egg%20incubation%23Avian%20incubation">incubate</a> the eggs, and the young <a href="fledge">fledge</a> ten to eleven weeks after hatching. The young will stay with the family until the next breeding season, and sometimes even longer. The family leaves the <a href="nest">nest</a>ing site after the young fledge until the following year. Carnaby's black cockatoo forms flocks when not breeding, with birds in drier habitats usually being more <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a> than those in wetter ones. It <a href="bird%20flight">flies</a> with deep and slow wingbeats, generally high above trees. Seeds of plants of the families <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a> and, to a lesser extent, <a href="Myrtaceae">Myrtaceae</a> form a large part of its diet.

Carnaby's black cockatoo nests in hollows situated high in trees with fairly large diameters, generally "<a href="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a>". With much of its habitat lost to land clearing and development and threatened by further <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a>, Carnaby's black cockatoo is listed as an <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> by the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Federal</a> and <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>n governments. It is also classified as endangered by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN). Like most <a href="parrot">parrot</a>s, it is protected by <a href="CITES">CITES</a>, an international agreement that makes <a href="wildlife%20trade">trade</a>, export, and import of listed wild-caught species illegal.

Carnaby's black cockatoo and <a href="Baudin%27s%20black%20cockatoo">Baudin's black cockatoo</a> were once known collectively as the white-tailed black cockatoo ("C. baudinii") until formally classified as separate <a href="species">species</a>. In a 1933 report on the birds of <a href="Lake%20Grace%20System">Lake Grace</a>, Western Australian naturalist <a href="Ivan%20Carnaby">Ivan Carnaby</a> wrote of a distinctive population of white-tailed black cockatoos that he named mallee black cockatoos. These birds lived in <a href="mallee%20%28habit%29">mallee</a> and sandplains, using their large bills to crack open woody seed pods; the typical form had a long narrow bill it used to extract eucalypt seeds from marri seed pods. He classified it as a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the white-tailed black cockatoo in 1948, giving it the name "Calyptorhynchus baudinii latirostris". The epithet "latirostris" is from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "latus" "wide" and "rostrum" "bill". The <a href="holotype">holotype</a> specimen is from <a href="Hopetoun%2C%20Western%20Australia">Hopetoun, Western Australia</a>.

Within the <a href="genus">genus</a>, the two Western Australian white-tailed species, Carnaby's and the Baudin's black cockatoo, together with the <a href="yellow-tailed%20black%20cockatoo">yellow-tailed black cockatoo</a> ("C. funereus") of eastern Australia form the subgenus "Zanda". The <a href="red-tailed%20black%20cockatoo">red-tailed</a> ("C. banksii") and <a href="glossy%20black%20cockatoo">glossy black cockatoo</a>s ("C. lathami") form the nominate subgenus of "Calyptorhynchus". The two groups are distinguished by differing juvenile <a href="Begging%20behavior%20in%20animals">food begging calls</a> and the degree of <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>. Males and females of the latter group have markedly different appearance, whereas those of the former have similar plumage.

The three species of the subgenus "Zanda" have been variously considered as two, then as a single species for many years. During the 1970s, Australian ornithologist <a href="Denis%20A.%20Saunders">Denis Saunders</a> analysed the two white-tailed <a href="taxon">taxa</a> and found that Baudin's black cockatoo also has a longer wing, and wider and higher skull than Carnaby's black cockatoo. Furthermore, there was no overlap in the range of (bill) lengths. In a 1979 paper, Saunders highlighted the similarity between the short-billed and the southern race "xanthanotus" of the yellow-tailed and treated them as a single species with the long-billed as a distinct species. He proposed that Western Australia had been colonised on two separate occasions, once by a common ancestor of all three forms (which became the long-billed black cockatoo), and later by what has become the short-billed black cockatoo. An analysis of protein <a href="allozyme">allozyme</a>s published in 1984 revealed the two Western Australian forms to be more closely related to each other than to the yellow-tailed, and the consensus since then has been to treat them as three separate species.

The two white-tailed cockatoo species were called short-billed and long-billed black cockatoos in scientific works, yet they were called Carnaby's and Baudin's black cockatoo in Western Australia. Hence ornithologists <a href="Leslie%20Christidis">Les Christidis</a> and <a href="Walter%20E.%20Boles">Walter Boles</a> pushed for the latter two names to be used. The <a href="International%20Ornithologists%27%20Union">International Ornithologists' Union</a> has taken up this suggestion and uses these names as their official <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s. The local <a href="Noongar">Noongar</a> people did not distinguish between Carnaby's and Baudin's black cockatoos. <a href="Nyungar%20language">Nyungar</a> names recorded include "ngolyenok", "ngoolyoo" (from <a href="Northampton%2C%20Western%20Australia">Northampton</a>), and "G'noo-le-a" (from <a href="Geraldton">Geraldton</a>).

Carnaby's black cockatoo is in length with a wingspan, and weighs 520–790 grams. It is mostly greyish black, with narrow light grey scalloping produced by narrow off white margins at the tips of dark feathers. The scalloping is more prominent on the neck. It has a crest of long feathers on its head that form a short crest that can be raised and lowered, and a prominent off-white patch of feathers on its cheek. Its lateral tail feathers are white with black tips, and the central tail feathers all black. The irises are dark brown and the legs brown-grey. Its beak is shorter and broader than that of the closely related and similar Baudin's black cockatoo; the two are often difficult to distinguish in the field.

The adult male has a dark grey beak and pink eye-rings. The adult female has a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings and ear patches that are whiter and more distinctive than those of the male. The feathers of its underparts and underwing coverts have larger white margins than those of the male, leading to a more barred or scalloped pattern to its plumage. Its legs and feet are a little lighter than those of the male. <a href="Moulting%23Birds">Moulting</a> appears to take place in stages in late summer—some time between January or February and April or May, and is poorly understood.

Juveniles have a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings, and less white in the tail feathers. They can also be distinguished by their constant begging calls. It is not possible to tell the sexes apart until the male's bill begins to darken. This begins when the male is around one year old, and is complete some time after two years of age.

Carnaby's black cockatoo is found across a broad swathe of <a href="southwest%20Australia">southwest Australia</a>—mostly within the <a href="Wheatbelt%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Wheatbelt</a> region—in places that receive over of rainfall yearly. The limits of its range include <a href="Cape%20Arid%20National%20Park">Cape Arid</a> to the east, Lake Cronin, Hatters Hill and Lake Moore inland, and <a href="Kalbarri%2C%20Western%20Australia">Kalbarri</a> to the north. Breeding takes place in areas receiving rainfall a year, from the <a href="Stirling%20Range">Stirling Range</a> to <a href="Three%20Springs%2C%20Western%20Australia">Three Springs</a> as well as around <a href="Bunbury%2C%20Western%20Australia">Bunbury</a>. The cockatoo pairs form flocks outside the breeding season, moving away from nesting areas. Carnaby's black cockatoo is sedentary in wetter parts of its range, and migratory in drier areas as birds move south and west towards the coast in summer.

Carnaby's black cockatoo is found in "<a href="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a>" woodland, most commonly of wandoo ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20wandoo">Eucalyptus wandoo</a>") or salmon gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20salmonophloia">E. salmonophloia</a>"). It is also found nearby pine plantations and sandplains or <a href="kwongan">kwongan</a> heath with abundant "<a href="Hakea">Hakea</a>", "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>", and "<a href="Grevillea">Grevillea</a>" shrubs.

Carnaby's black cockatoo communicates by auditory and visual displays. The voice is generally noisy with several <a href="bird%20vocalization">calls</a>; loudest and most frequent is a wailing "wy-lah", which is uttered by both sexes and often heard before the birds themselves are seen. There is usually an interval of 0.4 seconds before the call is repeated. This call is made by birds in flight, before taking off and returning to the nest. Carnaby's black cockatoos that are not in flight may answer with this call when they hear it. The call is often shortened or chopped off three-quarters of the way through as the bird takes off. The call varies between individual Carnaby's black cockatoos, and older nestlings can distinguish their parents' calls. Saunders labelled a variant of the "wy-lah" as the "interrogative call"—it is drawn out and ends with an inflection. Birds often utter a soft "chuck" call when alone. Females make a whistling call composed of two notes of varying volume when perched or about to take off. They also utter a softer version that is 0.6 seconds long, as well as a long single-noted whistle when alone. The male makes a soft shot "wy-lah" call in similar situations. Birds may also make a harsh screeching <a href="alarm%20signal">alarm call</a> when they notice something is out of place. They squawk loudly in disputes with their own kind, when other animals enter breeding territory, or when they are handled by people in captivity. Males can utter a harsh chattering squeak when arguing with other males.

Males make two calls that are directed at females, sometimes as a prelude to mating. One is a sequence of short squeaks; the other is made up of consecutive "ah" notes with 0.1 second between each note. These calls can be brief or last up to several minutes. Nestlings make a noisy grating begging call when seeking or expecting food. An adult female may also make the call while incubating the eggs. Immature birds also make a grating call not associated with begging that parents ignore.

Carnaby's black cockatoo flies with deep, slow wingbeats, giving it a wavelike movement. It can also glide for extended periods with its wings held downwards. Flocks generally fly at height, descending to treetops to feed or roost. Birds can be agile, manoeuvring quickly if startled or disturbed. In contrast, they waddle awkwardly on the ground.

The maximum age recorded from <a href="bird%20ringing">banding</a> has been 25 years 10.8 months for a bird banded in November 1988 at Coomallo Creek and encountered in a field 5 km away at Tootbardie in October 2014.

Carnaby's black cockatoos begin breeding from four years of age and mate for life. Mature wandoo and salmon gum woodlands provide important breeding habitat for the cockatoos as they need large hollows in tall trees. The nests are generally located about above the ground, and spaced away from each other, on average. There is competition for nest hollows with <a href="western%20corella">western corella</a>s ("Cacatua pastinator"), <a href="galah">galah</a>s ("Eolophus roseicapilla"), and <a href="feral">feral</a> <a href="western%20honeybee">honeybee</a>s ("Apis mellifera"). Galahs seek out hollows at any time of year, unlike the Carnaby's black cockatoos, which only look before breeding. Mated pairs return to a breeding locale in late winter and begin preparing to breed, the female choosing a suitable hollow in a tree. She becomes highly <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a>, driving off other females from the vicinity of the nest. After a bushfire burnt out much of the species' breeding habitat in 2009, local wildlife officers of the Department of Parks and Wildlife in Western Australia constructed artificial breeding hollows. After some experimentation by authorities, the survival rate of nestlings in these hollows increased to 75%.

Breeding season is from late winter to summer. The female lays a clutch of one or two white eggs, with the second egg laid eight days after the first. One egg is generally larger in a two-egg clutch, and does not differ in size from the egg of a single-egg clutch. It ranges from around long and in diameter. The second egg is around 3 mm shorter. The egg has been calculated to weigh around 33 g, which is 5% of that of the adult female. The female <a href="Egg%20incubation%23Avian%20incubation">incubates</a> the eggs alone over a period of 28 to 29 days. The eggs hatch asynchronously, with the second one hatching eight days after the first. The second chick usually perishes within the first two days of life; only a small number <a href="fledge">fledge</a> successfully. Newly hatched chicks are covered with pale yellow <a href="down%20feather">down</a>, and are blind. They can sit but are otherwise helpless. By the third week, their eyes begin to open and they have a greyish colour as the black pin feathers start to appear under the down. The down has largely disappeared by week five and the black feathers and pale cheek patch are prominent. Female young have a whiter cheek patch from this age onwards. The nestlings are usually fed by both parents, with the chicks fledging ten to eleven weeks after hatching. The chicks usually remain in the company of their parents till at least the next breeding season or even longer. The family leaves the vicinity of the nest until they return to breed the following season.

The cockatoo <a href="herbivore">feeds primarily</a> on seeds of <a href="proteaceae">proteaceous</a> plants such as "Banksia", "Hakea" and "Grevillea", and secondarily on seeds from <a href="myrtaceae">myrtaceous</a> plants such as "Eucalyptus" and "Corymbia". Over fifty native plant species are commonly used for food, either as seed or flowers, and this includes western sheoak "(<a href="Allocasuarina%20fraseriana">Allocasuarina fraseriana</a>"), orange wattle ("<a href="Acacia%20saligna">Acacia saligna</a>"), and balga ("<a href="Xanthorrhoea%20preissii">Xanthorrhoea preissii</a>"). Typically, Carnaby's black cockatoos sit in the crowns of trees cracking the seed pods or cones. First, a bird chews through the stem holding the item before holding it with its foot and tearing bits off and extracting the seed. Birds may move along the branches breaking stems at random as well. Occasionally they forage for fallen seed and <a href="frugivore">fruit</a> on the ground. This cockatoo acts as an agent in biological control, eating the <a href="larva">larva</a>e of invertebrates such as wood-boring insects and <a href="moth">moth</a>s from rare plants.

The <a href="Swan%20Coastal%20Plain">Swan Coastal Plain</a> north of Perth has become an important feeding area. There, cockatoos also forage in the <a href="Gnangara%2C%20Western%20Australia">Gnangara</a> pine plantations, where they feed on the seeds of Monterey pine ("<a href="Pinus%20radiata">Pinus radiata</a>") and maritime pine ("<a href="Pinus%20pinaster">Pinus pinaster</a>"). Carnaby's black cockatoos have come to depend on these plantations since the early 20th century. Almost two-thirds of the Carnaby's black cockatoos in the Perth–Peel Coastal Plain roost in the Gnangara-<a href="Pinjar%2C%20Western%20Australia">Pinjar</a> pine plantation. Other non-native plants that the birds also consume include "<a href="Erodium">Erodium</a>" species, doublegee ("<a href="Emex%20australis">Emex australis</a>") seeds, the fruit of the umbrella tree ("<a href="Schefflera%20actinophylla">Schefflera actinophylla</a>"), seeds of liquidambar ("<a href="Liquidambar%20styraciflua">Liquidambar styraciflua</a>"), sunflower ("<a href="Helianthus%20annuus">Helianthus annuus</a>"), jacaranda ("<a href="Jacaranda%20mimosifolia">Jacaranda mimosifolia</a>"), almond ("<a href="Prunus%20amygdalus">Prunus amygdalus</a>"), onion grass ("<a href="Romulea%20rosea">Romulea rosea</a>"), white cedar ("<a href="Melia%20azedarach">Melia azedarach</a>"), and hibiscus flowers.

When it is not breeding, a Carnaby's black cockatoo forages over land ranging from around roost sites, although daily movements are generally short, with birds travelling an average of from the roost during the morning and in the afternoon.

The <a href="wedge-tailed%20eagle">wedge-tailed eagle</a> ("Aquila audax") kills Carnaby's black cockatoos sporadically, and is the only natural <a href="predation">predator</a> of the adult cockatoo. Carnaby's black cockatoo is occasionally parasitised by the <a href="bird%20louse">bird louse</a> species "<a href="Franciscoloa%20funerei">Franciscoloa funerei</a>". In captivity, it is also susceptible to <a href="nematode">nematode</a>s of the genus "<a href="Ascaris">Ascaris</a>" if it is in a cage with open dirt flooring.

The cockatoo is recognised as <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a> under the federal <a href="Environment%20Protection%20and%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20Act%201999">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</a>, and as Schedule 1 "fauna that is rare or is likely to become extinct" by Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation (Specially Protected
Fauna) Notice 2008(2) under the <a href="Wildlife%20Conservation%20Act%201950">Wildlife Conservation Act 1950</a>. The population size of Carnaby's cockatoo fell by over 50% in 45 years, and up to a third of their traditional breeding grounds in the Wheatbelt have been abandoned. The bird is part of an annual census, the <a href="Great%20Cocky%20count">Great Cocky count</a>, that has been held every year since 2009 to track the population change of Carnaby's and other black cockatoos. The 2016 Great Cocky Count counted 10,919 Carnaby's black cockatoos, indicating the population had declined by 50% on the Perth–Peel Coastal Plain since 2010, dropping by around 10% each year. The total population is estimated to consist of 40,000 individuals.

Major threats to the cockatoo include <a href="land%20clearing%20in%20Australia">clearance</a> of their feeding and nesting habitat, destruction of <a href="tree%20hollow">nesting hollows</a> (e.g. during firewood collection), competition with other species for nest sites, and <a href="poaching">poaching</a>. Since <a href="Swan%20River%20Colony">European settlement</a>, 56% of its habitat has been cleared, mainly for agriculture. Furthermore, 54% of its habitat on the Swan Coastal Plain—an important area outside the breeding season—has been lost. Much of this area lies within the <a href="Perth">Perth</a> metropolitan area, and the city's population is predicted to increase 70% by 2050. The Western Australian State Government has produced a "Green Growth Plan" to manage this expansion; conservation groups are concerned the cockatoo (along with other species) could suffer further loss of habitat. In particular, the loss of pine plantations north of Perth could jeopardise the species' food supply. In February 2017, <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">WWF-Australia</a> and <a href="BirdLife%20Australia">BirdLife Australia</a> appealed to the Federal Environment Minister <a href="Josh%20Frydenberg">Josh Frydenberg</a> to intervene and halt the ongoing removal of pine trees. <a href="BirdLife%20International">BirdLife International</a> designated 13 sites (<a href="Important%20Bird%20Area">Important Bird Area</a>s) as being important specifically for Carnaby's black cockatoo. These are the <a href="Northern%20Swan%20Coastal%20Plain%20Important%20Bird%20Area">Northern Swan Coastal Plain</a>, which supports between 4600 and 15000 birds outside the breeding season, the Stirling Range, and 11 other sites that support between 20 and 110 breeding pairs of Carnaby's black cockatoos.

The species' low rate of reproduction and long period of immaturity render it vulnerable to rapid change in the environment as response and recovery are slow. Their habit of forming flocks predisposes them to outbreaks of disease and localised adverse weather events. A probable outbreak of a disease led to the deaths of up to 23 breeding female cockatoos at <a href="Koobabbie%20Important%20Bird%20Area">Koobabbie</a> in September–October 2009, a hailstorm killed 68 individuals around Perth on 22 March 2010, and 145 perished in a heatwave around Hopetoun when temperatures reached on 6 January 2010. Temperature and weather extremes in southwest Australia are predicted to worsen with climate change. Carnaby's black cockatoos have been brought to veterinary hospitals with traumatic injuries. Motor vehicles are a hazard, as much vegetation useful to Carnaby's black cockatoos lies on road verges. The cockatoos fly into open space when leaving the vegetation, which is often over a road and in the path of oncoming traffic.

Like most species of <a href="parrot">parrot</a>s, Carnaby's black cockatoo is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (<a href="CITES">CITES</a>) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.

Duino Elegies

The Duino Elegies () are a collection of ten <a href="elegy">elegies</a> written by the <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>n-<a href="Austrians">Austrian</a> poet <a href="Rainer%20Maria%20Rilke">Rainer Maria Rilke</a> (1875–1926). Rilke, who is "widely recognized as one of the most lyrically intense German-language poets," began writing the elegies in 1912 while a guest of <a href="Czech%20Branch%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Thurn%20und%20Taxis%23Alexander%20and%20Marie%20von%20Thurn%20und%20Taxis">Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis</a> (1855–1934) at <a href="Duino%20Castle">Duino Castle</a>, near <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> on the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a>. The poems, 859 lines long in total, were dedicated to the Princess upon their publication in 1923. During this ten-year period, the elegies languished incomplete for long stretches of time as Rilke suffered frequently from severe <a href="Depression%20%28mood%29">depression</a>—some of which was caused by the events of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and being <a href="conscription">conscripted</a> into military service. Aside from brief episodes of writing in 1913 and 1915, Rilke did not return to the work until a few years after the war ended. With a sudden, renewed inspiration—writing in a frantic pace he described as a "boundless storm, a hurricane of the spirit"—he completed the collection in February 1922 while staying at <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Muzot">Château de Muzot</a> in <a href="Veyras%2C%20Switzerland">Veyras</a>, in <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>'s <a href="Rhone%20Valley">Rhone Valley</a>. After their publication in 1923 and Rilke's death in 1926, the "Duino Elegies" were quickly recognized by critics and scholars as his most important work.

The "Duino Elegies" are intensely religious, <a href="Mysticism">mystical</a> poems that weigh beauty and <a href="Existential%20crisis">existential suffering</a>. The poems employ a rich symbolism of <a href="angel">angel</a>s and <a href="salvation">salvation</a> but not in keeping with typical <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> interpretations. Rilke begins the first elegy in an invocation of philosophical despair, asking: "Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the hierarchies of angels?" () and later declares that "every angel is terrifying" (). While labelling of these poems as "elegies" would typically imply <a href="Depression%20%28mood%29">melancholy</a> and <a href="lament">lament</a>ation, many passages are marked by their positive energy and "unrestrained enthusiasm." Together, the "Duino Elegies" are described as a metamorphosis of Rilke's "<a href="Ontology">ontological</a> torment" and an "impassioned <a href="monologue">monologue</a> about coming to terms with human existence" discussing themes of "the limitations and insufficiency of the <a href="human%20condition">human condition</a> and fractured human consciousness ... man's <a href="loneliness">loneliness</a>, the perfection of the angels, life and <a href="death">death</a>, love and lovers, and the task of the poet."

Rilke's poetry, and the "Duino Elegies" in particular, influenced many of the poets and writers of the twentieth century. In popular culture, his work is frequently quoted on the subject of love or of angels and referenced in television programs, motion pictures, music and other artistic works, in <a href="New%20Age">New Age</a> philosophy and theology, and in <a href="self-help">self-help</a> books.

In 1910, Rilke had completed writing the loosely autobiographical novel, "<a href="The%20Notebooks%20of%20Malte%20Laurids%20Brigge">Die Aufzeichnungen des Malte Laurids Brigge</a>" ("The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge") in which a young poet is terrified by the <a href="Fragmentation%20%28sociology%29">fragmentation</a> and chaos of <a href="Urban%20sociology">modern urban life</a>. After completing the work, Rilke experienced a <a href="Psychological%20trauma">severe psychological crisis</a> that lasted for two years. In 1912, still facing this severe <a href="Depression%20%28mood%29">depression and despair</a>, Rilke was invited to Duino Castle by <a href="Czech%20Branch%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Thurn%20und%20Taxis%23Alexander%20and%20Marie%20von%20Thurn%20und%20Taxis">Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis</a> (1855–1934) (born <a href="Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsf%C3%BCrst">Princess Marie zu Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfürst</a>) whom he had met a few years before. The princess (who was twenty years older than Rilke) and her husband Prince Alexander (1851–1939) enthusiastically supported artists and writers.

While at Duino, Rilke and Princess Marie discussed the possibility of collaborating on a translation of <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a>'s "<a href="La%20Vita%20Nuova">La Vita Nuova</a>" (1295). After the Princess left to join her husband at their <a href="Lou%C4%8De%C5%88">Lautschin</a> estate, Rilke spent the next few weeks at the castle preparing to focus on work. During these weeks, he was writing "Marien-Leben" ("The Life of Mary"). While walking along the cliffs overlooking the Adriatic Sea near the castle, Rilke claimed to hear a voice calling to him speaking the words of the first line, ("Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the hierarchies of angels?") which he quickly wrote in his notebook. Within days, he produced drafts of the first two elegies in the series and drafted passages and fragments that would later be incorporated into later elegies—including the opening passage of the tenth elegy.

Rilke would only finish the third and fourth elegies before the onset of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. The third was finished in 1913 in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, the fourth in early 1915 in <a href="Munich">Munich</a>. The effects of the war—particularly his traumatic experiences being <a href="Conscription">conscripted</a> into the Austro-Hungarian army—triggered a severe renewal of his depression that rendered him unable to write for several years.

Because of his depression, Rilke was unable to return to writing for several years, and only in 1920 was he motivated to focus towards completing his work on the "Duino Elegies." However, for the next two years, his mode of life was unstable and did not permit him the time or mental state he needed for his writing.

In 1921, Rilke journeyed to Switzerland, hoping to immerse himself in French culture near <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> and to find a place to live permanently. At the time, he was romantically involved with <a href="Baladine%20Klossowska">Baladine Klossowska</a> (1886–1969). At the invitation of <a href="Werner%20Reinhart">Werner Reinhart</a> (1884–1951), Rilke moved into the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Muzot">Château de Muzot</a>, a thirteenth-century manor house that lacked gas and electricity, near <a href="Veyras%2C%20Switzerland">Veyras</a>, <a href="Rhone%20Valley">Rhone Valley</a>, Switzerland. Reinhart, a Swiss merchant and amateur clarinetist, used his wealth to be a patron to many twentieth-century writers and composers. He bought Muzot to allow Rilke to live there rent-free and focus on his work. Rilke and Klossowska moved there in July 1921 and later in the year Rilke translated writings by <a href="Paul%20Val%C3%A9ry">Paul Valéry</a> and <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> into German.

With news of the death of his daughter's friend, Wera Knoop (1900–1919), Rilke set to work on "<a href="Sonnets%20to%20Orpheus">Sonnets to Orpheus</a>". The "Sonnets" frequently refer to Wera, both directly where he addresses her by name and indirectly in allusions to a "dancer" or the mythical <a href="Eurydice">Eurydice</a>. Rilke wrote to the young girl's mother stating that Wera's ghost was "commanding and impelling" him to write. In a rush of inspiration, Rilke worked on the "Sonnets" and renewed his focus towards completing the remainder of "Duino Elegies." In one week, Rilke completed the unfinished elegies, and from 2 February to 23 February 1922 he completed all the 55 sonnets of the two parts of "Sonnets to Orpheus". Rilke considered both collections to be "of the same birth". In a letter to Klossowska on 9 February 1922, Rilke wrote: "what weighed me down and caused my anguish most is done ... I am still trembling from it. ... And I went out to caress old Muzot, just now, in the moonlight." Two days later, completing the last of his work on the "Elegies" in the evening, he wrote to <a href="Lou%20Andreas-Salom%C3%A9">Lou Andreas-Salomé</a> that he had finished "everything in a few days; it was a boundless storm, a hurricane of the spirit, and whatever inside me is like thread and webbing, framework, it all cracked and bent. No thought of food."

"Duino Elegies" was published by "<a href="Die%20Insel">Insel-Verlag</a>" in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig, Germany</a> in 1923. Prominent critics praised the work and compared its merits to the works of <a href="H%C3%B6lderlin">Hölderlin</a> and <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Goethe</a>. In 1935, critic Hans-Rudolf Müller was the first to describe the collection as inherently "mystical" and promote Rilke as a "mystic" spiritual guide.

In "My Belief: Essays on Life and Art", German novelist <a href="Hermann%20Hesse">Hermann Hesse</a> (1877–1962) describes Rilke as evolving within the confines of exploring his existential problems, that "at each stage now and again the miracle occurs, his delicate, hesitant, anxiety-prone person withdraws, and through him resounds the music of the universe; like the basin of a fountain he becomes at once instrument and ear."

However, during the 1920s, many of the younger generation of German-language poets and writers did not like "Duino Elegies" because of the poems' obscure symbols and philosophy. The German poet Albrecht Schaeffer (who is associated with the literary circle of German lyric poet <a href="Stefan%20George">Stefan George</a>) dismissed the poems as "mystical blather" and described their "secular theology" as "impotent gossip".

<a href="Theodor%20W.%20Adorno">Theodor W. Adorno</a>'s <a href="Jargon%20of%20Authenticity">Jargon of Authenticity</a> (1964) suggested that the poems are essentially evil: "The fact that the neoromantic lyric sometimes behaves like the jargon [of authenticity], or at least timidly readies the way for it, should not lead us to look for the evil of the poetry simply in its form. It is not simply grounded, as a much too innocent view might maintain, in the mixture of poetry and prose. The evil, in the neoromantic lyric, consists in the fitting out of the words with a theological overtone, which is belied by the condition of the lonely and secular subject who is speaking there: religion as ornament." Adorno further believed the poems reinforced the German value of commitment that supported a cultural attraction towards the principles of Nazism.

Throughout the "Duino Elegies", Rilke explores themes of "the limitations and insufficiency of the human condition and fractured human consciousness ... mankind's loneliness, the perfection of the angels, life and death, love and lovers, and the task of the poet." Philosopher <a href="Martin%20Heidegger">Martin Heidegger</a> remarked that "the long way leading to the poetry is itself one that inquires poetically," and that Rilke "comes to realize the destitution of the time more clearly. The time remains destitute not only because God is dead, but because mortals are hardly aware and capable even of their own mortality." Rilke explores the nature of mankind's contact with beauty, and its transience, noting that humanity is forever only getting a brief, momentary glimpse of an inconceivable beauty and that it is terrifying. At the onset of the First Elegy, Rilke describes this frightened experience, defining beauty as
<poem>
... nothing but the beginning of terror which we are barely able to endure
and we are so awed because it serenely disdains to annihilate us.</poem>

Rilke depicted this infinite, transcendental beauty with the symbol of angels. However, he did not use the traditional <a href="Christian%20angelic%20hierarchy">Christian interpretation of angels</a>. He sought to utilize a symbol of the angel that was secular, divorced from religious doctrine and embodied a tremendous transcendental beauty. In this, however, Rilke commented that he was greatly influenced by the <a href="Islamic%20view%20of%20angels">depiction of angels</a> found in <a href="Islam">Islam</a>. For Rilke, the symbol of the angel represents a perfection that is "beyond human contradictions and limitations" in a "higher level of reality in the invisible." Where there is incongruity that adds to mankind's despair and anxiety is due to human nature keeping us clinging to the visible and the familiar. As mankind encounters the invisible and unknown higher levels represented by these angels, the experience of the invisible will be "terrifying" (in German, ).

As mankind comes in contact with this terrifying beauty represented by these angels, Rilke is concerned with the experience of existential angst in trying to come to terms with the coexistence of the spiritual and earthly. He portrays human beings as alone in a universe where God is abstract and possibly non-existent, "where memory and patterns of intuition raise the sensitive consciousness to a realization of solitude." Rilke depicts the alternative, a spiritually fulfilling possibility beyond human limitations in the form of angels. Beginning with the first line of the collection, Rilke's despairing speaker calls upon the angels to notice human suffering and to intervene. There is a deeply felt despair and unresolvable tension in that no matter man's striving, the limitation of human and earthly existence renders humanity unable to reach out to the angels. The narrative voice Rilke employs in the "Duino Elegies" strives "to achieve in human consciousness the angel's presumed plenitude of being" (i.e. being, or existence, in German: ).

Rilke uses the images of love and of lovers as a way of showing mankind's potential and humanity's failures in achieving the transcendent understanding embodied by the angels. In the Second Elegy, Rilke writes that "Lovers, if they knew how, might utter / wondrous things in the midnight air." () He depicts "the inadequacy of ordinary lovers" and contrasts a feminine form of "sublime love" and a masculine "blind animal passion." At the time the first elegies were written, Rilke often "expressed a longing for human companionship and affection, and then, often immediately afterwards, asking whether he could really respond to such companionship if it were offered to him ..." He notices a "decline in the lives of lovers ... when they began to receive, they also began to lose the power of giving." Later, during World War I, he would lament that "the world has fallen into the hands of men." In the face of death, life and love is not cheap and meaningless and Rilke asserted that great lovers are able to recognize all three (life, love, and death) as part of a unity. Rilke asserted that the true meaning of love could be understood through death providing love a meaning in this unity—that "the nature of every ultimate love ... is only able to reach the loved one in the infinite."
In a 1923 letter to Nanny von Escher, Rilke confided:
Two inner experiences were necessary for the creation of these books ("The Sonnets to Orpheus" and "The Duino Elegies"). One is the increasingly conscious decision to hold life open to death. The other is the spiritual imperative to present, in this wider context, the transformations of love that are not possible in a narrower circle where Death is simply excluded as The Other.

The Fifth Elegy is largely inspired by <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>'s 1905 <a href="Picasso%27s%20Rose%20Period">Rose Period</a> painting, "<a href="Family%20of%20Saltimbanques">Les Saltimbanques</a>" ("The Acrobats", also known as "The Family of Saltimbanques") in which Picasso depicts six figures pictured "in the middle of a desert landscape and it is impossible to say whether they are arriving or departing, beginning or ending their performance." Rilke depicted the six artists about to begin their performance, and that they were used as a symbol of "human activity ... always travelling and with no fixed abode, they are even a shade more fleeting than the rest of us, whose fleetingness was lamented." Further, Rilke in the poem described these figures as standing on a "threadbare carpet" to suggest "the ultimate loneliness and isolation of Man in this incomprehensible world, practicing their profession from childhood to death as playthings of an unknown will ... before their 'pure too-little' had passed into 'empty too-much.'"

Because of the profound impact that the war had on him, Rilke expressed a hope in a 1919 letter that the task of the intellectual in a post-war world would be to render the world right. It would be "to prepare in men's hearts the way for those gentle, mysterious, trembling transformations from which alone the understandings and harmonies of a serener future will proceed." Rilke envisioned his "Duino Elegies" and the "Sonnets to Orpheus" as part of his contribution.

Rilke's reputation in the English-speaking world rests largely on the popularity of "Duino Elegies". The collection has been translated into English over twenty times since it was first published in 1931 by London's <a href="Hogarth%20Press">Hogarth Press</a> in England as "Duineser Elegien: Elegies from the Castle of Duino" in a translation by <a href="Edward%20Sackville-West%2C%205th%20Baron%20Sackville">Edward</a> and <a href="Vita%20Sackville-West">Vita Sackville-West</a>. It was first translated for the American market in 1939 in a translation by J. B. Leishman and <a href="Stephen%20Spender">Stephen Spender</a> published by New York's <a href="W.%20W.%20Norton%20%26amp%3B%20Company">W. W. Norton & Company</a>. Other translations have included those by poet David Young (1978), <a href="Grateful%20Dead">Grateful Dead</a> lyricist <a href="Robert%20Hunter%20%28lyricist%29">Robert Hunter</a> (1989), poet <a href="Galway%20Kinnell">Galway Kinnell</a> with Hannah Liebmann (1999), Stephen Cohn (1989), poet <a href="Alfred%20Poulin">Alfred Poulin</a> (1975), and poet <a href="Gary%20Miranda">Gary Miranda</a> (1981).

In the United States, Rilke is one of the more popular, best-selling poets—along with thirteenth-century <a href="Sufism">Sufi</a> mystic <a href="Rumi">Rumi</a> (1207–1273), and 20th century <a href="Lebanese-American">Lebanese-American</a> poet <a href="Kahlil%20Gibran">Kahlil Gibran</a> (1883–1931). In popular culture, Rilke is frequently quoted or referenced in television programs, motion pictures, music and other works when these works discuss the subject of love or angels. Because of his work being described as "mystical," Rilke's works have also been appropriated for use by the <a href="New%20Age">New Age</a> community and in <a href="self-help">self-help</a> books. Rilke has been reinterpreted "as a master who can lead us to a more fulfilled and less anxious life."

Rilke's work, and specifically, the "Duino Elegies" have been claimed as a deep influence by several poets and writers, including Galway Kinnell, <a href="Sidney%20Keyes">Sidney Keyes</a>, Stephen Spender, <a href="Robert%20Bly">Robert Bly</a>, <a href="W.%20S.%20Merwin">W. S. Merwin</a>, <a href="John%20Ashbery">John Ashbery</a>, novelist <a href="Thomas%20Pynchon">Thomas Pynchon</a> and philosophers <a href="Ludwig%20Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> and <a href="Hans-Georg%20Gadamer">Hans-Georg Gadamer</a>. Critics and scholars have discussed Pynchon’s use of Rilke’s lyricism and concepts of <a href="Spiritual%20transformation">transformation</a> in his novel "<a href="Gravity%27s%20Rainbow">Gravity's Rainbow</a>". The first lines of "Gravity's Rainbow" mirror the first lines of first elegy, portraying the screaming descent of a <a href="V-2%20rocket">V-2 rocket</a> in 1944 London, and the novel has been described as a "serio-comic variation on Rilke's "Duino Elegies" and their <a href="German%20Romanticism">German Romantic</a> echoes in <a href="Nazi%20Germany%23Culture">Nazi culture</a>." The British poet <a href="W.%20H.%20Auden">W. H. Auden</a> (1907–1973) has been described as "Rilke's most influential English disciple" and he frequently "paid homage to him" or used the imagery of angels in his work. In the 1936 poem cycle "Sonnets from China", Auden directly alluded to Rilke's writing of the "Duino Elegies".

<poem>
Tonight in China let me think of one

Who through ten years of silence worked and waited,
Until in Muzot all his powers spoke,
And everything was given once for all.

And with the gratitude of the Completed
He went out in the winter night to stroke
That little tower like a great old animal</poem>

The reference here to stroking "that little tower" is derived from a series of letters written while Rilke was completing the "Elegies" including a letter he wrote to Klossowska, and one to his former lover, <a href="Lou%20Andreas-Salom%C3%A9">Lou Andreas-Salomé</a>. In the letter to Andreas-Salomé, he writes "I went out and stroked the little Muzot, which protected it and me and finally granted it, like a large old animal."

In later years, Rilke’s "Duino Elegies" and the "Sonnets to Orpheus" influenced Hans-Georg Gadamer’s theories of <a href="hermeneutics">hermeneutics</a>—understanding how an observer (i.e. reader, listener, or viewer) interprets cultural artifacts (i.e. works of literature, music, or art) as a series of distinct encounters. Gadamer, using examples of Rilke's poetry in his writings, interprets these works as an experience of a divine "<a href="Absolute%20%28philosophy%29">totality</a>" that we must approach with a childlike innocence and ignorance—that only through interpreting and reinterpreting can we cope with or solve the existential problems of humanity’s significance and impermanence. Gadamer points out that man is in a condition influenced by an anonymous, alienated, and mechanical world that has evolved to stand as an obstacle to his ability to make sense of such experiences.

Congregation Baith Israel Anshei Emes

Congregation Baith Israel Anshei Emes (, "House of Israel – People of Truth"), more commonly known as the Kane Street Synagogue, is an <a href="Women%20in%20Judaism%23Conservative%20Judaism">egalitarian</a> <a href="Conservative%20Judaism">Conservative</a> <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a> located at 236 Kane Street in <a href="Cobble%20Hill%2C%20Brooklyn">Cobble Hill</a>, <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. It is currently the <a href="Oldest%20synagogues%20in%20the%20United%20States">oldest continuously operating synagogue</a> in Brooklyn.

Founded as Baith Israel in 1856, the congregation constructed the first synagogue on <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>, and hired <a href="Aaron%20Wise">Aaron Wise</a> for his first <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a>nical position in the United States. Early tensions between traditionalists and reformers led to the latter forming <a href="Congregation%20Beth%20Elohim%20%28Brooklyn%2C%20New%20York%29">Congregation Beth Elohim</a>, a <a href="Reform%20Judaism">Reform</a> synagogue, in 1861.

The synagogue nearly failed in the early 20th century, but the 1905 hiring of Israel Goldfarb as rabbi, the purchase of its current buildings, and the 1908 merger with Talmud Torah Anshei Emes re-invigorated the congregation. The famous composer <a href="Aaron%20Copland">Aaron Copland</a> celebrated his <a href="Bar%20and%20Bat%20Mitzvah">Bar Mitzvah</a> there in 1913, and long-time <a href="Goldman%20Sachs">Goldman Sachs</a> head <a href="Sidney%20Weinberg">Sidney Weinberg</a> was married there in 1920.

Membership peaked in the 1920s, but with the onset of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> declined steadily, and by the 1970s the congregation could no longer afford to heat the sanctuary. Membership has recovered since that low point; the congregation renovated its school/community center in 2004, and in 2008 embarked on a million-dollar capital campaign to renovate the sanctuary.

Twelve <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Germany">Bavarian</a>, <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20the%20Netherlands">Dutch</a>, and <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Portugal">Portuguese</a> <a href="Jew">Jew</a>s gathered at a private home on January 22, 1856 to discuss their "earnest desire [to] effect the incorporation of a synagogue and congregation for divine service", and in March that year they founded Congregation Baith Israel. The group had originally organized in 1855 as the United Brethren Society, a <a href="benefit%20society">benefit society</a> that provided members with medical and burial assistance. Hiring the <a href="Reverend%23Judaism">Reverend</a> M. Gershon as <a href="hazzan">cantor</a> (the person who leads the prayers), they first met in various homes, then rented space at 155 Atlantic Street, now <a href="Atlantic%20Avenue%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Atlantic Avenue</a>.

Gershon's appointment was controversial; after a background check, the board decided by a 10–9 vote on April 6, 1856, that he had never held the position of cantor in any other congregation, and was therefore not "sufficiently acquainted with the actual requirements to fill said office", and was furthermore not "a competent reader enough to <a href="Torah%20reading">read the Sepher Torah</a>". As a result, services were led by laymen, except during the <a href="Jewish%20holiday">Jewish holiday</a>s, when a professional cantor would be brought in from Manhattan.

An 1886 "<a href="Brooklyn%20Eagle">Brooklyn Eagle</a>" article states that until the founding of Baith Israel "[h]itherto the Hebrew residents in Brooklyn had been under the necessity of finding their way across the <a href="East%20River">East River</a> in all kinds of weather, when they wished to go to their place of worship". According to synagogue legend, the founders had grown tired of rowing across the East River each Friday to celebrate <a href="Shabbat">Shabbat</a> in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. Carol Levin, however, writes that a ferry service from Whitehall Street in Manhattan to <a href="South%20Ferry%2C%20Brooklyn">South Ferry, Brooklyn</a> (at the foot of Atlantic Street) had existed since 1836 (see <a href="South%20Ferry%20%28ferry%29">South Ferry (ferry)</a>), that the Atlantic Street synagogue's location, so close to the ferry terminus, "must have seemed convenient to many", and that "[f]erry service was fast, frequent and inexpensive ... In the year 1869 there were almost 52 million passengers." Thus, in her view, the story of the founders growing tired of rowing across the East River is a "folk tale".

In the congregation's early years, tensions existed between traditionalists and reformers, and in 1861, 41 of the latter left Baith Israel to form the <a href="Congregation%20Beth%20Elohim">Congregation Beth Elohim</a>, a <a href="Reform%20Judaism">Reform</a> synagogue. That year Baith Israel hired the Reverend Joel Alexander as its religious leader. Alexander, the synagogue's first full-time rabbi, was a graduate of the Jews Seminary in <a href="M%C3%BCnster">Münster</a>, and had been <a href="Semicha">ordained</a> both in <a href="Pozna%C5%84">Posen</a> and by <a href="Hermann%20Adler">Hermann Adler</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20chief%20rabbis%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom</a>.

In 1862, the remaining 35 members purchased two lots at the corner of State Street and Boerum Place in <a href="Boerum%20Hill">Boerum Hill</a> for $3,000 (today $), and on January 12 laid the cornerstone for a new building, the first synagogue built on <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>. The building was completed on August 12, at a cost of $10,000 (today $), and was <a href="consecration">consecrated</a> on August 31 by Alexander and assembled dignitaries. The synagogue, which came to be known as the Boerum Schule, created a <a href="Hebrew%20school">Sunday school</a> soon afterwards, the first in Brooklyn, and at the time, an innovation. The school was free, and run by volunteers, with separate classes for boys and girls. By 1890 the school had 160 students, and at its peak the school had 500 pupils.

In 1869 reformers again left Baith Israel, and, joining with dissenters from Kahal Kodesh Beth Elohim of <a href="Williamsburg%2C%20Brooklyn">Williamsburg</a>, founded Temple Israel. Though many reformers had left the congregation, several reforms in the service were nonetheless introduced: the congregation abolished most "<a href="piyyut">piyyut</a>im" and the <a href="Priestly%20Blessing">Priestly Blessing</a>, and, in 1873, introduced a <a href="Reform%20Judaism%20%28North%20America%29%23Confirmation%20ceremonies">confirmation ceremony</a> for girls, led by the Reverend Dr. Tinter. The confirmation ceremonies, which had initially been held during the holiday of "<a href="Sukkot">Sukkot</a>", were eventually moved to the holiday of "<a href="Shavuot">Shavuot</a>" (the holiday during which the Reform movement held these ceremonies), and continued for both boys and girls (in place of <a href="Bar%20and%20Bat%20Mitzvah">Bar and Bat Mitzvah</a> celebrations) until the 1940s.

<a href="Aaron%20Wise">Aaron Wise</a>, father of <a href="Stephen%20Samuel%20Wise">Stephen Samuel Wise</a>, was one of the synagogue's earliest rabbis, from 1874 to 1875. This was his first rabbinical position in the United States, before moving to <a href="Congregation%20Rodeph%20Sholom%20%28Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%29">Congregation Rodeph Sholom</a> in Manhattan.

In 1876, the congregation voted by a margin of over two to one to re-orient the synagogue pews in the manner of Christian churches, and introduce <a href="Mechitza%23Separate%20seating%20in%20synagogue">mixed seating</a>. However, nothing was done about this until 1879, when the renovations were carried out: the front pews were removed, the side pews extended to the walls, and the vestibule moved outside the sanctuary. Led by rabbi Dr. E. M. Myers, the synagogue was re-dedicated on September 7.

In April 1883, Baith Israel, Beth Elohim, and Temple Israel, Brooklyn's three leading synagogues, tried to merge; Beth Elohim and Temple Israel had both been formed in the 1860s by dissenters from Baith Israel. This was the third such attempt; the previous two had failed when the members could not agree on synagogue ritual. The combined congregation, which would purchase new premises, would have 150 members (only heads of households were considered members at that time). Members would be refunded half the purchase price of the pews in their existing buildings. The rabbis of Beth Elohim and Temple Israel were to split the offices of rabbi and cantor: Baith Israel, at the time, had no rabbi. Though this attempt also failed, in the following year the three congregations carried out combined activities, including a picnic and a celebration of the 100th birthday of <a href="Moses%20Montefiore">Sir Moses Montefiore</a>.

Baith Israel hired Marcus Friedlander as rabbi in 1887. Born in <a href="Congress%20Poland">Congress Poland</a> in 1862, he left Russia for England before he was twenty. Though speaking little English at the time, he graduated there from the London Theological Seminary, before emigrating to the United States. He was 24 years old when he assumed the post at Baith Israel, at the time the youngest man in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> state to be appointed to so significant a position of Jewish leadership. Friedlander served until 1893, when he resigned to take a more lucrative position in California at the <a href="Temple%20Sinai%20%28Oakland%2C%20California%29">First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland</a>. After Friedlander left, his name was, for reasons unknown, deleted from the synagogue histories, and the financial records and minute books dating from his tenure were removed from Baith Israel's archives. He was succeeded by Joseph Taubenhaus, the brother of Dr. Gottheil/Godfrey Taubenhaus, the rabbi of Congregation Beth Elohim; another brother, Jacob/<a href="Jean%20Taubenhaus">Jean Taubenhaus</a> was a famous French <a href="chess%20master">chess master</a>.

In 1889, the congregation again renovated the synagogue building, repairing it and replacing the roof, increasing the seating capacity, adding a new vestibule and double entrance way, and redecorating the interior. At that time over half of the congregants still spoke <a href="German%20language">German</a> as their native language. The congregation had 50 members—defined as "heads of families who own seats"—by 1891, and 300 congregants in total. By 1900, the congregation had 160 members, and the congregational school, which held classes for two hours once a week, had ten teachers and 150 students.

Though the synagogue had undertaken innovations in some areas of <a href="halakha">Jewish law</a>, it still insisted on strict adherence in others. In 1878 Tinter was dismissed for officiating at the marriage of a Jewish woman and Christian man, and Baith Israel was, for a time, the only congregation in Brooklyn that celebrated <a href="Jewish%20holiday">Jewish holiday</a>s for the traditional two days. In 1889 Baith Israel asserted it was "the only orthodox congregation in the city", and that year the board forced the resignation of a Mr. J. Folkart, for transgressing the <a href="Yom%20Kippur%23Observances">laws of Yom Kippur</a>. In 1892, when Hyman Rosenberg was expelled as rabbi of Brooklyn's <a href="Congregation%20Beth%20Jacob%20Ohev%20Sholom">Beth Jacob synagogue</a> for <a href="Kosher%20animals">eating ham</a>, the "<a href="Brooklyn%20Eagle">Brooklyn Eagle</a>" canvassed local rabbis for their views on the matter. While George Taubenhaus, rabbi of Beth Elohim stated, "I do not believe my congregation would expel me if I ate ham", Baith Israel's rabbi Friedlander responded, "While there are some differences between the reform and orthodox Jews, I do not think it is the place for any Jewish minister to eat ham. The reformers do not so strictly observe the old Mosaic law, but it does not seem to me a good example for a rabbi to set to his congregation."

By 1904, membership had fallen to 30, and the synagogue nearly failed: mass transit had allowed Jews to migrate away from downtown Brooklyn, and a fire had nearly destroyed the Boerum synagogue building. Further innovations were attempted, including a <a href="pipe%20organ">pipe organ</a> and a mixed-sex <a href="choir">choir</a>, but these were removed after objections from <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox</a> members. The congregation decided that the Boerum location was part of the problem, and made the bold decision to sell it, buy new premises, and hire a rabbi (the synagogue had, for many years, run without one). In 1905, they hired Israel Goldfarb, a 1902 graduate of the <a href="Jewish%20Theological%20Seminary%20of%20America">Jewish Theological Seminary</a>, as "Hazan [cantor] and Teacher", his first and only pulpit. The following year Goldfarb was appointed rabbi, a position he would hold for over 50 years.

In 1905, the congregation also purchased for $30,000 (today $) its current building at Tompkins Place and Harrison Street (renamed Kane Street in 1928), along with an adjacent school building and a connecting two-story arcade. The <a href="Romanesque%20Revival%20architecture">Romanesque revival</a> church building, erected in 1855, had originally housed the Middle <a href="Dutch%20Reformed%20Church">Dutch Reformed Church</a>, and, from 1887, the Trinity <a href="Independent%20Evangelical%E2%80%94Lutheran%20Church">German Lutheran</a> Church. The hiring of Goldfarb and purchase of a new building helped revive the congregation, and by 1906 (its 50th anniversary) membership had doubled.

Goldfarb was a talented musician, known to this day as composer of popular tunes for the songs "<a href="Shalom%20Aleichem%20%28liturgy%29">Shalom Aleichem</a>" and "Magein Avot" used in most <a href="Ashkenazi%20Jews">Ashkenazi</a> synagogues. With his brother Samuel E. Goldfarb, he compiled "The Jewish Songster" for schoolchildren, the first American collection of Jewish songs. Israel Goldfarb also served as Professor of Liturgical Music at the Jewish Theological Seminary from 1920 to 1944, and in 1949 founded the School of Sacred Music at <a href="Hebrew%20Union%20College">Hebrew Union College</a>.

In his "<a href="Kol%20Nidre">Kol Nidre</a>" sermon of 1905, Goldfarb emphasized the need for a <a href="Talmud%20Torah">Talmud Torah</a> (providing inexpensive Jewish education for primary school children), and it was immediately founded. Talmud Torahs helped synagogues in neighborhoods with small Jewish populations to attract young Jewish families, and were common in "second-settlement areas of New York City such as <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a> and Brooklyn". By 1907–1908 the congregation had grown to 85 member families. The Talmud Torah, which held classes four days a week, had three teachers and 75 students.

In 1908, Baith Israel merged with Degraw Street's Talmud Torah Anshei Emes Synagogue, a growing congregation that had become too large for the <a href="Terraced%20house%23New%20York%20City">row house</a> in which it held services. Talmud Torah Anshei Emes's membership was mostly made up of Eastern European Jews, who were stricter in their observances than Baith Israel's mostly German-origin membership; to accommodate them, a special all-men section of pews was designated at the front left of the sanctuary.

The merged congregations adopted the current name, a combination of the two previous names, and, with the assistance and encouragement of Goldfarb and synagogue president Harris Copland founded a sisterhood. Nevertheless, the combined membership was still not large; in 1911, the year the congregation renovated the recently acquired synagogue building, the Talmud Torah had only 45 students, 10 of them the children of non-members.

The sisterhood had grown to 42 members by 1913; that year 11 men were accepted as new congregants, including "a dentist, an optician, a druggist, a lawyer, a butler and two store owners and a roofer"—in general, <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a> occupations. Baith Israel Anshei Emes also became one of the charter members of the <a href="United%20Synagogue%20of%20Conservative%20Judaism">United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism</a> in 1913, with Michael Salit, who had been synagogue president in 1906, serving as the congregation's delegate, and he, Rabbi Goldfarb and another synagogue member, Isaac Applebaum, were among the 22 individuals who initially founded the organization.

<a href="Aaron%20Copland">Aaron Copland</a> celebrated his Bar Mitzvah at Baith Israel Anshei Emes in 1913. The Copland family was active in the synagogue; his father Harris became treasurer and chairman of the Talmud Torah in 1905, had helped purchase the current building, served as president of the congregation from 1907 to 1910, and was made a life trustee in 1936. Aaron's brother Ralph served as superintendent of the Sunday School. Goldfarb was instrumental in assisting Aaron Copland in his early musical career. While still in high school, Aaron had approached Goldfarb for his support in studying music: Aaron's father wanted him to enter the legal profession. Goldfarb engineered an agreement whereby Aaron would study music for two or three years, and, if that did not work out, then study law. In his memoirs, Copland would later describe Goldfarb as "a composer of liturgical music and the possessor of a fine baritone voice ... a sensitive human being and an effective leader of the congregation".

By 1916, the congregation had installed 10 <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> windows, electric lighting, a new <a href="pulpit">pulpit</a>, and two large bronze <a href="Menorah%20%28Hanukkah%29">menorahs</a>, and employed six people. Dues were $12 (today $) per year, and Sunday school fees were $0.02 (today $0) per session. Membership had grown to 140 families by 1919. The congregational school held classes daily, and had 400 students and 20 teachers.

<a href="Sidney%20Weinberg">Sidney Weinberg</a>, who rose from the job of assistant porter to head <a href="Goldman%20Sachs">Goldman Sachs</a> from 1930 to 1969, was married at Baith Israel Anshei Emes in 1920. The Weinberg family, which had joined the synagogue when it was still on Beorum Place, was also very active in the synagogue; Sidney's mother, Sophie, was sisterhood president from 1912 to 1913, and his father, Pincus, served as president from 1919 to 1921, and the children all attended the Sunday school and Talmud Torah. The Weinbergs subsequently moved to <a href="Flatbush%2C%20Brooklyn">Flatbush</a>, where in 1924 Pincus became the first president of the <a href="East%20Midwood%20Jewish%20Center">East Midwood Jewish Center</a>.

In 1924, a fire almost destroyed the upper level of the school building, but the congregation repaired the damage. Another renovation was begun in 1928, and included installing illuminated stained glass over the <a href="Ark%20%28synagogue%29">ark</a> and bronze memorial tablets at the rear of the sanctuary, and repainting the sanctuary walls and columns in a <a href="trompe-l%27%C5%93il">trompe-l'œil</a> manner imitating <a href="Jerusalem%20stone">Jerusalem stone</a> and <a href="marble">marble</a>.

On its 75th anniversary in 1931, the congregation received a congratulatory message from <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>. Additional congratulatory messages arrived from <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20New%20York">Governor</a> (later President) <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, Lieutenant Governor <a href="Herbert%20H.%20Lehman">Herbert H. Lehman</a>, <a href="Mayor%20of%20New%20York%20City">Mayor</a> <a href="Jimmy%20Walker">Jimmy Walker</a>, and <a href="Felix%20M.%20Warburg">Felix M. Warburg</a>. Nevertheless, the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> brought difficult times; officers were no longer paid their salaries, and were informed in 1932 that they would have to "wait indefinitely" to receive their back wages. In 1933, the synagogue abolished fixed wages entirely for its employees, and instead paid them on a "month-to-month basis", depending on what the congregation could afford.

In 1932 women were allowed to join the choir. In <a href="Tzniut%23Female%20singing%20voice">deference to traditionalists</a>, however, the choir was moved to the organ loft, so that the women would be less visible.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Herman Belth raised $20,000 (today $) and contributed another $20,000 for another renovation of the synagogue. The building was fortified, the interior (except the front wall) repainted, and the exterior brick walls, which had been clad in "blue-veined white stone", were refinished with "<a href="brownstone">brownstone</a> type <a href="stucco">stucco</a>ed slabs". When the renovations were complete, the synagogue was re-dedicated in January 1953. Despite Belth's efforts, membership continued to decline, as congregants <a href="Suburbanization">moved to the suburbs</a>. Though the Centennial Celebrations of 1956 "provided a brief burst of energy for the Congregation and produced funds to maintain the Synagogue", during this period the choir was disbanded, the Sunday School and Talmud Torah closed, and paid staff reduced.

In the 1960s, following Goldfarb's retirement, the synagogue hired a series of part-time rabbis, including Goldfarb's grandson, Henry D. Michelman, who served as rabbi from 1967 to 1971. Michelman, who would later become the Executive Vice President of the <a href="Synagogue%20Council%20of%20America">Synagogue Council of America</a>, was, like his grandfather, a talented musician, composing music for synagogues and churches, writing <a href="Film%20score">scores</a> for television films for <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>, <a href="A%26amp%3BE%20Network">A&E</a>, <a href="CNBC">CNBC</a>, and <a href="Public%20Broadcasting%20Service">PBS</a>, and serving as Chairman of the American Society of Jewish Music.

The membership decline continued in the late 1960s and early 1970s, as older congregants died and moved away, and dwindled to the point where the congregation could no longer afford to heat the sanctuary, and thought they would have to disband. Nevertheless, in 1972 the congregation established a nursery school and "prozdor" (high school).

Changing demographics and new synagogue programs helped the congregation recover from its low point in the 1970s. In 1979, Raymond Scheindlin, a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Ph.D.</a> in <a href="Arabic%20literature">Arabic literature</a> from <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, and professor of <a href="Piyyut">medieval Hebrew poetry</a> at the <a href="Jewish%20Theological%20Seminary%20of%20America">Jewish Theological Seminary of America</a> (JTSA), became the part-time rabbi of the congregation, replacing Howard Gorin, who had served since 1976. Scheindlin had become a member in 1974, after joining the faculty of the JTSA and moving to <a href="Brooklyn%20Heights">Brooklyn Heights</a>, and from that point on <a href="Torah%20reading">read the Torah</a> every week and served as <a href="hazzan">cantor</a>. He also encouraged the re-constitution of a choir, which called itself "the DeRossi Singers" after <a href="Salamone%20Rossi">Salamone DeRossi</a>, the leading Jewish composer of the late <a href="Italian%20Renaissance">Italian Renaissance</a>, whose works the choir sang. Even after leaving the synagogue, Scheindlin continued to return to serve as cantor for the High Holidays every year until 2016.

In 1982 Scheindlin stated that the membership had grown to the point where it again required the services of a full-time rabbi, and the congregation hired Jonathan Ginsburg as its first full-time rabbi since Israel Goldfarb's retirement. Ginsburg developed adult education and young singles programs, and improved standards in the synagogue's children's education programs. Geoffrey Goldberg followed him as rabbi from 1987 to 1988.

In 1994 the buildings' stained glass windows, parapet tower, and brownstone were repaired, landscaping redone, and, with a grant from the <a href="Sol%20Goldman">Sol Goldman</a> Charitable trust, the "<a href="Bema%23Judaism">bimah</a>" and vestibule were refurbished. Membership had increased to almost 200 families by 1995, and in 1996 Samuel H. Weintraub was hired as rabbi.

In 1961 the synagogue began granting women some pulpit honors, giving the Sisterhood President "<a href="Torah%20reading%23Hagbaha%20and%20Gelila">gelila</a>", and in 1966 granting married couples "hagbaha and gelila" (the honors of lifting and re-wrapping the Torah after it has been read). In the 1970s, women became more involved in the synagogue's political and religious activities: in 1972, the first woman was elected to the board of trustees, and in 1975, the congregation began <a href="Torah%20reading%23Aliyot">calling women to the Torah</a> and counting women in the "<a href="minyan">minyan</a>", the latter just two years after the <a href="Committee%20on%20Jewish%20Law%20and%20Standards">Committee on Jewish Law and Standards</a> of the <a href="Rabbinical%20Assembly">Rabbinical Assembly</a> voted nine to four in favor of this innovation.

In 1980, Nancy Fink, a <a href="Brooklyn%20Law%20School">Brooklyn Law School</a> professor, was elected as the congregation's first female president. Fink called a full membership meeting in 1982 to decide whether women could lead the services, blow the <a href="shofar">shofar</a> (the rams-horn trumpet blown on the High Holidays), and whether daughters of "<a href="kohen">kohanim</a>" (hereditary priests) could give the <a href="priestly%20blessing">priestly blessing</a>. Advised by Scheindlin, the congregation decided to make the services fully egalitarian, allowing women to perform all three functions.

Baith Israel Anshei Emes's move to egalitarianism culminated in August 1988, when Debra Cantor was hired as its first female rabbi, making it the first synagogue in the <a href="Northeastern%20United%20States">Northeastern United States</a> to be led by a woman. Cantor, who was 33 at the time, had been <a href="valedictorian">valedictorian</a> of that year's graduating class at the <a href="Jewish%20Theological%20Seminary%20of%20America">Jewish Theological Seminary</a>. The decision was not accepted by all congregants; the Conservative movement had ordained its first female rabbi, <a href="Amy%20Eilberg">Amy Eilberg</a>, only three years before, in 1985, and following Cantor's appointment a number of families left the synagogue to form B'nai Avraham, an <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox</a> congregation in <a href="Brooklyn%20Heights%2C%20Brooklyn">Brooklyn Heights</a>.

In 2002 Baith Israel Anshei Emes received a $1 million grant for building renovations from Lillian Goldman, just weeks before her death; she had previously donated $20 million for the reconstruction and expansion of <a href="Lillian%20Goldman%20Law%20Library">Yale Law School's library</a>, and $5 million to Manhattan's <a href="92nd%20Street%20Y">92nd Street Y</a> for a family center there. After raising over $2 million more, including a $54,000 grant from the Jewish Communal Fund, in 2003 the congregation began re-building the three story school/community center from the ground up, leaving only the historic <a href="facade">facade</a>. In 2004 the building was re-opened as the "Sol and Lillian Goldman Education Center", and a day-time pre-school launched. Though the sanctuary also needed extensive repairs, the renovations of the school/community center were undertaken first because the congregation decided "a venue for social functions is at the heart of every cohesive religious group". The following year, the school received a $25,000 grant from the Edith Glick Shoolman Children's Foundation "[t]o assist in the development of the Kane Street Kids program for pre-school age children housed in the Congregation's Early Childhood Center".

Nearly 300 households were members by 2006, and in the same year, the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Office%20of%20Parks%2C%20Recreation%20and%20Historic%20Preservation">New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation</a> awarded the synagogue a grant of $350,000 for exterior restoration of the sanctuary. The grant was part of a million-dollar capital campaign that the membership intended to carry out in 2008, as the synagogue building still required extensive repairs: the roof leaked, causing interior damage, and (along with the <a href="Rain%20gutter">gutters</a>) needed to be replaced; interior columns were taped to prevent plaster from falling off them; the sanctuary doors needed to be replaced; and the stained glass windows needed to be removed, the metal holding them repaired, and their wooden framing replaced. In 2007 the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites Program awarded Baith Israel Anshei Emes grants totaling $17,500, for copper roof and masonry restoration.

The congregation had been supportive of gays since at least the early 1990s, and following the late 2006 decision by the <a href="Committee%20on%20Jewish%20Law%20and%20Standards">Committee on Jewish Law and Standards</a> to allow same-sex <a href="commitment%20ceremonies">commitment ceremonies</a>, in 2007 Baith Israel Anshei Emes voted to follow suit. The day before <a href="Yom%20Kippur">Yom Kippur</a>, 2009, the synagogue was picketed by members of the <a href="Westboro%20Baptist%20Church">Westboro Baptist Church</a>, who shouted antisemitic and anti-gay slogans.

Led by Rabbi Samuel H. Weintraub since 1996, Baith Israel Anshei Emes is the oldest continuously operating synagogue in Brooklyn.

Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleship

The "Sovetsky Soyuz"-class battleships (Project 23, , "Soviet Union"), also known as "Stalin's Republics", were a class of <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s begun by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in the late 1930s but never brought into service. They were designed in response to the battleships being built by Germany. Only four hulls of the fifteen originally planned had been <a href="laid%20down">laid down</a> by 1940, when the decision was made to cut the program to only three ships to divert resources to an expanded army rearmament program.

These ships would have rivaled the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese">Imperial Japanese</a> and America's planned in size if any had been completed, although with significantly weaker firepower: nine guns compared to the nine guns of the Japanese ships and a dozen on the "Montana"s. The failure of the Soviet armor plate industry to build <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armour">cemented armor</a> plates thicker than would have negated any advantages from the "Sovetsky Soyuz" class's thicker armor in combat.

Construction of the first four ships was plagued with difficulties as the Soviet shipbuilding and related industries were not prepared to build such large ships. One battleship, "Sovetskaya Belorussiya", was cancelled on 19 October 1940 after serious construction flaws were found. Construction of the other three ships was suspended shortly after <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union</a> in June 1941, and never resumed. All three of the surviving hulls were scrapped in the late 1940s.

Design work began in 1935 on new battleships in response to the existing and planned German battleships, and the Soviets made extensive efforts in Italy and the United States to purchase either drawings or the ships themselves in the late 1930s. The Italian firm of <a href="Gio.%20Ansaldo%20%26amp%3B%20C.">Gio. Ansaldo & C.</a> proposed a ship of <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29%23Standard%20displacement">standard displacement</a> with nine 16-inch (406 mm) guns, in size and appearance similar to the then under construction by the company. The U.S. firm of <a href="Gibbs%20%26amp%3B%20Cox">Gibbs & Cox</a> provided four designs; one for a conventional battleship, and three hybrid designs which combined battleship main armament with a raised flight deck on the central superstructure capable of operating up to 30 aircraft. While these projects proved useful to the Soviets, they decided to proceed with their own designs.

The first Tactical-Technical Requirement (abbreviated in Russian as ТТЗ) for the large battleship design was issued on 21 February 1936 but proved too ambitious, specifying nine 460 mm guns and a speed of on a displacement of 55,000 tons. The TTZ was revised in May 1936 by Admiral <a href="Vladimir%20Mitrofanovich%20Orlov">Orlov</a>, Commander of the <a href="Soviet%20Navy">Soviet Navy</a>, reducing speed to , and weakening the secondary and <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> batteries. A few months later Admiral Orlov further reduced the size of the battleship to 45,000 tons and set the size of the main guns at 406 mm. Shortly afterward, the Soviet Union signed the Anglo-Soviet Quantitative Naval Agreement of 1937 and agreed to follow the terms of the <a href="Second%20London%20Naval%20Treaty">Second London Naval Treaty</a> that limited battleships to a displacement of 35,560 metric tons (35,000 long tons), although they did add a proviso that allowed them to build ships of unlimited size to face the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> if they notified the British. Yet another TTZ was approved by Orlov on 3 August for ships of 41,500 tons with an armament of nine 406-millimeter, twelve , twelve , and forty guns, a maximum armor thickness of and a speed of 30 knots.

The design of KB-4, the surface ship design bureau of the <a href="Baltic%20Shipyard">Baltic Shipyard</a>, was selected for further development although the lead designers were convinced that only a larger ship could fulfill the ambitious requirements. They did manage to get agreement on 22 November 1936 for a thickening of the deck armor that raised the displacement to about 47,000 tons. Design work continued on this basis and technical work was completed for a ship of 47,700 tons in April 1937, but the designers continued to press their case for larger ships. The issue was resolved by <a href="Premier">Premier</a> <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Stalin</a> at a meeting on 4 July when he agreed to increase displacement to about 56,000 tons. This forced the project to begin again.

The timing of the redesign proved to be inauspicious as the <a href="Great%20Purge">Great Purge</a> was spreading through the ranks of the military and related industries. The original deadline for completion of design work by 15 October was missed, and an incomplete version was presented to the navy's Shipbuilding Administration the next month. A number of details remained to be worked out, including the final design of the machinery plant, the 152 mm guns and the 100 mm gun mounts. In the meantime, extensive and expensive testing was conducted on the ship's hull form, deck armor and torpedo protection; 27 million <a href="ruble">ruble</a>s were spent on experimental work in 1938 alone. Over 100 models of the hull were tested in a <a href="ship%20model%20basin">ship model basin</a> to find the best hull form and two one-tenth-scale launches were built at <a href="Sevastopol">Sevastopol</a> to test the hull's maneuverability. An old steamship was fitted with a replica of the design's armor decks and tested against bombs, proving that such ordnance would generally penetrate both the upper and middle decks before exploding on the armored deck. The main armor deck was raised one deck in consequence and a <a href="splinter%20deck">splinter deck</a> added underneath it to stop any bomb or shell fragments that might penetrate the armor deck. The underwater protection system was tested on fifteen one-fifth scale models and two full-sized experimental barges. These tests proved that the <a href="torpedo%20belt">torpedo belt</a> system of multiple <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>s was superior to the <a href="Vittorio%20Veneto-class%20battleship%23The%20Pugliese%20torpedo%20defense">Pugliese system</a> of a large tube filled with smaller sealed tubes, but it was too late to incorporate these test results into the design as construction was well underway by the time they were completed in late 1939.

A revised design was approved on 28 February 1938 and the first ship was to be laid down on 15 July, but even this design was incomplete and would be revised later. Trials with similarly shaped <a href="motor%20launch">motor launch</a>es suggested that the hull's propulsive efficiency would be less than planned, and this was accepted in the November 1938 revision as a maximum speed of . However, a new propeller design proved to be more efficient and was predicted to increase speed to . Another change was the deletion of the centerline rudder when tests showed that the two wing rudders would not be able to counteract its effects if it jammed. The weight toward the stern of the boat was calculated to be too great, producing a substantial stern-down trim. To remedy this, the two 100 mm turrets mounted on the quarterdeck were deleted and the height of the armor belt abreast the rear turret was lowered, but this decision was reversed and they were restored by a decision of the State Defense Committee on 14 January 1941. This forced a revision of the aircraft arrangements as the <a href="aircraft%20catapult">aircraft catapult</a> had to be removed from the centerline of the quarterdeck; two catapults were added to the sides of the quarterdeck instead.

As designed, the Project 23-class ships, as "Sovetsky Soyuz" and her sisters were designated, were long <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>. They had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and at full load a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draft</a> of . They displaced at standard load and at full load, although weight estimates made in 1940 show that they would have exceeded standard and at full load.

The hull form was very full-bodied, especially at the forward <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s, where the torpedo protection system added width to the beam. Coupled with the relatively low length-to-beam ratio of 7.14:1, this meant that very powerful turbines were necessary to achieve even modest speeds. Stalin's decision that the Project 23-class ships would use three shafts instead of four increased the <a href="structural%20load">load</a> on each shaft and reduced propulsive efficiency, although it did shorten the length of the <a href="armored%20citadel">armored citadel</a> and thus overall displacement. <a href="Metacentric%20height">Metacentric height</a> was designed at and the tactical diameter was estimated at about .

The "Sovetsky Soyuz"-class ships were provided with aircraft facilities to handle two to four <a href="Beriev%20Be-4">KOR-2</a> <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a>s which would be launched by the two catapults mounted on the stern. Two hangars were built into the after end of the forecastle deck to house two of them and cranes were provided at the forward end of the quarterdeck to hoist them out of the water.

The machinery arrangement "provided good dispersal of the machinery spaces, but at the cost of very long runs for the wing shafts (ca. )". The turbine compartments for the wing shafts were located forward of boiler room No. 1 and aft of the No. 2 turret magazines. The engine room for the center shaft's turbine was between boiler room No. 2 and No. 3. This meant that the wing propeller shafts had to run underneath the boilers.

The <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, and a license to build them, were originally going to be ordered from <a href="Cammell%20Laird">Cammell Laird</a> in the United Kingdom, but their £700,000 cost was more than the Soviets wanted to pay. Instead they bought them from <a href="Brown%2C%20Boveri%20%26amp%3B%20Cie">Brown Boveri</a>, using the technical information acquired from Cammell Laird in the process, for £400,000. Four single-reduction, impulse-reduction geared turbines were ordered from the <a href="Switzerland">Swiss</a> firm, three to equip "Sovetskaya Rossiya" and one to serve as a pattern for the factory in <a href="Kharkiv">Kharkov</a> that was to build the remainder. The three produced a total of . Six triangle-type <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s — two in each boiler room — powered the turbines at a working pressure of and a temperature of .

Maximum speed was estimated at 28 knots, using the revised propeller design, although forcing the machinery would yield an extra knot. The normal <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> capacity was , giving an estimated endurance of at and at full speed. Maximum fuel capacity was which gave a range of at 14.5 knots and at full speed.

The main armament consisted of three electrically powered MK-1 triple turrets, each with three 50-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a> 406 mm B-37 guns. The guns could be depressed to −2° and elevated to 45°. They had a fixed loading angle of 6° and their rate of fire varied with the time required to re-aim the guns. It ranged from 2.0 to 2.6 rounds per minute depending on the elevation. The turrets could elevate at a rate of 6.2 degrees per second and traverse at 4.55 degrees per second. 100 rounds per gun were carried. The guns fired projectiles at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of ; this provided a maximum range of .

The secondary armament consisted of twelve 57-caliber B-38 152 mm guns mounted in six dual MK-4 turrets. Their elevation limits were −5° to +45° with a fixed loading angle of 8°. Their rate of fire also varied with the elevation from 7.5 to 4.8 rounds per minute. They were provided with 170 rounds per gun. The turrets could elevate at a rate of 13 degrees per second and traverse at 6 degrees per second. They had a maximum range of about with a shell at a muzzle velocity of .

Heavy anti-aircraft (AA) fire was provided by a dozen 56-caliber 100 mm B-34 <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a>s in six twin MZ-14 turrets with 400 rounds per gun. The ships began construction with only four turrets, but two additional turrets were restored to the quarterdeck in January 1941. They could elevate to a maximum of 85° and depress to −8°. They could traverse at a rate of 12° per second and elevate at 10° per second. They fired <a href="high%20explosive">high explosive</a> shells at a muzzle velocity of ; this provided a maximum range of against surface targets, but their maximum range against aerial targets was , the limit of their time fuse.

Light AA defense was handled by ten quadruple, water-cooled, 46-K mounts fitted with <a href="37%20mm%20automatic%20air%20defense%20gun%20M1939%20%2861-K%29">70-K</a> guns with 1800 rounds per gun. Initially only eight mounts were planned when the ships began construction, but two more were added later, probably in January 1941, one on each side of the forward superstructure. Each mount was fully enclosed to protect the crew from the muzzle blast of the larger guns and against splinters. The guns fired shells at a muzzle velocity of . Their effective anti-aircraft range was .

Each main gun turret was given a DM-12 <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a> for use in local control, but they were generally controlled by one of three KDP-8 <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control director</a>s. These had two <a href="stereoscopic%20rangefinder">stereoscopic rangefinder</a>s, one to track the target and the other to measure the range to the ship's own shell splashes. Two of these were protected by of armor and were mounted atop the rear superstructure and the tower-mast. The other was mounted on top of the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> and was protected by of armor. They used a TsAS-0 mechanical computer to generate firing solutions. Four KDP-4t-II directors, with two rangefinders each, controlled the secondary armament. One pair was on either side of the tower-mast and the aft pair was on each side of the aft funnel. Three SPN-300 stabilized directors, each with a 4-meter rangefinder, controlled the heavy anti-aircraft guns. There was one on each side of the forward funnel while the other was atop the rear superstructure.

Soviet armor plate plants proved incapable of producing plates of <a href="Krupp%20armour">cemented armor</a> thicker than which forced the decision to replace cemented plates thicker than with <a href="Case%20hardening">face-hardened</a> ones with less resistance in November 1940. The plants tended to compensate by making the thicker plates harder, but this often made them more brittle and large numbers did not pass the acceptance tests. This would have significantly reduced the level of protection enjoyed by the "Sovetsky Soyuz"-class ships in combat.

The "Sovetsky Soyuz"-class ships devoted a total weight of to armor protection, a slightly greater weight than that of the larger Japanese "Yamato" class (). Their armor was intended to resist 406 mm shells and 500 kg bombs, specifically shells fired from forward bearings between 35° and 50° from the centerline. This led to the very unusual situation where the <a href="Belt%20armor">armor belt</a> thickened toward the bow to compensate for the narrowing of the ship near the forward magazines, which had to be compensated for by thicker armor. The belt was long and covered 57% of the total waterline length. It was inclined 5° to increase its resistance to flat-trajectory shells. Over the machinery spaces it was thick and increased in steps until it was thick over the forward magazines. It was over the rear magazine. The belt armor was carried forward of the magazines at a thickness of and terminated in a steeply sloped (30°) transverse bulkhead that reduced to at the lower deck where it was continued down to the inner bottom by a bulkhead. Forward of this bulkhead was a 20 mm splinter belt that continued all the way to the bow. The main armor belt dropped down to the main deck from the upper deck abreast the aft turret to reduce weight. This "step" was protected by plates. A transverse bulkhead separated the rear turret and the ship's sides. The main part of the armored citadel was closed off by a 230 mm forward bulkhead and a rear bulkhead, both of homogeneous armor. Splinter armor thick covered the upper portion of the citadel.

The <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> deck was 25 mm thick while the upper deck was over the citadel. Below it, the 50 mm middle deck acted as a splinter deck. The upper deck was 100 mm thick above the 220 mm waterline belt extension. The bottom edge of the forward splinter belt met with a arched deck. Another arched deck of the same thickness covered the stern aft of the rear transverse bulkhead.

The main gun turrets had faces thick with sides and roofs thick. thick plates protected the gun ports and bulkheads separated each gun. The barbettes were thick above the upper deck. The MK-4 turrets had 100 mm faces and 65 mm sides. Their barbettes were 100 mm in thickness, but reduced to 65 mm on their inboard sides. 100 mm of armor protected the faces, sides and backs of the MZ-14 turrets for the 100 mm guns, but their roofs and barbettes were 100 mm thick. The forward conning tower had walls 425 mm thick while the rear conning tower had only . The flag bridge in the tower-mast had of protection.

The <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> defense system was designed to withstand torpedoes with warheads equivalent to of <a href="Trinitrotoluene">TNT</a>. The ships were intended to be able to remain afloat with any five adjacent compartments flooded or with three torpedo hits and the destruction of the unarmored above-water side. The <a href="Vittorio%20Veneto-class%20battleship%23Pugliese%20torpedo%20defense%20system">Pugliese system</a> protected of the ships' midsection. At the aft end was a multi-bulkhead protection system that extended another to the rear from the Pugliese system. The depth of the system was amidships, but it reduced to fore and aft. The outer plating ranged from in thickness while the inner bottom was thick. The cylinder of the Pugliese system was also 7 mm thick while the semi-circular main bulkhead was thick with a flat bulkhead behind it. The diameter cylinder was intended to be immersed in <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> or water.

The August 1938 shipbuilding plan envisioned a total of 15 Project 23-class battleships, and this grandiose scheme was only slightly revised downward to 14 ships in the August 1939 plan. Eight of these were to be laid down before 1942 and the remaining six before 1947. However, only four were actually laid down before the outbreak of World War II forced the Soviets to reassess their ambitious plans. On 19 October 1940 an order was issued, signed by Stalin and Molotov, that no new battleships would be laid down in order to concentrate on smaller ships' building (and also, probably, because more resources were required for the Army), one ship is to be scrapped, and priority should be given to only one of the three remaining battleships.

The Soviet shipbuilding and related industries proved to be incapable of supporting the construction of so many large ships at the same time. The largest warships built in the Soviet Union prior to 1938 were the s, and even they had suffered from a number of production problems, but the Soviet leadership appeared to ignore the difficulties encountered in the construction of the "Kirov" class when ordering 14 much more ambitious ships. Construction of two more ships planned for <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Leningrad</a> and <a href="Mykolaiv">Nikolayev</a> had to move to the brand-new <a href="Sevmash">Shipyard Nr. 402</a> in <a href="Severodvinsk">Molotovsk</a> because the existing shipyards could not be expanded to handle so many large ships. Components for these two ships had to be manufactured at Leningrad and shipped via the <a href="White%20Sea%20%E2%80%93%20Baltic%20Canal">White Sea – Baltic Canal</a> to Molotovsk. Also, the turret shop at Nikolaev proved to be too poorly equipped to assemble the 406 mm mountings and the propeller shafts had to be ordered in 1940 from Germany and the Netherlands as the domestic plants were already overburdened with orders. Shipbuilding steel proved to be in short supply in 1940, and a number of batches were rejected because they did not meet specifications. Armor plate production was even more problematic as only of the anticipated were delivered in 1939, and more than half of that was rejected. Furthermore, the armor plants proved to be incapable of making cemented plates over 230 mm, and inferior <a href="Case%20hardening">face-hardened</a> plates had to substitute for all thicknesses over 200 mm.

Machinery problems were likely to delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943–1944. Three turbines were delivered by Brown Boveri in 1939 to <a href="Arkhangelsk">Arkhangelsk</a> for "Sovetskaya Rossiya", but the Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. A prototype boiler was supposed to have been built ashore for evaluation, but it was not completed until early 1941, which further complicated the production plan.

Construction of all three ships was ordered halted on 10 July 1941, and "Sovetsky Soyuz" was placed into long-term conservation as the most advanced ship. However, all three were officially stricken from the Navy List on 10 September 1941.

"Sovetsky Soyuz (—Soviet Union)" was formally laid down 15 July 1938 in <a href="Baltic%20Shipyard">Shipyard Nr. 189 (Ordzhonikidze)</a> in Leningrad, although evidence suggests that construction actually began in January 1939 after her slipway was completed, the necessary cranes were in place, and working drawings had been completed. When the war began she was estimated to be 21.19% complete, with of steel assembled on the slip. She was only lightly damaged by German air attacks and bombardments, and, as some material had been used during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Leningrad">Siege of Leningrad</a>, she was estimated to be 19.5% complete after the end of the war. Some thought was given to completing her, but this was opposed as she was regarded as obsolete in light of the experience gained during the war. Stalin's expressed desire to see one of the Project 23-class ships completed only delayed the decision to scrap her; this was ordered on 29 May 1948 and was well underway by April 1949.

"Sovetskaya Ukraina (—Soviet Ukraine)" was laid down 31 October 1938 at <a href="Black%20Sea%20Shipyard">Shipyard Nr. 198 (Marti South)</a> in Nikolayev. When the war began she was 17.98% complete, with assembled on the slipway. Some effort was made to launch the hull, but little work had been done to dredge the river at the foot of the slipway, and she was captured on 18 August 1941, although retreating Soviet troops slightly damaged her hull. The Germans dismantled of her bow and of her stern for use in fortifications. They were forced to evacuate Nikolayev on 17 March 1944 and demolished the supporting blocks under her port side before they left, which gave her a <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> between 5 and 10 degrees and made her a total loss. She was ordered scrapped on 27 March 1947.

"Sovetskaya Rossiya (—Soviet Russia)" was laid down on 22 July 1940 in <a href="Sevmash">Shipyard Nr. 402</a> in <a href="Severodvinsk">Molotovsk</a>. After the end of the war she was only 0.97% complete, with of steel assembled. She was ordered scrapped on 27 March 1947.

"Sovetskaya Belorussiya (—Soviet Belorussia)" was laid down 21 December 1939 at Shipyard Nr. 402 in Molotovsk, but construction was suspended in mid-1940 when it was discovered that 70,000 <a href="rivet">rivet</a>s used in her hull plating were of inferior quality. This fact probably influenced the decision to cancel her on 19 October 1940. Material intended for her construction was used to construct a floating <a href="Artillery%20battery">battery</a> for the <a href="Siege%20of%20Leningrad">defense of Leningrad</a>.

Sam &amp; Max: Freelance Police

Sam & Max: Freelance Police was a <a href="graphic%20adventure%20game">graphic adventure</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="LucasArts">LucasArts</a> from 2002 until its cancellation in 2004, and the final game in the company's <a href="LucasArts%20adventure%20games">adventure game era</a>. "Freelance Police" was originally intended for release for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> in early 2004 as a sequel to the 1993 title "<a href="Sam%20%26amp%3B%20Max%20Hit%20the%20Road">Sam & Max Hit the Road</a>". The game was based on the characters <a href="Sam%20%26amp%3B%20Max">Sam & Max</a>: an <a href="anthropomorphic">anthropomorphic</a> <a href="dog">dog</a> and "hyperkinetic <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>y thing" who debuted in a 1987 <a href="comic%20book">comic book series</a> created by <a href="Steve%20Purcell">Steve Purcell</a>. "Freelance Police" was announced in August 2002, and showcased at the <a href="E3%20%28Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%29">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) in 2003. Like its predecessor, "Freelance Police" was designed as a <a href="point-and-click">point-and-click</a> adventure game, but used a <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> in place of the <a href="SCUMM">SCUMM</a> and <a href="GrimE">GrimE</a> engines used in older LucasArts adventure games. The project's development was led by <a href="Michael%20Stemmle">Michael Stemmle</a>, one of the original designers for "Sam & Max Hit the Road", while Steve Purcell assisted in developing the game's plot and providing artistic direction.

Although the game's development appeared to be proceeding towards completion without difficulty, LucasArts abruptly canceled production of "Freelance Police" in March 2004, citing economic and market conditions. The game's cancellation was received poorly by fans of the series, Steve Purcell, and the <a href="Video%20game%20journalism">video game industry media</a>. Many journalists viewed this move as a culmination in the decline of the adventure game genre. LucasArts later terminated its adventure game development, and many of the "Freelance Police" design team left to create <a href="Telltale%20Games">Telltale Games</a> and continue development of such adventure games. Steve Purcell moved the "Sam & Max" franchise to Telltale Games in 2005, prompting a revival of "Sam & Max" video games.

"Sam & Max: Freelance Police" was designed by LucasArts as a <a href="graphic%20adventure%20game">graphic adventure game</a> and sequel to the 1993 title "<a href="Sam%20%26amp%3B%20Max%20Hit%20the%20Road">Sam & Max Hit the Road</a>". The game was to feature <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D computer graphics</a> rendered in real-time. The <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> contained elements from other LucasArts games, including those from "<a href="Gladius%20%28video%20game%29">Gladius</a>", "<a href="RTX%20Red%20Rock">RTX Red Rock</a>", "" and "". Graphical features such as <a href="shader">shader</a>s, <a href="bump%20map">bump map</a>s and <a href="lightmap">lightmap</a>s were used to give a 3D effect to 2D textures in the game. Little was revealed of the gameplay, other than that "Freelance Police" would not follow the same control scheme used in 3D LucasArts adventures "<a href="Grim%20Fandango">Grim Fandango</a>" and "<a href="Escape%20from%20Monkey%20Island">Escape from Monkey Island</a>", but would return to <a href="point-and-click">point-and-click</a> mechanics used in the 2D LucasArts games. As in "Sam & Max Hit the Road", "Freelance Police" would contain a mixture of optional and compulsory <a href="minigames">minigames</a>, 19 in total. The game was designed so that the <a href="player%20character">player character</a> could not die or reach a dead end.

Few details were revealed about the game's plot. In a January 2004 interview, lead designer Michael Stemmle provided a rough outline: the game's story was "really six stories, loosely held together by a thrilling über-plot". Each individual story contained a separate case for the Freelance Police, taking place in a variety of environments, including a <a href="space%20station">space station</a> and a <a href="neopaganism">neopagan</a> <a href="bacchanal">bacchanal</a>, and featuring "freakish bad guys". Stemmle stated that the intention was to keep the "über-plot" concealed for a while, but noted that it contained "all the barely plausible grandeur that fans have come to expect from "Sam and Max"". <a href="Steve%20Purcell">Steve Purcell</a>, the creator of "Sam & Max", assisted in the development of both the plot and the artistic direction, producing concept art of various characters and locales. Besides the return of the title characters, only one other character, Flint Paper, was confirmed for the game. Described by Stemmle as "the Freelance Police's rough 'n' tumble private detective neighbour", Paper is briefly featured in "Sam & Max" comics and makes an offstage appearance in "Sam & Max Hit the Road". Stemmle had Paper planned for a "critical role" in the game's plot.

Due to the nature of the story, LucasArts considered releasing the game in <a href="episodic%20games">episodic</a> fashion and using <a href="digital%20distribution">digital distribution</a>, an option favored by the development team but opposed by the management division, who preferred the more traditional methods of retail distribution. Post-release bonus content was also considered; Stemmle remarked that such content would include new <a href="power-up">power-up</a>s, minigames and "maybe even entirely new interactive "Sam & Max" cases [the player] can download".

The development of a sequel to "Sam & Max Hit the Road" was announced by <a href="LucasArts">LucasArts</a> on August 27, 2002. In their press release, LucasArts president <a href="Simon%20Jeffery">Simon Jeffery</a> stated that "the "Sam & Max" sequel, much like the recently announced "", perfectly complements LucasArts' renowned adventure game legacy and lends further support to the company's commitment to investing in and developing more of our original properties". LucasArts revealed no additional details at the time beyond a projected release in the first quarter of 2004. The game was officially announced for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> at the <a href="E3%20%28Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%29">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> convention on May 12, 2003, where the full title "Sam & Max: Freelance Police" was revealed. LucasArts reaffirmed the projected early 2004 release date at the convention. The game's trailer was also presented at E3, reintroducing the characters and confirming that the original voice actors for Sam and Max, <a href="Bill%20Farmer">Bill Farmer</a> and <a href="Nick%20Jameson">Nick Jameson</a> respectively, were set to reprise their roles. Over the following months, several minor media releases were made, revealing new information regarding the game's developmental direction and graphical style. The game's release was highly anticipated by journalists in the video game industry, who published various previews and interviews with the development team, particularly with lead designer Michael Stemmle, one of the original designers of "Sam & Max Hit the Road".
In August 2003, LucasArts halted production on the "<a href="Full%20Throttle%20%281995%20video%20game%29">Full Throttle</a>" adventure game sequel "Hell on Wheels", leading the magazine <a href="Hyper%20%28magazine%29">"Hyper"</a> to speculate that "Freelance Police" might suffer a similar fate. LucasArts reassured the media that "Freelance Police" was still in production and was nearing completion, reiterating that the game would be released in 2004. Media coverage continued; for example, <a href="PC%20Gamer">"PC Gamer" US</a> ran an interview with Stemmle as a cover story in February 2004. However, on March 3, 2004, LucasArts abruptly announced the cancellation of "Freelance Police". In a short press release, LucasArts' Acting General Manager, Mike Nelson, stated that "after careful evaluation of current market place realities and underlying economic considerations, we've decided that this was not the appropriate time to launch a graphic adventure on the PC".

The reaction to the game's cancellation was overwhelmingly negative. Commentators in the industry media felt that the decision was representative of the diminishing relevance of adventure games, with many concluding that LucasArts was moving to maintain its position with low risk "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>"-themed titles instead of the <a href="LucasArts%20adventure%20games">adventure games</a> that had brought them success in earlier years. "Freelance Police"s cancellation is often cited as the culmination of the adventure genre's decline. The decision came so suddenly that some magazines accidentally published favorable previews of the game after LucasArts' announcement. A fan web site named "Save Sam and Max" presented a petition of 32,000 signatures to LucasArts conveying the fans' disappointment. Steve Purcell, the creator of the "Sam & Max" franchise, stated that he was disappointed by LucasArts' decision:

According to Stemmle, the cancellation decision was prompted by the report of an external marketing analysis group hired by LucasArts, which claimed that the European market for adventure games "had simply disappeared. Not shrunk, not cratered, just... disappeared". A newly established German company, Bad Brain Entertainment, claimed to have entered negotiations with LucasArts to acquire the game, although nothing resulted from these talks. LucasArts subsequently dismissed many of the designers involved with developing their adventure games, and in 2006 stated that they did not intend to return to the adventure genre until the next decade. Some of the former "Freelance Police" development team formed <a href="Telltale%20Games">Telltale Games</a> in June 2004 to continue developing the sort of adventure games that LucasArts no longer wished to produce. Telltale Games later unsuccessfully attempted to buy the rights to "Freelance Police" from LucasArts, which would have enabled the team to finish developing the game. When the LucasArts license expired in mid-2005, Purcell took the franchise to Telltale Games, where it was developed into an episodic series of games. However, very little of the work done on "Freelance Police" was carried over by the developers to Telltale Games; LucasArts still held onto the game's assets and Telltale was wary about using similar design patterns. The new series debuted in October 2006 with "<a href="Sam%20%26amp%3B%20Max%20Save%20the%20World">Sam & Max Save the World</a>".

Edwin P. Morrow

Edwin Porch Morrow (November 28, 1877June 15, 1935) was an <a href="Americans">American</a> politician, who served as the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Kentucky">40th</a> <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Governor of Kentucky</a> from 1919 to 1923. He was the only <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> elected to this office between 1907 and 1927. He championed the typical Republican causes of his day, namely equal rights for <a href="African-American">African-American</a>s and the use of force to quell violence. Morrow had been schooled in his party's principles by his father, <a href="Thomas%20Z.%20Morrow">Thomas Z. Morrow</a>, who was its candidate for governor in 1883, and his uncle, <a href="William%20O.%20Bradley">William O. Bradley</a>, who was elected governor in 1895. Both men were founding members of the Republican Party in Kentucky.

After rendering non-combat service in the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>, Morrow graduated from the <a href="University%20of%20Cincinnati%20Law%20School">University of Cincinnati Law School</a> in 1902 and opened his practice in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington</a>, Kentucky. He made a name for himself almost immediately by securing the acquittal of a black man who had been charged with murder based on an extorted confession and perjured testimony. He was appointed <a href="United%20States%20Attorney">U.S. District Attorney</a> for the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Eastern%20District%20of%20Kentucky">Eastern District of Kentucky</a> by President <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft">William Howard Taft</a> in 1910 and served until he was removed from office in 1913 by President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>. In 1915, he ran for governor against his good friend, <a href="Augustus%20O.%20Stanley">Augustus O. Stanley</a>. Stanley won the election by 471 votes, making the 1915 contest the closest gubernatorial race in the state's history.

Morrow ran for governor again in 1919. His opponent, <a href="James%20D.%20Black">James D. Black</a>, had ascended to the governorship earlier that year when Stanley resigned to take a seat in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a>. Morrow encouraged voters to "Right the Wrong of 1915" and ran on a <a href="Progressivism%20in%20the%20United%20States">progressive</a> platform that included <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a> and quelling <a href="Mass%20racial%20violence%20in%20the%20United%20States">racial violence</a>. He charged the Democratic administration with corruption, citing specific examples, and won the general election in a landslide. With a friendly legislature in 1920, he passed much of his agenda into law including an anti-<a href="lynching">lynching</a> law and a reorganization of state government. He won national acclaim for preventing the lynching of a black prisoner in 1920. He was not hesitant to remove local officials who did not prevent or quell mob violence. By 1922, Democrats regained control of the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a>, and Morrow was not able to accomplish much in the second half of his term. Following his term as governor, he served on the United States Railroad Labor Board and the Railway Mediation Board, but never again held elected office. He died of a heart attack on June 15, 1935, while living with a cousin in <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a>.

Edwin Morrow was of Scottish descent and was born to Thomas Zanzinger and Virginia Catherine (Bradley) Morrow in <a href="Somerset%2C%20Kentucky">Somerset</a>, Kentucky, on November 28, 1877. He and his twin brother, Charles, were the youngest of eight children. His father was one of the founders of the Republican Party in Kentucky and an unsuccessful candidate for governor in 1883. His mother was a sister to <a href="William%20O%27Connell%20Bradley">William O'Connell Bradley</a>, who was elected the first Republican governor of Kentucky in 1895. Morrow's great-grandfather Thomas Morrow emigrated to America from Scotland before the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a>.

Morrow's early education was in the public schools of Somerset. At age 14, he entered preparatory school at <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%20College%20%28Kentucky%29">St. Mary's College</a> near <a href="Lebanon%2C%20Kentucky">Lebanon</a>, Kentucky. He continued there throughout 1891 and 1892. From there, he enrolled at Cumberland College (now the <a href="University%20of%20the%20Cumberlands">University of the Cumberlands</a>) in <a href="Williamsburg%2C%20Kentucky">Williamsburg, Kentucky</a>, and distinguished himself in the debating society. He was also interested in sports, playing <a href="Halfback%20%28American%20football%29">halfback</a> on the <a href="American%20football">football</a> team and <a href="Left%20fielder">left field</a> on the baseball team.

On June 24, 1898, Morrow enlisted as a <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a> in the 4th Kentucky Infantry Regiment for service in the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>. He was first stationed at <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>, and later trained at <a href="Anniston%2C%20Alabama">Anniston, Alabama</a>. Due to a bout with <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>, he never saw active duty, and mustered out as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> on February 12, 1899. In 1900, he matriculated for the fall semester at the <a href="University%20of%20Cincinnati%20Law%20School">University of Cincinnati Law School</a>. He graduated with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Laws">Bachelor of Laws</a> degree in 1902.

Morrow opened his practice in Lexington. He established his reputation in one of his first cases—the trial of William Moseby, a black man accused of murder. Moseby's first trial had ended in a <a href="hung%20jury">hung jury</a>, but because the evidence against him included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his second trial. Unable to find a defense lawyer for Moseby, the judge in the case turned to Morrow, who as a young lawyer was eager for work. Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he had been told that a lynch mob waited outside the jail for him, but no such mob had ever existed. Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client was false. Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902.

Morrow returned to Somerset in 1903. There, he married Katherine Hale Waddle on June 18, 1903. Waddle's father had studied law under Morrow's father, and Edwin and Katherine had been playmates, schoolmates, and later sweethearts. The couple had two children, Edwina Haskell in July 1904 and Charles Robert in November 1908.

In 1904, Morrow was appointed <a href="city%20attorney">city attorney</a> for Somerset, serving until 1908. President <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft">William Howard Taft</a> appointed him <a href="United%20States%20Attorney">U.S. District Attorney</a> for the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Eastern%20District%20of%20Kentucky">Eastern District of Kentucky</a> in 1910. He continued in this position until he was removed from office by President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> in 1913.
Morrow's first political experience was working in his uncle William O. Bradley's gubernatorial campaign in 1895. In 1899, Republican gubernatorial candidate <a href="William%20S.%20Taylor">William S. Taylor</a> offered to make Morrow his <a href="Kentucky%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> in exchange for Bradley's support in the election; Bradley refused. Despite the encouragement of friends, Morrow declined to run for governor in 1911.

In 1912, Morrow was chosen as the Republican candidate for the Senate seat of <a href="Thomas%20Paynter">Thomas Paynter</a>. Paynter had decided not to seek re-election, and the Democrats nominated <a href="Ollie%20M.%20James">Ollie M. James</a> of <a href="Crittenden%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Crittenden County</a>. The <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a> was heavily Democratic and united behind James. On a joint ballot, James defeated Morrow by a vote of 105–28. Due to the passage of the <a href="Seventeenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Seventeenth Amendment</a> the next year, this was the last time the Kentucky legislature would elect a senator.

At the state Republican convention in Lexington on June 15, 1915, Morrow was chosen as the Republican candidate for governor over Latt F. McLaughlin. His <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> opponent was his close friend, <a href="Augustus%20O.%20Stanley">Augustus O. Stanley</a>. Morrow charged previous Democratic administrations with corruption and called for the election of a Republican because "You cannot clean house with a dirty broom." Both men ran on progressive platforms, and the election went in Stanley's favor by only 471 votes. Although it was the closest gubernatorial vote in the state's history, Morrow refused to challenge the results, which greatly increased his popularity. His decision was influenced by the fact that a challenge would be decided by the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a>, which had a Democratic majority in both houses.

Morrow served as a delegate to the <a href="Republican%20National%20Convention">Republican National Convention</a> in <a href="1916%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1916</a>, <a href="1920%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1920</a>, and <a href="1928%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1928</a>. In 1919, he was chosen by acclamation as his party's candidate for governor. This time, his opponent was <a href="James%20D.%20Black">James D. Black</a>. Black was Stanley's <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">lieutenant governor</a> and had ascended to the governorship in May 1919 when Stanley resigned to take a seat in the U.S. Senate.

Morrow encouraged the state's voters to "Right the Wrong of 1915". He again ran on a progressive platform, advocating an amendment to the <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">state constitution</a> to grant women's suffrage. His support was not as strong for a <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">prohibition</a> amendment. He attacked the Stanley–Black administration as corrupt. Days before the election, he exposed a contract awarded by the state Board of Control to a non-existent company. Historian <a href="Lowell%20H.%20Harrison">Lowell H. Harrison</a> argued that Black's refusal to remove the members of the board following this revelation probably sealed his defeat. Morrow won the general election by more than 40,000 votes. It was the largest margin of victory for a Republican gubernatorial candidate in the state's history.
On January 6, 1920, Governor Morrow signed the bill ratifying the <a href="Nineteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Nineteenth Amendment</a>, making Kentucky the 23rd state to ratify it, and the moment is captured in a photograph with members of the <a href="Kentucky%20Equal%20Rights%20Association">Kentucky Equal Rights Association</a>. During the 1920 legislative session, the Republicans held a majority in the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">state House of Representatives</a> and were a minority by only two votes in the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">state Senate</a>. During the session, Morrow was often able to convince C. W. Burton, a Democratic senator from <a href="Grant%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Grant County</a>, to support Republican proposals. Tie votes in the Senate were broken by Republican lieutenant governor <a href="S.%20Thruston%20Ballard">S. Thruston Ballard</a>. Consequently, Morrow was able to effect a considerable reorganization of the state government, including replacing the Board of Control with a nonpartisan Board of Charities and Corrections, centralizing highway works, and revising property taxes. He oversaw improvements to the education system, including better textbook selection and a tax on racetracks to support a minimum salary for teachers. Among Morrow's reforms that did not pass was a proposal to make the <a href="judiciary">judiciary</a> nonpartisan.

Morrow urged enforcement of state laws against <a href="Concealed%20carry%20in%20the%20United%20States">carrying concealed weapons</a> and restricted activities of the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. During his first year in office, he granted only 100 pardons. This was a considerable decrease from the number granted by his immediate predecessors. During their first years in office, <a href="J.%20C.%20W.%20Beckham">J. C. W. Beckham</a> granted 350 pardons, <a href="James%20B.%20McCreary">James B. McCreary</a> (during his second stint as governor) granted 139, and Augustus O. Stanley granted 257. He was also an active member of the <a href="Commission%20on%20Interracial%20Cooperation">Commission on Interracial Cooperation</a>, a society for the elimination of racial violence in the South.
On February 9, 1920, Morrow dispatched the <a href="Kentucky%20National%20Guard">Kentucky National Guard</a> to Lexington to protect Will Lockett, a black World War I veteran on trial for murder. Morrow told the state <a href="adjutant%20general">adjutant general</a> "Do as much as you have to do to keep that negro in the hands of the law. If he falls into the hands of the mob I do not expect to see you alive." Lockett had already confessed, without the benefit of a lawyer, to the murder. His trial took only thirty minutes as he pleaded guilty but asked for a life sentence instead of death. Despite his plea, he was sentenced to die in the electric chair.

A crowd of several thousand gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked a large group of those gathered to shake their fists and yell so he could get a picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. <a href="Martial%20law">Martial law</a> was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the <a href="Kentucky%20State%20Penitentiary">Kentucky State Penitentiary</a> in <a href="Eddyville%2C%20Kentucky">Eddyville</a>.

The incident is believed to be the first forceful suppression of a lynch mob by state and local officials in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a>. Morrow received a laudatory telegram from the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">NAACP</a>, and most of the national press regarding the incident was favorable. <a href="W.%20E.%20B.%20Du%20Bois">W. E. B. Du Bois</a> called it the "Second <a href="Battles%20of%20Lexington%20and%20Concord">Battle of Lexington</a>". Morrow was consistent in his use of state troops to end violence in the state. In 1922, he again dispatched the National Guard to quell a violent mill strike in <a href="Newport%2C%20Kentucky">Newport</a>.

Morrow also demanded consistency from local law enforcement officials. In 1921, he removed the <a href="Woodford%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Woodford County</a> jailer from office because he allowed a black inmate to be lynched and offered a reward of $25,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators. Citizens of <a href="Versailles%2C%20Kentucky">Versailles</a> were more outraged that the jailer had been removed from office than that the prisoner had been lynched. The locals refused to aid in the investigation, and the lynchers were never arrested or charged. Local officials appointed the jailer's wife to finish his term in an attempt to skirt the removal.

In August 1922, a traveling salesman named Jack Eaton was arrested for allegedly <a href="assault">assault</a>ing several young girls. The girls' parents refused to press charges, and Eaton was released. Later, he was captured by a mob, who cut him several times and poured turpentine into his wounds. An investigation found that the <a href="Scott%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Scott County</a> <a href="Sheriffs%20in%20the%20United%20States">sheriff</a> had willfully delivered Eaton to the mob, and Morrow removed him from office. Though Eaton was a white man, blacks were elated with the removal because they hoped it would encourage other jailers to step up efforts to protect against lynchings and mob violence.

Morrow was frequently mentioned as a potential candidate for <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice president</a> in 1920, but he withdrew his name from consideration, sticking to a campaign promise not to seek a higher office while governor. On July 27, 1920, he made a speech in <a href="Northampton%2C%20Massachusetts">Northampton</a>, Massachusetts, officially notifying <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> of his nomination for that office. Although he supported <a href="Frank%20O.%20Lowden">Frank O. Lowden</a> for president, the nomination went to <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a>, and Morrow campaigned vigorously on behalf of his party's ticket.

In his address to the 1922 legislature, Morrow asked for for improvements to the state highway system and for the repeal of all laws denying equal rights to women. He also recommended a large <a href="Government%20bond">bond</a> issue to finance improvements to the state's universities, schools, prisons, and hospitals. By this time, however, the Republicans had surrendered their majority in the state House, and practically all of Morrow's proposals were voted down. Morrow countered by vetoing several Democratic bills, including $700,000 in appropriations. Among the few accomplishments of the 1922 legislature were passage of an anti-lynching law, the abolition of <a href="Penal%20labour">convict labor</a> and the establishment of normal schools at <a href="Murray%2C%20Kentucky">Murray</a> and <a href="Morehead%2C%20Kentucky">Morehead</a>. Today, these schools are <a href="Murray%20State%20University">Murray State University</a> and <a href="Morehead%20State%20University">Morehead State University</a>, respectively. The 1922 legislature also established a commission to govern <a href="My%20Old%20Kentucky%20Home%20State%20Park">My Old Kentucky Home State Park</a> and approved construction of the <a href="Jefferson%20Davis%20State%20Historic%20Site">Jefferson Davis Monument</a>.

Despite the fact that Morrow gained national praise for his handling of the Lockett trial, historian <a href="James%20C.%20Klotter">James C. Klotter</a> opined that he "left behind a solid, and rather typical, record for a Kentucky governor." He cited Morrow's fiscal conservatism and inability to control the legislature in 1922 as reasons for his lackluster assessment, although he praised Morrow's advancement of racial equality in the state. Morrow was prohibited by the state constitution from seeking a second consecutive term, and the achievements of his administration were not significant enough to ensure the election of <a href="Charles%20I.%20Dawson">Charles I. Dawson</a>, his would-be Republican successor in the gubernatorial election of 1923.

Following his term as governor, Morrow retired to Somerset where he became active in the <a href="Watchmen%20of%20the%20Republic">Watchmen of the Republic</a>, an organization devoted to the eradication of prejudice and the promotion of tolerance. He served on the United States Railroad Labor Board from 1923 to 1926 and its successor, the Railway Mediation Board, from 1926 to 1934. He resigned to run for a seat in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> representing the <a href="Kentucky%27s%209th%20congressional%20district">Ninth District</a>, but lost his party's nomination to <a href="John%20M.%20Robsion">John M. Robsion</a>.

Following his defeat in the congressional primary, Morrow made plans to return to Lexington to resume his law practice. On June 15, 1935, he died unexpectedly of a heart attack while temporarily living with a cousin in <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a>. He is buried in <a href="Frankfort%20Cemetery">Frankfort Cemetery</a>.

Wipeout 3

Wipeout 3 is a futuristic <a href="racing%20game">racing video game</a> developed by <a href="Psygnosis">Psygnosis</a> and published by <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a> exclusively for the <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a>. The title is the fourth game in the <a href="Wipeout%20%28video%20game%20series%29">"Wipeout" series</a>, and was released in Europe and North America in September 1999. Players control extremely fast <a href="anti-gravity">anti-gravity</a> ships and use weapons to force other contenders out of the race.

Psygnosis hired design studio <a href="The%20Designers%20Republic">The Designers Republic</a> to create a simple colour scheme and design for in-game menus and race courses, to create what a Psygnosis staff member called "a believable future". The game is one of the few PlayStation titles to run in high-resolution mode, offering crisper graphics and visuals. "Wipeout 3"s soundtrack is composed of <a href="electronica">electronica</a> tracks selected by <a href="Sasha%20%28DJ%29">DJ Sasha</a> and features contributions by <a href="Orbital%20%28band%29">Orbital</a> and <a href="The%20Chemical%20Brothers">The Chemical Brothers</a>. The game was re-released in Europe as "Wipeout 3: Special Edition" in August 2000, which contained additional tracks and content.

The game was positively received on release; critics lauded the graphics, music, and minimalist design elements. The high level of difficulty, perceived lack of new content and courses, and paucity of new game features were seen as the game's primary faults. Despite generally good press, the game was a financial disappointment. "Wipeout 3" was the last title in the series to appear on the PlayStation and the next entry, "<a href="Wipeout%20Fusion">Wipeout Fusion</a>", was released exclusively for the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> platform in 2002.

"Wipeout 3" is a racing game that retains the same basic elements of its predecessors, and introduces players to the F7200 Anti-Gravity Race League. Set in 2116, Players control futuristic <a href="anti-gravity">anti-gravity</a> ships owned by racing corporations and pilot them on eight circuits (plus four hidden prototype tracks). Each craft is equipped with an energy shield that absorbs damage sustained on the track; if the shield is disabled, the player's craft can be knocked out of the race. Shields are regenerated in a pit lane that is set apart from the main course. The less time spent in the pit lane, the less the shield will regenerate.

In addition to shields, each racing craft contains <a href="air%20brake%20%28road%20vehicle%29">airbrake</a>s for navigating tight corners, as well as "Hyperthrust" option. Players can activate Hyperthrust to increase their speed, but Using Hyperthrust drains energy from the shields, making the craft more vulnerable.

Scattered across each raceway are weapon grids that bestow random <a href="power-up">power-up</a>s or items. "Wipeout 3" adds new weapons in addition to the five retained from previous games. Several weapons are defensive; for example, the gravity shield protects the craft from attacks and collisions for a time period. Offensive weapons are also available; craft can use rockets, Multi-Missiles and mines to disable competitors. Players can use an autopilot to safely coast through difficult turns.

The single race mode awards medals to the top three finishing hovercraft. Each contestant must reach checkpoints on the course within a remaining time, or be ejected from the race. Winning consecutive gold medals unlocks New Tracks and Crafts. "Wipeout 3" features several other game modes, including challenges to complete courses in a set time. In the "Eliminator" mode, players gain points for destroying competitors and finishing laps. The "Tournament" mode has players compete on several tracks, with points being awarded on race placement. Players can engage in two-player racing via a <a href="split%20screen%20%28computer%20graphics%29">split-screen</a> option.

In developing the next entry in the "Wipeout" series, developer Psygnosis retained many of the developers of the original game to preserve the distinctive racing experience of earlier games. At the same time, Psygnosis sought to make the game more accessible to new players of the fast-paced racer, and kept early courses easier for these players; the difficulty was adjusted for later courses so that experts still experienced a challenge. "Wipeout 3" was the first "Wipeout" game to take advantage of PlayStation controllers with <a href="analogue%20stick">analogue stick</a>s, used to offer smoother control of the player's craft.

Psygnosis turned to the <a href="graphic%20design">graphic design</a> studio <a href="The%20Designers%20Republic">The Designers Republic</a> to assist in development. The Designers Republic, known for its underground techno album covers, provided "visual candy" to "Wipeout 3"s graphics, designing the game's icons, billboards, colour schemes, and custom typefaces. The look and feel of the futuristic courses was bounded by a desire to retain a believable sensibility; "Wipeout 3" lead artist Nicky Westcott said that "[Psygnosis] tried to make it look like a believable future, instead of making the sky toxic orange with 10 moons flying around and the world gone mad. It's very low-key [and] a lot more refined."

A special edition of "Wipeout 3" was released exclusively in Europe on 14 July 2000. "Wipeout 3 Special Edition" featured many minor changes to gameplay, such as different craft physics, auto-loading of saves and AI bugfixes. In addition, eight courses from previous "Wipeout" titles (three from "<a href="Wipeout%20%28video%20game%29">Wipeout</a>" and five from "<a href="Wipeout%202097">Wipeout XL</a>") plus two hidden prototype circuits previously only available in the Japanese version of "Wipeout 3", were added giving total of 22 tracks. "Special Edition" also allowed for four-person multiplayer, using two televisions and two PlayStation consoles. "Wipeout 3" was the last game in the series made for the PlayStation. The next entry in the "Wipeout" series, entitled "<a href="Wipeout%20Fusion">Wipeout Fusion</a>", was released in 2002 exclusively for the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>. The game introduced new courses, crafts, and weaponry, as well as enhanced artificial intelligence.

Continuing the tradition set by the first game, "Wipeout 3" contains electronica offerings from various artists, including <a href="The%20Chemical%20Brothers">The Chemical Brothers</a>, <a href="Orbital%20%28band%29">Orbital</a>, and the <a href="Propellerheads">Propellerheads</a>. Psygnosis' development manager, Enda Carey, focused on bringing together music early in the game's development cycle, instead of as an afterthought or last-minute addition to the game. Unlike previous soundtracks, Psygnosis selected a single music director, <a href="Sasha%20%28DJ%29">DJ Sasha</a>, who worked with artists to create a cohesive soundtrack. Sasha included several of his own tracks made specifically for the game. The game disc is a <a href="Mixed%20Mode%20CD">Mixed Mode CD</a> that allows "Wipeout 3"s soundtrack to be played in a standard compact disc player. To promote "Wipeout 3" and its game music, Psygnosis sponsored a Global Underground tour for Sasha. Game pods featuring "Wipeout 3" were placed at parties and venues, accompanied by a tie-in marketing campaign.

Overall, critical reception of "Wipeout 3" was positive; the game holds an 89/100 at <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, indicating "generally favorable reviews". <a href="IGN">IGN</a> named "Wipeout 3" the most accessible game of the series, and in 2007 the title was named the 92nd best game by the site. Despite generally positive reviews of the game, "Wipeout 3" was not a commercial success.

The fast-paced gameplay and graphics were singled out as strong features of the game. Jack Schofield of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" was surprised by the level of detail, stating that the "graphics are better than you'd expect the [PlayStation] to deliver". Both "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" and <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> reviewers praised the new game features, specifically the new weapons and ability to challenge friends via splitscreen. The Designer Republic's style was consistently praised as helping to make the racing locales seem real, though David Goldfarb of the magazine "International Design" stated that the "techno-meets-Nihonpop-art visuals" had been executed better in previous entries of the series. "Wipeout 3"s soundtrack and sound effects were also lauded.

A major fault reviewers found with "Wipeout 3" was the steep learning curve of the game. David Canter of "<a href="The%20San%20Diego%20Union-Tribune">The San Diego Union-Tribune</a>" described the difficulty progression as "ludicrous", with the tournament game mode going from "easy as pie to tough as nails". Though the use of the analogue stick was positively noted as helping to increase control over the onscreen craft, "GamePro" found that proper handling required large amounts of patience and practice.

Reviewers who gave "Wipeout 3" lower marks noted a sense of disappointment that the series broke little new ground. Stuart Miles of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" admitted "Wipeout 3" was a good game, but felt that he had been expecting much more from the sequel: "It's as if the programmers have concerned themselves more with the overall look and feel, rather than further developing the existing gameplay." Alistair Wallace of <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a>, in a retrospective on "<a href="Wipeout%202097">Wipeout 2097</a>", remembered that "I enjoyed ["Wipeout 3"] because it was more of the same and I loved it, but I think the series ran out of its innovation. Doing loop the loops isn't a big deal really." <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> summed up its review of the game by judging "Wipeout 3" an excellent racer, but not able to beat "Wipeout 2097" as the best futuristic racing game of all time.

Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Dinner

On April 29, 2006, American comedian <a href="Stephen%20Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> appeared as the featured entertainer at the 2006 <a href="White%20House%20Correspondents%27%20Association%20Dinner">White House Correspondents' Association Dinner</a>, which was held in Washington, D.C., at the <a href="Hilton%20Washington">Hilton Washington</a> hotel. Colbert's performance, consisting of a 16-minute podium speech and a 7-minute video presentation, was broadcast live across the United States on the cable television networks <a href="C-SPAN">C-SPAN</a> and <a href="MSNBC">MSNBC</a>. Standing a few feet from U.S. President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>, in front of an audience of celebrities, politicians, and members of the <a href="White%20House%20Press%20Corps">White House Press Corps</a>, Colbert delivered a controversial, searing routine targeting the president and the media. He spoke in the persona of <a href="Stephen%20Colbert%20%28character%29">the character</a> he played on <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a>'s "<a href="The%20Colbert%20Report">The Colbert Report</a>", a parody of conservative <a href="Pundit%20%28politics%29">pundits</a> such as <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28commentator%29">Bill O'Reilly</a> and <a href="Sean%20Hannity">Sean Hannity</a>.

Colbert's performance quickly became an Internet and media sensation. Commentators remarked on the humor of Colbert's performance, the political nature of his remarks, and speculated as to whether there was a cover-up by the media in the way the event was reported. <a href="James%20Poniewozik">James Poniewozik</a> of <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time"</a> noted that whether or not one liked the speech, it had become a "political-cultural touchstone issue of 2006—like whether you drive a <a href="hybrid%20vehicle">hybrid</a> or use the term '<a href="freedom%20fries">freedom fries</a>.

American comedian <a href="Stephen%20Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> was the featured entertainer at the <a href="White%20House%20Correspondents%27%20Association">White House Correspondents' Association</a> Dinner, held at the <a href="Hilton%20Washington">Hilton Washington</a> hotel in Washington, D.C. on April 29, 2006. He was invited to speak by Mark Smith, the outgoing president of the White House Press Corps Association. Smith later told reporters that he had not seen much of Colbert's work. Since 1983, the event has featured well-known stand-up comics. Previous performances included President <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a> and <a href="Chevy%20Chase">Chevy Chase</a> making fun of Ford's alleged clumsiness in 1975, and <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> and <a href="Rich%20Little">Rich Little</a> performing together in 1981.

Colbert gave his after-dinner remarks in front of an audience described by the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> as a "Who's Who of power and celebrity". More than 2,500 guests attended the event, including First Lady <a href="Laura%20Bush">Laura Bush</a>, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff <a href="Peter%20Pace">Peter Pace</a>, U.S. Attorney General <a href="Alberto%20Gonzales">Alberto Gonzales</a>, China's Ambassador <a href="Zhou%20Wenzhong%20%28diplomat%29">Zhou Wenzhong</a>, <a href="AOL">AOL</a> co-founder <a href="Steve%20Case">Steve Case</a>, model and tennis player <a href="Anna%20Kournikova">Anna Kournikova</a>, and actor <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a>. Colbert spoke directly to President Bush several times, satirically praising his foreign policy, lifestyle, and beliefs, and referring to his declining approval rating and popular reputation.

Colbert spoke in the persona of <a href="Stephen%20Colbert%20%28character%29">the character</a> he played on <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a>'s "<a href="The%20Colbert%20Report">The Colbert Report</a>", a parody of a conservative pundit in the fashion of <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28commentator%29">Bill O'Reilly</a> and <a href="Sean%20Hannity">Sean Hannity</a>. He began by satirizing mass surveillance, joking "If anybody needs anything else at their tables, just speak slowly and clearly into your table numbers. Someone from the NSA will be right over with a cocktail." While many of his jokes were directed at President Bush, he also lampooned the journalists and other figures present at the dinner. Most of the speech was prepared specifically for the event, but several segments were lifted—largely unchanged—from "The Colbert Report", including parts of the "<a href="truthiness">truthiness</a>" monologue from the first episode of the show, where Colbert advocated speaking from "the gut" rather than the brain and denounced books as "all fact, no heart". Colbert framed this part of the speech as though he were agreeing with Bush's philosophies, saying that he and Bush are "not brainiacs on the nerd patrol", implicitly criticizing the way Bush positioned himself as an <a href="anti-intellectualism">anti-intellectual</a>.

Following this introduction to his style and philosophy, Colbert listed a series of absurd "beliefs that I live by", such as "I believe in America. I believe it exists." He alluded to outsourcing to China and satirized the traditional <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> opposition to "<a href="big%20government">big government</a>" by referencing the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a>. "I believe the government that governs best is the government that governs least. And by these standards, we have set up a fabulous government in Iraq."

Colbert then mocked Bush's sinking approval ratings:

He continued his mock defense of Bush by satirizing Bush's appearances aboard the <a href="USS%20Abraham%20Lincoln%20%28CVN-72%29">USS "Abraham Lincoln"</a>, at the site of the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">collapsed World Trade Center</a>, and in cities devastated by <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>:

Colbert ended the monologue specifically directed at Bush by parodying his energy policy. He then used Laura Bush's reading initiative as a springboard to mock-criticize books for being "<a href="elitist">elitist</a>", and harshly criticized the <a href="White%20House%20Press%20Corps">White House Press Corps</a>—hosts of the event—and the media in general. Addressing the audience, he remarked:
Colbert also criticized the White House Press Corps for what was widely perceived as its reluctance to question the administration's policies, particularly in regards to the lead up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, saying:
For the remainder of his speech, Colbert joked about other people in the audience, including Peter Pace, <a href="Antonin%20Scalia">Antonin Scalia</a>, <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a>, and <a href="Joseph%20C.%20Wilson">Joe Wilson</a>. During this section, he made another reference to global warming while talking about interviewing <a href="Jesse%20Jackson">Jesse Jackson</a>: "You can ask him anything, but he's going to say what he wants, at the pace that he wants. It's like boxing a glacier. Enjoy that metaphor, by the way, because your grandchildren will have no idea what a glacier is."

Colbert received a chilly reception from the audience. His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, although some in the audience, such as Scalia, laughed heartily as Colbert teased them. This was in stark contrast to the warm reception accorded to a skit featuring Bush and his look-alike, <a href="Steve%20Bridges">Steve Bridges</a>, which immediately preceded Colbert's monologue.

At the end of his monologue, Colbert introduced what he characterized as an "audition" video to become the new White House Press Secretary—<a href="Scott%20McClellan">Scott McClellan</a> had recently left the position. The video spliced clips of difficult questions from the White House press corps with responses from Colbert as Press Secretary. Colbert's podium included controls marked "eject", "Gannon" (a reference to erstwhile White House reporter <a href="Jeff%20Gannon">Jeff Gannon</a>, who was suspected of asking planted questions), and "volume", which he used to silence a critical question from journalist <a href="David%20Gregory%20%28journalist%29">David Gregory</a>. The video continued with Colbert fleeing the briefing room and the White House, only to be pursued by White House correspondent <a href="Helen%20Thomas">Helen Thomas</a>, who had been a vocal critic of the Bush administration. At one point, Colbert picks up an emergency phone and explains that Thomas "won't stop asking why we invaded Iraq". The dispatcher responds with, "Hey, why "did" we invade Iraq?" The entire second half of the video is a spoof of horror film clichés, particularly the film "<a href="Westworld%20%28film%29">Westworld</a>", with melodramatic music accompanying Thomas's slow, unwavering pursuit of Colbert, and Colbert loudly screaming "No!" at intervals. Widely available online, a portion of the mock audition tape aired on "The Colbert Report" on May 2, 2006.

Although President Bush shook Colbert's hand after his presentation, several of Bush's aides and supporters walked out during Colbert's speech, and one former aide commented that the President had "that look that he's ready to blow". Colbert recalled that "not a lot of people laughed in the front row" during the speech, and that "when it was over, no one was even making eye contact with me ... no one is talking to me in the whole damn room"; only Scalia came to him afterward, praising Colbert's imitation of a gesture the justice had recently been photographed making. He also noted actor <a href="Harry%20Lennix">Harry Lennix</a> gave him props afterwards.

Cable channel C-SPAN broadcast the White House Correspondents' Dinner live, and rebroadcast the event several times in the next 24 hours, but aired a segment that excluded Colbert's speech. The trade journal "<a href="Editor%20%26amp%3B%20Publisher">Editor & Publisher</a>" was the first news outlet to report in detail on Colbert's performance, calling it a "blistering comedy 'tribute that did not make the Bushes laugh. The reviewer noted that others on the podium were uncomfortable during the speech, "perhaps feeling the material was a little too biting—or too much speaking '<a href="truthiness">truthiness</a>' to power".

"<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" covered the dinner, but not Colbert's remarks. The wire services <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a> and the Associated Press each devoted three paragraphs to discuss Colbert's routine in their coverage of the event, and "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" mentioned Colbert several times throughout its article. The most extensive print coverage came from "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>", which dedicated more space to Colbert's performance than to President Bush's skit. The day after the dinner, <a href="Howard%20Kurtz">Howard Kurtz</a> played clips of Colbert's performance on his CNN show "<a href="Reliable%20Sources">Reliable Sources</a>." On the Fox News show "<a href="Fox%20%26amp%3B%20Friends">Fox & Friends</a>", the hosts mentioned Colbert's performance, criticizing him for going "over the line". <a href="Tucker%20Carlson">Tucker Carlson</a>, a frequent target of "The Colbert Report" before and after the event, criticized Colbert as being "unfunny" on his MSNBC show "<a href="Tucker%20%28television%20program%29">Tucker</a>".

Much of the initial coverage of the event highlighted the difference between the reaction to Bush and Bridges (very positive) and that for Colbert (far more muted). "The president killed. He's a tough act to follow—at all times," said Colbert. On his show, Colbert joked that the unenthusiastic reception was actually "very respectful silence" and added that the crowd "practically carried me out on their shoulders" even though he was not ready to leave. On the May 1, 2006, episode of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Show">The Daily Show</a>", on which Colbert had formerly been a correspondent, host <a href="Jon%20Stewart">Jon Stewart</a> called Colbert's performance "balls-alicious" and stated, "We've never been prouder of our Mr. Colbert, and, ah—holy shit!"

<a href="Lloyd%20Grove">Lloyd Grove</a>, gossip columnist for the "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>", said that Colbert "bombed badly", and <a href="Black%20Entertainment%20Television">BET</a> founder <a href="Robert%20L.%20Johnson">Bob Johnson</a> remarked, "It was an insider crowd, as insider a crowd as you'll ever have, and [Colbert] didn't do the insider jokes". "<a href="Congressional%20Quarterly">Congressional Quarterly</a>" columnist and <a href="CBS">CBS</a> commentator <a href="Craig%20Crawford">Craig Crawford</a> found Colbert's performance hilarious, but observed that most other people at the dinner did not find the speech amusing. "Time magazine" TV critic James Poniewozik thought that Colbert's critics missed the point: "Colbert wasn't playing to the room, I suspect, but to the wide audience of people who would later watch on the Internet. If anything, he was playing against the room." Poniewozik called the pained, uncomfortable reactions to Colbert's jokes "the money shots. They were the whole point."

Some commentators, while noting the popularity of Colbert's dinner speech, were critical of the perceived snubbing he was receiving from the press corps, even though he was the featured entertainer for the evening. "The Washington Post" columnist <a href="Dan%20Froomkin">Dan Froomkin</a>, calling it "The Colbert Blackout", lambasted the traditional media for ignoring Colbert while focusing on the "much safer" topic of President Bush's routine with Bridges. <a href="Amy%20Goodman">Amy Goodman</a> of "<a href="Democracy%20Now">Democracy Now</a>" noted that initial coverage ignored Colbert entirely. <a href="Columbia%20University%20Graduate%20School%20of%20Journalism">Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism</a> professor <a href="Todd%20Gitlin">Todd Gitlin</a> remarked, "It's too hot to handle. [Colbert] was scathing toward Bush and it was absolutely devastating. [The mainstream media doesn't] know how to handle such a pointed and aggressive criticism."

Others saw no intentional snub of Colbert by the press. Responding to a question about why "The Washington Post"s article about the dinner did not go into any detail about Colbert's speech, Media Backtalk writer Howard Kurtz responded, "The problem in part is one of deadline. The presses were already rolling by the time Colbert came on at 10:30, so the story had to be largely written by then." Asked why television news favored Bush's performance over Colbert's, Elizabeth Fishman, an assistant dean at the Columbia School of Journalism and a former "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>" producer, told MTV that the "quick hit" for television news shows would have been to use footage of Bush standing beside his impersonator. "It's an easier set up for visual effect", she noted. Steve Scully, president of the White House Correspondents' Association (which hosted the dinner) and political editor of C-SPAN (which broadcast the dinner), scoffed at the whole idea of the press intentionally ignoring Colbert: "Bush hit such a home run with Steve Bridges that he got all of the coverage. I think that exceeded expectations. There was no right-wing conspiracy or left-wing conspiracy." "Time" columnist <a href="Ana%20Marie%20Cox">Ana Marie Cox</a> dismissed allegations of a deliberate <a href="media%20blackout">media blackout</a>, because Colbert's performance received coverage in "The New York Times", "The Washington Post", and the major wire services. Fellow commentator Kurtz concurred, noting that the video was carried on C-SPAN and was freely available online; he also played two clips on his own show. "Apparently I didn't get the memo," he said.

In an article published on May 3, 2006, "The New York Times" addressed the controversy. The paper acknowledged that the mainstream media—itself included—had been criticized for focusing on Bush's act with Bridges while ignoring Colbert's speech. The paper then quoted several passages of Colbert's more substantial criticism of the president and discussed various reactions to the event. On May 15, "The New York Times" public editor, <a href="Byron%20Calame">Byron Calame</a>, wrote on his blog that more than two hundred readers had written to complain about the exclusion of any mention of Colbert from the paper's initial lengthy article covering the dinner. Calame quoted his deputy bureau chief in Washington, who said that a mention of Colbert in the first article could not have been long enough to do his routine justice. But he also noted that the paper should have printed an in-depth article specifically covering Colbert's speech in the same issue, rather than waiting until days after the fact.

Even though Colbert's performance "landed with a thud" among the live audience, clips of Colbert at the dinner were an overnight sensation, becoming <a href="viral%20video">viral video</a>s that appeared on numerous web sites in several forms. Sites offering the video experienced massive increases in traffic. According to <a href="CNET">CNET</a>'s News.com site, Colbert's speech was "one of the Internet's hottest acts". Searches for Colbert on <a href="Yahoo%21">Yahoo!</a> were up 5,625 percent. During the days after the speech, there were twice as many <a href="Google">Google</a> searches for "C-SPAN" as for "<a href="Jennifer%20Aniston">Jennifer Aniston</a>"—an uncommon occurrence—as well as a surge in Colbert-related searches. <a href="Nielsen%20Media%20Research">Nielsen BuzzMetrics</a> ranked the post of the video clip as the second most popular blog post for all of 2006. Clips of Colbert's comic tribute climbed to the number 1, 2, and 3 spots atop <a href="List%20of%20most%20viewed%20YouTube%20videos">YouTube's "Most Viewed"</a> video list. The various clips of Colbert's speech had been viewed 2.7 million times in less than 48 hours. In an unprecedented move for the network, <a href="C-SPAN">C-SPAN</a> demanded that <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> and <a href="iFilm">iFilm</a> remove unauthorized copies of the video from their sites. <a href="Google%20Video">Google Video</a> subsequently purchased the exclusive rights to retransmit the video, and it remained at or near the top of Google's most popular videos for the next two weeks.

Both "<a href="Editor%20and%20Publisher">Editor and Publisher</a>" and "<a href="Salon.com">Salon</a>", which published extensive and early coverage of the Colbert speech, drew record and near-record numbers of viewers to their web sites. 70,000 articles were posted to blogs about Colbert's <a href="Roast%20%28comedy%29">roast</a> of Bush on the Thursday after the event, the most of any topic, and "Colbert" remained the top search term at <a href="Technorati">Technorati</a> for days. "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" TV critic Doug Elfman credited the Internet with promoting an event that would have otherwise been overlooked, stating that "Internet stables for liberals, like the behemoth <a href="Daily%20Kos">dailykos.com</a>, began rumbling as soon as the correspondents' dinner was reported in the mainstream press, with scant word of Colbert's combustive address". Three weeks after the dinner, audio of Colbert's performance went on sale at the <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Music Store</a> and became the No. 1 album purchased, outselling new releases by the <a href="Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>, <a href="Pearl%20Jam">Pearl Jam</a>, and <a href="Paul%20Simon">Paul Simon</a>. The CEO of <a href="Audible.com">Audible.com</a>, which provided the recording sold at iTunes, explained its success by saying, "you had to not be there to get it". It continued to be a top download at iTunes for the next five months.

Colbert's performance received a variety of reactions from the media. In Washington, the response from both politicians and the press corps was negative—both groups having been targets of Colbert's satire. The Washington press corps felt that Colbert had bombed. "The Washington Post" columnist <a href="Richard%20Cohen%20%28Washington%20Post%20columnist%29">Richard Cohen</a> found that Colbert's jokes were "lame and insulting" and wrote that Colbert was "rude" and a "bully". Politician <a href="Steny%20Hoyer">Steny Hoyer</a> felt that Colbert had gone too far, telling the newspaper "<a href="The%20Hill%20%28newspaper%29">The Hill</a>" that "[Bush] is the President of the United States, and he deserves some respect". Conservative pundit <a href="Mary%20Matalin">Mary Matalin</a> called Colbert's performance a "predictable, Bush-bashing kind of humor". Columnist Ana Marie Cox chastised those who praised Colbert as a hero: "I somehow doubt that Bush has never heard these criticisms before". She added, "Comedy can have a political point but it is not political action".

On "The Daily Show", Jon Stewart remarked, tongue in cheek, "apparently [Colbert] was under the impression that they'd hired him to do what he does every night on television". While comics were expected to tell jokes about the administration, the 2006 dinner was held at a time when the relationship between the administration and the media was under great strain, and the administration was sensitive to criticism. Attorney and columnist <a href="Julie%20Hilden">Julie Hilden</a> concluded that Colbert's "vituperative parody" might have been unfair under different circumstances, but noted that Bush's record of controlling bad press created a heightened justification for people to criticize him when they got the chance. Media Matters and "Editor & Publisher" came to Colbert's defense, calling his detractors hypocrites. They contrasted the critical reaction to Colbert to the praise that many in the press had for a controversial routine that Bush performed at a similar media dinner in 2004, where Bush was shown looking for WMDs in the <a href="Oval%20Office">Oval Office</a> and joking, "Those weapons of mass destruction must be somewhere!" and "Nope, no weapons over there!"

<a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> News Online columnist <a href="Heather%20Mallick">Heather Mallick</a> wrote, "Colbert had the wit and raw courage to do to Bush what <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a> did to <a href="Marcus%20Junius%20Brutus">Brutus</a>, murderer of <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Caesar</a>. As the American media has self-destructed, it takes Colbert to damn Bush with devastatingly ironic praise." Comedian and eventual <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> U.S. Senator <a href="Al%20Franken">Al Franken</a>, who performed at similar dinners twice during the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton administration</a>, admired what Colbert had done. In its year-end issue, "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" magazine described Colbert's performance as one of the most "brilliant" moments of 2006. <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time"</a>'s <a href="James%20Poniewozik">James Poniewozik</a> noted that in the "days after Stephen Colbert performed at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, this has become the political-cultural touchstone issue of 2006—like whether you drive a hybrid or use the term 'freedom fries.

For the 2007 dinner, the White House Correspondents' Association brought back the less controversial Rich Little. <a href="Arianna%20Huffington">Arianna Huffington</a> reported that Colbert told her he had specifically avoided reading any reviews of his performance, and remained unaware of the public's reaction. On June 13, 2007, he was presented with a <a href="Spike%20%28TV%20channel%29">Spike TV</a> Guys' Choice Award for "Gutsiest Move". He accepted the award via video conference. Six months later, "New York Times" columnist <a href="Frank%20Rich">Frank Rich</a> called Colbert's after-dinner speech a "cultural primary", christening it the "defining moment" of the United States' <a href="United%20States%20general%20elections%2C%202006">2006 midterm elections</a>. Three and a half years after the speech, Frank Rich referenced it again, calling it "brilliant" and "good for the country", while columnist <a href="Dan%20Savage">Dan Savage</a> referred to it as "one of the things that kept people like me sane during the darkest days of the Bush years". The editor of "<a href="The%20Realist">The Realist</a>", <a href="Paul%20Krassner">Paul Krassner</a>, later put Colbert's performance in historical context, saying that it stands out among contemporary US satire as the only example of the spirit of the satire of <a href="Lenny%20Bruce">Lenny Bruce</a>, <a href="George%20Carlin">George Carlin</a>, and <a href="Richard%20Pryor">Richard Pryor</a>, which took risks and broke barriers to free speech, "rather than just proudly exercising it as comedians do now."

Pallid sturgeon

The pallid sturgeon ("Scaphirhynchus albus") is an <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> of <a href="Actinopterygii">ray-finned fish</a>, <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> to the waters of the <a href="Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> and lower <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi river</a> basins of the United States.

Named for its pale coloration, it is closely related to the relatively common <a href="shovelnose%20sturgeon">shovelnose sturgeon</a> ("Scaphirhynchus platorynchus"), but is much larger, averaging between in length and in weight at maturity. This species takes 15 years to mature and spawns infrequently, but can live up to a century. A member of the sturgeon family, <a href="Sturgeon">Acipenseridae</a>, which originated during the <a href="Cretaceous%20period">Cretaceous period</a> 70 million years ago, the pallid sturgeon has changed little since then.

In 1990, the <a href="U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> placed the pallid sturgeon on its endangered species list because few young individuals had been observed in the preceding decade and sightings had greatly diminished; the species is now rarely seen in the wild. It was the first fish species in the Missouri River drainage area to be listed as endangered, and a loss of its habitat is thought to be responsible for its decline. The vast majority of the Missouri River drainage system has been <a href="River%20engineering">channeled and dammed</a>, reducing the gravel deposits and slow-moving side channels that are its favored <a href="Spawn%20%28biology%29">spawning</a> areas. Until the middle of the 20th century, pallid sturgeon were common and anglers found catching such a large fish in <a href="fresh%20water">fresh water</a> a rewarding experience. The species is considered to be good-tasting, and its eggs have been used as <a href="caviar">caviar</a>, although less commonly than those of many other sturgeon.

Efforts to prevent the species from becoming extinct have had modest success. Pallid sturgeon are actively being raised in a dozen <a href="Fish%20hatchery">hatcheries</a> and the offspring are being released back to the wild every year. To better understand pallid sturgeon behavior, researchers have implanted radio transmitters to track their movements and help identify possible spawning areas. Federal and state agencies are working together to improve habitat by restoring spawning areas since restoration of these areas is required if the species is to survive in the wild.

Taxonomists <a href="Stephen%20Alfred%20Forbes">S. A. Forbes</a> and R. E. Richardson classified the pallid sturgeon in 1905, grouping it in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Parascaphirhynchus" and the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Acipenseridae">Acipenseridae</a>, which includes all <a href="sturgeon">sturgeon</a> worldwide. Its closest relatives are the shovelnose sturgeon ("Scaphirhynchus platorynchus"), which is still relatively common, and the critically endangered <a href="Alabama%20sturgeon">Alabama sturgeon</a> ("Scaphirhynchus suttkusi"), which may soon become <a href="Extinction">extinct</a>. These three species belong to the subfamily <a href="Scaphirhynchinae">Scaphirhynchinae</a>, which has only one other genus, "<a href="Pseudoscaphirhynchus">Pseudoscaphirhynchus</a>", represented by three species found in west-central <a href="Asia">Asia</a>.

The word pallid means "deficient in color", and compared to other species of sturgeon, the pallid is noticeably paler. The scientific name for the fish is derived from "Scaphirhynchus", a <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> word meaning "spade snout" and "albus" which is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "white".

To better protect the pallid sturgeon from extinction, research on its <a href="DNA">DNA</a> and that of other closely related species was conducted to assess the differences within various populations of pallid sturgeon, and the differences between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. Early DNA research indicated that pallid sturgeon and shovelnose sturgeon were a single species. However, a 2000 study comparing DNA sequences in the three members of the genus "Scaphirhynchus"(pallid, shovelnose, and Alabama sturgeon) showed that the three are distinct species. Between 2001 and 2006, several studies examined two populations of pallid sturgeon located in the upper <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a> section of the Missouri River and compared them to a southern population located in the <a href="Atchafalaya%20River">Atchafalaya River</a> in <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>. These DNA studies concluded that the northern populations of pallid sturgeon are <a href="Reproductive%20isolation">reproductively isolated</a> and are genetically distinct from the Atchafalaya population. However, the genetic variability among pallid sturgeon was found to be far less than that between them and the shovelnose sturgeon.

Another reason for DNA testing was to determine the rates of <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridization</a> between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. The southern populations have more hybrids than are found in the middle sections of the Missouri River basin, while the northernmost populations have had few reports of hybrids. Hybrids are most common in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, and DNA sequencing in these hybrids showed a genetic distinction from pallid sturgeon, but based on the genetic markers assessed, they were genetically indistinguishable from shovelnose sturgeon. Because of this ability of two species to hybridize, some biologists have expressed concern that it is a violation of the <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a> to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another. It is not known if the hybrids are able to reproduce or not, although they appear to be the result of pallid sturgeon <a href="egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a> being fertilized by shovelnose sturgeon males.

The pallid sturgeon is one of the largest freshwater fish species in North America. They are generally between in length and weigh as much as . The species is ancient and has remained virtually unchanged for 70 million years, since the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> period. The pallid sturgeon has a distinctive appearance that has been referred to as "primitive", "dinosaur-like" and even "ugly". Although visually similar, the shovelnose sturgeon is much smaller and usually weighs no more than . Pallid sturgeon are much paler in coloration with grayish white backs and sides, while shovelnose sturgeon are brown. Pallid sturgeon turn whiter as they age and younger specimens are easily confused with adult shovelnose sturgeon since they are similar in color. Like the shovelnose sturgeon, their tails are <a href="heterocercal">heterocercal</a>, with the top tail fin being longer than the bottom fin, though this is more pronounced in pallid sturgeon.

As with other sturgeon, pallid sturgeon lack the <a href="Scale%20%28zoology%29">scales</a> or bones found in more "modern" species of fish. Instead, they have <a href="cartilage">cartilaginous</a> skeletons with five rows of thick cartilage plates that extend along their sides, undersides, and backs, as well as over most of the head. These thick cartilage plates are covered by the skin and serve as a protective armor. The bony cartilage also extends along the backside, from the <a href="dorsal%20fin">dorsal fin</a> to the tail.

The pallid sturgeon's snout and head are longer than that of the shovelnose sturgeon. In both species, the mouth is located well back from the tip of the snout. Lacking teeth, they use their extendable mouths to suck up small fish, <a href="mollusk">mollusk</a>s, and other food sources from river bottoms. Both species also have four <a href="Barbel%20%28anatomy%29">barbels</a> which descend from the snout near the front of the mouth. The barbels are believed to be sensory features to locate food sources. On pallid sturgeon, the two inner barbels are about half as long as the outer ones, while on the shovelnose sturgeon, all four barbels are the same length. The inner barbels of the pallid sturgeon are positioned in front of the outer ones, but those on the shovelnose sturgeon are all located in essentially a straight line. The length and positioning of the barbels is one of the best ways to distinguish the two species.

Pallid sturgeon have a long lifespan, living in excess of 50 and perhaps as long as 100 years. They lack bones and scales, which makes it more difficult to establish their age and determine exactly how long they live. As is true for many long-lived species, pallid sturgeon reach reproductive maturity relatively late. Males reach sexual maturity between the ages of 5 and 7 years, while females are believed to become capable of reproduction when they are at least 15 years old. One study of nine females indicated that they begin egg development between the ages of 9 and 12 years, but do not reach reproductive maturity until they are 15 years old. Reproduction does not take place every year; the average interval between spawnings is three years, although other studies suggest an interval as long as 10 years. Spawning usually takes place May to July.

Prior to the construction of dams on the Missouri, pallid sturgeon migrated hundreds of miles upstream to spawn, and sought out rocky or hard surfaces to deposit hundreds of thousands of eggs. One female pallid sturgeon caught in the upper Missouri River was estimated to be carrying 170,000 eggs, representing over 11 percent of its total body weight. After fertilization, pallid sturgeon eggs hatch in 5 to 8 days, after which the larvae drift back downstream for several weeks. As the larvae develop tails, they seek out slower-moving waterways and slowly mature over a period of a dozen years. The rate of survival to maturity for pallid sturgeon larvae is extremely low, and of the hundreds of thousands of eggs spawned, only a few live to adulthood.

For several decades, no natural reproduction of pallid sturgeon was observed, since all the fish that had been captured were older specimens. In the late 1990s, young pallid sturgeon were discovered living in a restored riparian area of the lower Missouri River. This was the first documented example of wild spawned pallid sturgeon in 50 years. In 2007, two female pallid sturgeon were also reported to have spawned in the <a href="Missouri%20National%20Recreational%20River">Missouri National Recreational River</a> area located downstream from <a href="Gavins%20Point%20Dam">Gavins Point Dam</a> on the Missouri River.

The pallid sturgeon's historical <a href="range%20%28biology%29">range</a> spanned the entire Missouri River and into the Mississippi River. Historically, the species was rare to nonexistent in the upper Mississippi, probably due to a lack of proper habitat. Currently, the species is considered imperiled throughout its entire range. As of 2008, pallid sturgeon can still be found throughout their original range, but their population numbers have severely declined from the mid-20th century. The Missouri and Mississippi rivers from <a href="Montana">Montana</a> to Louisiana, as well as the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, continue to harbor an aging population of pallid sturgeon. Pallid sturgeon have never been very common; as early as 1905 when the species was first identified, they represented only one in five of all sturgeon in the lower Missouri River and as few as one in 500 where the <a href="Illinois%20River">Illinois River</a> meets the Mississippi. Between 1985 and 2000, the ratio of pallid sturgeon to all sturgeon netted declined from one in about 400 to one in nearly 650. A 1996 study concluded that between 6,000 and 21,000 pallid sturgeon remained in their natural habitat at that time.

Six areas were studied for wild pallid sturgeon population estimates and recovery recommendations by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) between 1990, when the species was declared endangered, and 2006. The USFWS has referred to these six areas of wild population studies as "recovery priority management areas" (RPMAs). In the northernmost region of the study, known as RPMA 1, located between the <a href="Marias%20River">Marias River</a> in Montana and the western reaches of Fort Peck Reservoir, only 45 wild (nonhatchery) individuals remain. Of these, no juveniles were observed and the population was declining. In RPMA 2, located between Fort Peck Dam, the headwaters of <a href="Lake%20Sakakawea">Lake Sakakawea</a>, and the lower <a href="Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone River</a> up to the confluence of the <a href="Tongue%20River%20%28Montana%29">Tongue River</a>, Montana, only 136 wild specimens remain. In RPMA 3, stretching from upstream of the <a href="Niobrara%20River">Niobrara River</a> to <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Lake">Lewis and Clark Lake</a> along the Missouri River, no native populations were recorded. All collected specimens appeared to be hatchery-raised. However, these specimens were apparently maturing and adjusting well to this section of the river. Recovery priority management area 4 extends from Gavins Point Dam to the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. This region also includes the Platte River. Here, at least 100 unique nonhatchery specimens were collected during the study period. Evidence also indicates some wild reproduction is going on in this region. In RPMA 5, between the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, several hundred specimens were documented. Again, some evidence suggests natural reproduction is occurring, as demonstrated by the recovery of a few examples of immature, nonhatchery-raised individuals. The Atchafalaya River basin is designated as RPMA 6 and the findings there were similar to those in RPMAs 4 and 5, but with greater numbers of unique individuals, near 500 in total.

Pallid sturgeon prefer moderate to swift river currents and most captured specimens have been recovered in rivers and streams in which the current averages between . They also prefer <a href="Turbidity">turbid</a> waterways and water depths between . The species is more commonly found where sandy substrates are plentiful, but also lives in predominately rocky waterways. Pallid sturgeon prefer swift river currents more often than do shovelnose sturgeon.

In a study based in Montana and North Dakota conducted on both the pallid and shovelnose sturgeon, both species were fitted with radio transmitters so researchers could track their swimming habits. Pallid sturgeon were found to prefer wider river channels, midchannel sandbars, and numerous islands, and were most commonly recorded in water depths between . The study also showed that the pallid sturgeon moved as much as per day and up to . Pallid sturgeon are believed to have preferred the muddy and generally warmer waters that existed prior to Missouri River dam construction.

Pallid sturgeon are generally <a href="bottom%20feeder">bottom feeder</a>s, skimming the sandy reaches of the various rivers and streams in their habitat. Though little is known about the precise eating habits of the species, they are thought to be opportunistic feeders. One study which examined the contents from the stomachs of juvenile pallid sturgeon revealed that their diets were seasonally dependent. Various insects were consumed during some seasons and various fish species during others. These results support the description of the pallid sturgeon's eating habits as opportunistic. Fish is a more important dietary staple for pallid sturgeon than it is for shovelnose sturgeon. In one study comparing dietary tendencies between adult shovelnose sturgeon and immature pallid sturgeon, the pallid sturgeon was found to consume far greater numbers of small fish such as <a href="cyprinid">cyprinid</a>s (minnows). In another study conducted in the upper Missouri River region, an examination of the stomach contents of hatchery-reared pallid sturgeon showed that 82% of the wet weight was small fish and the balance was <a href="Chironomidae">mosquito-like insects</a>, <a href="Mayfly">mayflies</a>, and <a href="Trichoptera">caddis flies</a> and small amounts of detritus and plant material.

Though never believed to be common, pallid sturgeon populations rapidly declined during the late 20th century and the species was listed as endangered on September 6, 1990. The <a href="U.S.%20government">U.S. government</a> and most of the states with pallid sturgeon populations have commenced restoration efforts to save the species from extinction. Wild reproduction of pallid sturgeon is rare to nonexistent in most areas; therefore, human intervention is needed to ensure the survival of the species. Pallid sturgeon were previously considered a prized trophy game fish species, until their numbers declined and they were placed on the endangered species list. All captured pallid sturgeon must now be released back to the wild. The species was known for being very palatable and the <a href="roe">roe</a> from females was used as <a href="caviar">caviar</a>.

The route and the environmental characteristics of Missouri River in the northern <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a> states of North and South Dakota, Nebraska, and Montana have been significantly altered. The resultant changes to the Missouri River in the upper Great Plains from channelization and impoundment prevent upstream migration. The reduced water flow rates and sediment loads have brought an end to the seasonal flooding of the flood plains in the region. Since the construction of the <a href="Fort%20Peck%20Dam">Fort Peck Dam</a> in Montana in 1937, and subsequent damming and channelization, the Missouri River has lost over 90% of its wetland and sandbar ecosystems. More than of the Missouri River have been altered and only that stretch of the river above Fort Peck Reservoir in Montana remains relatively unchanged. These alterations of the river have had a detrimental impact on a number of native fish species. In the 13 U.S. states where the pallid sturgeon is found, only a few other fish species are listed as endangered. Although substantial efforts are being implemented to ensure the survival of this species, the rarity of self-sustaining populations of pallid sturgeon ensures that it will remain federally protected for many decades.

Two populations of pallid sturgeon in the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers of Montana are both at risk of extinction, and current projections are that wild pallid sturgeon populations in Montana will be extinct by 2018. Though a vigorous stocking effort was implemented in 1996, until pallid sturgeon females reach reproductive maturity sometime after they are 15 years of age, recovery efforts in Montana will not be readily measurable. The <a href="U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Reclamation">U.S. Bureau of Reclamation</a> has been conducting spring pulse water releases from the <a href="Tiber%20Dam">Tiber Dam</a> every four to five years to try to recreate a semblance of an annual spring flood to restore and rejuvenate downstream floodplains. These pulse releases are done in an effort to restore suitable habitat for numerous fish species.

In Nebraska, a small number of pallid sturgeon have been captured along the lower reaches of the <a href="Platte%20River">Platte River</a>. Unlike most rivers in the Mississippi-Missouri River System, the Platte River has only a few dams and they are well upstream from its confluence with the Missouri River. The lower Platte River is shallow with numerous sand bars and small islands. Though pallid sturgeon prefer more turbulent and deeper rivers than the Platte, between 1979 and 2003, over a dozen pallid sturgeon, including some from hatcheries, have been captured from the Platte River. A number of these pallid sturgeon have been fitted with <a href="Tracking%20animal%20migration">radio transmitters</a> which track their return to the Platte River when water levels and turbidity conditions are favorable. Coinciding with the majority of the pallid sturgeon that have been captured, the period that is generally most favorable is during the spring and early summer. By midsummer, a reduction in water levels and turbidity on the Platte River encourages pallid sturgeon to return to the Missouri River.

The lower reaches of the Platte River, a more than stretch from the <a href="Elkhorn%20River">Elkhorn River</a> to its confluence with the Missouri River, has suitable spawning habitat for pallid sturgeon, although no conclusive evidence has been found that spawning is occurring in this region. Along with the lower Yellowstone River, the lower Platte River was identified as one of the best of the remaining regions with the potential for the natural spawning.

In Missouri, at the Lisbon Bottoms section of the <a href="Big%20Muddy%20National%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Refuge">Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge</a>, wild pallid sturgeon larvae were collected in 1998. These nonhatchery-raised larvae were the first recovered on the lower Missouri River in the previous 50 years. The recovery was made along a side channel of the Missouri River that had been developed to provide suitable habitat for pallid sturgeon and other fish spawning. The side channel was apparently being used by the larva pallid sturgeon for protection from the swifter currents of the Missouri River.

In 2007, the USFWS concluded that hatchery-based reproduction efforts should be continued, along with monitoring of any population changes, to determine the effectiveness of human intervention. The 2007 findings also emphasized the need to determine the most likely areas of spawning, to identify any parasite or disease that may be impacting the reproductive capabilities of pallid sturgeon, and to examine engineering possibilities that may permit recreation of suitable habitats without reducing the USFWS's ability to protect people from harmful and destructive flooding, and to maintain its ability to provide adequate water impoundment for irrigation and recreation purposes.

Alabama Centennial half dollar

The Alabama Centennial half dollar, or Alabama half dollar, was a commemorative fifty-cent coin struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> in 1921 as a belated acknowledgement of the 100th anniversary of <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>'s admission to the Union in 1819. The coin was created by <a href="Laura%20Gardin%20Fraser">Laura Gardin Fraser</a>, who became the first woman designer of a coin.

Alabama Congressman <a href="Lilius%20Bratton%20Rainey">Lilius Bratton Rainey</a> introduced legislation for a commemorative coin at the request of the state's centennial commission. The bill originally provided for commemorative <a href="quarter%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">quarters</a> but was amended to provide for halves instead. The bill moved quickly through the legislative process and became the Act of May 10, 1920, with the signature of President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>.

The half dollars were not issued until October 1921, apparently because the initial decision to depict President Wilson, a Democrat, on the coin might be reversed depending on the results of the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201920">1920 presidential election</a>. After Republican <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> won the presidency, the sponsors of the issue chose to depict <a href="William%20Bibb">William Bibb</a>, the State of Alabama's first governor, and <a href="Thomas%20Kilby">Thomas Kilby</a>, its governor at the time of the centennial, thus making Governor Kilby the first living person to appear on a U.S. coin. To boost sales, a symbol, 2X2 (recognizing Alabama as the 22nd state) was included in the design for a minority of the coins; these are generally more expensive today.

Alabama was admitted to the Union in 1819, and celebrated its centennial in 1919. The Alabama Centennial Commission sponsored local celebrations in the state in 1919 and 1920, but was beginning to wind down its operations before it began the push for a centennial coin. Numismatists Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a> later speculated that the members heard of other states which had received or which sought a commemorative coin, and, out of local pride, wanted the same for Alabama. The coin would also help with fundraising, and the proceeds were to be used for "historical and monumental" purposes. Commission members persuaded local congressman <a href="Lilius%20Bratton%20Rainey">Lilius Bratton Rainey</a> to push for passage of a bill authorizing a coin.

In 1920, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. Although not mentioned in the legislation, in the case of the Alabama Centennial half dollar, the centennial commission was the authorized group.

Rainey introduced legislation for an Alabama Centennial half dollar in the House of Representatives on February 28, 1920, with the bill designated as H.R. 12824. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, of which Indiana Congressman <a href="Albert%20Vestal">Albert Vestal</a> was the chairman. That committee held hearings on the bill on March 26, 1920, as well as on the coinage proposal that would become the <a href="Pilgrim%20Tercentenary%20half%20dollar">Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar</a>, with the Alabama coin the first order of business. Congressman Rainey, in his bill, had asked for 100,000 <a href="quarter%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">quarter dollars</a>, and while addressing the committee stated that the sole criticism of his coinage proposal in the Alabama press was one article suggesting he should have asked for double the amount. The choice of denomination came as a surprise to committee member <a href="William%20A.%20Ashbrook">William A. Ashbrook</a> of Ohio, a coin collector, who asked why Rainey was not asking for half dollars, as other states had. Rainey was amenable to that, and also accepted Ashbrook's discouragement when the Alabaman wanted to double the authorized number of coins. The committee voted to recommend Rainey's bill, with an amendment to provide for half dollars instead of quarters, and then proceeded to consider the Pilgrim proposal. Vestal had two days previously written to <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="David%20F.%20Houston">David F. Houston</a> about the Pilgrim coin, and Houston responded that while his department had not opposed the <a href="Maine%20Centennial%20half%20dollar">Maine Centennial</a> (previously approved by the committee) or Alabama coinage bills, the Treasury had concerns that issuing large numbers of different designs would aid fraudsters. Vestal issued a report on behalf of his committee on March 27, 1920, indicating his committee's support for the Alabama bill once amended, and attaching the note from Secretary Houston.

The three coinage bills—Maine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim Tercentenary—were considered in that order by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. As the Maine piece was considered, Ohio's <a href="Warren%20Gard">Warren Gard</a> asked questions about the bill's provisions, though he did not object to its passage. When the Alabama bill came to the floor, Vestal yielded time for a statement in favor from Rainey, which began with a brief explanation of the bill followed by a much longer paean to the glorious history of his home state, and his conclusion drew applause. Gard then questioned Vestal, and learned that another coin, the Pilgrim one, was next on the House's agenda. Gard expressed his concerns about commemorative coins, "but for the life of me I can not see what advantage there is for a State celebration to gather up a lot of coins with a particular stamp on them. It seems to me rather to cheapen the national coin. because it looks like an old-fashioned medal at a county
fair rather than the half dollar of the daddies, to use the old expression. I think that these propositions are open to serious objection, which, of course, should be voiced to the Secretary of the Treasury." Vestal agreed to pass on Gard's concerns to Secretary Houston, and the Alabama bill passed without dissent, to be followed by the Pilgrim one, again after questioning from Gard.

The following day, April 22, 1920, the House notified the Senate of its passage of the Alabama bill. It was referred to the <a href="Senate%20Committee%20on%20Banking%20and%20Currency">Senate Committee on Banking and Currency</a>; on April 28, Connecticut's <a href="George%20P.%20McLean">George P. McLean</a> reported it back with a recommendation it pass.

On May 3, McLean asked that the three coin bills (Maine, Alabama and Pilgrim) be considered by the Senate immediately, rather than waiting their turns, but Utah Senator <a href="Reed%20Smoot">Reed Smoot</a> objected: Smoot's attempt to bring up an anti-dumping trade bill had just been objected to by <a href="Charles%20S.%20Thomas">Charles S. Thomas</a> of Colorado. Smoot, however, stated if the bills had not been reached by about 2:00 pm, there would probably not be any objection. When McLean tried again to advance the coin bills, Kansas' <a href="Charles%20Curtis">Charles Curtis</a> asked if there was any urgency. McLean replied that as the three coin bills were to mark ongoing anniversaries, there was a need to have them authorized and get the production process started. All three bills passed the Senate without opposition and the Alabama bill was enacted with the signature of President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> on May 10, 1920.

Alabama Governor <a href="Thomas%20Kilby">Thomas Kilby</a> had a three-member commission headed by <a href="Marie%20Bankhead%20Owen">Marie Bankhead Owen</a> decide what design the state should recommend for the coins, and it solicited proposals from the public, but rejected all submissions. On June 1, 1920, Owen proposed to Kilby that one side have a depiction of the <a href="Alabama%20State%20Capitol">Alabama Capitol</a> building and the other <a href="jugate">jugate</a> heads of <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a> (president at the time of Alabama's admission in 1819) and <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> (president in 1919). Kilby sent the proposal, which included rough sketches, to the <a href="Director%20of%20the%20Mint">Director of the Mint</a>, <a href="Raymond%20T.%20Baker">Raymond T. Baker</a>, who forwarded it to the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> for its opinion. Its sculptor-member, <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a>, designer of the <a href="Buffalo%20nickel">Buffalo nickel</a>, disliked the capitol as a subject, feeling that buildings never translated well to coins. When this went back through channels to Owen, her committee reconsidered the building, and on June 24 she wrote to Baker substituting a design based on the <a href="Seal%20of%20Alabama">Seal of Alabama</a>, focused upon the eagle that was then a part of it, and if that was not acceptable, Owen suggested the design of the half dollar current in 1819. There the matter rested for an entire year.

Swiatek and Breen described the Alabama half dollar as caught up in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201920">presidential election of 1920</a>, as a Republican administration might not be willing to put the Democrat Wilson on a coin, or might insist on the new incumbent appearing, something likely to dampen sales in Alabama, part of the Democratic <a href="Solid%20South">Solid South</a>. The Republican, Ohio Senator <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a>, won the election and was inaugurated in March 1921. On June 29, 1921, Owen wrote to Baker, suggesting a new pair of honorees for the coin: Kilby, the state's chief executive at the time of the 1919 centennial, and the State of Alabama's first governor, <a href="William%20Bibb">William Bibb</a>. Cartoonist Frank Spangler of the "<a href="Montgomery%20Advertiser">Montgomery Advertiser</a>" prepared sketches of the new design. At James Fraser's suggestion, the plaster models were created by his wife, <a href="Laura%20Gardin%20Fraser">Laura Gardin Fraser</a>, who was a noted sculptor in her own right. She shipped her completed work to the Commission of Fine Arts on September 22, 1921, and gained members' approval; the models were then sent to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> for use in making coinage dies. Laura Fraser thus became the first woman to design a coin, not only of the U.S., but of any country.

The obverse of the coin features jugate busts of Bibb, Alabama's first governor as a state, and the incumbent in 1919, Kilby. In so appearing, Kilby became the first living person depicted on a U.S. coin. Anthony Swiatek, in his volume on commemoratives, averred that the issuance was not controversial at the time, as the Act of May 16, 1866, that forbids the depiction of living people on currency was deemed to refer to paper money only, but <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> wrote that the portrayal caused contemporary comment, for the position of the federal government (excepting some paper money issues of the 19th century) was that living people should not appear on U.S. money. A total of 22 stars flank the busts, symbolic of Alabama being the 22nd state; a message reinforced on those pieces bearing the inscription 2X2 in the obverse field. The X in that inscription alludes to the <a href="saltire">St. Andrew's cross</a> on the <a href="flag%20of%20Alabama">flag of Alabama</a>. The date, the names of the governors, and various other wordings appear towards the rim of the obverse.

The reverse features an eagle, possessing arrows and a shield, but no olive branch to symbolically counter the instruments of war; matched branches and arrows are often present in <a href="spreadeagle%20%28heraldry%29">heraldic depiction of eagles</a> on coins. The eagle's beak holds an end of a ribbon on which is inscribed the Alabama state motto, "" about which Swiatek and Breen, in their 1988 book jibed, "no pun intended about the sleepy Deep South".

Bowers complained that the centennial dates on the reverse, plus the 1921 for the year of striking, lead to "a bewildering confusion of dates to the casual observer". Numismatic historian <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a> deemed the half dollar "one of the most successful portrait coins in the commemorative series. The heads of Bibb and Kilby are true, and yet contain more than a touch of the ideal. They are beautifully related to each other. The eagle is equally fine".

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> considered the Alabama coin "a good example of the trite motifs, partly real and partly symbolic, that go into one of these statehood commemoratives". He suggested that the use of the jugate portraits "recall that this classical device was first revived in American coinage on the <a href="Lafayette%20dollar">Washington-Lafayette silver dollar</a> of 1900." Vermeule concluded that "vigorous lettering has saved uninteresting portraits from weakening the reverse and the defiant eagle of the obverse is handled in a spirit worthy of <a href="Augustus%20Saint-Gaudens">Saint-Gaudens</a>."

James Fraser had suggested to Fine Arts Commission chairman Moore that the Alabama committee be told that the Missouri Centennial half dollar issuers were having "2★4" placed on some of their coins, symbolizing Missouri being the 24th state and creating a second variety for collectors to obtain. Owen already knew of this, and "2X2" was placed on the obverse. A total of 6,006 half dollars was struck in October 1921, with six of them placed aside at Philadelphia for inspection and testing at the 1922 meeting of the annual <a href="Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>.

Alabama half dollars were first placed on sale on October 26, 1921, the day of President Harding's visit to Birmingham, Alabama, where he as a Mason laid the cornerstone for the city's new Masonic temple, and as president addressed a segregated crowd, urging improvement of race relations. Coins were sold from specially-built booths constructed just off the city's sidewalks. It is uncertain whether these coins bore the 2X2 or not. Official records show that all the coins struck in October were of the 2X2 <a href="glossary%20of%20numismatics%23V">variety</a>, and this was long accepted by numismatic historians. However, one coin collector recalled buying two of the half dollars that day, and over fifty later, all of the plain variety, and averred that none of the 2X2 could have been sold in Birmingham on the first day. As Owen wrote that the first 5,000 received bore the mark, Swiatek concluded that 1,000 of the October mintage was of the plain variety, all that was for sale in Birmingham. In December, 64,038 more were minted, with 38 set aside for assay. These were recorded to be of the plain variety. Both 2X2 and plain coins were struck from the same die; the mark was ground off to allow coinage of plain pieces.

Both varieties were sold by the centennial commission for $1, and primarily went to citizens of Alabama; banks throughout the state vended them. When they could not be sold, 5,000 of the plain variety were returned to the Mint and melted.

Although the 2X2 coins are only a tenth of the total mintage, they are considerably more common than that, as people were aware of their scarcity, with more saved and fewer spent in hard times. Bowers suggested that the mintage figures may be incorrect, and the 2X2 nearly as common as the plain variety. According to the deluxe edition of <a href="R.%20S.%20Yeoman">R. S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" published in 2015, the Alabama half lists for between $85 and $650 without 2X2 and between $170 and $850 with, dependent on condition. A specimen of the plain in exceptional condition sold for $7,344 in 2014.

John Young Brown (June 28, 1835January 11, 1904) was a politician from the U.S. <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Kentucky">Commonwealth of Kentucky</a>. He represented the state in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> and served as its <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Kentucky">31st</a> <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">governor</a>. Brown was elected to the House of Representatives for three non-consecutive terms, each of which was marred by controversy. He was first elected in 1859, despite his own protests that he was not yet twenty-five years old; the for serving in the legislature. The voters of his district elected him anyway, but he was not allowed to take his seat until <a href="36th%20United%20States%20Congress">the Congress'</a> second session, after he was of legal age to serve. After moving to <a href="Henderson%2C%20Kentucky">Henderson, Kentucky</a>, Brown was elected from that district in 1866. On this occasion, he was denied his seat because of alleged disloyalty to the Union during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>. Voters in his district refused to elect another representative, and the seat remained vacant throughout the term to which Brown was elected. After an unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in 1871, Brown was again elected to the House in 1872 and served three consecutive terms. During his final term, he was <a href="Censure%20in%20the%20United%20States">officially censured</a> for delivering a speech excoriating <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> Representative <a href="Benjamin%20Butler%20%28politician%29">Benjamin F.

After his service in the House, Brown took a break from politics, but re-entered the political arena as a candidate for governor of Kentucky in 1891. He secured the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> nomination in a four-way <a href="primary%20election">primary election</a>, then convincingly won the general election over his <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> challenger, Andrew T. Wood. Brown's administration, and the state Democratic Party, were split between <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a> supporters (including Brown) and supporters of the <a href="Free%20silver">free coinage of silver</a>. Brown's was also the first administration to operate under the <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">Kentucky Constitution of 1891</a>, and most of the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">legislature</a>'s time was spent adapting the state's code of laws to the new constitution. Consequently, little of significance was accomplished during Brown's term.

Brown hoped the legislature would elect him to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> following his term as governor. Having already alienated the free silver faction of his party, he backed "Goldbug" candidate Cassius M. Clay, Jr. for the Democratic nomination in the upcoming gubernatorial election. However, the deaths of two of Brown's children ended his interest in the gubernatorial race and his own senatorial ambitions. At the Democratic nominating convention of 1899, candidate <a href="William%20Goebel">William Goebel</a> used questionable tactics to secure the gubernatorial nomination, and a disgruntled faction of the party held a separate nominating convention, choosing Brown to oppose Goebel in the <a href="1899%20Kentucky%20gubernatorial%20election">general election</a>. Goebel was eventually declared the winner of the election, but was assassinated. Brown became the legal counsel for former <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20of%20Kentucky">Kentucky Secretary of State</a> <a href="Caleb%20Powers">Caleb Powers</a>, an accused conspirator in the assassination. Brown died in Henderson on January 11, 1904.

John Young Brown was born on June 27, 1835, in Claysville (near <a href="Elizabethtown%2C%20Kentucky">Elizabethtown</a>), <a href="Hardin%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Hardin County</a>, Kentucky. He was the son of Thomas Dudley and Elizabeth (Young) Brown. His father served in the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">state legislature</a> and was a delegate to the 1849 state constitutional convention. Two of his uncles, <a href="Bryan%20Rust%20Young">Bryan Rust Young</a> and <a href="William%20Singleton%20Young">William Singleton Young</a>, served as U.S. Representatives. Brown spent much time with his father at the <a href="Old%20State%20Capitol%20%28Kentucky%29">state capitol</a>, which sparked his early interest in politics.

Brown received his early education in the schools of Elizabethtown, and in 1851, at the age of sixteen, matriculated at <a href="Centre%20College">Centre College</a> in <a href="Danville%2C%20Kentucky">Danville, Kentucky</a>. In 1855, he graduated from Centre and returned to Hardin County to <a href="reading%20law">read law</a>. He was admitted to the <a href="Bar%20%28law%29">bar</a> in 1857 and opened his practice in Elizabethtown. His reputation as an orator put him in high demand, but his zealous criticism of the <a href="Know%20Nothing%20Party">Know Nothing Party</a> drew threats against his life.

Brown married Lucie Barbee in 1857, but she died the following year. In September 1860, he married Rebecca Hart Dixon, the daughter of former <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senator</a> <a href="Archibald%20Dixon">Archibald Dixon</a>. The couple had eight children.

At a meeting of local Democrats in <a href="Bardstown%2C%20Kentucky">Bardstown, Kentucky</a>, in 1859, Brown was nominated to oppose <a href="Joshua%20Jewett">Joshua Jewett</a> for Jewett's seat in the House of Representatives. Despite Brown's protests that he was more than a year younger than the legal age to serve, he was elected over Jewett by about two thousand votes. He did not take his seat until the second congressional session because of his age. He became a member of the <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Douglas</a> National Committee in 1860 and engaged in a series of debates with supporters of <a href="John%20C.%20Breckinridge">John C. Breckinridge</a> for president, including Breckinridge's cousin, <a href="William%20Campbell%20Preston%20Breckinridge">William Campbell Preston Breckinridge</a>.
It is not clear exactly when Brown relocated to <a href="Henderson%2C%20Kentucky">Henderson, Kentucky</a>. <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> officer <a href="Stovepipe%20Johnson">Stovepipe Johnson</a> recounts that Brown was among the city leaders who welcomed him to Henderson in early 1862, but other sources state that Brown did not settle in Henderson until after the war. His sympathies during the war were decidedly with the Confederacy.

Brown was re-elected to the House of Representatives in 1866. His seat was declared vacant, however, because of his alleged disloyalty during the war. Voters in his district refused to elect anyone else to fill the vacancy, and Governor <a href="John%20W.%20Stevenson">John W. Stevenson</a> filed an official protest of the House's action, but the seat remained unfilled throughout the <a href="Fortieth%20United%20States%20Congress">Fortieth Congress</a>.

Governor Stevenson resigned his office to accept a seat in the U.S. Senate, and the remainder of his term was filled by <a href="President%20pro%20tempore%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20Senate">President Pro Tem of the Senate</a> <a href="Preston%20Leslie">Preston Leslie</a>. When Leslie, who enjoyed only lukewarm support from his party, sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1871, Brown's name was among those put in nomination against his; after a few ballots, however, it became clear that Brown would not be able to gain a majority, and his supporters abandoned their support of him in favor of other candidates. The following year, Brown was re-elected to the House of Representatives by an overwhelming vote of 10,888 to 457 and was allowed to assume his seat. He was twice re-elected, serving until 1877.

Brown's most notable action in the House was a speech he made on February 4, 1875, in response to <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> Representative <a href="Benjamin%20Butler%20%28politician%29">Benjamin F. Butler</a>'s call to pass the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201875">Civil Rights Act of 1875</a>. Referring to comments Butler had made the previous day about lawlessness against African-Americans in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a>, Brown claimed that unjust charges had been made against Southerners by an individual "who is outlawed in his own home by respectable society, whose name is synonymous with falsehood, who is the champion, and has been on all occasions, of fraud; who is the apologist of thieves, who is such a prodigy of vice and meanness that to describe him would sicken the imagination and exhaust invective." Brown continued by referencing notorious <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a> murderer <a href="Burke%20and%20Hare%20murders">William Burke</a>, whose method of murdering his victims became known as "Burking." At this point in the speech, <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a> interrupted Brown, asking if he was referring to a member of the House; Brown gave an ambiguous response before continuing: "If I wished to describe all that was pusillanimous in war, inhuman in peace, forbidden in morals, and infamous in politics, I should call it 'Butlerizing'." The House gallery exploded in protest at Brown's remark, and incensed Republican legislators called for Brown's immediate expulsion. Though not expelled, he was officially censured by the House for the use of <a href="Parliamentary%20procedure">unparliamentary</a> language. The censure was expunged from the record by a subsequent Congress.

Following his service in the House, Brown resumed his law practice in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>. In 1891, he was a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. The other candidates included Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr., son of former Congressman <a href="Brutus%20J.%20Clay">Brutus J. Clay</a> and nephew of <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> <a href="Cassius%20Marcellus%20Clay%20%28politician%29">Cassius Marcellus Clay</a>; Dr. <a href="John%20Daniel%20Clardy">John Daniel Clardy</a>, later to be elected a U.S. Representative; and <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Kentucky">Attorney General</a> <a href="Parker%20Watkins%20Hardin">Parker Watkins Hardin</a>. The party was split between supporters of corporations, such as the <a href="Louisville%20and%20Nashville%20Railroad">Louisville and Nashville Railroad</a>, and supporters of agrarian interests. Another split was between the more conservative <a href="Bourbon%20Democrats">Bourbon Democrats</a>, who supported maintaining the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>, and more progressive Democrats, who called for <a href="Free%20Silver">the free coinage of silver</a>. Agrarian voters were about equally split between Clay and Clardy, while Free Silver Democrats were about equally split between Hardin and Clardy. Having lived in the agrarian western part of the state for most of his life, and never having alienated the powerful <a href="Farmers%27%20Alliance">Farmers' Alliance</a>, Brown was acceptable to most agrarian interests, while the Louisville and Nashville Railroad felt he was a moderate on the issue of corporate regulation. Bourbon Democrats were also pleased with his sound money stand.

Entering the Democratic nominating convention, Brown seemed to be the favorite for the nomination. On the first ballot, he garnered the most votes (275), leading Clay (264), Clardy (190), and Hardin (186). Over the next nine ballots, the vote counts changed little. Finally, the convention chairman announced that the candidate receiving the fewest votes on the next ballot would be dropped from the voting. Clardy received the fewest votes, and on the next ballot, his supporters divided almost equally between the remaining three candidates. Hardin was the next candidate to be dropped, and Brown received a majority over Clay on the thirteenth ballot.

The Republicans nominated Andrew T. Wood, a lawyer from <a href="Mount%20Sterling%2C%20Kentucky">Mount Sterling</a>, who had failed in earlier elections for Congress and state attorney general. Concurrently with the gubernatorial election, the state's voters would decide whether to ratify a proposed new constitution for the state in 1891. The divided Democrats had taken no stand on the document as part of their convention's platform, and Wood spent much of the campaign trying to get Brown to declare his support for or opposition to it. About six weeks before the election, Brown, sensing strong public support for the new constitution, finally came out in favor of it. For the remainder of the race, Wood touted an alleged conspiracy between Brown and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad to thwart meaningful corporate regulations, but the issue failed to gain much traction.

Both Democrats and Republicans were concerned about the presence of S. Brewer Erwin, nominee of the newly formed <a href="Populist%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Populist Party</a>, in the race; he enjoyed strong support for a third-party candidate, despite the fact that many believed his party's platform was too radical. Democrats, who were used to carrying the agrarian vote by a wide margin, were especially concerned that the Farmers' Alliance, consisting of over 125,000 members in Kentucky, would endorse Erwin. This did not occur, however, and in the general election, Brown defeated Wood by a vote of 144,168 to 116,087. Though he won the election, Brown had not won a majority of the votes; Populist Erwin captured 25,631 votes – 9 percent of the total cast – and a <a href="Prohibition%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Prohibition</a> candidate received 3,292 votes.

Turmoil marked the legislative sessions of Brown's term; his supporters had been either unwilling or unable to influence the rest of the Democratic slate, and tensions over the currency issue soon split the administration. <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Kentucky">Attorney General</a> William Jackson Hendricks, Treasurer Henry S. Hale, and Auditor Luke C. Norman were all free silver supporters and feuded with Brown and his (appointed) <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20of%20Kentucky">secretary of state</a>, John W. Headley, throughout Brown's term. Over time, the rift deepened and spread to the entire Democratic party. Brown also frequently clashed with the legislature and vetoed several of the bills it passed; none of his vetoes were ever overridden.

When the General Assembly convened on the last day of 1891, Brown reported that he had appointed a commission to study the impact of the new constitution on the state's existing laws. He also announced that the state's present budget deficit was $229,000 and was expected to reach almost half a million dollars by the end of 1893. With these two large issues facing it, the Assembly was in session almost continuously from December 1891 to July 1893. The length of the session earned it a derisive nickname – the "Long Parliament". Part of the reason for the extended session was each chamber's difficulty in achieving a <a href="quorum">quorum</a>; a Louisville newspaper reported that, for an entire month, the largest attendance in the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> was 61 of 100 members. Consequently, some bills were passed by a plurality instead of a majority of the legislators. Fearing that these bills would be challenged in court, Brown vetoed them.

During the session, Brown secured the termination of a statewide geological survey, deeming it too expensive. By constitutional mandate, the regular session ended August 16, but Brown convened a special session of the legislature on August 25 because important bills that he had vetoed needed to be rewritten and passed, and because some bills he had signed needed to be amended to comply with the new constitution. Major legislation advocated by Brown and passed by the General Assembly included improvements in tax collection processes and tighter controls on corporations. Among the measures not specifically advocated by Brown that were enacted by the General Assembly was a measure racially segregating the state's railroad cars, called the "separate coach law". The special session lasted until November 1.

Brown won acclaim from the railroad companies for vetoing a proposed railroad tax increase, but soon drew their ire for preventing the merger of the state's two largest railways, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad and the <a href="Chesapeake%20and%20Ohio%20Railway">Chesapeake and Ohio Railway</a>. The Mason and Foard Company, which leased <a href="Penal%20labour">convict labor</a> to build railroads, resented Brown's prison reforms. Brown accused his predecessor, <a href="Simon%20Bolivar%20Buckner">Simon Bolivar Buckner</a>, of illegally allowing Mason and Foard to use convict labor, a charge Buckner vehemently denied.

During the 1894 legislative session, Brown advocated and won passage of several government efficiency measures, including a bill to transfer certain state governmental expenses to the counties, a bill to reform state printing contracts, and measures clarifying laws governing asylums and charitable institutions. The most significant bill, and the one that generated the most debate, was a law giving married women individual property rights for the first time in state history. Other measures passed during the session included a basic coal safety measure, a common school statute, a measure prohibiting collusive bidding on tobacco, new regulations on grain warehouses, and a law providing free turnpikes. Measures advocated by Brown but not enacted by the Assembly included broadening the powers of the state railroad commission, establishing the offices of state bank inspector and superintendent of public printing, and reforming prison management, including separate detention of adolescent criminals. Brown also lobbied for the abolition of the state parole board; when the Assembly refused, Brown vowed to ignore the board's recommendations.

Mob violence was prevalent in Kentucky during Brown's tenure as governor. From 1892 to 1895, there were fifty-six <a href="lynching">lynching</a>s in the state. During one notable incident, a <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a> judge refused to <a href="extradition">extradite</a> a black man suspected of shooting a white man in Kentucky. The judge's decision was based on his opinion that the accused was likely to be the victim of mob violence if returned to Kentucky. In disputing the judge's decision, Governor Brown attempted to justify some of the violence that had occurred in the state's past, declaring "It is much to be regretted that we have occasionally had mob violence in this Commonwealth, but it has always been when the passions of the people have been inflamed by the commission of the most atrocious crimes."

It was widely known that Brown desired election to the U.S. Senate when his gubernatorial term expired in 1896. The leading Democratic candidates to succeed Brown as governor were his old rivals, Cassius M. Clay, Jr. and Parker Watkins Hardin, and Brown believed he would need his eventual successor's support to secure the Senate seat. Having already alienated Hardin and his free silver allies, Brown threw his support to Clay. Family tragedy would soon remove his interest in the race, however. On October 30, 1894, Brown's teenage daughter Susan died of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. A few months later, his son, Archibald Dixon Brown, divorced his wife; it was subsequently discovered that he had been carrying on an <a href="extramarital%20affair">extramarital affair</a>. Acting on an anonymous tip, his lover's husband found the couple at a <a href="brothel">brothel</a> in Louisville; drawing his pistol, he shot his wife and Archibald Brown, killing them both. Of the series of family tragedies, Governor Brown wrote to Clay, "I shall not be a candidate for the Senate. The calamities of my children, which have recently befallen, have utterly unfitted me for the contest. My grief is so severe that, like a black vampire of the night, it seems to have sucked dry the very arteries and veins of my ambition." Clay went on to lose the nomination to Hardin. Brown refused to endorse Hardin, and the fractured Democratic party watched as the Republicans elected <a href="William%20O.%20Bradley">William O. Bradley</a>, the party's first-ever governor of Kentucky. Despite Brown's proclaimed lack of interest in the Senate seat, he received one vote during the tumultuous 1896 Senate election to replace Senator <a href="J.%20C.%20S.%20Blackburn">J. C. S. Blackburn</a>.
After his term as governor, Brown again returned to his legal practice in Louisville. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the House of Representatives in 1896, losing to Republican <a href="Walter%20Evans%20%28American%20politician%29">Walter Evans</a>. He would later claim that he had only run in order to improve Democratic voter turnout for <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>'s <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201896">1896 presidential bid</a>. Prior to the 1899 Democratic nominating convention, Brown was mentioned as a possible gubernatorial nominee, but he declined to become a candidate. When the convention began, he was mentioned as a candidate for convention chairman, but he also refused to serve in this capacity.

Despite his proclaimed lack of interest in the gubernatorial nomination, Brown's name was entered as a candidate on the first ballot, along with Parker Watkins Hardin, former Congressman <a href="William%20Johnson%20Stone">William J. Stone</a>, and <a href="William%20Goebel">William Goebel</a>, President Pro Tempore of the state senate. The convention was thrown into chaos when a widely known agreement between Stone and Goebel – designed to get Hardin out of the race – broke down. As balloting continued over the next four days (Sunday excepted) with no candidate receiving a majority, Brown continued to receive a few votes on each ballot. Finally, the convention delegates decided to drop the candidate with the lowest vote total until one candidate received a majority; this resulted in the nomination of Goebel a few ballots later.

Following the convention, disgruntled Democrats began to talk about rejecting their party's nominee and holding another nominating convention. Brown became the leader of this group, styled the "Honest Election League". Plans for the new convention were made at a meeting held August 2, 1899, in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>. The nomination was made official at a convention held in that city on August 16. In addition to Brown, the Honest Election League nominated a full slate of candidates for the other state offices.

Brown opened his campaign with a speech at <a href="Bowling%20Green%2C%20Kentucky">Bowling Green</a> on August 26, 1899. He answered many allegations that had been made about him, including claims that he had secretly been seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination all along, that he had ambitions of succeeding Senator <a href="William%20Joseph%20Deboe">William Joseph Deboe</a>, and that following the nominating convention, he had agreed to speak on behalf of the Goebel ticket. Brown conceded that he desired Senator Deboe's senate seat and that he had agreed to accept the gubernatorial nomination if it had been offered to him, but he denied that he had ever agreed to speak on Goebel's behalf. Outgoing Senator Blackburn also charged that Brown was bolting the party again, just as he had in supporting Stephen Douglas over John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860. Brown replied by quoting an article by William Jennings Bryan's "<a href="Omaha%20World-Herald">Omaha World-Herald</a>" that asserted the right of an individual to vote against the nominee of his party if the individual deemed the nominee unfit.

Due to his age and ill health, Brown was able to speak only once per week. At a campaign event in <a href="Madisonville%2C%20Kentucky">Madisonville</a>, he challenged Goebel to a debate, but Goebel ignored the challenge. Brown, and other speakers enlisted on behalf of his campaign, frequently called attention to Goebel's refusal to acknowledge the challenge or agree to a debate. When William Jennings Bryan came to the state to campaign with Goebel, Brown sent him a letter challenging him to repudiate Goebel's nomination because of the broken agreement between Goebel and Stone. Bryan refused to comment on the events of the convention and stressed the importance of party loyalty. He denounced the Honest Election League's convention as irregular and invalid.

Brown's campaign faltered as the race drew to a close. Two weeks prior to the election, Brown was injured in a fall at <a href="Leitchfield%2C%20Kentucky">Leitchfield</a>; as a result of the injury, he was confined to his home and unable to deliver campaign speeches, despite several attempts to allow him to speak from a chair or wheelchair. The final vote count gave Republican <a href="William%20S.%20Taylor">William S. Taylor</a> a small plurality with 193,714 votes to Goebel's 191,331; Brown garnered only 12,140 votes.

Goebel challenged the vote returns in several counties. While the challenges were being adjudicated, Goebel was shot by an unknown assassin; Goebel was ultimately declared the winner of the election, but died of his wounds two days after being sworn into office. Among those charged in Goebel's murder was Governor Taylor's Secretary of State, <a href="Caleb%20Powers">Caleb Powers</a>. Powers employed Brown as his legal counsel during his first trial, which ended in a conviction in July 1900. Brown died January 11, 1904, in Henderson and was buried at the Fernwood Cemetery in that city. He was the namesake of, but not related to, 20th century Kentucky Congressman <a href="John%20Y.%20Brown%2C%20Sr.">John Y. Brown, Sr.</a>

Gerald Ford

Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr. (born Leslie Lynch King Jr.; July 14, 1913 – December 26, 2006) was an American politician who served as the 38th <a href="president%20of%20the%20United%20States">president of the United States</a> from August 1974 to January 1977. Before his accession to the presidency, Ford served as the 40th <a href="vice%20president%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice president of the United States</a> from December 1973 to August 1974. Ford is the only person to have served as both vice president and president without being elected to either office by the <a href="United%20States%20Electoral%20College">United States Electoral College</a>.

Born in <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, and raised in <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids, Michigan</a>, Ford attended the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> and <a href="Yale%20Law%20School">Yale Law School</a>. After the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, he enlisted in the <a href="U.S.%20Naval%20Reserve">U.S. Naval Reserve</a>, serving from 1942 to 1946; he left as a <a href="lieutenant%20commander">lieutenant commander</a>. Ford began his political career in 1949 as the <a href="U.S.%20Representative">U.S. representative</a> from <a href="Michigan%27s%205th%20congressional%20district">Michigan's 5th congressional district</a>. He served in this capacity for 25 years, the final nine of them as the <a href="Party%20leaders%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House Minority Leader</a>. Following the <a href="Spiro%20Agnew%23Criminal%20investigation%20and%20resignation">resignation of Spiro Agnew</a>, Ford was the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the <a href="25th%20Amendment">25th Amendment</a>. After the resignation of <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, Ford immediately assumed the presidency. His <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States%20by%20time%20in%20office">895 day-long presidency is the shortest</a> in U.S. history for any president who did not die in office.

As president, Ford signed the <a href="Helsinki%20Accords">Helsinki Accords</a>, which marked a move toward <a href="d%C3%A9tente">détente</a> in the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. With the collapse of <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> nine months into his presidency, U.S. involvement in <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> essentially . Domestically, Ford presided over the worst economy in the four decades since the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, with growing inflation and a <a href="recession">recession</a> during his tenure. In one of his most controversial acts, he granted a <a href="Pardon%20of%20Richard%20Nixon">presidential pardon</a> to President Richard Nixon for his role in the <a href="Watergate%20scandal">Watergate scandal</a>. During Ford's presidency, foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play, and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the President. In the Republican presidential primary campaign of 1976, Ford defeated former California Governor <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> for the Republican nomination. He narrowly lost the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201976">presidential election</a> to the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> challenger, former Georgia Governor <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>.

Following his years as president, Ford remained active in the Republican Party. His moderate views on various social issues increasingly put him at odds with conservative members of the party in the 1990s and early 2000s. After experiencing a series of health problems, he <a href="Death%20and%20state%20funeral%20of%20Gerald%20Ford">died at home</a> on December 26, 2006.

Ford was born Leslie Lynch King Jr. on July 14, 1913, at <a href="3202%20Woolworth%20Avenue">3202 Woolworth Avenue</a> in <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, where his parents lived with his paternal grandparents. He was the child of <a href="Dorothy%20Ayer%20Gardner">Dorothy Ayer Gardner</a> and <a href="Leslie%20Lynch%20King%20Sr.">Leslie Lynch King Sr.</a>, a wool trader. His father was a son of prominent banker <a href="Charles%20Henry%20King">Charles Henry King</a> and Martha Alicia King (née Porter). Gardner separated from King just sixteen days after her son's birth. She took her son with her to <a href="Oak%20Park%2C%20Illinois">Oak Park, Illinois</a>, home of her sister Tannisse and brother-in-law, Clarence Haskins James. From there, she moved to the home of her parents, Levi Addison Gardner and Adele Augusta Ayer, in <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids, Michigan</a>. Gardner and King divorced in December 1913, and she gained full custody of her son. Ford's paternal grandfather Charles Henry King paid child support until shortly before his death in 1930.

Ford later said that his biological father had a history of hitting his mother. In a biography of Ford,
<a href="James%20M.%20Cannon">James M. Cannon</a>, a member of the Ford administration, wrote that the separation and divorce of Ford's parents were sparked when, a few days after Ford's birth, Leslie King took a <a href="butcher%20knife">butcher knife</a> and threatened to kill his wife, his infant son, and Ford's nursemaid. Ford later told confidants that his father had first hit his mother when she smiled at another man during their honeymoon.

After living with her parents for two-and-a-half years, Gardner married <a href="Gerald%20Rudolff%20Ford">Gerald Rudolff Ford</a> on February 1, 1916. Gerald was a salesman in a family-owned paint and varnish company. They now called her son Gerald Rudolff Ford Jr. The future president was never formally <a href="adopted">adopted</a> and did not legally change his name until December 3, 1935; he also used a more conventional spelling of his middle name. He was raised in <a href="East%20Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a> with his three half-brothers from his mother's second marriage: <a href="Thomas%20Gardner%20Ford">Thomas Gardner "Tom" Ford</a> (1918–1995), Richard Addison "Dick" Ford (1924–2015), and James Francis "Jim" Ford (1927–2001).

Ford also had three half-siblings from the second marriage of Leslie King Sr., his biological father: Marjorie King (1921–1993), Leslie Henry King (1923–1976), and Patricia Jane King (1925–1980). They never saw one another as children, and he did not know them at all until 1960. Ford was not aware of his biological father until he was 17, when his parents told him about the circumstances of his birth. That year his biological father, whom Ford described as a "carefree, well-to-do man who didn't really give a damn about the hopes and dreams of his firstborn son", approached Ford while he was waiting tables in a Grand Rapids restaurant. The two "maintained a sporadic contact" until Leslie King Sr.'s death in 1941.

Ford said, "My stepfather was a magnificent person and my mother equally wonderful. So I couldn't have written a better prescription for a superb family upbringing."

Ford was involved in the <a href="Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America">Boy Scouts of America</a>, and earned that program's highest rank, <a href="Eagle%20Scout%20%28Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%29">Eagle Scout</a>. He is the only Eagle Scout to have ascended to the U.S. Presidency.

Ford attended Grand Rapids South High School, where he was a star athlete and <a href="captain%20%28sports%29">captain</a> of the <a href="American%20football">football</a> team. In 1930, he was selected to the All-City team of the <a href="Grand%20Rapids%20City%20League">Grand Rapids City League</a>. He also attracted the attention of college recruiters.

Ford attended the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, where he joined the <a href="Delta%20Kappa%20Epsilon">Delta Kappa Epsilon</a> fraternity (Omicron chapter). He washed dishes at his fraternity house to earn money for college expenses.

Ford played <a href="center%20%28American%20football%29">center</a>, <a href="linebacker">linebacker</a>, and <a href="long%20snapper">long snapper</a> for the school's football team and helped the <a href="Michigan%20Wolverines%20football">Wolverines</a> to two undefeated seasons and <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20National%20Football%20Championship">national titles</a> in <a href="1932%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20football%20team">1932</a> and <a href="1933%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20football%20team">1933</a>. In his senior year of <a href="1934%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20football%20team">1934</a>, the team suffered a steep decline and won only one game, but Ford was still the team's star player. In one of those games, Michigan held heavily favored <a href="Minnesota%20Golden%20Gophers%20football">Minnesota</a>—the eventual national champion—to a scoreless tie in the first half. After the game, assistant coach <a href="Bennie%20Oosterbaan">Bennie Oosterbaan</a> said, "When I walked into the dressing room at halftime, I had tears in my eyes I was so proud of them. Ford and [Cedric] Sweet played their hearts out. They were everywhere on defense." Ford later recalled, "During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds." His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, "They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause."

During Ford's senior year, a controversy developed when <a href="Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football">Georgia Tech</a> said that it would not play a scheduled game with Michigan if a black player named <a href="Willis%20Ward">Willis Ward</a> took the field. Students, players, and alumni protested, but university officials capitulated and kept Ward out of the game. Ford was Ward's best friend on the team, and they roomed together while on road trips. Ford reportedly threatened to quit the team in response to the university's decision, but he eventually agreed to play against Georgia Tech when Ward personally asked him to play.

In 1934, Ford was selected for the Eastern Team on the Shriner's <a href="East%E2%80%93West%20Shrine%20Game">East–West Shrine Game</a> at San Francisco (a benefit for physically disabled children), played on January 1, 1935. As part of the 1935 Collegiate All-Star football team, Ford played against the <a href="Chicago%20Bears">Chicago Bears</a> in the <a href="Chicago%20College%20All-Star%20Game">Chicago College All-Star Game</a> at <a href="Soldier%20Field">Soldier Field</a>. In honor of his athletic accomplishments and his later political career, the University of Michigan retired Ford's No. 48 jersey in 1994. With the blessing of the Ford family, it was placed back into circulation in 2012 as part of the <a href="Michigan%20Wolverines%20football%23Michigan%20Football%20Legends">Michigan Football Legends</a> program and issued to sophomore linebacker Desmond Morgan before a home game against <a href="University%20of%20Illinois">Illinois</a> on October 13.

Throughout life, Ford remained interested in his school and football; he occasionally attended games. Ford also visited with players and coaches during practices; at one point, he asked to join the players in the huddle. Before state events, Ford often had the Navy band play the University of Michigan fight song, "<a href="The%20Victors">The Victors</a>", instead of "<a href="Hail%20to%20the%20Chief">Hail to the Chief</a>".

Ford graduated from Michigan in 1935 with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in <a href="economics">economics</a>. He turned down offers from the <a href="Detroit%20Lions">Detroit Lions</a> and <a href="Green%20Bay%20Packers">Green Bay Packers</a> of the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a>. Instead, he took a job in September 1935 as the boxing coach and assistant varsity football coach at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> and applied to its law school.

Ford hoped to attend Yale Law School beginning in 1935. Yale officials at first denied his admission to the law school because of his full-time coaching responsibilities. He spent the summer of 1937 as a student at the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20Law%20School">University of Michigan Law School</a> and was eventually admitted in the spring of 1938 to <a href="Yale%20Law%20School">Yale Law School</a>. Ford earned his <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Laws">LL.B.</a> degree in 1941 (later amended to <a href="Juris%20Doctor">Juris Doctor</a>), graduating in the top 25 percent of his class.

While attending Yale Law School, Ford joined a group of students led by <a href="R.%20Douglas%20Stuart%20Jr.">R. Douglas Stuart Jr.</a>, and signed a petition to enforce the 1939 <a href="Neutrality%20Acts%20of%201930s">Neutrality Act</a>. The petition was circulated nationally and was the inspiration for the <a href="America%20First%20Committee">America First Committee</a>, a group determined to keep the U.S. out of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. In the summer of 1940 he worked in <a href="Wendell%20Willkie">Wendell Willkie</a>'s presidential campaign.

Ford graduated from law school in 1941 and was admitted to the Michigan <a href="bar%20%28law%29">bar</a> shortly thereafter. In May 1941, he opened a Grand Rapids law practice with a friend, <a href="Philip%20W.%20Buchen">Philip W. Buchen</a>, who would later serve as Ford's White House counsel.

Following the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, Ford enlisted in the navy. He received a commission as <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29%23United%20States">ensign</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20Reserve">U.S. Naval Reserve</a> on April 13, 1942. On April 20, he reported for active duty to the V-5 instructor school at <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a>. After one month of training, he went to Navy Preflight School in <a href="Chapel%20Hill%2C%20North%20Carolina">Chapel Hill, North Carolina</a>, where he was one of 83 instructors and taught elementary navigation skills, ordnance, gunnery, first aid, and military drill. In addition, he coached all nine sports that were offered, but mostly swimming, boxing, and football. During the year he was at the Preflight School, he was promoted to <a href="Lieutenant%2C%20Junior%20Grade">Lieutenant, Junior Grade</a>, on June 2, 1942, and to lieutenant, in March 1943.

After Ford applied for sea duty, he was sent in May 1943 to the pre-commissioning detachment for the new aircraft carrier , at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, <a href="Camden%2C%20New%20Jersey">Camden, New Jersey</a>. From the ship's commissioning on June 17, 1943, until the end of December 1944, Ford served as the assistant navigator, Athletic Officer, and antiaircraft battery officer on board the "Monterey". While he was on board, the carrier participated in many actions in the <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Theater">Pacific Theater</a> with the <a href="United%20States%20Third%20Fleet">Third</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Fifth%20Fleet">Fifth Fleets</a> in late 1943 and 1944. In 1943, the carrier helped secure <a href="Makin%20%28islands%29">Makin Island</a> in the Gilberts, and participated in carrier strikes against <a href="Kavieng">Kavieng</a>, New Ireland in 1943. During the spring of 1944, the "Monterey" supported landings at <a href="Kwajalein">Kwajalein</a> and <a href="Eniwetok">Eniwetok</a> and participated in carrier strikes in the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Marianas</a>, <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Western Carolines</a>, and northern <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, as well as in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Philippine%20Sea">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a>. After an overhaul, from September to November 1944, aircraft from the "Monterey" launched strikes against <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a>, participated in strikes in the Philippines and <a href="Ryukyu%20Islands">Ryukyus</a>, and supported the landings at <a href="Leyte%20Island">Leyte</a> and <a href="Mindoro">Mindoro</a>.

Although the ship was not damaged by <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> forces, the "Monterey" was one of several ships damaged by the <a href="Typhoon%20Cobra">typhoon</a> that hit <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="William%20Halsey%20Jr.">William Halsey's</a> Third Fleet on December 18–19, 1944. The Third Fleet lost three <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s and over 800 men during the typhoon. The "Monterey" was damaged by a fire, which was started by several of the ship's aircraft tearing loose from their cables and colliding on the hangar deck. During the storm, Ford narrowly avoided becoming a casualty himself. As he was going to his battle station on the bridge of the ship in the early morning of December 18, the ship rolled twenty-five degrees, which caused Ford to lose his footing and slide toward the edge of the deck. The two-inch steel ridge around the edge of the carrier slowed him enough so he could roll, and he twisted into the catwalk below the deck. As he later stated, "I was lucky; I could have easily gone overboard."

Ford was serving as General Quarters Officer of the Deck and was ordered to go below to assess the raging fire. He did so safely, and reported his findings back to the ship's commanding officer, <a href="Stuart%20H.%20Ingersoll">Captain Stuart Ingersoll</a>. The ship's crew was able to contain the fire, and the ship got underway again.

After the fire, the "Monterey" was declared unfit for service, and the crippled carrier reached <a href="Ulithi">Ulithi</a> on December 21 before continuing across the Pacific to <a href="Bremerton%2C%20Washington">Bremerton, Washington</a> where it underwent repairs. On December 24, 1944, at Ulithi, Ford was detached from the ship and sent to the Navy Pre-Flight School at <a href="Saint%20Mary%27s%20College%20of%20California">Saint Mary's College of California</a>, where he was assigned to the Athletic Department until April 1945. One of his duties was to coach football. From the end of April 1945 to January 1946, he was on the staff of the Naval Reserve Training Command, <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Glenview">Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois</a>, as the Staff Physical and Military Training Officer. On October 3, 1945, he was promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20commander">lieutenant commander</a>.

Ford received the following military awards: the <a href="American%20Campaign%20Medal">American Campaign Medal</a>, the <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Campaign%20Medal">Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal</a> with nine <a href="Service%20star">" bronze stars</a> (for operations in the <a href="Gilbert%20Islands">Gilbert Islands</a>, <a href="Bismarck%20Archipelago">Bismarck Archipelago</a>, Marshall Islands, Asiatic and Pacific carrier raids, <a href="Battle%20of%20Hollandia">Hollandia</a>, Marianas, Western Carolines, Western New Guinea, and the Leyte Operation), the <a href="Philippine%20Liberation%20Medal">Philippine Liberation Medal</a> with two " bronze stars (for Leyte and Mindoro), and the <a href="World%20War%20II%20Victory%20Medal">World War II Victory Medal</a>.

In January 1946, Ford was sent to Separation Center, <a href="Naval%20Station%20Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> to be processed out. He was released from active duty under honorable conditions on February 23, 1946. On June 28, 1946, the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> accepted Ford's resignation from the Naval Reserve. Ford remained in the inactive Naval Reserve until 1963.

On October 15, 1948, Ford married <a href="Betty%20Ford">Elizabeth Bloomer</a> (1918–2011) at Grace <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America">Episcopal Church</a> in Grand Rapids; it was his first and only marriage and her second marriage. She had previously been married and, after a five‐year marriage, divorced from William Warren.

Originally from Grand Rapids herself, she had lived in New York City for several years, where she worked as a <a href="John%20Robert%20Powers">John Robert Powers</a> fashion model and a dancer in the auxiliary troupe of the <a href="Martha%20Graham">Martha Graham</a> Dance Company. At the time of their engagement, Ford was campaigning for what would be his first of 13 terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives. The wedding was delayed until shortly before the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201948">election</a> because, as "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported in a 1974 profile of Betty Ford, "Jerry Ford was running for Congress and wasn't sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced exdancer."

The couple had four children:

After Ford returned to Grand Rapids in 1946, he became active in local Republican politics, and supporters urged him to challenge <a href="Bartel%20J.%20Jonkman">Bartel J. Jonkman</a>, the incumbent Republican congressman. Military service had changed his view of the world. "I came back a converted <a href="Internationalism%20%28politics%29">internationalist</a>", Ford wrote, "and of course our congressman at that time was an avowed, dedicated <a href="United%20States%20non-interventionism">isolationist</a>. And I thought he ought to be replaced. Nobody thought I could win. I ended up winning two to one."

During his first campaign in 1948, Ford visited voters at their doorsteps and as they left the factories where they worked. Ford also visited local farms where, in one instance, a wager resulted in Ford spending two weeks milking cows following his election victory.

Ford was a member of the House of Representatives for 25 years, holding <a href="Michigan%27s%205th%20congressional%20district">Michigan's 5th congressional district</a> seat from 1949 to 1973. It was a tenure largely notable for its modesty. As an editorial in "The New York Times" described him, Ford "saw himself as a negotiator and a reconciler, and the record shows it: he did not write a single piece of major legislation in his entire career." Appointed to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Appropriations">House Appropriations Committee</a> two years after being elected, he was a prominent member of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Appropriations%20Subcommittee%20on%20Defense">Defense Appropriations Subcommittee</a>. Ford described his philosophy as "a moderate in domestic affairs, an internationalist in foreign affairs, and a conservative in fiscal policy." Ford was known to his colleagues in the House as a "Congressman's Congressman".

In the early 1950s, Ford declined offers to run for either the Senate or the Michigan governorship. Rather, his ambition was to become <a href="United%20States%20Speaker%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a>, which he called "the ultimate achievement. To sit up there and be the head honcho of 434 other people and have the responsibility, aside from the achievement, of trying to run the greatest legislative body in the history of mankind ... I think I got that ambition within a year or two after I was in the House of Representatives".

On November 29, 1963, President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> appointed Ford to the <a href="Warren%20Commission">Warren Commission</a>, a special task force set up to investigate the <a href="Assassination%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy">assassination</a> of President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>. Ford was assigned to prepare a biography of accused assassin <a href="Lee%20Harvey%20Oswald">Lee Harvey Oswald</a>. He and <a href="Earl%20Warren">Earl Warren</a> also interviewed <a href="Jack%20Ruby">Jack Ruby</a>, Oswald's killer. According to a 1963 <a href="FBI">FBI</a> memo that was released to the public in 2008, Ford was in contact with the FBI throughout his time on the Warren Commission and relayed information to the deputy director, <a href="Cartha%20DeLoach">Cartha DeLoach</a>, about the panel's activities. In the preface to his book, "A Presidential Legacy and The Warren Commission", Ford defended the work of the commission and reiterated his support of its conclusions.

In 1964, Lyndon Johnson led a landslide victory for his party, secured another term as president and took 36 seats from Republicans in the House of Representatives. Following the election, members of the Republican caucus looked to select a new Minority Leader. Three members approached Ford to see if he would be willing to serve; after consulting with his family, he agreed. After a closely contested election, Ford was chosen to replace <a href="Charles%20Halleck">Charles Halleck</a> of <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> as Minority Leader.

With a Democratic majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the Johnson Administration proposed and passed a series of programs that was called by Johnson the "<a href="Great%20Society">Great Society</a>." During the first session of the <a href="89th%20United%20States%20Congress">Eighty-ninth Congress</a> alone, the Johnson Administration submitted 87 bills to Congress, and Johnson signed 84, or 96%, arguably the most successful legislative agenda in Congressional history.

In 1966, criticism over the Johnson Administration's handling of the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201966">1966 midterm elections</a> produced a 47-seat swing in favor of the Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.

Ford's private criticism of the Vietnam War became public knowledge after he spoke from the floor of the House and questioned whether the White House had a clear plan to bring the war to a successful conclusion. The speech angered President Johnson, who accused Ford of having played "too much football without a helmet".

As Minority Leader in the House, Ford appeared in a popular series of televised press conferences with <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> Senator <a href="Everett%20Dirksen">Everett Dirksen</a>, in which they proposed Republican alternatives to Johnson's policies. Many in the press jokingly called this "The Ev and Jerry Show." Johnson said at the time, "Jerry Ford is so dumb he can't fart and chew gum at the same time." The press, used to sanitizing Johnson's salty language, reported this as "Gerald Ford can't walk and chew gum at the same time."

After <a href="Presidency%20of%20Richard%20Nixon">Nixon</a> was elected President in November 1968, Ford's role shifted to being an advocate for the White House agenda. Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the <a href="National%20Environmental%20Policy%20Act">National Environmental Policy Act</a> and the <a href="Tax%20Reform%20Act%20of%201969">Tax Reform Act of 1969</a>. Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a <a href="Revenue%20Sharing">Revenue Sharing</a> program for state and local governments. Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through Congress, and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against).

During the eight years (1965–1973) that Ford served as Minority Leader, he won many friends in the House because of his fair leadership and inoffensive personality.

To become House Speaker, Ford worked to help Republicans across the country get a majority in the chamber, often traveling on the <a href="rubber%20chicken%20circuit">rubber chicken circuit</a>. After a decade of failing to do so, he promised his wife that he would try again in 1974 then retire in 1976. On October 10, 1973, Vice President <a href="Spiro%20Agnew">Spiro Agnew</a> resigned and then pleaded <a href="Nolo%20contendere">no contest</a> to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering, part of a negotiated resolution to a scheme in which he accepted $29,500 in bribes while governor of Maryland. According to "The New York Times", Nixon "sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement." The advice was unanimous. "We gave Nixon no choice but Ford," <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House Speaker</a> <a href="Carl%20Albert">Carl Albert</a> recalled later. Ford agreed to the nomination, telling his wife that the Vice Presidency would be "a nice conclusion" to his career.

Ford was nominated to take Agnew's position on October 12, the first time the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the <a href="25th%20Amendment">25th Amendment</a> had been implemented. The <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27. Only three Senators, all Democrats, voted against Ford's confirmation: <a href="Gaylord%20Nelson">Gaylord Nelson</a> of <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Eagleton">Thomas Eagleton</a> of <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> and <a href="William%20Hathaway">William Hathaway</a> of <a href="Maine">Maine</a>. On December 6, 1973, the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35. One hour after the confirmation vote in the House, Ford took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States.

Ford became Vice President as the <a href="Watergate%20scandal">Watergate scandal</a> was unfolding. On Thursday, August 1, 1974, <a href="White%20House%20Chief%20of%20Staff">Chief of Staff</a> <a href="Alexander%20Haig">Alexander Haig</a> contacted Ford to tell him that "<a href="smoking%20gun">smoking gun</a>" evidence had been found. This evidence was an Oval Office tape-recording of Nixon discussing a plan to impede the FBI's investigation by falsely claiming the break-in was a CIA operation. The tape left little doubt that President Nixon had been a part of the Watergate cover-up.

At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly designated <a href="Number%20One%20Observatory%20Circle">vice president's residence</a> in Washington, D.C. However, "Al Haig asked to come over and see me," Ford later said, "to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said, 'I'm just warning you that you've got to be prepared, that things might change dramatically and you could become President.' And I said, 'Betty, I don't think we're ever going to live in the vice president's house.

When Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, Ford automatically assumed the presidency. This made him the only person to become the nation's chief executive without having been previously voted into either the presidential or vice presidential office by the <a href="United%20States%20Electoral%20College">Electoral College</a>. Immediately after Ford took the oath of office in the <a href="East%20Room%20%28White%20House%29">East Room</a> of the White House, he spoke to the assembled audience in a speech that was broadcast live to the nation. Ford noted the peculiarity of his position: "I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots, and so I ask you to confirm me as your president with your prayers." He went on to state:

He also stated:
A portion of the speech would later be memorialized with a plaque at the entrance to <a href="Gerald%20R.%20Ford%20Presidential%20Museum">his presidential museum</a>.

On August 20, Ford nominated former New York Governor <a href="Nelson%20Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a> to fill the vice presidency he had vacated. Rockefeller's top competitor had been <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>. Rockefeller underwent extended hearings before Congress, which caused embarrassment when it was revealed he made large gifts to senior aides, such as <a href="Henry%20Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a>. Although conservative Republicans were not pleased that Rockefeller was picked, most of them voted for his confirmation, and his nomination passed both the House and Senate. Some, including <a href="Barry%20Goldwater">Barry Goldwater</a>, voted against him.

On September 8, 1974, Ford issued , which gave Nixon a full and unconditional <a href="pardon">pardon</a> for any crimes he might have committed against the United States while president. In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interests of the country, and that the Nixon family's situation "is a tragedy in which we all have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must."

Ford's decision to pardon Nixon was highly controversial. Critics derided the move and said a "<a href="corrupt%20bargain">corrupt bargain</a>" had been struck between the men. They said that Ford's pardon was granted in exchange for Nixon's resignation, which had elevated Ford to the presidency. Ford's first press secretary and close friend <a href="Jerald%20terHorst">Jerald terHorst</a> resigned his post in protest after the pardon. According to <a href="Bob%20Woodward">Bob Woodward</a>, Nixon Chief of Staff Alexander Haig proposed a pardon deal to Ford. He later decided to pardon Nixon for other reasons, primarily the friendship he and Nixon shared. Regardless, historians believe the controversy was one of the major reasons Ford lost the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201976">1976 presidential election</a>, an observation with which Ford agreed. In an editorial at the time, "The New York Times" stated that the Nixon pardon was a "profoundly unwise, divisive and unjust act" that in a stroke had destroyed the new president's "credibility as a man of judgment, candor and competence". On October 17, 1974, Ford testified before Congress on the pardon. He was the first sitting president since <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> to testify before the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>.

In the months following the pardon, Ford often declined to mention President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Nixon</a> by name, referring to him in public as "my predecessor" or "the former president." When, on a 1974 trip to California, White House correspondent <a href="Fred%20Barnes%20%28journalist%29">Fred Barnes</a> pressed Ford on the matter, Ford replied in a surprisingly frank manner: "I just can’t bring myself to do it."

After Ford left the White House in January 1977, he privately justified his pardon of Nixon by carrying in his wallet a portion of the text of "<a href="Burdick%20v.%20United%20States">Burdick v. United States</a>", a 1915 <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt. In 2001, the <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20Library">John F. Kennedy Library</a> Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy <a href="Profile%20in%20Courage%20Award">Profile in Courage Award</a> to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator <a href="Edward%20Kennedy">Edward Kennedy</a> said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.

On September 16 (shortly after he pardoned Nixon), Ford issued Presidential Proclamation 4313, which introduced a conditional <a href="amnesty">amnesty</a> program for military deserters and Vietnam War <a href="draft%20dodger">draft dodger</a>s who had fled to countries such as Canada. The conditions of the amnesty required that those reaffirm their allegiance to the United States and serve two years working in a public service job or a total of two years service for those who had served less than two years of honorable service in the military. The program for the Return of Vietnam Era Draft Evaders and Military Deserters established a Clemency Board to review the records and make recommendations for receiving a Presidential Pardon and a change in <a href="Military%20discharge">Military discharge</a> status. Full pardon for draft dodgers came in the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Jimmy%20Carter">Carter administration</a>.

When Ford assumed office, he inherited Nixon's <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20States">Cabinet</a>. During his brief administration, he replaced all members except <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> Kissinger and <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a> <a href="William%20E.%20Simon">William E. Simon</a>. Political commentators have referred to Ford's dramatic reorganization of his Cabinet in the fall of 1975 as the "<a href="Halloween%20Massacre">Halloween Massacre</a>". One of Ford's appointees, <a href="William%20Thaddeus%20Coleman%20Jr.">William Coleman</a>—the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Transportation">Secretary of Transportation</a>—was the second black man to serve in a presidential cabinet (after <a href="Robert%20C.%20Weaver">Robert C. Weaver</a>) and the first appointed in a Republican administration.

Ford selected George H. W. Bush as <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20China%23List%20of%20chiefs%20of%20the%20U.S.%20Liaison%20Office%20in%20Beijing">Chief of the US Liaison Office</a> to the People's Republic of China in 1974, and then <a href="Director%20of%20Central%20Intelligence">Director</a> of the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> in late 1975.

Ford's transition chairman and first Chief of Staff was former congressman and ambassador <a href="Donald%20Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a>. In 1975, Rumsfeld was named by Ford as the youngest-ever <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">Secretary of Defense</a>. Ford chose a young <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> politician, <a href="Dick%20Cheney">Richard Cheney</a>, to replace Rumsfeld as his new Chief of Staff; Cheney became the <a href="campaign%20manager">campaign manager</a> for Ford's <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201976">1976 presidential campaign</a>.

The 1974 Congressional midterm elections took place in the wake of the Watergate scandal and less than three months after Ford assumed office. The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201974">House elections</a>, taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats. This was one more than the number needed (290) for a two-thirds majority, the number necessary to override a Presidential veto or to propose a constitutional amendment. Perhaps due in part to this fact, the <a href="94th%20United%20States%20Congress">94th Congress</a> overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> was President of the United States (1865–1869). Even Ford's former, reliably Republican House seat was won by a Democrat, <a href="Richard%20Vander%20Veen">Richard Vander Veen</a>, who defeated <a href="Robert%20VanderLaan">Robert VanderLaan</a>. In the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20elections%2C%201974">Senate elections</a>, the Democratic majority became 61 in the 100-seat body.

The <a href="Economy%20of%20the%20United%20States">economy</a> was a great concern during the Ford administration. One of the first acts the new president took to deal with the economy was to create, by <a href="Executive%20Order%20%28United%20States%29">Executive Order</a> on September 30, 1974, the Economic Policy Board. In October 1974, in response to rising inflation, Ford went before the American public and asked them to "Whip Inflation Now". As part of this program, he urged people to wear "<a href="Whip%20Inflation%20Now">WIN</a>" buttons. At the time, inflation was believed to be the primary threat to the economy, more so than growing unemployment; there was a belief that controlling inflation would help reduce unemployment. To rein in inflation, it was necessary to control the public's spending. To try to mesh service and sacrifice, "WIN" called for Americans to reduce their spending and consumption. On October 4, 1974, Ford gave a speech in front of a joint session of Congress; as a part of this speech he kicked off the "WIN" campaign. Over the next nine days 101,240 Americans mailed in "WIN" pledges. In hindsight, this was viewed as simply a <a href="public%20relations">public relations</a> gimmick which had no way of solving the underlying problems. The main point of that speech was to introduce to Congress a one-year, five-percent income tax increase on corporations and wealthy individuals. This plan would also take $4.4 billion out of the budget, bringing federal spending below $300 billion. At the time, inflation was over twelve percent.

The federal budget ran a <a href="Government%20budget%20deficit">deficit</a> every year Ford was President. Despite his reservations about how the program ultimately would be funded in an era of tight <a href="public%20budgeting">public budgeting</a>, Ford signed the <a href="Education%20for%20All%20Handicapped%20Children%20Act">Education for All Handicapped Children Act</a> of 1975, which established <a href="special%20education">special education</a> throughout the United States. Ford expressed "strong support for full educational opportunities for our handicapped children" according to the official White House press release for the bill signing.

The economic focus began to change as the country sank into the worst <a href="1973%E2%80%9375%20recession">recession</a> since the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> four decades earlier. The focus of the Ford administration turned to stopping the rise in unemployment, which reached nine percent in May 1975. In January 1975, Ford proposed a 1-year tax reduction of $16 billion to stimulate economic growth, along with spending cuts to avoid inflation. Ford was criticized greatly for quickly switching from advocating a tax increase to a tax reduction. In Congress, the proposed amount of the tax reduction increased to $22.8 billion in tax cuts and lacked spending cuts. In March 1975, Congress passed, and Ford signed into law, these <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a> rebates as part of the <a href="Tax%20Reduction%20Act%20of%201975">Tax Reduction Act of 1975</a>. This resulted in a federal deficit of around $53 billion for the 1975 fiscal year and $73.7 billion for 1976.

When New York City faced bankruptcy in 1975, <a href="List%20of%20mayors%20of%20New%20York%20City">Mayor</a> <a href="Abraham%20Beame">Abraham Beame</a> was unsuccessful in obtaining Ford's support for a federal bailout. The incident prompted the New York "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">Daily News</a>" famous headline "Ford to City: Drop Dead", referring to a speech in which "Ford declared flatly ... that he would veto any bill calling for 'a federal bail-out of New York City.

Ford was confronted with a potential <a href="swine%20flu">swine flu</a> <a href="pandemic">pandemic</a>. In the early 1970s, an <a href="influenza">influenza</a> strain <a href="H1N1">H1N1</a> shifted from a form of flu that affected primarily pigs and crossed over to humans. On February 5, 1976, an <a href="United%20States%20Army">army</a> recruit at <a href="Fort%20Dix">Fort Dix</a> mysteriously died and four fellow soldiers were hospitalized; <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">health officials</a> announced that "swine flu" was the cause. Soon after, public health officials in the Ford administration urged that every person in the United States be <a href="vaccination">vaccinated</a>. Although the vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems, some 25% of the population was vaccinated by the time the program was canceled in December 1976.

Ford was an outspoken supporter of the <a href="Equal%20Rights%20Amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</a>, issuing Presidential Proclamation no. 4383 in 1975:
As president, Ford's position on abortion was that he supported "a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the 50 States to make the choice". This had also been his position as House Minority Leader in response to the 1973 Supreme Court case of "<a href="Roe%20v.%20Wade">Roe v. Wade</a>", which he opposed. Ford came under criticism for a "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>" interview his wife Betty gave in 1975, in which she stated that "Roe v. Wade" was a "great, great decision". During his later life, Ford would identify as <a href="pro-choice">pro-choice</a>.

Ford continued the détente policy with both the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and China, easing the tensions of the Cold War. Still in place from the Nixon administration was the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT). The thawing relationship brought about by <a href="1972%20Nixon%20visit%20to%20China">Nixon's visit to China</a> was reinforced by Ford's own visit in December 1975. The Administration entered into the Helsinki Accords with the Soviet Union in 1975, creating the framework of the <a href="Helsinki%20Watch">Helsinki Watch</a>, an independent non-governmental organization created to monitor compliance which later evolved into <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a>.

Ford attended the inaugural meeting of the <a href="Group%20of%20Eight">Group of Seven</a> (G7) industrialized nations (initially the G5) in 1975 and secured membership for Canada. Ford supported international solutions to issues. "We live in an interdependent world and, therefore, must work together to resolve common economic problems," he said in a 1974 speech.

According to internal White House and Commission documents posted in February 2016 by the National Security Archive at The George Washington University, the Gerald Ford White House significantly altered the final report of the supposedly independent 1975 Rockefeller Commission investigating CIA domestic activities, over the objections of senior Commission staff. The changes included removal of an entire 86-page section on CIA assassination plots and numerous edits to the report by then-deputy White House Chief of Staff <a href="Richard%20Cheney">Richard Cheney</a>.

In the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean, two ongoing international disputes developed into crises. The <a href="Cyprus%20dispute%23Peacemaking%20efforts%2C%201964%E2%80%931974">Cyprus dispute</a> turned into a crisis with the <a href="Turkish%20invasion%20of%20Cyprus">Turkish invasion of Cyprus</a> in July 1974, causing extreme strain within the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Treaty%20Organization">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) alliance. In mid-August, the <a href="Greek%20military%20junta%20of%201967%E2%80%9374">Greek government</a> withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey. Ford, concerned with both the effect of this on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO's eastern front, vetoed the bill. A second bill was then passed by Congress, which Ford also vetoed, although a compromise was accepted to continue aid until the end of the year. As Ford expected, Turkish relations were <a href="United%20States-Turkey%20relations%23Invasion%20of%20Cyprus">considerably disrupted until 1978</a>.

In the continuing <a href="Arab%E2%80%93Israeli%20conflict">Arab–Israeli conflict</a>, although the initial <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20338">cease fire</a> had been implemented to end active conflict in the <a href="Yom%20Kippur%20War">Yom Kippur War</a>, Kissinger's continuing <a href="shuttle%20diplomacy">shuttle diplomacy</a> was showing little progress. Ford considered it "stalling" and wrote, "Their [Israeli] tactics frustrated the Egyptians and made me mad as hell." During Kissinger's shuttle to Israel in early March 1975, a last minute reversal to consider further withdrawal, prompted a cable from Ford to Prime Minister <a href="Yitzhak%20Rabin">Yitzhak Rabin</a>, which included:
On March 24, Ford informed congressional leaders of both parties of the reassessment of the administration policies in the Middle East. "Reassessment", in practical terms, meant canceling or suspending further aid to Israel. For six months between March and September 1975, the United States refused to conclude any new arms agreements with Israel. Rabin notes it was "an innocent-sounding term that heralded one of the worst periods in American-Israeli relations". The announced reassessments upset the American Jewish community and Israel's well-wishers in Congress. On May 21, Ford "experienced a real shock" when seventy-six U.S. senators wrote him a letter urging him to be "responsive" to Israel's request for $2.59 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) in military and economic aid. Ford felt truly annoyed and thought the chance for peace was jeopardized. It was, since the September 1974 ban on arms to Turkey, the second major congressional intrusion upon the President's foreign policy prerogatives. The following summer months were described by Ford as an American-Israeli "war of nerves" or "test of wills". After much bargaining, the <a href="Sinai%20Interim%20Agreement">Sinai Interim Agreement</a> (Sinai II) was formally signed on September 1, and aid resumed.

One of Ford's greatest challenges was dealing with the continuing <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Accords">Paris Peace Accords</a>, signed on January 27, 1973. The accords declared a cease fire across both North and South Vietnam, and required the release of American <a href="POW">prisoners of war</a>. The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281954%29">Geneva Conference</a> of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South. The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces.

The accords had been negotiated by <a href="United%20States%20National%20Security%20Advisor">United States National Security Advisor</a> Kissinger and North Vietnamese <a href="politburo">politburo</a> member <a href="L%C3%AA%20%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c%20Th%E1%BB%8D">Lê Đức Thọ</a>. South Vietnamese President <a href="Nguyen%20Van%20Thieu">Nguyen Van Thieu</a> was not involved in the final negotiations, and publicly criticized the proposed agreement. However, anti-war pressures within the United States forced Nixon and Kissinger to pressure Thieu to sign the agreement and enable the withdrawal of American forces. In multiple letters to the South Vietnamese president, Nixon had promised that the United States would defend Thieu's government, should the North Vietnamese violate the accords.

In December 1974, months after Ford took office, North Vietnamese forces invaded the province of <a href="Phuoc%20Long%20Province">Phuoc Long</a>. General <a href="Tr%E1%BA%A7n%20V%C4%83n%20Tr%C3%A0">Trần Văn Trà</a> sought to gauge any South Vietnamese or American response to the invasion, as well as to solve logistical issues, before proceeding with the invasion.

As North Vietnamese forces advanced, Ford requested Congress approve a $722 million aid package for South Vietnam, funds that had been promised by the Nixon administration. Congress voted against the proposal by a wide margin. Senator <a href="Jacob%20K.%20Javits">Jacob K. Javits</a> offered "...large sums for evacuation, but not one nickel for military aid". President Thieu resigned on April 21, 1975, publicly blaming the lack of support from the United States for the fall of his country. Two days later, on April 23, Ford gave a speech at <a href="Tulane%20University">Tulane University</a>. In that speech, he announced that the Vietnam War was over "...as far as America is concerned". The announcement was met with thunderous applause.

1,373 U.S. citizens and 5,595 <a href="Vietnamese%20people">Vietnamese</a> and third country nationals were evacuated from the South Vietnamese capital of <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a> during <a href="Operation%20Frequent%20Wind">Operation Frequent Wind</a>. In that operation, military and <a href="Air%20America%20%28airline%29">Air America</a> helicopters took evacuees to <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> ships off-shore during an approximately 24-hour period on April 29 to 30, 1975, immediately preceding the <a href="fall%20of%20Saigon">fall of Saigon</a>. During the operation, so many South Vietnamese helicopters landed on the vessels taking the evacuees that some were pushed overboard to make room for more people. Other helicopters, having nowhere to land, were deliberately crash landed into the sea after dropping off their passengers, close to the ships, their pilots bailing out at the last moment to be picked up by rescue boats.

Many of the Vietnamese evacuees were allowed to enter the United States under the <a href="Indochina%20Migration%20and%20Refugee%20Assistance%20Act">Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act</a>. The 1975 Act appropriated $455 million toward the costs of assisting the settlement of Indochinese refugees. In all, 130,000 Vietnamese refugees came to the United States in 1975. Thousands more escaped in the years that followed.

North Vietnam's victory over the South led to a considerable shift in the political winds in Asia, and Ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of U.S. influence there. The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its interests in the region on two occasions, once when <a href="Khmer%20Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> forces seized an American ship in <a href="international%20waters">international waters</a> and again when American military officers were killed in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.

The first crisis was the <a href="Mayaguez%20incident">Mayaguez incident</a>. In May 1975, shortly after the fall of Saigon and the Khmer Rouge conquest of <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, Cambodians seized the American merchant ship "Mayaguez" in international waters. Ford dispatched <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marines</a> to rescue the crew, but the Marines landed on the wrong island and met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as, unknown to the U.S., the "Mayaguez" sailors were being released. In the operation, two military transport helicopters carrying the Marines for the assault operation were shot down, and 41 U.S. servicemen were killed and 50 wounded, while approximately 60 Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed. Despite the American losses, the operation was seen as a success in the United States, and Ford enjoyed an 11-point boost in his approval ratings in the aftermath. The Americans killed during the operation became the last to have their names inscribed on the <a href="Vietnam%20Veterans%20Memorial">Vietnam Veterans Memorial</a> wall in Washington, D.C.

Some historians have argued that the Ford administration felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a Soviet plot. But work by Andrew Gawthorpe, published in 2009, based on an analysis of the administration's internal discussions, shows that Ford's national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local, and perhaps even accidental, provocation by an immature Khmer government. Nevertheless, they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia.

The second crisis, known as the <a href="axe%20murder%20incident">axe murder incident</a>, occurred at <a href="Panmunjom">Panmunjom</a>, a village which stands in the DMZ between the two Koreas. Encouraged by U.S. difficulties in Vietnam, North Korea had been waging a campaign of diplomatic pressure and minor military harassment to try to convince the U.S. to withdraw from South Korea. Then, in August 1976, North Korean forces killed two U.S. officers and injured South Korean guards who were engaged in trimming a tree in Panmunjom's <a href="Joint%20Security%20Area">Joint Security Area</a>. The attack coincided with a meeting of the Conference of <a href="Non-Aligned%20Nations">Non-Aligned Nations</a> in <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a>, Sri Lanka, at which <a href="Kim%20Jong-il">Kim Jong-il</a>, the son of North Korean leader <a href="Kim%20Il-sung">Kim Il-sung</a>, presented the incident as an example of American aggression, helping secure the passage of a motion calling for a U.S. withdrawal from the South.

At administration meetings, Kissinger voiced the concern that the North would see the U.S. as "the paper tigers of Saigon" if they did not respond, and Ford agreed with that assessment. After mulling various options the Ford administration decided that it was necessary to respond with a major <a href="show%20of%20force">show of force</a>. A large number of ground forces went to cut down the tree, while at the same time the air force was deployed, which included <a href="Boeing%20B-52%20Stratofortress">B-52 bomber</a> flights over Panmunjom. The North Korean government backed down and allowed the tree-cutting to go ahead, and later issued an unprecedented official apology.

<a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a> (now Timor-Leste) declared independence in 1975 after the <a href="Carnation%20Revolution">Carnation Revolution</a> in Portugal, but Indonesia moved to annex the new state. Just hours before <a href="Indonesian%20invasion%20of%20East%20Timor">Indonesia invaded</a> on December 7, 1975, Ford and Kissinger had visited Indonesian President <a href="Suharto">Suharto</a> in Jakarta and guaranteed American compliance with the Indonesian operation. Suharto had been a key supporter of American influence in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, and Ford did not desire to place pressure on the American-Indonesian relationship.

Under Ford, a policy of arms sales to the Suharto regime began in 1975, before the invasion. "Roughly 90%" of the Indonesian army's weapons at the time of the invasion were provided by the U.S., according to George H. Aldrich, a former State Department deputy legal advisor. Post-invasion, Ford's military aid averaged about $30 million annually throughout the <a href="Indonesian%20occupation%20of%20East%20Timor">occupation of East Timor</a>, and arms sales increased exponentially under President Carter. This policy continued until 1999.

Ford was the target of two assassination attempts during his presidency. In <a href="Sacramento%2C%20California">Sacramento, California</a>, on September 5, 1975, <a href="Lynette%20Fromme">Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme</a>, a follower of <a href="Charles%20Manson">Charles Manson</a>, pointed a <a href="M1911%20Colt%20pistol">Colt .45-caliber handgun</a> at Ford and pulled the trigger at <a href="point-blank%20range">point-blank range</a>. As she did, <a href="Larry%20Buendorf">Larry Buendorf</a>, a Secret Service agent, grabbed the gun, and Fromme was taken into custody. She was later convicted of attempted assassination of the President and was sentenced to life in prison; she was paroled on August 14, 2009, after serving 34 years.

In reaction to this attempt, the Secret Service began keeping Ford at a more secure distance from anonymous crowds, a strategy that may have saved his life seventeen days later. As he left the <a href="St.%20Francis%20Hotel">St. Francis Hotel</a> in downtown San Francisco, <a href="Sara%20Jane%20Moore">Sara Jane Moore</a>, standing in a crowd of onlookers across the street, fired a <a href=".38%20Special">.38-caliber revolver</a> at him. The shot missed Ford by a few feet. Before she fired a second round, retired Marine <a href="Oliver%20Sipple">Oliver Sipple</a> grabbed at the gun and deflected her shot; the bullet struck a wall about six inches above and to the right of Ford's head, then ricocheted and hit a taxi driver, who was slightly wounded. Moore was later sentenced to life in prison. She was paroled on December 31, 2007, after serving 32 years.

In 1975, Ford appointed <a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens">John Paul Stevens</a> as <a href="Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States</a> to replace retiring Justice <a href="William%20O.%20Douglas">William O. Douglas</a>. Stevens had been a judge of the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Seventh%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a>, appointed by President Nixon. During his tenure as House Republican leader, Ford had led efforts to have Douglas impeached. After being confirmed, Stevens eventually disappointed some conservatives by siding with the Court's liberal wing regarding the outcome of many key issues. Nevertheless, in 2005 Ford praised Stevens. "He has served his nation well," Ford said of Stevens, "with dignity, intellect and without partisan political concerns."

Ford appointed 11 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 50 judges to the <a href="United%20States%20district%20court">United States district court</a>s.

Ford reluctantly agreed to run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a challenge for the Republican party nomination. Former <a href="Governor%20of%20California">Governor of California</a> <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> and the party's <a href="American%20conservatism">conservative</a> wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the <a href="Torrijos%E2%80%93Carter%20Treaties">Torrijos–Carter Treaties</a>.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20primary">primaries</a>, including <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, and <a href="California">California</a>, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the <a href="1976%20Republican%20National%20Convention">Republican Convention</a> in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more <a href="American%20liberalism">liberal</a> Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. Senator <a href="Bob%20Dole">Bob Dole</a> of <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>.

In addition to the pardon dispute and lingering anti-Republican sentiment, Ford had to counter a plethora of negative media imagery. <a href="Chevy%20Chase">Chevy Chase</a> often did <a href="Physical%20comedy">pratfalls</a> on "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>", imitating Ford, who had been seen stumbling on two occasions during his term. As Chase commented, "He even mentioned in his own autobiography it had an effect over a period of time that affected the election to some degree."

Ford's 1976 election campaign benefitted from his being an incumbent president during several anniversary events held during the period leading up to the <a href="United%20States%20Bicentennial">United States Bicentennial</a>. The Washington, D.C. <a href="fireworks">fireworks</a> display on the <a href="Fourth%20of%20July">Fourth of July</a> was presided over by the President and televised nationally. On July 7, 1976, the President and First Lady served as hosts at a White House state dinner for <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> and <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip</a> of the United Kingdom, which was televised on the <a href="PBS">Public Broadcasting Service</a> network. The 200th anniversary of the <a href="Battles%20of%20Lexington%20and%20Concord">Battles of Lexington and Concord</a> in Massachusetts gave Ford the opportunity to deliver a speech to 110,000 in Concord acknowledging the need for a strong national defense tempered with a plea for "reconciliation, not recrimination" and "reconstruction, not rancor" between the United States and those who would pose "threats to peace". Speaking in New Hampshire on the previous day, Ford condemned the growing trend toward big government bureaucracy and argued for a return to "basic American virtues".

Democratic nominee and former <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Georgia">governor</a> <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> campaigned as an outsider and reformer, gaining support from voters dismayed by the <a href="Watergate%20scandal">Watergate scandal</a> and Nixon pardon. After the Democratic National Convention, he held a huge 33-point lead over Ford in the polls. However, as the campaign continued, the race tightened, and, by election day, the polls showed the race as too close to call. There were three main events in the fall campaign. Most importantly, Carter repeated a promise of a "blanket pardon" for Christian and other religious refugees, and also all Vietnam War draft dodgers (Ford had only issued a conditional amnesty) in response to a question on the subject posed by a reporter during the presidential debates, an act which froze Ford's poll numbers in Ohio, Wisconsin, Hawaii, and Mississippi. (Ford had needed to shift just 11,000 votes in Ohio plus one of the other three in order to win.) It was the first act signed by Carter, on January 20, 1977. Earlier, "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>" magazine had published a controversial interview with Carter; in the interview Carter admitted to having "lusted in my heart" for women other than his wife, which cut into his support among women and evangelical Christians. Also, on September 24, Ford performed well in what was the first televised <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%20debates">presidential debate</a> since <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201960">1960</a>. Polls taken after the debate showed that most viewers felt that Ford was the winner. Carter was also hurt by Ford's charges that he lacked the necessary experience to be an effective national leader, and that Carter was vague on many issues.

Televised <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%20debates">presidential debates</a> were reintroduced for the first time since the 1960 election. As such, Ford became the first incumbent president to participate in one. Carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates, saying they "gave the viewers reason to think that Jimmy Carter had something to offer". The turning point came in the second debate when Ford blundered by stating, "There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford Administration." Ford also said that he did not "believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union". In an interview years later, Ford said he had intended to imply that the Soviets would never crush the "spirits" of eastern Europeans seeking independence. However, the phrasing was so awkward that questioner <a href="Max%20Frankel">Max Frankel</a> was visibly incredulous at the response.

In the end, Carter won the election, receiving 50.1% of the popular vote and 297 <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">electoral votes</a> compared with 48.0% and 240 electoral votes for Ford.

The Nixon pardon controversy eventually subsided. Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, opened his 1977 <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20inauguration">inaugural address</a> by praising the outgoing President, saying, "For myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land."

After leaving the White House, the Fords moved to Denver, Colorado. Ford successfully invested in oil with <a href="Marvin%20Davis">Marvin Davis</a>, which later provided an income for Ford's children.

He continued to make appearances at events of historical and ceremonial significance to the nation, such as presidential inaugurals and memorial services. In January 1977, he became the president of <a href="Eisenhower%20Fellowships">Eisenhower Fellowships</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, then served as the chairman of its board of trustees from 1980 to 1986. Later in 1977, he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by James M. Naughton, a "New York Times" journalist who was given the assignment to write the former President's advance obituary, an article that would be updated prior to its eventual publication. In 1979, Ford published his autobiography, "A Time to Heal" (Harper/Reader's Digest, 454 pages). A review in "Foreign Affairs" described it as, "Serene, unruffled, unpretentious, like the author. This is the shortest and most honest of recent presidential memoirs, but there are no surprises, no deep probings of motives or events. No more here than meets the eye."

During the term of office of his successor, Jimmy Carter, Ford received monthly briefs by President Carter's senior staff on international and domestic issues, and was always invited to lunch at the White House whenever he was in Washington, D.C. Their close friendship developed after Carter had left office, with the catalyst being their trip together to the funeral of <a href="Anwar%20el-Sadat">Anwar el-Sadat</a> in 1981. Until Ford's death, Carter and his wife, <a href="Rosalynn%20Carter">Rosalynn</a>, visited the Fords' home frequently. Ford and Carter served as honorary co-chairs of the <a href="National%20Commission%20on%20Federal%20Election%20Reform">National Commission on Federal Election Reform</a> in 2001 and of the <a href="Continuity%20of%20Government%20Commission">Continuity of Government Commission</a> in 2002.

Like Presidents Carter, <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>, and <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, Ford was an honorary co-chair of the <a href="Council%20for%20Excellence%20in%20Government">Council for Excellence in Government</a>, a group dedicated to excellence in government performance, which provides leadership training to top federal employees. He also devoted much time to his love of golf, often playing both privately and in public events with comedian <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a>, a longtime friend. In 1977, he shot a <a href="hole%20in%20one">hole in one</a> during a Pro-am held in conjunction with the <a href="Danny%20Thomas%20Memphis%20Classic">Danny Thomas Memphis Classic</a> at <a href="Colonial%20Country%20Club%20%28Memphis%29">Colonial Country Club</a> in <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>. He hosted the <a href="Jerry%20Ford%20Invitational">Jerry Ford Invitational</a> in <a href="Vail%2C%20Colorado">Vail, Colorado</a> from 1977 to 1996.

In 1977, Ford established the Gerald R. Ford Institute of Public Policy at <a href="Albion%20College">Albion College</a> in <a href="Albion%2C%20Michigan">Albion, Michigan</a>, to give undergraduates training in public policy. In April 1981, he opened the <a href="Gerald%20R.%20Ford%20Library">Gerald R. Ford Library</a> in <a href="Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor, Michigan</a>, on the north campus of his alma mater, the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, followed in September by the <a href="Gerald%20R.%20Ford%20Museum">Gerald R. Ford Museum</a> in Grand Rapids.

Ford considered a run for the Republican nomination in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201980">1980</a>, forgoing numerous opportunities to serve on corporate boards to keep his options open for a rematch with Carter. Ford attacked Carter's conduct of the SALT II negotiations and foreign policy in the Middle East and Africa. Many have argued that Ford also wanted to exorcise his image as an "Accidental President" and to win a term in his own right. Ford also believed the more conservative Ronald Reagan would be unable to defeat Carter and would hand the incumbent a second term. Ford was encouraged by his former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger as well as <a href="Jim%20Rhodes">Jim Rhodes</a> of Ohio and <a href="Bill%20Clements">Bill Clements</a> of Texas to make the race. On March 15, 1980, Ford announced that he would forgo a run for the Republican nomination, vowing to support the eventual nominee.

After securing the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan considered his former rival Ford as a potential vice-presidential running mate, but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the <a href="1980%20Republican%20National%20Convention">Republican National Convention</a> were unsuccessful. Ford conditioned his acceptance on Reagan's agreement to an unprecedented "co-presidency", giving Ford the power to control key executive branch appointments (such as Kissinger as Secretary of State and <a href="Alan%20Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a> as Treasury Secretary). After rejecting these terms, Reagan offered the vice-presidential nomination instead to George H. W. Bush. Ford did appear in a campaign commercial for the Reagan-Bush ticket, in which he declared that the country would be "better served by a Reagan presidency rather than a continuation of the weak and politically expedient policies of Jimmy Carter". On October 8, 1980, Ford said former President Nixon's involvement in the general election potentially could negatively impact the Reagan campaign: "I think it would have been much more helpful if Mr. Nixon had stayed in the background during this campaign. It would have been much more beneficial to Ronald Reagan."

On October 3, 1980, Ford cast blame on Carter for the latter's charges of ineffectiveness on the part of the <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20Board">Federal Reserve Board</a> due to his appointing of most of its members: "President Carter, when the going gets tough, will do anything to save his own political skin. This latest action by the president is cowardly."

Following the <a href="attempted%20assassination%20of%20Ronald%20Reagan">attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan</a>, Ford told reporters while appearing at a fundraiser for <a href="Thomas%20Kean">Thomas Kean</a> that criminals who use firearms should get the death penalty in the event someone is injured with the weapon.

In September 1981, Ford advised Reagan against succumbing to <a href="Wall%20Street">Wall Street</a> demands and follow his own agenda for the economic policies of the US during an appearance on "<a href="Good%20Morning%20America">Good Morning America</a>": "He shouldn't let the gurus of Wall Street decide what the economic future of this country is going to be. They are wrong in my opinion." On October 20, 1981, Ford stated stopping the Reagan administration's Saudi arms package could have a large negative impact to American relations in the Middle East during a news conference.

On March 24, 1982, Ford offered an endorsement of President Reagan's economic policies while also stating the possibility of Reagan being met with a stalemate by Congress if not willing to compromise while in Washington.

Ford founded the annual <a href="AEI%20World%20Forum">AEI World Forum</a> in 1982, and joined the <a href="American%20Enterprise%20Institute">American Enterprise Institute</a> as a distinguished fellow. He was also awarded an <a href="List%20of%20recipients%20of%20honorary%20degrees%20from%20Central%20Connecticut%20State%20University">honorary doctorate at Central Connecticut State University</a> on March 23, 1988.

During an August 1982 fundraising reception, Ford stated his opposition to a constitution amendment requiring the US to have a balanced budget, citing a need to elect "members of the House and Senate who will immediately when Congress convenes act more responsibly in fiscal matters." Ford was a participant in the 1982 midterm elections, traveling to <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> in October of that year to help Republican candidates.

In January 1984, a letter signed by Ford and Carter and urging world leaders to extend their failed effort to end world hunger was released and sent to <a href="Secretary-General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">Secretary-General of the United Nations</a> <a href="Javier%20P%C3%A9rez%20de%20Cu%C3%A9llar">Javier Pérez de Cuéllar</a>.

In 1987, Ford testified before the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> in favor of <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia%20Circuit">District of Columbia Circuit Court</a> judge and former <a href="Solicitor%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Solicitor General</a> <a href="Robert%20Bork">Robert Bork</a> after Bork was <a href="Robert%20Bork%20Supreme%20Court%20nomination">nominated</a> by President Reagan to be an <a href="Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court</a>. Bork's nomination was rejected by a vote of 58-42.

In 1987 Ford's "Humor and the Presidency", a book of humorous political anecdotes, was published.

By 1988, Ford was a member of several corporate boards including Commercial Credit, Nova Pharmaceutical, The Pullman Company, Tesoro Petroleum, and Tiger International, Inc. Ford also became an honorary director of <a href="Citigroup">Citigroup</a>, a position he held until his death.

In October 1990, Ford appeared in <a href="Gettysburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Gettysburg, Pennsylvania</a> with <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a> to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the birth of former President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, where the two unveiled a plaque with the signatures of each living former president.

In April 1991, Ford joined former presidents <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, and <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>, in supporting the <a href="Brady%20Bill">Brady Bill</a>. Three years later, he wrote to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>, along with Carter and Reagan, in support of the <a href="Federal%20Assault%20Weapons%20Ban">assault weapons ban</a>.

At the <a href="1992%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1992 Republican National Convention</a>, Ford compared the election cycle to his 1976 loss to Carter and urged attention be paid to electing a Republican Congress: "If it's change you want on Nov. 3, my friends, the place to start is not at the White House but in the United States' Capitol. Congress, as every school child knows, has the power of the purse. For nearly 40 years, Democratic majorities have held to the time-tested New Deal formula, tax and tax, spend and spend, elect and elect."

In April 1997, Ford joined President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, former President Bush, and <a href="Nancy%20Reagan">Nancy Reagan</a> in signing the "Summit Declaration of Commitment" in advocating for participation by private citizens in solving domestic issues within the United States.

On January 20, 1998, during an interview at his Palm Springs home, Ford said the Republican Party's nominee in the 2000 presidential election would lose if very conservative in their ideals: "If we get way over on the hard right of the political spectrum, we will not elect a Republican President. I worry about the party going down this ultra-conservative line. We ought to learn from the Democrats: when they were running ultra-liberal candidates, they didn't win."

In the prelude to the impeachment of President Clinton, Ford conferred with former President Carter and the two agreed to not speak publicly on the controversy, a pact broken by Carter when answering a question from a student at <a href="Emory%20University">Emory University</a>.

In October 2001, Ford broke with conservative members of the Republican Party by stating that gay and lesbian couples "ought to be treated equally. Period." He became the highest ranking Republican to embrace full equality for gays and lesbians, stating his belief that there should be a federal amendment outlawing anti-gay job discrimination and expressing his hope that the Republican Party would reach out to gay and lesbian voters. He also was a member of the Republican Unity Coalition, which "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described as "a group of prominent Republicans, including former President Gerald R. Ford, dedicated to making sexual orientation a non-issue in the Republican Party".

On November 22, 2004, New York Republican Governor <a href="George%20Pataki">George Pataki</a> named Ford and the other living former Presidents (Carter, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton) as honorary members of the board rebuilding the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20site">World Trade Center</a>.

In a pre-recorded <a href="news%20embargo">embargoed interview</a> with <a href="Bob%20Woodward">Bob Woodward</a> of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" in July 2004, Ford stated that he disagreed "very strongly" with the Bush administration's choice of Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction as justification for its decision to <a href="Iraq%20War">invade Iraq</a>, calling it a "big mistake" unrelated to the national security of the United States and indicating that he would not have gone to war had he been President. The details of the interview were not released until after Ford's death, as he requested.

On April 4, 1990, Ford was admitted to <a href="Eisenhower%20Medical%20Center">Eisenhower Medical Center</a> for surgery to replace his left knee, orthopedic surgeon Dr. Robert Murphy saying "Ford's entire left knee was replaced with an artificial joint, including portions of the adjacent femur, or thigh bone, and tibia, or leg bone."

Ford suffered two minor strokes at the <a href="2000%20Republican%20National%20Convention">2000 Republican National Convention</a>, but made a quick recovery after being admitted to <a href="Hahnemann%20University%20Hospital">Hahnemann University Hospital</a>. In January 2006, he spent 11 days at the <a href="Eisenhower%20Medical%20Center">Eisenhower Medical Center</a> near his residence at <a href="Rancho%20Mirage%2C%20California">Rancho Mirage, California</a>, for treatment of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. On April 23, 2006, President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> visited Ford at his home in Rancho Mirage for a little over an hour. This was Ford's last public appearance and produced the last known public photos, video footage, and voice recording.

While vacationing in <a href="Vail%2C%20Colorado">Vail, Colorado</a>, Ford was hospitalized for two days in July 2006 for shortness of breath. On August 15 he was admitted to St. Mary's Hospital of the <a href="Mayo%20Clinic">Mayo Clinic</a> in <a href="Rochester%2C%20Minnesota">Rochester, Minnesota</a>, for testing and evaluation. On August 21, it was reported that he had been fitted with a <a href="artificial%20pacemaker">pacemaker</a>. On August 25, he underwent an <a href="angioplasty">angioplasty</a> procedure at the Mayo Clinic. On August 28, Ford was released from the hospital and returned with his wife Betty to their California home. On October 13, he was scheduled to attend the dedication of a building of his namesake, the <a href="Gerald%20R.%20Ford%20School%20of%20Public%20Policy">Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy</a> at the University of Michigan, but due to poor health and on the advice of his doctors he did not attend. The previous day, Ford had entered the Eisenhower Medical Center for undisclosed tests; he was released on October 16. By November 2006, he was confined to a bed in his study.

Ford Passed away on December 26, 2006, at his home in <a href="Rancho%20Mirage%2C%20California">Rancho Mirage, California</a>, of arteriosclerotic <a href="cerebrovascular%20disease">cerebrovascular disease</a> and diffuse <a href="arteriosclerosis">arteriosclerosis</a>. He had end-stage coronary artery disease and severe <a href="aortic%20stenosis">aortic stenosis</a> and insufficiency, caused by calcific alteration of one of his heart valves. He was 93. Ford died on the 34th anniversary of President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>'s death; he was the last surviving member of the <a href="Warren%20Commission">Warren Commission</a>.

On December 30, 2006, Ford became the 11th U.S. President to <a href="Lying%20in%20state%23United%20States">lie in state</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol%20rotunda">Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol</a>. A state funeral and memorial services was held at the <a href="National%20Cathedral">National Cathedral</a> in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, January 2, 2007. After the service, Ford was interred at his <a href="Gerald%20R.%20Ford%20Presidential%20Museum">Presidential Museum</a> in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Scouting was so important to Ford that his family asked for Scouts to participate in his funeral. A few selected Scouts served as ushers inside the National Cathedral. About 400 Eagle Scouts were part of the funeral procession, where they formed an honor guard as the casket went by in front of the museum.

Ford selected the song to be played during his funeral procession at the U.S. Capitol. After his death in December 2006, the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20Marching%20Band">University of Michigan Marching Band</a> played the school's fight song for him one final time, for his last ride from the <a href="Gerald%20R.%20Ford%20Airport">Gerald R. Ford Airport</a> in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

The State of Michigan commissioned and submitted a <a href="Gerald%20R.%20Ford%20%28Grill%29">statue of Ford</a> to the <a href="National%20Statuary%20Hall%20Collection">National Statuary Hall Collection</a>, replacing <a href="Zachariah%20Chandler">Zachariah Chandler</a>. It was unveiled on May 3, 2011 in the Capitol Rotunda. On the proper right side is inscribed a quotation from a tribute by <a href="Tip%20O%27Neill">Tip O'Neill</a>, Speaker of the House at the end of Ford's presidency: "God has been good to America, especially during difficult times. At the time of the Civil War, he gave us Abraham Lincoln. And at the time of Watergate, he gave us Gerald Ford—the right man at the right time who was able to put our nation back together again." On the proper left side are words from Ford's swearing-in address: "Our constitution works. Our great republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule."

Ford's wife, Betty Ford, died on July 8, 2011. Like her husband, she was 93 years old when she died.

On November 12, 2006, Ford surpassed the 93 years and 120 days lifespan of Ronald Reagan (who died on June 5, 2004), thus becoming the <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Presidents%20by%20age">longest-lived president</a> in American history. He marked the occasion with the following statement (his last public statement):

At the time of his own death on December 26, 2006, Ford was 93 years and 165 days old.

Ford was the only person to hold the presidential office without being elected as either president or vice president. The choice of Ford to fulfill <a href="Spiro%20Agnew">Spiro Agnew</a>'s vacated role as vice president was based on Ford's reputation for openness and honesty. "In all the years I sat in the House, I never knew Mr. Ford to make a dishonest statement nor a statement part-true and part-false. He never attempted to shade a statement, and I never heard him utter an unkind word," said <a href="Martha%20Griffiths">Martha Griffiths</a>.

The trust the American people had in him was rapidly and severely tarnished by his pardon of Nixon. Nonetheless, many grant in hindsight that he had respectably discharged with considerable dignity a great responsibility that he had not sought. 

In spite of his athletic record and remarkable career accomplishments, Ford acquired a reputation as a clumsy, likable, and simple-minded <a href="Everyman">Everyman</a>. An incident in 1975, when he tripped while exiting Air Force One in Austria, was famously and repeatedly parodied by <a href="Chevy%20Chase">Chevy Chase</a>, cementing Ford's image as a klutz. Pieces of Ford's common Everyman image have also been attributed to Ford's inevitable comparison to Nixon, as well as his perceived Midwestern stodginess and self-deprecation.
Ford was a member of several civic organizations, including the <a href="United%20States%20Junior%20Chamber">Junior Chamber of Commerce</a> (Jaycees), <a href="American%20Legion">American Legion</a>, <a href="AMVETS">AMVETS</a>, <a href="Benevolent%20and%20Protective%20Order%20of%20Elks">Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks</a>, <a href="Sons%20of%20the%20Revolution">Sons of the Revolution</a>, and <a href="Veterans%20of%20Foreign%20Wars">Veterans of Foreign Wars</a>.

Ford was initiated into <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> on September 30, 1949. He later said in 1975, "When I took my obligation as a master mason—incidentally, with my three younger brothers—I recalled the value my own father attached to that order. But I had no idea that I would ever be added to the company of the Father of our Country and 12 other members of the order who also served as Presidents of the United States." Ford was made a 33° Scottish Rite Mason on September 26, 1962. In April 1975, Ford was elected by a unanimous vote Honorary Grand Master of the International Supreme Council, Order of DeMolay, a position in which he served until January 1977. Ford received the degrees of York Rite Masonry (Chapter and Council degrees) in a special ceremony in the Oval Office on January 11, 1977, during his term as President of the United States.

Ford received the <a href="Distinguished%20Eagle%20Scout%20Award">Distinguished Eagle Scout Award</a> in May 1970, as well as the <a href="Silver%20Buffalo%20Award">Silver Buffalo Award</a>, from the Boy Scouts of America. In 1974, he also received the highest distinction of the <a href="Scout%20Association%20of%20Japan">Scout Association of Japan</a>, the <a href="Golden%20Pheasant%20Award">Golden Pheasant Award</a>. In 1985, he received the 1985 <a href="Old%20Tom%20Morris%20Award">Old Tom Morris Award</a> from the <a href="Golf%20Course%20Superintendents%20Association%20of%20America">Golf Course Superintendents Association of America</a>, GCSAA's highest honor. In 1992, the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation awarded Ford its Lone Sailor Award for his naval service and his subsequent government service. In 1999, Ford was honored with a Golden Palm Star on the <a href="Palm%20Springs%20Walk%20of%20Stars">Palm Springs Walk of Stars</a>. Also in 1999, Ford was awarded the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> by Bill Clinton. In 2001, he was presented with the John F. Kennedy <a href="Profiles%20in%20Courage%20Award">Profiles in Courage Award</a> for his decision to pardon Richard Nixon to stop the agony America was experiencing over Watergate.

The following were named after Ford:

Army of Sambre and Meuse

The Army of Sambre and Meuse () was one of the armies of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>. It was formed on 29 June 1794 by combining the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Ardennes">Army of the Ardennes</a>, the left wing of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Moselle">Army of the Moselle</a> and the right wing of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20North%20%28France%29">Army of the North</a>. Its maximum paper strength was approximately 83,000.

After an inconclusive campaign in <a href="Rhine%20Campaign%20of%201795">1795</a>, the French planned a co-ordinated offensive in <a href="Rhine%20Campaign%20of%201796">1796</a> using <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Jourdan">Jean-Baptiste Jourdan</a>'s Army of the Sambre et Meuse and the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Rhine%20and%20Moselle">Army of the Rhine and Moselle</a> commanded by his superior, <a href="Jean%20Victor%20Moreau">Jean Victor Moreau</a>. The first part of the operation called for Jourdan to cross the Rhine north of Mannheim and divert the Austrians while the Army of the Moselle crossed the southern Rhine at <a href="Kehl">Kehl</a> and <a href="Huningen">Huningen</a>. This was successful and, by July 1796, a series of victories forced the Austrians, commanded by <a href="Archduke%20Charles">Archduke Charles</a> to retreat into the German states. By late July, most of the southern German states had been coerced into an armistice. The Army of Sambre and Meuse maneuvered around northern Bavaria and Franconia, and the Army of the Rhine and Moselle operated in Bavaria.

Internal disputes between Moreau and Jourdan and with Jourdan's subordinate commanders within the Army of the Sambre and Meuse prevented the two armies from uniting. This gave the Austrian commander time to reform his own forces, driving Jourdan to the northwest. By the end of September 1796, Charles had permanently separated the two French armies, forcing Jourdan's command further northwest and eventually across the Rhine. On 29 September 1797, the Army of Sambre and Meuse merged with the Army of the Rhine and Moselle to become the <a href="Army%20of%20Germany%20%281797%29">Army of Germany</a>.

Initially, the rulers of Europe viewed the <a href="French%20Revolution">1789 revolution</a> in France as an internal matter between the French king and his subjects. In 1790, <a href="Leopold%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Leopold</a> succeeded his brother <a href="Joseph%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Joseph</a> as emperor of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>; by 1791, the danger to his sister, <a href="Marie%20Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a> and her children, alarmed him. In August 1791, in consultation with French "émigré" nobles and <a href="Frederick%20William%20II%20of%20Prussia">Frederick William II</a> of Prussia, Leopold's <a href="Declaration%20of%20Pillnitz">Declaration of Pillnitz</a> articulated that the interests of the monarchs of Europe were as one with the interests of Louis and his family. He and his fellow monarchs threatened unspecified consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. French "<a href="%C3%A9migr%C3%A9s">émigrés</a>" continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution, and on 20 April 1792 the <a href="French%20National%20Convention">French National Convention</a> declared war on Austria. In this <a href="War%20of%20the%20First%20Coalition">War of the First Coalition</a> (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing its land or water borders, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire.

Although initially successful in the campaigns of 1792 and 1793, the French army lost some effectiveness during the <a href="Reign%20of%20Terror">Reign of Terror</a>, during which its generals were intimidated or executed and many of the army's experienced officers left France for safer havens. Elements of the armies that were later formed into the Army of Sambre and Meuse participated in the conquest of the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and the <a href="Siege%20of%20Luxembourg%20%281794%E2%80%9395%29">Siege of Luxembourg</a>. The various elements of the army won a victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fleurus%20%281794%29">Battle of Fleurus</a> on 16 June 1794. The merging of the forces into the Army of Sambre and Meuse was made official soon afterwards. Shortly after Fleurus, the position of the <a href="First%20Coalition">First Coalition</a> in Flanders collapsed and the French armies overran the <a href="Austrian%20Netherlands">Austrian Netherlands</a> and the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a> in the winter of 1794–1795. French and Coalition military strategy subsequently focused on the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> river as the principle line of defense: for each side, control of the opposite bank or at least, the river's principal crossings, was the basis of defensive strategy.

The Rhine River flows west along the border between the German states and the <a href="Cantons%20of%20Switzerland">Swiss Cantons</a>. The stretch between <a href="Rheinfall">Rheinfall</a>, by <a href="Schaffhausen">Schaffhausen</a> and Basel, is the <a href="High%20Rhine">High Rhine</a> ("Hochrhein"); it cuts through steep hillsides over a gravel bed, and moves in torrents in such paces as the former rapids at <a href="Laufenburg%2C%20Aargau">Laufenburg</a>. A few miles north and east of Basel, the terrain flattens. The Rhine makes a wide, northerly turn, in what is called the <a href="Rhine%20knee">Rhine knee</a>, and enters the so-called Rhine ditch ("Rheingraben"), part of a <a href="rift%20valley">rift valley</a> bordered by the Black Forest on the east and <a href="Vosges">Vosges</a> mountains on the west.

The Rhine looked different in the 1790s than it does in the twenty-first century; the passage from Basel to <a href="Iffezheim">Iffezheim</a> was "corrected" (straightened) between 1817 and 1875. Construction of a canal to control the water level occurred from 1927 to 1974. In 1790, the river was wild and unpredictable, in some places more than four times wider than in the twenty-first century, even under normal conditions. Its channels wound through marsh and meadow and created islands of trees and vegetation that were periodically submerged by floods. Systems of <a href="viaduct">viaduct</a>s and <a href="causeway">causeway</a>s made access reliable at <a href="Kehl">Kehl</a>, by <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>, and at <a href="H%C3%BCningen">Hüningen</a>, by <a href="Basel">Basel</a>. In 1796, the plain on both sides of the river, some wide, was dotted with villages and farms. At the furthest edges of the flood plain, especially on the eastern side, the old mountains created dark shadows on the horizon. Tributaries cut through the hilly terrain of the <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a>, creating deep <a href="Defile%20%28geography%29">defiles</a> in the mountains, and became rivulets through the flood plain to the river.

The German-speaking states on the east bank of the Rhine were part of the vast complex of territories in <a href="central%20Europe">central Europe</a> called the Holy Roman Empire. The number of territories in the Empire included <a href="List%20of%20states%20in%20the%20Holy%20Roman%20Empire">more than 1,000 entities</a>. Their size and influence varied, from the "<a href="Kleinstaaterei">Kleinstaaten</a>" (little states) that covered no more than a few square miles to large and powerful states. The states and territories involved in late 1796 included the Breisgau (Habsburg), Offenburg and Rottweil (imperial cities), the princely states of <a href="F%C3%BCrstenberg-F%C3%BCrstenberg">Fürstenberg</a>, Neuenburg and Hohenzollern, the <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Baden">Margraviate of Baden</a>, the <a href="Duchy%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Duchy of Württemberg</a>, and several dozen ecclesiastic polities. Rule varied: they included <a href="free%20imperial%20city">free imperial cities</a> of different sizes, such as the powerful <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a> and the minuscule <a href="Weil%20der%20Stadt">Weil der Stadt</a>; ecclesiastical territories, also of varying sizes and influence, such as the wealthy <a href="Abbey%20of%20Reichenau">Abbey of Reichenau</a> and the powerful <a href="Archbishopric%20of%20Cologne">Archbishopric of Cologne</a>; and such dynastic states as Württemberg. When viewed on a map, the Empire resembled a "Flickenteppich" (<a href="Patchwork">patchwork carpet</a>). Some states included non-contiguous pieces, the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg</a> domains and <a href="Hohenzollern">Hohenzollern</a> Prussia also governed territories outside the Empire, such as the Habsburg territories in eastern Europe and northern Italy; for others, a village could belong predominantly to one polity but have a farmstead, a house or even one or two strips of land that belonged to another polity. There were also territories surrounded by France that belonged to Württemberg, such as the county of Solm, the archbishopric of Trier and Hesse-Darmstadt. Among the German-speaking states, the Holy Roman Empire's administrative and legal mechanisms provided a venue to resolve disputes between peasants and landlords, between and within jurisdictions. Through the organization of <a href="Imperial%20Circles">Imperial Circles</a> ("Reichskreise"), groups of states consolidated resources and promoted regional and organizational interests, including economic cooperation and military protection.

By 1792 the armies of the <a href="French%20Republic">French Republic</a> were in a state of disruption; experienced soldiers of the "<a href="Ancien%20R%C3%A9gime">Ancien Régime</a>" fought side by side with volunteers. Recruits, urged on by revolutionary fervor from the <a href="Repr%C3%A9sentant%20en%20mission">special representatives</a>—agents of the legislature, sent to ensure cooperation among the military—lacked the discipline and training to function efficiently; frequently insubordinate, they often refused orders and undermined unit cohesion. After a defeat, they were capable of mutiny, as <a href="Th%C3%A9obald%20Dillon">Théobald Dillon</a> learned when his troops lynched him in 1792.

The problems of command became more acute following the 1793 introduction of mass conscription ("<a href="Lev%C3%A9e%20en%20Masse">levée en masse</a>"). French commanders walked a fine line between the security of the frontier and the Parisian clamor for victory. Add to this the desperate condition of the Army—in training, supplies and leadership—and the military leadership faced a crisis. They were constantly under suspicion from the representatives of the new regime and sometimes from their own soldiers. Failure to achieve unrealistic expectations implied disloyalty and the price of disloyalty was an appointment with "Madame <a href="guillotine">guillotine</a>": several of the highest ranking generals, including the aged <a href="Nicolas%20Luckner">Nicolas Luckner</a>, <a href="Jean%20Nicolas%20Houchard">Jean Nicolas Houchard</a>, <a href="Adam%20Philippe%20Custine">Adam Philippe Custine</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Dillon%20%281750%E2%80%931794%29">Arthur Dillon</a> and <a href="Antoine%20Nicolas%20Collier">Antoine Nicolas Collier</a>, were killed. <a href="Francisco%20de%20Miranda">Francisco de Miranda</a>'s failure to take <a href="Maastricht">Maastricht</a> landed him in <a href="La%20Force%20Prison">La Force Prison</a> for several years. Many of the old officer class had emigrated, forming <a href="Arm%C3%A9e%20des%20%C3%89migr%C3%A9s">émigré</a> armies; the cavalry in particular suffered from their departure and the "Hussards du Saxe" and the "15éme Cavalerie (Royal Allemande)" regiments defected "en masse" to the Austrians. The artillery arm, considered by the old nobility to be an inferior assignment, was less affected by emigration and survived intact.

Military planners in Paris understood that the <a href="Upper%20Rhine">upper Rhine Valley</a>, the south-western German territories and <a href="Danube">Danube</a> river basin held strategic importance for the defense of the Republic. The Rhine offered a formidable barrier to what the French perceived as Austrian aggression and the state that controlled its crossings controlled the river and access into the territories on either side. Ready access across the Rhine and along the Rhine bank between the German states and Switzerland or through the Black Forest, gave access to the upper Danube river valley. For the French, control of the Upper Danube or any point in between, was of immense strategic value and would give the French a reliable approach to <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>.

The basic unit of the army, the <a href="demi-brigade">demi-brigade</a>, mixed the men of the old army with the recruits from the "levee en masse." Ideally, it was designed to include the regular infantry inherited from the old Royal regiments of the King, who were relatively well trained and equipped, dressed in white uniforms and wearing <a href="tarleton%20helmet">tarleton helmet</a>s, with the <a href="National%20Guard%20%28France%29">national guard</a> units, who were less well-trained or equipped, with blue uniforms, and the "fédéré" volunteer battalions, who were poorly trained and equipped, with no uniform other than a red <a href="phrygian%20cap">phrygian cap</a> and a <a href="tricolour%20cockade">tricolour cockade</a>. In 1794, the right flank of the <a href="Arm%C3%A9e%20du%20Centre">Armies of the Center</a>, later called the <a href="Arm%C3%A9e%20de%20Moselle">Army of the Moselle</a>, the entirety of the Armies of the <a href="Arm%C3%A9e%20du%20Nord">North</a> and the <a href="Arm%C3%A9e%20des%20Ardennes">Ardennes</a> formed the Army of the Sambre and Meuse, on 29 June 1794. The remaining units of the former Army of the Center and the <a href="Arm%C3%A9e%20du%20Rhin">Army of the Rhine</a> united initially on 29 November 1794 and formally on 20 April 1795, under command of General <a href="Jean-Charles%20Pichegru">Jean-Charles Pichegru</a> as the Army of the Rhine and Moselle. These were the French armies involved in the successes at Fleurus and the Lowlands, but the strength of the units had been enhanced by untrained conscripts.

Pressures exerted by the Coalition forces on the French front at the Rhine required the movement of the Army of Sambre and Meuse troops from the <a href="Fortress%20of%20Luxembourg">Fortress of Luxembourg</a>, Belgium and the Netherlands into a unit on the middle Rhine. These units were reorganized into task forces that wcould engage the Austrian and Coalition forces directly in the Rhineland. Its paper strength equaled close to 83,000 men, although its actual strength was considerably less. By 1 October 1795, some of the troops had been assembled in five locations to form an advanced guard of 63,615, men commanded by the veteran General of Division <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Joseph%20Lefebvre">François Joseph Lefebvre</a>. General <a href="Louis%20Friant">Louis Friant</a>'s division of 3,296 men remained at the Luxembourg fortress and General <a href="Antoine%20Morlot">Antoine Morlot</a>'s division of 3,471 remained in Aachen.










In 1795 the French sent the Army of the Sambre and Meuse, also called the northern army, and the Army of the Rhine and Moselle, sometimes called the southern army, in thrusts across the Rhine. After winning a bridgehead on the east bank, the northern French army under Jourdan advanced south to the <a href="Main%20%28river%29">Main River</a>. On 8 September 1795, Jourdan's northern army crossed the Rhine north of <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>. Besieging the Bavarian garrison in Düsseldorf, the rest of the Army of Sambre and Meuse swept south as far as the <a href="Lahn%20River">Lahn River</a>, by 20 September. Hemmed in by Lefebvre and 12,600 French troops, Count Hompesch surrendered the Bavarian garrison at Düsseldorf on 21 September.

Threatened by Jourdan's incursion, the Habsburg commander, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20S%C3%A9bastien%20Charles%20Joseph%20de%20Croix%2C%20Count%20of%20Clerfayt">François Sébastien Charles Joseph de Croix, Count of Clerfayt</a>, shifted his army north to oppose him. This movement gave Pichegru the opportunity to move his army against the weakened rear guard of Clerfayt's force. Despite having a sizable garrison force, Baron von Belderbusch turned over <a href="Mannheim">Mannheim</a> and its 471 guns to the Army of Rhine and Moselle after negotiations. The Austrians were furious at their ally but could do nothing to prevent the French from gaining this valuable bridgehead. Pichegru, the commander of the southern French army, proved uncooperative, which allowed Clerfayt to maneuver the bulk of the Austrian forces against Jourdan. Clerfayt crossed the Main to the east, gaining a dangerously exposed position on the French left flank. After being repulsed at <a href="H%C3%B6chst%20%28Frankfurt%20am%20Main%29">Höchst</a>, the French withdrew northwards, eventually abandoning the east bank of the Rhine.

The campaign of 1796 was part of the French Revolutionary Wars in which republican France pitted itself against a fluid coalition of Prussians and Austrians and several other states of the Holy Roman Empire, the British, <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>ns, Dutch and royalist French emigres. The French had won several victories but the campaigns of 1793 through 1795 had been less successful. The Coalition partners had difficulty coordinating their war aims and their efforts faltered. In 1794 and 1795, French victories in northern Italy salvaged French enthusiasm for the war and forced the Coalition to withdraw further into Central Europe. At the end of the Rhine Campaign of 1795, the <a href="Habsburg%20Austria">Habsburg Austria</a>n Coalition and the <a href="French%20First%20Republic">French Republicans</a> called a truce between their forces that had been fighting in Germany. The agreement lasted until 20 May 1796, when the Austrians announced that the truce would end on 31 May.

The Austrian Army of the Lower Rhine included 90,000 Habsburg and Imperial troops. The 20,000-man right wing, first under <a href="Duke%20Ferdinand%20Frederick%20Augustus%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg</a>, then later under <a href="Wilhelm%20von%20Wartensleben">Wilhelm von Wartensleben</a>, stood on the east bank of the Rhine behind the <a href="Sieg">Sieg</a> River, observing the French bridgehead at Düsseldorf. The garrisons of <a href="Mainz%20Fortress">Mainz Fortress</a> and <a href="Ehrenbreitstein%20Fortress">Ehrenbreitstein Fortress</a> included 10,000 more. The remainder of the Imperial and Coalition army, the 80,000-strong Army of the Upper Rhine, secured the west bank behind the <a href="Nahe%20%28Rhine%29">Nahe River</a>. Commanded by <a href="Dagobert%20Sigmund%20von%20Wurmser">Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser</a>, this force anchored its right wing in <a href="Kaiserslautern">Kaiserslautern</a> on the west bank, while the left wing under <a href="Anton%20Szt%C3%A1ray">Anton Sztáray</a>, <a href="Michael%20von%20Fr%C3%B6hlich">Michael von Fröhlich</a> and <a href="Louis%20Joseph%2C%20Prince%20of%20Cond%C3%A9">Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé</a> guarded the Rhine from Mannheim to <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. The original Austrian strategy was to capture <a href="Trier">Trier</a> and to use their position on the west bank to strike at each of the French armies in turn. After news arrived in Vienna of <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>'s successes in northern Italy, Wurmser was sent to there with 25,000 reinforcements and the <a href="Aulic%20Council">Aulic Council</a> gave <a href="Archduke%20Charles%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teschen">Archduke Charles</a> command over both Austrian armies in the Rhineland and ordered him to hold his ground.

Two French armies opposed the Imperial and Coalition troops. <a href="Jean%20Victor%20Moreau">Jean Victor Moreau</a>'s commanded both armies, but the northern army, Sambre and Moselle, was large enough for a sub command: Jourdan. The 80,000-man Army of Sambre and Meuse held the west bank of the Rhine down to the Nahe and then southwest to <a href="Sankt%20Wendel">Sankt Wendel</a>. On the army's left flank, <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Kl%C3%A9ber">Jean Baptiste Kléber</a> had 22,000 troops in an entrenched camp at Düsseldorf. The <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Rhine%20and%20Moselle">Army of the Rhine and Moselle</a>, directly commanded by Moreau, was positioned behind (west of) the Rhine from Hüningen, where <a href="Pierre%20Marie%20Barth%C3%A9lemy%20Ferino">Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino</a> commanded the furthest right wing, northward, along the <a href="Queich">Queich</a> River near <a href="Landau">Landau</a>, and with its left wing extended west toward <a href="Saarbr%C3%BCcken">Saarbrücken</a>. The far right wing under.

The French plan called for a spring (April–May–June) offensive, during which two French armies would press against the flanks of the Coalition's northern armies in the German states and a third army approached Vienna through Italy. Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's army would push south from Düsseldorf, hopefully drawing troops toward themselves, while Moreau's army massed on the east side of the Rhine by Mannheim; a deft feint toward Mannheim caused Charles to reposition his troops. Once this occurred, Moreau's army executed a forced march south and, on 23 June, overwhelmed the bridgehead at Kehl. The Imperial troops there included only 7,000 troops recruited that spring from the <a href="Swabian%20Circle">Swabian Circle</a> polities; despite their lack of experience and training, they held the bridgehead for several hours before retreating toward <a href="Rastatt">Rastatt</a>. Moreau reinforced the bridgehead with his forward guard and his troops poured into Baden unhindered. In the south, by the Swiss city of Basel, Ferino's column moved quickly across the river and advanced (eastward) up the Rhine along the Swiss and German shoreline toward Lake Constance, spreading into the southern end of the Black Forest. Worried that his supply lines would be overextended or his army would be flanked, Charles retreated to the east. By the end of July, the entirety of the Swabian Circle, most of Bavaria, Franconia, Baden and Wuerttemberg had reached a separate peace with the French. which disarmed the Imperial army, and gave French free rein to demand supplies from the southern polities.

With Charles absent from the north, Jourdan recrossed the Rhine and drove Wartensleben behind the Lahn river. The Army of Sambre and Meuse defeated its opponents in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Friedberg%20%28Hessen%29">Battle of Friedberg</a> (also called the First Battle of Limburg) on 10 July, while Charles was busy at Ettlingen. Jourdan captured <a href="Frankfurt%20am%20Main">Frankfurt am Main</a> on 16 July. Leaving behind <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20S%C3%A9verin%20Marceau-Desgraviers">François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers</a> with 28,000 troops to blockade Mainz and Ehrenbreitstein, Jourdan pressed up the Main River. Following Carnot's strategy, the French commander continually operated against Wartensleben's north flank, causing the Austrian general to fall back. Jourdan's army numbered over 46,000 men, while Wartensleben counted 36,000 troops; Wartensleben refused to attack the larger French force. Buoyed up by their forward movement and by the capture of Austrian supplies, the French captured <a href="W%C3%BCrzburg">Würzburg</a> on 4 August. Three days later, the Army of Sambre and Meuse, under the temporary direction of Kléber, won another clash with Wartensleben at <a href="Forchheim">Forchheim</a> on 7 August. Despite this success, though, the two French armies remained separated.
Archduke Charles saw that if he could unite with Wartenbsleben, he could pick off the French armies in succession. Having sufficient reinforcements and having transferred his supply line from Vienna to <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>, he moved north to unite with Wartensleben. With 25,000 of his best troops, Charles crossed to the north bank of the Danube at <a href="Regensburg">Regensburg</a>. On 22 August 1796, Charles and <a href="Friedrich%20Joseph%2C%20Count%20of%20Nauendorf">Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf</a>, encountered Bernadotte's division at Neumarkt. The outnumbered French were driven north west through <a href="Altdorf%20bei%20N%C3%BCrnberg">Altdorf bei Nürnberg</a> to the <a href="Pegnitz%20%28river%29">Pegnitz River</a>. Leaving <a href="Friedrich%20Freiherr%20von%20Hotze">Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze</a> with a division to pursue Bernadotte, the Archduke thrust north at Jourdan's right flank. The French fell back to <a href="Amberg">Amberg</a> as Charles and Wartensleben's forces converged on the Army of Sambre and Meuse. On 20 August, Moreau sent Jourdan a message vowing to closely follow Charles, which he did not do. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Amberg">Battle of Amberg</a> on 24 August, Charles defeated the French and destroyed two battalions of their rear guard. The Austrians lost 400 killed and wounded out of 40,000 troops. Of a total of 34,000 soldiers, the French suffered greater losses of 1,200 killed and wounded plus 800 men and two colors captured. Jourdan retreated first to Sulzbach and then behind the <a href="Wiesent%20%28Regnitz%29">Regnitz river</a> where Bernadotte joined him on 28 August. Hotze and his Habsburg troops reoccupied <a href="N%C3%BCrnberg">Nürnberg</a> and Jourdan, who had expected Moreau to keep Charles occupied in the south, found himself outnumbered.
As Jourdan fell back to <a href="Schweinfurt">Schweinfurt</a>, he saw a chance to retrieve his campaign by offering battle at Würzburg, an important stronghold on the Main River. At this point, the petty jealousies and rivalries that had fostered in the Army over the summer came to a head. Jourdan had a spat with his wing commander Kléber and that officer suddenly resigned his command. Two generals from Kléber's clique, Bernadotte and Colaud, also made excuses to leave the army immediately. Faced with this mutiny, Jourdan replaced Bernadotte with General <a href="Henri%20Simon%20%281764%E2%80%931826%29">Henri Simon</a> and divided Colaud's rebellious units among the other divisions. Jourdan marched south with 30,000 men of the infantry divisions of Simon, <a href="Jean%20%C3%89tienne%20Championnet">Jean Étienne Championnet</a>, <a href="Paul%20Grenier">Paul Grenier</a> and with <a href="Jacques%20Philippe%20Bonnaud">Jacques Philippe Bonnaud</a>'s reserve cavalry. Lefebvre's division, 10,000-strong, remained at Schweinfurt to cover a possible retreat.

Anticipating Jourdan's move, Charles had already rushed his army toward Würzburg, where they engaged on 1 September. Marshaling the divisions of Hotze, Sztáray, Kray, <a href="Johann%20Sigismund%20Riesch">Johann Sigismund Riesch</a>, <a href="Johann%20I%20Joseph%2C%20Prince%20of%20Liechtenstein">Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein</a> and Wartensleben, the Austrians won the <a href="Battle%20of%20W%C3%BCrzburg">Battle of Würzburg</a> on 3 September, forcing the French to retreat to the Lahn river. Charles lost 1,500 casualties out of 44,000 troops against 2,000 French casualties. The losses at Würzburg compelled the French to lift the siege of Mainz on 7 September and to move those troops to reinforce their lines further east. On 10 September, Marceau reinforced the Army of Sambre and Meuse with 12,000 troops that had been blockading the east side of Mainz. <a href="Jean%20Hardy">Jean Hardy</a>'s division from the west side of Mainz retreated to the Nahe river and dug in. The French government belatedly recognized the difficulties in which the Army of the Sambre and Meuse struggled and transferred two divisions commanded by <a href="Jacques%20MacDonald">Jacques MacDonald</a> and <a href="Jean%20Castelbert%20de%20Castelverd">Jean Castelbert de Castelverd</a> from the idle <a href="Army%20of%20the%20North%20%28France%29">Army of the North</a>. MacDonald's division stopped at Düsseldorf while Castelverd's was placed in the French line on the lower Lahn. These reinforcements brought Jourdan's strength back to 50,000 but the French abandonment of the sieges at Mainz and later Mannheim and <a href="Philippsburg">Philippsburg</a>, released about 27,000 Habsburg troops to reinforce Charles' now overwhelming numbers. Moreau continued in the south to press toward Vienna, seemingly oblivious to Jourdan's situation.

Over the next few days, most of the Army of Sambre and Meuse returned to the west bank of the Rhine, except for a small rear guard. After his disastrous panic at Diez in which he prematurely abandoned a critical bridge position, Jean Castelbert de Castelverd held east bank entrenchments at Neuwied, Poncet crossed at <a href="Bonn">Bonn</a> while the other divisions retired behind the Sieg river. Jourdan handed over command to <a href="Pierre%20de%20Ruel%2C%20marquis%20de%20Beurnonville">Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville</a>, on 22 September. Charles left 32,000 to 36,000 troops commanded by <a href="Franz%20von%20Werneck">Franz von Werneck</a> in the north, 9,000 more in Mainz and Mannheim to insure the Army did not recross the Rhine, and moved south with 16,000 men to intercept Moreau.

Archduke Charles ruined the French strategy in the north; the Army of Sambre and Meuse withdrew across the river and remained inactive for the rest of the year. On 18 April 1797, with Napoleon's army threatening Vienna, Austria and France agreed to terms of an <a href="Peace%20of%20Leoben">armistice</a>, which was followed by five months of negotiation, leading to the <a href="Peace%20of%20Campo%20Formio">Peace of Campo Formio</a> which concluded the War of the First Coalition on 18 October 1797. The peace treaty was to be followed up by the <a href="Second%20Congress%20of%20Rastatt">Congress of Rastatt</a>. Campo Formio's terms held until 1798, when both groups recovered their military strength and began the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Second%20Coalition">War of the Second Coalition</a>. Despite the renewal of military action, the Congress continued its meetings in Rastatt until the assassination of the French delegation in April 1799. The Army of Sambre and Meuse remained in cantonment until 29 September 1797, when it was united with other units, to form the <a href="Army%20of%20Germany%20%281797%29">Army of Germany</a>.

Global warming

Global warming is a long-term rise in the average temperature of the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s <a href="climate">climate system</a>, an aspect of <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a> shown by <a href="temperature%20measurement">temperature measurement</a>s and by multiple effects of the warming. The term commonly refers to the mainly human-caused observed warming since pre-industrial times and its projected continuation, though there were also much earlier periods of global warming. In the modern context the terms "global warming" and "climate change" are commonly used interchangeably, but "climate change" includes both "global warming" and its effects, such as changes to precipitation and impacts that differ by region. Many of the observed warming changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the <a href="instrumental%20temperature%20record">instrumental temperature record</a>, and in <a href="Historical%20climatology">historical</a> and <a href="Paleoclimatology">paleoclimate</a> <a href="Proxy%20%28climate%29">proxy records</a> of climate change over thousands to millions of years.

In 2013, the <a href="Intergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) <a href="IPCC%20Fifth%20Assessment%20Report">Fifth Assessment Report</a> concluded, "It is that human influence has been the <a href="Attribution%20of%20recent%20climate%20change">dominant cause</a> of the observed warming since the mid-20th century." The largest human influence has been the emission of <a href="greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a>es such as <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, <a href="methane">methane</a>, and <a href="nitrous%20oxide">nitrous oxide</a>. <a href="Climate%20model">Climate model</a> projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century, the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further to depending on the <a href="Representative%20Concentration%20Pathways">rate of greenhouse gas emissions</a> and on <a href="%23Feedback">climate feedback effects</a>. These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and <a href="Scientific%20opinion%20on%20climate%20change">are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing</a>.

Future <a href="effects%20of%20global%20warming">climate change effects</a> are expected to include rising <a href="Sea%20level%20rise">sea levels</a>, <a href="ocean%20acidification">ocean acidification</a>, <a href="regional%20effects%20of%20global%20warming">regional changes</a> in precipitation, and <a href="Desertification">expansion of deserts</a> in the <a href="subtropics">subtropics</a>. Surface temperature increases are <a href="polar%20amplification">greatest in the Arctic</a>, with the continuing <a href="retreat%20of%20glaciers%20since%201850">retreat of glaciers</a>, <a href="permafrost">permafrost</a>, and <a href="sea%20ice">sea ice</a>. Predicted regional precipitation effects include more frequent <a href="extreme%20weather">extreme weather</a> events such as <a href="heat%20wave">heat wave</a>s, <a href="drought">drought</a>s, <a href="wildfires">wildfires</a>, heavy rainfall with floods, and heavy snowfall. Effects directly significant to humans are predicted to include the threat to <a href="climate%20change%20and%20agriculture">food security</a> from decreasing crop yields, and the <a href="Environmental%20migrant">abandonment of populated areas</a> due to rising sea levels. Environmental impacts appear likely to include the <a href="Extinction%20risk%20from%20global%20warming">extinction</a> or relocation of <a href="Climate%20change%20and%20ecosystems">ecosystems</a> as they adapt to climate change, with <a href="Environmental%20issues%20with%20coral%20reefs">coral reefs</a>, <a href="Montane%20ecosystems">mountain ecosystems</a>, and <a href="Climate%20change%20in%20the%20Arctic">Arctic ecosystems</a> most immediately threatened. Because the climate system has a large "<a href="Climate%20inertia">inertia</a>" and greenhouse gases will remain in the atmosphere for a long time, climatic changes and their effects will continue to become more pronounced for many centuries even if further increases to greenhouse gases stop.

Possible societal responses to global warming include <a href="Climate%20change%20mitigation">mitigation</a> by emissions reduction, <a href="Climate%20change%20adaptation">adaptation</a> to its effects, and possible future <a href="climate%20engineering">climate engineering</a>. Most countries are parties to the <a href="United%20Nations%20Framework%20Convention%20on%20Climate%20Change">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCCC), whose ultimate objective is to <a href="Avoiding%20Dangerous%20Climate%20Change">prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change</a>. Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required and that global warming should be limited to well below compared to pre-industrial levels, with efforts made to limit warming to . Some scientists call into question climate adaptation feasibility, with higher emissions scenarios, or the two degree temperature target.

Public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing. A global 2015 <a href="Pew%20Research%20Center">Pew Research Center</a> report showed that a <a href="median">median</a> of 54% of all respondents asked consider it "a very serious problem". Significant regional differences exist, with Americans and Chinese (whose economies are responsible for <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20carbon%20dioxide%20emissions">the greatest annual CO emissions</a>) among the least concerned.

Multiple independently produced datasets confirm that between 1880 and 2012, the global average (land and ocean) surface temperature increased by 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C. Since 1979 the rate of warming has approximately doubled (, against ). <a href="Proxy%20%28climate%29">Climate proxies</a> show the temperature to have been relatively stable over the <a href="Temperature%20record%20of%20the%20past%201000%20years">one or two thousand years</a> before 1850, with regionally varying fluctuations such as the <a href="Medieval%20Warm%20Period">Medieval Warm Period</a> and the <a href="Little%20Ice%20Age">Little Ice Age</a>.

Although the increase of the average near-surface atmospheric temperature is commonly used to track global warming, over 90% of the additional energy stored in the climate system over the last 50 years has accumulated in the oceans. The rest has melted ice and warmed the <a href="continent">continent</a>s and the <a href="atmosphere">atmosphere</a>.

The warming evident in the instrumental temperature record is consistent with a wide range of observations, as documented by many independent scientific groups. Examples include <a href="current%20sea%20level%20rise">sea level rise</a>, widespread melting of snow and land ice, increased <a href="Ocean%20heat%20content">heat content of the oceans</a>, increased <a href="specific%20humidity">humidity</a>, and the earlier <a href="phenology">timing</a> of spring events, e.g., the <a href="flowering">flowering</a> of plants.

Global warming refers to global averages, with the amount of warming varying by region. Since 1979, global average land temperatures have increased about twice as fast as global average ocean temperatures. This is due to the larger <a href="heat%20capacity">heat capacity</a> of the oceans and because oceans lose more heat by <a href="evaporation">evaporation</a>. Where greenhouse gas emissions occur does not impact the location of warming because the major greenhouse gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet, although localized black carbon deposits on snow and ice do contribute to Arctic warming.

The Northern Hemisphere and North Pole have heated much faster than the South Pole and Southern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more land, its arrangement around the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a> has resulted in the maximum surface area flipping from reflective snow and ice cover to ocean and land surfaces that absorb more sunlight. <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> temperatures have increased and are predicted to continue to increase during this century at over <a href="polar%20amplification">twice the rate of the rest of the world</a>. As the temperature difference between the Arctic and the equator decreases, ocean currents like the gulf stream that are driven by that temperature difference are weakening. Studies have also linked the rapidly warming Arctic to <a href="extreme%20weather">extreme weather</a> in mid-latitudes as the <a href="jet%20stream">jet stream</a> becomes more erratic.

The rate of ice loss from glaciers and ice sheets in the Antarctic is a key area of uncertainty since Antarctica contains 90% of potential sea level rise. <a href="Polar%20amplification">Polar amplification</a> and increased ocean warmth are undermining and threatening to unplug Antarctic glacier outlets, potentially resulting in more rapid sea level rise. To date, increased snowfall in Antarctica has offset a third of ice loss from West Antarctica, with East Antarctica ice sheets recently beginning to shed mass as well.

Because the climate system has large thermal inertia, it can take centuries for the climate to fully adjust. While record-breaking years attract considerable public interest, individual years are less significant than the overall trend. Global surface temperature is subject to short-term fluctuations that overlay long-term trends, and can temporarily mask or magnify them.

An example of such an episode is the slower rate of surface temperature increase from 1998 to 2012, which was dubbed the <a href="global%20warming%20hiatus">global warming hiatus</a> by the media and some scientists. Throughout this period ocean heat storage continued to progress steadily upwards, and in subsequent years surface temperatures have spiked upwards. Climate models account for the global warming hiatus by incorporating heating and cooling from <a href="El%20Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern%20Oscillation">El Niño / La Nina events</a>, sunspot cycles, and volcanic eruptions that reach the stratosphere.

By itself, the climate system may generate random changes in global temperatures for years to decades at a time, but long-term changes emanate only from so-called "external forcings". These forcings are "external" to the climate system, but not necessarily external to Earth. Examples of external forcings include changes in the composition of the atmosphere (e.g., increased concentrations of <a href="greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a>es), <a href="solar%20luminosity">solar luminosity</a>, <a href="volcano">volcanic</a> eruptions, and <a href="orbital%20forcing">variations in Earth's orbit</a> around the Sun.

The greenhouse effect is the process by which <a href="Absorption%20%28electromagnetic%20radiation%29">absorption</a> and <a href="Emission%20spectrum">emission</a> of <a href="infrared">infrared</a> radiation by gases in a planet's <a href="atmosphere">atmosphere</a> warm its lower atmosphere and surface. It was proposed by <a href="Joseph%20Fourier">Joseph Fourier</a> in 1824, discovered in 1860 by <a href="John%20Tyndall">John Tyndall</a>, was first investigated quantitatively by <a href="Svante%20Arrhenius">Svante Arrhenius</a> in 1896, and the hypothesis was reported in the popular press as early as 1912. The scientific description of global warming was further developed in the 1930s through the 1960s by <a href="Guy%20Stewart%20Callendar">Guy Stewart Callendar</a>.

On Earth, an atmosphere containing naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases causes air temperature near the surface to be warmer by about than it would be in their absence. Without the Earth's atmosphere, the Earth's average temperature would be well below the freezing temperature of water. The major greenhouse gases are <a href="water%20vapor">water vapour</a>, which causes about 36–70% of the greenhouse effect; <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (CO), which causes 9–26%; <a href="methane">methane</a> (CH), which causes 4–9%; and <a href="ozone">ozone</a> (O), which causes 3–7%.

Human activity since the Industrial Revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to increased <a href="radiative%20forcing">radiative forcing</a> from CO, methane, <a href="tropospheric%20ozone">tropospheric ozone</a>, <a href="Chlorofluorocarbon">CFCs</a>, and <a href="nitrous%20oxide">nitrous oxide</a>. According to work published in 2007, the <a href="Greenhouse%20gas%23Anthropogenic%20greenhouse%20gases">concentrations</a> of CO and methane had increased by 36% and 148% respectively since 1750. These levels are much higher than at any time during the last 800,000 years, the period for which reliable data has been extracted from <a href="ice%20core">ice core</a>s. Less direct geological evidence indicates that CO values higher than this were last seen about 20 million years ago.

<a href="Fossil%20fuel">Fossil fuel</a> burning has produced about three-quarters of the increase in CO from human activity over the past 20 years. The rest of this increase is caused mostly by changes in land-use, <a href="deforestation%20and%20climate%20change">particularly deforestation</a>. Another significant non-fuel source of anthropogenic CO emissions is the <a href="calcination">calcination</a> of <a href="limestone">limestone</a> for <a href="clinker%20%28cement%29">clinker</a> production, a chemical process which releases CO. There are efforts to develop types of cement that produce less CO but it is feared not enough is being done. Estimates of global CO emissions in 2011 from fossil fuel combustion, including cement production and <a href="gas%20flaring">gas flaring</a>, was 34.8 billion tonnes (9.5 ± 0.5 PgC), an increase of 54% above emissions in 1990. Coal burning was responsible for 43% of the total emissions, oil 34%, gas 18%, cement 4.9% and gas flaring 0.7%.

In May 2013, it was reported that readings for CO taken at the world's primary benchmark site in <a href="Mauna%20Loa%20Observatory">Mauna Loa</a> surpassed 400 <a href="Parts%20per%20million">ppm</a>. According to professor <a href="Brian%20Hoskins">Brian Hoskins</a>, this is likely the first time CO levels have been this high for about 4.5 million years. Monthly global CO concentrations exceeded 400 ppm in March 2015, probably for the first time in several million years. According to the global carbon project, <a href="Carbon%20dioxide%20in%20Earth%27s%20atmosphere">carbon emission rates</a> plateaued from 2014 to 2016, rose by 1.6% in 2017, then rose again by 2.7% in 2018.

Over the last three decades of the twentieth century, <a href="gross%20domestic%20product">gross domestic product</a> per capita and <a href="population%20growth">population growth</a> were the main drivers of increases in greenhouse gas emissions. CO emissions are continuing to rise due to the burning of fossil fuels and land-use change. Emissions can be <a href="greenhouse%20gas%23Regional%20and%20national%20attribution%20of%20emissions">attributed to different regions</a>. Attributions of emissions due to land-use change are subject to considerable uncertainty.

<a href="climate%20change%20scenario%23Emissions%20scenarios">Emissions scenarios</a>, estimates of changes in future emission levels of greenhouse gases, have been projected that depend upon uncertain economic, <a href="sociology">sociological</a>, <a href="technology">technological</a>, and natural developments. In most scenarios, emissions continue to rise over the century, while in a few, emissions are reduced. Fossil fuel reserves are abundant, and will not limit carbon emissions in the 21st century. Emission scenarios, combined with modelling of the <a href="carbon%20cycle">carbon cycle</a>, have been used to produce estimates of how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future. Using the six IPCC <a href="Special%20Report%20on%20Emissions%20Scenarios">SRES</a> "marker" scenarios, models suggest that by the year 2100, the atmospheric concentration of CO could range between 541 and 970 ppm.

<a href="Global%20dimming">Global dimming</a>, a gradual reduction in the amount of <a href="irradiance">sunlight reaching the Earth's surface</a>, was observed from 1961 until 1990. <a href="Particulates%23Climate%20effects">Solid and liquid particles</a> known as "<a href="aerosol">aerosol</a>s", produced by volcanoes and human-made <a href="pollutant">pollutant</a>s, are thought to be the main cause of this dimming. They exert a cooling effect by reflecting incoming sunlight, with NASA estimating that between 1850 and 2010 aerosols limited global warming by 1 degree Celsius. <a href="Wet%20deposition">Aerosol removal by precipitation</a> gives tropospheric aerosols an <a href="atmospheric%20lifetime">atmospheric lifetime</a> of only about a week, while <a href="stratosphere">stratospheric</a> aerosols can remain for a few years. Global aerosols have been declining since 1990, removing some of the masking of global warming that aerosols had been providing.

In addition to their direct effect by scattering and absorbing solar radiation, aerosols have indirect effects on the <a href="Earth%27s%20energy%20budget">Earth's radiation budget</a>. Sulfate aerosols act as <a href="cloud%20condensation%20nuclei">cloud condensation nuclei</a> and thus lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets. These clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets, a phenomenon known as the <a href="Twomey%20effect">Twomey effect</a>. This effect also causes droplets to be of more uniform size, which reduces <a href="Cloud%20physics%23Collision-coalescence">growth of raindrops</a> and makes the cloud more reflective to incoming sunlight, known as the <a href="Albrecht%20effect">Albrecht effect</a>. Indirect effects are most noticeable in marine stratiform clouds, and have very little radiative effect on convective clouds. Indirect effects of aerosols represent the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.

While aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, <a href="black%20carbon">black carbon</a> in <a href="soot">soot</a> can also increase global warming when deposited on snow and ice. Not only does it increase the absorption of sunlight, it also directly exacerbates melting and sea level rise. Limiting new black carbon deposits in the Arctic could reduce global warming by 0.2 degrees Celsius by 2050. When soot is suspended in the atmosphere it directly absorbs solar radiation, heating the atmosphere and cooling the surface. In isolated areas with high soot production, such as rural India, as much as 50% of surface warming due to greenhouse gases may be masked by <a href="atmospheric%20brown%20cloud">atmospheric brown cloud</a>s. The influences of atmospheric particles, including black carbon, are most pronounced in the tropics and sub-tropics, particularly in Asia, while the effects of greenhouse gases are dominant in the extratropics and southern hemisphere.

Since 1978, <a href="solar%20variation">solar irradiance</a> has been measured by <a href="satellite">satellite</a>s. Climate models have been used to examine the role of the Sun in recent climate change. Models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when only taking into account variations in solar output and volcanic activity.

Another line of evidence for the warming not being attributable to the Sun is the differing temperature changes at different levels in the Earth's atmosphere. According to basic physical principles, the greenhouse effect produces warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere), but cooling of the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere). If solar variations were responsible for the observed warming, warming of both the troposphere and the stratosphere would be expected, but that has not been the case.

While variations in solar activity have not produced recent global warming, variations in solar output over geologic time (millions to billions of years ago) are believed to have caused major changes in the earth's climate. The 11 year <a href="solar%20cycle">solar cycle</a> of sunspot activity also introduces climate changes that have a small cyclical effect on annual global temperatures.

The tilt of the Earth's axis and the shape of its orbit around the Sun vary slowly over tens of thousands of years. This changes climate by changing the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of incoming <a href="insolation">solar energy</a> at the Earth's surface. By reviewing ice cores and seafloor sediments, it has been found that periodic <a href="glacial%20period">glacial</a> and <a href="interglacial%20period">interglacial period</a>s over last few million years have been been driven by this process.

During the last few thousand years, this phenomenon contributed to a slow cooling trend at high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere during summer, a trend that was reversed by greenhouse-gas-induced warming during the 20th century. Orbital cycles favorable for <a href="glaciation">glaciation</a> are not expected within the next 50,000 years.

The response of the climate system to an initial forcing is increased by positive "<a href="feedback">feedback</a>s" and reduced by negative feedbacks. The main negative feedback to global temperature change is <a href="radiative%20cooling">radiative cooling</a> to space as <a href="infrared%20radiation">infrared radiation</a>, which increases strongly with increasing temperature. Uncertainty over the effect of other feedbacks is the major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given forcing scenario.

<a href="polar%20amplification">Arctic amplification</a> has caused Arctic temperatures to increase at almost twice the rate of the rest of the world, resulting in a strong positive feedback to global temperature averages. The reduction of snow cover and <a href="sea%20ice">sea ice</a> in the Arctic reduces the reflectivity ("<a href="albedo">albedo</a>") of the Earth's surface. Arctic amplification also causes methane to be released as <a href="permafrost">permafrost</a> melts, which is expected to surpass land use changes as the second strongest anthropogenic source of greenhouse gases by the end of the century.

The <a href="carbon%20cycle">carbon cycle</a> has been a negative feedback so far, with roughly half of total CO emissions being absorbed annually by plants on land and in oceans. This results from carbon dioxide stimulating plant growth, with an estimated 30% increase in plant growth from 2000 to 2017. The limits and reversal point for this feedback are an area of uncertainty. As more CO and heat are absorbed by the ocean it is acidifying and ocean circulation can change, changing the rate at which the ocean can absorb atmospheric carbon. On land, greater plant growth will be constrained by nitrogen levels and can be reversed by plant heat stress, <a href="desertification">desertification</a>, and the <a href="soil%20carbon%20feedback">release of carbon from soil as the ground warms</a>.

Another major uncertainty is how cloud cover may change in the future. To date, cloud cover has also been a negative feedback, with NASA estimating that aerosols produced by the burning of hydrocarbons have limited warming by half from 1850 to 2010. An analysis of satellite data between 1983 and 2009 reveals that cloud tops are reaching higher into the atmosphere and that cloudy storm tracks are shifting toward Earth's poles, suggesting clouds will be a positive feedback in the future. A 2019 study predicts that if greenhouse gases reach three times the current level of atmospheric carbon dioxide that stratocumulus clouds could abruptly disperse, contributing an additional 8 degrees Celsius of warming.

A concern going forward is that positive feedbacks will lead to a tipping point, where global temperatures transition to a different stable state even if greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated. A 2018 study tried to identify a planetary threshold which could lead to a new <a href="Climate%20state%23Hothouse">hothouse climate state</a> by studying self-reinforcing feedbacks and the past behavior of Earth's climate system. The authors found that an increase of as little as 2 °C (3.6 °F) over pre-industrial levels could lead to cascading effects that produce a hothouse Earth scenario, with risks increasingly sharply from there. Some tipping point effects like the extinction of coral reefs and flooding of deltas could occur in this century while others like the complete melting of Antarctica would take several centuries.

A <a href="climate%20model">climate model</a> is a representation of the physical, chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system. Computer models are then run on supercomputers to reproduce and predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere. There are more than two dozen scientific institutions that develop climate models. Model forecasts vary due to different greenhouse gas inputs and different assumptions about the impact of different <a href="%23Feedback">feedbacks on climate sensitivity</a>.

A <a href="Integrated%20assessment%20modelling">subset of climate models</a> add societal factors to a simple physical climate model. These models simulate how population, economic growth and energy use affect – and interact with – the physical climate. With this information, scientists can produce scenarios of how greenhouse gas emissions may vary in the future. Scientists can then run these scenarios through physical climate models to generate climate change projection.

Climate models include different external forcings for their models. For different greenhouse gas inputs four RCPs (<a href="Representative%20Concentration%20Pathway">Representative Concentration Pathway</a>s) are used: "a stringent mitigation scenario (RCP2.6), two intermediate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP6.0) and one scenario with very high GHG emissions (RCP8.5). Models also include changes in the Earth's orbit, historical changes in the sun's activity and volcanic forcing. RCPs only look at concentrations of greenhouse gases, factoring out uncertainty as to whether the carbon cycle will continue to remove about half of the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year.

The physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates. Past models have underestimated the rate of <a href="Arctic%20shrinkage">Arctic shrinkage</a> and underestimated the rate of precipitation increase. Sea level rise since 1990 was underestimated in older models, but now agrees well with observations. The 2017 United States-published <a href="National%20Climate%20Assessment">National Climate Assessment</a> notes that "climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes".

The environmental effects of global warming are broad and far-reaching. They include the following diverse effects:


Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the <a href="extinction">extinction</a> of many species and reduced diversity of ecosystems. Rising temperatures have been found to push bees to their physiological limits, and could cause the extinction of bee populations. A 2012 study concluded that continued ocean uptake of CO affects the brains and central nervous system of certain fish species, and that this impacts their ability to hear, smell, and evade predators. The study authors note, "We've now established it isn't simply the acidification of the oceans that is causing disruption – as is the case with shellfish and plankton with chalky skeletons – but the actual dissolved CO itself is damaging the fishes' nervous systems."

The <a href="effects%20of%20climate%20change%20on%20humans">effects of climate change on human systems</a>, mostly due to warming or shifts in <a href="precipitation">precipitation</a> patterns, or both, have been detected worldwide. The future social impacts of climate change will be uneven across the world. Many risks are expected to increase with higher magnitudes of global warming. All regions are at risk of experiencing negative impacts. Low-latitude, <a href="Developing%20countries">less developed areas</a> face the greatest risk. A study from 2015 concluded that economic growth (gross domestic product) of poorer countries is much more impaired with projected future climate warming, than previously thought. In small islands and <a href="mega%20delta">mega delta</a>s, <a href="inundation">inundation</a> as a result of sea level rise is expected to threaten vital infrastructure and human settlements. This could lead to issues of <a href="climate%20refugee">homelessness</a> in countries with low-lying areas such as <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, as well as <a href="statelessness">statelessness</a> for populations in countries such as the <a href="Maldives">Maldives</a> and <a href="Tuvalu">Tuvalu</a>.

Examples of impacts of global warming on humans include:

The Arctic, <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, small islands and <a href="Asia">Asia</a>n <a href="river%20delta">megadeltas</a> are regions that are likely to be especially affected by future climate change. Africa is one of the most vulnerable continents to climate variability and change because of multiple existing stresses and low <a href="Climate%20adaptation">adaptive capacity</a>. Existing stresses include poverty, political conflicts, and <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a> degradation. By 2050, between 350 million and 600 million people are projected to experience increased <a href="water%20stress">water stress</a> due to <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a> (see <a href="Climate%20change%20in%20Africa">Climate change in Africa</a>). Climate variability and change is projected to severely compromise <a href="climate%20change%20and%20agriculture">agricultural production</a>, including access to food, across Africa. Research projects that regions may even become uninhabitable, due to a high <a href="wet-bulb%20temperature">wet-bulb temperature</a>.

<a href="Polar%20bears">Polar bears</a> enter inhabited areas more than in the past, owing to climate change. Global warming reduces sea-ice and forces bears to visit land in search of food. The <a href="2019%20Mass%20invasion%20of%20Russian%20polar%20bears">2019 Mass invasion of Russian polar bears</a> happened in February, with polar bears entering northeastern <a href="Novaya%20Zemlya">Novaya Zemlya</a>. Dozens of <a href="polar%20bears">polar bears</a> were seen entering homes and public buildings and inhabited areas, so <a href="Arkhangelsk%20region">Arkhangelsk region</a> authorities declared a state of emergency on Saturday.

Mitigation of climate change are actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, or enhance the capacity of carbon sinks to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. There is a large potential for future reductions in emissions by a combination of activities, including <a href="energy%20conservation">energy conservation</a> and increased <a href="Efficient%20energy%20use">energy efficiency</a>; the use of <a href="low-carbon%20energy">low-carbon energy</a> technologies, such as <a href="renewable%20energy">renewable energy</a>, <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear energy</a>, and <a href="carbon%20capture%20and%20storage">carbon capture and storage</a>; and enhancing carbon sinks through, for example, <a href="reforestation">reforestation</a> and preventing <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>.
A 2015 report by <a href="Citibank">Citibank</a> concluded that transitioning to a <a href="low%20carbon%20economy">low carbon economy</a> would yield positive return on investments.

Near- and long-term trends in the global energy system are inconsistent with limiting global warming at below 1.5 or 2 °C, relative to pre-industrial levels. Pledges made as part of the <a href="2010%20United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference">Cancún agreements</a> are broadly consistent with having a likely chance (66 to 100% probability) of limiting global warming (in the 21st century) at below 3 °C, relative to pre-industrial levels.

In limiting warming at below 2 °C, more stringent emission reductions in the near-term would allow for less rapid reductions after 2030. Many integrated models are unable to meet the 2 °C target if pessimistic assumptions are made about the availability of mitigation technologies.

Using <a href="bicycle">bicycle</a>s reduces GHG emissions.

<a href="Climate%20change%20adaptation">Climate change adaptation</a> is another policy response. The adaptation may be planned, either in reaction to or anticipation of global warming, or spontaneous, i.e., without government intervention. Planned adaptation is already occurring on a limited basis. The barriers, limits, and costs of future adaptation are not fully understood. Environmental organizations and public figures have emphasized changes in the climate and the risks they entail, while promoting adaptation to changes in infrastructural needs and emissions reductions.

Adaptation is especially important in <a href="developing%20countries">developing countries</a> since those countries are predicted to bear the brunt of the effects of global warming. That is, the capacity and potential for humans to adapt (called <a href="adaptive%20capacity">adaptive capacity</a>) is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less capacity to adapt.

<a href="Climate%20engineering">Climate engineering</a> (sometimes called "geoengineering" or "climate intervention") is the deliberate modification of the climate. It has been investigated as a possible response to global warming, e.g. by NASA and the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>. Techniques under research fall generally into the categories <a href="solar%20radiation%20management">solar radiation management</a> and <a href="carbon%20dioxide%20removal">carbon dioxide removal</a>, although various other schemes have been suggested. A study from 2014 investigated the most common climate engineering methods and concluded they are either ineffective or have potentially severe side effects and cannot be stopped without causing rapid climate change.

Most countries in the world are parties to the <a href="United%20Nations%20Framework%20Convention%20on%20Climate%20Change">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCCC).
The ultimate objective of the Convention is to prevent dangerous human interference of the climate system.
As stated in the Convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where <a href="Climate%20change%20and%20ecosystems">ecosystems</a> can adapt naturally to climate change, <a href="Climate%20change%20and%20agriculture">food production</a> is not threatened, and <a href="Economics%20of%20global%20warming">economic development</a> can proceed in a sustainable fashion. The Framework Convention was agreed on in 1992, but global emissions have risen since then.

During negotiations, the <a href="Group%20of%2077">G77</a> (a lobbying group in the United Nations representing 133 <a href="Developing%20country">developing countries</a>) pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to "[take] the lead" in reducing their emissions. This was justified on the basis that the <a href="Developed%20country">developed countries</a>' emissions had contributed most to the <a href="Greenhouse%20gas%23Cumulative%20and%20historical%20emissions">cumulation</a> of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, <a href="Greenhouse%20gas%23Annual%20and%20per%20capita%20emissions">per-capita emissions</a> (i.e., emissions per head of population) were still relatively low in developing countries, and the emissions of developing countries would grow to meet their development needs.

This mandate was sustained in the <a href="Kyoto%20Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> to the Framework Convention, which entered into legal effect in 2005. In ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, most developed countries accepted legally binding commitments to limit their emissions. These first-round commitments expired in 2012.
United States President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> rejected the treaty on the basis that "it exempts 80% of the world, including major population centres such as China and India, from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the US economy."

At the <a href="2009%20United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference">15th UNFCCC Conference of the Parties</a>, held in 2009 at <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, several UNFCCC Parties produced the <a href="Copenhagen%20Accord">Copenhagen Accord</a>. Parties associated with the Accord (140 countries, ) aim to limit the future increase in global mean temperature to below . The 16th Conference of the Parties (COP16) was held at <a href="Canc%C3%BAn">Cancún</a> in 2010. It produced an agreement, not a binding treaty, that the Parties should take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet a goal of limiting global warming to above pre-industrial temperatures. It also recognized the need to consider strengthening the goal to a global average rise of .

The discussion continues in scientific articles that are peer-reviewed and assessed by scientists who
work in the relevant fields and participate in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The <a href="scientific%20consensus">scientific consensus</a> stated in the <a href="IPCC%20Fifth%20Assessment%20Report">IPCC Fifth Assessment Report</a> is that it "is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century".
A 2008 report by the U.S. <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a> stated that most scientists by then agreed that observed warming in recent decades was primarily caused by human activities increasing the amount of <a href="greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a>es in the atmosphere. In 2005 the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> stated that while the overwhelming majority of scientists were in agreement on the main points, some individuals and organizations opposed to the consensus on urgent action needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions had tried to undermine the science and work of the IPCC. National science academies have called on world leaders for policies to cut global emissions.

In 2018, the IPCC published <a href="Special%20Report%20on%20Global%20Warming%20of%201.5%C2%BAC">SR15</a>, which warned that if current rate of greenhouse gas emissions are not mitigated, major crises could occur by 2040 as the planet warms by 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius). The report said that preventing such crises will require a swift transformation of the global economy that has "no documented historic precedent."

In the scientific literature, there is a <a href="scientific%20opinion%20on%20climate%20change">strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased</a> in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. No scientific body of national or international standing <a href="Scientific%20opinion%20on%20climate%20change%23Opposing">disagrees with this view</a>. In November 2017, a second <a href="World%20Scientists%27%20Warning%20to%20Humanity">warning to humanity</a> signed by 15,364 scientists from 184 countries stated that "the current trajectory of potentially catastrophic climate change due to rising greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural productionparticularly from farming ruminants for meat consumption" is "especially troubling". A July 2017 study published in "<a href="Environmental%20Research%20Letters">Environmental Research Letters</a>" asserts that the most significant action individuals could make to mitigate their own carbon footprint is to have fewer children, followed by living vehicle-free, forgoing air travel, and adopting a plant-based diet.

The <a href="global%20warming%20controversy">global warming controversy</a> refers to a variety of disputes, substantially more pronounced in the <a href="Media%20coverage%20of%20climate%20change">popular media</a> than in the scientific literature, regarding the nature, causes, and consequences of global warming. The disputed issues include the causes of increased <a href="instrumental%20temperature%20record">global average air temperature</a>, especially since the mid-20th century, whether this warming trend is unprecedented or within normal climatic variations, whether humankind has contributed significantly to it, and whether the increase is completely or partially an artefact of poor measurements. Additional disputes concern estimates of climate sensitivity, predictions of additional warming, and what the consequences of global warming will be.

In the United States from about 1990 onwards, <a href="Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States">American conservative</a> <a href="think%20tank">think tank</a>s had begun challenging the legitimacy of global warming as a social problem. They <a href="climate%20change%20denial">challenged the scientific evidence</a>, argued that <a href="benefits%20of%20global%20warming">global warming would have benefits</a>, and asserted that proposed solutions would do more harm than good. Some people dispute aspects of climate change science. Organizations such as the <a href="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> <a href="Competitive%20Enterprise%20Institute">Competitive Enterprise Institute</a>, conservative commentators, and some companies such as <a href="ExxonMobil">ExxonMobil</a> have challenged IPCC climate change scenarios, funded scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus, and provided their own projections of the economic cost of stricter controls. On the other hand, some fossil fuel companies have scaled back their efforts in recent years, or even called for policies to reduce global warming. Global oil companies have begun to acknowledge climate change exists and is caused by human activities and the burning of fossil fuels.

The global warming problem came to international public attention in the late 1980s. Polling groups began to track opinions on the subject, at first mainly in the United States. The longest consistent polling, by <a href="Gallup%20%28company%29">Gallup</a> in the US, found relatively small deviations of 10% or so from 1998 to 2015 in opinion on the seriousness of global warming, but with increasing <a href="Polarization%20%28politics%29">polarization</a> between those concerned and those unconcerned.

Due to confusing media coverage in the early 1990s, issues such as ozone depletion and climate change were often mixed up, affecting public understanding of these issues. According to a 2010 survey of Americans, a majority thought that the ozone layer and spray cans contribute to global warming. Although there are a few <a href="Ozone%20depletion%23Ozone%20depletion%20and%20global%20warming">areas of linkage</a>, the relationship between the two is not strong. Reduced stratospheric ozone has had a slight cooling influence on surface temperatures, while increased tropospheric ozone has had a somewhat larger warming effect. However, the <a href="Chlorofluorocarbon">CFC</a>s used in spray cans are powerful greenhouse gases, with some estimates attributing CFC emissions during the 1970s to have caused almost half of the global warming for that decade.

By 2010, with 111 countries surveyed, Gallup determined that there had been a substantial decrease since 2007–2008 in the number of Americans and Europeans who viewed global warming as a serious threat. In the US, just a little over half the population (53%) viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their families; this was 10 points below the 2008 poll (63%). Latin America had the biggest rise in concern: 73% said global warming was a serious threat to their families. This global poll also found that people were more likely to attribute global warming to human activities than to natural causes, except in the US where nearly half (47%) of the population attributed global warming to natural causes.

A March–May 2013 survey by <a href="Pew%20Research%20Center%20for%20the%20People%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Press">Pew Research Center for the People & the Press</a> polled 39 countries about global threats. According to 54% of those questioned, global warming featured top of the perceived global threats.

The <a href="history%20of%20climate%20change%20science">history of climate change science</a> began in the early 19th century when <a href="ice%20ages">ice ages</a> and other natural changes in <a href="paleoclimate">paleoclimate</a> were first suspected and the natural <a href="greenhouse%20effect">greenhouse effect</a> first identified. In the late 19th century, scientists first argued that human emissions of <a href="greenhouse%20gases">greenhouse gases</a> could change the <a href="climate">climate</a>. In the 1960s, the warming effect of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> gas became increasingly convincing. By the 1990s, as a result of improving fidelity of <a href="computer%20models">computer models</a> and observational work confirming the <a href="Milankovitch%20theory">Milankovitch theory</a> of the ice ages, a consensus position formed: greenhouse gases were deeply involved in most climate changes, and human-caused emissions were bringing discernible global warming. Since the 1990s, scientific research on climate change has included multiple disciplines and has expanded. Research during this period has been summarized in the Assessment Reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Research in the 1950s suggested increasing temperatures, and a 1952 newspaper reported "climate change". This phrase next appeared in a November 1957 report in "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20Northwest%20Indiana">The Hammond Times</a>" which described <a href="Roger%20Revelle">Roger Revelle</a>'s research into the effects of increasing human-caused emissions on the <a href="greenhouse%20effect">greenhouse effect</a>, "a large scale global warming, with radical climate changes may result." Both phrases were used only occasionally until 1975, when <a href="Wallace%20Smith%20Broecker">Wallace Smith Broecker</a> published a scientific paper on the topic, "Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?" The phrase began to come into common use, and in 1976 <a href="Mikhail%20Budyko">Mikhail Budyko</a>'s statement that "a global warming up has started" was widely reported. Other studies, such as a 1971 <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">MIT</a> report, referred to the human impact as "inadvertent climate modification", but an influential 1979 <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a> study headed by <a href="Jule%20Gregory%20Charney">Jule Charney</a> followed Broecker in using "global warming" to refer to rising surface temperatures, while describing the wider effects of increased as "climate change".

In 1986 and November 1987, NASA climate scientist <a href="James%20Hansen">James Hansen</a> gave testimony to Congress on global warming. There were increasing heatwaves and drought problems in the summer of 1988, and when Hansen testified in the Senate on 23 June he sparked worldwide interest. He said "global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming." Public attention increased over the summer, and "global warming" became the dominant popular term, commonly used both by the press and in public discourse.

In a 2008 NASA article on usage, <a href="Erik%20M.%20Conway">Erik M. Conway</a> defined "global warming" as "the increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to rising levels of greenhouse gases", while "climate change" was "a long-term change in the Earth's climate, or of a region on Earth". Because effects such as changing patterns of rainfall and rising sea levels would probably have more impact than temperatures alone, he considered "global climate change" a more scientifically accurate term, and like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the NASA website emphasized this wider context.

Rudolf Vrba

Rudolf "Rudi" Vrba (born Walter Rosenberg; 11 September 1924 – 27 March 2006) was a <a href="Slovaks">Slovak</a>-<a href="Jew">Jew</a>ish <a href="biochemist">biochemist</a> who, as a teenager in 1942, was deported to the <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz concentration camp</a> in <a href="Occupation%20of%20Poland%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29">German-occupied Poland</a>. He became known for having escaped from the camp in April 1944, at the height of the <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, and for having co-written a detailed report about the mass murder that was taking place there. Distribution of the report by <a href="George%20Mantello">George Mantello</a> in Switzerland is credited with having halted the mass deportation of Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz in July 1944, saving more than 200,000 lives. After the war Vrba trained as a biochemist, working mostly in England and Canada.

Vrba and fellow escapee <a href="Alfr%C3%A9d%20Wetzler">Alfréd Wetzler</a> fled Auschwitz three weeks after German forces <a href="Hungary%20during%20World%20War%20II">invaded Hungary</a> and shortly before the <a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> began mass deportations of Hungary's Jewish population to the camp. The information the men dictated to Jewish officials when they arrived in Slovakia on 24 April 1944, which included that new arrivals in Auschwitz were being gassed and not "resettled" as the Germans maintained, became known as the <a href="Vrba%E2%80%93Wetzler%20report">Vrba–Wetzler report</a>. When the <a href="War%20Refugee%20Board">War Refugee Board</a> published it with considerable delay in November 1944, the "New York Herald Tribune" described it as "the most shocking document ever issued by a United States government agency". While it confirmed material in earlier reports from Polish and other escapees, historian <a href="Miroslav%20K%C3%A1rn%C3%BD">Miroslav Kárný</a> wrote that it was unique in its "unflinching detail".

There was a delay of several weeks before the report was distributed widely enough to gain the attention of governments. Mass transports of Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz began on 15 May 1944 at a rate of 12,000 people a day. Most went straight to the gas chambers. Vrba argued until the end of his life that the deportees might have refused to board the trains, or at least that their panic would have disrupted the transports, had the report been distributed widely and sooner.

From late June and into July 1944, material from the Vrba–Wetzler report appeared in newspapers and radio broadcasts in the United States and Europe, particularly in Switzerland, prompting world leaders to appeal to <a href="Regent%20of%20Hungary">Hungarian regent</a> <a href="Mikl%C3%B3s%20Horthy">Miklós Horthy</a> to halt the deportations. On 2 July American and British forces bombed Budapest, and on 7 July Horthy ordered an end to the mass deportations, possibly fearing he would be held responsible after the war. By then, 437,000 Jews had been deported—almost the entire Jewish population of the Hungarian countryside—but another 200,000 in Budapest were saved.

Vrba was born Walter Rosenberg in <a href="Topo%C4%BE%C4%8Dany">Topoľčany</a>, <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> (part of <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a> from 1993), one of three boys and a girl to Helena Rosenberg, née Gruenfeldová, and her husband, Elias. Vrba's mother was from <a href="Zbehy">Zbehy</a>; his maternal grandfather, Bernat Grünfeld, an <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox Jew</a> from <a href="Nitra">Nitra</a>, was killed in the <a href="Majdanek%20concentration%20camp">Majdanek concentration camp</a>. Vrba took the name Rudolf Vrba after his escape.

The Rosenbergs owned a steam <a href="sawmill">sawmill</a> in <a href="Jaklovce">Jaklovce</a> and lived in <a href="Trnava">Trnava</a>. In September 1941 the <a href="Slovak%20Republic%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29">Slovak Republic</a>, under the rule of President <a href="Jozef%20Tiso">Jozef Tiso</a>—and a client state of Nazi Germany—passed a "Jewish Codex", similar to the <a href="Nuremberg%20Laws">Nuremberg Laws</a>, which introduced restrictions on Jews' education, housing and travel. The government set up labour camps at <a href="Nov%C3%A1ky">Nováky</a>, <a href="Sere%C4%8F%20concentration%20camp">Sereď</a> and <a href="Vyhne">Vyhne</a>. Jews were required to wear a <a href="yellow%20badge">yellow badge</a> and live in certain areas, and available jobs went first to non-Jews. When Vrba was excluded, at age 15, from the <a href="Gymnasium%20%28school%29">gymnasium</a> (high school) in <a href="Bratislava">Bratislava</a> as a result of the restrictions, he found work as a labourer and continued his studies at home, particularly chemistry, English and Russian. He met his future wife, <a href="%23Gerti%20Sidonovi">Gerti Sidonovi</a>, around this time. She and Vrba were among a group of Jewish teenagers excluded from school who would meet up in a meadow outside town called "the pond" to talk about <a href="Zionism">Zionism</a> and the <a href="antisemitism">antisemitism</a> they faced.
Vrba learned to live with most of the restrictions; they had been "introduced discreetly, falling almost imperceptibly around us, like gentle snow", he wrote. But he rebelled when the Slovak government announced, in February 1942, that 20,000 Jewish workers were to be deported to "reservations" in German-occupied Poland. The deportations came at the request of Germany, which needed the labour. Slovakia paid the Germans RM 500 per Jew in exchange for a deal that the Slovak government could lay claim to the deportees' property. (Only around 300 of the 58,000 Slovakian Jews who were deported between March and October 1942 survived.) For the rest of his life, Vrba blamed the <a href="Slovak%20Jewish%20Council">Slovak Jewish Council</a> for having cooperated with the deportations.

Insisting that he would not be "deported like a calf in a wagon", he decided to join the <a href="Czechoslovak%20government-in-exile">Czechoslovak Army in exile</a> in England and set off in a taxi for the border, aged 17, with a map, a box of matches, and the equivalent of ₤10 from his mother. After making his way to Budapest, Hungary, he decided to return to Trnava for various reasons, but he was arrested at the Hungarian border, he wrote, "for being Jewish". The Slovak authorities sent him to the Nováky transit camp for Jews awaiting deportation; he escaped briefly but was caught by a gendarme who asked for his documents when he noticed Vrba was wearing two pairs of socks. Returned to the camp, he was beaten by <a href="Hlinka%20Guard">Hlinka guard</a>s. An SS officer instructed that he be deported on the next transport.

Vrba was deported from Czechoslovakia on 15 June 1942 to the <a href="Majdanek%20concentration%20camp">Majdanek concentration camp</a> in <a href="Occupation%20of%20Poland%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29">occupied Poland</a>, where he briefly encountered his older brother, Sammy. They saw each other "almost simultaneously and we raised our arms in brief salute"; it was the last time he ever saw him. He also encountered "<a href="Kapo%20%28concentration%20camp%29">kapo</a>s" for the first time: prisoners appointed to police other prisoners, one of whom he recognized from Trnava. Most wore green triangles, signalling that they had been categorized as professional criminals ("Berufsverbrecher"):

On arrival, Vrba's head and body were shaved, and he was given clothes, wooden shoes and a cap. Caps had to be removed whenever an SS man came within three yards. At roll call each morning, prisoners who had died during the night were piled up behind the living. Vrba was given a job as a builder's labourer inside the camp; it was several days before he understood the significance of the building with the tall chimney. Toward the end of June one of the kapos asked for 400 volunteers for farm work elsewhere. Vrba signed up eagerly, anxious to leave or find a chance to escape. A Czech kapo who had befriended Vrba hit him when he learned that Vrba had volunteered; he explained that the "farm work" was in Auschwitz.

On 29 June 1942, the <a href="Reich%20Main%20Security%20Office">Reich Main Security Office</a> transferred Vrba and the other volunteers to <a href="Auschwitz%20I">Auschwitz I</a>, the main camp ("Stammlager") in <a href="O%C5%9Bwi%C4%99cim">Oświęcim</a> and the administrative centre of the Auschwitz camp complex. Vrba considered trying to escape from the train on the way there, a journey of over two days, but the SS said that ten men would be shot for every one man who went missing.

On his second day in Auschwitz, he watched as a cart pulled by Ukrainian prisoners stopped outside a windowless building. Two Polish prisoners emerged, and began throwing bodies onto the cart, stacked in piles of ten, "the head of one between the legs of another to save space. Slap, slap, slap"; after 15 minutes, 200 bodies had been stacked on top of one another neatly. The following day Vrba and around 400 other men were beaten into a cold shower in a shower room built for 30, then marched outside to register, still naked. The prisoners were tattooed—Vrba on his left forearm as prisoner no. 44070—and given striped tunics, trousers, caps and wooden shoes. After registration, which took all day and into the evening, he was shown to his new barracks, an attic in a block next to the main gate and the "<a href="Arbeit%20macht%20frei">Arbeit macht frei</a>" sign.

Young and strong, Vrba was "purchased" by a kapo, Frank, in exchange for a lemon (sought after for its <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a>), and assigned to work in the SS food store. This gave him access to soap and water—the SS expected those handling their food to be clean—which helped to save his life. Frank, he learned, was a kind man who would pretend to beat his prisoners when the guards were watching, although the blows always missed. The camp regime was otherwise marked by its pettiness and cruelty. When <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a> visited on 17 July 1942 (during which he watched a gassing), the inmates were told everything had to be spotless. An orchestra of prisoners assembled by the gate, waiting for a sign that he was about to arrive:

In August 1942 Vrba was reassigned to the "Aufräumungskommando" (the "clearing" commando, also known as the "Canada commando") in <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp%23Birkenau">Auschwitz II-Birkenau</a>, the extermination camp in <a href="Brzezinka">Brzezinka</a>, four kilometres (2.5 miles) from the main camp. Around 200–800 prisoners worked there on the "Judenrampe", where trains carrying Jews arrived, removing the dead from the freight cars and clearing out any blood and excrement, then sorting through the new arrivals' property. Many would bring kitchen utensils and clothes for different seasons, suggesting to Vrba that they believed the stories about resettlement. It took 2–3 hours to clear out the freight cars, by which time most of the new arrivals were already dead. A few were selected to work as slave labour, but those deemed unfit for work were taken by truck in groups of 100 to the gas chamber, including children, women with children, the elderly and the sick. He estimated that 90 percent were selected to die.

Vrba told <a href="Claude%20Lanzmann">Claude Lanzmann</a> in 1978 that the process relied on speed and making sure no panic broke out among the new arrivals, because panic meant "a hitch in the machinery", and the next transport would have been delayed.

The new arrivals' property was taken to storage facilities known as "Effektenlager I and II"; inmates called them Canada/Kanada I and II because they were a "land of plenty". The Canada barracks were in Auschwitz I before Vrba's escape but were later moved to the BIIg section of Birkenau. Everything was there: medicine, food, clothing, utensils, spectacles, gold, dollars and pounds, much of it repackaged by the "Aufräumungskommando" to be sent to Germany. It was because of this access that Vrba was able to stay healthy.

The "Aufräumungskommando" lived in Auschwitz I, block 4, until 15 January 1943, when they were transferred to block 16 in Auschwitz II, sector Ib, where Vrba lived until June 1943. After he had been in Auschwitz for about five months, he fell sick with <a href="typhus">typhus</a>; his weight dropped to 42 kilos and he was delirious. At his lowest point, he was helped by Josef Farber, a Slovakian member of the camp's resistance movement, who brought him medication and thereafter extended to him the protection of the Auschwitz underground.
In early 1943 he was given the job of assistant registrar in one of the blocks; he told Lanzmann that the resistance movement had manoeuvered him into the position because it gave him access to information. A few weeks later, in June, he was made registrar ("Blockschreiber") of block 10 in Birkenau, the quarantine section for men (BIIa), again because of the underground. The position gave him his own room and bed, and he could wear his own clothes. He was also able to speak to new arrivals who had been selected as slave labour, and he had to write reports about the registration process, which allowed him to ask questions and take notes.

From his room in BIIa, Vrba could see the lorries drive towards the gas chambers. In his estimate, 10 percent of each transport was selected to work and the rest killed. During his time on the "Judenrampe" from 18 August 1942 to 7 June 1943, he saw at least 200 trains arrive, each containing 1,000–5,000 people, according to an interview in 1978 for the documentary film "<a href="Shoah%20%28film%29">Shoah</a>" (1985). In a 1998 paper, he wrote that he had witnessed 100–300 trains arrive, each locomotive pulling 20–40 freight cars and sometimes 50–60. He calculated that, between the spring of 1942 and 15 January 1944, 1.5 million had been killed. According to the Vrba–Wetzler report, 1,765,000 were killed in Auschwitz between April 1942 and April 1944. In 1961 Vrba swore in an affidavit for the <a href="trial%20of%20Adolf%20Eichmann">trial of Adolf Eichmann</a> that he believed 2.5 million had died overall in the camp, plus or minus 10 percent.

Vrba's estimates are higher than those of Holocaust historians, but in line with estimates from SS officers and Auschwitz survivors, including members of the "Sonderkommando". Early estimates ranged from 1 to 6.5 million. <a href="Rudolf%20H%C3%B6ss">Rudolf Höss</a>, the longest-serving Auschwitz commandant, said in 1946 that three million had died in the camp, although he revised his view later. In 1946 the <a href="Main%20Commission%20for%20the%20Investigation%20of%20German%20Crimes%20in%20Poland">Main Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in Poland</a> estimated four million. Later scholarly estimates were lower. According to Polish historian <a href="Franciszek%20Piper">Franciszek Piper</a>, writing in 1995, most historians place the figure at 1 to 1.5 million. His own estimate was that 1,082,000 died in Auschwitz between 1940 and 1945, rounded up to 1.1 million, which he regards as the minimum. He calculated that nearly 88 percent of those deported to Auschwitz were killed, against Vrba's 90 percent. Piper's estimate of the death toll for the period April 1942 to April 1944 was 450,000, against Vrba's 1,765,000. <a href="Yad%20Vashem">Yad Vashem</a> places the figure at 1.2 million, including 1.1 million Jews.

According to Vrba, a <a href="Kapo%20%28concentration%20camp%29">kapo</a> by the name of Yup, a former trade unionist from Berlin, told him on 15 January 1944 that he was part of a group of prisoners building a new railway line to lead straight into the crematoria. Yup said he had overheard from an SS officer that a million Hungarian Jews would soon arrive and that the old ramp could not handle the numbers. A railway line leading directly to the crematoria would cut thousands of truck journeys from the old ramp. In addition Vrba heard directly, courtesy of drunk SS guards, he wrote, that they would soon have Hungarian salami. When Dutch Jews arrived, they brought cheese; likewise there were sardines from the French Jews, and halva and olives from the Greeks. Now it was Hungarian salami. Vrba wrote: "I believed that if I could escape and spread the news of the fate awaiting potential candidates for 'resettlement', I could make some significant difference. I felt that I might undermine one of the principle foundations—the secrecy of the operation—upon which the success of the mass-murder process rested."

Vrba had been thinking of escape for two years but was now determined. A Russian captain, Dmitri Volkkov, advised him: he would need Russian tobacco soaked in petrol, then dried, to fool the dogs; a watch, which he could use as a compass; matches to make food; and salt, because salt and potatoes would be nutrition enough. Vrba began studying the layout of the camps. Both Auschwitz I and II consisted of inner camps where the prisoners slept, surrounded by a six-yard-wide trench full of water and high-voltage barbed-wire fences. The area was lit at night and guarded by the SS in watch towers. When a prisoner was reported missing, the guards searched for three days and nights. He reasoned that the key to a successful escape would be to remain hidden just outside the inner perimeter until the search was called off.

His first escape was planned for 26 January 1944 with Charles Unglick, a French Army captain, but the rendezvous did not work out; Unglick tried to escape alone and was killed. The SS left his body on display for two days, seated on a stool. An earlier group of escapees had been killed and mutilated with <a href="Expanding%20bullet">dumdum bullet</a>s, then placed in the middle of Camp D with a sign reading "We're back!"

On 6 March 1944 Vrba heard that the <a href="Czech%20family%20camp">Czech family camp</a> was about to be sent to the gas chambers. The group of around 5,000, including women and children, had arrived in Auschwitz in September 1943 from the <a href="Theresienstadt%20concentration%20camp">Theresienstadt concentration camp</a> in <a href="Terez%C3%ADn">Terezín</a>, <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> (the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a> since 1993). That they had been allowed to live in Auschwitz for six months was unusual, not least because most women with children were killed immediately. Correspondence found after the war between Adolf Eichmann's office and the <a href="International%20Committee%20of%20the%20Red%20Cross">International Red Cross</a> suggested that the Germans had set up the family camp as a model for a planned Red Cross visit to Auschwitz. The group was housed in relatively good conditions in block BIIb near the main gate, although in the six months they were held there 1,000 died despite the better conditions. They did not have their heads shaved, and the children were given lessons and access to better food, including milk and white bread.

After warning <a href="Fredy%20Hirsch">Fredy Hirsch</a>, supervisor of the group's children's barracks, that they were about to be killed, Vrba urged him to organize an uprising, but Hirsch died shortly thereafter of a <a href="barbiturate">barbiturate</a> overdose. On 7 March, according to the Vrba–Wetzler report, the group of 3,791 was gassed, except for 11 twins kept alive for <a href="Medical%20experiments%20at%20Auschwitz">medical experiments</a>; according to <a href="Martin%20Gilbert">Martin Gilbert</a>, 15 others also survived. A week before the gassing, the group had been told to write postdated postcards to relatives, explaining how they were doing and asking for food parcels. On or around 20 December 1943 a second Czech family group was placed in quarantine. Vrba assumed they would be killed in June 1944.

Vrba resolved again to escape. In Birkenau he had encountered an acquaintance from Trnava, <a href="Alfr%C3%A9d%20Wetzler">Alfréd Wetzler</a> (prisoner no. 29162, then aged 26) who had arrived in Auschwitz on 13 April 1942 and was working in the mortuary. <a href="Czes%C5%82aw%20Mordowicz">Czesław Mordowicz</a>, who escaped from Auschwitz weeks after Vrba, said decades later that it was Wetzler who had initiated and planned the escape.

According to Wetzler, writing in 1963 (and using pseudonyms), the camp underground had organized the escape, supplying information for Vrba and Wetzler to carry. "Otta" in Hut 18, a locksmith, had created a key for a small shed in which Vrba and others had drawn a site plan and dyed clothes. "Fero" from the central registry supplied data from the registry; "Filipek" (<a href="Filip%20M%C3%BCller">Filip Müller</a>) in Hut 13 added the names of the SS officers working around the crematoria, a plan of the gas chambers and crematoria, his records of the transports gassed in crematoria IV and V, and the label of a <a href="Zyklon%20B">Zyklon B</a> canister. "Edek" in Hut 14 smuggled out clothes for the escapees to wear, including suits from Amsterdam. "Adamek", "Bolek" and Vrba had supplied socks, underpants, shirts, glucose, a razor, torch, vitamins, margarine, cigarettes and a cigarette lighter that said "made in Auschwitz". The information about the camp, including a sketch of the crematorium produced by a Russian prisoner, "Wasyl", was hidden inside two metal tubes. The tube containing the sketch was lost during the escape; the second tube contained data about the transports. Vrba's account differs from Wetzel's; according to Vrba, they took no notes and wrote the Vrba–Wetzler report from memory. He told the historian <a href="John%20S.%20Conway%20%28historian%29">John Conway</a> that he had used "personal memotechnical methods" to remember the data, and that the stories about written notes had been invented because no one could explain his ability to recall so much detail.
Wearing suits, overcoats, and boots, at 14:00 on Friday, 7 April 1944—the eve of <a href="Passover">Passover</a>—the men climbed inside a hollowed-out space they had prepared in a pile of wood stacked between Auschwitz-Birkenau's inner and outer perimeter fences, in section BIII in a construction area known as "Meksyk" ("Mexico"). They sprinkled the area with Russian tobacco soaked in gasoline, as advised by Dmitri Volkov, the Russian captain. Bolek and Adamek, both Polish prisoners, moved the planks back in place once they were hidden.

Kárný writes that at 20:33 on 7 April "SS-Sturmbannführer" <a href="Fritz%20Hartjenstein">Fritz Hartjenstein</a>, the Birkenau commander, learned by teleprinter that two Jews were missing. On 8 April the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> at Auschwitz sent telegrams with descriptions to the <a href="Reich%20Security%20Head%20Office">Reich Security Head Office</a> in Berlin, the SS in Oranienburg, district commanders, and others. The men hid in the wood pile for three nights and throughout the fourth day; they knew from escape attempts by others that the guards would search for three days. Soaking wet, with strips of flannel tightened across their mouths to muffle coughing, they lay there counting: "[N]early eighty hours. Four thousand eight hundred minutes. Two hundred and eighty-eight thousand seconds." On the Sunday morning, 9 April, Adamek urinated against the pile and whistled to signal that all was well. At 9 pm on 10 April, they crawled out of the wood pile. "Their circulation returns only slowly," Wetzel wrote. "They both have the sensation of ants running along in their veins, that their bodies have been transformed into big, very slowly warming ant-heaps. ... The onset of weakness is so fierce that they have to support themselves on the inner edges of the panels." Using a map they'd taken from "Canada", the men headed south toward Slovakia away, walking parallel to the <a href="So%C5%82a">Soła</a> river.

According to Henryk Swiebocki of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum, local people, including members of the Polish underground who lived near the camp, did what they could to help escapees. Vrba wrote that there was no organized help for them on the outside. At first the men avoided contact with other people, moving only at night; they ate bread they'd taken from Auschwitz and drank water from streams. On 13 April, lost in <a href="Bielsko-Biala">Bielsko-Biala</a>, they knocked on the door of a farmhouse and a Polish woman took them in for a day. Feeding them bread, potato soup and <a href="Coffee%20substitute">"ersatz" coffee</a>, she explained that most of the area had been <a href="Germanisation%20in%20Poland%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29">"Germanized"</a> and that Poles helping Jews risked death.

They continued following the river; every so often, a Polish woman would drop half a loaf of bread near them. They were shot at on 16 April by German <a href="Gendarmerie">gendarmes</a> but managed to lose them. Two other Poles helped them with food and a place to stay, until they finally crossed the Polish–Slovakian border near <a href="Skalit%C3%A9">Skalité</a> on 21 April 1944. By this time, Vrba's feet were so swollen he had had to cut off his boots, and was walking in a pair of slippers one of the Polish peasants had given him.

A peasant family in Skalité took them in for a few days, fed and clothed them, then put them in touch with a Jewish doctor in nearby <a href="%C4%8Cadca">Čadca</a>, Dr. Pollack. Vrba had met Pollack before, in a transit camp in <a href="Nov%C3%A1ky">Nováky</a>. Through a contact in the <a href="Slovak%20Jewish%20Council">Slovak Jewish Council</a>, Pollack arranged for them to send people from <a href="Bratislava">Bratislava</a> to meet the men. Pollack was distressed to learn the probable fate of his parents and siblings, who had been deported from Slovakia to Auchwitz in 1942.

Vrba and Wetzler spent the night in Čadca in the home of a relative of the rabbi <a href="Leo%20Baeck">Leo Baeck</a>, before being take to <a href="%C5%BDilina">Žilina</a> by train, where they were met at the station by Erwin Steiner, a member of the Jewish Council, and taken to the Jewish Old People's Home, where the council had offices. Over the following days, they were introduced to Ibolya Steiner (who was married to Erwin); Oskar Krasniansky, an engineer and stenographer (who later took the name Oskar Isaiah Karmiel), and, on 25 April, the chairman of the council, Dr. <a href="Oskar%20Neumann">Oskar Neumann</a>, a lawyer. In his memoir, Wetzler described (using pseudonyms) several people who attended the first meeting: a lawyer (presumably Neumann), a factory worker, a "Madame Ibi" (Ibolya Steiner) who had been a functionary in a progressive youth organization, and the Prague correspondent of a Swiss newspaper. The lawyer told them the group had been waiting two years for someone to confirm the rumours they had heard about Auschwitz. Wetzler was surprised by the naïvety of the lawyer's question: "Is it so difficult to get out [of] there?" The journalist wanted to know how they had managed it, if it was so hard. Wetzler felt Vrba lean forward angrily to say something, but he grabbed his hand and Vrba drew back.

Wetzler encouraged Vrba to start describing conditions in Auschwitz: "He wants to speak like a witness, nothing but facts, but the terrible events sweep him along like a torrent, he relives them with his nerves, with every pore of his body, so that after an hour he is completely exhausted." The group, in particular the Swiss journalist, seemed to have difficulty understanding. The journalist wondered why the International Red Cross had not intervened. "The more [Vrba] reports, the angrier and more embittered he becomes." The journalist asked Vrba to tell them about "specific bestialities by the SS men". Vrba replied: "That is as if you wanted me to tell you of a specific day when there was water in the Danube."

Vrba described the ramp, the "<a href="Sonderkommando">Sonderkommando</a>" and the camps' internal organization; how Jews were being used as slave labour for <a href="Krupp">Krupp</a>, <a href="Siemens%20AG">Siemens</a>, <a href="IG%20Farben">IG Farben</a> and <a href="Deutsche%20Ausr%C3%BCstungswerke">DAW</a>; and the mass murder in gas chambers of those chosen for "<a href="Sonderbehandlung">Sonderbehandlung</a>" ("special treatment"), including the destruction of the Czech family camp. Wetzler gave them the data from the central registry hidden in the remaining tube, described the medical experiments, and listed the names of the doctors involved in them. "Every word", he wrote, "has the effect of a blow on the head."

The lawyer said the men would be brought a typewriter in the morning, and the group would meet again in three days. Hearing this, Vrba exploded: "Easy for you to say 'in three days'! But back there they are flinging people into the fire at this moment and in three days they'll kill thousands. Do something immediately!" Wetzler pulled on his arm, but Vrba continued, pointing at each one: "You, you, you'll all finish up in the gas unless something is done! Do you hear?"

The following day, Vrba began by sketching the layout of Auschwitz I and II, and the position of the ramp in relation to the camps. The report was written and re-written several times over three days; according to Wetzler, on two of those days, he and Vrba wrote until daybreak. Wetzler wrote the first part, Vrba the third, and they worked on the second part together. They then re-wrote it six times. Oskar Krasniansky translated it from Slovak into German as it was being written, with the help of Ibolya Steiner, who typed it up. The original Slovak version is lost. The report was completed by Thursday, 27 April 1944; according to Vrba, it was also translated at that point into Hungarian.

The report contains a detailed description of the geography and management of the camps; how the prisoners lived and died; and the transports that had arrived at Auschwitz since 1942, their place of origin, and the numbers "selected" for work or the gas chambers. According to Kárný, the report describes the camp "with absolute accuracy", including its construction, installations, security, the prisoner number system, the categories of prisoner, the diet and accommodation, as well as the gassings, shootings and injections. It provides details known only to prisoners, including, for example, that discharge forms were filled out for prisoners who were gassed, indicating that death rates in the camp were actively falsified. Although presented by two men, it was clearly the product of many prisoners, including the "Sonderkommando" working in the gas chambers.

It also contains sketches and information about the layout of the gas chambers, and states that there were four crematoria in operation, each of which contained a gas chamber and furnace room. It estimates the total capacity of the four gas chambers and crematoria at Auschwitz to be 6,000 daily.

In a sworn deposition for the trial of "<a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a>-<a href="Obersturmbannf%C3%BChrer">Obersturmbannführer</a>" Adolf Eichmann in 1961, and in his book "I Cannot Forgive" (1963), Vrba said that he and Wetzler had obtained the information about the gas chambers and crematoria from "Sonderkommando" <a href="Filip%20M%C3%BCller">Filip Müller</a> and his colleagues who worked there. Müller confirmed this in his "Eyewitness Auschwitz" (1979). Auschwitz scholar <a href="Robert%20Jan%20van%20Pelt">Robert Jan van Pelt</a> wrote in 2002 that the description contains errors, but that given the circumstances, including the men's lack of architectural training, "one would become suspicious if it did not contain errors".

Arnost Rosin (prisoner no. 29858) and <a href="Czes%C5%82aw%20Mordowicz">Czesław Mordowicz</a> (prisoner no. 84216) escaped from Auschwitz on 27 May 1944 and arrived in Slovakia on 6 June, the day of the <a href="Normandy%20Landings">Normandy landings</a>. Hearing about the <a href="invasion%20of%20Normandy">invasion of Normandy</a> and believing the war was over, they got drunk to celebrate, using dollars they had smuggled out of Auschwitz. They were promptly arrested for violating the currency laws, and spent eight days in prison before the Jewish Council paid their fines.

Rosin and Mordowicz already knew Vrba and Wetzler; Vrba wrote that anyone who survived more than a year in Auschwitz was a senior member of the "old hands Mafia". On 15 June Rosin and Mordowicz were interviewed by Oskar Krasniansky, the engineer who had translated the Vrba–Wetzler report into German. They told him that, between 15 and 27 May 1944, 100,000 Hungarian Jews had arrived at Birkenau; most were killed on arrival. Vrba concluded that the Vrba–Wetzler report had been suppressed. Mordowicz was arrested again in Bratislava and ended up back inside Auschwitz, but the SS did not recognize him and both he and Rosin survived the war. The seven-page Rosin-Mordowicz report was later combined with the longer Vrba–Wetzler report and a third report, known as the Polish Major's report (written by <a href="Jerzy%20Tabeau">Jerzy Tabeau</a>, who had escaped from Auchwitz in November 1943), to become the <a href="Auschwitz%20Protocols">Auschwitz Protocols</a>.

The Jewish Council found two rented apartments for Vrba, Wetzler, Rosin and Mordowicz in <a href="Liptovsk%C3%BD%20Mikul%C3%A1%C5%A1">Liptovský Svätý Mikuláš</a>, Slovakia; the men kept a copy of the Vrba–Wetzler report, in <a href="Slovak%20language">Slovak</a>, hidden in one of the apartments behind a picture of the Virgin Mary. They made clandestine copies with the help of a friend, Josef Weiss of the Bratislava Office for the Prevention of Venereal Disease, and handed them out to Jews in Slovakia with contacts in Hungary, for translation into Hungarian. Vrba wrote that one of these copies "found its way to Switzerland and Bern (via Moshe Krausz, director of the Palestine Office in Budapest) and was smuggled to George Mandel-Mantello, a Hungarian Jew living in Switzerland, who managed to have parts of the abbreviated "Report" published."

The dates on which the report was distributed became a matter of importance within Holocaust historiography. According to <a href="Randolph%20L.%20Braham">Randolph L. Braham</a>, Jewish leaders were slow to distribute the report, fearful of causing panic. Vrba alleged that lives were lost because of this. In particular he blamed <a href="Rudolf%20Kastner">Rudolf Kastner</a> of the Budapest <a href="Aid%20and%20Rescue%20Committee">Aid and Rescue Committee</a> ("Vaada"). The committee had organized safe passage for Jews into Hungary before the German invasion, and thereafter sought to help them escape the deportations. The Slovak Jewish Council handed Kastner the report at the end of April or by 3 May at the latest. According to Braham, Kastner had a copy when he paid a visit to <a href="Kolozsv%C3%A1r">Kolozsvár</a> (Cluj), his home town, on 3 May. but it was not until the second half of June 1944 that Jewish leaders in Hungary distributed the report widely to government and church leaders. This despite the fact that deportations of Jews from Hungary began on 19 May at a rate of 12,000 a day.

Reverend József Éliás, head of the Good Shepherd Mission in Hungary, said he had received the report by late April or early May from Géza Soós, a Hungarian Foreign Ministry official and leading member of the Hungarian Independence Movement, a resistance group. Bauer believes that Kastner (or possibly Otto Komoly, leader of the "Vaada") gave Soós the report. Éliás's secretary, Mária Székely, translated it into Hungarian and prepared six copies. These copies made their way to several Hungarian and church officials, including <a href="Mikl%C3%B3s%20Horthy">Miklós Horthy</a>'s daughter-in-law, Countess <a href="Ilona%20Edelsheim-Gyulai">Ilona Edelsheim-Gyulai</a>. Braham writes that this distribution occurred before 15 May.
Kastner's reasons for not distributing the report further are unknown. <a href="%23Vrba%27s%20allegations">Vrba argued until the end of his life</a> that Kastner withheld it in order not to jeopardize negotiations between the "Vaada" and <a href="Adolf%20Eichmann">Adolf Eichmann</a>, the SS officer in charge of the transport of Jews out of Hungary. As the Vrba–Wetzler report was being written, Eichmann had proposed to the "Vaada" in Budapest that the SS trade up to one million Hungarian Jews for 10,000 trucks and other goods from the Western Allies. The proposal came to nothing, but Kastner collected donations to pay the SS to allow over 1,600 Jews to leave Budapest for Switzerland on what became known as the <a href="Kastner%20train">Kastner train</a>. In Vrba's view, Kastner suppressed the report in order not to alienate the SS.

The Hungarian biologist <a href="George%20Klein%20%28biologist%29">George Klein</a> worked as a junior secretary for the Jewish Council in Síp Street, Budapest, in 1944 when he was a teenager. In late May or early June, his boss, Dr. Zoltán Kohn, showed him a <a href="carbon%20copy">carbon copy</a> of the Vrba–Wetzler report in Hungarian and said he should tell only his closest family and friends. Klein had heard Jews mention the term "Vernichtungslager" (extermination camp), but it had seemed like a myth. "I immediately believed the report because it made sense," he wrote in 2011. "Nothing else made sense. The dry, factual, nearly scientific language, the dates, the numbers, the maps and the logic of the narrative coalesced into a solid and inexorable structure." Klein told his uncle, a well-known physician, who nearly hit him and asked how Klein could believe such nonsense: "I and others in the building in Síp Street must have lost our minds under the pressure." It was the same with other relatives and friends: middle-aged men with property and family did not believe it, while the younger ones wanted to act. In October that year, when the time came for Klein to board a train to Auschwitz, he ran instead.

The report was first published in Geneva on 17 May 1944, in German, by <a href="Abraham%20Silberschein">Abraham Silberschein</a> of the <a href="World%20Jewish%20Congress">World Jewish Congress</a> as "Tatsachenbericht über Auschwitz und Birkenau". Florian Manoliu of the Romanian Legation in Bern took the report to Switzerland and gave it to <a href="George%20Mantello">George Mantello</a>, a Jewish businessman from Transylvania, who was working as the first secretary of the El Salvador consulate in Geneva. It was thanks to Mantello that the report received, in the Swiss press, its first wide coverage. According to <a href="David%20Kranzler">David Kranzler</a>, Mantello asked the Swiss-Hungarian Students' League to make 50 mimeographed copies of the Vrba–Wetzler report and two shorter Auschwitz reports (jointly known as the <a href="Auschwitz%20Protocols">Auschwitz Protocols</a>), which by 23 June 1944 he had distributed to the Swiss government and Jewish groups. The students made thousands of copies, which were passed to other students and MPs. At least 383 articles about Auschwitz appeared in the Swiss press between 23 June and 11 July 1944. According to <a href="Michael%20Fleming%20%28historian%29">Michael Fleming</a>, "[t]his figure exceeds the number of articles published about the Holocaust during the entire war in "The Times", the "Daily Telegraph", the "Manchester Guardian" and the whole of the British popular press."

On 19 June Richard Lichtheim of the Jewish Agency in Geneva, who had received a copy of the report from Mantello, cabled the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem to say that they knew "what has happened and where it has happened", and reported the Vrba–Wetzler figure that 90 per cent of Jews arriving at Birkenau were being killed.

At the request of the Slovakian Jewish Council, Vrba and <a href="Czes%C5%82aw%20Mordowicz">Czesław Mordowicz</a> (one of the <a href="%23Rosin">27 May escapees</a>), along with a translator and Oskar Krasniasnky, met <a href="Holy%20See">Vatican</a> Swiss legate Monsignor Mario Martilotti at the <a href="Sv%C3%A4t%C3%BD%20Jur">Svätý Jur</a> monastery on 20 June. Martilotti had seen the report and questioned the men about it for six hours. Mordowicz was irritated by Vrba during this meeting. In an interview in the 1990s for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, he said Vrba, who was 19 at the time, had behaved cynically and childishly; at one point he appeared to mock the way Martilotti was <a href="Cigar%20cutter">cutting his cigar</a>. Mordowicz feared that the behaviour would make their information seem less credible. In an effort to maintain Martilotti's attention, he told him that Catholics and Catholic priests were being murdered along with the Jews. Martilotti reportedly fainted, shouting "Mein Gott! Mein Gott!" Possibly as a result of that meeting, on 25 June <a href="Pope%20Pius%20XII">Pope Pius XII</a> sent a telegram directly to Miklós Horthy asking him to ensure that "the sufferings ... endured by a large number of unfortunate people, because of their nationality or race, may not be extended or aggravated".

Also at the Jewish Council's request, Vrba and Mordowicz met <a href="Michael%20Dov%20Weissmandl">Michael Dov Weissmandl</a>, an <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox</a> rabbi and one of the leaders of the <a href="Bratislava%20Working%20Group">Bratislava Working Group</a>, at his <a href="Yeshiva">Yeshiva</a> in the centre of Bratislava. Vrba writes that Weissmandl was clearly well-informed and had seen the Vrba–Wetzler report. He had also seen, as Vrba found out after the war, the Polish Major's Report about Auschwitz. Weissmandl asked what could be done:

Weissmandl also wanted to know what should be done militarily. Hoping he had some influence, Vrba explained that the railway lines into Birkenau should be bombed. (Weissmandl had already suggested this, on 16 May 1944 in a message to the American Orthodox Jewish Rescue committee.) Vrba wrote about the incongruity of visiting Weissmandl at his Yeshiva, which he assumed could exist only because it was under the protection of the Slovak government and the Germans. "The visibility of Yeshiva life in the center of Bratislava, less than 150 miles south of Auschwitz, was in my eyes a typical piece of Goebbels–inspired activity as well as both a tragic and comic deception. There—before the eyes of the world—the pupils of Rabbi Weissmandel could study the rules of Jewish ethics while their own sisters and mothers were being murdered and burned in Birkenau."

Details from the Vrba–Wetzler report began to appear elsewhere in the media. On 4 June 1944 the "New York Times" reported on the "cold-blooded murder" of Hungary's Jews. On 16 June the "<a href="Jewish%20Chronicle">Jewish Chronicle</a>" in London ran a story by Isaac Gruenbaum of the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem with the headline "Bomb death camps"; the writer had clearly seen the Vrba–Wetzler report. Also on 16 June the BBC's German service reported the murder in March of the Czech family camp, and mentioned the second Czech group the Vrba–Wetzler report indicated would be killed on or around 20 June, with a warning that "[a]ll those responsible for such massacres from top downwards will be called to account." A 22-line story on page five of the "New York Times", "Czechs report massacre", reported on 20 June that 7,000 Jews had been "dragged to gas chambers in the notorious German concentration camps at Birkenau and <a href="O%C5%9Bwi%C4%99cim">Oświęcim</a> [Auschwitz]". Walter Garrett, the Swiss correspondent, of the <a href="Exchange%20Telegraph">Exchange Telegraph</a>, a British news agency, sent four dispatches to London on 24 June with details from the report, including Vrba's estimate that 1,715,000 Jews had been murdered. Garrett received the information from George Mantello.

On 26 June the <a href="Jewish%20Telegraphic%20Agency">Jewish Telegraphic Agency</a> reported that 100,000 Hungarian Jews had been executed in gas chambers in Auschwitz. The BBC repeated this on the same day but omitted the name of the camp. The following day, as a result of the information from Garrett, the "Manchester Guardian" published two articles; the first said that Polish Jews were being gassed in Auschwitz and the second that "Information that the Germans systematically exterminating Hungarian Jews has lately become more substantial." The report mentioned the arrival "of many thousands of Jews ... at the concentration camp at Oswiecim". The "Manchester Guardian" reported on 28 June that 100,000 Hungarian Jews had been deported to Poland and gassed, but without mentioning Auschwitz.

Daniel Brigham, the "New York Times" correspondent in Geneva, published a story on 3 July, "Inquiry Confirms Nazi Death Camps", with the subtitle "1,715,000 Jews Said to Have Been Put to Death by the Germans up to April 15", and on 6 July a second, "Two Death Camps Places of Horror; German Establishments for Mass Killings of Jews Described by Swiss". According to Fleming, the <a href="BBC%20Home%20Service">BBC Home Service</a> mentioned Auschwitz as an extermination camp for the first time on 7 July 1944. It said that over "four hundred thousand Hungarian Jews [had been] sent to the concentration camp at <a href="O%C5%9Bwi%C4%99cim">Oświęcim</a>" and that most were killed in gas chambers; it added that the camp was the largest concentration camp in Poland and that gas chambers had been installed in 1942 that could kill 6,000 people a day. Fleming writes that the report was the last of nine on the 9 pm news.

Several appeals were made to Horthy, including by the Swiss government, President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, <a href="Gustaf%20V%20of%20Sweden">Gustaf V of Sweden</a> and, on 25 June, <a href="Pope%20Pius%20XII">Pope Pius XII</a>. On 26 June Richard Lichtheim of the Jewish Agency in Geneva sent a telegram to England calling on the Allies to hold members of the Hungarian government personally responsible for the killings. The cable was intercepted by the Hungarian government and shown to Prime Minister <a href="D%C3%B6me%20Szt%C3%B3jay">Döme Sztójay</a>, who passed it to Horthy. The following day John Clifford Norton, a British diplomat in Bern, cabled the British government with suggestions for action—apparently at Lichtheim's urging—which included bombing government buildings in Budapest. On 2 July American and British forces did bomb Budapest, killing 500 and dropping leaflets warning that those responsible for the deportations would be held to account after the war. Horthy ordered an end to the mass deportations on 7 July, and they stopped two days later. That the Germans had used gas chambers was confirmed on 23 July 1944, when the <a href="Majdanek%20concentration%20camp">Majdanek concentration camp</a> near Lublin, Poland, was captured by Soviet soldiers, with its gas chambers intact and 820,000 shoes.

The Vrba–Wetzler report received widespread coverage in the United States and elsewhere when <a href="John%20Pehle">John Pehle</a> of the US <a href="War%20Refugee%20Board">War Refugee Board</a> issued a 25,000-word press release after many months delay, on 25 November 1944, including a full version of the report and a preface calling it "entirely credible". Entitled "The Extermination Camps of Auschwitz (Oświęcim) and Birkenau in Upper Silesia", the release included the 33-page Vrba–Wetzler report; a six-page report from Arnost Rosin and Czesław Mordowicz, who escaped from Auschwitz on 27 May 1944; and the 19-page "Polish Major's report", written in December 1943 by a Polish escapee, <a href="Jerzy%20Tabeau">Jerzy Tabeau</a>. Jointly the three reports came to be known as the Auschwitz Protocols.

The "Washington Times Herald" said the press release was "the first American official stamp of truth to the myriad of eyewitness stories of the mass massacres in Poland", while the "New York Herald Tribune" called the Protocols "the most shocking document ever issued by a United States government agency". Pehle passed a copy to "<a href="Yank%2C%20the%20Army%20Weekly">Yank</a>" magazine, an American armed-forces publication, but the story, by Sergeant Richard Paul, was turned down as "too Semitic"; the magazine did not want to publish it, they said, because of "latent antisemitism in the Army". In June 1944 Pehle had urged <a href="John%20J.%20McCloy">John J. McCloy</a>, US <a href="United%20States%20Assistant%20Secretary%20of%20War">assistant secretary of war</a>, to bomb Auschwitz, but McCloy had said it was "impracticable". After the publication of the Protocols he tried again. McCloy replied that the camp could not be reached by bombers stationed in France, Italy or the UK, which meant that <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a>s would have to fly to Auschwitz, a journey of 2,000 miles, without an escort. McCloy told him: "The positive solution to this problem is the earliest possible victory over Germany."

After dictating the report in April 1944, Vrba and Wetzler stayed in <a href="Liptovsk%C3%BD%20Mikul%C3%A1%C5%A1">Liptovský Mikuláš</a> for six weeks, and continued to make and distribute copies of the report with the help of a friend, Joseph Weiss. Weiss worked for the Office for Prevention of Venereal Diseases in Bratislava and allowed copies to be made in the office. The Jewish Council gave Vrba papers in the name of Rudolf Vrba, showing <a href="Aryan">Aryan</a> ancestry going back three generations, and supported him financially to the tune of 200 <a href="Czechoslovak%20koruna">Slovak crowns</a> a week, equivalent to an average worker's salary; Vrba wrote that it was "sufficient to sustain me underground in Bratislava". On 29 August 1944 the Slovak Army <a href="Slovak%20National%20Uprising">rose up against the Nazis</a> and the reestablishment of Czechoslovakia was announced. Vrba joined the <a href="Slovak%20partisans">Slovak partisans</a> in September 1944 and was later awarded the Czechoslovak Medal of Bravery.

Auschwitz was liberated by the 28th and 106th corps of the <a href="1st%20Ukrainian%20Front">1st Ukrainian Front</a> of the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> on 27 January 1945; 1,200 prisoners were found in the main camp and 5,800 in Birkenau. The SS had tried to destroy the evidence, but the Red Army found what was left of four crematoria, as well as 5,525 pairs of women's shoes, 38,000 pairs of men's, 348,820 men's suits, 836,225 items of women's clothing, large numbers of carpets, utensils, toothbrushes, glasses and dentures, and seven tons of hair.

In 1945 Vrba met up with a childhood friend, Gerti Sidonovi from Tvrnava. They both wanted to study for degrees, so they took courses set up by Czechoslovakia's Department of Education for those who had missed out on schooling because of the Nazis. They moved after that to Prague, where they married in 1947; Sidonovi took the surname Vrbová, the female version of Vrba. She graduated in medicine, then went into research. In 1949 Vrba obtained a degree in chemistry (Ing. Chern.) from the <a href="Czech%20Technical%20University%20in%20Prague">Czech Technical University in Prague</a>, which earned him a postgraduate fellowship from the Ministry of Education, and in 1951 he received his doctorate (Dr. Tech. Sc.) for a thesis entitled "On the metabolism of butyric acid". The couple had two daughters: Helena (1952–1982) and Zuzana (b. 1954). Vrba undertook post-doctoral research at the <a href="Czechoslovak%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences</a>, where he received his <a href="Candidate%20of%20Sciences">C.Sc.</a> in 1956. From 1953 to 1958 he worked for <a href="Charles%20University">Charles University</a> Medical School in Prague. His marriage ended around this time.

With the marriage over and Czechoslovakia ruled by a <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>-dominated socialist government, Vrba and Vrbová both <a href="Defection">defected</a>, him to Israel and her to England with the children. Vrbová had fallen in love with an Englishman and was able to defect after being invited to an academic conference in Poland. Unable to obtain visas for her children, she returned illegally to Czechoslovakia and walked her children back over the mountains to Poland. From there they flew to Denmark with forged papers, then to London.

In 1957 Vrba became aware, when he read <a href="Gerald%20Reitlinger">Gerald Reitlinger</a>'s "The Final Solution" (1953), that the Vrba–Wetzler report had been distributed and had saved lives; he had heard something about this in or around 1951, but Reitlinger's book was the first confirmation. The following year he received an invitation to an international conference in Israel, and while there he defected too. For the next two years, he worked at the <a href="Weizmann%20Institute%20of%20Science">Weizmann Institute of Science</a> in <a href="Rehovot">Rehovot</a>. He said later that he had not been able to continue living in Israel because the same men who had, in his view, betrayed the Jewish community in Hungary were now in positions of power there. In 1960 he moved to England, where he worked for two years in the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit in Carshalton, Surrey, and seven years for the <a href="Medical%20Research%20Council%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Medical Research Council</a>. He became a <a href="British%20subject">British subject</a> by <a href="naturalization">naturalization</a> on 4 August 1966.

On 11 May 1960 <a href="Adolf%20Eichmann">Adolf Eichmann</a> was captured by the <a href="Mossad">Mossad</a> in Buenos Aires and taken to Jerusalem to <a href="Eichmann%20trial">stand trial</a>. (He was sentenced to death in December 1961.) Vrba was not called to testify because the Israeli Attorney General had apparently wanted to save the expense. Because Auschwitz was in the news, Vrba contacted the "<a href="Daily%20Herald%20%28UK%20newspaper%29">Daily Herald</a>" in London, and one of their reporters, Alan Bestic, wrote up his story, which was published in five installments over one week, beginning on 27 February 1961 with the headline "I Warned the World of Eichmann's Murders." In July 1961 Vrba submitted an affidavit to the Israeli Embassy in London, stating that, in his view, 2.5 million had died in Auschwitz, plus or minus 10 percent; the affidavit explained how he had arrived at the figure.

In 1964 Vrba testified against <a href="Robert%20Mulka">Robert Mulka</a> of the SS at the <a href="Frankfurt%20Auschwitz%20trials">Frankfurt Auschwitz trials</a>, telling the court that he had seen Mulka on the "Judenrampe" at Auschwitz-Birkenau. The court found that Vrba "made an excellent and intelligent impression" and would have been particularly observant at the time because he was planning to escape. It ruled that Mulka had indeed been on the ramp, and sentenced him to 14 years in prison.

Following the "Herald" articles, Bestic helped to write Vrba's memoir, "I Cannot Forgive" (1963), also published as "Factory of Death" (1964). Bestic's writing style was criticized; reviewing the book, <a href="Mervyn%20Jones%20%28writer%29">Mervyn Jones</a> wrote in 1964 that it has the flavour of "the juicy bit on page 63". <a href="Erich%20Kulka">Erich Kulka</a> criticized the book in 1985 for minimizing the role played by the other three escapees (Wetzler, Mordowicz and Rosin); Kulka also disagreed with Vrba regarding his criticism of Zionists, the Slovak Jewish Council, and Israel's first president. The book was published in German (1964), French (1988), Dutch (1996), Czech (1998) and Hebrew (1998). It was republished in English in 1989 as "44070: The Conspiracy of the Twentieth Century" and in 2002 as "I Escaped from Auschwitz".

Vrba moved to Canada in 1967, where he worked for the <a href="Medical%20Research%20Council%20of%20Canada">Medical Research Council of Canada</a> from 1967 to 1973, becoming a Canadian citizen in 1972. From 1973 to 1975 he was a research fellow at <a href="Harvard%20Medical%20School">Harvard Medical School</a>, focusing on cancer research, where, in 1974, he met his second wife, Robin Vrba, originally from <a href="Fall%20River">Fall River</a>, MA. They married in 1975 and returned to Vancouver, where she became a real-estate agent and he an associate professor of pharmacology at the <a href="University%20of%20British%20Columbia">University of British Columbia</a>. He worked there until the early 1990s, publishing over 50 research papers on the chemistry of the brain, diabetes and cancer.

Vrba testified in January 1985, along with <a href="Raul%20Hilberg">Raul Hilberg</a>, at the seven-week trial in Toronto of German <a href="Holocaust%20denial">Holocaust denier</a> <a href="Ernst%20Z%C3%BCndel">Ernst Zündel</a>, which ended with Zündel's conviction for knowingly publishing false material about the Holocaust. (In "<a href="R%20v%20Zundel">R v Zundel</a>" (1992), the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> upheld Zundel's appeal on free-speech grounds.) During the trial, Zündel's lawyer, <a href="Doug%20Christie%20%28lawyer%29">Doug Christie</a>, tried to undermine Vrba (and three other survivors) by requesting ever more detailed descriptions, then presenting any discrepancy as significant. According to <a href="Lawrence%20Douglas">Lawrence Douglas</a>, when Vrba said he had watched bodies burn in a pit, Christie asked how deep the pit had been; when Vrba described an SS officer climbing onto the roof of a gas chamber, Christie asked about the height and angle. When Vrba told Christie he was not willing to discuss his book unless the jury had read it, the judge swiftly corrected him: "Dr. Vrba, you are not to give orders as to what this jury will do and what you will do or not do." Christie also argued that Vrba's knowledge of the gas chambers was secondhand. According to Vrba's deposition for <a href="Adolf%20Eichmann">Adolf Eichmann</a>'s trial in 1961, he obtained information about the gas chambers and crematoria from "Sonderkommando" <a href="Filip%20M%C3%BCller">Filip Müller</a> and others who worked there, something that Müller confirmed in 1979. Christie asked whether he had seen anyone gassed. Vrba replied that he had watched people being taken into the buildings and had seen SS officers throw in gas canisters after them: "Therefore, I concluded it was not a kitchen or a bakery, but it was a gas chamber. It is possible they are still there or that there is a tunnel and they are now in China. Otherwise, they were gassed."
In the spring of 1987 the Swedish–Hungarian biochemist <a href="George%20Klein%20%28biologist%29">George Klein</a>, who <a href="%23Klein">read the Vrba–Wetzler report in 1944 as a teenager in Budapest</a> and escaped rather than board one of the trains, travelled to Vancouver to thank Vrba. He wrote about the meeting in an essay, "The Ultimate Fear of the Traveler Returning from Hell", for his book "<a href="Piet%C3%A0%20%28book%29">Pietà</a>" (1992). Klein had seen Vrba for the first time in <a href="Claude%20Lanzmann">Claude Lanzmann</a>'s film "<a href="Shoah%20%28film%29">Shoah</a>" (1985). He disagreed with Vrba about Kastner; he had seen Kastner at work and viewed him as a hero. He told Vrba how he had tried himself, in the spring of 1944, to convince others in Budapest of the report's veracity, but no one had believed him, which inclined him to the view that Vrba was wrong to argue that the Jews would have acted had they known about the death camps. Vrba said that Klein's experience illustrated his point: distributing the report via informal channels had lent it no authority.

Klein asked Vrba how he could function in the pleasant, somewhat provincial atmosphere of the University of British Columbia, where no one had any concept of what he had been through. Vrba told him about a colleague who had seen him in Lanzmann's film and asked whether what the film had discussed was true. Vrba replied: "I do not know. I was only an actor reciting my lines." "How strange," the colleague replied. "I didn't know that you were an actor. Why did they say that film was made without any actors?" Klein wrote:

Vrba's fellow escapee, <a href="Alfr%C3%A9d%20Wetzler">Alfréd Wetzler</a>, died in Bratislava, Slovakia, on 8 February 1988. Wetzler was the author of "Escape From Hell: The True Story of the Auschwitz Protocol" (2007), first published as "Čo Dante nevidel" (1963) under the pseudonym Jozef Lánik.

Vrba died of cancer, aged 81, on 27 March 2006 in hospital in Vancouver. He was survived by his first wife, Gerta Vrbová; his second wife, Robin Vrba; his daughter, Zuza Vrbová Jackson; and his grandchildren, Hannah and Jan. He was pre-deceased by his elder daughter, Dr. Helena Vrbová, who died in 1982 in Papua New Guinea during a malaria research project. Robin Vrba made a gift of Vrba's papers to the <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt%20Presidential%20Library%20and%20Museum">Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum</a> in New York.

Several documentaries have told Vrba's story, including "<a href="Genocide%20%28World%20at%20War%20Episode%29">Genocide</a>" (1973), directed by <a href="Michael%20Darlow">Michael Darlow</a> for ITV in the UK, and "Auschwitz and the Allies" (1982), directed by Rex Bloomstein and <a href="Martin%20Gilbert">Martin Gilbert</a> for the BBC. <a href="Claude%20Lanzmann">Claude Lanzmann</a> interviewed Vrba in November 1978, in New York's <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a>, for Lanzmann's nine-hour documentary on the Holocaust, "<a href="Shoah%20%28film%29">Shoah</a>" (1985). He told Lanzmann:

Vrba was also featured in "Witness to Auschwitz" (1990), directed by Robin Taylor for the CBC in Canada; "Auschwitz: The Great Escape" (2007) for the UK's Channel Five; and "Escape From Auschwitz" (2008) for PBS in the United States. <a href="George%20Klein%20%28biologist%29">George Klein</a>, the Hungarian-Swedish biologist who <a href="%23Klein">read the Vrba–Wetzler report</a> in Budapest as a teenager, and who escaped rather than board a train to Auschwitz, wrote about Vrba in his book "<a href="Piet%C3%A0%20%28book%29">Pietà</a>" (MIT Press, 1992). In 2001 <a href="Mary%20Robinson">Mary Robinson</a>, then United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and <a href="Vaclav%20Havel">Vaclav Havel</a>, then President of the Czech Republic, established the "Rudy Vrba Award" for films in the "right to know" category. In 2014 the Vrba–Weztler Memorial began organizing an annual 130-km, five-day walk from the "Mexico" section of Auschwitz, where the men hid for three days, to Žilina, Slovakia, following the route they took.

Vrba's place in Holocaust historiography was the focus of <a href="Ruth%20Linn">Ruth Linn</a>'s "Escaping Auschwitz: A Culture of Forgetting" (Cornell University Press, 2004). The Rosenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies at the City University of New York held an academic conference in April 2011 to discuss the Vrba–Wetzler and other Auschwitz reports, resulting in a book, "The Auschwitz Reports and the Holocaust in Hungary" (Columbia University Press, 2011), edited by <a href="Randolph%20L.%20Braham">Randolph L. Braham</a> and <a href="William%20vanden%20Heuvel">William vanden Heuvel</a>. In 2014 the British historian <a href="Michael%20Fleming%20%28historian%29">Michael Fleming</a> reappraised the impact of the Vrba–Wetzler report in "Auschwitz, the Allies and Censorship of the Holocaust" (Cambridge University Press, 2014).

The <a href="University%20of%20Haifa">University of Haifa</a> awarded Vrba an honorary doctorate in 1998 at the instigation of Ruth Linn, with support from <a href="Yehuda%20Bauer">Yehuda Bauer</a>. For having fought during the <a href="Slovak%20National%20Uprising">Slovak National Uprising</a>, Vrba was awarded the Czechoslovak Medal for Bravery, the Order of Slovak National Insurrection (Class 2), and the Medal of Honor of Czechoslovak Partisans. In 2007 he received the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20White%20Double%20Cross">Order of the White Double Cross</a>, 1st class, from the Slovak government.

British historian <a href="Martin%20Gilbert">Martin Gilbert</a> supported an unsuccessful campaign in 1992 to have Vrba awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20Canada">Order of Canada</a>. The campaign was supported by <a href="Irwin%20Cotler">Irwin Cotler</a>, the former Attorney General of Canada, who at the time was a professor of law at <a href="McGill%20University">McGill University</a>. Cotler wrote to Gilbert on 18 February 1992: "I fully concur with you that Vrba is a 'real hero'. Indeed, there was few more deserving of the Order of Canada than Vrba and few, anywhere, who have exhibited his moral courage." Similarly, Bauer proposed unsuccessfully that Vrba be awarded an honorary doctorate from the <a href="Hebrew%20University">Hebrew University</a>.

Vrba is clear in his memoir that warning the Hungarian community was one of the motives for his escape. In January 1944, he wrote, a kapo told him the Germans were building a new railway line to bring the Jews of Hungary to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Historians have disputed this because there is no mention of Hungarian Jews in the Vrba–Wetzler report. <a href="Miroslav%20K%C3%A1rn%C3%BD">Miroslav Kárný</a> argued in 1998 that, long after the war was over, Vrba wanted to testify about the deportations out of a sense of longing, to force the world to face the magnitude of the Nazis' crimes, and that this desire led to a degree of embellishment. <a href="Randolph%20L.%20Braham">Randolph L. Braham</a> also questioned Vrba's later recollections, although neither Kárný nor Braham doubt the veracity of the Vrba–Wetzler report.

According to the Vrba–Wetzler report, a large compound was being built at Auschwitz: "Work is now proceeding on a still larger compound which is to be added later on to the already existing camp. The purpose of this extensive planning is not known to us." It also stated: "When we left on April 7, 1944 we heard that large convoys of Greek Jews were expected." Vrba's statement that he had escaped to warn Hungarian Jews was first published on 27 February 1961, in the first installment of a five-article series for the "<a href="Daily%20Herald%20%28UK%20newspaper%29">Daily Herald</a>" in England, written up by a journalist, Alan Bestic. In the second installment, the following day, Vrba described having overheard the SS say they were looking forward to Hungarian salami, a reference to the provisions the Hungarian Jews could be expected to bring.

Dr. Oskar Neumann, head of the Jewish Council in Slovakia, whose interviews with Vrba and Wetzler in April 1944 helped to form the Vrba–Wetzler report, wrote in his memoir in 1946 ("Im Schatten des Todes", published in 1956) that the men had indeed mentioned Hungarian salami: "These chaps did also report that recently an enormous construction activity had been initiated in the camp and very recently the SS often spoke about looking forward to the arrival of Hungarian salami." Vrba wrote that the original Slovak version of the Vrba–Wetzler report, some of which he wrote by hand, may have referred to the imminent Hungarian deportations. That version of the report did not survive; it was the German translation that was copied around the world. Vrba wrote that he had argued strongly for the inclusion of the Hungarian deportations, but he recalled Oskar Krasniansky, who translated the report into German, saying that only actual deaths should be recorded, not speculation, to lend the report maximum credibility. He could not recall which argument prevailed.

Vrba also wrote that Rabbi <a href="Michael%20Dov%20Weissmandl">Michael Dov Weissmandl</a> and <a href="Gisi%20Fleischmann">Gisi Fleischmann</a> of the <a href="Slovak%20Jewish%20Council">Slovak Jewish Council</a> referred to the report and Hungarian Jews in a five-page letter sent by courier in May 1944 to a Swiss branch of <a href="HeHalutz">HeHalutz</a>, the Jewish youth movement: "In December and January a special railway line has already been built leading into the halls of annihilation, in order to prepare the new work of annihilation of Hungarian Jews. That was said by knowledgeable people there in that hell; there they discuss it without scruples, without suspecting that someone will learn about it since they assume, in general, that no one in the country knows anything whatever about the work in this hell." The letter reportedly states on page three that the sources are "two Jews recently escaped from Auschwitz".

The Vrba–Wetzler report was not distributed widely until June–July 1944, weeks after the men's escape in April. This was a source of great distress to Vrba for the rest of his life. Between 15 May and 7 July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews were deported to Auschwitz, most killed on arrival. In the epilogue of his book "I Cannot Forgive" (1963), he asks: "Why did hundreds of thousands walk without resistance to the gas chambers"? In his view, the deportees boarded the trains "hoping to land in some sort of Jewish 'reservation' or ghetto where they would have a respite from the incredibly brutal terror inflicted upon them by the Horthy regime's Hungarian Gendarmerie." Arguing that they would have run or fought had they known they were being sent to their deaths, or at least that panic would have slowed the transports, Vrba alleged that <a href="Rudolf%20Kastner">Rudolf Kastner</a> of the Budapest <a href="Aid%20and%20Rescue%20Committee">Aid and Rescue Committee</a> (who had a copy of the Vrba–Wetzler report by 3 May 1944 at the latest) had held back the report to avoid jeopardizing complex, and mostly futile, negotiations with <a href="Adolf%20Eichmann">Adolf Eichmann</a>, <a href="Dieter%20Wisliceny">Dieter Wisliceny</a> and other SS officers (including the "<a href="blood%20for%20goods">blood for goods</a>" deal) to exchange Jews for money and goods. Vrba argued that, in taking part in these negotiations, the SS was simply placating the Jewish leadership to avoid rebellion within the community.
In "I Cannot Forgive", Vrba drew attention to the 1954 trial in Jerusalem of <a href="Malchiel%20Gruenwald">Malchiel Gruenwald</a>, a Hungarian Jew who had emigrated to Palestine in 1938. In the early 1950s Gruenwald, who strongly opposed <a href="Israeli%20Labor%20Party">Mapai</a>, the party in power in Israel, began self-publishing a provocative political pamphlet, the target of which in August 1952 was Rudolf Kastner, who had become a civil servant in Israel. Kastner had bribed the SS to allow over 1,600 Jews to leave Hungary for Switzerland on the <a href="Kastner%20train">Kastner train</a> on 30 June 1944, at the height of the Holocaust in Hungary. He had also testified on behalf of one of the SS officers, <a href="Kurt%20Becher">Kurt Becher</a>, at the <a href="Nuremberg%20trials">Nuremberg trials</a>. Gruenwald called for Kastner to be "liquidated", accusing him of having collaborated with the SS so that he could escape from Hungary with a select few, including his family.

In "Attorney-General of the Government of Israel v. Malchiel Gruenwald", the Israeli government sued Gruenwald for libel on Kastner's behalf. On 22 June 1955, in a 275-page opinion, Judge <a href="Benjamin%20Halevi">Benjamin Halevi</a> (one of the judges at the trial of Adolf Eichmann) decided mostly in Gruenwald's favour, ruling that Kastner had "sold his soul to the devil". "Masses of ghetto Jews boarded the deportation trains in total obedience," Halevi wrote, "ignorant of the real destination and trusting the false declaration that they were being transferred to work camps in Hungary." The Kastner train had been a pay-off, the judge said, and the protection of certain Jews had been "an inseparable part of the maneuvers in the 'psychological war' to destroy the Jews." Kastner had "accepted the extermination of the ordinary people and abandoned them to their fates", the judge said. Israeli historian <a href="Tom%20Segev">Tom Segev</a> called the ruling "one of the most heartless in the history of Israel, perhaps the most heartless ever". <a href="Rezs%C5%91%20Kasztner%23Assassination">Kastner was assassinated</a> outside his home in Tel Aviv in March 1957 as a result of the verdict, which was partly overturned by the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Israel">Supreme Court of Israel</a> in 1958.
Vrba agreed with Gruenwald's criticism of Kastner. In addition, he blamed the <a href="Slovak%20Jewish%20Council">Slovak Jewish Council</a> for having failed to resist the deportation of Jews from Slovakia in 1942. When he was sent to the <a href="Majdanek%20concentration%20camp">Majdanek concentration camp</a> in occupied Poland in June that year, the council knew, he alleged, that Jews were being killed in Poland, but did nothing to warn the community and even assisted by drawing up lists of names. Bauer argues that the council did know that being sent to Poland meant severe danger for Jews, but at that stage did not know about the <a href="Final%20Solution">Final Solution</a>. It is true, Bauer writes, that several members of the Jewish Council under <a href="Karol%20Hochberg">Karol Hochberg</a>, head of the council's "department for special tasks", worked with the SS, offering secretarial and technical help, to draw up lists of Jews to be deported (lists supplied by the Slovak government). Other members of the Jewish Council warned Jews to flee and later formed a resistance, the <a href="Working%20Group%20%28resistance%20organization%29">Working Group</a>, which in December 1943 took over the Jewish Council, with <a href="Oskar%20Neumann">Oskar Neumann</a> (the lawyer who helped organize the Vrba–Wetzler report) as its leader.

Vrba did not accept these distinctions. He referred to Jewish leaders in Slovakia and Hungary as "<a href="quisling">quisling</a>s" who were essential to the smooth running of the deportations: "The creation of Quislings, voluntary or otherwise, was, in fact, an important featured of Nazi policy" in every occupied country, in his view. "Would anyone have got me alive to Auschwitz if I had had this information?" he wrote. "Would thousands and thousands of able-bodied Jewish men have sent their children, wives, mothers to Auschwitz from all over Europe, if they knew?"

Vrba's position that the Jewish leadership in Hungary and Slovakia had betrayed their communities was supported by the Anglo-Canadian historian <a href="John%20S.%20Conway%20%28historian%29">John S. Conway</a>, a colleague of his at the University of British Columbia, who from 1979 wrote a series of papers in defence of Vrba's views. In 1996 Vrba repeated the allegations in an article, "Die mißachtete Warnung. Betrachtungen über den Auschwitz-Bericht von 1944", in "<a href="Institute%20of%20Contemporary%20History%20%28Munich%29">Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte</a>", a prominent German academic journal, to which the Israeli historian <a href="Yehuda%20Bauer">Yehuda Bauer</a> responded. Bauer also responded to Conway in 2006.

Bauer wrote that many survivors share Vrba's and Conway's view but that is "patently wrong". Arguing that Vrba's "wild attacks on Kastner and on the Slovak underground are all a-historical and simply wrong from the start", he wrote that by the time the Vrba–Wetzler report had been prepared, it was too late for anything to alter the Nazis' deportation plans. The Jews in Hungary knew about the mass murder in Poland, he argued, even if they did not know the particulars about Auschwitz. Even if they had seen the Vrba–Wetzler report, they would have been forced onto the trains by guards with weapons and dogs. Bauer cautioned about the need to distinguish between the receipt of information and its "internalization": "During the Holocaust, countless individuals received information and rejected it, suppressed it, or rationalized about it, were thrown into despair without any possibility of acting on it, or seemingly internalized it and then behaved as though it had never reached them." Vrba, in response, alleged that Bauer was one of the Israeli historians who, in defence of the Israeli establishment, had downplayed <a href="%23Historiography">Vrba's place in Holocaust historiography</a>.

<a href="Michael%20Fleming%20%28historian%29">Michael Fleming</a> argued in 2014 against the view that Hungarian Jews had sufficient access to information. After the German invasion of Hungary in March 1944, the British government's <a href="Political%20Warfare%20Executive">Political Warfare Executive</a> (PWE) had directed the <a href="BBC%20World%20Service">BBC's Hungarian Service</a> to run Allied warnings to the German government about the deportation of people (Jews were not mentioned). The London-based "<a href="Jewish%20Chronicle">Jewish Chronicle</a>" ran a story on 7 April 1944 headlined "Zero hour in Hungary", and on 28 April the headline: "300,000 Hungarian Jews arrested—the hideous process begins". But on 13 April the PWE decided against broadcasting warnings directly to Hungarian Jews on the grounds that it would "cause unnecessary alarm" and that "they must in any case be only too well-informed of the measures that may be taken against them". Fleming writes that this was a mistake: the Germans had tricked the Jewish community into thinking they were being sent to Poland to work. The first mention of extermination camps in the PWE's directives to the BBC's Hungarian Service came on 8 June 1944.

According to <a href="Randolph%20L.%20Braham">Randolph L. Braham</a>, writing in 2011, by the time the Vrba–Wetzler report was available, the Jews of Hungary were in a helpless state: "marked, hermetically isolated, and expropriated". In northeastern Hungary and <a href="Carpatho-Ruthenia">Carpatho-Ruthenia</a>, the women, children and elderly were living in crowded ghettos, in unsanitary conditions and with little food, while the younger men were in military service in Serbia and the Ukraine. There was nothing they could have done to resist, Braham argued, even if they had known about the report.

Vrba was criticized in 2001 in a collection of articles in Hebrew, "Leadership under Duress: The Working Group in Slovakia, 1942–1944", by a group of Israeli activists and historians, including Bauer, with ties to the Slovak community. The introduction, written by a survivor, refers to the "bunch of mockers, pseudo-historians and historians" who argue that the <a href="Bratislava%20Working%20Group">Bratislava Working Group</a> collaborated with the SS, a "baseless" allegation that ignores the constraints under which the Jews in Slovakia and Hungary were living. Vrba (referred to as "Peter Vrba") is described as "the head of these mockers", although the introduction makes clear that his heroism is "beyond doubt". It concludes: "We, Czechoslovakian descendants, who personally experienced [the war] cannot remain silent in face of these false accusations."

The dispute stems in part from the tension between what Israeli scholar <a href="Ruth%20Linn">Ruth Linn</a> calls survivor and expert discourse. Vrba often dismissed the opinion of historians, arguing that they did not know enough about Auschwitz. Bauer referred to Vrba's memoir as "not a memoir in the usual sense", alleging that it "contains excerpts of conversations of which there is no chance that they are accurate and it has elements of a second-hand story that does not necessarily correspond with reality". When writing about his personal experiences, Vrba's account is an important and true one, Bauer wrote, "a document of significant historical value", but he argued that Vrba was not justified in viewing himself as an expert.

In Vrba's view, Israeli historians tried to erase his name from Holocaust historiography because of his views about Kastner and the Hungarian and Slovak Jewish Councils, some of whom went on to hold prominent positions in Israel. When Ruth Linn first tried to visit Vrba in British Columbia, he practically "chased her out of his office", according to Uri Dromi, saying he had no interest in "your state of the Judenrats and Kastners".

Linn wrote in her book about Vrba, "Escaping Auschwitz" (2004), that Vrba's and Wetzler's names had been omitted from Hebrew textbooks, or their contribution minimized: standard histories refer to the escape by "two young Slovak Jews", "two chaps", and "two young men", and represent them as emissaries of the Polish underground in Auschwitz. Dr. Oskar Neumann of the Slovak Jewish Council referred to them in his memoir as "these chaps"; Oskar Krasniansky, who translated the Vrba–Wetzler report into German, mentioned them only as "two young people" in his deposition for the <a href="Eichmann%20trial">trial of Adolf Eichmann</a> in 1961. There was also a tendency to refer to the Vrba–Wetzler report as the <a href="Auschwitz%20Protocols">Auschwitz Protocols</a>, which is a combination of the Vrba–Wetzler and two other reports. The 1990 edition of the "<a href="Encyclopedia%20of%20the%20Holocaust">Encyclopedia of the Holocaust</a>", published by <a href="Yad%20Vashem">Yad Vashem</a> in Israel, did name Vrba and Wetzler, but in the 2001 edition they are "two Jewish prisoners".

Vrba's memoir was not translated into Hebrew until 1998, 35 years after its publication in English. As of that year, there was no English or Hebrew version of the Vrba–Wetzler report at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem, an issue the museum attributed to lack of funding. There was a Hungarian translation, but it did not note the names of its authors and, Linn wrote, could be found only in a file that dealt with Rudolf Kastner. Linn herself, born and raised in Israel and schooled at the prestigious <a href="Hebrew%20Reali%20School">Hebrew Reali School</a>, first learned about Vrba when she watched <a href="Claude%20Lanzmann">Claude Lanzmann</a>'s film "<a href="Shoah%20%28film%29">Shoah</a>" (1985), for which Vrba was interviewed. In 1998 she polled 594 students at the University of Haifa, either third-year undergraduates or first-year graduate students; 98 percent said that no one had ever escaped from Auschwitz, and the remainder did not know the escapees' names. This failure to acknowledge Vrba has played into the hands of <a href="Holocaust%20denial">Holocaust deniers</a>, who have tried to undermine his testimony about the gas chambers.

In 2005 Uri Dromi of the <a href="Israel%20Democracy%20Institute">Israel Democracy Institute</a> responded that there were at least four Israeli books on the Holocaust that mention Vrba, and that Wetzler's testimony is recounted at length in <a href="Livia%20Rothkirchen">Livia Rothkirchen</a>'s "Hurban yahadut Slovakia" ("The Destruction of Slovak Jewry"), published by Yad Vashem in 1961. Robert Rozett, head librarian at Yad Vashem and author of the entry on the "Auschwitz Report" in the "Encyclopedia of the Holocaust", said of the Vrba controversy in 2005: "There are people who come into the subject from a certain angle and think that they've uncovered the truth. A historian who deals seriously with the subject understands that the truth is complex and multifaceted."

Joel Brand

Joel Brand (25 April 1906 – 13 July 1964) was a leading member of the <a href="Aid%20and%20Rescue%20Committee">Aid and Rescue Committee</a> ("Va'ada Ezra ve'Hatzalah", or "Va'ada"), an underground <a href="Zionism">Zionist</a> group in <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>, Hungary, that smuggled Jews out of <a href="German-occupied%20Europe">German-occupied Europe</a> during the <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> to the relative safety of Hungary. When <a href="Hungary%20in%20World%20War%20II%23German%20occupation%20of%20Hungary">Germany invaded that country too</a> in March 1944, Brand became known for his efforts to save the Jewish community from deportation to the <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz concentration camp</a> in German-occupied Poland.

In April 1944 Brand was approached by <a href="Adolf%20Eichmann">Adolf Eichmann</a>, the German <a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> officer who had arrived in Budapest to organize the deportations. Eichmann proposed that Brand broker a deal between the SS and the United States or Britain, in which the Nazis would exchange one million Jews for 10,000 trucks for the Eastern front and large quantities of tea and other goods. It was the most ambitious of a series of such deals between the SS and Jewish leaders. Eichmann called it ""Blut gegen Waren"" ("blood for goods").

Nothing came of the proposal, which "The Times" of London called one of the most loathsome stories of the war. Historians have suggested that the SS, including its commander, <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>, intended the negotiations as cover for peace talks with the Western Allies that would exclude the Soviet Union and perhaps even <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. Whatever its purpose, the proposal was thwarted by the British government. They arrested Brand in <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a> (then under British control), where he had gone to propose Eichmann's offer to the <a href="Jewish%20Agency">Jewish Agency</a>, and put an end to it by leaking details to the media.

The failure of the proposal, and the wider issue of why the Allies were unable to save the 435,000 Hungarian Jews deported to Auschwitz between May and July 1944, became the subject of bitter debate for many years. In 1961 "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine called Brand "a man who lives in the shadows with a broken heart". He told an interviewer shortly before his death in 1964: "An accident of life placed the fate of one million human beings on my shoulders. I eat and sleep and think only of them."

One of seven children, Brand was born to a Jewish family in Naszód, Siebenbürgen (<a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>), then part of <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>, now <a href="N%C4%83s%C4%83ud">Năsăud</a>, Romania. His father was the founder of the Budapest telephone company, and his paternal grandfather, also Joel Brand, had owned the post office in <a href="Mukacheve">Mukacheve</a>.

The family moved to Erfurt in Germany when Brand was four, where he attended school until 1923 and, he wrote, completed his "<a href="Abitur">Abitur</a>". When he was 19 he went to stay with an uncle in New York, then worked his way across the United States, washing dishes and working on roads and in mines. He joined the Communist Party, worked for the <a href="Comintern">Comintern</a> as a sailor, and sailed to Hawaii, the Philippines, South America, China, and Japan.

In or around 1930 Brand returned to Erfurt, where his father had founded another telephone company. Brand started working for the company and became a functionary with the Thuringian KPD (<a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Germany">Communist Party of Germany</a>). He was still living in Germany when <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was <a href="Machtergreifung">sworn in as Chancellor</a> on 30 January 1933, and on 27 February that year he was arrested, as a communist, just before the <a href="Reichstag%20fire">Reichstag fire</a>. Released in 1934, he moved to Budapest, Hungary, where he worked again for his father's company. He joined the "<a href="Poale%20Zion">Poale Zion</a>", a Marxist-Zionist party, became a vice-president of the Budapest Palestine Office, which organized Jewish emigration to <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Palestine</a>, and sat on the governing body of the <a href="Jewish%20National%20Fund">Jewish National Fund</a>.<ref name="Session56(1/4)">Testimony of Joel Brand, Trial of Adolf Eichmann, session 56, part <a href="http%3A//www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/Sessions/Session-056-01.html">1/4</a>, 29 May 1961.</ref>

In 1935 Brand married <a href="Hansi%20Brand">Haynalka "Hansi" Hartmann</a> and together they opened a knitwear and glove factory on Rozsa Street, Budapest, which after a few years had a staff of over 100. The couple had met as members of a "hachscharah", a group of Jews preparing to move to Palestine to work on a "<a href="kibbutz">kibbutz</a>", but Brand's plans changed when his mother and three sisters fled to Budapest from Germany and he had to support them.

Brand's involvement in smuggling Jews into Hungary began in July 1941, when Hansi Brand's sister and brother-in-law were caught up in the <a href="Kamianets-Podilskyi%20Massacre">Kamianets-Podilskyi deportations</a>. The Hungarian government sent 18,000 Jews to German-occupied Ukraine because they were unable to prove they were Hungarian citizens; 14,000–16,000 of them were shot by the SS. Brand paid a Hungarian counter-espionage officer to bring his wife's relatives back safely.

Through the "Poale Zion" party, the Brands joined other Zionists engaged in rescue work, including <a href="Rezs%C5%91%20Kasztner">Rezső Kasztner</a>, a lawyer and journalist from <a href="Kolozsv%C3%A1r">Kolozsvár</a> (Cluj), and <a href="Ott%C3%B3%20Komoly">Ottó Komoly</a>, an engineer. In January 1943 the group set up the <a href="Aid%20and%20Rescue%20Committee">Aid and Rescue Committee</a>, known as the "Va'ada Ezra ve'Hatzalah" or "Va'ada", with Komoly as chair. Other members included Andreas Biss (Brand's cousin), Samuel Springmann (a Polish jeweller whose family were in the <a href="%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA%20ghetto">Łódź ghetto</a>), Sandor Offenbach, Dr. Miklos Schweiziger, Moshe Krausz, Eugen Frankel, and Ernő Szilágyi from the "<a href="Hashomer%20Hatzair">Hashomer Hatzair</a>" party. The "Va'ada" raised money, forged documents, maintained contacts with intelligence agencies, and ran safe houses. Brand testified during Adolf Eichmann's trial that, between 1941 and the German invasion of Hungary in March 1944, he and the committee had helped 22,000–25,000 Jews reach Hungary.

<a href="Oskar%20Schindler">Oskar Schindler</a> became one of the committee's contacts, smuggling letters and money into the <a href="Krak%C3%B3w%20ghetto">Kraków ghetto</a> on their behalf. During a visit by Schindler to Budapest in November 1943, they learned that Schindler had been bribing Nazi officers to let him bring Jewish refugees into <a href="Oskar%20Schindler%27s%20Enamel%20Factory">his factory in Poland</a>, which he ran as a safe haven. This further encouraged the committee, after the invasion of Hungary, to try negotiating with the SS.

The Germans invaded Hungary on Sunday, 19 March 1944, meeting no resistance. Following Hungary's annexation in 1941 of parts of Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, there were 725,000 Jews in the country, as well as over 60,000 Jewish converts to Christianity and others the Nazis counted as Jews, according to <a href="Yehuda%20Bauer">Yehuda Bauer</a>. Most were liberal Jews and fully assimilated; nearly 30 percent were Orthodox and a small minority were Zionists.

Restrictions on Jews had been in place before the invasion, including a prohibition on marrying Christians. After the invasion, <a href="Randolph%20L.%20Braham">Randolph Braham</a> writes, the Hungarian government immediately began the process of isolating Jews from the rest of the community. From 5 April 1944 Jews over the age of six had to wear a 3.8 x 3.8 inch (10 x 10 cm) <a href="yellow%20badge">yellow badge</a>. They were forbidden from using telephones, owning cars or radios, travelling or moving home, and had to declare the value of their property. Jewish civil servants, journalists and lawyers were sacked, and non-Jews could not work in Jewish households. Books by Jews were removed from libraries and Jewish authors could no longer be published.

On the day of the invasion, Kasztner and Szilágyi hid in the apartment of Andreas Biss, a chemical engineer, in Semsey Street. They were later joined by Komoly and his wife, and later still by the Brands and their two children. The committee wanted to establish contact with the Germans, and offered a go-between $20,000 to arrange a meeting with SS "<a href="Hauptsturmf%C3%BChrer">Hauptsturmführer</a>" <a href="Dieter%20Wisliceny">Dieter Wisliceny</a>, one of Eichmann's assistants.

<a href="David%20M.%20Crowe">David Crowe</a> writes that the SS had become an economic force in its own right by 1944, thanks to its plundering of Jewish businesses and ownership of factories that used slave labour from concentration camps. Jewish rescue workers had made several attempts to exploit SS corruption. In Bratislava, Slovakia, <a href="Gisi%20Fleischmann">Gisi Fleischmann</a> and Orthodox Rabbi <a href="Michael%20Dov%20Weissmandl">Michael Dov Weissmandl</a>, leaders of the <a href="Working%20Group%20%28resistance%20organization%29">Working Group</a> (the Slovakian equivalent of the Aid and Rescue Committee), had paid Dieter Wisliceny c. $50,000 in 1942 to suspend the deportation to Poland of Jews from Slovakia. According to Bauer, only two transports left for Poland after Wisliceny was paid, and the Working Group believed their bribe had succeeded. In fact, the deportations had been halted for other reasons: Slovakian officials had been bribed; many Jews were protected by government documents showing they were, for example, essential workers; and there had been an intervention from the Vatican in June 1942. Encouraged by their apparent success, Fleischmann and Weissmandl devised a more ambitious proposal in November 1942. Known as the Europa Plan or "Grossplan", the aim was to bribe the SS with money from Jews overseas, primarily the United States, to stop the deportation of all Jews to Poland. Nothing came of the proposal, reportedly because Heinrich Himmler intervened to stop it in August 1943.

The Aid and Rescue Committee decided to ask Wisliceny whether the SS were, as Kasztner wrote in a later report, "prepared to negotiate with the illegal Jewish rescue committee on an economic basis about the moderation of the anti-Jewish measures". Brand and Kasztner met Wisliceny on 5 April 1944. They told him they were in a position to continue Fleischmann's negotiations and could offer $2 million, with a down payment of $200,000. They asked that there be no deportations, mass executions or <a href="pogrom">pogrom</a>s in Hungary, no ghettos or camps, and that Jews who held immigration certificates for Palestine (issued by the British <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">mandatory government</a>) be allowed to leave. Wisliceny accepted the $200,000, but indicated that $2 million might not be enough. He said there would be no deportations and no harm to the Jewish community while negotiations continued, and arranged for Aid and Rescue Committee exemptions from anti-Jewish laws to allow its members to travel and use cars and telephones.

Following the contact with Wisliceny, Brand received a message on 25 April that SS "<a href="Obersturmbannf%C3%BChrer">Obersturmbannführer</a>" Adolf Eichmann wanted to see him. Eichmann had arrived in Budapest as head of the "Sondereinsatzkommando" overseeing the deportation of the Jews. Brand was told to wait in the Opera Café and from there was driven by the SS to Eichmann's headquarters at the Hotel Majestic. SS "Untersturmbannführer" <a href="Kurt%20Becher">Kurt Becher</a>, an emissary of "<a href="Reichsf%C3%BChrer-SS">Reichsführer-SS</a>" <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>, was also at the meeting. Brand wrote that Eichmann wore a "well-cut" uniform and had eyes he would never forget: "Steely blue, hard and sharp, they seemed to bore through you. ... It was only later that I noticed his small face with its thin lips and sharp nose." In a tone that Brand compared to the "clatter of a machine gun", Eichmann offered to sell him one million Jews, not for money, but for goods from overseas:

I have already made investigations about you and your people and I have verified your ability to make a deal. Now then, I am prepared to sell you one million Jews ... Goods for blood – blood for goods. You can take them from any country you like, wherever you can find them – Hungary, Poland, the Ostmark, from Theresienstadt, from Auschwitz, wherever you like.

Eichmann said he would discuss the proposal with Berlin, and that in the meantime Brand should decide what kinds of goods he was in a position to offer. Brand asked how the committee was supposed to obtain these goods. Eichmann said he should open negotiations with the Allies overseas and that Eichmann would arrange a travel permit. Brand suggested Istanbul, where another committee member had a <a href="Jewish%20Agency">Jewish Agency</a> contact. He testified years later that on leaving the hotel he felt like a "stark madman".

Eichmann sent for Brand again a few days later. Eichmann was accompanied this time by Gerhard Clages, also known as Otto Klages, chief of Himmler's "<a href="Sicherheitsdienst">Sicherheitsdienst</a>" (security service) in Budapest. Clages' presence meant that three of Himmler's senior officers – Eichmann, Becher and Clages – had involved themselves with the Brand proposal. Clages handed Brand $50,000 and 270,000 Swiss francs that the Germans had intercepted, sent to the Aid and Rescue Committee by rescue workers in Switzerland via the Swedish Embassy in Budapest.

Eichmann told Brand that he wanted 10,000 new trucks for the <a href="Waffen-SS">Waffen-SS</a> to use on the Eastern front, one truck for every 100 Jews, as well as 200 tons of tea, 200 tons of cocoa, 800 tons of coffee and 2,000,000 cases of soap. If Brand returned from Istanbul with confirmation that the Allies had accepted the proposal, Eichmann said he would release 10 percent of the one million. The deal would proceed with 100,000 Jews released for every 1,000 trucks.

It remains unclear whether Eichmann told Brand to return to Budapest by a particular date. According to Bauer, Brand said at various points that he was advised he could "take [his] time" or given one, two or three weeks. Hansi Brand testified during Eichmann's trial that in the meantime she and her children had to remain in Budapest, effectively as hostages. Brand and Eichmann met several more times, the final time on 15 May, the day the deportations began. Between then and 8 July 1944, 437,402 Jews, almost the entire Jewish population of the Hungarian countryside, are recorded as having been deported to Auschwitz on 147 trains, a rate of around 12,000 a day. Most were gassed.

Brand secured a letter of recommendation for the Jewish Agency from the Hungarian <a href="Jewish%20Council">Jewish Council</a>. He was told he would be travelling with Bandi Grosz (real name, Andor Gross), a Hungarian who had worked for Hungarian and German military intelligence; Grosz would travel to Istanbul as the director of a Hungarian transport company. The SS drove the men from Budapest to Vienna on 17 May, where they stayed the night in a hotel reserved for the SS.

Grosz later testified that Brand's mission had been a cover for his own. He said he had been told by Clages to arrange a meeting in a neutral country between senior German and American officers, or British if necessary, to broker peace between the German "Sicherheitsdienst" and the Western Allies.

In Vienna Brand was given a German passport in the name of Eugen Band. He cabled the Jewish Agency in Istanbul to say he was on his way, and arrived by German diplomatic plane on 19 May. <a href="Paul%20Lawrence%20Rose">Paul Rose</a> writes that Brand had no idea at this point that the deportations to Auschwitz had already begun.

Brand had been told by the Jewish Agency by return cable that "Chaim" would meet him in Istanbul. Convinced of the importance of his mission, he believed this was <a href="Chaim%20Weizmann">Chaim Weizmann</a>, president of the <a href="World%20Zionist%20Organization">World Zionist Organization</a>, later the first president of Israel. In fact the man who had arranged to meet him was Chaim Barlas, head of the Istanbul group of Zionist emissaries. Not only was Barlas not there, but there was no entry visa waiting for Brand, and he was threatened with arrest and deportation. Brand saw this as the first betrayal by the Jewish Agency. Bauer argues that Brand, then and later, failed to grasp that the Jewish Agency was powerless. That his passport was in the name of Eugen Band would have been enough to cause the confusion.

The visa situation was sorted out by Bandi Grosz and the men were taken to a hotel, where they met the Jewish Agency delegates. Brand was furious that no one sufficiently senior was available to negotiate a deal. The Jewish Agency agreed to arrange for <a href="Moshe%20Sharett">Moshe Sharett</a> (previously Shertok), head of its political department and later second prime minister of Israel, to travel to Istanbul to meet him. Brand passed them a plan of Auschwitz (probably from the <a href="Vrba-Wetzler%20report">Vrba-Wetzler report</a>) and demanded that the gas chambers, crematoria and railways lines be bombed. The discussions left him discouraged and depressed. He wrote that the delegates lacked any sense of urgency and were focused more on internal politics and Jewish emigration to Palestine, rather than the slaughter in Europe: "[They] were undoubtedly worthy men ... But they lacked any awareness of how critical was the period of history in which they were living. They had not looked death in the face day after day, as we had in Budapest ..."

<a href="Ladislaus%20L%C3%B6b">Ladislaus Löb</a> writes that proposals and counter-proposals flew between Istanbul, London and Washington. The Jewish Agency and Brand wanted the Allies to string the Germans along in the hope of slowing the deportations. The Agency gave Brand a document, dated 29 May 1944, that offered $400,000 for every 1,000 Jewish emigrants to Palestine, one million Swiss francs per 10,000 Jewish emigrants to neutral countries such as Spain, and 10,000 Swiss francs a month if the deportations were to stop. If the SS would allow the Allies to supply food, clothes and medicine to the Jews in concentration camps, the Nazis would be supplied with the same. Rose writes that the agreement was intended only to give Brand something to take back to Budapest.

Brand cabled his wife on 29 and 31 May to tell her (and thereby Eichmann) about the agreement, but there was no response. Rezső Kasztner and Hansi Brand had been held in Budapest between 27 May and 1 June by the Hungarian <a href="Arrow%20Cross">Arrow Cross</a>. They received the telegrams when they were released, but Eichmann refused to halt the deportations.

In Istanbul Brand was told that Moshe Sharett was unable to obtain a visa for Turkey. The Jewish Agency asked Brand to meet him instead in Aleppo on the Syrian-Turkish border. He was reluctant; the area was under British control and he was afraid they would want to question him, but the Agency told him it would be safe and he left by train with two of its delegates.

While on the train, Brand was approached by two representatives of <a href="Zeev%20Jabotinsky">Zeev Jabotinsky</a>'s <a href="Hatzohar">Hatzohar</a> (Revisionist Zionist) party and the <a href="World%20Agudath%20Israel">World Agudath Israel</a> Orthodox religious party. They told him the British were going to arrest him in Aleppo: ""Die Engländer sind in dieser Frage nicht unsere Verbündeten""("the British are not our allies in this matter"). As soon as he arrived at the Aleppo train station on 7 June, he was stopped by a British man in plain clothes and pushed into a Jeep that was waiting with its engine running.

The British drove him to a villa, where for four days they tried to stop Moshe Sharett from meeting him. Sharett "fought a battle of telephones and cables," Bauer writes, and on 11 June he and the Jewish Agency intelligence group were finally introduced to Brand. The discussion lasted several hours. Sharett wrote in a report of 27 June: "I must have looked a little incredulous, for he said: 'Please believe me: they have killed six million Jews; there are only two million left alive.'" At the end of the meeting, Sharett broke the news that the British were insisting Brand not return to Budapest. Brand became hysterical.

Brand was taken to Cairo, where he was questioned by the British for weeks. On 22 June he was interviewed by Ira Hirschmann of the American <a href="War%20Refugee%20Board">War Refugee Board</a>; Hirschmann wrote a positive report about Brand, but his influence was limited. Brand went on hunger strike for 17 days in protest at his detention.

The British, Americans, and Soviets discussed the proposal. British Foreign Secretary (later Prime Minister) <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a> wrote a memo on 26 June outlining the options. The British were convinced they were dealing with a Himmler trick, perhaps an attempt to broker a peace deal without the Soviet Union. If the deal had gone ahead and large numbers of Jews had been released in central Europe, Allied airborne and possibly land-based military operations might have had to stop. Bauer believes the British feared this was Himmler's motive – to turn the Jews into human shields – because it would have allowed the Germans to devote their forces to fighting the Red Army.

The Americans were more open to negotiating. A rift developed between them and the British who, Bauer writes, were worried about large-scale Jewish immigration to Palestine, then under British control. There was also concern about the effect of Jewish immigration to the UK or US.

Eden did suggest a counter-proposal on 1 July, but it was reduced, Bauer writes, to a ridiculous minimum. He told the American government that the British would allow Brand to return to Budapest with a message for Eichmann suggesting that 1,500 Jewish children be given safe passage to Switzerland, 5,000 from Bulgaria and Romania be allowed to leave for Palestine, and that Germany guarantee safe conduct for ships carrying Jewish refugees. He did not say what he would offer in return. On 11 July Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> put an end to the idea when he told Eden that the murder of the Jews was "probably the greatest and most horrible crime ever committed", and that there should be "no negotiations of any kind on this subject". Of Brand's mission he wrote: "The project which has been put forward through a very doubtful channel seems itself also to be of the most nondescript character. I would not take it seriously."

The British leaked details of Eichmann's proposal to the media. On 19 July 1944 – the day before the <a href="20%20July%20plot">20 July plot</a>, the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler – the "New York Herald Tribune" (dateline London, 18 July) reported that two Hungarian government emissaries in Turkey had proposed that Hungarian Jews be given safe passage in exchange for British and American pharmaceuticals and transport for the Germans. The "Times" called it "one of the most loathsome" stories of the war, an attempt to "blackmail, deceive and split" the Allies, and a "new level of fantasy and self-deception".

The mass deportation of Hungarian Jews had already stopped by the time of the leak. Following publication in mid-June of parts of the <a href="Vrba-Wetzler%20report">Vrba-Wetzler report</a>, describing the use of gas chambers inside Auschwitz, the Jewish Agency in Geneva had cabled London asking that Hungarian ministers be held personally responsible for the killings. The cable was intercepted and passed to Hungarian regent <a href="Mikl%C3%B3s%20Horthy">Miklós Horthy</a>, who on 7 July 1944 ordered an end to the deportations. The British released Brand on 5 October. Brand said they would not allow him to return to Hungary and forced him to travel to Palestine. Bauer disputes this; in his view, Brand was simply afraid of returning to Budapest, convinced the Germans would murder him.

Germany's Foreign Minister, <a href="Joachim%20von%20Ribbentrop">Joachim von Ribbentrop</a>, had apparently known nothing about the proposal. He cabled "<a href="Brigadef%C3%BChrer">Brigadeführer</a>" <a href="Edmund%20Veesenmayer">Edmund Veesenmayer</a> of the SS on 20 July 1944 to ask about it, and was told on 22 July that Brand and Grosz had been sent to Turkey on the orders of <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>, head of the SS. Eichmann himself said during interrogation after the war that the order had come from Himmler, as did SS officer Kurt Becher: "Himmler said to me: 'Take whatever you can from the Jews. Promise them whatever you want. What we will keep is another matter.'"

According to Bauer, the "clumsiness of the approach has been a wonderment to all observers". Bauer argues that Eichmann wanted to murder Jews, not sell them, but was forced instead to act as Himmler's reluctant messenger. On the day Brand left Germany for Istanbul in May 1944, Eichmann was in Auschwitz checking that it was ready for the trainloads of Jews about to arrive from Hungary. The camp's commander, "Obersturmbannführer" <a href="Rudolf%20H%C3%B6ss">Rudolf Höss</a>, said it would be difficult to process such large numbers, whereupon Eichmann ordered that new arrivals be gassed immediately rather than going through "selection". This does not suggest that he was going to halt the killing until Brand returned from Istanbul.

In Bauer's view, the presence at one of the meetings of Gerhard Clages of the SS signals that Himmler was focusing on secret peace talks. Brand and Grosz arrived in Istanbul just two months before the <a href="20%20July%20plot">attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler</a> on 20 July 1944. Himmler knew that attempts might be made on Hitler's life, although not where and when. He may have wanted to broker for peace in case Hitler did not survive, using low-level agents for plausible deniability; in the event that Hitler did survive, Bauer argues, Himmler would be able to offer him a peace deal with the West that excluded the Soviet Union. Brand himself came to believe that the proposal had been designed to drive a wedge between the Allies. Two months before his death in 1964, at the trial in Germany of Eichmann's deputies and , he said he had "made a terrible mistake in passing this on to the British. It is now clear to me that Himmler sought to sow suspicion among the Allies as a preparation for his much desired Nazi-Western coalition against Moscow."

Brand's failure to return to Budapest was a disaster for the Aid and Rescue Committee. On 27 May Hansi Brand, who at some point during this period had become Kasztner's lover, was arrested and beaten by the Hungarian <a href="Arrow%20Cross%20Party">Arrow Cross</a>. Kasztner wrote that on 9 June Eichmann told him: "If I do not receive a positive reply within three days, I shall operate the mill at Auschwitz" (""die Muehle laufen lasse""). During his trial in Jerusalem in 1961, Eichmann denied having said this to Kastner. He told the court that he did not have the authority to stop or start what was happening in Auschwitz, or to change the deal. The order from Berlin had said: "Deportations will continue in the meanwhile and will not be stopped until Joel Brand returns with a statement to the effect that these matters have been accepted by the Jewish organizations abroad." Hansi Brand told <a href="Claude%20Lanzman">Claude Lanzman</a> in 1979:
We ... [lived] between fear and despair and hope. And that formed itself into such a heap of stuff, that I can't really describe it – how it was and what it was. Every evening, we went to pieces and during the night, we tried to build ourselves up again, so we could go into the street ... and look like human beings again ... And [it] was like being in a windmill; it turned and moved.

Bauer argues that the Aid and Rescue committee made the mistake of almost adopting the anti-Semitic belief in unlimited Jewish power, that Jewish leaders could move around freely and persuade the Allies to act, and that American Jews had easy access to money and goods. The committee had similar trust in the Allies, but the latter were preparing for the <a href="invasion%20of%20Normandy">invasion of Normandy</a>, which began on 6 June 1944. "At that crucial moment," writes Bauer, "to antagonize the Soviets because of some hare-brained Gestapo plan to ransom Jews was totally out of the question."

Despite the setbacks, Kasztner, Hansi Brand and the rest of the committee secured the release of around 1,684 Jews, including 273 children, who were allowed to leave Budapest for Switzerland <a href="Kastner%20train">by train on 30 June 1944</a>. The committee paid SS officer <a href="Kurt%20Becher">Kurt Becher</a> $1000 per person in foreign currency, shares, jewellery and gold, raised from the wealthier passengers to cover the cost of the rest. After an unexplained detour to the <a href="Bergen-Belsen%20concentration%20camp">Bergen-Belsen concentration camp</a>, the passengers arrived in Switzerland in two batches in August and December that year. Joel Brand's mother, sister and niece were on the train, as were 10 members of Kasztner's family and 388 people from the <a href="Kolozsv%C3%A1r%20ghetto">Kolozsvár ghetto</a> in his home town. Kastner's relationship with these passengers led to the criticism that his negotiations with Becher had focused on saving people he knew, an allegation that led to <a href="Kasztner%20assassination">his assassination in 1957</a>.

Bauer concludes that Brand was a courageous man who had passionately wanted to help the Jewish people, but his life was plagued after the mission by suspicion, including from other members of the Aid and Rescue Committee, because of his failure to return to Budapest. After the British released him, he joined the <a href="Lehi%20%28group%29">Stern Gang</a>, who were fighting to remove the British from Palestine. He and Hansi Brand lived for the rest of their lives in Israel, at first moving to the <a href="Givat%20Brenner">Givat Brenner</a> kibbutz, then to Tel Aviv, with their two sons.

Brand offered testimony about the blood-for-goods proposal during several trials. In 1954 he testified at the controversial libel trial in Jerusalem of <a href="Malchiel%20Gruenwald">Malchiel Gruenwald</a>, who was sued by the Israeli government on behalf of <a href="Rezs%C5%91%20Kasztner">Rezső Kasztner</a>. Gruenwald was a Hungarian Holocaust survivor who had moved to Israel after the war. In a self-published pamphlet in 1952 he accused Kasztner, by then an Israeli civil servant, of having collaborated with the Nazis by dealing with Eichmann. Brand testified for Kasztner, but instead of defending him took the opportunity to accuse the Jewish Agency, whose officials became the first Israeli government, of having helped the British scupper the blood-for-goods proposal.

After a trial that lasted 18 months, the judge concluded that, by negotiating with Eichmann, failing to warn the many to save the few on the <a href="Kasztner%20train">Kasztner train</a>, and writing an affidavit after the war for Kurt Becher, Kasztner had "sold his soul to the devil". It was because of Kasztner's support for Becher that the Americans decided not to prosecute Becher <a href="Nuremberg%20trials">at Nuremberg</a>. Kasztner also wrote affidavits for SS officers <a href="Hans%20J%C3%BCttner">Hans Jüttner</a>, <a href="Dieter%20Wisliceny">Dieter Wisliceny</a> and Hermann Krumey.
The judge said that Kasztner's failure to do more to warn the community that they were being sent to the gas chambers, not resettled, had helped Eichmann maintain order, and that the Kasztner train had been a payoff. <a href="Tom%20Segev">Tom Segev</a> called the ruling "one of the most heartless in the history of Israel, perhaps the most heartless ever". The <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Israel">Supreme Court of Israel</a> overturned most of the verdict in January 1958, ruling that the lower court had "erred seriously", but Kasztner was assassinated in 1957 as a result of the earlier judgment.

Brand's book was published in Israel in 1956 as "Bi-sheliḥut nidonim la mavet" and in German in 1956 as "Die Geschichte von Joel Brand". It appeared in English in 1958 as "Advocate for the Dead: The Story of Joel Brand" by Alex Weissberg, and was serialized in March and April that year by "The Observer", which called it "the strangest story to come out of the war".

Joel and Hansi Brand both testified in 1961 during the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem. Eichmann said he had chosen Brand because he had seemed like an "honest, idealistic man". That year "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine called Brand "a man who lives in the shadows with a broken heart". In May 1964 he testified in Frankfurt against two of Eichmann's assistants, SS-Obersturmbannführer Hermann Krumey and SS-Hauptsturmführer Otto Hunsche.

Brand died of a heart attack, aged 58, during a visit to Germany in July 1964. He told an interviewer shortly before his death: "An accident of life placed the fate of one million human beings on my shoulders. I eat and sleep and think only of them." Over 800 mourners attended his funeral in Tel Aviv, including Colonel Arieh Baz on behalf of Israel's President <a href="Zalman%20Shazar">Zalman Shazar</a>, and <a href="Teddy%20Kollek">Teddy Kollek</a>, director-general of the prime minister's office, on behalf of Prime Minister <a href="Levi%20Eshkol">Levi Eshkol</a>. The eulogy was delivered by <a href="Gideon%20Hausner">Gideon Hausner</a>, the attorney general who prosecuted Adolf Eichmann.

Posting system

The is a <a href="baseball">baseball</a> player transfer system that operates between Japan's <a href="Nippon%20Professional%20Baseball">Nippon Professional Baseball</a> (NPB) and the United States' <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB).

Despite the drafting of the United States – Japanese Player Contract Agreement, unveiled in 1967 to regulate NPB players moving to MLB, problems began to arise in the late 1990s. Some NPB teams lost star players without compensation, an issue highlighted when NPB stars <a href="Hideo%20Nomo">Hideo Nomo</a> and <a href="Alfonso%20Soriano">Alfonso Soriano</a> left to play in MLB after using loopholes to void their existing contracts. A further problem was that NPB players had very little negotiating power if their teams decided to deal them to MLB, as when pitcher <a href="Hideki%20Irabu">Hideki Irabu</a> was traded to an MLB team for which he had no desire to play. In 1998, the Agreement was rewritten to address both problems; the result was dubbed the "posting system".

Under this system, when an NPB player is "posted", his NPB team notifies the <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Baseball">MLB Commissioner</a>, with the posting fee based on the type of contract a player signs and its value. The fee is a flat 25% of the value of a <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor-league</a> contract; for MLB contracts, the fee is based on the value of the contract that the posted player eventually signs. The player is then given 30 days to negotiate with any MLB team willing to pay the NPB team's posting fee. If the player agrees on contract terms with a team before the 30-day period has expired, the NPB team receives the posting fee from the signing MLB team as a transfer fee, and the player is free to play in MLB. If no MLB team comes to a contract agreement with the posted player, then no fee is paid, and the player's rights revert to his NPB team. The current process replaced one in which MLB held a <a href="silent%20auction">silent auction</a> during which MLB teams submitted sealed, uncapped bids in an attempt to win the exclusive negotiating rights with the posted player for a period of 30 days. Once the highest bidding MLB team was determined, the player could then only negotiate with that team.

Up to the end of the 2017–18 posting period, 23 NPB players had been posted using the system. Of these, 12 signed Major League contracts, four signed <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor league</a> contracts, five were unsuccessful in attracting any MLB interest, and two could not come to a contract agreement during the 30-day negotiation period. The five highest-profile players that have been acquired by MLB teams through the posting system are <a href="Ichiro%20Suzuki">Ichiro Suzuki</a>, <a href="Daisuke%20Matsuzaka">Daisuke Matsuzaka</a>, <a href="Yu%20Darvish">Yu Darvish</a>, <a href="Masahiro%20Tanaka">Masahiro Tanaka</a>, and <a href="Shohei%20Ohtani">Shohei Ohtani</a>. The first three attracted high bids of $13.125 million, $51.1 million, and $51.7 million respectively. Tanaka was the first player posted under a revised procedure that was in place from 2013 to 2017; he was posted for the maximum $20 million allowed under the new rules. Ohtani was the first player posted under the current procedure; his posting fee of $20 million was grandfathered in under the previous agreement. However, since its implementation the posting system has been criticized by the media and baseball insiders from both countries.

The first instance of a Japanese-born player playing in Major League Baseball was in 1964, when the <a href="Nankai%20Hawks">Nankai Hawks</a>, an NPB team, sent three exchange prospects to the United States to gain experience in MLB's <a href="Minor%20league%20baseball">minor league system</a>. One of the players, <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> <a href="Masanori%20Murakami">Masanori Murakami</a>, was named the <a href="California%20League">California League</a> Rookie of the Year while playing for the <a href="Fresno%20Giants">Fresno Giants</a> (the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Giants">San Francisco Giants</a>' Class-A team).
Giants executives were impressed with his talent and on September 1, 1964 Murakami was promoted, thus becoming the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20with%20their%20first%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20player">first Japanese player to play in MLB</a>. After Murakami put up good <a href="Baseball%20statistics%23Pitching%20statistics">pitching statistics</a> as a <a href="relief%20pitcher">reliever</a>, Giants executives sought to exercise a clause in their contract with the Hawks that, they claimed, allowed them to buy up an exchange prospect's contract. NPB officials objected, stating that they had no intention of selling Murakami's contract to the Giants and telling them that Murakami was merely on loan for the <a href="1964%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1964 season</a>. After a two-month stalemate the Giants eventually agreed to send Murakami back to the Hawks after the <a href="1965%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1965 season</a>. Thus, after pitching one more season for the Giants, Murakami returned to Japan to play for the Hawks. This affair led to the 1967 United States – Japanese Player Contract Agreement, also known as the "working agreement", between MLB and NPB, which was basically a hands-off policy.

MLB and NPB officials created the posting system as a combined reaction to three cases in the 1990s, involving NPB players who moved to MLB. The first of these occurred in the winter of 1994 when pitcher <a href="Hideo%20Nomo">Hideo Nomo</a>, with the help of <a href="sports%20agent">agent</a> <a href="Don%20Nomura">Don Nomura</a>, became the second Japanese-born player to play in MLB, 30 years after Murakami. Nomo, who was not yet eligible for <a href="free%20agent">free agency</a> in Japan, was advised by Nomura that the Japanese Uniform Players Contract's <a href="reserve%20clause">reserve clause</a> limited the <a href="Kintetsu%20Buffaloes">Kintetsu Buffaloes</a>' control over him to Japan only. Nomo utilized this loophole by voluntarily retiring from NPB to terminate his contract with the Buffaloes, circumvent its reserve clause and play in MLB. He announced his retirement from NPB in late 1994 and signed with the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> in February 1995, where he won the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">Rookie of the Year</a> award. The following year, the Dodgers signed Nomo to a three-year, $4.3 million contract.

In early 1997, after months of negotiations, the <a href="San%20Diego%20Padres">San Diego Padres</a> signed a working agreement with the <a href="Chiba%20Lotte%20Marines">Chiba Lotte Marines</a> that gave the Padres exclusive signing rights to another Nomura client, <a href="Hideki%20Irabu">Hideki Irabu</a>. Although both Irabu and Nomura stated that Irabu would only sign with the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>, neither the Padres nor the Marines consulted Irabu before finalizing their deal. The <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Players%20Association">Major League Baseball Players Association</a> (MLBPA) sided with Irabu, stating that the arrangement unfairly disregarded a player's expressed wishes. However, MLB's executive council ruled that the Padres had not violated any existing rule, and therefore legally held the rights to Irabu. Following this decision, Irabu contemplated a number of different options, including playing in NPB until he became a free agent, and taking the matter to the U.S. judicial system. By May, however, the Padres gave in and traded Irabu to the Yankees, who signed him for $12.8 million over four years.

The final incident occurred in 1998, when <a href="Alfonso%20Soriano">Alfonso Soriano</a> was unable to leave the <a href="Hiroshima%20Toyo%20Carp">Hiroshima Toyo Carp</a> due to contract restrictions. Soriano disliked the intense Japanese practice schedule, and the Carp denied him a salary increase from $45,000 (the league's minimum) to $180,000 per year. Like Nomo and Irabu, Soriano hired Nomura to help his situation. After first attempting to void Soriano's NPB contract by unsuccessfully arguing that the player was legally a minor when he signed it Nomura advised him, like Nomo, to retire from NPB and pursue a career in MLB. This prompted Carp executives to file an <a href="injunction">injunction</a> against Soriano and send letters to MLB teams demanding that they cease all negotiations with him. NPB officials claimed that after the Nomo case they had privately amended the Player Contract to give NPB teams the right to prohibit a player from signing a new contract anywhere after voluntarily retiring. Since MLB officials were not consulted and they did not agree to any changes, <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Baseball">MLB Commissioner</a> <a href="Bud%20Selig">Bud Selig</a> declared that MLB would recognize Soriano as a free agent on July 13, 1998, and the Carp backed down. He signed a 5-year, $3.1 million contract with the New York Yankees the same year.

In 1998, <a href="Orix%20BlueWave">Orix BlueWave</a> general manager <a href="Shigeyoshi%20Ino">Shigeyoshi Ino</a> rewrote the 1967 United States – Japanese Player Contract Agreement, when he drafted the "posting system". Selig and <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Baseball%20%28NPB%29">NPB Commissioner</a> <a href="Hiromori%20Kawashima">Hiromori Kawashima</a> signed this new agreement in December 1998. It sought to address each of the problems brought up by the Nomo, Irabu and Soriano cases, by requiring MLB teams to place "bids" for NPB players. These bids became the basis of transfer fees that are paid as compensation to NPB teams whose star players sign with MLB. NPB players are also allowed to negotiate with MLB teams over the terms of their new contracts. Through the 2013 season, the agreement was in effect on a year-to-year basis, terminable at the option of either the MLB Commissioner or the NPB Commissioner provided notice to terminate is given by June 18 of any given year. A new agreement between MLB and NPB, with significantly different rules, was announced on December 16, 2013 and took effect immediately; it continued through the 2016 MLB and NPB seasons. The agreement was extended for an additional season during negotiations for a new agreement.

The current posting agreement was reached after the 2017 MLB and NPB seasons. The agreement runs through October 31, 2021, the expiration date of MLB's current collective bargaining agreement. Not all of the provisions applied immediately—for example, the <a href="Hokkaido%20Nippon-Ham%20Fighters">Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters</a> were allowed to set a $20 million posting fee, the maximum allowed under the previous agreement, for two-way star <a href="Shohei%20Ohtani">Shohei Ohtani</a>, whom they posted shortly after approval of the new agreement. Future posting fees will be based on the type of contract a player signs and the deal's value. For players signed to MLB contracts, the posting fee is based on the amount of guaranteed money in the initial contract:

For players signed to minor-league contracts, the fee will be a flat 25% of the contract's value.

The system only applies to players currently under contract with a Japanese team, although players who have nine or more years of playing service with NPB are exempt. It does not apply to free agents or to amateur players who have never played in NPB. <a href="Mac%20Suzuki">Mac Suzuki</a>, <a href="Micheal%20Nakamura">Micheal Nakamura</a>, <a href="Kazuhito%20Tadano">Kazuhito Tadano</a>, and <a href="Junichi%20Tazawa">Junichi Tazawa</a> are the only Japanese players to have debuted in MLB without having played in NPB. The system does not work in reverse; it does not regulate MLB players, such as <a href="Alex%20Cabrera">Alex Cabrera</a>, who moved to NPB.

When a player under contract with a Nippon Professional Baseball team wishes to play in Major League Baseball, he must notify his current team's management and request that they make him available for posting during the next posting period (November 1 – March 1 through the 2013 season, and November 1 – February 1 in the current agreement). The NPB team can reject this request, and the player will not be posted. However, if the team consents, the player is presented to the MLB Commissioner, who then notifies all MLB teams of the posted player.

In the original process, MLB held a four-day-long <a href="silent%20auction">silent auction</a> during which interested MLB teams submitted sealed bids in <a href="United%20States%20dollar">U.S. dollars</a> to the Commissioner's Office. After the allotted four days passed, the Commissioner closed the bidding process and notified the posted player's NPB team of the highest bid amount but not who the bidding team was. The NPB team then had four days to either accept or reject the non-negotiable bid amount.

If the bid was rejected, the NPB team retained rights to the player. If it was accepted, the successful MLB team was granted the exclusive rights to negotiate with the player for 30 days. If the player and the MLB team agreed on contract terms before the 30-day period expired, the NPB team received the bid amount as a transfer fee within five business days. The player was then free to play for his new MLB team in the coming season. The transfer fee was not included when calculating an MLB team's total payroll, which is subject to a <a href="luxury%20tax">luxury tax</a> when it exceeds $155 million. If the MLB team could not come to a contract agreement with the posted player, then no fee was paid and the rights to the player reverted to his NPB team. A player could request to be posted again in subsequent years, and the process would be repeated with no advantage to the club that had won the bidding the previous year.

Under the current process, the NPB team notifies the MLB Commissioner of a posting, with the posting fee determined by the value of the contract that a posted player eventually signs with an MLB organization. Once the MLB Commissioner announces the posting, the player has 30 days to sign with an MLB team. Unlike the past system, in which only the team that won the bidding process had negotiating rights, the current system allows the posted player to negotiate with any MLB team willing to pay the posting fee. As in the previous process, if the player signs with an MLB team during the negotiating window, the signing team will pay the posting fee; otherwise, his rights revert to his NPB team. Also mirroring the past system, an unsuccessfully posted player can request a posting in a later year, with the process repeated.

Of the 55 <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20players%20from%20Japan">Japanese-born players who have played in MLB</a>, 15 have entered the league using the posting system. Since the system's creation in 1998, the 22 players that have used it have experienced a range of success. Of these 22, eleven were immediately signed to Major League contracts and one player who drew no bids on his first posting was signed to a Major League contract on his second posting. These contracts range from $1.4 million to $155 million. Of the remaining nine, three were signed to <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">Minor League</a> contracts, two were unable to reach a contract agreement and five were unsuccessful in drawing bids from any Major League clubs (one player failed to draw bids during two separate postings). The following tables outline each posting and its outcome.

Since its implementation in late 1998 the posting system has been heavily criticized. Ichiro Suzuki's agent remarked that "the player literally gets zero advantage from [the posting system]... the Japanese teams benefit by holding the players hostage". Don Nomura called the process a "slave auction". Much of the criticism of the system stems from its forcing NPB players to negotiate their contracts solely with the MLB team that submitted the highest bid. "<a href="The%20Japan%20Times">The Japan Times</a>" columnist Marty Kuehnert believes that since no other team is allowed to submit competitive counter-offers, negotiations result in salaries below the player's <a href="market%20value">market value</a>. Kuehnert also believes the system fosters a "take-it-or-leave-it" situation; if the team and the player have not finalized contract negotiations by the end of a 30-day period, the team can make a low offer knowing that the player's only other option is to play in Japan for another year. It has been suggested that this is a violation of the Anti-Monopoly Act, a Japanese <a href="Competition%20law">antitrust law</a> that prohibits parties from signing an international agreement or contract that "contains such matters as constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade or unfair business practices".

The <a href="Japanese%20Professional%20Baseball%20Players%20Association">Japanese Professional Baseball Players Association</a> (JPBPA) was not consulted before the system was implemented by NPB club owners, and did not subsequently ratify it. Since its introduction JPBPA has expressed many concerns, likening the process to "<a href="human%20trafficking">human trafficking</a>". Agreeing that the system takes unfair advantage of NPB players, the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Players%20Association">Major League Baseball Players Association</a> (MLBPA) offered to help JPBPA fight the posting system in court. However, according to one JPBPA official, the Japanese court process is too long and involved; therefore, the "problem can't be helped".

<a href="Yomiuri%20Giants">Yomiuri Giants</a> club representative Hidetoshi Kiyotake has expressed dislike of the system, because it enables Major League Baseball to poach players from Japan. By using the posting system, he says, Japanese teams make a profit in the short term, but by allowing Japan's best players to be sold to MLB, NPB teams and Japanese baseball suffer in the longer term. When Giants pitcher <a href="Koji%20Uehara">Koji Uehara</a> asked to be posted in 2005, Kiyotake denied his request, saying: "We don't recognize the posting system. I've said from the beginning that this is out of the question."

In the middle of the 2012–13 posting season, MLB approached NPB seeking to change the way MLB teams bid for the right to negotiate with NPB players. Instead of using a silent auction in which teams bid blindly, MLB would prefer its teams to participate in a traditional, open auction where the bids are known and teams can knowingly outbid each other. Such a change would likely lower the price of the transfer fees paid to NPB teams. MLB and the players' unions agree that they'd prefer to see the players receive more money for the transfer rather than the teams. "The Japan Times" columnist Jason Coskrey also believed that these talks provided the JPBPA an opportunity to voice their concerns about the posting system and attempt to gain more leverage for themselves during the posting process. The new agreement, as noted, was announced on December 16, 2013, with most of the changes desired by MLB and players from both leagues.

The posting system was criticized by MLB insiders and by the U.S. media, after the controversial 2006–07 posting period. Before the posting of the period's first player, <a href="Daisuke%20Matsuzaka">Daisuke Matsuzaka</a>, in early November 2006, there was speculation that he might draw bids as high as $30 million—more than twice the previous record bid that <a href="Ichiro%20Suzuki">Ichiro Suzuki</a> had garnered in 2000–01. After his silent auction was closed, it was revealed that Matsuzaka had drawn a bid of $51.1 million, shocking American and Japanese baseball executives. The <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>'s winning bid was more than $11 million higher than the next largest.

With the negotiations between Matsuzaka and the Red Sox at a stalemate as the negotiation period neared its close, "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" Dave Sheinin questioned both parties' intentions. Sheinin believed that the Red Sox had foreseen the contractual stalemate and had submitted a high bid simply to deny the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> an opportunity to negotiate with Matsuzaka. However, after Matsuzaka's agent <a href="Scott%20Boras">Scott Boras</a> threatened to take Matsuzaka back to NPB if his price was not met, Sheinin theorized that Boras intentionally wanted to hinder contract negotiations. "<a href="ESPN%20The%20Magazine">ESPN The Magazine</a>"'s <a href="Tim%20Kurkjian">Tim Kurkjian</a> described the situation as "the most obvious <a href="chicken%20%28game%29">game of chicken</a> ever." Sheinin suggested that, should the negotiations fail, Boras could take legal action on the grounds that the requirement of MLB teams to pay large transfer fees to NPB teams artificially depressed the player's personal contract. Boras did not believe that the transfer fee should affect the player's compensation.

Despite the negotiation difficulties, the Boston Red Sox eventually signed Matsuzaka. The team paid approximately $103.1 million in total, including the transfer fee and contract, to acquire the pitcher. Kurkjian believes that with fees and contracts this high, small-market teams could not afford to compete with large-market teams for the rights to negotiate with some posted Japanese players. Kurkjian blames the posting system's use of a blind bidding system as the cause of Matsuzaka's "outrageous offer." He also postulates that Matsuzaka's high bid amount helped to inflate the bids for <a href="Kei%20Igawa">Kei Igawa</a> who was posted two weeks later, perpetuating the problem further. After winning the negotiation rights to Igawa, Yankees' <a href="General%20manager%20%28baseball%29">general manager</a> <a href="Brian%20Cashman">Brian Cashman</a> told reporters that "the posting system, clearly with what took place this winter, might not necessarily be the best system". Kurkjian claims that other MLB executives already believe that a traditional <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a> structure, where the highest bidder wins, would be better than the current system. Cashman and Yankees team president <a href="Randy%20Levine">Randy Levine</a> met with NPB team officials in early 2007 to discuss the posting system, among other things. These meetings did not result in any immediate changes.

Thomas the Slav

Thomas the Slav (,  – October 823) was a 9th-century <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> military commander, most notable for leading a wide-scale revolt in 821–23 against <a href="Byzantine%20emperor">Emperor</a> <a href="Michael%20II%20the%20Amorian">Michael II the Amorian</a> ().

An army officer of <a href="Early%20Slavs">Slavic origin</a> from the <a href="Pontus%20%28region%29">Pontus</a> region (now north-eastern <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>), Thomas rose to prominence, along with the future emperors Michael II and <a href="Leo%20V%20the%20Armenian">Leo V the Armenian</a> (), under the protection of general <a href="Bardanes%20Tourkos">Bardanes Tourkos</a>. After Bardanes' failed rebellion in 803, Thomas fell into obscurity until Leo V's rise to the throne, when Thomas was raised to a senior military command in central <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>. After the murder of Leo and usurpation of the throne by Michael the Amorian, Thomas revolted, claiming the throne for himself. Thomas quickly secured support from most of the <a href="Theme%20%28Byzantine%20district%29">themes</a> (provinces) and troops in Asia Minor, defeated Michael's initial counter-attack and concluded an alliance with the <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid Caliphate</a>. After winning over the maritime themes and their ships as well, he crossed with his army to Europe and <a href="%23Siege_of_Constantinople">laid siege to Constantinople</a>. The imperial capital withstood Thomas's attacks by land and sea, while Michael II called for help from the <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgarian</a> ruler <a href="khan%20%28title%29">khan</a> <a href="Omurtag%20of%20Bulgaria">Omurtag</a>. Omurtag attacked Thomas's army, but although repelled, the Bulgarians inflicted heavy casualties on Thomas's men, who broke and fled when Michael took to the field a few months later. Thomas and his supporters sought refuge in <a href="Arcadiopolis">Arcadiopolis</a>, where he was soon blockaded by Michael's troops. In the end, Thomas's supporters surrendered him in exchange for a pardon, and he was executed.

Thomas's rebellion was one of the largest in the Byzantine Empire's history, but its precise circumstances are unclear due to competing historical narratives, which have come to include claims fabricated by Michael to blacken his opponent's name. Consequently, various motives and driving forces have been attributed to Thomas and his followers. As summarized by the "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20Byzantium">Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium</a>", "Thomas's revolt has been variously attributed to a reaction against <a href="Byzantine%20Iconoclasm">Iconoclasm</a>, a social revolution and popular uprising, a revolt by the Empire's non-<a href="Byzantine%20Greeks">Greek</a> ethnic groups, Thomas's personal ambitions, and his desire to avenge Leo V." Its effects on the military position of the Empire, particularly vis-à-vis the Arabs, are also disputed.

The 11th-century "<a href="Theophanes%20Continuatus">Theophanes Continuatus</a>" states that Thomas was descended from <a href="Asia%20Minor%20Slavs">South Slavs resettled in Asia Minor</a> by successive <a href="Byzantine%20emperor">Byzantine emperor</a>s, while the 10th-century chronicler <a href="Genesios">Genesios</a> calls him "Thomas from Lake Gouzourou, of <a href="Armenians">Armenian</a> race". Most modern scholars support his Slavic descent and believe his birthplace to have been near <a href="Gaziura">Gaziura</a> in the <a href="Pontus%20%28region%29">Pontus</a>. 
Hence his epithet of "the Slav", which has been applied to him only in modern times. Nothing is known about his family and early life, except that his parents were poor and that Thomas himself had received no education. Given that he was between 50 and 60 years old at the time of the rebellion, he was probably born around 760.
Two different accounts of Thomas's life are recounted in both Genesios and "Theophanes Continuatus". According to the first account, Thomas first appeared in 803 accompanying general <a href="Bardanes%20Tourkos">Bardanes Tourkos</a>, and pursued a military career until launching his revolt in late 820. In the second version, he came to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> as a poor youth and entered the service of a man with the high court rank of "<a href="patrikios">patrikios</a>". Then, discovered trying to commit adultery with his master's wife, Thomas fled to the <a href="Bilad%20al-Sham">Arabs in Syria</a>, where he remained for 25 years. Pretending to be the murdered emperor <a href="Constantine%20VI">Constantine VI</a> (r. 780–797), he then led an Arab-sponsored invasion of Asia Minor, but was defeated and punished. Classical and Byzantine scholar <a href="J.B.%20Bury">J.B. Bury</a> tried to reconcile the two narratives, placing Thomas's flight to the <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid Caliphate</a> at around 788 and then having him return to Byzantine service before 803, while the Russian scholar <a href="Alexander%20Vasiliev%20%28historian%29">Alexander Vasiliev</a> interpreted the sources as implying that Thomas fled to the Caliphate at Constantine VI's deposition in 797, and that his participation in Bardanes's revolt must be discounted entirely. The second version of Thomas's story is explicitly preferred by Genesios and "Theophanes Continuatus", and is the only one recorded in 9th-century sources, namely the chronicle of <a href="George%20the%20Monk">George the Monk</a> and the "Life of Saints David, Symeon, and George of <a href="Lesbos">Lesbos</a>". Nevertheless, the French Byzantinist <a href="Paul%20Lemerle">Paul Lemerle</a> came to consider it an unreliable later tradition created by his rival <a href="Michael%20II">Michael II</a> to discredit Thomas, and rejected it altogether, preferring to rely on the first account alone. Most modern scholars follow him in this interpretation.

The first tradition relates that Thomas served as a "<a href="spatharios">spatharios</a>" (staff officer) to Bardanes Tourkos, the "<a href="monostrategos">monostrategos</a>" ("single-general", i.e. commander-in-chief) of the eastern <a href="Theme%20%28Byzantine%20district%29">themes</a>, who in 803 rose in rebellion against Emperor <a href="Nikephoros%20I">Nikephoros I</a> (r. 802–811). Alongside Thomas were two other young "spatharioi" in Bardanes's retinue, who formed a fraternal association: Leo the Armenian, the future <a href="Leo%20V%20the%20Armenian">Leo V</a>, and Michael the Amorian, the future Michael II. According to a later <a href="hagiography">hagiographic</a> tradition, before launching his revolt, Bardanes, in the company of his three young protégés, is said to have visited a monk near <a href="Philomelion">Philomelion</a> who was reputed to foresee the future. The monk predicted what would indeed happen: that Bardanes's revolt would fail, that Leo and Michael would both become emperors, and that Thomas would be acclaimed emperor and killed. When Bardanes did in fact rise up, he failed to win any widespread support. Leo and Michael soon abandoned him and defected to the imperial camp and were rewarded with senior military posts. Thomas alone remained loyal to Bardanes until his surrender. In the aftermath of Bardanes's failure, Thomas disappears from the sources for ten years. Bury suggests that he fled (for a second time according to his interpretation) to the Arabs, a view accepted by a number of other scholars, such as <a href="Romilly%20James%20Heald%20Jenkins">Romilly James Heald Jenkins</a>. The historian <a href="Warren%20Treadgold">Warren Treadgold</a>, however, argues that Thomas stayed in the empire and that may have even remained in active military service, and explains his obscurity by Thomas's association with Bardanes, which hampered his career.

In July 813, Leo the Armenian became emperor and quickly rewarded his old companions, giving them command over elite military forces. Michael received the "<a href="tagma%20%28military%29">tagma</a>" of the <a href="Excubitors">Excubitors</a> (one of the professional guard cavalry regiments stationed around Constantinople), and Thomas the "<a href="tourma">tourma</a>" (division) of the "<a href="Foederati">Foederati</a>", stationed in the <a href="Anatolic%20Theme">Anatolic Theme</a>.

On Christmas Day 820, Leo was murdered in the palace chapel by officials under the direction of Michael the Amorian, who was quickly crowned emperor. At about the same time, Thomas launched a rebellion in the Anatolic Theme. Sources are divided on the exact chronology and motives of the revolt. George the Monk, the hagiographic sources, and a letter from Michael II to the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">western emperor</a> <a href="Louis%20the%20Pious">Louis the Pious</a> claim that Thomas had risen up against Leo before Michael's usurpation. This chronology is followed by almost all later Byzantine chroniclers like Genesios, "Theophanes Continuatus", and <a href="Skylitzes">Skylitzes</a>, as well as a number of modern scholars like John B. Bury and <a href="Alexander%20Kazhdan">Alexander Kazhdan</a>. In his study of Thomas and the revolt, Paul Lemerle dismisses this timeline as a later attempt by Michael to justify his revolt as a response to Leo's failure to suppress the rebellion, and to <a href="wikt%3Aexculpate">exculpate</a> himself of the early defeats suffered by the imperial forces. Some recent studies follow Lemerle and prefer the account of <a href="Symeon%20Logothetes">Symeon Logothetes</a>—generally considered the most accurate of the 10th-century sources—according to which Thomas rebelled a few days after the murder of Leo and in reaction to it.
Consequently, the empire became divided in a struggle that was less a rebellion against the established government and more a contest for the throne between equal contenders. Michael held Constantinople and the European provinces, controlled the imperial bureaucracy, and had been properly crowned by the <a href="Ecumenical%20Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarch</a>, but he had come to the throne through murder, while Thomas gained support and legitimacy through his claim to avenge the fallen Leo, and he won the backing of themes both in Asia and later in Europe. Thomas was a well-known, popular, and respected figure in Asia Minor, where Leo V had enjoyed considerable support. Michael, on the other hand, was virtually unknown outside the capital; his military record was unremarkable, he was uneducated and coarse of manner, his <a href="stutter">stutter</a> earned him ridicule, and he was reputed to sympathize with the heretical religious sect of the <a href="Athinganoi">Athinganoi</a>, to which his family had belonged.

Byzantine accounts of Thomas's rebellion state that he did not in fact claim the throne under his own name but assumed the identity of Emperor Constantine VI, who had been deposed and murdered by his mother, <a href="Irene%20of%20Athens">Irene of Athens</a>, in 797. Most modern scholars follow Lemerle, who dismisses this as yet another later fabrication. If it contains any truth, it is possible that this story may originate from Thomas choosing to be crowned under the <a href="regnal%20name">regnal name</a> of "Constantine", but there is no evidence for such an act. The possible appropriation of Constantine VI's identity is linked in some Byzantine sources with the statement that Thomas was a rumoured supporter of <a href="iconolatry">iconolatry</a>, as opposed to Michael's support for <a href="Byzantine%20Iconoclasm">iconoclasm</a>: it was under Constantine VI that veneration of the icons was <a href="Second%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">restored</a>. Nevertheless, the ambiguous phrasing of the sources, the iconoclast leanings of many themes in Asia Minor, and Thomas's alliance with the Arabs seem to speak against any open commitment to icon worship on his part. Indeed, given Michael II's conciliatory approach during his early reign, the icon worship controversy does not seem to have been a major issue at the time, and in the view of modern scholars most probably did not play a major role in Thomas's revolt. The image of Thomas as an iconophile champion opposed to the iconoclast Michael II in later, <a href="Macedonian%20dynasty">Macedonian-era</a> sources was probably the result of their own anti-iconoclast bias. Warren Treadgold furthermore suggests that if true, Thomas's claim to be Constantine VI may have been little more than a tale circulated to win support, and that Thomas pursued a "studied ambiguity" towards icons, designed to attract support from iconophiles. In Treadgold's words, "Thomas could be all things to all men until he had conquered the whole empire, and then he would have time enough to disappoint some of his followers".

The account of "Theophanes Continuatus" on Thomas's revolt states that in this time, "the servant raised his hand against his master, the soldier against his officer, the captain against his general". This has led some scholars, chiefly Alexander Vasiliev and <a href="George%20Ostrogorsky">George Ostrogorsky</a>, to regard Thomas's revolt as an expression of widespread discontent among the rural population, which suffered under heavy taxation. Other Byzantinists, notably Lemerle, dismiss rural discontent as a primary factor during the revolt.

Genesios and other chroniclers further state that Thomas won the support of "<a href="Hagarenes">Hagarenes</a>, <a href="India">India</a>ns, <a href="Egyptians">Egyptians</a>, <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>ns, <a href="Medians">Medians</a>, <a href="Abasgia">Abasgia</a>ns, <a href="Zygii">Zichs</a>, <a href="Caucasian%20Iberia">Iberians</a>, <a href="Kabeiroi">Kabirs</a>, <a href="Slavs">Slavs</a>, <a href="Huns">Huns</a>, <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a>, <a href="Getae">Getae</a>, the <a href="Manicheans">sectarians of Manes</a>, <a href="Lazica">Laz</a>, <a href="Alania">Alania</a>ns, <a href="Chaldia">Chaldia</a>ns, <a href="Armenians">Armenians</a> and every kind of other peoples". This has led to modern claims that Thomas's rebellion represented an uprising of the empire's non-<a href="Byzantine%20Greeks">Greek</a> ethnic groups, but according to Lemerle, this exaggerated account is yet another piece of hostile disinformation. It is almost certain, however, that Thomas could count on support among the empire's Caucasian neighbours, for the presence of Abasgians, Armenians, and Iberians in his army is mentioned in the near-contemporary letter of Michael II to Louis the Pious. The reasons for this support are unclear; Thomas may have made unspecified promises to their rulers, but Lemerle suggests that the Armenians might have in part been motivated by revenge for Leo, their murdered kinsman.

As commander of the "Foederati", Thomas was based at <a href="Amorion">Amorion</a>, the capital of the Anatolic Theme. Although junior to the theme's "strategos" (military governor), his proclamation received widespread support throughout Asia Minor. Within a short time, all the Asian themes supported Thomas, except for the <a href="Opsician%20Theme">Opsician Theme</a> under the patrician Katakylas, a nephew of Michael II, and the <a href="Armeniac%20Theme">Armeniac Theme</a>, under its "strategos", Olbianos. The <a href="Thracesian%20Theme">Thracesian Theme</a> wavered between the two rivals, but finally threw its support behind Thomas. More than two-thirds of the empire's Asian army eventually aligned with Thomas, while the defection of the provincial tax officials provided him with much-needed revenue.

Michael's first response was to order the Armeniac army to attack Thomas. The Armeniacs were easily defeated in battle and Thomas proceeded through the eastern parts of the Armeniac Theme to occupy the frontier region of <a href="Chaldia">Chaldia</a>. His conquest of the Armeniac province was left incomplete because the Abbasids, taking advantage of the Byzantine civil war, launched raids by land and sea against southern Asia Minor, where Thomas had left few troops. Instead of returning to face these raids, Thomas launched a large-scale invasion of his own against Abbasid territory in spring 821, either in Syria (according to Bury and others) or in Arab-held Armenia (according to Treadgold). Thomas then sent an emissary to the Caliph <a href="al-Ma%27mun">al-Ma'mun</a>, who was sufficiently impressed by Thomas's show of force to receive his proposals, especially in view of the Caliphate's own problems with the rebellion of the <a href="Khurramites">Khurramites</a> under <a href="Babak%20Khorramdin">Babak Khorramdin</a>. Thomas and Ma'mun concluded a treaty of peace and mutual alliance. The Caliph allowed Thomas to recruit men from Arab-ruled territories, and gave leave for him to cross the border and travel to Arab-held <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>, where he was crowned emperor by the iconophile <a href="Patriarch%20of%20Antioch">Patriarch of Antioch</a>, <a href="Job%20of%20Antioch">Job</a>. In exchange, Thomas is said to have promised to cede unspecified territories and become a tributary vassal of the Caliph, though the agreement's exact terms are left unclear in the sources. At about the same time, Thomas adopted a young man of obscure origin, whom he named Constantius and made his co-emperor.

Meanwhile, Michael II tried to win support among the iconophiles by appointing a relative of his as <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Ephesus">Archbishop of Ephesus</a>, but his plan failed when the latter refused to be consecrated by the avowedly iconoclast Patriarch <a href="Antony%20I%20of%20Constantinople">Antony I Kassimates</a>. In an effort to consolidate his hold on the provinces, and especially the two Asian themes still loyal to him, Michael proclaimed a 25 percent reduction in taxes for 821–822.
By summer 821, Thomas had consolidated his position in the East, though the Opsician and Armeniac themes still eluded his control. He set his sights on the ultimate prize, Constantinople, the possession of which alone conferred full legitimacy to an emperor. Thomas assembled troops, gathered supplies, and built <a href="siege%20machines">siege machines</a>. To counter the powerful Imperial Fleet stationed in the capital, he built new ships to augment his existing fleet, which came from the <a href="Cibyrrhaeot%20Theme">Cibyrrhaeot</a> and <a href="Aegean%20Sea%20%28theme%29">Aegean Sea</a> naval themes, and possibly included task forces from the theme of <a href="Hellas%20%28theme%29">Hellas</a>. Thomas recalled <a href="Gregory%20Pterotos">Gregory Pterotos</a>, a general and nephew of Leo V whom Michael had exiled to the island of <a href="Skyros">Skyros</a>, and gave him command of the fleet. By October, the thematic fleets loyal to Thomas had finished assembling at Lesbos, and Thomas's army began marching from the Thracesian Theme towards <a href="Abydos%20%28Hellespont%29">Abydos</a>, where he intended to cross over into Europe.

At this point, Thomas suffered his first reversal of fortune: before his departure for Abydos, he had sent an army under his adoptive son Constantius against the Armeniacs. Constantius was ambushed by "strategos" Olbianos and killed, although the army was able to withdraw with relatively few casualties. Constantius's severed head was sent to Michael, who dispatched it to Thomas at Abydos. Thomas was undaunted by this relatively minor setback, and crossed over into Europe some time in late October or early November. There, Constantius was soon replaced as co-emperor by another obscure individual, a former monk whom Thomas also adopted and named Anastasius.

Anticipating Thomas's move, Michael had gone out at the head of an army to the themes of <a href="Thrace%20%28theme%29">Thrace</a> and <a href="Macedonia%20%28theme%29">Macedonia</a> in Constantinople's European hinterland and strengthened the garrisons of several fortresses there to secure the loyalty of their populace. When Thomas landed, the people of the European themes welcomed him with enthusiasm, and Michael was forced to withdraw to Constantinople. Volunteers, including many Slavs, flocked to Thomas's banner. As he set out towards Constantinople, chroniclers recount that his army swelled to some 80,000 men. The capital was defended by the imperial "<a href="tagma%20%28military%29">tagma</a>ta", augmented by reinforcements from the Opsician and Armeniac themes. Michael had ordered the <a href="Walls%20of%20Constantinople">city walls</a> to be repaired, and chained off the entrance to the <a href="Golden%20Horn">Golden Horn</a>, while the Imperial Fleet further guarded the capital from the sea. Nevertheless, judging from Michael's passive stance, his forces were inferior to Thomas's; Warren Treadgold estimates Michael's army to have numbered approximately 35,000 men.

Thomas's fleet arrived at the capital first. Facing no opposition from the Imperial Fleet, the rebels broke or unfastened the chain and entered the Golden Horn, taking station near the mouths of the Barbysos river, where they awaited the arrival of Thomas and his army. Thomas arrived in early December. The sight of his huge force did not cow the capital's inhabitants: unlike the provinces, the capital's citizens and garrison stood firmly behind Michael. To further encourage his troops, Michael had his young son <a href="Theophilos%20%28emperor%29">Theophilos</a> lead a procession along the walls, carrying a piece of the <a href="True%20Cross">True Cross</a> and the mantle of the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>, while a large standard was hoisted on top of the <a href="Church%20of%20St.%20Mary%20of%20Blachernae%20%28Istanbul%29">Church of St. Mary</a> at <a href="Blachernae">Blachernae</a>, in full view of both armies.
After subduing the cities around the capital, Thomas resolved to attack Constantinople from three sides, perhaps hoping his assault would impress its inhabitants or lead to defections. His deputies Anastasius and Gregory Pterotos would attack the Theodosian land and sea walls, respectively, while he would lead the main attack against the less formidable defenses protecting Blachernae. All of Thomas's forces were amply supplied with siege engines and catapults, and his fleet fielded quantities of <a href="Greek%20fire">Greek fire</a> in addition to large shipborne catapults. Each of Thomas's attacks failed: the defenders' artillery proved superior and kept Thomas's engines away from the land walls, while adverse winds hindered the fleet from taking any meaningful action. Deciding that operations in the midst of winter were hazardous and unlikely to succeed, Thomas suspended all further attacks until spring and withdrew his army to winter quarters.
Michael used the respite to ferry in additional reinforcements from Asia Minor and repair the walls of Blachernae. When Thomas returned in spring, he decided to focus his attack on the Blachernae sector. Before the offensive, Michael himself ascended the walls and addressed Thomas's troops, exhorting them to abandon their commander and promising amnesty if they would defect. Thomas's army viewed the plea as a sign of weakness, and advanced confidently to begin the assault, but as they neared the wall, the defenders opened the gates and attacked. The sudden onslaught drove back Thomas's army; at the same time, the Imperial Fleet defeated Thomas's ships, whose crews broke and fled to the shore in panic. This defeat diminished Thomas's naval strength, and although he continued blockading the capital by land, the loss demoralized his supporters, who began defecting. Gregory Pterotos, whose family was in Michael's hands, resolved to desert Thomas, followed by a small band of men loyal to him. He departed the rebel camp, headed west, and sent a monk to inform Michael of his defection, but the monk failed to circumvent the blockade and reach the capital. Upon learning of this defection, Thomas reacted quickly: with a select detachment, he followed Gregory, defeated his troops and killed the deserter.
Thomas exploited this small victory for all it was worth, widely proclaiming that he had defeated Michael's troops "by land and sea". He sent messages to the themes of <a href="Greek%20peninsula">Greece</a>, whose support had been lukewarm until that point, demanding additional ships. The themes responded forcefully, sending their squadrons, allegedly numbering 350 vessels, to join him. Thus reinforced, Thomas decided to launch a two-pronged assault against Constantinople's sea walls, with his original fleet attacking the wall of the Golden Horn, and the new fleet attacking the south coast, looking towards the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a>. Michael, however, did not remain idle: his own fleet attacked the thematic force soon after it arrived at its anchorage in Byrida. Using Greek fire, the Imperial Fleet destroyed many of the rebel vessels and captured most of the remaining ships. Only a few managed to escape and rejoin Thomas's forces.

Through this victory, Michael secured control of the sea, but Thomas's army remained superior on land and continued its blockade of Constantinople. Minor skirmishes ensued for the remainder of the year, with Michael's forces sallying forth from the city to attack Thomas's forces. Although both sides claimed minor successes in these clashes, neither was able to gain a decisive advantage.
Michael turned to the empire's northern neighbour, <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgaria</a>, for help. The two states were bound by a <a href="Byzantine%E2%80%93Bulgarian%20Treaty%20of%20815">30-year treaty</a> signed under Leo V, and the Bulgarian ruler, khan <a href="Omurtag%20of%20Bulgaria">Omurtag</a> (r. 814–831), was happy to respond to Michael's request for assistance. A later tradition, reported by Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus, holds that Omurtag acted of his own accord and against Michael's will, but this is almost universally rejected as a version started or at least encouraged by Michael, who did not wish to be seen encouraging "barbarians" to invade the empire. The Bulgarian army invaded Thrace, probably in November 822 (Bury believes that the Bulgarian attack occurred in spring 823), and advanced towards Constantinople. Thomas raised the siege, and marched to meet them with his army. The two armies met at the plain of <a href="Kedouktos">Kedouktos</a> near <a href="Heraclea%20Perinthus">Heraclea</a> (hence known as the Battle of Kedouktos in the Byzantine sources) . The accounts of the subsequent battle differ: the later sources state that Thomas lost the battle, but the near-contemporary George the Monk states that Thomas "killed many Bulgarians". Given the lack of Bulgarian activity after the battle, most modern scholars (with the notable exception of Bury) believe that Thomas won the battle.

Thomas was unable to resume the siege: aside from the heavy casualties his army likely suffered, his fleet, which he had left behind in the Golden Horn, surrendered to Michael during his absence. Thomas set up camp at the plain of Diabasis some west of Constantinople, spending winter and early spring there. While a few of his men deserted, the bulk remained loyal. Finally, in late April or early May 823, Michael marched with his troops against Thomas, accompanied by the generals Olbianos and Katakylas with new troops from Asia Minor. Thomas marched to meet them and planned to use a stratagem to outwit his opponents: his men, ostensibly demoralized, would pretend to flee, and when the imperial army broke ranks to pursue them, they would turn back and attack. However, Thomas's troops were by now weary of the prolonged conflict, and their submission was unfeigned. Many surrendered to Michael, while others fled to nearby fortified cities. Thomas sought refuge in <a href="Arcadiopolis">Arcadiopolis</a> with a large group; his adopted son Anastasius went with some of Thomas's men to <a href="Bizye">Bizye</a>, and others fled to <a href="Panion">Panion</a> and Heraclea.
Michael blockaded Thomas's cities of refuge but organized no assaults, instead aiming to capture them peacefully by wearing out their defenders. His strategy was motivated by the political and propaganda expedient of appearing merciful—"in order to spare Christian blood", as Michael himself put it in his letter to Louis the Pious—but also, according to the chroniclers, by fear of demonstrating to the Bulgarians that the Byzantine cities' fortifications could fall to attack. In Asia Minor, Thomas's partisans hoped to lure Michael away by allowing the Arabs free passage to raid the provinces of <a href="Opsikion">Opsikion</a> and <a href="Optimaton">Optimaton</a>, which were loyal to the emperor. Michael was unmoved and continued the blockade. His troops barred access to Arcadiopolis with a ditch. To conserve supplies, the blockaded troops sent away women and children, followed by those too old, wounded, or otherwise incapable of bearing arms. After five months of blockade, Thomas's loyalists were eventually forced to eat starved horses and their hides. Some began deserting by lowering themselves with ropes over the city walls or jumping from them. Thomas sent messengers to Bizye, where the blockade was less close, to arrange a relief attempt by Anastasius. Before anything could be done, however, the exhausted troops at Arcadiopolis surrendered their leader in exchange for an imperial pardon. Thomas was delivered to Michael seated on a donkey and bound in chains. He was <a href="Prostration">prostrated</a> before the emperor, who placed his foot on his defeated rival's neck and ordered his hands and feet cut off and his corpse impaled. Thomas pleaded for clemency with the words "Have mercy on me, oh True Emperor!" Michael only asked his captive to reveal whether any of his own senior officials had had dealings with Thomas. Before Thomas could respond, the <a href="Logothetes%20tou%20dromou">Logothete of the Course</a>, John Hexaboulios, advised against hearing whatever claims a defeated rebel might make. Michael agreed, and Thomas's sentence was carried out immediately.

When the inhabitants of Bizye heard of Thomas's fate, they surrendered Anastasius, who suffered the same fate as Thomas. In Panion and Heraclea, Thomas's men held out until an earthquake struck in February 824. The tremor severely damaged the wall of Panion, and the city surrendered. The damage at Heraclea was less severe, but after Michael landed troops at its seaward side, it too was forced to surrender. In Asia Minor, Thomas's loyalists mostly submitted peacefully, but in the Cibyrrhaeot Theme, resistance lingered until suppressed by "strategos" John Echimos. In the Thracesian theme, Thomas's soldiers turned to <a href="brigandage">brigandage</a>. The most serious opposition was offered in central Asia Minor by two officers, who had possibly served Thomas as "strategoi": Choireus, with his base at Kaballa northwest of <a href="Iconium">Iconium</a>, and Gazarenos Koloneiates, based at Saniana, southeast of <a href="Ancyra">Ancyra</a>. From their strongholds, they spurned Michael's offer of a pardon and the high title of "<a href="magistros">magistros</a>" and raided the provinces that had gone over to him. Soon, however, Michael's agents persuaded the inhabitants of the two forts to shut their gates against the officers. Choireus and Koloneiates then tried to seek refuge in Arab territory but were attacked en route by loyalist troops, captured, and crucified.

The end of Thomas the Slav's great rebellion was marked by Michael II's <a href="Roman%20triumph">triumph</a>, held in May 824 in Constantinople. While he executed Thomas's volunteers from the Caliphate and perhaps also the Slavs, the sheer number of individuals involved, the necessity of appearing clement and sparing with Christian lives, and the need to restore internal tranquillity to his realm compelled Michael to treat Thomas's defeated partisans with leniency: most were released after being paraded in the <a href="Hippodrome%20of%20Constantinople">Hippodrome</a> during his celebration, and only the most dangerous were exiled to remote corners of the empire. In an effort to discredit his opponent, Michael authorized an "official" and heavily distorted version of Thomas's life and revolt. The document was written by the <a href="Ignatios%20the%20Deacon">deacon Ignatios</a> and published in 824 as "Against Thomas". This report quickly became the commonly accepted version of events.

Thomas failed in spite of his qualities and the widespread support he had gained, which brought him control of most of the empire. Lemerle holds that several factors played a role in his defeat: the Asian themes he did not subdue supplied reinforcements to Michael; Thomas's fleet performed badly; and the Bulgarian offensive diverted him away from the capital and weakened his army. But the most decisive obstacles were the impregnable walls of Constantinople, which ensured that an emperor who controlled Constantinople could only be overthrown from within the city.

Thomas's rebellion was the "central domestic event" of Michael II's reign, but it was not very destructive in material terms: except for Thrace, which had suffered from the prolonged presence of the rival armies and the battles fought there, the larger part of the empire was spared the ravages of war. The <a href="Byzantine%20navy">Byzantine navy</a> suffered great losses, with the thematic fleets in particular being devastated, while the land forces suffered comparatively few casualties. This is traditionally held to have resulted in a military weakness and internal disorder which was swiftly exploited by the Muslims: in the years after Thomas's rebellion, <a href="Al-Andalus">Andalusian</a> exiles captured <a href="Crete">Crete</a> and the <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>n <a href="Aghlabids">Aghlabids</a> began their <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Sicily">conquest of Sicily</a>, while in the East, the Byzantines were forced to maintain a generally defensive stance towards the Caliphate. More recent scholarship has disputed the degree to which the civil war was responsible for Byzantine military failures during these years, citing other reasons to explain them: Warren Treadgold opines that the empire's military forces recovered fairly quickly, and that incompetent military leadership coupled with "the remoteness of Sicily, the absence of regular troops on Crete, the simultaneity of the attacks on both islands, and the government's long-standing lack of interest in sea-power" were far more responsible for the loss of the islands.

Bob Windle

Robert George Windle (born 7 November 1944) is an Australian <a href="Freestyle%20swimming">freestyle</a> swimmer of the 1960s, who won four Olympic medals, including an individual gold medal. Windle won the 1500 m freestyle and took bronze in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay at the <a href="1964%20Summer%20Olympics">1964 Summer Olympics</a> in Tokyo, and silver and bronze in the 4 × 200 m and 4 × 100 m freestyle relays respectively at the <a href="1968%20Summer%20Olympics">1968 Summer Olympics</a>. Known for his versatility, he is the only male swimmer to represent Australia at the Olympics in all freestyle distances from 100 m to 1500 m. During his career, Windle set six world records and won six <a href="Commonwealth%20Games">Commonwealth Games</a> gold medals. He won 19 Australian championships in all distances from 220 yd to 1650 yd.

Growing up in eastern Sydney, Windle was trained by <a href="Frank%20Guthrie%20%28swimming%20coach%29">Frank Guthrie</a> from the age of 12. Windle's first major swimming competition was the 1960 Australian Championships. Aged 15, his second-place finish in the 1650 yd freestyle earned him a place on the team for the <a href="1960%20Summer%20Olympics">1960 Summer Olympics</a> in Rome. However, the Australian coaches only took him along to gain experience and he did not compete. He won his first national title in 1961—the 1650 yd freestyle—and claimed the 220–440–1650 yd treble in 1962. Windle made his international debut at the <a href="1962%20British%20Empire%20and%20Commonwealth%20Games">1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games</a> in <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth</a>, winning gold in the 4 × 220 yd freestyle and silver and bronze in the 1650 and 440 yd freestyle respectively. In 1963, he won four individual national titles, adding the 880 yd event to the successful defence of his three titles. He won three individual titles in 1964 and proceeded to the Tokyo Olympics where he was eliminated in the heats of the 400 m freestyle after attempting to save energy for the final. In response, Windle took an aggressive approach in the 1500 m and set Olympic records in the heats and final to win gold. He added a bronze in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay.

After the Olympics, Windle enrolled at <a href="Indiana%20University">Indiana University</a>, where he trained under <a href="Doc%20Counsilman">Doc Counsilman</a>. While in the United States, Windle converted to sprint swimming. He competed in the <a href="1966%20British%20Empire%20and%20Commonwealth%20Games">1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games</a> in <a href="Kingston%2C%20Jamaica">Kingston, Jamaica</a>, winning the 440 yd freestyle, 4 × 110 yd and 4 × 220 yd freestyle relays, all in world-record times. He competed in his second Olympics in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> in 1968, racing the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and the corresponding relays, having completed his transition to sprinting. He won a bronze and silver in the respective relays and retired after the games. In retirement, he worked for <a href="Allis-Chalmers">Allis-Chalmers</a> in the United States, before being transferred to their Australian division.

Born in Sydney on 7 November 1944, Windle grew up in the eastern Sydney suburb of <a href="Waverley%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Waverley</a>. Windle and his sister Norma learnt to swim at nearby <a href="Bronte%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bronte Beach</a>. His family later relocated to <a href="Bexley%20North%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bexley North</a>, and he swam for his school team at <a href="Marist%20College%20Kogarah">Marist College Kogarah</a>. Windle was coached by <a href="Frank%20Guthrie%20%28swimming%20coach%29">Frank Guthrie</a> at the <a href="Enfield%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Enfield</a> pool from the age of 12. After a fortnight of training, he entered the district age group championships and won a place in the top three. From then on, he began training three or four times a week, and his father drove him to Enfield for morning training. By the age of 15, he was training every day.

A turning point for Windle was the 1960 Australian Championships; he came second in the 1650 yd freestyle behind <a href="John%20Konrads">John Konrads</a> and was selected for the <a href="1960%20Summer%20Olympics">1960 Summer Olympics</a> in Rome. He dropped out of high school to attend a three-month training camp in <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> with the Olympic swimming team. Windle did not swim in Rome; team officials merely wanted him to learn from the routine and atmosphere of Olympic swimming. On his return to Australia, he switched to the tutelage of <a href="Don%20Talbot">Don Talbot</a>, who also coached Konrads.

Talbot nicknamed Windle "the <a href="greyhound">greyhound</a>" because of his thin and angular build. As a result of Windle's small build, he took between 45 and 47 strokes to complete a lap, but fellow distance swimmer <a href="Murray%20Rose">Murray Rose</a> needed only 35 to 37 strokes. Talbot said that Windle was the most thinly built elite swimmer that he had trained, and had great trouble in trying to increase Windle's frame. Talbot motivated Windle and instilled him with a greater level of self belief. For his part, Windle responded by increasing his workload, and was regarded as Talbot's most diligent student. Windle trained with a determination that often saw him swim through others who were in his training lane. These collisions led to complaints by recreational swimmers that Windle was too aggressive. He often did twice as much pre-season training as the other swimmers in Talbot's squad. According to Talbot, Windle's weakness was that he was only capable of swimming in two ways, flat out or very slowly. Windle had trouble in pacing himself to conserve energy for later events. Talbot lamented to "never [being] astute enough to realise that he [Windle] didn't have the subtleties of pace that would have added to his armament as a swimmer".

At the 1961 Australian Championships, Windle won the 1500 m in a time of 17 min 37.7 s to claim his first Australian title at the age of 16. However, his victory was overshadowed when his <a href="Swimsuit">bathers</a> partly fell off during the race. In the following year, Windle showed his versatility by winning the 220 yd, 440 yd and 1650 yd freestyle events, in times of 2 min 2.9 s, 4 min 25.0 s and 17 min 53.3 s respectively. He also anchored the New South Wales team to victory in the 4 × 220 yd freestyle relay. Selected for the <a href="1962%20British%20Empire%20and%20Commonwealth%20Games">1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games</a> in <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth</a>, he marked his international debut with silver and bronze in the 1650 yd and 440 yd freestyle respectively. Murray Rose, who had returned from competition in the United States college system, won both events. Rose won the 1650 yd event, finishing in 17 min 18.1 s, with Windle 26.4 s in arrears. In the 440 yd event, Rose finished in a time of 4 min 20.0 s, 3.1 s ahead of the third-placed Windle. Windle also won gold in the 4 × 220 yd freestyle relay, along with Rose, <a href="Allan%20Wood">Allan Wood</a> and <a href="Anthony%20Strahan">Anthony Strahan</a>, setting a world record in the process.

With Rose absent in the United States, Windle won the 220 yd, 440 yd, 880 yd and 1650 yd freestyle at the 1963 Australian Championships, in times of 2 min 2.8 s, 4 min 23.0 s, 9 min 10.5 s and 17 min 59.6 s respectively. His quest to sweep all of the freestyle events failed when <a href="David%20Dickson%20%28swimmer%29">David Dickson</a> defeated him in a touch finish in the 110 yd race. The pair were neck and neck but Dickson judged the finishing touch on the wall better. Windle collected two more wins as part of the New South Wales team in the 4 × 220 yd and the 4 × 110 yd freestyle relays, anchoring both quartets.

Windle set world records in the 200 m and 220 yd freestyle in 1963, posting times of 2 min 0.3 s and 2 min 1.1 s respectively. He won three individual titles at the 1964 Australian Championships, the 200 m, 400 m and 1500 m freestyle in times of 2 min 0.0 s, 4 min 17.6 s and 17 min 9.4 s respectively. As it was an Olympic year, the competition was held over metric distances, in conformance with Olympic standards. Windle was a member of all three New South Wales relay teams as they swept the relay events, winning the 400 m and 800 m freestyle and 400 m medley relays.

Windle's performances qualified him for the <a href="1964%20Summer%20Olympics">1964 Summer Olympics</a> in Tokyo, where he was slated to swim four events: the 400 m and 1500 m freestyle and the 4 × 100 m and 4 × 200 m freestyle relays. Windle's first event was the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, where he combined with Dickson, <a href="Peter%20Doak">Peter Doak</a>, and <a href="John%20Ryan%20%28swimmer%29">John Ryan</a> to win Australia's heat in a time of 3 min 40.6 s, which lagged behind the United States' winning heat time by 1.8 s. Windle anchored the team as Australia came from second at the halfway point to win their heat. The Australians were the second fastest qualifier for the finals. However, the United States improved their time by a further 5.6 s in the final, but Australia could only improve their time to 3 min 39.1 s, leaving them third behind the Americans and Germans. Australia were in second place for the first two legs, until Germany moved into the silver medal position at the last change by 0.1 s. A distance swimmer, Windle could not keep up with his German anchorman counterpart, and Australia fell 1.9 s behind the silver medalists by the end of the race.

In the 400 m freestyle heats, Windle and Talbot made a misjudgement; in an attempt to conserve his energy for the final they decided that Windle should not go flat out, and Windle was four seconds slower than he was at the Australian Championships. Windle was one of the top seeds for the race, and Talbot advised him to swim hard in the first half of the race before slowing down. However, he swam too slowly and missed the final completely. Although he won his heat by seven seconds in a time of 4 min 21.6 s, he was the ninth fastest overall, so he missed the final by one position with a time deficit of 0.5 s. The slowest qualifier was <a href="Tsuyoshi%20Yamanaka">Tsuyoshi Yamanaka</a>, who had been prevented from withdrawing from the race by his coaches. On the other hand, the two other Australian representatives who he defeated at the national championships did make the final, including Wood, who went on to win bronze. Talbot said that the tactical error was mostly his responsibility and that he learnt a lot from it.

In the 1500 m, Talbot decided that Windle would attack from the outset and attempt to hang on in the latter stages of the race. They also worked on Windle's technique, curing his habit of dropping his elbow to a lower position when he was tired. Windle broke the Olympic record in the heats with a time of 17 min 15.9 s to qualify fastest for the final by more than six seconds. In the final, Windle repeated the strategy of sprinting from the start, leading throughout to lower his own Olympic record to 17 min 1.7 s and holding off American <a href="John%20Nelson%20%28swimmer%29">John Nelson</a> by 1.3 s. Windle's tactics disrupted the raceplan of the Americans; Nelson and world record holder <a href="Roy%20Saari">Roy Saari</a> had planned to pace each other throughout the race, but ended up reacting to Windle instead of swimming their own race. As a result, Saari finished in seventh place, far outside his global standard.

Windle later combined with Wood, Ryan and Dickson in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay final. Having rested their two individual medalists—Wood and Windle—in the heats, Australia struggled to fourth place and were the slowest qualifier for the final. In the decider, Australia were fourth when Windle dived in for the anchor leg, 3.7 s behind the third-placed Japan. Windle posted a time of 1 min 58.7 s, the sixth fastest split in the race and the fastest Australian leg by 3.0 s. Although he made up 1.8 s on the Japanese anchor swimmer, it was not enough and Australia finished fourth, 1.9 s out of the medals.

After the Olympics, Windle enrolled at <a href="Indiana%20University">Indiana University</a>—whose <a href="Indiana%20Hoosiers">Indiana Hoosiers</a> swimming team was coached by <a href="Doc%20Counsilman">Doc Counsilman</a>—on an athletic scholarship. He did so after getting advice from Australian teammate, Olympic gold medallist and Indiana student <a href="Kevin%20Berry">Kevin Berry</a>. He studied business while competing for the university, where he switched his focus to shorter sprint distances. Windle did not enjoy as much success at short-course swimming in the United States as he did in long-course swimming. He cited the lack of enjoyment for switching to shorter distances, quipping "Why swim 30 laps for a gold, when you can get one for swimming two laps?" However, Windle enjoyed his time in the United States, approving of the additional emphasis on relays and team spirit and the social life that it entailed. Windle also enjoyed learning from Counsilman, who was regarded as an expert in mechanics, resulting in an improvement in his swimming technique.

Windle's performances in the United States for Indiana earned him selection for the <a href="1966%20Commonwealth%20Games">1966 Commonwealth Games</a> in <a href="Kingston%2C%20Jamaica">Kingston, Jamaica</a>. He won the 440 yd freestyle in a world record time of 4 min 15.0 s, but with his focus now on the shorter distances, only managed fourth in the 1650 yd freestyle with a time of 17 min 49.2 s, 4% slower than his personal best for the distance. He won golds in the 4 × 110 yd freestyle relay with Ryan, Dickson and <a href="Michael%20Wenden">Michael Wenden</a> and the 4 × 220 yd freestyle with Wenden, Dickson and <a href="Peter%20Reynolds">Peter Reynolds</a>. The times of 3 min 35.6 s and 7 min 59.5 s, respectively, were world records.

In 1967, Windle retired, but made a comeback to compete in the shorter distances after being persuaded by Talbot. In 1968, Windle anchored Indiana's 880 yd freestyle relay to victory at the <a href="NCAA%20Men%27s%20Swimming%20and%20Diving%20Championships">National Collegiate Athletic Association Men's Swimming and Diving Championships</a>, sealing what would be the first of six consecutive men's team titles for the university. He then competed in the Australian Championships for the first time in four years. Although he did not win any individual events, he was part of New South Wales' winning quartets in the 4 × 100 m and 4 × 200 m freestyle relays. Windle was appointed the captain of the men's Olympic swimming team, gaining selection for the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events and the respective freestyle relays. He was not selected for the 1500 m freestyle, ending the defence of his Olympic title before the team had reached <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>.

In the 100 m freestyle, Windle came second in his heat in a time of 54.8 s, making him the sixth fastest qualifier for the semifinals. He improved his time to 54.6 s in the semifinals, but this placed him only 11th and he missed the final by 0.5 s. In the 200 m freestyle, Windle came second in his heat behind Wenden and scraped into the final by 0.3 s as the seventh fastest qualifier. He improved his time by 0.1 s in the final to finish sixth in 2 min 0.9 s. Wenden won both events. After the 200 m final, Wenden lost consciousness due to exhaustion and sank underwater. Wenden was pulled from the water and saved after Windle noticed the incident.

In the 4 × 100 m freestyle, Windle combined with Wenden, <a href="Robert%20Cusack">Robert Cusack</a> and <a href="Greg%20Rogers">Greg Rogers</a> to win bronze behind the United States and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Australia used the same team and swimming order in both the heats and finals, with Windle doing the third leg. Australia came second in their heat behind the United States and qualified third overall, and the Soviet Union were the second fastest. It was a similar story in the final; Australia were third at every change. Despite Wenden anchoring the Australians with the fastest split among all 32 swimmers in the race, the Australians missed the silver medal by just 0.5 s. In the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay, Windle won a silver along with Wenden, Rogers and <a href="Graham%20White%20%28swimmer%29">Graham White</a>. The quartet won their heat and qualified fastest, while the Americans qualified second with their second-choice team. However, using their full-strength team in the final, the Americans won by 1.4 s. Australia were 2.5 s behind at the halfway point of the race, but the Americans were able to hold on, despite the gains made by Windle and Wenden in the last two legs.

Windle retired after the Games, noting that "I have swum to that point when I could hardly lift myself out of the water. I have seen John Konrads to that point also. I would always give 110%. There is no substitute for hard and honest work". Windle was usually regarded as the fittest and hardest-working member of the Australian swimming team. In retirement, Windle stayed in the United States for a few more years, working for <a href="Allis-Chalmers">Allis-Chalmers</a>, an agricultural equipment corporation. He returned home after being transferred to the Australian division of the firm's operations. Windle was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1987 and the <a href="International%20Swimming%20Hall%20of%20Fame">International Swimming Hall of Fame</a> in 1990.

Ian O'Brien

Ian Lovett O'Brien (born 3 March 1947) is an Australian <a href="breaststroke">breaststroke</a> <a href="swimming%20%28sport%29">swimmer</a> of the 1960s who won the <a href="Swimming%20at%20the%201964%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20200%20metre%20breaststroke">200 metre breaststroke</a> at the <a href="1964%20Summer%20Olympics">1964 Summer Olympics</a> in Tokyo in world record time. He won five <a href="Commonwealth%20Games">Commonwealth Games</a> gold medals and claimed a total of nine individual and six <a href="Relay%20race%23Relays%20in%20swimming">relay</a> titles at the <a href="Australian%20Swimming%20Championships">Australian Championships</a>, before retiring at the age of 21 due to financial pressures.

After showing promise at an early age, O'Brien was sent to <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> to train under renowned coach <a href="Forbes%20Carlile">Forbes Carlile</a> and his breaststroke assistant <a href="Terry%20Gathercole">Terry Gathercole</a>. He competed in his first national championships in 1962 at the age of 15, winning the 220 yard breaststroke to gain selection for the <a href="1962%20British%20Empire%20and%20Commonwealth%20Games">1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games</a> in Perth, where he won both the 110 and breaststroke and the 4 × 110 yd <a href="medley%20swimming">medley relay</a>.

He won both breaststroke events at the 1963 Australian Championships, repeating the feat for the next three years. In 1964, O'Brien went to the Tokyo Olympics and came from third at the 150 m mark to win the gold medal. He added a bronze in the medley relay. O'Brien successfully defended both his breaststroke titles at the <a href="1966%20British%20Empire%20and%20Commonwealth%20Games">1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games</a> in Kingston, Jamaica before retiring to support his family. Swimming officials persuaded him to make a comeback for the <a href="1968%20Summer%20Olympics">1968 Summer Olympics</a> in Mexico City, as Australia did not have a breaststroker, and after a <a href="crash%20diet">crash diet</a>, he finished sixth in the 100 m event but failed to reach the final in the 200 m event. He then retired and went into the television industry.

O'Brien grew up in the rural town of <a href="Wellington%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Wellington</a>, 360 kilometres (225 miles) from Sydney. Neither of his parents were skilled swimmers. His father Roy knew only one swimming stroke—the breaststroke—and his mother Thelma did not take her first swimming lesson until she was 55. O'Brien's sister Ann was a talented swimmer in her childhood years, but she preferred horseback riding. The local pool was an old-style facility that had no pump system and was only manually drained once a week. Aged four, O'Brien got his first swimming lessons from the local Learn to Swim program. There were not many non-sporting activities for children in Wellington, and O'Brien played basketball and <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a>, did athletics and swimming, and rode horses. In 1954, a <a href="swimming%20pool%20sanitation">chlorinated</a> pool was built in the town, leading to the formation of Wellington Swimming Club. At the age of 10, O'Brien began competitive swimming under local coach Bert Eslick, and raced in regional country swimming carnivals at <a href="Dubbo">Dubbo</a>, <a href="Bathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bathurst</a> and <a href="Orange%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Orange</a>.

After winning all the breaststroke events at the country championships, O'Brien was taken by his father to the <a href="Ryde%20Aquatic%20Leisure%20Centre">Ryde pool</a> in Sydney in 1960, to be coached by <a href="Forbes%20Carlile">Forbes Carlile</a> and his assistant, retired world record-breaking breaststroker <a href="Terry%20Gathercole">Terry Gathercole</a>. Carlile was regarded as the leading swimming coach in Australia at the time. At age 13, O'Brien was already a large teenager, weighing in at 82.6 kg. He only trained with Gathercole during holidays, when his father could take him to Sydney; Jim Wilkins, a Catholic priest in Bathurst, supervised him according to Gathercole's program while he was in the countryside. Within a year, O'Brien rose from being a country carnival champion to a national-level athlete, despite the death of his father in the same year.

In 1962, O'Brien gained selection for the Australian swimming team at the age of 15 when he won the 220 yard (yd) breaststroke at his first Australian Championships in the time of 2 minutes (min) 41.8 seconds (s). He added a second gold as part of the <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> team that won the 4 × 100 m medley relay in a time of 4 min 18.3 s. His performances gained him selection for the <a href="1962%20British%20Empire%20and%20Commonwealth%20Games">1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games</a> in Perth. At his first international competition, he won gold in each of his three events. He competed in the and breaststroke, defeating fellow Australian <a href="William%20Burton%20%28swimmer%29">William Burton</a> in both events with times of 1 min 11.4s and 2 min 38.1 s, respectively. He then completed his campaign with a victory in the 4 × 110 yd medley relay, combining with <a href="Julian%20Carroll%20%28swimmer%29">Julian Carroll</a>, <a href="Kevin%20Berry">Kevin Berry</a> and <a href="David%20Dickson%20%28swimmer%29">David Dickson</a> to complete the race in a time of 4 min 12.4 s.

In 1963, O'Brien captured the breaststroke double at the Australian Championships, setting personal bests in both events, and was a member of the New South Wales team that won the medley relay. His performances earned him selection for an overseas tour to Europe with the Australian team, competing in the Soviet Union, Germany and England before visiting Japan and Hong Kong. O'Brien defended his breaststroke double at the 1964 Australian Championships, lowering his times to 1 min 8.1 s and 2 min 32.6 s for the 100 metres (m) and 200 m breaststroke respectively. He capped off his campaign as well as a third consecutive medley relay triumph for New South Wales. Within a year, he had reduced his times in the two events by more than 3%. As O'Brien was widely regarded as Australia's best breaststroker, he was selected for the <a href="1964%20Summer%20Olympics">1964 Summer Olympics</a> in Tokyo. O'Brien joined the rest of the team for the national camp before the Olympics in <a href="Ayr%2C%20Queensland">Ayr</a> in northern Queensland, where he trained under head coach <a href="Don%20Talbot">Don Talbot</a>. O'Brien described Talbot as a "slavedriver", but felt that the experience was invaluable.

Arriving in Tokyo, O'Brien was nominated in the 200 m event and the medley relay; the 100 m event was yet to be included in the Olympic program. The favourites for the 200 m breaststroke were <a href="Chet%20Jastremski">Chet Jastremski</a> of the United States—the world record holder—and <a href="Georgy%20Prokopenko">Georgy Prokopenko</a> of the Soviet Union. Gathercole had modelled O'Brien's technique on that of Jastremski, attempting to refine and smoothen it. Years after O'Brien retired, <a href="Harry%20Gallagher%20%28swimmer%29">Harry Gallagher</a> said that "Ian O'Brien has an almost faultless style and is a great example for Australian youngsters to copy". O'Brien was known for the strength that his torso generated, and his powerful kicks; <a href="sports%20science">sports science</a> experiments showed that his <a href="vertical%20jump">vertical jump</a> was especially strong. O'Brien was also known for his efficient start off the block. He often gained a lead of approximately a metre from his dive and underwater glide at the start, and was able to complete 50 m in 31.0 s.

During the final training sessions in Tokyo, Talbot organised time trials for the Australians, which were held in front of opposition swimmers in an attempt to intimidate them. O'Brien posted a time of 2 min 33 s, which Talbot felt had a negative psychological effect on O'Brien's opponents. When competition started, O'Brien swam an Olympic record to win the first <a href="tournament">heat</a> by 2.0 s. He posted a time of 2 min 31.4 s, reducing the previous Olympic mark by 5.8 s, an indication of how much the world record had fallen in the preceding four years. However, in the next heat, <a href="Egon%20Henninger">Egon Henninger</a> of Germany immediately lowered the mark, and by the end of the heats, O'Brien was the fourth fastest qualifier for the semifinals, with both Prokopenko and Jastremski posting faster times. O'Brien lowered Henninger's Olympic record by winning the second semifinal in a time of 2 min 28.7 s, after Jastremski had won the first semifinal in a time that was 3.4 s slower than O'Brien. This made O'Brien the fastest qualifier for the final, with a time that was 1.0 s faster than the next qualifier Prokopenko, who came second to him in the second semifinal. O'Brien planned to swim the race at an even pace and record even splits for the first and second half of the race. He was mindful of not chasing Jastremski, who was known for an aggressive opening style, which resulted in a faster first half.

In the final, Jastremski attacked from the outset as expected, while O'Brien raced with a characteristically even pace. After being fourth at the halfway mark behind Jastremski, Prokopenko and Henninger, O'Brien panicked and accelerated in the third 50 m and overtook Jastremski, leaving the American in fourth place. He then moved past Henninger, before overtaking Prokopenko. O'Brien's acceleration in the third meant that he tired at the end, but he had enough energy to fend off Prokopenko in the late stages to win the gold medal in a new world record time of 2 min 27.8 s, a margin of 0.4 s, with Jastremski a further 1.4 s in arrears. O'Brien had reduced his personal best time by more than four seconds during the Olympics to claim an upset win.

The Australian coaches rested O'Brien for the heats of the 4 × 100 m medley relay; Peter Tonkin swam the breaststroke leg instead. It turned out to be a close call for the Australians, as they finished fourth in their heat and qualified seventh fastest, only 1.2 s from elimination. In the final, O'Brien was brought into the team to combine with <a href="Peter%20Reynolds">Peter Reynolds</a>, Berry and Dickson. At the end of Reynolds' <a href="backstroke">backstroke</a> leg, Australia were sixth, 3.4 s behind the American leaders. O'Brien dived in and completed his leg in 1 min 7.8 s, a breaststroke split bettered by only Henninger and Prokopenko. This pulled Australia up to fourth position, 1.7 s in arrears of the Americans at the halfway mark. Australia progressed further to finish third behind the United States and Germany in a time of 4 min 2.3 s, missing the silver by 0.7 s.

O'Brien completed a hat-trick of breaststroke doubles at the 1965 Australian Championships, but in a year with no international competition, he swam much slower times of 1 min 11.1 s and 2 min 38.6 s respectively. He completed a fourth consecutive medley relay win with New South Wales. At the 1966 Australian Championships, his times were again slower, at 1 min 11.8 s and 2 min 41.6 s respectively, more than 4% slower than his personal bests, but it was still enough to retain his titles and qualify for the <a href="1966%20British%20Empire%20and%20Commonwealth%20Games">1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games</a> in Kingston, Jamaica. Critics had written him off, because just six weeks before the competition, he was 16 kg overweight. However, he returned to his peak form by the time the team reached Jamaica, where he won both breaststroke events with times of 1 min 8.2 s and 2 min 29.3 s respectively. His winning run in the 4 × 100 m medley relay came to an end when the Australians were disqualified for an illegal changeover.

In 1967, O'Brien skipped the Australian Championships because he had no sponsorship and ran out of money, forcing him to seek full-time work. In 1968, despite Graham Edwards winning the National 200 m breaststroke title, the <a href="Swimming%20Australia">Australian Swimming Union</a> persuaded an overweight O'Brien to make a comeback in 1968 on the grounds that Australia did not have a quality breaststroker for the Olympics. Undergoing a crash diet and fitness program, O'Brien lost 12.7 kg in twelve weeks of intense training. O'Brien was unable to reclaim either of his individual Australian titles, but New South Wales again won the medley relay. Nevertheless, he was selected for his second Olympics.

At the <a href="1968%20Summer%20Olympics">1968 Summer Olympics</a> in Mexico City, O'Brien placed second in his heat of the 200 m breaststroke in a time of 2 min 36.8 s, which placed him 13th. He was eliminated, having been 2.9 s slower than the last-placed qualifier for the final. The eventual winner posted a time 0.9 s slower than that of O'Brien four years earlier. O'Brien did better in the newly introduced 100 m event, winning his heat in a time of 1 min 8.9 s to qualify second-fastest for the semifinals. O'Brien scraped into the final after coming second in his semifinal in a time of 1 min 9.0 s. It was the barest of margins; O'Brien was the slowest qualifier and could not be electronically separated from the ninth-fastest semifinalist, with judges being used to decide the placings. O'Brien went on to finish sixth in a time of 1 min 8.6 s.

O'Brien narrowly missed a medal in the 4 ×  100 m medley relay. Along with <a href="Michael%20Wenden">Michael Wenden</a>, <a href="Robert%20Cusack">Robert Cusack</a> and <a href="Karl%20Byrom">Karl Byrom</a>, the Australian quartet won their heat and entered the final as the equal fifth fastest qualifier. In the final, O'Brien swam his leg in 1 min 8.6 s, which was only the fifth fastest breaststroke leg. Australia were fourth at the end of each leg, except O'Brien's, when they were third. Australia eventually missed out on the bronze by 0.1 s to the Soviet Union. O'Brien admitted that his training had been insufficient for Olympic standards, noting that "I needed to put on another thousand kilometres in training". O'Brien also rued the absence of Talbot to motivate him to work, and had a further accident at the Olympic Village when his fingers were slammed by a closing window. Under competition regulations, he was not allowed to bind his hand during competition.

At age 21, O'Brien retired after the 1968 Olympics, so he could concentrate solely on making a living. Since his father's death in 1962, O'Brien's swimming career had caused substantial financial stress for his family, with his mother having to sell the family home to make ends meet. O'Brien had also been forced to leave high school before he had completed his leaving certificate, so that he could support the family's income by wrapping parcels. Television and camera work had always interested O'Brien, and he secured a job as a stagehand for <a href="Nine%20Network">Channel Nine</a> after returning from the Tokyo Olympics, which he held for more than ten years. He then worked for <a href="Ten%20Network">Channel Ten</a> for two years, before working for an independent production company for another two years. In 1979, he started Videopak, which became one of the largest privately owned television documentary companies in Australia. Videopak's sound stages were used by public and private television companies. O'Brien was inducted into the <a href="Sport%20Australia%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Sport Australia Hall of Fame</a> in 1986. In 2000, he received an <a href="Australian%20Sports%20Medal">Australian Sports Medal</a>.

Final Fantasy Type-0

The story focuses on Class Zero, a group of fourteen students from the Vermillion Peristylium, a magical academy in the Dominion of Rubrum. When the Militesi Empire launches an assault on the other Crystal States of Orience, seeking to control their respective crystals, Class Zero is mobilized for the defense of Rubrum. Eventually, the group becomes entangled in the secrets behind both the war and the reason for their existence. The setting and presentation were inspired by historical documentaries, and the story itself was written to be darker than other "Final Fantasy" titles.

The game was originally announced as a title for mobile phones and the PSP called It was directed by <a href="Hajime%20Tabata">Hajime Tabata</a>, who took up the project after completing "". Initially designed to provide players with easy access to the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" universe, the mobile version was eventually cancelled and the game's title was changed to distance it from the subseries' flagship title "Final Fantasy XIII". Releasing to strong sales, it received praise for its story and gameplay, but was criticized for its camera control and <a href="Artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">artificial intelligence</a>. Further games related to "Type-0" have also been developed, including a <a href="Final%20Fantasy%20Type-0%20HD">high definition remaster</a> that released internationally in March 2015.
"Final Fantasy Type-0" is an <a href="action%20role-playing%20video%20game">action role-playing video game</a> in which the player controls the 14 members of Class Zero, who are sent on missions across Orience. Outside environments such as the Vermillion Peristylium (Class Zero's home base) and dedicated missions, the game world of Orience is navigated via a scaled-down <a href="overworld">world map</a>. Class Zero are sent on missions across Orience during the course of the game. The player initially travels to preset destinations in the world on an airship supplied by the Peristylium, but gains their own airship to freely navigate the world map with after defeating a powerful enemy guarding it. The main gameplay is presented in a mission-based structure. The two types of missions encountered are story-based missions, and "Practice" missions, which act as side-quests. During missions, optional orders are issued which can be obeyed or ignored as the player chooses. Should they be accepted, the characters receive a temporary power boost, and completing the objectives yields rewards. Players can also engage in real-time strategy battles on the world map, with the player taking control of allied military divisions. Missions involve liberating cities and towns from enemy forces. Timed aerial missions are also available where the characters shoot down attacking dragons using their airship's weapons.

While outside combat, players can breed <a href="chocobo">chocobo</a>s, recurring <a href="galliform">galliform</a> birds in the "Final Fantasy" series. Players must capture two chocobos on the world map and take them to a special ranch within the Peristylium: by pairing certain chocobos and adding specific items, a special chocobo can be bred for use. Players can visit the Peristylium Crystarium to review defeated enemies, character information, in-game lore and special video clips. <a href="Character%20design%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%23Moogle">Moogles</a>, another recurring creature in the series, hand out missions to the player: the objectives of missions can change during gameplay. Items and new equipment can be bought from shops managed by <a href="non-player%20character">non-player character</a>s (NPCs) both within the Peristylium and across Orience. Towns liberated during missions give access to a wider range of shops. After completing the game once, players unlock a "<a href="New%20Game%2B">New Game+</a>" option: in this mode, players keep their stats and weapons from the previous playthrough, while also unlocking story scenes and character-specific missions. "Type-0" features three difficulty levels; "normal", "hard", and "impossible".

"Type-0" uses a <a href="Real-time%20game">real-time</a>, <a href="Action%20role-playing%20game">action-based</a> battle system similar to the system used in "". The player is allowed access to three characters, which they can swap between at any time. The two not being controlled are managed by the game's <a href="Artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">artificial intelligence</a>. Each character has a specific weapon, and special attacks unique to a character are unlocked as they gain <a href="experience%20level">experience level</a>s. During combat, characters lock onto targets while attacking and can switch targets. Characters are able to perform precisely timed attacks during the period when an enemy unit is attacking: the "Break Sight", which deals high damage, and the "Kill Sight", which kills a standard enemy with a single hit. Three characters can also be commanded to use a combining their attacks to deal higher damage to a target. Aside from human enemies, the game features multiple recurring "Final Fantasy" monsters. In addition to enemies encountered in missions, there are special enemies that can be encountered while exploring the world map.

Defeated enemy units drop a substance called Phantoma. The color of Phantoma indicates what aspect of the character it will replenish, though in general they automatically replenish a set amount of <a href="Magic%20%28gaming%29">magic points</a>. Phantoma are used in the game's leveling system, the Altocrystarium, to strengthen a character's magic skills. The game's magic skills are divided into five basic groups named after types of guns: for example, "Rifle" fires the spell in a straight line, while "Missile" homes in on and chases targeted enemies. Holding down the assigned action button increases the power of the attack. Many combat situations involve timed challenges. Success rewards the character, while failure drains their health. If a character is defeated in battle, the player can instantly select another to replace it, and the defeated character must be revived outside the mission. The game features an arena where practice fights take place. While these fights are not against real foes, the characters continue to <a href="experience%20point">level up</a> and gain Phantoma after the battle, and twenty battles can be arranged at any one time. Each character has access to <a href="Gameplay%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%23Magic">summoned monsters</a> called which act as temporary playable characters and have their own set of skills. Summoning them empties the selected character's health gauge, removing them from battle until they are revived. Summons are also affected by the current environment: as an example, Shiva's powers are stronger in snowy weather. After a limited time in battle, the Eidolons are dismissed. Those available to players are series staples Shiva, Ifrit, Golem, Odin, Diablos and Bahamut. Each Eidolon has variants of its original form, many of which are unlocked as the game progresses.

Characters can continue to level up through activities within the Peristylium while the PSP is in sleep mode, the game's <a href="Universal%20Media%20Disc">UMD</a> is running, and the PSP is charging. The multiplayer function, activated through the game's configuration screen, allows two other players to jump into another host player's game via an online connection. The allotted time for multiplayer is limited to a few minutes, with transitions between zones triggering the end of a multiplayer section. The time limit can be extended by players helping their current host. The first and last segments of the game are not open to multiplayer. There is also a function called Magical Academy Assist, in which NPCs named after members of the game's production team are summoned into battle to assist the cadets.

"Note: The plot of Type-0 is the same in its original version and the high-definition remaster <a href="Final%20Fantasy%20Type-0%20HD">Final Fantasy Type-0 HD</a>, so the terms and quotes used in the text are from the localization of the high-definition remaster rather than unofficial translations."

"Final Fantasy Type-0" is set within Orience, a land divided between four nations or "Crystal States". Each nation has crystals of power based on the <a href="Four%20Symbols%20%28China%29">Four Symbols</a>, which are in turn their national emblems. The Dominion of Rubrum uses the <a href="Vermilion%20Bird">Vermillion Bird</a> Crystal, which controls magic; the Milites Empire controls the <a href="White%20Tiger%20%28China%29">White Tiger</a> Crystal, containing the power of science and weapons; the Kingdom of Concordia uses the <a href="Azure%20Dragon">Azure Dragon</a> Crystal, containing the power of Dragons; and the Lorican Alliance is home to the <a href="Black%20Tortoise">Black Tortoise</a> Crystal, containing the power of shielding. Each nation has an academy, or Peristylium, to research and protect the country's respective crystal. The crystals have the ability to mark humans as their countries' servants. These servants, called l'Cie, are branded with a symbol and are given a "Focus", a task to complete. While blessed with long life and the ability to transform into crystal, l'Cie are cursed to lose their memories over time. The people of Orience also lose their memories of the dead so they will not be held back by any past regrets and continue strengthening their souls through conflict, a mechanism put in place by the crystals for the convenience of the deities who crafted them. The main aim of many characters is to become Agito, a legendary figure who will appear and save the world from Tempus Finis, an apocalyptic event that will destroy Orience.

The main characters of "Final Fantasy Type-0" are Class Zero, an elite group of 14 students from the Vermillion Peristylium.

Supporting Class Zero are their mentor <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20Type-0%20and%20Agito%23Kurasame%20Susaya">Kurasame Susaya</a>, and <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20Type-0%20and%20Agito%23Arecia%20Al-Rashia">Arecia Al-Rashia</a>, Class Zero's former mentor and the overseer for magical development at the Vermillion Peristylium. Other important characters from Rubrum are <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20Type-0%20and%20Agito%23Dominion%20of%20Rubrum">Khalia Chival VI</a>, the current leader of Rubrum and headmaster of the Vermillion Peristyrium, and the l'Cie <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20Type-0%20and%20Agito%23Dominion%20of%20Rubrum">Caetuna</a>. Multiple Militesi figures, led by Marshal <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20Type-0%20and%20Agito%23Cid%20Aulstyne">Cid Aulstyne</a>, act as the game's main antagonists. Other important characters include the Concordian queen <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20Type-0%20and%20Agito%23Kingdom%20of%20Concordia">Andoria</a>, <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20Type-0%20and%20Agito%23Gala">Gala</a>, leader of the Rursus Army and the instigator of Tempus Finis, and <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20Type-0%20and%20Agito%23Joker">Joker</a> and <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20Type-0%20and%20Agito%23Tiz">Tiz</a>, two mysterious figures who observe the events of the game.

Marshal Cid Aulstyne leads the army of Milites against the other nations of Orience, launching a devastating attack against the Vermillion Peristylium and neutralising the Vermillion Bird Crystal using a crystal jammer. Class Zero, immune to the effects of the jammer, repel the invasion. During the conflict Izana Kunagiri, Machina's older brother, is killed while on a mission for Class Zero. This event later creates a rift between Machina and Class Zero. Coordinated by Kurasame and Arecia Al-Rashia, Class Zero plays a key role in freeing Rubrum's territories and launching counterattacks in alliance with Concordia, while Lorica's capital is destroyed by a Militesi bomb. Andoria, Concordia's queen, then forces a ceasefire between the remaining nations. During peace talks in the Militesi capital, Class Zero is framed for Andoria's murder, resulting in Concordia's puppet government and Milites launching a united assault on Rubrum. During their flight, Machina storms off after clashing with Class Zero, and becomes a White Tiger l'Cie to protect Rem from his brother's fate before returning to them. The White Tiger Crystal's will eventually forces him to leave.

With help from its l'Cie soldiers and Class Zero, Rubrum destroys the forces of Concordia and Milites, uniting Orience under its flag. This triggers the arrival of Tempus Finis, with the Rursus Army emerging from the magical fortress Pandaemonium to wipe out Orience's population. Cid and Class Zero each travel to Pandaemonium: Cid attempts to become Agito and is transformed into the Rursus Arbiter by Gala, while Class Zero resolve to halt Tempus Finis. As Class Zero face the trials of the Arbiter, the Vermillion Bird Crystal offers them the chance to become l'Cie. During the original playthrough, if Class Zero accepts the offer, they go into battle against the Rursus and die, dooming Orience to be destroyed in Tempus Finis and reborn in another spiral of history. 

Class Zero refuse the Crystal's offer and Rem is made a l'Cie in their place. Machina and Rem end up fighting each other in Pandaemonium: Rem is mortally wounded, and she and Machina turn to crystal. Severely weakened by the trials and demoralized at seeing Machina and Rem's condition, Class Zero are initially unable to defeat the Arbiter. Machina and Rem's spirits give them the strength they need to defeat the Arbiter and halt Tempus Finis. Fatally injured, Class Zero spend their final minutes imagining their possible post-war lives. They are found by Machina and Rem, who have returned to human form and, along with the rest of Orience, are allowed to remember the dead. In a post-credits sequence, it is said that the Crystal States fall into turmoil as the Crystals lose their powers. Machina and Rem unite Orience and rebuild the world, and Machina records Class Zero's history before dying with Rem at his side. 

A second playthrough reveals that Orience is trapped in a stable timeloop created by Arecia and Gala, the respective servants of the deities <a href="Fabula%20Nova%20Crystallis%20Final%20Fantasy%23Common%20elements">Pulse and Lindzei</a>, as part of an experiment to find the gateway to the Unseen Realm. Competing with each other to open the gateway using a different method, both failed and reset the world for another attempt. By the events of "Type-0", the experiment had been performed over six hundred million times. Cid, aware of the cycle, wanted to free Orience from the Crystals' control, and killed himself in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent Gala from using him. In a sequence unlocked during the second playthrough, Joker and Tiz speak with Arecia after the Arbiter's defeat and show her the memories of Class Zero and the people of Orience to make her reconsider restarting the experiment. After speaking with Machina and Rem, Arecia decides to abandon the experiment and returns the two to human form. In an alternate ending, Arecia chooses to remove the crystals from Orience's history, creating a new timeline where the war never occurred and the world's population can live happily.

"Final Fantasy Type-0" was originally titled "Final Fantasy Agito XIII", envisioned as a game for mobile devices. It was conceived in 2005 as part of "<a href="Fabula%20Nova%20Crystallis%20Final%20Fantasy">Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy</a>", a subseries of "Final Fantasy" games linked by a common mythos. "Agito XIII" was the final original "Fabula Nova Crystallis" game to be created. The decision to make it a mobile game was based on the popularity of "". <a href="Hajime%20Tabata">Hajime Tabata</a>, who contributed to the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" mythos, was searching for a new project after finishing "Before Crisis" and became the game's director. "Before Crisis" producer Kosei Ito acted as producer before his move to <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a> prior to 2009. Beginning development in 2006, it was first announced at that year's <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3). It was said to offer on-the-go access to the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" universe, using gameplay functions exclusive to mobile phones of the time. The concept was to deliver a game for mobile platforms equivalent to a console game from the main "Final Fantasy" series, and to make it available in its entirety upon release rather than in episodic format.

Developers had been planning a release on the next generation of mobile phones, as those available at the time could not offer all the capabilities they would need. While it was originally claimed to be a mobile exclusive, versions for both mobiles and the <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> were being developed, with the latter to be revealed when the former was sufficiently advanced. The original staff members were Tabata, <a href="Yusuke%20Naora">Yusuke Naora</a> and <a href="Tetsuya%20Nomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a>. Nomura acted as a character designer and creative producer. Between 2006 and 2008, development wavered between inactivity and sluggishness since most of the team was devoted to "". In 2008, it was said to be facing serious problems due to the scale of the project. An issue developers had grappled with was whether or not to make the command buttons used in the game visible on the mobile screen. "Agito XIII" was described as an online RPG using fully rendered 3D graphics similar to console games, as well as having gameplay elements from multiple genres such as <a href="Massively%20multiplayer%20online%20role-playing%20game">MMORPG</a>s, smaller-scale multiplayer-focused games, and standard role-playing games. Other unfinished concepts being developed were a day-night cycle, a calendar system linked to real-world time and dates, and a story influenced by player votes.

In 2008, it was decided to make "Type-0" a PSP exclusive, cancelling the mobile version of the game as the developers did not want to wait for mobile technology to reach a level which could handle their full vision for the game. Full development began that year by the same team who developed "Crisis Core", but was again slowed as most of them were completing work on "<a href="The%203rd%20Birthday">The 3rd Birthday</a>". Because of these conflicting projects, "Type-0" came close to being cancelled outright. Between 2009 and 2011, the title was changed to distance it from "Final Fantasy XIII", since after the platform change the two games had little in common other than their shared mythos. One of the titles considered and rejected was "Final Fantasy Live", referring to the game's multiplayer element. The new title, "Final Fantasy Type-0," was intended to indicate the game's separation from the main series. It was also the beginning of an alternative numbering system parallel to the main series. The game made its first official public appearance under the new title at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in Tokyo, along with a new trailer that was released to the public on January 27, 2011.

"Type-0"s scenario was conceived by Tabata and written by Hiroki Chiba and Sarah Okabe. While the game was still titled "Agito XIII", Tabata described it as "a major title [...] formed from a variety of concepts" which included the collision of four fantasies (the game's view of Orience), a battle between magic and weapons, and the two sides of reality. The early story concept drew heavily from popular <a href="manga">manga</a> and <a href="anime">anime</a>, but little survived after the platform change. Tabata instead chose a new style similar to historical films and documentaries. The new story's concept started with the idea of a war story told by young people caught up in the event, with its story themes revolving around death and its impact on others. A major inspiration was the Japanese documentary series "Centuries of Picture". The final story was darker than many other "Final Fantasy" games. Despite its title change, the game was kept within the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" mythos. The approach taken with the mythos was to portray the roles of its deities from a historical standpoint, while telling a story focused on the human side of events. The cyclic nature of the game's universe was created to help incorporate aspects of the mythos. The roles and backgrounds for each character in the game were conceived and put into place after the setting and main story had been finalized. After the game's release, Tabata commented that when he was writing the story he would have liked to have been more thorough, and to have made the story easier for players to understand.

The game's logo artwork was drawn by regular series artist <a href="Yoshitaka%20Amano">Yoshitaka Amano</a>. The kanji symbol used in the logo was drawn by Naora, who had designed the Shinra logo in "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VII">Final Fantasy VII</a>" and its <a href="Compilation%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20VII">companion media</a>. Naora specifically requested that he draw the logo due to this previous experience. To achieve the grittier atmosphere, Naora took a research trip to a Japanese military camp to learn what being a military cadet was like. The island of the Vermillion Perystilium was based on an offshore Japanese island he had visited prior to his involvement with the game, adding elements in-game such as an offshore ship wreck to symbolize his fear of the sea. He was also influenced by an incident where he saw a dead cat surrounded by other cats to portray the bond between members of Class Zero, and the game's themes, in promotional artwork.

The gameplay was inspired by the multi-character system of "Before Crisis", while the naming of magic styles after weapons of war made reference to first-person shooters. The combat was designed to be filled with tension and portray each playable character's personality on the battlefield. The Eidolons were originally not controlled in realtime, but during the development of Ifrit, Tabata did some testing with real-time commands. The results impressed him enough that he decided to overcome the technical difficulties involved and make the Eidolons controllable. Due to technical restrictions and the presence of the Academy Assist function, the game's <a href="Artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">artificial intelligence</a> for playable characters needed to be limited to healing, survival and other minor actions. The game's multiplayer was deliberately designed around restricted segments. Its development was still ongoing during the summer of 2011, with a <a href="2011%20PlayStation%20Network%20outage">temporary stoppage</a> of <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a> that year negatively affecting its development. Because of the size of the project, debugging the game took far longer than anticipated. Between the release of the demo and the full game, adjustments were made to gameplay mechanics and the in-game camera. In a post-release interview, Tabata commented that he would have liked to expand the multiplayer functions to include an ad-hoc function and expanded cooperative gameplay, and create a more forgiving learning curve for players.

The music for "Type-0" was composed by <a href="Takeharu%20Ishimoto">Takeharu Ishimoto</a>. He had previously composed the music for "Before Crisis", "Crisis Core" and "<a href="The%20World%20Ends%20with%20You">The World Ends with You</a>". Ishimoto gave the music a dark and heavy feel, describing the themes as "war, life, and death". He used less <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> elements than in his previous games to promote a feeling of immersion. One of his primary instruments was the <a href="guitar">guitar</a>, which Ishimoto played himself during recording sessions. Although the title was for the PSP, the team did not want to hold back despite hardware limitations, recording a quantity of tracks unusual for a spin-off "Final Fantasy" title. Wherever possible, the recording was done live. The orchestral and choral elements were performed by the <a href="Sydney%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Sydney Symphony Orchestra</a> and the Cantillation chamber choir, and the recording and mixing of these tracks was done at the <a href="Sydney%20Opera%20House">Sydney Opera House</a>. Recording for other tracks was done at Ishimoto's studio in Japan. After recording, Ishimoto combined the orchestral and choral elements, and rearranged the main leitmotifs to create more variety in the score. Arrangements for the orchestral tunes were done by <a href="Kentaro%20Sato%20%28composer%29">Kentaro Sato</a>, while arrangements for other tracks were done by Rieko Mikoshiba.

The game's theme song, "<a href="Zero%20%28Bump%20of%20Chicken%20song%29">Zero</a>", was composed and performed by Japanese rock band <a href="Bump%20of%20Chicken">Bump of Chicken</a>. The band, which was a big fan of the "Final Fantasy" series, was contacted by Square Enix to compose and perform the song and agreed readily. It was brought in after the platform move onto the PSP, but while the game was still titled "Agito XIII". While looking for inspiration, the band was able to see in-development screenshots of the game, samples of the script, and character illustrations. The band was mostly given a free hand while composing the song. Its one guideline was provided by Tabata, who suggested the theme song for "Centuries of Picture", "Is Paris Burning?" by Takeshi Kako, as a source of inspiration. Multiple versions of "Zero" were composed for use in different areas of the game. At the request of band leader Motoo Fujiwara, Amano's logo artwork was used for the cover of the single's limited edition.

"Final Fantasy Type-0 Original Soundtrack" was released on October 26, 2011. The soundtrack was released in a standard edition, as well as a limited edition that could be purchased both separately and with the collector's edition of the game. A promotional album featuring five tracks was sold by Square Enix at their booth at the <a href="Odaiba">Odaiba Expo 2011</a>. The album stayed on the <a href="Oricon">Oricon</a> charts for seven weeks, reaching a high of #25. The soundtrack has received positive reviews in the west from dedicated music outlets "Original Sound Version" and "Game-OST", with the sites giving both individual tracks and the work in general high praise. "Zero" was released on October 19, 2011. It was released as a single instead of being part of the main soundtrack, receiving both a limited and standard edition. The single remained in the Oricon charts for thirty-two weeks, peaking at #2.

"Type-0" was released on October 27, 2011, receiving both physical and digital releases. It was initially announced for release in summer of that year, but unspecified difficulties with development including the stoppage of PlayStation Network caused a delay. It was then announced for released on October 13, but was delayed by two weeks. While Square Enix stated it wanted to improve its quality, no other information was given. It was speculated to be due to complaints surrounding the camera control and other gameplay elements. The releases of the soundtrack and the theme song were also delayed. "Type-0" was one of a few releases for the PSP to be released on two UMDs, as Tabata wanted to cut as little content as possible, which would have been impossible if they had settled for using one UMD. A demo for the original game was released in August 2011, featuring seven playable characters and four missions at locked difficulty levels. Save data could be transferred to the full game, unlocking special costumes and items and keeping experience points. A second demo was released on November 22, a month after the full game's release. It replaced the original demo and gave players access to exclusive items and costumes. A collector's edition was released exclusively through Square Enix's online store, containing artwork, a limited edition version of the soundtrack, postcards and a booklet of character introductions. The title was later added to their Ultimate Hits budget title collection.

"Type-0" has never received an official localization in its original form. During development, while it was still titled "Agito XIII", Tabata said he was trying to make the game appealing to North American players. Despite a localization being confirmed as in development in an official guidebook interview, the original version of "Type-0" was not released in the west. In the wake of the game's release in Japan, <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> and <a href="Joystiq">Joystiq</a> speculated that the game could be successfully brought west as a port to the <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a>. Tabata later commented that the main reasons for the game not being localized were the flagging Western PSP market and uncertainties surrounding the Vita's commercial success.

An unofficial <a href="Fan%20translation%20of%20video%20games">fan translation</a> <a href="Patch%20%28computing%29">patch</a> was announced in mid-2012. Work on the fan translation took place over the following two years, during which time Square Enix was noncommittal concerning an official Western release. The patch was initially announced for an August 2014 release, but was instead was released on June 9, 2014. According to the translation team leader, the patch was downloaded 100,000 times in the first four days. It was taken down in July of the same year after Square Enix allegedly threatened unspecified legal action, originally thought to be a <a href="cease%20and%20desist">cease-and-desist</a> order. Later statements revealed that the patch was released earlier than originally announced due to the lead translator on the project wanting fans to see their achievements, which ended up causing a rift between him and the rest of the team. Before the release, Square Enix and the translation team had been in friendly communication concerning the translation. The formal requests to take the patch down were made in the weeks following its release, shortly before the announcement of "Type-0 HD". Work on the patch was eventually resumed and a second version, which included unofficial compatibility with the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> system and further translation bugfixes, was eventually released in 2015.

Multiple pieces of merchandise were created for the game. An "<a href="List%20of%20Square%20Enix%20companion%20books">Ultimania</a>", part of a series of dedicated guidebooks, was released in the same month as the original game. It contained story and character breakdowns, concept art, and interviews with developers. A different book, was also released in October. It featured character biographies, details on the world of Orience, and interviews with the voice actors for Class Zero. The following year, a dedicated art book was released containing artwork of the game's characters and monsters, and an interview with Tabata. Characters from the game, including Ace, Machina and other members of Class Zero, appeared in the fourth series of releases for the "Final Fantasy Trading Card Game". In November 2011, a manga adaptation of "Type-0", illustrated by Takatoshi Shiozawa, began serialization in "<a href="Gangan%20Comics">Young Gangan</a>" magazine. The manga has been collected into a <a href="tank%C5%8Dbon">tankōbon</a> volume and was released on April 21, 2012. Another manga titled also illustrated by Shiozawa, began publication in "Young Gangan" in April 2012. It ended in January 2014, with a bonus chapter being published in February of that year, and was later released in five compiled volumes. <a href="Yen%20Press">Yen Press</a> began distribution of the manga in the west in July 2015. Square Enix released two novel adaptations, in April and June 2012, depicting an alternate version of "Type-0"s story: and The novels were written by Sōki Tsukishima.

In the first week on sale, "Final Fantasy Type-0" sold 472,253 units, topping Japanese sales charts and selling through 79.08% of its initial shipments. As of January 16, 2012, the game had sold 746,203 copies in Japan. It was the best-selling game of 2011 for Japanese media retail shop <a href="Culture%20Convenience%20Club">Tsutaya</a>, beating "<a href="Monster%20Hunter%20Portable%203rd">Monster Hunter Portable 3rd</a>" (PlayStation Portable) and "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XIII-2">Final Fantasy XIII-2</a>" (PlayStation 3). It was also the store's best-selling PSP title of the year, followed by "Monster Hunter Portable 3rd" and "<a href="Dissidia%20012%20Final%20Fantasy">Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy</a>".

"<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" and "<a href="Dengeki%20PlayStation">Dengeki PlayStation</a>" both praised the story, with "Famitsu" saying it "vividly portrays the fact that this is a deep, intense "Final Fantasy" experience, something beyond just a side story". Gaming website PlayStation LifeStyle's Heath Hindman was impressed by the darker presentation, calling it "powerful and well done throughout", and was impressed with the characters despite some awkward introductory scenes. Erren Van Duine, writing for RPG Site, said that fans would appreciate the scale of the narrative, and praised the handling of the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" mythos. She did note that some plot points seemed only included for the sake of convenience, and that the ending forced a second playthrough to see the whole story.

"Famitsu" called the original version's gameplay a "stressless experience", praising the game's size and saying the action-oriented battle system made it "a very different "Final Fantasy"". "Dengeki PlayStation" similarly praised its size and the tense combat, though the review found aspects of the navigation less appealing. Hindman was generally positive about most aspects of gameplay and the high replay value, but found faults with the scripted opening of the overworld and the real-time strategy segments. Van Duine said the gameplay encouraged immersion and was harsh on novices; she praised several aspects of gameplay, but described the leveling system as "tricky". The multiplayer functions were universally praised in Japan. Opinions were divided on the original camera, with "Famitsu" praising its movement, while Van Duine and "Dengeki PlayStation" found issues with it getting stuck in the environment or impeding visibility. The character AI also received criticism for being unresponsive or wayward.

"Type-0" affected several other works in multiple ways. During its development, several staff members and voice actors who had worked on "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X">Final Fantasy X</a>" reunited. Their meeting triggered the development of "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X/X-2%20HD%20Remaster">Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster</a>". In the September 2013 issue of "Famitsu Weekly", Square Enix revealed "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20Agito">Final Fantasy Agito</a>", an online companion game to "Type-0" for <a href="iOS">iOS</a> and <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> mobile devices. The game was released in May 2014, and a localization was announced alongside that of "Type-0". Its servers were closed down in November 2015, with its localization being cancelled as a result. A new online game set in the "Type-0" universe, "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20Awakening">Final Fantasy Awakening</a>", released in Asian and English-speaking territories between 2016 and 2018.

While working on "Final Fantasy XV", Tabata decided to make a high-definition remaster of "Type-0" for eighth-generation consoles. Developed by Square Enix and <a href="HexaDrive">HexaDrive</a>, "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20Type-0%20HD">Final Fantasy Type-0 HD</a>" was originally announced at E3 2014, and released worldwide in March 2015. After "Type-0"s release, Tabata stated in an interview that he wished to explore the distant history of Orience after the events of the game. Trademarks for "Type-1", "Type-2" and "Type-3" were registered shortly after the "Type-0" trademark, but it was suggested that they were simply a protective measure. During interviews given in 2014, Tabata commented that he wished to work on "Type-1" after completing "XV", and later explained the conceptual "Type" series as a means of publishing "Final Fantasy" games too experimental for the main series. He hoped to continue with the "Type" series if "Type-0 HD" was commercially successful.

Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy

Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy is a series of games within the "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>" video game franchise. It was primarily developed by series creator and developer <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a>, which also acted as publisher for all titles. While featuring various worlds and different characters, each "Fabula Nova Crystallis" game is ultimately based on and expands upon a common mythos focusing on important crystals tied to deities. The level of connection to the mythos varies between each title. The series title translates from Latin as 'The New Tale of the Crystal'. Each development team was given the freedom to adapt the mythos to fit the context of a game's story.

The series, originally announced in 2006 as "Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIII", currently consists of seven games across multiple platforms. "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a>", designed as the series' flagship title, was released in 2009. The creative forces behind the series include many developers from previous "Final Fantasy" titles, including <a href="Shinji%20Hashimoto">Shinji Hashimoto</a> and <a href="Motomu%20Toriyama">Motomu Toriyama</a>. The mythos was conceived and written by <a href="Kazushige%20Nojima">Kazushige Nojima</a>. The first games announced for the series were "Final Fantasy XIII", "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XV">Final Fantasy XV</a>" (as "Versus XIII"), and "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20Type-0">Final Fantasy Type-0</a>" (as "Agito XIII"). All three games went through delays. After "Final Fantasy XIII" and "Type-0"s releases, their respective teams used ideas and concepts from development to create additional games. For later games, other studios have been brought in to help with aspects of development. "Final Fantasy XV" was distanced from the series brand for marketing purposes despite retaining thematic connections.

Seven titles have been released as of 2016. The series is complemented by works in related media, including companion books, novelizations, and <a href="manga">manga</a>. "Final Fantasy XV" notably expanded into a multimedia project, spawning a and an . Individual games have generally received a positive reception, although opinions have been more mixed over various aspects of the three "Final Fantasy XIII" games. Reception of the mythos' use in the released games has also been mixed: while some critics called it confusing or too similar to the lore of the main series, others were impressed by its scope and use. Retrospective opinions on the series have also been mixed.

"Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy" currently consists of seven titles across multiple platforms, including sequels and spin-offs of the original entries. The entries in the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" series share the same mythology, interpreted differently and referred to in varying degrees for each of the game worlds.


"Final Fantasy XIII" and its sequels have a strong connection to the mythos, making extensive use of its terminology and involving many of its deities. The universe of "Final Fantasy Type-0" used the terminology and made minor reference to the mythos while focusing on the human side of events, although these references were added during later story development. While the mythos is still present in "Final Fantasy XV", it was "disconnected" from the core framework, with specific terminology being removed and its emphasis reduced to become a background element for the world and story.

The universes of "Final Fantasy XIII", "Type-0" and "Final Fantasy XV" are unrelated to each other, though common elements and themes are present. The first is a common narrative theme of harmful interference by the mythos' deities in the affairs of humans, and those humans' choice of whether to accept or challenge the predetermined fates given to them. <a href="Tetsuya%20Nomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a> defined this theme as "a battle of the gods that lies behind each tale and gives it inspiration in a different way". <a href="Hajime%20Tabata">Hajime Tabata</a> later defined the theme as a tale of humans placing their lives at risk after being chosen by the crystal. The second common element is the structure of the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" universe, which is divided in two: the mortal world, where humans live, and the afterlife or . A recurring theme is subverting the series' traditional view of crystals, making them objects that brought both prosperity and tragedy by their influence.

In the mythology, the god seizes control of the mortal world by killing his mother, the creator goddess , who vanishes into the Unseen Realm. Believing that the mortality of the world is Mwynn's curse, Bhunivelze creates three new deities to search for the gate to the Unseen Realm so he can control both worlds. The first deity, , is tasked with <a href="terraforming">terraforming</a> the world; the second deity, , is discarded because of her resemblance to Mwynn; the third deity, , acts as his protector. Bhunivelze then enters a deep sleep, while Lindzei and Pulse carry out their missions. Distraught at being abandoned, Etro kills herself, and humans are born from her blood. Once in the Unseen Realm, Etro finds Mwynn being consumed by a force called chaos, which threatens to destroy reality. As Mwynn fades, she tasks Etro with protecting the balance between the worlds. Etro gives humans pieces of chaos that become their "hearts". Because humans held chaos within them, they maintained the balance through their death and reincarnation. Since then, humans have either worshiped or feared Pulse and Lindzei, and refer to Etro as the goddess of death. The mythos' deities hold similar roles in each game's setting, but are not the same characters in a narrative sense.

A recurring race in the games are god-like beings created by Pulse and Lindzei to act as their servants in the mortal world. In the original mythos and the "XIII" games, the demigods are called fal'Cie . They take the form of crystal-powered mechanical beings in the "XIII" games. In the universe of "Type-0", they are both semi-sentient crystals and humanoid beings living among the people. The fal'Cie have the ability to imbue chosen humans with magical powers and assign them a task to complete either willingly or unwillingly. "Final Fantasy XIII" and "Type-0" refer to these people as l'Cie and the task given to them as a Focus. In the worlds of "XIII" and "Type-0", there are two possible outcomes for l'Cie: once their Focus is fulfilled, they can go into 'crystal stasis', transforming into a crystal statue, and gain eternal life, but if they fail they become mindless crystalline monsters. In "Type-0", l'Cie are chosen by the crystal of their country, and given great power to fulfill their assigned Focus, but lose their memories if emotionally unstable. While not referred to as such using the original terminology, humans imbued with magic and burdened with a task exist in "Final Fantasy XV", one of them being the main protagonist <a href="Noctis%20Lucis%20Caelum">Noctis</a>.

A common element not related to the mythos, themes or plots of the series is the use of <a href="Latin">Latin</a> in the games' titles or worlds, often as key words to describing themes and story points: the series' title translates as 'The New Tale of the Crystal', 'Agito' roughly translates as "to put into motion", while 'Versus' translates as both "to turn around" and "against", which were described as representing key narrative concepts. 'Agito' was kept within the "Final Fantasy Type-0" universe with both an in-universe concept and the title of its prequel. 'Versus' was used in early trailers for "Final Fantasy XV" after its re-reveal in 2013, carrying the tagline 'A World of the Versus Epic'. Commenting on the high use of Latin in "Final Fantasy XV" prior to its public name change, Nomura stated that he wanted a language that was no longer used on a daily basis and that people "won't be able to understand and yet appreciate", desiring a sense of general equality.

The concept for the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" series originated during late development on "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X-2">Final Fantasy X-2</a>" and the original "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20%28video%20game%29">Kingdom Hearts</a>". Discussing what to do once "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XII">Final Fantasy XII</a>" was completed, Nomura, <a href="Shinji%20Hashimoto">Shinji Hashimoto</a> and <a href="Yoshinori%20Kitase">Yoshinori Kitase</a> decided to build upon the idea of multiple games connected by a single "central theme". Scenario writer <a href="Kazushige%20Nojima">Kazushige Nojima</a> started writing the original mythology for the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" series in 2003, finishing it by February 2004. Nojima described his creation as the result of a wish to create something entirely new; a universe with its own mythos and legends. When he introduced the concept to other team members, they liked it and helped it grow. As with some of his other projects, Nojima incorporated themes of mythology due to his liking for and extensive research of <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek</a> and <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>. During his work, he received creative input from Kitase and Hashimoto, as well as Nomura, Tabata and <a href="Motomu%20Toriyama">Motomu Toriyama</a>. Nojima wrote a <a href="Bible%20%28writing%29">series bible</a> about the mythology, explaining concepts such as the fal'Cie and l'Cie and the feelings of the deities who created them. This bible became the basis for a video animated by <a href="Yusuke%20Naora">Yusuke Naora</a>'s art team to showcase the mythos in 2011. None of the deities were depicted in human form in the video, as this would have undermined the developers' wishes for open interpretation by developers and players.

The central concept for "Fabula Nova Crystallis" came from the "<a href="Compilation%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20VII">Compilation of Final Fantasy VII</a>", a multimedia subseries featuring the world and characters of "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VII">Final Fantasy VII</a>". Whereas the common link in the "Compilation" was "Final Fantasy VII", the team chose to use "the tale of new crystals" for the new series, with the mythos connecting the games rather than an overarching narrative. Another key idea behind the mythos was to ease the production of future "Final Fantasy" games by providing an established universe. The individual directors are allowed to freely interpret the base mythology when they create their games. When referring to this freedom, Tabata has compared the mythos and the concept behind it to Greek mythology; a mythos with common themes and deities, but featuring many unrelated stories.

Toriyama based the story of "Final Fantasy XIII" around the mythos' deities and their direct relations to the world. Tabata and Nomura both focused on the human side of the story. Tabata chose to portray the divine elements from a historical standpoint in "Type-0". Nomura created a modern-day setting similar to contemporary Earth in "Final Fantasy XV", referring far less to the mythos' terminology. Nomura was also appointed as the main character designer for all entries in the subseries. In a 2007 interview, Hashimoto compared the planning of the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" series to film franchises such as "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" and "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20%28film%20series%29">The Lord of the Rings</a>": an expansive brand on which to build multiple "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>" titles planned in advance. The development of all games connected to the mythos was handled by <a href="Square%20Enix%23Development%20organization">Square Enix 1st Production Department</a>. A trademark for "Final Fantasy Haeresis XIII" hinted at another entry, but the trademark expired in 2011 and the company did not renew.

"Final Fantasy XIII" began development in February 2004. It began as a title for the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> under the codename "Colors World", however it was moved onto PlayStation 3 after the positively received <a href="Crystal%20Tools">Crystal Tools engine</a> demo in 2005 and the delayed release of "Final Fantasy XII". The original titles in the series were "Final Fantasy XIII" and "Versus XIII". "Agito XIII" was conceived later, when Tabata was looking for a new project after finishing "". Originally titled "Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIII", the three titles were announced at E3 2006 "Final Fantasy XIII" and "Versus XIII" were intended to form the core of the series, with future games being a "facet" of "Final Fantasy XIII". "Agito XIII" and "Versus XIII" both began production in 2006. The subseries' title changed in 2011 when the "XIII" numeral was dropped as it "would have been an issue".

"XIII" was developed by team members who had worked on "Final Fantasy VII", "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VIII">VIII</a>", "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X">X</a>" and "X-2". It was first announced as a PS3 exclusive. Late in its development, "Final Fantasy XIII" changed from being a console exclusive when an Xbox 360 version was announced, significantly delaying its release. After the release of "Final Fantasy XIII", the creators wanted to expand on the game's setting and tell more stories about the characters, so "XIII-2" and "Lightning Returns" were developed. For these games, Japanese developer <a href="tri-Ace">tri-Ace</a> was brought in to help with the games' design and graphics. The three games and their respective tie-in media were referred to as the "Lightning Saga" by Square Enix staff after the games' central character. A port for Microsoft Windows was considered, but not followed up due to platform-specific concerns and the company's view of the video game market. Later, "Final Fantasy XIII" and its sequels would receive PC ports through <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a>. While there was speculation that "Fabula Nova Crystallis" would end with "Lightning Returns", Kitase repeatedly stated that there was still room for further titles beyond the "XIII" universe.

"Agito XIII" was handled by staff from "Before Crisis". The game was originally being developed as an episodic mobile game. By 2008, "Agito XIII" had been moved onto the PlayStation Portable, then later renamed "Final Fantasy Type-0". The stated reason for the change of title was that "Final Fantasy XIII" and "Type-0" shared little besides the core mythos. "Type-0"s western release was delayed due to the flagging PSP market in western territories. A high-definition port to the same platforms as "Final Fantasy XV" was co-developed by Square Enix and <a href="HexaDrive">HexaDrive</a>, and was eventually announced for a western release. Tabata created "Agito" around his original ideas for "Type-0" as a mobile title. "Agito" acted as both a prequel to "Type-0" and an alternate story set within its world. The game was co-developed by mobile game developer Tayutau K. K. Later, Chinese developer <a href="Perfect%20World%20%28company%29">Perfect World</a> were brought in to develop "Awakening".

"Versus XIII"s development was headed by the team behind the console "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>" games. Like "XIII", the game was a PS3 exclusive. As early as 2007, Square Enix considered re-branding "Versus XIII" as a numbered entry in the main series due to the rapidly growing scale of the project. The game was eventually re-branded in 2011 as "Final Fantasy XV". As part of its later marketing, "Final Fantasy XV" was deliberately distanced from the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" brand to remove the consequent limitation on their target audience, although lore and design elements were retained. The game was also moved fully onto eighth generation consoles and developed using the company's new <a href="Luminous%20Studio">Luminous Studio engine</a>. The PS3 version was abandoned due to concerns about the console's continued viability. "Final Fantasy XV" eventually had help from multiple developers, including HexaDrive, <a href="XPEC%20Entertainment">XPEC Entertainment</a> and <a href="Umbra%20%283D%20technology%20company%29">Umbra</a>. In contrast to "Final Fantasy XIII", Tabata decided against creating any sequels to "Final Fantasy XV", instead expanding the base game through DLC. The first season of DLC was well received, so a second season was commissioned. All but one of these later DLC episodes was cancelled in 2018 following the decision by the team to focus on a new intellectual property.

The games have been complemented and expanded upon through other media. For "Final Fantasy XIII", a small book of <a href="short%20stories">short stories</a> titled "Final Fantasy XIII - Episode Zero" was released, first through the game's website and then as a print release in December 2009. It shows events prior to the game's opening. A second novella, "Episode i", was published via "XIII-2"s official website, bridging the narrative gap between "XIII" and "XIII-2". Alongside "XIII-2"s Japanese release, a book detailing events not shown or described in the game titled "Fragments Before" was released in December 2011 including "Episode i"; this would be followed up by "Fragments After", released in June 2012. Only "Episode i" has received an official English release. "Lightning Returns" was also set to receive a prequel novel by Benny Matsuyama alongside the game's Japanese release in November 2013, however this was later cancelled due to the author falling ill. A three-part novella exclusive to "Famitsu Weekly" magazine titled "Final Fantasy XIII Reminiscence: tracer of memories" was released across June and July 2014. It was written by <a href="Daisuke%20Watanabe">Daisuke Watanabe</a>, who handled the scripts for the "XIII" games, and takes place immediately after the ending of "Lightning Returns". "Reminiscence" was later released online.

"Final Fantasy Type-0" received a <a href="manga">manga</a> adaptation illustrated by Takatoshi Shiozawa. It began publication in the November 2011 of "<a href="Gangan%20Comics">Young Gangan</a>" and was collected into a single volume and released in April 2012. The manga was translated into English and released as part of the western collector's edition for "Type-0 HD", available exclusively through Square Enix's online store. A second manga following one of the game's secondary characters, "Final Fantasy Type-0 Side Story: Reaper of the Icy Blade", began serialization in May 2012. The latter manga was created by Shiozawa under Nomura's supervision. The manga ended in January 2014, with a bonus chapter released in February of the same year. It will be released in the west in July 2015, licensed by <a href="Yen%20Press">Yen Press</a>. Two novels detailing an alternate version of "Type-0", titled "Final Fantasy Type-0: Change the World", were released in April and June 2012. "Agito" received another "Change the World" novel adaptation focusing on two of the game's supporting characters. <a href="List%20of%20Square%20Enix%20companion%20books">Ultimania</a> guides and companion books have been released for the majority of released games.

"Final Fantasy XV" similarly had additional media released around it, forming a dedicated multimedia expansion dubbed the ""Final Fantasy XV" Universe". The majority of its content fleshed out the background for "Final Fantasy XV"s plot, which would have required multiple video games under normal circumstances. While comparing the "Final Fantasy XV" Universe to the overall structure of "Fabula Nova Crystallis", the game's director defined it as an attempt to make the narrative of "XV" work in current times rather than attempting to "reinvent" the original concept. An anime produced by Square Enix and <a href="A-1%20Pictures">A-1 Pictures</a>, "", details the backstories of the main cast and how they came to be journeying together. It is being distributed online through the months leading up to the game's release. A CGI feature film produced by the same team as "Advent Children", "", was released in July 2016 in Japan and in August in America; it focuses on the main character's father Regis Lucis Caelum, alongside original characters. The cancelled DLC was turned into the novel "Final Fantasy XV: The Dawn of the Future".

The "Fabula Nova Crystallis" mythos has received mixed reactions from gaming sites. "<a href="Hardcore%20Gamer">Hardcore Gamer</a>"s Brady Hale called the series "anything but ordinary" in the variety of games it featured. In an article concerning the 25th Anniversary event for the "Final Fantasy" series, <a href="Joystiq">Joystiq</a>'s Ben Gilbert called the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" mythos "occasionally bizarre and often beautiful". In 2014, Jeremy Parish of <a href="Eurogamer">USGamer</a> said that the series was "much ado about nothing", stating that since the games shared a large amount of themes and plot points with the main series, there seemed little reason for a distinction. TechnoBuffalo's Ron Duwell, in an article concerning a documentary video on "Final Fantasy XV", called the series "overly ambitious", but felt that it was worth "Fabula Nova Crystallis" "[imploding] upon itself" if "Final Fantasy XV" fulfilled its promises. Kat Bailey, writing for USGamer as part of her review for "Final Fantasy XV", said that series fans were ready for the subseries to come to an end with the game's release. RPG Site's Chelsi Laire called the subseries "a series of successes and failures, but mostly the latter" due to its troubled development, but hoped that the company would revisit the brand in the future.

Speaking about the "XIII" games in particular, Parish suggested that their mixed reactions influenced the title changes of other games in the original series, giving the teams a chance to give those games more of their own identity. He also felt that the decision to expand the "XIII" storyline into multiple games "probably worked out just as well". The presentation of the mythos and its terms received mixed reactions in "XIII", resulting in the production team toning down their use for "XIII-2". Siliconera writer Spencer Yip, in his review of "Lightning Returns", commented that the story and pace of the game was "muddled" by the mythos. In 2016, RPGFan writer Mike Salbato wrote a retrospective of the "Final Fantasy XIII" games and their version of "Fabula Nova Crystallis": he felt that the lack of specific references to the mythos in "XIII" had harmed general comprehension, and that a reliance on foreknowledge made its sequels difficult to play as standalone titles. In contrast, the portrayal of the mythos in "Type-0" was praised by RPG Site's Erren Van Duine in an import review of the title, with him saying that "elements such as l'Cie and fal'Cie are handled in much more interesting ways". When commenting on the lore of "Final Fantasy XV", Andrew Reiner of "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" praised the story for sticking to basics and avoiding "[overwhelming] the player with lore or branching threads, something "Final Fantasy XIII" struggled with".

"Final Fantasy XIII" was positively received in Japanese magazines, garnering exceptionally high scores from both "Famitsu" and "Dengeki PlayStation". In the west, the game was praised for its graphics, battle system, and music, but opinions were mixed about its story and it was criticized for its highly linear structure. "XIII" also won an award for best graphics in "<a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a>"s 2012 Platinum Trophy Awards. "XIII-2" received a positive reception overall, gaining perfect scores from "Famitsu" and "Dengeki PlayStation", and high scores from most western sites. Common points of praise were its non-linear nature, improved battle system and graphics, while the main points of criticism were its story and characters, which were often called weak, confusing or both. "Lightning Returns" received mixed to positive reviews, with its combat being highly praised, its graphics and time limit mechanic drawing mixed responses, and the story and characters being cited as poorly developed.

"Type-0" had a highly positive reception in Japan, with it garnering near-perfect scores in "Famitsu" and "Dengeki PlayStation". Import reviews were also fairly positive, sharing many points of praise with the Japanese reviews. "Type-0 HD" also received a positive reception in the west, with main praise going to the story, characters and action-based gameplay. Other aspects came in for criticism, such as elements of the graphics upgrade, the real-time strategy segments, and the localization. Western previews of "Agito" have also been positive, with critics agreeing that it looked good on the platform and worked well from a gameplay standpoint. "Final Fantasy XV" was positively received by many journalists; praise went to aspects of the story, the main characters, battle system and graphics, while the overarching plot, supporting cast and other technical elements such as the camera and late-game changes in gameplay were criticized.

"Final Fantasy XIII" broke sales records for the "Final Fantasy" franchise, selling 1.5 million units in Japan on its release day, and a further million a month after its North American release. "XIII-2" was the most purchased title of 2011 in Japan upon release, and reached second and first place in sales charts in the United States and United Kingdom respectively. "Lightning Returns" had lower first-week sales than its predecessors, but still topped the sales charts in Japan, selling over 277,000 units in its first week and over 404,000 copies by the end of 2013. It ranked as third and eighth in the UK and US February sales charts respectively. Approximately 800,000 copies were sold by as of November 2014. The three "XIII" games have collectively sold 11 million units worldwide. Speaking of the decreasing success of the "XIII" games and their effect on the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" series on USGamer, Parish felt that the initial backlash received by "XIII" had turned the ""XIII"" moniker into "box office poison".

"Type-0" sold over 472,000 units in its first week, and went on to sell over 740,000 units in Japan. The title was also added to the company's list of Ultimate Hits, re-releases of lucrative titles. "Type-0 HD" reached the top of the sales charts in its debut week, selling 93,000 units, though it ultimately performed poorly in Japan. It was among the ten top-selling games in March for the UK and US. By April, "Type-0 HD" had shipped over one million copies worldwide. "Agito" was highly successful in Japan, achieving 500,000 registered users within a week of release. By November of the year of release, the game had received one million downloads. "Awakening" met with commercial success in China, achieving two million downloads within its month of release. Upon its release, "Final Fantasy XV" sold five million copies worldwide through retail shipments and digital sales, breaking sales records for the "Final Fantasy" franchise.

Certain levels use the <a href="Motion%20controller">motion-based</a> Wii Remote functions.

<a href="Nintendo%20EAD%20Tokyo">Nintendo EAD Tokyo</a> began developing "Super Mario Galaxy" after the release of "<a href="Donkey%20Kong%20Jungle%20Beat">Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</a>" in late 2004, when <a href="Shigeru%20Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> suggested that Nintendo should commission a large-scale "Mario" game. The concept for the use of spherical platforms originated from ideas used in "<a href="Super%20Mario%20128">Super Mario 128</a>", a <a href="technology%20demonstration">technology demonstration</a> shown at <a href="Nintendo%20Space%20World">Nintendo Space World</a> in 2000. Nintendo aimed to make the game appeal to players of all ages, and the team had more freedom in designing it compared to other "Super Mario" games because of the <a href="outer%20space">outer space</a> setting. The soundtrack was composed by <a href="Mahito%20Yokota">Mahito Yokota</a> and <a href="Koji%20Kondo">Koji Kondo</a>, using a <a href="symphony%20orchestra">symphony orchestra</a> for the first time in the series.

A sequel, "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Galaxy%202">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>", was released for the Wii in 2010.

"Super Mario Galaxy" is set in <a href="outer%20space">outer space</a>, where <a href="Mario">Mario</a> travels through different galaxies to collect Power Stars, earned by completing missions, defeating a <a href="boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss</a>, or reaching a particular area. Each galaxy contains <a href="minor%20planet">planetoid</a>s and orbiting structures for the player to explore. Each <a href="astronomical%20object">astronomical object</a> has its own <a href="gravity">gravitational force</a>, allowing the player to completely circumnavigate the planetoids, walking sideways or upside down. The player can usually jump from one independent object and fall towards another one nearby. Although the main gameplay is in <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a>, there are several areas in the game in which the player's movements are restricted to a <a href="Side-scrolling%20video%20game">2-dimensional plane</a>.

The game's main <a href="Overworld%23Platform%20games">hub</a> is the Comet Observatory, a <a href="spaceship">spaceship</a> which contains six domes that provide access to most of the game's 42 available galaxies, with each dome except one holding five. Five domes end with a <a href="Boss%20%28gaming%29">boss level</a> in which the objective is to defeat <a href="Bowser%20%28character%29">Bowser</a> or <a href="Bowser%20Jr.">Bowser Jr.</a> and earn a special Power Star, known as a Grand Star, that gives the player access to the next dome. The player only has access to one galaxy when they begin the game; as more Power Stars are collected, more galaxies and Stars become available. The player is awarded the ability to play as <a href="Luigi">Luigi</a> after collecting 120 Power Stars as Mario. Once 120 Power Stars are collected with both characters, the player is rewarded one further challenge which, upon completion, awards the player with two commemorative pictures that can be sent to the <a href="Wii%20Message%20Board">Wii Message Board</a>.

The player-character is controlled via the <a href="Wii%20Remote">Wii Remote</a> and <a href="Wii%20Nunchuk">Nunchuk</a>.

It is a cursor that appears when the Wii Remote pointer is pointed at the screen. The Star Pointer is used to pick up special <a href="konpeito">konpeito</a>-shaped objects called "Star Bits", which can then be shot to stun enemies, manipulate obstacles, or feed Hungry Lumas (star-shaped sentient beings). The pointer can also latch onto small blue objects called "Pull Stars", which can pull Mario through space. In certain levels that encase the player in a floating bubble, the Star Pointer is used to blow wind and maneuver the bubble.

Early in the game, the player learns a new ability known as the "Spin" technique, which has appeared in varying forms throughout the "<a href="Super%20Mario">Super Mario</a>" franchise. In "Super Mario Galaxy", the “spin” is primarily used for <a href="Melee%20%28gaming%29">melee</a> attacks to stun enemies and shatter objects, as well as triggering special propellers called "Sling Stars" or "Launch Stars" that launch Mario across large distances through space. The "spin" utility is also used for climbing vines, <a href="ice%20skating">ice skating</a>, unscrewing bolts, and for activating several <a href="power-up">power-up</a>s. Other Wii Remote functions are available for smaller quests, such as <a href="surfing">surfing</a> aboard a <a href="manta%20ray">manta ray</a> or balancing atop a large ball and rolling it through an <a href="obstacle%20course">obstacle course</a>.

Nine <a href="power-up">power-up</a>s grant Mario temporary abilities. For example, special <a href="Super%20Mario%23Mushrooms">mushrooms</a> bestow the player with a <a href="Bee">Bee</a>, <a href="Boo%20%28character%29">Boo</a>, or Spring Suit. The Bee Suit allows Mario to hover through the air, climb special walls, and walk on clouds and flowers; the Boo Suit allows him to float through the air, become transparent, and move through certain obstacles; and the Spring Suit allows him to jump to high areas that would be otherwise inaccessible. The <a href="Super%20Mario%23Projectile%20flowers">Fire Flower</a> allows Mario to throw fireballs at enemies, and the Ice Flower allows Mario to create <a href="hexagon">hexagon</a>al ice tiles to cover any liquid surface he walks on. The Rainbow Star grants Mario <a href="Invincibility%20%28video%20gaming%29">invincibility</a> and lets him run faster.

Mario's health consists of a three-piece <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">health meter</a>, which is depleted through contact with enemies and hazards. When swimming underwater, Mario has an air supply meter, which quickly depletes his main health meter if it runs out. Mario's health and air supply can be restored by collecting coins, or through touching bubbles if underwater. When the health meter becomes empty, the player loses a life and must go back to a predetermined <a href="checkpoint%20%28video%20gaming%29">checkpoint</a>. The health meter can temporarily expand to six units through the use of a Life Mushroom. Instant death can occur by being swallowed by <a href="quicksand">quicksand</a> or <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a>, by being crushed by hazards, or by falling into <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s or other bottomless pits. The player can obtain <a href="1-up%23Extra%20life">extra lives</a> by collecting <a href="1-Up">1-Up</a> Mushrooms, 50 coins without losing a life, or 50 Star Bits.

"Super Mario Galaxy" has a <a href="Cooperative%20gameplay">co-operative</a> <a href="two-player">two-player</a> option called "Co-Star" mode, in which one player controls Mario while the other uses only the Wii Remote to control a second Star Pointer on-screen to gather Star Bits and shoot them at enemies. The second player can also make Mario jump, or the height of Mario's jump can be increased if the first and second player press the A button at the same time. The second player can prevent some enemies from moving by aiming the pointer star at them and holding the A button.

Shortly after <a href="Princess%20Peach">Princess Peach</a> invites <a href="Mario">Mario</a> to the centennial Star Festival, <a href="Bowser%20%28character%29">Bowser</a> invades the <a href="Mushroom%20Kingdom">Mushroom Kingdom</a> in a fleet of airships. He removes Peach's castle from its foundations using a giant <a href="flying%20saucer">flying saucer</a> and lifts it into <a href="outer%20space">outer space</a>. <a href="Kamek">Kamek</a>, one of Bowser's minions, launches Mario into space and onto a small planet with his magic. On the planet, he meets the enchantress <a href="Rosalina%20%28Mario%29">Rosalina</a> and her star-shaped companions, the Lumas. Rosalina is a watcher of the stars who uses the Comet Observatory to travel across the universe. However, Bowser has stolen all of the Power Stars that act as the Observatory's power source, rendering it immobile. Bestowed with the power to travel through space through one of the Lumas, Mario sets off on a journey across the universe to reclaim the Power Stars and restore power to Rosalina's observatory. Along the way, he finds friends from the Mushroom Kingdom such as <a href="Luigi">Luigi</a> and the <a href="Toad%20%28Nintendo%29">Toads</a>.

Upon collecting enough Power Stars, the Comet Observatory flies to the center of the universe, where Bowser is holding Peach captive. While confronting Bowser, Mario learns that he plans to rule the entire universe with Peach at his side. Mario defeats Bowser and frees Peach from Bowser's control, but one of the galaxy's planets collapses on itself, becoming a <a href="supermassive%20black%20hole">supermassive black hole</a> that begins consuming the universe. The Lumas sacrifice themselves and jump into the black hole to destroy it. The black hole collapses into a <a href="Gravitational%20singularity">singularity</a> and explodes in a <a href="supernova">supernova</a>. Rosalina appears to Mario, revealing that dying stars are later reborn as new stars. Mario awakens in the restored Mushroom Kingdom, celebrating the new galaxy that has emerged in the skies.

The concept for "Super Mario Galaxy"s gameplay originated from ideas taken from "<a href="Super%20Mario%20128">Super Mario 128</a>", a <a href="technology%20demonstration">technology demonstration</a> shown at <a href="Nintendo%20Space%20World">Nintendo Space World</a> in 2000 to exemplify the processing power of the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a>. The demonstration's director (and future director of "Super Mario Galaxy"), <a href="Yoshiaki%20Koizumi">Yoshiaki Koizumi</a>, desired that one of its distinguishing features, <a href="Sphere">spherical</a>-based platforms, should be used in a future game, but was held back in belief that such a feature would be impossible for technical reasons. "Super Mario" creator <a href="Shigeru%20Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> suggested to work on the next large-scale Mario game after <a href="Nintendo%20EAD%20Tokyo">Nintendo EAD Tokyo</a> finished development on "<a href="Donkey%20Kong%20Jungle%20Beat">Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</a>" in late 2004, pushing for the spherical platform concept to be realised. A <a href="Software%20prototyping">prototype</a> of the game's physics system took three months to build, where it was decided that the game's use of spherical platforms would best be suited to planetoids in an outer space environment, with the concept of gravity as a major feature. During development, the designers would often exchange ideas with Miyamoto from his office in <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>, where he would make suggestions to the game design. According to Koizumi, many ideas were conceived before development of the Wii console itself begun.

The idea for Mario to have a "spin" attack came during the early stages of development, when it was decided that jumping on enemies on a spherical map would be difficult for some players – at one point, Koizumi remarked that making characters jump in a 3D environment was "absurd". Takeo Shimizu, the game's producer and programmer, noted that the most basic action in a 3D action game was to simply run, and concluded that the easiest way to attack was to "spin", not jump. Prior to the development team shifting focus on the Wii and realising the potential of its different controls, the "spin" attack was originally planned to be executed by swivelling the analogue stick on the GameCube controller. The "spin" was initially activated via rotation of the Nunchuk's control stick, but after <a href="motion%20sensing">motion sensing</a> was confirmed to be implemented in the Wii Remote, the "spin" was changed to be activated through shaking the latter. Nintendo president <a href="Satoru%20Iwata">Satoru Iwata</a> wanted to prioritise the game's "fun factor" by giving the player a sense of achievement after they have completed a difficult task; Iwata noted an increasing number of consumers giving up during a video game and thus wanted "Super Mario Galaxy" to appeal to that audience. In response, the development team created a co-operative mode which allowed one player to control Mario whilst the other controlled the pointer with the Wii Remote, therefore enabling lesser experienced players to enjoy themselves in the game.

The development team wanted the game to be enjoyed from the ages of "5 to 95", so during early stages of development they took steps to ensure that the player would adjust to the game without difficulty. However, Miyamoto thought that it was too easy and lacked insensitivity, asserting that a game loses its excitement when it is made unchallenging. To balance out the difficulty, Koizumi suggested that Mario's health meter should have a maximum capacity of three instead of eight, but at the same time more 1-Up Mushrooms and <a href="Continue%20point">checkpoints</a> would be placed in the game. Koizumi said that he wanted to alter the game's "intensity factor" by limiting the number of hits the player could take to three, as opposed to "Super Mario 64" and "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>", which featured eight. Retrospectively, Iwata added that decreasing the health meter to three from eight is "representative of the things that players do not notice that actually changes the gameplay dramatically".

With the concept of gravity and spherical platforms being the central elements of gameplay, the development team drafted several ideas on how to implement them into the game. Koichi Hayashida, a co-designer of the game, initially expressed scepticism of incorporating a spherical playing field into a jump-based platform game, stating that it would be "a bad match". Shimizu also had a negative reaction to the idea, with his main concern being that the implementation of spherical platforms would be impossible to achieve due to technical reasons, and "felt a sense of danger" when the plan was eventually approved. However, once Shimizu started <a href="debug">debug</a>ging the game he realised that the experience felt "totally fresh" and thought that he was "playing a game like nothing that's come before it". Futoshi Shirai, the game's level designer, stated that unlike Hayashida and Shimizu, he had a positive impression of the new gameplay elements. Shirai liked the idea of being able to run on different types of planetoids, and came up with designs such as planets in the shape of ice cream and apples. Because the game was in outer space, the team could devise ideas that would have otherwise been hard to implement in other "Super Mario" games. Shirai said that the benefit of working with a spherical-shaped world was that they could design and discover new things, with Kenta Motokura, the game's artist, similarly stating that the player would be continuously enjoying their adventure by travelling to new planets. Koizumi appreciated the "free and open" feel of developing the game, saying that it enabled the team to make the game more fun for the player.

Throughout development, staff members enjoyed the level of freedom the game offered, in particular the transforming abilities of Mario. Iwata noted that Mario's Bee Suit was popular with women, and also stated that the titular character's other suits were designed to add variations to the gameplay. According to Hayashida, the idea to include transformations in the game came from Koizumi. One of the female members of staff who worked on "Super Mario Galaxy" wrote a note saying "I want a Bee Mario" when asked by Koizumi what they wanted to transform Mario into. Shirai stated that the development team always discussed their ideas together, and devised ways to incorporate an idea into the game and make it more entertaining. Iwata concluded that having the game take place in space was advantageous, as it was flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of ideas.

After development was finished, the team reflected that the fundamental part of a "Super Mario" game was to make the player think about how "fun" it was to play the game itself, rather than simply finishing it. To accomplish this, Koizumi made sure that there were certain areas of the game which could be enjoyed by all types of people, including children. Shimizu added that "Super Mario Galaxy"s ulterior motive was to have everybody "gather around the TV", as he felt that a game starring Mario was not necessarily something which could be enjoyed by playing alone. The game was made to support six different save files – Shimizu liked the idea of one player looking at the progress of another player and seeing how they compared against their own. Iwata stated that when the first "Super Mario" game was released, there used to be "many more" people gathering around the television who would enjoy watching the gameplay experience. Iwata asserted that well-made video games were more enjoyable to spectate, and hoped that "Super Mario Galaxy"s co-operative mode would tempt someone who does not usually play video games to join.

During development, <a href="Mahito%20Yokota">Mahito Yokota</a>, who was in charge of the musical direction, originally wanted "Super Mario Galaxy" to have a <a href="Latin%20American%20music">Latin American style of music</a>; and even had composed 28 tracks in that style. Latin American percussion instruments had already been featured in previous "Super Mario" instalments, such as <a href="steelpan">steelpan</a>s, <a href="bongo%20drum">bongo drum</a>s, and <a href="conga">conga</a>s. For "Super Mario Galaxy"s theme, Yokota used Latin American instruments and a synthesiser to replicate the sounds featured in old science fiction films. The composition was approved by Yoshiaki Koizumi, the game's director and designer, but when Yokota presented it to the game's sound supervisor, <a href="Koji%20Kondo">Koji Kondo</a>, he stated that it was "no good". When asked why his music was rejected, Kondo responded: "if somewhere in your mind you have an image that Mario is cute, please get rid of it". Incensed by the rejection, Yokota almost resigned from his job, but Kondo implied that Mario's character was "cool" and instructed him to try again.

According to Yokota, he was under the impression that Mario was suited for children, causing him to create "cute" music that would appeal to the targeted audience. Three months later, Yokota presented three different styles of music to Miyamoto: one piece had an orchestral sound, the other had pop music, and the last featured a mix of both orchestral and pop music. Miyamoto chose the orchestral piece, as it sounded the most "space-like". Yokota stated that Miyamoto chose the piece without knowing that Kondo actually wrote it. In a retrospective interview, Satoru Iwata said that Miyamoto chose the music that sounded "space-like" because he was looking for a sound that would express the game, in contrast to the tropical sounds of "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Bros">Super Mario Bros</a>". Yokota revealed that he initially struggled to create music that sounded like a "Super Mario" game, but as time progressed he declared that the songs he made for the game had "become natural".

To create a sense of variety with the soundtrack, Yokota and Kondo wrote pieces individually; Kondo composed four pieces for the game whereas Yokota composed the rest. Kondo composed the pieces that Yokata specifically requested, as he thought that the game's soundtrack would "end up all sounding the same" if it were composed by one person. The game originally heavily utilised the Wii Remote speaker for "all sorts of sound [effects]", but Masafumi Kawamura, the game's sound director, decided they were redundant when played in tandem with those from the television. Kawamura decided to restrict Wii Remote sound effects to those triggered by Mario's actions, such as hitting an enemy, feeling that it better <a href="Immersion%20%28virtual%20reality%29">immersed</a> the player.

The game's soundtrack features 28 <a href="orchestra">orchestra</a>l songs performed by a 50-person symphony orchestra. Yokota initially had concerns whether or not orchestral music would fit in with the rhythm of a Mario game, but thought that such music would make the scale of the game "seem more epic". Kondo, on the other hand, believed if orchestral music were used the player would be "obligated to play the game in time to the music". To synchronise the soundtrack to gameplay, Kawamura utilised similar techniques he used to synchronise sound effects in "" and "Donkey Kong Jungle Beat" — in which the game synchronises <a href="MIDI">MIDI</a> data with streaming data, resulting in sound effects playing at the same time as background music. To make synchronisation possible, the audio team requested the orchestra to perform at different tempos set with a <a href="metronome">metronome</a>.

The official soundtrack was released on 24 January 2008. It was initially an exclusive to <a href="Club%20Nintendo">Club Nintendo</a> subscribers in Japan, although the soundtrack became available to European Club Nintendo members in November 2008. The soundtrack was released in two versions: the "Original Soundtrack", which only contains 28 tracks from the game, and the "Platinum Edition", which contains another 53 tracks on a second disc for a total of 81 tracks. In North America, the "Original Soundtrack" was included in a Wii console bundle alongside "<a href="New%20Super%20Mario%20Bros.%20Wii">New Super Mario Bros. Wii</a>" in 2011.

"Super Mario Galaxy" has received universal acclaim, becoming the sixth highest rated game of all-time on review aggregator <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, having an aggregate score of 97 out of 100 based on 73 reviews. It is the highest-rated game of all time on <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a>, having a 97.64% ranking based on 78 reviews.

The visuals and presentation were the most praised aspects of the game. Chris Scullion of the "<a href="Official%20Nintendo%20Magazine">Official Nintendo Magazine</a>" asserted that the graphics pushes the Wii to its full potential, and stated that its visual effects and large playing areas would constantly astound the player. Jeremy Parish from "<a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>" noted that despite the Wii's limitations, the visuals were "absolutely impressive", especially when modified at a higher resolution. "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>"s Andrew Robinson opined that Nintendo favoured gameplay over graphics, but thought "Super Mario Galaxy" "got both perfect". Margaret Robertson of "<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>" called the visuals an "explosion of inventiveness", stating that the game's detail is only matched by its mission design ingenuity. Andrew Reiner of "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" approved of the game's portrayal of water and particle effects, but noted the visuals were in similar detail to "Super Mario Sunshine". Patrick Shaw from "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" opined that the game takes full advantage of the Wii's capabilities, both in terms of presentation and control schemes.

Regarding the presentation, "<a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a>"s Chris Hudak thought that "Super Mario Galaxy" was a "next-gen reincarnation" of "<a href="Super%20Mario%2064">Super Mario 64</a>", stating the game was polished, engaging and evocative. Alex Navarro of "<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>" commended the colourful and vibrant level details, animations and character designs, saying that "there simply isn't a better-looking Wii game available". Furthermore, Navarro praised the <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a>'s ability of keeping frame rate drops to "infrequent bouts". Bryn Williams of "<a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>" asserted that the game had the best visuals on the Wii, saying that the graphics "are out of this world" and that its wide range of colours produces "better-than-expected" texturing. A reviewer from "<a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a>" stated that "words simply can't describe" the game's visual concepts. Louis Bedigan from "GameZone" thought the visualisations from "Super Mario Galaxy" contrast from the blocky characters of previous "Super Mario" games, praising the planet designs as beautiful and everything else as "pure eye candy". Matt Casamassina of "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" thought "Super Mario Galaxy" was the only game that pushed the Wii console, stating it combines "great art" with "great tech", resulting in what he described to be "stunning results". David Halverson of "<a href="Play%20%28US%20magazine%29">Play</a>" opined that the game was "supremely" polished and featured "gorgeous next-gen" graphics.

The gameplay, in particular the gravity <a href="game%20mechanics">mechanics</a> and use of the Wii Remote, was also praised. A reviewer from "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" commented on the game's tempo, believing it was "abnormally good" and that the different variations in level design and difficulty gradually "builds things up". A reviewer from "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" praised the game's use of the Wii Remote, stating the control schemes were more subtle and persuasive as opposed to the "vigorous literalism" of "". Scullion was initially sceptical about using the Wii Remote as a pointer, but admitted that "within mere minutes it felt like we'd been doing this since the days of "Mario 64"". Scullion also thought that the game's strongest aspect was the "incomparable" gameplay. Parish praised the fluctuating gravity that was featured in the game, stating that it "makes even the wildest challenge feel almost second nature". Robinson similarly commended the gravity, saying that the different uses of the game's gravitational pulls allows the scale of to grow to "genuinely draw-dropping proportions". Robertson regarded the use of gravity as an "explosion of inventiveness". Reiner thought that the game reinvented the platform genre for the <a href="seventh%20generation%20of%20video%20game%20consoles">seventh generation of video game consoles</a>, stating that "Super Mario Galaxy" was both nostalgic and new by breaking the <a href="laws%20of%20physics">laws of physics</a>.

Shaw asserted that the new gameplay mechanics reinvigorated the "Super Mario" franchise, and summarised by saying it was the best title since "Super Mario 64". Similarly, Hudak thought that the game was a reincarnation of "Super Mario 64", whilst stating that the variety of gameplay had a "signature Miyamoto style". Navarro said that the level designs were "top flight in every regard" and also praised the game's introduction of suits, adding that they brought a "great dimension" to gameplay. Williams opined that the game's "shallow" two-player mode did not add anything to the overall experience. He did praise the various gameplay components and the use of both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck, stating that the setup was "pinpoint accurate". A reviewer from "GamesRadar" thought that the control scheme had a fluid response that improved over the controls of its predecessor, "Super Mario Sunshine". Regarding the controls and world designs, Bedigan stated that both aspects are "close to perfection as a game can get". Casamassina found the gameplay mechanics, in particular varying physics, as "ridiculously entertaining". He also regarded the motion control as being well implemented, stating that the player would appreciate the change of pace that the levels offer. Halverson particularly commended the innovative controls, saying the Wii Remote and Nunchuck was "at its finest" and that it was difficult to imagine playing it in another fashion.

The soundtrack and audio were well received by critics. Scullion believed it to be the best out of any "Super Mario" game, declaring that each track matches the environments featured throughout the game. Parish considered the orchestrated music superior to the visuals, saying that the dynamic sounds were "quintessentially Mario" yet uncharacteristically sophisticated. Reiner stated that the orchestrated soundtrack was beautiful as well as nostalgic, with Robinson similarly citing it as "amazing". Navarro praised the modernised orchestrated soundtrack, stating that it was both excellent and "top-notch". Williams thought the game featured the best sound on the Wii, stating that original soundtrack would "go down in history" as Nintendo's best first-party effort. A reviewer from "GamesRadar" stated that "Super Mario Galaxy" featured the finest orchestral bombast ever heard in a game. Bedigan asserted that the soundtrack was "another step forward" in <a href="video%20game%20music">video game music</a>, praising the music as moving and breathtaking. Casamassina judged the game's music "so exceptional" and "absolutely superb", summarising that it had the best music out of any Nintendo game to date. Hudak criticised the "traditional Mario-esque" lack of voice acting, despite admitting that if the game did feature voice acting it would "probably seem lame and wrong".

"Super Mario Galaxy" has been a commercial success, selling 350,000 units in Japan within its first few weeks of sale. In the United States, the game sold 500,000 units within its first week of release, earning it the highest first-week sales for a Mario game in the country at the time. The <a href="NPD%20Group">NPD Group</a> reported that 1.4 million copies of the game were sold in the US in December 2007, making it the highest-selling game of the month, and that the game had become the fifth bestselling game of 2007 with 2.52 million units having been sold since its release. After 13 months, it had sold 7.66 million copies worldwide. By January 2010, the game had sold 4.1 million units in the US, and by February it had become one of nine Wii title to surpass 5 million unit sales in the country. By the end of September 2018, Nintendo had sold 12.78 million copies of the game worldwide, making it the third bestselling <a href="product%20bundling">non-bundled</a> Wii game and the ninth bestselling Nintendo-published game for the Wii.

In their final issue, the "Official Nintendo Magazine" ranked "Super Mario Galaxy" as the greatest Nintendo game of all time. The soundtrack also won the "Best Design in Audio" award from "Edge".

In the 1,000th issue of "Famitsu", Miyamoto expressed his interest in making a sequel to "Super Mario Galaxy". The game was originally called ""Super Mario Galaxy More"" during development, and was initially going to feature variations of planets featured in "Super Mario Galaxy". Over time, new elements and ideas were brought into the game, and it was decided that the game would be a full sequel. "Super Mario Galaxy 2" was announced during the Nintendo conference at <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3</a> 2009 held in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. It was released on 23 May 2010 in North America, 27 May 2010 in Japan and on 11 June 2010 in Europe. The sequel has been met with as much critical acclaim as its predecessor, and has sold 6.36 million copies worldwide as of April 2011.

"Super Mario Galaxy", as well as several other Wii games, was rereleased for <a href="Nvidia">Nvidia</a>'s <a href="Shield%20Tablet">Shield Tablet</a> in China on 22 March 2018 as the result of a partnership between Nintendo, Nvidia and <a href="iQiyi">iQiyi</a>. The game runs on the Shield via an <a href="emulator">emulator</a>, but has interface and control modifications, and support for <a href="1080p">1080p</a> resolution. Due to the lack of motion controls on the Shield, some controls are remapped; for example, the on-screen pointer is remapped to the right analogue stick and the button to choose a Galaxy is remapped to the right trigger.

"The Dark Side of the Moon" and "The Wall" became two of the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20albums">best-selling albums of all time</a>.

Following creative tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd; Wright rejoined them as a session musician and, later, band member. The three produced two more albums—"<a href="A%20Momentary%20Lapse%20of%20Reason">A Momentary Lapse of Reason</a>" (1987) and "<a href="The%20Division%20Bell">The Division Bell</a>" (1994)—and toured through 1994. After nearly two decades of enmity, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason reunited with Waters in 2005 to perform as Pink Floyd in London as part of the global awareness event <a href="Live%208">Live 8</a>; Gilmour and Waters stated they had no further plans to reunite the band. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, "<a href="The%20Endless%20River">The Endless River</a>" (2014), was recorded without Waters and based almost entirely on unreleased material from "The Division Bell" recording sessions.

Pink Floyd were inducted into the American <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 1996 and the <a href="UK%20Music%20Hall%20of%20Fame">UK Music Hall of Fame</a> in 2005. By 2013, they had sold more than 250 million records worldwide.

<a href="Roger%20Waters">Roger Waters</a> and <a href="Nick%20Mason">Nick Mason</a> met while studying architecture at the <a href="University%20of%20Westminster">London Polytechnic</a> at <a href="Regent%20Street">Regent Street</a>. They first played music together in a group formed by Keith Noble and Clive Metcalfe with Noble's sister Sheilagh. <a href="Richard%20Wright%20%28musician%29">Richard Wright</a>, a fellow architecture student, joined later that year, and the group became a sextet, Sigma 6. Waters played lead guitar, Mason drums, and Wright rhythm guitar (since there was rarely an available keyboard). The band performed at private functions and rehearsed in a <a href="Tea%20house">tearoom</a> in the basement of the Regent Street Polytechnic. They performed songs by the <a href="The%20Searchers%20%28band%29">Searchers</a> and material written by their manager and songwriter, fellow student Ken Chapman.

In September 1963, Waters and Mason moved into a flat at 39 Stanhope Gardens near <a href="Crouch%20End">Crouch End</a> in London, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the nearby <a href="Hornsey%20College%20of%20Art">Hornsey College of Art</a> and the Regent Street Polytechnic. Mason moved out after the 1964 academic year, and guitarist <a href="Bob%20Klose">Bob Klose</a> moved in during September 1964, prompting Waters' switch to bass. Sigma 6 went through several names, including the Meggadeaths, the Abdabs and the Screaming Abdabs, Leonard's Lodgers, and the Spectrum Five, before settling on the Tea Set. In 1964, as Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own band, guitarist <a href="Syd%20Barrett">Syd Barrett</a> joined Klose and Waters at Stanhope Gardens. Barrett, two years younger, had moved to London in 1962 to study at the <a href="Camberwell%20College%20of%20Arts">Camberwell College of Arts</a>. Waters and Barrett were childhood friends; Waters had often visited Barrett and watched him play guitar at Barrett's mother's house. Mason said about Barrett: "In a period when everyone was being cool in a very adolescent, self-conscious way, Syd was unfashionably outgoing; my enduring memory of our first encounter is the fact that he bothered to come up and introduce himself to me."

Noble and Metcalfe left the Tea Set in late 1963, and Klose introduced the band to singer Chris Dennis, a technician with the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF). In December 1964, they secured their first recording time, at a studio in West Hampstead, through one of Wright's friends, who let them use some down time free. Wright, who was taking a break from his studies, did not participate in the session. When the RAF assigned Dennis a post in Bahrain in early 1965, Barrett became the band's frontman. Later that year, they became the resident band at the Countdown Club near <a href="Kensington%20High%20Street">Kensington High Street</a> in London, where from late night until early morning they played three sets of 90 minutes each. During this period, spurred by the group's need to extend their sets to minimise song repetition, the band realised that "songs could be extended with lengthy solos", wrote Mason. After pressure from his parents and advice from his college tutors, Klose quit the band in mid-1965 and Barrett took over lead guitar. The group first referred to themselves as the Pink Floyd Sound in late 1965. Barrett created the name on the spur of the moment when he discovered that another band, also called the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs. The name is derived from the given names of two <a href="blues">blues</a> musicians whose <a href="Piedmont%20blues">Piedmont blues</a> records Barrett had in his collection, <a href="Pink%20Anderson">Pink Anderson</a> and <a href="Floyd%20Council">Floyd Council</a>.

By 1966, the group's repertoire consisted mainly of <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">rhythm and blues</a> songs and they had begun to receive paid bookings, including a performance at the <a href="Marquee%20Club">Marquee Club</a> in March 1966, where <a href="Peter%20Jenner">Peter Jenner</a>, a lecturer at the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Economics">London School of Economics</a>, noticed them. Jenner was impressed by the sonic effects Barrett and Wright created, and with his business partner and friend <a href="Andrew%20King%20%28music%20manager%29">Andrew King</a> became their manager. The pair had little experience in the <a href="music%20industry">music industry</a> and used King's inheritance to set up <a href="Blackhill%20Enterprises">Blackhill Enterprises</a>, purchasing about £1,000 () worth of new instruments and equipment for the band. It was around this time that Jenner suggested they drop the "Sound" part of their band name, thus becoming the Pink Floyd. Under Jenner and King's guidance, the group became part of London's <a href="underground%20music">underground music</a> scene, playing at venues including All Saints Hall and the Marquee. While performing at the Countdown Club, the band had experimented with long instrumental excursions, and they began to expand them with rudimentary but effective light shows, projected by coloured slides and domestic lights. Jenner and King's social connections helped gain the band prominent coverage in the "<a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a>" and an article in the "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">Sunday Times</a>" which stated: "At the launching of the new magazine "<a href="International%20Times">IT</a>" the other night a pop group called the Pink Floyd played throbbing music while a series of bizarre coloured shapes flashed on a huge screen behind them ... apparently very psychedelic."

In 1966, the band strengthened their business relationship with Blackhill Enterprises, becoming equal partners with Jenner and King and the band members each holding a one-sixth share. By late 1966, their set included fewer R&B standards and more Barrett originals, many of which would be included on their first album. While they had significantly increased the frequency of their performances, the band were still not widely accepted. Following a performance at a Catholic youth club, the owner refused to pay them, claiming that their performance was not music. When their management filed suit in a small claims court against the owner of the youth organisation, a local magistrate upheld the owner's decision. The band was much better received at the <a href="UFO%20Club">UFO Club</a> in London, where they began to build a fan base. Barrett's performances were enthusiastic, "leaping around ... madness ... improvisation ... [inspired] to get past his limitations and into areas that were ... very interesting. Which none of the others could do", wrote biographer <a href="Nicholas%20Schaffner">Nicholas Schaffner</a>.

In 1967, Pink Floyd began to attract the attention of the music industry. While in negotiations with record companies, "IT" co-founder and UFO club manager <a href="Joe%20Boyd">Joe Boyd</a> and Pink Floyd's booking agent <a href="Bryan%20Morrison">Bryan Morrison</a> arranged and funded a recording session at <a href="Sound%20Techniques">Sound Techniques</a> in <a href="West%20Hampstead">West Hampstead</a>. Three days later, Pink Floyd signed with EMI, receiving a £5,000 advance (). EMI released the band's first single, "<a href="Arnold%20Layne">Arnold Layne</a>", with the B-side "<a href="Candy%20and%20a%20Currant%20Bun">Candy and a Currant Bun</a>", on 10 March 1967 on its <a href="Columbia%20Graphophone%20Company">Columbia</a> label. Both tracks were recorded on 29 January 1967. "Arnold Layne"'s references to <a href="cross-dressing">cross-dressing</a> led to a ban by several radio stations; however, creative manipulation by the retailers who supplied sales figures to the music business meant that the single peaked in the UK at number 20.

EMI-Columbia released Pink Floyd's second single, "<a href="See%20Emily%20Play">See Emily Play</a>", on 16 June 1967. It fared slightly better than "Arnold Layne", peaking at number 6 in the UK. The band performed on the BBC's "Look of the Week", where Waters and Barrett, erudite and engaging, faced tough questioning from <a href="Hans%20Keller">Hans Keller</a>. They appeared on the BBC's "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Pops">Top of the Pops</a>", a popular programme that controversially required artists to mime their singing and playing. Though Pink Floyd returned for two more performances, by the third, Barrett had begun to unravel, and it was around this time that the band first noticed significant changes in his behaviour. By early 1967, he was regularly using <a href="lysergic%20acid%20diethylamide">LSD</a>, and Mason described him as "completely distanced from everything going on".

Morrison and EMI producer <a href="Norman%20Smith%20%28record%20producer%29">Norman Smith</a> negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, and as part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">EMI Studios</a> in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released "<a href="The%20Piper%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Dawn">The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</a>" in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the <a href="Tower%20Records%20%28record%20label%29">Tower Records</a> label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, <a href="Marc%20Bolan%23Tyrannosaurus%20Rex">June Child</a>, who commented: "I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down".

Forced to cancel Pink Floyd's appearance at the prestigious <a href="National%20Jazz%20and%20Blues%20Festival">National Jazz and Blues Festival</a>, as well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist <a href="R.%20D.%20Laing">R. D. Laing</a>, and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused to come out of the car. A stay in <a href="Formentera">Formentera</a> with <a href="Hank%20Wangford">Sam Hutt</a>, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement. The band followed a few concert dates in Europe during September with their first tour of the US in October. As the US tour went on, Barrett's condition grew steadily worse. During appearances on the <a href="Dick%20Clark">Dick Clark</a> and <a href="Pat%20Boone">Pat Boone</a> shows in November, Barrett confounded his hosts by not responding to questions and staring off into space. He refused to move his lips when it came time to <a href="Lip%20sync">mime</a> "See Emily Play" on Boone's show. After these embarrassing episodes, King ended their US visit and immediately sent them home to London. Soon after their return, they supported <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> during a tour of England; however, Barrett's depression worsened as the tour continued, reaching a crisis point in December, when the band responded by adding a new member to their line-up.

In December 1967, the group added guitarist <a href="David%20Gilmour">David Gilmour</a> as the fifth member of Pink Floyd. Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied with him at Cambridge Tech in the early 1960s. The two had performed at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and <a href="Street%20performance">busked</a> their way around the south of France. In 1965, while a member of <a href="Jokers%20Wild%20%28band%29">Joker's Wild</a>, Gilmour had watched the Tea Set. Morrison's assistant, <a href="Steve%20O%27Rourke">Steve O'Rourke</a>, set Gilmour up in a room at O'Rourke's house with a salary of £30 per week (), and in January 1968, Blackhill Enterprises announced Gilmour as the band's newest member; the second guitarist and its fifth member, the band intending to continue with Barrett as a nonperforming songwriter. Jenner commented: "The idea was that Dave would ... cover for [Barrett's] eccentricities and when that got to be not workable, Syd was just going to write. Just to try to keep him involved". In an expression of his frustration, Barrett, who was expected to write additional hit singles to follow up "Arnold Layne" and "See Emily Play", instead introduced "<a href="List%20of%20unreleased%20Pink%20Floyd%20material%23%26quot%3BHave%20You%20Got%20It%20Yet%3F%26quot%3B">Have You Got It Yet?</a>" to the band, intentionally changing the structure on each performance so as to make the song impossible to follow and learn. In a January 1968 photo-shoot of the five-man Pink Floyd, the photographs show Barrett looking detached from the others, staring into the distance.

Working with Barrett eventually proved too difficult, and matters came to a conclusion in January while en route to a performance in <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> when a band member asked if they should collect Barrett. According to Gilmour, the answer was "Nah, let's not bother", signalling the end of Barrett's tenure with Pink Floyd. Waters later admitted, "He was our friend, but most of the time we now wanted to strangle him". In early March 1968, Pink Floyd met with business partners Jenner and King to discuss the band's future; Barrett agreed to leave.

Jenner and King believed Barrett to be the creative genius of the band, and decided to represent him and end their relationship with Pink Floyd. Morrison then sold his business to <a href="Brian%20Epstein">NEMS Enterprises</a>, and O'Rourke became the band's personal manager. Blackhill announced Barrett's departure on 6 April 1968. After Barrett's departure, the burden of lyrical composition and creative direction fell mostly on Waters. Initially, Gilmour mimed to Barrett's voice on the group's European TV appearances; however, while playing on the university circuit, they avoided Barrett songs in favour of Waters and Wright material such as "<a href="It%20Would%20Be%20So%20Nice">It Would Be So Nice</a>" and "<a href="Careful%20with%20That%20Axe%2C%20Eugene">Careful with That Axe, Eugene</a>".

In 1968, Pink Floyd returned to Abbey Road Studios to record their second album, "A Saucerful of Secrets". The album included Barrett's final contribution to their discography, "<a href="Jugband%20Blues">Jugband Blues</a>". Waters began to develop his own songwriting, contributing "<a href="Set%20the%20Controls%20for%20the%20Heart%20of%20the%20Sun">Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun</a>", "<a href="Let%20There%20Be%20More%20Light">Let There Be More Light</a>" and "<a href="Corporal%20Clegg">Corporal Clegg</a>". Wright composed "<a href="See-Saw%20%28song%29">See-Saw</a>" and "<a href="Remember%20a%20Day">Remember a Day</a>". Norman Smith encouraged them to self-produce their music, and they recorded demos of new material at their houses. With Smith's instruction at Abbey Road, they learned how to use the recording studio to realise their artistic vision. However, Smith remained unconvinced by their music, and when Mason struggled to perform his drum part on "Remember a Day", Smith stepped in as his replacement. Wright recalled Smith's attitude about the sessions, "Norman gave up on the second album ... he was forever saying things like, 'You can't do twenty minutes of this ridiculous noise'". As neither Waters nor Mason could read music, to illustrate the structure of the album's <a href="A%20Saucerful%20of%20Secrets%20%28song%29">title track</a>, they invented their own system of notation. Gilmour later described their method as looking "like an architectural diagram".

Released in June 1968, the album featured a <a href="Psychedelia">psychedelic</a> cover designed by <a href="Storm%20Thorgerson">Storm Thorgerson</a> and <a href="Aubrey%20Powell%20%28designer%29">Aubrey Powell</a> of <a href="Hipgnosis">Hipgnosis</a>. The first of several Pink Floyd album covers designed by Hipgnosis, it was the second time that EMI permitted one of their groups to contract designers for an album jacket. The release peaked at number 9, spending 11 weeks on the UK chart. "<a href="Record%20Mirror">Record Mirror</a>" gave the album an overall favourable review, but urged listeners to "forget it as background music to a party". <a href="John%20Peel">John Peel</a> described a live performance of the title track as "like a religious experience", while "<a href="NME">NME</a>" described the song as "long and boring ... [with] little to warrant its monotonous direction". On the day after the album's UK release, Pink Floyd performed at the first ever free <a href="List%20of%20concerts%20in%20Hyde%20Park">concert in Hyde Park</a>. In July 1968, they returned to the US for a second visit. Accompanied by the <a href="Soft%20Machine">Soft Machine</a> and <a href="the%20Who">the Who</a>, it marked Pink Floyd's first significant tour. In December of that year, they released "<a href="Point%20Me%20at%20the%20Sky">Point Me at the Sky</a>"; no more successful than the two singles they had released since "See Emily Play", it would be the band's last until their 1973 release, "<a href="Money%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">Money</a>".

"Ummagumma" represented a departure from their previous work. Released as a double-LP on EMI's <a href="Harvest%20Records">Harvest</a> label, the first two sides contained live performances recorded at <a href="Manchester%20College%20of%20Commerce">Manchester College of Commerce</a> and <a href="Mothers%20%28music%20venue%29">Mothers</a>, a club in Birmingham. The second LP contained a single experimental contribution from each band member. "Ummagumma" received positive reviews upon its release, in November 1969. The album peaked at number 5, spending 21 weeks on the UK chart.

In October 1970, Pink Floyd released "Atom Heart Mother". An early version premièred in France in January, but disagreements over the mix prompted the hiring of <a href="Ron%20Geesin">Ron Geesin</a> to work out the sound problems. Geesin worked to improve the score, but with little creative input from the band, production was troublesome. Geesin eventually completed the project with the aid of <a href="John%20Alldis">John Alldis</a>, who was the director of the choir hired to perform on the record. Smith earned an executive producer credit, and the album marked his final official contribution to the band's discography. Gilmour said it was "A neat way of saying that he didn't ... do anything". Waters was critical of "Atom Heart Mother", claiming that he would prefer if it were "thrown into the dustbin and never listened to by anyone ever again". Gilmour was equally dismissive of the album and once described it as "a load of rubbish", stating: "I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period". Pink Floyd's first number 1 album, "Atom Heart Mother" was hugely successful in Britain, spending 18 weeks on the UK chart. It premièred at the Bath Festival on 27 June 1970.

Pink Floyd toured extensively across America and Europe in 1970. In 1971, Pink Floyd took second place in a reader's poll, in "Melody Maker", and for the first time were making a profit. Mason and Wright became fathers and bought homes in London while Gilmour, still single, moved to a 19th-century farm in Essex. Waters installed a home recording studio at his house in <a href="Islington">Islington</a> in a converted toolshed at the back of his garden.
In January 1971, upon their return from touring "Atom Heart Mother", Pink Floyd began working on new material. Lacking a central theme, they attempted several unproductive experiments; engineer John Leckie described the sessions as often beginning in the afternoon and ending early the next morning, "during which time nothing would get [accomplished]. There was no record company contact whatsoever, except when their label manager would show up now and again with a couple of bottles of wine and a couple of joints". The band spent long periods working on basic sounds, or a guitar riff. They also spent several days at Air Studios, attempting to create music using a variety of household objects, a project which would be revisited between "The Dark Side of the Moon" and "<a href="Wish%20You%20Were%20Here%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20album%29">Wish You Were Here</a>".

Released in October 1971, ""Meddle" not only confirms lead guitarist David Gilmour's emergence as a real shaping force with the group, it states forcefully and accurately that the group is well into the growth track again", wrote Jean-Charles Costa of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>". "NME" called "Meddle" "an exceptionally good album", singling out "<a href="Echoes%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">Echoes</a>" as the "Zenith which the Floyd have been striving for". However, "Melody Maker's" Michael Watts found it underwhelming, calling the album "a soundtrack to a non-existent movie", and shrugging off Pink Floyd as "so much sound and fury, signifying nothing". "Meddle" is a transitional album between the Barrett-influenced group of the late 1960s and the emerging Pink Floyd. The LP peaked at number 3, spending 82 weeks on the UK chart.

Pink Floyd recorded "The Dark Side of the Moon" between May 1972 and January 1973, with EMI staff engineer <a href="Alan%20Parsons">Alan Parsons</a> at Abbey Road. The title is an allusion to lunacy rather than astronomy. The band had composed and refined the material on "Dark Side" while touring the UK, Japan, North America and Europe. Producer <a href="Chris%20Thomas%20%28record%20producer%29">Chris Thomas</a> assisted Parsons. Hipgnosis designed the album's packaging, which included <a href="George%20Hardie%20%28artist%29">George Hardie</a>'s iconic refracting <a href="Prism%20%28optics%29">prism</a> design on the cover. Thorgerson's "Dark Side" album cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The resulting refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity. Waters is the sole author of the album's lyrics.
Released in March 1973, the LP became an instant chart success in the UK and throughout Western Europe, earning an enthusiastic response from critics. Each member of Pink Floyd except Wright boycotted the press release of "The Dark Side of the Moon" because a quadraphonic mix had not yet been completed, and they felt presenting the album through a poor-quality stereo <a href="Public%20address%20system">PA system</a> was insufficient. "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>"s Roy Hollingworth described side one as "utterly confused ... [and] difficult to follow", but praised side two, writing: "The songs, the sounds ... [and] the rhythms were solid ... [the] saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled". "Rolling Stone"s <a href="Loyd%20Grossman">Loyd Grossman</a> described it as "a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement."

Throughout March 1973, "The Dark Side of the Moon" featured as part of Pink Floyd's US tour. The album is one of the most commercially successful rock albums of all time; a US number 1, it remained on the "<a href="Billboard%20200">Billboard</a>" chart for more than fourteen years, selling more than 45 million copies worldwide. In Britain, the album peaked at number 2, spending 364 weeks on the UK chart. "Dark Side" is the world's third best-selling album, and the twenty-first best-selling album of all time in the US. The success of the album brought enormous wealth to the members of Pink Floyd. Waters and Wright bought large country houses while Mason became a collector of expensive cars. Disenchanted with their US record company, <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a>, Pink Floyd and O'Rourke negotiated a new contract with <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>, who gave them a reported advance of $1,000,000 (US$ in dollars). In Europe, they continued to be represented by Harvest Records.

After a tour of the UK performing "Dark Side", Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975 and began work on their ninth studio album, "Wish You Were Here". Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with <a href="the%20Alan%20Parsons%20Project">the Alan Parsons Project</a>, and so the band turned to Brian Humphries. Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of "The Dark Side of the Moon" had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained. Wright later described these early sessions as "falling within a difficult period" and Waters found them "tortuous". Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming.

Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks. During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate. Waters commented: "Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... [that] indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd."

While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio, during which Thorgerson recalled that he "sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there." He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him. Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience. Most of "Wish You Were Here" premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at <a href="Knebworth%20House">Knebworth</a>. Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US.

In 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at <a href="Britannia%20Row%20Studios">35 Britannia Row</a> in Islington and began converting the building into a recording studio and storage space. In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, "Animals", in their newly finished 24-track studio. The concept of "Animals" originated with Waters, loosely based on <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s political fable, "<a href="Animal%20Farm">Animal Farm</a>". The album's lyrics described different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging of "Animals"; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing <a href="Battersea%20Power%20Station">Battersea Power Station</a>, over which they superimposed an image of a pig.

The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for "Dogs", which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part "<a href="Pigs%20on%20the%20Wing">Pigs on the Wing</a>". Wright commented: "It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material ... but Dave "did" have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there." Mason recalled: "Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately." Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward "Animals"; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering. "Animals" is the first Pink Floyd album that does not include a writing credit for Wright, who commented: ""Animals" ... wasn't a fun record to make ... this was when Roger "really" started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band ... that it was only because of him that [we] were still going ... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me."

Released in January 1977, the album peaked on the UK chart at number two, and the US chart at number three. "<a href="NME">NME</a>" described the album as "one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright iconoclastic hunks of music", and "Melody Maker"s <a href="Karl%20Dallas">Karl Dallas</a> called it "[an] uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific".

Pink Floyd performed much of the album's material during their "<a href="In%20the%20Flesh%20%281977%20Pink%20Floyd%20%27Animals%27%20tour%29">In the Flesh</a>" tour. It was the band's first experience playing large stadiums, whose size caused unease in the band. Waters began arriving at each venue alone, departing immediately after the performance. On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to leave the band. At the <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> <a href="Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Montreal%29">Olympic Stadium</a>, a group of noisy and enthusiastic fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters so much that he spat at one of them. The end of the tour marked a low point for Gilmour, who felt that the band achieved the success they had sought, with nothing left for them to accomplish.

In July 1978, amid a financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented the group with two original ideas for their next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title "Bricks in the Wall", and the other would later become Waters' first solo album, "<a href="The%20Pros%20and%20Cons%20of%20Hitch%20Hiking">The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking</a>". Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former to be their next album. <a href="Bob%20Ezrin">Bob Ezrin</a> co-produced, and he wrote a forty-page script for the new album. Ezrin based the story on the central figure of Pink—a "gestalt" character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was the death of his father in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person.

During the recording of "The Wall", Waters, Gilmour and Mason became increasingly dissatisfied with Wright's lack of contribution to the album. Gilmour said that Wright "hadn't contributed anything of any value whatsoever to the album—he did very, very little" and this was why he "got the boot". According to Mason, "Rick's contribution was to turn up and sit in on the sessions without doing anything, just 'being a producer'." Waters commented: "[Wright] was not prepared to cooperate in making the record ... [and] it was agreed by everybody ... either [he] can have a long battle or [he] can agree to ... finish making the album, keep [his] full share ... but at the end of it [he would] leave quietly. Rick agreed."

The album was supported by "<a href="Another%20Brick%20in%20the%20Wall%2C%20Part%20II">Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)</a>", Pink Floyd's first single since "Money", which topped the charts in the US and the UK. After its official release on 30 November 1979, "The Wall" topped the "Billboard" chart in the US for fifteen weeks, reaching number three in the UK. "The Wall" ranks number three on the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">RIAA</a>'s list of the all-time Top 100 albums, with 23 million certified units sold in the US. The cover is one of their most <a href="Minimalism%23Minimalist%20design">minimalist designs</a>, with a stark white brick wall, and no trademark or band name. It was also their first album cover since "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn" not designed by Hipgnosis.

<a href="Gerald%20Scarfe">Gerald Scarfe</a> produced a series of animations for the subsequent live shows, "The Wall Tour". He also commissioned the construction of large inflatable puppets representing characters from the storyline including the "Mother", the "Ex-wife" and the "Schoolmaster". Pink Floyd used the puppets during their performances of the album. Relationships within the band were at an all-time low; their four <a href="Winnebago%20Industries">Winnebagos</a> parked in a circle, the doors facing away from the centre. Waters used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue and stayed in different hotels from the rest of the band. Wright returned as a paid musician and was the only one of the four to profit from the venture, which lost about $600,000 (US$ in dollars).

"The Wall" concept also spawned a film, the original idea for which was to be a combination of live concert footage and animated scenes. However, the concert footage proved impractical to film. <a href="Alan%20Parker">Alan Parker</a> agreed to direct and took a different approach. The animated sequences would remain, but scenes would be acted by professional actors with no dialogue. Waters was screen-tested, but quickly discarded and they asked <a href="Bob%20Geldof">Bob Geldof</a> to accept the role of Pink. Geldof was initially dismissive, condemning "The Wall"s storyline as "bollocks". Eventually won over by the prospect of participation in a significant film and receiving a large payment for his work, Geldof agreed. Screened at the <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a> in May 1982, "<a href="Pink%20Floyd%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Wall">Pink Floyd – The Wall</a>" premièred in the UK in July 1982.

In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title "Spare Bricks", originally conceived as the soundtrack album for "Pink Floyd – The Wall." With the onset of the <a href="Falklands%20War">Falklands War</a>, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>'s response to the invasion of the Falklands as <a href="Jingoism">jingoistic</a> and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for "The Wall". Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. <a href="Michael%20Kamen">Michael Kamen</a>, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of "The Wall", mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.

Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, "<a href="The%20Final%20Cut%20%28album%29">The Final Cut</a>" went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: "I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on "The Final Cut"." "Rolling Stone" magazine gave the album five stars, with <a href="Kurt%20Loder">Kurt Loder</a> calling it "a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning masterpiece". Loder viewed "The Final Cut" as "essentially a Roger Waters solo album".

Gilmour recorded his second solo album, "<a href="About%20Face%20%28album%29">About Face</a>", in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a> to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, "<a href="The%20Pros%20and%20Cons%20of%20Hitch%20Hiking">The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking</a>". Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded "<a href="Identity%20%28Zee%20album%29">Identity</a>", which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, "<a href="Profiles%20%28Nick%20Mason%20and%20Rick%20Fenn%20album%29">Profiles</a>", in August 1985.

Following the release of "The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking", Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to <a href="EMI">EMI</a> and <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia</a> announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court</a> in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd "a spent force creatively." When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour responded by issuing a carefully worded press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist. He later told "The Sunday Times": "Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him." In 2013, Waters said he had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the band members, and was wrong to have attempted to stop the others using it.

In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, "<a href="A%20Momentary%20Lapse%20of%20Reason">A Momentary Lapse of Reason</a>". There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions. Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence "would make us stronger legally and musically", and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings of $11,000. Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the "<a href="Astoria%20%28recording%20studio%29">Astoria</a>", moored along the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>. Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including <a href="Eric%20Stewart">Eric Stewart</a> and <a href="Roger%20McGough">Roger McGough</a>, eventually choosing <a href="Anthony%20Moore">Anthony Moore</a> to write the album's lyrics. Gilmour would later admit that the project was difficult without Waters' creative direction. Mason, concerned that he was too out-of-practice to perform on the album, made use of session musicians to complete many of the drum parts. He instead busied himself with the album's sound effects.

"A Momentary Lapse of Reason" was released in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from "The Wall" and "The Final Cut", designed the album cover. To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since "Meddle". The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: "I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... [and] Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate." Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: "Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at all." "Q Magazine" described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo album.

Waters attempted to subvert the "Momentary Lapse of Reason "tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his <a href="Ferrari%20250%20GTO">Ferrari 250 GTO</a> as collateral. Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice. Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured North America, Waters' "<a href="Radio%20K.A.O.S.">Radio K.A.O.S.</a>" tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the <a href="Pink%20Floyd%20pigs">flying pig</a>. Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained the right to use the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, "The Wall".

For several years Pink Floyd had busied themselves with personal pursuits, such as filming and competing in the <a href="La%20Carrera%20Panamericana">La Carrera Panamericana</a> and recording a soundtrack for a film based on the event. In January 1993, they began working on a new album, returning to Britannia Row Studios, where for several days, Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, improvising material. After about two weeks, the band had enough ideas to begin creating songs. Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production moved to the Astoria, where from February to May 1993, they worked on about 25 ideas.

Contractually, Wright was not a member of the band, and said "It came close to a point where I wasn't going to do the album." However, he earned five co-writing credits on the album, his first on a Pink Floyd album since 1975's "Wish You Were Here". Another songwriter credited on the album was Gilmour's future wife, <a href="Polly%20Samson">Polly Samson</a>. She helped him write several tracks, including, "<a href="High%20Hopes%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">High Hopes</a>", a collaborative arrangement which, though initially tense, "pulled the whole album together," according to Ezrin. They hired Michael Kamen to arrange the album's orchestral parts; <a href="Dick%20Parry">Dick Parry</a> and Chris Thomas also returned. Writer <a href="Douglas%20Adams">Douglas Adams</a> provided the album title and Thorgerson the cover artwork. Thorgerson drew inspiration for the album cover from the <a href="Moai">Moai</a> monoliths of <a href="Easter%20Island">Easter Island</a>; two opposing faces forming an implied third face about which he commented: "the absent face—the ghost of Pink Floyd's past, Syd and Roger". Eager to avoid competing against other album releases, as had happened with "A Momentary Lapse", Pink Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would resume touring. The album reached number 1 in both the UK and the US. It spent 51 weeks on the UK chart.

Pink Floyd spent more than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at <a href="Norton%20Air%20Force%20Base">Norton Air Force Base</a> in <a href="San%20Bernardino%2C%20California">San Bernardino, California</a>, before opening on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost identical road crew to that used for their "Momentary Lapse of Reason" tour. They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include "The Dark Side of the Moon" in its entirety. The tour, Pink Floyd's last, ended on 29 October 1994.

On 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd for the first time in more than 24 years, at the <a href="Live%208">Live 8</a> concert in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park</a>, London. The reunion was arranged by Live 8 organiser <a href="Bob%20Geldof">Bob Geldof</a>; after Gilmour declined the offer, Geldof asked Mason, who contacted Waters. About two weeks later, Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day Gilmour agreed. In a statement to the press, the band stressed the unimportance of their problems in the context of the Live 8 event.

They planned their setlist at the <a href="The%20Connaught%20%28hotel%29">Connaught Hotel</a> in London, followed by three days of rehearsals at Black Island Studios. The sessions were problematic, with disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order was decided on the eve of the event. At the beginning of their performance of "Wish You Were Here", Waters told the audience: "[It is] quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these years, standing to be counted with the rest of you ... we're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd." At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage. Waters called him back, and the band shared a group hug. Images of the hug were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8. Waters said of their almost 20 years of animosity: "I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit ... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity."

Though Pink Floyd turned down a contract worth £136 million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting it ought to be for a charity event only. However, Gilmour told the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> that a reunion would not happen: "The [Live 8] rehearsals convinced me [that] it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of ... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just ... I've been there, I've done it." In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed by Gino Castaldo from the Italian newspaper "<a href="La%20Repubblica">La Repubblica</a>", which declared: "Patience for fans in mourning. The news is official. Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased." Asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: "It's over ... I've had enough. I'm 60 years old ... it is much more comfortable to work on my own." Gilmour and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite with the former members.

Barrett died on 7 July 2006, at his home in Cambridge, aged 60. His family interred him at Cambridge Crematorium on 18 July 2006; no Pink Floyd members attended. Wright commented: "The band are very naturally upset and sad to hear of Syd Barrett's death. Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire." Although Barrett had faded into obscurity over the previous 35 years, the national press praised him for his contributions to music. On 10 May 2007, Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed at the Barrett tribute concert "Madcap's Last Laugh" at the <a href="Barbican%20Centre">Barbican Centre</a> in London. Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed the Barrett compositions, "<a href="Bike%20%28song%29">Bike</a>" and "Arnold Layne", and Waters performed a solo version of his song "Flickering Flame".

Wright died of an undisclosed form of cancer on 15 September 2008, aged 65. His former bandmates paid tributes to his life and work; Gilmour said: "In the welter of arguments about who or what was Pink Floyd, Rick's enormous input was frequently forgotten. He was gentle, unassuming and private but his soulful voice and playing were vital, magical components of our most recognised Pink Floyd sound." A week after Wright's death, Gilmour performed "Remember a Day" from "A Saucerful of Secrets", written and originally sung by Wright, in tribute to him. Keyboardist <a href="Keith%20Emerson">Keith Emerson</a> released a statement praising Wright as the "backbone" of Pink Floyd.

On 10 July 2010, Waters and Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation. The event, which raised money for Palestinian children, took place at Kiddington Hall in Oxfordshire, England, with an audience of approximately 200. In return for Waters' appearance at the event, Gilmour performed "Comfortably Numb" at Waters' <a href="The%20Wall%20Live%20%282010%E2%80%9313%29">performance of "The Wall"</a> at the London <a href="The%20O2%20Arena">O2 Arena</a> on 12 May 2011, singing the choruses and playing the two guitar solos. Mason also joined, playing tambourine for "<a href="Outside%20the%20Wall%20%28song%29">Outside the Wall</a>" with Gilmour on mandolin.

On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title "<a href="Why%20Pink%20Floyd%20...%20%3F">Why Pink Floyd ... ?</a>", reissuing the band's back catalogue in newly <a href="Audio%20mastering">remastered</a> versions, including "Experience" and "Immersion" multi-disc multi-format editions. The albums were remastered by <a href="James%20Guthrie%20%28record%20producer%29">James Guthrie</a>, co-producer of "The Wall". In November 2015, Pink Floyd released a limited edition EP, "", comprising six songs recorded prior to "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn".

In 2012, Gilmour and Mason decided to revisit recordings made with Wright, mainly during the "Division Bell "sessions, to create a new Pink Floyd album. They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and "generally harness studio technology". Waters was not involved. Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: "I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound. Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was."

"<a href="The%20Endless%20River">The Endless River</a> "was released on 7 November 2014, the second Pink Floyd album distributed by <a href="Parlophone">Parlophone</a> following the release of the 20th anniversary editions of "The Division Bell" earlier in 2014. Though it received mixed reviews, it" "became the most pre-ordered album of all time on <a href="Amazon%20UK">Amazon UK</a>, and debuted at number one in several countries. The vinyl edition was the fastest-selling UK vinyl release of 2014 and the fastest-selling since 1997.

Gilmour stated that "The Endless River" is Pink Floyd's last album, saying: "I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ... It's a shame, but this is the end." There was no tour to support the album, as Gilmour felt it was "kind of impossible" without Wright. In August 2015, Gilmour reiterated that Pink Floyd were "done" and that to reunite without Wright "would just be wrong".

In November 2016, Pink Floyd released a boxset, "<a href="The%20Early%20Years%201965%E2%80%931972%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20album%29">The Early Years 1965–1972</a>", comprising outtakes, live recordings, remixes, and films from their early career. In 2018, Mason formed a new band, <a href="Nick%20Mason%27s%20Saucerful%20of%20Secrets">Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets</a>, to perform Pink Floyd's early material. The band includes <a href="Gary%20Kemp">Gary Kemp</a> of <a href="Spandau%20Ballet">Spandau Ballet</a> and longtime Pink Floyd collaborator <a href="Guy%20Pratt">Guy Pratt</a>. They toured Europe in September 2018.

Considered one of the UK's first <a href="psychedelic%20music">psychedelic music</a> groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene. Some categorise their work from that era as <a href="space%20rock">space rock</a>. According to "Rolling Stone": "By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that touched on <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a>, blues, <a href="country%20music">country</a>, <a href="folk%20music">folk</a>, and <a href="electronic%20music">electronic music</a>." Released in 1968, the song "Careful with That Axe, Eugene" helped galvanise their reputation as an <a href="art%20rock">art rock</a> group. Other genres attributed to the band are <a href="experimental%20rock">experimental rock</a>, <a href="acid%20rock">acid rock</a>, <a href="proto-prog">proto-prog</a>, <a href="experimental%20pop">experimental pop</a> (while under Barrett). and <a href="psychedelic%20pop">psychedelic pop</a>, By the late 1960s, the press had begun to label their music <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a>. O'Neill Surber comments on the music of Pink Floyd:
Rarely will you find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or predictable three-chord blues progressions; and never will you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype. Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging ... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often seems to have a life of its own ... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance.
In 1968, Wright commented on Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: "It's hard to see why we were cast as the first British psychedelic group. We never saw ourselves that way ... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun ... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted ... the emphasis ... [is] firmly on spontaneity and improvisation." Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental' ... Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't want to go back to playing "<a href="Interstellar%20Overdrive">Interstellar Overdrive</a>" for hours and hours." Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and <a href="ambient%20music">ambient music</a> during the 1980s.

"Rolling Stone" critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar work as an integral to Pink Floyd's sound, and described him as the most important guitarist of the 1970s, "the missing link between Hendrix and <a href="Eddie%20Van%20Halen">Van Halen</a>". "Rolling Stone" ranked Gilmour number 14 in their list of "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time". In 2006, Gilmour said of his technique: "[My] fingers make a distinctive sound ... [they] aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable ... The way I play melodies is connected to things like <a href="Hank%20Marvin">Hank Marvin</a> and <a href="the%20Shadows">the Shadows</a>". Gilmour's ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to <a href="jazz">jazz</a> trumpeter <a href="Miles%20Davis">Miles Davis</a>.

In 2006, "Guitar World" writer Jimmy Brown described Gilmour's guitar style as "characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures." According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on "Money", "<a href="Time%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">Time</a>" and "<a href="Comfortably%20Numb">Comfortably Numb</a>" "cut through the mix like a laser beam through fog." Brown described the "Time" solo as "a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development ... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato." Brown described Gilmour's phrasing as intuitive, singling it out as perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: "I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting ... [to get] singing sustain ... you need to play loud—at or near the feedback threshold. It's just so much more fun to play ... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade."

Throughout their career, Pink Floyd experimented with their sound. Their second single, "See Emily Play" premiered at the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20Hall">Queen Elizabeth Hall</a> in London, on 12 May 1967. During the performance, the group first used an early <a href="Quadraphonic%20sound">quadraphonic device</a> called an <a href="Azimuth%20Co-ordinator">Azimuth Co-ordinator</a>. The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, to manipulate the band's amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect. In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system.

Waters experimented with the <a href="EMS%20Synthi%20A">EMS Synthi A</a> and <a href="EMS%20VCS%203">VCS 3</a> synthesisers on Pink Floyd pieces such as "<a href="On%20the%20Run%20%28instrumental%29">On the Run</a>", "<a href="Welcome%20to%20the%20Machine">Welcome to the Machine</a>", and "<a href="In%20the%20Flesh%3F">In the Flesh?</a>". He used a Binson Echorec 2 delay effect on his bass-guitar track for "<a href="One%20of%20These%20Days%20%28instrumental%29">One of These Days</a>".

Pink Floyd used innovative sound effects and state of the art audio recording technology during the recording of "The Final Cut". Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental <a href="Holophonics">Holophonic</a> system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect. The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones. The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears.

Pink Floyd also composed several film scores, starting in 1968, with "<a href="The%20Committee%20%28film%29">The Committee</a>". In 1969, they recorded the score for <a href="Barbet%20Schroeder">Barbet Schroeder</a>'s film "<a href="More%20%281969%20film%29">More</a>". The soundtrack proved beneficial: not only did it pay well but, along with "A Saucerful of Secrets", the material they created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter. While composing the soundtrack for director <a href="Michelangelo%20Antonioni">Michelangelo Antonioni</a>'s film "<a href="Zabriskie%20Point%20%28film%29">Zabriskie Point</a>", the band stayed at a luxury hotel in Rome for almost a month. Waters claimed that, without Antonioni's constant changes to the music, they would have completed the work in less than a week. Eventually he used only three of their recordings. One of the pieces turned down by Antonioni, called "The Violent Sequence", later became "Us and Them", included on 1973's "The Dark Side of the Moon". In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film "<a href="La%20Vall%C3%A9e%20%28film%29">La Vallée</a>", for which they released a soundtrack album called "<a href="Obscured%20by%20Clouds">Obscured by Clouds</a>". They composed the material in about a week at the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20d%27H%C3%A9rouville">Château d'Hérouville</a> near Paris, and upon its release, it became Pink Floyd's first album to break into the top 50 on the US "Billboard" chart.

Regarded as pioneers of <a href="Concert">live music</a> performance and renowned for their lavish stage shows, Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, making use of innovative sound effects and quadraphonic speaker systems. From their earliest days, they employed visual effects to accompany their psychedelic rock music while performing at venues such as the UFO Club in London. Their slide-and-light show was one of the first in British rock, and it helped them become popular among London's underground.

To celebrate the launch of the <a href="London%20Free%20School">London Free School</a>'s magazine "International Times" in 1966, they performed in front of 2,000 people at the opening of <a href="Roundhouse%20%28venue%29">the Roundhouse</a>, attended by celebrities including <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> and <a href="Marianne%20Faithfull">Marianne Faithfull</a>. In mid-1966, road manager Peter Wynne-Willson joined their road crew, and updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas including the use of <a href="Polarizer">polarisers</a>, mirrors and stretched <a href="condom">condom</a>s. After their record deal with EMI, Pink Floyd purchased a <a href="Ford%20Transit">Ford Transit</a> van, then considered extravagant band transportation. On 29 April 1967, they headlined an all-night event called "<a href="The%2014%20Hour%20Technicolour%20Dream">The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream</a>" at the <a href="Alexandra%20Palace">Alexandra Palace</a>, London. Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at around three o'clock in the morning after a long journey by van and ferry from the Netherlands, taking the stage just as the sun was beginning to rise. In July 1969, precipitated by their space-related music and lyrics, they took part in the live BBC television coverage of the <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a> moon landing, performing an instrumental piece which they called "<a href="Moonhead%20%28song%29">Moonhead</a>".

In November 1974, they employed for the first time the large circular screen that would become a staple of their live shows. In 1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named "Algie". Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience, would explode with a loud noise during the In the Flesh Tour. The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album "<a href="The%20Wall">The Wall</a>". The subsequent <a href="The%20Wall%20Tour">The Wall Tour</a> featured a high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience. They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes from the story. They commissioned the creation of several giant inflatables to represent characters from the story. One striking feature of the tour was the performance of "Comfortably Numb". While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue on top of the wall. When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly reveal him. Gilmour stood on a <a href="Road%20case">flightcase</a> on castors, an insecure setup supported from behind by a technician. A large hydraulic platform supported both Gilmour and the tech.

During the <a href="The%20Division%20Bell%20Tour">Division Bell Tour</a>, an unknown person using the name <a href="Publius%20Enigma">Publius</a> posted a message on an internet newsgroup inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. White lights in front of the stage at the Pink Floyd concert in <a href="East%20Rutherford%2C%20New%20Jersey">East Rutherford</a> spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court on 20 October 1994, someone projected the word "enigma" in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that their record company had instigated the Publius Enigma mystery, rather than the band.

Marked by Waters' philosophical lyrics, "Rolling Stone" described Pink Floyd as "purveyors of a distinctively dark vision". Author Jere O'Neill Surber wrote: "their interests are truth and illusion, life and death, time and space, causality and chance, compassion and indifference." Waters identified <a href="empathy">empathy</a> as a central theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd. Author George Reisch described "Meddle" psychedelic opus, "Echoes", as "built around the core idea of genuine communication, <a href="sympathy">sympathy</a>, and "collaboration" with others." Despite having been labelled "the gloomiest man in rock", author Deena Weinstein described Waters as an <a href="Existentialism">existentialist</a>, dismissing the unfavourable moniker as the result of misinterpretation by music critics.

Waters' lyrics to "Wish You Were Here" "<a href="Have%20a%20Cigar">Have a Cigar</a>" deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives. The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes "Pink" is the name of one of the band members. According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the "dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce", a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience.

Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. Waters' lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, "Obscured by Clouds", dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of "Wish You Were Here": "The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling." Waters commented: "it's about none of us really being there ... [it] should have been called "Wish We Were Here"".

O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of <a href="Being%20and%20Nothingness%23Nothingness">non-being</a> a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in "The Wall", with the lyrics to "Comfortably Numb": "I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone." Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, "Jugband Blues": "I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here."

Author Patrick Croskery described "Animals" as a unique blend of the "powerful sounds and suggestive themes" of "Dark Side" with "The Wall" portrayal of artistic alienation. He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's "Animal Farm". "Animals" begins with a thought experiment, which asks: "If you didn't care what happened to me. And I didn't care for you", then develops a <a href="beast%20fable">beast fable</a> based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each. The lyrics ultimately paint a picture of <a href="dystopia">dystopia</a>, the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines.

The album's characters include the "Dogs", representing fervent capitalists, the "Pigs", symbolising political corruption, and the "Sheep", who represent the exploited. Croskery described the "Sheep" as being in a "state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity", a <a href="false%20consciousness">false consciousness</a>. The "Dog", in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone with no one to trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation. Waters used <a href="Mary%20Whitehouse">Mary Whitehouse</a> as an example of a "Pig"; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society. At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: "You know that I care what happens to you. And I know that you care for me too." However, he also acknowledges that the "Pigs" are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a "Dog" who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them.

O'Neill Surber compared the lyrics of "Dark Side of the Moon" "<a href="Brain%20Damage%20%28song%29">Brain Damage</a>" with <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a> theory of <a href="Social%20alienation%23Self-estrangement">self-alienation</a>; "there's someone in my head, but it's not me." The lyrics to "Wish You Were Here" "Welcome to the Machine" suggest what Marx called the <a href="Marx%27s%20theory%20of%20alienation">alienation of the thing</a>; the song's protagonist preoccupied with material possessions to the point that he becomes estranged from himself and others. Allusions to the <a href="Marx%27s%20theory%20of%20alienation%23Types%20of%20alienation">alienation of man's species being</a> can be found in "Animals"; the "Dog" reduced to living instinctively as a non-human. The "Dogs" become alienated from themselves to the extent that they justify their lack of integrity as a "necessary and defensible" position in "a cutthroat world with no room for empathy or moral principle" wrote Detmer. <a href="Marx%27s%20theory%20of%20alienation%23Types%20of%20alienation">Alienation from others</a> is a consistent theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd, and it is a core element of "The Wall".

War, viewed as the most severe consequence of the manifestation of alienation from others, is also a core element of "The Wall", and a recurring theme in the band's music. Waters' father died in combat during the Second World War, and his lyrics often alluded to the cost of war, including those from "Corporal Clegg" (1968), "<a href="Free%20Four">Free Four</a>" (1972), "<a href="Us%20and%20Them%20%28song%29">Us and Them</a>" (1973), "<a href="When%20the%20Tigers%20Broke%20Free">When the Tigers Broke Free</a>" and "<a href="The%20Fletcher%20Memorial%20Home">The Fletcher Memorial Home</a>" from "The Final Cut" (1983), an album dedicated to his late father and subtitled "A Requiem for the Postwar Dream". The themes and composition of "The Wall" express Waters' upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War, a condition that negatively affected his personal relationships with women.

Waters' lyrics to "The Dark Side of the Moon" dealt with the pressures of modern life and how those pressures can sometimes cause insanity. He viewed the album's explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal condition. However, Waters also wanted the album to communicate positivity, calling it "an exhortation ... to embrace the positive and reject the negative." Reisch described "The Wall" as "less about the experience of madness than the habits, institutions, and social structures that "create" or "cause" madness." "The Wall" protagonist, Pink, is unable to deal with the circumstances of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making. After he completes his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is "crazy, over the rainbow". He then considers the possibility that his condition may be his own fault: "have I been guilty all this time?" Realising his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has let everyone down, his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him. He then stands trial for "showing feelings of an almost human nature", further exacerbating his alienation of species being. As with the writings of philosopher <a href="Michel%20Foucault">Michel Foucault</a>, Waters' lyrics suggest Pink's insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, "custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies", contribute to his angst, according to Reisch.

Pink Floyd are one of the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20music%20artists">most commercially successful</a> and influential rock bands of all time. They have sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the United States, and 37.9 million albums sold in the US since 1993. The "<a href="Sunday%20Times%20Rich%20List">Sunday Times Rich List</a>", Music Millionaires 2013 (UK), ranked Waters at number 12 with an estimated fortune of £150 million, Gilmour at number 27 with £85 million and Mason at number 37 with £50 million.

In 2004, <a href="MSNBC">MSNBC</a> ranked Pink Floyd number 8 on their list of "The 10 Best Rock Bands Ever". "Rolling Stone" ranked them number 51 on their list of "The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time". "<a href="Q%20magazine">Q</a>" named Pink Floyd as the biggest band of all time. <a href="VH1">VH1</a> ranked them number 18 in the list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". <a href="Colin%20Larkin%20%28writer%29">Colin Larkin</a> ranked Pink Floyd number 3 in his list of the 'Top 50 Artists of All Time', a ranking based on the cumulative votes for each artist's albums included in his "<a href="All%20Time%20Top%201000%20Albums">All Time Top 1000 Albums</a>".

Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ

Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ (26 May 1908 – 12 June 1976) was a <a href="Vietnamese%20people">Vietnamese</a> politician who was the first <a href="Leaders%20of%20South%20Vietnam%23Prime%20Ministers">Prime Minister of South Vietnam</a>, serving from November 1963 to late January 1964. Thơ was appointed to head a civilian cabinet by the <a href="military%20junta">military junta</a> of General <a href="D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20V%C4%83n%20Minh">Dương Văn Minh</a>, which came to power after <a href="1963%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">overthrowing</a> and <a href="Arrest%20and%20assassination%20of%20Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">assassinating</a> <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">Ngô Đình Diệm</a>, the nation's first president. Thơ's rule was marked by a period of confusion and weak government, as the Military Revolutionary Council (MRC) and the civilian cabinet vied for power. Thơ lost his job and retired from politics when Minh's junta was deposed in a <a href="1964%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">January 1964 coup</a> by General <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Kh%C3%A1nh">Nguyễn Khánh</a>.

The son of a wealthy <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a> landowner, Thơ rose through the ranks as a low-profile provincial chief under <a href="French%20Indochina">French colonial rule</a>, and he was briefly imprisoned by <a href="Imperial%20Japan">Imperial Japan</a> when they invaded and deposed the French during World War II. During this time he met Minh for the first time as they shared a cell. Following World War II, he became the Interior Minister in the French-backed <a href="State%20of%20Vietnam">State of Vietnam</a>, an associated state in the <a href="French%20Union">French Union</a>. After the establishment of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Republic of Vietnam</a> in 1955 following the <a href="partition%20of%20Vietnam">partition</a> in 1954, Thơ was sent to Japan as ambassador and secured war reparations. Recalled to Vietnam within a year, he helped to dismantle the private armies of the <a href="H%C3%B2a%20H%E1%BA%A3o">Hòa Hảo</a> religious sect in the mid-1950s. Tho led the political efforts to weaken the Hòa Hảo leadership. While Minh led the military effort, Thơ tried to buy off Hòa Hảo leaders. One commander, <a href="Ba%20C%E1%BB%A5t">Ba Cụt</a>, was personally hostile to Thơ, whose father had confiscated the land of Ba Cụt's family decades earlier. The stand-off could not be ended peacefully in this case, and Ba Cụt was captured and executed.

This success earned Thơ the vice presidential slot in December 1956 to widen the popular appeal of Diệm's nepotistic and sectarian regime. It was reasoned that Thơ's southern heritage would broaden the regime's political appeal—Diệm's family was from central Vietnam and most administrators were not from South Vietnam. Thơ was not allowed to take part in policy decisions and had little meaningful power, as Diệm's brothers, <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Nhu">Nhu</a> and <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20C%E1%BA%A9n">Cẩn</a>, commanded their own private armies and secret police, and ruled arbitrarily. Thơ oversaw South Vietnam's failed land reform policy, and was accused of lacking vigour in implementing the program as he was himself a large landowner. He was noted for his faithful support of Diệm during the <a href="Buddhist%20crisis">Buddhist crisis</a> that ended the rule of the Ngô family. Despite nominally being a Buddhist, Thơ defended the regime's pro-Roman Catholic policies and its violent actions against the Buddhist majority.

Thơ turned against Diệm and played a passive role in the coup. Upon the formation of the new government, he struggled to keep the nation under control as the MRC and civilian cabinet often gave contradictory orders. Media freedom and political debate were increased, but this backfired as Saigon became engulfed in infighting, and Thơ had a series of newspapers shut down after they used the new-found freedom to attack him. During that time, South Vietnam's military situation deteriorated as the consequences of Diệm's falsification of military statistics and the misguided policies that resulted were exposed. Minh and Thơ had a plan to try to end the war by winning over non-communist members of <a href="Viet%20Cong">the insurgency</a>, believing that they constituted the majority of the opposition and could be coaxed away, weakening the communists. As part of this policy, which the U.S. opposed, the government chose to take a low-key military approach in an attempt to portray themselves to the Vietnamese public as peacemakers. However, they were deposed in Khánh's U.S.-backed coup before they could pursue their strategy.

The son of a wealthy southern landowner, Thơ was born in the province of <a href="Long%20Xuy%C3%AAn">Long Xuyên</a> in the <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a>. He began his bureaucratic career in 1930, serving the French colonial authorities as a low-profile provincial chief. During World War II, Thơ rose to become the first secretary of the Resident Superior of <a href="Annam%20%28French%20protectorate%29">Annam</a>, the French governor of the central region of Vietnam. During this time, he crossed paths with <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">Ngô Đình Diệm</a>, a former Interior Minister under the French regime in the 1930s. The French thought that Diệm was working with <a href="Imperial%20Japan">Imperial Japan</a> and tried to have him arrested, but Thơ tipped off Diệm and the <a href="Kempeitai">Kempeitai</a>, resulting in their escape.

In March 1945, Japan, which had invaded and occupied <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a> in 1941 during World War II, decided to take direct control and overthrew the French colonial regime. Thơ was thrown into a crowded cell with several other prisoners that had no light or toilet and filled with their own excrement. One of his cellmates was <a href="D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20V%C4%83n%20Minh">Dương Văn Minh</a>, then a junior officer in the French military forces with whom he would work over the next two decades. Thơ was released first and lobbied to have Minh released as well and the pair remained close friends.

Following World War II, Thơ became Interior Minister in the French-backed <a href="State%20of%20Vietnam">State of Vietnam</a> under former Emperor <a href="B%E1%BA%A3o%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i">Bảo Đại</a>. Following the withdrawal of France from <a href="Indochina">Indochina</a> after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dien%20Bien%20Phu">Battle of Điện Biên Phủ</a>, Vietnam was <a href="partition%20of%20Vietnam">partitioned</a> into a communist north and anti-communist south. Following the proclamation of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Republic of Vietnam</a>—commonly known as South Vietnam—by President <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">Ngô Đình Diệm</a>, who had dethroned Bảo Đại in a <a href="1955%20State%20of%20Vietnam%20referendum">fraudulent referendum</a>, Thơ was appointed the inaugural ambassador to Japan. Despite spending most of his time in Tokyo confined to his bed by a fractured hip, Thơ secured reparations from Japan for its imperial occupation of Vietnam during World War II.

In 1956, Diệm recalled him to <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a> to help deal with the <a href="H%C3%B2a%20H%E1%BA%A3o">Hòa Hảo</a>, a religious sect equipped with a private army. The Hòa Hảo was effectively an autonomous entity in the <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a>, as its private army enforced a parallel administration and refused to integrate into the Saigon administration. While the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> (ARVN) General <a href="D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20V%C4%83n%20Minh">Dương Văn Minh</a> led the military effort against the Hòa Hảo, Thơ helped to weaken the sect by buying off its warlords.

However, one Hòa Hảo commander, <a href="Ba%20C%E1%BB%A5t">Ba Cụt</a>, continued to fight, having had a personal history of bad blood with Thơ's own family. The orphaned, illiterate Cụt's adopted father's <a href="rice%20paddy">rice paddies</a> were confiscated by Thơ's father, which purportedly imbued Cụt with a permanent hatred towards the landowning class. Cụt was eventually surrounded and sought to make a peace deal so he sent a message to Thơ asking for negotiations so that his men could be integrated into mainstream society and the nation's armed forces. Thơ agreed to meet Ba Cụt alone in the jungle, and despite fears the meeting was a Hòa Hảo trap, he was not ambushed. However, Cụt began asking for additional concessions and the meeting ended in a stalemate. Cụt was captured on 13 April 1956 and guillotined after a brief trial and his remaining forces were defeated in battle.

During this period, Thơ was the Secretary of State for the National Economy. In November, Diệm appointed Thơ as vice president in an effort to widen the regime's popular appeal. The appointment was endorsed by the National Assembly in December 1956, in accordance with the constitution. The move was widely seen as an attempt to use Thơ's Mekong Delta roots to increase the government's popular appeal among southern peasants, because Diệm's regime was dominated by family members, Catholics from central Vietnam.

Despite the importance of his title, Thơ rarely appeared with Diệm in public and was a figurehead with little influence. The real power lay with Diệm's younger brothers, <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Nhu">Nhu</a> and <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20C%E1%BA%A9n">Cẩn</a>, who commanded private armies and secret police, as well as giving orders directly to ARVN generals. Nhu reportedly once ordered a bodyguard to slap Thơ because he felt Thơ had shown him a lack of respect. Diệm held Thơ in contempt and did not allow him to take part in major policy decisions, despite theoretically being the second most powerful man in the country. Thơ had a rapport with the military officers, having befriended Minh years earlier. He was regarded as a genial and affable administrator with a reputation for making compromises.

Thơ was charged with overseeing South Vietnam's land reform program, because the minister of agrarian reform, Nguyễn Văn Thoi, answered to him. As both men were wealthy landowners, they had little incentive for the program to succeed. The <a href="Consulate%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States%20in%20Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City">U.S. embassy</a> received angry criticism of Thoi's lack of enthusiasm towards implementing the policy, stating, "he is most certainly not interested in land distribution which would divest him of much of his property".

Thơ also retained a degree of influence over domestic economic policies, which ran far behind Diệm's priorities of absolute control over the military and other apparatus through which he maintained his rule. Despite never having been trained in economic matters, Thơ had a prominent hand in the administration of the <a href="Commodity%20Import%20Program">Commodity Import Program</a>, an American initiative akin to the <a href="Marshall%20Plan">Marshall Plan</a>, whereby aid was funnelled into the economy through importing licenses rather than money, in order to avoid <a href="inflation">inflation</a>. However, Thơ's administration of the program led to the vast majority of the imports being consumer goods for the upper classes, rather than capital goods to develop South Vietnam's economic capacity. Under Thơ's watch, the foreign trade deficit hovered between 150 and 200%, and the gap between the urban elite and the peasant majority grew. American advisers thought Thơ and the Ngô brothers continually went against their counsel because they were either incompetent or simply distrustful and thus did the opposite of what was recommended.

Thơ also clashed with Interior Minister <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20H%E1%BB%AFu%20Ch%C3%A2u">Nguyễn Hữu Châu</a> over economic strategy. Châu was the married to <a href="Madame%20Nhu">Madame Nhu</a>'s sister and appointed due to nepotism, but was later expelled from the Ngô family due to his dissent. The Americans claimed Thơ, who was trained in public security, "knew more about political control than the 'basic laws of the market place'". In mid-1961, after a visit by U.S. Vice President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> and pressure from leading American officials, Diệm relieved Thơ of his economic duties.

Thơ then began to put try to put pressure on the Americans to influence Diệm. During a fact-finding mission by General <a href="Maxwell%20Taylor">Maxwell Taylor</a>, the chief of the U.S. military, and <a href="Walt%20Rostow">Walt Rostow</a>, Thơ and Minh complained of Diệm's autocratic ways and religious favoritism towards his fellow Catholics to the disadvantage of the majority Buddhist populace. In 1962, he told senior U.S. Embassy official <a href="Joseph%20Mendenhall">Joseph Mendenhall</a> that Diệm's military subordinates invented arbitrary and falsely inflated figures of <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a> fighters.

Despite being a Buddhist, Thơ had a reputation for heaping praise on Diệm's Roman Catholic government. On Diệm's 62nd birthday, Thơ paid tribute, saying, "thanks to the Almighty for having given the country a leader whose genius was outweighed only by his virtue". (Buddhism is a <a href="Dharmic%20religion">Dharmic religion</a> which does not recognise a supreme being in a theistic sense.) Thơ later accompanied Diệm to the Roman Catholic Redemptorist Church to pray for the President. Thơ had little public following, with American <a href="Chairman%20of%20the%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> General <a href="Maxwell%20Taylor">Maxwell Taylor</a> calling him "unimpressive", while prominent State Department official Paul Kattenberg derided Thơ as a "nonentity".

In another project, the village of <a href="La%20Vang">La Vang</a> in <a href="Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20Tr%E1%BB%8B%20Province">Quảng Trị Province</a> near the <a href="Vietnamese%20Demilitarized%20Zone">border with North Vietnam</a>, was the scene of a female apparition in the late 19th century. Buddhists claimed that the <a href="bodhisattva">bodhisattva</a> <a href="Avalokiteshvara">Avalokiteshvara</a> (also known as <a href="Kuanyin">Kuanyin</a>; <a href="Vietnamese%20language">Vietnamese</a>: "Quan Âm") performed the miracle. Diệm's brother, <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Th%E1%BB%A5c">Ngô Đình Thục</a>, was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of <a href="Hu%E1%BA%BF">Huế</a> and the foremost religious figure in South Vietnam's nepotistic regime. Thục declared that the apparition was the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>, and ordered that a cathedral be built in place of the makeshift Buddhist pagoda that occupied the site. Thơ made notable financial donations to the project for political reasons.

In June, as the Buddhist crisis escalated, Diệm appointed Thơ to lead a government committee to deal with grievances raised by the Buddhist community following the <a href="Hu%E1%BA%BF%20Vesak%20shootings">Huế Vesak shootings</a> in which eight Buddhists were killed by government forces while protesting a ban on the flying of Buddhist flags. The committee concluded the <a href="Viet%20Cong">Việt Cộng</a> was responsible for the deaths, despite eyewitness accounts and amateur video showing that the government had fired directly at protesters. The committee's whitewash caused Buddhist protests to escalate. When "de facto" First Lady <a href="Madame%20Nhu">Madame Nhu</a> (herself a Buddhist convert to Catholicism) mockingly described the self-immolation of Buddhist monk <a href="Th%C3%ADch%20Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c">Thích Quảng Đức</a> as a "barbecue", Thơ refused to condemn her remarks, saying they were "personal opinions".

Thơ was part of an Interministerial Committee, a group of government officials that negotiated a <a href="Joint%20Communique">Joint Communique</a> with the Buddhists to end the civil disobedience. An agreement was signed, but never implemented. Thơ was later criticised by the Nhus through their English language mouthpiece, the "<a href="Times%20of%20Vietnam">Times of Vietnam</a>", for the deal. Despite the general amnesty granted to arrested Buddhist activists, on 13 August, Thơ gave a press conference during which he vowed to prosecute the Buddhist victims of the Huế <a href="Vesak">Vesak</a> shootings, and revoking the amnesty and vowing to jail Buddhist demonstrators.

At a farewell dinner for U.S. ambassador <a href="Frederick%20Nolting">Frederick Nolting</a> in July, Thơ called for the Buddhists to be "crushed without pity". He derisively said that Buddhism was not a religion and further claimed that while anybody could become a Buddhist monk, it took years of training to become a Catholic priest. When the Thai ambassador disagreed, citing his own previous monastic training, Thơ taunted him in front of other diplomats.

With the pressure on the Diệm regime increasing during the Buddhist crisis, Nhu and Diệm began to shun their cabinet members because they presented arguments contrary to the thinking of the Ngô family. Many ministers attempted to resign, but Thơ was credited with persuading them to stay in office. Finding the situation increasingly intolerable, Thơ also considered resigning but the dissident generals urged him to remain. They were worried that mass resignations would arouse suspicion of a coup plot.

In private, Thơ expressed his displeasure with Diệm's rule to U.S. officials. He complained of Diệm's reliance on Nhu in the running of the country, Nhu's attempt to run a police state through his secret <a href="C%E1%BA%A7n%20Lao">Cần Lao</a> apparatus and the lack of success against the <a href="Viet%20Cong">Việt Cộng</a>. During the <a href="McNamara%20Taylor%20mission">McNamara Taylor mission</a> to South Vietnam, Thơ confided his belief that the country was heading in the wrong direction to the American delegation, imploring them to pressure Diệm to reform his policies. He privately revealed his belief that of the thousands of fortified settlements built under Nhu's <a href="Strategic%20Hamlet%20Program">Strategic Hamlet Program</a>, fewer than thirty were functional.

<a href="Joseph%20Mendenhall">Joseph Mendenhall</a>, a senior Vietnam adviser in the <a href="US%20State%20Department">US State Department</a>, advocated the removal of Diệm in a military coup and his replacement with Thơ. Thơ was privately aware that he was the choice of the generals to run the government after the planned overthrow of Diệm. By this time, Diệm and Nhu realized a plot was afoot against them, but did not know that General <a href="T%C3%B4n%20Th%E1%BA%A5t%20%C4%90%C3%ADnh">Tôn Thất Đính</a>, a palace favourite was involved. Nhu ordered Đính and Colonel <a href="L%C3%AA%20Quang%20Tung">Lê Quang Tung</a>, the <a href="ARVN%20Special%20Forces">ARVN Special Forces</a> commander, to plan a fake coup against the Ngô family.

One of Nhu's objectives was to trick dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated. Another objective of the public relations stunt was to give a false impression of the strength of the regime. The first stage of the scheme would involve loyalist soldiers, disguised as insurgents, faking a coup and vandalising the capital. A "revolutionary government" consisting of opposition activists who had not consented to being named in the regime would be announced, while Diệm and Nhu would pretend to be on the run. During the orchestrated chaos of the first coup, the loyalists and Nhu's underworld contacts would kill the leading plotting generals and their assistants, such as Thơ, CIA agent <a href="Lucien%20Conein">Lucien Conein</a>, and U.S. Ambassador <a href="Henry%20Cabot%20Lodge%20Jr.">Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.</a> A fake "counter-coup" was to follow, whereupon the loyalists would triumphantly re-enter Saigon to restore the Diệm regime. However, the plot failed because Đính was part of the coup plot and sent the loyalist forces out of the capital to open the door for the rebels.

After the <a href="1963%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">coup</a> on 1 November 1963, in which <a href="Arrest%20and%20assassination%20of%20Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">Diệm and Nhu were killed the following day</a>, Thơ was appointed Prime Minister by Minh's military junta five days later, on 6 November 1963. He was the leading civilian in the provisional government overseen by the Military Revolutionary Council (MRC). Minh had earlier promised U.S. officials that the civilians would be above the generals in the hierarchy. In addition, he was minister for finance and the economy. Thơ's appointment was not universally popular, with some leading figures privately lobbying for a clean break from the Diệm era.

Thơ's civilian government was plagued by infighting. According to Thơ's assistant, Nguyễn Ngọc Huy, the presence of Generals <a href="Tr%E1%BA%A7n%20V%C4%83n%20%C4%90%C3%B4n">Trần Văn Đôn</a> and <a href="T%C3%B4n%20Th%E1%BA%A5t%20%C4%90%C3%ADnh">Tôn Thất Đính</a> in both the civilian cabinet and the MRC paralysed the governance process. Đính and Đôn were subordinate to Thơ in the civilian government, but as members of the MRC they were superior to him. Whenever Thơ gave an order in the civilian hierarchy with which the generals disagreed, they would go to the MRC and countermand it.

Saigon newspapers, which had re-opened following the end of Diệm's censorship, reported that the junta was paralysed because all twelve generals in the MRC had equal power. Each member of the MRC had the power of veto, enabling them to stonewall policy decisions. The press, which was liberalised following the downfall of Diệm, strongly attacked Thơ, accusing his government of being "tools" of the MRC. Thơ's record under Diệm's presidency was called into question, with allegations circulating in the media that he had supported the repression of the Buddhists by Diệm and Nhu. Thơ claimed that he had countenanced Nhu's brutal <a href="X%C3%A1%20L%E1%BB%A3i%20Pagoda%20raids">Xá Lợi Pagoda raid</a>, attempting to prove that he would have resigned were it not for Minh's pleas to stay. The media further derided Thơ for the personal benefits that he gained from the Diệm administration's land policy. Minh defended Thơ's anti-Diệm credentials by declaring that Thơ had taken part in the planning of the coup "from the very outset" and that he enjoyed the "full confidence" of the junta.

At one point in December, Thơ could no longer withstand what the free media were publishing about him and called around 100 journalists into his office. An angry Thơ shouted at the writers and banged his first on the table, assailing them for what he regarded as inaccurate, irresponsible and disloyal reporting. Thơ claimed the media were lying in saying that he and his civilian cabinet were puppets of the generals, and claimed that one of the journalists was a communist while another was a drug addict. He said that his administration would "take steps to meet the situation" if the media did not behave responsibly. Having already had his Information Minister, General <a href="%C4%90%E1%BB%97%20M%E1%BA%ADu">Đỗ Mậu</a>, circulate a list of topics that were not to be reported on, Thơ had Mậu close down three newspapers for "disloyalty" on the following day.

On 1 January 1964, a Council of Notables, comprising sixty leading citizens, met for the first time, having been selected by Colonel <a href="Ph%E1%BA%A1m%20Ng%E1%BB%8Dc%20Th%E1%BA%A3o">Phạm Ngọc Thảo</a>. Its job was to advise the military and civilian wings of the government with a view towards reforming human rights, the constitution and the legal system. Thơ publicly stated that he expected a "rational attitude" coupled with "impartial and realistic judgments" and said that it was part of the provisional government's quest to "clear the way for a permanent regime, which our people are longing for". The council consisted almost entirely of professionals and academic leaders, with no representatives from the agricultural or labour movements. It soon became engaged in endless debate and never achieved its initial task of drafting a new constitution. Thơ later admitted that the Council was unrepresentative of South Vietnamese society and had been a failure. He claimed that the council's desire to move away from the <a href="rubber%20stamp%20%28politics%29">rubber stamp</a> model of Diệm's National Assembly had caused it to degenerate into a debating society.

With the fall of Diệm, various American sanctions that were implemented against South Vietnam in response to the repression of the <a href="Buddhist%20crisis">Buddhist crisis</a> and Nhu's Special Forces' <a href="X%C3%A1%20L%E1%BB%A3i%20Pagoda%20raids">Xá Lợi Pagoda raids</a>, were lifted. The freeze on U.S. economic aid, the suspension of the <a href="Commercial%20Import%20Program">Commercial Import Program</a> and various capital works initiatives were lifted. The United States quickly moved to recognise Thơ and Minh.

Thơ's government halted Nhu's <a href="Strategic%20Hamlet%20Program">Strategic Hamlet Program</a>. Nhu had trumpeted the program as the solution to South Vietnam's difficulties with <a href="Viet%20Cong">Việt Cộng</a> insurgents, believing that the mass relocation of peasants into fortified villages would isolate the Viet Cong from their peasant support base. Thơ contradicted Nhu's earlier reports on the success of the program, claiming that only 20% of the 8,600 existing strategic hamlets were under Saigon's control, with the rest having been taken over by the communists. Those hamlets that were deemed to be tenable were consolidated, while the remainder were dismantled and their inhabitants returned to their ancestral land.

Thơ's approach to removing Diệm supporters from positions of influence drew criticism from both supporters and opponents of the deposed president. Some felt he was not vigorous enough in removing pro-Diệm elements from authority, whereas others felt that the magnitude of the turnover of public servants was excessive and bordering on vengeance. A number of officials suspected of having engaged in corruption or Diệmist oppression were indiscriminately arrested without charge, most of whom were later released. Đính and the new national police chief, General <a href="Mai%20H%E1%BB%AFu%20Xu%C3%A2n">Mai Hữu Xuân</a>, were given control of the interior ministry. The pair were accused of arresting people en masse, before releasing them in return for bribes and pledges of loyalty. Not all officials under Diệm could automatically be considered pro-Diệm, yet there were calls for further removals of the old guard. The government was criticised for firing large numbers of district and provincial chiefs directly appointed by Diệm, causing a breakdown in law and order during the abrupt transition of power. One high profile and heavily criticised non-removal was that of General <a href="%C4%90%E1%BB%97%20Cao%20Tr%C3%AD">Đỗ Cao Trí</a>, the commander of the ARVN <a href="I%20Corps%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">I Corps</a> who gained prominence for his particularly stringent anti-Buddhist crackdown in the central region around Huế. Trí was simply transferred to the II Corps in the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Vietnam%29">Central Highlands</a> directly south of the I Corps region.

Thơ and the leading generals in the MRC also had a secret plan to end the communist insurgency, which called itself the National Liberation Front (NLF) and claimed to be independent of the communist government of North Vietnam. They claimed that most of them were first and foremost southern nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention and U.S. involvement and support of Diệm. The MRC and Thơ thought that an agreement to end the war within South Vietnam was possible. Thơ recalled in later years that his government's plan was to generate support among the <a href="Cao%20%C4%90%C3%A0i">Cao Đài</a>, <a href="H%C3%B2a%20H%E1%BA%A3o">Hòa Hảo</a> and ethnic Cambodian minorities, elements of which were in the NLF and bring them back into the mainstream fold out of the insurgency into a non-communist pro-West political system. He thought that it was possible to sideline the communists as he described them as "still having no dominance and only a minor position" within the NLF. According to Thơ, this plan was not a deal with the communists or the NLF as his group saw it as a political attempt to coax back non-communist dissidents and isolate those that were communists.

The government rebuffed American proposals to bomb North Vietnam on the grounds that such actions would cede the moral high ground, which they claimed on the basis of fighting purely for self-defense. For their part, Minh and Thơ's leadership group believed that a more low-key military approach was needed for their political campaign against the insurgency. Minh and Thơ explicitly and bluntly turned down the bombing proposal in a 21 January meeting with US officials. Australian historian Anne E. Blair identified this exchange as sealing the regime's "death warrant".

She pointed out that when the discussion was reported to Washington, the leading US generals in the U.S. military lobbied Defense Secretary <a href="Robert%20McNamara">Robert McNamara</a>, claiming that it was no longer feasible to work within the parameters laid out by Saigon and that the U.S. should simply take control of anti-communist military policy, thereby necessitating a coup. The Americans became increasingly concerned with Saigon's reluctance to intensify the war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans to win over the NLF were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.

The provisional government lacked direction in policy and planning, resulting in its quick collapse. The number of rural attacks instigated by the Viet Cong surged in the wake of Diệm's deposal, due to the displacement of troops into urban areas for the coup. The increasingly free discussion generated from the surfacing of new and accurate data following the coup revealed that the military situation was far worse than what was reported by Diệm. The incidence of <a href="Viet%20Cong">Việt Cộng</a> attacks continued to increase as it had done during the summer of 1963, the weapons loss ratio worsened and the rate of Viet Cong defections fell. The units that participated in the coup were returned to the field to guard against a possible major communist offensive in the countryside. The falsification of military statistics by Diệm's officials had led to miscalculations, which manifested themselves in military setbacks after Diệm's death. Aside from battlefield setbacks, something that was outside his remit, Thơ was also becoming unpopular in the military establishment. One of the goals of the various anti-Minh coup plots at the time was to remove Thơ, and the prime minister's unpopularity helped to distract some of the incumbent officers from the fact that they were the primary target; at that time, the MRC was moving toward removing Thơ, and Minh was the only senior general to retain confidence in him.

On 29 January, General <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Kh%C3%A1nh">Nguyễn Khánh</a> ousted Minh's MRC in a bloodless pre-dawn coup; although Khánh accused the junta of intending to make a deal with the communists and claimed to have proof, he was actually motivated by personal ambition. After Khánh was <a href="1965%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">deposed a year later</a>, he admitted that the allegations against Minh's group were false. In later years, Khánh, Thơ and Minh's generals all agreed that the coup was strongly encouraged by the Americans and could not have occurred without their backing.

Thơ was apprehended during the coup and put under house arrest while the plotters consolidated their grip on power; he was then removed from the political scene. The civilian arm of the government was replaced with Khánh appointees, and Thơ left politics, having personally enriched himself during his period in government. His activities after leaving politics are not known. He died in 1976 in Saigon.
