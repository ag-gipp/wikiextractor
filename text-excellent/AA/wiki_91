Tukwila International Boulevard station

Tukwila International Boulevard is a <a href="light%20rail">light rail</a> <a href="Metro%20station">station</a> in <a href="Tukwila%2C%20Washington">Tukwila, Washington</a>, United States. It is located between <a href="SeaTac/Airport%20station">SeaTac/Airport</a> and <a href="Rainier%20Beach%20station">Rainier Beach</a> stations on the <a href="Central%20Link">Central Link</a> line from <a href="Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma%20International%20Airport">Seattle–Tacoma International Airport</a> to <a href="Downtown%20Seattle">Downtown Seattle</a>. The station consists of two elevated <a href="side%20platform">side platform</a>s enclosed within a structure northeast of the interchange of <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%2099">State Route 99</a> (International Boulevard) and <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20518">State Route 518</a>. As one of two <a href="park%20and%20ride">park and ride</a>s along the line, it includes 662 parking spaces in three lots.

Tukwila International Boulevard station opened on July 18, 2009, on the first day of Central Link service. It was the line's terminus until SeaTac/Airport station opened in December 2009. Construction of the station was approved in 1996, but did not begin until 2005 due to routing disputes and planning issues. Trains serve the station twenty hours a day on most days; the <a href="headway">headway</a> between trains is six minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. Tukwila International Boulevard station is also served by <a href="King%20County%20Metro">King County Metro</a> buses, including two <a href="RapidRide">RapidRide</a> limited-stop <a href="bus%20rapid%20transit">bus rapid transit</a> routes, which connect it to Downtown Seattle, <a href="West%20Seattle%2C%20Seattle">West Seattle</a>, and various locations in southern King County.

Tukwila International Boulevard station is located on South 154th Street (Southcenter Boulevard) at the intersection of <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20518">State Routes 518</a> and <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%2099">99</a> (International Boulevard) in southern Tukwila. The highway junction is approximately north of <a href="Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma%20International%20Airport">Seattle–Tacoma International Airport</a> and serves as its main entrance; it is also adjacent to the airport's consolidated <a href="rental%20car">rental car</a> facility and parking lots. The station is west of the <a href="Westfield%20Southcenter">Westfield Southcenter Mall</a>, a major regional shopping center, and is connected to it via the <a href="RapidRide%20F%20Line">RapidRide F Line</a>. To the north of the station area is Tukwila's commercial district, which includes businesses that specialize in goods and cuisine that draw from the city's ethnically-diverse population.

The Tukwila International Boulevard station area consists primarily of <a href="single-family%20home">single-family home</a>s, with some <a href="multi-family%20residential">multi-family residential</a> and commercial buildings along International Boulevard and Southcenter Boulevard. In 2013, the <a href="Puget%20Sound%20Regional%20Council">Puget Sound Regional Council</a> (PSRC) counted a population of 4,155 residents in 2,332 housing units within a half-mile () radius of the station, of which 95 percent were considered <a href="affordable%20housing">affordable</a>. The <a href="King%20County%20Housing%20Authority">King County Housing Authority</a> purchased 286 apartments in a building near Tukwila International Boulevard station in 2015 to preserve their affordable rates for low-income households. The PSRC describes the area as one dominated by <a href="auto-oriented%20development">auto-oriented development</a> leading to "poor pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure that impedes walkability".

The area surrounding the station is split between the cities of <a href="SeaTac%2C%20Washington">SeaTac</a> and Tukwila by International Boulevard, leading to two <a href="comprehensive%20planning">comprehensive plans</a> for <a href="transit-oriented%20development">transit-oriented development</a> near the station. SeaTac adopted a redevelopment proposal in 2006 for of land west of International Boulevard, with the goal of bringing an additional 2,600 people daily to the area by 2020 via <a href="mixed-use%20development">mixed-use development</a>. The city of Tukwila adopted an <a href="urban%20renewal">urban renewal</a> plan in 1998 and an updated comprehensive plan in 2015, both recommending improved commercial access and additional residential units around the station and on International Boulevard. A <a href="Spokane%2C%20Washington">Spokane</a>-based developer plans to build 665 housing units on a site northwest of the station, including 385 <a href="affordable%20housing">affordable housing</a> units; the development plan, however, displaces a number of immigrant-owned businesses at the SeaTac Market.

The earliest proposal for a light rail station near Tukwila came from the <a href="Puget%20Sound%20Council%20of%20Governments">Puget Sound Council of Governments</a> in 1986, as part of a north–south line from <a href="Lynnwood%2C%20Washington">Lynnwood</a> to <a href="Federal%20Way%2C%20Washington">Federal Way</a>. The station would have been on State Route 518 northwest of the <a href="Southcenter%20Mall">Southcenter Mall</a>, between stations at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport and on Interurban Avenue. A regional <a href="transit%20authority">transit authority</a> (RTA) was formed in the early 1990s to study a regional light rail system, presenting a $6.7 billion plan on the March 1995 ballot. The plan included an <a href="at-grade">at-grade</a> light rail line on Pacific Highway (State Route 99; later International Boulevard), with stops at South 144th and 158th streets in Tukwila. The proposal was opposed by the Tukwila City Council and rejected by voters, and as a result, the RTA placed a smaller proposal on the following year's ballot. The second proposal, called "Sound Move", selected a station near South 158th Street in Tukwila and was approved by voters in November 1996.

The RTA, by then renamed to <a href="Sound%20Transit">Sound Transit</a>, began a series of <a href="public%20hearing">public hearing</a>s in late 1997 to determine the routing of the line. Tukwila leaders preferred a route serving the Southcenter Mall that would add six to seven minutes of travel time and $150 million in project costs. The Sound Transit Board chose an at-grade line on International Boulevard as their preferred routing in February 1999, which the city argued would interfere with their near-term plans to revamp the street. The board's preferred route, selected in November 1999, included an at-grade line on International Boulevard through Tukwila and an elevated station at South 154th Street with a <a href="park%20and%20ride">park and ride</a> facility.

Several weeks before the November 1999 decision, Tukwila proposed an alternate alignment using <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20599">State Route 599</a>, <a href="Interstate%205%20%28Washington%29">Interstate 5</a>, and State Route 518. The proposal, known as the "Tukwila Freeway Route", removed light rail from International Boulevard and served a station at South 154th Street, but was criticized by business owners for not serving the city's urban center at Southcenter Mall. The proposal was too late to be examined in the initial <a href="environmental%20impact%20statement">environmental impact statement</a> in November 1999, but a formal environmental review of the suggested route was initiated in May 2000, and on February 8, 2001, it was adopted by the Sound Transit Board as the preferred route for the <a href="Central%20Link">Central Link</a> light rail project. Budgetary problems with the project led to the shortening of the line in late 2001, terminating at the South 154th Street park and ride instead of Seattle–Tacoma International Airport.

In June 2002, the Tukwila City Council rejected a memorandum of agreement with Sound Transit that would have expedited processing of light rail permits issued by the city. Although the city council supported the Tukwila Freeway Route in 2001, the lack of service to Southcenter drove the rejection despite lobbying from elected officials in other cities. Despite fears that Tukwila's decision would jeopardize federal funding for the project, Sound Transit was granted its application for a $500 million commitment from the <a href="Federal%20Transit%20Administration">Federal Transit Administration</a> (FTA) later that month. The city council approved expedited permitting in 2004 after requesting Sound Transit increase the parking capacity at the future South 154th Street station and park and ride to 600 stalls, at an additional cost of $5 million.
The station was officially named Tukwila International Boulevard in January 2005, and in March <a href="PCL%20Construction">PCL</a> was awarded the $231.7 million contract for building the station and of elevated guideway between Tukwila and <a href="Rainier%20Beach%20station">Rainier Beach station</a>. Site clearing at the future station, which was previously an <a href="airport%20parking">airport parking</a> lot operated by Ajax, began the following month. By late November, the first elevated guideway segment was completed and column erection at the station was near completion. The <a href="mezzanine">mezzanine</a> and the main structural elements of the station were completed between late 2005 and early 2007. The station and segment through Tukwila were declared substantially complete by PCL Construction in March 2008 and all major work at the station was finished by late June.

The station and its 600-space park and ride opened on July 18, 2009, the first day of Central Link service, and served as the line's interim southern terminus. The following week, a shuttle bus service to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport began operating from the station every ten to fifteen minutes to the airport's main terminal. The shuttle service was discontinued when <a href="SeaTac/Airport%20station">SeaTac/Airport station</a> opened on December 19, 2009, replacing Tukwila as the new southern terminus of the line.

The station consists of two <a href="side%20platform">side platform</a>s, elevated above ground level, and a mezzanine with <a href="ticket%20vending%20machine">ticket vending machine</a>s and rider information. The two levels are connected to each other and street level by a series of escalators, stairs, and elevators. Designed by David Hewitt and his Seattle-based <a href="architecture%20firm">architecture firm</a>, the station includes elements meant to evoke "airplanes and liftoff", including an angular roof that is shaped like the wings of an airplane. At platform level, the station features large glass windows with views of Tukwila, <a href="Mount%20Baker">Mount Baker</a>, and the Sea-Tac <a href="airport%20control%20tower">airport control tower</a>. Below the platform and mezzanine levels is a <a href="bus%20station">bus station</a> and passenger drop-off area.

The station also includes a 600-stall <a href="park%20and%20ride">park and ride</a> lot next to the bus station and an auxiliary lot located across Southcenter Boulevard. The park and ride, initially the only facility on Central Link, would regularly fill before 9:00 a.m. by 2013, leading to complaints and commuters parking on nearby residential streets. An additional 62 parking spaces were added in November 2013, through a lease from a private garage owned by the City of SeaTac. The opening of the University Link in 2016 worsened the parking issue, leaving the lot filled by 6:40 a.m. Sound Transit began a permit parking trial in September 2016 that reserves spaces for registered <a href="carpool">carpool</a> vehicles for a monthly fee of $5, in an effort to alleviate the parking problems at the station. A second park and ride opened at <a href="Angle%20Lake%20station">Angle Lake station</a> in September 2016, which was expected to relieve the Tukwila lot, but demand remained the same while Angle Lake's lot filled with new commuters. Sound Transit also offers a <a href="bicycle%20parking%20station">bicycle parking station</a> with eight secured spots, as well as <a href="bicycle%20parking%20rack">racks</a> for temporary use.

The station is represented on maps and signage by a <a href="pictogram">pictogram</a> of a <a href="canoe">canoe</a>, inspired by the city's history as a transportation hub at the intersection of three rivers. It was created by Christian French as part of the "Stellar Connections" series. Its points represent nearby destinations, including Tukwila City Hall, <a href="Fort%20Dent">Fort Dent</a> Park, <a href="Foster%20High%20School%20%28Tukwila%2C%20Washington%29">Foster High School</a> and several community parks.

The station houses four <a href="art%20installation">art installation</a>s: three works by sculptor Tad Savinar, and one by Clark Wiegman. They were funded by the "STart" program, which allocates a percentage of project construction funds to art projects to be used in stations. Savinar's "A Drop of Sustenance", suspended above the escalators to the northbound platform, features a large <a href="raindrop">raindrop</a> that represents the "living water" used for sustenance by the region's plants and animals; "<a href="The%20Seattle%20Times">The Seattle Times</a>" called it a witty, "regionally apt <a href="pop-art">pop-art</a> image". Savinar also created "A Molecule of the Region" on the southbound entry, featuring memories and sayings about Tukwila from residents arranged in a <a href="ball-and-stick%20model">ball-and-stick</a> molecular model, and "Voices of Tukwila", with more quotes from residents etched into tiles on the platform.

At ground level is "Soundings" by Wiegman, an <a href="abstract%20art">abstract</a> representation of two halves of a <a href="hazelnut">hazelnut</a>. One of the halves includes a handle etched with the path of the <a href="Duwamish%20River">Duwamish River</a> through Tukwila, carved in an illuminated, blue ribbon. The piece, which also features <a href="ambient%20noise">ambient noise</a>, was inspired by the <a href="Chinook%20Jargon">Chinook Jargon</a> name for Tukwila, k'ap'uxac (translated to "place of hazelnuts").

Tukwila International Boulevard station is part of Sound Transit's Link light rail line, which runs from Seattle–Tacoma International Airport north through the <a href="Rainier%20Valley%2C%20Seattle">Rainier Valley</a> and <a href="Downtown%20Seattle">Downtown Seattle</a> to the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a>. It is the second northbound station from <a href="Angle%20Lake%20station">Angle Lake station</a> and fourteenth southbound station from <a href="University%20of%20Washington%20station">University of Washington station</a>, situated between SeaTac/Airport and Rainier Beach stations. Trains serve Tukwila International Boulevard station twenty hours a day on weekdays and Saturdays, from 5:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m., and eighteen hours on Sundays, from 6:00 a.m. to midnight. During regular weekday service, trains operate roughly every six minutes during <a href="rush%20hour">rush hour</a> and ten minutes at midday. Trains have longer <a href="headway">headway</a>s at off-peak times—fifteen minutes in the early morning and twenty minutes at night on weekdays, and every ten to fifteen minutes during weekends. The station is approximately three minutes from SeaTac/Airport station and 35 minutes from <a href="Westlake%20station%20%28Sound%20Transit%29">Westlake station</a> in Downtown Seattle. In 2017, an average of 2,899 passengers boarded Link trains at Tukwila International Boulevard station on weekdays.

The station is also served by several <a href="King%20County%20Metro">King County Metro</a> bus routes that use a plaza-level bus station under the Link platforms. The three-bay station opened on September 19, 2009, and includes a public <a href="restroom">restroom</a> and <a href="passenger%20information%20system">real-time arrival screens</a>. The <a href="RapidRide%20A%20Line">RapidRide A Line</a> terminates at the station and travels south along State Route 99 through SeaTac, the <a href="Highline%20College">Highline College</a> area and the city of Federal Way, ending at <a href="Federal%20Way%20Transit%20Center">Federal Way Transit Center</a>. The <a href="RapidRide%20F%20Line">RapidRide F Line</a> passes through the station on its route between <a href="Burien%2C%20Washington">Burien</a>, Southcenter Mall, the <a href="Tukwila%20station">Tukwila commuter rail station</a>, and <a href="Renton%2C%20Washington">Renton</a>. Route 124 terminates at the station and travels north through Tukwila, <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Seattle">Georgetown</a> and <a href="SoDo%2C%20Seattle">SoDo</a> to Downtown Seattle. Finally, route 128 connects the station to <a href="West%20Seattle%2C%20Seattle">West Seattle</a>, <a href="White%20Center%2C%20Washington">White Center</a> and Southcenter.

Hydnellum peckii

Hydnellum peckii is an inedible (though not toxic) <a href="fungus">fungus</a>, and a member of the genus "<a href="Hydnellum">Hydnellum</a>" of the family <a href="Bankeraceae">Bankeraceae</a>. It is a <a href="hydnoid%20fungi">hydnoid</a> species, producing <a href="spore">spore</a>s on the surface of vertical spines or tooth-like projections that hang from the undersurface of the <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a>. It is found in North America, Europe, and was recently discovered in Iran (2008) and Korea (2010). "Hydnellum peckii" is a <a href="mycorrhizae">mycorrhizal</a> species, and forms <a href="mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutually beneficial</a> relationships with a variety of <a href="coniferous">coniferous</a> trees, growing on the ground singly, scattered, or in fused masses.

The fruit bodies typically have a funnel-shaped <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> with a white edge, although the shape can be highly variable. Young, moist fruit bodies can "bleed" bright red <a href="guttation">guttation</a> droplets that contains a <a href="pigment">pigment</a> known to have <a href="anticoagulant">anticoagulant</a> properties similar to <a href="heparin">heparin</a>. The unusual appearance of the young fruit bodies has earned the species several descriptive <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s, including strawberries and cream, the bleeding Hydnellum, the bleeding tooth fungus, the red-juice tooth, and the Devil's tooth. Although "Hydnellum peckii" fruit bodies are readily identifiable when young, they become brown and nondescript when they age.

The species was first <a href="species%20description">described scientifically</a> by American mycologist <a href="Howard%20James%20Banker">Howard James Banker</a> in 1913. Italian <a href="Pier%20Andrea%20Saccardo">Pier Andrea Saccardo</a> placed the species in the genus "<a href="Hydnum">Hydnum</a>" in 1925, while <a href="Walter%20Henry%20Snell">Walter Henry Snell</a> and <a href="Esther%20Amelia%20Dick">Esther Amelia Dick</a> placed it in "Calodon" in 1956; "Hydnum peckii" (Banker) Sacc. and "Calodon peckii" Snell & E.A. Dick are <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonyms</a> of "Hydnellum peckii".

The fungus is classified in the stirps (species thought to be descendants of a common ancestor) "Diabolum" of the genus "Hydnellum", a grouping of similar species with the following shared characteristics: <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> that is marked with concentric lines that form alternating pale and darker zones (<a href="wikt%3Azonate">zonate</a>); an extremely peppery taste; a sweetish odor; spores that are <a href="wikt%3Aellipsoid">ellipsoid</a>, and not <a href="Amyloid%20%28mycology%29">amyloid</a> (that is, not absorbing <a href="iodine">iodine</a> when <a href="Chemical%20tests%20in%20mushroom%20identification">stained</a> with <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>), acyanophilous (not staining with the reagent <a href="methyl%20blue">Cotton Blue</a>), and covered with tubercules; the presence of <a href="clamp%20connection">clamp connection</a>s in the <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e. <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular analysis</a> based on the sequences of the <a href="internal%20transcribed%20spacer">internal transcribed spacer</a> DNA of several "Hydnellum" species placed "H. peckii" as most closely related to "<a href="Hydnellum%20ferrugineum">H. ferrugineum</a>" and "<a href="Hydnellum%20spongiosipes">H. spongiosipes</a>".

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific eponym</a> honors mycologist <a href="Charles%20Horton%20Peck">Charles Horton Peck</a>. The fungus is known in the <a href="common%20name">vernacular</a> by several names, including "strawberries and cream", the "bleeding Hydnellum", the "red-juice tooth", "Peck's hydnum", the "bleeding tooth fungus", and the "devil's tooth".

As in all mushroom-producing fungi, the <a href="sporocarp%20%28fungi%29">fruit bodies (sporocarps)</a> are the reproductive structures that are produced from fungal <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a> when the appropriate environmental conditions of temperature, humidity and nutrient availability are met. "Hydnellum peckii" is a <a href="stipitate%20hydnoid%20fungus">stipitate hydnoid fungus</a>, meaning that it has a <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> atop a <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> (stem), and a form resembling a "<a href="Hydnum">Hydnum</a>"—characterized by a teeth-like <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>, rather than <a href="lamellae%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> or pores on the underside of the cap. Fruit bodies growing closely together often appear to fuse together (this is called "confluence"). They can reach a height of up to . Fresh fruit bodies exude a striking, thick red fluid when they are moist.

The cap's surface is convex to flattened, more or less uneven and sometimes slightly depressed in the center. It is usually densely covered with "hairs" that give it a texture similar to felt or velvet; these hairs are sloughed off in age, leaving the caps of mature specimens smooth. Its shape varies from somewhat round to irregular, , or even as much as wide as a result of confluence. The cap is initially whitish, but later turns slightly brownish, with irregular dark-brown to nearly black blotches where it is bruised. In maturity, the surface is fibrous and tough, scaly and jagged, grayish brown in the upper part of the cap, and somewhat woody. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is a pale pinkish brown.

The spines are slender, cylindrical and tapering (<a href="wiktionary%3Aterete">terete</a>), less than long, and become shorter closer to the cap edge. They are crowded together, with typically between three and five teeth per square millimeter. Pinkish white initially, they age to a grayish brown. The stem is thick, very short, and often deformed. It becomes bulbous where it penetrates the ground, and may root into the soil for several centimeters. Although it may reach up to in total length, and is wide, only about appear above ground. The upper part is covered with the same teeth found on the underside of the cap, whereas the lower part is hairy and often encases debris from the forest floor. The odor of the fruit body has been described as "mild to disagreeable", or, as Banker suggested in his original description, similar to <a href="hickory">hickory</a> nuts.

In <a href="spore%20print">deposit</a>, the <a href="basidiospore">spores</a> appear brown. Viewing them with a <a href="Light%20microscopy%23Optical%20microscopy">light microscope</a> reveals finer details of their structure: they are roughly spherical but end abruptly in a small point, their surfaces are covered with small, wart-like nodules, and their size is between 5.0–5.3 by 4.0–4.7 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>. The spores are <a href="inamyloid">inamyloid</a>, meaning they do not absorb <a href="iodine">iodine</a> when <a href="Chemical%20tests%20in%20mushroom%20identification">stained</a> with <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>.

"Hydnellum peckii"'s cells (the <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e) also present various characters useful for its characterization. The hyphae that form the cap are <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent), smooth, thin-walled, and 3–4 µm thick. They collapse when dry, but may be readily revived with a weak (2%) solution of <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a>. Those in the cap form an intricate tangle with a tendency to run longitudinally. They are divided into cellular compartments (<a href="septum">septa</a>) and have <a href="clamp%20connection">clamp connection</a>s—short branches connecting one cell to the previous cell to allow passage of the products of nuclear division. The <a href="basidia">basidia</a>, the spore-bearing cells in the hymenium, are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 35–40 by 4.7–6 µm.

"<a href="Hydnellum%20diabolus">Hydnellum diabolus</a>" (the species epithet is given the neuter "diabolum" in some publications) has a very similar appearance, so much so that some consider it and "H. peckii" to be synonymous; "H. diabolus" is said to have a sweetish pungent odor that is lacking in "H. peckii". The differences between the two species are amplified in mature specimens: "H. diabolus" has an irregularly thickened stem, while the stem of "H. peckii" is thickened by a "definite spongy layer". Additionally, old specimens of "H. peckii" have a smooth cap, while "H. diabolus" is <a href="tomentose">tomentose</a>. The related species "<a href="Hydnellum%20pineticola">H. pineticola</a>" also exudes pink droplets of liquid when young and moist. Commonly found growing under conifers in northeastern North America, "H. pineticola" tastes "unpleasant", but not acrid. Fruit bodies tend to grow singly, rather than in fused clusters, and, unlike "H. peckii", they do not have bulbous stems.

"Hydnellum peckii" is a <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l fungus, and as such establishes a <a href="Mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualistic</a> relationship with the roots of certain trees (referred to as "hosts"), in which the fungus exchanges <a href="mineral">mineral</a>s and <a href="amino%20acids">amino acids</a> extracted from the soil for <a href="Carbon%20fixation">fixed carbon</a> from the host. The subterranean hyphae of the fungus grow a sheath of tissue around the <a href="wikt%3Arootlet">rootlets</a> of a broad range of tree species, in an intimate association that is especially beneficial to the host (termed ectomycorrhizal), as the fungus produces <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s that <a href="Mineralization%20%28biology%29">mineralize</a> organic compounds and facilitate the transfer of nutrients to the tree.

The ectomycorrhizal structures of "H. peckii" are among a few in the <a href="Bankeraceae">Bankeraceae</a> that have been studied in detail. They are characterized by a plectenchymatous mantle—a layer of tissue made of hyphae tightly arranged in a parallel orientation, or palisade, and which rarely branch or overlap each other. These hyphae, along with adhering mineral soil particles, are embedded in a gelatinous matrix. The hyphae of the ectomycorrhizae can become <a href="chlamydospore">chlamydospore</a>s, an adaptation that helps the fungus tolerate unfavorable conditions. Chlamydospores of "H. peckii" have a peculiar structure—markedly distinct from those of other Bankeraceae—with thick, smooth inner walls and an outer wall that is split radially into warts. The most striking characteristic of the ectomycorrhizae as a whole is the way the black outer layers of older sections are shed, giving a "carbonized appearance". The majority of the underground biomass of the fungus is concentrated near the surface, most likely as "mycelial mats"—dense clusters of ectomycorrhizae and mycelium. The mycelium is also known to extend far beyond the site of the fruit bodies, as far as away.

<a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular</a> techniques have been developed to help with conservation efforts of stipitate hydnoid fungi, including "H. peckii". While the distribution of the fungus has traditionally been determined by counting the fruit bodies, this method has a major drawback in that fruit bodies are not produced consistently every year, and the absence of fruit bodies is not an indication of the absence of its mycelium in the soil. More modern techniques using the <a href="polymerase%20chain%20reaction">polymerase chain reaction</a> to assess the presence of the fungal <a href="DNA">DNA</a> in the soil have helped alleviate the issues in monitoring the presence and distribution of fungi mycelia.

The fruit bodies of "Hydnellum peckii" are found growing solitary, scattered, or clustered together on the ground under <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s, often among mosses and pine needle litter. "H. peckii" is a "late-stage" fungus that, in boreal forests dominated by <a href="jack%20pine">jack pine</a>, typically begins associating with more mature hosts once the <a href="canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> has closed. A preference for <a href="montane">mountainous</a> or <a href="subalpine">subalpine</a> ecosystems has been noted.

The fungus has a wide distribution in North America, and is particularly common in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>; its range extends north to <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and east to <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>. In the <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a> area of the U.S. state of <a href="Washington%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Washington</a>, it is found in association with <a href="Douglas-fir">Douglas-fir</a>, <a href="fir">fir</a>, and <a href="Tsuga">hemlock</a>. Along the <a href="Oregon%20Coast">Oregon Coast</a> it has been collected under <a href="lodgepole%20pine">lodgepole pine</a>. In addition to North America, the mushroom is widespread in Europe, and its presence has been documented in Italy, Germany, and Scotland. The species is common in the latter location, but becoming increasingly rare in several European countries, such as Norway, The Netherlands, and the Czech Republic. Increased pollution in central Europe has been suggested as one possible factor in the mushroom's decline there. Reports from Iran in 2008 and Korea in 2010 were the first outside Europe and North America.

Although the fruit bodies of "H. peckii" have been described as resembling "Danish pastry topped with strawberry jam", and "Hydnellum" species in general are not known to be <a href="mushroom%20poisoning">poisonous</a>, they are inedible due to their extremely bitter taste. This acridity persists even in dried specimens.

The fruit bodies of this and other "Hydnellum" species are prized by <a href="mushroom%20dye">mushroom dye</a>rs. The colors may range from beige when no <a href="mordant">mordant</a> is used, to various shades of blue or green depending on the mordant added.

Screening of an extract of "Hydnellum peckii" revealed the presence of an effective <a href="anticoagulant">anticoagulant</a>, named <a href="atromentin">atromentin</a> (2,5-dihydroxy-3,6-bis(4-<a href="phenol">hydroxyphenyl</a>)-<a href="1%2C4-Benzoquinone">1,4-benzoquinone</a>), and similar in <a href="biological%20activity">biological activity</a> to the well-known anticoagulant <a href="heparin">heparin</a>. Atromentin also possesses antibacterial activity, inhibiting the enzyme <a href="enoyl-acyl%20carrier%20protein%20reductase">enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase</a> (essential for the <a href="Fatty%20acid%20metabolism%23Synthesis">biosynthesis</a> of <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s) in the bacteria "<a href="Streptococcus%20pneumoniae">Streptococcus pneumoniae</a>".

"Hydnellum peckii" can <a href="bioaccumulation">bioaccumulate</a> the heavy metal <a href="caesium">caesium</a>. In one Swedish <a href="field%20study">field study</a>, as much as 9% of the total caesium of the topmost of soil was found in the fungal mycelium. In general, ectomycorrhizal fungi, which grow most prolifically in the upper organic horizons of the soil or at the interface between the organic and mineral layers, are involved in the retention and cycling of <a href="caesium-137">caesium-137</a> in organic-rich forest soils.

Drowned God

Drowned God: Conspiracy of the Ages is a <a href="1996%20in%20video%20gaming">1996</a> <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a> developed by Epic Multimedia Group and published by <a href="Inscape%20%28publisher%29">Inscape</a>. The game propounds the <a href="conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy theory</a> that all of <a href="human%20history">human history</a> is a lie and that the human race's development and evolution were <a href="Ancient%20astronauts">aided</a> by <a href="extraterrestrial%20life">extraterrestrials</a>. The player attempts to uncover the truth through the course of the game by traveling to a variety of different worlds, interacting with historical and fictional characters, and solving puzzles.

"Drowned God" is based on a forged manuscript written by <a href="Harry%20Horse">Harry Horse</a> in 1983, purported to have been written by 19th-century poet <a href="Richard%20Henry%20Horne">Richard Henry Horne</a>, who shares Horse's name. After facing legal trouble and fines when he attempted to sell the text, Horse shelved it until playing "<a href="Myst">Myst</a>" and "<a href="7th%20Guest">7th Guest</a>" in the mid-1990s, whereupon he decided a <a href="first%20person%20video%20game">first person</a> adventure game would be the best way to tell the manuscript's story.

Producer <a href="Algy%20Williams">Algy Williams</a> hired a team of multimedia artists and programmers to help Horse develop "Drowned God". Upon its release, the game sold well, but it quickly faded in popularity due to <a href="software%20bug">bugs</a> and a lack of <a href="patch%20%28computing%29">patches</a>. "Drowned God"s concept and visuals were widely praised, while its gameplay, audio, and puzzles received more varied responses. A planned sequel never came to fruition.

"Drowned God"'s concept centers around the idea that human history has been manipulated to cover up certain facts. The true history, according to the game, is that aliens from the <a href="Orion%20%28constellation%29">Orion</a> area of space seeded humanity on Earth thousands of years ago and have since guided its development. An ancient, highly developed civilization was lost millennia ago in the <a href="Great%20Flood">Great Flood</a>. The library of Alexandria housed much of what game writer <a href="Harry%20Horse">Harry Horse</a> called "forbidden knowledge" before it was destroyed; the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Knights Templar</a>, whose membership included luminaries such as <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> and <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a>, preserved the information for centuries. In the 20th century, the <a href="Philadelphia%20Experiment">Philadelphia Experiment</a> opened a gateway into another dimension, first freeing the aliens Horse refers to as "the Legion", and an independent government group spent the subsequent decades in contact with the aliens following the <a href="Roswell%20UFO%20incident">Roswell UFO incident</a>.

The game's plot begins in a chamber containing the Bequest Globe, a device which the player has recently inherited. The Globe is a giant brass cylinder full of gears, fronted by a clock face made of sliding and rotating plates comprising twenty-two Roman numerals, which represent the <a href="Major%20Arcana">Major Arcana</a>, with the Jewish <a href="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a> in its center. A voice welcomes the player and tells them the Globe is a gift, then explains that the player must unlock the secret of the drowned god.

The player initially must enter their name into the device, which then displays a series of past lives the player has lived. The name is converted into its <a href="numerology">numerological</a> equivalent. Above and below the central chamber are two other areas, called <a href="Kether">Kether</a> and <a href="Malchut">Malchut</a> respectively, each of which houses a display screen with a mask-like face that provides the player with information about the next task. The motivations of the two organizations represented by the faces are murky, although it becomes clear they are acting in opposition to each other. Both masks refer to the player by their assigned number.

The player must enter four different worlds through the Bequest Globe, each of which is an amalgamation of historical and fantastical elements and is named after one of the <a href="sephirot">sephirot</a> on the <a href="Tree%20of%20Life%20%28Kabbalah%29">kabbalistic Tree of Life</a>. The player seeks to recover four lost artifacts: the Rod of <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a>, the <a href="Holy%20Grail">Holy Grail</a>, the <a href="Philosopher%27s%20Stone">Philosopher's Stone</a>, and the <a href="Ark%20of%20the%20Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a>. According to Horse, "The relics you're searching for are not what you think they are". The first world, <a href="Binah%20%28Kabbalah%29">Binah</a>, includes aspects of <a href="King%20Arthur">Arthurian legend</a>, including <a href="Morgan%20Le%20Fey">Morgan Le Fey</a> and the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Knights Templar</a>, as well as <a href="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>. The second, <a href="Chesed">Chesed</a>, features <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a> ruins and a <a href="submarine">submarine</a> interior. The third, <a href="Din%20%28Kabbalah%29">Din</a>, centers around an underground <a href="transit%20system">transit system</a>, a <a href="steampunk">steampunk</a> <a href="carnival">carnival</a>, and a mechanical <a href="maze">maze</a>. The final world, <a href="Chokhmah%20%28Kabbalah%29">Chokmah</a>, takes place outside <a href="Area%2051">Area 51</a>.

Throughout the game, the player finds and uses <a href="Tarot">Tarot</a> cards to unlock new areas and gain more information about the true history of the world. Upon returning to the Bequest Globe between worlds, the player sees the Roman numerals in its display light up in relation to the cards that have been recovered. After recovering three of the lost artifacts, the player fails to recover the last one, the Ark of the Covenant, which takes the form of a <a href="nuclear%20warhead">nuclear warhead</a>. The player is able to choose one of three endings, depending on whether they decide to enter a final doorway in the chambers of one of the two opposing factions represented by Kether and Malchut, or enter a new central chamber via the Bequest Globe.

Choosing either of the two doors results in an ending in which the player is trapped in a <a href="dystopia">dystopia</a>n world: either Kether's, a technological police state, or Malchut's, a society of forced genetic manipulation. Both have ominous <a href="men%20in%20black">men in black</a> overseeing the proceedings. If the player instead chooses to open the central chamber, a scene with a group of <a href="grey%20alien">grey alien</a>s approaching is briefly shown, wherein they say, "We are coming, for we are Legion." All three options lead to the same ending credits, which feature a voice-over describing the <a href="Osiris%20myth">murder of Osiris</a>.

"Drowned God" uses a <a href="point-and-click">point-and-click</a> interface and <a href="first%20person%20perspective">first person perspective</a> typical of games similar to "<a href="Myst">Myst</a>" of the mid- to late-1990s. The player navigates and interacts with the game world by clicking the mouse on different parts of the screen. The mouse cursor changes shape depending on the action clicking will perform: an arrow for moving to another location, a face with an arrow to pick up or place Tarot cards, and an <a href="Eye%20of%20Providence">Eye of Providence</a> for activating or interacting with objects in the environment. Frequent <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s provide background information and advance the storyline.

The game is filled with a variety of puzzles that must be solved to advance the story. These include memory games and mazes. Others involve competing against a computer-controlled opponent, completing a sequence in a limited number of moves, operating mechanisms, or using an inventory item. Puzzles do not all have to be completed in a precise order; there is some flexibility in terms of being able to move through game areas and work on different challenges.

One of the best received puzzles in the game involves arranging the pieces of a dialogue between the sculpted heads of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. The player listens to the randomly ordered statements made by each head, then decides how to chronologically arrange the statements to form a coherent conversation based on context.

<a href="Harry%20Horse">Harry Horse</a> conceived the game's ancient planetwide conspiracy. Horse had previously written several children's books and received the <a href="Scottish%20Arts%20Council">Scottish Arts Council</a> Writer of the Year award for his 1983 book "The Ogopogo: My Journey with the Loch Ness Monster". He began forging documents that same year as a way to earn money. The story which became the basis for "Drowned God" was originally a phony manuscript Horse wrote in 1983, ostensibly describing events after the destruction of the lost city of <a href="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>. The manuscript, dated 1846, was said to have been written by the English poet <a href="Richard%20Henry%20Horne">Richard Horne</a>, who shares Horse's birth name. Horse's initiation into the concept of an alternate history came in the early 1980s, when he first encountered professor Ian Halpke, who explained to him that information from the Kabbalah and ancient Jewish texts "hide and <a href="cipher">encipher</a> the secret", namely, human evolution was aided by extraterrestrial intelligence. According to Horse, Halpke believed the <a href="Ark%20of%20the%20Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a> was a nuclear device, and that humans and pigs share compatible <a href="genome">genes</a>.

Initially, experts determined the manuscript was genuine, as the date Horse picked matched the time period Horne had been alive and active, and the manuscript's topics matched the poet's interests. Horse had written the manuscript without knowing any of these details. After his hoax was discovered, Horse held onto the text for the next decade, until he played "<a href="Myst">Myst</a>" and "<a href="7th%20Guest">7th Guest</a>" and decided the point-and-click adventure genre was a good match for his <a href="conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy theory</a>-inspired ideas. He later said that while the story of "Myst" did not interest him, the game's artwork and the sense of immersion inspired him to immediately begin working on "Drowned God" in 1994.

The game was originally commissioned by a division of <a href="Time%20Warner">Time Warner</a> and was later taken over by Inscape when that division closed. Horse worked with Inigo Orduna and Anthony McGaw for six months designing the game, then cooperated with the game's artists and modelers until the project's completion. The game's producer, Algy Williams, hired puzzle expert <a href="Chris%20Maslanka">Chris Maslanka</a>, whose output he called "fiendishly difficult", to design the game's puzzles together with John Morris. Williams also employed sculptor Greg Boulton, who had previously worked on the <a href="Peter%20Gabriel">Peter Gabriel</a> video "<a href="Sledgehammer%20%28Peter%20Gabriel%20song%29">Sledgehammer</a>". "Drowned God" music was written and performed by an <a href="ambient%20music">ambient music</a> duo operating under the name Miasma. <a href="William%20S.%20Burroughs">William S. Burroughs</a> was originally scheduled to narrate the game, but died just before he could begin recording. McGaw and Williams later founded the company Babel Media, which specializes in <a href="Game%20localization">video game localization</a>.

"Drowned God" was released on October 31, 1996 for the <a href="Windows%2095">Windows 95</a> operating system. In its first two weeks, it sold 34,000 copies in the United States. It was one of the top ten best-selling video games in United States during the first month after its release, but bugs and poor support from the developers caused it to fall out of favor with gamers by December. By February 1998, the game had sold over 60,000 copies. Around the time of the game's release, Horse stated that its story was incomplete, and that the rest of the story would be revealed in a sequel called "CULT", planned to center around Area 51. However, he killed himself, as well as his wife and pets, a decade after the game's release, and no sequel was ever completed.

"Drowned God" received mixed reviews, with many critics complimenting the game's ideas and imagery while giving a less favorable response to its audio, puzzles, and execution. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> reviewer Vince Broady wrote that the game sounded very promising, and might "also raise awareness of the thread of deception that runs throughout recorded history." Steve Ramsey of "Quandary" said "Drowned God" presented its massive assortment of conspiracy theories entertainingly. Ray Ivey of <a href="Just%20Adventure">Just Adventure</a> called "Drowned God" "the strangest, creepiest, most psychedelic adventure game I've yet to come across." Although Ivey did not understand much of the game, he found it enjoyable, because "it made sense to the game's characters and creators."

T. Liam McDonald of "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" wrote that he was "fascinated by the strong sense of style and the intellectual approach to terrific subject matter". Steven Levy and Patricia King of "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" found the game to be "richly detailed and original". In 2012, Andy Hughes of <a href="Topless%20Robot">Topless Robot</a> put the game at the top of his list of "9 Surprising Literary References In Videogames". Hughes wrote that the game was one that could be played from start to finish "without having any idea what the hell's going on", noting its references to a wide variety of subjects, including <a href="Egyptian%20mythology">Egyptian mythology</a>, "", and the <a href="Bermuda%20Triangle">Bermuda Triangle</a>.

Broady complimented the graphics, writing, ""Drowned God" is loaded with freaky animations and unexpected visual twists". Ramsey praised the visuals and the audio, saying both contributed to the game's "shadowy and secretive feelings". His one significant criticism was that dialogue was difficult to hear, with no option to display text for it. Regarding the game's audio aspect, Broady said, "The soundtrack is less impressive, primarily because of overuse: The background effects drone on mercilessly, and many of the game's narratives (which are universally well-written and finely acted) must be listened to over and over again."

The puzzles, according to Broady, were of uneven quality. He called some "hopelessly difficult" and others extremely derivative. By contrast, he viewed the <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> and <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> dialogue puzzle as "brilliant", but said, "Ideas as original as Horse's call for puzzles to match, not rehashes of things we've seen far too many times already." Ramsey thought the puzzles were challenging but not overly difficult, arguing "on almost every occasion I felt that I was making progress, and I never felt bogged down and hopelessly lost." He felt the puzzles were mostly well-integrated, and found those that were not did not detract from his enjoyment. Ivey remarked, "For puzzle lovers, "Drowned God" is a treasure trove. ... This collection of tricky puzzlers are challenging and frequently innovative."

Broady panned the navigation for being confusing, counter-intuitive, and requiring the player to revisit locations multiple times. He concluded his review by saying, "The net effect is that the story—which made this game so intriguing in the first place—is almost totally lost, and that is a shame." GameSpot considered the game one of the most disappointing of 1996 in their annual recap, writing "the great premise is buried like the mysteries of the ages themselves under a mediocre "Myst" clone". Bob Strauss of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" opined that the game tried to be too many things, and quipped, "the result is a game so obscure, you'd be better off perusing something more comprehensible—like the collected works of <a href="Zoroaster">Zoroaster</a>." Mark Reece and Brooke Adams of "<a href="Deseret%20News">Deseret News</a>" also had mixed feelings about the game, calling it both "clever and deep" and "frustrating and difficult". McDonald wrote that he was "frustrated by the lack of good game play." Hughes called the pace of the game and its puzzles both "tedious" and "ponderous", but said it "had ambition out the genetically modified ears."

The editors of <a href="CNET">CNET Gamecenter</a> nominated "Drowned God" for their 1996 "Best Adventure Game" award, which ultimately went to "<a href="The%20Neverhood">The Neverhood</a>". They wrote, "The "<a href="National%20Enquirer">National Enquirer</a>" meets "Myst". For the adventure gamer with a taste for mouse-pounding puzzles—it just didn't get much better than this."

2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl

The 2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl was a <a href="bowl%20game">postseason</a> <a href="college%20football">college football</a> match between the <a href="2006%20Georgia%20Bulldogs%20football%20team">Georgia Bulldogs</a> and the <a href="2006%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team">Virginia Tech Hokies</a> at the <a href="Georgia%20Dome">Georgia Dome</a> in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, Georgia. The University of Georgia represented the <a href="Southeastern%20Conference">Southeastern Conference</a> (SEC) and Virginia Tech represented the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> (ACC) in the competition. The game was the final competition of the <a href="2006%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season">2006 football season</a> for each team and resulted in a 31–24 Georgia victory, even though <a href="spread%20betting">spread bettors</a> favored Virginia Tech to win by three points. In exchange for the right to pick the first ACC team after the <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> selections, bowl representatives paid US$3.25 million to the ACC, while the SEC, whose fifth team was selected, received $2.4 million. The combined $5.65 million payout was the seventh-largest among all college football bowl games, and the fourth-largest non-BCS bowl game payout.

In a game that was expected to be a <a href="American%20football%23Defensive%20unit">defensive</a> struggle, Virginia Tech took a 21–3 lead in the first half. After <a href="halftime">halftime</a>, Georgia answered Tech's first-half success, thanks in part to four second-half <a href="Turnover%20%28football%29">turnovers</a> by Tech <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Sean%20Glennon">Sean Glennon</a>. Virginia Tech's No. 1 ranked defense struggled in the second half, allowing 153 yards (of 200 total) in the final 30 minutes. As time ran out, Georgia held a one-<a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> lead, 31–24, having beaten back a last-second Tech rally. 75,406 people attended the game, making it the 10th consecutive Peach Bowl <a href="sellout">sellout</a>, the largest crowd to ever attend an event at the Georgia Dome, and the third-largest bowl game in terms of attendance for the <a href="2006%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season">2006–2007 season</a>. Each school sold out its allotment of 18,500 tickets quickly. 31,922 people attended the <a href="Chick-fil-A">Chick-fil-A</a> "fan fest" before the game, setting a new attendance record. Virginia Tech's loss brought it to a final 2006 record of 10–3, while Georgia's final-game win earned it a record of 9–4.

Beginning with the 2006 game, the Chick-fil-A Bowl had purchased the right to select the highest-ranked Atlantic Coast Conference team after representatives from the <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> made their selection. According to the official selection rules still used today, the team chosen to represent the ACC must be within one conference victory of the remaining, highest-ranked conference team or be ranked more than five spaces ahead of the ACC team with the best Conference record available in the final BCS Standings.

In choosing the SEC opponent, the Chick-fil-A Bowl selection committee had the right to select the first SEC school after the Bowl Championship Series, <a href="Cotton%20Bowl%20Classic">Cotton Bowl Classic</a>, <a href="Capital%20One%20Bowl">Capital One Bowl</a>, and <a href="Outback%20Bowl">Outback Bowl</a> made their selections. Just as in the ACC, the selection committee could not select an SEC team with two more losses than the highest available team. The bowl earned the right to select these teams via its multimillion-dollar payout system, which guarantees a certain amount of money to the participating conferences. Prior to 2006, the Chick-fil-A Bowl (then known as the Peach Bowl) matched the No. 5 team in the SEC versus the No. 3 team in the ACC. After the bowl increased its payout to $2.8 million per squad, it then was given the second pick from the ACC, with the Gator Bowl dropping to third.

<a href="Leeman%20Bennett">Leeman Bennett</a>, the former head coach of the <a href="Atlanta%20Falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a> and <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>, served as chairman of the selection committee, which had the task of picking the best teams from those made available by the selection criteria set by the two conferences. The committee would have approximately one month to select the two teams that would attract the most people to the game and generate the largest possible television audience. This fact helped eliminate ACC runner-up <a href="2006%20Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football%20team">Georgia Tech</a> from the selection process, as the Yellow Jackets had already played Georgia earlier in the season, thus making a potential Georgia-Georgia Tech showdown less attractive. In addition, that matchup, while attractive to football fans in the Atlanta area (the site of the Chick-fil-A Bowl and home to Georgia Tech), would have less appeal to television viewers outside the Georgia area. Supervising the selection committee was the Chick-fil-A Bowl Executive Committee, which consisted of representatives from various Atlanta businesses and the <a href="Chick-fil-A">Chick-fil-A</a> corporation.

On the morning of December 3, 2006, Chick-fil-A Bowl representatives selected Virginia Tech to represent the ACC in the 2006 <a href="Chick-fil-A%20Bowl">Chick-fil-A Bowl</a>. A few hours later, Georgia was selected as the second half of the matchup. Two days after the selections were announced, the game was declared sold out, the 10th consecutive sellout in the combined history of the Peach and Chick-fil-A Bowls. Georgia and Virginia Tech each were assigned initial allocations of 18,500 tickets for distribution, and following the quick sales of those ticket blocs, each asked for and received additional tickets to distribute.

The game was the third time Virginia Tech and the University of Georgia faced each other on the football field. The two previous games—one in 1931 and the other in 1932—resulted in one loss and one win for each team. Various casinos and betting organizations favored Virginia Tech by 2.5–3 points when setting their <a href="point%20spread">point spread</a>.

Media discussion of the game in the weeks leading up to kickoff centered on the Hokies' No. 1-nationally ranked defense and Georgia's 5th-ranked SEC defense. Most pundits predicted a low-scoring game, and a few predicted an "all-out defensive war". A week before departing for Atlanta, Virginia Tech head coach <a href="Frank%20Beamer">Frank Beamer</a> revealed that Ike Whitaker, Virginia Tech's backup <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a>, would not be attending the game for undisclosed reasons. It was later revealed that Whitaker had been admitted to an alcohol treatment center in <a href="Salem%2C%20Virginia">Salem</a>, Virginia.

For Georgia, discussion centered on the play-calling duties of assistant coach Mike Bobo. Bobo had been named the temporary <a href="offensive%20coordinator">offensive coordinator</a> for the Bulldogs after then-assistant coordinator Neil Calloway had been named the new head coach at the <a href="University%20of%20Alabama-Birmingham">University of Alabama-Birmingham</a>. Calloway would remain with the Bulldogs as the <a href="offensive%20line">offensive line</a> coach during the Chick-fil-A Bowl, but Bobo would take over his role as offensive coordinator for the game. It was only the second time that Bobo performed as a play-caller for the Bulldogs, the previous game having come in Georgia's regular-season closer, a 15–12 win against <a href="Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football">Georgia Tech</a>.

With the fifth-ranked defense in the SEC going up against the number-one ranked scoring defense in the nation, attention centered on the likelihood of a low-scoring defensive struggle. Of particular interest were the two teams' quarterbacks and how they would likely fare against such a tough defense. Georgia struggled on offense for much of the season, resulting in a battle for the starting quarterback position between senior Joe Tereshinski and freshman <a href="Matthew%20Stafford">Matthew Stafford</a>. Though Stafford was eventually given the starting role, he struggled in his first year, completing 126 of 235 passes (53.6%) for 1,620 yards, with six touchdowns and 12 interceptions heading into the Chick-fil-A Bowl. On the opposite side of the field, Virginia Tech would be starting <a href="Redshirt%20%28college%20sports%29">redshirt</a> sophomore Sean Glennon. Named the starting quarterback at the beginning of the 2006 season, Glennon replaced <a href="Marcus%20Vick">Marcus Vick</a>, who had been expelled from Virginia Tech at the end of the previous year. While not as statistically successful as Marcus Vick, Glennon still managed to lead the Hokies to their third consecutive 10-win season, and had the edge over Stafford in terms of experience.

On the ground, it appeared that Virginia Tech had the edge in experience, forcing Georgia's defense to concentrate on stopping Tech's run game. Virginia Tech <a href="running%20back">running back</a> Branden Ore suffered an ankle injury in the Hokies' regular-season game against Wake Forest, but still took the field in the Chick-fil-A Bowl. The same could not be said for Georgia, whose original starting running back, Thomas Brown, suffered a season-ending knee injury in October. Filling his role were two inexperienced players: Kregg Lumpkin and Danny Ware. Making up for this inexperience, the two players were coached by Tony Ball, a former Virginia Tech wide receivers coach with insights into the Tech defense.

With Ore still not fully recovered from his injury and two inexperienced players on the Georgia side, it appeared that the teams' passing offenses would have to take up the slack. Virginia Tech's <a href="Eddie%20Royal">Eddie Royal</a>, with 452 receiving yards, led both teams in receiving yardage coming into the game. Georgia's receiving corps was led by wide receiver <a href="Mohammed%20Massaquoi">Mohammed Massaquoi</a> and tight end Martrez Milner. Massaquoi caught 28 passes for 348 yards and two touchdowns coming into the game, while Milner had 27 receptions for 376 yards and two touchdowns.

Each offense would face tough defense in the air and on the ground. The Virginia Tech defense, led by junior linebackers Vince Hall and Xavier Adibi, was expected to present a challenge for the Georgia offense. "You try to find some kind of mismatch, but it's very difficult to do", Georgia head coach Mark Richt said before kickoff. "That's why they're the best (defense) in the country. Their interior defensive linemen are very, very strong and physical, and, really, everybody else is built for speed. Their edge rushers are tremendous, and their linebackers are outstanding and physical. Their defensive backs can all run and hit. It's going to be a real challenge." Of particular concern for quarterback Matt Stafford were Virginia Tech's <a href="cornerback">cornerback</a>s, whom he would have to go through in order to complete passes to his receivers. "They play kind of a different scheme than a lot of teams so it would be tough if you only had one week to try to prepare for these guys", Stafford said in an interview prior to the game. "They trust their corners a lot, but they've got good ones and can. They lock up a lot of time single receiver side because they've got a good corner down there that plays on the boundary."

Georgia's defense, ranked fifth in the SEC, was no less a concern for Virginia Tech's offense. "Defense is one of the major aspects of the SEC", said Georgia <a href="center%20%28football%29">center</a> Nick Jones before the game. "You face great defenses week in and week out, and we face a great one week in and week out in practice against our defense. We've been up against great defenses and great personnel, so it's nothing new for us." Heading into the game, Georgia was ranked ninth in total defense, giving up only 264 yards per game, and 22nd in scoring defense, allowing an average of just 17.1 points a game.

The 2006 Chick-fil-A bowl kicked off on December 30, 2006 at 8:00 p.m. The game was nationally televised on <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>, with over 5 million households tuning into the game at home, enough to earn ESPN a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">television rating</a> of 4.8 for the broadcast. 75,406 people attended the game in person, making it the 10th consecutive Chick-fil-A Bowl sell-out, the first since the word "Peach" was dropped from the title, the largest crowd ever to attend an event at the <a href="Georgia%20Dome">Georgia Dome</a>, and the third-largest bowl game in terms of attendance for the <a href="2006%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season">2006–2007 season</a>. 31,922 people attended the Chick-fil-A "fan fest" prior to the game, setting a new attendance record. Due to the proximity of Atlanta to the University of Georgia's main campus in <a href="Athens%2C%20Georgia">Athens, Georgia</a>, gave Georgia a <a href="home-field%20advantage">home-field advantage</a>. but the Virginia Tech fans, known for traveling well to their bowl appearances, quickly bought out their school's allotment of tickets and ensured a divided crowd.

Defense dominated in the first quarter of the game. Virginia Tech received the opening kickoff, but failed to capitalize on its opening drive thanks to a <a href="Penalty%20%28American%20football%29">personal foul</a> penalty that forced the Hokies to punt. On its first possession, Georgia moved into scoring position courtesy of a 26-yard run by Kregg Lumpkin. Failing to advance the ball further, Georgia sent in kicker Brandon Coutu who kicked a 39-yard field goal to give Georgia the early lead, 3–0.

The two teams proceeded to trade possessions, with no side able to gain an advantage over the other's defense. Tech received the kickoff from Georgia, but was again hampered by penalties after earning a first down. After the Virginia Tech punt, Georgia went three-and-out, punting to the Hokies, who also went three-and-out.

After taking possession on his own 16-yard line, Georgia quarterback and true <a href="freshman">freshman</a> <a href="Matthew%20Stafford%20%28American%20football%29">Matthew Stafford</a> caused the first turning point of the game as he threw an <a href="interception">interception</a> to Brenden Hill of Virginia Tech. Starting deep in Georgia territory, Virginia Tech was further aided by a personal foul on Georgia, which set up a first-and-goal situation for Virginia Tech on the Georgia 6-yard line. A two-yard run by Virginia Tech <a href="Halfback%20%28American%20football%29">tailback</a> Branden Ore brought the ball closer to the <a href="Goal%20line%20%28American%20football%29">goal line</a> and ended the first quarter of play.

At the end of the first quarter, Georgia led Virginia Tech 3–0.

The second quarter began with Virginia Tech inside the Georgia 10-yard line. After two unsuccessful plays, Virginia Tech was finally able to reach the end zone on a Branden Ore one-yard rush in a fourth-and-one situation. The <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> and <a href="extra%20point">extra point</a> gave Virginia Tech a 7–3 lead with 13:23 left in the half.

Georgia began its first possession with a 25-yard kickoff return, but failed to earn a first down in the face of a tough Hokie defensive effort. Georgia punter Gordon Ely-Kelso kicked a 56-yard punt following the Virginia Tech defensive stop. A breakdown in <a href="special%20teams">special teams</a> coverage by Georgia allowed Virginia Tech kick returner Eddie Royal to break free, returning the kick 56 yards back to the original line of scrimmage. As a result of the excellent field position provided by the return, Virginia Tech was able to drive the remaining 30 yards to the end zone. Branden Ore earned his second touchdown of the game, making the score 14–3 with 6:13 remaining on the clock.

After a short return, Georgia QB Stafford went to work on the Georgia 24-yard line. Two incomplete passes and one <a href="quarterback%20sack">sack</a> later, Georgia was again punting. Virginia Tech again was in excellent field position, starting on their own 47-yard line. Instead of rushing the ball, as had been the trend for the Tech offense up to that point, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer called for a <a href="trick%20play">trick play</a>. At the <a href="snap%20%28football%29">snap</a>, quarterback Sean Glennon <a href="lateral%20pass">lateraled</a> the football to wide receiver Eddie Royal. Rather than running the ball, Royal threw the ball downfield, catching the Georgia defense off guard. <a href="Tight%20end">Tight end</a> Sam Wheeler, the target of the throw, had been left uncovered by a defense expecting a run. The pass was completed, and Wheeler ran unimpeded 53 yards for a touchdown. The play took 19 seconds to execute, and gave Virginia Tech a 21–3 lead with 4:00 remaining in the half.

Georgia was again unable to earn a first down in the ensuing possession, and attempted three straight rushing plays that earned a total of six yards. After a Georgia punt, Virginia Tech ran two rushing plays before attempting the same Royal pass that had gone for a touchdown earlier. Georgia, having anticipated the play, sacked Royal for a loss of two yards, ending the first half.

At <a href="halftime">halftime</a>, Virginia Tech led Georgia 21–3.

Because Virginia Tech had received the opening kickoff, Georgia received the ball to open the second half. Stafford was able to connect with wide receiver Mario Raley for a 24-yard gain, taking Georgia to the 50-yard line, but Virginia Tech's defense stiffened and Georgia was forced to punt. Pinned at their ten-yard line by the Georgia punt, Virginia Tech went three-and-out and was itself forced to punt.

A 19-yard punt return by Mikey Henderson put Georgia into good field position. Stafford capitalized on the opportunity, completing a 26-yard pass to put Georgia into field-goal range. After three unsuccessful plays, kicker Brandon Coutu connected on a 51-yard field goal to cut the Virginia Tech lead to 21–6.

On the kickoff following the field goal, Georgia head coach Mark Richt ordered an unorthodox <a href="onside%20kick">onside kick</a>. Surprised by the unexpected play, the Virginia Tech coverage team was unable to recover the ball, which was leapt upon by the kicker, Brian Mimbs. With a new chance at offense and a sense of optimism triggered by the successful onside kick, Georgia drove down the field. Aided by 20 yards in penalties against Virginia Tech, the drive resulted in a six-yard touchdown pass to <a href="Martrez%20Milner">Martrez Milner</a>. The touchdown and extra point boosted Georgia's morale and cut the score to 21–13, Virginia Tech leading by eight.

The third quarter came to a close as Virginia Tech struggled to answer the two Georgia scores. Tech quarterback <a href="Sean%20Glennon">Sean Glennon</a> connected on a 29-yard pass to Eddie Royal, driving the Hokies to the Bulldog 47-yard line as the clock hit zero.

At the end of the third quarter, Virginia Tech still led Georgia, 21–13.

The fourth quarter began with Virginia Tech searching for a way to answer Georgia's previous two scores and quash the momentum Georgia had picked up. On the third play of the quarter, however, Virginia Tech quarterback Sean Glennon threw an <a href="interception">interception</a> to Georgia's Tony Taylor. Beginning on their own 35-yard line, Georgia capitalized on the mistake quickly, courtesy of a 15-yard personal foul penalty and a 41-yard completion from Stafford to Milner. Georgia, hoping to tie the time, attempted and completed a <a href="two-point%20conversion">two-point conversion</a>. The resulting scores tied the game at 21–21 with 12:39 remaining in the game.

Virginia Tech's hopes to answer were smashed on the first play after Georgia's kickoff as Glennon fumbled the snap, losing the ball to Georgia's Quentin Moses. Georgia failed to pick up a first down following the turnover, but the fumble did turn into three points for the Bulldogs, as kicker Brandon Coutu connected on his third field goal of the day, giving Georgia its first lead since the first quarter, 24–21.

After the Georgia kickoff, Glennon was again intercepted by Tony Taylor, who earned his second interception on the day and created Glennon's third turnover. Taylor returned the ball 16 yards to the Tech one-yard line, setting up an easy touchdown for the Bulldogs. With 6:54 remaining, Georgia took a 31–21 lead over Virginia Tech.

On the ensuing Tech possession, Tech's quarterback continued to play poorly. On the third play following the kickoff, Glennon was intercepted for the fourth time in the game. The downfield interception set up Georgia at their own 11-yard line. Georgia rushed the ball three times, forcing Virginia Tech to use two timeouts in order to stop the clock. The punt by Georgia's Ely-Kelso was poorly done, and traveled only 15 yards before going out of bounds.

As a result of the excellent field position, Virginia Tech seemed in position for an easy score. However, after a quick Tech first down, the Georgia defense stiffened and Tech was forced to settle for a field goal. The 28-yard kick by Brandon Pace cut Georgia's lead to 31–24, but only 3:42 remained on the clock. Due to the short time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick in order to have another chance at offense. The kick was recovered by Georgia, however, and the Bulldogs proceeded to rush the ball in three consecutive plays, forcing the Hokies to use their last timeout in order to conserve time for one final drive.

Georgia's punt rolled into the end zone for a touchback, and with 1:28 remaining in the game, Virginia Tech began the final drive on its own 20-yard line. Any tension was soon defused by the Georgia defense, which forced three incompletions and a sack. Glennon's attempt at a <a href="Hail%20Mary%20pass">Hail Mary pass</a> fell short, giving Georgia the win with a final score of 31–24.

The 18-point comeback was the largest for Georgia under coach Mark Richt up to that point. In recognition of their performances during the game, Georgia linebacker Tony Taylor and quarterback Matthew Stafford were named the defensive and offensive MVPs of the game, respectively. Taylor's two interceptions tied the Georgia bowl record for interceptions, first set by Scott Woerner and Ronnie Harris. The four Virginia Tech turnovers resulted in 18 Georgia points. Georgia's sole turnover resulted in seven points for Virginia Tech.

Over a third of Georgia's 71 rushing yards came on a single 26-yard run in the first quarter by <a href="running%20back">halfback</a> Kregg Lumpkin. After the run, Lumpkin would amass only 13 additional yards in the remaining three quarters of play. Over half of Georgia's total offensive yards (200 total yards) came through the air from Stafford, who finished with 129 passing yards, one interception, and one touchdown. Approximately a third (41 yards) of Stafford's passing yards came on a single completion in the fourth quarter. Another long pass play netted Stafford 24 yards. Together, the two plays accounted for half of Stafford's total passing yards. Seven other completions netted only 64 yards, an average of just over 9 yards a play.

Georgia's kicking game had a far more active day than its offense. Punter Gordon Ely-Kelso booted seven punts and kicker Brandon Coutu nailed three field goals. The field goals, kicked from 39, 51, and 28 yards away and two extra points made Coutu Georgia's leading scorer in the game, earning 11 points. Ely-Kelso netted 264 yards in punts, an average of 37.7 yards per kick. Though not long, the punts were high enough in the air to allow Georgia's special teams to get downfield and prevent long punt returns. Only two of Ely-Kelso's punts were returned by Tech kick returner Eddie Royal, and one return was for negative yardage.

Georgia's defense managed a strong performance statistically and in real terms. The most obvious examples of this were the three interceptions and one forced fumble that proved to be the turning point in the game. Two of the interceptions were caught by linebacker Tony Taylor, who also had nine tackles, two for a loss of yards. The tackles tied him with Paul Oliver, who also had nine. The third interception came from Kelin Johnson, while the fumble was forced by Charles Johnson. Johnson had an active day as well. In addition to the forced fumble, he recorded four tackles, two sacks, and a pass break-up.

The defensive play of Taylor, Oliver, and Johnson greatly affected the course of the game and is apparent in Georgia's time of possession and average starting position in each of the quarters. During the first and second quarters, Georgia had average starting positions on their own 19 and 26-yard lines, respectively. Their first-quarter time of possession was just 5:41, and their second-quarter possession time was 6:34. During the third and fourth quarters, when all four Virginia Tech turnovers took place, Georgia's time of possession jumped to 10:41 and 7:47, respectively. In the third quarter, their average starting possession gained ten yards to the Georgia 36, and during the final quarter, their average starting position was the Virginia Tech 36-yard line. This fact allowed Georgia to capitalize on the Virginia Tech turnovers, turning them into points on the scoreboard.

Sean Glennon's four turnovers tied a career-high for interceptions and brought his season interception mark to 11. He completed 13 of his 26 passes for 94 yards and a completion percentage of 50%. The passing total of 94 yards was the second-lowest total in the entire season, coming behind only a November 4 game in <a href="Miami%20Hurricanes%20football">Miami</a> where Glennon passed for just 86 yards in the face of a tough defense. In a statistic unusual for the 2006 season, Glennon was not the only Tech player to complete a pass. Wide receiver Eddie Royal's 53-yard TD pass made him just the third Virginia Tech player to complete a pass during the 2006 season. The play on which Royal made his throw, a lateral WR pass, had been attempted once previously in the season during a 38–27 loss to Georgia Tech.

On the ground, the Hokies had even less success than they did in the air. Branden Ore, Tech's starting <a href="running%20back">tailback</a>, earned 42 yards in 20 short rushes during the game. With a long run of eight yards, Ore was kept in check by Georgia's defense. The only other Hokie to achieve positive yardage on the ground was backup tailback Kenny Lewis, who only managed five yards. Glennon was sacked three times, once fumbling the ball. These sacks wiped out the 11 rushing yards he managed to gain during his scrambles for yardage. In the second quarter, Virginia Tech was aided by excellent field position, enabling them to score three offensive touchdowns. Tech's average starting field position in that quarter was the Georgia 48-yard line, allowing for easy scores even for a struggling offense.

As with Georgia, Virginia Tech's kicking and special teams proved to have more success than either aspect of the offense. Virginia Tech kicker Brandon Pace scored a single 28-yard field goal late in the fourth quarter, and punter Nic Schmitt blasted four punts for a total of 195 yards, averaging 48.8 yards a punt. Pace's field goal helped to trigger a late-game rally by Virginia Tech, which had been stunned by a Georgia onside kick and several interceptions thrown by Glennon. Schmitt's long punts, meanwhile, denied Georgia good field position in the first half of the game. Only in the second half, when Glennon's interceptions allowed Georgia to start on the Tech side of the field, was the Georgia offense able to reach the end zone. In the first and second quarters, Georgia's average starting position was their own 19-yard line and own 26-yard line, respectively.

That starting field position proved a boon for the Virginia Tech defense, which only allowed 200 total yards in the game. Tech linebacker Vince Hall led the Hokies and all defensive players with 13 tackles in the game. Tech recorded one interception during the game, courtesy of Brenden Hill, who also made three tackles. Georgia's offensive line, despite starting only six scholarship offensive linemen, allowed just two sacks to the Virginia Tech defense. Chris Ellis and Noland Burchette each earned a single sack, accounting for a loss of 15 total yards.
The win over #14 Virginia Tech enabled the Bulldogs to break into the Top 25 rankings in the final college football poll of the season. Georgia was ranked #23 in the country thanks to its win over the Hokies, who dropped to #19 nationally following the loss. The loss snapped a six-game winning streak by Virginia Tech and ended the Hokies' bid at becoming just the fourth team in school history to win 11 games in a season. The 2006 Georgia Bulldogs, consequently, became the first team in school history to defeat three consecutive ranked teams. No. 5 <a href="2006%20Auburn%20Tigers%20football%20team">Auburn</a>, No. 16 <a href="2006%20Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football">Georgia Tech</a>, and No. 14 Virginia Tech all fell to Georgia in November or December. The game and the tens of thousands of fans it attracted injected an estimated $35 million into the Atlanta area economy, mostly as a result of food, hotel, and other expenses incurred by visiting fans.

In August 2007, Frank Beamer closed team practices to outside observers for the first time in 20 years. He cited concerns about unknown individuals watching Virginia Tech practice in Atlanta before the Hokies' loss to Georgia, potentially leading to the defeat. During the 2007 season, Virginia Tech quarterback <a href="Sean%20Glennon">Sean Glennon</a> was replaced as the Hokies' starter by freshman <a href="Tyrod%20Taylor">Tyrod Taylor</a>, causing many pundits to point to the four interceptions Glennon threw in the Chick-fil-A Bowl as an example of his failure as a quarterback. Brian Mimbs, the former <a href="walk-on%20%28sports%29">walk-on</a> who kicked and recovered the onside kick that began Georgia's rally was named the Bulldogs' starting punter for the 2007 season, partially due to his performance in the Chick-fil-A Bowl.

At the end of the <a href="2007%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season">2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season</a>, both Georgia and Virginia Tech were named to <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> bowl games, indicating an increase over their 2006 performances. Georgia earned a bid to the <a href="2008%20Sugar%20Bowl">2008 Sugar Bowl</a> in New Orleans, Louisiana against the <a href="2007%20Hawaii%20Warriors%20football%20team">Hawaii Warriors</a>, who they defeated, 41–10.

Super Smash Bros. Melee

Super Smash Bros. Melee is a <a href="Fictional%20crossover">crossover</a> <a href="fighting%20game">fighting video game</a> developed by <a href="HAL%20Laboratory">HAL Laboratory</a> and published by <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> for the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a>. It was first released in Japan on November 21, 2001, in North America on December 3, 2001, in Europe on May 24, 2002, and in Australia on May 31, 2002. The second installment in the "<a href="Super%20Smash%20Bros.">Super Smash Bros.</a>" series, it features characters from Nintendo video game franchises such as "<a href="Mario%20%28franchise%29">Mario</a>", "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>", "<a href="Star%20Fox">Star Fox</a>", and "<a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%20%28video%20game%20series%29">Pokémon</a>". The stages and gameplay modes reference or take designs from these franchises as well.

"Melee" includes all playable characters from <a href="Super%20Smash%20Bros.%20%28video%20game%29">the first game</a>, and also adds characters from franchises such as "<a href="Fire%20Emblem">Fire Emblem</a>", of which no games had been released outside Japan at the time. "Melee"s gameplay system offers an unorthodox approach to the fighting game genre, with a counter that measures damage with increasing percentages, representing the knockback the character will experience, rather than a depleting <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">health bar</a> seen in most fighting games. It builds on the first game by adding new gameplay features and playable characters. Following the popularity of its <a href="multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer gameplay</a>, "Melee" has been featured in many <a href="competitive%20gaming">competitive gaming</a> tournaments, and is one of the most popular competitive fighting games.

"Super Smash Bros. Melee" received critical acclaim, as well as several awards and acknowledgements from various publications; it is now considered <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best">one of the greatest video games ever made</a>. It achieved strong sales upon its release, becoming the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20Nintendo%20GameCube%20video%20games">GameCube's best-selling title</a> with over seven million copies sold by 2008. "Super Smash Bros. Melee" was followed by "<a href="Super%20Smash%20Bros.%20Brawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a>" for the <a href="Wii">Wii</a> in 2008.

Like its predecessor, "Super Smash Bros. Melee" differs from traditional fighting games as the objective is to force their opponents beyond the boundaries of the stage. Most attacks inflict damage and can, if enough damage is dealt, knock back the enemy. Each character's health is measured by a meter that represents damage as a percentage. The higher the percentage value, the farther the player gets knocked back, and the easier they are to knock off the stage, which will result in the character's death and the loss of a stock, or life. Unlike other games of the same genre, in which moves are entered by button-input combinations, most moves in "Super Smash Bros. Melee" can be accessed via one-button presses and a joystick direction.

During battles, items related to Nintendo games or merchandise fall onto the game field. These items have purposes ranging from inflicting damage on the opponent to restoring health to the player. Additionally, most stages have a theme relating to a Nintendo franchise or a specific Nintendo game and are interactive to the player. Although the stages are rendered in three dimensions, players can only move on a two-dimensional plane. Not all stages are available immediately; some stages must be "unlocked" by achieving particular requirements. Some stages feature moving elements and platforms and hazards that harm players, while others lack these elements.

<a href="Single-player%20video%20game">Single-player</a> mode provides the player with a variety of <a href="Side-scrolling%20video%20game">side-scrolling</a> fighting challenges. The applicable modes range from "Classic Mode", which involves the player battling multiple opponents and a <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss</a> character, to the "Home Run Contest", a minigame involving the player trying to launch a sandbag as far as possible with a <a href="baseball%20bat">Home Run Bat</a>. Some of these modes are personalized for the character; for example, the "Target Test" sets out a specialized area for a character in which they aim to destroy ten targets in the least amount of time they can. These areas may include references to that particular character's past and legacy. The "Board the Platforms" minigame from the prequel was not included in "Melee". "Melee" introduced "Adventure Mode", which takes the player to several predefined universes of characters in the Nintendo franchise. "All-Star Mode" is an unlockable feature that requires the player to defeat every character in the game while having only three <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">health</a> supplements between battles.

In the <a href="multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> mode, up to four players or computer-controlled characters may fight in a <a href="Deathmatch">free-for-all</a> or on separate teams. The <a href="central%20processing%20unit">central processing unit</a> (CPU) characters' <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) difficulty is ranked from one to nine in ascending order of difficulty. Individual players can also be handicapped; the higher the handicap, the stronger the player. Victory is determined in five ways, depending on the game type. The most common multiplayer modes are “Time mode”, where the player or team with the most KOs and least falls wins after a predetermined amount of time, and "Stock mode", a battle in which the last player or team with lives remaining wins. This can be changed to less conventional modes like "Coin mode", which rewards the richest player as the victor. Players must collect coins created by hitting enemies and try not to lose them by falling off the stage; harder hits release higher quantities of coins. Other options are available, updating from "Super Smash Bros.", such as determining the number and type of items that appear during the battle.

<a href="Trophies">Trophies</a> (known as "Figures" in the Japanese version) of various <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> characters and objects can be collected throughout the game. These trophies include figures of playable characters, accessories, and items associated with them as well as series and characters not otherwise playable in the game. The trophies range from the well-known to the obscure, and even characters or elements only released in Japan. "Super Smash Bros." had a similar system of plush dolls; however, it only included the 12 playable characters. One trophy is exclusive to the Japanese version of the game.

"Super Smash Bros. Melee" features 25 (26 if Zelda and Sheik are considered separate) characters, 13 more than its predecessor. Fourteen are available initially, while the other 11 characters require completing specific tasks to become available. Every character featured in the game is derived from a popular Nintendo franchise. All characters have a symbol that appears behind their damage meter which represents their series, such as a <a href="Triforce">Triforce</a> symbol behind <a href="Link%20%28The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda%29">Link's</a> damage meter and a <a href="Pok%C3%A9%20Ball">Poké Ball</a> behind a <a href="List%20of%20Pok%C3%A9mon">Pokémon species</a>. Some characters represent popular franchises, while others were less-known at the time of the release; <a href="Marth%20%28Fire%20Emblem%29">Marth</a> and <a href="Roy%20%28Fire%20Emblem%29">Roy</a> represent the "<a href="Fire%20Emblem">Fire Emblem</a>" series, which was not released outside Japan at the time. The characters' appearance in "Super Smash Bros. Melee" led to a rise in the popularity of the series. References are made throughout the game to the relationship between characters of the same universe; in one of the events from "Event mode", <a href="Mario">Mario</a> must defeat his enemy <a href="Bowser%20%28character%29">Bowser</a> to rescue <a href="Princess%20Peach">Princess Peach</a>. Furthermore, each character has recognizable moves from their original series, such as <a href="Samus%20Aran">Samus</a>'s firearms from the <a href="Metroid">"Metroid" series</a> and Link's arsenal of weapons.

<a href="HAL%20Laboratory">HAL Laboratory</a> developed "Super Smash Bros. Melee", with <a href="Masahiro%20Sakurai">Masahiro Sakurai</a> as the head of production. The game was one of the first games released on the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> and highlighted the advancement in graphics from the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a>. The developers wanted to pay homage to the debut of the GameCube by making an opening <a href="Full%20motion%20video">FMV</a> sequence that would attract people's attention to the graphics. HAL worked with three separate graphic houses in <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> to make the opening sequence. On their official website, the developers posted screen shots and information highlighting and explaining the attention to <a href="physics">physics</a> and detail in the game, with references to changes from its predecessor. The game was in development for 13 months, and <a href="Masahiro%20Sakurai">Sakurai</a> called his lifestyle during this period "destructive" with no holidays and short weekends. Unlike the experimental first "<a href="Super%20Smash%20Bros.%20%28video%20game%29">Super Smash Bros.</a>", he felt great pressure to deliver a quality sequel, claiming it was the "biggest project I had ever led up to that point". Despite the painful development cycle, Sakurai proudly called it "the sharpest game in the series... it just felt really good to play", even compared to its successor, "<a href="Super%20Smash%20Bros.%20Brawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a>".

On the game's official Japanese website, the developers explain reasons for making particular characters playable and explain why some characters were not available as playable characters upon release. Initially, the development team wanted to replace Ness with <a href="Lucas%20%28Mother%203%29">Lucas</a>, the main character of "<a href="Mother%203">Mother 3</a>", but retained Ness in consideration of delays. The game's creators later included Lucas in the game's sequel, "<a href="Super%20Smash%20Bros.%20Brawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a>". Video game developer <a href="Hideo%20Kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> originally requested the inclusion of <a href="Solid%20Snake">Solid Snake</a> to Sakurai, but the game was too far into development. As with Lucas, development time allowed for his inclusion in "Brawl". Marth and Roy were initially intended to be playable exclusively in the Japanese version of "Super Smash Bros. Melee". However, they received favorable attention during the game's North American localization, leading to the decision for the developers to include them in the Western version.

Sakurai stated that the development team had suggested characters from four other games to represent the Famicom/NES era until the developers decided that the <a href="Ice%20Climber">Ice Climber</a>s would be in the game. The developers have noted characters that have very similar moves to each other on the website; such characters have been referred to as "clones" in the media. Nintendo also considered including "<a href="GoldenEye%20007%20%281997%20video%20game%29">GoldenEye 007</a>"s version of <a href="James%20Bond%20%28literary%20character%29">James Bond</a> in the game, but this did not come to fruition. According to Sakurai, there were a number of problems preventing Bond's inclusion; these included his uses of realistic weapons and actor <a href="Pierce%20Brosnan">Pierce Brosnan</a>'s likeness, and the fact that Nintendo did not have the rights to the character.

Nintendo presented the game at the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo 2001</a> as a playable demonstration. The next major exposition of the game came in August 2001 at Spaceworld, when Nintendo displayed a playable demo that updated from the previous demo displayed at E3. <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> offered a playable tournament of the games for fans in which a <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> and "Super Smash Bros. Melee" were prizes for the winner. Before the game's release, the Japanese official website included weekly updates, including screenshots and character profiles. Nintendo followed this trend with "Super Smash Bros. Brawl", in which there were daily updates by the game's developer, Masahiro Sakurai. Japanese gaming magazine "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" reported that Nintendo advertised the game in between showings of "<a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%204Ever">Pokémon 4Ever</a>" across movie theaters in Japan. In January 2003, "Super Smash Bros Melee" became part of the <a href="Nintendo%20Selects">Player's Choice</a>, a marketing label used by Nintendo to promote video games that have sold more than a million copies. In August 2005, Nintendo bundled the game with the GameCube for <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>99.99.

"Super Smash Bros. Melee" features both new and re-arranged music from many of Nintendo's popular gaming franchises. In 2002, <a href="Enterbrain">Enterbrain</a> released a soundtrack in Japan titled "Dairantou Smash Brothers DX Orchestra Concert". The same soundtrack was released in 2003 as "Smashing... Live!" as a bonus for subscribing to "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" magazine in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, and also as a free gift in an issue of the <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> "<a href="Official%20Nintendo%20Magazine">Official Nintendo Magazine</a>". The soundtrack does not include music taken directly from the game, but features many live orchestral arrangements performed by the <a href="New%20Japan%20Philharmonic">New Japan Philharmonic</a>. The game contains a number of unlockable tracks that can be obtained after making certain in-game accomplishments. On the same website, the developers have posted discussions about the game's music and voice acting between Masahiro Sakurai and the game's composers.

Dean Harrington is the game's in-game narrator, and also voices Master Hand and Crazy Hand.

"Super Smash Bros. Melee" received critical acclaim from reviewers, most of whom credited "Melee"s expansion of gameplay features from "Super Smash Bros". Focusing on the additional features, <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> commented that "Melee really scores big in the 'we've added tons of great extra stuff' department". Reviewers compared the game favorably to "Super Smash Bros." <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Fran Mirabella III stated that it was "in an entirely different league than the N64 version"; <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Miguel Lopez praised the game for offering a more advanced "classic-mode" compared to its predecessor, while detailing the Adventure Mode as "really a hit-or-miss experience". Despite a mixed response to the single-player modes, many reviewers expressed the game's multiplayer mode as a strong component of the game. In their review of the game, GameSpy stated that "you'll have a pretty hard time finding a more enjoyable multiplayer experience on any other console".

"Melee"s visuals garnered a positive reaction. GameSpot lauded the game's character and background models, stating that "the character models are pleasantly full-bodied, and the quality of their textures is amazing". IGN's Fran Mirabella III praised the game's use of physics, animation and graphics, although his colleague Matt Casamassina thought that "some of the backgrounds lack the visual polish endowed upon the characters" when giving a second opinion about the game.

Critics praised the game's orchestrated soundtrack; while GameSpot's Greg Kasavin commented that "it all sounds brilliant". GameSpy praised the music for its nostalgic effect, with soundtracks ranging from multiple Nintendo series.

Reviewers have welcomed the simplistic controls, but its "hyper-responsiveness", with the characters easily dashing and precise movements being difficult to perform, was expressed as a serious flaw of the game by GameSpot. With a milder criticism of controls, Bryn Williams of GameSpy commented that "movement and navigation seems slightly too sensitive". The basis of "Melee"s gameplay system is the battles between Nintendo characters, which has been suggested as being overly hectic; N-Europe questioned whether the gameplay is "too Frantic?", even though they enjoyed the variety of modes on offer. Similarly, Nintendo Spin's Clark Nielsen stated that "Melee was too fast for its own good", and "skill was more about just being able to wrap your head around what was happening as opposed to really getting into the combat". In regards to the pace of the game, "Edge" commented that it even made gameplay features such as "<a href="Blocking%20%28martial%20arts%29">blocking</a>" redundant, as the player is not given enough time to react to an attack.

Despite the new features added to the game, some reviews criticized "Melee" for a lack of originality and for being too similar to its predecessor, "Super Smash Bros". Caleb Hale from GameCritics.com noted that while it was "every bit as good as its Nintendo 64 predecessor" he also felt "the game doesn't expand much past that point". On a similar note, "Edge" stated that "it's not evolution; it's reproduction", in reference to a perceived lack of innovation. The nostalgic nature of the game received a positive reaction, as well as the accompanying stages and items that allude to past Nintendo games. Gaming journalists have welcomed the roster of 25 Nintendo characters, as well as the trophy system, which Nintendo Spin labeled as "a great addition to this game".

When released in Japan, it became the fastest selling GameCube game with 358,525 units sold in the week ending November 25, 2001. This success continued as the game sold more than a million units only two months after its release, making it the first GameCube title to reach a million copies. The game also sold well in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, where it sold 250,000-copies in nine days. In the United States, "Super Smash Bros. Melee" was the 19th best-selling video game in 2001 according to the <a href="NPD%20Group">NPD Group</a>. By July 2006, it had sold 3.2 million copies and earned $125 million in the United States alone. "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" ranked it as the fifth highest-selling game launched for the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>, <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> or <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Approximately 4.06 million units have been sold in the country as of December 27, 2007. With a software-to-hardware ratio of 3:4 at one time, some have attributed the increasing sales of the GameCube near the launch date to "Melee". As of March 10, 2008, "Super Smash Bros. Melee" is the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20GameCube%20video%20games">best-selling GameCube game</a>, with more than seven million copies sold worldwide. It has been estimated that at one point in time 70% of all GameCube owners also owned "Melee".

Several publications have acknowledged "Super Smash Bros. Melee" in competitions and awards. In their "Best of 2001" awards, <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> chose it as Best Fighting GameCube Game, <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s reader choice chose it as <a href="Game%20of%20the%20Year">Game of the Year</a>, "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" chose it as Best Multiplayer and Best GameCube Game, and <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> chose it as the Best GameCube Game and tenth best game of the year.

<a href="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a> placed it sixth in a poll of the 100 best games ever and was in the final four of the ""Best. Game. Ever."" contest. In the 200th issue of "Electronic Gaming Monthly", the editors selected "Melee" as the 92nd most influential game in their "Top 200 Games of Their Time" list, defining "Melee" as "Billions of things to unlock, plus Yoshi pummeling Pikachu with a bat". In a similar competition, "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" named "Super Smash Bros. Melee" the 16th best game ever to appear on a Nintendo console, and selected it as the 2001 "Game of the Year". IGN named it the third best GameCube game of all-time in 2007 as a part of a feature reflecting on the GameCube's long lifespan, citing it as "the grand stage of fighters, much like Mario Kart is for racing fans". GameSpy chose it as fourth in a similar list, citing that it had "better graphics, better music, more characters, more gameplay modes, more secrets to discover" in comparison to its predecessor. The game was ranked 58th in <a href="Official%20Nintendo%20Magazine">Official Nintendo Magazine</a>'s "100 Greatest Nintendo Games Ever" feature.

"Super Smash Bros. Melee" is a widely played <a href="competitive%20video%20game">competitive video game</a> and has been featured in several high-profile tournaments. Many consider it to be the most competitively viable game in the series. From 2004 to 2007, <a href="Major%20League%20Gaming">Major League Gaming</a> sponsored "Melee" on its Pro Circuit. Although dropping "Melee" from its 2007 Pro Circuit, MLG still sponsored a number of tournaments as part of the Underground Smash Series. "Melee" was also included in the <a href="Evolution%20Championship%20Series">Evolution Championship Series</a> (Evo) in 2007, a fighting game tournament held in <a href="Las%20Vegas">Las Vegas</a> and was hosted at Evo 2013 after a charity vote to decide the final game to be featured in its tournament lineup. Due to the large turnout and popularity that year, Evo again included "Melee" at their 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 events. In 2014 "Melee" was played at MLG Anaheim. Evo 2016 is the largest "Melee" tournament to date with 2,350 entrants.

<a href="Ken%20Hoang">Ken Hoang</a>, also known as "The King of Smash", considered to be the game's best player from 2003 to 2006, has won over $50,000 from Smash tournaments. As of August 2018, <a href="Armada%20%28video%20gamer%29">Adam "Armada" Lindgren</a> has won over $300,000 from Smash tournaments in total and over $90,000 in 2017 alone, placing his tournament winnings as one of the highest of all professional "Melee" players.

Several professional "Melee" players including Christopher "KillaOR" McKenzie, <a href="Isai%20Alvarado">Isai Alvarado</a>, and Ken were seen in the 2005 "I'm a Professional Gamer" episode of the <a href="MTV">MTV</a> reality series "<a href="True%20Life">True Life</a>". The competitive "Smash" community was featured in a 2013 <a href="crowd%20funding">crowd-funded</a> documentary called "<a href="The%20Smash%20Brothers">The Smash Brothers</a>". The film detailed the history of the professional scene and profiled seven prominent "Melee" players including Hoang, Azen, <a href="Mew2King">Jason "Mew2King" Zimmerman</a>, Isai, PC Chris, KoreanDJ, and Evo 2013 and Evo 2014 champion, <a href="Joseph%20Marquez">Joseph "Mang0" Marquez</a>. Commentary footage from a "Melee" tournament is the origin of the <a href="Wombo%20combo">Wombo combo</a> <a href="internet%20meme">internet meme</a>.

At the pre-E3 conference of 2005, Nintendo announced "Melee"s sequel, 2008's "<a href="Super%20Smash%20Bros.%20Brawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a>". Nintendo's president, Satoru Iwata requested Masahiro Sakurai to be the director of the game after the conference. Although being slower paced than "Melee", the game retains most of the gameplay features of its predecessors while having major gameplay additions, such as a more substantial single-player mode and online play via the <a href="Nintendo%20Wi-Fi%20Connection">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</a> Taking advantage of the Wii's variety of controller options, the game allows the use of the <a href="Wii%20Remote">Wii Remote</a>, <a href="Wii%20Nunchuk">Nunchuk</a>, <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube%23Controller">GameCube controller</a>, and the <a href="Classic%20Controller">Classic Controller</a>. Like "Melee", the game makes references to games and franchises, including those that debuted after the release of "Melee"; for example, Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf's character designs are taken from "" and a "<a href="Nintendogs">Nintendogs</a>" puppy is present as an Assist Trophy (a new item that summons computer-controlled characters from different games to briefly participate in the fight).

1880 Democratic National Convention

The 1880 Democratic National Convention was held June 22 to 24, 1880, at the <a href="Cincinnati%20Music%20Hall">Music Hall</a> in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, and nominated <a href="Winfield%20S.%20Hancock">Winfield S. Hancock</a> of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> for <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> and <a href="William%20H.%20English">William H. English</a> of <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> for <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201880">United States presidential election of 1880</a>.

Six men were officially candidates for nomination at the convention, and several more also received votes. Of these, the two leading candidates were Hancock and <a href="Thomas%20F.%20Bayard">Thomas F. Bayard</a> of <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>. Not officially a candidate, but wielding a heavy influence over the convention, was the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> nominee from 1876, <a href="Samuel%20J.%20Tilden">Samuel J. Tilden</a> of New York. Many Democrats believed Tilden to have been unjustly deprived of the presidency in 1876 and hoped to rally around him in the 1880 campaign. Tilden, however, was ambiguous about his willingness to participate in another campaign, leading some delegates to defect to other candidates, while others stayed loyal to their old standard-bearer.

As the convention opened, some delegates favored Bayard, a conservative Senator, and some others supported Hancock, a career soldier and <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> hero. Still others flocked to men they saw as surrogates for Tilden, including <a href="Henry%20B.%20Payne">Henry B. Payne</a> of Ohio, an attorney and former representative, and <a href="Samuel%20J.%20Randall">Samuel J. Randall</a> of Pennsylvania, the <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the United States House of Representatives</a>. The first round of balloting was inconclusive. Before the second round, Tilden's withdrawal from the campaign became known for certain and delegates flocked to Hancock, who was nominated. English, a conservative politician from a <a href="swing%20state">swing state</a>, was nominated for Vice President. Hancock and English were narrowly defeated in the race against <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a> and <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a> that autumn.

In 1876, <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> of <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> defeated Democrat <a href="Samuel%20J.%20Tilden">Samuel J. Tilden</a> of <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> in the most <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201876">hotly contested election</a> to that time in the nation's history. The results initially indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral votes of several states were ardently disputed until mere days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bi-partisan <a href="Electoral%20Commission%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral Commission</a>, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes. Most Democrats believed Tilden had been robbed of the presidency, and he became the leading candidate for nomination in 1880. In the meantime, issues of <a href="tariff">tariff</a> reform and the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a> divided the country and the major parties.

The monetary issue played a large role in selecting the nominees in 1880, but had little effect on the general election campaign. The debate concerned the basis for the United States dollar's value. Nothing but gold and silver coin had ever been legal tender in the United States until the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, when the mounting costs of the war forced Congress to issue "<a href="United%20States%20Notes">greenbacks</a>" (<a href="United%20States%20one-dollar%20bill%23History">dollar bills</a> backed by government bonds). They paid for the war, but resulted in the most severe <a href="inflation">inflation</a> since the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>. After the war, bondholders and other creditors (especially in the North) wanted to return to a gold standard. At the same time, debtors (often in the South and West) benefited by the way inflation reduced their debts, and workers and some businessmen liked the way inflation made for easy credit. The issue cut across parties, producing dissension among Republicans and Democrats alike and spawning a third party, the <a href="Greenback%20Party">Greenback Party</a>, in 1876, when both major parties nominated hard money men. Monetary debate intensified as Congress effectively demonetized silver in 1873 and began redeeming greenbacks in gold by 1879, while limiting their circulation. By the 1880 convention, the nation's money was backed by gold alone, but the issue was far from settled.

Debate over tariffs would come to play a much larger role in the campaign. During the Civil War, Congress raised protective tariffs to new heights. This was done partly to pay for the war, but partly because high tariffs were popular in the North. A high tariff meant that foreign goods were more expensive, which made it easier for American businesses to sell goods domestically. Republicans <a href="Protectionism">supported high tariffs</a> as a way to protect American jobs and increase prosperity. Democrats, generally, saw them as making goods unnecessarily expensive and adding to the growing federal revenues when, with the end of the Civil War, that much revenue was no longer needed. Many Northern Democrats supported high tariffs, however, for the same economic reasons that their Republican neighbors did, so while Democratic platforms called for a tariff "for revenue only," their speakers avoided the question as much as possible.

Samuel Jones Tilden began his political career in the "<a href="Barnburners%20and%20Hunkers">Barnburner</a>," or Free Soil, faction of the New York Democratic Party. He was a successful lawyer and had accumulated a considerable fortune. A disciple of former president <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>, Tilden was first elected to the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Assembly">New York State Assembly</a> in 1846. Tilden defected with Van Buren to the 1848 <a href="Free%20Soil%20Party">Free Soil Party</a> convention before returning to the Democratic party after the election. Unlike many free-soil Democrats, Tilden stayed with his party in the 1850s instead of transferring his allegiance to the newly formed Republican party. When the Civil War began, he remained loyal to the Union and considered himself a <a href="War%20Democrat">War Democrat</a>. In 1866, he became chairman of the New York State Democratic party, a post he held for eight years. Tilden initially cooperated with <a href="Tammany%20Hall">Tammany Hall</a>, the New York City political machine of <a href="William%20M.%20Tweed">William "Boss" Tweed</a>, but the two men soon became enemies. In the early 1870s, as reports of Tammany's corruption spread, Tilden took up the cause of reform. He formed a rival faction that captured control of the party and led the effort to uncover proof of Tammany's corruption and remove its men from office. Tweed was soon indicted and convicted; Tammany was weakened and reformed, but not vanquished.

The triumph over Tammany paved the way for Tilden's election to a two-year term as governor in 1874. As a popular, reformist governor of a large <a href="swing%20state">swing state</a>, Tilden was a natural candidate for the presidency in 1876, when one of the main issues was the corruption of the administration of President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>. He was nominated on the second ballot, and campaigned on a platform of reform and sound money (i.e. the gold standard). His opponent was Governor Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio, likewise noted for his honesty and hard-money views. After the closely contested election, with the question still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the dispute to a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which would determine the fate of the disputed electoral votes. Tilden opposed the idea, but many Democrats supported it as the only way to avoid a second Civil War. The commission voted 8–7 to award Hayes the disputed votes. Congressional Democrats acquiesced in Hayes's election, but at a price: the new Republican president <a href="Compromise%20of%201877">withdrew federal troops from Southern capitals</a> after his inauguration. Tilden was defeated—robbed, in his opinion and that of his supporters.

Tilden spent the next four years as the presumptive Democratic candidate in 1880. In 1879, he declined to run for another term as governor and focused instead on building support for the 1880 presidential nomination. He considered many of his former friends (including Senator Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware) enemies now for their support of the Electoral Commission, and sought to keep the "fraud of '76" in the spotlight and burnish his own future candidacy by having his congressional allies investigate the events of the post-election maneuvering. For ten months beginning in May 1878, the Potter Committee, chaired by Democratic Congressman <a href="Clarkson%20Nott%20Potter">Clarkson Nott Potter</a> of New York, investigated allegations of fraud and corruption in the states which had contested electoral votes in 1876. Rather than produce conclusive evidence of Republican malfeasance, as Tilden's supporters hoped, the committee exonerated Tilden of wrongdoing, but uncovered conflicting evidence that showed state election officials of both parties in an unfavorable light. This, and Tilden's declining health, made many Democrats question his candidacy. Even so, Tilden's presumed ability to carry New York, combined with his political organization and personal fortune, made him a serious contender.

The first of these qualifications was shattered with the Republican victory in the <a href="New%20York%20state%20election%2C%201879">New York gubernatorial election in 1879</a>. In that election, a revitalized Tammany split from the regular Democratic party in a patronage dispute with Tilden's faction (now known as the "Irving Hall Democrats"). Tammany ran its new leader, <a href="John%20Kelly%20%28New%20York%20politician%29">"Honest" John Kelly</a>, as an independent candidate for governor, allowing the Republicans to carry the state with a plurality of the vote. Tilden began to waver, issuing ambiguous statements about whether he would run again. Rumors circulated wildly in the months before the convention, with no definitive word from Tilden. As the New York delegation left for the national convention in Cincinnati, Tilden gave a letter to one of his chief supporters, <a href="Daniel%20Manning">Daniel Manning</a>, suggesting that his health might force him to decline the nomination. Tilden hoped to be nominated, but only if he was the unanimous choice of the convention; if not, Manning was entrusted to make the contents of Tilden's letter available to the New York delegation. When it became clear that the nomination would be contested, Manning revealed the contents of the Tilden letter; it was vague and inconclusive, but once is contents became known to Tilden's home state delegates, they chose to interpret it as a withdrawal. The New York delegation now considered Tilden's candidacy to be ended, and sought a new standard-bearer.

One beneficiary of Tilden's departure from the scene was Senator Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware. Bayard was the scion of <a href="Bayard%20family">an old political family</a> in Delaware and had represented his state in the United States Senate since 1869. As one of a relative handful of conservative Democrats in the Senate at the time, Bayard began his career opposing vigorously, if ineffectively, the Republican majority's plans for the <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a> of the Southern states after the Civil War. Like Tilden, Bayard supported the gold standard and had a reputation for honesty. At the 1876 convention, Bayard had placed a distant fifth in the balloting, but supported Tilden's cause in the general election, speaking on his behalf around the country. The political friendship between the two quickly soured in the election's aftermath as Bayard supported the Electoral Commission and Tilden opposed it. Bayard believed the commission was the only alternative to civil war, and served as one of the Democratic members; Tilden took this as a personal betrayal.

In the four years that followed, Bayard sought to build support for another run at the nomination. He and Tilden competed for support among Eastern conservatives because of their support for the gold standard. The gold standard was less popular in the South, but there Bayard stacked his years-long advocacy in the Senate for pro-Southern conservative policies against Tilden's <a href="political%20machine">political machine</a> and wealth in the contest for Southern delegates. A blow to Bayard's cause came in February 1880 when the "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28New%20York%29">New York Sun</a>", a newspaper friendly to Tilden, published a transcript of a speech Bayard made in <a href="Dover%2C%20Delaware">Dover, Delaware</a>, in 1861. As the states of the Deep South were seceding from the Union, a young Bayard had proclaimed "with this secession, or revolution, or rebellion, or by whatever name it may be called, the State of Delaware has naught to do", and urged that the South be permitted to withdraw from the Union in peace. To many in the South, this confirmed their view of Bayard as their champion, but paradoxically it weakened Bayard's support with other Southerners, who feared that a former <a href="Peace%20Democrat">Peace Democrat</a> would never be acceptable to Northerners. At the same time, Bayard's uncompromising stance on the money question pushed some Democrats to support Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, who had not been identified with either extreme in the gold–silver debate and had a military record that appealed to Northerners. As the convention opened, Bayard was still among the leading candidates, but was far from certain of victory.

<a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a> represented an unusual confluence in the post-war nation: a man who believed in the Democratic Party's principles of states' rights and limited government, but whose anti-secessionist sentiment was unimpeachable. A native of Pennsylvania, Hancock graduated from the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> at <a href="West%20Point%2C%20New%20York">West Point</a> in 1844 and began a forty-year career as a soldier. He served with distinction in the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a> and in the antebellum peacetime army. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Hancock remained loyal to the Union. He was promoted to <a href="Brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a> in 1861 and placed in command of a brigade in the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a>. In the <a href="Peninsula%20Campaign">Peninsula Campaign</a> of 1862, he led a critical counterattack and earned the nickname "Hancock the Superb" from his commander, Major General <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan">George B. McClellan</a>. At <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Antietam</a>, he led a division in the Union victory and was promoted to major general. Hancock's shining moment came at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a> when he organized the scattered troops, rallied defenses, and was wounded on the third day as his troops turned back <a href="Pickett%27s%20Charge">Pickett's Charge</a>.

Since 1864, when he received a single unsolicited vote at the Democratic National Convention, Hancock had been a perennial candidate. As military governor of <a href="Fifth%20Military%20District">Louisiana and Texas</a> in 1867, Hancock had won the respect of the white conservative population by issuing his General Order Number 40, in which he stated that if the residents of the district conducted themselves peacefully and the civilian officials performed their duties, then "the military power should cease to lead, and the civil administration resume its natural and rightful dominion." He had a larger following at <a href="1868%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">the 1868 convention</a>, finishing as high as second place in some rounds of balloting. In 1876, Hancock again drew a considerable following, but never finished higher than third place at <a href="1876%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">that year's convention</a>. In 1880, another Hancock boom began, this time centered mostly in the South. In March of that year, the "<a href="The%20Times-Picayune">New Orleans Picayune</a>" ran an editorial that called for the general's nomination, partly for who he was—a war hero with conservative political principles—and partly for who he was not—a known partisan of either side of the monetary or tariff debates. As Tilden and Bayard rose and fell in the estimation of Democratic voters, Hancock's bid for nomination gathered steam. Some were unsure whether, after eight years of Grant, himself a former general, the party would be wise to give the nomination to another "man on horseback", but Hancock remained among the leading contenders as the convention began that June.

Several other candidates arrived in Cincinnati with delegates pledged to them. Former Representative <a href="Henry%20B.%20Payne">Henry B. Payne</a>, an Ohio millionaire, had gathered a number of former Tilden supporters to his cause. Payne was a corporate lawyer and hard money advocate, but also a relative unknown outside Ohio. In April 1880, the "<a href="New%20York%20Star%20%281800s%20newspaper%29">New York Star</a>" published a tale that Tilden had bowed out of the race and instructed the Irving Hall faction to back Payne for the presidency. Tilden never confirmed the rumor, but after his letter of June 1880 to the New York delegation, many of his supporters did consider Payne among their likely choices. Payne, like Bayard, had served on the Electoral Commission of 1876, but had nevertheless maintained Tilden's friendship. He maintained his loyalty to Tilden until the convention, when his withdrawal was certain. Payne was hindered by a fellow Ohioan, Senator <a href="Allen%20G.%20Thurman">Allen G. Thurman</a>, who controlled their home state's delegation. Thurman looked like a natural successor to Tilden, as a popular conservative from a swing state with a background as an attorney, but he, like Bayard, had earned Tilden's enmity by serving on the Electoral Commission. Thurman was also less wedded to the gold standard than some Northeastern delegates would tolerate.

Another would-be heir to Tilden was <a href="Samuel%20J.%20Randall">Samuel J. Randall</a>, since 1863 a congressman from <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. Like Tilden, Randall was conservative on the money question but, unusually for a Democrat, he supported high tariffs to protect American industry. He also advocated legislation to reduce the power of monopolies. Tilden had supported Randall in his quest to become Speaker of the House, and Randall returned the favor by remaining a loyal Tilden man up to the convention. He now hoped for the support of the former Tilden adherents in his quest for the presidency. Former Governor <a href="Thomas%20A.%20Hendricks">Thomas A. Hendricks</a> of Indiana, Tilden's 1876 running mate, also sought a claim on the previous nominee's support. He came from a crucial swing state that the Democrats had narrowly carried in 1876 and had some support in the Midwestern states. His popularity with delegates from the Northeast was impaired by his views on the currency question; he sided with those who wanted looser money.

Two candidates stood with rather less support. <a href="William%20Ralls%20Morrison">William Ralls Morrison</a> of Illinois had served in Congress since 1873 and was best known for advocating tariff reductions despite hailing from a protectionist district. He commanded little support outside his home state, and was seen as only a <a href="favorite%20son">favorite son</a>. Justice <a href="Stephen%20Johnson%20Field">Stephen Johnson Field</a> of the United States Supreme Court was better known, but still an unlikely victor. The only candidate from the Far West, Field was respected as a scholar of the law, but had greatly diminished his chances with his home state of California by striking down <a href="Pigtail%20Ordinance">anti-Chinese legislation</a> in that state in 1879. Even so, some observers, including <a href="Edwards%20Pierrepont">Edwards Pierrepont</a>, considered Field a likely choice for the nomination.

The delegates assembled on June 22, 1880, at Cincinnati's <a href="Cincinnati%20Music%20Hall">Music Hall</a>. The venue was a large, red brick building in the <a href="Gothic%20revival%20architecture">High Victorian Gothic</a> style, which had opened in 1878. Intended, as the name suggests, for musical performances, the hall also functioned as Cincinnati's convention center until a separate building was constructed in 1967. <a href="William%20Henry%20Barnum">William Henry Barnum</a> of <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, the chairman of the <a href="Democratic%20National%20Committee">Democratic National Committee</a>, called the convention to order at 12:38 p.m. An opening prayer was presented by <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> minister <a href="Charles%20William%20Wendte">Charles William Wendte</a>. Then, <a href="George%20Hoadly">George Hoadly</a>, a Tilden associate and future governor of Ohio, was elected temporary chairman. Hoadly addressed the crowd, then adjourned the convention until 10:00 a.m. the next day, so that the Committee on Credentials could consider certain disputes among the delegates.

At the start of the second day, June 23, the Committee on Permanent Organization announced the roster of officers, including the permanent president, <a href="John%20W.%20Stevenson">John W. Stevenson</a> of <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. Before the delegates could formally elect Stevenson, they heard the report on the Committee on Credentials. Two rival factions of <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> Democrats had agreed to compromise, both being admitted as a united delegation. A similar dispute in New York was not resolved so easily: Tammany Hall and Tilden's Irving Hall had sent rival delegations as well, and neither was willing to compromise. The Committee had voted to consider the Irving Hall Democrats to have been regularly elected; Tammany was consequently excluded. Debate followed, in which some delegates urged compromise, with the idea that a united delegation would help unite the party in New York in the coming general election. The argument was unpersuasive, as the delegates endorsed the Committee's decision by a vote of 457 to 205½; Tammany was banished. Stevenson was then installed as permanent chairman and, as the Committee on Resolutions had not finished writing the platform, the delegates moved on to nominations.

The clerk called the roll of states alphabetically. The first delegation to nominate a candidate was California. <a href="John%20Edgar%20McElrath">John Edgar McElrath</a>, an <a href="Oakland%2C%20California">Oakland</a> attorney, rose to nominate Justice Stephen J. Field. Extolling Field's virtues and learning, McElrath promised that, if nominated, "he will sweep California like the winds that blow through her Golden Gate." <a href="George%20Gray%20%28senator%29">George Gray</a>, Delaware's <a href="Delaware%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> and a future United States Senator, next nominated Thomas F. Bayard. Gray, in a speech that evinced his admiration for the Senator, said of Bayard:
Illinois was the next state to offer a name, as former Representative <a href="Samuel%20S.%20Marshall">Samuel S. Marshall</a> rose to submit that of his erstwhile colleague, William R. Morrison. Marshall immediately antagonized the South by comparing Morrison to <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, and proclaimed that Morrison's belief in tariff reduction would be a "tower of strength" in the election.

Next, Senator <a href="Daniel%20W.%20Voorhees">Daniel W. Voorhees</a> of Indiana spoke on behalf of Thomas A. Hendricks, praising Hendricks as a candidate of national unity: "[T]o the South, who has been more faithful? To the North, who has been truer? To the East, who has been better, wiser, more conservative and more faithful? And to the West I need not appeal, for he is our own son." The next few states made no nominations. When the roll reached New York, there were cries from the crowd for Tilden, and some confusion when that state's delegation made no nomination.

The next nomination came from Ohio, as <a href="John%20McSweeney%20%28lawyer%29">John McSweeney</a> made the case for Senator Allen G. Thurman. "Great in genius, correct in judgment," as McSweeney described him in a lengthy speech, Thurman was "of unrivaled eloquence in defense of the right, with a spotless name, he stands forth as a born leader of the people." Next came the Pennsylvania delegation, from which <a href="Daniel%20Dougherty">Daniel Dougherty</a> rose. Dougherty, a Philadelphia lawyer, gave a short and effective speech in favor of Winfield Scott Hancock.

As Dougherty finished his speech, delegates and spectators shouted loudly for Hancock. After five minutes, the cheers subsided. Senator <a href="Wade%20Hampton%20III">Wade Hampton III</a> of <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, a former <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> general, next spoke to praise Hancock, saying "we of the South would feel safe in his hands", but said that Bayard was ultimately his choice "because we believe he is the strongest man". <a href="Richard%20B.%20Hubbard">Richard B. Hubbard</a>, a former governor of Texas and Confederate soldier, spoke in favor Hancock as his state seconded the Pennsylvanian's nomination. Hubbard praised Hancock's conduct as military governor of Texas and Louisiana, saying, "in our hour of sorrow, when he held his power at the hands of the great dominant Republican party ... there stood a man with the constitution before him, reading it as the fathers read it; that the war having ended we resumed the habiliments that as a right belong to us, not as a conquered province, but as a free people." The last few states were called and the nominations ended. After a motion to adjourn failed, the delegates proceeded directly to the balloting.

The clerk called the roll of the states again, and a band played "<a href="Yankee%20Doodle">Yankee Doodle</a>" and "<a href="Dixie%20%28song%29">Dixie</a>" as the ballots were tallied. The results showed that the delegates had scattered their ballots to a variety of candidates, with no one close to the 492 necessary to nominate (at that time, Democratic conventions required a two-thirds majority for nomination). There was a clear delineation, however, as Hancock and Bayard, with 171 and 158½ respectively, were far ahead of the pack. The next closest, Payne, had less than half of Hancock's number, with 81. After one minor shift of ½ ballot, the totals were announced to the delegates. They voted to adjourn for the day, clearing the way for the off-site negotiations that would influence the next day's ballot.

The delegates assembled the next day, June 24, to resume the balloting. Before that could begin, <a href="Rufus%20Wheeler%20Peckham">Rufus Wheeler Peckham</a> of the New York delegation produced Tilden's letter and read it to the crowd. The first mention of Tilden's name provoked excitement, but the meaning of the message soon quieted the crowd. Peckham announced that, with Tilden's withdrawal, New York, now supported Samuel J. Randall. Moving then to the second ballot, more than one hundred delegates followed Peckham's lead in voting for Randall, boosting his total to 128½, just above Bayard's 112. But the shift to Hancock had been greater. Before the totals were announced to the crowd, Hancock had gathered 320 delegates to him; as soon as the voting stopped, however, <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, and <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> changed all of their votes to Hancock. Pennsylvania added those of their votes that were not already for Hancock. Then <a href="Smith%20M.%20Weed">Smith M. Weed</a> of New York, a Tilden confidante, announced that his state, too, would shift all of its 70 votes to Hancock. After that, according to the party records, "every delegate was on his feet and the roar of ten thousand voices completely drowned the full military band in the gallery."

Nearly all of the remaining states now stampeded for Hancock. When the second vote was finally tallied, Hancock had 705. Only Indiana refrained completely from joining in, casting its 30 votes for Hendricks; two Bayard voters from <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> and one Tilden man from <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a> were the remaining hold-outs. After the second round was tallied, the nomination was made unanimous. Several delegates then spoke to praise Hancock and promise that he would triumph in the coming election. Even Tammany's John Kelly was permitted to speak. Kelly pledged his faction's loyalty to the party, saying, "Let us unite as a band of brothers and look upon each other kindly and favorably."
<nowiki>*</nowiki> The candidate was not formally nominated.

Turning to other matters, the delegates listened as <a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony">Susan B. Anthony</a> addressed them with a plea for <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a>. The delegates took no action, and moved on to the platform, which <a href="Henry%20Watterson">Henry Watterson</a> of Kentucky read aloud. The spirit of unanimity continued as the delegates approved it without dissent. The platform was, in the words of historian Herbert J. Clancy, "deliberately vague and general" on some points, designed to appeal to the largest number possible. In it, they pledged to work for "constitutional doctrines and traditions," to oppose centralization, to favor "honest money consisting of gold and silver", a "tariff for revenue only", and to put an end to <a href="History%20of%20Chinese%20Americans">Chinese immigration</a>. Most of this was uncontroversial, but the "tariff for revenue only" would become a major point of debate in the coming campaign.

Finally, the delegates turned to the vice presidency. <a href="Edmund%20Pettus">Edmund Pettus</a>, representing <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, moved the nomination of <a href="William%20Hayden%20English">William Hayden English</a>, a banker and former representative from Indiana. English, a member of the Indiana delegation, was fairly unknown to most delegates. He had been a Bayard enthusiast and was known as a successful businessman and hard money supporter; more crucially, he hailed from an important swing state. While Hendricks was a better-known representative of Indiana, Easterners in the party preferred English, who they saw as sounder on the money question. Several states seconded the nomination. <a href="John%20P.%20Irish">John P. Irish</a> of Iowa nominated former governor <a href="Richard%20M.%20Bishop">Richard M. Bishop</a> of Ohio but, after all the other states expressed support for English, the Ohio delegation requested that Bishop's name be withdrawn and English's nomination made unanimous; the motion carried.

Keeping with the custom at the time, Hancock did not campaign personally, but stayed at his post at <a href="Fort%20Columbus">Fort Columbus</a> on <a href="Governors%20Island">Governors Island</a>, in <a href="New%20York%20Harbor">New York Harbor</a> and met with visitors there (as General Grant had in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201868">1868</a>, Hancock remained on active duty throughout the campaign). Both parties' campaigns began with a focus on the candidates rather than the issues. Democratic newspapers attacked the Republican nominee, <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a> of Ohio, over rumors of corruption and self-dealing in the <a href="Cr%C3%A9dit%20Mobilier%20of%20America%20scandal">Crédit Mobilier affair</a>, among others. Republicans characterized Hancock as uninformed on the issues, and some of his former comrades-in-arms gave critical speeches regarding his character. Democrats never made clear what about their victory would improve the nation; Hancock biographer David M. Jordan later characterized their message as simply "our man is better than your man".

Both parties knew that, with the end of Reconstruction and the <a href="Disfranchisement%20after%20the%20Reconstruction%20Era">disenfranchisement of black Southerners</a>, the <a href="Solid%20South">South would be solid</a> for Hancock, netting 137 electoral votes of the 185 needed for victory. To this, the Democrats needed only add a few of the closely balanced Northern states; New York (35 electoral votes) and Indiana (15) were two of their main targets, but New Jersey and the Midwestern states were also battlegrounds. Early in the campaign, Republicans used their standard tactic of "<a href="waving%20the%20bloody%20shirt">waving the bloody shirt</a>", that is, reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for <a href="Secession%20in%20the%20United%20States">secession</a> and four years of civil war, and that if they held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate veterans pensions out of the federal treasury. With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war, and Union generals at the head of both tickets, the bloody shirt was of less effect than it had been in the past.

By October, Republicans shifted to a new issue: the tariff. Seizing on the Democratic platform's call for a "tariff for revenue only", Republicans told Northern workers that a Hancock presidency would weaken the tariff protection that kept them in good jobs. Hancock made the situation worse when, attempting to strike a moderate stance, he said "the tariff question is a local question". The answer seemed only to reinforce the Republicans' characterization of him as ignorant of the issues. In the end, fewer than two thousand votes separated the two candidates, but in the Electoral College, Garfield had an easy victory over Hancock, 214 to 155.

Sarcoscypha coccinea

Sarcoscypha coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet elf cup, scarlet elf cap, or the scarlet cup, is a species of <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the family <a href="Sarcoscyphaceae">Sarcoscyphaceae</a> of the order <a href="Pezizales">Pezizales</a>. The fungus, widely distributed in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, has been found in Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America, and Australia. The <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus "<a href="Sarcoscypha">Sarcoscypha</a>", "S. coccinea" has been known by many names since its first appearance in the scientific literature in 1772. <a href="Phylogenetic">Phylogenetic</a> analysis shows the species to be most closely related to other "Sarcoscypha" species that contain numerous small oil droplets in their <a href="spore">spore</a>s, such as the North Atlantic island species "<a href="Sarcoscypha%20macaronesica">S. macaronesica</a>". Due to similar physical appearances and sometimes overlapping distributions, "S. coccinea" has often been confused with "<a href="Sarcoscypha%20occidentalis">S. occidentalis</a>", "<a href="Sarcoscypha%20austriaca">S. austriaca</a>", and "<a href="Sarcoscypha%20dudleyi">S. dudleyi</a>".

The <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a> fungus grows on decaying sticks and branches in damp spots on forest floors, generally buried under <a href="forest%20floor">leaf litter</a> or in the soil. The cup-shaped <a href="Ascocarp">fruit bodies</a> are usually produced during the cooler months of winter and early spring. The brilliant red interior of the cups—from which both the <a href="common%20name">common</a> and scientific names are derived—contrasts with the lighter-colored exterior. The <a href="edible%20mushroom">edibility</a> of the fruit bodies is not clearly established, but its small size, tough texture and insubstantial fruitings would dissuade most people from collecting for the table. The fungus has been used medicinally by the <a href="Oneida%20people">Oneida</a> Native Americans, and also as a colorful component of table decorations in England. "Molliardiomyces eucoccinea" is the name given to the <a href="fungi%20imperfecti">imperfect</a> form of the fungus that lacks a <a href="Sexual%20reproduction">sexually reproductive</a> stage in its <a href="Biological%20life%20cycle">life cycle</a>.

The species was originally named "Helvella coccinea" by the Italian naturalist <a href="Giovanni%20Antonio%20Scopoli">Giovanni Antonio Scopoli</a> in 1772. Other early names include "Peziza coccinea" (<a href="Nikolaus%20Joseph%20von%20Jacquin">Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin</a>, 1774) and "Peziza dichroa" (<a href="Johan%20Theodor%20Holmskjold">Theodor Holmskjold</a>, 1799). Although some authors in older literature have applied the generic name "<a href="Plectania">Plectania</a>" to the taxon following <a href="Karl%20Wilhelm%20Gottlieb%20Leopold%20Fuckel">Karl Fuckel</a>'s 1870 name change (e.g. Seaver, 1928; Kanouse, 1948; Nannfeldt, 1949; Le Gal, 1953), that name is now used for a fungus with brownish-black fruit bodies. "Sarcoscypha coccinea" was given its current name by <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20%C3%89mil%20Lambotte">Jean Baptiste Émil Lambotte</a> in 1889. Obligate <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonyms</a> (different names for the same species based on one <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type</a>) include "Lachnea coccinea" <a href="Claude%20Casimir%20Gillet">Gillet</a> (1880), "Macroscyphus coccineus" <a href="Samuel%20Frederick%20Gray">Gray</a> (1821), and "Peziza dichroa" <a href="Johan%20Theodor%20Holmskjold">Holmskjold</a> (1799). <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">Taxonomic</a> synonyms (different names for the same species, based on different types) include "Peziza aurantia" <a href="Heinrich%20Christian%20Friedrich%20Schumacher">Schumacher</a> (1803), "Peziza aurantiaca" <a href="Christiaan%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Persoon</a> (1822), "Peziza coccinea" <a href="Nikolaus%20Joseph%20von%20Jacquin">Jacquin</a> (1774), "Helvella coccinea" <a href="Jacob%20Christian%20Sch%C3%A4ffer">Schaeffer</a> (1774), "Lachnea coccinea" <a href="William%20Phillips%20%28botanist%29">Phillips</a> (1887), "Geopyxis coccinea" <a href="George%20Edward%20Massee">Massee</a> (1895), "Sarcoscypha coccinea" <a href="Pier%20Andrea%20Saccardo">Saccardo</a> ex <a href="Elias%20Judah%20Durand">Durand</a> (1900), "Plectania coccinea" (<a href="Karl%20Wilhelm%20Gottlieb%20Leopold%20Fuckel">Fuckel</a> ex <a href="Fred%20Jay%20Seaver">Seaver</a>), and "Peziza cochleata" <a href="August%20Batsch">Batsch</a> (1783).

"Sarcoscypha coccinea" is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus "Sarcoscypha", having been first explicitly designated as such in 1931 by <a href="Frederick%20Clements">Frederick Clements</a> and <a href="Cornelius%20Lott%20Shear">Cornelius Lott Shear</a>. A 1990 publication revealed that the genus name "Sarcoscypha" had been used previously by <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Philipp%20von%20Martius">Carl F. P. von Martius</a> as the name of a <a href="tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a> in the genus "<a href="Peziza">Peziza</a>"; according to the rules of <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Botanical%20Nomenclature">Botanical Nomenclature</a>, this meant that the generic name "Peziza" had priority over "Sarcoscypha". To address the <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomical</a> dilemma, the genus name "Sarcoscypha" was <a href="conserved%20name">conserved</a> against "Peziza", with "S. coccinea" as the type species, to "avoid the creation of a new generic name for the scarlet cups and also to avoid the disadvantageous loss of a generic name widely used in the popular and scientific literature". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "coccinea" is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word meaning "deep red". The species is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the "scarlet elf cup", the "scarlet elf cap", or the "scarlet cup fungus".

"S. coccinea" var. "jurana" was described by <a href="Jean%20Louis%20%C3%89mile%20Boudier">Jean Boudier</a> (1903) as a <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> of the species having a brighter and more orange-colored fruit body, and with flattened or blunt-ended ascospores. Today it is known as the distinct species "<a href="Sarcoscypha%20jurana">S. jurana</a>". "S. coccinea" var. "albida", named by <a href="George%20Edward%20Massee">George Edward Massee</a> in 1903 (as "Geopyxis coccinea" var. "albida"), has a cream-colored rather than red interior surface, but is otherwise identical to the typical variety.
Within the large area that includes the <a href="temperate%20climate">temperate</a> to <a href="alpine%20climate">alpine</a>-<a href="boreal%20ecosystem">boreal</a> zone of the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a> (Europe and North America), only "S. coccinea" had been recognized until the 1980s. However, it had been known since the early 1900s that there existed several macroscopically indistinguishable <a href="taxon">taxa</a> with various microscopic differences: the distribution and number of oil droplets in fresh spores; <a href="germination">germination</a> behavior; and spore shape. Detailed analysis and comparison of fresh specimens revealed that what had been collectively called ""S. coccinea"" actually consisted of four distinct species: "S. austriaca", "S. coccinea", "S. dudleyi", and "S. jurana".

The <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> relationships in the genus "Sarcoscypha" were analyzed by Francis Harrington in the late 1990s. Her <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis combined comparisons of the <a href="Nucleic%20acid%20sequence">sequences</a> of the <a href="internal%20transcribed%20spacer">internal transcribed spacer</a> in the non-functional <a href="RNA">RNA</a> with fifteen traditional <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> characteristics, such as spore features, fruit body shape, and degree of curliness of the "hairs" that form the <a href="wikt%3Atomentum">tomentum</a>. Based on her analysis, "S. coccinea" is part of a <a href="clade">clade</a> that includes the species "S. austriaca", "S. macaronesica", "S. knixoniana" and "S. humberiana". All of these "Sarcoscypha" species have numerous, small oil droplets in their spores. Its closest relative, "S. macaronesica", is found on the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> and <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>; Harrington hypothesized that the <a href="most%20recent%20common%20ancestor">most recent common ancestor</a> of the two species originated in Europe and was later dispersed to the <a href="Macaronesia">Macaronesian islands</a>.

Initially spherical, the <a href="ascocarp">fruit bodies</a> are later shallowly saucer- or cup-shaped with rolled-in rims, and measure in diameter. The inner surface of the cup is deep red (fading to orange when dry) and smooth, while the outer surface is whitish and covered with a dense matted layer of tiny hairs (a <a href="wikt%3Atomentum">tomentum</a>). The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>, when present, is stout and up to long (if deeply buried) by thick, and whitish, with a tomentum. Color variants of the fungus exist that have reduced or absent pigmentation; these forms may be orange, yellow, or even white (as in the variety "albida"). In the Netherlands, white fruit bodies have been found growing in the <a href="polder">polder</a>s.

"Sarcoscypha coccinea" is one of several fungi whose fruit bodies have been noted to make a "puffing" sound—an audible manifestation of spore-discharge where thousands of asci simultaneously explode to release a cloud of spores.

<a href="Spore">Spore</a>s are 26–40 by 10–12 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>, elliptical, smooth, <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent), and have small <a href="lipid">lipid</a> droplets concentrated at either end. The droplets are refractive to light and visible with <a href="light%20microscopy">light microscopy</a>. In older, dried specimens (such as <a href="herbarium">herbarium</a> material), the droplets may <a href="Coalescence%20%28chemistry%29">coalesce</a> and hinder the identification of species. Depending on their geographical origin, the spores may have a delicate <a href="mucilage">mucilaginous</a> sheath or "envelope"; European specimens are devoid of an envelope while specimens from North America invariably have one.

The <a href="ascus">asci</a> are long and cylindrical, and taper into a short stem-like base; they measure 300–375 by 14–16 µm. Although in most <a href="Pezizales">Pezizales</a> all of the ascospores are formed simultaneously through delimitation by an inner and outer membrane, in "S. coccinea" the ascospores located in the basal parts of the ascus develop faster. The <a href="paraphyses">paraphyses</a> (sterile filamentous hyphae present in the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>) are about 3 µm wide (and only slightly thickened at the apex), and contain red pigment <a href="granule%20%28cell%20biology%29">granules</a>.

Anamorphic or <a href="fungi%20imperfecti">imperfect fungi</a> are those that seem to lack a sexual stage in their <a href="biological%20life%20cycle">life cycle</a>, and typically reproduce by the process of <a href="mitosis">mitosis</a> in structures called <a href="conidium">conidia</a>. In some cases, the sexual stage—or <a href="teleomorph%2C%20anamorph%20and%20holomorph">teleomorph</a> stage—is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Nomenclature%20for%20algae%2C%20fungi%2C%20and%20plants">International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants</a> permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organism, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The name of the anamorphic state of "S. coccinea" is "Molliardiomyces eucoccinea", first described by <a href="Marin%20Molliard">Marin Molliard</a> in 1904. Molliard found the growth of the conidia to resemble those of the genera "<a href="Coryne%20%28fungus%29">Coryne</a>" and "<a href="Chlorosplenium">Chlorosplenium</a>" rather than the <a href="Pezizaceae">Pezizaceae</a>, and he considered that this suggested an affinity between "Sarcoscypha" and the family <a href="Helvellaceae">Helvellaceae</a>. In 1972, <a href="John%20W.%20Paden">John W. Paden</a> again described the anamorph, but like Molliard, failed to give a complete description of the species. In 1984, Paden created a new genus he named "Molliardiomyces" to contain the anamorphic forms of several "Sarcoscypha" species, and set "Molliardiomyces eucoccinea" as the type species. This form produces colorless <a href="conidiophore">conidiophore</a>s (specialized stalks that bear <a href="conidia">conidia</a>) that are usually irregularly branched, measuring 30–110 by 3.2–4.7 µm. The conidia are <a href="ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a>al to egg-shaped, smooth, translucent (<a href="hyaline">hyaline</a>), and 4.8–16.0 by 2.3–5.8 µm; they tend to accumulate in "mucilaginous masses".

Similar species include "<a href="Sarcoscypha%20dudleyi">S. dudleyi</a>" and "<a href="Sarcoscypha%20austriaca">S. austriaca</a>", and in the literature, confusion amongst the three is common. Examination of microscopic features is often required to definitively differentiate between the species. "<a href="Sarcoscypha%20occidentalis">Sarcoscypha occidentalis</a>" has smaller cups (0.5–2.0 cm wide), a more pronounced stalk that is 1–3 cm long, and a smooth exterior surface. Unlike "S. coccinea", it is only found in the New World and in east and midwest North America, but not in the far west. It also occurs in Central America and the Caribbean. In North America, "S. austriaca" and "S. dudleyi" are found in eastern regions of the continent. "S. dudleyi" has elliptical spores with rounded ends that are 25–33 by 12–14 µm and completely sheathed when fresh. "S. austriaca" has elliptical spores that are 29–36 by 12–15 µm that are not completely sheathed when fresh, but have small polar caps on either end. The <a href="Macaronesia">Macaronesia</a>n species "<a href="Sarcoscypha%20macaronesica">S. macaronesica</a>", frequently misidentified as "S. coccinea", has smaller spores, typically measuring 20.5–28 by 7.3–11 µm and smaller fruit bodies—up to wide.

A <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a> species, "Sarcoscypha coccinea" grows on decaying woody material from various plants: the <a href="Rosaceae">rose family</a>, <a href="beech">beech</a>, <a href="hazel">hazel</a>, <a href="willow">willow</a>, <a href="elm">elm</a>, and, in the Mediterranean, <a href="oak">oak</a>. The fruit bodies of "S. coccinea" are often found growing singly or clustered in groups on buried or partly buried sticks in <a href="deciduous%20forest">deciduous forest</a>s. A Hungarian study noted that the fungus was found mainly on twigs of <a href="European%20hornbeam">European hornbeam</a> ("Carpinus betulus") that were typically less than long. Fruit bodies growing on sticks above the ground tend to be smaller than those on buried wood. Mushrooms that are sheltered from wind also grow larger than their more exposed counterparts. The fruit bodies are persistent and may last for several weeks if the weather is cool. The time required for the development of fruit bodies has been estimated to be about 24 weeks, although it was noted that "the maximum life span may well be more than 24 weeks because the decline of the colonies seemed to be associated more with sunny, windy weather rather than with old age." One <a href="field%20guide">field guide</a> calls the fungus "a welcome sight after a long, desperate winter and ... the harbinger of a new year of mushrooming."

Common over much of the Northern Hemisphere, "S. coccinea" occurs in the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwest</a>, in the valleys between the Pacific coast, the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a>, and the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a>. Its North American distribution extends north to various locations in Canada and south to the Mexican state <a href="Jalisco">Jalisco</a>. The fungus has also been collected from Chile in South America. It is also found in the <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a>—Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and India. Specimens collected from the Macaronesian islands that once thought to be "S. coccinea" were later determined to be the distinct species "S. macaronesica". A 1995 study of the occurrence of British "Sarcoscypha" (including "S. coccinea" and "S. austriaca") concluded that "S. coccinea" was becoming very rare in Great Britain. All species of "Sarcoscypha", including "S. coccinea", are <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">Red-Listed</a> in Europe. In Turkey, it is considered <a href="critically%20endangered">critically endangered</a>.

The red color of the fruit bodies is caused by five types of <a href="carotenoid">carotenoid</a> pigments, including <a href="plectaniaxanthin">plectaniaxanthin</a> and <a href="Beta-Carotene">β-carotene</a>. Carotenoids are lipid-soluble and are stored within granules in the paraphyses. British-Canadian mycologist <a href="Arthur%20Henry%20Reginald%20Buller">Arthur Henry Reginald Buller</a> suggested that pigments in fruit bodies exposed to the Sun absorb some of the Sun's rays, raising the temperature of the hymenium—hastening the development of the ascus and subsequent spore discharge.

<a href="Lectin">Lectin</a>s are sugar-binding <a href="protein">protein</a>s that are used in <a href="blood%20typing">blood typing</a>, biochemical studies and medical research. A lectin has been purified and characterized from "S. coccinea" fruit bodies that can bind selectively to several specific <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a> molecules, including <a href="lactose">lactose</a>.

"Sarcoscypha coccinea" was used as a medicinal fungus by the <a href="Oneida%20people">Oneida</a> Indians, and possibly by other tribes of the <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois</a> Six Nations. The fungus, after being dried and ground up into a powder, was applied as a <a href="styptic">styptic</a>, particularly to the navels of newborn children that were not healing properly after the <a href="umbilical%20cord">umbilical cord</a> had been severed. Pulverized fruit bodies were also kept under bandages made of soft-tanned deerskin. In <a href="Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Scarborough, England</a>, the fruit bodies used to be arranged with moss and leaves and sold as a table decoration.

The species is said to be <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, inedible, or "not recommended", depending on the author. Although its insubstantial fruit body and low numbers do not make it particularly suitable for the table, one source claims "children in <a href="Jura%20Mountains">the Jura</a> are said to eat it raw on bread and butter; and one French author suggests adding the cups, with a little <a href="Kirsch">Kirsch</a>, to a fresh fruit salad." The fruit bodies have been noted to be a source of food for rodents in the winter, and slugs in the summer.

Made in the Dark

Made in the Dark is the third studio album by English <a href="indietronica">indietronica</a> band <a href="Hot%20Chip">Hot Chip</a>. The album, comprising 13 songs, was released on 4 February 2008 on the <a href="EMI">EMI</a> label. It peaked at number four on the <a href="UK%20Album%20Chart">UK Album Chart</a>, number 25 on the Australian album charts, and entered at number 109 on the U.S. <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. Several singles have been released from the album, including "<a href="Shake%20a%20Fist">Shake a Fist</a>", "<a href="Ready%20for%20the%20Floor">Ready for the Floor</a>", which reached number six on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>, and "<a href="One%20Pure%20Thought">One Pure Thought</a>".

A defining feature of the album is the strong presence of romantic ballads. The ballad "Made in the Dark" was described as "sublime" by one critic, although not all the ballads received universal praise. <a href="Alexis%20Taylor">Alexis Taylor</a>, the main contributor to the lyrics, stated that he was proud of the album lyrically and felt that feelings of love and happiness, partly the result of his recent marriage, had contributed to the album's romantic tone.

Critics stated that songs such as "Ready for the Floor" and "Bendable Poseable" were reminiscent of their previous release, "<a href="The%20Warning%20%28Hot%20Chip%20album%29">The Warning</a>". The style of the album was not considered as big a leap forward as the changes evident between "Coming on Strong" (2004) to "The Warning" (2006). It was said that Hot Chip had honed their music by using quirks of their musical style to make more accomplished music, however, some critics felt that the album lacked focus, containing too many varied elements; it was described as "loveable but flawed".

Hot Chip often record their music in a bedroom. However, the band took a different approach in recording "Made in the Dark" to make it sound "not quite so homemade". Recording took place in a variety of locations, including in-studio and live venues, to make "different acoustic spaces to be obvious to the listener". Lead vocalist <a href="Alexis%20Taylor">Alexis Taylor</a> said there was tension between the band's members, as the band did not want to continue creating music in the same way, but also did not want to "throw away a songwriting and production partnership that has worked before." Taylor and vocalist Joe Goddard worked on some of the songs together. Several songs were <a href="overdubbing">overdubbed</a> with parts of the rest of the band playing.

In regards to editing, Taylor said that Hot Chip have "never really been too good at bothering to get rid of little imperfections in the music"; he felt they added personality and said that "it's good not to be too dogmatic about it if that's what suits the song". Hot Chip used a variety of vocal structures, including layered vocals, where two takes of the same vocals were added together, changed by idiosyncrasies from the way it had been sung, and the doubling of a single performance, shifted out of beat.

Drummer Felix Martin said "Made in the Dark" was a "true group effort". The process began with Taylor and Goddard creating lyrics, then Goddard would produce parts of tracks, which Alexis would then add "lyrical content and melodies and so on that he's thought of while he's on the bus or in the bath or wherever he happened to be". The other three members of Hot Chip, Owen Clarke, <a href="Al%20Doyle">Al Doyle</a>, and Felix Martin would then "have some influence on the way the songs are put together."

Some equipment used to create the album remained the same as previous albums—Goddard used Steinberg Cubase SX3 on his laptop and Doyle and Martin worked on songs using Apple Logic in their studio. To create the chorus for "<a href="Ready%20for%20the%20Floor">Ready for the Floor</a>", Goddard used plug-ins from Arturia, such as Moog Modular. He used two sound channels to control noise and melody, and placed the noise channel in Cubase and had it follow the melody, to make it "punchier". With "Bendable Poseable", Goddard recorded live percussion parts with a Shure Beta 57A mic going directly into Cubase and "fashioned them into a jittery, three-minute loop". This was emailed to Taylor, who then recorded the main vocals for the song. To create the beat in "<a href="Shake%20a%20Fist">Shake a Fist</a>" Martin used the Elektron Machinedrum.

Hot Chip enjoy being a live band and have said it is "something [they've] always tried to do". As the group contains "a lot of different types of musicianship", the band "have to be spontaneous whenever [they] can." Doyle, the guitarist, stated that Hot Chip change the original recordings when playing their music live. At the London-based studio called the Strongroom, "One Pure Thought", "Hold On" and "Shake a Fist" were recorded live, instead of <a href="multitrack%20recording">on multitrack</a>, and were subsequently pieced together. This was the first occasion that Hot Chip had recorded music in a studio environment.

Taylor described "Made in the Dark" as "a real mix of different things" and said that Hot Chip was "learning how to be a different kind of band" while making the album: 

In March 2008, Hot Chip re-recorded several songs from "Made in the Dark", with one of their "all-time heroes", <a href="Robert%20Wyatt">Robert Wyatt</a>. Doyle said the band had wanted it to happen "for ages" and that people would see it as a surprise <a href="collaboration">collaboration</a>. Taylor said, "I crave confusion and quite like people to be surprised. I try to do that in the words and music and try to be what people don't think we are. Robert is someone we have liked for much longer than people realise. We feel closer to people in a different field, age or era." The album features Emma Smith, who had previously joined with Hot Chip to play violin and saxophone on their first two albums.

In October 2007, <a href="MTV">MTV</a> reported that Hot Chip was planning to give "Ready for the Floor" to <a href="Kylie%20Minogue">Kylie Minogue</a>. Other reports incorrectly suggested that <a href="Hot%20Chip">Hot Chip</a> had written "Made in the Dark"'s second single, "Ready for the Floor" specifically for Minogue. Taylor explained that it was a misunderstanding; "It started because someone asked me if we would ever write for Kylie. I said that we'd been asked to write for her but we'd never got round to it. And I said if we had to give her one of our songs, "Ready for the Floor" would probably be the most suitable. From that, I got misquoted. We didn't write "Ready for the Floor" for Kylie, didn't send it to her and she never heard it."

After the first rumour circulated, Joe Goddard created a reverse rumour, saying that Minogue had written a track for Hot Chip. He told "<a href="NME">NME</a>", "Kylie wrote a song for us, She sent it through our management to us – it was totally bizarre. It was the beginnings of a track – I think she wrote it and just thought, 'This would be perfect for Hot Chip', or possibly for a collaboration. It's a crazy song. It's industrial and clanging and even has farmyard animal noises on it. It's the kind of music you'd never normally associate with Kylie. When I'm allowed to send it around it's going to change a few people's ideas about her. Maybe it's one for our next album, after "Made in the Dark"." Taylor later admitted that it was a joke created to fool people because the band were tired of people phoning them up to ask why Minogue had apparently rejected a song she did not hear. Goddard said, "We've been telling lots of lies and rumours about it because we found it quite funny."

In January 2010, Goddard stated that "at the beginning there was some contact. As I recall, we were going to do a session with one of her writers" but both Hot Chip and Minogue were too busy at the time. He added "there was a grain of truth in the beginning, but then it all snowballed into some big silly thing". When asked, in 2010, about giving a song to Minogue, he stated that it would be "amazing".

The album is influenced by music Goddard and Taylor listened to during their childhood and adolescence, such as <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a>'s "<a href="Sign%20o%27%20the%20Times%20%28album%29">Sign o' the Times</a>" and <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>' <a href="The%20Beatles%20%28album%29">self-titled album</a>. Taylor explained why Hot Chip's albums "go from one mood to another so readily", by saying "<a href="Eclecticism%20in%20music">Eclectic music</a> has been our first musical background" and that he and Goddard had different musical interests when they were younger. "Made in the Dark" is influenced by contemporary artists such as <a href="Black%20Dice">Black Dice</a> and <a href="Will%20Oldham">Will Oldham</a>. Taylor appreciated Oldham for his minimalism of "just <a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic guitar</a> and <a href="Pump%20organ">harmonium</a> and voice for the whole record" and wanted Hot Chip to emulate him.

In an interview with "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" in October 2007, Taylor said there would be an equal proportion of electronic elements to live material, as the band doesn't "do things by adding one thing and taking something else away". The album contained <a href="maximalist">maximalist</a> and <a href="minimalist">minimalist</a> songs; several tracks on the album were influenced by <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> and <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal music</a>, and the track "Wrestlers" started taking a new direction because the band was "wrestling with the idea of making an <a href="R.%20Kelly">R. Kelly</a> kind of slick R and B number" and ultimately "[sounded] more like <a href="Randy%20Newman">Randy Newman</a>'s "<a href="Short%20People">Short People</a>". He said, "if the press release says it's faster and rockier it doesn't account for the fact that there are more ballads on this record than any other record." Taylor said that feelings of <a href="happiness">happiness</a> and <a href="love">love</a> influenced the album's <a href="romance%20%28love%29">romantic</a> feel.

Goddard considered varying styles and influences a key factor in the band's music. He explained to "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" that creating music could be difficult because a member could introduce a different influence. Goddard and Doyle said that clashes and restlessness during recording led to "unpleasant" periods of silence, but ultimately thought the clashes created "something more interesting because you have these different voices and not one person dictating".

Martin told "<a href="The%20Georgia%20Straight">The Georgia Straight</a>" that the group are "afflicted with something akin to musical attention-deficit disorder" and said that the group "get bored quite easily [...] with [their] own records at times". He elaborated by saying that the group aren't "really interested in reproducing the same sound" because they don't find it exciting.

Taylor stated Hot Chip "didn't set out to make something with one mood" and that he thought the band's style of "jump[ing] all over the place stylistically" made sense as a record. In an interview with "The Georgia Straight", Martin expressed that Hot Chip didn't want to create a "'classic' record that would have a particular sound" as they wanted to make music that was "quite experimental and out-there". "Made in the Dark" was intended to represent the "whole live sound of the band" and they are "a band as much as originally having been a duo".

Taylor stated in an interview with "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" that he was "so proud of [the album] lyrically" and thought the song "Made in the Dark" contained the best lyrics he had ever written. Taylor explained that it was "very easy" for him to focus on the "more serious lyrics, like a love song very dear to [his] heart" but stated that "Wrestlers" was "equally as important and feels like a very different style of music than we have ever got down on record before." He discussed "Wrestlers" in the band's interview with "The Sun", explaining that the song is "musically and lyrically quite direct" because "it doesn't have thousands of layers", in contrast to the song "Bendable Poseable". The concept of the song "Wrestlers", originates from a <a href="text%20message">text message</a> from <a href="James%20Murphy%20%28electronic%20musician%29">James Murphy</a> of <a href="LCD%20Soundsystem">LCD Soundsystem</a>. After Doyle toured with Murphy, Murphy sent a text message that said, "Sorry you can't have Al back, I'll wrestle you for him. And I'll beat you because I'm bigger and stronger than you." Goddard explained that "the words in that song are about wrestling", and the band "have no doubt" that Murphy would defeat them in a wrestling fight.

The song "Ready for the Floor" contains an allusion to the 1989 film, "<a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%29">Batman</a>", with the line, "You're my number one guy". In an interview with "The Fader" magazine, Taylor said the reference was a result of thinking about the Batman film, which has many things that Taylor is fond of, such as the Prince soundtrack. He commented that sometimes those items "seep into what we're writing about" and said that he likes to reference "in an oblique way". He conjectured that he had included the line to say something to "everyone in the band, particularly to Joe [Goddard], 'You're my number one guy, why is there any problems between any of us?' "

"Shake a Fist" was written by Taylor after Goddard took a legal herbal substance during the <a href="Glastonbury%20Festival">Glastonbury Festival</a> which produced feelings akin to teleportation. Goddard said, "it was a brilliant time" and told Alexis to write down words to go with his experience. The song features a <a href="Sampling%20%28music%29">voice sample</a> from <a href="Todd%20Rundgren">Todd Rundgren</a>.

Darren Wall (Wallzo) and Owen Clarke designed the artwork after several graphical experiments. After the initial experimentation, Wall wanted to create a cover that was "more brooding and conservative" and formed a list of ideas that the band had responded positively to. The list included dual colour illustrations, circles, and <a href="verdigris">verdigris</a>—the green coating formed on copper during oxygenation. Wall amalgamated the ideas to create the image used on the album's cover, which was named "The Artifact". The image was embossed on metallic copper card to give a "tactile feel" that would imply the album was "an object rather than illustration-based design."

Several titles were considered during production, including "Shot Down in Flames" and "IV". The former was rejected because Martin thought it sounded like a title <a href="The%20Beta%20Band">The Beta Band</a> would use. Taylor supported the name "IV" because he liked "giving people the wrong impression all the time", and defended his opinion, saying "if [people] give us any time, they would see that we're very serious about comedy ... and serious things as well". The album was called "Made in the Dark" because it was a title the band agreed on. Taylor considered the eponymous track to be one of his favourite songs, and thought it was nice to name the album after a thoughtful song, in contrast to "<a href="Coming%20on%20Strong%20%28album%29">Coming on Strong</a>" and "The Warning", which he described as being "big, slightly jokey, macho phrases".

"Made in the Dark" charted for 23 weeks in over 10 different charts, entering the <a href="UK%20Album%20Chart">UK Album Chart</a> at number four, the <a href="Billboard%20charts%23top">"Billboard" Top Heatseekers</a> chart at number one and the <a href="Dance/Electronic%20Albums">"Billboard" Top Electronic Albums</a> chart at number two. The album, according to <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a> data reported by "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>", has sold 47,000 copies and has been certified Gold for UK sales.

"Shake a Fist", the first single to be released from the album, was released on 12" <a href="vinyl%20single">vinyl single</a> at the beginning of October 2007 but did not chart. The second single released, "Ready for the Floor", charted for 24 weeks in five different charts, peaking at number six on the UK Singles Top 75.

In January 2008, in order to promote "Made in the Dark", Hot Chip "locked [themselves] away" to practice in anticipation of an American tour, where material from their new album would be played. The band are not accustomed to such an intensive rehearsal regime, as they "usually just rehearse for two days and then go on tour".

The critical reception to the album was generally favourable. Based on 40 reviews, review aggregate website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> reported a rating of 78 out of 100. There were mixed comments about the ballads; two reviewers noted a disparity between the energy of the ballads to different songs. "<a href="Drowned%20in%20Sound">Drowned in Sound</a>" commented that, "ballads remain a strong suit, particularly the easy grace of the title track, but more often than not sit awkwardly next to the more toothsome numbers and feel under-produced by comparison" with similar comments from <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> who said, ""Made in the Dark"'s main weakness might be its ballads, but that may just be in comparison to its many energetic moments, which are so addictive that it feels like a forced come-down whenever the band slows things down." However, "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" gave a positive evaluation of the ballads; "Hot Chip have had a happy way with a subliminal power ballad. And "Made in the Dark" can boast four of the best." "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" described it as a "patchy, turbulent record" due to the use of many different individual components and also said that it was a "good record but not a great one". Martin responded to the criticism made by "Pitchfork":
"Pitchfork", despite their initial rating, went on to list the album number 23 on their list of the fifty best albums of 2008, and would later state that "its bold charms have lent it a fond longevity." Another element that caused mixed reception was the use of a Todd Rundgren sample in "Shake a Fist", which musicOMH.com called "delightful" but "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" described it as grating. musicOMH.com, whose description of the album was positive, said that tracks "Ready for the Floor" and "Bendable Poseable" had elements reminiscent of previous album "The Warning". "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" said that although the execution was "novel" and the song "Made in the Dark" was "exquisite", that much of "Made in the Dark" "seems to spring from sticky relationship issues". Comparisons were also made to <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>'s "<a href="McCartney%20II">McCartney II</a>" album with songs like "Wrestlers", "Bendable Poseable", "Whistle for Will" and "We're Looking for a Lot of Love", which were described as having the "airless proto-electronica" of "<a href="McCartney%20II">McCartney II</a>".

In regards to lyrics, <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> said the album "boasts some of Hot Chip's most <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic</a> music, with rhythms and melodies that are just as hyper-articulate as the <a href="word%20play">word play</a>." "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" summarised the album as having "catchy tunes, monster grooves, and lyrics resolving the heartfelt and the smartass".

All songs written by Hot Chip, except "Shake a Fist", co-written by <a href="Todd%20Rundgren">Todd Rundgren</a>.

Hellingly Hospital Railway

The Hellingly Hospital Railway was a <a href="light%20railway">light railway</a> owned and operated by <a href="East%20Sussex%20County%20Council">East Sussex County Council</a>, used for transporting coal and passengers to <a href="Hellingly%20Hospital">Hellingly Hospital</a>, a <a href="psychiatric%20hospital">psychiatric hospital</a> near <a href="Hailsham">Hailsham</a>, from the <a href="London%2C%20Brighton%20and%20South%20Coast%20Railway">London, Brighton and South Coast Railway</a>'s <a href="Cuckoo%20Line">Cuckoo Line</a> at <a href="Hellingly%20railway%20station">Hellingly railway station</a>.

The railway was constructed in 1899 and opened to passengers on 20 July 1903, following its electrification in 1902. After the <a href="List%20of%20railway%20companies%20involved%20in%20the%201923%20grouping">railway grouping of 1923</a>, passenger numbers declined so significantly that the hospital authorities no longer considered passenger usage of the line to be economical, and that service was withdrawn. The railway closed to freight in 1959, following the hospital's decision to convert its coal boilers to oil, which rendered the railway unnecessary.

The route took a mostly direct path from a junction immediately south of Hellingly Station, past Farm and Park House <a href="Rail%20siding">Sidings</a>, stopping places to load and unload produce and supplies from outbuildings of the hospital. Much of the railway has been converted to <a href="Footpath%20%28right%20of%20way%29">footpath</a>, and many of the buildings formerly served by the line are now abandoned.

In 1897, East Sussex County Council purchased of land at Park Farm, about three miles (5 km) north of <a href="Hailsham">Hailsham</a>, from <a href="Walter%20Pelham%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Chichester">the Earl of Chichester</a>, to be the site of a new county <a href="Psychiatric%20hospital">lunatic asylum</a> that became <a href="Hellingly%20Hospital">Hellingly Hospital</a>. Construction work on the hospital began in 1900, to the design of <a href="George%20Thomas%20Hine">George Thomas Hine</a>, who had designed the nearby <a href="Haywards%20Heath%20Asylum">Haywards Heath Asylum</a>. Building materials were transported to the site by a  mile (2 km) <a href="standard%20gauge">standard gauge</a> <a href="Rail%20siding">private siding</a> from the <a href="goods%20yard">goods yard</a> at <a href="Hellingly%20railway%20station">Hellingly railway station</a> on the <a href="Cuckoo%20Line">Cuckoo Line</a>. The connection was built by the asylum's builders, Joseph Howe & Company, and was authorised by the <a href="London%2C%20Brighton%20and%20South%20Coast%20Railway">London, Brighton and South Coast Railway</a> (LBSCR) on condition that East Sussex Council paid the cost, estimated at £1,700.

A small wooden <a href="Railway%20platform">platform</a> was built at Hellingly railway station, opposite the main line platform. This had no connection to the station buildings and was used only for the transfer of passengers between main-line and hospital trains, and kept chained off when not in use. Coal yards and sidings were also built at Hellingly station. The hospital opened to patients, and the railway to passengers, on 20 July 1903.

The railway left the Cuckoo Line at Hellingly Station. Although the railway joined the Cuckoo Line at both the northern and southern ends of the platform, virtually no through trains ran. Due to the arrangement of the lines at the junction with the Cuckoo Line, passenger trains to and from the hospital reversed south of Hellingly station.

After leaving the main line immediately south of Hellingly, the railway passed over gated <a href="level%20crossing">level crossing</a>s at Park Road and New Road. Farm Siding, a single siding on the west of the line beyond the crossings, was a collection point for the farm's agricultural produce in the early years of the railway, but later fell out of use. The line climbed most of the way from here to the hospital at 1 in 50. About halfway between Hellingly and the hospital the line entered the hospital grounds, passing to the west of Park House Siding, which served the hospital's Park House annexe.

As it approached the hospital, the line split; the southern fork led to a siding to the north-west of the hospital, while the other turned sharply east and south through almost 180° before splitting again. One fork ran into a large workshop and the other led to a short platform, which was initially used for passengers. Following the suspension of passenger services it was converted into a <a href="Loading%20dock">coal dock</a>.

The line had no signals or automatic <a href="Railroad%20switch">points</a> to control the switching between lines at junctions with the main line and with the sidings. On the approach to a level crossing the fireman ran ahead with a red flag, to stop the traffic; he also manually operated the points.

Joseph Howe & Company used an <a href="0-4-0">0-4-0</a> <a href="Saddle%20tank%20%28locomotive%29">saddle tank</a> <a href="Steam%20locomotive">locomotive</a> to transport building materials during the hospital's construction. The locomotive was purchased new in 1900, and sold in 1903 following the completion of the hospital and electrification of the line.

In 1902, the decision was taken to <a href="Railway%20electrification%20system">electrify</a> the railway using power generated from the hospital's own power plant, the line was electrified at 500 <a href="Volt">V</a> <a href="Direct%20Current">DC</a> using a single <a href="overhead%20lines">overhead line</a>. The hospital was also connected to the local 11 kV electricity distribution system.

Engineers Robert W. Blackwell & Co provided a small <a href="0-4-0">0-4-0</a> <a href="electric%20locomotive">electric locomotive</a> capable of pulling two loaded coal wagons. It is not known where the locomotive was manufactured, as the company has no record, but the design of the controls suggests that it may have been imported from Germany. A small <a href="railcar">railcar</a> with space for 12 passengers was also provided. The locomotive and the railcar were each fitted with a single <a href="trolley%20pole">trolley pole</a> to collect electricity from the overhead wire. The passenger car was used for the duration of passenger services on the line, and the locomotive from the electrification of the line until closure in 1959. At that time, it was the oldest operational electric locomotive in the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>.

At the <a href="List%20of%20railway%20companies%20involved%20in%20the%201923%20grouping">railway grouping of 1923</a>, the <a href="London%2C%20Brighton%20and%20South%20Coast%20Railway">LBSCR</a> became part of the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29">Southern Railway</a> and the agreements between the hospital (renamed the East Sussex Mental Hospital in 1919) and the LBSCR were updated. The wooden platform at Hellingly station was drastically shortened in 1922. Because service levels depended on patient numbers and the hospital's coal and food requirements, the line never operated to a timetable. By 1931, passenger numbers had fallen to such an extent that the hospital authorities no longer considered passenger usage of the line to be economical, and the passenger service was withdrawn. The passenger car was moved to the hospital grounds, fitted with an awning, and became the hospital's sports pavilion. surviving into the mid-1990s before being destroyed in a fire started by vandals. The wooden platform at Hellingly station was removed in 1932, and the platform at the hospital was converted into a coal bay.

There were only two minor accidents: a car that collided with the locomotive whilst driving through the hospital grounds, and a wagon whose brakes failed whilst stabled at Farm Siding, which rolled down the line to Hellingly station.

On 22 November 1939, plans were put in place for the restoration of passenger services to allow ambulance trains to reach the hospital, and authorisation was given for their operation. However, the line was never used to transport patients, as although Park House was used as a hospital by the <a href="Canadian%20Army">Canadian Army</a> during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, patients left ambulance trains at Hellingly station and were transferred to Park House by road.

In the late 1950s, the hospital, under the control of the Hailsham Hospitals Management Committee since the 1948 establishment of the <a href="National%20Health%20Service%20%28England%29">National Health Service</a>, decided to convert its boilers from coal to oil. The railway was therefore no longer needed to transport coal; the last load was delivered on 10 March 1959, and the empty coal wagon returned to Hellingly on 25 March 1959.

Under the terms of the agreement between the hospital authorities, the LBSCR, and its successors, the hospital authorities were obliged to keep the railway in good repair to allow its use by main-line wagons. With a greatly reduced need for goods traffic to the hospital following the conversion of the boilers, it was decided that the railway was not worth the expense of continued maintenance and necessary upgrading, and the line was officially closed on 25 March 1959 following the departure of the last coal wagon.

The line was used for occasional excursions by <a href="railway%20enthusiasts">railway enthusiasts</a> for a short period after official closure, using the electric locomotive and a <a href="brake%20van">brake van</a> borrowed from <a href="British%20Railways">British Railways</a>. The exact date of the last run is not recorded; the last recorded use of the line was an excursion organised by the Norbury Transport and Model Railway Club on 4 April 1959, but it is known that later excursions ran. In the early 1960s a railway society in Yorkshire proposed to buy the track as a <a href="preserved%20railway">preserved railway</a>. However, as the psychiatric hospital was still open the request was not considered practical, and the track was lifted in the early 1960s. The fittings and locomotive were disposed of by H.Ripley and Sons of Hailsham.

The Cuckoo Line closed shortly after the Hospital Railway. Hellingly station closed to passengers on 14 June 1965, and the line closed for goods traffic on 26 April 1968. The station building complete with platform is now a private residence, and the Cuckoo Line trackbed was converted to the <a href="Cuckoo%20Trail">Cuckoo Trail</a> long-distance footpath in 1990. Much of the route of the Hospital Railway is also now a footpath.

Traces of the railway can still be seen, including a <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a> pole that supported the overhead wire, the remains of the engine shed (burnt down in 2004), and a short section of track. Hellingly Hospital is now closed Approval for redevelopment as a housing complex was obtained in 2009.

The Green (Dartmouth College)

The Green (formally the College Green) is a grass-covered field and common space at the center of <a href="Dartmouth%20College">Dartmouth College</a>, an <a href="Ivy%20League">Ivy League</a> university located in <a href="Hanover%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Hanover, New Hampshire</a>, United States. It was among the first parcels of land obtained by the College upon its founding in 1769, and is the only creation of the 18th century remaining at the center of the campus. After being cleared of pine trees, it initially served as a pasture and later as an athletic field for College sporting events. Today, it is a central location for rallies, celebrations, and demonstrations, and serves as a general, all-purpose recreation area. The College describes the Green as "historic" and as the "emotional center" of the institution.

The Green is a five-<a href="acre">acre</a> (two-<a href="hectare">hectare</a>) plot located in the center of downtown <a href="Hanover%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Hanover, New Hampshire</a>. It is crossed by seven gravel walking paths, the locations of which varied until about 1931, when the configuration was last altered. Three of them bisect the Green, running southwest to northeast, northwest to southeast, and east to west. The northernmost of its two east-west paths was added after Massachusetts Hall was constructed in 1907, and links the central entrance to that dormitory west of the Green to the northern entrance to Dartmouth Hall, east of it. Two paths run from the northwest and southwest corners respectively to the middle of the Green's eastern edge. A final path runs north-south along the eastern side. The Green also has paved sidewalks along its southern and western edges.

The Green is not perfectly rectangular, as its southern border along Wheelock Street runs slightly to the northeast rather than due east-west. This irregularity is due to the Town of Hanover's 1873 seizure of part of the southeast corner of the Green, which it used to straighten Wheelock Street. The Green had previously extended 30 feet (nine meters) farther south on that corner.

The outside edges of the Green are bordered by benches and trees; two flagpoles stand at the center of the western side. The plot is bounded by four streets: Wheelock Street to the south, College Street to the east, Wentworth Street to the north, and Main Street to the west. All but Wheelock Street are one-way roads, with traffic circulating counter-clockwise around the Green.

Many of Dartmouth's important <a href="List%20of%20Dartmouth%20College%20buildings">campus buildings</a> are located around the Green. To the north lies <a href="Baker%20Memorial%20Library">Baker Memorial Library</a>, Dartmouth's principal library, Webster Hall, containing Rauner Special Collections Library, and Sanborn Hall, home to the English department. On the west side sits the administration building, Parkhurst Hall, the admissions building, McNutt Hall, and two student buildings, Robinson Hall and the Collis Center. To the south sits the Hanover Inn, a College-owned hotel, and the <a href="Hopkins%20Center%20for%20the%20Arts">Hopkins Center for the Arts</a>. To the east lies the historic Dartmouth Row buildings, composed Wentworth Hall, Dartmouth Hall, Thornton Hall, and Reed Hall, as well as Rollins Chapel.

The land on which the Green sits was originally a <a href="pine">pine</a> forest, with some trees reaching the height of 270 feet (82 m), high enough to block out the sun. The process of clearing the pines was begun in 1770 by the newly founded Dartmouth College. The village plan of Hanover was laid out the following year and included as its central feature an open square of (three hectares). Even though the land had been cleared, many tree stumps remained until 1831; for a long period, it was a Dartmouth tradition for the graduating class to remove one stump.

The Green was not maintained at first; after being cleared, it was unkempt and ragged, sloping sharply towards a <a href="swamp">swamp</a> in the southwest corner. As early as 1807, the College was debating as to the future of the plot, considering using it for a variety of purposes. In 1828, the <a href="Board%20of%20Trustees%20of%20Dartmouth%20College">Board of Trustees</a> finally voted to plow, seed, level, and fence the area. Lack of funding would delay this plan from being carried out immediately; the Green was leveled in 1831 and finally fenced in 1836. The main road from Hanover to the northward <a href="Lyme%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Lyme, New Hampshire</a> had previously led diagonally across the Green, and due to the new fences, had to be diverted around it.
One of the Green's earliest uses was as a <a href="pasture">pasture</a> for cattle belonging to the residents of the town. Dartmouth students resented this use, and in the early 19th century herded all the cattle into the basement of Dartmouth Hall as a protest. The fence constructed during the 1836 renovations was in part a response to this action, and was meant to keep animals out.

In 1824, a Hanover ordinance permitted "the playing at ball or any game in which ball is used on the public common in front of Dartmouth College," confirming the Green's ongoing use as an athletic field. <a href="Cricket">Cricket</a> was among the games regularly played on the Green in the 18th century, and <a href="old%20division%20football">old division football</a> was played by the 1820s. Dartmouth's first intercollegiate matches in <a href="baseball">baseball</a> (1866), <a href="track%20and%20field">track and field</a> (1875), <a href="American%20football">football</a> (1881), and <a href="tennis">tennis</a> (1884) took place there. The College built its first gymnasium (Bissell Gymnasium) on the southeast corner of the Green in 1866-67.

In April 1873, the Town of Hanover seized part of the southeast corner of the green to align East and West Wheelock Streets; the town moved the fence thirty feet to the north of its original position. Dartmouth students protested by tearing down and burning the rebuilt fence; the town responded by threatening to reopen Main Street on its previous route from the Green's southwest corner across to the northeast. In an effort to quickly replace the fence and prevent the road from being reopened, College President <a href="Asa%20Dodge%20Smith">Asa Dodge Smith</a> convinced students to pay for the new fence. In 1893, when the fence's original purpose of keeping out livestock was no longer needed, the College decided to tear it down, to much student and alumni outcry. The class of 1893 restored and sponsored part of the fence as a "senior fence," and today the Senior Fence runs along the parts of the southern and western borders closest to the southwest corner. Only senior students were allowed to sit on it, and underclassmen in violation of this policy were soaked in a nearby watering trough.

In 1906, the Board of Trustees voted to officially name the space "the College Green", although at the time the space also went by names such as "the College Square", "the Common", and "the Campus". Aside from minor changes in furnishing, vegetation, and crosspaths, the Green has remained largely unchanged since being cleared.

The 2007–2008 edition of Dartmouth's Student Handbook states that the Green is reserved "for informal use, including rallies and other assemblies, by students, faculty, staff, and guests of the College... and for a limited number of traditional events". Since other facilities have superseded its use as such, the Green is no longer used for official athletic competitions. Nevertheless, informal sports and games frequently occur on the Green. Like all of the Dartmouth campus, the entirety of the Green is <a href="Wi-Fi">Wi-Fi</a>-enabled.

Given the Green's role as "the physical and emotional center of campus life," it is often the setting for protests, rallies, and demonstrations. "Dartmo", an online directory of Dartmouth College's buildings, describes the Green as being "used any time when collective joy or frustration is to be expressed". Dartmouth's Student Handbook explicitly permits the Green to be used for demonstrations and rallies.

One of the earliest student demonstrations took place in 1814, when students gathered on the Green to celebrate <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon</a>'s defeat in Europe. At the height of the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> in the late 1960s, the Green regularly saw <a href="Opposition%20to%20the%20Vietnam%20War">antiwar demonstrations</a>, some attracting up to a thousand protesters. A 1969 protest over the presence of the campus <a href="Reserve%20Officer%20Training%20Corps">Reserve Officer Training Corps</a> (ROTC) program culminated in the occupation of Parkhurst Hall, the College's administration building. In 1986, students constructed <a href="Shanty%20town">shanties</a> on the Green to encourage the College to <a href="divest">divest</a> from South African companies supporting <a href="Apartheid">Apartheid</a>; staffers of the conservative newspaper "<a href="The%20Dartmouth%20Review">The Dartmouth Review</a>" took sledgehammers to the structures. More recently, the Green was the location of a controversial 2006 <a href="May%20Day">May Day</a> rally in favor of immigrant rights.

On September 26, 2007, Dartmouth hosted a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29%20presidential%20debates%2C%202008%23September%2026%2C%202007%20%E2%80%93%20Hanover%2C%20New%20Hampshire%2C%20Dartmouth%20College">Democratic Presidential Candidates Debate</a>. The Green was the site of student rallies in favor of various candidates, and also saw the live broadcast of "<a href="Hardball%20with%20Chris%20Matthews">Hardball with Chris Matthews</a>". On April 30, 2016, Divest Dartmouth - a student group trying to divest from a list of 200 fossil fuel companies - led a climate change rally on the Green, the largest in New Hampshire's history. 

Dartmouth is well known for its variety of long-standing student traditions, many of which are centered on the Green. At Homecoming each fall, a <a href="bonfire">bonfire</a> is constructed on the Green by the freshman class; students and community members gather to watch the freshmen run around it as it burns. The wintertime celebration of Winter Carnival sees the construction of a <a href="snow%20sculpture">snow sculpture</a> on the Green. In the springtime, Green Key Weekend is marked by concerts and performances on the Green, which until 1984 was also the site of fiercely competitive Green Key <a href="Chariot%20racing">chariot races</a>.

Other traditions involving the Green include the placement of a <a href="Christmas%20tree">Christmas tree</a> at the center each December and an annual Native American <a href="Pow-wow">Pow-Wow</a>. Students gather on the Green on the night of the winter's first snowfall for a school-wide <a href="snowball%20fight">snowball fight</a>. The College's <a href="Graduation">commencement</a> ceremonies are traditionally held on the Green, regardless of weather conditions.

<doc id="13740467" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13740467" title="Cogan House Covered Bridge">
Cogan House Covered Bridge

The Cogan House Covered Bridge is a <a href="Burr%20Truss">Burr arch truss</a> <a href="covered%20bridge">covered bridge</a> over <a href="Larrys%20Creek">Larrys Creek</a> in <a href="Cogan%20House%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Cogan House Township</a>, <a href="Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lycoming County</a>, in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. It was built in 1877 and is long. The bridge was placed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1980, and had a major restoration in 1998. The Cogan House bridge is named for the <a href="Township%20%28Pennsylvania%29">township</a> and village of Cogan House, and is also known by at least four other names: Buckhorn, Larrys Creek, Day's, and Plankenhorn.

The Cogan House Covered Bridge was constructed by a <a href="millwright">millwright</a> who assembled the timber framework in a field next to the <a href="sawmill">sawmill</a>, before it was reassembled at the bridge site. It was the only bridge on Larrys Creek that survived the flood of June 1889, and one of only a handful that were left intact in the county. Although the bridge used to carry a steady flow of <a href="Tanning%20%28leather%29">tannery</a> and sawmill traffic, the <a href="clearcutting">clearcutting</a> of the surrounding forests meant the end of those industries by the early 20th century.

Since then much of the surrounding area has reverted to <a href="Secondary%20forest">second growth forest</a>, and the one-lane bridge is now on a dead end road in a remote valley with little traffic. It is the oldest and longest of the three covered bridges remaining in the county. Despite the 1998 restoration and other repairs, as of 2009 the bridge structure's sufficiency rating on the <a href="National%20Bridge%20Inventory">National Bridge Inventory</a> was 17.2 percent and its condition was deemed "basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action".

The covered bridge is south of <a href="Pennsylvania%20Route%20184">Pennsylvania Route 184</a> on Campbell Road (Township Road 784), past the intersection with Covered Bridge Road. Its official name on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is "Cogan House Covered Bridge". It is the only covered bridge ever built in Cogan House Township and the name comes from the township, as well as the village of Cogan House, which is northeast of the bridge. Cogan House Township and the village are named for David Cogan, who settled on Larrys Creek in 1825. Cogan was one of the few settlers in the area for many years and grew tired of living nearly alone in the wilderness. In 1842 he abandoned his homestead, as did a neighbor named Carter. Their houses were used by hunters and travelers and the name Cogan's House was given to the area. Cogan House Township was formed from parts of <a href="Jackson%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Jackson</a> and <a href="Mifflin%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Mifflin Townships</a> on December 6, 1843.

Since the bridge's 1998 restoration, the Lycoming <a href="County%20commission">County Commissioners</a> have officially called it the "Buckhorn Covered Bridge". The name comes from the bridge's location at the base of Buckhorn Mountain, and from the road to the former village of Buckhorn, which crossed the creek on it. This is the name used on the erected by the commissioners to mark its restoration and placement on the NRHP, despite the different name used on the Register itself. The commissioners chose "Buckhorn Covered Bridge" based on one of the names used in Benjamin and June Evans' 1993 book "Pennsylvania's Covered Bridges: A Complete Guide". Historically, the commissioners used "Cogan House Covered Bridge" as the official name.

Historian Milton W. Landis uses "Larrys Creek Covered Bridge" since it crosses Larrys Creek, and notes this was the name used by other local historians. Larrys Creek is named for Larry Burt, who was the first settler at the mouth of the creek when the surveyors came through in 1769. Landis acknowledges the "Cogan House" name, and says the bridge has also been known by the names of "several tenants who lived in the little farm adjacent" to it.

While Landis does not give these different names, two other names for the bridge are known and may come from some of these tenants. The first of these is "Day's Bridge" and it is clear that this is another name for the Cogan House Covered Bridge. The second of these, "Plankenhorn Bridge", is a name in a list of existing and vanished covered bridges in Lycoming County. Although the association of this name with the Cogan House Covered Bridge is not made explicitly, it is described as still standing on Larrys Creek and being north of a bridge in Mifflin Township. This is the only known covered bridge that meets those criteria.

The first covered bridge in the United States was built over the <a href="Schuylkill%20River">Schuylkill River</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, Pennsylvania in 1800. Some of the first Burr arch truss covered bridges were also built in the state. Pennsylvania is estimated to have once had at least 1,500 covered bridges, and is believed to have had the most in the country between 1830 and 1875. In 2001 Pennsylvania had more surviving historic covered bridges than any other state, with 221 remaining in 40 of the commonwealth's 67 counties.

Covered bridges were a transition between stone and cast-iron and steel bridges. In 19th-century Pennsylvania, lumber was an abundant resource for bridge construction, but did not last long when exposed to weather and the elements. The roof and enclosed sides of covered bridges protected the structural elements, allowing some of these bridges to survive well over a century. A Burr arch truss consists of a <a href="Structural%20engineering">load-bearing</a> <a href="arch">arch</a> sandwiching multiple <a href="Truss%23King%20post%20truss">King posts</a>, resulting in a bridge which is both stronger and more rigid than one built using either element alone.

In 1850 a <a href="plank%20road">plank road</a> was built in Lycoming County, from the <a href="mouth%20%28river%29">mouth</a> of Larrys Creek to the borough of <a href="Salladasburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Salladasburg, Pennsylvania</a>. It was later extended north along the Second Fork of Larrys Creek as far as the unincorporated villages of Brookside and White Pine in Cogan House Township, and eventually went as far as the large <a href="Tanning%20%28leather%29">tannery</a> in the village of English Center in <a href="Pine%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pine Township</a> on <a href="Little%20Pine%20Creek">Little Pine Creek</a>. Another branch of the plank road followed Larrys Creek itself north from Salladasburg. While its exact length is unknown, Landis reports it may have reached nearly to the site of the covered bridge.

Before there was a bridge, there was a <a href="ford%20%28crossing%29">ford</a> at the site where the bridge was later built. Wagons of finished leather and raw hides came from and went to the English Center tannery via White Pine, seeking to avoid traffic on the plank road along the Second Fork. Other traffic went to and from a large sawmill at White Pine and other mills to the west and north. Traffic from the north crossed Larrys Creek, and continued either east over Buckhorn Mountain to the <a href="Williamsport%20and%20Elmira%20Railroad">Williamsport and Elmira Railroad</a> at the village of Cogan Station on <a href="Lycoming%20Creek">Lycoming Creek</a>, or south down the road along Larrys Creek. This road led to a tannery on Larrys Creek about south of the ford, and to the plank road along the main branch of the creek. The plank road was a <a href="toll%20road">toll road</a> and connected with another railroad, the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Canal%20%28West%20Branch%20Division%29">West Branch Division of the Pennsylvania Canal</a>, and the <a href="West%20Branch%20Susquehanna%20River">West Branch Susquehanna River</a> at the creek's mouth.

Because the ford was often impassable in winter or bad weather, or during high water, a petition from the citizens of Cogan House Township for a bridge to be built was filed in September 1876. They asked the county to build the bridge as it was beyond the resources of the township to do so. The petition was read on September 30, 1876, and three viewers were appointed on November 3 to examine the site and report back. The viewers reported back in favor of building the bridge on November 25. On January 23, 1877, the county <a href="Grand%20jury%23History">grand jury</a> approved the report and the construction of the bridge.

Landis is not certain if the bridge was built in 1877 or 1878, but every other source that mentions the date agrees it was 1877. Valentine ("Tine") Meyers (or Meyer), a <a href="millwright">millwright</a> and resident of the hamlet of Quiggleville in <a href="Lycoming%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lycoming Township</a>, built the bridge. The timbers for the bridge were cut at an "up and down", <a href="steam%20power">steam power</a>ed <a href="sawmill">sawmill</a> owned by Robert Wood, a short distance north of the bridge site. The head <a href="wikt%3Asawyer">sawyer</a> at the mill was John Mecum. The wood used was pine, cut in nearby forests and hauled in ox carts to the mill. The largest timbers used in the bridge are up to long.

Meyers is not believed to have had much experience building bridges and set about construction in a unique manner. The timber framework was first assembled in a field next to the sawmill, with each new piece bolted into place after being cut. If a piece did not fit, more careful measurements were made and a new piece was cut and tested. The outlines of the sections for curved beams for the <a href="Burr%20arch">Burr arch</a> were first marked with chalk on the wood, then the saw crew lifted and guided it by hand against the sawblade to cut the curve. After the framework was completed in the field, it was taken apart, loaded onto the same ox carts used to bring the logs to the mill, and taken to the bridge site. There the framework was reassembled on the bridge <a href="abutment">abutment</a>s. Bolts were used to hold all of the large pieces together, while cross-pieces and small braces were nailed in place.
The Cogan House Covered Bridge was added to the NRHP in 1980 and was listed on the 2009 National Bridge Inventory (NBI). According to the NBI, the covered bridge is long, with a roadway wide, and a maximum load of . According to the NRHP, the bridge's "road surface width" is , the load is , and the clearance height is . The width is only sufficient for a single lane of traffic. As of 2011, the clearance height posted on the bridge itself has been reduced to , and the posted maximum load has been reduced to . According to Landis, the top of the Burr arch is nearly above the floor of the bridge.

The covered bridge rests on the original stone abutments, which have since been reinforced with concrete made of cement. The bridge deck is made of crosswise planking, overlaid with runners in the western half and lengthwise planking in the eastern half. The upper part of the portals and the <a href="Clapboard%20%28architecture%29">clapboard</a> siding is made of pine boards, and stops below the roof line. Although the bridge was painted red as part of its 1998 restoration, in 1964 it was described as unpainted, and it does not seem to have been painted in 1980, as the NRHP nomination form describes how "its rough horizontal siding ... help[s] this small bridge blend into the surrounding forest". The roof was originally covered with wooden shingles. The bridge does not have <a href="parapet">parapet</a>s and has "no steel reinforcements".

The Cogan House Covered Bridge was the only one on Larrys Creek to survive a major flood on June 1, 1889, which washed out most other bridges throughout Lycoming County. A large fallen maple tree formed a dam across Larrys Creek, just upstream of the bridge; this dam blocked debris and diverted the brunt of the floodwaters. The same flood destroyed the Larrys Creek plank road and the canal at the creek's mouth. The same storm system also caused the <a href="Johnstown%20Flood">Johnstown Flood</a>, which killed over 2,200 people.

After the flood the plank road was only reconstructed as far north as Salladasburg, so for a time all the traffic from the English Center tannery went over the bridge on the way to the railroad at Cogan Station. However, the virgin timber which supplied the local tanneries and sawmills was all <a href="clearfelling">clear-cut</a> within several years of the flood. Without timber, the industries that used the roads leading to the bridge closed and the local villages declined, or, in the case of Buckhorn, disappeared.

By 1900, there were four remaining covered bridges on Larrys Creek: going upstream they were at the hamlet of Larryville in <a href="Piatt%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Piatt Township</a>, at or near Mud Run in Mifflin Township, in Salladasburg, and in Cogan House Township. As of 2011, the Cogan House Covered Bridge is the oldest and longest of three 19th-century covered bridges remaining in Lycoming County (the others are the <a href="Buttonwood%20Covered%20Bridge">Buttonwood Covered Bridge</a> in <a href="Jackson%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Jackson Township</a> over <a href="Little%20Pine%20Creek">Blockhouse Creek</a>, and the <a href="Lairdsville%20Covered%20Bridge">Lairdsville Covered Bridge</a> in <a href="Moreland%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Moreland Township</a> over <a href="Little%20Muncy%20Creek">Little Muncy Creek</a>).

The bridge had "needed repairs" made in 1964, and the original stone abutments were reinforced with concrete prior to 1966. It was added to the NRHP on July 24, 1980 in a <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%23Multiple%20Property%20Submission">Multiple Property Submission</a> of seven <a href="Covered%20Bridges%20of%20Bradford%2C%20Sullivan%20and%20Lycoming%20Counties">Covered Bridges of Bradford, Sullivan and Lycoming Counties</a>, and was "painted and <a href="creosote">creosote</a>d" in 1981. The 1980 NRHP form and Zacher's 1994 book both list the bridge's condition as good. The Lycoming County Commissioners had the bridge "rehabilitated" in 1998, at a cost of $105,493. The general contractor for the restoration was Lycoming Supply Inc., which replaced some structural beams with treated southern pine and the "Dutch lap" or clapboard siding with white pine. The <a href="purlin">purlin</a>s and <a href="rafter">rafter</a>s were reconstructed using treated yellow pine, and support a new roof of <a href="Cedar%20wood">cedar</a> <a href="shake%20%28shingle%29">shake shingles</a>. The deck and floor of the bridge were solid and required few repairs. The bridge was painted red, and a stone pillar was built with plaques marking the restoration and the bridge's inclusion on the NRHP.
Because the bridge is listed on the NRHP, the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Historical%20and%20Museum%20Commission">Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission</a> had to approve the renovation. <a href="Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Pennsylvania Department of Transportation</a> (PennDOT) and <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> (FHWA) funds helped pay for the work done. The dedication ceremony was held on October 30, 1998, with Lycoming County Commissioner Russell Reitz and PennDOT Director of Municipal Services Thomas Lyons cutting a plank on wooden sawhorses with an old <a href="crosscut%20saw">crosscut saw</a> as the <a href="ribbon%20cutting%20ceremony">ribbon cutting ceremony</a>. The other county commissioners and the local state representative and state senator were also present and spoke, as did a representative of the "<a href="Theodore%20Burr">Theodore Burr</a> Covered Bridge Society of Pennsylvania".

In August 2000 an inspection revealed that one of the timber arches of the Cogan House Covered Bridge was damaged by a vehicle which was over the weight limit crossing the bridge. A <a href="propane">propane</a> delivery truck making a delivery to the private hunting cabin served by the bridge is thought to have caused the damage. Lycoming Supply Inc. won the bid to do the repair work in December, at a cost of $6,300. Before the repair the bridge remained open and was safe to use. The Evans' 2001 book describes the condition of the bridge as excellent.

Despite the restoration and repairs, the 2009 FHWA <a href="National%20Bridge%20Inventory">National Bridge Inventory</a> found the sufficiency rating of the bridge structure to be 17.2 percent. The inventory found the condition of the bridge deck and the substructure was satisfactory, while the superstructure was poor. It further found that the bridge's foundations were "determined to be stable for assessed or calculated <a href="Bridge%20scour">scour</a> conditions", however the railings "do not meet currently acceptable standards". Its overall condition was deemed "basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action"; the 2006 NBI estimated the cost to improve the bridge at $143,000.

The bridge is still used, although the public dirt road to it ends in a <a href="cul%20de%20sac">cul de sac</a> on the east side. A gated private road continues to the private hunting camp and provides access to <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20Game%20Lands">Pennsylvania State Game Lands</a> No. 114. The bridge has a posted speed limit of and its average daily traffic was ten vehicles in 2009. "Pennsylvania's Covered Bridges: A Complete Guide" notes that despite being "located in a rather remote area, it is worth the trip to see this beautifully restored historic treasure."

The following table is a comparison of published measurements of length, width and load recorded in five different sources using different methods, as well as the name or names cited. The NBI measures bridge length between the "backwalls of abutments" or pavement grooves and the roadway width as "the most restrictive minimum distance between curbs or rails". The NRHP form was prepared by the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Historical%20and%20Museum%20Commission">Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission</a> (PHMC), which surveyed county engineers, historical and covered bridge societies, and others for all the covered bridges in the commonwealth. The Evans visited every covered bridge in Pennsylvania in 2001 and measured each bridge's length (portal to portal) and width (at the portal) for their book. The data in Zacher's book was based on a 1991 survey of all covered bridges in Pennsylvania by the PHMC and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, aided by local government and private agencies. The article uses primarily the NBI and NRHP data, as they are national programs.

T206 Honus Wagner

The T206 Honus Wagner <a href="baseball%20card">baseball card</a> depicts the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>' <a href="Honus%20Wagner">Honus Wagner</a>, a <a href="dead-ball%20era">dead-ball era</a> <a href="baseball%20player">baseball player</a> who is widely considered to be one of the best players of all time. The card was designed and issued by the <a href="American%20Tobacco%20Company">American Tobacco Company</a> (ATC) from 1909 to 1911 as part of its <a href="T206">T206</a> series. Wagner refused to allow production of his baseball card to continue, either because he did not want children to buy cigarette packs to get his card, or because he wanted more compensation from the ATC. The ATC ended production of the Wagner card and a total of only 50 to 200 cards were ever distributed to the public (exact number unknown), as compared to the "tens or hundreds of thousands" of T206 cards, over three years in sixteen brands of cigarettes, for any other player. In 1933, the card was first listed at a price value of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>50 in <a href="Jefferson%20Burdick">Jefferson Burdick</a>'s "<a href="The%20American%20Card%20Catalog">The American Card Catalog</a>", making it the most expensive baseball card in the world at the time.

The most famous T206 Honus Wagner is the "Gretzky T206 Honus Wagner" card. The card's odd texture and shape led to speculation that it was altered. The Gretzky T206 Wagner was first sold by Alan Ray to a <a href="sports%20memorabilia">baseball memorabilia</a> collector named Bill Mastro, who sold the card two years later to Jim Copeland for nearly four times the price he had originally paid. Copeland's sizable transaction revitalized interest in the sports memorabilia collection market. In 1991, Copeland sold the card to <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> figures <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> and <a href="Bruce%20McNall">Bruce McNall</a> for $451,000. Gretzky resold the card four years later to <a href="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> and Treat Entertainment for $500,000 for use as the top prize in a promotional contest.

The next year, a Florida postal worker won the card and auctioned it at <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a> for $640,000 to collector Michael Gidwitz. In 2000, the card was sold via Robert Edward Auctions to card collector Brian Seigel for $1.27 million. In February 2007, Seigel sold the card privately to an anonymous collector for $2.35 million. Less than six months later, the card was sold to another anonymous collector for $2.8 million. In April 2011, that anonymous purchaser was revealed to be <a href="Ken%20Kendrick">Ken Kendrick</a>, owner of the <a href="Arizona%20Diamondbacks">Arizona Diamondbacks</a>. A different card, named the "Jumbo Wagner" was sold at auction again in 2016 for a record $3.12 million. These transactions have made the Wagner card the most valuable baseball card in history.

In October 2013, Bill Mastro, CEO of Mastro Auctions (the owner of Robert Edward Auctions) pleaded guilty to <a href="mail%20fraud">mail fraud</a> in U.S. District Court and later admitted to the court that he had trimmed the "Gretzky" Wagner card to sharply increase its value.

Other T206 Wagners, both legitimate and fake, have surfaced in recent years. Some of the real cards have fetched hundreds of thousands of dollars in auctions. One particular T206 Honus Wagner owned by John Cobb and Ray Edwards has attracted media controversy over its authenticity, with many leading hobby experts regarding it as a fake.

The American Tobacco Company was formed as a result of an 1889 merger of five major cigarette manufacturers: W. Duke & Sons & Company, <a href="Allen%20%26amp%3B%20Ginter">Allen & Ginter</a>, <a href="Goodwin%20%26amp%3B%20Company">Goodwin & Company</a>, F. S. Kinney Company and William S. Kimball & Company. Because the company came to monopolize the tobacco industry, ATC did not have to conduct advertising or promotions for its products. Since baseball cards were primarily used as a sales promotion, ATC removed them from its tobacco packs, almost driving the cards into obsolescence. During the presidency of "<a href="trust-busting">trust-buster</a>" <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, the ATC was subjected to legal action from the government, in hopes of shutting down the monopoly in the industry.

Thereafter, the ATC was back in competition with other tobacco companies, so it reinserted baseball cards into cigarette packs. In 1909, the company introduced the T206 series – also known as the "white border set" – of baseball cards of 524 players into its cigarette packs. The cards were printed at seven factories in New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. Two years later, the ATC was broken up into several major companies as part of the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">United States Supreme Court</a> ruling in "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20American%20Tobacco%20Company">United States v. American Tobacco Company</a>", <a href="Case%20citation">221 U.S. 106</a> (1911).

The typical card in the T206 series had a width of and a height of . Some cards were awkwardly shaped or irregularly sized, which prompted a belief that many of the cards in the series had been altered at one point or another. In his work "Inside T206: A Collector Guide to the Classic Baseball Card Set", Scot A. Reader wrote that "[i]t is not at all uncommon to find T206 examples that have been altered at some point during their near-century of existence." These discrepancies were taken advantage of by "card doctors" who trimmed corners and dirty edges to improve the appearance of the card. The front of all T206 series cards, including the Wagner card, displayed a <a href="lithography">lithograph</a> of the player created by a multi-stage printing process in which a number of colors were printed on top of each other to create a lithograph with the appropriate design. The backs of the cards featured the monochromatic colors of the 16 tobacco brands for which the cards were printed. The Wagner cards in particular advertised the Piedmont and Sweet Caporal brands of cigarettes and were produced at Factory 25 in <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, as indicated by the factory stamp imprinted on the back of the cards.

Starting from January 1909, the ATC sought authorization from baseball players for inclusion in the T206 series, which would feature 524 major league players, 76 of whom would later be inducted into the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Baseball Hall of Fame</a>. Wagner had been at the top of his game throughout the decade, and was even considered to be the game's greatest player at the time. He had appeared on advertisements for a number of other products such as chewing gum, gunpowder and soft drinks. Unsurprisingly, the ATC asked for Wagner's permission to have his picture on a baseball card. According to an October 12, 1912, issue of "<a href="The%20Sporting%20News">The Sporting News</a>", Wagner did not give his consent to appear on the baseball card. In response to the authorization request letter sent by John Gruber, a Pittsburgh sportswriter hired by the ATC to seek Wagner's permission, Wagner wrote that he "did not care to have his picture in a package of cigarettes." He threatened to seek legal action against ATC if they went ahead and created his baseball card.

The reasons for Wagner's strong negative reaction to the ATC's request have been the subject of much speculation. The most commonly told account is that Wagner rejected the deal because he did not want young baseball fans to purchase the tobacco packs for his baseball card. Wagner held his fans in high regard, particularly the younger ones. His granddaughter, Blair, remarked that "[h]e loved children. He wanted to teach kids good sportsmanship. When it came time for that card to come out, it wasn't that he wasn't paid. He didn't want kids to have to buy tobacco to get his card." However, Wagner <a href="chewing%20tobacco">chewed tobacco</a>, and he had previously appeared in advertisements for many tobacco products, including a cigar baseball trading card in 1899 and a newspaper ad for Murad cigarettes during the <a href="1909%20World%20Series">1909 World Series</a>.

Another explanation surmised is that Wagner did not consent because he felt he was not receiving just compensation from the ATC for his baseball card. Wagner had a history of being a tough negotiator; he had announced his retirement from baseball in December 1907, but returned shortly before the start of the 1908 baseball season after receiving a $10,000 contract, double his salary from the 1907 season. This theory has its flaws, however, since Wagner sent Gruber a check for $10 to compensate him for the fee ATC would have paid him if Wagner had given permission to create his baseball card. Michael O'Keeffe and Teri Thompson, authors of "The Card: Collectors, Con Men, and the True Story of History's Most Desired Baseball Card", asked why Wagner would compensate Gruber for $10, a substantial amount of money at the time (approximately equal to $275 in 2016), if he refused authorization for monetary reasons. The ATC had already produced a number of T206 Honus Wagner baseball cards; the exact number is unknown, but is speculated to be between 50 and 200. They stopped production of the card, however, after Wagner denied authorization.

In 1991, <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> player <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> purchased a mint condition 1909 T206 Honus Wager baseball card, with a Piedmont cigarette brand back, at a <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a> auction. The card became known as the "Gretzky T206 Wagner" to the public. The Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) company graded this card a PSA 8 Near Mint-Mint (NM-MT) on their 10-point scale, the highest grade given to a T206 Honus Wagner card. Bill Hughes was the official grader of the card, working for PSA at the time. Hughes admitted to knowing that the card had been altered when he graded it.

The Gretzky T206 Wagner first came to attention in 1985, when small-time <a href="Hicksville%2C%20New%20York">Hicksville, New York</a> card collector Alan Ray contacted Bob Sevchuk, the owner of a <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a> sports memorabilia store, to arrange a potential $25,000 deal for his T206 Honus Wagner card. Bill Mastro, a sports memorabilia dealer who later founded Mastro Auctions and became one of the most powerful figures in the industry, heard the news, and immediately jumped on the offer. Mastro, with the financial backing of friend Rob Lifson, sought to improve the offer and had Ray add 50 to 75 of his other T206 series cards, including the rare T206 <a href="Eddie%20Plank">Eddie Plank</a>, into the deal. Ray, who later stated he "had a money situation", agreed to Mastro's terms of the deal.

The circumstances regarding how Ray came into possession of the Gretzky T206 Wagner have been shrouded in mystery. He tried to avoid answering any questions regarding the matter but, in a 2001 interview, claimed to have received it from a relative, whose name he did not disclose. Inside the memorabilia community, there was speculation that the card had been cut from a printing sheet during the deal made with Mastro. Mastro has told colleagues in the memorabilia circuit that he purchased the card from a printer, which was not Ray's profession. Ray personally stated that Mastro might have been doing this to prevent others from trying to trace the card. Some also claim that Mastro bought the card from Sevchuk, not Ray.

After the transaction was completed, Mastro went back to his car and showed the Gretzky T206 Wagner to Lifson. Mastro offered one of the other T206 Wagner cards in his personal collection to Lifson as payment for the $25,000 that Lifson fronted him for the Gretzky T206 Wagner—claiming that Lifson could sell the lower quality one for $30,000 and make a quick $5,000 profit. Lifson was skeptical, but he took Mastro's word and accepted the deal, successfully selling this other Wagner card to New Jersey businessman <a href="Barry%20Halper">Barry Halper</a> for $30,000. (Halper sold that card and 200 other baseball memorabilia items in 1998 to <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> for over $5,000,000.)

In 1987, Mastro sold the Gretzky T206 Wagner to Jim Copeland, a <a href="San%20Luis%20Obispo%2C%20California">San Luis Obispo, California</a> sporting-goods chain owner, for $110,000. With that transaction, there was a sudden renewed interest in baseball card collecting. As Lifson commented, the Copeland deal revitalized the industry and "created an incentive to sell these great cards."

Within five years, Copeland decided it was time to sell his card collection; he chose to sell his entire 873-piece collection in a single sale, through Mastro. Mastro contacted <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a>, the renowned New York auction house, and asked them to accept the Copeland memorabilia collection on <a href="consignment">consignment</a>. Sotheby's advertised Copeland's items as the "Copeland Collection of Important Baseball Cards and Sports Memorabilia" to attract hobbyists and other potential clients. The March 1991 auction attracted nearly 800 collectors who were interested in purchasing some of Copeland's rare memorabilia. The bidding prices far exceeded the pre-auction estimates, as a 1952 <a href="Topps">Topps</a> <a href="Mickey%20Mantle">Mickey Mantle</a> card sold for $49,500, more than three times the initial pre-auction price estimate. Pre-auction estimates placed Copeland's T206 Honus Wagner at a price of $114,000. Within minutes of the opening bid for the T206 Wagner card, the highest bidder had put down $228,000, twice the pre-auction estimate. A bidding competition between Mike Gidwitz, Mark Friedland and an unknown phone bidder ensued. Gidwitz dropped out of the competition when the bidding reached the $300,000 mark. As Friedland made each bid, the phone bidder would counter with a bid $5,000 or $10,000 higher. Friedland dropped out of the competition after the phone bidder countered with a $410,000 bid for the card. With Sotheby's 10% buyer's premium, the final price of the card came out to $451,000, nearly four times the pre-auction estimate. The phone bidder was Wayne Gretzky, who purchased the card with advice and financial backing from his 'boss' <a href="Bruce%20McNall">Bruce McNall</a>, the owner of the NHL's <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a>. Copeland received around $5 million for the entire collection. The publicity coverage of the Sotheby's auction renewed interest in the hobby of sports memorabilia collecting. Mastro worked with Sotheby's for the next four years to facilitate sports memorabilia auctions and established himself as a leading card dealer in the industry. Illusionist <a href="David%20Copperfield%20%28illusionist%29">David Copperfield</a> used the popularity of the card as part of a magic trick on a TV Specials. In a 1993 special, Copperfield had Gretzky sign the card (using a reprint of course), then Copperfield proceeded to tear the card into four pieces, then restoring the card, and magically removing the signature.

Gretzky, who was not a big card collector, said he purchased the card because he thought "the market would remain strong", thus making for a valuable investment. McNall orchestrated the plan to buy the card. In a 2005 interview, McNall stated his "philosophy was, if you buy something that is absolutely the best in the world, you'd be okay because there is always another buyer for something at the top end."

In 1995, Gretzky sold the card to Wal-Mart and Treat Entertainment for $500,000. The two companies intended to use the card as the grand prize in a promotional contest. The card was sent all across the United States, as part of Wal-Mart's plan to rejuvenate the baseball card market. On February 24 of the following year, the 122nd anniversary of Wagner's birthday, the grand prize drawing for the card was held on <a href="CNN">CNN</a>'s "Larry King Weekend". At around 9:00 P.M., Hall of Fame third baseman <a href="Brooks%20Robinson">Brooks Robinson</a>, one of King's guests on the show, pulled out the name of one Patricia Gibbs, a <a href="postal%20worker">postal worker</a> living in <a href="Hollywood%2C%20Florida">Hollywood, Florida</a>. After spending hours unsuccessfully trying to contact Gibbs, King's staff finally got through to her phone, and informed Gibbs of her prize. Treat Entertainment and Wal-Mart gave the card to Gibbs a few weeks later at a Wal-Mart store in <a href="Miramar%2C%20Florida">Miramar, Florida</a>. Gibbs could not afford the taxes on the card, so she decided to consign the card to an auction later on. She consigned the card to Christie's, a New York-based auction house better known for selling famous artworks.

Michael Gidwitz, the same individual who battled with Gretzky and Mark Friedland for the card at the Copeland auction in 1991, won the Christie's auction with a bid of $641,500. Four years later, on July 5, 2000, Gidwitz partnered up with eBay and Robert Edwards Auctions to start a 10-day online auction for the card. Robert Edwards Auctions, a division of MastroNet, set up a registration system in which they approved prospective individuals before they actually made bids. These individuals had to wire a $100,000 deposit to iEscrow.com in order to be pre-approved to make bids for the card. On July 15, the card was sold to Brian Seigel, a collector from California, for $1.265 million. In February 2007, the Associated Press announced that Seigel had sold the card privately & directly to an anonymous collector from Southern California for $2.35 million. Less than six months later, on September 6, 2007, SCP Auctions announced that the card had been sold once again to another anonymous collector for $2.8 million. The anonymous collector was later revealed to be <a href="Arizona%20Diamondbacks">Arizona Diamondbacks</a> owner <a href="Ken%20Kendrick">Ken Kendrick</a>.

Shortly after Gretzky's 1991 purchase, previously ignored allegations that the card had once been subject to alteration flared up again. This is when Gretzky approached the Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) company to grade the card, resulting in the aforementioned PSA 8 NM-MT grading. Despite PSA company president David Hall's personal statement that the card was "superb" and a "fantastic card in every way," a number of people in the memorabilia industry were not convinced that the card had not been altered at some point.

Soon afterward, Alan Ray came back into the picture, claiming that he had proof the card had been doctored by Mastro at one point after the initial $25,000 trade in 1985. He had a photograph of the card taken before the transaction with Mastro and claimed that the card in the photo looked significantly different from the photo of Gretzky's card. He sent the comparison of the two photos to both McNall and Sotheby's, but never received a response back. Some memorabilia collectors have dismissed Ray's claims, saying that the photo hardly proves any doctoring was ever done on the card.

On December 4, 2012, Mastro was indicted on federal fraud charges, and entered a plea of not guilty. In 2013, Mastro pleded guilty, having entered into a plea agreement with federal prosecutors, and admitted to trimming the Honus Wagner card in the mid-1980s to increase its value. Mastro's plea agreement was rejected by a judge. In August 2015, Mastro was sentenced to 20 months in federal prison under a new plea agreement. Mastro was released in May 2017.

A similar but unaltered card, the <a href="T206%20Honus%20Wagner%23The%20%27Jumbo%20Wagner%27">'Jumbo Wagner'</a>, also has a NM-MT grade quality for the majority of the card, but the lower quality edges have not been trimmed, lowering it from NM-MT to an overall grade of PSA 5 – one of only three (along with Mastro's trimmed card) rated PSA 5 or better – sold at a 2013 auction for $2,105,770.50.

In 1976, three collectors discovered a T206 Wagner that featured Wagner in a different pose, never seen in any of the other cards. Although a <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> expert said the paper on the card dated back to 1910, the three men decided to submit the card for a <a href="water%20test">water test</a>, using chemicals to determine the card's authenticity. The card broke apart, and as a result, the card was dismissed as a fake.

Another T206 Wagner card owned by two <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati</a> men was dismissed as a fake by Bill Mastro and PSA president Joe Orlando. The two men, John Cobb and Ray Edwards, have tried to prove that their Piedmont-backed card is not a fake and, due to its excellent condition, should fetch over $1 million in an auction. Cobb and Edwards also have alleged that they have been dismissed because they are inner city black men in a hobby that has been dominated by successful white men. Cobb, like Mastro back in the late 1980s, does not divulge the exact details of how he came to own the card. He has stated he purchased the card at an estate sale for $1,800 in 1983 or 1984, a bargain for the card at that time. When Cobb and Edwards tried to sell the card on eBay in 2002, a <a href="Newport%2C%20Kentucky">Newport, Kentucky</a> attorney filed a police report against the two men because he believed the card was a reprint that was stolen from his office months earlier. The police launched an investigation, but found no evidence of wrongdoing. An outraged Edwards dismissed the accusations as "bullshit," adding that they would not have been made "if we were white."

Card Collector Services graded the card and officially ruled that it was indeed a <a href="reprint">reprint</a>. Cobb and Edwards dismissed the findings and went to Integrated Paper Services (IPS), an independent paper testing and analysis lab, in February 2003 to have their card's paper tested. An IPS expert determined that the card dated back to 1910, which would be consistent to the time period when the card was distributed. The expert ruled that the "paper stock was consistent with the time that card would have been made." Cobbs and Edwards later went to an Ohio <a href="pulp%20and%20paper%20industry">paper industry</a> consultant who confirmed that the card was from 1909. The consultant stated that a decent counterfeit of the card could only be produced from a "master pressman with 5–10 years experience, and would require a machine which would cost between $500,000 and $2 million." Afterwards, an appraiser named Bob Connelly valued the card at $850,000, based on the two previous paper analysis reports. In November 2005, Cobb and Edwards put the card up for sale on eBay. They had to shut down the sale, however, because Connelly only agreed to appraise the card if his report was printed in its entirety at the eBay card listing.

A few months after the sale, Edwards asked Connelly if he would accept the card for his auction. Connelly consented and took the card across the country to prospective buyers. Meanwhile, <a href="HBO">HBO</a>'s "<a href="Real%20Sports%20with%20Bryant%20Gumbel">Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel</a>" decided to cover the progress of Cobb and Edwards' struggles with the card. Connelly met a card dealer in New York City, Mike Mangasarian, who was sent on behalf of a prominent collector to check the card out. Mr. Mangasarian said the card seemed authentic and stated he would attend the auction for the card later on if the card could be taken out of the thick lucite holder for a closer examination. A promise was made that this could be done the day of the auction in Binghamton, NY. After the auction and by not bidding on the card Mr. Mangasarian revealed to HBO that he felt the back of the card was indeed real but in his opinion the front was not. He explained that all T-206's have dark brown letters printed for the team and players name and this one was in black. Additionally, he stated that he was not comfortable with the print process exhibited on the card front. Meanwhile, a number of card collectors who doubted the card contacted eBay and demanded that the card's listing on the website be removed. eBay officials finally pulled the plug the day before the actual Connelly auction was to begin. As a result, a number of previously interested collectors decided not to bid for the card at the auction the next day. As Connelly pointed out, the collectors chose not to make bids because "[w]hen eBay pulled the card ... it raised too many questions about its authenticity."

As a result of the publicity generated from the financially successful Gretzky T206 Honus Wagner, a number of previously undiscovered legitimate T206 Wagner cards have surfaced. There are fewer than 60 authenticated Wagner cards in existence.

An authentic card is part of the Leopold Morse Goulston Baseball Collection in <a href="The%20New%20York%20Public%20Library">The New York Public Library's</a> George Arents Collection.

<a href="http%3A//metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/90088606">An authentic card</a> is held by <a href="The%20Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">The Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in New York City.

In 2010, a rare Honus Wagner was found in a box left by the brother of Sister Virginia Muller who left all her possessions to the Baltimore-based <a href="School%20Sisters%20of%20Notre%20Dame">School Sisters of Notre Dame</a>. The card came with her brother's handwritten note: "Although damaged, the value of this baseball card should increase exponentially throughout the 21st century!" The Roman Catholic nuns auctioned the card, which despite its poor condition was expected to fetch between $150,000 and $200,000. On November 4, 2010, the final sale price exceeded the expectations of auctioneers at Dallas-based Heritage Auction Galleries and sold for $262,000 to Doug Walton, a collector and card-shop owner. Walton, however, never paid, and Heritage Auction Galleries subsequently contacted one of its longtime clients, Nicholas DePace, a New Jersey cardiologist, who immediately agreed to buy the card for the same price. On December 20, 2010, after taking its 19.5 percent buyer's premium, the auction house sent $220,000 by bank wire to the School Sisters of Notre Dame. The religious order had already announced that the proceeds from the sale would go to its ministries in more than 30 countries.

Many of the remaining T206 Honus Wagner cards in existence have rated low on the PSA grading scale. Only three existing Wagner cards received a PSA rating of EX [5] or better. One such example is known in the industry as the 'Jumbo Wagner' [shown on the right]. Graded EX 5 (MC) on the PSA grading scale, the card has unusually ample borders due to a miscut. These dimensions far exceed the standard size for a T206 baseball card virtually preserving a Near Mint example within its boundaries.

President of PSA, Joe Orlando said “The PSA EX 5 (MC) 1909-11 T206 Honus Wagner (serial number 15385994) is, without question, one of the top examples of this historic card known. The technical grade includes the MC qualifier. The card was given this designation by PSA due to its oversized nature. This particular T206 Honus Wagner stands out from other known examples and therefore gives it placement as a top-notch specimen."

Initially sold at auction for $1.62M in 2008, the 'Jumbo Wagner' was featured by Goldin Auctions in their 2013 Winter Auction, which closed on April 5, 2013. Historical price increases and the state of the sports collectible market contributed to projections that the auction could set a new overall price record for the sale of a T206 Honus Wagner. The card ultimately sold for $2,105,770.50, including the buyer's premium, a record price for a baseball card in a public auction.

In April 2013, Robert Edward Auctions was scheduled to begin an auction of a T206 Honus Wagner that was once owned by actor <a href="Charlie%20Sheen">Charlie Sheen</a>. Sheen had loaned the card to the All Star Cafe where it was stolen and later recovered by the <a href="FBI">FBI</a>. It is graded PSA 1.

The Guardian of Education

The Guardian of Education was the first successful <a href="Magazine">periodical</a> dedicated to reviewing <a href="children%27s%20literature">children's literature</a> in Britain. It was edited by 18th-century educationalist, children's author, and <a href="Sunday%20school">Sunday school</a> advocate <a href="Sarah%20Trimmer">Sarah Trimmer</a> and was published from June 1802 until September 1806 by J. Hatchard and <a href="Rivington%20%28publishers%29">F. C. and J. Rivington</a>. The journal offered child-rearing advice and assessments of contemporary educational theories, and Trimmer even proffered her own educational theory after evaluating the major works of the day.

Fearing the influence of <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>ary ideals, particularly those of philosopher <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, Trimmer emphasized <a href="Orthodoxy">orthodox</a> <a href="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a> and encouraged the perpetuation of the contemporary social and political order. Despite her conservatism, however, she agreed with Rousseau and other progressive <a href="Education%20reform">educational reformers</a> on many issues, such as the damaging effects of <a href="rote%20learning">rote learning</a> and the irrationalism of <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a>s.

"The Guardian of Education" was the first periodical to review children's books seriously and with a distinctive set of criteria. Trimmer's reviews were carefully thought out; they influenced publishers and authors to alter the content of their books, helped to define the new genre of children's literature, and greatly affected the sales of children's books. "The Guardian" also offered the first history of children's literature; establishing a list of landmark books, which scholars still use today.

<a href="Sarah%20Trimmer">Sarah Trimmer</a> was prompted to publish "The Guardian of Education" by the flood of new children's books on the market early in the nineteenth century and by her fear that those books might contain <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>ary values. The 1790s had been one of the most tumultuous decades in Europe's history, with the French revolution, increased demands for <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29%23United%20Kingdom">reform in Britain</a>, and the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>. Following this upsurge in <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29">radicalism</a>, a conservative backlash erupted in Britain; the "Guardian" was, in many ways, a part of this movement. In its pages, Trimmer denounced the Revolution and the philosophers whose works she believed were responsible for it, particularly <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>. She argued that there existed a vast conspiracy, organized by the <a href="Atheism">atheistic</a> and <a href="democracy">democratic</a> revolutionaries of France, to undermine and overthrow the legitimate governments of Europe. From her perspective, the conspirators were attempting to overturn traditional society by "endeavouring to infect the minds of the rising generation, through the medium of "Books of Education" and "Children's Books"" [emphasis Trimmer's]. She intended to combat this conspiracy by pointing parents towards properly Christian books.

Each issue of Trimmer's "Guardian" was divided into three sections: 1) extracts from texts which Trimmer thought would edify her adult readers (grouped under "Memoirs" and "Extracts from Sermons"); 2) an essay by Trimmer commenting on educational issues (contained in sections such as "Original Essays" and "Systems of Education Examined"); 3) and reviews of children's books. Trimmer herself wrote all of the essays listed under her name and all of the reviews, but she was not the author of the texts she extracted. The issues did not always consist of the same sections; for example, beginning in 1804 Trimmer started including an "Essay on Christian Education" and in 1805 occasionally reviewed "School books". Beginning a tradition that persists to this day, she divided the books she reviewed by age group: "Examination of Books for Children" (for those under fourteen) and "Books for Young Persons" (for those between fourteen and twenty-one).

Matthew Grenby, the foremost expert on Trimmer, estimates that the "Guardian"'s circulation was between 1,500 and 3,500 copies per issue. Thus the "Guardian"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s circulation was probably comparable to political periodicals such as the <a href="British%20Tory%20Party">Tory</a> "<a href="The%20Critical%20Review">Critical Review</a>" and the "<a href="British%20Critic">British Critic</a>", which both reached 3,500 by 1797, or the "<a href="Analytical%20Review">Analytical Review</a>", which reached about 1,500, but not to the "Monthly Review", which reached approximately 5,000. From June 1802 until January 1804, the "Guardian" appeared monthly; from then until it ceased publication in September 1806, it was issued quarterly. There were 28 issues in all.

Trimmer undertook a challenging task in publishing her periodical. According to Grenby, she aimed "to assess the current state of educational policy and praxis in Britain and to shape its future direction". To do so, she evaluated the educational theories of Rousseau, <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a>, <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>, <a href="Hannah%20More">Hannah More</a>, <a href="Madame%20de%20Genlis">Madame de Genlis</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Lancaster">Joseph Lancaster</a>, and <a href="Andrew%20Bell%20%28educationalist%29">Andrew Bell</a>, among others. In her "Essay on Christian Education", subsequently published separately as a pamphlet, she proposed her own comprehensive educational program.

"The Guardian of Education" was the first periodical to take the reviewing of children's books seriously. Trimmer's over four hundred reviews constituted a set of distinct and identifiable criteria regarding what was valuable in this new genre. As a <a href="high-church">high-church</a> <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a>, she was intent on protecting Christianity from <a href="secularism">secularism</a> as well as <a href="History%20of%20Evangelicalism">evangelicalism</a>, particularly as the latter manifested itself in <a href="Methodism">Methodism</a>. Her reviews also reveal her to be a staunch monarchist and opponent of the French Revolution. As Grenby puts it, "her initial questions of any children's books that came before her were always first, was it damaging to religion and second, was it damaging to political loyalty and the established social hierarchy". Religion was Trimmer's first priority and her emphasis on the doctrine of <a href="Biblical%20inerrancy">Biblical inerrancy</a> illustrated her fundamentalism. She wrote to a friend: "I will only say, that the more I reflect on the subject, the more I am convinced that it is not right to "supersede" the "figurative" style in which they speak of "God" and "divine things", my opinion is, that whoever attempts to teach the truths of divine revelation, should follow the "method" of the "inspired writers" as nearly as possible" [emphasis Trimmer's]. For Trimmer, the truth of the Bible was not only in its content, but also in its style, and some of her harshest reviews were written against texts that altered both the style and the substance of the Bible.

Trimmer's fundamentalism, Grenby argues, does not necessarily mark her as a rigid thinker. Grenby points out that Trimmer, like Rousseau, believed children were naturally good. In this view, she was arguing against centuries of tradition, particularly <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a>ical attitudes towards raising children (exemplified in the doctrine of <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a>). Although she attacked Rousseau's works, Grenby argues that she agreed with "Rousseau's key idea, later taken up by the <a href="Romanticism">Romantics</a>, that children should not be forced to become adults too early", in particular that they should not be exposed to political issues too soon. Trimmer also maintained that mothers and fathers should share the responsibility of caring for the family. Like the progressive educational reformers and children's authors <a href="Maria%20Edgeworth">Maria Edgeworth</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Day">Thomas Day</a> and even Rousseau himself, Trimmer opposed rote learning and advocated flexible and conversational lessons that encouraged critical thinking in children. She also promoted <a href="History%20of%20breastfeeding">breastfeeding</a> (a controversial position at the time) and parental involvement in childhood education.

In his analysis of her reviews, Grenby comes to the conclusion "Trimmer was ... not nearly so vitriolic in her reviewing as her reputation suggests... fewer than 50 [of the reviews] were chiefly negative, and of these only 18 were thoroughly excoriating. These were easily outweighed by the positive notices, although most of her reviews were mixed or – more surprisingly given her reputation for always impassioned appraisal – ambivalent." She objected primarily to texts that altered the Bible, such as <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin's</a> "Bible Stories" (1802), and secondarily to books that promoted ideas she associated with the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>. She also criticized the inclusion of scenes of death, characters who were insane, and representations of sexuality, as well as books that might frighten children. She typically praises books that encourage intellectual instruction, such as <a href="Anna%20Laetitia%20Barbauld">Anna Barbauld's</a> "<a href="Lessons%20for%20Children">Lessons for Children</a>" (1778–79).

Trimmer is perhaps most famous now for her condemnation of <a href="fairy%20tales">fairy tales</a>, such as the various translations of <a href="Charles%20Perrault">Charles Perrault's</a> "Histoires ou Contes du Temps passé" (1697). She disliked fairy tales because they endorsed an irrational view of the world and success without work. Trimmer's view of fairy tales, although often ridiculed by modern critics, was widespread at the end of the eighteenth century, in part because most educators accepted <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke's</a> theory that the mind was a "<a href="tabula%20rasa">tabula rasa</a>" and therefore particularly sensitive to impressions early in life. Trimmer was opposed to fairy tales that were not grounded in reality and which would "excite an unregulated sensibility" in the reader. Without a proper moral or a moralizing narrator, fairy tales could lead a reader astray. Above all, she was concerned about "unmediated", unknown, and unsupervised feelings in the child reader. One of the reasons Trimmer believed fairy tales were dangerous was because they led child readers into a fantasy world where adults could not follow and control their exposure to harmful experiences. She was just as horrified by the graphic illustrations included with some fairy tale collections, complaining that "little children, whose minds are susceptible of every impression; and who from the liveliness of their imaginations are apt to convert into realities whatever forcibly strikes their fancy" should not be allowed to see such scenes as <a href="Bluebeard">Blue Beard</a> hacking his wife's head off.

Fairy tales were often found in <a href="chapbook">chapbook</a>s—cheap, disposable literature—which contained sensational stories such as <a href="Jack%20the%20Giant%20Killer">Jack the Giant Killer</a> along with lewder tales such as "How to restore a lost Maidenhead, or solder a Crackt one". Chapbooks were the literature of the poor and Trimmer attempted to separate children's literature from texts she associated with the lower classes. Trimmer criticized the values associated with fairy tales, accusing them of perpetuating irrationality, superstition, and unfavorable images of stepparents. Rather than seeing Trimmer as a censor of fairy tales, therefore, children's literature scholar <a href="Nicholas%20Tucker">Nicholas Tucker</a> has argued, "by considering fairy tales as fair game for criticism rather than unthinking worship, Mrs Trimmer is at one with scholars today who have also written critically about the ideologies found in some individual stories".

Trimmer's views of the French "<a href="philosophes">philosophes</a>" were shaped by <a href="Abb%C3%A9%20Barruel">Abbé Barruel's</a> "<a href="Memoirs%20Illustrating%20the%20History%20of%20Jacobinism">Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism</a>" (1797–98) (she extracted large sections from this text into the "Guardian" itself) but also by her fears of the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">ongoing wars between France and Britain during the 1790s</a>. Trimmer emphasized Christianity above all in her writings and maintained that one should to turn to God in times of trial. As children's literature scholar M. Nancy Cutt argues, Trimmer and writers like her "claimed emphatically that the degree of human happiness was in direct proportion to the degree of submission to the divine Will. Thus they repudiated the moralists' view that learning should exalt reason and work to the temporal happiness of the individual, which was governed by the best interests of society." Trimmer and her allies contended that French pedagogical theories led to an immoral nation, specifically, "<a href="deism">deism</a>, infidelity and revolution".

Although one previous attempt had been made to regularly review British children's books it was not as comprehensive, did not last as long, and was not nearly as influential as Trimmer's "Guardian". Grenby suggests, for example, that Godwin changed the name of his "Bible Stories" to "Sacred Histories" after Trimmer's attack on it and the publishers of <a href="John%20Newbery">John Newbery's</a> "Tom Telescope and the Philosophy of Tops and Balls" immediately removed the material Trimmer found offensive. Other scholars have argued that authors wrote with Trimmer's reviewing criteria in mind, one going so far as to call it "a manual for prospective writers". However, Trimmer's reviews were not always heeded; for example, her negative review of the <a href="sensibility">sentimental</a> works of <a href="Edward%20Augustus%20Kendall">Edward Augustus Kendall</a>, such as "<a href="Keeper%27s%20Travels%20in%20Search%20of%20His%20Master">Keeper's Travels in Search of His Master</a>", did little to dampen the sales of his works.

With its four hundred reviews, "The Guardian of Education", as Grenby writes, "contributed to the establishment of children's literature as a secure, permanent and respectable literary genre". By excluding <a href="novel">novel</a>s, <a href="chapbook">chapbook</a>s, <a href="tract%20%28literature%29">tracts</a>, <a href="ballad">ballad</a>s, and <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a>s, it effectively decided what counted as children's literature and what did not. Furthermore, in one of her early essays, "Observations on the Changes which have taken place in Books for Children and Young Persons", Trimmer wrote the first history of children's literature. Its landmark books, such as Sarah Fielding's "<a href="The%20Governess%2C%20or%20The%20Little%20Female%20Academy">The Governess</a>" (1749) and John Newbery's "<a href="The%20History%20of%20Little%20Goody%20Two%20Shoes">The History of Little Goody Two Shoes</a>" (1765), are still cited today by scholars as important in the development of children's literature.

It was not until the last quarter of the nineteenth century, with the publication of the work of children's author and literary critic <a href="Charlotte%20Yonge">Charlotte Yonge</a>, that any sustained reviewing or historicizing of children's literature took place again.

Royal Blue (train)

The Royal Blue was the <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O)</a>'s flagship <a href="passenger%20train">passenger train</a> between New York City and Washington, D.C., in the United States, beginning in 1890. The Baltimore-based B&O also used the name between 1890 and 1917 for its improved passenger service between New York and Washington launched in the 1890s, collectively dubbed the Royal Blue Line. Using variants such as the "Royal Limited" and "Royal Special" for individual "Royal Blue" trains, the B&O operated the service in partnership with the <a href="Reading%20Company">Reading Railroad</a> and the <a href="Central%20Railroad%20of%20New%20Jersey">Central Railroad of New Jersey</a>. Principal intermediate cities served were <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Wilmington%2C%20Delaware">Wilmington</a>, and <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>. Later, as Europe reeled from the carnage of World War I and connotations of European royalty fell into disfavor, the B&O discreetly omitted the sobriquet "Royal Blue Line" from its New York passenger service and the "Royal Blue" disappeared from B&O timetables. Beginning in 1917, former "Royal Blue Line" trains were renamed: the "Royal Limited" (inaugurated on May 15, 1898), for example, became the "<a href="National%20Limited">National Limited</a>", continuing west from Washington to <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis</a> via <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>. During the <a href="Great%20Depression">Depression</a>, the B&O hearkened back to the halcyon pre-World War I era when it launched a re-christened "Royal Blue" train between New York and Washington in 1935. The B&O finally discontinued passenger service north of Baltimore on April 26, 1958, and the "Royal Blue" faded into history.

Railroad historian Herbert Harwood said, in his seminal history of the service, "First conceived in late Victorian times to promote a new railroad line ... it was indeed one of the most memorable images in the transportation business, an inspired blend of majesty and mystique ... Royal Blue Line ... Royal Blue Trains ... the "Royal Blue" all meant different things at different times. But essentially they all symbolized one thing: the B&O's regal route." Between the 1890s and World War I, the B&O's six daily "Royal Blue" trains providing service between New York and Washington were noted for their luxury, elegant appearance, and speed. The car interiors were paneled in <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a>, had fully enclosed vestibules (instead of open platforms, still widely in use at the time on U.S. railroads), then-modern heating and lighting, and <a href="Lead%20glass">leaded glass</a> windows. The car exteriors were painted a deep "<a href="Royal%20blue">Royal Saxony blue</a>" color with <a href="gold%20leaf">gold leaf</a> trim.

The B&O's use of <a href="Railway%20electrification%20system">electrification</a> instead of steam power in a Baltimore tunnel on the Royal Blue Line, beginning in 1895, marked the first use of electric locomotives by an American railroad and presaged the dawn of practical alternatives to steam power in the 20th century. Spurred by intense competition from the formidable <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a>, the dominant railroad in the lucrative New York–Washington market since the 1880s, the "Royal Blue" in its mid-1930s reincarnation was noted for a number of technological innovations, including <a href="Streamliner">streamlining</a> and the first non-<a href="Articulated%20car">articulated</a> <a href="diesel%20locomotive">diesel locomotive</a> on a passenger train in the U.S., a harbinger of the <a href="steam%20locomotive">steam locomotive</a>'s eventual demise.

Prior to 1884, the B&O and the Philadelphia-based <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> both used the independent <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Wilmington%20and%20Baltimore%20Railroad">Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad</a> (PW&B) between <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, Maryland, and <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, Pennsylvania, for their New York–Washington freight and passenger trains. In 1881, the Pennsylvania Railroad purchased a controlling interest in the PW&B, and in 1884 it denied the B&O further use of the PW&B to reach Philadelphia.

The B&O then built a new line from Baltimore to connect to the <a href="Philadelphia%20and%20Reading%20Railroad">Philadelphia and Reading Railroad</a> in Philadelphia, completed in 1886. The B&O's passenger trains then used the Reading's <a href="New%20York%20Branch">New York Branch</a> northward from Philadelphia to <a href="Bound%20Brook%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bound Brook, New Jersey</a>, where the Jersey Central's rails were used to reach the <a href="Communipaw%20Terminal">Communipaw Terminal</a> in <a href="Jersey%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Jersey City</a>. From Communipaw passengers connected to ferries for a twelve-minute crossing of the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> to either <a href="Liberty%20Street%20Ferry%20Terminal">Liberty Street Ferry Terminal</a> or <a href="Whitehall%20Terminal">Whitehall Terminal</a> in lower Manhattan.

The new route presented problems in Baltimore, because a ferry boat was necessary to cross the harbor between <a href="Locust%20Point%2C%20Baltimore">Locust Point</a> and <a href="Canton%2C%20Baltimore">Canton</a> to connect with the B&O's Washington Branch. The solution was the <a href="Baltimore%20Belt%20Line">Baltimore Belt Line</a>, which included a long tunnel under Howard Street in downtown Baltimore. Work began on the tunnel in 1891 and was completed on May 1, 1895, when the first train traversed the tunnel. To avoid smoke problems from steam engines working upgrade in the long tunnel under the middle of Baltimore, the B&O pioneered the first mainline <a href="Railway%20electrification%20system">electrification</a> of a U.S. railroad, installing an overhead <a href="third%20rail">third rail</a> system in the tunnel and its approaches. An electric locomotive first pulled a "Royal Blue" train through the Howard Street tunnel on June 27, 1895.
The project also included the construction of B&O's second passenger terminal in Baltimore, <a href="Mount%20Royal%20Station">Mount Royal Station</a>, at the north end of the Howard Street tunnel in the fashionable <a href="Bolton%20Hill">Bolton Hill</a> neighborhood. Designed by Baltimore architect <a href="Ephraim%20Francis%20Baldwin">E. Francis Baldwin</a> in a blend of modified <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> and <a href="Renaissance%20architecture">Renaissance</a> styling, the station was built of Maryland <a href="granite">granite</a> trimmed with <a href="Indiana%20Limestone">Indiana limestone</a>, with a red tile roof and landmark <a href="clocktower">clocktower</a>. The station's interior featured marble mosaic flooring, a fireplace, and rocking chairs. It opened the following year on September 1, 1896. "It was considered," said "<a href="the%20Baltimore%20Sun">the Baltimore Sun</a>", "the most splendid station in the country built and used by only one railroad." That evaluation was shared by railroad historian <a href="Lucius%20Beebe">Lucius Beebe</a>, who proclaimed Mount Royal "one of the celebrated railroad stations of the world, ranking in renown with <a href="Euston%20railway%20station%23Old%20building">Euston Station, London</a>, scene of so many of <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>' departures, the <a href="Gare%20du%20Nord">Gare du Nord</a> in Paris, and the feudal fortress of the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania [Railroad</a>] at <a href="Broad%20Street%20Station%20%28Philadelphia%29">Broad Street, Philadelphia</a>".

Even before the Baltimore Belt Line project was finished, the B&O launched its "Royal Blue" service on July 31, 1890. Powered by <a href="4-6-0">4-6-0</a> <a href="steam%20locomotive">steam locomotive</a>s having exceptionally large diameter <a href="driving%20wheel">driving wheel</a>s for speed, the "Royal Blue" trains occasionally reached . After the Baltimore Belt Line project was completed, travel time between New York and Washington was reduced to five hours, compared to nine hours in the late 1860s.
The trains were noted for their elegance and luxury. The parlor cars' ceilings and upholstery were covered in royal blue, and the dining cars "Queen" and "Waldorf", panelled in <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a>, featured elaborate cuisine such as <a href="terrapin">terrapin</a> and <a href="canvasback">canvasback</a> prepared by French-trained chefs. A "Railway Age" magazine article of the time reporting on the "Royal Blue" called it "the climax in railway car building".

As a result of the U.S. entry into World War I and resulting congestion on the nation's railroads, the wartime <a href="United%20States%20Railroad%20Administration">U.S. Railroad Administration (USRA)</a> ordered the Pennsylvania Railroad to permit B&O passenger trains to use its <a href="North%20River%20Tunnels">Hudson River tunnels</a> and <a href="Pennsylvania%20Station%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Pennsylvania Station</a> in Manhattan, beginning April 28, 1918, eliminating the B&O's need for the ferry connection from Jersey City. Following the end of World War I, the Pennsylvania Railroad continued to allow B&O passenger trains to use Pennsylvania Station for another eight years. On September 1, 1926, the Pennsylvania Railroad terminated its contract with the B&O, and the latter's trains reverted to the use of the <a href="Central%20Railroad%20of%20New%20Jersey">Jersey Central</a>'s <a href="Communipaw%20Terminal">Jersey City terminal</a>. Passengers were then transferred to buses that met the train right on the platform. These buses were ferried across the Hudson River into <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> and <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, where they proceeded to various "stations" around the city on four different routes, including the Vanderbilt Hotel, <a href="Wanamaker%27s">Wanamaker's</a>, <a href="Columbus%20Circle">Columbus Circle</a>, and <a href="Rockefeller%20Center">Rockefeller Center</a>. B&O's busiest "Royal Blue" bus terminal at in Manhattan opened on December 17, 1928. Connected to <a href="Grand%20Central%20Terminal">Grand Central Terminal</a> by an underground <a href="concourse">concourse</a>, it was trimmed in <a href="marble">marble</a> and furnished with <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> lighting fixtures and leather sofas. This arrangement would continue until the eventual demise of the "Royal Blue" in 1958.

As the 1930s dawned, the B&O's New York passenger service faced two significant competitive disadvantages, compared to the Pennsylvania Railroad. First, the B&O lacked direct access to Manhattan, resulting in slower overall travel time. Second, the Pennsylvania's move in the early 1930s to replace steam power with modern, smokeless <a href="Railway%20electrification%20system">electric service</a> along its entire New York–Washington mainline was met with enthusiastic public approval. The B&O responded by introducing <a href="Diesel%20locomotive">Diesel locomotive</a>s, air conditioning, and <a href="streamliner">streamlining</a> on its New York trains. On June 24, 1935, the B&O inaugurated the first lightweight, streamlined train in the eastern U.S., when it began operating a re-christened "Royal Blue" train between Washington and New York. When the specially modified <a href="4-4-4">4-4-4</a>-type steam locomotive prepared for the run proved less than satisfactory in terms of stability at speed, a new <a href="EMC%201800%20hp%20B-B">EMC 1800 hp B-B</a> diesel-electric engine with a carbody by <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a> and mechanicals by <a href="Electro-Motive%20Corporation">Electro-Motive Corporation</a> and numbered 50 replaced it, which was yet another first east of the Mississippi River. In 1937 this was replaced with the more demurely streamlined locomotive # 51 and booster 51x, among the first of the new <a href="EMD%20E-unit">E-Series</a> road Diesel locomotives from General Motors' <a href="Electro-Motive%20Diesel">Electro Motive Company</a>. Previously, early experiments with <a href="internal%20combustion%20engine">internal combustion engine</a>s to replace steam in railroad applications included short, articulated trainsets (such as <a href="Chicago%2C%20Burlington%20and%20Quincy%20Railroad">Burlington</a>'s "<a href="Pioneer%20Zephyr">Pioneer Zephyr</a>" and <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railroad">Union Pacific</a>'s "<a href="M-10000">M-10000</a>"), double-head sets of "boxcab" locomotives (developed by EMC) used to power the 1936 version of the <a href="AT%26amp%3BSF">AT&SF</a> (Santa Fe) "<a href="Super%20Chief">Super Chief</a>" (similar to number 50), and the cab/booster unit combinations developed with Union Pacific's <a href="M-10002">M-10002</a> and <a href="M-10003%20to%20M-10006">M-10003 - M-10006</a> trainsets. The E units took the most advanced developments of Diesel locomotive technology and made them available to all operators using the consists of their choice, and allowed Number 50 and the aluminum trainset to migrate west to subsidiary <a href="Alton%20Railroad">Alton</a>, where it operated as the "<a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%20%28train%29">Abraham Lincoln</a>". The earliest adopters of the new E units demonstrated the improved flexibility, efficiency and reduced maintenance costs of Diesel power in daily service compared to steam and gave impetus to the Dieselization of the railroad industry.

Recalling the past glamor of the 1890s "Royal Blue Line", the B&O introduced its "Martha Washington"-series dining cars, which were particularly noted for their fresh <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> cuisine, served on Dresden china in ornate cars with glass chandeliers and colonial-style furnishings. The B&O's manager of dining car services said his department's objective was "...to be hospitable to our patrons in all respects – to make them feel the comfort, convenience and homelike atmosphere of our accommodations as soon as they step on our trains." Dining car specialties included oysters and Chesapeake Bay fish served with cornmeal muffins. B&O president <a href="Daniel%20Willard">Daniel Willard</a> personally sampled his dining cars' cuisine while traveling about the line, and recognized particularly pleasing meals with letters of appreciation and autographed pictures given to the dining car chefs.
The B&O was not entirely satisfied with the ride quality of the lightweight "Royal Blue" train, however, and replaced it on April 25, 1937, with streamlined, refurbished heavyweight equipment, painted light gray and royal blue with gold striping, designed by <a href="Otto%20Kuhler">Otto Kuhler</a>. The B&O conveyed the displaced trainset to the <a href="Alton%20Railroad">Alton Railroad</a>, where it ran as the "<a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%20%28train%29">Abraham Lincoln</a>" for decades. The train was pulled by the streamlined Diesel locomotive, B&O # 51, of the 3,600 <a href="Horsepower">h.p.</a> <a href="EMC%20EA/EB">EMC EA/EB</a> model built by Electro Motive Company. Praised for its beauty and handsome profile, this first streamlined production model Diesel "dazzled the press and public", said one magazine writer of the groundbreaking locomotive's introduction. Kuhler also streamlined one of B&O's <a href="4-6-2">4-6-2 "Pacific"</a> <a href="steam%20locomotive">steam locomotive</a>s for use on the "Royal Blue". Its bullet-shaped shroud became an iconic image for the "Royal Blue" and was modeled for years by <a href="American%20Flyer">American Flyer</a>. <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time" magazine</a>, in reporting on the precarious financial condition of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and other Depression-ravaged rail lines in 1937, referred to the B&O's "swashbuckling" Royal Blue streamliner launched that year as having "symbolize[d] the new era in railroading ..."

President of the United States <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> was a frequent passenger on the B&O's "Royal Blue Line" during his time in office (1933–1945), when he traveled between Washington and his family home in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20New%20York">Hyde Park, New York</a>. A special presidential train from Washington used the regular B&O–Reading–Jersey Central route to Jersey City, continuing on the <a href="New%20York%20Central%20Railroad">New York Central Railroad</a>'s <a href="West%20Shore%20Railroad">West Shore Line</a> along the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> to <a href="Highland%2C%20Ulster%20County%2C%20New%20York">Highland, New York</a> (opposite <a href="Poughkeepsie%20%28city%29%2C%20New%20York">Poughkeepsie</a>), where the President was met by automobile.

Along with most other rail passenger services in the U.S. during World War II, the "Royal Blue" enjoyed a surge in passenger traffic between 1942 and 1945 as volume doubled to passengers annually on B&O's eight daily New York–Washington trains. Following the end of the war, however, passenger volumes soon dropped below prewar levels and the B&O discontinued one of its daily New York–Washington trains. In addition to its flagship "Royal Blue", six other B&O passenger trains continued to serve New York until April 1958: the "<a href="Metropolitan%20Special">Metropolitan Special</a>", <a href="Capitol%20Limited%20%28B%26amp%3BO%20train%29">"Capitol Limited"</a>, "<a href="National%20Limited">National Limited</a>", "<a href="Diplomat%20%28train%29">Diplomat</a>", <a href="Marylander%20%28train%29">"Marylander"</a>, and "<a href="Shenandoah%20%28B%26amp%3BO%20train%29">Shenandoah</a>".

Although all of B&O's Washington–Jersey City passenger trains had been fully dieselized by September 28, 1947, no new passenger cars were built for the "Royal Blue" in the postwar period. The refurbished 1937 "Royal Blue" trainset continued in operation to the end. The overwhelming market dominance of the Pennsylvania Railroad was evident when it introduced the <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a> "Morning Congressional" and "Afternoon Congressional" streamliners in 1952. By the late 1950s, most U.S. passenger trains suffered a steep decline in patronage as the traveling public abandoned trains in favor of airplanes and automobiles, utilizing improved <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway</a>s. The "Royal Blue" was no exception, as operating deficits approached annually and passenger volume declined by almost half between 1946 and 1957. Amidst the downward trend, the Royal Blue Line briefly recaptured the regal splendor of its early years on October 21, 1957, when <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> and <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip</a> travelled on the B&O from Washington to New York.

As financial losses mounted, the B&O finally ceded the New York–Washington market to the Pennsylvania Railroad altogether, discontinuing all passenger service north of Baltimore on Saturday, April 26, 1958, and bringing the venerable "Royal Blue" to an end. As the engineer was about to ease the locomotive's throttle open for the "Royal Blue's" final departure from <a href="Union%20Station%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">Washington Union Station</a> at 3:45 p.m., the event was covered in a trainside <a href="remote%20broadcast">remote broadcast</a> by <a href="Edward%20R.%20Murrow">Edward R. Murrow</a> on a <a href="CBS">CBS</a> network "<a href="See%20It%20Now">See It Now</a>" <a href="television%20special">television special</a>. The train's 7:49 p.m. arrival at Jersey City Terminal was met by news reporters from "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>", <a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">"Life" magazine</a> and "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Evening%20Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>", on hand to cover the legendary "Royal Blue"'s demise. In an editorial the next day, the "<a href="Baltimore%20Sun">Baltimore Sun</a>" lamented the end of the "Royal Blue", saying it "may have been one of the most famous named trains in history". "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", in a <a href="wikt%3Afront%20page">front page</a> article accompanied by a photograph of train engineer Michael Goodnight bidding farewell to a 7-year old passenger, said "It was a sad and simple story yesterday as the nation's oldest railroad discontinued its crack "Royal Blue" and its five other passenger trains ... end[ing] sixty-eight years of continuous through service, operated in a gentlemanly fashion ... a kind of ante-bellum, gracious way of life ... and the reputation for very special service."

Mount Royal Station continued as the eastern terminus of B&O's passenger service until June 30, 1961, when it closed permanently as a rail passenger facility. It was one of thirteen Baltimore buildings selected in 1959 for the <a href="Historic%20American%20Buildings%20Survey">Historic American Buildings Survey</a>. The building and <a href="Train%20shed">trainshed</a> were subsequently acquired by the <a href="Maryland%20Institute%20College%20of%20Art">Maryland Institute College of Art</a> (MICA) in 1964 and are preserved as examples of late 19th century industrial architecture.

In the 1890s–1910s period, the "Royal Limited" operated in both directions simultaneously, with 3 p.m. departures in New York and Washington, arriving at its destination five hours later, at 8 p.m. By the 1930s, travel time between Jersey City and Washington was reduced to four hours. From 1935 to the end of service in 1958, the "Royal Blue" made a daily round trip, departing New York in the morning and returning from Washington in the evening. According to the "<a href="Official%20Guide%20of%20the%20Railways">Official Guide</a>" of February, 1956, the "Royal Blue" operated on the following schedule as train (unconditional stops highlighted in blue, bus connections in yellow):

Eastbound, the train departed Washington at 3:45 p.m. as train # 28, arriving at Jersey City 7:40 p.m.

Between 1937 and 1958, the "Royal Blue" was equipped with air-conditioned coaches, parlor cars with private <a href="Drawing%20room%23Railroad%20usage">drawing rooms</a>, a <a href="lounge%20car">lounge car</a> for coach passengers, a full <a href="dining%20car">dining car</a> serving complete meals, and a flat-end <a href="observation%20car">observation car</a> with a "cafe-lounge" bringing up the rear of the train. Beginning in mid-August 1947, onboard telephone service was provided, making the B&O (along with the Pennsylvania Railroad and the <a href="New%20York%20Central%20Railroad">New York Central Railroad</a>) one of the first three railroads in the U.S. to offer telephone service on its trains, using a forerunner of <a href="mobile%20phone">cell phone</a> technology.

Matanikau Offensive

The Matanikau Offensive, from 1–4 November 1942, sometimes referred to as the Fourth Battle of the Matanikau, was an engagement between United States (U.S.) <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marine</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Army">Army</a> and <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Imperial Japanese</a> <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Army</a> forces around the <a href="Matanikau%20River">Matanikau River</a> and <a href="Point%20Cruz">Point Cruz</a> area on <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> during the <a href="Guadalcanal%20campaign">Guadalcanal campaign</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The action was one of the last of a series of engagements between U.S. and Japanese forces near the Matanikau River during the campaign.

In the engagement, seven battalions of U.S. Marine and Army troops under the overall command of <a href="Alexander%20Vandegrift">Alexander Vandegrift</a> and tactical command of <a href="Merritt%20A.%20Edson">Merritt A. Edson</a>, following up on the U.S. victory in the <a href="Battle%20for%20Henderson%20Field">Battle for Henderson Field</a>, crossed the Matanikau River and attacked Japanese Army units between the river and Point Cruz, on the northern Guadalcanal coast. The area was defended by the Japanese Army's 4th Infantry Regiment under <a href="Nomasu%20Nakaguma">Nomasu Nakaguma</a> along with various other support troops, under the overall command of <a href="Harukichi%20Hyakutake">Harukichi Hyakutake</a>. After inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese defenders, U.S. forces halted the offensive and temporarily withdrew because of a perceived threat from Japanese forces elsewhere in the Guadalcanal area.

On 7 August 1942, Allied forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, <a href="Tulagi">Tulagi</a>, and <a href="Florida%20Islands">Florida Islands</a> in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as <a href="Military%20base">bases</a> for threatening the <a href="materiel">supply</a> routes between the U.S. and Australia, and to secure the islands as starting points for a <a href="Military%20campaign">campaign</a> with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> while also supporting the Allied <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>. The landings initiated the six-month-long <a href="Guadalcanal%20campaign">Guadalcanal campaign</a>.

Taking the Japanese by surprise, by nightfall on 8 August, the 11,000 Allied troops, under the command of <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> Alexander Vandegrift and mainly consisting of United States Marine Corps units, had <a href="Battle%20of%20Tulagi%20and%20Gavutu-Tanambogo">secured Tulagi</a> and nearby small islands, as well as an airfield under construction at <a href="Lunga%20Point">Lunga Point</a> on Guadalcanal. The airfield was later named Henderson Field by Allied forces. The Allied aircraft that subsequently operated out of the airfield became known as the "<a href="Cactus%20Air%20Force">Cactus Air Force</a>" (CAF) after the Allied codename for Guadalcanal. To protect the airfield, the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point.

In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a> assigned the Imperial Japanese Army's <a href="Seventeenth%20Army%20%28Japan%29">17th Army</a>, a <a href="corps">corps</a>-sized command based at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant-General Harukichi Hyakutake, with the task of retaking Guadalcanal from Allied forces. Beginning on 19 August, various units of the 17th Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal with the goal of driving Allied forces from the island.
Because of the threat by CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field, the Japanese were unable to use large, slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island. Instead, the Japanese used warships based at Rabaul and the <a href="Shortland%20Islands">Shortland Islands</a> to carry their forces to Guadalcanal. The Japanese warships, mainly light <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s or <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s from the <a href="IJN%208th%20Fleet">Eighth Fleet</a> under the command of <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Gunichi%20Mikawa">Gunichi Mikawa</a>, were usually able to make the round trip down "<a href="The%20Slot">The Slot</a>" to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack. Delivering the troops in this manner, however, prevented most of the soldiers' heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, from being carried to Guadalcanal with them. These high speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the "<a href="Tokyo%20Express">Tokyo Express</a>" by Allied forces and "Rat Transportation" by the Japanese.

The first Japanese attempt to recapture Henderson Field failed when a 917-man force was defeated on 21 August in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Tenaru">Battle of the Tenaru</a>. The next attempt took place from 12–14 September, with the <a href="Kawaguchi%20Detachment">6,000 soldiers</a> under the command of Major General <a href="Kiyotake%20Kawaguchi">Kiyotake Kawaguchi</a> being defeated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Edson%27s%20Ridge">Battle of Edson's Ridge</a>. After their defeat at Edson's Ridge, Kawaguchi and the surviving Japanese troops regrouped west of the <a href="Matanikau%20River">Matanikau River</a> on Guadalcanal.

As the Japanese regrouped, the U.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga defenses. On 18 September, an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 men from the <a href="U.S.%207th%20Marine%20Regiment">U.S. 7th Marine Regiment</a> to Guadalcanal. These reinforcements allowed Vandegrift, beginning on 19 September, to establish an unbroken line of defense completely around the Lunga perimeter.

General Vandegrift and his staff were aware that Kawaguchi's troops had retreated to the area west of the Matanikau and that numerous groups of Japanese stragglers were scattered throughout the area between the Lunga Perimeter and the Matanikau River. Vandegrift, therefore, decided to conduct a <a href="Actions%20along%20the%20Matanikau">series of small unit operations</a> around the Matanikau Valley.
The first U.S. Marine operation against Japanese forces west of the Matanikau, conducted between 23 September and 27 September 1942 by elements of three U.S. Marine <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s, was repulsed by Kawaguchi's troops under Colonel <a href="Akinosuke%20Oka">Akinosuke Oka</a>'s local command. In the second action, between 6 October and 9 October, a larger force of U.S. Marines successfully crossed the Matanikau River, attacked newly landed Japanese forces from the <a href="2nd%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">2nd (Sendai) Infantry Division</a> under the command of generals <a href="Masao%20Maruyama%20%28Lieutenant%20General%29">Masao Maruyama</a> and <a href="Yumio%20Nasu">Yumio Nasu</a> and inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese <a href="Aoba%20Detachment">4th Infantry Regiment</a>. The second action forced the Japanese to retreat from their positions east of the Matanikau.

In the meantime, Major General <a href="Millard%20Harmon">Millard F. Harmon</a>, commander of United States Army forces in the South Pacific, convinced Vice Admiral <a href="Robert%20L.%20Ghormley">Robert L. Ghormley</a>, commander of Allied forces in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20Areas%20%28command%29">South Pacific Area</a>, that U.S. Marine forces on Guadalcanal needed to be reinforced immediately if the Allies were to successfully defend the island from the anticipated Japanese offensive. Thus on 13 October, a naval convoy delivered the 2,837-strong <a href="164th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">164th U.S. Infantry Regiment</a>, a <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a> <a href="Army%20National%20Guard">Army National Guard</a> formation from the U.S. Army's <a href="Americal%20Division">Americal Division</a>, to Guadalcanal.

Between 1 October and 17 October, the Japanese delivered 15,000 troops to Guadalcanal, giving Hyakutake 20,000 total troops to employ for his planned offensive. Because of the loss of their positions on the east side of the Matanikau, the Japanese decided that an attack on the U.S. defenses along the coast would be prohibitively difficult. Therefore, Hyakutake decided that the main thrust of his planned attack would be from south of Henderson Field. His 2nd Division (augmented by troops from the <a href="38th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">38th Infantry Division</a>), under Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama and comprising 7,000 soldiers in three infantry regiments of three battalions each was ordered to march through the jungle and attack the American defences from the south near the east bank of the <a href="Lunga%20River%20%28Guadalcanal%29">Lunga River</a>. To distract the Americans from the planned attack from the south, Hyakutake's heavy artillery plus five battalions of infantry (about 2,900 men) from the 4th and 124th Infantry Regiments under the overall command of Major General <a href="Tadashi%20Sumiyoshi">Tadashi Sumiyoshi</a> were to attack the American defenses from the west along the coastal corridor.
Sumiyoshi's forces, including two battalions of the 4th Infantry Regiment under Colonel <a href="Nomasu%20Nakaguma">Nomasu Nakaguma</a>, launched attacks on the U.S. Marine defenses at the mouth of the Matanikau on the evening of 23 October. U.S. Marine artillery, cannon, and small arms fire repulsed the assaults and killed many of the attacking Japanese soldiers while suffering only light casualties to themselves.

Beginning on 24 October and continuing over two consecutive nights, Maruyama's forces conducted numerous, unsuccessful frontal assaults on the southern portion of the U.S. Lunga perimeter. More than 1,500 of Maruyama's troops were killed in the attacks while the Americans lost about 60 killed.

Further Japanese attacks near the Matanikau on 26 October by Oka's 124th Infantry Regiment were also repulsed with heavy losses for the Japanese. Thus, at 08:00 on 26 October, Hyakutake called off any further attacks and ordered his forces to retreat. About half of Maruyama's survivors were ordered to retreat back to the area west of the Matanikau River while the rest, the 230th Infantry Regiment under Colonel Toshinari Shoji, was told to head for <a href="Koli%20Point">Koli Point</a>, east of the Lunga perimeter. The 4th Infantry Regiment retreated back to positions west of the Matanikau and around the Point Cruz area while the 124th Infantry Regiment took up positions on the slopes of Mount Austen in the upper Matanikau Valley.
In order to exploit the recent victory Vandegrift planned another offensive west of the Matanikau which would have two objectives: to drive the Japanese beyond artillery range of Henderson Field and to cut off the retreat of Maruyama's men towards the village of Kokumbona, location of the 17th Army's headquarters. For the offensive, Vandegrift committed the three battalions of the <a href="5th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">5th Marine Regiment</a>, commanded by Colonel <a href="Merritt%20Edson">Merritt Edson</a>, plus the augmented <a href="3rd%20Battalion%207th%20Marines">3d Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment</a> (called the Whaling Group) commanded by Colonel <a href="William%20Whaling">William Whaling</a>. Two battalions of the <a href="2nd%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Marine Regiment</a> would be in reserve. The offensive was supported by artillery from the <a href="11th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">11th Marine Regiment</a> and the 164th Infantry Regiment, CAF aircraft, and gunfire from <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> warships. Edson was placed in tactical command of the operation.

Defending the Matanikau area for the Japanese were the 4th and 124th Infantry Regiments. Nakaguma's 4th Infantry defended the Matanikau from the shore to about inland while Oka's 124th Infantry extended the line further inland along the river. Both regiments, which on paper consisted of six battalions, were severely understrength because of battle damage, tropical disease, and malnutrition. In fact, Oka described his command as at only "half strength."

Between 01:00 and 06:00 on 1 November, U.S. Marine engineers constructed three footbridges across the Matanikau. At 06:30, nine Marine and <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> artillery batteries (about 36 guns) and U.S. warships , , and opened fire on the west bank of the Matanikau, and U.S. aircraft, including 19 <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">B-17</a> <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a>s, dropped bombs in the same area. At the same time, the <a href="1st%20Battalion%205th%20Marines">1st Battalion</a> (1/5) of the 5th Marine Regiment crossed the Matanikau at its mouth while the <a href="2nd%20Battalion%205th%20Marines">2nd Battalion</a>, 5th Marines (2/5) and the Whaling Group crossed the river further inland. Facing the Marines was the Japanese 2nd Battalion, 4th Infantry under Major Masao Tamura.
The 2/5 and the Whaling Group encountered very little resistance and reached and occupied several ridges south of Point Cruz by early afternoon. Along the coast near Point Cruz, however, the 7th Company from Tamura's battalion fiercely resisted the U.S. advance. In several hours of fighting, Company C, 1/5 suffered heavy casualties, including the loss of three officers, and was driven back toward the Matanikau by Tamura's troops. Assisted by another company from 1/5 and later by two companies from the <a href="3rd%20Battalion%205th%20Marines">3rd Battalion</a>, 5th Marines (3/5), plus determined resistance by Marine Corporal <a href="Anthony%20Casamento">Anthony Casamento</a>, among others, the Americans were successful in stopping the retreat.

Reviewing the situation at the end of the day, Edson, along with Colonel <a href="Gerald%20C.%20Thomas">Gerald Thomas</a> and <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="Merrill%20B.%20Twining">Merrill Twining</a> from Vandegrift's staff, decided to try to encircle the Japanese defenders around Point Cruz. They ordered 1/5 and 3/5 to continue to press the Japanese along the coast the next day while 2/5 wheeled north to envelop their adversaries west and south of Point Cruz. Tamura's battalion had taken heavy losses in the day's fighting, with Tamura's 7th and 5th Companies being left with only 10 and 15 uninjured soldiers respectively.
Fearing that the U.S. troops were on the verge of breaking through their defenses, Hyakutake's 17th Army headquarters hurriedly sent whatever troops could be found on-hand to bolster the 4th Infantry's defensive efforts. The troops included the 2d Anti-Tank Gun Battalion with 12 guns and the 39th Field Road Construction Unit. These two units took position in pre-prepared fighting emplacements around the south and west of Point Cruz.

On the morning of 2 November, with the Whaling Group covering their flank, the men of 2/5 marched north and reached the coast west of Point Cruz, completing the encirclement of the Japanese defenders. The Japanese defenses were centered in a draw between a coastal trail and a beach just west of Point Cruz and included coral, earth, and log bunkers as well as caves and foxholes. U.S. artillery bombarded the Japanese positions throughout the day on 2 November, causing an unknown number of casualties to the Japanese defenders.

Later in the day, Company I of 2/5 conducted a frontal assault with fixed bayonets on the northern portion of the Japanese defenses, overrunning and killing the Japanese defenders. At the same time, two battalions from 2nd Marine Regiment, now committed to the offensive, advanced past the Point Cruz area.

At 06:30 on 3 November, some Japanese troops attempted to break out of the pocket but were beaten back by the Marines. Between 08:00 and noon, five Marine companies from 2/5 and 3/5, using small arms, mortars, demolition charges, and direct and indirect artillery fire, completed the destruction of the Japanese pocket near Point Cruz. Marine participant Richard A. Nash described the battle:

The Marines captured 12 37mm anti-tank guns, one 70 mm field artillery piece, and 34 machineguns and counted the dead bodies of 239 Japanese soldiers, including 28 officers.
At the same time, the 2nd Marines with the Whaling Group continued to push along the coast, reaching a point west of Point Cruz by nightfall. The only Japanese troops left in the area to oppose the Marines' advance were the remaining 500 soldiers of the 4th Infantry augmented by a few frail survivors from units involved in the earlier Tenaru and Edson's Ridge battles plus malnourished naval troops from the original Guadalcanal garrison. The Japanese feared that they would be unable to prevent the Americans from taking the village of Kokumbona, which would cut-off the retreat of the 2nd Infantry Division and seriously threaten the rear-area support and headquarters units of Japanese forces on Guadalcanal. In despair, Nakaguma discussed taking the regimental colors and seeking death in a final charge at the U.S. forces, but was dissuaded from doing so by other officers on the 17th Army's staff.

A significant event now occurred which granted the Japanese forces a reprieve. Early on 3 November, Marine units near Koli Point, east of the Lunga Perimeter, engaged 300 fresh Japanese troops that had just been landed by a Tokyo Express mission of five destroyers. This, plus the knowledge that a large body of Japanese troops was in the process of relocating to Koli Point after the defeat in the Henderson Field battle, led the Americans to believe that the Japanese were about to conduct a major attack on the Lunga Perimeter from the Koli Point area.

To discuss these developments, the Marine leaders on Guadalcanal met on the morning of 4 November. Twining recommended that the Matanikau offensive continue. Edson, Thomas, and Vandegrift, however, urged the abandonment of the offensive and a shift of forces to counter the Koli Point threat. Thus, that same day the 5th Marines and the Whaling group were recalled to Lunga Point. The 2nd Marine's <a href="1st%20Battalion%202nd%20Marines">1st</a> and <a href="2nd%20Battalion%202nd%20Marines">2nd</a> Battalions, plus the 1st Battalion, 164th Infantry took up positions about west of Point Cruz with plans to hold in that location. With their route of retreat still open, the Sendai (2nd) Division survivors began to reach Kokumbona this same day. Around this time, Nakaguma was killed by an artillery shell.

After <a href="Koli%20Point%20action">chasing away</a> the Japanese forces at Koli Point, the U.S. renewed the western offensive towards Kokumbona on 10 November with three battalions under the overall command of U.S. Marine Colonel John Arthur. In the meantime, fresh Japanese troops from the 228th Infantry Regiment of the 38th Infantry Division landed by Tokyo Express over several nights beginning on 5 November and effectively resisted the American attack. After making small advances, at 13:45 on 11 November Vandegrift suddenly ordered all the American forces to return to the east bank of the Matanikau.

Vandegrift ordered the withdrawal because of the receipt of intelligence from <a href="coastwatchers">coastwatchers</a>, aerial reconnaissance, and radio intercepts that a major Japanese reinforcement effort was imminent. Indeed, the Japanese were in the process of attempting to deliver the 10,000 remaining troops from the 38th Division to Guadalcanal in order to reattempt to capture Henderson Field. The resulting efforts by the Americans to stop this reinforcement attempt resulted in the <a href="Naval%20Battle%20of%20Guadalcanal">Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a>, the decisive naval battle of the Guadalcanal campaign, in which the Japanese reinforcement effort was turned back.

The Americans recrossed the Matanikau and attacked westward again beginning on 18 November, but made slow progress against determined resistance from Japanese forces. The U.S. attack was halted on 23 November at a line just west of Point Cruz. The Americans and Japanese would remain facing each other in these positions for the next six weeks, until the ending stages of the campaign when U.S. forces began their final, successful push to drive Japanese forces from the island. Although the Americans had come close to overrunning the Japanese rear areas in the early November offensive, it would not be until the final stages of the campaign that the U.S. finally captured Kokumbona.

Guy Bradley

Guy Morrell Bradley (April 25, 1870 – July 8, 1905) was an American <a href="game%20warden">game warden</a> and deputy sheriff for <a href="Monroe%20County%2C%20Florida">Monroe County, Florida</a>. Born in <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>, he relocated to Florida with his family when he was young. As a boy, he often served as guide to visiting fishermen and <a href="Plume%20hunting">plume hunter</a>s, although he later denounced poaching after legislation was passed to protect the dwindling number of birds. In 1902, Bradley was hired by the <a href="American%20Ornithologists%27%20Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a>, at the request of the Florida <a href="Audubon%20Society">Audubon Society</a>, to become one of the country's first game wardens.

Tasked with protecting the area's <a href="wading%20birds">wading birds</a> from hunters, he patrolled the area stretching from Florida's west coast, through the <a href="Everglades">Everglades</a>, to <a href="Key%20West">Key West</a>, single-handedly enforcing the ban on bird hunting. Bradley was shot and killed in the line of duty, after confronting a man and his two sons who were hunting <a href="egret">egret</a>s in the Everglades. His much-publicized death at the age of 35 galvanized <a href="conservation%20movement">conservationist</a>s, and served as inspiration for future legislation to protect Florida's bird populations. Several national awards and places have been named in his honor.

Guy Bradley was born in <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>, in 1870. His family had strong ties to the city; his father, Edwin Ruthven Bradley, was born there in 1840, and two members of the family held high positions in Chicago's law enforcement. Six years after Guy's birth, the family relocated to Florida. After making their home in smaller towns, the family eventually settled in <a href="Fort%20Lauderdale">Fort Lauderdale</a>, where Edwin became keeper of the <a href="Houses%20of%20Refuge%20in%20Florida">Fort Lauderdale House of Refuge</a>. Shortly after the death of Bradley's sister Flora from an unknown illness—which also affected Guy, leaving him ill for several years—the family moved to the vicinity of <a href="Lake%20Worth%2C%20Florida">Lake Worth</a>. Edwin became a postman, earning an annual wage of six hundred dollars. He, with the help of his oldest son, later received national attention for being one of several <a href="barefoot%20mailman">barefoot mailmen</a>, who operated until a road was constructed in 1892.

The family then relocated to Miami, where Edwin served as <a href="Superintendent%20%28education%29">superintendent</a> of the <a href="Miami-Dade%20County%2C%20Florida">Dade County</a> school district. In 1885, fifteen-year-old Guy and his older brother Louis served as scouts for noted French plume hunter Jean Chevalier on his trip to the Everglades. Accompanied by their friend <a href="Charlie%20W.%20Pierce">Charlie W. Pierce</a>, the men set sail on Pierce's craft, the "Bonton", ending their journey in Key West. At the time, plume feathers—selling for more than $20 an ounce ($ in 2011)—were reportedly more valuable than gold. On their expedition, which lasted several weeks, the young men and Chevalier's party killed 1,397 individual birds of thirty-six different species.

At the turn of the 20th century, vast numbers of birds were being killed in order to provide feathers to decorate women's hats. The fashion craze, which began in the 1870s, became so prominent that by 1886 birds were being killed for the <a href="Hat">millinery</a> trade at a rate of five million a year; many species faced extinction as a result. In Florida, plume birds were first driven away from the most populated areas in the northern part of the state, and forced to nest further south. <a href="Rookery">Rookeries</a> concentrated in and around the Everglades area, which had abundant food and seasonal dry periods, ideal for nesting birds. By the late 1880s, there were no longer any large numbers of plume birds within reach of Florida's most settled cities.

The most popular plumes came from various species of wading birds, known as "little snowies" for their snowy-white feathers; even more prized were the "nuptial plumes", grown during mating season and displayed by birds during courtship. Poachers often stole into the densely populated rookeries, where they would shoot and then pluck the roosting birds clean, leaving their carcasses to rot. Unprotected eggs became easy prey for predators, as were newly hatched birds, who also starved or died from exposure. One ex-poacher would later write of the practice, "The heads and necks of the young birds were hanging out of the nests by the hundreds. I am done with bird hunting forever!"

In the mid-1890s, Edwin became head of the <a href="Florida%20Coast%20Line%20Canal%20and%20Transportation%20Company">Florida Coast Line Canal and Transportation Company</a> and then the Model Land Company, both of which sold land for the railroads. In 1900, after twenty years living in Lake Worth, the family moved to <a href="Flamingo%2C%20Florida">Flamingo</a> in Monroe County, near the Everglades. Edwin had heard that railroad tycoon <a href="Henry%20Flagler">Henry Flagler</a> planned to build his railroad through the area, and that the then primitive city of Flamingo would flourish as a result; Flagler later changed his mind, deciding to build to Key West instead. Guy and his brother, who continued working as guides and hunters, each received a quarter of a mile of land on Florida Bay as part of their father's deal with the Model Land Company. While working variously as a postman, farmer and boatman during his 20s, Guy continued to augment his income with an occasional plume hunt. In 1899, he married the young widow Sophronia ("Fronie") Vickers Kirvin from Key West. Their first child, Morrell, was born a year later.

When the Florida legislature passed the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) model law to outlaw the killing of plume birds, this created a need for qualified and competent wardens to enforce it. <a href="Kirk%20Munroe">Kirk Munroe</a>, a friend of the Bradley family and a founding vice president of the Florida Audubon Society, recommended Guy for the position. Seen as different from the other "wild" young men in Flamingo, Bradley was described as "pleasant, quiet… fair, with blue eyes, always whistling and a pretty good violinist… [a] social asset to the isolated, frontier community, clean-cut, reliable, courageous, energetic and conscientious".

Bradley was at this time a reformed plume hunter, who had given up the profession after the passage of the <a href="Lacey%20Act%20of%201900">Lacey Act of 1900</a>. In a letter to William Dutcher, president of the Florida Audubon Society, Bradley wrote "I used to hunt plume birds, but since the game laws were passed, I have not killed a plume bird. For it is a cruel and hard calling not withstanding being unlawful. I make this statement upon honor." Soon after being accepted for the position, Bradley traveled to Key West to secure his appointment as both game warden and deputy sheriff, which gave him the authority to arrest those hunting illegally.

As one of the first game wardens, Bradley was responsible for reporting suspected poachers and the businesses with which they worked. He was paid a monthly stipend of $35 ($ in 2010) to single-handedly patrol the enormous area stretching from the <a href="Ten%20Thousand%20Islands">Ten Thousand Islands</a> on Florida's west coast, through the Everglades, to <a href="Key%20West">Key West</a>, which served as nesting areas for popular plume birds such as egrets, <a href="heron">heron</a>s, <a href="spoonbill">spoonbill</a>s and <a href="ibis">ibis</a>. Bradley took his job seriously; he educated locals about the newly implemented laws which made plume hunting a punishable offense, spoke to hunters directly, and posted warning signs throughout his territory. He also set up a network of spies who watched for suspicious behavior, and employed his brother Louis and others close to him to work as assistant wardens during the height of the plume season.

In 1903, President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> created the first wildlife refuge in the United States, <a href="Pelican%20Island%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">Pelican Island</a>. Its first warden, <a href="Paul%20Kroegel">Paul Kroegel</a>, joined forces with Bradley to enforce the illegality of bird-hunting in Florida. By 1904, the various Audubon organizations had 34 wardens employed in ten states. Conservationist publications were optimistic that Bradley and other wardens would be successful in their enforcement; in AOU's January 1904 issue of "<a href="The%20Auk">The Auk</a>", an editor wrote: "The natives are beginning to realize that the birds are to be protected and that the wardens are fearless men who are not to be trifled with. The Bradleys have the reputation of being the best rifle shots in that vicinity and they would not hesitate to shoot when necessary."

After accepting the position as game warden, however, Bradley became a vilified figure in southern Florida; working alone, with no reinforcements, he had been shot at more than once. In 1904, Bradley alerted visiting ornithologist and author <a href="Frank%20Chapman%20%28ornithologist%29">Frank Chapman</a> that one of the more isolated rookeries, called Cuthbert, had been "shot out" despite previously having been found to be in good condition. He reportedly said, "You could've walked right around the Rookery on those bird's bodies—between four and five hundred of them."

Bradley took the slaughter to mean that he was being watched by local hunters, who only could have discovered the rookery by tracking his movements. Chapman later wrote, "Under his guardianship the 'white birds' had increased in numbers, which, with aigrettes selling at $32 an ounce, made the venture worth the risk (for there was a risk; as the man who attempted to 'shoot out' a rookery while Bradley was on guard would probably have lost his own 'plume'); the warden watched and in his absence his charges were slaughtered."

On July 8, 1905, Bradley heard gunshots close to his waterfront home in Flamingo. He set sail in his small skiff, and encountered a father and his two sons by the name of Smith, who were shooting up a rookery. The families had known each other for years, but <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> veteran Walter Smith had a reputation for being troublesome, and Bradley had previously had altercations with him. He had arrested Smith on one occasion and Smith's oldest son, Tom, twice for poaching. Smith threatened to retaliate against Bradley if he tried again, reportedly telling the warden, "You ever arrest one of my boys again, I'll kill you."

According to Walter Smith's account, Bradley encountered the three men as they were loading dead plume birds onto their boat. An argument ensued, and as the warden attempted to arrest one of the young men, Smith opened fire with his hunting rifle, fatally wounding Bradley. His body was found the next day by his brother's search party, after drifting from the scene of the crime. He had bled to death.

Smith set sail to Key West and turned himself in to the authorities the next day. Despite evidence found by the prosecution—paid for by the Florida Audubon Society—that Bradley had not fired his weapon, Smith claimed self-defense. He maintained that the warden had fired first, but missed, hitting Smith's boat. Those who knew Bradley, however, insisted that he had been an excellent shot, and would not have missed his target had he, in fact, shot first. Smith later was found not guilty of murder, when the jury decided there was insufficient evidence to convict; he served only five months in jail, unable to pay $5,000 for bail. While he was incarcerated, Bradley's two brothers-in-law burned down Smith's Flamingo home.
Bradley's death and Smith's acquittal made national headlines; detailed stories ran in the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>", the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald">New York Herald</a>", the "<a href="Philadelphia%20North%20American">Philadelphia North American</a>", and "<a href="Forest%20and%20Stream">Forest and Stream</a>". The warden's wife and two young children were given a home in Key West, paid for by donations secured by the Florida Audubon Society. The Society, however, made no effort to replace Bradley, and his job as warden went unfilled. Bradley's obituary, written by <a href="William%20Dutcher">William Dutcher</a> and published in August 1905's edition of "Bird Lore", characterized him as "fearless and brave." Dutcher eulogized Bradley by saying, "A faithful and devoted warden, who was a young and sturdy man, cut off in a moment, for what? That a few more plume birds might be secured to adorn heartless women's bonnets. Heretofore the price has been the life of the birds, now is added human blood. Every great movement must have its martyrs, and Guy M. Bradley is the first martyr in bird protection."

With no one to replace Bradley, lawlessness continued in the Everglades and rookeries were devastated for several more years. Frank Chapman remarked that "There is no community sufficiently law-abiding to leave a bank vault unmolested if it were left unprotected. We have given up. We can't protect it, and the rookery will have to go." In November 1908, game warden and deputy sheriff of <a href="DeSoto%20County%2C%20Florida">DeSoto County</a>, Columbus G. McLeod, went missing near <a href="Charlotte%20Harbor%20%28estuary%29">Charlotte Harbor</a>. A month later, his boat was found weighted down and sunk; inside, police found the warden's bloodstained hat, long gashes cut into the crown with what appeared to be an axe. It was suspected that he was killed by poachers. His body was never found and the perpetrators were not caught, despite the offer of a $100.00 reward by Florida's Governor<a href="Albert%20W.%20Gilchrist">Albert W. Gilchrist</a>. Later that year, an employee of the South Carolina Audubon Society, Pressly Reeves, was shot and killed during an ambush by unknown assailants.

These three deaths within as many years helped end the commercial trade of feathers from Florida. In 1910, the New York legislature passed the Audubon Plumage Act, outlawing the plume trade; other states followed, and Congress soon banned the import of hats decorated with bird feathers. In time, the fashion craze for bird feathers faded. As the demand for plumage dwindled, thousands of birds returned to the Everglades rookeries; adventure writer <a href="Zane%20Grey">Zane Grey</a> wrote after visiting a creek near <a href="Cape%20Sable">Cape Sable</a>:

Bradley was buried on a shell ridge at Cape Sable, overlooking <a href="Florida%20Bay">Florida Bay</a>. A nearby monument was erected by the Florida Audubon Society, reading: "Guy M. Bradley, 1870–1905, Faithful Unto Death, As Game Warden of Monroe County He Gave his Life for the Cause to Which He Was Pledged". The grave and monument, however, were later washed away in 1960's <a href="Hurricane%20Donna">Hurricane Donna</a>. The original gravestone was recovered, and is now on display at the Flamingo Visitor Center. A nearby plaque was also dedicated to Bradley's memory, and reads: "Audubon warden was shot and killed off this shore by outlaw feather hunters, July 8, 1905. His martyrdom created nationwide indignation, strengthened bird protection laws and helped bring <a href="Everglades%20National%20Park">Everglades National Park</a> into being."

The story of Bradley's defense of the Everglades' birds, and the manner of his death, has been depicted in both literature and film. Author <a href="Marjory%20Stoneman%20Douglas">Marjory Stoneman Douglas</a>, who would later become famous for publicizing the need for conserving and restoring the Everglades, based the hero of her 1930 short story "Plumes" on Bradley. The 1958 film "<a href="Wind%20Across%20the%20Everglades">Wind Across the Everglades</a>", starring <a href="Christopher%20Plummer">Christopher Plummer</a> and <a href="Burl%20Ives">Burl Ives</a>, was loosely based upon Bradley's life and death. Author <a href="Harvey%20Eugene%20Oyer%20III">Harvey Eugene Oyer III</a> featured Guy Bradley and <a href="Charlie%20W.%20Pierce">Charlie W. Pierce</a> in "The Adventures of Charlie Pierce: The Last Egret". Middle Rover Press, 2010.

In 1988, the <a href="National%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Foundation">National Fish and Wildlife Foundation</a> established the Guy Bradley Award to recognize achievements in wildlife law enforcement. The award is presented annually to two recipients, one state and one federal officer. Another honor, the Guy Bradley Lifetime Conservation Award, was established in 1997 by the Audubon Society Everglades Ecosystem Restoration Campaign to those who promote conservation and offer workable conservation solutions. A trail in the Everglades, leading from the Flamingo Visitor Center to the Flamingo Campground, also was named in Bradley's honor.

It consists of fifteen paintings on nine panels; six are painted on both sides. It retains some of its original frames.

Six outer panels (or shutters) are hinged; when folded they show an exterior view of saints and the donors. The inner panels contain scenes from the <a href="Last%20Judgment">Last Judgement</a> arranged across two registers. The large central panel that spans both registers shows Christ seated on a rainbow in judgment, with his feet resting on a golden globe. Below him the <a href="Michael%20%28archangel%29">Archangel Michael</a> holds scales as he weighs souls. The panel on Christ's far right shows the gates of <a href="Heaven%20%28Christianity%29">Heaven</a>, that to his far left the entrance to <a href="Christian%20views%20on%20Hell">Hell</a>. The panels of the lower register form a continuous landscape, with figures depicted moving from the central panel to their final destinations after receiving judgement.

The altarpiece was commissioned in 1443 for the <a href="Hospices%20de%20Beaune">Hospices de Beaune</a> by <a href="Nicolas%20Rolin">Nicolas Rolin</a>, Chancellor of the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Burgundy">Duchy of Burgundy</a>, and his wife <a href="Guigone%20de%20Salins">Guigone de Salins</a>, who is buried in front of the altarpiece's original location in the hospice. It is one of van der Weyden's most ambitious works, equal to his Prado "<a href="The%20Descent%20from%20the%20Cross%20%28van%20der%20Weyden%29">Deposition</a>" and lost "<a href="The%20Justice%20of%20Trajan%20and%20Herkinbald">Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald</a>". It remains in the hospice today, although not in its original position. It is in poor condition and was moved in the 20th century to shield it from sunlight and better protect it from the almost 300,000 visitors it receives annually. It has suffered from extensive paint loss, the wearing and darkening of its colours, and an accumulation of dirt. In addition, a heavy layer of over-paint was applied during restoration. The two painted sides of the outer panels have been separated so both can be shown simultaneously; traditionally, the shutters would have been opened only on selected Sundays or church holidays.

<a href="Nicolas%20Rolin">Nicolas Rolin</a> was appointed Chancellor of Burgundy by <a href="Philip%20the%20Good">Philip the Good</a> in 1422, a position he held for the next 33 years. His tenure with the duke made him a wealthy man, and he donated a large portion of his fortune for the foundation of the "<a href="Hospices%20de%20Beaune">Hôtel-Dieu</a>" in <a href="Beaune">Beaune</a>. It is not known why he decided to build in Beaune rather than in his birthplace of <a href="Autun">Autun</a>. He may have chosen Beaune because it lacked a hospital and an outbreak of the <a href="Black%20death">plague</a> decimated the population between 1438 and 1440. Furthermore, when in 1435 the <a href="Congress%20of%20Arras">Treaty of Arras</a> failed to bring a cessation to the longstanding hostility and animosity between <a href="Duchy%20of%20Burgundy">Burgundy</a> and France, the town suffered brutal ravages and famine from "<a href="%C3%A9corcheurs">écorcheurs</a>" (marauding bands) who roamed the countryside during the late 1430s and early 1440s. The hospice was built after Rolin gained permission from <a href="Pope%20Eugene%20IV">Pope Eugene IV</a> in 1441, and it was eventually consecrated on 31 December 1452. In conjunction, Rolin established the religious order of "Les sœurs hospitalières de Beaune". Rolin dedicated the hospice to <a href="Anthony%20the%20Great">St Anthony Abbot</a>, who was commonly associated with sickness and healing during the Middle Ages.
In the hospice's founding charter, signed in August 1443, Rolin wrote that "disregarding all human concerns and in the interest of my salvation, desiring by a favourable trade to exchange for celestial goods temporal ones, that I might from divine goodness render those goods which are perishable for ones which are eternal ... in gratitude for the goods which the Lord, source of all wealth, has heaped upon me, from now on and for always, I found a hospital." In the late 1450s, only a few years before he died, he added a provision to the hospital charter stipulating that the <a href="Requiem">Mass for the Dead</a> be offered twice daily. Rolin's wife, Guigone de Salins, played a major role in the foundation, as probably did his nephew Jan Rolin. De Salins lived and served at the hospice until her own death in 1470.

Documents regarding the artwork's commissioning survive and, unusually for a <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Netherlandish</a> altarpiece, the artist, patron, place of installation and date of completion are all known. It was intended as the centrepiece for the chapel, and Rolin approached van der Weyden around 1443, when the hospital was founded. The altarpiece was ready by 1451, the year the chapel was consecrated. Painted in van der Weyden's <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> workshop – most likely with the aid of apprentices – the completed panels were then transported to the hospice. The altarpiece is first mentioned in a 1501 inventory, when it was positioned on the high altar.
The <a href="polyptych">polyptych</a> was commissioned to provide both comfort and warning to the dying. It was intended to remind them of their faith, and direct their last thoughts towards the divine. This is evident in its positioning in the chapel, within view of the patients' beds. Rolin specified that 30 beds be placed within sight of the altarpiece for those too ill to walk, where it was visible to them through a pierced screen. There were usually only two patients per bed, luxurious at a time when six to fifteen in a large bed was more common. Medical care was expensive and primitive in the 15th century; the spiritual care of patients was as important as the treatment of physical ailments.

Saints <a href="Saint%20Sebastian">Sebastian</a> and Anthony represent healing. Both were associated with <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a>, and intended to reassure the dying as intercessors with the divine. <a href="Michael%20%28archangel%29">St Michael</a> developed a cult following in 15th-century France, most likely because he was thought to have appeared to <a href="Joan%20of%20Arc">Joan of Arc</a>. He was seen as a guardian of the dead, a crucial role given the disasters wrought by plague in the region. There was a severe outbreak in 1441–42, just before Rolin founded the hospital. Pilgrimage to <a href="Mont%20Saint-Michel">Mont Saint-Michel</a>, <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> reached a peak around this time. According to <a href="Barbara%20G.%20Lane">Barbara Lane</a>, patients were unlikely to survive their stay, yet St Michael offered consolation as they could "gaze on his figure immediately above the altar of the chapel every time the altarpiece was opened. Like Saints Anthony and Sebastian on the exterior of the polyptych, the archangel offered ... hope that they would overcome their physical ills."

The altarpiece comprises fifteen separate paintings placed on nine panels. Six are painted on both sides. When the outer wings are folded in, or, the paintings on the two upper and four lower panels become visible. The upper panels contain paintings on either side and are separately hinged and able to close independently of the others. When all the shutters are opened, the viewer is exposed to the expansive "<a href="Doom%20paintings">Last Judgement</a>" interior panels. These document the possible spiritual fates of the viewers: that they might reach Heaven or Hell, salvation or damnation; stark alternatives appropriate for a hospice. The exterior panels serve as a funerary monument for the donors. Art historian Lynn Jacobs believes that the "dual function of the work accounts for the choice of the theme of the Last Judgement on its interior".

The work clearly distinguishes between figures of the divine, earthly and hellish realms. Perhaps following Jan van Eyck's c. 1432 "<a href="Ghent%20Altarpiece">Ghent Altarpiece</a>", the polyptych wings form an inverted T-shape. When the shutters are closed the panels resemble an upside-down cross, a form common in 15th-century carved "<a href="retable">retable</a>s": an elevated central panel allowed additional space for a narrative scene, to depict a heavenly vista, a single large figure, or a crucifixion with space for the cross to extend above the other panels, an innovation seen in van der Weyden's "<a href="The%20Descent%20from%20the%20Cross%20%28van%20der%20Weyden%29">Descent from the Cross</a>". This shape echoes typical configuration of Gothic churches, where the <a href="nave">nave</a>s often extended past the aisles into the <a href="apse">apse</a> or <a href="Choir%20%28architecture%29">choir</a>. The imagery of the outer panels is set in the earthly realm with the donors, and saints painted in <a href="grisaille">grisaille</a> to imitate sculpture.

According to Jacobs, the treatment of the panels as a whole with van der Weyden's "elimination of thresholds is quite remarkable and indeed astonishing in the history of the triptych." As with his "<a href="Braque%20Triptych">Braque Triptych</a>", the background landscape extends across each panel of the lower register. The celestial sphere, towards which the saved move, is dramatically presented with a "radiant gold background, spanning almost the entire width of the altarpiece".

Motifs and arrangements of figures extend along the lower panels from one to the next, to the extent that the separations between panels are ignored with the intersections cutting figures in two. This is particularly evident on the lower register where each panel division intersects figures, so that parts of figures are painted on two adjoining panels; whereas Christ and St Michael are enclosed within the single central panel, giving emphasis to the iconography.

The lower register presents Earth, with its exits to Heaven and Hell. The imposing figure of Christ above indicates the "reign of heaven is about to begin." The distinction between the earthly and heavenly realms creates a sense of order. Christ, raised high above the altarpiece, "exudes calm and control", and creates a sense of balance and movement throughout the other panels.

The manner with which van der Weyden presents the resurrection of the dead across the five lower panels is reminiscent of a Gothic <a href="Tympanum%20%28architecture%29">tympanum</a>, specifically that at <a href="Autun%20Cathedral%23The%20Last%20Judgement%20Tympanum">Autun Cathedral</a>. Rolin would have been familiar with the Autun Cathedral entrances, which may have motivated his decision to commission a Last Judgement for the hospice from van der Weyden.

Rolin was aware of the liturgy associated with the Mass for the Dead, and would have known Last Judgement scenes associated with the Mass from 15th-century <a href="illuminated%20manuscripts">illuminated manuscripts</a>, such as the full-page Last Judgement in the <a href="Hours%20of%20Catherine%20of%20Cleves">Hours of Catherine of Cleves</a> which shows Christ placed in a similar position, sitting above as the dead rise from the ground.

Jesus sits in judgement in the upper centre panel. He holds a <a href="Lilium%20candidum">lily</a> in his right hand and a sword in his left, and sits on a rainbow extending across two panels, while his feet rest on a sphere. His right hand is raised in the act of blessing, his left hand lowered. These positions indicate the act of judgement; he is deciding if souls are to be sent to Heaven or Hell, his gestures echoing the direction and positioning of the scales held by the Archangel Michael beneath him. His palms are open, revealing the wounds sustained when they were nailed to the cross, while his <a href="cope">cope</a> gapes in places making visible the injury caused by the <a href="Holy%20Lance">lance</a>, which pours deep-red blood. Christ's face is identical to the representation in van der Weyden's "Braque Triptych", completed just a few years later in 1452. Christ, placed so high in the pictorial space and spanning both registers, orchestrates the entirety of the inner panels. Whereas earlier Last Judgements might have seemed chaotic, here Christ brings a sense of order.

The two upper register wings on either side of Jesus show a pair of angels holding the <a href="instruments%20of%20the%20Passion">instruments of the Passion</a>. These include a lance, crown of thorns and a stick with a sponge soaked in vinegar. The angels are dressed in white liturgical <a href="vestments">vestments</a>.

The Archangel Michael, the embodiment and conduit of divine justice, is positioned directly below Christ, the only figure to reach both Heaven and Earth. He wears a dispassionate expression as he holds a set of scales to <a href="Weighing%20of%20souls">weigh souls</a>. Unusually for Christian art, the damned outweigh the blessed; Michael's scales have only one soul in each pan, yet the left pan tips below the right. Michael is given unusual prominence in a "Last Judgement" for the period, and his powerful presence emphasises the work's function in a hospice and its preoccupation with the liturgy of death. His feet are positioned as if he is stepping forward, almost about to move out of the canvas and he looks directly at the viewer, giving the illusion of judging not only the souls in the painting but also the viewers. Michael, like Sebastian and Anthony, was a plague saint and would have been visible to inmates through the openings of the pierced screen as they lay in their beds. Michael is painted with iconographic elements associated with paintings of the Last Judgement, and is by far the most beautifully and colourfully painted figure; he is dressed in a red cope with woven golden fabrics over a shining white alb, which dominates the lower panels, "hypnotically attracting the viewer's glance" according to Lane. He is surrounded by four <a href="cherubs">cherubs</a>, playing trumpets to call the dead to their final destination. Michael's role in the Last Judgement is emphasised through van der Weyden's use of colour: Michael's gleaming white alb contrasts with the cherub's red vestments, set against a blue sky directly below heaven's golden clouds.

Beneath Michael, souls scurry left and right. The saved walk in single file towards the gates of Heaven where they are greeted by a saint; the damned arrive at the mouth of Hell and fall "en masse" headlong into damnation. The souls balanced in the scales are naked. The blessed look towards Christ, the banished look downwards. Both groups are tilted in the direction of Christ's hands. Reinforcing this, inscriptions around the groupings read "" (Virtues) and "" (sins).

The <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>, <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a>, the twelve Apostles and an assortment of dignitaries are positioned at either side of Michael in a <a href="De%C3%ABsis">Deësis</a>. The apostles are seated in a semicircle; <a href="Saint%20Peter">Peter</a>, dressed in red, is on the far left, and <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul</a>, dressed in green, is on the far right. The seven <a href="Halo%20%28religious%20iconography%29">haloed</a> dignitaries, dressed in contemporary clothing, are unidentified but include a king, a pope, a bishop, a monk, and three women. Rather than general representative types, they are portraits of specific unidentified individuals, according to Shirley Blum.
The dead rise from their graves around Michael's feet; some emerge to walk towards Heaven, others towards Hell. They are tiny compared to Christ and the saints. <a href="Lorne%20Campbell%20%28art%20historian%29">Lorne Campbell</a> notes that these panels display a deeply pessimistic view of humanity, with the damned far outnumbering the saved, especially compared to <a href="Stefan%20Lochner">Stefan Lochner</a>'s Cologne panel, where the saved crowd the entrance to Heaven. The dead undergo a gradual transformation as they move from panel to panel. The souls rising at Michael's feet show little expression, becoming more animated as they move to either side; horror and desperation become especially visible on the faces of the damned as they move towards Hell. On the left, the saved all have, according to Jacobs, "the same beatific expressions", but their postures gradually change from facing Christ and Michael to looking towards Heaven's gate, notably with the couple below Mary – the man turns the woman's gaze away from Michael, towards Heaven. This contrasts with another couple on the opposite panel who face Hell; the woman is hunched over as the man raises his hand in vain to beseech God for mercy.
Heaven is represented by an entrance to the Heavenly City, which is in a contemporary Gothic style illuminated by long, thin rays of light. The saved approach clasping their hands in prayer, and are greeted at the entrance by an angel. Only a few souls pass through the heavenly gates at a time. The imagery of a church as an earthly representation of Heaven was popularised in the 13th century by theologians such as <a href="Guillaume%20Durand">Durandus</a>; the gate to Heaven in this work resembles the entrance to the Beaune hospice. The way to Heaven is shown clearly as a gilded church – the saved ascend a set of steps, turn right, and disappear from sight. It is fully enclosed in a single panel, whereas Hell extends onto the adjoining panel, perhaps hinting that sin contaminates all around it.

Van der Weyden depicts Hell as a gloomy, crowded place of both close and distant fires, and steep rock faces. The damned tumble helplessly into it, screaming and crying. The sinners descend into Hell with heads mostly bowed, dragging each other along as they go. Traditionally, a Last Judgement painting would depict the damned tormented by malevolent spirits; yet here the souls are left alone, the only evidence that they are tormented is in their expressions. The hellscape is painted so as to instil terror, but without devils. <a href="Erwin%20Panofsky">Erwin Panofsky</a> was the first to pick up on this absence, and proposed that van der Weyden had opted to convey torment in an inward manner, rather than through elaborate descriptions of devils and fiends. He wrote, "The fate of each human being ... inevitably follows from his own past, and the absence of any outside instigator of evil makes us realize that the chief torture of the Damned is not so much physical pain as a perpetual and intolerably sharpened consciousness of their state". According to Bernhard Ridderbos, van der Weyden accentuated the theme by "restricting the number of the dead and treating them almost as individuals. As the damned approach the abyss of hell they become more and more compressed."

The exterior consists of the two <a href="Donor%20portrait">donor wings</a>, a pair of saints, and two panels with Gabriel presenting himself to Mary. The donors are on the outer wings, kneeling in front of prayer books. Four imitation statues in <a href="grisaille">grisaille</a> make up the inner panels. The lower two depict Saint Sebastian and Saint Anthony. Sebastian was the saint of plagues and an intercessory against epidemics, Anthony the patron saint of skin diseases and <a href="ergotism">ergotism</a>, known in medieval times as St Anthony's Fire. The two saints had strong associations with the Burgundian court as well: Philip the Good was born on St Anthony's day, he had an <a href="Portrait%20of%20Antoine%2C%20%27Grand%20B%C3%A2tard%27%20of%20Burgundy">illegitimate son named Anthony</a>, and two of Rolin's sons were named Anthony. St Sebastian was the patron saint of Philip the Good's chivalric <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Golden%20Fleece">Order of the Golden Fleece</a>, of which Rolin was a member.

The two small upper register panels show a rather traditional <a href="Annunciation">Annunciation</a> scene, with the usual dove representing the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> near Mary. The two sets of panels, unlike those on the interior, are compositionally very different. The figures occupy distinctly separate niches and the colour schemes of the grisaille saints and donors contrast sharply.

Like many mid-15th century polyptychs, the exterior panels borrow heavily from the "Ghent Altarpiece", which was completed in 1432. The combination of naturalistic donor portraits with grisaille imitation statues of saints is borrowed from that work, as is the treatment of the Annunciation. Van der Weyden used iconography in the Beaune exterior panels not found in his other works, which suggests Rolin may have commissioned the altarpiece to follow van Eyck's example. Van der Weyden was not inclined merely to imitate though, and arranged the panels and figures in a concentrated and compact format. Jacobs writes that "the exterior presents the most consistent pictorial rendering of trompe l'oeil sculpture to date". Gabriel's scroll and Mary's lily appear to be made of stone; the figures cast shadows against the back of their niches, creating a sense of depth which adds to the illusion.
The exterior panels are drab, according to Blum, who writes that on Rolin's panel the most colourful figure is the red angel, which, with its gold helmet and keys, "emerges like an apparition". Rolin and de Salins can be identified by the coats-of-arms held by the angels; husband and wife kneel at cloth-covered "<a href="prie-dieu">prie-dieu</a>x" (portable altars) displaying their emblems. Although De Salins was reputedly pious and charitable, and even perhaps the impetus for the building of the hospice, she is placed on the exterior right, traditionally thought of as an inferior position corresponding to Hell, linking her to <a href="Eve">Eve</a>, <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a> and the <a href="Fall%20of%20man">Fall of man</a>.
Van Eyck had earlier portrayed Rolin in the c. 1435 "<a href="Madonna%20of%20Chancellor%20Rolin">Madonna of Chancellor Rolin</a>", and the patron is recognizable from that work; both portraits show similar lips, a large chin and somewhat pointed ears. In van Eyck's portrait, Rolin is presented as perhaps pompous and arrogant; here – ten years later – he appears more thoughtful and concerned with humility. Campbell notes wryly that van der Weyden may have been able to disguise the sitter's ugliness and age, and that the unusual shape of his mouth may have been downplayed. He writes that while "van Eyck impassively recorded, van der Weyden imposed a stylised and highly personal vision of the subject". Van Eyck's depiction was most likely the more accurate; van der Weyden embellished, mainly by lengthening the nose, enlarging the eyes and raising the eyebrows.

The panels contain quotations in Latin from several biblical texts. They appear either as lettering seemingly sewn into the edges of the figures' clothes (mostly hidden in the folds), or directly on the surface of the central inner panel. The latter occur in four instances; two pairs of text float on either side of Christ, two around Michael. Beneath the lily, in white paint are the words of Christ: "" ("Come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundations of the world"). The text beneath the sword reads: "" ("Depart from me ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels").

The inscriptions follow the 14th-century convention of showing figures, imagery and motifs associated with the saved to Christ's right, and those of the damned to his left. The words beneath the lily (the "benedicti") read upwards towards Heaven, their curves leaning in towards Christ. The text to the left (the "maledicti") flows in the opposite direction; from the highest point downwards. The inscriptions to Christ's right are decorated in light colours, to the extent that they are usually difficult to discern in reproductions. The lettering opposite faces downwards, and is applied with black paint.

A number of panels are in poor condition, owing variously to darkening of the colours, accumulated dirt, and poor decisions during early restorations. The altarpiece stayed in the chapel from the time of its installation until the <a href="Reign%20of%20Terror">Reign of Terror</a> during the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, when it was hidden in the attic for decades. When it was brought out, the nude souls – thought to be offensive – were painted over with clothing and flames; it was moved to a different room, hung from the ground, and portions were whitewashed. In 1836, the Commission of Antiquities retrieved it and began plans to have it restored. Four decades later it underwent major restoration – between 1875 and 1878 – when many of these additions were removed, but not without significant damage to the original paintwork, such as the loss of pigment to the wall-hangings in the donor panels, which were originally red and gold. In general, the central inside panels are better preserved than the interior and exterior wings. De Salins' panel is damaged; its colours have darkened with age; originally the <a href="Niche%20%28architecture%29">niche</a> was a light blue (today it is light green) and the shield held by the angel was painted in blue.

The panels were laterally divided so that both sides could be displayed simultaneously, and a number of the panels were <a href="Transfer%20of%20panel%20paintings">transferred to canvas</a>.

Since before 1000 the "Last Judgement" had been developing as a complex subject in art, and from the 11th century became a very common subject as a wall-painting in churches, typically placed over the main door in the west wall, where it would be seen by worshippers as they left the building. Elements of the image had gradually been added, with Saint Michael weighing the souls a late arrival, first seen in 12th-century Italy. Since it has no biblical basis it is often thought to draw from pre-Christian parallels, such as depictions of <a href="Anubis">Anubis</a> performing a similar role in <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20art">Ancient Egyptian art</a>. In medieval English a wall-painting of the Last Judgement was called a <a href="Doom%20paintings">doom</a>.

Van der Weyden may have drawn influence from Stefan Lochner's c. 1435 "Last Judgement", and a similar c. 1420 painting now in the "Hotel de Ville", <a href="Diest">Diest</a>, Belgium. Points of reference include Christ raised over a <a href="Deesis">Great Deësis</a> of saints, apostles and clergy above depictions of the entrance to Heaven and the gates of Hell. In both earlier works Christ perches on a rainbow; in the Deësis panel he also is above a globe. While these two earlier works are filled with dread and chaos, van der Weyden's panels display the same sorrowful, but self-controlled dignity of his best works. This is most evident in the manner in which the oversized and dispassionate Christ orchestrates the scene from Heaven.

The work's moralising tone is apparent from some of its more overtly dark iconography, its choice of saints, and how the scales tilt far lower beneath the weight of the damned than the saved. The damned to Christ's left are more numerous and less detailed than the saved to his right. In these ways it can be compared to <a href="Matthias%20Gr%C3%BCnewald">Matthias Grünewald</a>'s "<a href="Isenheim%20Altarpiece">Isenheim Altarpiece</a>", which served much the same purpose, having been commissioned for the Monastery of St. Anthony in <a href="Isenheim">Isenheim</a>, which cared for the dying.
The similarities between the altarpiece and the c. late 1460s "<a href="The%20Last%20Judgment%20%28Memling%29">Last Judgement</a>" by van der Weyden's apprentice <a href="Hans%20Memling">Hans Memling</a> has led art historians to suggest a common tie, <a href="Florence">Florentine</a> banker Angelo Tani, gave commissions to van der Weyden before his death in 1464. Because Memling's apprenticeship post-dated the completion and installation of the altarpiece, art historians speculate that Tani or Memling would have seen it "in situ", or that Memling came into possession of a workshop design. Two additional works with similar depictions of Christ – a <a href="Martin%20Schongauer">Martin Schongauer</a> at the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a> dated c. 1469 and another in Germany from about 1493 – suggest the existence of the input of members of his workshop. In Memling's work the Deësis and Christ's placement, above St Michael with his scales, are almost identical to the "Beaune Altarpiece". Despite the marked similarities, the crowded scenes in Memling's "Last Judgement" contrast sharply with "the hushed serenity of Rogier's composition," according to Lane, and in a mirror image of van der Weyden's altarpiece, Memling shows the saved outweighing the damned in St Michael's scales.

Koli Point action

The Koli Point action, during 3–12 November 1942, was an engagement between <a href="U.S.%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marine Corps</a> and <a href="U.S.%20Army">U.S. Army</a> forces and <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Imperial Japanese</a> <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Army</a> forces around <a href="Koli%20Point">Koli Point</a> on <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> during the <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a>. The U.S. forces were under the overall command of <a href="Major%20General%23United%20States">Major General</a> <a href="Alexander%20Vandegrift">Alexander Vandegrift</a>, while the Japanese forces were under the overall command of <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Harukichi%20Hyakutake">Harukichi Hyakutake</a>.

In the engagement, U.S. Marines from the <a href="7th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">7th Marine Regiment</a> and U.S. Army soldiers from the <a href="164th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">164th Infantry Regiment</a> under the tactical command of <a href="William%20H.%20Rupertus">William H. Rupertus</a> and <a href="Edmund%20Sebree">Edmund B. Sebree</a>, attacked a concentration of Japanese Army troops, most of whom belonged to the 230th Infantry Regiment, commanded by <a href="Toshinari%20Sh%C5%8Dji">Toshinari Shōji</a>. Shōji's troops had marched to the Koli Point area after the failed Japanese assaults on U.S. defenses during the <a href="Battle%20for%20Henderson%20Field">Battle for Henderson Field</a> in late October 1942.

In the engagement, the U.S. forces attempted to encircle and destroy Shōji's forces. Although Shōji's unit took heavy casualties, he and most of his men were able to evade the encirclement attempt and escape into the interior of Guadalcanal. As Shōji's troops endeavored to reach Japanese positions in another part of the island, they were <a href="Carlson%27s%20patrol">pursued and attacked</a> by a battalion-sized patrol of <a href="Marine%20Raiders">U.S. Marine Raiders</a>.

On 7 August 1942, Allied forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, <a href="Tulagi">Tulagi</a>, and <a href="Florida%20Islands">Florida Islands</a> in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as <a href="Military%20base">bases</a> for threatening the <a href="materiel">supply</a> routes between the U.S. and Australia, and to secure the islands as starting points for a <a href="Military%20campaign">campaign</a> with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> while also supporting the Allied <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>. The landings initiated the six-month-long <a href="Guadalcanal%20campaign">Guadalcanal campaign</a>.

Taking the Japanese by surprise, by nightfall on 8 August the 11,000 Allied troops—under the command of Major General Alexander Vandegrift and mainly consisting of <a href="U.S.%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marines</a>—had <a href="Battle%20of%20Tulagi%20and%20Gavutu-Tanambogo">secured Tulagi</a> and nearby small islands as well as an airfield under construction at <a href="Lunga%20Point">Lunga Point</a> on Guadalcanal. The airfield was later named Henderson Field by Allied forces. The Allied aircraft that subsequently operated out of the airfield became known as the "<a href="Cactus%20Air%20Force">Cactus Air Force</a>" (CAF) after the Allied codename for Guadalcanal. To protect the airfield, the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point.

In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a> assigned the Imperial Japanese Army's 17th Army—a <a href="corps">corps</a>-sized command based at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant-General Harukichi Hyakutake—with the task of retaking Guadalcanal from Allied forces. Beginning on 19 August, various units of the 17th Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal with the goal of driving Allied forces from the island.
Because of the threat by CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field, the Japanese were unable to use large, slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island. Instead, the Japanese used warships based at Rabaul and the <a href="Shortland%20Islands">Shortland Islands</a> to carry their forces to Guadalcanal. The Japanese warships, mainly light <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s or <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s from the <a href="IJN%208th%20Fleet">Eighth Fleet</a> under the command of <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Gunichi%20Mikawa">Gunichi Mikawa</a>, were usually able to make the round trip down "<a href="The%20Slot">The Slot</a>" to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack. Delivering the troops in this manner, however, prevented most of the soldiers' heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, from being carried to Guadalcanal with them. These high-speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the "<a href="Tokyo%20Express">Tokyo Express</a>" by Allied forces and "Rat Transportation" by the Japanese.

The first Japanese attempt to recapture Henderson Field failed when a 917-man force was defeated on 21 August in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Tenaru">Battle of the Tenaru</a>. The next attempt took place from 12–14 September, with the <a href="Kawaguchi%20Detachment">6,000 soldiers</a> under the command of Major General <a href="Kiyotake%20Kawaguchi">Kiyotake Kawaguchi</a> being defeated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Edson%27s%20Ridge">Battle of Edson's Ridge</a>. After their defeat at Edson's Ridge, Kawaguchi and the surviving Japanese troops regrouped west of the <a href="Matanikau%20River">Matanikau River</a> on Guadalcanal.

As the Japanese regrouped, the U.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga defenses. On 18 September, an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 men from the <a href="U.S.%207th%20Marine%20Regiment">U.S. 7th Marine Regiment</a> to Guadalcanal. These reinforcements allowed Vandegrift—beginning on 19 September—to establish an unbroken line of defense completely around the Lunga perimeter.

General Vandegrift and his staff were aware that Kawaguchi's troops had retreated to the area west of the Matanikau and that numerous groups of Japanese stragglers were scattered throughout the area between the Lunga Perimeter and the Matanikau River. Vandegrift, therefore, decided to conduct a <a href="Actions%20along%20the%20Matanikau">series of small unit operations</a> around the Matanikau Valley.
The first U.S. Marine operation against Japanese forces west of the Matanikau, conducted between 23 and 27 September 1942 by elements of three U.S. Marine <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s, was repulsed by Kawaguchi's troops under Colonel <a href="Akinosuke%20Oka">Akinosuke Oka</a>'s local command. In the second action, between 6 and 9 October, a larger force of U.S. Marines successfully crossed the Matanikau River, attacked newly landed Japanese forces from the <a href="2nd%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">2nd ("Sendai") Infantry Division</a> under the command of generals <a href="Masao%20Maruyama%20%28Lieutenant%20General%29">Masao Maruyama</a> and <a href="Yumio%20Nasu">Yumio Nasu</a> and inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese <a href="Aoba%20Detachment">4th Infantry Regiment</a>. The second action forced the Japanese to retreat from their positions east of the Matanikau.

In the meantime, Major General <a href="Millard%20Harmon">Millard F. Harmon</a>—commander of U.S. Army forces in the South Pacific—convinced Vice Admiral <a href="Robert%20L.%20Ghormley">Robert L. Ghormley</a>—commander of Allied forces in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20Areas%20%28command%29">South Pacific Area</a>—that U.S. Marine forces on Guadalcanal needed to be reinforced immediately if the Allies were to successfully defend the island from the next expected Japanese offensive. Thus on 13 October, a naval convoy delivered the 2,837-strong <a href="164th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">164th U.S. Infantry Regiment</a>, a <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a> <a href="Army%20National%20Guard">Army National Guard</a> formation from the U.S. Army's <a href="Americal%20Division">Americal Division</a>, to Guadalcanal.

Between 1 and 17 October, the Japanese delivered 15,000 troops to Guadalcanal, giving Hyakutake 20,000 total troops to employ for his planned offensive. Because of the loss of their positions on the east side of the Matanikau, the Japanese decided that an attack on the U.S. defenses along the coast would be prohibitively difficult. Thus, after observation of the American defenses around Lunga Point by his staff officers, Hyakutake decided that the main thrust of his planned attack would be from south of Henderson Field. His 2nd Division (augmented by troops from the <a href="38th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">38th Division</a>)—under Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama and comprising 7,000 soldiers in three infantry regiments of three battalions each—was ordered to march through the jungle and attack the American defenses from the south near the east bank of the <a href="Lunga%20River%20%28Guadalcanal%29">Lunga River</a>. The 2nd Division was split into three units; the Left Wing Unit under Major General Yumio Nasu containing the 29th Infantry Regiment, the Right Wing Unit under Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi consisting of troops from the 230th Infantry Regiment (from the 38th Infantry Division), and the division reserve led by Maruyama comprising the 16th Infantry Regiment.
On 23 October, Maruyama's forces struggled through the jungle to reach the American lines. Kawaguchi—on his own initiative—began to shift his right wing unit to the east, believing that the American defenses were weaker in that area. Maruyama—through one of his staff officers—ordered Kawaguchi to keep to the original attack plan. When he refused, Kawaguchi was relieved of command and replaced by Colonel <a href="Toshinari%20Sh%C5%8Dji">Toshinari Shōji</a>, commander of the 230th Infantry Regiment. That evening, after learning that the left and right wing forces were still struggling to reach the American lines, Hyakutake postponed the attack to 19:00 on 24 October. The Americans remained completely unaware of the approach of Maruyama's forces.

Finally, late on October 24 Maruyama's forces reached the U.S. Lunga perimeter. Over two consecutive nights Maruyama's forces conducted numerous, unsuccessful frontal assaults on positions defended by troops of the <a href="1st%20Battalion%207th%20Marines">1st Battalion, 7th Marines</a> (1/7) under Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Chesty%20Puller">Chesty Puller</a> and the U.S. Army's 3rd Battalion, <a href="164th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">164th Infantry Regiment</a>, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Hall. U.S. Marine and Army rifle, machine gun, mortar, artillery and direct canister fire from anti-tank guns "wrought terrible carnage" on the Japanese. More than 1,500 of Maruyama's troops were killed in the attacks while the Americans lost about 60 killed. Shōji's right wing units did not participate in the attacks, choosing instead to remain in place to cover Nasu's right flank against a possible attack in that area by U.S. forces that never materialized.
At 08:00 on 26 October, Hyakutake called off any further attacks and ordered his forces to retreat. Maruyama's left wing and division reserve survivors were ordered to retreat back to the Matanikau River area while the right wing unit under Shōji was told to head for Koli Point, east of the Lunga River.

To provide support for the right wing units (now called the Shōji Detachment) marching towards Koli, the Japanese dispatched a Tokyo Express run for the night of 2 November to land 300 fresh troops from a previously uncommitted company of the 230th Infantry Regiment, two <a href="Type%2041%2075%20mm%20Mountain%20Gun">mountain gun</a>s, provisions, and ammunition at Koli Point. American radio intelligence intercepted Japanese communications concerning this effort and the Marine command on Guadalcanal determined to try to intercept it. With many of the American units currently involved in an <a href="Matanikau%20Offensive">operation</a> west of the Matanikau, Vandgrift could spare only one battalion. The <a href="2nd%20Battalion%207th%20Marines">2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment</a> (2/7)—commanded by Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Herman%20H.%20Hanneken">Herman H. Hanneken</a>—marched east from Lunga Point at 06:50 on 2 November and reached Koli Point after dark the same day. After crossing the Metapona River at its mouth, Hanneken deployed his troops along in the woods facing the beach to await the arrival of the Japanese ships.

Early on the morning of 3 November, the five Japanese destroyers on the express run arrived at Koli Point and began to unload their cargoes and troops about east of Hanneken's battalion. Hanneken's force remained concealed and unsuccessfully attempted to contact their headquarters by radio to report the landing. At dawn, after a Japanese patrol discovered the Marines, combat with mortar, machine gun, and small arms fire began. Soon after, the Japanese unlimbered, and began to fire, the two mountain guns that they had landed during the night. Hanneken, still unable to contact his headquarters to request support, having suffered significant casualties, and running low on ammunition, decided to retreat. Hanneken's battalion withdrew by bounds, recrossing the Metapona, and then the Nalimbiu River further west, where Hanneken was finally able to establish contact with his superiors at 14:45 to report his situation.
In addition to Hanneken's report of sizable Japanese forces at Koli Point, Vandegrift's staff also possessed a captured Japanese document that outlined a plan to land the remainder of the 38th Infantry Division at Koli to attack the Marine Lunga defenses from the east. Unaware that the Japanese had abandoned the plan, Vandegrift decided that the threat from Koli Point needed to be dealt with immediately. Thus, he ordered most of the Marine units currently engaged west of the Matanikau to return to Lunga Point. Puller's battalion (1/7) was ordered to prepare to move to Koli Point by boat. The 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 164th Infantry Regiment (2/164 and 3/164) prepared to march inland to the Nalimbiu River. The <a href="3rd%20Battalion%2010th%20Marines">3rd Battalion, 10th Marines</a> began to move its <a href="M116%20howitzer">75 mm pack howitzer</a>s across the Ilu river to provide artillery support. Marine Brigadier General William Rupertus was placed in command of the operation.

At the same time that the U.S. forces were mobilizing, Shōji and his troops were beginning to reach Koli Point east of the Metapona River at Gavaga Creek. Late in the day, 31 CAF aircraft attacked Shōji's forces, inflicting about 100 deaths and injuries on the Japanese. Some of the CAF aircraft also mistakenly attacked Hanneken's men, causing several deaths and injuries to the Marines.
At 06:30 on 4 November, the 164th troops began their march towards Koli Point. Around the same time, Rupertus and Puller's battalion landed at Koli Point near the mouth of the Nalimbiu River. Rupertus decided to wait for the army troops to arrive before attacking Shōji's forces. Because of heat, humidity, and difficult terrain the 164th troops didn't complete the march to the Nalimbiu until nightfall. In the meantime, the <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> cruisers , , and destroyer bombarded Shōji's positions with artillery fire, killing many officers and soldiers from the 9th and 10th Companies, 230th Infantry.

On the morning of 5 November, Rupertus ordered the 164th troops to cross to the east bank of the Nalimbiu and envelop the inland flank of any Japanese forces that might be facing Puller's battalion. The two battalions crossed the river about inland and pivoted north to advance along the east bank. The army troops encountered few Japanese but were greatly slowed by difficult terrain and stopped short of the coast for the night. That same day, the Japanese troops that had been landed by the warships on 3 November, made contact with and joined Shōji's forces.

The next day, Puller's battalion crossed the Nalimbiu as the 164th troops resumed their march towards the coast. On 7 November, the Marines and army units joined forces at the coast and pushed east to a point about west of the Metapona, where they dug in near the beach because of sightings of a Japanese Express run heading for Guadalcanal that might land reinforcements at Koli that night. The Japanese, however, successfully landed the reinforcements elsewhere on Guadalcanal that night and these reinforcements were not a factor in the Koli Point action.
Meanwhile, Hyakutake ordered Shōji to abandon his positions at Koli and rejoin Japanese forces at Kokumbona in the Matanikau area. To cover the withdrawal, a sizable portion of Shōji's forces dug-in and prepared to defend positions along Gavaga Creek near the village of Tetere, about east of the Metapona. The two mountain guns landed on 3 November—in combination with mortars—kept up a constant rate of fire on the advancing Americans. On 8 November, Puller's and Hanneken's battalions and the 164th soldiers attempted to surround Shōji's forces by approaching Gavaga overland from the west and landing by boat near Tetere in the east. In action during the day, Puller was wounded several times and was evacuated. Rupertus, who was suffering from <a href="dengue%20fever">dengue fever</a>, relinquished command of the operation to U.S. Army Brigadier General <a href="Edmund%20Sebree">Edmund B. Sebree</a>.

On 9 November, the U.S. troops continued with their attempt to encircle Shōji's forces. On the west of Gavaga Creek, 1/7 and 2/164 extended their positions inland along the creek while 2/7 and other 164th troops took positions on the east side of Shōji's positions. The Americans began to compress the pocket while subjecting it to constant bombardment by artillery, mortars, and aircraft. A gap, however, existed by way of a swampy creek in the southern side of the American lines, which 2/164 was supposed to have closed. Taking advantage of this route, Shōji's men began to escape the pocket.

The Americans closed the gap in their lines on 11 November, but by then Shōji and between 2,000 and 3,000 of his men had escaped into the jungle to the south. On 12 November, Sebree's forces completely overran and killed all the remaining Japanese soldiers left in the pocket. The Americans counted the bodies of 450–475 Japanese dead in the area and captured most of Shōji's heavy weapons and provisions. The American forces suffered 40 killed and 120 wounded in the operation.

As Shōji's forces began their march to rejoin the main body of Japanese forces west of the Matanikau River, the U.S. <a href="Marine%20Raiders">2nd Marine Raider</a> Battalion—under the command of Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Evans%20Carlson">Evans Carlson</a>, which had been guarding an airfield construction effort underway at Aola Bay, further east from Koli Point—<a href="Carlson%27s%20patrol">set off in pursuit</a>. Over the next month, with the aid of native scouts, Carlson's raiders repeatedly attacked trailing elements and stragglers from Shōji's forces, killing almost 500 of them. In addition, a lack of food and tropical diseases felled more of Shōji's men. By the time the Japanese reached the Lunga River, about halfway to the Matanikau, only 1,300 men remained with Shōji's main body. Several days later, when Shōji reached the 17th Army positions west of the Matanikau, only 700–800 survivors were still with him. Survivors from Shōji's force later participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mount%20Austen%2C%20the%20Galloping%20Horse%2C%20and%20the%20Sea%20Horse">Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse</a> in December 1942 and January 1943.

Speaking of the Koli Point action, U.S. <a href="Sergeant">Sergeant</a> (later Brigadier General) John E. Stannard, who participated as a member of the 164th Regiment, stated that the battle for Koli Point was "the most complex land operation, other than the original landing, that the Americans had conducted on Guadalcanal up to that time." He added, "The Americans learned once again that offensive operations against the Japanese were much more complicated and difficult than was defeating banzai charges." The Americans later abandoned the attempt to construct an airfield at Aola. Instead, the Aola construction units moved to Koli Point where they successfully built an auxiliary airfield beginning on 3 December 1942.

The next major Japanese reinforcement effort failed during the <a href="Naval%20Battle%20of%20Guadalcanal">Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a>, undertaken as Shōji and his troops struggled to reach friendly lines near the Matanikau. Although most of Shōji's troops had escaped from Koli Point, the inability of the Japanese to keep their forces on Guadalcanal adequately supplied or reinforced prevented them from contributing effectively to what turned out to be Japan's ultimately unsuccessful effort to hold the island or retake Henderson Field from Allied forces.

Western Chalukya architecture

Western Chalukya architecture (), also known as Kalyani Chalukya or Later Chalukya architecture, is the distinctive style of ornamented architecture that evolved during the rule of the <a href="Western%20Chalukya%20Empire">Western Chalukya Empire</a> in the <a href="Tungabhadra">Tungabhadra</a> region of modern central <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>, India, during the 11th and 12th centuries. Western Chalukyan political influence was at its peak in the <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan Plateau</a> during this period. The centre of cultural and temple-building activity lay in the Tungabhadra region, where large medieval workshops built numerous monuments. These monuments, regional variants of pre-existing <a href="Dravidian%20architecture">dravida</a> (South Indian) temples, form a climax to the wider regional temple architecture tradition called <a href="Vesara">Vesara</a> or "Karnata dravida". Temples of all sizes built by the Chalukyan architects during this era remain today as examples of the architectural style.

Most notable of the many buildings dating from this period are the <a href="Mahadeva%20Temple%20%28Itagi%29">Mahadeva Temple</a> at Itagi in the <a href="Koppal%20district">Koppal district</a>, the <a href="Kasivisvesvara%20Temple">Kasivisvesvara Temple</a> at <a href="Lakkundi">Lakkundi</a> in the <a href="Gadag%20district">Gadag district</a>, the <a href="Mallikarjuna%20Temple%2C%20Kuruvatti">Mallikarjuna Temple</a> at Kuruvatti in the <a href="Bellary%20district">Bellary district</a> and the <a href="Kalleshvara%20Temple%2C%20Bagali">Kallesvara Temple</a> at Bagali in the <a href="Davangere%20district">Davangere district</a>. Other monuments notable for their craftsmanship include the <a href="Kaitabheshvara%20Temple%2C%20Kubatur">Kaitabheshvara Temple</a> in Kubatur and <a href="Kedareshvara%20Temple%2C%20Balligavi">Kedareshvara Temple</a> in Balligavi, both in the <a href="Shimoga%20district">Shimoga district</a>, the <a href="Siddhesvara%20Temple">Siddhesvara Temple</a> at <a href="Haveri">Haveri</a> in the <a href="Haveri%20district">Haveri district</a>, the Amrtesvara Temple at <a href="Annigeri">Annigeri</a> in the <a href="Dharwad%20district">Dharwad district</a>, the Sarasvati Temple in <a href="Gadag">Gadag</a>, and the <a href="Dodda%20Basappa%20Temple">Dodda Basappa Temple</a> at <a href="Dambal">Dambal</a>, both in the <a href="Gadag%20district">Gadag district</a>.

The surviving Western Chalukya monuments are temples built in the <a href="Shaiva">Shaiva</a>, <a href="Vaishnava">Vaishnava</a>, and <a href="Jain">Jain</a> religious traditions. None of the military, civil, or courtly architecture has survived; being built of mud, brick and wood, such structures may not have withstood repeated invasions.
The centre of these architectural developments was the region encompassing the present-day <a href="Dharwad%20district">Dharwad district</a>; it included areas of present-day <a href="Haveri%20district">Haveri</a> and <a href="Gadag%20district">Gadag</a> districts. In these districts, about fifty monuments have survived as evidence of the widespread temple building of the Western Chalukyan workshops. The influence of this style extended beyond the <a href="Basavakalyan">Kalyani</a> region in the northeast to the <a href="Bellary">Bellary</a> region in the east and to the <a href="Mysore">Mysore</a> region in the south. In the <a href="Bijapur%2C%20Karnataka">Bijapur</a>–<a href="Belgaum">Belgaum</a> region to the north, the style was mixed with that of the "Hemadpanti" temples. Although a few Western Chalukyan temples can be found in the <a href="Konkan">Konkan</a> region, the presence of the <a href="Western%20Ghats">Western Ghats</a> probably prevented the style from spreading westwards.

Though the basic plan of the <a href="Western%20Chalukya">Western Chalukya</a> style originated from the older "dravida style", many of its features were unique and peculiar to it. One of these distinguishing features of the Western Chalukyan architectural style was an <a href="articulation%20%28architecture%29">articulation</a> that can still be found throughout modern Karnataka. The only exceptions to this motif can be found in the area around <a href="Basavakalyan">Kalyani</a>, where the temples exhibit a "nagara" (North Indian) articulation which has its own unique character.

In contrast to the buildings of the early <a href="Badami%20Chalukyas">Badami Chalukyas</a>, whose monuments were clustered around the <a href="metropolis">metropoleis</a> of <a href="Pattadakal">Pattadakal</a>, <a href="Aihole">Aihole</a>, and <a href="Badami">Badami</a>, these Western Chalukya temples are widely dispersed, reflecting a system of local government and decentralisation. The Western Chalukya temples were smaller than those of the early Chalukyas, a fact discernible in the reduced height of the superstructures which tower over the shrines.

The Western Chalukya art evolved in two phases, the first lasting approximately a quarter of a century and the second from the beginning of 11th century until the end of Western Chalukya rule in 1186 <a href="Common%20Era">CE</a>. During the first phase, temples were built in the <a href="Aihole">Aihole</a>-<a href="Banashankari%2C%20Bangalore">Banashankari</a>-<a href="Mahakuta">Mahakuta</a> region (situated in the early <a href="Chalukya">Chalukya</a> heartland) and <a href="Ron%2C%20Karnataka">Ron</a> in the <a href="Gadag%20district">Gadag district</a>. A few provisional workshops built them in Sirval in the <a href="Gulbarga%20district">Gulbarga district</a> and <a href="Gokak">Gokak</a> in the <a href="Belgaum%20district">Belgaum district</a>. The structures at Ron bear similarities to the <a href="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a> temples in <a href="Kuknur">Kuknur</a> in the <a href="Koppal%20district">Koppal district</a> and <a href="Mudhol">Mudhol</a> in the <a href="Bijapur%20district%2C%20Chhattisgarh">Bijapur district</a>, evidence that the same workshops continued their activity under the new Karnata dynasty. The mature and latter phase reached its peak at <a href="Lakkundi">Lakkundi</a> (Lokigundi), a principal seat of the imperial court. From the mid-11th century, the artisans from the Lakkundi school moved south of the <a href="Tungabhadra%20River">Tungabhadra River</a>. Thus the influence of the Lakkundi school can be seen in some of the temples of the <a href="Davangere%20district">Davangere district</a>, and in the temples at Hirehadagalli and Huvinahadgalli in the <a href="Bellary%20district">Bellary district</a>.

Influences of Western Chalukya architecture can be discerned in the geographically distant schools of architecture of the <a href="Hoysala%20Empire">Hoysala Empire</a> in southern Karnataka, and the <a href="Kakatiya%20dynasty">Kakatiya dynasty</a> in present-day <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>. Sometimes called the "<a href="Gadag">Gadag</a> style" of architecture, Western Chalukya architecture is considered a precursor to the <a href="Hoysala%20architecture">Hoysala architecture</a> of southern Karnataka. This influence occurred because the early builders employed by the Hoysalas came from pronounced centres of medieval <a href="Chalukya">Chalukya</a> art. Further monuments in this style were built not only by the Western Chalukya kings but, also by their feudal vassals.

A typical Western Chalukya temple may be examined from three aspects – the basic floor plan, the <a href="Articulation%20%28architecture%29">architectural articulation</a>, and the figure sculptures.

The basic floor plan is defined by the size of the shrine, the size of the sanctum, the distribution of the building mass, and by the "<a href="pradakshina">pradakshina</a>" (path for circumambulation), if there is one.

Architectural articulation refers to the ornamental components that give shape to the outer wall of the shrine. These include projections, recesses, and representations that can produce a variety of patterns and outlines, either stepped, stellate (star-shaped), or square. If stepped (also called "stepped diamond of projecting corners"), these components form five or seven projections on each side of the shrine, where all but the central one are projecting corners (projections with two full faces created by two recesses, left and right, that are at right angles with each other). If square (also called "square with simple projections"), these components form three or five projections on a side, only two of which are projecting corners. Stellate patterns form star points which are normally 8-, 16-, or 32-pointed and are sub-divided into interrupted and uninterrupted stellate components. In an 'interrupted' stellate plan, the stellate outline is interrupted by <a href="orthogonality">orthogonal</a> (right-angle) projections in the <a href="cardinal%20direction">cardinal direction</a>s, resulting in star points that have been skipped. Two basic kinds of architectural articulation are found in Indian architecture: the southern Indian "dravida" and the northern Indian "nagara".

Figure sculptures are miniature representations that stand by themselves, including architectural components on pilasters, buildings, sculptures, and complete towers. They are generally categorised as "figure sculpture" or "other decorative features". On occasion, rich figure sculpture can obscure the articulation of a shrine, when representations of gods, goddesses, and mythical figures are in abundance.

Chalukyan temples fall into two categories – the first being temples with a common "mantapa" (a colonnaded hall) and two shrines (known as "dvikuta"), and the second being temples with one "mantapa" and a single shrine ("ekakuta"). Both kinds of temples have two or more entrances giving access to the main hall. This format differs from both the designs of the northern Indian temples, which have a small closed "mantapa" leading to the shrine and the southern Indian temples which generally have a large, open, columned "mantapa".

The Chalukyan architects retained features from both northern and southern styles. However, in the overall arrangement of the main temple and of the subsidiary shrines, they inclined towards the northern style and tended to build one main shrine with four minor shrines, making the structure a "panchayatna" or five-shrined complex. Chalukyan temples were, almost always, built facing the east.

The Sanctum (cella) is connected by a <a href="Vestibule%20%28architecture%29">vestibule</a> ("ardha mantapa" or ante-chamber) to the closed "mantapa" (also called the "navaranga"), which is connected to the open "mantapa". Occasionally there can be two or more open "mantapas". In Shaiva temples, directly opposite the sanctum and opposite the closed "mantapa" is the "nandi mantapa", which enshrines a large image of <a href="Nandi%20%28bull%29">Nandi</a>, the bull attendant of Shiva. The shrine usually has no "pradakshina".

The pillars that support the roof of the "mantapa" are monolithic shafts from the base up to the neck of the <a href="capital%20%28architecture%29">capital</a>. Therefore, the height of the "mantapa" and the overall size of the temple were limited by the length of the stone shafts that the architects were able to obtain from the quarries. The height of the temple was also constrained by the weight of the superstructure on the walls and, since Chalukyan architects did not use mortar, by the use of dry masonry and bonding stones without clamps or cementing material.

The absence of mortar allows some ventilation in the innermost parts of the temple through the porous masonry used in the walls and ceilings. The modest amount of light entering the temples comes into the open halls from all directions, while the very subdued illumination in the inner closed "mantapa" comes only through its open doorway. The vestibule receives even less light, making it necessary to have some form of artificial lighting (usually, oil lamps) even during the day. This artificial source of light perhaps adds "mystery" to the image of the deity worshipped in the sanctum.

From the 11th century, newly incorporated features were either based on the traditional "dravida" plan of the Badami Chalukyas, as found in the Virupaksha and Mallikarjuna Temples at <a href="Pattadakal">Pattadakal</a>, or were further elaborations of this articulation. The new features produced a closer juxtaposition of architectural components, visible as a more crowded decoration, as can be seen in the Mallikarjuna Temple at Sudi in the Gadag district and the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri in the Dharwad district.

The architects in the Karnataka region seem to have been inspired by architectural developments in northern India. This is evidenced by the fact that they incorporated decorative miniature towers (multi-<a href="aedicule">aedicular</a> towers depicting superstructures) of the "<a href="Sekhari%20%28architecture%29">Sekhari</a>" and "<a href="Bhumija%20%28architecture%29">Bhumija</a>" types, supported on pilasters, almost simultaneously with these developments in the temples in northern India. The miniature towers represented shrines, which in turn represented deities. Sculptural depictions of deities were generally discreet although not uncommon. Other northern ideas they incorporated were the pillar bodies that appeared as wall projections. Well-known constructions incorporating these features are found at the Kasivisvesvara Temple and the Nannesvara Temple, both at Lakkundi.

In the 11th century, temple projects began employing <a href="soapstone">soapstone</a>, a form of greenish or blueish black stone, although temples such as the Mallikarjuna Temple at <a href="Sudi">Sudi</a>, the Kallesvara Temple at <a href="Kuknur">Kuknur</a>, and the temples at Konnur and Savadi were built with the formerly traditional <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> in the "dravida" articulation.

Soapstone is found in abundance in the regions of <a href="Haveri">Haveri</a>, <a href="Savanur">Savanur</a>, <a href="Byadgi">Byadgi</a>, <a href="Motebennur">Motebennur</a> and <a href="Hangal">Hangal</a>. The great archaic sandstone building blocks used by the Badami Chalukyas were superseded with smaller blocks of soapstone and with smaller masonry. The first temple to be built from this material was the Amrtesvara Temple in Annigeri in the Dharwad district in 1050 CE. This building was to be the prototype for later, more articulated structures such as the <a href="Mahadeva%20Temple%20%28Itagi%29">Mahadeva Temple</a> at Itagi.

Soapstone was also used for carving, modelling and chiselling of components that could be described as "chubby". However, the finish of the architectural components compared to the earlier sandstone temples is much finer, resulting in opulent shapes and creamy decorations. <a href="Stepwell">Stepped wells</a> are another feature that some of the temples included.

The 11-century temple-building boom continued in the 12th century with the addition of new features. The Mahadeva Temple at Itagi and the Siddhesvara Temple in Haveri are standard constructions incorporating these developments. Based on the general plan of the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri, the Mahadeva Temple was built in 1112 CE and has the same architectural components as its predecessor. There are however differences in their articulation; the "sala" roof (roof under the <a href="finial">finial</a> of the superstructure) and the miniature towers on <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s are chiseled instead of moulded. The difference between the two temples, built fifty years apart, is the more rigid modelling and decoration found in many components of the Mahadeva Temple. The voluptuous carvings of the 11th century were replaced with a more severe chiselling.

As developments progressed, the Chalukyan builders modified the pure "dravida" tower by reducing the height of each stepped storey and multiplying their number. From base to top, the succeeding storeys get smaller in circumference and the topmost storey is capped with a crown holding the "kalasa", a finial in the shape of a decorative water pot. Each storey is so richly decorated that the original "dravida" character becomes almost invisible. In the "nagara" tower the architects modified the central panels and niches on each storey, forming a more-or-less continuous vertical band and simulating the vertical bands up the centre of each face of the typical northern style tower. Old and new architectural components were juxtaposed but introduced separately. Some superstructures are essentially a combination of southern "dravida" and northern "nagara" structures and is termed "<a href="Vesara">Vesara</a> <a href="Shikhara">Shikhara</a>" (also called <a href="Kadamba%20Dynasty">Kadamba</a> Shikhara).

The characteristically northern stepped-diamond plan of projecting corners was adopted in temples built with an entirely "dravida" articulation. Four 12th century structures constructed according to this plan are extant: the Basaveshwara Temple at <a href="Basavana%20Bagevadi">Basavana Bagevadi</a>, the Ramesvara Temple at Devur and the temples at Ingleshwar and Yevur, all in the vicinity of the Kalyani region, where "nagara" temples were common. This plan came into existence in northern India only in the 11th century, a sign that architectural ideas traveled fast.

A major development of this period was the appearance of stellate (star-shaped) <a href="shrine">shrine</a>s in a few temples built of the traditional sandstone, such as the Trimurti Temple at Savadi, the Paramesvara Temple at Konnur and the Gauramma Temple at Hire Singgangutti. In all three cases, the shrine is a 16-pointed uninterrupted star, a ground-plan not found anywhere else in <a href="India">India</a> and which entirely differentiates these temples from the 32-pointed interrupted star plans of "bhumija" shrines in northern India.

The stellate plan found popularity in the soapstone constructions such as the Doddabasappa Temple at Dambal as well. Contemporary stellate plans in northern India were all 32-pointed interrupted types. No temples of the 6-, 12-, or 24-pointed stellate plans are known to exist anywhere in India, with the exception of the unique temple at Dambal, which can be described either as a 24-pointed uninterrupted plan, or a 48-pointed plan with large square points of 90 degrees alternating with small short points of 75 degrees. The upper tiers of the seven-tiered superstructure look like cogged wheels with 48 dents. The Doddabasappa Temple and the Someshvara Temple at <a href="Lakshmeshwar">Lakshmeshwar</a>a are examples of extreme variants of a basic "dravida" articulation. These temples prove that the architects and craftsman were consciously creating new compositions of architectural components out of traditional methods.

In the early 13th century, 12th century characteristics remained prominent; however, many parts that were formerly plain became decorated. This change is observed in the Muktesvara Temple at <a href="Chaudayyadanapura">Chaudayyadanapura</a> (Chavudayyadanapura) and the Santesvara Temple at Tilavalli, both in the Haveri district. The Muktesvara Temple with its elegant "vimana" was renovated in the middle of the 13th century. In the Tilavalli Temple, all the architectural components are elongated, giving it an intended crowded look. Both temples are built with a "dravida" articulation. Apart from exotic "dravida" articulations, some temples of this period have "nagara" articulation, built in the stepped-diamond and the square plan natural to a "nagara" superstructure. Notable among temples with a stepped-diamond style are the Ganesha Temple at <a href="Hangal">Hangal</a>, the <a href="Banashankari%20Temple%2C%20Amargol">Banashankari temple</a> at Amargol (which has one "dravida" shrine and one "nagara" shrine), and a small shrine that is a part of the ensemble at the Mahadeva Temple. At Hangal, the architects were able to provide a "sekhari" superstructure to the shrine, while the lower half received a "nagara" articulation and depictions of miniature "sekhari" towers. The style of workmanship with a square plan is found at Muttagi and the <a href="Kamala%20Narayana%20Temple">Kamala Narayana Temple</a> at Degoan.

Temples built in and around the Kalyani region (in the <a href="Bidar%20district">Bidar district</a>) were quite different from those built in other regions. Without exception, the articulation was "nagara", and the temple plan as a rule was either stepped-diamond or stellate. The elevations corresponding to these two plans were similar because star shapes were produced by rotating the corner projections of a standard stepped plan in increments of 11.25 degrees, resulting in a 32-pointed interrupted plan in which three star points are skipped in the centre of each side of the shrine. Examples of stepped-diamond plans surviving in Karnataka are the Dattatreya Temple at Chattarki, the Someshvara Temple in Kadlewad, and the Mallikarjuna and Siddhesvara at Kalgi in the Gulbarga district. The "nagara" shrine at Chattarki is a stepped diamond of projecting corners with five projections per side. Because of the stepped-diamond plan, the wall pillars have two fully exposed sides, with a high base block decorated with a mirrored stalk motif and two large wall images above. The shapes and decorations on the rest of the wall pillar have a striking resemblance to the actual pillars supporting the ceiling.

The other type is the square plan with simple projections and recesses but with a possibility of both "sekhari" and "bhumija" superstructures. The plan does not have any additional elements save those that derive from the ground plan. The recesses are simple and have just one large wall image. The important characteristic of these "nagara" temples in the Kalyani region is that they not only differ from the "dravida" temples in the north Karnataka region but from the "nagara" temples north of the Kalyani region as well. These differences are manifest in the articulation and in the shapes and ornamentation of individual architectural components, giving them a unique place in Chalukyan architecture. Temples that fall in this category are the Mahadeva Temple at Jalsingi and the Suryanarayana Temple at Kalgi in the modern-day <a href="Gulbarga%20district">Gulbarga district</a>. The plan and the "nagara" articulation of these temples are the same as found to the north of the Kalyani region, but the details are different, producing a different look.

The Western Chalukya decorative inventiveness focused on the pillars, door panels, lintels ("torana"), domical roofs in bays, outer wall decorations such as "<a href="Kirtimukha">Kirtimukha</a>" (gargoyle faces common in Western Chalukya decoration), and miniature towers on pilasters. Although the art form of these artisans does not have any distinguishing features from a distance, a closer examination reveals their taste for decoration. An exuberance of carvings, bands of scroll work, figural bas-reliefs and panel sculptures are all closely packed. The doorways are highly ornamented but have an architectural framework consisting of pilasters, a moulded lintel and a <a href="cornice">cornice</a> top. The sanctum receives diffused light through pierced window screens flanking the doorway; these features were inherited and modified by the Hoysala builders. The outer wall decorations are well rendered. The Chalukyan artisans extended the surface of the wall by means of pilasters and half pilasters. Miniature decorative towers of multiple types are supported by these pilasters. These towers are of the "dravida" tiered type, and in the "nagara" style they were made in the "<a href="Latina%20%28architecture%29">latina</a>" (mono aedicule) and its variants; the "bhumija" and "sekhari".

The <a href="Jain%20Temple%2C%20Lakkundi">Jain Temple, Lakkundi</a> marked an important step in the development of Western Chalukya outer wall ornamentation, and in the Muktesvara Temple at Chavudayyadanapura the artisans introduced a double curved projecting <a href="eave">eave</a> ("chhajja"), used centuries later in <a href="Vijayanagara%20architecture">Vijayanagara</a> temples. The Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi embodies a more mature development of the Chalukyan architecture in which the tower has a fully expressed ascending line of niches. The artisans used northern style spires and expressed it in a modified "dravida" outline. Miniature towers of both "dravida" and "nagara" types are used as ornamentation on the walls. With further development, the divisions between storeys on the superstructure became less marked, until they almost lost their individuality. This development is exemplified in the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal, where the original "dravida" structure can only be identified after reading out the ornamental encrustation that covers the surface of each storey.

The walls of the "vimana" below the "dravida" superstructure are decorated with simple pilasters in low relief with boldly modeled sculptures between them. There are fully decorated surfaces with frequent recesses and projections with deeper niches and conventional sculptures. The decoration of the walls is subdued compared to that of the later Hoysala architecture. The walls, which are broken up into hundreds of projections and recesses, produce a remarkable effect of light and shade, an artistic vocabulary inherited by the Hoysala builders in the decades that followed.

An important feature of Western Chalukya roof art is the use of domical ceilings (not to be confused with the European types that are built of <a href="voussoir">voussoir</a>s with radiating joints) and square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the dome springs from the centre of the square are filled with <a href="Arabesque%20%28Islamic%20art%29">arabesque</a>s. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from <a href="Hindu%20mythology">Hindu mythology</a>.

Pillars are a major part of Western Chalukya architecture and were produced in two main types: pillars with alternate square blocks and a sculptured cylindrical section with a plain square-block base, and bell-shaped lathe-turned pillars. The former type is more vigorous and stronger than the bell-shaped type, which is made of soapstone and has a quality of its own. Inventive workmanship was used on soapstone shafts, roughly carved into the required shapes using a lathe. Instead of laboriously rotating a shaft to obtain the final finish, workers added the final touches to an upright shaft by using sharp tools. Some pillars were left unpolished, as evidenced by the presence of fine grooves made by the pointed end of the tool. In other cases, polishing resulted in pillars with fine reflective properties such as the pillars in the temples at Bankapura, Itagi and Hangal. This pillar art reached its zenith in the temples at Gadag, specifically the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag city.

Notable in Western Chalukya architecture are the decorative door panels that run along the length of the door and over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled <a href="fretwork">fretwork</a>, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run over the top of the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected outward from the roof of the open "mantapa". This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.

Figural sculpture on <a href="frieze">frieze</a>s and panels changed during the period. The heroes from the Hindu epics <a href="Ramayana">Ramayana</a> and <a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>, depicted often in early temples, become fewer, limited to only a few narrow friezes; there is a corresponding increase in the depiction of Hindu gods and goddesses in later temples. Depiction of deities above miniature towers in the recesses, with a decorative lintel above, is common in 12th-century temples, but not in later ones. Figures of holy men and dancing girls were normally sculpted for deep niches and recesses. The use of <a href="Bracket%20%28architecture%29">bracket</a> figures depicting dancing girls became common on pillars under beams and cornices. Among animal sculptures, the elephant appears more often than the horse: its broad volumes offered fields for ornamentation. Erotic sculptures are rarely seen in Chalukyan temples; the Tripurantakesvara Temple at <a href="Balligavi">Balligavi</a> is an exception. Here, erotic sculpture is limited to a narrow band of friezes that run around the exterior of the temple.

In what was a departure from convention, the Western Chalukyan figure sculptures of gods and goddesses bore stiff forms and were repeated over and over in the many temples. This was in contrast to the naturalistic and informal poses employed in the earlier temples in the region. Barring occasional exaggerations in pose, each principal deity had its own pose depending on the <a href="incarnation">incarnation</a> or form depicted. Consistent with figure sculpture in other parts of India, these figures were fluent rather than defined in their musculature, and the drapery was reduced to a few visible lines on the body of the image.

Western Chalukyan deity sculptures were well-rendered; exemplified best by that of Hindu goddess <a href="Sarasvati">Sarasvati</a> at the Sarasvati temple in Gadag city. Much of the drapery on the bust of the image is ornamentation comprising jewellery made of pearls around her throat. An elaborate pile of curls forms her hair, some of which trails to her shoulders. Above these curly tresses and behind the head is a tiered <a href="coronet">coronet</a> of jewels, the curved edge of which rises to form a halo. From the waist down, the image is dressed in what seems to be the most delicate of material; except for the pattern of embroidery traced over it, it is difficult to tell where the drapery begins and where it ends.

From the 11th century, architectural articulation included icons between pilasters, miniature towers supported by pilasters in the recesses of walls, and, on occasion, the use of wall pillars to support these towers. These miniature towers were of the southern "dravida" and northern "bhumija" and "sekhari" types and were mostly used to elaborate "dravida" types of articulation. The miniatures on single pilasters were decorated with a protective floral lintel on top, a form of decoration normally provided for depiction of gods. These elaborations are observed in the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri. These miniatures became common in the 12th century, and the influence of this northern articulation is seen in the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi and in the nearby Nannesvara Temple.

The miniature towers bear finer and more elegant details, indicating that architectural ideas traveled fast from the north to the south. Decoration and ornamentation had evolved from a moulded form to a chiseled form, the sharpness sometimes giving it a three-dimensional effect. The foliage decorations changed from bulky to thin, and a change in the miniature towers on dual pilasters is seen. The 11th century miniatures consisted of a cornice ("kapota"), a floor ("vyalamala"), a <a href="baluster">balustrade</a> ("vedika") and a roof ("kuta") with a voluptuous moulding, while in the 12th century, detailed "dravida" miniature towers with many tiny tiers ("tala") came into vogue. Some 12th-century temples such as the Kallesvara Temple at Hirehadagalli have miniature towers that do not stand on pilasters but instead are supported by balconies, which have niches underneath that normally contain an image of a deity.

The Western Chalukyan kings <a href="Shaiva">Shaiva</a>s (worshippers of the Hindu god Shiva) dedicated most of their temples to that God. They were however tolerant of the Vaishnava or Jain faiths and dedicated some temples to <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a> and the Jain <a href="tirthankaras">tirthankaras</a> respectively. There are some cases where temples originally dedicated to one deity were converted to suit another faith. In such cases, the original presiding deity can sometimes still be identified by salient clues. While these temples shared the same <a href="Western%20Chalukya%20architecture%23Basic%20layout">basic plan</a> and <a href="Western%20Chalukya%20architecture%23Architectural%20elements">architectural sensibilities</a>, they differed in some details, such as the visibility and pride of place they afforded the different deities.

As with all Indian temples, the deity in the sanctum was the most conspicuous indicator of the temple's dedication. The sanctum (<a href="Garbhagriha">Garbhagriha</a> or <a href="cella">cella</a>) of a Shaiva temple would contain a Shiva "<a href="linga">linga</a>", the universal symbol of the deity. An image of Gaja <a href="Lakshmi">Lakshmi</a> (consort of the Hindu god <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>) or an image of Vishnu riding on <a href="Garuda">Garuda</a>, or even just the Garuda, signifies a <a href="Vaishnava">Vaishnava</a> temple. Gaja Lakshmi, however, on account of her importance to the <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a>-speaking regions, is found on the lintel of the entrance to the <a href="mantapa">mantapa</a> (pillared hall) in all temples irrespective of faith.

The carving on the projecting <a href="lintel">lintel</a> on the doorway to the sanctum has the image of a "linga" or sometimes of <a href="Ganapati">Ganapati</a> (Ganesha), the son of Shiva in the case of Shaiva temples or of a seated or upright Jain saint (<a href="Tirthankar">Tirthankar</a>) in the case of Jain temples.

The <a href="sukanasi">sukanasi</a> or great arched niche at the base of the superstructure (<a href="Shikhara">Shikhara</a> or tower) also contains an image indicative of the dedicators' sect or faith. Above the lintel, in a deep and richly wrought <a href="architrave">architrave</a> can be found images of the Hindu <a href="trimurti">trimurti</a> (the Hindu triad of deities) <a href="Brahma">Brahma</a>, Shiva and Vishnu beneath arched rolls of <a href="Arabesque%20%28Islamic%20art%29">arabesque</a>. Shiva or Vishnu occupies the centre depending on the sect the temple was dedicated to.

Occasionally, Ganapati and his brother <a href="Kartikeya">Kartikeya</a> (Kumara, Subramanya) or the "<a href="Shakti">sakti</a>s", the female counterparts, can be found at either end of this carving. Carvings of the river Goddesses <a href="Ganga%20%28goddess%29">Ganga</a> and <a href="Yamuna">Yamuna</a> are found at either end of the foot of the doorway to the shrine in early temples.

The Western Chalukya dynastic rule ended in the late 12th century, but its architectural legacy was inherited by the temple builders in
southern Karnataka, a region then under the control of the Hoysala empire. Broadly speaking, <a href="Hoysala%20architecture">Hoysala architecture</a> is derived from a variant of Western Chalukya architecture
that emerged from the <a href="Lakshmeshwar">Lakshmeshwar</a> workshops. The construction of the <a href="Chennakesava%20Temple">Chennakesava Temple</a> at <a href="Belur%2C%20Karnataka">Belur</a> was the first major project commissioned by Hoysala King <a href="Vishnuvardhana">Vishnuvardhana</a> in 1117 CE. This temple best exemplifies the Chalukyan taste the Hoysala artisans inherited.
Avoiding overdecoration, these artists left uncarved spaces where required, although their elaborate doorjambs are exhibitionistic. Here, on the outer walls, the sculptures are not overdone, yet they are articulate and discreetly aesthetic. The Hoysala builders used soapstone almost universally as building material, a trend that started in the middle of the 11th century with Chalukyan temples. Other common artistic features between the two <a href="Kanarese">Kanarese</a> dynasties are the ornate "<a href="Salabhanjika">Salabhanjika</a>" (pillar bracket figures), the lathe-turned pillars and the <a href="Yalli%20%28motif%29">makara</a> <a href="torana">torana</a> (lintel with mythical beastly figure). The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.

When the <a href="Vijayanagara%20Empire">Vijayanagara Empire</a> was in power in the 15th and 16th centuries, its workshops preferred granite over soapstone as the building material for temples. However, an archaeological discovery within the royal center at <a href="Vijayanagara">Vijayanagara</a> has revealed the use of soapstone for stepped wells. These stepped wells are fashioned entirely of finely finished soapstone arranged symmetrically, with steps and landings descending to the water on four sides. This design shows strong affinities to the temple tanks of the Western Chalukya–Hoysala period.

Unlike the Badami Chalukyan temples featured in detailed studies by Henry Cousens (1927), Gary Tartakov (1969) and George Michell (1975), Western Chalukyan architecture suffered neglect despite its importance and wider use. Recently however, scholars have returned to the modern Karnataka region to focus on a longer chronology, investigating a larger geographical area, making detailed studies of <a href="Epigraphy">epigraph</a>s and giving more importance to individual monuments dating from the 11th through 13th centuries.

The first detailed study of Western Chalukya architecture was by M.A. Dhaky (1977), who used as a starting point two medieval epigraphs that claimed the architects were masters of various temple forms. This study focused in particular on the riches of the Western Chalukya miniature wall shrines (aedicules). An important insight gained from this work was that the architects of the region learned about temple forms from other regions. These forms to them appeared "exotic", but they learned to reproduce them with more or less mastery, depending on the extent of their familiarity with the other regions' building traditions. This conscious <a href="Eclecticism%20in%20art">eclectic</a> attempt to freely use elements from other regions in India was pointed out by Sinha (1993) as well.

A seminal work by Adam Hardy (1995) examined the Karnataka temple-building tradition over a period of 700 years, from the 7th century to the 13th century, and reviewed more than 200 temples built by four dynasties; Badami Chalukya, <a href="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a>, Western Chalukya and Hoysala. The study covered "dravida" and "nagara" style monuments and the differences between the "dravida" tradition in modern Karnataka and that of neighbouring Tamil Nadu and made it possible to interpret the many architectural details as part of a larger scheme.

The temples and epigraphs of the Western Chalukyas are protected by the <a href="Archaeological%20Survey%20of%20India">Archaeological Survey of India</a> and the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums–Government of Karnataka. In the words of historian S. Kamath (2001), "The Western Chalukyas left behind some of the finest monuments of artistic merit. Their creations have the pride of place in Indian art tradition".

The Mahadeva Temple at Itagi dedicated to Shiva is among the larger temples built by the Western Chalukyas and perhaps the most famous. Inscriptions hail it as the 'Emperor among temples'. Here, the main temple, the sanctum of which has a "linga", is surrounded by thirteen minor shrines, each with its own "linga". The temple has two other shrines, dedicated to Murthinarayana and Chandraleshwari, parents of Mahadeva, the Chalukya commander who consecrated the temple in 1112 CE.

The Siddheshwara temple in the Haveri district has sculptures of deities of multiple faiths. The temple may have been consecrated first as a Vaishnava temple, later taken over by Jains and eventually becoming a Shaiva temple. The hall in the temple contains sculptures of "Uma Mahesvara" (Shiva with his consort <a href="Parvati">Uma</a>), Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi, <a href="Surya">Surya</a> (the sun god), Naga-Nagini (the snake goddess), and the sons of Shiva, Ganapati and Kartikeya. Shiva is depicted with four arms, holding his attributes: the "damaru" (drum), the "aksamala" (chain of beads) and the "<a href="trishula">trishul</a>" (trident) in three arms. His lower left arm rests on Uma, who is seated on Shiva's lap, embracing him with her right arm while gazing into his face. The sculpture of Uma is well decorated with garlands, large earrings and curly hair.

Some temples, in a departure from the norm, were dedicated to deities other than Shiva or Vishnu. These include the Surya (portrayed as '<a href="Narayana">Suryanarayana</a>') shrine at the Kasi Vishveshwara temple complex and a Jain temple dedicated to <a href="Mahavira">Mahavira</a>, both at Lakkundi; the Taradevi temple (built in a Buddhist architectural style) at Dambal in the Gadag district; the Mahamaya temple dedicated to a <a href="Tantra">tantric</a> goddess at Kuknur in the Koppal district, and the <a href="Durga">Durga</a> temple at <a href="Hirekerur">Hirekerur</a> in the Haveri district.

She grew up in Florence and Rome under the wing of the <a href="Medici">Medici</a> popes, <a href="Pope%20Leo%20X">Leo X</a> and <a href="Pope%20Clement%20VII">Clement VII</a>. In 1533, at the age of fourteen, she left Italy and married <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20France">Henry</a>, the second son of <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I</a> and <a href="Claude%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Brittany">Queen Claude</a> of France. On doing so, she entered the greatest Renaissance court in northern Europe. 

King Francis set his daughter-in-law an example of kingship and artistic patronage that she never forgot. She witnessed his huge architectural schemes at <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Chambord">Chambord</a> and <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Fontainebleau">Fontainebleau</a>. She saw Italian and French craftsmen at work together, forging the style that became known as the first <a href="School%20of%20Fontainebleau">School of Fontainebleau</a>. Francis died in 1547, and Catherine became queen consort of France. But it wasn't until her husband King Henry's death in 1559, when she found herself at forty the effective ruler of France, that Catherine came into her own as a patron of architecture. Over the next three decades, she launched a series of costly building projects aimed at enhancing the grandeur of the monarchy. During the same period, however, religious civil war gripped the country and brought the prestige of the monarchy to a dangerously low ebb. 

Catherine loved to supervise each project personally. The architects of the day dedicated books to her, knowing that she would read them. Though she spent colossal sums on the building and embellishment of monuments and palaces, little remains of Catherine's investment today: one <a href="Doric%20order">Doric</a> column, a few fragments in the corner of the Tuileries gardens, an empty tomb at Saint Denis. The sculptures she commissioned for the Valois chapel are lost, or scattered, often damaged or incomplete, in museums and churches. Catherine de' Medici's reputation as a sponsor of buildings rests instead on the designs and treatises of her architects. These testify to the vitality of French architecture under her patronage. 

Historians often assume that Catherine's love for the arts stemmed from her <a href="Medici">Medici</a> heritage. "As the daughter of the Medici," suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, "she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died." Born in Florence in 1519, Catherine lived at the <a href="Palazzo%20Medici%20Riccardi">Medici palace</a>, built by <a href="Cosimo%20de%27%20Medici">Cosimo de' Medici</a> to designs by <a href="Michelozzo">Michelozzo di Bartolomeo</a>. After moving to Rome in 1530, she lived, surrounded by classical and Renaissance treasures, at another Medici palace (now called the <a href="Palazzo%20Madama">Palazzo Madama</a>). There she watched the leading artists and architects of the day at work in the city. When she later commissioned buildings herself, in France, Catherine often turned to Italian models. She based the <a href="Tuileries%20Palace">Tuileries</a> on the <a href="Palazzo%20Pitti">Pitti palace</a> in Florence; and she originally planned the Hotel de la Reine with the <a href="Uffizi">Uffizi palace</a> in mind. 
Catherine, however, left Italy in 1533 at the age of fourteen and married <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20France">Henry of Orléans</a>, the second son of King <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I of France</a>. Though she kept in touch with her native Florence, her taste matured at the <a href="wikt%3Aitinerant">itinerant</a> royal court of France. Her father-in-law impressed Catherine deeply as an example of what a monarch should be. She later copied Francis' policy of setting the grandeur of the dynasty in stone, whatever the cost. His lavish building projects inspired her own. 

Francis was a compulsive builder. He began extension works at the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>, added a wing to the old castle at <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Blois">Blois</a>, and built the vast château of <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Chambord">Chambord</a>, which he showed off to the emperor <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a> in 1539. He also transformed the lodge at <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Fontainebleau">Fontainebleau</a> into one of the great palaces of Europe, a project that continued under <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20France">Henry II</a>. Artists such as <a href="Rosso%20Fiorentino">Rosso Fiorentino</a> and <a href="Francesco%20Primaticcio">Francesco Primaticcio</a> worked on the interior, alongside French craftsmen. This meeting of Italian <a href="Mannerism">Mannerism</a> and French patronage bred an original style, later known as the first <a href="School%20of%20Fontainebleau">School of Fontainebleau</a>. Featuring <a href="fresco">fresco</a>es and high-relief <a href="stucco">stucco</a> in the shape of parchment or curled leather <a href="strapwork">strapwork</a>, it became the dominant decorative fashion in France in the second half of the sixteenth century. Catherine later herself employed Primaticcio to design her Valois chapel. She also patronised French talent, such as the architects <a href="Philibert%20de%20l%27Orme">Philibert de l'Orme</a> and <a href="Jean%20Bullant">Jean Bullant</a>, and the sculptor <a href="Germain%20Pilon">Germain Pilon</a>.

The death of Henry II from <a href="jousting">jousting</a> wounds in 1559 changed Catherine's life. From that day, she wore black and took as her emblem a broken lance. She turned her widowhood into a political force that validated her authority during the reigns of her three weak sons. She also became intent on immortalizing her sorrow at the death of her husband. She had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings. She commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry, as the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel. 

In 1562, a long poem by Nicolas Houël likened Catherine to <a href="Artemisia%20II%20of%20Caria">Artemisia</a>, who had built the <a href="Mausoleum%20of%20Maussollos">Mausoleum</a> at <a href="Halicarnassus">Halicarnassus</a>, one of the <a href="Seven%20Wonders%20of%20the%20Ancient%20World">Seven Wonders of the Ancient World</a>, as a tomb for her dead husband. Artemesia had also acted as regent for her children. Houël laid stress on Artemesia's devotion to architecture. In his dedication to "L'Histoire de la Royne Arthémise", he told Catherine: 

You will find here the edifices, columns, and pyramids that she had built both at Rhodes and Halicarnassus, which will serve as remembrances for those who reflect on our times and who will be astounded at your own buildings–the palaces at the Tuileries, Montceaux, and Saint-Maur, and the infinity of others that you have constructed, built, and embellished with sculptures and beautiful paintings.

In memory of Henry II, Catherine decided to add a new chapel to the <a href="Basilique%20Saint-Denis">basilica of Saint Denis</a>, where the kings of France were traditionally buried. As the centrepiece of this circular chapel, sometimes known as the Valois <a href="rotunda%20%28architecture%29">rotunda</a>, she commissioned a magnificent and innovative tomb for Henry and herself. The design of this tomb should be understood in the context of its planned setting. The plan was to integrate the tomb's effigies of the king and queen with other statues throughout the chapel, creating a vast spatial composition. Catherine's approval would have been essential for such a departure from funerary tradition.

To lead the Valois chapel project, Catherine chose <a href="Francesco%20Primaticcio">Francesco Primaticcio</a>, who had worked for Henry at Fontainebleau. Primaticcio designed the chapel as a round building, crowned by a dome, to be joined to the north <a href="transept">transept</a> of the basilica. The interior and exterior of the chapel were to be decorated with <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s, columns, and <a href="epitaphs">epitaphs</a> in coloured marble. The building would contain six other chapels circling the tomb of Henry and Catherine. Primaticcio's circular design solved the problems faced by the Giusti brothers and <a href="Philibert%20de%20l%27Orme">Philibert de l'Orme</a>, who had built previous royal tombs. Whereas de l'Orme had designed the tomb of Francis I to be viewed only from the front or the side, Primaticcio's design allowed the tomb to be viewed from all angles. Art historian Henri Zerner has called the plan "a grand ritualistic drama which would have filled the rotunda's celestial space". 

Work on the chapel began in 1563 and continued over the next two decades. Primaticcio died in 1570, and the architect <a href="Jean%20Bullant">Jean Bullant</a> took over the project two years later. After Bullant's death in 1578, <a href="Androuet%20du%20Cerceau">Baptiste du Cerceau</a> led the work. The building was abandoned in 1585. Over two hundred years later, in 1793, a mob tossed Catherine and Henry's bones into a pit with the rest of the French kings and queens.

Several of the monuments built for the Valois chapel have survived. These include the tomb of Catherine and Henry—in Zerner's view, "the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance". Primaticcio himself designed its structure, which eliminated the traditional <a href="bas-relief">bas-relief</a>s and kept ornamentation to a minimum. The sculptor <a href="Germain%20Pilon">Germain Pilon</a>, who had provided statues for the tomb of Francis I, carved the tomb's two sets of effigies, which represented death below and eternal life above. The king and queen, cast in bronze, kneel in prayer ("priants") on a marble canopy supported by twelve marble columns. Their poses echo those on the nearby tombs of <a href="Louis%20XII%20of%20France">Louis XII</a> and <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I</a>. Pilon's feel for the material, however, invests his statues with a greater sense of movement. 

Before they were destroyed in the Revolution, the remains of the king and queen lay in the mortuary chamber below. Catherine's effigy suggests sleep rather than death, while Henry is posed strikingly, with his head thrown back. From 1583, Pilon also sculpted two later <a href="gisant">gisant</a>s of Catherine and Henry wearing their crowns and coronation robes. In this case, he portrays Catherine realistically, with a double chin. These two statues were intended to flank the altar of the chapel. Pilon's four bronze statues of the <a href="cardinal%20virtues">cardinal virtues</a> stand at the corners of the tomb. Pilon also carved the reliefs round the base that recall <a href="Pierre%20Bontemps">Bontemps'</a> work on the monument for the heart of Francis I.

In the 1580s, Pilon began work on statues for the chapels that were to circle the tomb. Among these, the fragmentary "Resurrection", now in the Louvre, was designed to face the tomb of Catherine and Henry from a side chapel. This work owes a clear debt to <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, who had designed the tomb and funerary statues for Catherine's father at the <a href="Basilica%20of%20San%20Lorenzo%2C%20Florence">Medici chapels</a> in Florence. Pilon's statue of "St Francis in Ecstasy" now stands in the church of St Jean and St François. In art historian Anthony Blunt's view, it marks a departure from the tension of <a href="Mannerism">Mannerism</a> and "almost foreshadows" the <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a>. 

Pilon had by this time developed a freer style of sculpture than previously seen in France. Earlier French sculpture seems to have influenced him less than Primaticcio's decorations at Fontainebleau: the work of his predecessor <a href="Jean%20Goujon">Jean Goujon</a>, for example, is more linear and classical. Pilon openly depicts extreme emotion in his work, sometimes to the point of the grotesque. His style has been interpreted as a reflection of a society torn by the conflict of the <a href="French%20Wars%20of%20Religion">French wars of religion</a>.

Catherine's earliest building project was the château of <a href="Montceaux-en-Brie">Montceaux-en-Brie</a>, near Paris, which Henry II gave her in 1556, three years before his death. The building consisted of a central pavilion housing a straight staircase, and two wings with a <a href="pavilion%23Classical%20architecture">pavilion</a> at each end. Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the garden where Henry played <a href="pall%20mall%20%28game%29">pall mall</a>, an early form of <a href="croquet">croquet</a>. For this commission, Philibert de l'Orme built her a <a href="grotto">grotto</a>. He set it on a base made to look like natural rock, from which guests could watch the games while taking refreshments. The work was completed in 1558 but has not survived. The château ceased to be used as a royal residence after 1640, and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798.

After the death of Henry II, Catherine abandoned the palace of the <a href="H%C3%B4tel%20des%20Tournelles">Tournelles</a>, where Henry had lain after a lance fatally pierced his eye and brain in a <a href="jousting">joust</a>. To replace the Tournelles, she decided in 1563 to build herself a new Paris residence on the site of some old tile kilns or "tuileries". The site was close to the congested Louvre, where she kept her household. The grounds extended along the banks of the <a href="Seine">Seine</a> and afforded a view of the countryside to the south and west. The <a href="Tuileries%20Palace">Tuileries</a> was the first palace that Catherine had planned from the ground up. It was to grow into the largest royal building project of the last quarter of the sixteenth century in western Europe. Her massive building schemes would have transformed western Paris, as seen from the river, into a monumental complex. 
To design the new palace, Catherine brought back <a href="Philibert%20de%20l%27Orme">Philibert de l'Orme</a> from disgrace. This arrogant genius had been sacked as superintendent of royal buildings at the end of <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20France">Henry II's</a> reign, after making too many enemies. De l'Orme mentioned the project in his treatises on architecture, but his ideas are not fully known. It appears from the small amount of work carried out that his plans for the Tuileries departed from his known principles. De l'Orme is said to have "taught France the classical style—lucid, rational and regular". He notes, however, that in this case he added rich materials and ornaments to please the queen. The plans therefore include a decorative element that looks forward to <a href="Jean%20Bullant">Bullant's</a> later work and to a less classical style of architecture. 

For the <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s of Catherine's palace, de l'Orme chose the <a href="Ionic%20order">Ionic order</a>, which he considered a feminine form:

Catherine de' Medici was closely involved in planning and supervising the building. De l'Orme records, for example, that she told him to take down some Ionic columns that struck her as too plain. She also insisted on large panels between the <a href="dormer">dormer</a>s to make room for inscriptions. Only a part of de l'Orme's scheme was ever built: the lower section of a central pavilion, containing an oval staircase, and a wing on either side. Though work on de l'Orme's design was abandoned in 1572, two years after his death, it is nonetheless held in high regard. According to Thomson, "The surviving portions of the palace scattered between the Tuileries gardens, the courtyards of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts [Paris] and the Château de la Punta in <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a> show that the columns, pilasters, dormers and tabernacles of the Tuileries were the outstanding masterpieces of non-figurative French Renaissance architectural sculpture".
De l'Orme's original plans have not survived. <a href="Androuet%20du%20Cerceau">Jacques Androuet du Cerceau</a>, however, has left us a set of plans for the Tuileries. One engraving shows a grandiose palace, with three courts and two oval halls. This design is atypical of de l'Orme's style and so is likely to have been du Cerceau's own proposal or his son Baptiste's. It recalls the houses with tall pavilions and multiple courtyards that du Cerceau often drew in the 1560s and 1570s. Architectural historian David Thomson suggests that the oval halls within du Cerceau's courtyards were Catherine de' Medici's idea. She may have planned to use them for her famously lavish balls and entertainments. Du Cerceau's drawings reveal that, before he published them in 1576, Catherine decided to join the Louvre to the Tuileries by a gallery running west along the north bank of the Seine. Only the ground floor of the first section, the "Petite Galerie", was completed in her lifetime. It was left to <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20France">Henry IV</a>, who ruled from 1589 to 1610, to add the second floor and the "Grande Galerie" that finally linked the two palaces.

After de l'Orme died in 1570, Catherine abandoned his design for a freestanding house with courtyards. To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion that extended the building towards the river. This was built in a less experimental style by <a href="Jean%20Bullant">Jean Bullant</a>. Bullant attached columns to his pavilion, as advocated in his 1564 book on the <a href="classical%20order">classical order</a>s, to mark proportion. Some commentators have interpreted his different approach as a criticism of de l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.
Despite its unfinished state, Catherine often visited the palace. She held banquets and festivities there and loved to walk in the gardens. According to the French military leader <a href="Gaspard%20de%20Saulx">Marshal Tavannes</a>, it was in the Tuileries gardens that she planned the <a href="St.%20Bartholomew%27s%20Day%20massacre">St. Bartholomew's Day massacre</a>, in which thousands of Huguenots were butchered in Paris. The gardens had been laid out before work on the palace halted. They included canals, fountains, and a grotto decorated with glazed animals by the potter <a href="Bernard%20Palissy">Bernard Palissy</a>. In 1573, Catherine hosted the famous entertainment at the Tuileries that is depicted on the <a href="Valois%20Tapestries">Valois tapestries</a>. This was a grand ball for the Polish envoys who had come to offer the <a href="Polish-Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">crown of Poland</a> to her son, the duke of Anjou, later <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20France">Henry III of France</a>. <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20France">Henry IV</a> later added to the Tuileries; but <a href="Louis%20XVI%20of%20France">Louis XVI</a> was to dismantle sections of the palace. The <a href="communards">communards</a> set fire to the remainder in 1871. Twelve years later, the ruins were demolished and then sold off.

The palace of <a href="Saint-Maur-des-Foss%C3%A9s">Saint-Maur-des-Fossés</a>, south east of Paris, was another of Catherine's unfinished projects. She bought this building, on which Philibert de l'Orme had worked, from the heirs of <a href="Jean%20du%20Bellay">Cardinal Jean du Bellay</a>, after the latter's death in 1560. She then commissioned de l'Orme to finish the work he had begun there. Drawings by <a href="Androuet%20du%20Cerceau">Jacques Androuet du Cerceau</a> in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> may shed light on Catherine's intentions for Saint-Maur. They show a plan to enlarge each wing by doubling the size of the <a href="Pavilion%23Classical%20architecture">pavilion</a>s next to the main block of the house. The house was to stay as one storey, with a flat roof and <a href="Rustication%20%28architecture%29">rusticated</a> <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s. That meant the extensions would not unbalance the masses of the building as seen from the side.

De l'Orme died in 1570; in 1575 an unknown architect took over at Saint-Maur. The new man proposed to heighten the pavilions on the garden side and top them with pitched roofs. He also planned two more arches over de l'Orme's terrace, which joined the pavilions on the garden side. In historian R. J. Knecht's view, the scheme would have given this part of the house, a "colossal, even grotesque" <a href="pediment">pediment</a>. The work was only partly carried out, and the house was never fit for Catherine to live in. The Château de Saint-Maur, still in the possession of the Condé family, was nationalised during the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, emptied of its contents, and its terrains divided up among real-estate speculators. The structure was demolished for the value of its materials; virtually nothing remains.

After de l'Orme's death, Jean Bullant replaced him as Catherine's chief architect. In 1572, Catherine commissioned Bullant to build a new home for her within the Paris city walls. She had outgrown her apartments at the Louvre and needed more room for her swelling household. To make space for the new scheme and its gardens, she had an entire area of Paris demolished. 

The new palace was known in Catherine's time as the Hôtel de la Reine and later as the Hôtel de Soissons. Engravings made by <a href="Israel%20Silvestre">Israël Silvestre</a> in about 1650 and a plan from about 1700 show that the Hôtel de la Reine possessed a central wing, a courtyard, and gardens. The walled gardens of the hôtel included an <a href="aviary">aviary</a>, a lake with a water jet, and long avenues of trees. Catherine also installed an <a href="orangery">orangery</a> that could be dismantled in winter. The actual construction work was carried out after Bullant's death in 1582. The building was demolished in the 1760s.
All that remains of the Hôtel de la Reine today is a single <a href="Doric%20order">Doric</a> column, known as the Colonne de l'Horoscope or <a href="Medici%20column">Medici column</a>, which stood in the courtyard. It can be seen next to the domed <a href="Bourse%20de%20commerce%20%28Paris%29">Bourse de commerce</a>. Catherine's biographer Leonie Frieda has called it "a poignant reminder of the fleeting nature of power".

In 1576, Catherine decided to enlarge her château of <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Chenonceau">Chenonceau</a>, near Blois. On Henry II's death, she had demanded this property from Henry's mistress <a href="Diane%20de%20Poitiers">Diane de Poitiers</a>. She had not forgotten that Henry had given this crown property to Diane instead of to her. In return, she gave Diane the less prized <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Chaumont">Chaumont</a>. When Diane arrived at Chaumont, she found signs of the occult, such as <a href="pentagram">pentangles</a> drawn on the floor. She quickly withdrew to her château of <a href="ch%C3%A2teau%20d%27Anet">Anet</a> and never set foot in Chaumont again. 

Diane had carried out major works at Chenonceau, such as de l'Orme's bridge over the <a href="Cher%20River">Cher River</a>. Now Catherine set out to efface or outdo her former rival's work. She lavished vast sums on the house and built two galleries on the extension over the bridge. The architect was almost certainly Bullant. The decorations show the fantasy of his late style. 
Catherine loved gardens and often conducted business in them. At Chenonceau, she added waterfalls, <a href="menagerie">menagerie</a>s, and <a href="aviary">aviaries</a>, laid out three parks, and planted <a href="mulberry">mulberry</a> trees for <a href="Bombyx%20mori">silkworms</a>. <a href="Androuet%20du%20Cerceau">Jacques Androuet du Cerceau</a> made drawings of a grandiose scheme for Chenonceau. A <a href="trapezoid">trapezoid</a>al lower court leads to a forecourt of semicircular <a href="atrium%20%28architecture%29">atria</a> joined to two halls that flank the original house. These drawings may not be a reliable record of Bullant's plans. Du Cerceau "sometimes inserted in his book designs embodying ideas which he himself would have liked to see carried out rather than those of the actual designer of the building in question".

Jacques Androuet du Cerceau was a favourite architect of Catherine's. Like Bullant, he became a more fantastical designer with time. Nothing he built himself, however, has survived. He is known instead for his engravings of the leading architectural schemes of the day, including Saint-Maur, the Tuileries, and Chenonceau. In 1576 and 1579, he produced the two-volume "Les Plus Excellents Bastiments de France", a beautiful publication dedicated to Catherine. His work is an invaluable record of buildings that were never finished or were later substantially altered.

Catherine spent ruinous sums of money on buildings at a time of plague, famine, and economic hardship in France. As the country slipped deeper into anarchy, her plans grew ever more ambitious. Yet the Valois monarchy was crippled by debt and its <a href="moral%20authority">moral authority</a> was in steep decline. The popular view condemned Catherine's building schemes as obscenely extravagant. This was especially true in Paris, where the "<a href="parlement">parlement</a>" was often asked to contribute to her costs. 

<a href="Pierre%20de%20Ronsard">Ronsard</a> captured the mood in a poem:

<poem>
The queen must cease building,
Her lime must stop swallowing our wealth...
Painters, masons, engravers, stone-carvers
Drain the treasury with their deceits.
Of what use is her Tuileries to us?
Of none, Moreau; it is but vanity.
It will be deserted within a hundred years.
</poem>

Ronsard was in many ways proved correct. The death of Catherine's beloved son <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20France">Henry III</a> in 1589, a few months after her own, brought the Valois dynasty to an end. Precious little of Catherine's grand building work has survived.

Air Rhodesia Flight 825

Air Rhodesia Flight 825 was a scheduled passenger flight that was shot down by the <a href="Zimbabwe%20People%27s%20Revolutionary%20Army">Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army</a> (ZIPRA) on 3 September 1978, during the <a href="Rhodesian%20Bush%20War">Rhodesian Bush War</a>. The aircraft involved, a <a href="Vickers%20Viscount">Vickers Viscount</a> named the "Hunyani", was flying the last leg of <a href="Air%20Rhodesia">Air Rhodesia</a>'s regular scheduled service from <a href="Victoria%20Falls%2C%20Zimbabwe">Victoria Falls</a> to the capital <a href="Harare">Salisbury</a>, via the resort town of <a href="Kariba%2C%20Zimbabwe">Kariba</a>.

Soon after Flight 825 took off, a group of ZIPRA guerrillas scored a hit on its <a href="Port%20and%20starboard">starboard</a> wing with a Soviet-made <a href="9K32%20Strela-2">Strela-2</a> surface-to-air <a href="infrared%20homing">infrared homing</a> missile, critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an <a href="emergency%20landing">emergency landing</a>. An attempted <a href="belly%20landing">belly landing</a> in a cotton field just west of <a href="Karoi">Karoi</a> was foiled by a ditch, which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up. Of the 52 passengers and four crew, 38 died in the crash; the insurgents then approached the wreckage, rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire. Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush, while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived.

ZIPRA leader <a href="Joshua%20Nkomo">Joshua Nkomo</a> publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the "Hunyani" in an interview with the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s "<a href="Today%20%28BBC%20Radio%204%29">Today</a>" programme the next day, saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes, but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground. The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism. A fierce white Rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies, with many whites becoming violently resentful and suspicious of blacks in general, even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind. Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation.

Talks between Nkomo and Prime Minister <a href="Ian%20Smith">Ian Smith</a>, which had been progressing promisingly, were immediately suspended by the Rhodesians, with Smith calling Nkomo a "monster". On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a> over selected areas. The <a href="Rhodesian%20Security%20Forces">Rhodesian Security Forces</a> launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the <a href="Zimbabwe%20African%20National%20Liberation%20Army">Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army</a> (ZANLA). The attack on ZIPRA in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were <a href="refugee">refugee</a>s camping in and around guerrilla positions. In February 1979, ZIPRA shot down <a href="Air%20Rhodesia%20Flight%20827">Air Rhodesia Flight 827</a>, another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident.

A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the <a href="self-governing%20colony">self-governing colony</a> of <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a> (or <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>) led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister <a href="Ian%20Smith">Ian Smith</a>, to <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">unilaterally declare independence</a> from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965. The idea of "<a href="no%20independence%20before%20majority%20rule">no independence before majority rule</a>" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid <a href="decolonisation%20of%20Africa">decolonisation</a>, and Rhodesia's government was dominated by the country's <a href="white%20people%20in%20Zimbabwe">white minority</a>, so the unilateral declaration went <a href="list%20of%20states%20with%20limited%20recognition">unrecognised</a> internationally. Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia.

Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned <a href="Zimbabwe%20African%20National%20Union">Zimbabwe African National Union</a> (ZANU), mostly comprising <a href="Shona%20people">Shona</a>s, created the <a href="Zimbabwe%20African%20National%20Liberation%20Army">Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army</a> (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of <a href="Maoism">Maoist</a> doctrine, while the <a href="Northern%20Ndebele%20people">Ndebele</a>-dominated <a href="Zimbabwe%20African%20People%27s%20Union">Zimbabwe African People's Union</a> (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style <a href="Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism">Marxism–Leninism</a> and the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a>, mobilised the <a href="Zimbabwe%20People%27s%20Revolutionary%20Army">Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army</a> (ZIPRA). These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the "Second "<a href="Chimurenga">Chimurenga</a>"" against the Rhodesian government and <a href="Rhodesian%20Security%20Forces">security forces</a>. The resulting conflict, the <a href="Rhodesian%20Bush%20War">Rhodesian Bush War</a>, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia.

After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour. The leftist <a href="Carnation%20Revolution">Carnation Revolution</a> of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Mozambique">communist state</a> openly allied with ZANU. Around the same time, Rhodesia's other main backer, South Africa, adopted a <a href="d%C3%A9tente">détente</a> initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup. Following the abortive <a href="Victoria%20Falls%20Conference%20%281975%29">Victoria Falls Conference</a> of August 1975, Smith and the ZAPU leader <a href="Joshua%20Nkomo">Joshua Nkomo</a> held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976. ZANU and ZAPU announced in October 1976, during the run-up to the unsuccessful <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281976%29">Geneva Conference</a> in December, that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint "Patriotic Front".
In March 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop <a href="Abel%20Muzorewa">Abel Muzorewa</a>, the Reverend <a href="Ndabaningi%20Sithole">Ndabaningi Sithole</a> and Chief <a href="Jeremiah%20Chirau">Jeremiah Chirau</a> agreed what became the "<a href="Internal%20Settlement">Internal Settlement</a>". This created a joint black–white transitional government, with the country due to be reconstituted as <a href="Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia">Zimbabwe Rhodesia</a> in 1979, pursuant to <a href="Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia%20general%20election%2C%201979">multiracial elections</a>. ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate, but refused; Nkomo sardonically dubbed Smith's black colleagues "the blacksmiths". ZANU proclaimed 1978 to be "The Year of the People" as the war continued. Officials from Muzorewa's <a href="United%20African%20National%20Council">United African National Council</a>, sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks, were killed by Marxist–Leninist guerrillas. Insurgents also began to target <a href="Christian%20mission">Christian mission</a>aries, climaxing in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at Elim Mission near the Mozambican border on 23 June.

The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement, the military, the judiciary and the civil service under white control. No country recognised Rhodesia's interim administration. Smith again worked to bring Nkomo into the government, hoping this would lend it some credence domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA. Starting on 14 August 1978, he attended secret meetings with Nkomo in <a href="Lusaka">Lusaka</a>, Zambia (where ZAPU was based), doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation <a href="Lonmin">Lonrho</a>. Attempts were made to also involve the ZANU leader <a href="Robert%20Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a>, but Mugabe would have no part in the talks. According to the South African military historian Jakkie Cilliers, negotiations between Smith and Nkomo progressed well and "seemed on the verge of success" by the start of September 1978. On 2 September, Smith and Nkomo revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place.

Rhodesian air traffic was not seriously threatened until about 1977, in the latter stages of the war; before this time, neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target. The weapon that made such attacks feasible for ZIPRA was the <a href="9K32%20Strela-2">Strela-2</a> shoulder-launched <a href="Man-portable%20air-defense%20system">surface-to-air missile launcher</a>, supplied by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> from the mid-1970s as part of the Warsaw Pact's materiel support. By September 1978, there had been 20 reported attempts to shoot down Rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons, none of which had been successful. Some <a href="Rhodesian%20Air%20Force">Rhodesian Air Force</a> <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Dakota</a>s had been hit, but all had survived and landed safely. No civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the Bush War.

<a href="Air%20Rhodesia">Air Rhodesia</a> was the country's <a href="flag%20carrier">national airline</a>, established by the government on 1 September 1967 to succeed <a href="Central%20African%20Airways">Central African Airways</a>, which was dissolved at the end of that year. Based at <a href="Harare%20International%20Airport">Salisbury Airport</a>, Air Rhodesia's flight network during the late 1970s comprised a domestic programme of passenger and cargo flights, as well as international services to the South African cities of <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a> and <a href="Durban">Durban</a>.

The Flight 825 aircraft was a <a href="Vickers%20Viscount">Vickers Viscount</a> 782D, a British-made <a href="turboprop">turboprop</a> aircraft with two engines on each wing. It was named the "Hunyani" after the <a href="Manyame%20River">river of the same name</a>, which flowed between <a href="Lake%20Kariba">Lake Kariba</a> and the Rhodesian capital <a href="Harare">Salisbury</a>.

The "Hunyani" was on the second and final leg of its regular scheduled journey between <a href="Victoria%20Falls%2C%20Zimbabwe">Victoria Falls</a> and Salisbury, stopping over in the resort town of <a href="Kariba%2C%20Zimbabwe">Kariba</a>. Despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on Kariba by ZIPRA guerrillas on the northern side of the <a href="Zambezi">Zambezi</a> (in Zambia), the resort had endured as one of Rhodesia's choice tourist destinations. The flight on 3 September 1978, Sunday afternoon, from Kariba to Salisbury carried four crew members and 52 passengers, most of whom were holidaymakers from Salisbury, returning home after a weekend at the lake. The flight took off from <a href="Kariba%20Airport">Kariba Airport</a> on schedule soon after 17:00 <a href="Central%20Africa%20Time">Central Africa Time</a>.

Flight 825 was piloted by 36-year-old Captain John Hood, a native of <a href="Bulawayo">Bulawayo</a> who had gained his <a href="commercial%20pilot%20licence">commercial pilot licence</a> in 1966. He had flown Viscounts for Air Rhodesia since 1968, and had also served in the Rhodesian Air Force on a voluntary basis. His first officer, Garth Beaumont, was 31 years old, and had lived in Rhodesia for most of his life, having immigrated as a child from South Africa. The two air stewardesses were Dulcie Esterhuizen, 21 years old and from Bulawayo, and 23-year-old Louise Pearson, from Salisbury.

A group of ZIPRA guerrillas, armed with a Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the "Hunyani" about five minutes after it took off, while the aircraft was still in the <a href="climb%20phase">climb phase</a> of its flight. The <a href="infrared%20homing">heat-seeking</a> missile hit the plane's <a href="port%20and%20starboard">starboard</a> wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the "Hunyani" began to descend rapidly.

At 17:10 Captain Hood sent a distress call to <a href="air%20traffic%20control">air traffic control</a>, informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash. "We're going in," he radioed. Telling his passengers to brace for an <a href="emergency%20landing">emergency landing</a>, he aimed for an open field of cotton in the Whamira Hills, in the bush to the west of <a href="Karoi">Karoi</a>, intending to <a href="belly%20landing">belly land</a> the craft. The landing was relatively stable until the "Hunyani" hit a ditch, cartwheeled and exploded. The remaining fuel tanks ruptured and caught fire, setting the wrecked cabin ablaze.

Of the 56 people on board, 38, including Hood and Beaumont, died in the crash. Eighteen survived, albeit with injuries, and climbed out of the wreckage. After briefly settling the others, one of the passengers, Cecil MacLaren, led four others—young newlyweds Robert and Shannon Hargreaves, Sharon Coles, and her four-year-old daughter Tracey—off in the direction of a nearby village in search of water. The other 13 remained close to the wreckage. Meanwhile, nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site, and reached it at about 17:45. Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching: Rhodesian Army reservist Anthony Hill, 39, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same. This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage, including four women and two girls (aged 11 and 4).

The guerrillas, who were armed with <a href="AK-47">AK-47</a> rifles, presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly, saying they would summon help and bring water. They spoke in English, both to the survivors and among themselves. They told the passengers to congregate around a point a few metres from the wreckage; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk, the insurgents told the able-bodied men to carry the others. The passengers were assembled into an area of about . Standing roughly away, the cadres now raised their weapons. "You have taken our land," one of them said. "Please don't shoot us!" one of the passengers cried, just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire. Those that survived the initial bursts were bayoneted (including a mother and her 3 week old baby). 

Having collected water from the nearby village, MacLaren and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots. Thinking it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat, they continued on their way, and called out to the other passengers, who they thought were still alive. This alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors; one of the guerrillas told MacLaren's group to "come here". The insurgents then opened fire on their general location, prompting MacLaren and the others to flee. Hill and the Hansens also ran; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their haste, but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge. After Hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours, they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about 19:45. The guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the suitcases strewn around the site, filled their arms with passengers' belongings, then left again.

The survivors were found over the following days by the Rhodesian Army and police; Hill and the Hansens were taken to Kariba Hospital, while MacLaren and his group were airlifted to <a href="Parirenyatwa%20Hospital">Andrew Fleming Hospital</a> in Salisbury.

Nkomo claimed responsibility for the attack in an interview with the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s "<a href="Today%20%28BBC%20Radio%204%29">Today</a>" radio programme the next day, laughing as he did so, to the horror of most Rhodesian observers, both black and white. He said that he had received intelligence that the "Hunyani" was being used for military purposes. Nkomo said he regretted the deaths as it was not his party's policy to kill civilians, and denied that his men had killed any survivors on the ground; by contrast, he said that his men had helped them, and had left them alive. He also accused Air Rhodesia of surreptitiously hauling troops and war <a href="materiel">materiel</a> for the government, an allegation that Captain Pat Travers, Air Rhodesia's general manager, called a "downright, deliberate lie".

According to Eliakim Sibanda, a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history of ZAPU, Nkomo was implying that responsibility for the massacre lay with security force pseudo-guerrillas, more specifically the <a href="Selous%20Scouts">Selous Scouts</a> unit, which had often been accused of brutalising rural civilians with the goal of shifting public opinion. Sibanda asserts that the massacre "cannot be put beyond" the Scouts, and also supports Nkomo's claim that the "Hunyani" had been used militarily, suggesting that ZIPRA might have believed there to be Rhodesian soldiers on board. "Rhodesian television, before attacks on ZANLA in Mozambique, had shown Viscounts ferrying paratroopers for the job," he writes, "... [and] ZIPRA intelligence knew there were paratroopers stationed [at Victoria Falls]".

A report published in the American magazine "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" a fortnight later described the incident as "a genuine horror story, calculated to make the most alarming of Rhodesian doomsday prophecies seem true." The white community in Rhodesia heard the news with fury, and many turned their minds to exacting retribution for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism. The prominent <a href="Indians%20in%20Zimbabwe">Indian-Rhodesian</a> Gulab family was particularly affected by the incident, having lost eight members in the attack. Although Rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause of the crash, doing so only after four days' investigation, the truth was common knowledge in Salisbury within hours. Smith wrote in his memoirs that the "degree of anger ... [was] difficult to control". White South Africans were similarly enraged, particularly after reports appeared in the South African press that the killers had raped the female passengers before massacring them. A Friends of Rhodesia Society in South Africa offered a reward of <a href="South%20African%20rand">R</a>100,000 to anybody who would either kill Nkomo or bring him to Salisbury to stand trial.

<a href="Geoffrey%20Nyarota">Geoffrey Nyarota</a>, who was then one of the few black reporters at the "<a href="The%20Herald%20%28Zimbabwe%29">Rhodesia Herald</a>" newspaper, later wrote in his memoirs that many whites became resentful and wary towards blacks in general, believing them all to be "terrorist sympathisers". Describing the "Herald" newsroom the night of the incident, he relates a "vile collective temper" among the white <a href="Copy%20editing">sub-editors</a>: "They cursed until their voices became hoarse, threatening dire consequences for all "terrs" and "munts" or "kaffirs"... I sensed that some of the more derogatory remarks made in unnecessarily loud voices that evening were meant specifically for my ears."

Several racially motivated incidents occurred over the following days. According to the "Time" article, a group of whites entered an unsegregated Salisbury bar "fingering the triggers of rifles" and forced blacks drinking there to leave. "Time" also reported a rumour that two white youths, on learning of the massacre, shot the first black man they saw. Smith says that several would-be <a href="vigilante">vigilante</a> groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to "make the local people pay for their crime of harbouring and assisting the terrorists". He instructed them not to, according to his memoirs, telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme duress, and that it would not do to attack them. Many Rhodesians also resented the apparent lack of sympathy emanating from overseas governments, especially considering the character of the attack and its civilian target.

At a memorial service held on 8 September 1978 for Flight 825's passengers and crew at Salisbury's Anglican Cathedral, about 2,000 people crowded inside, with another 500 standing outside on the steps and pavement, many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets. Prominent among those present in the cathedral were uniformed Air Rhodesia and <a href="South%20African%20Airways">South African Airways</a> personnel, as well as <a href="Rhodesian%20Special%20Air%20Service">Rhodesian Special Air Service</a> soldiers and senior officers from other military units. Smith and several government ministers also attended, including <a href="P.%20K.%20van%20der%20Byl">P K van der Byl</a>, the co-Minister of Foreign Affairs.

<a href="Dean%20%28Christianity%29">Dean</a> <a href="John%20de%20Costa">John de Costa</a> gave a sermon damning what he described as a "deafening silence" from overseas. "Nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but sickened at the events attending the Viscount," he said. "But are we deafened with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves civilised? We are not! Like men in the story of the <a href="Parable%20of%20the%20Good%20Samaritan">Good Samaritan</a>, they pass by on the other side... The ghastliness of this ill-fated flight from Kariba will be burnt upon our memories for years to come. For others, far from our borders, it is an intellectual matter, not one which affects them deeply. Here is the tragedy!"

The talks between Smith and the ZAPU leader that had been progressing so promisingly were immediately halted by Salisbury. Smith himself called Nkomo a "monster". Cilliers comments that the ending of the Smith–Nkomo talks at this time was "potentially the most serious result of the Viscount massacre", as the talks had been progressing well before the incident. He surmises that an agreement between the two "at this critical stage" might have helped the transitional Rhodesian government to secure international recognition.

On 10 September, the Prime Minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a>, which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed. He declared Rhodesia's intent to "liquidate the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism", and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for "any defensive strikes we might undertake" against guerrilla bases in their respective territories. He claimed that the war had escalated because Britain and the United States were supporting the Patriotic Front. <a href="William%20Irvine%20%28Rhodesian%20politician%29">William Irvine</a>, the co-Minister of Transport, warned the guerrillas that Rhodesia "w[ould] not let these innocents go unavenged".

Because ZAPU and ZIPRA were based in Zambia, many Rhodesians clamoured for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country, but the first external target hit by the security forces following the Viscount shootdown was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around <a href="Chimoio">Chimoio</a> in Mozambique. The Rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in November 1977 during <a href="Operation%20Dingo">Operation "Dingo"</a>, destroying much of the ZANLA presence there, but the insurgents had since built a complex called "New Chimoio", slightly to the east; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals. In a combined airborne-ground assault called Operation "Snoopy", the Rhodesian Air Force, <a href="Rhodesian%20Light%20Infantry">Rhodesian Light Infantry</a> and Special Air Service wiped out much of New Chimoio on 20 September 1978. Mozambique sent armour to ZANLA's aid in the form of nine Soviet-made <a href="T-54/55">T-54</a> tanks and four Russian <a href="BTR-152">BTR-152</a> armoured personnel carriers, but the former were routed and one of the latter destroyed by the Rhodesian security forces. According to Rhodesian figures, there were "several hundred" guerrillas killed, while the security forces lost only two soldiers, one of whom was accidentally killed by a <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly</a> air strike.

Rhodesia then attacked ZIPRA's bases in Zambia, in what Group Captain Peter Petter-Bowyer later described as "payback time" for Flight 825.

Operation Gatling was launched on 19 October 1978. It was another joint-force operation between the Air Force and the Army, which contributed <a href="Rhodesian%20Special%20Air%20Service">Rhodesian Special Air Service</a> and <a href="Rhodesian%20Light%20Infantry">Rhodesian Light Infantry</a> paratroopers. "Gatling" primary target, just north-east of central <a href="Lusaka">Lusaka</a>, was the formerly white-owned <a href="Westlands%20Farm">Westlands Farm</a>, which had been transformed into ZIPRA's main headquarters and training base under the name "Freedom Camp". <a href="ZIPRA">ZIPRA</a> presumed that Rhodesia would never dare to attack a site so close to Lusaka. About 4,000 guerrillas underwent training at <a href="Freedom%20Camp">Freedom Camp</a>, with senior ZIPRA staff also on site. The Rhodesian operation's other targets were <a href="Chikumbi">Chikumbi</a>, north of Lusaka, and Mkushi Camp; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia. Assaulting targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked.

Led by Squadron Leader Chris Dixon, who identified himself to <a href="Lusaka%20International%20Airport">Lusaka Airport</a> tower as "Green Leader", a <a href="Rhodesian%20Air%20Force">Rhodesian Air Force</a> group flew into <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a> at very low altitudes (thereby avoiding Zambian radar) and took control of the country's <a href="airspace">airspace</a> for about a quarter of an hour during the initial assault on Westlands Farm, informing Lusaka tower that the attack was against "Rhodesian dissidents, and not against Zambia", and that Rhodesian <a href="Hawker%20Hunter">Hawker Hunter</a>s were circling the Zambian airfields under orders to shoot down any fighter that attempted to take off. The Zambians obeyed all of Green Leader's instructions, made no attempt to resist and temporarily halted civil air traffic. Using <a href="Rufunsa%20District">Rufunsa</a> airstrip in eastern Zambia as a forward base, the Rhodesian military suffered only minor casualties during the three-day operation, and afterwards claimed to have killed over 1,500 ZIPRA personnel, as well as some Cuban instructors.

Historians <a href="Paul%20Moorcraft">Paul Moorcraft</a> and <a href="Peter%20McLaughlin">Peter McLaughlin</a> write that this exaggerated considerably the number of guerrillas killed, as most of Nkomo's army, then numbering about 10,000 fighters, had not been touched. On the other hand, unarmed <a href="refugee">refugee</a>s often camped in or around insurgent positions, and hundreds of these had been killed in the Rhodesian raid. Moorcraft and McLaughlin comment that for the Rhodesian airmen, it would have been "impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young ZIPRA recruits." Sibanda describes Freedom Camp as "a refugee camp for boys", and says "351 boys and girls" were killed. He claims that the <a href="International%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Movement">Red Cross</a> and the <a href="United%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees">UN Refugee Agency</a> "confirmed ZAPU's claim that Smith's forces struck at defenseless, civilian trainees".

The Rhodesian attacks on ZANLA and ZIPRA bases did much to restore the morale of the Rhodesian people following the Viscount incident, though they had not made much impact on the respective guerrilla campaigns. Nkomo and the Zambian President <a href="Kenneth%20Kaunda">Kenneth Kaunda</a> all the same requested further military aid and better weapons from the Soviets and the British respectively. Martial law was quickly extended across Rhodesia's rural areas, and covered three-quarters of the country by the end of 1978. Air Rhodesia, meanwhile, began developing shielding for its Viscounts. Before this work was completed, ZIPRA shot down a second Viscount, <a href="Air%20Rhodesia%20Flight%20827">Air Rhodesia Flight 827</a>, on 12 February 1979. This time there were no survivors.

Following the second shootdown, Air Rhodesia created a system whereby the underside of the Viscounts would be coated with paint, with the exhaust pipes concurrently shrouded. According to tests conducted by the Air Force, a Viscount so treated could not be detected by the Strela's targeting system once it was over . There were no further Viscount shootdowns in Rhodesia.

In the elections held the following year under the Internal Settlement terms, boycotted by ZANU and ZAPU, Muzorewa won a majority, and became the first Prime Minister of the reconstituted, state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia on 1 June 1979. This new order failed to win international acceptance, however, and in December 1979 the <a href="Lancaster%20House%20Agreement">Lancaster House Agreement</a> was agreed in London by Zimbabwe Rhodesia, the UK government and the Patriotic Front, returning the country to its former colonial status. The UK government suspended the constitution and took direct control for an interim period. <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201980">Fresh elections</a> were won by Mugabe, who took power in April 1980, concurrently with the country's recognised independence as Zimbabwe.

In modern Zimbabwe, it is not the Viscount shootdowns but rather the retributory Rhodesian strikes against nationalist guerrilla camps that endure predominantly in the cultural memory. State media in Zimbabwe, prominently the "Herald" newspaper, often claim that Rhodesian forces indiscriminately and deliberately slaughtered thousands of helpless refugees during such operations. ZIPRA's downing of civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate act of war on the grounds that the guerrillas might have believed them to have military personnel or equipment on board. The massacre of surviving Flight 825 passengers at the crash site is often omitted or attributed to forces other than ZIPRA; in his 1984 memoirs Nkomo repeated his claim that ZIPRA fighters had helped the survivors, and wrote simply that "I truly have no idea how the ten died".

A monument to those killed in the Rhodesian attack on Chikumbi was built in Zambia in 1998, and dedicated jointly by the Zambian and Zimbabwean governments. A memorial to the victims of the two Rhodesian Viscount incidents, dubbed the Viscount Memorial, was erected on the grounds of the <a href="Voortrekker%20Monument">Voortrekker Monument</a> in <a href="Pretoria">Pretoria</a>, South Africa, in 2012, and inaugurated on 1 September that year. The names of the dead passengers and crew are engraved on two granite slabs that stand upright, side by side, the pair topped by an emblem symbolising an aircraft. A pole beside the monument flies the <a href="flag%20of%20Rhodesia">Rhodesian flag</a>.

A British parliamentary motion put forward by <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> MP <a href="Kate%20Hoey">Kate Hoey</a> in February 2013 to retrospectively condemn the Viscount attacks and memorialise the victims on the anniversary of the second shootdown prompted outcry in the Zimbabwean press, with the "Herald" branding it a racist "<a href="Rhodie">Rhodie</a> motion" intended to antagonise the Mugabe administration and its supporters. <a href="Dumiso%20Dabengwa">Dumiso Dabengwa</a>, a former ZIPRA commander, described the move as a provocation motivated by race that went against the spirit of the amnesty enacted at Lancaster House. <a href="Christopher%20Mutsvangwa">Christopher Mutsvangwa</a>, a diplomat and political analyst, took a similar line, calling Hoey's proposed commemoration "a provocation ... [that] means they only regard the death of white people alone during the struggle. There is no mention of what happened to our sons and daughters in and outside the country." ZAPU's official response to Hoey's motion included the assertion that in all conflicts "civilians get caught up in cross-fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication errors", and juxtaposed the civilians killed in the Viscount shootdowns with those killed at Chikumbi.

George Koval

George Abramovich Koval (, Zhorzh Abramovich Koval, December 25, 1913 – January 31, 2006) was an American who acted as a <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> intelligence officer for the <a href="Soviet%20atomic%20bomb%20project">Soviet atomic bomb project</a>. According to Russian sources, Koval's infiltration of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> as a <a href="Main%20Intelligence%20Directorate%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">GRU</a> (Soviet military intelligence) agent "drastically reduced the amount of time it took for Russia to develop nuclear weapons." 

Koval was born to Russian <a href="Judaism">Jewish</a> immigrants in <a href="Sioux%20City%2C%20Iowa">Sioux City, Iowa</a>. As an adult, he traveled with his parents to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> to settle in the <a href="Jewish%20Autonomous%20Region">Jewish Autonomous Region</a> near the Chinese border. Koval was recruited by the Soviet <a href="Main%20Intelligence%20Directorate%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">GRU</a> (military intelligence), trained, and assigned the code name DELMAR. He returned to the United States in 1940 and was drafted into the U.S. Army in early 1943. Koval worked at atomic research laboratories and, according to the Russian government, relayed back to the Soviet Union information about the production processes and volumes of the <a href="polonium">polonium</a>, <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a>, and <a href="uranium">uranium</a> used in American atomic weaponry, and descriptions of the weapon production sites. In 1948, Koval left on a European vacation but never returned to the United States. In 2007 Russian President <a href="Vladimir%20Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> posthumously awarded Koval the <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation">Hero of the Russian Federation</a> decoration for "his courage and heroism while carrying out special missions".

George Koval's father, Abram Koval, left his home town of <a href="Telekhany">Telekhany</a> in <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a> to immigrate to the United States in 1910. Abram, a carpenter, settled in <a href="Sioux%20City%2C%20Iowa">Sioux City, Iowa</a>, which, at the turn of the 20th century, was home to a sizeable Jewish population of merchants and craftsmen. He and his wife Ethel Shenitsky Koval raised three sons: Isaya, born 1912; George (or Zhorzh), born Christmas 1913; and Gabriel, born 1919.

George Koval attended Central High School, a red-brick <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian</a> building better known as "the Castle on the Hill". Neighbors recalled that Koval spoke openly of his <a href="Communist">Communist</a> beliefs. While attending Central High he was a member of the Honor Society and the debate team. He graduated in 1929 at the age of 15. Meanwhile, his parents left Sioux City as the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> deepened. Abram Koval became the secretary for ICOR, the <a href="Organization%20for%20Jewish%20Colonization%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Organization for Jewish Colonization in the Soviet Union</a>. Founded by American Jewish Communists in 1924, the group helped to finance and publicize the development of the "<a href="Jewish%20Autonomous%20Oblast">Jewish Autonomous Region</a>" – the Communist answer to <a href="aliyah">Jewish emigration</a> to the <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">British Mandate of Palestine</a> then being undertaken by the <a href="Zionism">Zionist</a> movement. The Koval family emigrated in 1932, traveling with a United States family passport. They settled in <a href="Birobidzhan">Birobidzhan</a>, near the border of Manchuria.

The Koval family worked on a <a href="collective%20farm">collective farm</a> and were profiled by an American Communist daily newspaper in New York City. The journalist <a href="Paul%20Novick">Paul Novick</a> wrote to his readers that the family "had exchanged the uncertainty of life as small storekeepers ... for a worry-free existence for themselves and their children." While Isaya became a champion tractor driver, George Koval improved his Russian language skills in the collective and began studies at the <a href="Mendeleev%20Russian%20University%20of%20Chemistry%20and%20Technology">Mendeleev Institute of Chemical Technology</a> in 1934. At the university, he met and married fellow student Lyudmila Ivanova. Koval graduated with honors in five years and received Soviet citizenship.

Later, Koval was recruited by the Soviet Main Intelligence Directorate (Главное Разведывательное Управление), or <a href="GRU">GRU</a>. By the time he received his degree he had left Moscow under orders as part of a subterfuge. He was drafted into the Soviet army in 1939 to explain his sudden disappearance from the city. Though his parents had relinquished their US family passport, Koval returned to the US in 1940, replacing a spy recalled during <a href="Great%20Purge">Stalin's purges</a>. His code name was DELMAR. Arriving in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, he traveled to New York City. According to Arnold Kramish, an American colleague he befriended and with whom he re-established contact in 2000, it was there that Koval assumed deputy command of the local GRU cell. This outpost operated under the cover of the <a href="Raven%20Electric%20Company">Raven Electric Company</a>, a supplier to firms such as <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a>. Koval told coworkers he was a native New Yorker and an only child. He ingratiated himself with everyone he met. While Koval originally worked under a pseudonym, gathering information on toxins for use in <a href="chemical%20weapon">chemical weapon</a>s, his handlers decided to have him work under his real name.

During the beginning of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> had re-introduced <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States%23World%20War%20II">the draft</a> (conscription) in September 1940, and Koval registered for it on January 2, 1941. Raven Electric Company secured him a year's deferment from service until February 1942. According to historian <a href="Vladimir%20Lota">Vladimir Lota</a>, Koval's handlers wanted him to steal information about chemical weapons, and felt that he would not be able to do so while drafted. When the deferment expired, Koval was inducted into the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>. He received basic training at <a href="Fort%20Dix">Fort Dix</a> in <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> before being sent to the Citadel in <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>. There, Koval served as a <a href="private%20%28military%29">private</a> in the 3410th Specialized Training and Reassignment Unit. On August 11, 1943, he was transferred to the Army Specialized Training Program, a unit established in December 1942 to provide talented enlistees with an education and technical training. Koval attended the <a href="City%20College%20of%20New%20York">City College of New York</a> (CCNY) and studied electrical engineering. His CCNY classmates looked up to the older Koval as a role model and father figure who never did homework and was a noted ladies' man, never knowing about his Soviet education and wife. Colleagues recalled that he never discussed politics or the Soviet Union.

The Specialized Training Program was dissolved in early 1944, as the progress of the war tipped in favor of the Allies; many of the CCNY classmates were transferred to the infantry, while Koval and a dozen others were selected for the Special Engineer Detachment. The Detachment was part of the covert project to design, engineer, and fabricate an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>—an American, Canadian and British initiative known as the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>. Koval was assigned to <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>; at the time, Project scientists were researching <a href="enriched%20uranium">enriched uranium</a> and <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a>-based bombs, with the Oak Ridge laboratories central to the development of both. The Project suffered from a lack of human resources, and asked the Army for technically qualified men.

Koval enjoyed free access to much of Oak Ridge; he was made a "health physics officer", and monitored radiation levels across the facility. According to <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> records, the job gave him <a href="top-secret">top-secret</a> security clearance. At the time, Project scientists discovered reactor-produced plutonium was too unstable for the intended bomb designs, and that <a href="polonium">polonium</a> <a href="Modulated%20neutron%20initiator">initiators (urchin)</a> were needed for the necessary chain reactions to occur. Koval was charged by his handlers with watching Oak Ridge's polonium supply to transmit information about it through a Soviet contact named "Clyde". His information reached Moscow via coded dispatches, couriers, and the Soviet Embassy. Among the intelligence he sent was that Oak Ridge's polonium was being sent to another Project site at <a href="Los%20Alamos%20National%20Laboratory">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>.

Koval was transferred from Oak Ridge to a <a href="Dayton%20Project">top-secret lab</a> in <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a> on June 27, 1945, where polonium initiators were fabricated. The world's first <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a> was detonated in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> on July 16 of that year. Atomic bombs were dropped on Japan on August 6 and 9, leading to <a href="Surrender%20of%20Japan">Japan's surrender</a> and the end of World War II. The Soviet Union responded by increasing efforts to <a href="Soviet%20atomic%20bomb%20project">develop its own atomic bomb</a>. While the American <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> estimated the Soviets would not succeed until 1950–53, the first Soviet atomic bomb was detonated on August 29, 1949. The initiator for the plutonium bomb was, according to Russian military officials, "prepared to the 'recipe' provided by military intelligence agent Delmar [Koval]".

After World War II, Koval was discharged from the Army. He returned to New York and CCNY, where he received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering on February 1, 1948. Telling his friends he was thinking about taking a trip to <a href="Poland">Poland</a> or <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, Koval secured a passport for six months' travel to Europe. According to the Russian publication "<a href="Rossiyskaya%20Gazeta">Rossiyskaya Gazeta</a>", he might have left because American counter-intelligence agents had discovered Soviet literature about his parents after being tipped off about the leak by a Soviet defector. He left by sea in October 1948 and never returned to his birth country. In Russia, he left the Soviet military with discharge papers as an untrained rifleman and the rank of private. His foreign background and service record made him "a very suspicious character", he wrote to Kramish. Turned down for education and research positions, Koval turned to his old GRU contact, who secured him a job as a laboratory assistant at the <a href="Mendeleev%20Russian%20University%20of%20Chemistry%20and%20Technology">Mendeleev Institute</a>. Eventually, Koval managed to obtain a teaching job there; his students often laughed at his foreign pronunciations for technical terms.

While other spies such as <a href="Julius%20and%20Ethel%20Rosenberg">Julius and Ethel Rosenberg</a> and <a href="Klaus%20Fuchs">Klaus Fuchs</a> were caught after the war, Koval apparently went unscrutinized for years. Among the reasons given for his maintained cover was that inter-service politics undermined efforts to perform proper security checks on employees. Another possibility is that the U.S. government chose scientific ability over clear records and political sympathies. In the 1950s, the FBI investigated his wartime activities and interviewed his former colleagues, leaving them with the impression that he might have been a spy. The matter was kept confidential for sixty years as the US was afraid of the damage that would result from the exposure of Koval's activities.

In 1999, Koval was living on his small pension in Russia and had heard that U.S. War Veterans like himself could apply for U.S. Social Security Payments. He applied. In 2000, the Social Security Administration's Office of Central Operations, Baltimore, Maryland responded with a one-sentence letter: "We are writing to tell you that you do not qualify for retirement benefits."

Koval described his 57 years of post-spy life living in Russia as "uneventful". His family knew he had done work for the GRU, but the subject was never discussed. He did not receive any high awards upon his return, a fact that bothered him. Bigger awards went to "career men", he told Kramish. However, he ended his correspondence by saying that he was not protesting his treatment; "[I am thankful] that I did not find myself in a <a href="Gulag">Gulag</a>, as might well have happened". Koval died in his Moscow apartment on January 31, 2006, at the age of 92.

Koval's activities as a spy began to emerge after the publication of a 2002 book, "The GRU and the Atomic Bomb", which mentioned Koval by his code name and listed him as one of a handful of spies who evaded counterintelligence groups. On November 3, 2007, he received the posthumous title of <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation">Hero of the Russian Federation</a> bestowed by Russian President <a href="Vladimir%20Putin">Vladimir Putin</a>. When Koval was honored, the Russian presidential proclamation stated, "Mr Koval, who operated under the pseudonym Delmar, provided information that helped speed up considerably the time it took for the Soviet Union to develop an atomic bomb of its own".

The Chaser APEC pranks

The Chaser APEC pranks were a series of <a href="comedy">comic</a> stunts that targeted the <a href="APEC%20Australia%202007">Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders Summit</a> (2–9 September 2007), in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, Australia. They were coordinated and performed by the Australian <a href="satire">satire</a> group <a href="The%20Chaser">The Chaser</a> for the television series "<a href="The%20Chaser%27s%20War%20on%20Everything">The Chaser's War on Everything</a>". The most prominent prank was the breach of an APEC restricted zone in the heart of <a href="Sydney%20central%20business%20district">Sydney central business district</a> on 6 September. <a href="Julian%20Morrow">Julian Morrow</a> directed a fake Canadian motorcade, which was allowed through the restricted zone by police and not detected until <a href="Chas%20Licciardello">Chas Licciardello</a> alighted, dressed as <a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden">Osama bin Laden</a>.

Although pranks that involved public locations, figures, and organisations were always a feature of the series, the APEC pranks yielded unprecedented local and international publicity, both positive and negative. Some team members faced <a href="Criminal%20charge">charges</a> for breaching the APEC zone, but these were dropped because police had allowed their entry into the restricted zone. Other less controversial and less publicised stunts were also shown on "The Chaser's War on Everything", with ratings peaking at almost three million Australian viewers for the APEC wrap-up episode.

APEC Australia 2007 comprised a series of political meetings between representatives of the 21 member governments of the <a href="Asia-Pacific%20Economic%20Cooperation">Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation</a>. This culminated in a week-long summit meeting: Leaders Week, 2 to 9 September, when heads of the member governments gathered in <a href="Sydney%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Sydney</a>.
The significance of the APEC summit called for stringent and expensive security arrangements. The Protective Security Coordination Centre, of the National Security and Criminal Justice Group from the Australian <a href="Attorney-General%27s%20Department%20%28Australia%29">Attorney-General's Department</a>, oversaw security planning through the APEC 2007 Security Branch, formed expressly for the APEC meetings. In order to secure and monitor the summit, the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Police%20Force">New South Wales Police Force</a> instituted the APEC Police Security Command. Many public roads in Sydney were closed, as leaders, officials, and personnel travelled in <a href="motorcade">motorcade</a>s around the city centre. Figures released by the state government at a <a href="Australian%20Senate">Senate</a> committee hearing show that security measures at APEC cost <a href="Australian%20dollar">$</a>170 million.

The Chaser group's founding members were <a href="Charles%20Firth%20%28comedian%29">Charles Firth</a>, <a href="Dominic%20Knight">Dominic Knight</a>, <a href="Craig%20Reucassel">Craig Reucassel</a>, and <a href="Julian%20Morrow">Julian Morrow</a>. In 1999 they started "<a href="The%20Chaser%20%28newspaper%29">The Chaser</a>", a <a href="fortnight">fortnight</a>ly satirical newspaper. <a href="Chas%20Licciardello">Chas Licciardello</a>, <a href="Andrew%20Hansen">Andrew Hansen</a>, and <a href="Chris%20Taylor%20%28comedian%29">Chris Taylor</a> later joined the group; and in 2006, after various ventures in radio, stage, and television, this line-up created "<a href="The%20Chaser%27s%20War%20on%20Everything">The Chaser's War on Everything</a>", its most successful program, which screened on the <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a> (ABC) station <a href="ABC1">ABC1</a>. By its second season in 2007, the show had forged a reputation for ambush-style stunts and deliberate controversy.

The group had been warned about the dangers of irresponsible behaviour during the Sydney lockdown for the APEC summit. According to New South Wales Police Minister <a href="David%20Campbell%20%28Australian%20politician%29">David Campbell</a>, the police understood that "parody and satire are entertaining and fun", but The Chaser must understand the "seriousness of this matter [APEC] and take caution". A later police statement reiterated that producers of "The Chaser's War on Everything" had been warned about the "ramifications of stunts during APEC".
The Chaser was unfazed by police warnings. Before the summit, Julian Morrow commented on radio that "the eyes of the world and the eyes of <a href="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a> are on us". Morrow hinted that their challenge was to perform a stunt that would "make <a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> feel a little incompetent".

On 6 September 2007, eight members of the team (including five runners dressed as bodyguards) and three hired chauffeurs manned a fake Canadian motorcade consisting of two motorcycles, two black four-wheel drive vehicles, and a black sedan. The group—including Chas Licciardello dressed as Osama bin Laden, and Julian Morrow—drove the motorcade through the Sydney central business district and breached the APEC security zone. The premise of the stunt was that bin Laden should have been invited to the summit as a world leader, to discuss the <a href="War%20on%20Terrorism">War on Terror</a>, with another motive being to test the event's security. The stunt was approved by ABC lawyers under the assumption that the motorcade would be stopped at the first security checkpoint and denied entry.
In the following episode of "The Chaser's War on Everything", the team emphasised that their only realistic attempt to disguise the vehicles was the use of a <a href="flag%20of%20Canada">Canadian flag</a>. Taylor later said that there was "no particular reason we chose Canada, we just thought they'd be a country who the cops wouldn't scrutinise too closely, and who feasibly would only have three cars in their motorcade—as opposed to the 20 or so gas guzzlers that Bush has brought with him". There were many deliberate indications that the motorcade was not genuine, particularly on the fake credentials used by the team; members' security passes were printed with "JOKE", "Insecurity", and "It's pretty obvious this isn't a real pass" all clearly visible, while the "APEC 2007 Official Vehicle" stickers included both the name of the series and the text "This dude likes trees and poetry and certain types of carnivorous plants excite him". In addition, some of the runners were holding <a href="video%20camera">camcorders</a> and one of the motorcyclists was wearing jeans, both highly unusual for an official motorcade.
At 11.30 am (<a href="Time%20in%20Australia">AEDT</a>), the motorcade began its journey towards the "ring of steel", a fenced area at the intersection of Bent and <a href="Macquarie%20Street%2C%20Sydney">Macquarie</a> Streets. The vehicle (or vehicles) stopped for a <a href="traffic%20light">red light</a> and the police became aware of the motorcade's presence, but waved them towards the checkpoint. The convoy travelled through the first checkpoint without inspection and proceeded in a northerly direction to a second security checkpoint in the prohibited "red zone", just before Bridge Street. Both motorcyclists had by now separated from the motorcade, which was waved through the second checkpoint by police officers. It travelled further into the restricted area before stopping outside the <a href="InterContinental">InterContinental</a> Hotel.

Morrow ordered the motorcade to turn around at the Bridge Street intersection because he realised that they had proceeded further than expected, and because the police officers were not going to stop them. After partially turning the motorcade, Licciardello alighted onto the street and complained, in character as bin Laden, about not being invited to the APEC Summit. At this point, the police requested Morrow's identity. After inspecting his fake pass, officers realised that Morrow was from The Chaser and took all eleven members of the motorcade into custody. Surprisingly, as pointed out by the team on their television show, the officers initially ignored Licciardello (Osama Bin Laden) and only arrested Morrow.

The arrested cast and crew were immediately taken to <a href="Surry%20Hills">Surry Hills</a> Police Station, where they were questioned and charged with entering a prohibited area under the "APEC Meeting (Police Powers) Act 2007". All were released on <a href="bail">bail</a> to appear in court on 4 October 2007. Under the new legislation, the crew members would each face a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment if they were convicted or up to two years if they were in possession of a "prohibited item".

Following the breach of the APEC restricted area, the actions of The Chaser became the subject of intense debate among sections of the media, senior police officers, and government ministers.

Despite strong condemnation from some officials, the stunt was mostly well received by the public. A Sydney correspondent for the <a href="BBC">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> reported that the Chaser team had become "folk heroes" after the prank, while 87% of the 28,451 respondents to a "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">Sydney Morning Herald</a>" internet poll found the stunt "funny".

However, the ABC received more than 250 complaints, outweighing the 177 positive submissions. A spokesperson for the national broadcaster said that the results were misleading because people who enjoyed the show typically do not make comments. Around the country, around 80% of callers to <a href="talk%20radio">talkback radio</a> were supportive; and one third of all calls regarding APEC mentioned the stunt.

There were many critics among politicians and officials. Representatives of the police force in Sydney were among the most severe, and New South Wales Police Commissioner <a href="Andrew%20Scipione">Andrew Scipione</a>, the head of APEC's lead security agency, was angered because the comedians could have been shot by police <a href="sniper">sniper</a>s, who were "clearly ... there because they mean business. They're not there for show." In response, Licciardello expressed his faith in the snipers' professional ability: "They are highly trained, competent people and they're not going to shoot people if they're in an Osama bin Laden costume if they clearly don't pose a threat".

Many politicians, mostly from the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor</a> government of New South Wales, reacted to the security breach with concern and unease. Police Minister <a href="David%20Andrew%20Campbell">David Andrew Campbell</a> expressed disappointment and concern over the stunt, arguing that there were "21 world leaders arriving in the city at the one time and it needs to be taken seriously". Then <a href="Premiers%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales Premier</a> <a href="Morris%20Iemma">Morris Iemma</a> said that while he was a fan of the show, those involved would have to face the full force of the law. The then Federal <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20Leaders%20of%20the%20Opposition">Opposition Leader</a> <a href="Kevin%20Rudd">Kevin Rudd</a>, also from the Labor Party, voiced similar concerns, saying that "I'm a fan of The Chaser ... but I think these guys have crossed the line."

<a href="Alexander%20Downer">Alexander Downer</a>, the <a href="Minister%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Foreign Affairs</a> in Australia's <a href="Coalition%20%28Australia%29">Coalition</a> government, was amused when asked to comment on the incident. He said the arrests proved that the security system had functioned properly, adding that "whatever you think of the humour of The Chaser ... they were clearly not going to harm anybody in a physical way". The incident also generated debate during <a href="Question%20Time">Question Time</a> in the Senate.

The APEC security breach captured international attention and acclaim. A local newspaper in Canada saw the humorous side, despite the pranksters posing as Canadian officials. In the United States media reviews were mixed. Newsreaders from American networks such as the <a href="Fox%20News%20Channel">Fox News Channel</a>, <a href="NBC">National Broadcasting Company</a>, and <a href="CBS">CBS Broadcasting</a> either "raised their eyebrows" or "had smiles on their faces over the stunt". After the high ratings for the episode and international recognition derived from the stunt, the program began screening in countries such as <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, South Korea, and New Zealand; and other countries, especially in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, began negotiating with the ABC.
The stunt was named the Best Television Moment at the <a href="MTV%20Australia%20Awards%232008">2008 MTV Australia Awards</a>. Australian scholar <a href="Niall%20Lucy">Niall Lucy</a> analyses the prank's political significance as an important act of deconstruction in his book "Pomo Oz: Fear and Loathing Downunder".

On 6 September 2007, the tabloid <a href="Current%20affairs%20%28news%20format%29">current affairs</a> program "<a href="Today%20Tonight">Today Tonight</a>" from the <a href="Seven%20Network">Seven Network</a> aired a story headed "Dangerous Fools", specifically devoted to the APEC stunt. Host <a href="Anna%20Coren">Anna Coren</a> asserted that The Chaser were wasting taxpayers' money, and will "need more of those funds [in legal costs to the government-funded ABC] to defend their actions in court". Coren claimed that the ABC chiefs were too arrogant to reply to the program's inquiries. A media commentator interviewed in the report condemned the APEC stunt as "over the top", and said he could not see the humour of it. A security expert presented his view, saying that there was a serious risk of injury, not just to the crew members, but to onlookers outside the security zone, even though the breach was discovered by police officers well inside the prohibited area.

"Today Tonight"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s broadcast criticised The Chaser's approach to the APEC event, describing the stunt as "[stretching] the boundaries yet again". The program quoted Morrow's radio comments about wanting "a stunt that can really hit the headlines across the world" as evidence of irresponsibility. The show also presented <a href="Craig%20Reucassel">Craig Reucassel</a> from The Chaser, responding to questions and claiming that the comedians were "hardly sorry" for their actions. Ironically, the report was made by <a href="David%20Richardson%20%28Australian%29">Dave "Sluggo" Richardson</a>, notorious for his hoax story "<a href="Today%20Tonight%23Christopher%20Skase%20controversy">In Barcelona Tonight</a>"; but Richardson, unlike The Chaser crew, had not gone through roadblocks in his stunt.

The rival <a href="Nine%20Network">Nine Network</a>'s current affairs program "<a href="A%20Current%20Affair%20%28Australian%20TV%20series%29">A Current Affair</a>" also aired a report. A Nine cameraman had seen the stunt unfold, and managed to capture it on tape. The report revolved around the incompetence of the police and security personnel, in contrast to "Today Tonight's" criticism of The Chaser's actions, and spoke of the group executing "their grandest gag yet", bringing together "the world's most powerful man and the world's most wanted, in the same place, at the same time", referring to US president Bush and terrorist bin Laden.

After their arrest and questioning by police, all eleven participants in the stunt (eight production members of "The Chaser's War on Everything" and three hired drivers) were charged with "entering a restricted area without special justification" under the "APEC Meeting (Police Powers) Act 2007". All eleven were granted bail, on the condition that they refrain from entering any of the APEC secured areas, and ordered to appear at the Downing Centre Local Court on 4 October 2007. Those charged were Esteban Alegria, Nathan Earl, Giles Hardie, Lauren Howard, Mark Kordi, Chas Licciardello, Geoffrey Lye, Alexander Morrow, Julian Morrow, Rodrigo Pena, and Benson Simpson. After numerous adjournments, all charges were dropped by the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) on 28 April 2008.

It was decided that the police, failing to notice that the presented security badges were fake, had given "tacit" permission for the group to enter the restricted zone. Further, the actions of the police on the scene, who themselves may have been unaware of where, exactly, the legally restricted area began, caused the "Chaser" team to proceed much further into the heart of the security zone than they had intended to or realised. This meant their breach of the law had happened largely due to an exculpating <a href="Mistake%20%28criminal%20law%29">mistake of fact</a> on the part of Morrow, who intended to end the stunt before crossing into restricted territory, but who received no explicit indications as to where that territory began − and was indeed waved farther into it by the police. The ABC welcomed this development; Morrow commented: "I think it's just great that justice hasn't been done". The police remained unapologetic.

The DPP argued that it was never the intention of The Chaser to breach security and that they were allowed into the restricted area only because of the mistakes of the police. The laws enacted for the summit meant that entry into the restricted zone needed justification, which could include police permission. The DPP stated that by waving The Chaser through, they had granted permission to be in the restricted zone. A further defence was available: all members charged, except Morrow, could argue that they were present for work-related purposes, and part of their employment was to be with Morrow, who was directing the stunt.

With all the hype and media attention directed at this stunt, the following episode of "The Chaser's War on Everything" on 12 September 2007, initially intended to be called "The Chaser's War on APEC", was the program's highest-rating ever. In Australia there was a total of 2.981 million viewers: 2.245 million viewers in the <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20capital%20cities">capital cities</a>, and 736,000 regional viewers. This stunning success made it the most watched ABC1 television program since 2000, and broke the show's own record of 1.491 million viewers in capital cities, set by the preceding episode.

The 12 September episode was downloaded one million times from the ABC's website, and in late February 2008 it was nominated for the "<a href="Rose%20d%27Or">Rose d'Or</a>" international television award for comedy, on behalf of "The Chaser's War on Everything". The stunt depicted won the "TV moment award" at the 2008 <a href="MTV%20Australia%20Video%20Music%20Awards">MTV Australia Video Music Awards</a>, and Nine Network's show "<a href="20%20to%201">20 to 1</a> Pranks and Pranksters" ranked it first in its list of "greatest pranks in Australian history".

After the successful breach of APEC security, the comedians expressed their bewilderment at the incompetence of the security forces. Morrow and Reucassel went on radio to augment the initial reactions they had aired on the 12 September episode of "The Chaser's War on Everything". Morrow pointed out that while they did extensive planning for the stunt, the one thing they "didn't plan for was success"; the participants were confused by the unexpected permission to enter the area, and unsure how to proceed; they clearly sensed danger, but the atmosphere was actually very quiet and subdued.

Licciardello stated that they did not know they had entered the red zone, and "we had the advice of our lawyers ring in our ears; 'Do NOT go into the red zone. You can go into the green zone if they let you, but DO NOT go into the red zone.' " He said that they "were absolutely sure we would never get past the first checkpoint. It was panic stations when we realised", adding that it was a "stupid gag that backfired". Morrow said that the purpose of the stunt was "an attempt to satirise in a silly way the very heavy security and the spin surrounding that security, it was a test of the old adage that if you want to get in somewhere the best way is right through the front door. I didn't want the stunt to happen in a way that resulted in people getting arrested. If we've made a mistake and crossed into the green zone, I'm very regretful about that." He said the only reason they impersonated bin Laden was because they needed a joke to get out of the stunt that they always assumed would never have passed security.

In addition to The Chaser's major APEC security breach, the team performed stunts at the APEC Summit that received far less coverage in the media.

On 5 September 2007, <a href="Chris%20Taylor%20%28comedian%29">Chris Taylor</a>, mounted on a <a href="pantomime%20horse">pantomime horse</a>, confronted police officers, who were on foot, and asked them if they needed any reinforcements against APEC protesters. When his offer was refused, Taylor took the horse for a stroll anyway, and was met by amused onlookers and media personnel. He was later asked by police officers to remove his clothing for examination, since it resembled a police uniform; but no charges of impersonating police were laid. The reference was to the <a href="2007%20Australian%20equine%20influenza%20outbreak">horse flu outbreak</a>, which forced police officers to face APEC protesters on foot. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode.

On 7 September 2007, following the security breach on the previous day, Taylor, Reucassel, <a href="Dominic%20Knight">Dominic Knight</a> and their film crew were detained and questioned over a follow-up stunt. This incident involved running near and attempting to enter the APEC protected zone dressed in cardboard cars mounted with Canadian flags, a reference to the flags' earlier use to disguise the successful breach by the real motorcade. Police had no choice but to release all members involved in this stunt, as they were outside the prohibited area. This stunt also aired on the 12 September episode.

Shortly before 5 September 2007, Reucassel approached several APEC security personnel and offered a selection of clothing, inspired by the traditional official photograph of all the attending leaders wearing matching outfits. This stunt aired on the 5 September 2007 episode.

Shortly before 12 September 2007, as part of <a href="President%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">Chinese President</a> <a href="Hu%20Jintao">Hu Jintao</a>'s visit to Australia, Reucassel went to the Chinese Consulate and asked for them to <a href="Capital%20punishment%20in%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China%23Procedure">prepay</a> the bullets he was going to use to assassinate Hu, in reference to China's policy of requiring the family of a condemned prisoner to pay for bullets used in their relative's execution. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode.

Shortly before 5 September 2007, Licciardello, who was dressed as a police officer, performed random security checks and procedures on members of the public to demonstrate the glorification of the tough APEC security measures. These procedures included random <a href="frisking">frisking</a>, taking hair samples, telling <a href="tram">tram</a> riders in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> to stand and turn their heads, and erecting secure areas in public toilets and near escalators. When Licciardello was approached by real security officers, he said that all of these measures were "classified". This stunt aired on the 5 September 2007 episode.

On 10 September 2007, Licciardello rang a <a href="talk%20radio">talkback radio station</a> pretending to be someone else, and complained about the stunt, claiming that it was stupid and anyone involved at the ABC, including <a href="Kerry%20O%27Brien%20%28journalist%29">Kerry O'Brien</a>, should be jailed for ten years. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said he wished he had made the call on the evening of the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down.

Sometime between 6 and 12 September 2007, Licciardello and Morrow tried to enter a <a href="Returned%20and%20Services%20League%20of%20Australia">Returned and Services League</a> (RSL) building using the same fake passes that had gained them entry to the restricted area. The manager did not let them enter, which was proof, according to the team, that "RSLs are harder to get into than APEC". This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode. However, in the DVD commentary of the episode, The Chaser stated that they were actually let into many RSL buildings with the fake passes. They claimed that acting as if one is meant to be present is usually enough.

On 8 September 2007, Chaser members Taylor and <a href="Andrew%20Hansen">Andrew Hansen</a> launched a competing fireworks display to coincide with the official APEC fireworks display, which was only to be viewed by the APEC officials. The two displays were close to each other, with the official fireworks launched at the <a href="Sydney%20Harbour%20Bridge">Sydney Harbour Bridge</a>, while the rival fireworks were fired from <a href="Woolwich%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Woolwich</a>. The team lit up a large screen with the text "Screw APEC". This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode; and in the DVD commentary on the episode Morrow said the display was hard to orchestrate and not cheap.

Shortly before 5 September 2007, Reucassel, equipped with suitable costumes, went into <a href="Taronga%20Zoo">Taronga Zoo</a> and impersonated real Australian native animals, in reference to the temporary relocation of some animals for private viewing by spouses of APEC leaders. This stunt aired on the 5 September 2007 episode.

A planned stunt that was never executed was an attempt to breach the <a href="nautical">nautical</a> red zone. Morrow and Licciardello were to perform it after the motorcade stunt on 6 September 2007; but it never went ahead, since they were detained by police after the surprising success of the earlier stunt. The plan was to breach APEC nautical security in "funny" boats, such as a <a href="gondola">gondola</a>. Licciardello also stated on an episode of 'Rove Live' that there was to be an attempt to breach APEC security "by lilo."

Watching the River Flow

"Watching the River Flow" is a <a href="blues%20rock">blues rock</a> song by American singer <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>. Produced by <a href="Leon%20Russell">Leon Russell</a>, it was written and recorded during a session in March 1971 at <a href="Blue%20Rock%20Studio">Blue Rock Studio</a> in New York City. The collaboration with Russell formed in part through Dylan's desire for a new sound—after a period of immersion in <a href="country%20rock">country rock</a> music—and for a change from his previous producer. The song was praised by critics for its energy and distinctive vocals, guitar, and piano. It has been interpreted as Dylan's account of his writer's block in the early 1970s, and his wish to deliver less politically engaged material and find a new balance between public and private life.

A minor hit in some countries worldwide, the song was included on the 1971 "<a href="Bob%20Dylan%27s%20Greatest%20Hits%20Vol.%20II">Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II</a>", and other Dylan compilation albums. In 2011, five current and former <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">Rolling Stones</a> appeared on a recording of "Watching the River Flow" as part of a tribute project for pianist <a href="Ian%20Stewart%20%28musician%29">Ian Stewart</a>. The song has been covered by <a href="Earl%20Scruggs">the Earl Scruggs Revue</a>, <a href="Steve%20Gibbons%20%28musician%29">Steve Gibbons</a>, <a href="Colin%20James">Colin James</a>, Russell, and many others.

Between 1967 and 1970, Bob Dylan recorded and released a series of albums that incorporated <a href="country%20rock">country rock</a> elements. All were produced by <a href="Bob%20Johnston">Bob Johnston</a>. During the sessions for the final of these, "<a href="New%20Morning">New Morning</a>", Dylan decided that he did not want to continue working with Johnston. <a href="Al%20Kooper">Al Kooper</a> did uncredited production work to help Dylan finish the album. For his next recording session, Dylan asked Leon Russell, who made his name with <a href="Joe%20Cocker">Joe Cocker</a>, to assist in finding a new sound.

The recording session took place at Blue Rock Studio in New York City on March 16–19, 1971. Russell assembled a backing group that included <a href="Carl%20Radle">Carl Radle</a> on bass, <a href="Jesse%20Ed%20Davis">Jesse Ed Davis</a> on guitar, and <a href="Jim%20Keltner">Jim Keltner</a> on drums. <a href="Eddie%20Korvin">Eddie Korvin</a> was the <a href="Audio%20engineer">engineer</a>. On the first day in the studio, Dylan, on acoustic guitar and vocals, led the band through a rehearsal jam that included covers of "<a href="Spanish%20Harlem%20%28song%29">Spanish Harlem</a>", "<a href="That%20Lucky%20Old%20Sun">That Lucky Old Sun</a>", "I'm A Ladies Man" (<a href="Hank%20Snow">Hank Snow</a>), "Blood Red River" (<a href="Josh%20White">Josh White</a>), and "<a href="I%27m%20Alabama%20Bound">I'm Alabama Bound</a>" (<a href="Lead%20Belly">Lead Belly</a> version). On the second day, after a brief rehearsal, "Watching the River Flow" was recorded with Dylan singing live with the band. "<a href="When%20I%20Paint%20My%20Masterpiece">When I Paint My Masterpiece</a>" was recorded in similar fashion on the third day, and a mixing of both songs took place on the last day.

"Watching the River Flow" was based on studio jams done at Blue Rock, and uses a <a href="chord%20progression">chord progression</a> in the key of <a href="F%20major">F major</a>. Russell recalled that when developing the song, the basic track was formed, and that Dylan then wrote the lyrics in several minutes. Jim Keltner has also reported that Dylan wrote the songs at the Blue Rock session quickly: "I remember Bob ... had a pencil and a notepad, and he was writing a lot. He was writing these songs on the spot in the studio, or finishing them up at least."

The music of "Watching the River Flow"—whose feel the journalist <a href="Bob%20Spitz">Bob Spitz</a> has likened to Dylan's "<a href="Leopard-Skin%20Pill-Box%20Hat">Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat</a>" (1966)—has been described by different critics as a "[b]lues-powered sound [that cascades] like clumps of flotsam and jetsam", as "featur[ing] some blistering guitar work ... and rollicking piano work from Russell", and as "an energetic, funky-gospel rocker". The recording has been praised for the dynamic way in which Dylan's vocal mannerisms bounce off Russell's characteristic stride piano playing. Biographer <a href="Clinton%20Heylin">Clinton Heylin</a> has pointed out that Dylan borrowed the line "If I had wings and I could fly" from the song "<a href="The%20Water%20Is%20Wide%20%28song%29">The Water is Wide</a>" and words from "<a href="Ol%27%20Man%20River">Old Man River</a>" for his composition.

Four and a half months after the recording session, on August 1, Russell backed Dylan on bass at <a href="the%20Concert%20for%20Bangladesh">the Concert for Bangladesh</a>, organized by <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a>. In November 1971, Russell accompanied Dylan into a studio again to record Dylan's next single, "<a href="George%20Jackson%20%28song%29">George Jackson</a>". At this session, Russell once more played bass. Joe Schick, the manager of Blue Rock in 1971, has commented that although Dylan and Russell had a reasonably friendly relationship, their rapport was not strong enough to record an album together. Indeed, Heylin noted in 2009 that Russell had not recorded with Dylan again; however, they did tour together in 2011. Russell died in 2016.

The <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">b-side</a> of "Watching the River Flow" was "<a href="Spanish%20is%20the%20Loving%20Tongue">Spanish is the Loving Tongue</a>" (written by <a href="Charles%20Badger%20Clark">Charles Badger Clark</a>–Billy Simon). Dylan used the second of two takes of the song recorded during the "New Morning" sessions on June 2, 1970, in Columbia Studios in New York City. Musicians at these sessions included Bob Dylan, vocal, guitar, harmonica, and piano; Al Kooper, organ; <a href="Charlie%20Daniels">Charlie Daniels</a>, bass; <a href="David%20Bromberg">David Bromberg</a>, guitar, <a href="dobro">dobro</a>; <a href="Russ%20Kunkel">Russ Kunkel</a>, drums; <a href="Ron%20Cornelius">Ron Cornelius</a>, guitar.

The song was released as a single on June 3, 1971. In the US, <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>' promotion included a full-page "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" advertisement, declaring the track as "A unique new single by Bob Dylan." The advert contained a photograph of Dylan holding a camera to his eye.

It was a Top 40 hit in Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, and reached No. 41 on the US "Billboard" charts. "Billboard" writer Paul Grein has noted that it was the second consecutive American Dylan single, after 1970's "<a href="Wigwam%20%28Bob%20Dylan%20song%29">Wigwam</a>", to miss the Top 40 by one spot. On November 17, 1971, "Watching the River Flow" appeared on "<a href="Bob%20Dylan%27s%20Greatest%20Hits%20Vol.%20II">Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II</a>". It was later included on the compilations "Greatest Hits, Vol. 1–3" (2003), "Playlist: The Very Best of Bob Dylan '70s" (2009), and "Beyond Here Lies Nothin': The Collection" (2011).

Biographer <a href="Robert%20Shelton%20%28critic%29">Robert Shelton</a> wrote that in the early 1970s, Dylan was frequently criticized for "selling out" and that people were pressuring him to go back to his earlier trend of composing <a href="protest%20song">protest song</a>s. For Shelton, who noted the promotional photo for "Watching the River Flow" depicting Dylan looking through a camera, the track expressed Dylan's wish just to be an observer, and not a political activist. Author Seth Rogovoy similarly interpreted the song as Dylan's desire to ignore politics and avoid getting involved in people's disputes. The line "[This ol' river] keeps on rollin', though/No matter ... which way the wind does blow" has been heard by writers Peter Vernezze and Carl J. Porter as evidence of Dylan's conviction that "the river of time, the flow of facts, in reality remains unaffected by winds of beliefs, the flow of changing opinions."

<a href="Greil%20Marcus">Greil Marcus</a> highlighted the importance of disregarding one's initial reading of the song. "The first impression is that Bob Dylan is setting up the usual private scene: 'I'll sit here and watch the river flow.' Well, that's certainly a boring idea. It's the implicit message of just about everything <a href="James%20Taylor">James Taylor</a> has ever written". He went on to describe how Dylan explores the difficulty of retaining privacy while making public art; the singer is coming to terms with unwanted attention inherent in stardom, without giving up his connection to his fans. Marcus argued that the reason the single was not a hit in the US was because "the time has passed when people are interested in hearing Bob Dylan say he'll just sit there and watch the river flow ... even though that's not quite what he's saying". For Marcus, "Watching the River Flow" is a compelling work, but the subtlety of the song may have prevented it from reaching a wide audience.

Clinton Heylin and writer <a href="Christopher%20Ricks">Christopher Ricks</a> discussed Dylan's restlessness in the song. Heylin said that in "<a href="Ballad%20of%20Easy%20Rider">Ballad of Easy Rider</a>", co-written by Dylan and <a href="Roger%20McGuinn">Roger McGuinn</a> two years earlier, Dylan claimed he was content to watch while "The river flows, flows to the sea/Wherever it flows, that's where I want to be"; by contrast, in "Watching the River Flow", Dylan writes that he wants to be moving, wishing he was "back in the city/Instead of this old bank of sand". Ricks found Dylan's unsettledness at odds with the implied <a href="Pastoral">bucolic</a> notion of watching the river flow. For Ricks, the vocal phrasing and the musical arrangements clash with the lyrics; the "choppy" rhythms and "stroppy stomping" of the backing track, disrupt the theme of contentedly watching the river. He noted that two of the verses begin with "People disagreeing", introducing conflict into the song, and concluded that "Watching the River Flow" is "tarred with a realism that qualifies and complicates the lure of the lazy".

Heylin heard in the composition Dylan's admission that in 1971 he felt uninspired about writing lyrics and had no specific ideas he wanted to voice. The biographer placed this avowal in the context of changing, polarized critical estimates of Dylan's work in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In June 1970, Dylan had released "Self Portrait", an album that received very negative reviews; Dylan's next album that year, "New Morning", was viewed much more favorably by critics, and <a href="Ralph%20J.%20Gleason">Ralph Gleason</a> declared "We've got Dylan back again!" For Heylin, Dylan's assertion in the song that he does not have any particular message to express, is an attempt to subvert critics like Gleason. Heylin wrote that both "Watching the River Flow" and "When I Paint My Masterpiece" discuss Dylan's professed lack of inspiration at the time in an honest and satisfying way. Pointing to the fact that Dylan made no attempt to record either a single or an album in the following year of 1972, he commented that "Dylan had now concluded that he must simply sit by that bank of sand and await [his muse's] return."

<a href="Ian%20Bell%20%28journalist%29">Ian Bell</a>, in his critical biography of Dylan, wrote that it was "no accident" that both "Watching The River Flow" and "When I Paint My Masterpiece" made much the same statement. Bell argued that "When I Paint My Masterpiece" is the better song as it is the funnier of the two. Bell heard Dylan mocking both his admirers and his own reputation in this composition, while he detected in "Watching The River Flow" an admission that "If creativity is a habit, Dylan was all but cured."

The musicians who recorded "Watching the River Flow" are:


Dylan first performed the song live on November 21, 1978, in <a href="El%20Paso%2C%20Texas">El Paso, Texas</a>, and again, two days later, in <a href="Norman%2C%20Oklahoma">Norman, Oklahoma</a>. He did not play it in concert again until July 19, 1987, in <a href="Eugene%2C%20Oregon">Eugene, Oregon</a>; from that point on, he has often included the song in his sets. According to his official website, as of March 2019 Dylan has performed the song exactly 500 times, with the last performance being on July 15, 2014 in <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg, Sweden</a>.

On April 18, 2011, musician Ben Waters released the album "Boogie 4 Stu", a tribute to the late <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">Rolling Stones</a> pianist <a href="Ian%20Stewart%20%28musician%29">Ian Stewart</a>, including a version of "Watching the River Flow" featuring the Rolling Stones' <a href="Mick%20Jagger">Mick Jagger</a>, <a href="Keith%20Richards">Keith Richards</a>, <a href="Charlie%20Watts">Charlie Watts</a>, and <a href="Ronnie%20Wood">Ronnie Wood</a>, as well as former member <a href="Bill%20Wyman">Bill Wyman</a>. The five Rolling Stones recorded their contributions separately, in different studios at different times, but the track constituted the first time since 1992 that Wyman had recorded on the same song as his former bandmates. The choice of the song was based on Ian Stewart's judgment that "Watching the River Flow" was "the only decent thing Bob Dylan ever did".

The song has been covered by numerous artists, including <a href="Seatrain%20%28band%29">Seatrain</a> (1973), <a href="Earl%20Scruggs">the Earl Scruggs Revue</a> (1976), <a href="Steve%20Gibbons%20%28musician%29">Steve Gibbons</a> (1977), <a href="Joe%20Cocker">Joe Cocker</a> (1978), <a href="Steve%20Forbert">Steve Forbert</a> in the I-10 Chronicles (2001), <a href="Ken%20Saydak">Ken Saydak</a> (2001), <a href="Colin%20James">Colin James</a> (2005), <a href="Asylum%20Street%20Spankers">Asylum Street Spankers</a> (2006), and <a href="Steve%20Gadd">Steve Gadd</a> (2010). Leon Russell released his own version in 1999 on the compilation "<a href="Tangled%20Up%20in%20Blues">Tangled Up in Blues</a>".

Cortinarius caperatus

Cortinarius caperatus, commonly known as the gypsy mushroom, is an <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible mushroom</a> of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Cortinarius">Cortinarius</a>" found in northern regions of Europe and North America. It was known as "Rozites caperata" for many years before genetic studies revealed that it belonged to the genus "Cortinarius". The fruit bodies appear in autumn in <a href="Pinophyta">coniferous</a> and <a href="beech">beech</a> woods as well as <a href="heath">heath</a>lands in late summer and autumn. The ochre-coloured <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is up to 10 cm (4 in) across and has a fibrous surface. The clay-colored <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are attached to the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> under the cap, and the stipe is whitish with a whitish <a href="Annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a>. The <a href="Trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> has a mild smell and flavor. 

Popular with <a href="mushroom%20foragers">mushroom foragers</a>, "C. caperatus" is picked seasonally in throughout Europe. Although mild-tasting and highly regarded, the mushrooms are often infested with <a href="Maggot">maggots</a>. In central Europe, old specimens could be confused with the <a href="poisonous%20mushroom">poisonous</a> "<a href="Inocybe%20erubescens">Inocybe erubescens</a>" in summer. Fruiting bodies of "C. caperatus" have been found to <a href="bioaccumulate">bioaccumulate</a> <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> and radioactive isotopes of <a href="caesium">caesium</a>.

The gypsy mushroom was originally <a href="species%20description">described</a> as "Agaricus caperatus" in 1796 by South African mycologist <a href="Christiaan%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christiaan Hendrik Persoon</a>, who noted it grew in beech woods. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "caperatus" is Latin for "wrinkled". Bohemian naturalist <a href="Julius%20Vincenz%20von%20Krombholz">Julius Vincenz von Krombholz</a> illustrated it in his "Naturgetreue Abbildungen und Beschreibungen der essbaren, schädlichen und verdächtigen Schwämme", published between 1831 and 1846. It was transferred to the genus "<a href="Cortinarius">Cortinarius</a>" by the Swedish mycologist <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> in 1838. Later it was transferred to "<a href="Pholiota">Pholiota</a>" in 1874 by French mycologist <a href="Claude%20Casimir%20Gillet">Claude Casimir Gillet</a>, a placement followed by Italian naturalist <a href="Pier%20Andrea%20Saccardo">Pier Andrea Saccardo</a>. Finnish mycologist <a href="Petter%20Adolf%20Karsten">Petter Adolf Karsten</a> established the genus "Rozites" in 1879 to accommodate the species—as "Rozites caperatus"—on the basis of the mushroom having a double veil; that is, a <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a>—the remnants of which become a <a href="Annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> on the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>—as well as a <a href="universal%20veil">universal veil</a>. It was known as a "Rozites" species for many years. Meanwhile French mycologist <a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Quélet</a> classified "Pholiota" as a subgenus of "Dryophila" in 1886, resulting in "Dryophila caperata" being added to the species' synonymy. <a href="Worthington%20George%20Smith">Worthington George Smith</a> placed it in his new genus "Togaria" (now considered a synonym of "<a href="Agrocybe">Agrocybe</a>").

Genetic analysis in 2000 and 2002 showed that "Rozites" was not a discrete group and its members were nested within "Cortinarius". The gypsy mushroom was found closely related to the New Zealand species "<a href="Cortinarius%20meleagris">C. meleagris</a>" and "<a href="Cortinarius%20subcastanellus">C. subcastanellus</a>", both also formerly of "Rozites". Hence it has once more been placed within "Cortinarius". Within the genus it is classified in the subgenus "Cortinarius".

<a href="Common%20name">Common name</a>s include the gypsy mushroom, gypsy, and wrinkled rozites. An unusual common name is granny′s nightcap in Finland.

"C. caperatus" has a buff to brownish-ochre <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> 5–10 cm (2–4 in) diameter, which is covered with whitish fibres. The surface has a wrinkled and furrowed texture. It may have a lilac tinge when young. It is convex initially before expanding and flattening with a boss (<a href="umbo%20%28mycology%29">umbo</a>) in the centre. The stipe is 4–7 cm (1.6–2.6 in) high and 1–1.5 cm (0.4–0.6 in) thick and slightly swollen at the base, and is whitish with a whitish ring, which is initially attached to the cap. Also known as a partial veil, this is a key identifying feature of the mushroom. The clay-coloured <a href="Lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are free—they do not reach the stipe under the cap. The spores give an ochre-brown <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a>, and the warty almond-shaped spores measure 10–13 <a href="micrometre">µm</a> long by 8–9 µm wide. The <a href="context%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is cream-coloured and the flavor mild. 

Similar-looking North American species include "<a href="Agrocybe%20praecox">Agrocybe praecox</a>", which lacks the wrinkled cap and is found in cultivated areas, and "<a href="Phaeolepiota%20aurea">Phaeolepiota aurea</a>", which has powdery-granular surface. In central Europe, old specimens could be mistaken for the highly poisonous "<a href="Inocybe%20erubescens">Inocybe erubescens</a>" in summer, and young mushrooms for the inedible "<a href="Cortinarius%20traganus">Cortinarius traganus</a>", although the latter is readily distinguished by its unpleasant odour.

"C. caperatus" is found across northern Europe, mainly in Scandinavia, where it is common, although it is uncommon in Denmark and Iceland. In the British Isles it is uncommon outside the <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Scottish Highlands</a> and the <a href="New%20Forest">New Forest</a>. It has been classified as "vulnerable" in Germany and Great Britain and "endangered" in the Netherlands. "C. caperatus" had become less common in the vicinity of <a href="Salzburg">Salzburg</a> in Austria between 1937 and 1988, thought due to picking.

It is widely found in northern parts of North America, as far south as <a href="Mendocino%20County">Mendocino County</a> on the west coast. It is uncommon in California. "C. caperatus" is a rare component of <a href="subarctic">subarctic</a> areas of western Greenland. The gypsy mushroom also grows in temperate Asia, having been recorded growing with <a href="bilberry">bilberry</a> near oriental beech ("<a href="Fagus%20orientalis">Fagus orientalis</a>") and fir near <a href="Pamukova">Pamukova</a> in the <a href="Marmara%20Region">Marmara Region</a> of Turkey. It is also found in boggy areas of the <a href="taiga">taiga</a> (boreal pine forest) in western Siberia. 

Fruiting bodies sprout from August to October in <a href="conifer">conifer</a> and <a href="beech">beech</a> woods, as well as <a href="Ericaceae">heather</a> (often close by <a href="sphagnum">sphagnum</a>) in Scotland. It is <a href="mycorrhizae">mycorrhizal</a> but non-selective in its hosts. Mushrooms appear from September to November in North America, and July and August in Alaska. It prefers acidic and sandy soils and avoids <a href="Calcareous">chalky</a> ones, and may be found in the same habitats as bay bolete ("<a href="Imleria%20badia">Imleria badia</a>"), brown rollrim ("<a href="Paxillus%20involutus">Paxillus involutus</a>"), and <a href="Cantharellus">chanterelles</a>. It forms relationships with Scots pine ("<a href="Pinus%20sylvestris">Pinus sylvestris</a>"). It is often found under Sitka spruce ("<a href="Picea%20sitchensis">Picea sitchensis</a>"), or near <a href="huckleberry">huckleberry</a> in North America. In Alaska it grows with dwarf birch ("<a href="Betula%20nana">Betula nana</a>") and American dwarf birch ("<a href="Betula%20glandulosa">B. glandulosa</a>"). In Greenland, it grows in association with white birch ("<a href="Betula%20pubescens">Betula pubescens</a>").

"C. caperatus" is a highly regarded edible mushroom with a mild flavour. It is said to mix well with stronger-flavoured fungi such as chanterelles, <a href="Boletus">boletes</a>, <a href="Russula">brittlegills</a> or <a href="Lactarius">milk-caps</a>. The mushroom can have a faintly bitter taste if eaten raw, but a pleasant nutty flavour when cooked. It can readily be dried for later use, such as adding to soups and stews. It is sold commercially in Finland, and is a popular target of foragers in many parts of Europe. The mushrooms are often found to be infested with maggots when picked. Mycologist <a href="David%20Arora">David Arora</a> recommends discarding the tough stipes.

The popularity of "C. caperatus" across Europe has led to safety concerns related to its propensity to accumulate contaminants. Fungi are very efficient at absorbing radioactive <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s of <a href="caesium">caesium</a> from the soil and naturally have trace amounts of the element. Caesium may take the place of <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, which exists in high concentrations in mushrooms. "C. caperatus" <a href="Radiotrophic%20fungus">bioaccumulates</a> radioactive caesium <a href="Caesium-137">Cs</a>—a product of nuclear testing—much more than many other mushroom species. Levels dramatically rose after the 1986 <a href="Chernobyl%20disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a>. This is a potential health issue as picking and eating wild mushrooms is a popular pastime in central and eastern Europe. Elevated Cs levels were also found in <a href="ruminant">ruminant</a>s that eat mushrooms in Scandinavia in the 1990s. Mushrooms from <a href="Reggio%20Emilia">Reggio Emilia</a> in Italy were found to have raised levels of <a href="Isotopes_of_caesium%23Caesium-134">Cs</a>. "C. caperatus" from various sites across Poland has also been found to contain increased levels of <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>.

Seattle Sounders FC

Seattle Sounders FC is an American professional <a href="association%20football">soccer</a> club based in <a href="Seattle">Seattle, Washington</a>. The Sounders compete as a member of the <a href="Western%20Conference%20%28MLS%29">Western Conference</a> of <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer">Major League Soccer</a> (MLS). The club was established on November 13, 2007, and began play in 2009 as an MLS <a href="expansion%20team">expansion team</a>. The Sounders are a <a href="Phoenix%20club%20%28association%20football%29">phoenix club</a>, carrying the same name as the <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20%281974%E2%80%9383%29">original franchise</a> that competed in the <a href="North%20American%20Soccer%20League%20%281968%E2%80%9384%29">North American Soccer League</a> from 1974 to 1983.

The club's majority owner is <a href="Adrian%20Hanauer">Adrian Hanauer</a>, and its minority owners are <a href="Joe%20Roth">Joe Roth</a>, <a href="Jody%20Allen">the estate of Paul Allen</a> and <a href="Drew%20Carey">Drew Carey</a>. Former <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20%281994%E2%80%932008%29">USL Sounders</a> coach and assistant coach <a href="Brian%20Schmetzer">Brian Schmetzer</a> took over as head coach in July 2016 after the departure of <a href="Sigi%20Schmid">Sigi Schmid</a>. The Sounders play their home league matches at <a href="CenturyLink%20Field">CenturyLink Field</a>, with a reduced capacity of 41,000 seats for most matches. Along with several organized groups, a 53-member marching band called 'Sound Wave' supports the club at each home match. Seattle competes with rival MLS clubs <a href="Portland%20Timbers">Portland</a> and <a href="Vancouver%20Whitecaps%20FC">Vancouver</a> for the <a href="Cascadia%20Cup">Cascadia Cup</a>.

The Sounders played their inaugural match on March 19, 2009, winning 3–0 over the <a href="New%20York%20Red%20Bulls">New York Red Bulls</a>. Seattle has been among the league's most successful teams, winning the <a href="U.S.%20Open%20Cup">U.S. Open Cup</a> four times, the <a href="Supporters%27%20Shield">Supporters' Shield</a> in <a href="2014%20Major%20League%20Soccer%20season">2014</a>, and the <a href="MLS%20Cup">MLS Cup</a> in <a href="MLS%20Cup%202016">2016</a>. The team has qualified for the <a href="MLS%20Cup%20Playoffs">MLS Cup Playoffs</a> in each of its ten seasons and competed in the <a href="CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">CONCACAF Champions League</a> five times, advancing to the semifinal round once. The team set a new MLS record for average attendance in each of its first five seasons. The Sounders are ranked as one of the <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer%27s%20most%20valuable%20teams">most valuable franchises</a> in North America.

The team's players have included joint top goalscorers <a href="Clint%20Dempsey">Clint Dempsey</a> and <a href="Fredy%20Montero">Fredy Montero</a>, as well as long-time captain <a href="Osvaldo%20Alonso">Osvaldo Alonso</a>, and current captain <a href="Nicol%C3%A1s%20Lodeiro">Nicolás Lodeiro</a>. The Sounders also operate a players' academy and lower division teams that have produced homegrown players, including forward <a href="Jordan%20Morris">Jordan Morris</a> and current <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United F.C.</a> defender <a href="DeAndre%20Yedlin">DeAndre Yedlin</a>.

Even before the first cities in the United States were chosen to host <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer">Major League Soccer</a> teams, Seattle was considered a viable location for a professional team. In 1994, as the U.S. was preparing to host the <a href="1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">FIFA World Cup</a>, more than 30 cities were pursuing the rights to an MLS team, Seattle being among them. However, despite the strong soccer fan base in Seattle, the absence of a soccer-only stadium was a drawback to establishing an MLS team. Cities seeking consideration for an inaugural MLS team were also expected to secure 10,000 assurances from fans for season tickets. By the June 3, 1994 deadline for MLS team bids, Seattle organizers had secured fewer than 1,500 such assurances. These low numbers were a result of competition between the ticket campaign for the MLS expansion team and for the <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20%281994%E2%80%932008%29">American Professional Soccer League (APSL) Sounders</a> expansion team.

In a June 14, 1994 announcement, Seattle was not included among the first seven cities to be awarded an MLS team. Five more teams were to be announced later in the year, and to improve their chances this time, Seattle MLS organizers began working with the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> to secure use of <a href="Husky%20Stadium">Husky Stadium</a> as an interim stadium while they pursued the construction of a permanent soccer-specific facility. In November 1994, the start of the first MLS season was postponed until 1996, and it was noted that the absence of an "adequate grass-field facility" in the area and the presence of the new APSL Seattle Sounders team had thwarted Seattle's MLS bid. In the end, Seattle was not among the cities chosen to establish a team during the first season of MLS.

In 1996, as <a href="Seattle%20Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> owner <a href="Paul%20Allen">Paul Allen</a> worked with the city to build a new football stadium for his team, the potential of an MLS expansion team that could be a co-tenant helped drive public support for the effort. Many of the state's voters supported the referendum to construct Seahawks Stadium because it was also expected to be a professional soccer venue. While the stadium problem was being resolved, a new issue emerged. By 2000, MLS was moving away from league-operated teams to investor-operated teams, so wealthy individuals would need to step forward for Seattle to obtain an MLS expansion team.

In 2003, Seattle was again listed as a possibility for an MLS expansion team when the ten-team league announced plans to expand into new markets. In 2004, MLS commissioner <a href="Don%20Garber">Don Garber</a> indicated that Seattle had been "very close" to receiving the expansion team ultimately awarded to <a href="Real%20Salt%20Lake">Salt Lake</a>. <a href="Adrian%20Hanauer">Adrian Hanauer</a>, then-owner of the United Soccer League's (USL) Sounders (formerly the APSL Sounders), was in discussions with MLS about an estimated payment of $1 million to secure rights to a Seattle franchise for 2006. However, when Seattle was passed over again in 2006, Hanauer announced that he would not be able to secure an expansion team without the help of more investors willing to cover the increasing MLS franchise fees which had grown beyond $10 million.

In 2007, Hanauer teamed up with Hollywood producer <a href="Joe%20Roth">Joe Roth</a> to make another bid for MLS expansion into Seattle, at a cost of $30 million. Paul Allen, whose First and Goal company operated Qwest Field (now <a href="CenturyLink%20Field">CenturyLink Field</a>), joined the ownership group that same year, making the bid the most promising yet for Seattle. During the first week of November 2007, rumors began to build that MLS would be announcing an expansion into Seattle the following week, and that the ownership group had taken on a fourth member, TV personality <a href="Drew%20Carey">Drew Carey</a>. In a press conference on November 13, 2007, it was announced that Seattle had been awarded an expansion team. The announcement marked the return of <a href="United%20States%20soccer%20pyramid">top-level</a> soccer to Seattle for the first time since the dissolution of its <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20%28NASL%29">North American Soccer League (NASL) team</a> in 1983. The announcement also meant that the Seattle Sounders of the USL First Division would play its final season the year before the new MLS franchise was formed.

"Seattle Sounders FC" was announced as the team name on April 7, 2008, along with the team logo, colors and badge design, in a presentation held at the <a href="Space%20Needle">Space Needle</a>. <a href="Sigi%20Schmid">Sigi Schmid</a> was introduced as the club's first head coach on December 16, 2008, after leaving the <a href="Columbus%20Crew">Columbus Crew</a> following their <a href="MLS%20Cup%202008">MLS Cup victory</a>.

Seattle Sounders FC, the league's 15th team, began play in the 2009 season. All 22,000 season ticket packages offered by the club for its inaugural season were sold, giving them the most season ticket holders in MLS. The club played its first home match on March 19, 2009 in front of a sold-out crowd of 32,523, defeating the <a href="New%20York%20Red%20Bulls">New York Red Bulls</a> 3–0. During the pre-match ceremonies, the first <a href="List%20of%20Golden%20Scarf%20recipients">Golden Scarf</a> was awarded to MLS Commissioner Don Garber. Seattle was the first MLS expansion team to win its first three matches, and they did so with a <a href="Clean%20sheet">shutout</a> in each. The club set a state record for attendance at a soccer match on August 5, 2009, when 66,848 attended a <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendly match</a> with <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>, a record which was later broken when they hosted <a href="Manchester%20United">Manchester United</a> in front of 67,052 fans.

On September 2, 2009, the Sounders became the second MLS expansion team in league history (<a href="Chicago%20Fire%20S.C.">Chicago</a> was the first) to win the <a href="Lamar%20Hunt%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">U.S. Open Cup</a> tournament in its first season. They did so by defeating <a href="D.C.%20United">D.C. United</a> 2–1 on the road at <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy%20Memorial%20Stadium">RFK Stadium</a>. In winning the U.S. Open Cup tournament, they qualified for the preliminary round of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League</a>.

On October 17, 2009, the Sounders became the third MLS expansion team in league history to qualify for the playoffs in its first season. They clinched a playoff berth with a come-from-behind victory over the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Wizards">Kansas City Wizards</a> 3–2 at Kansas City. Seattle finished the regular season with a record of 12 wins, 7 losses, and 11 draws. The club set a new MLS record for average attendance with 30,943 fans per match. Its inaugural season came to an end in the <a href="2009%20MLS%20Cup%20Playoffs">2009 MLS Cup Playoffs</a> with a loss in the conference semi-finals to the <a href="Houston%20Dynamo">Houston Dynamo</a> by a 1–0 aggregate score in a <a href="Two-legged%20match">two-legged series</a>. During the 2009 season, all 15 Sounders MLS regular season home matches, its home playoff match, and its four home U.S. Open Cup matches (played at <a href="Starfire%20Sports%20Complex">Starfire Sports Complex</a>) were sold out.

Before the first match of the Sounders' <a href="2010%20Seattle%20Sounders%20FC%20season">second season</a>, the club increased the number of season ticket holders to 32,000. The first match of the season was played at CenturyLink Field, with Seattle hosting a new MLS expansion team, the <a href="Philadelphia%20Union">Philadelphia Union</a>. The Sounders won 2–0 on goals from Brad Evans and Fredy Montero. However, Seattle followed the win by losing 8 of its next 14 matches. In the latter half of the regular season, Seattle reversed its fortune. The team won 10 of its last 15 matches, and clinched a playoff berth for the second consecutive year with a 2–1 win on October 10, 2010 at Kansas City. They finished the season with 14 wins, 10 losses, and 6 ties. In the playoffs, the Sounders were eliminated in the conference semi-finals by the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Galaxy">Los Angeles Galaxy</a> on a 3–1 aggregate score. The club broke its own single-season attendance record, averaging 36,173 fans per match, and again sold out every league match.

The Sounders also competed in two additional competitions during the 2010 season – the CONCACAF Champions League and the U.S. Open Cup. In the Champions League, Seattle progressed through the preliminary round, beating <a href="A.D.%20Isidro%20Metap%C3%A1n">Isidro Metapán</a> 2–1 on aggregate, but was eliminated in the group stage. In the U.S. Open Cup, Seattle won matches at Portland and at home against the Los Angeles Galaxy and <a href="Chivas%20USA">Chivas USA</a> before reaching the final, which they hosted at CenturyLink Field against the <a href="Columbus%20Crew">Columbus Crew</a>. On October 5, 2010, Seattle won the <a href="2010%20Lamar%20Hunt%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup%20Final">U.S. Open Cup final</a>, 2–1, becoming the first team since 1983 to repeat as U.S. Open Cup champions. The final was played in front of a U.S. Open Cup record crowd of 31,311, and the victory ensured Seattle's return to the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">Champions League in 2011</a>.

The Sounders began the <a href="2011%20Seattle%20Sounders%20FC%20season">2011 season</a> by hosting the opening match of the MLS season for the third straight year, losing 1–0 to the Los Angeles Galaxy. The season also saw the entrance of the <a href="Portland%20Timbers">Portland Timbers</a> and <a href="Vancouver%20Whitecaps">Vancouver Whitecaps</a> into MLS, allowing for the revival of the <a href="Cascadia%20Cup">Cascadia Cup</a>; the Sounders won the cup with an unbeaten record against both clubs. On April 22, 2011, in a match against the <a href="Colorado%20Rapids">Colorado Rapids</a>, Seattle's star midfielder <a href="Steve%20Zakuani">Steve Zakuani</a> suffered a broken leg in a challenge by the Rapids' <a href="Brian%20Mullan">Brian Mullan</a>, which ended his season. Despite setbacks and a slow start to the season (the club won just 3 of its first 10 matches), the Sounders went on to finish the season with the second-best record in the league at 18 wins, 9 draws, 7 losses, and qualified for the playoffs for a third consecutive year. On October 4, 2011, Seattle won its <a href="2011%20Lamar%20Hunt%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup%20Final">third consecutive U.S. Open Cup</a>, becoming the first club to do so in 42 years, as they defeated the Chicago Fire 2–0 in front of another tournament record crowd of 35,615 at CenturyLink Field. In the <a href="2011%20MLS%20Cup%20Playoffs">MLS playoffs</a>, Seattle lost its Western Conference semi-final series 3–2 on aggregate to <a href="Real%20Salt%20Lake">Real Salt Lake</a>. The club lost the first leg 3–0 in Salt Lake, and could only net two goals in the second leg at home.

Sounders midfielder <a href="Mauro%20Rosales">Mauro Rosales</a> was recognized by the league as the 2011 Newcomer of the Year. In 2011, Seattle again broke its own league record for average attendance at 38,496. On October 15, 2011, the club hosted the third-largest crowd ever for a single MLS match, as 64,140 people attended the final regular season home match against the San Jose Earthquakes, billed as a sendoff for goalkeeper Kasey Keller. In the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League</a>, Seattle became only the second MLS team in history to win a competitive match in Mexico, defeating <a href="CF%20Monterrey">CF Monterrey</a> 1–0 on August 23, 2011. The club finished second in its group and advanced to the quarterfinals, losing 7–3 on aggregate to eventual runners-up <a href="Santos%20Laguna">Santos Laguna</a> after taking a 2–1 lead at home and losing 6–1 in Mexico.

Seattle opened the <a href="2012%20Seattle%20Sounders%20FC%20season">2012 season</a> with a run of five straight wins in April and May, but fell into a month-long, nine-match winless streak in June. The winless streak ended in a match on July 7, which saw the return of Steve Zakuani from rehabilitation, against the Colorado Rapids. Seattle reached the <a href="2012%20Lamar%20Hunt%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup%20Final">U.S. Open Cup Final</a> for the fourth consecutive year, becoming the first team to do so since 1937, but lost to <a href="Sporting%20Kansas%20City">Sporting Kansas City</a> in a penalty shootout after a 1–1 draw. In Champions League group play, the team advanced to the knockout round with four straight wins, each including a goal from <a href="Sammy%20Ochoa">Sammy Ochoa</a>. The Sounders finished third in the Western Conference and qualified for the playoffs, where they advanced out of the first round for the first time in the team's history. In the Conference Championship, Seattle fell 3–0 to Los Angeles in the first leg and came within one goal of tying the series on aggregate, winning the second leg 2–1 but losing 4–2 on aggregate after conceding an <a href="away%20goal">away goal</a>. The 2012 season ended without a major trophy for the Sounders, for the first time in their MLS history, and the team failed to qualify for the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">2013–14 CONCACAF Champions League</a>. The top scorer in league play was 28-year-old striker <a href="Eddie%20Johnson%20%28American%20soccer%29">Eddie Johnson</a>, who scored 14 goals in his first season with the club; he earned <a href="MLS%20Comeback%20Player%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">Comeback Player of the Year</a> honors for his performance, which came after an unsuccessful stint with multiple European clubs.

During the 2013 preseason, the Sounders signed their first <a href="Homegrown%20Player%20Rule%20%28Major%20League%20Soccer%29">homegrown player</a>, right back <a href="DeAndre%20Yedlin">DeAndre Yedlin</a>, veteran defender <a href="Djimi%20Traor%C3%A9">Djimi Traoré</a>, and forward <a href="Obafemi%20Martins">Obafemi Martins</a>, who paid his <a href="release%20clause">release clause</a> to his Spanish club. Longtime forward Fredy Montero left Seattle on loan to Colombian club <a href="Millonarios%20F.C.">Millonarios F.C.</a> in January and, by July, was loaned to <a href="Sporting%20CP">Sporting CP</a> in Portugal with an option to buy; Montero was sold permanently to Sporting in 2014. The Sounders began the <a href="2013%20Seattle%20Sounders%20FC%20season">2013 season</a> with the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League%20championship%20stage">knockout round</a> of the 2012–13 Champions League, facing Mexican club <a href="Tigres%20UANL">Tigres UANL</a> in the quarterfinals. After losing 1–0 in the away leg and conceding an <a href="away%20goal">away goal</a> in the return leg, the Sounders scored three unanswered goals in the second half to win 3–1 and advance to the semifinals. With the win, the Sounders became the first MLS team to eliminate a Mexican team in the knockout stage of CONCACAF Champions League. Seattle once again played Santos Laguna in the semifinal, but failed to advance after losing 1–0 at home and drawing 1–1 in <a href="Torre%C3%B3n">Torreón</a>. The Sounders continued their five-year streak of setting a new MLS average attendance record, reaching 44,038 in 2013.

The Sounders began the MLS season with a run of five matches without a win, the worst start in the team's history, due to injuries to key players. The Sounders failed to advance in the U.S. Open Cup after losing to second-division <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Rowdies">Tampa Bay Rowdies</a> in the third round, marking the end of the team's seven-year streak of appearances in the later rounds. As players returned to the team, Seattle improved to a six-win, four-loss record in 14 matches by late June. In August 2013, the Sounders completed the signing of <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">U.S. national team</a> captain <a href="Clint%20Dempsey">Clint Dempsey</a> from <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> for $9 million, the largest transfer deal in the league's history, and a record salary of $32 million over four years. The team's continued run of wins put them into Supporters' Shield contention in September, coming within one point of the league-leading Red Bulls, but fell to fourth place in the conference after a run of four straight losses in October. The Sounders beat the Colorado Rapids 2–0 in the knockout round, and drew rivals Portland in the conference semifinal. Seattle fell 2–1 to the Timbers in the home leg and were defeated 3–2 in Portland, knocking the Sounders out in a performance that failed to live up to expectations.

The Sounders continued to break the MLS average attendance record for the fourth and fifth consecutive year in 2012 and 2013, with an average of 43,144 and 44,038, respectively. The higher attendances were helped by the opening of additional sections in the Hawks' Nest, as well as the opening of the upper deck of CenturyLink Field for select regular matches. The August 25, 2013, home match against the Portland Timbers drew a crowd of 67,385, the second-largest standalone attendance in league history.

After a disappointing 2013 season, the Sounders replaced starting goalkeeper Michael Gspurning with Toronto's <a href="Stefan%20Frei">Stefan Frei</a>. Several veteran players, including Eddie Johnson, Patrick Ianni, Jhon Kennedy Hurtado, Mauro Rosales, and Steve Zakuani, left the club as part of a major restructure; <a href="Brad%20Evans">Brad Evans</a> was named as club captain. <a href="Marco%20Pappa">Marco Pappa</a>, an experienced MLS player and Guatemalan international, was added to the team. Homegrown player <a href="DeAndre%20Yedlin">DeAndre Yedlin</a> was transferred to <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a> but was loaned back to Seattle until the end of the MLS season.

The Sounders advanced to the <a href="2014%20Lamar%20Hunt%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup%20Final">2014 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final</a> and defeated the <a href="Philadelphia%20Union">Philadelphia Union</a> in <a href="extra%20time">extra time</a>, to win their fourth trophy of the tournament. On October 25, 2014, the final game of the 2014 regular season, the Sounders defeated the LA Galaxy 2–0 to secure and win their first <a href="Supporters%27%20Shield">Supporters' Shield</a>.

Entering the playoffs as the top seed, Seattle defeated FC Dallas on the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a> and advanced to the Western Conference Championship to face the LA Galaxy once again. The Sounders tied the Galaxy on <a href="aggregate%20score">aggregate score</a> but lost on the away goals rule after losing 1–0 away and winning 2–1 at home. LA would go on to win the MLS Cup.

Former <a href="Real%20Salt%20Lake">Real Salt Lake</a> general manager <a href="Garth%20Lagerwey">Garth Lagerwey</a> was hired by the club in January 2015, replacing Adrian Hanauer.

Seattle was unable to repeat their successes in the 2014 season. The season started successfully, with several key wins that saw the team at the top of the Western Conference by June. During a <a href="2015%20Lamar%20Hunt%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">2015 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup</a> match against the Portland Timbers on June 16, however, Obafemi Martins left the game with a groin injury and Clint Dempsey was suspended after tearing a referee's pocketbook, though he would be called away for the <a href="2015%20CONCACAF%20Gold%20Cup">2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup</a>.

The injury and suspension of the team's main attacking duo led to a death spiral during the summer, with Seattle winning only one match in nine games. By late August, Martins had recovered and led the team to an 8-match unbeaten streak to secure a playoff spot, finishing fourth in the Western Conference. The Sounders had also successfully topped their group in the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">2015–16 CONCACAF Champions League</a>, beating the Vancouver Whitecaps and <a href="Club%20Deportivo%20Olimpia">Club Deportivo Olimpia</a>, with two wins, one draw, and one loss. <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>an international <a href="Nelson%20Haedo%20Valdez">Nelson Haedo Valdez</a> was signed as the club's newest <a href="Designated%20Player%20Rule">designated player</a>, and was joined by fellow international signings <a href="Andreas%20Ivanschitz">Andreas Ivanschitz</a> and <a href="Rom%C3%A1n%20Torres">Román Torres</a> in August 2015; <a href="Erik%20Friberg%20%28footballer%29">Erik Friberg</a> also returned to the club after his stint in Europe.

During the playoff's opening knockout round, the Sounders defeated the LA Galaxy 3–2, ending a "curse" for the club, who had lost to LA in each of the three previous playoff matchups. The playoff run would end in the next round, the Western Conference semi-finals against FC Dallas, during a <a href="penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shootout</a> after both teams were tied on <a href="aggregate%20score">aggregate score</a> after <a href="extra%20time">extra time</a> in Frisco, Texas.

In November 2015, Adrian Hanauer was made majority owner of the club, succeeding Joe Roth. The club set a new attendance record during the 2015 season, with an average attendance of 44,247.

Prior to the 2016 season, Obafemi Martins abruptly left the club to sign with <a href="Shanghai%20Greenland%20Shenhua%20F.C.">Shanghai Greenland Shenhua F.C.</a> in the <a href="Chinese%20Super%20League">Chinese Super League</a>, a move that would hamper the Sounders' offense during the season. The move was mitigated somewhat by the signing of homegrown product <a href="Jordan%20Morris%20%28soccer%29">Jordan Morris</a>. GM Lagerwey also traded <a href="Marco%20Pappa">Marco Pappa</a> and <a href="Lamar%20Neagle">Lamar Neagle</a> to other clubs in the offseason.

During the first half of the 2016 season, the Sounders failed to meet expectations, placing near the bottom of the league with 6 wins, 12 losses, and 2 draws. Following a 3–0 loss on July 24 to Sporting Kansas City, in which the Sounders had only one shot, Schmid left the club on mutual terms and was replaced by long-time assistant coach <a href="Brian%20Schmetzer">Brian Schmetzer</a>. The same day, the club announced their signing of Uruguayan midfielder <a href="Nicol%C3%A1s%20Lodeiro">Nicolás Lodeiro</a> on a designated player contract, as well as the return of former designated player <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">Álvaro Fernández</a>. Despite the sluggish start as well as the loss of midfielder <a href="Clint%20Dempsey">Clint Dempsey</a>, who was forced in August to stop playing after evaluations for an irregular heartbeat, the Sounders rose from ninth place to fourth place in the Western Conference and qualified for the <a href="2016%20MLS%20Cup%20Playoffs">2016 MLS Cup Playoffs</a>, with eight wins, two losses, and four draws. Schmetzer was named as permanent head coach as a result.

At the end of the regular season, Jordan Morris was named the <a href="MLS%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year">MLS Rookie of the Year</a> after scoring the most goals of any American rookie in MLS (12), and Nicolás Lodeiro was named <a href="MLS%20Newcomer%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">MLS Newcomer of the Year</a> for his 4 goals and 8 assists in 13 appearances. The Sounders advanced from the Knockout Round of the playoffs through a 1–0 win over <a href="Sporting%20Kansas%20City">Sporting Kansas City</a>, and beat <a href="FC%20Dallas">FC Dallas</a> 4–2 on aggregate to return to the Conference Final. The Sounders then defeated the <a href="Colorado%20Rapids">Colorado Rapids</a> 3–1 on aggregate in the final, clinching a spot in their first-ever MLS Cup. On December 10, 2016, the Sounders defeated <a href="Toronto%20FC">Toronto FC</a> 5–4 in a <a href="penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shootout</a>, to win <a href="MLS%20Cup%202016">MLS Cup 2016</a>, their first MLS championship in franchise history, going the whole match without a shot on goal. The team's performance was called a "<a href="cinderella%20%28sports%29">cinderella season</a>" and hailed as one of the most dramatic MLS seasons to date.

The Sounders began their title defense with the signings of two academy graduates and several veteran players from MLS and abroad. Dempsey also returned from his hiatus and scored in his first match before being called up to the U.S. national team for World Cup qualification. The season began with only five wins in the first 17 matches, but was followed by a 13-match unbeaten streak and additional wins to clinch a second-place spot in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, the Sounders beat the Vancouver Whitecaps and Houston Dynamo to win the Western Conference and return to the <a href="MLS%20Cup%202017">MLS Cup</a>, once again facing Toronto at BMO Field. Seattle lost 2–0 to Toronto, who clinched the first domestic <a href="treble%20%28association%20football%29">treble</a> in MLS history.

Seattle began the 2018 season with a run to the quarterfinals of the CONCACAF Champions League, where they lost 3–1 on aggregate to eventual champions <a href="C.D.%20Guadalajara">C.D. Guadalajara</a>. During the Round of 16, Jordan Morris injured his <a href="Anterior%20cruciate%20ligament">ACL</a> and was deemed unfit to play for the rest of the season. Without Morris and several injured starting players, the Sounders lost nine of their first 15 matches and were placed bottom of the Western Conference by June. The club signed a new Designated Player, Peruvian forward <a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20Ruid%C3%ADaz">Raúl Ruidíaz</a>, that month and began a long unbeaten streak that resulted in a playoff position in late August.

On September 1, the club broke the MLS record for most consecutive wins in the post-shootout era, having won eight consecutive matches. They then extended that win streak to nine games as they beat Vancouver 2–1 on September 15, before eventually losing to the Philadelphia Union on September 19. The Sounders finished second in the Western Conference with 18 wins, 11 losses, and 5 draws. With 14 wins in the final 16 matches of the season, the Sounders completed the best half season in league history. Minority owner Paul Allen died from complications related to <a href="non-Hodgkin%20lymphoma">non-Hodgkin lymphoma</a> on October 15, 2018, leaving his stake in the Sounders to an estate executed by his sister <a href="Jody%20Allen">Jody Allen</a>, with no long term plan announced . Seattle then faced the Portland Timbers in the Conference Semifinals, losing the away leg 2–1 and winning the home leg 3–2 to tie the series on aggregate after extra time. In the ensuing penalty shootout, Portland won 4–2; the home leg is considered to be one of the best playoff matches in league history due to its dramatic finish.

The badge design resembles a <a href="Escutcheon%20%28heraldry%29">heraldic shield</a>, and consists of two layers which represent "the partnership between the ownership, the community, the players and the fans". The logo incorporates the <a href="Space%20Needle">Space Needle</a>, an internationally recognized Seattle landmark. The official team colors are Sounder Blue, signifying the waters of the <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a>; Rave Green, representing the forests of the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>; and Cascade Shale, representing the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a> to the east of Seattle. Fans chose a name for the team in an online poll held between March 27 and 31, 2008. The initial list of possibilities – Seattle FC, Seattle Republic and Seattle Alliance – deliberately did not include Seattle Sounders in order to provide a fresh start. Despite the names having been selected through fan research and internal committees, the omission of the traditional Sounders name embittered many in the Seattle community. In response to the backlash, the team added a fourth <a href="Write-in%20candidate">write-in</a> option for the team name, allowing for any name to be suggested on the ballot. Of the more than 14,500 votes received in choosing the new team name, 49% of the votes included some form of the name "Sounders". Upon announcing the name of the club, Hanauer acknowledged the significance of keeping with tradition: "The team playing at the highest level in our region has always been called Sounders. Starting with the NASL and then the USL 1st Division, we now have the chance to create a separate and distinct identity with the new MLS team." (The naming of the original <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20%28NASL%29">Seattle Sounders (NASL)</a> team was, in fact, as the result of a contest to name the team in 1974, in which the top three picks were Sounders, Seahawks and Mariners, in that order.)

The team's ownership revealed the first Sounders jersey on May 28, 2008, and announced <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> as the team's sponsor in a five-year deal worth approximately $20 million. As part of the agreement, <a href="Xbox">Xbox</a> branding appeared on the front of the Sounders' jerseys and throughout the stadium, beginning with the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> and <a href="Xbox%20Live">Xbox Live</a> and later replaced with the <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> (simply shown as "XBOX"). Despite hiring a consultant to explore other jersey partnerships in 2012, the Microsoft sponsorship was repeatedly extended with a one-year contract in 2013, for the following season, and 2014, lasting through the end of the 2016 season. The second extension came amid rumors that <a href="Emirates%20%28airline%29">Emirates</a> was interested in a sponsorship as part of their marketing campaign in Seattle. The jersey has been modified several times to include promotions for Xbox games, including <a href="Halo%205">Halo 5</a> and <a href="Gears%20of%20War%204">Gears of War 4</a>.

The Sounders contracted talent firm <a href="William%20Morris%20Endeavor">WME-IMG</a> to explore new jersey sponsorship and other advertising opportunities in 2017, shortly before the expiration of the Microsoft contract. On January 17, 2019, the team announced that Seattle-based online retailer <a href="Zulily">Zulily</a> would become the jersey sponsor in a multiyear jersey deal at an undisclosed fee. Zulily also took over sponsorship of the NWSL's <a href="Seattle%20Reign">Seattle Reign</a>, but naming rights to the pitch at CenturyLink Field was not part of the contract.

Seattle Sounders FC plays home matches at CenturyLink Field in Seattle, also home to the <a href="Seattle%20Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a>. Sounders minority owner Paul Allen is also the owner of the Seahawks, who have a 30-year lease on CenturyLink Field. Because of this relationship, the Sounders makes use of CenturyLink Field without paying rent. For Sounders matches, the <a href="Association%20football%20pitch">field</a> is called "The Xbox Pitch at CenturyLink Field" as part of the sponsorship deal with Microsoft.

CenturyLink Field is a 69,000-seat stadium designed for both teams. The Sounders artificially limit the stadium's capacity for MLS matches, with certain seating sections covered with tarpaulins to provide "a more intimate atmosphere". However, the club does open the entire stadium for international friendly matches and some league matches. The team's original business plan expected only 12,000 tickets per game. Based on high initial demand, capacity for the stadium was limited to 24,500 for the beginning of the inaugural 2009 season. However, owing to continued high demand, capacity has been increased multiple times, to 38,500 for the 2012 season and to 39,115 for 2015 season. On October 7, 2012, a record was established when a crowd of 66,452 attended a Sounders 3–0 win over the rival Portland Timbers: the second-highest to-date in MLS. The Sounders then beat their own record on August 25, 2013 again against the Timbers with 67,385 in attendance for Clint Dempsey's home debut, a 1–0 win for the Sounders.

While the Sounders currently play on <a href="FieldTurf">FieldTurf</a>, CenturyLink Field has previously had temporary natural grass installed for international soccer events. In 2012, an updated FieldTurf surface was installed and certified by FIFA with a 2-star quality rating, the highest possible rating. If an MLS rule change requires natural grass playing surfaces, the field will be permanently replaced with natural grass.

The team's training facilities and offices are located at the <a href="Starfire%20Sports%20Complex">Starfire Sports Complex</a> in nearby <a href="Tukwila%2C%20Washington">Tukwila</a>. Smaller than CenturyLink Field, Starfire is also used to host U.S. Open Cup matches. Sounders representatives have said they prefer the more intimate atmosphere for smaller cup matches.
The Sounders FC Alliance was established at the request of minority owner <a href="Drew%20Carey">Drew Carey</a>. Based on the fan association at FC Barcelona, members of the Alliance have the ability to vote on the removal of the general manager and on other team decisions. Season ticket holders become automatic members, while non-season ticket holders may buy into the Alliance for a fee. Membership benefits include voting privileges, an invitation to the annual meeting and other team perks. Members may also be elected to the Sounders FC Alliance Council by receiving at least 25 nominations from other members on an annual basis. The first vote on retaining or replacing Sounders general manager Adrian Hanauer was scheduled to be held between October to December 2012. After 13,775 votes registered, Hanauer was retained by the Alliance. Drew Carey is the chairman of the Sounders FC Alliance.

Carey also requested that the Sounders have their own marching band, the first of its kind in MLS. This led to the creation of the Sound Wave, a 53-member marching band consisting of brass and marching percussion. The band plays music from multiple genres, such as Latin, rock and pop, and sits on the north end of CenturyLink Field. The March to the Match, in which fans march from <a href="Occidental%20Park%20%28Seattle%29">Occidental Park</a> to CenturyLink Field before each home match, has been accompanied by the Sound Wave.

Besides the Alliance, there are currently four recognized, independent <a href="supporters%20groups">supporters groups</a> for the Sounders. <a href="Emerald%20City%20Supporters">Emerald City Supporters</a> (ECS), which formed in 2005 to support the USL Sounders, is the largest supporter group and sits in the south end of the stadium in sections 121–123. "Eastside Supporters" is a group which can be found in section 150 which they call "The Pod". <a href="Gorilla%20FC">Gorilla FC</a> is a Sounders supporters group that sits in the south end of CenturyLink Field in Sections 119 and 120. "The North End Faithful" sit in the north end of the stadium beneath the "Hawks Nest" in sections 100 and 144–152.

The <a href="Portland%20Timbers%E2%80%93Seattle%20Sounders%20rivalry">Seattle–Portland</a> and Seattle–Vancouver rivalries formed in the mid-seventies in the NASL and carried on through to the USL and MLS. In 2004, the fan-based <a href="Cascadia%20Cup">Cascadia Cup</a> was created to formalize the competition between the Seattle, <a href="Portland%20Timbers%20%282001%E2%80%932010%29">Portland</a>, and <a href="Vancouver%20Whitecaps%20%281986%E2%80%932010%29">Vancouver</a> USL teams. The trophy is exchanged by the three teams' supporters groups and is based on the results of certain regular season matches. The Cascadia Cup was contested without Seattle for two seasons after the Sounders entered MLS in 2009, but Portland and Vancouver were awarded expansion teams that began play in 2011.

The fan-created <a href="Heritage%20Cup%20%28MLS%29">Heritage Cup</a> competition with the <a href="San%20Jose%20Earthquakes">San Jose Earthquakes</a> began in the 2009 MLS season. MLS teams that carry on the names of their NASL predecessors are eligible to compete. The results of their league matches determine the winner.

Although there is no official rivalry between the Sounders and <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Galaxy">Los Angeles Galaxy</a>, the two teams have met several times in the MLS Cup Playoffs. The relationship between former head coaches <a href="Bruce%20Arena">Bruce Arena</a> and Sigi Schmid, the two most successful in league history, also played a factor in the clubs' rivalry. Schmid later served as the Galaxy's head coach from 2017 to 2018, shortly after his departure from the Sounders.

The ownership group of the club is composed of four investors. The majority owner is the former owner of the now defunct USL-1 team Seattle Sounders <a href="Adrian%20Hanauer">Adrian Hanauer</a>, with minority owners <a href="Joe%20Roth">Joe Roth</a>, a Hollywood producer; the estate of <a href="Paul%20Allen">Paul Allen</a>, Microsoft co-founder and owner of the Seattle Seahawks and Portland Trail Blazers; and <a href="Drew%20Carey">Drew Carey</a>, comedian and game show host. Roth was the majority owner from 2007 to 2015, when he ceded the role to Hanauer, who had been replaced as general manager earlier that year. Allen's partnership allowed for the team to share certain resources with the Seahawks, including over half of the team's full-time staff, with merged ticket, marketing, and financial operations. This arrangement ended on April 30, 2014, with the Sounders becoming a fully independent business operation.

<a href="Brian%20Schmetzer">Brian Schmetzer</a> is the Sounders' current head coach. He was promoted to interim head coach from his role as assistant coach after <a href="Sigi%20Schmid">Sigi Schmid</a> parted ways with the club on mutual terms in July 2016. Schmetzer was made permanent head coach in November 2016, following the team's qualification for that year's playoffs. The club's assistant coaches are <a href="Ante%20Razov">Ante Razov</a>, a retired MLS player, and <a href="Djimi%20Traor%C3%A9">Djimi Traoré</a>, a retired Sounders player who played for <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool F.C.</a> Tom Dutra was hired in 2008 as the club's goalkeeper coach.

<a href="Garth%20Lagerwey">Garth Lagerwey</a> was hired from <a href="Real%20Salt%20Lake">Real Salt Lake</a> in January 2015 as the club's <a href="general%20manager">general manager</a> and President of Soccer, replacing Adrian Hanauer. Former MLS player and <a href="Everett%2C%20Washington">Everett, Washington</a> native <a href="Chris%20Henderson">Chris Henderson</a> was named technical director on January 24, 2009. Former Sounders defender <a href="Taylor%20Graham">Taylor Graham</a> was hired as the club's Vice President of Business Operations in 2012, replacing longtime Seattle Seahawks executive Gary Wright.

SportsBusiness Journal and SportsBusiness Daily recognized Seattle Sounders FC as the Professional Sports Team of the Year in 2009 because of the team's record-setting success in attendance, as well as making the playoffs in its inaugural season. Former Seahawks and Sounders CEO Tod Leiweke was recognized by the Puget Sound Business Journal as the newspaper's 2009 Executive of the Year. Gary Wright was named MLS Executive of the Year in 2009. In 2012, he was named Seattle Sports Star Executive of the Year.

A 2015 study by <a href="Forbes">Forbes</a> ranked the Sounders number one in the league in terms of annual revenues ($50 million) and operating income ($10 million). Consequently, the Sounders were also ranked as the most valuable franchise ($245 million) in MLS – a 717% increase over the expansion fee it paid to join the league. The Sounders financial success is driven in large part by their high attendance figures.

The Sounders organization announced in 2014 that it would field a second-division <a href="reserve%20team">reserve team</a> in the <a href="United%20Soccer%20League">United Soccer League</a>, managed by the team and partially owned by members of a fan-owned group. The team, initially named <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20FC%202">Seattle Sounders FC 2</a> (S2), began play at the <a href="Starfire%20Sports%20Complex">Starfire Sports Complex</a> in 2015, under the management of former assistant coach <a href="Ezra%20Hendrickson">Ezra Hendrickson</a>. In 2017, the Sounders announced that the team would move to <a href="Cheney%20Stadium">Cheney Stadium</a> in <a href="Tacoma%2C%20Washington">Tacoma</a>, with business operations transferred to the <a href="Tacoma%20Rainiers">Tacoma Rainiers</a> baseball club, ahead of a planned rebrand and <a href="soccer-specific%20stadium">soccer-specific stadium</a> to be built in 2020. The team became known as the <a href="Tacoma%20Defiance">Tacoma Defiance</a> ahead of the <a href="2019%20USL%20Championship%20season">2019 season</a>.

The Sounders were also affiliated with an amateur women's team, <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20Women">Seattle Sounders Women</a>, that plays at Starfire Sports Complex. A separate, professional women's team, <a href="Reign%20FC">Seattle Reign FC</a>, began play in 2013 in the current top level of U.S. women's soccer, the <a href="National%20Women%27s%20Soccer%20League">National Women's Soccer League</a> (NWSL). The team was rebranded as Reign FC and relocated to Tacoma in 2019, also gaining partial ownership from Adrian Hanauer and his family.

The Sounders established their affiliated <a href="youth%20system">academy team</a> in 2010, and hired manager <a href="Dick%20McCormick">Dick McCormick</a> and technical director <a href="Darren%20Sawatzky">Darren Sawatzky</a> to develop local players. The academy fields teams in four age levels in the <a href="U.S.%20Soccer%20Development%20Academy">U.S. Soccer Development Academy</a> system, and is affiliated with youth clubs in Washington, North Carolina, and Central California. Several academy products have been signed by the Sounders under the MLS <a href="Homegrown%20Player%20Rule%20%28Major%20League%20Soccer%29">Homegrown Player Rule</a>, including <a href="DeAndre%20Yedlin">DeAndre Yedlin</a>, <a href="Sean%20Okoli">Sean Okoli</a>, <a href="Jordan%20Morris">Jordan Morris</a>, and <a href="Henry%20Wingo">Henry Wingo</a>.

In January 2012, the Sounders announced a partnership with the Tacoma Tide, an amateur team in the <a href="USL%20Premier%20Development%20League">USL Premier Development League</a>, to rebrand as <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20FC%20U-23">Seattle Sounders FC U-23</a> and appoint Sawatzky as head coach. The U-23 team fields academy players signed from their university teams, as part of the player development system.

Sonatas and Interludes

Sonatas and Interludes is a cycle of twenty pieces for <a href="prepared%20piano">prepared piano</a> by American <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> <a href="composer">composer</a> <a href="John%20Cage">John Cage</a> (1912–1992). It was composed in 1946–48, shortly after Cage's introduction to <a href="Indian%20philosophy">Indian philosophy</a> and the teachings of art historian <a href="Ananda%20Coomaraswamy">Ananda K. Coomaraswamy</a>, both of which became major influences on the composer's later work. Significantly more complex than his other works for prepared piano, "Sonatas and Interludes" is generally recognized as one of Cage's finest achievements.

The cycle consists of sixteen sonatas (thirteen of which are cast in <a href="binary%20form">binary form</a>, the remaining three in ternary form) and four more freely structured interludes. The aim of the pieces is to express the eight permanent emotions of the <a href="Rasa%20%28aesthetics%29">rasa</a> Indian tradition. In "Sonatas and Interludes", Cage elevated his technique of rhythmic proportions to a new level of complexity. In each sonata a short sequence of natural numbers and fractions defines the structure of the work and that of its parts, informing structures as localized as individual melodic lines.

Cage underwent an artistic crisis in the early 1940s. His compositions were rarely accepted by the public, and he grew more and more disillusioned with the idea of art as communication. He later gave an account of the reasons: "Frequently I misunderstood what another composer was saying simply because I had little understanding of his language. And I found other people misunderstanding what I myself was saying when I was saying something pointed and direct". At the beginning of 1946, Cage met Gita Sarabhai, an Indian musician who came to the United States concerned about Western influence on the music of her country. Sarabhai wanted to spend several months in the US, studying Western music. She took lessons in <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a> and contemporary music with Cage, who offered to teach her for free if she taught him about <a href="Music%20of%20India">Indian music</a> in return. Sarabhai agreed and through her Cage became acquainted with Indian music and philosophy. The purpose of music, according to Sarabhai's teacher in India, was "to sober and quiet the mind, thus rendering it susceptible to divine influences", and this definition became one of the cornerstones of Cage's view on music and art in general.

At around the same time, Cage began studying the writings of the Indian art historian <a href="Ananda%20Coomaraswamy">Ananda K. Coomaraswamy</a>. Among the ideas that influenced Cage was the description of the <a href="Rasa%20%28aesthetics%29">rasa</a> aesthetic and of its eight "permanent emotions". These emotions are divided into two groups: four white (humor, wonder, erotic, and heroic—"accepting one's experience", in Cage's words) and four black (anger, fear, disgust, and sorrow). They are the first eight of the "<a href="Navras">navarasas</a>" or "navrasas" ("nine emotions"), and they have a common tendency towards the ninth of the "navarasas": tranquility. Cage never specified which of the pieces relate to which emotions, or whether there even exists such direct correspondence between them. He mentioned, though, that the "pieces with bell-like sounds suggest Europe and others with a drum-like resonance suggest the East". (A short excerpt from Sonata II, which is clearly inspired by Eastern music: .) Cage also stated that Sonata XVI, the last of the cycle (), is "clearly European. It was the signature of a composer from the West."
Cage started working on the cycle in February 1946, while living in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. The idea of a collection of short pieces was apparently prompted by the poet <a href="Edwin%20Denby%20%28poet%29">Edwin Denby</a>, who had remarked that short pieces "can have in them just as much as long pieces can". The choice of materials and the technique of piano preparation in "Sonatas and Interludes" were largely dependent on improvisation: Cage later wrote that the cycle was composed "by playing the piano, listening to differences [and] making a choice". On several accounts he offered a poetic metaphor for this process, comparing it with collecting shells while walking along a beach. Work on the project was interrupted in early 1947, when Cage made a break to compose "<a href="The%20Seasons%20%28Cage%29">The Seasons</a>", a ballet in one act also inspired by ideas from Indian philosophy. Immediately after "The Seasons" Cage returned to "Sonatas and Interludes", and by March 1948 it was completed.

Cage dedicated "Sonatas and Interludes" to <a href="Maro%20Ajemian">Maro Ajemian</a>, a pianist and friend. Ajemian performed the work many times since 1949, including one of the first performances of the complete cycle on January 12, 1949, in <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a>. On many other occasions in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Cage performed it himself. Critical reaction was uneven, but mostly positive, and the success of "Sonatas and Interludes" led to a grant from the <a href="John%20Simon%20Guggenheim%20Memorial%20Foundation">Guggenheim Foundation</a>, which Cage received in 1949, allowing him to make a six-month trip to Europe. There he met <a href="Olivier%20Messiaen">Olivier Messiaen</a>, who helped organize a performance of the work for his students in Paris on June 7, 1949; and he befriended <a href="Pierre%20Boulez">Pierre Boulez</a>, who became an early admirer of the work and wrote a lecture about it for the June 17, 1949 performance at the salon of Suzanne Tézenas in Paris. While still living in Paris, Cage began writing "<a href="String%20Quartet%20in%20Four%20Parts">String Quartet in Four Parts</a>", yet another work influenced by Indian philosophy.

In the text accompanying the first recording of "Sonatas and Interludes", Cage specifically stated that the use of preparations is not a criticism of the instrument, but a simple practical measure. Cage started composing for <a href="prepared%20piano">prepared piano</a> in 1940, when he wrote a piece called "Bacchanale" for a dance by <a href="Syvilla%20Fort">Syvilla Fort</a>, and by 1946 had already composed a large number of works for the instrument. However, in "Sonatas and Interludes" the preparation is very complex, more so than in any of the earlier pieces. Forty-five notes are prepared, mostly using screws and various types of bolts, but also with fifteen pieces of rubber, four pieces of plastic, several <a href="Nut%20%28hardware%29">nuts</a> and one eraser. It takes about two or three hours to prepare a piano for performance. Despite the detailed instructions, any preparation is bound to be different from any other, and Cage himself suggested that there is no strict plan to adhere to: "if you enjoy playing the "Sonatas and Interludes" then do it so that it seems right to you".

For the most part Cage avoids using lower registers of the piano, and much of the music's melodic foreground lies in the <a href="soprano">soprano</a> range. Of the forty-five prepared notes, only three belong to the three lowest octaves below F#3: D3, D2 and D1. Furthermore, D2 is prepared in such a way that the resulting sound has the frequency of a D4 (resulting in two variants of D4 available, one more prepared than the other). The portion of the keyboard above F#3 is divided into roughly three registers: low, middle, and high. The low register has the heaviest preparation, and the high register the lightest. Different methods are used: certain notes produce sounds that retain the original <a href="Audio%20frequency">frequency</a> and a pianistic character; others become drum-like sounds, detuned versions of the original notes, or metallic, rattling sounds that have no sense of the <a href="fundamental%20frequency">fundamental frequency</a> at all. The use of the <a href="soft%20pedal">soft pedal</a>, which makes the hammers strike only two of the three strings of each note (or one, for notes with only two strings), complicates the matter further. For example, the note C5 is a metallic sound with no fundamental discernible when the soft pedal is depressed, but it sounds fairly normal if the pedal is released. It appears that Cage was fully aware of the implications of this: certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of one note, others place special emphasis on particular notes, and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations.

The cycle comprises sixteen sonatas and four interludes, arranged symmetrically. Four groups of four sonatas each are separated by interludes in the following way: 
Cage refers to his pieces as <a href="sonata">sonata</a> in the sense that these works are cast in the form that early classical keyboard sonatas (such as those of <a href="Domenico%20Scarlatti">Scarlatti</a>) were: AABB. The works are not cast in the later <a href="sonata%20form">sonata form</a> which is far more elaborate. The only exceptions are sonatas IX–XI, which feature three sections: prelude, interlude, and postlude. Sonatas XIV–XV follow the AABB scheme but are paired and given the joint title "Gemini—after the work of Richard Lippold", referring to a sculpture by <a href="Richard%20Lippold">Lippold</a>. The interludes, on the other hand, do not have a unifying scheme. The first two are free-form movements, whereas interludes 3 and 4 have a four-section structure with repeats for each section.

The main technique Cage used for composition is that of nested proportions: an arbitrary sequence of numbers defines the structure of a piece on both the macroscopic and the microscopic level, so that the larger parts of each piece are in the same relation to the whole as the smaller parts are to a single unit of it. For instance, the proportion for Sonata III is 1, 1, 3¼, 3¼ (in <a href="whole%20note">whole note</a>s), and a unit here is equal to 8½ <a href="Bar%20%28music%29">bars</a> (the end of a unit is marked with a double <a href="bar%20%28music%29">barline</a> in the score, unless it coincides with the end of a section). The structure of this sonata is AABB. Section A consists of a single unit, composed according to the given proportion: correlation on the microscopic level. A is repeated, and AA forms the first part of the proportion on the macroscopic level: 1, 1. B consists of three units and an appendix of ¼ of a unit. B is also repeated, and BB gives the second half of the proportion: 3¼, 3¼. Therefore, AABB has proportions 1, 1, 3¼, 3¼: correlation on the macroscopic level. The musical phrases within each unit are also governed by the same proportion. See "Example 2" for a graph of the structure of Sonata III.

The proportions were chosen arbitrarily in all but the last four pieces in the cycle: sonatas XIII and XVI use symmetrical proportions, and sonatas XIV and XV share the 2, 2, 3, 3 proportion. This symmetry, and the adherence of all four sonatas to the ten-bar unit, were explained by Cage as an expression of tranquility. The complexity of proportions prompted Cage to use asymmetric musical phrases and somewhat frequent changes of <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a> to achieve both microscopic and macroscopic correlation. For example, unit length of 8½ in the first section of Sonata III is achieved by using six bars in 2/2 time and two in 5/4 (rather than eight bars in 2/2 and one in 1/2). In many sonatas the microstructure—how the melodic lines are constructed—deviates slightly from the pre-defined proportion.

Cage had frequently used the nested proportions technique and its variations before, most notably in "<a href="Construction%20%28Cage%29">First Construction (in Metal)</a>" (1939), which was the first piece to use it, and numerous <a href="Works%20for%20prepared%20piano%20by%20John%20Cage">dance-related works for prepared piano</a>. In "Sonatas and Interludes", however, the proportions are more complex, partly because fractions are used. In his 1949 lecture on "Sonatas and Interludes" <a href="Pierre%20Boulez">Pierre Boulez</a> specifically emphasized the connection between tradition and innovation in "Sonatas and Interludes": "The structure of these sonatas brings together a pre-Classical structure and a rhythmic structure which belong to two entirely different worlds."

Francis Harvey

<a href="Major%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Major</a> Francis John William Harvey, <a href="Victoria%20Cross">VC</a> (29 April 1873 – 31 May 1916) was an officer of the British <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marine Light Infantry</a> during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. Harvey was posthumously awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, the highest military award for gallantry in the face of the enemy given to British and Commonwealth forces, for his actions at the height of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a>. A long serving Royal Marine officer descended of a military family, during his career Harvey became a specialist in <a href="naval%20artillery">naval artillery</a>, serving on many large warships as gunnery training officer and gun commander. Specially requested for , the flagship of the British <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> fleet, Harvey fought at the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20Bight%20%281914%29">Heligoland Bight</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Dogger Bank</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Jutland</a>.

At Jutland, Harvey, although mortally wounded by German shellfire, ordered the magazine of Q turret on the battlecruiser "Lion" to be flooded. This action prevented the tons of <a href="cordite">cordite</a> stored there from catastrophically detonating in an explosion that would have destroyed the vessel and all aboard her. Although he succumbed to his injuries seconds later, his dying act may have saved over a thousand lives and prompted <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> to later comment: "In the long, rough, glorious history of the Royal Marines there is no name and no deed which in its character and consequences ranks above this".

Harvey was born in <a href="Sydenham">Upper Sydenham</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, the son of Commander John William Francis Harvey, <a href="Royal%20Navy">RN</a> and Elizabeth Edwards Lavington Harvey "née" Penny. At age 11 in 1884, Harvey moved with his family to <a href="Southsea">Southsea</a> and he attended <a href="Portsmouth%20Grammar%20School">Portsmouth Grammar School</a>, achieving excellent academic results and showing proficiency in languages and debating. Harvey was descended from a military family; his great-great-grandfather <a href="John%20Harvey%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John Harvey</a> had been killed in the <a href="Glorious%20First%20of%20June">Glorious First of June</a> in 1794 and his great-grandfather Admiral Sir <a href="Edward%20Harvey">Edward Harvey</a>, <a href="Knight%20Grand%20Cross%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">GCB</a>, RN and grandfather Captain John Harvey of the <a href="9th%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">9th Regiment of Foot</a> were also prominent military figures.

After leaving school, Harvey chose a military career and was accepted by both the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Sandhurst">Royal Military College, Sandhurst</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20College%2C%20Greenwich">Royal Naval College, Greenwich</a> for officer training. Choosing the latter school as a Royal Marines officer cadet, Harvey graduated in 1892 and the following year was made a full <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a>, joining for his first seagoing commission. After just a year at sea, Harvey was back on shore attending gunnery courses at , qualifying in 1896 as an instructor first class in naval gunnery. Harvey was appointed to the <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> when she was commissioned at Devonport on 8 June 1897 for service on the Pacific Station. In 1898, whilst on the "Phaëton", he was reprimanded by the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> for an unfavourable report he released on <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> Harbour. Returning home the same year, Harvey was given the position of Assistant Instructor for Gunnery at Plymouth Division. During this period, Harvey married Ethel Edye and had one son, John.

Between 1898 and 1904 Harvey spent much of his time attached to the <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a>, aboard and , practising and instructing in gunnery. On 28 January 1900 he was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">captain</a>. In 1903 he was posted aboard , the first of a string of big ship appointments teaching gunnery to the heavy units of the Channel Fleet. By 1909, Harvey had served on , and the new battlecruiser . In 1910 Harvey became Instructor of Gunnery at <a href="Chatham%20Dockyard">Chatham Dockyard</a> and the following year was promoted to <a href="Major%20%28UK%29">major</a>, a report on the gunnery school commenting "Degree of efficiency in Gunnery Establishment at Chatham is very high both as regards general training and attention to detail. Great credit is due all concerned particularly to Major F.J.W. Harvey, the I of G".

The strength of this report subsequently gained Harvey a position as senior marine officer aboard , the 27,000 ton flagship of the British battlecruiser fleet. "Lion" had eight 13.5-inch guns and Harvey was stationed in an office under Q turret directing their operation and fire. Under her new commander, Rear-Admiral <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty</a>, Harvey served as the senior marine officer on board into the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, his first military campaign.

Harvey did not have to wait long to see action, seeing combat for the first time at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20%281914%29">Battle of Heligoland Bight</a> just weeks into the war. On 28 August 1914, "Lion" and her squadron of and , swept into the <a href="Heligoland%20Bight">Heligoland Bight</a> where German and British cruiser forces were already engaged in a bitter struggle. One German cruiser had already been sunk by the time Beatty's force arrived, but the German flagship and cruiser were surprised in the fog and destroyed by heavy calibre shells from Beatty's battlecruisers. German <a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a> <a href="Leberecht%20Maass">Leberecht Maass</a> and over 1,000 of his sailors were killed, Harvey's guns scoring several hits on the cruisers.

Six months later, Harvey's guns again caused severe damage to a German force at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a>. Over the previous months, a German battlecruiser squadron under <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Rear-Admiral Hipper</a> had crossed the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> and bombarded British coastal towns on several occasions. On 24 January 1915 another attempt was made, but this time British signals analysts had detected the German movement and using this information the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> dispatched Beatty's force to intercept and destroy them. Beatty and Hipper's squadrons collided at 09:00 and during the engagement that followed, "Lion" was left exposed by mis-communication between the ships, which led to engaging the wrong ship, leaving uncovered and so able to fire more accurately. The British flagship was hard pressed until one of "Lion"s shots penetrated one of s turrets. A huge explosion destroyed the neighbouring turret as well and killed 160 men, the German flagship only surviving due to the actions of sailor <a href="Wilhelm%20Heidkamp">Wilhelm Heidkamp</a>, who wrenched open the water valves to the magazines despite them glowing red hot.

"Lion" was badly damaged in the action by shells from the passing and with her engines failing, dropped back to engage the already sinking . Misread signals resulted in the rest of the British fleet returning to support "Lion" in this task, allowing the rest of the battered German fleet to retire as the British destroyed the hapless "Blücher" and 792 of her crew. Following the battle, Harvey remained aboard "Lion" at <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a> for the whole of 1915 and the first five months of 1916, continuing his gunnery training and preparations for major fleet action. His preparations came to fruition on the last day of May, when the British fleet sailed to engage the main body of the German <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a>.

Just after Dogger Bank, Harvey had written to a fellow RMLI officer in describing his experiences:

Beatty's battlecruisers led the British fleet in its attack, casting south into the North Sea to find the enemy during the afternoon of 31 May 1916. At 14:15, scouting cruisers spotted the German vanguard and Beatty closed to attack the enemy with his main force. Given time to prepare, Hipper was ready for Beatty with his battlecruisers in line to face Beatty's approaching ships with their full broadsides. Hipper was also encouraged by the main German battleship fleet under Vice-Admiral <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a>, which was steaming northwards close behind him. At 15:45 Beatty came within range of the German fleet and the vanguards engaged one another with their opening fusillades. As the two squadrons closed, the Germans found the range better and faster than the British, who were silhouetted against the sun. As a result, German shells pounded the British ships while the German ships remained untouched for the first 10 minutes of the engagement. During this stage of the battle "Lion" was hit by nine shells from . One shell at 16:00 struck the right upper corner of the left hand gun port at the junction of the face plate and the roof, and punched a piece of the 9-inch face plate into the turret before detonating, blowing off the armoured roof of the turret and starting a fire, which a damage control party working from outside the turret fought to put out.

The initial explosion killed or wounded everyone stationed in the gun house itself. Harvey, despite severe wounds and burns, realised that the shell hoist leading to the ship's main forward magazine was jammed open. With the hatch open, the flash fire would rapidly travel down to the main magazine resulting in an explosion that would tear the ship in two and kill everyone on board. Staggering across the wreckage of the turret, Harvey gave orders down the voice pipe for the magazine doors to be closed and the magazine compartments to be flooded, an action which would prevent the cordite in the magazines detonating. Turning to his sergeant, the one man still standing, Harvey instructed him to proceed to the bridge and give a full report to the ship's captain <a href="Ernle%20Chatfield%2C%201st%20Baron%20Chatfield">Ernle Chatfield</a> (a standard drill in damage exercises). Seconds later, Harvey collapsed and died from his wounds. The sergeant went immediately to the bridge and notified the captain of Harvey's actions before being taken below to have his wounds dressed.

As soon as the turret had been hit the captain had ordered Q magazine doors closed and the magazine flooded, the order passing to the Transmitting Station below the armoured deck where Stoker 1st Class William Yeo was entrusted with passing the order on. The magazine was consequently flooded and locked up within minutes of the hit. However the cordite charges which had fallen down from gun house after the hit were not removed to safety, and there were still ready charges in the working chamber. A large number of crewmen still remained in the shell room, magazine handing room and working chamber. The fire which was thought to have been put out after the hit on the turret gained strength and ignited the remaining cordite charges, setting off a large explosion at 16:28 which killed the turret crewmen, the flame of the explosion reaching as high as the top of the ship's masts. Even with the precautions taken in hand, the magazine doors were later found to be severely buckled – only the seawater in the magazine behind it prevented the blast reaching inside. Other ships of the battlecruiser fleet were less lucky; at about the same time as Harvey's death, was torn to pieces by a series of magazine explosions that claimed 1,013 lives and just minutes after that HMS "Queen Mary" exploded "like a puffball" in one huge column of grey smoke, killing 1,275 sailors. Hours later during the main battlefleet engagement, Rear-Admiral <a href="Horace%20Hood">Horace Hood</a>'s flagship was destroyed with 1,032 lives. All three ships were lost as the result of magazine explosions similar to the one narrowly avoided on "Lion".

Harvey's charred corpse was taken from the wreckage of Q turret in the aftermath of battle and buried at sea with full honours alongside the other 98 fatal casualties "Lion" had suffered. His bravery in the face of certain death did not go unnoticed; he was mentioned by name in <a href="John%20Jellicoe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Jellicoe">Admiral Jellicoe's</a> post-battle dispatch and he was posthumously awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>. Harvey's widow Ethel was presented with the award at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> by <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George V</a> on 15 September 1916. His medal group was later loaned to the <a href="Royal%20Marines%20Museum">Royal Marines Museum</a>, <a href="Eastney%20Barracks">Eastney Barracks</a> by his son Lieutenant-Colonel John Malcolm Harvey of the <a href="King%27s%20Regiment">King's Regiment</a> in 1973. Harvey's name is inscribed on the <a href="Chatham%20Naval%20Memorial">Chatham Naval Memorial</a> to those with no known grave, administered by the <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a>.

Ernest Joyce

Ernest Edward Mills Joyce <a href="Albert%20Medal%20%28lifesaving%29">AM</a> ( – 2 May 1940) was a <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Naval</a> seaman and explorer who participated in four <a href="Antarctic">Antarctic</a> expeditions during the <a href="Heroic%20Age%20of%20Antarctic%20Exploration">Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration</a>, in the early 20th century. He served under both <a href="Robert%20Falcon%20Scott">Robert Falcon Scott</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Shackleton">Ernest Shackleton</a>. As a member of the <a href="Ross%20Sea%20party">Ross Sea party</a> in Shackleton's <a href="Imperial%20Trans-Antarctic%20Expedition">Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition</a>, Joyce earned an <a href="Albert%20Medal%20%28lifesaving%29">Albert Medal</a> for his actions in bringing the stricken party to safety, after a traumatic journey on the <a href="Ross%20Ice%20Shelf">Great Ice Barrier</a>. He was awarded the <a href="Polar%20Medal">Polar Medal</a> with four bars, one of only two men to be so honoured, the other being his contemporary, <a href="Frank%20Wild">Frank Wild</a>.

Joyce came from a humble seafaring background and began his naval career as a boy seaman in 1891. His Antarctic experiences began 10 years later, when he joined Scott's <a href="Discovery%20Expedition">Discovery Expedition</a> as an Able Seaman. In 1907 Shackleton recruited Joyce to take charge of dogs and <a href="sledges">sledges</a> on the <a href="Nimrod%20Expedition">Nimrod Expedition</a>. Subsequently Joyce was engaged in a similar capacity for <a href="Douglas%20Mawson">Douglas Mawson</a>'s <a href="Australasian%20Antarctic%20Expedition">Australasian Antarctic Expedition</a> in 1911, but left the expedition before it departed for the Antarctic. In 1914 Shackleton recruited Joyce for the Ross Sea party; despite his heroics this expedition marked the end of Joyce's association with the Antarctic, and of his exploring career, although he made repeated attempts to join other expeditions.

Throughout his career Joyce was known as an abrasive personality who attracted adverse as well as positive comments. His effectiveness in the field was widely acknowledged by many of his colleagues, but other aspects of his character were less appreciated – his capacity for bearing grudges, his boastfulness and his distortions of the truth. Joyce's diaries, and the book he wrote based on them, have been condemned as self-serving and the work of a fabulist. He made no significant material gains from his expeditions, living out his post-Antarctic life in humble circumstances before dying in 1940.

Joyce's Naval Service Record show his place and date of birth at Feltham, Sussex, 22 December 1875. . Kelly Tyler-Lewis, in her account of the <a href="Ross%20Sea%20party">Ross Sea party</a>, quotes a newspaper report giving Joyce's age as 64 in 1939, indicating birth year as 1875 – although she also gives his age as 29 in 1901, suggesting an earlier birth year. Joyce's father and grandfather had both been sailors, his father probably within the coastguard service. After the father's early death his widow, with three children to support on her limited earnings as a seamstress, sent the young Ernest to the Lower School of <a href="Royal%20Hospital%20School">Greenwich Royal Hospital School</a> for Navy Orphans at <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a>. Here, in austere surroundings, he received a vocational education that would prepare him for a lower-deck career in the Royal Navy. After leaving the school in 1891, he joined the navy as a boy seaman, progressing over the next ten years to <a href="Ordinary%20Seaman">Ordinary Seaman</a> and then <a href="Able%20Seaman">Able Seaman</a>. Joyce had blue eyes and a fair complexion, with a tattoo on his left forearm and a scar on his right cheek. He was not a tall man, only 5' 7" in height. .

British Naval Archive Records at Portsmouth - No: 160823 - provide full details on Joyce’s early naval service. This commenced in May 1891 as a Boy Second Class on the St. Vincent, and over the following ten years he served on a number of ships; the Boscawen, Alexandra, Victory 1, Duke of Wellington, etc. . In 1891 he was serving on <a href="HMS%20Gibraltar%20%281892%29">HMS "Gibraltar"</a> in Cape Town where, in September, Scott's expedition ship <a href="RRS%20Discovery">"Discovery"</a> stopped on the way to the Antarctic. Scott was short-handed, and requested volunteers; from a response of several hundreds, Joyce was one of four seamen chosen to join "Discovery". He sailed south with her on 14 October 1901.

The "Discovery" expedition was Joyce's Antarctic baptism, although for the next three years he kept a relatively low profile; Scott scarcely mentions him in "The Voyage of the Discovery", and <a href="Edward%20Adrian%20Wilson">Edward Wilson</a>'s diaries not at all. It seems that he took readily to Antarctic life, gaining experience in sledging and dog-driving techniques and other aspects of Antarctic exploration. He did not figure in the main journeys of the expedition, although towards the end he joined Arthur Pilbeam and <a href="Frank%20Wild">Frank Wild</a> in an attempt to climb <a href="Mount%20Erebus">Mount Erebus</a>, ascending to some . Joyce was at times badly affected by <a href="frostbite">frostbite</a>; on one occasion two officers, <a href="Michael%20Barne">Michael Barne</a> and <a href="George%20Mulock">George Mulock</a>, held Joyce's frostbitten foot against the pits of their stomachs and kneaded the ankle for several hours to save it from amputation. However, such experiences left Joyce undaunted; the polar historian <a href="Beau%20Riffenburgh">Beau Riffenburgh</a> writes that Joyce was repeatedly drawn to the Antarctic by "a curious combination of affection and antipathy" that "impelled [him] to return again and again".

During the expedition Joyce encountered several men who would feature prominently in Antarctic polar history during the following years, including Scott, Wilson, Frank Wild, <a href="Tom%20Crean%20%28explorer%29">Tom Crean</a>, <a href="William%20Lashly">William Lashly</a>, <a href="Edgar%20Evans">Edgar Evans</a> and, most significantly, Ernest Shackleton. Joyce made several sledging trips with Shackleton and created an impression of competence and reliability. He also impressed Scott as "sober, honest, loyal and intelligent", and expedition organiser <a href="Sir%20Clements%20Markham">Sir Clements Markham</a> later described him as "an honest and trustworthy man". His reward, at the conclusion of the expedition, was promotion to <a href="Petty%20Officer%201st%20Class">Petty Officer 1st Class</a> on Scott's recommendation. However, he had been bitten by the bug of Antarctic exploration, and ordinary naval duty no longer appealed. He left the navy in 1905 but found shore life unsatisfying and re-enlisted in 1906. When the chance came a year later to join Shackleton's "Nimrod" Expedition, he took it immediately.

When Shackleton was selecting the crew for his Antarctic expedition in "Nimrod", Joyce was one of his earliest recruits. Most accounts tell the story that Shackleton saw Joyce on a bus that was passing his expedition offices, sent someone out to fetch him, and recruited him on the spot. To join the expedition, Joyce bought his release from the Navy; in later years he would claim that Shackleton had failed to recompense him for this, despite a promise to do so, one of several disputes over money and recognition which would strain his relations with Shackleton. Joyce, Shackleton and Frank Wild were the only members of the expedition with previous Antarctic experience, and on the basis of his "Discovery" exploits, Joyce was put in charge of the new expedition's general stores, sledges and dogs. Before departure in August 1907, he and Wild took a crash course in printing at Sir Joseph Causton's printing firm in Hampshire, as Shackleton intended to publish a book or magazine while in the Antarctic.

"Nimrod" left New Zealand on 1 January 1908, and as a fuel-saving measure was towed towards the Antarctic pack ice by the tug "Koonya". On 23 January, by now under her own power, she reached the <a href="Ross%20Ice%20Shelf">Ross Ice Shelf</a> (then known as the "Great Ice Barrier", or "Barrier"), where Shackleton planned to base his headquarters in an inlet discovered during the "Discovery" voyage. This proved impossible; the inlet, where Scott and Shackleton had taken balloon flights in February 1902, had greatly expanded to become an open bay, christened the "Bay of Whales". Shackleton was convinced that the ice was not secure enough as a landing ground, and could find no feasible alternative site on nearby <a href="King%20Edward%20VII%20Land">King Edward VII Land</a>. Before leaving for the Antarctic Shackleton had promised Scott that he would not base his expedition in or near Scott's former headquarters in <a href="McMurdo%20Sound">McMurdo Sound</a>. Shackleton was now forced to break this agreement, and take "Nimrod" to the safer waters of McMurdo Sound. The site finally chosen as a base was at <a href="Cape%20Royds">Cape Royds</a>, some north of Scott's old "Discovery" headquarters at <a href="Hut%20Point">Hut Point</a>. During the extended and often difficult process of unloading the ship Joyce remained ashore, looking after the dogs and ponies, and helping to build the expedition hut. Joyce was witness to an incident during unloading, where a crate hook attached to a barrel swung across and struck one of the watching officers - <a href="Aeneas%20Mackintosh">Aeneas Mackintosh</a> - on the face. (Mackintosh's right eye was virtually destroyed and later that day the expedition doctor operated to remove the eye.) In March Joyce assisted the party that made the first successful ascent of <a href="Mount%20Erebus">Mount Erebus</a>, although he did not make the climb himself.

During the following winter Joyce, with Wild's help, printed copies of the expedition book "<a href="Aurora%20Australis">Aurora Australis</a>", edited by Shackleton. About 25 or 30 copies of the book were printed, sewn and bound. Otherwise Joyce was busy preparing equipment and stores for the next season's journey to the Pole in which, in view of his experience, he fully expected to be included. However, various mishaps had reduced the number of ponies to four, so Shackleton cut the southern party to that number. One of those dropped was Joyce, on advice from expedition doctor <a href="Eric%20Marshall">Eric Marshall</a>, who noted that Joyce had a liver problem and the early stages of heart disease. Frank Wild, who along with Marshall and <a href="Jameson%20Adams">Jameson Adams</a> was selected for the southern journey, wrote in his diary after the party's bid to reach the Pole had fallen short: "If we only had Joyce and Marston here instead of these two useless grub-scoffing beggars"—Marshall and Adams—"we would have done it easily." Joyce showed no particular resentment at his exclusion; he assisted the preparatory work and accompanied the polar party on the southward march for the first seven days. In the following months he took charge of enhancing the depots, to ensure adequate supplies for the returning southern party. He deposited a special cache of luxuries at Minna Bluff, together with life-saving food and fuel, earning Wild's spontaneous praise when the cache was discovered.

Shackleton and his party returned safely from their polar journey, on "Nimrod's" last feasible date for sailing home. They had established a new <a href="Farthest%20South">Farthest South</a> at 88°23′S, only from the <a href="South%20Pole">South Pole</a>. Joyce had been ready to remain at the base with a rearguard, to wait for the party or to establish its fate if it did not return in time to catch the ship. "Nimrod" finally reached London in September 1909 and was prepared, under Joyce's direction, as a floating exhibition of polar artefacts. Shackleton paid him a salary of £250 a year, , a generous amount for the time.

Joyce was not invited to join Scott's <a href="Terra%20Nova%20Expedition">Terra Nova Expedition</a>, although several of Shackleton's men were, including Frank Wild who declined. Instead, Joyce and Wild both signed up for <a href="Douglas%20Mawson">Douglas Mawson</a>'s <a href="Australasian%20Antarctic%20Expedition">Australasian Antarctic Expedition</a>. In 1911 Joyce travelled to <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> to acquire dogs for this expedition, and took them on to Tasmania. Joyce did not subsequently sail with Mawson. According to one account he was "dismissed" before the expedition left Australia, while another suggests that Joyce was dropped when Mawson reduced his expedition from three shore parties to two. Whatever the reason, it appears that there was a falling-out; Mawson reportedly distrusted Joyce, saying that "he spent too much time in hotels", which suggests that drink was an issue. Joyce remained in Australia, obtaining work with the <a href="Sydney%20Harbour%20Trust">Sydney Harbour Trust</a>.

In February 1914 Joyce, still in Australia, was contacted by Shackleton. who outlined plans for his <a href="Imperial%20Trans-Antarctic%20Expedition">Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition</a>. Shackleton wanted Joyce in the expedition's supporting <a href="Ross%20Sea%20party">Ross Sea party</a>; should the plans change to a one-ship format, Shackleton promised to find a different role for Joyce within the expedition. Joyce would later claim without justification that Shackleton had offered him a place on the main transcontinental party. In his subsequent book, "The South Polar Trail" published in 1929, Joyce also misrepresented the nature of his appointment to the Ross Sea party, omitting Shackleton's order that placed him under an officer and claiming that he had been given sole authority over dogs and sledging.

The task of the Ross Sea party, under the command of another "Nimrod" veteran, <a href="Aeneas%20Mackintosh">Aeneas Mackintosh</a>, was to establish a base in McMurdo Sound and then lay a series of supply depots across the Ross Ice Shelf to assist the transcontinental party. Shackleton saw this task as routine; he wrote: "I had not anticipated that the work would present any great difficulties". However, the party had been assembled rather hurriedly, and was inexperienced. Only Joyce and Mackintosh had been to the Antarctic before, and Mackintosh's participation in polar work had been brief; he had been invalided from the Nimrod Expedition before the initial landing, after an accident led to the loss of his right eye and had returned only for the final stages of the expedition

"Aurora"s departure from Australia was delayed by a series of organisational and financial setbacks, and the party did not arrive in McMurdo Sound until 16 January 1915—very late in the season for depot-laying work. Mackintosh, who believed that Shackleton might attempt to cross the continent in that first season, insisted that sledging work should begin without delay, with a view to laying down supply depots at 79° and 80°S. Joyce opposed this; more time, he maintained, should be set aside to acclimatise and train men and dogs. However he was over-ruled by Mackintosh, who was unaware that Shackleton had ruled out a crossing that season. Joyce's diary notes of January the 24th detail his frustrations: 

""After breakfast Skipper + I discussed several details. I could not get him to see that we were jeopardizing the dogs + I cannot quite understand why Shacks should alter his plan of campaign. As for wintering the ship - this to my mind is the silliest damn rot that could have possibly occurred. The wintering of the Discovery was quite alright in its way, but then we had no experience of Antarctic conditions. If I had Shacks here I would make him see my way of arguing.

"Anyway Mack is my Boss + I must uphold him until I find that he is not fit to carry out the hard tedious work that is in front of us. Having one eye will play merry hell with him in the extreme temperatures. As he will not take my advice about the dogs I must let him have his way.""" 

Mackintosh further vexed Joyce by deciding to lead this depot-laying party himself, unmoved by Joyce's claim to have independent authority over this area. The party was divided into two teams, and the journey began on 24 January, in an atmosphere of muddle. Initial attempts at travelling on the Barrier were thwarted by the condition of the surface, and Mackintosh's team got lost on the sea ice between Cape Evans and Hut Point. Joyce privately gloated over this evidence of the captain's inexperience. The teams eventually reached the 79° mark, and laid the "Bluff depot" there (<a href="Minna%20Bluff">Minna Bluff</a> was a prominent visible landmark at this latitude) on 9 February. It seemed that Joyce's party had enjoyed the easier journey. Mackintosh's plan to take the dogs on to the 80° mark led to more words between him and Joyce, who argued that several dogs had already died and that the remainder needed to be kept for future journeys, but again he was over-ruled. On 20 February the party reached the 80° latitude and laid their depot there. The outcome of this journey was of provisions and fuel at 80°S and at 79°S. But a further , intended for the depots, had been dumped on the journey, to save weight.

By this time men and dogs were worn out. On the return journey, in appalling Barrier weather, all the dogs perished, as Joyce had predicted, and the party returned to Hut Point on 24 March exhausted and severely frostbitten. After being delayed for ten weeks at Hut Point by the condition of the sea ice, the party finally got back to their base at Cape Evans on 2 June. They then learned that "Aurora", with most of the shore party's stores and equipment still aboard, had been torn from its moorings in a gale, and blown far out to sea with no prospect of swift return. Fortunately, the rations for the next season's depot-laying had been landed before the ship's involuntary departure. However, the shore party's own food, fuel, clothing and equipment had been largely carried away; replacements would have to be improvised from supplies left at Cape Evans after Scott's 1910–13 Terra Nova expedition, augmented by <a href="seal%20meat">seal meat</a> and blubber. In these circumstances Joyce proved his worth as a "master scavenger" and improviser, unearthing from Scott's abandoned stores, among other treasures, a large canvas tent from which he fashioned roughly tailored clothing. He also set about stitching 500 calico bags, to hold the depot rations.

The party set out on 1 September 1915. The men were under-trained and half-fit, in primitive clothing and with home-made equipment. With only five dogs remaining from the previous season's debacle, the task would mostly be one of <a href="manhauling">manhauling</a>. Before beginning the march south—a return distance of —approximately of stores had to be taken to the base depot at <a href="Minna%20Bluff">Minna Bluff</a>. This phase of the task lasted until 28 December. Mackintosh had divided his forces into two parties, himself in charge of one and Joyce of the other. The two men continued to disagree over methods; finally, Joyce confronted Mackintosh with incontrovertible evidence that his party's methods were much the more effective, and Mackintosh capitulated. "I never came across such an idiot in charge of men", Joyce wrote in his diary.

The weaker members of the party—<a href="Arnold%20Spencer-Smith">Arnold Spencer-Smith</a> and Mackintosh himself—were by this time showing signs of physical breakdown, as the long march south began from Bluff Depot towards <a href="Mount%20Hope%20%28Ross%20Dependency%29">Mount Hope</a> at 83°30′S, where the final depot was to be laid. The party was reduced to six when three men were forced to turn back because of a Primus stove failure. With Mackintosh and Joyce in the final party were Spencer-Smith, <a href="Ernest%20Wild">Ernest Wild</a> (younger brother of Frank), <a href="Richard%20W%20Richards">Dick Richards</a> and <a href="Victor%20Hayward">Victor Hayward</a>. With four dogs they trekked southward, increasingly afflicted by frostbite, <a href="snow%20blindness">snow blindness</a> and, eventually, <a href="scurvy">scurvy</a>. Spencer-Smith collapsed, and thereafter had to be carried on the sledge. Mackintosh, barely able to walk, fought on until the final depot was laid at Mount Hope. On the homeward journey the effective leadership of the party fell increasingly to Joyce, as Mackintosh's condition deteriorated until, like Spencer-Smith, he had to be carried on the sledge. The journey became a protracted struggle which eventually cost the life of Spencer-Smith and took the others to the limits of their endurance. Mackintosh suffered further physical and mental collapse, and had to be left in the tent while Joyce, himself suffering from severe snow blindness, led the rest to the safety of <a href="Hut%20Point">Hut Point</a>. He, Dick Richards and Ernest Wild then returned for Mackintosh, reaching his tent on March the 16th. Joyce wrote that evening: 

""Good going passed Smith’s grave 10.45 + had lunch at Depot. Saw Skippers camp just after + looking through the glasses found him outside the tent much to the joy of all hands as we expected him to be down."" The five survivors were all back at Hut Point on 18 March 1916.

All five men were showing symptoms of scurvy with varying severity. However, a diet of fresh seal meat, rich in <a href="Vitamin%20C">Vitamin C</a>, enabled them to recover slowly. By mid-April they were ready to consider travelling the final across the frozen sea to the base at Cape Evans.

Joyce tested the sea-ice on 18 April and found it firm, but the following day a blizzard from the south swept all the ice away. The ambience at Hut Point was gloomy, and the unrelieved diet of seal was depressing. This seemed particularly to affect Mackintosh, and on 8 May, despite the urgent pleadings of Joyce, Richards and Ernest Wild, he decided to risk the re-formed ice and walk to Cape Evans. Victor Hayward volunteered to accompany him. Joyce recorded in his diary: "I fail to understand how these people are so anxious to risk their lives again". Shortly after their departure a blizzard descended, and the two were never seen again.

Joyce and the others learned the fate of Mackintosh and Hayward only when they were finally able to reach Cape Evans in July. Joyce immediately set about organising searches for traces of the missing men; in the subsequent months parties were sent to search the coasts and the islands in McMurdo Sound, but to no avail. Joyce also organised journeys to recover geological samples left on the Barrier and to visit the grave of Spencer-Smith, where a large cross was erected. In the absence of the ship, the seven remaining survivors lived quietly, until on 10 January 1917, the refitted "Aurora" arrived with Shackleton aboard to take them home. They learned then that their depot-laying efforts had been futile, Shackleton's ship <a href="Endurance%20%281912%20ship%29">"Endurance"</a> having been crushed by the Weddell Sea ice nearly two years previously.

After his return to New Zealand Joyce was hospitalised, mainly from the effects of snow blindness, and according to his own account had to wear dark glasses for a further 18 months. During this period he married Beatrice Curtlett from Christchurch. He was now probably unfit for further polar work, although he attempted, unsuccessfully, to rejoin the Navy in 1918. In September 1919 he was seriously injured in a car accident, which led to months of convalescence followed by a return to England. In 1920 he signed up for a new Antarctic expedition to be led by John Cope of the Ross Sea party, but this venture proved abortive. He continued to maintain his claims to financial compensation from Shackleton, which caused a breach between them, and he was not invited to join <a href="Shackleton%E2%80%93Rowett%20Expedition">Shackleton's "Quest" expedition</a> which departed in 1921. He applied to join the <a href="1921%20British%20Mount%20Everest%20reconnaissance%20expedition">British Mount Everest expedition of 1921–22</a>, but was rejected.

He was in the public eye again in 1923 when he was awarded the <a href="Albert%20Medal%20%28lifesaving%29">Albert Medal</a> for his efforts to save the lives of Mackintosh and Spencer-Smith during the 1916 depot-laying journey. Richards received the same award; Hayward, and Ernest Wild, who had died of typhoid during naval service in the Mediterranean in 1918, received the award posthumously. In 1929 Joyce published a contentious version of his diaries under the title "The South Polar Trail", in which he boosted his own role, played down the contributions of others, and incorporated fictitious colourful details. Thereafter he indulged in various schemes for further expeditions, and wrote numerous articles and stories based on his exploits before settling into a quiet life as a hotel porter in London. Bickel's assertion that Joyce lived into his eighties, beyond the date (1958) of the first Antarctic crossing by <a href="Vivian%20Fuchs">Vivian Fuchs</a> and his party, is not supported by any other source. Joyce died from natural causes, aged about 65, on 2 May 1940. He is commemorated in Antarctica by <a href="Mount%20Joyce">Mount Joyce</a> at .

The polar historian <a href="Roland%20Huntford">Roland Huntford</a> sums up Joyce as a "strange mixture of fraud, flamboyance and ability". This mixed assessment is endorsed in the assortment of views expressed by those associated with him. Dick Richards of the Ross Sea party described him as "a kindly soul and a good pal", and others shared the favourable opinions expressed by Scott and Markham, confirming Joyce as a "jolly good sort", though unsuited for command. On the other hand, Eric Marshall of the Nimrod Expedition had found him "of limited intelligence, resentful and incompatible", while <a href="John%20King%20Davis">John King Davis</a>, when refusing to join the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, told Shackleton: "I absolutely decline to be associated with any enterprise with which people of the Joyce type are connected".

Joyce's versions of events recorded in his published diaries have been described as unreliable and sometimes as outright invention—a "self-aggrandizing epic". Specific examples of this "fabulism" include his self-designation as "Captain" after the Ross Sea expedition; his invented claim to have seen Scott's death tent on the Barrier; the misrepresentation of his instructions from Shackleton regarding his sledging role, and his assertion of independence in the field; his claim to have been offered a place on the transcontinental party when Shackleton had made it clear he did not want him there; and his habit, late in life, of writing anonymously to the press praising "the famous Polar Explorer Ernest Mills Joyce". This self-promotion neither surprised nor upset his former comrades. "It is what I would have expected", said Richards. "He was bombastic [...] but true-hearted and a staunch friend". Alexander Stevens, the party's chief scientist, concurred. They knew that Joyce, for all his swaggering style, had the will and determination to "drag men back from certain death". <a href="Edward%20Shackleton%2C%20Baron%20Shackleton">Lord Shackleton</a>, the explorer's son, named Joyce (with Mackintosh and Richards) as "one of those who emerge from the (Ross Sea party) story as heroes".

2008 Monaco Grand Prix

The 2008 Monaco Grand Prix (formally the LXVI Grand Prix de Monaco) was a <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> motor race held on 25 May 2008 at the <a href="Circuit%20de%20Monaco">Circuit de Monaco</a>; contested over 76 laps, it was the sixth race of the <a href="2008%20Formula%20One%20season">2008 Formula One season</a>. The race was won by the season's eventual <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">Drivers' Champion</a>, <a href="Lewis%20Hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a>, for the <a href="McLaren%20%28racing%29">McLaren</a> team. <a href="BMW%20Sauber">BMW Sauber</a> driver <a href="Robert%20Kubica">Robert Kubica</a> finished second, and <a href="Felipe%20Massa">Felipe Massa</a>, who started from <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a>, was third in a <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a>.

Conditions were wet at the start of the race. Massa maintained his lead into the first corner, but his teammate <a href="Kimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen">Kimi Räikkönen</a> was passed for second by Hamilton, who had started in third position on the <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23G">grid</a>. Hamilton suffered a punctured <a href="Formula%20One%20tyres">tyre</a> on lap six, forcing him to make a <a href="pit%20stop">pit stop</a> from which he re-entered the race in fifth place. As the track dried and his rivals made their own pit stops Hamilton became the race leader, a position he held until the end of the race. Kubica's strategy allowed him to pass Massa during their second pit stops, after the latter's Ferrari was forced to change from wet to dry tyres. Räikkönen dropped back from fifth position to ninth after colliding with <a href="Adrian%20Sutil">Adrian Sutil</a>'s <a href="Force%20India">Force India</a> late in the race. Sutil had started from 18th on the grid and was in fourth position before the incident, which allowed <a href="Red%20Bull%20Racing">Red Bull</a> driver <a href="Mark%20Webber">Mark Webber</a> to finish fourth, ahead of <a href="Scuderia%20Toro%20Rosso">Toro Rosso</a> driver <a href="Sebastian%20Vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> in fifth.

The race was Hamilton's second win of the season, his first in Monaco, and the result meant that he led the Drivers' Championship, three <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Championship%20points%20scoring%20systems">points</a> ahead of Räikkönen and four ahead of Massa. Ferrari maintained their lead in the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Constructors%27%20Champions">Constructors' Championship</a>, 16 points ahead of McLaren and 17 ahead of BMW Sauber, with 12 races of the season remaining.

The Grand Prix was contested by 20 drivers, in ten teams of two. The teams, also known as "<a href="Formula%20One%23Constructors">constructors</a>", were <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a>, <a href="McLaren%20%28racing%29">McLaren</a>-<a href="Mercedes-Benz%20HighPerformanceEngines">Mercedes</a>, <a href="Renault%20F1">Renault</a>, <a href="Honda%20Racing%20F1">Honda</a>, <a href="Force%20India">Force India</a>-Ferrari, <a href="BMW%20Sauber">BMW Sauber</a>, <a href="Toyota%20F1">Toyota</a>, <a href="Red%20Bull%20Racing">Red Bull</a>-Renault, <a href="WilliamsF1">Williams</a>-Toyota and <a href="Scuderia%20Toro%20Rosso">Toro Rosso</a>-Ferrari. <a href="Formula%20One%20tyres">Tyre</a> supplier <a href="Bridgestone">Bridgestone</a> brought four different tyre types to the race: two dry-weather tyre compounds, the softer marked by a single white stripe down one of the grooves, and two wet-weather compounds, the extreme wet also marked by a single white stripe.

Before the race, Ferrari driver <a href="Kimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen">Kimi Räikkönen</a> led the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">Drivers' Championship</a> with 35 <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Championship%20points%20scoring%20systems">points</a>, and his teammate <a href="Felipe%20Massa">Felipe Massa</a> was second with 28 points. McLaren driver <a href="Lewis%20Hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> was third, also on 28 points, with one win fewer than Massa; BMW driver <a href="Robert%20Kubica">Robert Kubica</a> was fourth on 24 points, ahead of his teammate <a href="Nick%20Heidfeld">Nick Heidfeld</a> on 20 points. In the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Constructors%27%20Champions">Constructors' Championship</a>, Ferrari were leading with 63 points, 19 points ahead of BMW Sauber, and 21 points ahead of McLaren-Mercedes.

Ferrari had responded to Hamilton's win in the opening round of the season <a href="2008%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">in Australia</a> by winning each of the subsequent four races, giving them a commanding lead in the Constructors' Championship. Ferrari's dominance had been highlighted by two <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23O">one-two</a> finishes: Massa ahead of Räikkönen <a href="2008%20Bahrain%20Grand%20Prix">in Bahrain</a> and Räikkönen's win over Massa at the <a href="2008%20Spanish%20Grand%20Prix">following round in Spain</a>. A strong drive despite an unfavourable strategy had helped Hamilton to split the Ferrari drivers on the <a href="podium">podium</a> <a href="2008%20Turkish%20Grand%20Prix">in Turkey</a>, coming second, behind Massa but ahead of Räikkönen. Ferrari had not won in Monaco <a href="2001%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">since 2001</a>, and had been unable to match McLaren's pace <a href="2007%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">in 2007</a>. After tests at the <a href="Circuit%20Paul%20Ricard">Circuit Paul Ricard</a> in mid-May, Räikkönen said his team had developed a strong car for the tight, low-speed Monaco circuit, but they still expected a challenge from McLaren and BMW Sauber. Hamilton claimed that McLaren would be competitive at Monaco, but Kubica played down his team's chances, saying "I think a win will be very difficult."

Toro Rosso's main 2008 car, the <a href="Toro%20Rosso%20STR3">STR3</a>, was also introduced that weekend; the team had used a modified version of their 2007 car, the <a href="Toro%20Rosso%20STR2">STR2</a>, for the opening five races. Originally due to be introduced at the previous race in Turkey, a crash in testing had left the team short of spare parts, delaying the car's race debut. As the STR3 used a different <a href="Formula%20One%20car%23Transmission">transmission</a> than that used in the STR2, Toro Rosso driver <a href="Sebastian%20Vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> was forced to take a five-place penalty on the <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23G">grid</a> for an unscheduled change of gearbox. His teammate <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Bourdais">Sébastien Bourdais</a> escaped a similar penalty because he had failed to finish the race in Turkey, allowing him a free gearbox change.
Three practice sessions were held before the Sunday race – two on Thursday, and one on Saturday. The Thursday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90 minutes; the third session, on Saturday morning, lasted for an hour. One hour into the first session, officials noticed a loose drain cover in the run through Beau Rivage, and suspended practice. Ferrari and McLaren took the top four spots after the resumption – Räikkönen ahead of Hamilton, McLaren driver <a href="Heikki%20Kovalainen">Heikki Kovalainen</a>, and Massa. Behind Williams driver <a href="Nico%20Rosberg">Nico Rosberg</a>, Kubica was the best of the BMW Saubers in sixth; his teammate Heidfeld was forced to retire because of an engine failure, and stopped his car in Casino Square after just 13 laps. Despite further delays during the second session – both Renault drivers crashed in separate incidents at Sainte Devote, requiring the <a href="Motorsport%20marshal">marshals</a> to sweep the track of debris – Hamilton again proved strong, fastest ahead of Rosberg, Räikkönen, Massa, Kovalainen and Kubica. Apart from the Renault drivers, two more cars struck the barriers: Toyota driver <a href="Jarno%20Trulli">Jarno Trulli</a> scraped the wall out of Piscine; <a href="Adrian%20Sutil">Adrian Sutil</a>'s Force India lost its <a href="Formula%20One%20car%23Aerodynamics">front wing</a> after tagging the barrier at Rascasse. While light rain fell on Saturday morning, Kovalainen set the fastest time in the final session, before losing control at Piscine and damaging the rear of his car. The rain increased as the marshals cleared the debris, and in the ensuing poor track conditions Kovalainen's time remained unbeaten. Hamilton managed second fastest, ahead of Räikkönen, Rosberg, Kubica and Massa.

Saturday afternoon's qualifying session was divided into three parts. In the first 20-minute period, cars finishing 16th or lower were eliminated. The second qualifying period lasted for 15 minutes, at the end of which the fastest ten cars went into the final period, to determine their grid positions for the race. Cars failing to make the final period were allowed to be refuelled before the race but those competing in it were not, and so carried more fuel than they had done in the earlier qualifying sessions.

Massa clinched his third <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a> of the season with a time of 1:15.787, and was joined on the front row by teammate Räikkönen. Hamilton took third place on the grid, with a qualifying time just 0.052 seconds slower than Massa's. Kovalainen edged out Kubica to take fourth, the latter struggling to get heat into his tyres for his final run. Rosberg's attacking style took him to sixth; Renault driver <a href="Fernando%20Alonso">Fernando Alonso</a>, Trulli and Red Bull driver <a href="Mark%20Webber">Mark Webber</a> occupied the next three places. Webber's teammate <a href="David%20Coulthard">David Coulthard</a> ended his second session in the barriers after the tunnel, after his car jerked sideways at the crest under braking. Although Coulthard was unhurt, the position of his stricken car and the subsequent <a href="Racing%20flags%23Yellow%20flag">caution flags</a> surrounding it denied many drivers the opportunity to make their final <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23F">flying laps</a> in the session. Honda driver <a href="Jenson%20Button">Jenson Button</a>, who took 12th behind <a href="Timo%20Glock">Timo Glock</a> of Toyota, blamed the disruption for his performance, having prepared his car specifically for the final run. Heidfeld suffered from similar tyre problems to his teammate and managed 13th; Williams driver <a href="Kazuki%20Nakajima">Kazuki Nakajima</a> and Honda driver <a href="Rubens%20Barrichello">Rubens Barrichello</a> took the next two places ahead of Bourdais in the new STR3. Renault driver <a href="Nelson%20Piquet%2C%20Jr.">Nelson Piquet</a> lined up from 17th and Vettel managed 18th before his gearbox penalty demoted him to 19th. The Force Indias of Sutil and <a href="Giancarlo%20Fisichella">Giancarlo Fisichella</a> qualified slowest; Fisichella's penalty for a change of gearbox after morning practice meant he started from 20th on the grid.
On Sunday morning Coulthard became the third driver to incur a gearbox penalty, after changing his transmission following his crash during qualifying. The penalty moved him from 10th to 15th on the grid. In contrast to Saturday's dry qualifying session, frequent showers soaked the track on Sunday morning, making racing slippery and potentially hazardous. Although the showers subsided by early afternoon, they resumed 20 minutes before the start, the changeable conditions forcing teams to delay tyre choices for as long as possible. By the time of the three-minute warning most drivers had opted for the standard wet tyre; only Piquet started the race on the extreme wet. Kovalainen's engine <a href="Stall%20%28engine%29">stalled</a> as the cars set off on their <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23F">formation lap</a>; his car was pushed back to the pit lane by his mechanics, where it was restarted and a new steering wheel fitted to solve the problem.

Massa held his lead into the first corner at Sainte Devote, while behind him Hamilton used the pit lane exit to pass Räikkönen down the inside. Kovalainen's vacated fourth position was filled by Kubica, as Alonso moved into fifth, passing Rosberg. The latter made a <a href="pit%20stop">pit stop</a> soon after for a new front wing after making contact with Alonso at the <a href="Hairpin%20turn">hairpin</a>, promoting Trulli to sixth. These positions were maintained for several laps, but the distances between the cars increased, in part because the spray thrown up by their wheels made close racing difficult. The conditions proved to be crucial when Hamilton made contact with barriers on the outside of Tabac on lap six, necessitating his return to the pit lane for a new set of tyres. The McLaren mechanics fuelled the car for a longer second <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23S">stint</a> and Hamilton emerged in fifth, the distances between his competitors' cars resulting in him losing only three places during the pit stop. Alonso had a similar accident to Hamilton's at Massenet two laps later, and emerged in seventh after pitting and taking on extreme wets.

Massa's lead – 12 seconds over the second-placed Räikkönen by lap six – was reduced to nothing when the <a href="safety%20car">safety car</a> was deployed on the eighth lap. Coulthard and Bourdais had crashed into the barriers at Massenet just seconds apart, requiring the marshals to separate the cars and lift them off the track. When the safety car pulled off after three laps, Massa consolidated his lead over his teammate. Räikkönen, however, was called into the pit lane for a <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23D">drive-through penalty</a> after to failing to have his tyres attached by the three-minute warning before the race, dropping him back to fourth. Kubica, now second, took the lead when Massa slid off down the escape road at Sainte Devote, the undamaged Ferrari rejoining in second as the rain eased. The two swapped positions again after their pit stops – Kubica on lap 26 and Massa on lap 33 – but Hamilton, carrying more fuel than his rivals, took the lead.

As a <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23D">dry line</a> appeared on the track, Hamilton extended his lead over Massa, from 13 to 37 seconds, by the time he made a pit stop for the second time on lap 54. His timing proved fortunate, as he changed to dry tyres just as such a strategy emerged as the strongest, and he emerged 13 seconds ahead of Massa. The Ferrari's own pit stop two laps later dropped Massa behind Kubica. Hamilton's lead was reduced when the safety car once again deployed on lap 62 after Rosberg crashed at Piscine, hitting both sides of the track and scattering debris. Rosberg was unhurt.

Of the 20 cars which started the race, Sutil had gained the most places by the second safety car period. The Force India started from 18th, rose one place after Kovalainen was pushed back to the pit lane, passed Piquet on the second lap and Bourdais a lap later. Sutil benefited as Button, Rosberg, Glock and Trulli made pit stops for repairs over the following laps, to sit in 11th by lap 14. Alonso, on extreme wet tyres behind Heidfeld, attempted to pass the BMW at the hairpin, but succeeded only in damaging his front wing and forming a stationary queue behind him. He also benefitted by overtaking three cars under yellow flags and would have been penalised if he had finished the race. Sutil took advantage of the situation and passed four cars to take seventh, behind Heidfeld and Webber. Running a long first stint until lap 53, he moved to fourth as the cars ahead of him made pit stops. Vettel gained 12 places from the start, battling with Barrichello and Nakajima early on before jumping several places on his first stint as his rivals made pit stops, eventually switching to dry tyres when he stopped on lap 52. Webber improved three places from the start to sit in sixth, ahead of Vettel, Barrichello and Nakajima.

The safety car was withdrawn on lap 68. Later on the same lap, Räikkönen lost control of his car under braking out of the tunnel, and by the time he regained control his speed was too great to avoid a collision with Sutil. The Ferrari damaged its front wing and made a pit stops for a replacement before resuming, but the damage to Sutil's rear <a href="Suspension%20%28vehicle%29">suspension</a> led to his retirement. Webber benefited from the incident and moved to fourth place, while Räikkönen dropped back to ninth.

The slow pace during the opening laps meant the race ended after two hours, or 76 laps, rather than the 78 laps originally scheduled. Hamilton, despite suffering a slow puncture on the final lap, crossed the finish line to take his first win in Monaco. Kubica followed in second, ahead of Massa and Webber. Vettel took the STR3 to its first points in its maiden race, coming fifth, ahead of Barrichello and Nakajima. Kovalainen recovered from his stall to finish eighth, one place ahead of Räikkönen, who set the <a href="fastest%20lap">fastest lap</a> of the race on lap 74, a 1:16.689. He was followed by Alonso, Button, Glock and Trulli. Heidfeld was the last of the classified finishers, in 14th position, four laps behind Hamilton. Fisichella retired with a gearbox failure after 36 laps; Piquet – two laps after he switched to dry tyres on lap 46 – finished his race in the barriers at Sainte Devote. Sutil, Rosberg, Coulthard and Bourdais were the four other retirements.
The top three finishers appeared in <a href="Albert%20II%2C%20Prince%20of%20Monaco">Prince Albert II of Monaco's</a> Royal box to collect their trophies. In the subsequent <a href="press%20conference">press conference</a> Hamilton said that conditions early in the race made driving difficult: "When the weather is like this, when it starts to rain and we had an idea it was going to start to dry, the important thing is to keep it on the track but I can't explain how difficult it was for all of us. You were <a href="Hydroplaning%20%28tires%29">aquaplaning</a> all the time and you were tip-toeing almost." Hamilton also said that his crash at Tabac had been the result of a stream of water running over the track, causing his car to <a href="oversteer">oversteer</a> and resulting in a puncture to his right rear tyre. Nevertheless, he praised his team and strategy for helping him take the victory. Kubica said that tyre problems in his middle stint meant he was unable to overtake Massa, who was driving a heavier car. Noticing Glock's success on dry tyres, Kubica asked his team to make a similar change, resulting in his pass on Massa. During the post-race interview Massa said that although he was fuelled to the end of the race after his first pit stop, the drying track forced him to pit again for new tyres: "It was a shame that we made a little mistake on the strategy but it is good to be on the podium."

Sutil expressed his disappointment after being knocked out of the race when he was on course to record his team's first points:

Räikkönen apologised to Sutil for their collision, blaming cold brakes for his loss of control. <a href="Mike%20Gascoyne">Mike Gascoyne</a>, Force India's technical chief, called for the <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23S">stewards</a> to investigate the incident, but after deliberation no action was taken. "The frustration is that if that was a Force India driver hitting a world champion we'd expect to get a one or two-race ban, but the other way round nothing ever seems to happen" said Gascoyne. Sutil was called to the stewards' room and reprimanded for passing three cars under yellow flags on lap 13. Because he had retired, he was issued with merely a warning, but had he finished the race he would have been given a 25-second time penalty, which would have dropped him out of the point-scoring positions.

Hamilton's win was praised by <a href="Jackie%20Stewart">Jackie Stewart</a>, a three-time winner of the <a href="Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco Grand Prix</a>. "At his age, Lewis can win this race many times," he said. "This is the first, I hope, of many victories for him in Monaco so that he can join the greats of Formula One." <a href="Damon%20Hill">Damon Hill</a>, the <a href="1996%20Formula%20One%20season">1996 World Champion</a>, said Hamilton "did very well indeed. I was most impressed, and the race as a whole was also a great advertisement for what F1 should be about." The race result left Hamilton leading the Drivers' Championship with 38 points. Räikkönen, who failed to score in Monaco, was second on 35 points, one point ahead of Massa and three ahead of Kubica. Heidfeld was sixth on 20 points. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari maintained their lead with 69 points, McLaren jumped to second on 53 points, and BMW Sauber dropped to third on 52 points, with 12 races of the season remaining.

2008 Hungarian Grand Prix

The 2008 Hungarian Grand Prix (formally the Formula 1 ING Magyar Nagydíj 2008) was a <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> motor race held on 3 August 2008, at the <a href="Hungaroring">Hungaroring</a> in <a href="Mogyor%C3%B3d">Mogyoród</a>, near <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>, <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>. It was the 11th race of the <a href="2008%20Formula%20One%20season">2008 Formula One season</a>. Contested over 70 laps, the race was won by <a href="Heikki%20Kovalainen">Heikki Kovalainen</a> for the <a href="McLaren">McLaren</a> team, from a second position start. <a href="Timo%20Glock">Timo Glock</a> finished second in a <a href="Toyota%20Racing">Toyota</a> car, with <a href="Kimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen">Kimi Räikkönen</a> third in a <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a>. It was Kovalainen's first Formula One victory, which made him the sport's 100th driver to win a World Championship race, and it was Glock's first podium finish.

The majority of the race consisted of a duel between <a href="Lewis%20Hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> and <a href="Felipe%20Massa">Felipe Massa</a>, who drove for McLaren and Ferrari, respectively. Hamilton started from <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a> but was beaten at the first corner by Massa, who passed him around the outside. The two championship rivals began a battle for the lead that was resolved when Hamilton sustained a <a href="flat%20tire">punctured tyre</a> just over halfway through the race, giving Massa a lead of more than 20 seconds over Kovalainen. The Ferrari's engine, however, failed with three laps remaining, allowing the McLaren driver to win. Räikkönen set the race's <a href="fastest%20lap">fastest lap</a> in the other Ferrari, but was hampered by a poor qualifying performance and was stuck behind <a href="Fernando%20Alonso">Fernando Alonso</a> (<a href="Renault%20in%20Formula%20One">Renault</a>) and Glock in turn for almost all of the race.

As a consequence of the race, Hamilton extended his lead in the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">World Drivers' Championship</a> to five points over Räikkönen, with Massa a further three behind. <a href="Robert%20Kubica">Robert Kubica</a>, who finished eighth after finding his <a href="BMW%20in%20Formula%20One">BMW Sauber</a> car uncompetitive at the Hungaroring, slipped to 13 points behind Hamilton, ahead of teammate <a href="Nick%20Heidfeld">Nick Heidfeld</a> and Kovalainen. In the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Constructors%27%20Champions">World Constructors' Championship</a>, McLaren passed BMW Sauber for second position, 11 points behind Ferrari.

The Grand Prix was contested by 20 drivers in ten teams of two. The teams, also known as "<a href="Formula%20One%23Constructors">constructors</a>", were <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a>, <a href="McLaren">McLaren</a>-<a href="Mercedes%20AMG%20High%20Performance%20Powertrains">Mercedes</a>, <a href="Renault%20in%20Formula%20One">Renault</a>, <a href="Honda%20in%20Formula%20One">Honda</a>, <a href="Force%20India">Force India</a>-Ferrari, <a href="BMW%20in%20Formula%20One">BMW Sauber</a>, <a href="Toyota%20Racing">Toyota</a>, <a href="Red%20Bull%20Racing">Red Bull</a>-Renault, <a href="Williams%20Grand%20Prix%20Engineering">Williams</a>-Toyota and <a href="Scuderia%20Toro%20Rosso">Toro Rosso</a>-Ferrari. Before the race, Ferrari was in the lead of the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Constructors%27%20Champions">Constructors' Championship</a> with 105 points, 16 ahead of BMW Sauber and a further three in front of McLaren. Vying for fourth place were Toyota, Red Bull and Renault, all within two points of each other but more than 60 points behind McLaren. In the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">Drivers' Championship</a>, <a href="Lewis%20Hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> (McLaren) led with 58 <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Championship%20points%20scoring%20systems">points</a>, ahead of Ferrari teammates <a href="Felipe%20Massa">Felipe Massa</a> and <a href="Kimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen">Kimi Räikkönen</a>, who were on 54 and 51 points respectively. BMW drivers <a href="Robert%20Kubica">Robert Kubica</a> (48) and <a href="Nick%20Heidfeld">Nick Heidfeld</a> (41) were fourth and fifth in the championship, followed by <a href="Heikki%20Kovalainen">Heikki Kovalainen</a>, who had scored 28 points in the second McLaren.

Following the <a href="2008%20German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a> on July 20, the teams conducted testing sessions at the <a href="Circuito%20Permanente%20de%20Jerez">Jerez</a> circuit from July 22–25. Each team was limited to of testing during the 2008 calendar year, a reduction compared with previous seasons. <a href="Sebastian%20Vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> (Toro Rosso) set the fastest time of the first and second days, while <a href="Mark%20Webber">Mark Webber</a> (Red Bull) topped the third day's running, and <a href="Heikki%20Kovalainen">Heikki Kovalainen</a> was fastest on the final day of testing. Several teams tested using <a href="Bridgestone">Bridgestone</a> <a href="slick%20tyre">slick tyre</a>s, as preparation for the switch from grooved to slick tyres for the <a href="2009%20Formula%20One%20season">2009 season</a>, and <a href="BMW%20in%20Formula%20One">BMW Sauber</a> tested a <a href="Kinetic%20Energy%20Recovery%20Systems">Kinetic Energy Recovery System</a>, also for the following year. Among the other teams, Force India's test driver, <a href="Vitantonio%20Liuzzi">Vitantonio Liuzzi</a>, tested the team's new "seamless-shift" <a href="Transmission%20%28mechanics%29">gearbox</a> ahead of the system's race début later in the year, while <a href="Timo%20Glock">Timo Glock</a> of Toyota took part after a heavy crash at the German Grand Prix.

In the week leading up to the race, a meeting between the teams at Ferrari's headquarters in <a href="Maranello">Maranello</a> resulted in the formation of a new representative body, the <a href="Formula%20One%20Teams%20Association">Formula One Teams Association</a> (FOTA), which was led by Ferrari president <a href="Luca%20di%20Montezemolo">Luca di Montezemolo</a>. McLaren team principal <a href="Ron%20Dennis">Ron Dennis</a> said the establishment of FOTA was intended to encourage greater co-operation between the teams, particularly in framing new sporting and technical regulations, and to act as a counterweight to the sport's existing governing body, the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile">Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile</a> (FIA) and the company responsible for its commercial management, <a href="Formula%20One%20Management">Formula One Management</a> (FOM).

On July 31, the day before the event's first free practice sessions took place, McLaren confirmed the team would retain Kovalainen for 2009 alongside Hamilton, while the organisers of the Hungarian Grand Prix signed a deal with <a href="Bernie%20Ecclestone">Bernie Ecclestone</a>, the president of FOM, to continue hosting the race until 2016.

Several teams made technical changes to their cars for the Grand Prix. Ferrari altered the <a href="Ferrari%20F2008">F2008</a> chassis's cooling system and bodywork following high brake wear and engine water temperatures at the German Grand Prix. McLaren and Force India introduced revised <a href="aerodynamics">aerodynamic</a> packages for their <a href="McLaren%20MP4-23">MP4-23</a> and <a href="Force%20India%20VJM01">VJM01</a> chassis, aimed at increasing the amount of <a href="downforce">downforce</a>, and therefore grip, produced by the bodywork. Force India also brought its seamless-shift gearbox to the event. Ferrari, Honda and Toyota also débuted raised engine covers, nicknamed "shark-fins" for the way they stretched toward the rear wing, and Honda introduced a new rear suspension package.

The sport's sole tyre supplier, Bridgestone, provided two specifications of grooved dry tyres for the race, designated Soft (also referred to as the "prime" tyre) and Super Soft (also referred to as the "option" tyre). The Super Soft compound was distinguished by a white stripe in one of the tyre's grooves. As was the case for all of the 2008 Grands Prix, the rules stipulated that all cars should use both types of tyre during the course of the race, and each driver was limited to seven sets of dry tyres for the weekend.

Three practice sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday from 10:00 to 11:30 and 14:00 to 15:30 local time, and a third on Saturday morning between 11:00 and 12:00. The first practice session took place in dry conditions. The ambient temperature was between , and the track temperature ranged from during the hour-long period. Massa set the session's fastest time with a lap of 1 minute and 20.981 seconds, almost four-tenths of a second ahead of his teammate Räikkönen. The two McLaren drivers were third and fourth, Kovalainen ahead of Hamilton. <a href="Fernando%20Alonso">Fernando Alonso</a> and <a href="Nelson%20Piquet%20Jr.">Nelson Piquet Jr.</a> set the fifth and eighth-fastest times respectively for Renault; they were separated by Glock and Kubica. Their teammates, Heidfeld and Toyota driver <a href="Jarno%20Trulli">Jarno Trulli</a>, completed the top ten. Vettel's Toro Rosso car was afflicted by a hydraulics problem; this restricted him to completing only four timed laps, and he was slowest overall.

The second practice session was held in similar weather to the first; the only difference was a slightly higher peak track temperature of . During this session, Hamilton set the quickest lap time of the day, a 1:20.554; Kovalainen finished with the third-fastest time. The Renault drivers were again quick—Piquet in second and Alonso fourth—although the team's Executive Director of Engineering, <a href="Pat%20Symonds">Pat Symonds</a>, admitted both cars were running with slightly lower fuel loads than normal, improving their performance. Räikkönen and Massa slipped to fifth and sixth respectively, their best times one-thousandth of a second apart. They were ahead of Heidfeld, Kubica, Trulli and Williams driver <a href="Nico%20Rosberg">Nico Rosberg</a>. Vettel's car was still suffering from the hydraulics problem and he completed just five laps, again setting the slowest time of the session.

Saturday's weather was again dry for the third and final practice session, with ambient temperature between and track temperature from . Hamilton again set the fastest time, a 1:20.228, quicker than his best on Friday. This put him immediately ahead of Massa, Glock, Kovalainen and Piquet. Heidfeld was much happier with the <a href="Racing%20setup">setup</a> of his car and set the sixth-fastest time, but Kubica suffered a mechanical problem that restricted him to 18th position. Vettel had a trouble-free session and set the eighth-fastest time, one position behind teammate <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Bourdais">Sébastien Bourdais</a>. Räikkönen and Rosberg completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.

Saturday afternoon's qualifying session was divided into three parts. In the first 20-minute period, cars finishing 16th or lower were eliminated. The second qualifying period lasted 15 minutes, at the end of which the fastest 10 cars went into the final period to determine their grid positions for the race. Cars failing to make the final period were allowed to be refuelled before the race, but those competing in it were not and carried more fuel than they had done in the earlier qualifying sessions to see them through the first part of the race. The session was held in dry weather slightly hotter than any of the free practice sessions; the ambient temperature ranged between , while track temperature ranged between .

Hamilton set the fastest time in the first and final parts of the session, which clinched him <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a> with a lap of 1:20.899. Although he was pleased with the handling of his McLaren—he said that he had never been more comfortable in the car—he believed that he could have recorded a faster lap, as he made a slight mistake going into Turn Five. Hamilton was joined on the front row by his teammate Kovalainen, who recorded a lap time 0.241 seconds slower and was fuelled for an additional two laps in the race. Massa set the session's fastest time of 1:19.068 during its second part, but was delayed by other cars, which prevented him from heating his tyres sufficiently to achieve the maximum grip possible. He dropped to third overall in the final part of qualifying. Räikkönen was on a heavier fuel load than his teammate but made a mistake on his final flying lap that restricted him to sixth place. That left him behind Kubica and Glock on the grid. Kubica achieved his competitive time despite handling problems, which led him to describe his lap as his best so far of the season, while Glock recorded the best qualifying result of his career thus far. Alonso qualified in seventh position with Piquet in tenth on a heavy fuel load; the Renault teammates were split by Webber and Trulli. As the Soft tyres were expected to perform better in the race than the Super Softs, the McLaren drivers' use of one fewer set of the Soft tyres than their Ferrari counterparts during the qualifying session suggested Hamilton and Kovalainen might have had a tyre performance advantage in the race. This was because the Soft tyre was the fastest tyre choice over the course of a single lap, despite the theoretical performance advantage of the Super Soft; Ferrari used one more set of Soft tyres than McLaren before realising this was the case.

Vettel was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session, qualifying 11th; his best time of 1:20.131 was just over a second slower than Massa's pace in the second session. His teammate, Bourdais, set the 14th-fastest lap, but was penalised five positions on the grid for impeding Heidfeld during the first part of qualifying, a delay which limited the BMW Sauber driver to the 16th-fastest time. The Toro Rosso drivers were split before Bourdais' penalty by <a href="Jenson%20Button">Jenson Button</a>—who found his Honda's revised suspension a significant improvement—and <a href="David%20Coulthard">David Coulthard</a>, who believed the Hungaroring did not suit the handling characteristics of his <a href="Red%20Bull%20RB4">Red Bull RB4</a> chassis. Rosberg made it into the second part of qualifying, but did not complete any laps thereafter after his Williams car developed a hydraulics problem. <a href="Kazuki%20Nakajima">Kazuki Nakajima</a> (Williams), <a href="Rubens%20Barrichello">Rubens Barrichello</a> (Honda) and Force India drivers <a href="Giancarlo%20Fisichella">Giancarlo Fisichella</a> and <a href="Adrian%20Sutil">Adrian Sutil</a> failed to advance beyond the first part of qualifying, and thus completed the final rows of the grid. In the first part of qualifying (the only section in which all drivers took part), the entire field was covered by just under three seconds.

The race took place in the afternoon from 14:00 local time, in dry and sunny weather, with an ambient temperature of between , and a track temperature ranging from . The race-day attendance was 84,000. As usual, the race was broadcast worldwide, with the <a href="Formula%20One%23Television">"World Feed"</a> coverage being produced by FOM. Every driver except Coulthard started on the Soft compound tyres. Massa made a good start on his only remaining new set of Soft tyres, moving ahead of Kovalainen from the grid and drawing alongside Hamilton into the first corner. Hamilton held the inside line for the turn, but Massa braked later than the McLaren driver and passed him around the outside. Behind the leading three in the run down to the first corner, Glock moved ahead of Kubica, while Alonso overtook Räikkönen. Barrichello made the best start in the field, moving from 17th to 13th place at the end of the first lap, while Vettel made a poor start and lost four places over the same distance. At the completion of the first lap, Massa led from Hamilton, Kovalainen, Glock, Kubica, Alonso, Räikkönen, Webber, Trulli, Piquet, Coulthard, Heidfeld, Barrichello, Button, Vettel, Bourdais, Rosberg, Nakajima, Fisichella and Sutil.

Massa and Hamilton immediately began to pull clear of Kovalainen. On lap 3, Button overtook his teammate Barrichello for 13th position, but both Honda drivers were stuck behind Heidfeld, who was carrying a heavier fuel load than them. As the race progressed, Massa began to open a small lead over Hamilton, who put his McLaren into a "fuel-saving mode", attempting to jump ahead of Massa later in the race by making a pit stop after the Ferrari driver. In addition, the high track temperature was to the Ferrari chassis's advantage, as it was easier on its tyres than the McLaren and was able to run them at an <a href="operating%20temperature">operating temperature</a> of up to 10 °C (18 °F) lower, resulting in less tyre wear. By lap 18, Massa had a lead of 3.5 seconds over Hamilton, who in turn was almost 8 seconds ahead of Kovalainen. Glock was a further 3 seconds behind the second McLaren driver, but was drawing ahead of Kubica in fifth, who was finding his BMW Sauber difficult to drive in race conditions with a lack of grip and stability under braking, and was holding up a group of cars behind him.

Massa, Kubica and Webber were the first three drivers to make pit stops by coming in on lap 18. The McLaren mechanics timed Massa's stop to estimate the amount of fuel he received, and when Hamilton made his own first stop on the next lap, they fuelled him to run for three laps longer than the Ferrari in the second stint of the race. Kovalainen took over the lead of the race for two laps before his pit stop on lap 21 returned it to Massa. Piquet was the last of the leading runners to make a pit stop, on lap 25, allowing him to jump ahead of Kubica, Trulli and Webber. Further down the order, Vettel made an unscheduled pit stop on lap 20 and retired two laps later with an overheating engine. By the end of lap 26, all of the leading drivers on two-stop strategies had taken their pit stops. The race order was Massa leading from Hamilton, Kovalainen, Glock, Coulthard (who was yet to pit), Alonso, Räikkönen, Piquet, Trulli, Kubica, Webber, Heidfeld, Button, Barrichello, Bourdais, Rosberg, Nakajima, Fisichella and Sutil.

Hamilton rejoined the race following his first pit stop 2.6 seconds behind Massa, and needed to stay within approximately 3.5 seconds of the Ferrari driver to gain track position after the second round of pit stops. Massa began to pull away again, easing the gap open to 4 seconds by lap 32, while Hamilton locked his front-left wheel as he tried to keep up with the Ferrari, <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23F">flat-spotting</a> the tyre in the process. The two continued to set fastest laps as they pulled away from the rest of the field. On lap 29, Coulthard made his first pit stop, dropping to 12th place as a result. Button, Barrichello, Bourdais, Rosberg, Nakajima, Fisichella and Sutil also made their first pit stops at this stage of the race. Three of these drivers experienced delays during their pit stops which dropped them down the running order: Barrichello and Bourdais suffered flash fires, while Rosberg's fuel hose jammed, losing him time.

At the front of the field, Massa continued to pull away gradually from Hamilton; the gap between the two had risen to 5 seconds by the end of lap 40. On the following lap, Hamilton's front-left tyre <a href="Flat%20tire">deflated</a> approaching Turn Two; the resultant slow lap back to the pit lane and stop for a replacement tyre dropped him to tenth place. Massa now had a 23-second lead over Kovalainen and slowed his pace accordingly, adjusting the performance of the engine to place it under less mechanical stress. He made his final pit stop on lap 44, allowing Kovalainen to take the lead until his own stop four laps later, handing Massa back his lead. On lap 41, Heidfeld made his only pit stop, dropping from 11th to 12th position. In the following laps, the other drivers made their second stops, except Nakajima, who switched to a one-stop strategy at his first visit to his pit box. Behind the leading trio of Massa, Kovalainen and Glock, Räikkönen moved ahead of Alonso despite running off the road just before his pit stop; after he exited the pit lane, Piquet fended off Trulli as they battled for position. The pit stop sequence allowed Hamilton to move back up the order, to sixth place behind Alonso. Further back, Bourdais suffered another flash fire on lap 45, and made another visit to the pit lane one lap later to have <a href="fire%20extinguisher">fire extinguisher</a> foam cleaned off his helmet visor. Rosberg was the final scheduled driver to make a pit stop, on lap 58. The majority of the drivers ran with Soft tyres for the first two stints of the race, then switched to the Super Soft compound for the final stint.

At the conclusion of lap 59, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the running order was Massa leading from Kovalainen, Glock, Räikkönen, Alonso, Hamilton, Piquet, Trulli, Kubica, Webber, Heidfeld, Coulthard, Button, Nakajima, Rosberg, Fisichella, Sutil, Barrichello and Bourdais. Running in <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23C">clean air</a> without a car immediately in front of him for the first time, Räikkönen set the fastest lap of the race at 1:21.195, on lap 61, as he closed the nine-second gap to Glock at a rate of one second per lap. Hamilton caught Alonso at a similar rate, but his rear Super Soft tyres began to overheat and he was unable to make any further impression after closing the gap to 1.5 seconds. On lap 62, Sutil suffered a puncture caused by a brake failure and became the second retirement of the race. In the closing laps, Kovalainen reduced his deficit to Massa to 15 seconds, but the Ferrari driver appeared to be in command of the race. However, as Massa started lap 68, his engine failed without warning, forcing him to retire from the lead with three laps remaining. Kovalainen was thus promoted into the lead, which he held to take the first victory of his Formula One career in a time of 1'37:27.067, at an average speed of . Kovalainen was the 100th driver to win a Formula One World Championship race. Glock likewise claimed the best result of his career, and first podium finish, with second position. Räikkönen took the final place on the podium despite a failure in his car's rear suspension during the final few laps. Alonso and Piquet finished on either side of Hamilton, who was in fifth position, leading Symonds to describe the race as his team's best of the year so far. Trulli finished seventh, ahead of Kubica, who was extremely disappointed with the uncompetitive performance of his car at the Grand Prix closest to his home country of <a href="Poland">Poland</a>. His teammate, Heidfeld, finished in tenth place between the two Red Bull drivers, both of whom were also disappointed by their team's performance. Button, Nakajima, Rosberg and Fisichella filled the next places, a lap behind the leader, while Barrichello was two laps down in 16th position after the delay at his first pit stop. Massa was classified in 17th place, ahead of Bourdais, who was the final finisher.

Although Kovalainen was delighted with his first Formula One victory, he attributed much of the credit for his win to luck. After the race he said, "I feel a bit sorry for Felipe and Lewis. They both drove great races, but I know how it feels when things go wrong—I've had a few similar moments this year. I tried to put pressure on Felipe, especially during the last stint. I felt something might happen if I did that, you never know, but I still found it hard to believe when I saw his Ferrari on fire." As of 2019, the race remains Kovalainen's only Formula One win. Glock was pleased with second position and spoke of how he had dedicated extra training to improve his race starts. He said he had focussed on not making any mistakes in the closing laps as Räikkönen closed, instead of maintaining the gap. Räikkönen described his race as "frustrating and boring" due to the amount of time he spent stuck behind slower cars.

The podium finishers were overshadowed in the media by coverage of the ill fortune of both the weekend's pace-setters, Hamilton and Massa. Massa in particular was praised for his performance. The Ferrari team principal, <a href="Stefano%20Domenicali">Stefano Domenicali</a>, said it was, "the best race of his career. It was fantastic the way he managed the race." Journalist <a href="Mark%20Hughes%20%28journalist%29">Mark Hughes</a> described it as "almost certainly his best race to date", and colleague Simon Arron termed it as "one of the finest afternoons of his F1 career". Both drew attention to his controlled aggression at the first corner of the race, followed by his relentless, mistake-free pace. Arron, in particular, noted that Massa's first-corner passing move was more typical of Hamilton's attacking style than his own, and was a "defining moment" in Massa's championship campaign. Hamilton himself later expressed surprise that Massa had been able to overtake him in such a manner, and warned his rival that "it won't happen again". Hughes described the Grand Prix as "a throwback race", in that the leaders had suffered from unreliability, and the winner had not been in contention on speed alone; It was a situation reminiscent of earlier times in the sport, when the cars were generally less reliable.

Bridgestone director of motorsport <a href="Hirohide%20Hamashima">Hirohide Hamashima</a> said Hamilton's puncture was probably caused by debris, although as a result of the damage the tyre had sustained, the precise nature of the failure was impossible to determine. He also stated that Hamilton's tyre was more vulnerable to debris damage because he had flat-spotted it earlier in the race. Massa said he had no prior indication of his engine failure. The problem was later traced to a <a href="connecting%20rod">connecting rod</a> failure caused by an impurity in the component material. An identical problem caused Räikkönen to retire from the following race, the <a href="2008%20European%20Grand%20Prix">2008 European Grand Prix</a>.

As a consequence of the race, Hamilton extended his lead in the Drivers' Championship to five points ahead of Räikkönen, who moved ahead of Massa in the standings. Kubica maintained fourth place; Kovalainen's win moved him to within three points of Heidfeld in fifth. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari continued to lead, but McLaren jumped ahead of BMW Sauber for second position. Behind Toyota, Renault moved ahead of Red Bull. Despite his increased lead, Hamilton acknowledged that he expected the Ferrari drivers to be formidable opponents in the season's seven remaining races. After the eventual conclusion of the championship in Hamilton's favour by one point, the Hungarian Grand Prix was highlighted as one of Massa's most obvious lost opportunities in his bid to win the title.

2008 Japanese Grand Prix

The 2008 Japanese Grand Prix (formally the XXXIV Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> motor race held on 12 October 2008, at the <a href="Fuji%20Speedway">Fuji Speedway</a>, <a href="Oyama%2C%20Shizuoka">Oyama</a>, Japan. It was the 16th race of the <a href="2008%20Formula%20One%20season">2008 Formula One season</a>. The 67-lap race was won by <a href="Fernando%20Alonso">Fernando Alonso</a> for the <a href="Renault%20F1">Renault</a> team from fourth position on the starting grid. <a href="Robert%20Kubica">Robert Kubica</a> finished second for <a href="BMW%20Sauber">BMW Sauber</a>, and <a href="Kimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen">Kimi Räikkönen</a> third for <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a>.

<a href="Lewis%20Hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a>, the eventual <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">Drivers' Champion</a>, led the Championship going into the race, and started from <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a> alongside Räikkönen. Hamilton's <a href="McLaren%20%28racing%29">McLaren</a> teammate <a href="Heikki%20Kovalainen">Heikki Kovalainen</a> began from third, next to Alonso. At the first corner Hamilton braked late, forcing Räikkönen wide. Hamilton was later given a penalty, and was criticised by the British racing press for overaggressive driving. Ferrari driver <a href="Felipe%20Massa">Felipe Massa</a>, Hamilton's principal Championship rival, was penalised after an incident on lap two in which he touched Hamilton's car, causing it to spin. The incident dropped Hamilton to the back of the field, from where he was unable to regain a <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Championship%20points%20scoring%20systems">points scoring position</a>. Massa later collided with <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Bourdais">Sébastien Bourdais</a> of <a href="Scuderia%20Toro%20Rosso">Toro Rosso</a>. Bourdais was penalised after the race, and demoted from sixth to tenth position. The penalty prompted widespread criticism from the racing media and ex-drivers.

The victory was Alonso's second consecutive win; he started from 15th on the grid to win the <a href="2008%20Singapore%20Grand%20Prix">Singapore Grand Prix</a> two weeks prior. Kubica held off a determined attack from Räikkönen in the closing laps to take second place. Massa's seventh place narrowed his gap to Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship to five points. Ferrari established a seven-point lead over the McLaren team in the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Constructors%27%20Champions">Constructors' Championship</a>, with two races of the season remaining.

The Grand Prix was contested by 20 drivers, in ten teams of two. The teams, also known as "<a href="Formula%20One%23Constructors">constructors</a>", were <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a>, <a href="McLaren%20%28racing%29">McLaren</a>-<a href="Mercedes-Benz%20HighPerformanceEngines">Mercedes</a>, <a href="Renault%20F1">Renault</a>, <a href="Honda%20Racing%20F1">Honda</a>, <a href="Force%20India">Force India</a>, <a href="BMW%20Sauber">BMW Sauber</a>, <a href="Toyota%20F1">Toyota</a>, <a href="Red%20Bull%20Racing">Red Bull Racing</a>, <a href="WilliamsF1">Williams</a> and <a href="Scuderia%20Toro%20Rosso">Toro Rosso</a>.

Prior to the race, McLaren driver <a href="Lewis%20Hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> led the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">Drivers' Championship</a> with 84 <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Championship%20points%20scoring%20systems">points</a>, and Ferrari driver <a href="Felipe%20Massa">Felipe Massa</a> was second with 77 points. Behind them in the Drivers' Championship, <a href="Robert%20Kubica">Robert Kubica</a> was third with 64 points in a BMW Sauber, and Massa's Ferrari teammate <a href="Kimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen">Kimi Räikkönen</a> was fourth with 57 points. Kubica's teammate <a href="Nick%20Heidfeld">Nick Heidfeld</a> was fifth with 56 points. In the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Constructors%27%20Champions">Constructors' Championship</a>, McLaren–Mercedes were leading with 135 points, one point ahead of their rivals Ferrari, whom they had overtaken at the previous race. BMW Sauber were third with 120 points. In the battle for fourth place, Renault had 51 points, five points ahead of Toyota.

A botched <a href="pit%20stop">pit stop</a> at the <a href="2008%20Singapore%20Grand%20Prix">Singapore Grand Prix</a> had demoted Massa from first position to the back of field. With three races remaining in the Championship and a seven-point deficit, Massa remained confident about his title chances: "If you look at what happened to me in Singapore where my gap went from one point to seven so suddenly, then you have to consider it could easily go the other way as well." Hamilton emphasised the value that a conservative racing strategy could hold for his title chances:

<a href="Fernando%20Alonso">Fernando Alonso</a>'s victory at the Singapore Grand Prix was his first Formula One win since rejoining the Renault team, after driving for McLaren in 2007. After qualifying in 15th and making an early pit stop, Alonso had managed to jump to the front of the race when his teammate <a href="Nelson%20Piquet%20Jr.">Nelson Piquet Jr.</a> crashed. Left with no opportunity to pit, the frontrunners had to delay their stops until the damage was cleared, allowing the heavily fuelled Alonso to move to the front once they did so. Though Alonso questioned whether his Renault team could match the pace of Ferrari and McLaren at Fuji, he said "We must remain focussed and try to repeat our level of performance from Singapore to fight at the front." Renault's technical director <a href="Bob%20Bell%20%28motorsport%29">Bob Bell</a> said that the team's improvement from the start of the season was encouraging, but "we recognise that we're not going to overhaul McLaren and Ferrari this season". Bell said that the objective for the last races was to win more Grands Prix and, importantly, secure fourth position in the Constructors' Championship from Toyota.

The <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile">Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile</a> (FIA), the sport's <a href="Sport%20governing%20body">governing body</a>, launched the Formula One component of their <a href="Make%20Cars%20Green">Make Cars Green</a> campaign at the Japanese Grand Prix. For the weekend, the grooves in the <a href="Formula%20One%20tyres">tyres</a> were painted green to promote <a href="environmentally%20friendly">environmentally friendly</a> driving. FIA president <a href="Max%20Mosley">Max Mosley</a> said "The FIA is determined to ensure that future investment in motor sport will also help drive the development of technologies that will benefit the public at large." As is normal for a Formula One race, <a href="Bridgestone">Bridgestone</a> brought two different tyre compounds to the race; the softer of the two marked by a single white stripe down one of the grooves.
Three practice sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and a third on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90 minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. The Friday sessions were held in dry and sunny conditions. Hamilton was quickest in the first session, with a time of 1:18.910 that was less than two-tenths of a second faster than Massa. McLaren driver <a href="Heikki%20Kovalainen">Heikki Kovalainen</a> was just off Massa's pace; Räikkönen, Alonso and Piquet rounded out the top six, still within a second of Hamilton's time. In the second practice session, <a href="Timo%20Glock">Timo Glock</a>, of Toyota, was fastest with a time of 1:18.383, ahead of Alonso, Hamilton, Massa, Räikkönen and Red Bull driver <a href="Mark%20Webber">Mark Webber</a>. The top seventeen drivers set times within a second of Glock's fastest lap, indicating a competitive field. The Saturday morning session was held on a damp track, where grip was poor and many drivers were forced to use the <a href="run-off%20area">run-off area</a>s after sliding off the track. Kubica was quickest with his final lap of the session at 1:25.087; Glock, Piquet, <a href="Nick%20Heidfeld">Nick Heidfeld</a> of BMW, <a href="Kazuki%20Nakajima">Kazuki Nakajima</a> of Williams, Red Bull driver <a href="David%20Coulthard">David Coulthard</a>, and Massa rounded out the top seven positions. Hamilton managed only eleventh, but was ahead of Kovalainen and Räikkönen, in 16th and 17th positions, respectively. Both <a href="Adrian%20Sutil">Adrian Sutil</a> and <a href="Giancarlo%20Fisichella">Giancarlo Fisichella</a> of Force India spent most of the session in their garage, suffering numerous mechanical problems.

The qualifying session on Saturday afternoon was split into three parts. The first part ran for 20 minutes, and cars that finished the session 16th or lower were eliminated from qualifying. The second part of qualifying lasted 15 minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions 11 to 15. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a>. Cars which failed to make the final session could refuel before the race, so ran lighter in those sessions. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying were not allowed to refuel before the race, and as such carried more fuel than in the previous sessions.

Hamilton clinched his sixth pole position of the season with a lap time of 1:18.404. He was joined on the front row by Räikkönen, who was fastest for most of the final session. Provisionally sitting in third as the session drew to a close, Massa was pushed back to fifth as Kovalainen and Alonso put in last-minute laps to fill the second row of the grid. Kubica took sixth place, ahead of both Toyota cars of <a href="Jarno%20Trulli">Jarno Trulli</a> and Glock and the Toro Rossos of <a href="Sebastian%20Vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> and <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Bourdais">Sébastien Bourdais</a>. Coulthard bettered teammate Webber when he qualified 11th; Piquet split the Red Bull drivers in 12th. The only Japanese driver in the field, Nakajima, managed 14th ahead of his Williams teammate <a href="Nico%20Rosberg">Nico Rosberg</a>. Heidfeld could only achieve 16th place, ten places behind his BMW teammate Kubica. Heidfeld spent the majority of the first session struggling with the <a href="racing%20setup">set-up</a> of his car. The Honda cars of <a href="Rubens%20Barrichello">Rubens Barrichello</a> and <a href="Jenson%20Button">Jenson Button</a> filled the ninth row in front of the constructor's home crowd. The Force Indias qualified last; Sutil comfortably outqualified his teammate Fisichella by 0.8 seconds, to sit in 19th place.
The conditions on the grid were dry before the race. The <a href="air%20temperature">air temperature</a> was and the track temperature was ; conditions were expected to remain consistent throughout the race. Most of the frontrunners began the race on the harder compound tyre; only Massa was using the softer option. Räikkönen accelerated faster than Hamilton off the line, getting ahead of him down the first straight, but the McLaren driver pulled into the Ferrari's <a href="Drafting%20%28aerodynamics%29">slipstream</a>, before swerving to overtake Räikkönen in the inside of the corner. Going into the first corner, Hamilton badly locked-up his front wheels while braking and ran wide; although there was no contact, Räikkönen was also forced wide in avoidance. This was then followed by contact with Kovalainen, which finally forced Räikkönen off the track. All three drivers dropped back down the field as a result of the incident. Kubica took the lead ahead of Alonso and Kovalainen after the corner, avoiding collisions as other cars locked their tyres on the cold track. Fisichella drove into the back of Barrichello, scattering <a href="Carbon%20fiber%20reinforced%20polymer">carbon fibre</a> over the track. Coulthard collided with Bourdais and then Piquet, sustaining suspension damage and sliding into the barriers after turn two. Nakajima left the track trying to avoid Coulthard, although he managed to rejoin after losing his <a href="Formula%20One%20car%23Wings">front wing</a>. The Japanese driver made a <a href="pit%20stop">pit stop</a> at the end of the lap for a new wing.

At the end of the first lap, Kubica led from Alonso, Kovalainen, Trulli, Massa, Hamilton and Räikkönen. On lap two, Massa braked late into the chicane at turn 10, briefly letting Hamilton past, before running over the kerbs on the exit from the corner and hitting the McLaren driver's car. Hamilton was spun round by the contact and made a pit stop at the end of the lap for new tyres and more fuel, which dropped him to 18th place. Massa continued in seventh place. On lap eight Räikkönen passed Trulli into turn 10 to take fourth position. In third place, more than a second ahead of the Ferrari driver, Kovalainen set a new <a href="fastest%20lap">fastest lap</a> of 1:19.258 on lap 12 to which Räikkönen responded with a 1:19.193 four laps later. Two more drivers joined Coulthard in retirement before the first round of fuel stops: Glock made a pit stop on lap five and again on lap six, before retiring because of handling difficulties resulting from a broken seat fixing; Sutil retired on lap nine with a <a href="wikt%3Apuncture">puncture</a> caused by running over carbon fibre shards.

On lap 17, Massa and Hamilton were given <a href="Formula%20One%20regulations%23Penalties">drive-through penalties</a>, Massa for colliding with Hamilton and Hamilton for forcing Räikkönen off the track into turn one. Hamilton took his penalty immediately. Massa made a pit stop for fuel and tyres on the next lap, before coming into the pit lane again on lap 20 to serve his penalty, which dropped him to 14th place, one place ahead of Hamilton. Meanwhile, Kubica and Räikkönen made pit stops on lap 17 for tyres and fuel. On the same lap, Kovalainen pulled over to the side of the track with engine problems and retired from the race. Alonso made a pit stop on lap 18, emerging ahead of Kubica to take the provisional lead, with cars in front still to pit. Trulli, Vettel and Bourdais made pit stops over the following six laps. Fisichella retired from the race with gearbox problems on lap 21. Piquet took his first pit stop on lap 28, emerging ahead of Bourdais as Alonso opened the gap on Kubica to 7.8 seconds. Massa overtook Button to take 12th position one lap later.

Alonso lapped consistently in the low 1:19 range, setting the new fastest lap of the race on lap 41, a 1:19.101, to extend his lead over Kubica to more than 12 seconds. Räikkönen was five seconds behind Kubica in third. Alonso made a pit stop for the second time on lap 43 and changed to the softer compound tyre. Kubica, complaining of <a href="understeer">understeer</a> over the team radio, made his second stop on lap 46, two laps ahead of Räikkönen. Trulli, Bourdais, Vettel and Piquet made pit stops over the next five laps, their teams giving them sufficient fuel to finish the race. As Bourdais exited the pit-lane in seventh place on lap 51, Massa, who was eighth, but yet to make his final pit stop, attempted to pass him and the two cars collided at the first corner. Massa spun, but rejoined the race behind Bourdais. Three laps later, the stewards announced that they were investigating the incident, and would make their decision after the race. On lap 52, Räikkönen attempted to pass Kubica on the approach to turn one after <a href="Drafting%20%28aerodynamics%29">drafting</a> behind him up the straight, but Kubica drove right as a blocking manoeuvre, braked late, and defended his position. On the following lap Kubica attempted to replicate his block, but Räikkönen <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23O">out-braked</a> him into turn one, and the two drew alongside. Kubica held the inside line on the turn three left-hander, and drove the <a href="racing%20line">racing line</a> as Räikkönen left the track at the <a href="run-off%20area">run-off area</a>. Räikkönen then rejoined behind the BMW driver. Kubica faced similar challenges from Räikkönen over the next two laps into turn one, but he successfully defended his position.

Massa made a pit stop on lap 53, and rejoined behind Heidfeld in tenth. He subsequently set the fastest lap of the race on lap 55, a 1:18.426. Meanwhile, Piquet was able to close the gap on Räikkönen to under a second, before losing time by running wide at turn five on lap 60. Massa passed Heidfeld for ninth on the same lap, and began closing in on Webber. On lap 65, Massa drafted down the straight and attempted to pass Webber, who defended his position by driving to the right. Crossing the track boundary into the end of the pit-lane, Massa managed to pass Webber, and out-braked him into turn one, to take eighth place. Alonso crossed the finish line on lap 67 to take his second win of the season, five seconds ahead of Kubica. Räikkönen was third, ahead of Piquet, Trulli, Bourdais, Vettel and Massa. Webber took ninth on the line, ahead of Heidfeld, who struggled with a heavy car and failed to improve on a poor qualifying performance. Rosberg finished in front of Hamilton, in 11th. Barrichello and Button took the next two positions; both drivers blamed their Honda cars for their uncompetitive performance at the Fuji circuit. Nakajima finished last, in 15th, unable to recover after his forced pit-stop early in the race.
The top three finishers appeared in the subsequent <a href="press%20conference">press conference</a> where Alonso said that the decision to run a shorter second <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23S">stint</a> than Kubica (between the first and second pit stops) was his decision: "Sometimes you can do it, sometimes you can't but today the car was perfect and I was able to do it." Alonso added that he had confidence in the car to perform at the remaining Grands Prix: "The feeling I have now is that we can do anything". Kubica said that his second-placed finish was better than his win at the <a href="2008%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix">Canadian Grand Prix</a> earlier in the season. He added that to finish on the podium after BMW Sauber's failure to improve the car from the beginning of the season was a "great result for the team in, I think, a very difficult moment". Räikkönen said that he was "a bit disappointed because being in first place in the first corner but then being pushed out didn't help and being in the front could have given us a better result but anyhow, that's racing". He added that Kovalainen's impact with him at the first corner had caused handling difficulties in his car, which left him unable to improve on his third-placed finish.

Forty minutes after the race, Bourdais received a 25-second penalty from the stewards for his collision with Massa on lap 50. This demoted him from sixth to tenth, and promoted Massa to seventh, giving him one more Championship point. Bourdais blamed Massa for the incident:

Massa denied responsibility, and agreed with the stewards' decision: "I think there's little to say: I had already entered the turn and he hit me from behind, spinning me round." The penalty was largely criticized in the media. GrandPrix.com called the penalty "bizarre", saying that Bourdais "could not just disappear". <a href="James%20Allen%20%28Formula%20One%20commentator%29">James Allen</a> of <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> said that in light of FIA race director <a href="Charlie%20Whiting">Charlie Whiting's</a> announcement prior to the race, which indicated that cars exiting the pit-lane would have <a href="Priority%20%28right%20of%20way%29">right of way</a>, the penalty was "ridiculous". French sporting newspaper "<a href="L%27%C3%89quipe">L'Équipe</a>" criticized the stewards for their intervention, saying that both drivers held their lines and the collision was just a racing incident. <a href="Mark%20Blundell">Mark Blundell</a>, who drove in Formula One for five years, called for former drivers to be part of the stewards meetings which award penalties: "You can examine pieces of paper, graphs, telemetry, but you don't know what's going on in a driver's brain until you've experienced it." Blundell's suggestion eventually became fact - the 2010 season introduced a system whereby a former F1 driver acted as a steward during each Grand Prix.

Lewis Hamilton was criticized for his aggressive drive into the first corner by much of the British press. <a href="Edward%20Gorman">Edward Gorman</a> of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" described Hamilton's move as "impetuosity and untamed aggression", adding that Hamilton "gambled with a kamikaze attempt to get past Räikkönen". The <a href="BBC">BBC's</a> Andrew Benson said that "Hamilton is still in a strong position but the Englishman will have to cut out the mistakes that have characterised his season if he is not to lose the championship for the second year in a row." In Italy, "<a href="La%20Gazzetta%20dello%20Sport">La Gazzetta dello Sport</a>" said that Hamilton's start suffered from "his usual excessive aggression". Hamilton said "I made a mistake and I paid for it."

Massa's touch on Hamilton's car on lap two was labelled by the McLaren driver "as deliberate as it could be". Massa rejected the allegation, saying "I had two wheels on the gravel. I could not stop the car and I was on the gravel because he pushed me into the gravel." Media coverage of the incident suggested that though the contact was Massa's fault, it was unintentional. Simon Arron, writing for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>", said Hamilton's accusation of deliberate contact was "unworthy and unwise", adding that the contact was simply a racing incident. The gap between the drivers in the Drivers' Championship after the race stood at five points, in Hamilton's favour, with two races remaining. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's failure to score points, combined with Ferrari's third and seventh, moved Ferrari to a seven-point lead.

2008 Brazilian Grand Prix

The 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix (formally the XXXVII Grande Prêmio do Brasil) was a <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> motor race held on 2 November 2008 at the <a href="Aut%C3%B3dromo%20Jos%C3%A9%20Carlos%20Pace">Autódromo José Carlos Pace</a>, <a href="Interlagos">Interlagos</a>, in <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>. It was the 18th and final race of the <a href="2008%20Formula%20One%20season">2008 Formula One season</a>. The 71-lap race was won by <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a> driver <a href="Felipe%20Massa">Felipe Massa</a> after starting from <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a>; this was the last of Massa's 11 wins. <a href="Fernando%20Alonso">Fernando Alonso</a> finished second in a <a href="Renault%20F1">Renault</a>, and <a href="Kimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen">Kimi Räikkönen</a> third in a Ferrari.

Massa started the race alongside <a href="Toyota%20Racing">Toyota</a> driver <a href="Jarno%20Trulli">Jarno Trulli</a>. Massa's teammate Räikkönen began from third next to <a href="McLaren%20%28racing%29">McLaren</a> driver <a href="Lewis%20Hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a>. Rain fell minutes before the race, delaying the start, and as the track dried Massa established a lead of several seconds. More rain late in the race made the last few laps treacherous for the drivers, but could not prevent Massa from winning the Grand Prix. <a href="Sebastian%20Vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> of <a href="Scuderia%20Toro%20Rosso">Toro Rosso</a> finished in fourth place behind Alonso and Räikkönen. Hamilton passed Toyota's <a href="Timo%20Glock">Timo Glock</a> in the final corners of the race to finish fifth, securing him the points needed to take the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">Drivers' Championship</a>.

Hamilton received praise from many in the Formula One community, including former champions <a href="Damon%20Hill">Damon Hill</a> and <a href="Michael%20Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a>. The McLaren driver also received official congratulations from Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> and <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British prime minister</a> <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a>. Massa's win and Räikkönen's third place helped Ferrari win the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Constructors%27%20Champions">Constructors' Championship</a>. The Grand Prix was <a href="David%20Coulthard">David Coulthard</a>'s final race; the Scot retired after 246 race starts.

Heading into the final race of the season, <a href="McLaren%20%28racing%29">McLaren</a> driver <a href="Lewis%20Hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> was leading the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">Drivers' Championship</a> with 94 <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Championship%20points%20scoring%20systems">points</a>; <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a> driver <a href="Felipe%20Massa">Felipe Massa</a> was second with 87 points, seven points behind Hamilton. A maximum of ten points were available for the final race, which meant that Massa could still win the title if Hamilton finished in sixth place or lower. Otherwise, Hamilton would be champion. In the event of a points tie, Massa would win the championship on a count-back, having more wins. Behind Hamilton and Massa in the Drivers' Championship, <a href="Robert%20Kubica">Robert Kubica</a> was third with 75 points in a <a href="BMW%20Sauber">BMW</a>, and Massa's Ferrari teammate <a href="Kimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen">Kimi Räikkönen</a> was fourth with 69 points. In the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Constructors%27%20Champions">Constructors' Championship</a>, Ferrari were leading with 156 points and McLaren–<a href="Mercedes-Benz%20HighPerformanceEngines">Mercedes</a> were second with 145 points, 11 points behind, with a maximum of 18 points available. If the two Ferrari drivers finished in the top six, the team would secure the Constructors' Championship, even if the McLaren drivers were to finish as the top two. Prior to this race, Hamilton was criticised by many pundits for not keeping a cool head at the <a href="2008%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">2008 Japanese Grand Prix</a>. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" columnist Edward Gorman said that Hamilton should win the championship, but:

Former Formula One team owner <a href="Eddie%20Jordan">Eddie Jordan</a> created controversy when he said that "if Massa tries to take him out as he did in Japan in order to steal the title then Lewis has to be ready for it," adding "If he tries that on then Lewis has to turn his wheel into Massa to ensure he does not finish the race either – he has to take his wheel off." Both Hamilton and Massa rejected the comments; Massa said "Playing dirty has never been part of my game. I don't want anything to do with it. The only thing on my mind is winning the race."

The weekend marked <a href="David%20Coulthard">David Coulthard</a>'s final race. Coulthard's <a href="Red%20Bull%20RB4">Red Bull RB4</a> was decorated in the colours of "Wings for Life", a <a href="Charitable%20organization">charity</a> dedicated to raising awareness of <a href="Spinal%20cord%20injury">spinal cord injuries</a>. Coulthard said "I'm dedicating my last race to the vision of making <a href="paraplegia">paraplegia</a> curable". <a href="Red%20Bull%20Racing">Red Bull Racing</a> received approval from the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile">Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile</a>, Formula One's <a href="Sport%20governing%20body">governing body</a>, to run Coulthard's car in different colours than his teammate <a href="Mark%20Webber">Mark Webber</a>. This was also the last Formula One race broadcast by <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> in the United Kingdom and <a href="Telecinco">Telecinco</a> in Spain; the rights went to the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> and <a href="La%20Sexta">La Sexta</a>, respectively, for 2009. Also, this was the last race for the <a href="Honda%20Racing%20F1">Honda</a> team before they announced that they would pull out of F1 due to the <a href="Financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932010">global economic crisis</a>.

Three practice sessions were held before the race; the first on Friday morning and the second on Friday afternoon. Both sessions lasted 90 minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. The two sessions on Friday were affected by occasionally damp conditions, which made the track moderately slippery. Massa was quickest with a time of 1:12.305 in the first session, less than two-tenths of a second faster than Hamilton. Räikkönen was just off Hamilton's pace, followed by Kubica, <a href="Heikki%20Kovalainen">Heikki Kovalainen</a>, and <a href="Fernando%20Alonso">Fernando Alonso</a>. Webber was seventh, still within a second of Massa's time. In the second practice session, Alonso was fastest with a time of 1:12.296, less than six-hundredths of a second quicker than second-placed Massa. <a href="Jarno%20Trulli">Jarno Trulli</a> took third place, ahead of Räikkönen, Webber and <a href="Sebastian%20Vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a>. Hamilton only managed ninth place, locking his McLaren's wheels and struggling for grip. Kovalainen was only quick enough for fifteenth position. The Saturday morning session was held on a much warmer track, which reached temperatures as high as . Alonso was again quickest, posting a time of 1:12.141, narrowly faster than both McLaren drivers. Massa, Vettel, and <a href="Nick%20Heidfeld">Nick Heidfeld</a> rounded out the top six positions. Räikkönen only managed twelfth, failing to improve on his times set early in the session.

The qualifying session on Saturday afternoon was split into three parts. The first part ran for 20 minutes and eliminated the cars from qualifying that finished the session 16th or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted 15 minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions 11 to 15. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a>. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying were not allowed to refuel before the race, and as such carried more fuel than in the previous sessions.

Massa clinched his sixth <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a> for the season, and his third consecutive pole at Interlagos, with a time of 1:12.368. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Trulli, in his best qualifying performance of the season. Räikkönen qualified third, though he was happy with beginning the race on the <a href="racing%20line">racing line</a> behind his teammate. Hamilton qualified fourth, half a second behind Massa, having battled both Ferrari drivers for time during the first two qualifying sessions. Hamilton's slow pace in the final qualifying session compared to the first two suggested he was carrying more fuel than his title challengers. Hamilton's teammate Kovalainen qualified fifth. Alonso, Vettel, Heidfeld, <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Bourdais">Sébastien Bourdais</a> and <a href="Timo%20Glock">Timo Glock</a> rounded out the top ten. Kubica only managed 13th, having struggled with overall grip for much of the day. Coulthard, in his final Formula One race, qualified 14th; <a href="Rubens%20Barrichello">Rubens Barrichello</a>, in 15th, was quicker than <a href="Honda%20Racing%20F1">Honda</a> teammate <a href="Jenson%20Button">Jenson Button</a> in 17th. The Williams and <a href="Force%20India">Force India</a> drivers qualified at the back of the grid, covering positions 16 to 20 with Button.

The conditions on the grid were damp before the race, the <a href="air%20temperature">air temperature</a> at ; rain or thunderstorms were expected. The race was due to begin at 15:00 <a href="Time%20in%20Brazil">local time</a> (<a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a>-2), but was delayed by ten minutes when heavy rain hit the track at 14:56. Every team but one changed the tyres on both their cars from <a href="Formula%20One%20tyres">dry-weather tyres</a> to <a href="Rain%20tyre%23Intermediate%20tyres">intermediate tyres</a>. Kubica's car was the exception, remaining on the dry set-up. Following the formation lap, Kubica returned to the pit lane, his team changing the car's tyres to intermediates. This meant the <a href="Poland">Polish</a> driver would start the race from the pit-lane.

Massa retained his pole position lead into the first corner, followed by Trulli, Räikkönen, Hamilton and Kovalainen. Coulthard was hit from behind by <a href="Nico%20Rosberg">Nico Rosberg</a> into turn two, spinning him around. The <a href="Red%20Bull%20Racing">Red Bull</a> car then collided with Rosberg's Williams teammate <a href="Kazuki%20Nakajima">Kazuki Nakajima</a>. This damaged the suspension and forced Coulthard to retire in his final race. Piquet spun off at the next corner, his car hitting the barriers. Kovalainen was passed by Alonso and Vettel mid-lap, dropping him to seventh. The accidents of Coulthard and Piquet prompted the deployment of the <a href="safety%20car%23Formula%20One">safety car</a> at the end of the first lap. The track conditions began to dry early on; Force India's <a href="Giancarlo%20Fisichella">Giancarlo Fisichella</a> was the first driver to stop for dry-weather tyres, <a href="pit%20stop%23Formula%20One">pitting</a> at the end of lap two. He remained in 18th position. Racing resumed on lap five when the safety car pulled into the pit-lane. Rosberg and Button both made pit stops on lap seven, each changing to dry-weather tyres. Bourdais, Glock, <a href="Adrian%20Sutil">Adrian Sutil</a> and Nakajima followed a lap later. By lap 11, the rest of the field had changed to dry-weather tyres. Fisichella benefited from pitting the earliest for dry tyres, moving up the order to a high of fifth position.

Nakajima spun on lap 13, losing five seconds on the lap. On lap 15, Massa set a new fastest lap of 1:16.888, and extended his lead over Vettel. Hamilton remained behind Fisichella, and though his McLaren car appeared quicker, he was unable to pass the Force India driver until lap 18. Glock passed Fisichella two laps later. Trulli and Bourdais collided on lap 20 into turn one, sending the Toro Rosso driver across the grass. Bourdais lost six places and rejoined in 13th place. Trulli's Toyota teammate, Timo Glock, passed Fisichella later on in the same lap for sixth. Massa and Sebastian Vettel traded fastest lap times; Vettel's 1:14.214 on lap 25 was surpassed by Massa's 1:14.161 a lap later. However, Vettel made a pit stop soon after, having been lighter-fuelled than his Ferrari opponent. He rejoined in sixth position, behind Glock. Kovalainen passed Trulli and Fisichella in separate manoeuvres, gaining seventh position. On lap 36 Massa set the fastest lap of the race, a 1:13.736.

Timo Glock was fuelled so he could complete the race without stopping again, when he made a pit stop on lap 36. Massa was the first of the championship frontrunners to pit, on lap 38; Alonso and Hamilton made pit stops two laps after. When Räikkönen made a pit stop on lap 43, Massa had regained the lead, ahead of Alonso. Räikkönen rejoined ahead of Hamilton in third place. Fisichella's stop was marred by <a href="Formula%20one%20car%23Transmission">transmission</a> problems, dropping him to 18th position when he resumed. Vettel made a pit stop again on lap 51, his team fuelling him to the finish. He rejoined in fifth. By lap 54, Massa had extended his already comfortable lead over Alonso to 9.6 seconds. Vettel was closing in quickly on Hamilton, the McLaren driver needing to finish no lower than fifth to win the championship.

Light rain began to fall on lap 63. Heidfeld made a pit stop and his BMW <a href="Pit%20stop%23F1%20pit%20crew%20roles">pit crew</a> changed his tyres to intermediates, echoing their strategy at the <a href="2008%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">Belgian Grand Prix</a> which had granted the German a podium position. Kovalainen made a pit stop on lap 65; Alonso and Räikkönen made a pit stop a lap later. Hamilton and Vettel halted their battle for fourth position when they came into the pit lane to change onto intermediate tyres on lap 66. Glock chose to remain on his dry-weather tyres and rose from seventh to fourth place as those ahead of him made pit stops. Massa made a pit stop on lap 67, meaning that all of the frontrunners, with the exception of Glock, were now on intermediate tyres. The rain began to fall heavily on lap 69, as Hamilton ran wide, which allowed Vettel to take fifth position. As Massa crossed the finish line to win the race, Hamilton battled Vettel for the crucial point needed to win the championship. However, Vettel and Hamilton passed Glock in the final corners, the Toyota driver struggling for grip as his dry-weather tyres slid on the wet track. Premature joy in the Ferrari garage soon turned to disappointment as Hamilton finished the race in fifth position, clinching the championship by a single point and becoming Formula One's <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions%23Youngest%20Drivers%27%20Champion">youngest championship winner</a> until Vettel in 2010. Räikkönen's third-place finish behind Alonso was enough to secure Ferrari the constructors' title. After the race, one of the Honda cars caught fire.

The top three finishers appeared on the <a href="Podium%23Usage%20in%20motorsport">podium</a> and in the subsequent <a href="press%20conference">press conference</a>. Massa said that he had "almost done everything perfectly", and expressed his disappointment that despite winning the race he had not won the championship. However, he gave his congratulations to Hamilton for his title win:

Massa's Ferrari teammate Kimi Räikkönen expressed disappointment in the outcome of the Drivers' Championship, but acknowledged the support of his team, saying "we won at least the team championship". Ferrari president <a href="Luca%20di%20Montezemolo">Luca di Montezemolo</a> was reportedly so angry with the result, however, that he destroyed the television he was viewing the race on. McLaren boss <a href="Ron%20Dennis">Ron Dennis</a> praised Hamilton, saying "He just keeps delivering and, at the end of the day, he's just two years into his career. So there's a long way to go."

Hamilton received official congratulations from Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>, following similar plaudits from <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British prime minister</a> <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a> and <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Opposition Leader</a> <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a>. Former Formula One champions also congratulated Hamilton; <a href="1996%20Formula%20One%20season">1996 champion</a> <a href="Damon%20Hill">Damon Hill</a> called the McLaren driver "one of the greatest drivers we have had in this country". Multiple champion <a href="Michael%20Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> praised both Hamilton and Massa, saying the Ferrari driver's performance indicated his winning abilities. Massa was praised for his <a href="sportsmanship">sportsmanship</a> after the race; <a href="Joe%20Saward">Joe Saward</a> of GrandPrix.com said "He took defeat with a grace and a style that one rarely sees in modern sport."

However, Eddie Jordan said that Hamilton "didn't really give himself the best chance of winning the championship – and was very lucky". The former team boss called McLaren's strategy "a disaster". GrandPrix.com expressed disbelief in the outcome: "It was a showdown so improbable that even Hollywood would not have made a film of it. The scriptwriters would have been laughed out of the studios." <a href="Autosport">Autosport</a> magazine writer Adam Cooper called the race "epic". After considering other Formula One title finales, Cooper concluded "nothing has ever matched what we saw [in Brazil]".

Timo Glock remained certain the decision to stay on dry-weather tyres, when other teams were pitting for wet-weather tyres, was a correct one: "We were running seventh before the rain came and we would have probably finished there if it had been totally dry. Instead we finished sixth so that shows the strategy was the right one." Glock added that the conditions were so poor "I didn't even know that Lewis had overtaken me until after the race".

Kubica's finish in 11th position meant that he lost third place in the championship to Räikkönen. After the race, Kubica said "We made too many mistakes during the weekend and this is the result." His team said that they had received the wrong information about track conditions at the start of the race, which led them to keep the Polish driver's car on dry-weather tyres when the rest of the field had changed to intermediates.

David Coulthard expressed his disappointment in his early exit from his final Formula One race, saying that "I'm pretty gutted, it's not how I wanted to end my career." The Scottish driver said that he had planned to perform <a href="Doughnut%20%28driving%29">doughnuts</a> for the crowd, a celebration discouraged in Formula One. Coulthard left Formula One after 15 years with 246 race starts and 13 wins. Red Bull team principal <a href="Christian%20Horner">Christian Horner</a> said "It's a great shame for David to be eliminated from his last Grand Prix at the first corner, but he can look back on a long and illustrious career where he's achieved a great deal." Coulthard continued to work for Red Bull Racing in <a href="2009%20Formula%20One%20season">2009</a> as a testing and development consultant.

Name-letter effect

The name-letter effect is the tendency of people to prefer the <a href="letter%20%28alphabet%29">letters</a> in their <a href="personal%20name">name</a> over other letters in the <a href="alphabet">alphabet</a>. Whether <a href="Human%20subject%20research">subjects</a> are asked to rank all letters of the alphabet, rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out of a set of two, or pick a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like the letters in their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.

Discovered in 1985 by the Belgian <a href="psychologist">psychologist</a> <a href="Jozef%20Nuttin">Jozef Nuttin</a>, the name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across age and gender. People who changed their names many years ago tend to prefer the letters of both their current and original names over non-name letters. The effect is most prominent for <a href="initial">initial</a>s, but even when initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both <a href="given%20name">given</a> and <a href="surname">family names</a> still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.

Most people <a href="self-esteem">like themselves</a>; the name is associated with the <a href="psychology%20of%20self">self</a>, and hence the letters of the name are preferred, despite the fact that they appear in many other words. People who <a href="self-hatred">do not like themselves</a> tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to <a href="birthday">birthday</a>s: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as <a href="mere-exposure%20effect">frequent exposure</a> and early mastery, have been ruled out. In <a href="Psychological%20evaluation">psychological assessments</a>, the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate <a href="implicit%20self-esteem">implicit self-esteem</a>.

There is some evidence that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor <a href="brand">brand</a>s matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately large number of people donate to <a href="disaster%20relief">disaster relief</a> following <a href="hurricane">hurricane</a>s with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.

Systematic interest in the letter preference began in 1959 with <a href="brand%20preference">brand-preference</a> studies by researchers Mecherikoff and Horton. These tried to find the relative appeal of <a href="letter%20%28alphabet%29">letter</a>s for use in package labels. In an extension of the studies, <a href="Human%20subject%20research">subjects</a> were asked to rank the <a href="English%20alphabet">English alphabet</a> by the pleasantness of the appearance of <a href="letter%20case">capital letter</a>s. While there was not a great deal of agreement amongst the subjects (the <a href="coefficient%20of%20concordance">coefficients of concordance</a> were low), a strong <a href="positive%20correlation">positive correlation</a> was found between a letter's average rank and how <a href="frequency%20of%20letters">frequently</a> it occurred as an initial letter of family names.

<a href="Robert%20Zajonc">Robert Zajonc</a>, a <a href="social%20psychologist">social psychologist</a>, published research in 1968 into preferences between pairs of <a href="word">word</a>s (e.g. "on" or "off"): in the overwhelming majority of trials the preferred word was also the most common. Zajonc also tested preferences for <a href="nonsense%20word">nonsense word</a>s and found that people liked them the more they heard them. He interpreted these results as evidence that <a href="mere%20exposure%20effect">mere repeated exposure</a> to a <a href="stimulus%20%28psychology%29">stimulus</a> is sufficient to enhance its attractiveness.

Around 1977, Belgian <a href="experimental%20psychologist">experimental psychologist</a> <a href="Jozef%20Nuttin">Jozef Nuttin</a> was driving on a highway looking at <a href="license%20plate">license plate</a>s when he noticed that he preferred plates containing letters from his own name. He wondered if people in general would prefer stimuli that are somehow connected to them; a "mere belongingness" as opposed to Zajonc's mere exposure.

In his lab at the <a href="Katholieke%20Universiteit%20Leuven">Katholieke Universiteit Leuven</a>, Nuttin <a href="Design%20of%20experiments">designed experiments</a> to test the <a href="hypothesis">hypothesis</a> that people place a higher value on letters that feature in their name. It was crucial to the experimental design to rule out other factors, particularly mere exposure. If letters in a name are also letters that occur with higher frequency, then a preference for one's own letters might arise from the mere-exposure effect.

To find an effect which ruled out mere exposure, Nuttin created a <a href="yoked%20control%20design">yoked control design</a> in which two subjects evaluated the same letters separately. Some of the letters belonged to one subject's name, and some of the letters belonged to the other subject's name, while some were random. In this design, any difference in preference between subjects would have to be based on whether the letter occurred in their name.

For example, take the fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs as shown in the table. The first stimulus is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. As can be seen in the table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would have been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.

In the first trial, 38 <a href="Flemish">Dutch-speaking</a> local <a href="primary%20school">elementary school</a> girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant preference for the letters of one's own name over those of the other person was found. The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last. All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out. No <a href="significant%20difference">significant difference</a> was found using family name rather than first name or both names. While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent <a href="data%20analysis">data analysis</a> revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.

Nuttin concluded that the experiments showed that, independent of visual, <a href="psychoacoustics">acoustical</a>, <a href="applied%20aesthetics">aesthetic</a>, <a href="semantics">semantic</a>, and frequency characteristics, letters belonging to one's own first and family names are preferred above other letters. He framed the effect in the context of <a href="narcissism">narcissism</a>, <a href="Gestalt%20theory">Gestalt theory</a> and <a href="awareness">awareness</a>, as reflected in the title of his 1985 article "Narcissism beyond Gestalt and awareness: the name letter effect", in which "beyond Gestalt" refers to the fact that subjects were not shown names, only letters in isolation, and "beyond awareness" to the fact that subjects did not realize that the letters of their own names were used. Nuttin claimed the effect he found was the first to go beyond Gestalt and awareness.

In 1987 Nuttin published his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 with the help of Hilde Sas. Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying <a href="affect%20%28psychology%29">affective</a> and <a href="cognitive%20psychology">cognitive</a> processes at work. He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.

Cross-lingual studies were performed at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, <a href="English%20language">English</a>, <a href="Finnish%20language">Finnish</a>, <a href="French%20language">French</a>, <a href="German%20language">German</a>, <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> (the only one with a non-<a href="Latin%20alphabet">Roman alphabet</a>), <a href="Hungarian%20language">Hungarian</a>, <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>, <a href="Norwegian%20language">Norwegian</a>, <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a>, <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>, and <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>. Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it was replaced by a simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at work again, it was copied in the other countries. A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.

Across languages and letters, the average probability of a letter being chosen as one of the six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies the effect was present but not to a significant degree. The effect was also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered. There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter effect was still found across all languages.

Nuttin analyzed the data to see if there was a national-letter effect, but failed to find one. Norwegians did not favor the letter N (for Norge) more than people from other countries did, neither did the Hungarians favor the letter M (for <a href="Magyarorsz%C3%A1g">Magyarország</a>). This led Nuttin to conclude that individual ownership has affective consequences that are not observed for collective ownership.

The data also allowed for an investigation into whether visual prominence is an important factor in the name-letter effect. Cars in Austria and Hungary have a sticker displaying their nationality with a capital letter that does not match the country's name in the local language (A and H respectively). This did not have any impact on people in those countries liking those letters relatively more.

As in the first study, the second one also included a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it. This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While there was a large consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.

In the light of how surprising the finding was, Nuttin hesitated for seven years before finally going public with it. He first mentioned it at a conference of the <a href="European%20Association%20of%20Social%20Psychology">European Association of Experimental Social Psychology</a> in 1984, followed by the 1985 and 1987 articles referred to above. His work was met with widespread skepticism, as he had expected. Loosen, a researcher at Nuttin's own university, called the name-letter effect "so strange that a down-to-earth researcher will spontaneously think of an <a href="artifact%20%28error%29">artifact</a>". Other researchers did not explicitly say that the effect was <a href="spurious%20relationship">spurious</a>, but they doubted its psychological relevance. In the first five years after publication (1985–1989), Nuttin's 1985 article was cited only once and the effect was studied at only one other university (<a href="Ohio%20State%20University">Ohio State University</a>, where Johnson replicated the effect using American students).

This all changed in 1995, when Greenwald and Banaji pointed out that Nuttin's work was relevant to indirect measurement of self-esteem, which Nuttin himself had actually already suggested. After that the original study was cited 14 times in the five years between 1995 and 1999, 50 times between 2000 and 2004, 114 times between 2005 and 2009, and approximately 200 times between 2010 and 2014. The name-letter effect is no longer disputed and Nuttin's work has been called "seminal" by Stieger, Voracek, and Formann in their 2012 meta-analysis of 44 publications on the effect. Their meta-analysis found no trace of <a href="publication%20bias">publication bias</a>.

In her 2014 <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> of dozens of name-letter effect studies, Hoorens called the effect robust. She noted robustness in:


Various explanations for the name-letter effect have been explored. Several explanations which seemed plausible at first have since been rejected.

People may simply like most what they see most. Letters that appear more frequently in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found a positive correlation between the frequency of occurrence of letters and <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a>s and how attractive they were judged to be. Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it. Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not. He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters. In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.

Subjective frequency is how frequently subjects a stimulus appears. Name letters may be noticed more and, consequently, assumed to occur more frequently than other letters. Early research into the impact of exposure showed that differences in subjective frequency yielded different results even when the frequency was identical. Hoorens and Nuttin tested whether subjective frequency could be an explanation for the name-letter effect by asking subjects to rank-order the entire alphabet twice, once according to their letter preference and once according to estimated letter frequency. Subjects indeed significantly overestimated the frequency of letters in their names, although there was no significant positive correlation between the overestimation of frequency and the name-letter effect. The researchers also asked subjects to rate how much they liked their own name. Subjects who liked their name had a stronger name-letter effect than those who did not like their name, but they did not overestimate the frequency of own-name letters more than subjects who did not like their names. Hoorens and Nuttin concluded that there is no support for the subjective frequency hypothesis.

<a href="Evaluative%20conditioning">Evaluative conditioning</a> suggests that if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of <a href="classical%20conditioning">classical conditioning</a> in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the <a href="cocktail%20party%20effect">cocktail party effect</a>, it could be that the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese <a href="kanji">kanji</a>) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.

Subjective ownership would occur if subjects knowingly chose the letters from their own name. Nuttin ruled out a conscious response strategy in tests. Despite being given a monetary reward and unlimited time, none of the subjects of his original study were able to find a pattern in the stimulus lists, ruling out the possibility that they knew their own name-letters were there.

The letters first learned by a child, commonly their own name, may come to have lasting positive associations. Hoorens and Todorova tested this by looking for a name-letter effect in bilingual subjects where their <a href="first%20language">mother tongue</a> alphabet was Cyrillic and their foreign-language alphabet Roman. Because learning a foreign language at a later age does not typically involve extra attention given to name letters, there should be no name-letter effect in the foreign-language alphabet, only in the first-language alphabet. Results of a study with 100 Bulgarian subjects who at a later age learned English, German, French or Spanish revealed a name-letter effect for the Roman alphabet as well as for Cyrillic. The researchers concluded mastery pleasure is not the principal cause of the name-letter effect. In a follow-up study Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun tested the strength of the name-letter effect among elementary-school children, in a cross-sectional experimental design involving Flemish and Hungarian second, fourth, and sixth graders. Instead of finding the name-effect to decrease with age as might be expected, they found it increased, thus proving that mastery pleasure is not the principal cause. They also investigated name-letter effects in bilingual Thai subjects, some of whom had learned the English alphabet at the same time as the Thai alphabet, and others who had learned it later. They found that the time at which students had learned the second alphabet made no difference in the strength of the name-letter effect, thereby ruling out mastery pleasure as a co-determinant.

The effect is thought to arise from unconscious, automatic processes of self-evaluation, with different research groups coming at it from two different angles.

Nuttin frames the cause in terms of ownership, which has roots in <a href="behavioral%20economics">economic psychology</a>. The <a href="endowment%20effect">endowment effect</a> has found that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect is just one example of a more general <a href="mere%20ownership%20effect">mere-ownership effect</a>. In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.


Another group of researchers has framed the cause in terms of <a href="social%20psychology">social psychology</a>, specifically the <a href="self-esteem">self-esteem</a> theory. Beginning with <a href="Anthony%20Greenwald">Greenwald</a> and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from <a href="implicit%20self-esteem">implicit self-esteem</a>, a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. Most people like themselves. The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters. As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin. It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.


In <a href="Psychological%20evaluation">psychological assessments</a>, the name-letter effect has been exploited to measure self-esteem. There are two types of self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem. Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to <a href="introspection">introspection</a>, measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.

The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular method to measure implicit self-esteem, surpassed only by the <a href="Implicit-association%20test">Implicit Association Test</a>. The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task. There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all the letters of the alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the <a href="Likert%20scale">rating scales</a> (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).

There is no standard <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a> for calculating implicit self-esteem. At least six algorithms are in use. In their meta-analysis of the name-letter effect, Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend using the <a href="ipsative">ipsatized</a> double-correction algorithm (the so-called "I-algorithm"), as originally recommended and named by LeBel and Gawronski). In her meta-analysis, Hoorens does not recommend a specific algorithm as little is known about how name-letter preference scores obtained from different algorithms relate to the most important psychometric quality of all, <a href="content%20validity">validity</a>. The algorithms are typically applied to initials only, but can be used for all name letters.

Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend that the task be administered twice, that the effects be calculated separately for first-name initial and last-name initial, that the task be accompanied with the birthday-number task, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness. They suggest it may be useful to use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self-esteem, something which Hoorens says is her most important recommendation. The Letter Preference Task has been used to measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a>, <a href="physical%20health">physical health</a>, <a href="social%20acceptance">social acceptance</a>, <a href="unrealistic%20optimism">unrealistic optimism</a>, feedback sensitivity, <a href="Emotional%20self-regulation">self-regulation</a>, and <a href="defensiveness">defensiveness</a>.

Researchers have looked for wider implications of the name-letter effect on preferences, both inside and outside the lab.

In controlled studies in the lab, Hodson and Olson tried to find evidence of people liking everyday things (e.g. foods, animals) that matched their name initials. No evidence was found, neither for a between-subjects effect (e.g. Judy did not like things starting with J, such as jam, more than Doug liked things starting with J), nor for a within-individuals effect (e.g. Judy did not like jam more than honey). The researchers did discover a small but reliable effect of initials on brand-name preferences within individuals (e.g. Hank did like Honda more than non-matching brands). They speculated that brand names are more likely to communicate identity to others than other everyday things. Stieger extended this research by looking at buying preferences for product names. He found that people were disproportionately more likely to buy products matching their initials. The effect mainly occurred for big brands. No correlation was found between the strength of an individual's name-letter effect and the strength of his or her name-letter-branding effect.

Wiebenga and Fennis investigated whether the use of the <a href="personal%20pronoun">personal pronoun</a>s "I" and "my" in branding also had an effect on preferences, given the way these pronouns link to the self. They found that brand names with a generic self-referencing pronoun (e.g. <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a>, <a href="Myspace">Myspace</a>) were evaluated more positively than non-self-referencing brand names (e.g. <a href="Xbox">Xbox</a>). The effect behaved like the name-letter effect: when the self was put under threat the effect became stronger, and it disappeared for people with negative self-evaluations.

A study by Polman, Pollmann, and Poehlman found that sharing initials with members in a group can increase the quality of group work. In a study of <a href="undergraduate">undergraduate</a> students they found that groups sharing initials performed better than groups that did not. Groups that had a higher proportion of shared initials exceeded groups with a lower proportion of shared initials.

Researchers have looked for evidence of the driving force behind the name-letter effect outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella of <a href="implicit%20egotism">implicit egotism</a>, starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name.  Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.

Simonsohn urged researchers to look hard for confounding variables in field data analysis. An example of a confounding variable is baby-name popularity. This has fluctuated significantly over the decades. Simonsohn found that although Walter and Dennis are of near-identical popularity in a large sample of US first names of living people, Walter is a relatively old-fashioned name. He suggested that when Pelham et al. found a disproportionately high number of dentists whose name started with the letters "Den" compared to with "Wal", they had overlooked that people named Walter would tend to be old, and more likely to be retired. Baby-name fluctuation seemed a better explanation for disproportionately more "Den" dentists than "Wal" than implicit egotism. Using both a different data set (<a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="Google%2B">Google+</a> accounts) and a different statistical analysis, Kooti, Magno, and Weber found no evidence of people disproportionately having a job matching their name initials.

Dyjas, Grasman, Wetzels, van der Maas, and Wagenmakers criticized the method Pelham et al. used in their analysis of archives of deaths in 23 "Saint cities" in the US, such as <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a> and <a href="Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">St. Paul</a>. Whereas Pelham et al. pooled all data together and concluded that people gravitate towards cities matching their first name (e.g. Louis or Paul), Dyjas et al. used <a href="Bayesian%20network">Bayesian hierarchical modelling</a> to show that there are several cities where the opposite happens, people moving away from their name Saint city. They concluded that there is no evidence for an overall effect. A different set of cities containing 30 surnames, such as <a href="Jackson%2C%20Mississippi">Jackson</a> and <a href="Johnson%20City%2C%20Tennessee">Johnson City</a>, did reveal a disproportionately large number of deceased people with city–surname matches. Dyjas et al. disputed that people gravitate towards cities of their surname, but instead cited Simonsohn's argument that many descendants of founders of these cities may never have moved away, a case of reverse causality.

Simonsohn also raised the possibility of reverse causality in the case of Anseel and Duyck's analysis of a large data set consisting of Belgians' last names and the companies they work for. Anseel and Duyck concluded that people tend to choose to work for companies that match their initial. But Simonsohn suspected that, like <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a> working for <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney</a>, many people work for companies named after themselves or a family member. When he controlled for reverse causality in a large US data set, he could not see any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.

A few controversial studies have linked performance to initials. However, McCullough and Williams found no evidence of a name-letter effect for the letter 'K' in baseball players <a href="strikeout">striking out</a> (shown on the scoreboard with a 'K'), despite an earlier study by Nelson and Simmons suggesting there was. Nelson and Simmons also found that students with first name initials C or D get lower <a href="Academic%20grading%20in%20the%20United%20States">grades</a> than others with initials A or B. Again, McCullough and Williams criticized the statistical analysis used and found no evidence to support such a relation.

In response to Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Carvallo published a new study in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations that matched their surnames, for example, Baker, Carpenter, and Farmer, something the "<a href="New%20Scientist">New Scientist</a>" has coined <a href="nominative%20determinism">nominative determinism</a>. Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami investigated which way the arrow of causality points when it comes to names influencing choice of occupation. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were <a href="metalsmith">smiths</a>. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appeared more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.

Research by Chandler, Griffin, and Sorensen into a link between letter names and donations has been widely accepted. They analyzed the records of disaster relief donations after seven hurricanes (among others, <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Katrina</a>, <a href="Hurricane%20Rita">Rita</a> and <a href="Hurricane%20Mitch">Mitch</a>). They found that people who shared an initial with the hurricane were overrepresented as donors. They concluded that people want to overcome some of the negative feelings associated with the shared name and thus donate. Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices, but would to low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity.

1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack

The 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack was the <a href="food%20poisoning">food poisoning</a> of 751 individuals in <a href="The%20Dalles%2C%20Oregon">The Dalles</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, through the deliberate contamination of <a href="salad%20bar">salad bar</a>s at ten local restaurants with "<a href="Salmonella">Salmonella</a>". A group of prominent followers of <a href="Bhagwan%20Shree%20Rajneesh">Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh</a> (later known as Osho) led by <a href="Ma%20Anand%20Sheela">Ma Anand Sheela</a> had hoped to incapacitate the voting population of the city so that their own candidates would win the 1984 <a href="Wasco%20County%2C%20Oregon">Wasco County</a> elections. The incident was the first and single largest <a href="bioterrorism">bioterrorist</a> attack in United States history.

Having previously gained political control of <a href="Antelope%2C%20Oregon">Antelope, Oregon</a>, Rajneesh's followers, who were based in nearby <a href="Rajneeshpuram">Rajneeshpuram</a>, sought election to two of the three seats on the Wasco County Circuit Court that were up for election in November 1984. Fearing they would not gain enough votes, some Rajneeshpuram officials decided to incapacitate voters in The Dalles, the largest population center in Wasco County. The chosen biological agent was "<a href="Salmonella%20enterica">Salmonella enterica</a>" Typhimurium, which was first delivered through glasses of water to two County Commissioners and then, on a larger scale, at salad bars and in salad dressing.

As a result of the attack, 751 people contracted <a href="salmonellosis">salmonellosis</a>, 45 of whom were hospitalized, but none died. Although an initial investigation by the <a href="Oregon%20Health%20Authority">Oregon Public Health Division</a> and the <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control">Centers for Disease Control</a> did not rule out deliberate contamination, the agents and contamination were only confirmed a year later. On February 28, 1985, Congressman <a href="Jim%20Weaver%20%28Oregon%20politician%29">James H. Weaver</a> gave a speech in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> in which he "accused the Rajneeshees of sprinkling "Salmonella" culture on salad bar ingredients in eight restaurants".

At a press conference in September 1985, Rajneesh accused several of his followers of participation in this and other crimes, including an <a href="1985%20Rajneeshee%20assassination%20plot">aborted plan</a> in 1985 to assassinate a <a href="United%20States%20Attorney">United States Attorney</a>, and he asked state and federal authorities to investigate. <a href="Oregon%20Attorney%20General">Oregon Attorney General</a> <a href="David%20B.%20Frohnmayer">David B. Frohnmayer</a> set up an interagency task force, composed of <a href="Oregon%20State%20Police">Oregon State Police</a> and the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>, and executed <a href="search%20warrant">search warrant</a>s in Rajneeshpuram. A sample of bacteria matching the contaminant that had sickened the town residents was found in a Rajneeshpuram medical laboratory. Two leading Rajneeshpuram officials were convicted on charges of attempted murder and served 29 months of 20-year sentences in a minimum-security <a href="federal%20prison">federal prison</a>.

Several thousand of <a href="Rajneesh">Rajneesh</a>'s followers had moved onto the "Big Muddy Ranch" in rural <a href="Wasco%20County%2C%20Oregon">Wasco County</a> in 1981, where they later incorporated as a city called <a href="Rajneeshpuram">Rajneeshpuram</a>. They had taken political control of the small nearby town of <a href="Antelope%2C%20Oregon">Antelope</a>, Oregon (population 75), the name of which they changed to "Rajneesh". The group had started on friendly terms with the local population, but relations soon degraded because of land use conflicts and the commune's dramatic expansion.

After being denied building permits for Rajneeshpuram, the commune leadership sought to gain political control over the rest of the county by influencing the November 1984 county election. Their goal was to win two of three seats on the Wasco County Circuit Court, as well as the sheriff's office. Their attempts to influence the election included the "Share-a-Home" program, in which they transported thousands of homeless people to Rajneeshpuram and attempted to register them to vote to inflate the constituency of voters for the group's candidates. The Wasco county clerk countered this attempt by enforcing a regulation that required all new voters to submit their qualifications when registering to vote.

The commune leadership planned to sicken and incapacitate voters in <a href="The%20Dalles%2C%20Oregon">The Dalles</a>, where most of the voters resided, to sway the election. Approximately twelve people were involved in the plots to employ biological agents, and at least eleven were involved in planning them. No more than four appear to have been involved in development at the Rajneeshpuram medical laboratory; not all of those were necessarily aware of the objectives of their work. At least eight individuals helped spread the bacteria.

The main planners of the attack included Sheela Silverman (<a href="Ma%20Anand%20Sheela">Ma Anand Sheela</a>), Rajneesh's chief lieutenant, and Diane Yvonne Onang (Ma Anand Puja), a nurse practitioner and secretary-treasurer of the Rajneesh Medical Corporation. They purchased "Salmonella" bacteria from a medical supply company in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, and staff cultured it in labs within the commune. They contaminated the produce at the salad bars as a "trial run". The group also tried to introduce <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s into The Dalles' water system. If successful, they planned to use the same techniques closer to <a href="Election%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Election Day</a>. They did not carry out the second part of the plan. The commune decided to boycott the election when it became clear that those brought in through the "Share-a-Home" program would not be allowed to vote.

Two visiting Wasco County commissioners were infected via glasses of water containing "Salmonella" bacteria during a visit to Rajneeshpuram on August 29, 1984. Both men fell ill and one was hospitalized. Afterward, members of Sheela's team spread "Salmonella" on <a href="produce">produce</a> in grocery stores and on doorknobs and urinal handles in the county courthouse, but these actions did not produce the desired effects. In September and October 1984, they contaminated the salad bars of 10 local restaurants with "Salmonella", infecting 751 people. Forty-five people received hospital treatment; all survived.

The primary delivery tactic involved one member concealing a plastic bag containing a light-brown liquid with the "Salmonella" bacteria (referred to by the perpetrators as "salsa"), and either spreading it over the food at a salad bar, or pouring it into salad dressing. By September 24, 1984, more than 150 people were violently ill. By the end of September, 751 cases of acute <a href="gastroenteritis">gastroenteritis</a> were documented; lab testing determined that all of the victims were infected with "Salmonella enterica" Typhimurium. Symptoms included diarrhea, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headaches, abdominal pain, and bloody stools. Victims ranged in age from an infant, born two days after his mother's infection and initially given a five percent chance of survival, to an 87-year-old.

Local residents suspected that Rajneesh's followers were behind the poisonings. They turned out in droves on election day to prevent the cult from winning any county positions, thus rendering the plot unsuccessful. The Rajneeshees eventually withdrew their candidate from the November 1984 ballot. Only 239 of the commune's 7,000 residents voted; most were not US citizens and could not vote. The outbreak cost local restaurants hundreds of thousands of dollars and health officials shut down the salad bars of the affected establishments. Some residents feared further attacks and stayed at home. One resident said: "People were so horrified and scared. People wouldn't go out, they wouldn't go out alone. People were becoming prisoners."

Officials and investigators from a number of different state and federal agencies investigated the outbreak. Dr. Michael Skeels, Director of the Oregon State Public Health Laboratory at the time, said that the incident provoked such a large public health investigation because "it was the largest food-related outbreak in the U.S. in 1984". The investigation identified the bacteria as "<a href="Salmonella%20enterica">Salmonella enterica</a>" Typhimurium and initially concluded that the outbreak had been due to food handlers' poor personal hygiene. Workers preparing food at the affected restaurants had fallen ill before most patrons had.

Oregon <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> Congressman <a href="Jim%20Weaver%20%28Oregon%20politician%29">James H. Weaver</a> continued to investigate because he believed that the officials' conclusion did not adequately explain the facts. He contacted physicians at the <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">CDC</a> and other agencies and urged them to investigate Rajneeshpuram. According to Lewis F. Carter's book "Charisma and Control in Rajneeshpuram", "many treated his concern" as paranoid or as an example of "Rajneeshee bashing". On February 28, 1985, Weaver gave a speech at the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> in which he accused the Rajneeshees of contaminating salad bar ingredients in eight restaurants. As events later showed, Weaver had presented a well-reasoned, if only circumstantial, case; these circumstantial elements were confirmed by evidence found after investigators gained access to Rajneeshpuram several months later.

Months later, starting on September 16, 1985, Rajneesh, who had recently emerged from a four-year period of public silence and self-imposed isolation (although he had continued to meet with his assistant) at the commune, convened press conferences: he stated that Sheela and 19 other commune leaders, including Puja, had left Rajneeshpuram over the weekend and gone to Europe. He said that he had received information from commune residents that Sheela and her team had committed a number of serious crimes. Calling them a "gang of fascists", he said they had tried to poison his doctor and Rajneesh's female companion, as well as the <a href="Jefferson%20County%2C%20Oregon">Jefferson County</a> district attorney and the water system in The Dalles. He said that he believed they had poisoned a county commissioner and Judge William Hulse, and that they may have been responsible for the salmonellosis outbreak in The Dalles. He invited state and federal law enforcement officials to the Ranch to investigate. His allegations were initially greeted with skepticism by outside observers.

<a href="Oregon%20Attorney%20General">Oregon Attorney General</a> <a href="David%20B.%20Frohnmayer">Dave Frohnmayer</a> established a task force among the Wasco County Sheriff's office, the <a href="Oregon%20State%20Police">Oregon State Police</a>, the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI), the <a href="Immigration%20and%20Naturalization%20Service">Immigration and Naturalization Service</a> (INS) and the <a href="National%20Guard%20of%20the%20United%20States">National Guard</a> that set up headquarters on the Ranch to investigate the allegations. They obtained <a href="search%20warrant">search warrant</a>s and subpoenas; 50 investigators entered the Ranch on October 2, 1985. Dr. Skeels found glass vials containing "Salmonella" "bactrol disks" in the laboratory of a Rajneeshpuram medical clinic. Analysis by the <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> lab in Atlanta confirmed that the bacteria at the Rajneesh laboratory were an exact match to those that sickened individuals who had eaten at local restaurants.

The investigation also revealed experimentation at Rajneeshpuram with poisons, chemicals and bacteria which had been carried out during 1984 and 1985. Dr. Skeels described the scene at the Rajneesh laboratory as "a bacteriological freezer-dryer for large-scale production" of microbes. Investigators found a copy of "<a href="The%20Anarchist%20Cookbook">The Anarchist Cookbook</a>", and literature on the manufacture and usage of explosives and military bio-warfare. Investigators believed that the commune had previously carried out similar attacks in <a href="Salem%2C%20Oregon">Salem</a>, <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a>, and other cities in Oregon. According to court testimony, the plotters boasted that they had attacked a nursing home and a salad bar at the <a href="Mid-Columbia%20Medical%20Center">Mid-Columbia Medical Center</a>, but no such attempts were ever proven in court. As a result of the bioterrorism investigation, law enforcement officials discovered that there had been an <a href="1985%20Rajneeshee%20assassination%20plot">aborted plot</a> by Rajneeshees to murder <a href="Charles%20H.%20Turner%20%28attorney%29">Charles Turner</a>, a former <a href="United%20States%20Attorney">United States Attorney</a> for Oregon.

The mayor of Rajneeshpuram, <a href="David%20Berry%20Knapp">David Berry Knapp</a> (known as Swami Krishna Deva or KD), <a href="Turn%20state%27s%20evidence">turned state's evidence</a> and gave an account of his knowledge of the "Salmonella" attack to the FBI. He claimed that Sheela said "she had talked with [Rajneesh] about the plot to decrease voter turnout in The Dalles by making people sick. Sheela said that [Rajneesh] commented that it was best not to hurt people, but if a few died not to worry." In Miller's "", this statement is attributed to Sheela. According to KD's testimony, she played doubters a tape of Rajneesh's muffled voice saying, "if it was necessary to do things to preserve [his] vision, then do it," and interpreted this to mean that murder in his name was fine, telling doubters "not to worry" if a few people had to die. The investigation uncovered a September 25, 1984, invoice from the <a href="American%20Type%20Culture%20Collection">American Type Culture Collection</a> of microbes, showing an order received by the Rajneeshpuram laboratory for <a href="Salmonella%20enterica%20subsp.%20enterica">"Salmonella" "typhi"</a>, the bacterium that causes the life-threatening illness <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>.

According to a 1994 study published in the journal "Sociology of Religion", "[m]ost sannyasins indicated that they believed that [Rajneesh] knew about Ma Anand Sheela's illegal activities." <a href="Frances%20FitzGerald%20%28journalist%29">Frances FitzGerald</a> writes in "Cities on a Hill" that most of Rajneesh's followers "believed [him] incapable of doing, or willing, violence against another person", and that almost all thought the responsibility for the criminality was Sheela's – according to FitzGerald, the followers believed the guru had not known anything about it. Carus writes in "Toxic Terror" that, "There is no way to know to what extent [Rajneesh] participated in actual decision-making. His followers believed he was involved in every important decision that Sheela made, but those allegations were never proven." Rajneesh insisted that Sheela, who he said was his only source of information during his period of isolation, used her position to impose "a fascist state" on the commune. He acknowledged that the key to her actions was his silence.

<a href="Rajneesh">Rajneesh</a> left Oregon by plane on October 27, 1985, and was <a href="Arrest%20warrant">arrested</a> when he landed in <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte</a>, North Carolina, and charged with 35 counts of deliberate <a href="Illegal%20immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">violations of immigration laws</a>. As part of a plea bargain arrangement, he pleaded guilty to two counts of <a href="making%20false%20statements">making false statements</a> to immigration officials. He received a ten-year suspended sentence and a fine of US$400,000, and was deported and barred from reentering the United States for a period of five years. He was never prosecuted for crimes related to the "Salmonella" attack.

Sheela and Puja were arrested in <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> on October 28, 1985. After protracted negotiations between the two governments, they were <a href="extradited">extradited</a> to the United States, reaching Portland on February 6, 1986. They were charged with attempting to murder Rajneesh's personal physician, first-degree assault for poisoning Judge William Hulse, second-degree assault for poisoning The Dalles Commissioner Raymond Matthews, and product tampering for the poisonings in The Dalles, as well as wiretapping and immigration offenses. The U.S. Attorney's office handled the prosecution of the poisoning cases related to the 10 restaurants, and the Oregon Attorney General's office prosecuted the poisoning cases of Commissioner Matthews and Judge Hulse.

On July 22, 1986, both women entered <a href="Alford%20plea">Alford plea</a>s for the "Salmonella" attack and the other charges, and received sentences ranging from three to twenty years, to be served concurrently. Sheela received 20 years for the attempted murder of Rajneesh's physician, twenty years for first-degree assault in the poisoning of Judge Hulse, ten years for second-degree assault in the poisoning of Commissioner Matthews, four and a half years for her role in the attack, four and a half years for the wiretapping conspiracy, and five years' probation for immigration fraud; Puja received fifteen, fifteen, seven and a half, and four and a half years, respectively, for her role in the first four of these crimes, as well as three years' probation for the wiretapping conspiracy. Both Sheela and Puja were released on parole early for good behavior, after serving twenty-nine months of their sentences in a minimum-security <a href="federal%20prison">federal prison</a>. Sheela's <a href="Permanent%20residence%20%28United%20States%29">Green Card</a> was revoked; she moved to Switzerland. She remarried there and went on to run two <a href="nursing%20home">nursing home</a>s in <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>.

"<a href="The%20Oregonian">The Oregonian</a>" ran a 20-part series on Rajneesh's movement, beginning in June 1985, which included an investigation into the "Salmonella" incident. As a result of a follow-up investigation, "The Oregonian" learned that Leslie L. Zaitz, one of their <a href="investigative%20journalism">investigative journalists</a>, had been placed as number three on a top-ten hit list by Sheela's group. <a href="Oregon%20Attorney%20General">Oregon Attorney General</a> <a href="David%20B.%20Frohnmayer">Dave Frohnmayer</a> commented on the poisoning incident and other acts perpetrated by the group, stating: "The Rajneeshees committed the most significant crimes of their kind in the history of the United States ... The largest single incident of fraudulent marriages, the most massive scheme of wiretapping and bugging, and the largest mass poisoning." Looking back on the incident, Skeels stated, "We lost our innocence over this ... We really learned to be more suspicious ... The first significant biological attack on a U.S. community was not carried out by foreign terrorists smuggled into New York, but by legal residents of a U.S. community. The next time it happens it could be with more lethal agents ... We in public health are really not ready to deal with that."

Milton Leitenberg noted in the 2005 work "Assessing the Biological Weapons and Bioterrorism Threat", "there is apparently no other 'terrorist' group that is known to have successfully cultured any pathogen." Federal and state investigators requested that details of the incident not be published in the "<a href="Journal%20of%20the%20American%20Medical%20Association">Journal of the American Medical Association</a>" (JAMA) for 12 years, for they feared a description of the events could spark <a href="copycat%20crime">copycat crime</a>s, and "JAMA" complied. No repeat attacks or <a href="hoax">hoax</a>es subsequently occurred, and a detailed account of the incident and investigation was published in "JAMA" in 1997. A 1999 empirical analysis in the journal "Emerging Infectious Diseases" published by the <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">CDC</a> described six motivational factors associated with bioterrorism, including: charismatic leadership, no outside constituency, apocalyptic ideology, loner or splinter group, sense of paranoia and grandiosity, and defensive aggression. According to the article, the "Rajneesh Cult" satisfied all motivational factors except for an "apocalyptic ideology". An analysis in the book "Cults, Religion and Violence" disputes the link to <a href="Charismatic%20authority">charismatic leadership</a>, pointing out that in this and other cases, it was organizational lieutenants who played a pivotal role in the initiation of violence. Arguing for a contextual rather than decisive view of charisma, the authors state that the attribution of outcomes to the personality of a single individual, even a charismatic leader, usually camouflages a far more complex field of social relationships.
The media revisited the incident during the <a href="2001%20anthrax%20attacks">2001 anthrax attacks</a> in the United States. The 2001 publication of <a href="Judith%20Miller%20%28journalist%29">Judith Miller</a>'s "Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War", which contained an analysis and detailed description of the events, also brought discussion of the incident back into the news. Residents of The Dalles commented that they have an understanding of how bioterrorism can occur in the United States. The incident had spread fear in the community, and drained the local economy. All but one of the restaurants affected went out of business. In 2005, the <a href="Oregon%20Department%20of%20State%20Lands">Oregon State Land Board</a> agreed to sell of Wasco County, including Rajneeshpuram, to the Colorado-based youth ministry <a href="Young%20Life">Young Life</a>. On February 18, 2005, <a href="Court%20TV">Court TV</a> aired an episode of "<a href="Forensic%20Files">Forensic Files</a>" about the incident, entitled: "'Bio-Attack' – Oregon Cult Poisonings". The salmonellosis outbreak was also discussed in the media within the context of the <a href="2006%20North%20American%20E.%20coli%20outbreak">2006 North American E. coli outbreak</a>.

The book "Emerging Infectious Diseases: Trends and Issues" cites the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack, along with the "<a href="Aum%20Shinrikyo">Aum Shinrikyo</a>" group's attempts to use anthrax and other agents, as exceptions to the belief "that only foreign-state supported groups have the resources to execute a credible bioterrorism event". According to "Deadly Cultures: Biological Weapons Since 1945", these are the only two confirmed uses of <a href="biological%20weapons">biological weapons</a> for terrorist purposes to harm humans. The incident was the single largest bioterrorist attack in United States history. In the chapter titled: "Influencing An Election: America's First Modern Bioterrorist Attack" in his 2006 book "Terrorism on American Soil: A Concise History of Plots and Perpetrators from the Famous to the Forgotten", author Joseph T. McCann concludes: "In every respect, the "Salmonella" attack carried out by the cult members was a major bioterrorist attack that fortunately failed to achieve its ultimate goal and resulted in no fatalities."

Nagato-class battleship

The were a pair of <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s built for the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, although they were not completed until after the end of the war. , the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a> of the <a href="ship%20class">class</a>, frequently served as a <a href="flagship">flagship</a>. Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the <a href="1923%20Great%20Kant%C5%8D%20earthquake">Great Kantō earthquake</a> in 1923. They were modernized in 1933–36 with improvements to their armor and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the <a href="pagoda%20mast">pagoda mast</a> style. "Nagato" and her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> briefly participated in the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a> in 1937 and "Nagato" was the flagship of <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="Isoroku%20Yamamoto">Isoroku Yamamoto</a> during the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> on 7 December 1941 that began the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>.

The sisters participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a> in June 1942, although they did not see any combat. "Mutsu" saw more active service than her sister because she was not a flagship and participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Eastern%20Solomons">Battle of the Eastern Solomons</a> in August before returning to Japan in early 1943. One of "Mutsu"s aft <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s detonated in June, killing 1,121 crew and visitors and destroying the ship. The IJN conducted a perfunctory investigation into the cause of her loss and concluded that it was the work of a disgruntled crewmember. They dispersed the survivors in an attempt to conceal the sinking to keep up morale in Japan. Much of the wreck was <a href="marine%20salvage">salvaged</a> after the war and many artifacts and relics are on display in Japan.

"Nagato" spent most of the first two years of the war training in home waters. She was transferred to <a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Truk</a> in mid-1943, but did not see any combat until the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Philippine%20Sea">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a> in mid-1944 when she was attacked by American aircraft. "Nagato" did not fire her main armament against enemy vessels until the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a> in October 1944. She was lightly damaged during the battle and returned to Japan the following month for repairs. The IJN was running out of fuel by this time and decided not to fully repair her. "Nagato" was converted into a floating <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> platform and assigned to coastal defense duties. After the war, the ship was a target for U.S. <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a> tests during <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a> in mid-1946. She survived the first test with little damage, but was sunk by the second test.

The IJN considered a battle fleet of eight modern battleships and eight modern <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s necessary for the defense of Japan, and the government adopted that policy in 1907. This was the genesis of the <a href="Eight-Eight%20Fleet%20Program">Eight-Eight Fleet Program</a>, the development of a cohesive battle line of 16 <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s less than eight years old. Advances in naval technology like the British battleship and the <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> forced the IJN to several times re-evaluate the ships that it counted as modern. By 1910, the IJN considered none of its current ships to be modern and restarted the program in 1911 with orders for the dreadnoughts and the s. By 1915, the IJN was halfway to its goal and wanted to order four more dreadnoughts, but the <a href="Diet%20of%20Japan">Diet</a> rejected its plan, and the 1916 budget authorized only one dreadnought, later named , and two battlecruisers. Later that year, American President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> announced plans for 10 additional battleships and six battlecruisers, and the following year the Diet authorized three more dreadnoughts in response, one of which would later be named .

Allocated project number A-102, the "Nagato" class was designed before <a href="Commander">Commander</a> <a href="Yuzuru%20Hiraga">Yuzuru Hiraga</a> was reassigned to the Navy Technical Department (NTD) responsible for ship design, although Hiraga is often credited with the design of these ships. In contrast to earlier designs, the "Nagato" class used the American "all or nothing" armor scheme that maximized the armor thickness protecting the core of the ship by eliminating armor elsewhere. The design had two armored <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a>s of medium thickness rather than the single thicker deck used formerly. The ships also used a new type of underwater protection system that successfully resisted penetration by <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> <a href="warhead">warhead</a>s in full-scale trials. It consisted of a deep water-tight compartment adjacent to the hull, backed by a thick <a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a> that connected to the side and deck armor plates, with a deep fuel oil tank behind it.

Although the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> planned to arm its with guns before the "Nagato" class was designed, "Nagato"s guns made her the first dreadnought that was <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> armed with guns larger than .

On 12 June 1917, well before "Mutsu" was <a href="laid%20down">laid down</a>, Hiraga proposed a revised design for the ship that reflected the lessons from the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> that had occurred the previous year, and incorporated advances in <a href="boiler%20%28steam%20generator%29">boiler</a> technology. Given project number A-125, his design added an extra twin main-gun turret, using space and weight made available by the reduction of the number of boilers from 21 to 12, while the power remained the same. He reduced the <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> from 20 guns to 16, although they were raised in height to improve their ability to fire during heavy weather and to improve their arcs of fire. To increase the ship's protection he proposed angling the belt armor outwards to improve its resistance to horizontal fire, and increasing the thickness of the lower deck armor and the torpedo bulkhead. Hiraga also planned to add <a href="anti-torpedo%20bulge">anti-torpedo bulge</a>s to improve underwater protection. He estimated that his ship would <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">displace</a> as much as "Nagato", although it would cost about a million yen more. Hiraga's changes would have considerably delayed "Mutsu"s completion and were rejected by the Navy Ministry.

The ships had a length of <a href="Length%20between%20perpendiculars">between perpendiculars</a> and <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>. They had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draft</a> of . The "Nagato"-class ships displaced at <a href="Standard%20displacement%23Standard%20displacement">standard load</a> and at <a href="Full-load%20displacement">full load</a>. Their crew consisted of 1,333 officers and enlisted men as built and 1,368 in 1935. In 1944, the crew totaled around 1,734 men.

The "Nagato" class was equipped with a unique heptapodal (seven-legged) mast designed to maximize rigidity for range-finding purposes and survivability under shellfire. It consisted of a thick vertical leg in the center surrounded by six outer legs. The central leg was large enough to accommodate an electric elevator running between the foretop and main deck. In November 1944, the tops of "Nagato"s <a href="mainmast">mainmast</a> and <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a> were removed to improve the arcs of fire for her anti-aircraft guns.

In 1927, "Mutsu"s bow was remodeled to reduce the amount of spray produced when steaming into a <a href="head%20sea">head sea</a>. This increased her overall length by to . This proved successful and her sister's bow was rebuilt in 1930. During their 1934–36 reconstruction, the ships' sterns were lengthened by to improve their speed and their forward <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>s were rebuilt into a <a href="pagoda%20mast">pagoda mast</a>. They were given <a href="torpedo%20bulge">torpedo bulge</a>s to improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armor and equipment. These changes increased their overall length to , their beam to and their draft to . Their displacement increased over to at deep load.

The ships were equipped with four Gihon geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each of which drove one propeller. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , using steam provided by 21 Kampon <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s; 15 of these were oil-fired while the remaining half-dozen used <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. The boilers had a working pressure of .

The ships had a stowage capacity of of coal and of oil, giving them a range of at a speed of . "Nagato" exceeded her designed speed of during her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, reaching at and "Mutsu" reached the same speed with . The US Navy did not learn their actual speed capability until about 1937; previously it had believed that the ships were capable of only .

During refits in 1923–25, the fore funnel was rebuilt in a serpentine shape in an unsuccessful effort to prevent smoke interference with the <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> and <a href="fire-control%20system">fire-control system</a>s. The rebuilt fore funnel was eliminated during the ships' 1930s reconstructions when their boilers were replaced by 10 oil-fired Kampon boilers, which had a working pressure of and temperature of . The turbines were also replaced by lighter, more modern, units and their propellers were replaced by larger ones. When the ships conducted their post-reconstruction trials, they reached a speed of with . Additional fuel oil was stored in the bottoms of the newly added <a href="torpedo%20bulge">torpedo bulge</a>s, which increased their capacity to and thus their range to at 16 knots.

The <a href="Main%20battery">main armament</a> of the "Nagato"-class ships consisted of eight 45-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a> <a href="41%20cm/45%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">41-centimeter</a> guns, mounted in two pairs of twin-gun, <a href="superfire">superfiring</a> turrets fore and aft. Numbered one through four from front to rear, the hydraulically powered turrets gave the guns an elevation range of −2 to +35 degrees. The rate of fire for the guns was around two rounds per minute. Their turrets were replaced in the mid-1930s using the turrets stored from the unfinished s. While in storage they were modified to increase their range of elevation to −3 to +43 degrees, which increased the gun's maximum range from .

By World War II, the guns used Type 91 <a href="Armour-piercing%20capped%23Armor-piercing">armor-piercing, capped shells</a>. Each of these shells weighed and had a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of . Also available was a <a href="Armour-piercing%20capped%23High-explosive">high-explosive shell</a> that had a muzzle velocity of . A special Type 3 "Sankaidan" incendiary <a href="shrapnel%20shell">shrapnel shell</a> was developed in the 1930s for anti-aircraft use.

The ships' secondary armament of twenty 50-caliber <a href="14%20cm/50%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">14-centimeter guns</a> was mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s on the upper sides of the hull and in the superstructure. The latter guns had a maximum elevation of +20 degrees and the former could elevate to +25 degrees which gave them ranges of and respectively. Each gun could fire a high-explosive projectile at a rate up to 10 rounds per minute. <a href="Anti-aircraft%20defense">Anti-aircraft defense</a> was provided by four 40-caliber <a href="8%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bcm/40%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">3rd Year Type 3-inch</a> <a href="AA%20gun">AA gun</a>s in single mounts. The high-angle guns had a maximum elevation of +75 degrees, and had a rate of fire of 13 to 20 rounds per minute. They fired a projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum height of . The ship was also fitted with eight <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, four on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>, two above water and two submerged. They used the <a href="6th%20Year%20Type%20torpedo">6th Year Type torpedo</a> which had a warhead of <a href="Shimose%20powder">Shimose powder</a>. It had three settings for range and speed: at , at , or at .
Around 1926, the four above-water torpedo tubes were removed and the ships received three additional 76-millimeter AA guns that were situated around the base of the foremast. They were replaced by eight 40-caliber <a href="12.7%20cm/40%20Type%2089%20naval%20gun">12.7-centimeter Type 89</a> <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a>s in 1932, fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four twin-gun mounts. When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of . Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute. Two twin-gun mounts for license-built <a href="Vickers">Vickers</a> <a href="QF%202%20pounder%20naval%20gun">2-pounder</a> light AA guns were also added to the ship that same year. They had a rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute.

When the ships were reconstructed in 1934–36, the remaining torpedo tubes and the two forward 14-centimeter guns were removed from the hull. All of the remaining 14-centimeter guns had their elevation increased to +35 degrees which increased their range to . An unknown number of license-built <a href="13.2%20mm%20Hotchkiss%20machine%20gun">13.2-millimeter Hotchkiss machine gun</a>s in twin mounts were also added. The maximum range of these guns was , but the effective range against aircraft was . The cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute, but the need to change 30-round <a href="magazine%20%28firearms%29">magazines</a> reduced the effective rate to 250 rounds per minute.

The 2-pounders were replaced in 1939 by 20 license-built <a href="25%20mm%20Hotchkiss%20anti-aircraft%20gun">Hotchkiss</a> <a href="Type%2096%2025%20mm%20AT/AA%20Gun">25-millimeter Type 96</a> light AA guns in a mixture of twin-gun and single mounts. This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to historian Mark Stille, the twin and triple mounts "lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast". These guns had an effective range of . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the 15-round magazines. As far as is known, no additional AA guns were installed aboard "Mutsu" before her loss. Additional 25-millimeter guns were installed aboard "Nagato" during the war; on 10 July 1944, she was reported to have 98 guns on board. An additional 30 guns were added during a refit in Yokosuka in November. Two more twin 127-millimeter gun mounts were added at the same time abreast the funnel and all of her 14-centimeter guns were removed as she was now a floating anti-aircraft battery.

The "Nagato"-class ships' <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="belt%20armor">armor belt</a> was made from <a href="Vickers%20cemented%20armor">Vickers cemented armor</a> and protected of the hull between the <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s of the end turrets. The lower <a href="strake">strake</a> was thick, high, and tapered to a thickness of at its bottom edge; above it was a strake of armor that was high. Approximately of the armor belt was below the waterline. The turrets were protected with an armor thickness of 305 mm on the face, on the sides, and on the roof. The barbettes were protected by armor 305 mm thick, while the casemates of the 140 mm guns were protected by 25 mm armor plates. The sides of the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> were thick.

The main deck armor consisted of three layers of high-tensile steel (HTS) thick that connected to the top of the upper strake of side armor. The flat portion of the lower deck had one layer of Ducol steel 25 mm thick with two layers of HTS of equal thickness above it. About from the side of the hull, this deck, now composed of three layers of HTS, totaling in thickness, sloped downwards where it met a short horizontal armored (three layers of HTS with a total thickness of ) deck that connected to the main armored belt and the torpedo bulkhead. This was also made up of three 25 mm layers of HTS and curved up and outwards to meet the short horizontal armored deck. It enclosed a water-tight compartment that was from the side of the ship. It was backed by fuel oil tanks deep. The outermost void was designed to allow the explosive force of a torpedo's warhead to dissipate as much as possible while the oil tank was supposed to stop any fragments from penetrating the innermost <a href="Bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a> protecting the ship's vital areas.

The new 41 cm turrets installed during their reconstruction were more heavily armored than the original ones. Face armor was increased to , the sides to , and the roof to . The armor over the machinery and magazines was increased by on the upper deck and 25 mm on the upper armored deck. The torpedo bulges added at the same time were high and deep. They were divided into four compartments, the lower two of which were filled with oil and the others remained empty. These additions increased the weight of each ship's armor to , 32.6 percent of their displacement. In early 1941, as a preparation for war, the uppermost compartment of the bulges was filled with sealed steel crushing tubes and the barbette armor of both ships was reinforced with 100 mm armor plates above the main deck and plates below it.

The "Nagato"-class ships were fitted with a <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a> in the forward superstructure; and anti-aircraft rangefinders were added in the early 1920s. The rangefinders in the two superfiring turrets were replaced by 10-meter units in 1932–33.

They were initially fitted with a Type 13 fire-control system derived from Vickers equipment received during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, but this was replaced by an improved Type 14 system around 1925. It controlled the main and secondary guns; no provision was made for anti-aircraft fire until the Type 31 <a href="fire-control%20director">fire-control director</a> was introduced in 1932. A modified Type 14 fire-control system was tested aboard "Nagato" in 1935, and later approved for service as the Type 34. A new anti-aircraft director, designated the Type 94, used to control the 127 mm AA guns, was introduced in 1937, although it is unknown when they were installed on the ships. The 25 mm AA guns were controlled by a Type 95 director that was also introduced in 1937.

As far as is known, no <a href="radar">radar</a>s were installed aboard "Mutsu" before her loss. While in <a href="drydock">drydock</a> in May 1943, a <a href="List%20of%20Japanese%20World%20War%20II%20radar%23Shipborne%20Radar">Type 21</a> air-search radar was installed aboard "Nagato" on the roof of the 10-meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast. On 27 June 1944, two Type 22 surface-search radars were installed on the pagoda mast and two Type 13 <a href="early%20warning%20radar">early warning radar</a>s were fitted on her mainmast.

"Nagato" was briefly fitted with an aircraft <a href="Flight%20deck%23Early%20flight%20decks">flying-off platform</a> on No. 2 turret in August 1925. <a href="Yokosuka%20Ro-go%20Ko-gata">Yokosuka Ro-go Ko-gata</a> and <a href="Heinkel%20HD%2025">Heinkel HD 25</a> <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s were tested from it before it was removed early the following year. An additional boom was added to the mainmasts of both ships in 1926 to handle the <a href="Yokosuka%20E1Y">Yokosuka E1Y</a> then assigned to them. A <a href="Hansa-Brandenburg%20W.33">Hansa-Brandenburg W.33</a> floatplane was tested aboard "Nagato" that same year. A <a href="aircraft%20catapult">catapult</a> was fitted between the mainmast and No. 3 turret in mid-1933, a collapsible <a href="crane%20%28machine%29">crane</a> was installed in a portside <a href="sponson">sponson</a>, and the ships were equipped to operate two or three floatplanes, although no <a href="hangar">hangar</a> was provided. The sisters began to operate <a href="Nakajima%20E4N">Nakajima E4N</a>2 biplanes until they were replaced by <a href="Nakajima%20E8N">Nakajima E8N</a>2 biplanes in 1938. A more powerful catapult was installed in November 1938 to handle heavier aircraft like the one <a href="Kawanishi%20E7K">Kawanishi E7K</a> that was added in 1939–40. <a href="Mitsubishi%20F1M">Mitsubishi F1M</a> biplanes replaced the E8Ns on 11 February 1943.

While "Mutsu" was still <a href="fitting%20out">fitting out</a>, the American government decided to call a conference in Washington, D.C. to forestall the massively expensive naval arms race between the United States, the United Kingdom and the Empire of Japan that was developing. The <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Conference">Washington Naval Conference</a> convened on 12 November, and the Americans proposed to <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a> virtually every capital ship under construction or fitting out among the participating nations. "Mutsu" was specifically listed among those to be scrapped even though she had been commissioned a few weeks earlier. This was unacceptable to the Japanese delegation and they agreed to a compromise that allowed them to keep "Mutsu" in exchange for scrapping the obsolete <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> and a similar arrangement for several American <a href="Colorado-class%20battleship">"Colorado"-class</a> dreadnoughts that were fitting out.

Upon commissioning, the <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s were assigned to the 1st Battleship Division, although "Nagato" became the flagship of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="S%C5%8Djir%C5%8D%20Tochinai">Sōjirō Tochinai</a>, a role she often fulfilled during her career. The ships hosted <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward</a>, <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>, and his <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> Lieutenant <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten">Louis Mountbatten</a> in 1922 during the prince's visit to Japan. After the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, both ships loaded supplies from <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a> for the victims on 4 September. They sank the <a href="hulk%20%28ship%29">hulk</a> of the obsolete battleship on 7 September 1924 during gunnery practice in <a href="Tokyo%20Bay">Tokyo Bay</a> in accordance with the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>. "Nagato" became flagship of the Combined Fleet on 1 December 1925, flying the flag of Admiral <a href="Keisuke%20Okada">Keisuke Okada</a>. The sisters were placed in reserve several times during the 1920s while they were being modernized. "Mutsu" served as flagship of <a href="Emperor%20of%20Japan">Emperor</a> <a href="Hirohito">Hirohito</a> during the 1927 naval maneuvers and fleet review and again in 1933.
The ships were reconstructed from late 1933 to mid-1936. In August 1937, the sisters transported 3,749 men of the <a href="11th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">11th Infantry Division</a> to Shanghai during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Their floatplanes bombed targets in Shanghai on 24 August before they returned to <a href="Sasebo%20Naval%20District">Sasebo</a> the following day. "Nagato" became a training ship on 1 December 1937 until she again became the flagship of the Combined Fleet on 15 December 1938. The ship participated in an Imperial Fleet Review on 11 October 1940. The sisters were refitted in 1941 in preparation for war, which included the fitting of external <a href="degaussing">degaussing</a> coils and additional armor for their barbettes.

Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto issued the code phrase "Niitaka yama nobore" (Climb <a href="Mount%20Niitaka">Mount Niitaka</a>) on 2 December 1941 from "Nagato" at anchor at <a href="Hashirajima">Hashirajima</a> to signal the <a href="1st%20Air%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29%23Kido%20Butai">1st Air Fleet</a> ("Kido Butai") to proceed with its attack on Pearl Harbor. When Japan began the Pacific War on 8 December, the sisters <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d for the <a href="Bonin%20Islands">Bonin Islands</a>, along with the four ships of Battleship Division 2 and the <a href="light%20carrier">light carrier</a> as distant cover for the fleet attacking <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, and returned six days later. Yamamoto transferred his flag to the new battleship on 12 February 1942.

In June 1942, "Mutsu" and "Nagato" were assigned to the Main Body of the <a href="1st%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Fleet</a> during the Battle of Midway, together with "Yamato", "Hōshō", the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> and nine destroyers. Following the loss of all four fleet carriers of the "Kido Butai" on 4 June, Yamamoto attempted to lure the American forces west to within range of the Japanese air groups at <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a>, and into a night engagement with his surface forces, but the American forces withdrew and "Mutsu" saw no action. After rendezvousing with the remnants of the Striking Force on 6 June, over half of the survivors from the sunken aircraft carriers of the 1st Air Fleet were transferred to "Mutsu" and "Nagato". They arrived at Hashirajima on 14 June.

On 14 July, both ships were reassigned to Battleship Division 2 and "Nagato" became the flagship of the 1st Fleet. She remained in Japanese waters training until August 1942. "Mutsu" was transferred to the Advance Force of the <a href="2nd%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">2nd Fleet</a> on 9 August, and departed <a href="Yokosuka">Yokosuka</a> two days later to support operations during the <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a>. She arrived at <a href="Chuuk%20State">Truk</a> on 17 August. On 20 August, while sailing from Truk to rendezvous with the main body of <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Ch%C5%ABichi%20Nagumo">Chūichi Nagumo</a>'s <a href="3rd%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">3rd Fleet</a>, "Mutsu", the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> , and escorting destroyers unsuccessfully attempted to locate the <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a> in response to a flying boat detection of the American ship.

During the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 27 August, "Mutsu", assigned to the Support Force, fired four shells at enemy <a href="reconnaissance%20aircraft">reconnaissance aircraft</a> during what was her first, and only, action of the war. On 7 January 1943, "Mutsu" returned to Japan together with the carrier , the heavy cruiser and four destroyers. The ship prepared to sortie on 13 April to reinforce the Japanese garrisons in the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a> in response to the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Komandorski%20Islands">Battle of the Komandorski Islands</a>, but the operation was cancelled the next day and "Mutsu" resumed training.

On 8 June 1943, "Mutsu" was moored at Hashirajima when the magazine of her No. 3 turret exploded at 12:13, cutting the ship in half. The forward section <a href="capsized">capsized</a> almost immediately, but the rear section remained afloat until the early morning of the next day. Nearby ships were able to rescue 353 survivors from the 1,474 crew members and visitors aboard "Mutsu", meaning that 1,121 men were killed in the explosion. To avert the potential damage to morale from the loss of a battleship, "Mutsu"s loss was declared a state secret. To further prevent rumors from spreading, many survivors were reassigned to various garrisons in the Pacific Ocean.

The IJN convened a commission three days after the sinking to investigate the loss. It issued its preliminary conclusions on 25 June, well before the investigation of the wreck was completed, and decided that the explosion was the result of a disgruntled seaman. The commission failed to consider the possibility of fire, which historian Mike Williams considers to be a possible cause, as a number of observers noted smoke coming from the vicinity of No. 3 turret. The truth, however, will never be known.

"Nagato" transferred to <a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Truk</a> in the <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Caroline Islands</a> in August 1943. Together with the bulk of the 1st Fleet, she sortied in September and October in unsuccessful searches for American carriers. On 1 February 1944, "Nagato" departed Truk to avoid an American air raid, and arrived at <a href="Palau">Palau</a> three days later. The ship arrived on 21 February at <a href="Lingga%20Island">Lingga Island</a>, near Singapore, and she became the flagship of Vice Admiral <a href="Matome%20Ugaki">Matome Ugaki</a>, commander of Battleship Division 1, on 25 February until he transferred his flag to "Yamato" on 5 May. "Nagato" remained at Lingga until 11 May when she was transferred to <a href="Tawitawi">Tawitawi</a> on 12 May, and assigned to the <a href="1st%20Mobile%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Mobile Fleet</a>, under the command of Vice Admiral <a href="Jisabur%C5%8D%20Ozawa">Jisaburō Ozawa</a>.

Battleship Division 1 rendezvoused with Ozawa's main force on 16 June near the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Mariana Islands</a>, and "Nagato" escorted three aircraft carriers during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Philippine%20Sea">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a>. She was only lightly engaged during the battle, was not damaged, and suffered no casualties. After the battle, the ship returned to Japan where she was refitted with additional radars and light AA guns. "Nagato" loaded a regiment of the <a href="28th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">28th Infantry Division</a> and delivered them at Okinawa on 11 July before continuing on to Lingga.
In October 1944, the ship took part in "Operation "Sho"-1", an attack on the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> landings on <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Leyte</a>. Assigned to Vice Admiral <a href="Takeo%20Kurita">Takeo Kurita</a>'s 1st Diversion Force (also known as the Center Force), "Nagato" was attacked by multiple waves of American <a href="dive%20bombers">dive bombers</a> and <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a> during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Sibuyan%20Sea">Battle of the Sibuyan Sea</a> on 24 October en route to <a href="Leyte%20Gulf">Leyte Gulf</a>. She was struck twice by bombs that killed 52 crewmen, but was not seriously damaged.

The next morning, the 1st Diversion Force attacked the American forces supporting the invasion in the <a href="Battle%20off%20Samar">Battle off Samar</a>. "Nagato" engaged the escort carriers and destroyers of <a href="Task%20Group">Task Group</a> 77.4.3, codenamed "Taffy 3". She opened fire on three escort carriers, the first time she had fired her guns at an enemy ship, but missed. One of the defending destroyers fired a spread of torpedoes that missed their intended target and headed for "Yamato" and "Nagato" which were on a parallel course. The two battleships were forced to turn away north to avoid the torpedoes, and were 10 miles (16 km) away from the engagement before the torpedoes ran out of fuel. Turning back, "Nagato" engaged the American ships, claiming damage to one <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>. Later in the day, "Nagato" was hit in the bow by two bombs, but the damage was not severe.

The ship returned to Japan for repairs in mid-November. Lack of fuel and materials meant that she could not be brought back into service and she was turned into a <a href="floating%20battery">floating anti-aircraft battery</a>. Her funnel and mainmast were removed to improve the arcs of fire of her AA guns, which were increased by two Type 89 mounts and nine triple 25 mm gun mounts. Her forward secondary guns were removed in compensation. A coal-burning <a href="donkey%20boiler">donkey boiler</a> was installed on the <a href="pier">pier</a> for heating and cooking purposes and a converted <a href="submarine%20chaser">submarine chaser</a> was <a href="wikt%3Amoor">moored</a> alongside to provide steam and electricity; her anti-aircraft guns lacked full power and were only partially operational. On 20 April "Nagato" was reduced to reserve. In June 1945, all of her secondary guns and about half of her anti-aircraft armament was moved ashore, together with her rangefinders and <a href="searchlight">searchlight</a>s. Her crew was therefore reduced to less than 1,000 officers and enlisted men. On 18 July 1945, the heavily camouflaged ship <a href="Attack%20on%20Yokosuka">was attacked</a> by carrier-based fighter bombers and torpedo bombers. "Nagato" was hit by two bombs and a <a href="rocket">rocket</a> that killed 35 men and damaged four 25 mm guns. On 30 August, a few days before the <a href="Surrender%20of%20Japan">formal surrender</a>, American sailors took control of the ship.

"Nagato" was selected to participate as a target ship in <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a>, a series of U.S. nuclear weapon tests held at <a href="Bikini%20Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a> in mid-1946. In mid-March, "Nagato" departed Yokosuka for <a href="Eniwetok">Eniwetok</a>, but her hull had not been repaired from the underwater damage sustained during the attack on 18 July and she leaked enough that her pumps could not keep up. The ship had a <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> of seven degrees to port by the time <a href="tugboat">tugboat</a>s from Eniwetok arrived. She reached the <a href="atoll">atoll</a> on 4 April and Bikini in May.

Operation Crossroads began with the first blast (Test Able), an <a href="air%20burst">air burst</a> on 1 July 1946; "Nagato" was not close to <a href="ground%20zero">ground zero</a> and was only lightly damaged. For Test Baker, an <a href="underwater%20explosion">underwater explosion</a>, the ship was positioned closer to ground zero. "Nagato" rode out the <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a> of water from the explosion with little apparent damage; she had a slight starboard list of two degrees after the tsunami dissipated. A more thorough assessment could not be made because she was dangerously <a href="radioactive">radioactive</a>. Her list gradually increased over the next five days and she capsized during the night of 29/30 July. Opened to divers in 1996, "Nagato" was named by "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" as one of the top 10 <a href="wreck%20diving">wreck diving</a> sites in the world.

"Mutsu"s wreck in Japan was treated differently. In 1970, salvage operations began that lasted until 1978 and recovered about 75% of the ship. The salvagers recovered bodies of 849 crewmen killed during the explosion. In 1995, the Mutsu Memorial Museum declared that no further salvage operations were planned. The only significant portion of the ship that remains is a long section running from the bridge structure forward to the vicinity of No. 1 turret. The highest portion of the ship is below the surface. Many, but not all, artifacts are displayed at the Mutsu Memorial Museum in <a href="T%C5%8Dwa%2C%20Yamaguchi">Tōwa-Cho</a>. Since 1963, a memorial service has been held there every year on 8 June in honor of the crew.

Devil May Cry (video game)

The game was originally conceived in 1999 as "<a href="Resident%20Evil%204">Resident Evil 4</a>". Due to the staff feeling it would not fit the "<a href="Resident%20Evil">Resident Evil</a>" franchise, the project dropped its ties to "Resident Evil" and was made into its own story instead. "Devil May Cry" received prominent coverage in the video game media due to the impact it had in the action game genre, its high difficulty and the high overall scores given to it by professional reviewers. The game has sold more than three million copies, and spawned multiple sequels and prequels.

The gameplay consists of levels called "missions", where players must fight numerous enemies, perform <a href="Platform%20game">platforming</a> tasks, and occasionally solve puzzles to progress through the story. The player's performance in each mission is given a letter grade of A, B, C, or D, with an additional top grade of S. Grades are based on the time taken to complete the mission, the amount of "red orbs" gathered (the in-game currency obtained from defeated enemies), how "stylish" their combat was, item usage, and damage taken.
"Stylish" combat is defined as performing an unbroken series of varied attacks while avoiding damage, with player performance tracked by an on-screen gauge. The more hits the player makes, the higher the gauge rises. The gauge starts at "Dull"; progresses through "Cool", "Bravo", and "Absolute"; and peaks at "Stylish". Repeatedly using the same moves causes the gauge to stop rising, forcing the player to use every move in their arsenal. The gauge terms are similar to the grades given at the end of the missions. When Dante receives damage, the style rating resets back to "Dull". Players can also maintain their style grade by taunting enemies at close range.

The player can temporarily transform Dante into a more powerful demonic creature by using the "Devil Trigger" ability. Doing so adds powers based on the current weapon and changes Dante's appearance. The transformations typically increase strength and defense, slowly restore health, and grant special attacks. It is governed by the Devil Trigger gauge, which depletes as the ability is used, and is refilled by attacking enemies or taunting in normal form.

"Devil May Cry" contains puzzles and other challenges besides regular combat gameplay. The main storyline often requires the player to find key items to advance, in a manner similar to puzzles in the "<a href="Resident%20Evil">Resident Evil</a>" games, as well as optional platforming and exploration tasks to find hidden caches of "orbs". <a href="Quest%20%28video%20gaming%29">Side quests</a>, called "Secret Missions" in the game, are located in hidden or out-of-the-way areas and are not required for completion, but provide permanent <a href="power-up">power-up</a>s. They typically challenge the player to defeat a group of enemies in a specific manner or within a time limit.

"Devil May Cry" begins with Dante being attacked in his office by a mysterious woman named Trish. He impresses her by easily brushing off her assault, and tells her that he hunts demons in pursuit of those who killed his mother and brother. She says the attack was a test, and that the demon emperor Mundus, whom Dante holds responsible for the deaths of his family, is planning a return. The scene jumps to their arrival at an immense <a href="castle">castle</a>, whereupon Trish abruptly leaps and vanishes over a high wall.

Dante explores the castle and encounters the game's stock enemies, demonic marionettes. He also finds a new sword called Alastor, and battles the first <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss</a>, a giant <a href="spider">spider</a>/<a href="scorpion">scorpion</a> demon named Phantom. Dante wins the battle, but in what becomes a recurring theme, the defeated boss monster reappears a short time later in a corridor, forcing Dante to choose a narrow escape or to fight in the tight confines. After further exploration and combat, Dante battles a demon named Nelo Angelo who impresses Dante with his confidence. Dante manages to defeat Nelo Angelo and is about to deliver the final blow - but unfortunately, Nelo Angelo evades him, and counterattacks Dante furiously with a series of punches and kicks. The demon prepares to kill Dante, but suddenly flees upon seeing the half-<a href="amulet">amulet</a> Dante wears, which contains a picture of his mother. The demon attacks twice more in later missions, and is eventually revealed to be Dante's <a href="Twin%23Semi-identical%20twins">identical twin</a> brother, <a href="Vergil%20%28Devil%20May%20Cry%29">Vergil</a>. After Angelo/Vergil's death, his amulet joins with his brother's half, and "Force Edge", the game's default sword, which had belonged to the twins' father, changes into its true form and becomes the <a href="Characters%20of%20Devil%20May%20Cry%23Sparda">Sparda</a> sword.

When Dante next meets Trish, she betrays him and reveals that she too is working for Mundus, but when her life is endangered, Dante chooses to save her. Claiming he did so only because of her resemblance to his <a href="Characters%20of%20Devil%20May%20Cry%23Eva">mother</a>, he warns her to stay away. Yet when he finally confronts Mundus, who is about to kill Trish, Dante again chooses to save her and is injured. Mundus tries to finish him off, but Trish takes the attack instead. This unleashes Dante's full power, thus allowing him to take on the form of Sparda. Dante and Mundus then battle on another plane of existence.

Dante is victorious, and leaves the amulet and sword with Trish's immobile body before departing. Returning to the Human World, Dante finds that the island is collapsing, and is cornered by the injured Mundus, who has followed him back to the Human World. Dante fights Mundus, now back to his regular strength, when Trish also returns and lends Dante her power. Dante defeats Mundus, who vows to return and rule the human world. When Trish tries to apologize she begins to cry, and Dante tells her it means she has become human and not just a devil, because "devils never cry". Dante and Trish escape on a plane as the island collapses. After the credits, it is revealed that Dante and Trish are working together as partners, and have renamed the shop "Devil Never Cry".

First hinted at in early December 1999, "Devil May Cry" started out as the earliest incarnation of "<a href="Resident%20Evil%204">Resident Evil 4</a>". Initially developed for the PlayStation 2, the game was <a href="video%20game%20design%23Game%20designer">directed</a> by <a href="Hideki%20Kamiya">Hideki Kamiya</a> after producer <a href="Shinji%20Mikami">Shinji Mikami</a> requested him to create a new entry in the "Resident Evil" series. Around the turn of the millennium, regular series writer <a href="Noboru%20Sugimura">Noboru Sugimura</a> created a scenario for the title, based on Kamiya's idea to make a very cool and stylized <a href="action%20game">action game</a>. The story was based on unraveling the mystery surrounding the body of protagonist Tony, an invincible man with skills and an intellect exceeding that of normal people, his superhuman abilities explained with biotechnology. As Kamiya felt the playable character did not look brave and heroic enough in battles from a fixed angle, he decided to drop the prerendered backgrounds from previous "Resident Evil" installments and instead opted for a <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system%23Interactive">dynamic camera system</a>. This new direction required the team to make a trip to Europe where they spent eleven days in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="Spain">Spain</a> photographing things like <a href="Gothic%20art">Gothic</a> statues, bricks, and stone pavements for use in <a href="Texture%20mapping">textures</a>.

Though the developers tried to make the "coolness" theme fit into the world of "Resident Evil", Mikami felt it strayed too far from the series' survival horror roots and gradually convinced all of the staff members to make the game independent from it. Kamiya eventually rewrote the story to be set in a world full of demons, taking it from the Italian epic poem "<a href="Divine%20Comedy">Divine Comedy</a>" by <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a>; he changed the hero's name to "Dante". The title character from <a href="Buichi%20Terasawa">Buichi Terasawa</a>'s manga series "<a href="Cobra%20%28manga%29">Cobra</a>" served as the basis for Dante's personality. Kamiya based his idea of Dante on what he perceived as stylish: wearing a long coat to make the character "showy" and a non-smoker, as Kamiya saw that as "cool". The character wears red because, in Japan, it is a traditional color for a heroic figure. Kamiya has also stated he perceives Dante as "a character that you would want to go out drinking with", someone who was not a show-off but would instead "pull some ridiculous, mischievous joke" to endear people to him. He added that this aspect was intended to make the character feel familiar to audiences. The cast of characters remained largely identical to that in Sugimura's scenario, although appearances of the hero's mother and father were written out of the story. The game's new title was revealed as "Devil May Cry" in November 2000.

The game was developed by Team Little Devils, a group of staff members within <a href="Capcom%23Development%20studios">Capcom Production Studio 4</a>. Some of the major gameplay elements were partially inspired by a bug found in "". During a test-play, Kamiya discovered that enemies could be kept in the air by slashing them repeatedly, which led to the inclusion of juggles by gunfire and sword strikes in "Devil May Cry". According to the director, "Devil May Cry" was designed from the ground up around Dante's acrobatics and combat abilities. The decision was made late in the development process to change the game to a more mission-based advancement, instead of the more open-ended structure of the "Resident Evil" games. "Devil May Cry"s difficulty was intentional, according to Kamiya, who called it his "challenge to those who played light, casual games". 
"Devil May Cry" received a "Gold" sales award from the <a href="Entertainment%20and%20Leisure%20Software%20Publishers%20Association">Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association</a> (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. By July 2006, "Devil May Cry" had sold 1.1 million copies and earned $38 million in the United States alone. "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" ranked it as the 48th highest-selling game launched for the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>, <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> or <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of the "Devil May Cry" series reached 2 million units in the United States by July 2006.

The game received critical acclaim, with reviews from video game news websites typically praising its gameplay innovations, action, visuals, camera control, and <a href="Gothic%20fiction">gothic</a> ambience. The game also received positive reviews from video game print publications for similar reasons. "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" summarized their review by saying the game "makes "<a href="Resident%20Evil">Resident Evil</a>" look like a slow zombie". "Devil May Cry" also frequents several Top Video Games of All Time lists. Gamefury, for instance, listed "Devil May Cry" at #31 in their Top 40 Console Games of All Time feature. In 2010, <a href="IGN">IGN</a> listed it at #42 in their "Top 100 PlayStation 2 Games". Dante also received noteworthy praise to the point of becoming one of the most famous characters in gaming.

The game was also subject to criticism, however. "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" objected to the difficulty level, wondering if the challenge was added to prolong the gameplay. "<a href="EP%20Daily">The Electric Playground</a>" pointed to the unusual control scheme and lack of configuration options. <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> cited the camera's behavior, the learning curve for the controls, and graphical shortcomings such as <a href="Flicker%20%28screen%29">flickering</a> and <a href="jaggies">jagginess</a>. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> criticized the game's conclusion for its dramatic change in gameplay to a <a href="Shoot%20%27em%20up%23Tube%20and%20rail%20shooters">rail shooter</a>-like style at the story's climax, as well as a leveling-off of the difficulty. Lastly, Gamecritics felt that the story was overly short and the characters were underdeveloped.

"Devil May Cry" has spawned a sequel, "<a href="Devil%20May%20Cry%202">Devil May Cry 2</a>" and a prequel, "<a href="Devil%20May%20Cry%203">Devil May Cry 3</a>"; both of which have sold more than two million copies. A fourth game, "<a href="Devil%20May%20Cry%204">Devil May Cry 4</a>", was released on February 5, 2008 in the United States for <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> and <a href="Personal%20computer">PC</a>. Total sales for all versions as of February 10, 2016 is well over 3 million copies. The game has likewise resulted in the release of two <a href="Devil%20May%20Cry%20%28novels%29">novels</a> by Shinya Goikeda, and an . On October 15, 2004, three years after the game's release, a <a href="Discography%20of%20the%20Devil%20May%20Cry%20series%23Devil%20May%20Cry">soundtrack</a> containing the game's music was released alongside the soundtrack to "Devil May Cry 2". Plans for a <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> installment, tentatively titled "Devil May Cry Series", and a <a href="live%20action">live action</a> <a href="film%20adaptation">film adaptation</a> have been announced, although it was later confirmed in 2009 that the PSP adaptation of "Devil May Cry" was officially cancelled. A <a href="Reboot%20%28fiction%29">reboot</a> titled "" was released in 2013 by <a href="Ninja%20Theory">Ninja Theory</a> and Capcom. Kamiya considers his 2009 video game "<a href="Bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>" to have evolved from "Devil May Cry" although he played the sequel "Devil May Cry 4" when developing it. In a 2017 interview with "Dengeki PlayStation", Kamiya expressed interest in making a remake of "Devil May Cry". A fifth installment, "<a href="Devil%20May%20Cry%205">Devil May Cry 5</a>" was released on March 8, 2019.

"Devil May Cry" has been cited as the beginning of a subgenre of action games called "Extreme Combat", which focus on powerful heroes fighting hordes of foes with a focus on stylish action. The game has also been described as being the first game that "successfully captured the twitch-based, relentlessly free-flowing gameplay style of so many classic <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">2D</a> action games". The series has become the standard against which other <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> action games are measured, with comparisons in reviews of games including "<a href="God%20of%20War%20%28video%20game%29">God of War</a>", "<a href="Chaos%20Legion">Chaos Legion</a>", and "<a href="Blood%20Will%20Tell">Blood Will Tell</a>".

Operation PBHistory

Operation PBHistory was a covert operation carried out in <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a> by the United States <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA). It followed <a href="Operation%20PBSuccess">Operation PBSuccess</a>, which led to the overthrow of Guatemalan President <a href="Jacobo%20%C3%81rbenz">Jacobo Árbenz</a> in June 1954 and ended the <a href="Guatemalan%20Revolution">Guatemalan Revolution</a>. PBHistory attempted to use documents left behind by Árbenz's government and by organizations related to the communist <a href="Guatemalan%20Party%20of%20Labour">Guatemalan Party of Labour</a> to demonstrate that the <a href="Guatemalan%20government">Guatemalan government</a> had been under the influence of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, and to use those documents to obtain further intelligence that would be useful to US intelligence agencies. It was an effort to justify the overthrow of the elected Guatemalan government in response to the negative international reactions to PBSuccess. The CIA also hoped to improve its intelligence resources about communist parties in Latin America, a subject on which it had little information.

The first phase of the operation began soon after Árbenz's resignation on June 27, 1954: several agents were dispatched to Guatemala beginning on July 4. These included agents of the CIA and the <a href="Office%20of%20Intelligence%20Research">Office of Intelligence Research</a> (OIR). The first phase involved the collection of 150,000 documents from sources including Árbenz's personal possessions, trade union offices, and police agencies. The ruling military junta led by <a href="Carlos%20Castillo%20Armas">Carlos Castillo Armas</a> aided these efforts. Following a presentation made to US President <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a> on July 20, a decision was taken to accelerate the operation, and the number of people working in Guatemala was increased. The new team members posed as unaffiliated with the US government to maintain <a href="plausible%20deniability">plausible deniability</a>. The operation helped set up the Guatemalan <a href="National%20Committee%20of%20Defense%20Against%20Communism">National Committee of Defense Against Communism</a>, which was covertly funded by the CIA: agents of the committee became involved in PBHistory. The team studied over 500,000 documents in total, and finished processing documents on 28 September 1954.

PBHistory documents were used to support the CIA's existing operations <a href="Operation%20Kufire">Kufire</a> and <a href="Operation%20Kugown">Kugown</a>, which sought to track Latin American communists and to disseminate information critical of the Árbenz government. Documents were also shared with the <a href="Kersten%20Committee">Kersten Committee of the US House of Representatives</a>, which publicized PBHistory within the US. The documents uncovered by the operation proved useful to the Guatemalan intelligence agencies, enabling the creation of a register of suspected communists. Operation PBHistory did not succeed in its chief objective of finding evidence that the Guatemalan communists were being controlled by the Soviet government, and was unable to counter the international narrative that the United States had toppled the government of Jacobo Árbenz to serve the interests of the <a href="United%20Fruit%20Company">United Fruit Company</a>.

The <a href="Guatemalan%20Revolution%23October%20Revolution">October revolution</a> of 1944 in Guatemala led to the election of <a href="Juan%20Jos%C3%A9%20Ar%C3%A9valo">Juan José Arévalo</a> as President of Guatemala, who initiated reforms based on liberal capitalism. Arévalo was an anti-communist, and cracked down on the communist <a href="Guatemalan%20Party%20of%20Labour">Guatemalan Party of Labour</a> ("Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo", PGT). The US government was nonetheless suspicious that he was under the influence of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Arévalo's defense minister <a href="Jacobo%20%C3%81rbenz">Jacobo Árbenz</a> was <a href="Guatemalan%20presidential%20election%2C%201950">elected president in 1950</a>. Influenced partly by <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>, the US government was predisposed to see communist influence in Árbenz's government, particularly after the legalization of the PGT. Árbenz also had personal ties to some PGT members. In 1952 Árbenz began an <a href="Decree%20900">agrarian reform program</a> that transferred uncultivated land from large landowners to poor laborers in return for compensation. In response the US-based <a href="United%20Fruit%20Company">United Fruit Company</a>, which had large landholdings in Guatemala, intensively lobbied the US government for Árbenz's overthrow.

US President <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a> authorized a <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) operation to overthrow Árbenz, code-named <a href="1954%20Guatemalan%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">Operation PBSuccess</a> in August 1953. Within the CIA, the operation was headed by <a href="Frank%20Wisner">Frank Wisner</a>, who had worked in the US intelligence services since World War II. While preparations for Operation PBSuccess were underway, the US government issued a series of statements denouncing the Guatemalan government, alleging that it had been infiltrated by communists. On 18 June 1954 <a href="Carlos%20Castillo%20Armas">Carlos Castillo Armas</a>, a <a href="Guatemalan%20armed%20forces">Guatemalan army</a> Colonel in exile since a <a href="Guatemalan%20Revolution%231949%20coup%20attempt">failed coup</a> in 1949, led an invasion force of 480 men into Guatemala. The invasion was supported by a campaign of <a href="psychological%20warfare">psychological warfare</a>, which presented Castillo Armas's victory as a "fait accompli" to the Guatemalan people. Worried by the possibility of a US invasion, the Guatemalan army refused to fight, and on June 27 Árbenz resigned.

The actions of the United States resulted in international outrage. Media outlets across the world accused the US of sponsoring a coup to reverse Árbenz's agrarian reform in the interests of the United Fruit Company. This criticism was influenced by the coverage put out by media outlets in communist-controlled countries, but was repeated in the media in countries that were US allies, with Britain's <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> and the Swedish <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party">Social Democratic Party</a> joining in. Latin American opposition to the US reached a new peak: author Daniel James stated that "No one could recall so intense and universal a wave of anti-US sentiment in the entire history of Latin America." Although people within the US saw the coup as a triumph for US foreign policy, CIA officials felt that in order for Operation PBSuccess to be termed a success, further action was needed. Thus, the CIA was interested in finding documents that would allow it to portray the administration of Árbenz as being controlled by Soviet communists, and thus to justify the coup.

Due to the quick overthrow of the Árbenz government, the CIA believed that the government and the PGT leaders would not have been able to destroy any incriminating documents, and that these could be analyzed to demonstrate Árbenz's supposed ties to the Soviet Union. According to historian <a href="Nick%20Cullather">Nick Cullather</a>, Wisner hoped to "expose Soviet machinations throughout the hemisphere". The CIA also believed that it could better understand the workings of Latin American communist parties, on which subject the CIA had very little information. Although there had been an active communist movement in Latin America since 1919, it had largely been clandestine, and the CIA knew little about the methods that parties like the PGT used. The CIA hoped that PGT records left behind in haste would enable its international Communism Division to reconstruct the party's leadership and organizational structure, and possibly do the same for other communist parties in the region.

The CIA also hoped to exploit the aftermath of the coup to bolster its own intelligence resources. Wisner, who was serving as <a href="Deputy%20Director%20for%20Plans">Deputy Director for Plans</a> at the time of the coup, hoped to recruit agents both from among communists who wanted to defect, and from other Guatemalans who might become a part of the new government. In Wisner's words, he wished to identify "people who can be controlled and exploited to further US policy". Furthermore, the agency hoped to use the findings of the operation to demonstrate the extent of Soviet influence for propaganda purposes, and also to use the information gathered to completely eliminate any communist influence in Guatemala.

On June 30, 1954, three days after the resignation of Árbenz, Wisner sent a telegram that later became known as the "shift of gears cable". Two agents from the CIA, and two from the <a href="Office%20of%20Intelligence%20Research">Office of Intelligence Research</a> (OIR), arrived in Guatemala City on July 4. Castillo Armas had arrived in the capital on the previous day to assume the presidency. One of the CIA officers was Lothar Metzl, who was on the <a href="counterintelligence">counterintelligence</a> staff of the CIA. Metzl was an Austrian, who had studied communist movements since the 1930s, including in Europe. In Wisner's words, the agents were supposed to perform a "snatch job on documents while the melon was freshly burst open".

The initial targets of the operation were the personal possessions and documents of Árbenz and those of <a href="Carlos%20Enrique%20D%C3%ADaz">Carlos Enrique Díaz</a> (who had been chief of the armed forces under Árbenz, and briefly his successor as president), the offices of trade unions, known front organizations, police agencies, and the headquarters of the <a href="Partido%20Guatemalteco%20del%20Trabajo">Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo</a> (PGT). The results of the initial searches were disappointing for the CIA; many of the offices had already been plundered both by the Guatemalan army and by other looters. The CIA were particularly interested in finding documents that mentioned the Árbenz government's purchase of weapons from <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, but they were unsuccessful. They were also unsuccessful in finding any evidence that the Soviet Union had controlled the communist movement in Guatemala.

Despite these difficulties, the agents collected 150,000 documents, in addition to a number of government files, which the agency judged to be useful. The CIA received assistance in collecting these from Castillo Armas's junta, and from the Guatemalan army. The haul was described as the "greatest catch of documents ever left behind by a Communist Party and its auxiliaries". Most of these had nothing but "local significance". Although no documents were discovered demonstrating Soviet influence, the CIA hoped to use the large number of papers to show that the communists in Guatemala had had a large influence over the government, through institutions like labor unions, peasant organizations, student unions, and youth groups.

On July 20, the CIA agents presented the results of their first two weeks of work in Washington. At Wisner's request, <a href="Tracy%20Barnes">Tracy Barnes</a>—principal manager of CIA operations in PBSuccess—created a booklet from these documents to show to US President Dwight Eisenhower. The 23 documents in the booklet included communist literature owned by Árbenz, such as a Chinese study on agrarian reform and some Marxist volumes, as well as diplomatic records implying communist sympathies, and a biography of <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> belonging to Árbenz's wife <a href="Maria%20Cristina%20Villanova%20de%20%C3%81rbenz">Maria Cristina Villanova</a>. After the presentation, Wisner decided that the examination of the seized documents needed to proceed faster, and so expanded the group of agents working in Guatemala.

One of the aims of the new team was to help Castillo Armas establish an intelligence agency that would be able to fight communism in Guatemala. Castillo Armas was pressured to create an anti-communist task force, which he did on July 20—creating the <a href="National%20Committee%20of%20Defense%20Against%20Communism">National Committee of Defense Against Communism</a> ("Comité de Defensa Nacional contra el Comunismo"). The purpose of this group was to create an anti-communist bureaucracy and intelligence service and to organize records and facilitate PBHistory. The "Comité" secretly received funds from the CIA, with the understanding that this fact could prove "very embarrassing" and that a new source would eventually need to be found. Although the "Comité" was theoretically an intelligence agency, it also had some police powers. It could order the arrest of anybody suspected of being a communist, and had oversight over all army and police authorities. The CIA team was supposed to help it set up by creating a nucleus of information about people associated with the PGT.

The "Comité" was not, however, granted the power to arrest or search house of prominent government officials who had served under Árbenz. This was largely because Castillo Armas and other military leaders lacked trust in the "Comité". Nevertheless, the "Comité" was able to conduct personal searches of exiles as they left the country. This proved to be ineffective as very few documents proved to be revealing.

On August 4, a new and larger US contingent was deployed to Guatemala. In order to remain covert, this group identified itself to Armas as the "Social Research Group", composed of businessmen and experts from universities. It consisted of eight CIA officers, three men from the State Department, and one from the US Information Agency. It was led by an officer working under the pseudonym "Francis T. Mylkes," and included <a href="David%20Atlee%20Phillips">David Atlee Phillips</a>, who was fluent in Spanish and had been part of the PBSuccess team. The group presented itself as unaffiliated with the US government in order to avoid nationalist backlash and to maintain <a href="plausible%20deniability">plausible deniability</a>. The new PBHistory group worked directly with the new Guatemalan "Comité" training its 25 agents and using them to procure documents; the training covered topics including screening, organizing, and classifying confiscated documents, as well as "the rudiments of mail control, logging, abstracting, and cryptic reference".

Eventually, the 25 personnel of the "Comité" joined the CIA officers in sorting and processing the seized documents. The CIA officers had a separate side entrance to the building in which the operations took place, in order to maintain the image that the operation was a Guatemalan internal affair. The task of sorting through the papers proved to be daunting: by September, the main index of the material contained 15,800 cards. All hand-written material was preserved, and multiple copies of printed material were kept. Every document had to be reproduced, because the original copies of each one were to remain in Guatemala. Approximately half of the paper that had been gathered was incinerated. The CIA gave the highest priority to the documents seized from the PGT.

By September 1954, the PBHistory agents had found only a small number of top secret documents. Some of the documents showed that government officials and communist party leaders had been able to dispose of most of the sensitive material before they left. In the period of uncertain leadership that followed Árbenz's overthrow, a member of one of the series of ruling juntas had prevented the "Comité" from searching the homes of private citizens, and from arresting them, which potentially reduced the number of sensitive documents the CIA had access to. Additionally, Castillo Armas stated after taking power that the intelligence information of the army had been completely destroyed.

The CIA finished processing documents on September 28, 1954. By this point, the agents had parsed through more than 500,000 unique documents. Photostatic copies were taken of 2,095 important documents, 750 photographs of the material were published for the use of the media, and 50,000 documents were microfilmed. Copies of a handful of important documents were distributed to the various agencies that had been a part of PBHistory, as well as the US <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>.

The agencies that participated in Operation PBHistory had different aims in mind for the products of the operation. The CIA was most interested in using the information gathered against communist movements in Latin America and elsewhere. The State Department wanted to use them to reconstruct the history of the communist party within Guatemala, while the highest priority of the <a href="United%20States%20Information%20Agency">United States Information Agency</a> was to use the documents to release information that could be used to change international opinion. The agents in charge of the operation were expected to balance these interests: however, as the organization behind the operation, the CIA had veto power over any public use. The work done by the PBHistory team assisted two existing CIA operations, <a href="Operation%20Kufire">Operation Kufire</a> and <a href="Operation%20Kugown">Operation Kugown</a>, both of which had been a part of Operation PBSuccess.

Operation Kufire was a wide-ranging effort to track communists from various countries across Latin America who had come to Guatemala during the presidency of Árbenz. The CIA expected that these individuals would return to their home countries, or to other countries that had liberal policies about political asylum, and by tracking them, the CIA hoped to disrupt their activities. During the course of this operation, a CIA analyst asked Philips whether to open a file on a 25-year old physician, who did not at the time appear to be particularly threatening. Philips said yes, thereby opening a file on <a href="Che%20Guevara">Ernesto "Che" Guevara</a>, which would quickly become one of the thickest files the CIA had on a single individual. Few other documents resulted in files that were of enduring value to the CIA.

Operation Kugown was the name given to the psychological warfare operation that had played an important part in the overthrow of Árbenz. During the coup, its primary targets had been the Árbenz government. After the conclusion of the coup, Kugown continued, targeting the rest of Guatemala, and the wider international audience. The aim of the operation was to disseminate derogatory information about Árbenz, and to convince Guatemalans—and the rest of the world—that Árbenz's regime had been communist-dominated. The use of documents from PBHistory for Operation Kugown began in August 1954. The standard method employed by the CIA was to select a document that could be portrayed as incriminating and write an explanation covering it. This would then be released to the press by the "Comité", so that the local agency could receive some credit. The "Comité" also released a short documentary film, titled "Despues Descubrimos La Verdad" (""Later We Discover the Truth""). Through these avenues news media in Guatemala and elsewhere in Central America were saturated with stories of how the Árbenz government had been controlled by communists.

While the press releases had a substantial impact within Guatemala, the CIA was unable to staunch the continued criticism of the US role in the coup, which came from virtually all countries except for <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> and the US itself. Very few news agencies chose to run the press releases from the "Comité", even though a number of them were put out. Information was sent to press agencies worldwide describing infiltration by the PGT and links among Communists elsewhere; nonetheless, their impact remained minimal. The lack of attention frustrated the PBHistory agents to the point where they planned to stage a <a href="false%20flag">false flag</a> attack on their own headquarters, which would later be described as the work of Guatemala's remaining communists. However, the CIA decided that such an attack would need the cooperation of too many "indigenous" people, and the plan was scrapped as being too risky. Operation Kugown also released a large quantity of communist propaganda material that had entered Guatemala from countries within the Soviet sphere of influence; these convinced American journalists such as Donald Grant, of the "<a href="St.%20Louis%20Post-Dispatch">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a>", that there must have been a connection between Árbenz and the Soviet government. Ultimately, these operations were unsuccessful in convincing Latin America that the 1954 coup was justified.

Information from the PBHistory documents was disseminated by the officials of both the US and Guatemalan governments. US ambassador <a href="Henry%20Cabot%20Lodge">Henry Cabot Lodge</a> made use of 21 documents in a speech he made at the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>. Information was also funneled to US ambassadors and Congresspeople. The US Congress in 1954 was among the few <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican controlled</a> Congresses in many years. Republicans sought to use an anti-communist push to generate support for themselves and to erode the voting base of the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic party</a>. Anti-Communist members of the US Congress, such as <a href="Charles%20J.%20Kersten">Charles J. Kersten</a> and <a href="Patrick%20J.%20Hillings">Patrick J. Hillings</a> of the <a href="Kersten%20Committee">Kersten Committee</a>, enthusiastically involved themselves with PBHistory. By August 1954, Kersten was receiving PBHistory documents from Dulles so he could use them in speeches to Congress about the Soviet Union's influence in Guatemala. In September and October 1954, the Kersten Committee held hearings purportedly investigating the penetration of communist influence. PBHistory documents were used in this process, and Castillo Armas became the first head of state to testify before a US Congress committee (although he did so through the use of a tape recording of his testimony). Although the hearings did little to unearth information about communist presence in Guatemala, they provided Operation PBHistory with huge publicity within the US.

At the same time, the involvement of the Kersten committee and of Kersten and Hillings caused concern for the CIA. Dulles constantly worried that their investigation would damage CIA operations, particularly when Hillings visited Guatemala shortly before PBSuccess was to begin. Congresspeople had not officially been informed of the CIA's role in the coup, and Dulles wished to keep them uninformed. By supplying them with PBHistory documents, Dulles hoped to forestall them from inadvertently exposing the CIA's other projects. Following the hearings, a subcommittee headed by Hillings produced a final report. In addition to stating without evidence that the Guatemalan government had been acting under orders from the Soviet Union, this report falsely claimed that Soviet weapons had been brought covertly to Guatemala by submarine. This unintentionally drew attention to <a href="Operation%20Washtub%20%28Nicaragua%29">Operation Washtub</a>, a CIA effort to foist incriminating weapons on the Guatemalan government.

Once the CIA had stopped using the documents for propaganda purposes, the agents in charge of PBHistory decided that the best use of the documents they had uncovered would be to record the growth of the communist movement in Guatemala. This research was undertaken by the US State Department's Office of Intelligence Research. The OIR produced a 50-page report after five months of work; the State Department considered it the "definitive answer" to the question of how communism had arisen in Guatemala. The government of Honduras, which had allowed its territory to be used as a "staging area" for the coup against Árbenz, also made use of the PBHistory papers to justify its position. It argued that it had been facing interference in its internal matters from communists in Guatemala.

<a href="Max%20Holland">Max Holland</a>, analyzing PBHistory in 2004, wrote that although very few highly sensitive communist documents were found, the operation provided the CIA with its first detailed look at the development of a powerful communist movement. It also allowed them to set up a Guatemalan service that would work against the communists, and for these reasons, the CIA judged the operation to be a success. Historian <a href="Kate%20Doyle">Kate Doyle</a> stated that the documents uncovered by PBHistory allowed the CIA to create a register of suspected communists. The documents were described by participants as an "intelligence goldmine"; the register that the CIA left with the Guatemalan security forces contained information on thousands of citizens.

PBHistory documents were used for years afterward to discredit Árbenz (living in exile) and to counter Soviet propaganda about American imperialism in Guatemala. When Árbenz moved to <a href="Montevideo">Montevideo</a> in 1957, the CIA used the PBHistory documents to produce a biography of Árbenz that described him as a Soviet agent, in an attempt to prevent him from moving to Mexico, where opposition to Castillo Armas' regime was coalescing. Nonetheless, Árbenz remained a symbol of principled resistance to the United States, helped in part by Soviet propaganda to that effect. When some of the PBHistory documents were published, they received little attention in Latin America. Though PBSuccess was viewed positively within the US soon after it occurred, the violence perpetrated by the Guatemalan governments supported by the US in the 1970s and 1980s changed the perception of the coup among the US public.

Despite the report produced by the Office of Intelligence Research, by 1957 the CIA realized that its version of the history of the Árbenz government and the coup was not gaining traction. Books written by defenders of the Árbenz government, which were strongly critical of the US intervention, were generally better received. Nationalist Latin Americans were inclined to view the Castillo Armas government as a creation of the US. As a result, the US government decided to allow <a href="Ronald%20Schneider%20%28historian%29">Ronald Schneider</a>, a historian who was in the process of completing his <a href="Ph.D">Ph.D</a>, to access the PBHistory archive. Schneider published "Communism in Guatemala: 1944 to 1954" in 1959. Later observers have stated that the publication may have been subsidized in some way by the CIA: both the <a href="Foreign%20Policy%20Research%20Institute">Foreign Policy Research Institute</a>, where Schneider worked, and <a href="Frederick%20A.%20Praeger">Frederick A. Praeger</a>, who published Schneider's book, received CIA funds. Schneider stated in his book that the "Comité" was responsible for collecting the documents he accessed, but did not mention the CIA's role in funding the "Comité", nor did he explain how the documents came to the US. Schneider's book did not rely on PBHistory material alone, but also on information that he gathered during a trip to Mexico and Guatemala in 1957. The book was generally well received.

The operation failed in its main purpose, which was to find evidence that the government of Árbenz was under Soviet control. A CIA report published on October 1, 1954, stated that "'very few' 'Communist damaging' documents had been found". The US failed to persuade Latin Americans of its point of view on communism: most people viewed the reforms of the <a href="Guatemalan%20Revolution">Guatemalan Revolution</a> in a positive light, and even Schneider's account, described by Holland as a balanced portrayal, was unable to persuade the public that the Soviet Union was involved in the rise of Guatemalan communism. Political scientist Jeremy Gunn, who was given access to the material collected by the operation, stated that it "found no traces of Soviet control and substantial evidence that Guatemalan Communists acted alone, without support or guidance from outside the country". Nothing useful was discovered with respect to international communism either. In contrast, the Soviet government's portrayal was of a Guatemalan government that did not threaten the interests of the US, but which was nonetheless overthrown in order to protect the United Fruit Company. Over time, this description of the events became the favored one in Latin America.

The Soviet narrative was further strengthened in 1957, when Castillo Armas was overthrown and replaced with a highly reactionary government which further rolled back the reforms of the 1944 revolution; the Eisenhower administration did not react to the coup in any significant way. When <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, then US vice-president, visited Latin America in 1958, he encountered severe abuse wherever he went, even from people who were not communists or their sympathizers. PBHistory was also unable to change the strong resentment against the CIA that the Guatemalan coup had created. Writing in 2008 Gunn compared PBHistory to a similarly unsuccessful attempt by the US to justify the <a href="Iraq%20War">invasion of Iraq</a> after it had occurred. Historian Mark Hove has written that "Operation PBHistory proved ineffective because of 'a new, smoldering resentment' that had emerged in Latin America over US intervention in Guatemala."

Brown Dog affair

The Brown Dog affair was a political controversy about <a href="vivisection">vivisection</a> which raged in England from 1903 until 1910. It involved the infiltration of <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a> medical lectures by Swedish feminists, pitched battles between medical students and the police, police protection for the statue of a dog, a libel trial at the Royal Courts of Justice, and the establishment of a Royal Commission to investigate the use of animals in experiments. The affair became a "<a href="cause%20c%C3%A9l%C3%A8bre">cause célèbre</a>" which divided the country.

The controversy was triggered by allegations that <a href="William%20Bayliss">William Bayliss</a> of the Department of Physiology at <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a> performed an illegal vivisection in February 1903 before an audience of 60 medical students on a brown terrier dog. The dog was adequately anaesthetized according to Bayliss and his team, but it was conscious and struggling according to the Swedish activists. The procedure was condemned as cruel and unlawful by the <a href="National%20Anti-Vivisection%20Society">National Anti-Vivisection Society</a>. Bayliss's research on dogs led to the discovery of hormones, and he was outraged by the assault on his reputation. He sued for libel and won.

Anti-vivisectionists commissioned a bronze statue of the dog as a memorial, unveiled on the Latchmere Recreation Ground in <a href="Battersea">Battersea</a> in 1906, but medical students were angered by its provocative plaque: "Men and women of England, how long shall these Things be?" This led to frequent vandalism of the memorial and the need for a 24-hour police guard against the so-called anti-doggers. On 10 December 1907, 1,000 medical students marched through central London waving effigies of the brown dog on sticks and clashing with suffragettes, trade unionists, and 400 police officers, one of a series of battles known as the Brown Dog riots.

Battersea Council sent four workers accompanied by 120 police officers to remove the statue under cover of darkness in March 1910, after which it was reportedly melted down by the council's blacksmith—despite a 20,000-strong petition in its favour. A new statue of the brown dog was erected in Battersea Park in 1985, commissioned by anti-vivisection groups. According to Peter Mason in 1997, all that was left of the old statue was a hump in the pavement, the sign on a nearby fence reading "No Dogs".

There was significant opposition to vivisection in England in both houses of Parliament during the reign of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> (1837–1901); the Queen herself strongly opposed it. The term "vivisection" referred to the dissection of living animals, with and without anaesthesia, often in front of audiences of medical students. In 1875, there were approximately 300 experiments on animals in the UK, a figure that had risen to 19,084 in 1903 when the brown dog was vivisected.
Physiologists in the 19th century were frequently criticized for their work. French physiologist <a href="Claude%20Bernard">Claude Bernard</a> appears to have shared the distaste of his critics, who included his wife, referring to "the science of life" as a "superb and dazzlingly lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen". Irish <a href="Feminism">feminist</a> <a href="Frances%20Power%20Cobbe">Frances Power Cobbe</a> founded the <a href="National%20Anti-Vivisection%20Society">National Anti-Vivisection Society</a> (NAVS) in London in 1875 and the <a href="British%20Union%20for%20the%20Abolition%20of%20Vivisection">British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection</a> (BUAV) in 1898. The NAVS sought to restrict vivisection, and the BUAV sought to abolish it.

The opposition led the British government to set up the first Royal Commission on the "Practice of Subjecting Live Animals to Experiments for Scientific Purposes" in July 1875. The commission learned that researchers did not use anaesthetics regularly and recommended a series of measures, including a ban on experiments on dogs, cats, horses, donkeys, and mules. The General Medical Council and "British Medical Journal" objected, so additional protection was introduced instead. The result was the <a href="Cruelty%20to%20Animals%20Act%201876">Cruelty to Animals Act 1876</a>, criticized by NAVS as "infamous but well-named".

The Act stipulated that researchers could not be prosecuted for cruelty, but that the animal must be anaesthetized unless the anaesthesia would interfere with the point of the experiment. Each animal could be used only once, although several procedures were permitted if they were regarded as part of the same experiment. The animal had to be killed when the study was over, unless doing so would frustrate the object of the experiment. Prosecutions could take place only with the approval of the Home Secretary. At the time of the Brown Dog affair, this was <a href="Aretas%20Akers-Douglas%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Chilston">Aretas Akers-Douglas</a>, who was unsympathetic to the anti-vivisectionist cause.

In the early 20th century, <a href="Ernest%20Starling">Ernest Starling</a>, Professor of Physiology at University College London, and his brother-in-law <a href="William%20Bayliss">William Bayliss</a>, were using vivisection on dogs to determine whether the <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a> controls <a href="Pancreas">pancreatic</a> secretions, as postulated by <a href="Ivan%20Pavlov">Ivan Pavlov</a>. Bayliss had held a licence to practice vivisection since 1890 and had taught physiology since 1900. According to Starling's biographer John Henderson, Starling and Bayliss were "compulsive experimenters", and Starling's lab was the busiest in London. 

The men knew that the pancreas produces digestive juices in response to increased acidity in the <a href="duodenum">duodenum</a> and <a href="jejunum">jejunum</a>, because of the arrival of <a href="chyme">chyme</a> there. By severing the duodenal and jejunal nerves in anaesthetized dogs, while leaving the blood vessels intact, then introducing acid into the duodenum and jejunum, they discovered that the process is not mediated by a nervous response, but by a new type of chemical reflex. They named the chemical messenger <a href="secretin">secretin</a>, because it is secreted by the intestinal lining into the bloodstream, stimulating the pancreas on <a href="Circulatory%20system">circulation</a>. In 1905 Starling coined the term "<a href="hormone">hormone</a>"—from the Greek "hormao" meaning "I arouse" or "I excite"—to describe chemicals such as secretin that are capable, in extremely small quantities, of stimulating organs from a distance.

Bayliss and Starling had also used vivisection on anaesthetized dogs to discover <a href="peristalsis">peristalsis</a> in 1899. They went on to discover a variety of other important physiological phenomena and principles, many of which were based on their experimental work involving animal vivisection.

Starling and Bayliss's lectures had been attended by Swedish feminists and anti-vivisection activists <a href="Lizzy%20Lind%20af%20Hageby">Lizzy Lind af Hageby</a> and <a href="Leisa%20Katherine%20Schartau">Leisa Katherine Schartau</a>, who had known each other since childhood. The two women visited the <a href="Pasteur%20Institute">Pasteur Institute</a> in Paris in 1900, a centre of animal experimentation, and were shocked by the rooms full of caged animals given diseases by the researchers. They founded the Anti-Vivisection Society of Sweden when they returned home, and enrolled as students at the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Medicine%20for%20Women">London School of Medicine for Women</a> in 1902, a vivisection-free college that had visiting arrangements with other London colleges, to gain medical training for their anti-vivisectionist campaigns.

The two women attended 100 lectures and demonstrations at King's and University College, including 50 experiments on live animals, of which 20 were what Mason called "full-scale vivisection". They kept a diary, calling it "Eye-Witnesses" and later "The Shambles of Science: Extracts from the Diary of Two Students of Physiology" ("shambles" was a name for a slaughterhouse). The women were present when the brown dog was vivisected, and wrote a chapter about it entitled "Fun", referring to the laughter which they said they heard in the lecture room during the procedure.

According to Starling, the brown dog was "a small brown mongrel allied to a terrier with short roughish hair, about 14–15 lb [c. 6 kg] in weight". He was first used in a vivisection in December 1902 by Starling, who cut open his abdomen and <a href="Ligature%20%28medicine%29">ligated</a> the <a href="pancreatic%20duct">pancreatic duct</a>. For the next two months he lived in a cage, until Starling and Bayliss used him again for two procedures on 2 February 1903, the day the Swedish women were present.

Outside the lecture room before the students arrived, according to testimony Starling and others gave in court, Starling cut the dog open again to inspect the results of the previous surgery, which took about 45 minutes, after which he clamped the wound with forceps and handed the dog over to Bayliss. Bayliss cut a new opening in the dog's neck to expose the lingual nerves of the <a href="salivary%20gland">salivary gland</a>s, to which he attached electrodes. The aim was to stimulate the nerves with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of <a href="blood%20pressure">blood pressure</a>. The dog was then carried to the lecture theatre, stretched on his back on an operating board, with his legs tied to the board, his head clamped and his mouth muzzled.

According to Bayliss, the dog had been given a <a href="morphine">morphine</a> injection earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of <a href="A.C.E.%20mixture">alcohol, chloroform and ether</a> (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his <a href="Vertebrate%20trachea">trachea</a>, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that the dog had been adequately anaesthetized. They said the dog had appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, and that there was no smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but had merely twitched.

In front of around 60 students, Bayliss stimulated the nerves with electricity for half an hour, but was unable to demonstrate his point. The dog was then handed to a student, <a href="Henry%20Hallett%20Dale">Henry Dale</a>, a future Nobel laureate, who removed the dog's pancreas, then killed him with a knife through the heart. This became a point of embarrassment during the libel trial, when Bayliss's laboratory assistant, Charles Scuttle, testified that the dog had been killed with chloroform or the ACE mixture. After Scuttle's testimony Dale told the court that he had, in fact, used a knife.

On 14 April 1903 Lind af Hageby and Schartau showed their unpublished 200-page diary to the barrister <a href="Stephen%20Coleridge">Stephen Coleridge</a>, secretary of the National Anti-Vivisection Society. Stephen Coleridge was the son of <a href="John%20Coleridge%2C%201st%20Baron%20Coleridge">John Duke Coleridge</a>, former Lord Chief Justice of England, and great-grandson of the poet <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>. His attention was drawn to the account of the brown dog. The 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act forbade the use of an animal in more than one experiment, yet it appeared that the brown dog had been used by Starling to perform surgery on the pancreas, used again by him when he opened the dog to inspect the results of the previous surgery, and used for a third time by Bayliss to study the salivary glands. The diary said of the procedures on the brown dog:

The allegations of repeated use and inadequate anaesthesia represented "prima facie" violations of the Cruelty to Animals Act. In addition the diary said the dog had been killed by Henry Dale, an unlicensed research student, and that the students had laughed during the procedure; there were "jokes and laughter everywhere" in the lecture hall, it said.

According to Mason, Coleridge decided there was no point in relying on a prosecution under the Act, which he regarded as deliberately obstructive. Instead he gave an angry speech about the dog on 1 May 1903 to the annual meeting of the National Anti-Vivisection Society at <a href="St%20James%27s%20Church%2C%20Piccadilly">St James's Hall</a> in Piccadilly, attended by 2,000–3,000 people. Mason writes that support and apologies for absence were sent by writers <a href="Jerome%20K.%20Jerome">Jerome K. Jerome</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a> and <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>. Coleridge accused the scientists of torture: "If this is not torture, let Mr. Bayliss and his friends ... tell us in Heaven's name what torture is."

Details of the speech were published the next day by the radical "<a href="The%20Daily%20News%20%28UK%29">Daily News</a>" (founded in 1846 by <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>), and questions were raised in the House of Commons, particularly by Sir <a href="Frederick%20Banbury%2C%201st%20Baron%20Banbury%20of%20Southam">Frederick Banbury</a>, a Conservative MP and sponsor of a bill aimed at ending vivisection demonstrations. Bayliss demanded a public apology, and when by 12 May it had failed to materialize he issued a writ for libel.

Ernest Starling decided not to sue. "<a href="The%20Lancet">The Lancet</a>", no friend of Coleridge, wrote that "it may be contended that Professor Starling ... committed a technical infringement of the Act." Coleridge tried to persuade the women not to publish their diary before the trial began, but they went ahead anyway, and it was published by Ernest Bell of Covent Garden in July 1903.

The trial opened at the <a href="Royal%20Courts%20of%20Justice">Old Bailey</a> on 11 November 1903 before <a href="Richard%20Webster%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Alverstone">Lord Alverstone</a>, the Lord Chief Justice, and lasted four days, closing on 18 November. There were queues 30 yards long outside the courthouse. The "British Medical Journal" called it "a test case of the utmost gravity".

Bayliss's counsel, <a href="Rufus%20Isaacs%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Reading">Rufus Isaacs</a>, called Starling as his first witness. Starling admitted that he had broken the law by using the dog twice, but said that he had done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that the dog had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.

A veterinarian, Alfred Sewell, said the system Bayliss was using was unlikely to be adequate, but other witnesses, including Frederick Hobday of the Royal Veterinary College, disagreed; there was even a claim that Bayliss had used too much anaesthesia, which is why the dog had failed to respond to the electrical stimulation. Bayliss said the dog had been suffering from <a href="Chorea%20%28disease%29">chorea</a>, a disease that causes involuntary spasm, and that any movement Lind af Hageby and Schartau had seen was not purposive. Four students, three women and a man, were called by Bayliss's counsel and testified that the dog had appeared to be unconscious.

Coleridge's barrister, <a href="John%20Lawson%20Walton">John Lawson Walton</a>, called Lind af Hageby and Schartau. They repeated they had been the first students to arrive and had been left alone with the dog for about two minutes. They had observed scars from the previous operations and an incision in the neck where two tubes had been placed. They had not smelled the anaesthetic and had not seen any apparatus delivering it. They said, Mason wrote, that the dog had arched his back and jerked his legs in what they regarded as an effort to escape. When the experiment began the dog continued to "upheave its abdomen" and tremble, they said, movements they regarded as "violent and purposeful".

Bayliss's lawyer criticized Coleridge for having accepted the women's statements without seeking corroboration, and for speaking about the issue publicly without first approaching Bayliss, despite knowing that doing so could lead to litigation. Coleridge replied that he had not sought verification because he knew the claims would be denied, and that he continued to regard the women's statement as true. "The Times" wrote of his testimony: "The Defendant, when placed in the witness box, did as much damage to his own case as the time at his disposal for the purpose would allow."

Lord Alverstone told the jury that the case was an important one of national interest. He called "The Shambles of Science" "hysterical", but advised the jury not to be swayed by arguments about the validity of vivisection. After retiring for 25 minutes on 18 November 1903, the jury unanimously found that Bayliss had been defamed, to the applause of physicians in the public gallery. Bayliss was awarded £2,000 with £3,000 costs; Coleridge gave him a cheque the next day.

The "Daily News" asked for donations and raised £5,700 within four months to cover Coleridge's costs. Bayliss donated his damages to UCL for use in research; according to Mason, Bayliss ignored the "Daily Mail"s suggestion that he call it the "Stephen Coleridge Vivisection Fund". Gratzer wrote in 2004 that the fund may still have been in use then to buy animals.

"The Times" declared itself satisfied with the verdict, although it criticized the rowdy behaviour of medical students during the trial, accusing them of "medical hooliganism". The "Sun", "Star" and "Daily News" backed Coleridge, calling the decision a miscarriage of justice. Ernest Bell, publisher and printer of "The Shambles of Science", apologized to Bayliss on 25 November, and pledged to withdraw the diary and pass its remaining copies to Bayliss's solicitors.

The <a href="Animal%20Defence%20and%20Anti-Vivisection%20Society">Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society</a>, founded by Lind af Hageby in 1903, republished the book, printing a fifth edition by 1913. The chapter "Fun" was replaced by one called "The Vivisections of the Brown Dog", describing the experiment and the trial. The novelist <a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a> kept a copy of it on a table for visitors. According to historian <a href="Hilda%20Kean">Hilda Kean</a>, the <a href="Research%20Defence%20Society">Research Defence Society</a>, a lobby group founded in 1908 to counteract the antivivisectionist campaign, discussed how to have the revised editions withdrawn.

In December 1903 <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a>, who opposed vivisection, published a short story, "<a href="A%20Dog%27s%20Tale">A Dog's Tale</a>", in "Harper's", written from the point of view of a dog whose puppy is experimented on and killed. Given the timing and Twain's views, the story may have been inspired by the libel trial, according to Mark Twain scholar <a href="Shelley%20Fisher%20Fishkin">Shelley Fisher Fishkin</a>. Coleridge ordered 3,000 copies of "A Dog's Tale", which were specially printed for him by "Harper's".

The government appointed the Second Royal Commission on Vivisection on 17 September 1906. It heard evidence from scientists and anti-vivisection groups; Ernest Starling addressed the commission for three days in December 1906.

After much delay (two of its ten members died and several fell ill), the commission reported its findings in March 1912. Its 139-page report recommended an increase in the number of full-time inspectors from two to four; restrictions on the use of <a href="curare">curare</a>, a poison used to immobilize animals during experiments; the euthanasia of animals in severe pain, even if it meant frustrating the experiment; and the tightening of the definition and practice of <a href="Pithing%23In%20biology%20classes">pithing</a>. It also recommended the maintenance of more detailed records and the establishment of a committee to advise the Secretary of State on matters related to the Cruelty to Animals Act. The latter became the <a href="Animal%20Procedures%20Committee">Animal Procedures Committee</a> under the <a href="Animals%20%28Scientific%20Procedures%29%20Act%201986">Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986</a>.

After the trial Anna Louisa Woodward, founder of the World League Against Vivisection, raised £120 for a public memorial, and commissioned a bronze statue of the dog from sculptor <a href="Joseph%20Whitehead%20%28sculptor%29">Joseph Whitehead</a>. The statue sat on top of a granite memorial stone, 7 ft 6 in (2.29 m) tall, that housed a drinking fountain for human beings and a lower trough for dogs and horses. It also carried an inscription "(right)", described by "The New York Times" in 1910 as the "hysterical language customary of anti-vivisectionists" and "a slander on the whole medical profession."

The group turned to the borough of Battersea for a location for the memorial. Lansbury wrote that the area was a hotbed of radicalism—proletarian, socialist, full of belching smoke and slums, and closely associated with the anti-vivisection movement. The <a href="Battersea%20General%20Hospital">National Anti-Vivisection and Battersea General Hospital</a>—opened in 1896, on the corner of Albert Bridge Road and <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales%20Drive%2C%20London">Prince of Wales Drive</a>, and closed in 1972—refused until 1935 to perform vivisection or employ doctors who engaged in it, and was known locally as the "antiviv" or the "old anti". The chairman of the <a href="Battersea%20Dogs%20Home">Battersea Dogs Home</a>, <a href="William%20Cavendish-Bentinck%2C%206th%20Duke%20of%20Portland">William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland</a>, rejected a request in 1907 that its lost dogs be sold to vivisectors as "not only horrible, but absurd".

Battersea council agreed to provide space for the statue on its Latchmere Recreation Ground, part of the council's new Latchmere Estate, which offered terraced homes to rent for seven and sixpence a week. The statue was unveiled on 15 September 1906 in front of a large crowd, with speakers that included <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> and the Irish feminist <a href="Charlotte%20Despard">Charlotte Despard</a>.

Medical students at London's teaching hospitals were enraged by the plaque. The first year of the statue's existence was a quiet one, while University College explored whether they could take legal action over it, but from November 1907 the students turned Battersea into the scene of frequent disruption.

The first action was on 20 November, when undergraduate William Howard Lister led a group of students across the Thames to Battersea to attack the statue with a crowbar and sledgehammer. Ten of them were arrested by just two police officers. According to Mason, a local doctor told the "South Western Star" that this signalled the "utter degeneration" of junior doctors: "I can remember the time when it was more than 10 policemen could do to take one student. The Anglo-Saxon race is played out."

Several students were fined £5 by the magistrate, Paul Taylor, at South-West London Police Court in Battersea. This triggered another protest two days later, when 1,000 medical students from UCL, King's, Guy's and the West Middlesex hospitals marched along the Strand toward King's College, waving miniature brown dogs on sticks and a life-sized effigy of the magistrate, and singing, "Let's hang Paul Taylor on a sour apple tree / As we go marching on." "The Times" reported that they tried to burn the effigy but, unable to light it, threw it in the Thames instead.

Women's <a href="suffrage">suffrage</a> meetings were invaded, though the students knew that not all suffragettes were anti-vivisectionists. A meeting organized by <a href="Millicent%20Fawcett">Millicent Fawcett</a> on 5 December 1907 was left with chairs and tables smashed and one steward with a torn ear. The "Daily Express" reported it as "Medical Students Gallant Fight with Women."

The rioting reached its height five days later, on Tuesday, 10 December, when 100 medical students tried to pull the memorial down. The previous protests had been spontaneous, but this one was organized to coincide with the annual <a href="The%20Varsity%20Match">Oxford-Cambridge rugby match</a> at <a href="Queen%27s%20Club">Queen's Club</a>, West Kensington. The protesters hoped (in vain, as it turned out) that some of the thousands of Oxbridge students would swell their numbers. The intention was that, after toppling the statue and throwing it in the Thames, 2,000–3,000 students would meet at 11:30 pm in <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a>. Street vendors sold handkerchiefs stamped with the date of the protest and the words, "Brown Dog's inscription is a lie, and the statuette an insult to the London University."

In the afternoon protesters headed for the statue, but were driven off by locals. The students proceeded down Battersea Park Road instead, intending to attack the Anti-Vivisection Hospital, but were again forced back. When one student fell from the top of a <a href="tram">tram</a>, the workers shouted that it was "the brown dog's revenge" and refused to take him to hospital. The "British Medical Journal" responded that, given that it was the Anti-Vivisection Hospital, the crowd's actions may have been "prompted by benevolence".

A second group of students headed for central London, waving effigies of the brown dog, joined by a police escort and, briefly, a busker with bagpipes. As the marchers reached Trafalgar Square, they were 1,000 strong, facing 400 police officers, 15 of them on horseback. The students gathered around <a href="Nelson%27s%20Column">Nelson's Column</a>, where the ringleaders climbed onto its base to make speeches.

While students fought with police on the ground, mounted police charged the crowd, scattering them into smaller groups and arresting the stragglers, including one Cambridge undergraduate, Alexander Bowley, who was arrested for "barking like a dog". The fighting continued for hours before the police gained control. At Bow Street magistrate's court the next day, ten students were bound over to keep the peace; several were fined 40 shillings, or £3 if they had fought with police.

Rioting broke out elsewhere over the following days and months, as medical and veterinary students united. When Lizzy Lind af Hageby arranged a meeting of the Ealing and Acton Anti-Vivisection Society at Acton Central Hall on 11 December 1906, over 100 students disrupted it, throwing chairs and stink bombs when she tried to speak. The "Daily Chronicle" reported: "The rest of Miss Lind-af-Hageby's indignation was lost in a beautiful 'eggy' atmosphere that was now rolling heavily across the hall. 'Change your socks!' shouted one of the students." Furniture was smashed and clothing torn.

For Susan McHugh of the University of New England, the political coalition that rallied to the statue's defence reflected the brown dog's mongrel status. The riots saw trade unionists, socialists, Marxists, liberals and suffragettes descend on Battersea to fight the medical students, even though, she writes, the suffragettes were not a group toward whom male workers felt any warmth. But the "Brown Terrier Dog Done to Death" by the male scientific establishment united them all.

Lizzy Lind af-Hageby and Charlotte Despard saw the affair as a battle between <a href="feminism">feminism</a> and <a href="machismo">machismo</a>. According to <a href="Coral%20Lansbury">Coral Lansbury</a>, the fight for <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">women's suffrage</a> became closely linked with the anti-vivisection movement. Three of the four vice-presidents of the National Anti-Vivisection Hospital were women. Lansbury argues that the Brown Dog affair became a matter of opposing symbols, the iconography of vivisection striking a chord with women. The vivisected dog on the operating board blurred into images of suffragettes force-fed in <a href="Brixton%20Prison">Brixton Prison</a>, or women strapped down for childbirth or forced to have their ovaries and uteruses removed as a cure for "<a href="Female%20hysteria">mania</a>".

Both sides saw themselves as heirs to the future. <a href="Hilda%20Kean">Hilda Kean</a> writes that the Swedish activists were young and female, anti-establishment and progressive, and viewed the scientists as remnants of a previous age. Their access to higher education had made the case possible, creating what feminist scholar Susan Hamilton called a "new form of witnessing". Against this, Lansbury writes, the students saw themselves and their teachers as the "New Priesthood", and the women and trade unionists as representatives of superstition and sentimentality.

Questions were asked in the House of Commons about the cost of policing the statue, which required six constables a day at a cost of £700 a year. London's police commissioner wrote to Battersea Council to ask that they contribute to it. Councillor <a href="John%20Archer%20%28British%20politician%29">John Archer</a>, later Mayor of Battersea and the first black mayor in London, told the "Daily Mail" that he was amazed by the request, considering Battersea was already paying £22,000 a year in police rates. The <a href="Dogs%20Trust">Canine Defence League</a> wondered whether, if Battersea were to organize raids on laboratories, the laboratories would be asked to pay the policing costs themselves.

Other councillors suggested the statue be encased in a steel cage and surrounded by a barbed wire fence. Suggestions were made through the letters pages of the "Times" and elsewhere that it be moved, perhaps to the grounds of the Anti-Vivisection Hospital. The "British Medical Journal" wrote in March 1910:

Battersea Council grew tired of the controversy. A new Conservative council was elected in November 1909 amid talk of removing the statue. There were protests in support of it, and the 500-strong Brown Dog memorial defence committee was established. Twenty thousand people signed a petition, and 1,500 attended a rally in February 1910 addressed by Lind af Hageby, Charlotte Despard and Liberal MP <a href="George%20Greenwood">George Greenwood</a>. There were more demonstrations in central London and speeches in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park</a>, with supporters wearing masks of dogs.

The protests were to no avail. The statue was quietly removed before dawn on 10 March 1910 by four council workmen, accompanied by 120 police officers. Nine days later, 3,000 anti-vivisectionists gathered in Trafalgar Square to demand its return, but it was clear by then that Battersea Council had turned its back on the affair. The statue was at first hidden in the borough surveyor's bicycle shed, according to a letter his daughter wrote in 1956 to the "British Medical Journal", then reportedly destroyed by a council blacksmith, who melted it down. Anti-vivisectionists filed a High Court petition demanding its return, but the case was dismissed in January 1911.

On 12 December 1985, over 75 years after the statue's removal, a new memorial to the brown dog was unveiled by actress <a href="Geraldine%20James">Geraldine James</a> in Battersea Park behind the Pump House. Created by sculptor <a href="Nicola%20Hicks">Nicola Hicks</a> and commissioned by the National Anti-Vivisection Society and the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, the new dog is mounted on a <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> plinth and based on Hicks's own terrier, Brock. Peter Mason describes it as "a coquettish contrast to its down-to-earth predecessor".

Echoing the fate of the previous memorial, the new dog was moved into storage in 1992 by Battersea Park's owners, the Conservative <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Wandsworth">Borough of Wandsworth</a>, they said as part of a park renovation scheme. Anti-vivisectionists campaigned for its return, suspicious of the explanation. It was reinstated in the park's Woodland Walk in 1994, near the Old English Garden, a more secluded spot than before.

The new statue was criticized in 2003 by historian <a href="Hilda%20Kean">Hilda Kean</a>. She saw the old Brown Dog as a radical statement, upright and defiant, not begging for mercy: "The dog has changed from a public image of defiance to a pet". For Kean, the new Brown Dog, located near the Old English Garden as "heritage", is too safe; unlike its controversial ancestor, she argues, it makes no one uncomfortable.

NoitulovE

noitulovE ("<a href="Evolution">Evolution</a>" backwards) is a British <a href="Television%20advertisement">television and cinema</a> <a href="advertising">advertisement</a> launched by <a href="Diageo">Diageo</a> in 2005 to promote <a href="Guinness">Guinness Draught</a> <a href="stout">stout</a>. The 60-second piece formed the cornerstone of a <a href="Pound%20Sterling">£</a>15 million <a href="advertising%20campaign">advertising campaign</a> targeting men in their late twenties and early thirties. The commercial shows, in reverse, the adventures of three characters who evolve from <a href="mudskipper">mudskipper</a>s to present day humans before tasting Guinness in a London <a href="public%20house">pub</a>. The commercial was handled by the <a href="advertising%20agency">advertising agency</a> <a href="Abbott%20Mead%20Vickers%20BBDO">Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO</a>, with a budget of £1.3M. It was directed by <a href="Daniel%20Kleinman">Daniel Kleinman</a>. Production was contracted to <a href="Kleinman%20Productions">Kleinman Productions</a>, with <a href="post-production">post-production</a> by <a href="Framestore%20CFC">Framestore CFC</a>. It premiered on <a href="British%20television">British television</a> on 3 October 2005.

"noitulovE" is the fifth television/cinema piece in the <a href="Good%20things%20come%20to%20those%20who%20wait%20%28Guinness%29">Good things come to those who wait</a> series, and its premiere marked the end of a four-year hiatus. The advert and its associated campaign were a critical and financial success. It received over 30 awards from professional organisations in the advertising and television industries, and was the most-awarded commercial worldwide in 2006. The impact of the campaign was such that during a period in which the UK beer market experienced a substantial decline in <a href="revenue">revenue</a>, Guinness reported that its year-on-year earnings within the region had noticeably increased. At the same time, Guinness achieved its highest-ever volume and value shares and became the <a href="Market%20dominance">market leader</a> within the region. This was attributed in no small part to the positive reception of "noitulovE".

The piece begins with three patrons taking their first sip of Guinness in a London pub. To the accompaniment of <a href="Sammy%20Davis%2C%20Jr.">Sammy Davis, Jr.</a>'s rendition of "The Rhythm of Life" from the <a href="Sweet%20Charity%20%28film%29">1969 film version</a> of the 1966 <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> <a href="Musical%20theatre">musical</a> "<a href="Sweet%20Charity">Sweet Charity</a>", a reverse-motion sequence begins. The three men retreat from the bar and into the street, other patrons disappearing as they pass. As they move down the street, a reverse <a href="time-lapse">time-lapse</a>-style sequence transforms their clothes to match a rapidly changing urban scene, which progresses through modern-day London to the <a href="Edwardian%20period">Edwardian period</a>. <a href="Electric%20light">Electric light</a>s transform into <a href="gas%20lamp">gas lamp</a>s and buildings begin to disappear frame by frame. A short <a href="Cutaway%20%28filmmaking%29">cutaway sequence</a> shows the city regressing into the past, shrinking to a small <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Saxon</a> settlement before disappearing entirely. Returning to the main sequence, the three men's clothes and hairstyles are adjusted into <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> equivalents as they pass through thickening woodland. A close-up of one of the characters shows his features quickly transformed into those of a <a href="caveman">caveman</a>. The trio are then frozen in an <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a> <a href="glacier">glacier</a>.

The three re-emerge from the glacier as primitive hominids, their clothes ripped away to reveal <a href="loincloth">loincloth</a>s. They continue to walk backwards with a more <a href="simian">simian</a> gait, and soon turn into <a href="Common%20chimpanzee">chimpanzee</a>s. From there, they are transformed into a number of different species in quick succession, including <a href="flying%20squirrel">flying squirrel</a>s, furry mammals, <a href="aquatic%20mammal">aquatic mammal</a>s, <a href="fish">fish</a>, <a href="flightless%20bird">flightless bird</a>s, small <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s, and burrowing <a href="lizard">lizard</a>-like creatures. The environment around them changes rapidly as they travel, with cutaways showing millions of years of geological changes occurring in less than a few seconds. Finally, the three become <a href="mudskipper">mudskipper</a>s around a green-brown puddle. The action briefly moves forward again to show the middle character registering his disgust at the taste of the water with a "Pweugh!" sound. The commercial ends with a transition to a product shot of three pints of Guinness accompanied by the <a href="strapline">strapline</a> "Good things come to those who wait".

Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO won the account for Guinness in 1996 with a campaign built on their new strapline "<a href="Good%20things%20come%20to%20those%20who%20wait%20%28Guinness%29">Good things come to those who wait</a>". They produced several commercials using variations on the theme, including "<a href="Swimblack">Swimblack</a>", "<a href="Bet%20on%20Black">Bet on Black</a>", and the critically acclaimed "<a href="Surfer%20%28Guinness%29">Surfer</a>", voted the "Best Advert of All Time" by the British public in 2002. After the 2001 "<a href="Dreamer%20%28Guinness%29">Dreamer</a>" advertisements, Diageo, the corporate owners of Guinness, decided to pursue a more pan-European marketing strategy. The strapline proved difficult to translate, and was abandoned. Several new straplines were tried out over the next three years, including "Believe" ("<a href="Free%20%28Guinness%29">Free</a>" and "<a href="Tom%20Crean%20%28Guinness%29">Tom Crean</a>") and "A story of darkness and light" ("<a href="Moth%20%28Guinness%29">Moth</a>" and "<a href="Mustang%20%28Guinness%29">Mustang</a>").

The new marketing strategy did not prove particularly successful, and in 2004 Diageo returned to regional advertising. AMV BBDO were presented with the choice of coming up with either a new theme to appeal to the 18–35 British male demographic or a new angle on the tried and tested Good things... concept. A number of ideas were put forward, including "The Longest Wait". From this concept, "noitulovE" was quickly plotted out: the advert would show three individuals waiting 500,000,000 years before finally taking their first sip of Guinness, the timeline compressed into a 50-second clip. The decision to run the "Evolution sequence" in reverse was taken fairly early, as it was felt that it would better hold viewers' interest during a 60-second television spot.

The project had not yet been <a href="greenlight">greenlit</a> when the agency approached <a href="Daniel%20Kleinman">Daniel Kleinman</a>, known for his work on <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a> title sequences, with the intention of taking him on as a director. After looking over the concept pitch and a rough draft of the script, Kleinman's immediate impressions were that the idea was "fresh", "an opportunity to try out some new techniques", and that it would "put Guinness back on track, doing a big 'wow' idea".

Kleinman contacted a pair of Canadian <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> artists to begin the <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a>ing process. Storyboarding the commercial meant that the agency could determine how much of the £1.3M budget to allocate to each section, and provided them with visuals to use as part of the presentation to Diageo when pitching the various concepts for a decision on which to pursue. The effort paid off and approval was given to move ahead with production.

Production of the commercial took place over two months, with <a href="principal%20photography">principal photography</a> shot in <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>. Time-lapse photographs were taken of the country's <a href="mudpot">mudpot</a>s, volcanic terrain and frozen lakes using <a href="35%20mm%20film">35 mm film</a> cameras. The shooting was done in the early summer for the <a href="midnight%20sun">nearly continuous daylight</a> that the season afforded them. The next pieces of the commercial to be assembled were the <a href="live-action">live-action</a> segments, shot in a <a href="greenscreen">greenscreen</a> studio in London. Filming was done in three stages, with the three actors changing into different sets of <a href="prosthetic%20makeup">prosthetic makeup</a> at each stage. For the final section the actors spent a week practising the <a href="choreography">choreography</a> behind walking backwards with an appropriately simian gait. Wires were attached to the back of each actor, allowing them to lean forwards to give the impression that they were being "sucked back in time" when the final cut was put together. While filming the actor sequences, VFX supervisor William Bartlett filmed the aerial view of London from <a href="Tower%2042">Tower 42</a>'s Vertigo bar.

With computer-generated imagery looking to make up so much of the commercial, Kleinman attempted to use film of real elements wherever possible. To this end, 200 mudskippers were brought to the studio from South Africa for the final scene, arriving via <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>. An entire afternoon was set aside for filming the mudskipper sequence. The footage obtained formed the major part of the final cut of the scene, with only one or two post-production changes: the addition of <a href="Adipose%20fin">tail fins</a> and animation of the expression of disgust that closes the piece. <a href="Stop%20motion">Stop motion</a> footage of other real elements was taken, including a stage-by-stage <a href="blowtorch">blowtorch</a>ing of plants, used to show flora coming back to life in the reverse sequence, and shots of baking bread, used to model the geological changes to background rock formations. Additional real elements were to have been incorporated into the commercial, mostly from <a href="stock%20footage">stock footage</a> of several animal species, but only short segments of apes and lizards appeared in the final cut.

Post-production work was handled mostly by Framestore CFC, who had worked on previous Guinness campaigns "Surfer" and "Dreamer", and had worked with Daniel Kleinman on a number of outside projects, including several commercials and James Bond title sequences. The project was overseen by William Bartlett, known for his <a href="visual%20effects">visual effects</a> work on the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="television%20documentary">television documentary</a> "<a href="Walking%20with%20Dinosaurs">Walking with Dinosaurs</a>". The original schedule allowed for three and a half months in post-production, with airing of the commercial to follow almost immediately.

The 24-man animation team was split into two groups. Half were assigned to the creation of the 15 new CGI creatures populating "noitulovE" (in <a href="Maya%20%28software%29">Maya</a>), while the other half created the backgrounds (in <a href="Houdini%20%28software%29">Houdini</a>). <a href="Compositing">Compositing</a> work – combining the greenscreen shots with stock footage and CGI elements – was performed in <a href="Autodesk%20Media%20and%20Entertainment%23Flame">Flame</a> and <a href="Inferno%20%28Autodesk%29">Inferno</a>. As the final commercial was to be shown on cinema screens, the animators worked at a resolution higher than that afforded by the <a href="576i">576i</a> definition used by British <a href="PAL">PAL</a>-encoded television sets, to improve the appearance of the advert when projected.

Near the end of post-production, the <a href="Creative%20director">creative team</a> decided that the music chosen to accompany the advert, an <a href="electronic%20music">electronic</a> track by <a href="Groove%20Armada">Groove Armada</a>, was not working particularly well. <a href="Peter%20Raeburn">Peter Raeburn</a>, who had chosen the track used in "Surfer" (<a href="Leftfield">Leftfield</a>'s "Phat Planet"), was brought on as music director. Raeburn suggested three pieces, with "Rhythm of Life" ultimately presented to Guinness as an alternative and approved as a replacement.

"noitulovE" was originally to have begun its run in September 2005, but the airdate was pushed back several weeks as post-production took longer than anticipated. As had been the case with several earlier campaigns, the commercial was to air in several bursts, throughout 2005 and 2006. Spots were purchased in the commercial breaks of sports broadcasts, high-budget <a href="dramatic%20programming">television dramas</a> and shows whose primary audience overlapped with the campaign's target demographic of British males in the 24–35 age range. The first burst was commissioned to run from 3 October to 13 November 2005, during programming such as the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>, "<a href="Lost%20%28TV%20series%29">Lost</a>", "<a href="Vincent%20%28TV%20series%29">Vincent</a>", "<a href="Ant%20and%20Dec%27s%20Saturday%20Night%20Takeaway">Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway</a>" and <a href="terrestrial%20television">terrestrial television</a> screenings of "".

The second burst lasted through December. The focus moved to <a href="Satellite%20television">multichannel television</a>, with appearances in <a href="live%20television">live</a> televised <a href="Association%20football">football matches</a>, films, and popular programming such as "<a href="I%27m%20a%20Celebrity%2C%20Get%20Me%20Out%20of%20Here%21">I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!</a>". Two further bursts were commissioned for 2006, to run from 15 May to 9 June and 22 August to 8 October. Programmes selected for the May–June burst included "", "<a href="Big%20Brother%20%28UK%29">Big Brother</a>" and live football and cricket matches. The final series of spots ran during programming totalling 56 <a href="ratings%20point">ratings point</a>s per week (56% of British television viewers), with much of the budget assigned to multichannel television.

"noitulovE" was well received by critics within the advertising and television industries, and was predicted to win the 2006 <a href="Cannes%20Lions%20International%20Advertising%20Festival">Cannes Lions</a> Film Grand Prix, one of the advertising industry's highest awards. "<a href="Advertising%20Age">Advertising Age</a>" said of the piece: "A flawless DGI production to an irresistible piece of music propelling a brilliant, astonishingly witty new iteration of a longstanding, unique positioning. This isn't just great advertising; it is perfect advertising." Gastón Bigio, Executive Creative Director for <a href="Saatchi%20%26amp%3B%20Saatchi">Del Campo Nazca Saatchi & Saatchi</a> remarked on the campaign in the run-up to the festival, saying ""noitulovE" is, in my opinion, the best. [...] This execution is absolutely incredible, as is the production." The main competition for the prize was thought to be the Australian "" for <a href="Carlton%20%26amp%3B%20United%20Beverages">Carlton</a> draught beer, and the British "<a href="BRAVIA%23Launch%2C%20%27Balls%27">Balls</a>", for <a href="Sony">Sony</a>'s <a href="BRAVIA">BRAVIA</a> line of <a href="high%20definition%20television">high definition television</a> sets. After the three received Gold Lions in the Film category, they were shortlisted by the judges as contenders for the Grand Prix. Ultimately, the honour went to "noitulovE". After the decision, David Droga, president of the jury which determined the outcome, said "It's a very very strong ad. A lot of the jurors felt that it was not only a stand-alone, remarkable ad, but also a triumphant return for a fabulous campaign." The victory placed director Daniel Kleinman at Number 29 in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>'s" list of the Top 50 Newsmakers of 2006.

The 2006 edition of the "<a href="Gunn%20Report">Gunn Report</a>", an authoritative annual publication determining the advertising industry's most critically successful campaigns, revealed that "noitulovE" had received more awards that year than any other campaign worldwide. Among the awards were three <a href="Clio%20Awards">Clios</a>, two <a href="Shark%20Awards">Golden Sharks</a>, and the Special Jury Prize at the <a href="Imagina%20Awards">Imagina Awards</a>.

The ad was also a hit with the public. It has been credited by Guinness as being responsible for the substantial boost in sales experienced by the brand during the period in which it was broadcast. While revenues within the UK beer market declined by an average of −0.4% (−£19M), the year-on-year figures for Guinness showed an increase of 3.6% (+£13.3M). Between October 2005 and October 2006, Guinness achieved its highest ever volume (6.8%) and value (7.4%) shares, taking the position of <a href="Market%20dominance">market leader</a> from <a href="Stella%20Artois">Stella Artois</a>. Diageo attributed the growth in no small part to the positive reception garnered by "noitulovE".

As one of the most recognisable British television advertisements of 2006, "noitulovE" was one of two commercials (the other being Sony's "Balls") to feature in a £200M campaign launched by <a href="Digital%20UK">Digital UK</a> to raise awareness of the <a href="Digital%20terrestrial%20television%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Digital%20switchover">imminent switchover</a> within the UK from <a href="analogue%20television">analogue</a> to <a href="digital%20television">digital television</a>. New versions of the two adverts were produced, showing the first few seconds of the original spot before being interrupted by "Digit Al", an animated spokesman for the campaign.

In 2004, Guinness launched a retrospective television advertising campaign promoting <a href="Guinness%20Extra%20Cold">Guinness Extra Cold</a> stout, featuring new ten-second versions of commercials broadcast between 1984 and 2004. These included "<a href="Mars%20%28Guinness%29">Mars</a>" (with <a href="Rutger%20Hauer">Rutger Hauer</a> reprising his role as the "Pure Genius"), "<a href="Anticipation%20%28Guinness%29">Anticipation</a>", "<a href="Fish%20Bicycle">Fish Bicycle</a>", "Surfer", and "Bet on Black". "noitulovE" joined the campaign in 2006, and was the only piece to receive more than one new version. In the first of these, the patrons are encased only seconds after taking their first sip of Guinness in a glacier identical to the one which appeared halfway through the original spot. In the second, the sea through which the three fish bound backwards in the original spot is frozen while the trio are in mid-leap, leaving the characters skidding across the surface. In the final version, the <a href="wikt%3Aprimeval">primeval</a> pool at the end of the original spot freezes while the mudskippers are taking their drink, and the protagonists' tongues are left stuck in the ice.

When "noitulovE" was first proposed, it was the only pitch revisiting the Good things come to those who wait campaign, as, according to copywriter Ian Heartfield, both AMV BBDO and Diageo "didn't think [they] could do something good enough to warrant following on from Surfer and the like." However, following the success of "noitulovE", three additional commercials have been aired within the Good Things... campaign: "<a href="Fridge%20%28Guinness%29">Fridge</a>", "<a href="Hands%20%28Guinness%29">Hands</a>", and "<a href="Tipping%20Point%20%28Guinness%29">Tipping Point</a>" (Guinness' most expensive advertising campaign to date).

Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall

Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall is the sixth album (and first live album) by the <a href="Canadian-American">Canadian-American</a> singer-songwriter <a href="Rufus%20Wainwright">Rufus Wainwright</a>, released through <a href="Geffen%20Records">Geffen Records</a> in December 2007. The album consists of live recordings from his sold-out June 14–15, 2006, tribute concerts at <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a> to the American actress and singer <a href="Judy%20Garland">Judy Garland</a>. Backed by a 36-piece orchestra <a href="Conducting">conducted</a> by <a href="Stephen%20Oremus">Stephen Oremus</a>, Wainwright recreated Garland's April 23, 1961, concert, often considered "the greatest night in show business history". Garland's 1961 double album, "<a href="Judy%20at%20Carnegie%20Hall">Judy at Carnegie Hall</a>", a comeback performance with more than 25 American pop and jazz <a href="Standard%20%28music%29">standards</a>, was highly successful, initially spending 95 weeks on the <a href="Billboard%20charts">"Billboard" charts</a> and garnering five <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s (including <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Album%20of%20the%20Year">Album of the Year</a>, <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Recording%20Package">Best Album Cover</a>, <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Pop%20Vocal%20Performance">Best Solo Vocal Performance – Female</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Engineered%20Album%2C%20Non-Classical">Best Engineering Contribution – Popular Recording</a>).

For his album, Wainwright was also recognized by the Grammy Awards, earning a <a href="51st%20Grammy%20Awards">2009</a> nomination for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Traditional%20Pop%20Vocal%20Album">Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album</a>. While the tribute concerts were popular and the album was well received by critics, album sales were limited. "Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall" managed to chart in three nations, peaking at number 84 in <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, number 88 in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and number 171 on the United States' <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>.

Guests on the album include Wainwright's sister <a href="Martha%20Wainwright">Martha Wainwright</a> ("<a href="Stormy%20Weather%20%28song%29">Stormy Weather</a>"), his mother <a href="Kate%20McGarrigle">Kate McGarrigle</a> (piano, "<a href="Over%20the%20Rainbow">Over the Rainbow</a>"), along with one of Garland's daughters, <a href="Lorna%20Luft">Lorna Luft</a> ("<a href="After%20You%27ve%20Gone%20%28song%29">After You've Gone</a>"). Related to the album, the February 25, 2007 tribute concert filmed at the <a href="London%20Palladium">London Palladium</a> was released on DVD as "" on December 4, 2007.

According to <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a>, Wainwright "started listening to the Carnegie Hall album in the weeks and months after <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11</a>, craving some cheap showbiz cheer, but wound up discovering something deeper". The subsequent <a href="War%20on%20Terrorism">War on Terrorism</a> and <a href="invasion%20of%20Iraq">invasion of Iraq</a> caused Wainwright to become "traumatized and disillusioned with anything American". Claiming he was reminded of how great "the US used to be", Wainwright said the following of his appreciation for the album during that turbulent time in American history:

Wainwright observed while driving in his car that "it [would] be funny to redo this as a song cycle". Soon afterwards, he took the idea to New York-based theatrical producer <a href="Jared%20Geller">Jared Geller</a> (who would later co-produce the tribute concert with <a href="David%20Foster">David Foster</a>), hoping to turn a dream into a reality. Geller initially thought the idea was "insane", but he and Wainwright continued discussing options. Eventually, Geller agreed to assist with the production and the two found space in Wainwright's schedule to book Carnegie Hall a year in advance. Once the venue was booked, staging elements such as lighting, microphone location and amplification were discussed. <a href="Stephen%20Oremus">Stephen Oremus</a> signed on as the conductor of the 36-piece orchestra and <a href="Phil%20Ramone">Phil Ramone</a> took charge of the recording. Rehearsals began in April 2006, and while it would have been easier to practice in rehearsal rooms, large theaters such as the Lynch at the <a href="John%20Jay%20College%20of%20Criminal%20Justice">John Jay College of Criminal Justice</a> and the <a href="Museum%20of%20Jewish%20Heritage">Museum of Jewish Heritage</a> were utilized because "Rufus wanted a feel for performing this material on a stage". As a result of financial restrictions, full orchestra rehearsals took place only two days before the show and the day of each performance (practice with smaller groups of instruments began a few months before the concerts).

Due to popular demand, Wainwright's tribute was performed a total of six times. After tickets for the first show (June 14, 2006 at Carnegie Hall in New York City) sold out, a second show was added at the same venue for the following night (June 15). Increased demand resulted in three concerts in Europe: February 18, 2007 at the <a href="London%20Palladium">London Palladium</a> in London, February 20 at <a href="L%27Olympia">L'Olympia</a> in Paris and February 25 once again at the London Palladium. The final performance was on September 23, 2007 at the <a href="Hollywood%20Bowl">Hollywood Bowl</a> in Los Angeles, California.

Part of the success of the tribute concerts can be attributed to the amount of press attention received and the eagerness of other artists to participate in the event. As written by Gaby Wood of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", Wainwright "sparkled on the cover of "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28company%29">Time Out New York</a>"" and was "adored in the pages of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>"" following the Carnegie Hall shows. In fashion designer <a href="Marc%20Jacobs">Marc Jacobs</a>' menswear boutique in <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>, "virtually nothing was for sale except T-shirts advertising the show" (the bright orange shirts contained the text "RUFUS RUFUS RUFUS" and "world's greatest entertainer", mimicking promotional material used for Garland 45 years earlier). Film director <a href="Sam%20Mendes">Sam Mendes</a> planned to create a documentary about Wainwright's re-creation and the work leading up to it, though the project fell through. Dutch designers <a href="Viktor%20%26amp%3B%20Rolf">Viktor & Rolf</a> outfitted Wainwright and his family members for the concerts. To return the favor Wainwright wrote the song "Ode to Antidote" and allowed its use in the promotion of the design duo's <a href="perfume">cologne</a>, "Antidote". He also helped premiere the cologne at the after-party for his first Garland tribute and later performed "<a href="Over%20the%20Rainbow">Over the Rainbow</a>" at the premiere of their Spring 2007 fashion line. Wainwright wore clothing by <a href="Tom%20Ford">Tom Ford</a> at the Hollywood Bowl concert. To promote the album, Wainwright's website linked to an online store where fans could purchase merchandise, including several shirt designs, concert posters, <a href="Event%20program">programs</a> and other collectibles. Like the shirts sold by Marc Jacobs, much of the promotional material mimicked posters used for Garland's concert years before.

Celebrities attending the Carnegie Hall shows included <a href="Justin%20Bond">Justin Bond</a> ("Kiki" of <a href="Kiki%20and%20Herb">Kiki and Herb</a>), <a href="Patricia%20Field">Patricia Field</a>, <a href="Gina%20Gershon">Gina Gershon</a>, <a href="Joel%20Grey">Joel Grey</a>, Marc Jacobs, <a href="Michael%20Kors">Michael Kors</a>, <a href="Tony%20Kushner">Tony Kushner</a>, <a href="Ann%20Magnuson">Ann Magnuson</a>, <a href="Sarah%20Jessica%20Parker">Sarah Jessica Parker</a>, <a href="Kate%20Pierson">Kate Pierson</a>, <a href="Fred%20Schneider">Fred Schneider</a>, the <a href="Proenza%20Schouler">Proenza Schouler</a> boys, <a href="Chlo%C3%AB%20Sevigny">Chloë Sevigny</a>, <a href="John%20Waters%20%28filmmaker%29">John Waters</a> and Viktor & Rolf. Famous faces turned out at the concerts in Europe as well, including <a href="Julian%20Barratt">Julian Barratt</a>, <a href="Keane%20%28band%29">Keane</a> frontman <a href="Tom%20Chaplin">Tom Chaplin</a>, <a href="Julia%20Davis">Julia Davis</a>, <a href="David%20Furnish">David Furnish</a>, <a href="Mark%20Gatiss">Mark Gatiss</a>, <a href="Richard%20E.%20Grant">Richard E.

The songs on the album are identical to those performed on Garland's 1961 album, "<a href="Judy%20at%20Carnegie%20Hall">Judy at Carnegie Hall</a>", except Wainwright's album included "<a href="Get%20Happy%20%28song%29">Get Happy</a>" as a bonus track in the UK and on <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a> in the US. "Hail[ing] from a golden era dotted with trolley cars, Cadillacs, and glitzy jazz clubs", the set list included more than 25 American swing tunes, jazz and pop standards, including two <a href="Rodgers%20and%20Hart">Rodgers and Hart</a> classics ("<a href="This%20Can%27t%20Be%20Love%20%28song%29">This Can't Be Love</a>", "<a href="You%27re%20Nearer">You're Nearer</a>"), three from brothers <a href="George%20Gershwin">George</a> and <a href="Ira%20Gershwin">Ira Gershwin</a> ("<a href="Who%20Cares%3F%20%28Gershwin%20song%29">Who Cares? (As Long as You Care for Me)</a>", "<a href="How%20Long%20Has%20This%20Been%20Going%20On%3F">How Long Has This Been Going On?</a>" and "<a href="A%20Foggy%20Day">A Foggy Day</a>"), two from duo <a href="Howard%20Dietz">Howard Dietz</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Schwartz">Arthur Schwartz</a> ("<a href="Alone%20Together%20%281932%20song%29">Alone Together</a>", "<a href="That%27s%20Entertainment%21%20%28song%29">That's Entertainment!</a>"), <a href="Harold%20Arlen">Harold Arlen</a>, <a href="Irving%20Berlin">Irving Berlin</a>, <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a> and more. Wainwright performed the songs nearly identically to Garland, even "flubb[ing]" the lyrics purposely on "<a href="You%20Go%20to%20My%20Head">You Go to My Head</a>" to mimic the mistake made by Garland years before.

Stephen Oremus, musical director for the tribute concerts, faced the task of resurrecting <a href="Mort%20Lindsey">Mort Lindsey</a>'s original arrangements written for a 36-piece orchestra. Although it is no longer common to have orchestras so large (Oremus acknowledged that even "<a href="Wicked%20%28musical%29">Wicked</a>" on Broadway only had 22 pieces), Wainwright and Oremus insisted the full 36-piece ensemble should be utilized to create "as exact a replica as [they could] muster". Some of the arrangements had to be reconstructed, since the music was not available, and most of the songs had to be transposed, since Wainwright was performing them in a different key.

Garland was a gay icon, even before Wainwright was born. Gay identification with Garland was being discussed in the mainstream as early as 1967. <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time" magazine</a>, in reviewing Garland's 1967 <a href="Palace%20Theatre%2C%20New%20York">Palace Theatre</a> engagement, disparagingly noted that a "disproportionate part of her nightly claque seems to be homosexual". It goes on to say that "[t]he boys in the tight trousers" would "roll their eyes, tear at their hair and practically levitate from their seats" during Garland's performances. "Time" then attempted to explain Garland's appeal to the homosexual, consulting psychiatrists who opined that "the attraction [to Garland] might be made considerably stronger by the fact that she has survived so many problems; homosexuals identify with that kind of hysteria" and that "Judy was beaten up by life, embattled, and ultimately had to become more masculine. She has the power that homosexuals would like to have, and they attempt to attain it by idolizing her."

Garland always had a large base of fans in the <a href="gay%20community">gay community</a>, which includes Wainwright, who identifies as gay and came out to his parents at the age of 14. A connection is frequently drawn between the timing of Garland's death and funeral, in June 1969, and the <a href="Stonewall%20riots">Stonewall riots</a>, the flashpoint of the modern <a href="Gay%20Liberation">Gay Liberation</a> movement. Coincidental or not, the proximity of Garland's death to Stonewall has become a part of <a href="LGBT%20history">LGBT history</a> and lore. Wainwright, having been called the "first post-liberation era gay pop star", was obsessed with "<a href="The%20Wizard%20of%20Oz%20%281939%20film%29">The Wizard of Oz</a>" (1939) as a child and would dress in his mother's gown, "pretend[ing] to be either the <a href="Wicked%20Witch%20of%20the%20West">Wicked Witch</a> – melting for hours on end – or the <a href="Glinda">Good Witch</a>, depending on his mood". Wainwright also claims his mother (Canadian <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a>ian <a href="Kate%20McGarrigle">Kate McGarrigle</a>) forced him to perform "<a href="Over%20the%20Rainbow">Over the Rainbow</a>" for guests while growing up, a song he often included in his concert repertoire as an adult.
Wainwright never intended to impersonate Garland or create a <a href="Drag%20%28clothing%29">drag</a> act, but rather to inhabit the songs and expose them to a new generation. However, there was a certain <a href="Camp%20%28style%29">camp</a> style present, of which Wainwright stated the following: "I think that any gay person in the world would be seduced at one point by a certain kind of camp. For certain people it's kind of a saving grace." Regarding the tribute concerts and homosexuality, Wainwright admitted:

While Wainwright did not dress in drag at any of the tribute shows in New York or Europe, he did return to the stage in "Judy drag" for an encore at the Hollywood Bowl performance, "bedecked in a double-breasted <a href="Black%20tie">tuxedo jacket</a> sans pants, black <a href="stocking">stocking</a>s, <a href="high-heeled%20footwear">high heels</a>, earrings, <a href="lipstick">lipstick</a> and a tilted <a href="fedora">fedora</a>". He also took "<a href="Get%20Happy%20%28song%29">Get Happy</a>" from the set and performed the tune "<a href="Summer%20Stock">Summer Stock</a>"-style during part of his "<a href="Release%20the%20Stars">Release the Stars</a>" tour to mimic the look of Garland during her performance (pictured on right).

Overall, reception of the album was positive. <a href="Stephen%20Holden">Stephen Holden</a> of "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" called Wainwright's tribute "a fabulous stunt in which a gay singer channeled the spirit of the ultimate gay icon", and declared the album was "as good an introduction to the <a href="Great%20American%20Songbook">great American songbook</a> as any". Pitchfork Media's Stephen Troussé wrote that Wainwright "elegantly outdoes [Garland] on a couple of the ballads" and also compliments guest performer Martha Wainwright, "who turns in a stunning, showstopping 'Stormy Weather' in an appropriately brazen bid to steal the show". In his review for "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> stated it was "a relief to hear him essay the show tunes and <a href="Tin%20Pan%20Alley">Tin Pan Alley</a> chestnuts of this tribute album". Furthermore, he wrote that the songs "expand [Wainwright's] melodic compass", allowing him to "bring something new to them too – namely, sexuality in the sensuality as opposed to gender-preference sense". Dave Hughes of "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>" had positive comments about the album: "That Wainwright has the temerity to cover such a bona fide classic—and the chops to pull it off without breaking a limb or his brain—speaks both to his ambition and to his prodigious abilities."

The album did receive some criticism. After noting Garland's lifelong attempt to master pitch and articulation, Christgau claimed Wainwright's habit of "slid[ing] past notes and draw[ing] out the final syllables of lines are signatures indistinguishable from tics". "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"'s Chris Willman wrote that Wainwright's "delicate upper range is nicely attuned to some of the ballads, but anything that requires belting is pretty much a loss". Mark Edwards of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" called Wainwright's performance an acquired taste, stating his "trademark delivery" is "lazy and somewhat slurred". Dave Hughes' review pointed out Wainwright's "problem with the brassy high notes in an otherwise energetic take on 'That's Entertainment'", but admits it would be unfair to hold this against him since Garland's live performance was not perfect either. Hughes appropriately notes, "Ain't nobody perfect".

Despite the popularity of Wainwright's tribute concerts, an abundance of press regarding the album, and generally favorable critical reception, album sales were limited. However, "Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall" reached a peak position of number 84 in <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, number 88 in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and number 171 on the United States' <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. The album was nominated for a <a href="51st%20Grammy%20Awards">2009</a> <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Traditional%20Pop%20Vocal%20Album">Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album</a>, but lost to <a href="Natalie%20Cole">Natalie Cole</a>'s "<a href="Still%20Unforgettable">Still Unforgettable</a>". In 2012, <a href="AfterEllen.com%20and%20AfterElton.com">AfterElton.com</a> included the album on its list of "10 Great Pop Culture Moments from Famous Canadians".

Tales of Wonder (magazine)

Tales of Wonder is a British <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a> published from 1937 to 1942, with Walter Gillings as editor. It was published by The World's Work, a subsidiary of <a href="Heinemann%20%28publisher%29">William Heinemann</a>, as part of a series of genre titles that included "Tales of Mystery and Detection" and " Tales of the Uncanny". Gillings was able to attract some good material, despite the low payment rates he was able to offer; he also included many reprints from U.S. science fiction magazines. The magazine was apparently more successful than the other genre titles issued by The World's Work, since "Tales of Wonder" was the only one to publish more than a single issue.

<a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> made his first professional sale to "Tales of Wonder," with two science articles. Gillings also published <a href="William%20F.%20Temple">William F. Temple</a>'s first story, some early material by <a href="John%20Wyndham">John Wyndham</a>, and "The Prr-r-eet" by <a href="Eric%20Frank%20Russell">Eric Frank Russell</a>. American writers who appeared in the magazine included <a href="Murray%20Leinster">Murray Leinster</a> and <a href="Jack%20Williamson">Jack Williamson</a>; these were both reprints, but some new material from the U.S. did appear, including <a href="Lloyd%20A.%20Eshbach">Lloyd A. Eshbach</a>'s "Out of the Past", and <a href="S.P.%20Meek">S.P. Meek</a>'s "The Mentality Machine". With the advent of World War II, paper shortages and Gillings' call up into the army made it increasingly difficult to continue, and the sixteenth issue, dated Spring 1942, was the last. "Tales of Wonder" was not the first British science fiction magazine, but it was the first one aimed at an adult market, and its success made it apparent that a science fiction magazine could survive in the UK.

The first US science fiction (sf) magazine, "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", was imported into the UK from its launch in 1926, and other magazines from the U.S. market were also available from an early date. No British sf magazine appeared until 1934, when <a href="Pearson%20PLC">Pearson's</a> launched "<a href="Scoops%20%28magazine%29">Scoops</a>", a weekly in tabloid format aimed at the juvenile market. Soon <a href="Haydn%20Dimmock">Haydn Dimmock</a>, "Scoops"<nowiki>' editor, began to receive more sophisticated stories, targeted at an adult audience; he tried to change the magazine's focus to include more mature fiction, but within twenty issues falling sales led Pearson's to cancel the magazine. The failure of </nowiki>"Scoops" gave British publishers the impression that Britain could not support a science fiction publication.

Despite this failure, only a year later, <a href="George%20Newnes%2C%20Ltd">George Newnes, Ltd</a>., the publisher of <a href="The%20Strand%20Magazine">"The Strand"</a> magazine, decided to launch a group of four genre pulp magazines, and to include a science fiction title. The editor, T. Stanhope Sprigg, had help from Walter Gillings, a British science fiction reader who had been active in fan circles since the early 1930s, in searching for good submissions, but the project was placed on hold after fifteen months. Gillings next approached The World's Work, a subsidiary of <a href="Heinemann%20%28publisher%29">William Heinemann</a>, who were already publishing titles such as "Tales of Mystery and Detection" and "Tales of the Uncanny", as part of their Master Thriller series. Gillings had heard that The World's Work were planning a science fiction magazine; as it turned out this was not the case, but Gillings was quickly able to persuade them to add science fiction to their list. He was asked to prepare a single issue of 80,000 words to test the market. The World's Work reprinted a good deal of American fiction and since they were only paying for reprint rights their rates were lower than was usual for new fiction. Gillings was given a budget of <a href="%C2%A3sd">10/6</a> (ten shillings and sixpence) per thousand words: the low rate discouraged those writers who could sell to the better-paying American magazines. Newer writers were glad of the chance to develop a British market for their work, though most American writers were unimpressed.

The first issue of "Tales of Wonder" appeared in June 1937. Sales were good enough for The World's Work to continue publication, and from Spring 1938 the magazine appeared on a quarterly schedule, with occasional omissions. None of the other titles in the Master Thriller series ever turned into a separate magazine, so it was evidently selling well. The success of "Tales of Wonder" led Newnes to believe that they had been wrong to turn down Gillings, and in 1938 they launched <a href="Fantasy%20%281938%20magazine%29">"Fantasy"</a> as a competitor.

The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 did not immediately lead to paper shortages, but paper began to be rationed in April 1940, and the page count, which had already dropped from 128 to 96, fell to 72 by 1941. Gillings was called up for military service, and for a while he was able to edit the magazine from his army camp, but the magazine eventually ceased publication with the Spring 1942 issue.

American science fiction magazines had by the mid-1930s begun to publish some more sophisticated stories than the straightforward adventure fiction that was a staple of the earliest years of the genre. Gillings decided that many British science fiction readers would not be familiar with most of the developments in American sf, and so he did not make a point of seeking innovative and original material. The first issue contained "The Perfect Creature", an early story by <a href="John%20Wyndham">John Wyndham</a>, under the name "John Beynon", as well as "The Prr-r-eet", by <a href="Eric%20Frank%20Russell">Eric Frank Russell</a>. The second issue included Wyndham's novel "<a href="Sleepers%20of%20Mars">Sleepers of Mars</a>", and <a href="William%20F.%20Temple">William F. Temple</a>'s "Lunar Lilliput", which was Temple's first science fiction sale. "Stenographer's Hands", a story by <a href="David%20H.%20Keller">David H. Keller</a>, also appeared in the second issue, reprinted from a US magazine; Gillings claimed that this was to introduce British science fiction readers to American developments in sf, but in fact it was because he was having trouble obtaining good quality material from British writers.

Other reprints acquired by Gillings included <a href="Murray%20Leinster">Murray Leinster</a>'s "The Mad Planet" and its sequel, "The Red Dust", and two stories by <a href="Jack%20Williamson">Jack Williamson</a>: his first sale, "The Metal Man", along with "The Moon Era"; these were both by American writers though Gillings tried to reprint stories from the US markets by British writers when he could. Reprints were not restricted to American and British authors, or the US pulp market: Gillings also ran "The Planet Wrecker" by R. Coutts Armour, an Australian writer who used the pseudonym "Coutts Brisbane"; the story had originally appeared in "<a href="The%20Red%20Magazine">The Red Magazine</a>" in 1914. Some new stories from American writers appeared, including <a href="Lloyd%20A.%20Eshbach">Lloyd A. Eshbach</a>'s "Out of the Past", and <a href="S.P.%20Meek">S.P. Meek</a>'s "The Mentality Machine". Gillings ran competitions for reader essays, one of which was won by <a href="Ken%20Bulmer">Ken Bulmer</a>, later a well-known British science fiction writer, and he encouraged fans to contribute, with articles and fillers. The most significant writer introduced by Gillings was undoubtedly <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>, whose first sales were to Gillings, for the science articles "Man's Empire of Tomorrow" and "We Can Rocket to the Moon—Now!", which were published in the Winter 1938 and Summer 1939 issues.

Science fiction historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a> regards "Tales of Wonder" as "a lively, entertaining and enjoyable magazine". Its success demonstrated that there was a market in Britain for a magazine aimed at adult science fiction readers, despite the earlier failure of "Scoops", and in 1938 George Newnes, Ltd. went ahead with their much-delayed plans for an sf magazine, <a href="Fantasy%20%281938%20magazine%29">"Fantasy"</a>, having seen the success of "Tales of Wonder".

"Tales of Wonder" was published in <a href="Pulp%20magazine">pulp</a> format for all 16 issues. It began at 128 pages; this was cut to 96 pages with the Winter 1939 issue; then to 80 pages with the Autumn 1940 issue; and finally to 72 pages for the last three issues. It was edited throughout by Walter Gillings, and was priced at <a href="%C2%A3sd">1/-</a>. There was no volume numbering; each issue was numbered consecutively.

Keith Johnson (cricket administrator)

Keith Ormond Edley Johnson, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">MBE</a> (28 December 1894 – 19 October 1972), was an Australian <a href="cricket">cricket</a> administrator. He was the manager of the <a href="Australian%20Services%20cricket%20team">Australian Services cricket team</a> in England, India and Australia immediately after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and of the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">Australian team that toured England in 1948</a>. The 1948 Australian cricket team earned the <a href="sobriquet">sobriquet</a> "The Invincibles" by being the first side to complete a tour of England without losing a single match.

Johnson joined the <a href="Cricket%20Australia">Australian Board of Control for International Cricket</a> in 1935 as a delegate for <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and served in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, performing <a href="public%20relations">public relations</a> work in <a href="London">London</a>. With the <a href="VE%20Day">allied victory in Europe</a>, <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> resumed and Johnson was appointed to manage the Australian Services team, which played England in a series of celebratory matches known as the <a href="Victory%20Tests">Victory Tests</a> to usher in the post-war era. The series was highly successful, with unprecedented crowds raising large amounts for war charities. As a result, further matches were scheduled and Johnson's men toured <a href="British%20India">British India</a> and Australia before being demobilised. Johnson's administration was regarded as a major factor in the success of the tour.

In 1948, Johnson managed the Australian tour of England, which again brought record profits and attendances, in spite of Australia's overwhelming dominance. Johnson's management of the tour—which generated large amounts of media attention—was again lauded. However, in 1951–52, the Australian Board of Control excluded <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a> from the team for "reasons other than cricket". Barnes took the matter to court, and in the ensuing trial, his lawyer embarrassed Johnson, who contradicted himself several times under cross-examination. Following the trial, Johnson resigned from the board and took no further part in cricket administration.

Johnson was born on 28 December 1894 in the inner-<a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> suburb of <a href="Paddington%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Paddington</a>. He later moved to the <a href="Sydney%20North%20Shore">north shore</a> suburb of <a href="Mosman%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Mosman</a>, where he worked as a mechanic before serving briefly in the 3rd Field Company Army Engineers. On 8 October 1916, in the middle of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Johnson enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">First Australian Imperial Force</a> as a gunner in the 5th Field Artillery Brigade. His unit left Sydney on 10 February 1917 and headed for Europe. He returned to Australia on 1 July 1919.

After the end of World War I, Johnson married his wife Margaret. Johnson joined the <a href="Cricket%20Australia">Australian Board of Control for International Cricket</a> in 1935 as a delegate for the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Cricket%20Association">New South Wales Cricket Association</a>, having been affiliated with the <a href="Mosman%20Cricket%20Club">Mosman Cricket Club</a> in <a href="Sydney%20Grade%20Cricket">Sydney Grade Cricket</a>. He had attended the <a href="annual%20general%20meeting">annual general meeting</a> in September 1934 as a proxy for <a href="Billy%20Bull">Billy Bull</a>, who was travelling back to Australia with the national team, which had been touring England.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Johnson served in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). He enlisted in the RAAF on 13 April 1942 in Sydney. Johnson rose to the rank of <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> and was deployed to London, where he did <a href="public%20relations">public relations</a> work at the RAAF's overseas headquarters. In June 1945, he was appointed as manager of the <a href="Australian%20Services%20cricket%20team">Australian Services cricket team</a> on its tour of <a href="United%20Kingdom">Britain</a> for the <a href="Victory%20Tests">Victory Tests</a>, <a href="India">India</a> and Australia from mid-1945 to early-1946. Officially a military unit, the team's <a href="commanding%20officer">commanding officer</a> was <a href="Squadron%20leader">Squadron leader</a> <a href="Stan%20Sismey">Stan Sismey</a> of the RAAF, although the on-field captain was <a href="Warrant%20officer">Warrant officer</a> <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a> of the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a>.

<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a> praised Johnson's organisational work in arranging the services' tour: "A stranger to this country, he found the programme in only skeleton form; and that the tour proved such a success from every point of view was due to his hard work and courtesy." The almanack reprinted Johnson's message of thanks to the English cricket community in full before the team sailed to India.

The Victory Tests started in May 1945 between the Australian Services and England in celebration of <a href="VE%20Day">the allied victory in Europe</a>. In previous seasons, the English cricket administrator and former captain <a href="Pelham%20Warner">Pelham Warner</a> had organised matches between the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force%20cricket%20team">RAAF</a> and various English military teams as an expression of defiance against <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi</a> air raids, and the Victory Tests were a continuation of this, although the matches were only three days long and did not have <a href="Test%20cricket">Test status</a>.

In the First Victory Test, the Australian Servicemen scraped home by six wickets with only two balls and minutes to spare. The last pre-war series between England and Australia in 1938 had been an attritional and hard-nosed contest, but in the afterglow of the war victory, the cricketers played flamboyantly with abandon in front of packed crowds. The attractive, attacking style of play was widely praised by commentators and the match raised £1,935 for war relief charities. England then levelled the series by winning the Second Victory Test at <a href="Bramall%20Lane">Bramall Lane</a>, <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> with a hard-fought battle, by 41 runs. Australia won the Third Victory Test by four wickets late on the final day and drew the Fourth Victory Test at Lord's. That would have been the end of the series, but because of the record attendance of 93,000 at Lord's, another match was appended. England drew the series by winning the Fifth Victory Test in front of another capacity crowd. The Victory Tests were regarded as an outstanding success, with a total attendance of 367,000 and bright and attacking play.

Due to the unexpectedly strong success of the Victory Tests, the <a href="government%20of%20Australia">government of Australia</a>, acting on the impetus of Foreign Minister <a href="H.V.%20Evatt">H.V. "Doc" Evatt</a>, ordered the Australian Services to delay their demobilisation. With the team raising so much money for war charities, the government directed them to travel home via <a href="British%20India">India</a> and <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Ceylon</a> to play further matches, in order to raise more funds for the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a>.

Johnson found himself in a difficult situation during the Indian leg of the tour. The team—mostly made up of RAAF personnel—had been ill with food poisoning and dysentery, and travelled across the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> by long train journeys. The airmen wanted to travel by air, and threatened to abandon the tour or replace Hassett, an AIF member, with either <a href="Keith%20Carmody">Keith Carmody</a> or <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a>, who were RAAF fighter pilots. However, the standoff was ended when Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane to transport the team. On the playing arena, it was not a happy tour for Johnson and his men. They lost the three-match series against India 1–0 and recorded only one victory, against <a href="South%20Zone%20cricket%20team">South Zone</a>, in their nine matches.

Johnson's team arrived in Australia towards the end of 1945, but the armed services and Australian Board of Control ordered them to play another series against the various Australian states. Johnson had sought fixtures for his team in Australia, but this was before the Evatt had added the matches in the subcontinent. He implored the administrators to recognise that the players were already overworked, but was ignored. The Services performed poorly; after playing out consecutive draws against <a href="Western%20Warriors">Western Australia</a> and <a href="Southern%20Redbacks">South Australia</a>, they were crushed by an innings by both <a href="Victorian%20Bushrangers">Victoria</a> and <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a>, before drawing against <a href="Queensland%20Bulls">Queensland</a> and <a href="Tasmanian%20Tigers">Tasmania</a>, the smallest state in the country.

Johnson was involved in another administrative dispute during the Australian leg of the campaign. <a href="Cec%20Pepper">Cec Pepper</a>—whom teammates Miller and <a href="Dick%20Whitington">Dick Whitington</a> regarded as one of the best <a href="all%20rounder">all rounder</a>s in the world and a certainty for Australian Test selection—appealed for <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">leg before wicket</a> against Australian captain <a href="Don%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a> in the match against South Australia. The appeal was turned down and Pepper complained to the umpire <a href="John%20Scott%20%28Australian%20cricketer%2C%20born%201888%29">Jack Scott</a>, prompting Bradman—who was also a member of the Australian Board of Control and the board of the <a href="South%20Australian%20Cricket%20Association">South Australian Cricket Association</a>—to ask Scott whether Pepper's behaviour was acceptable. As he was an employee of the SACA, Scott answered to Bradman, and he lodged a complaint about Pepper to the Australian Board of Control. Pepper was never selected for Australia. Cricket historian <a href="Gideon%20Haigh">Gideon Haigh</a> said that "Johnson was clearly upset by the affair, and also by the failure of the [national] selection panel [Bradman among them] ... to send Pepper, second only to Miller as a cricketer in the Services XI, to <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20New%20Zealand%20in%201945-46">New Zealand</a>". Johnson tried to intercede on Pepper's behalf, to no avail, although the other board members claimed that no pressure had been placed on the selectors to exclude Pepper.

The home leg of the tour was a poor end to the long and taxing Australian Services campaign. As the military men played poorly in Australia, the national selectors concluded that their achievements against England must have been against weak opposition, and only Hassett and Miller were selected for the Australian tour of New Zealand. Johnson then helped to arrange England's first post-war tour of Australia, in 1946–47.

Johnson was a late appointment as manager for the 1948 tour of England, taking over from his New South Wales colleague Bill Jeanes, who was secretary of the Australian Board of Control and had managed the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201938">previous Australian tour of England in 1938</a>. Jeanes had become increasingly unpopular among the players because of an approach that Haigh called "increasingly officious and liverish".

Led by Bradman—widely regarded as the greatest batsman in history—the Australians went through their 34 matches without defeat, earning the sobriquet "The Invincibles". They won 25 of their matches, 17 of these by an innings, and crushed England 4–0 in the five Tests, winning most games heavily.

Despite the Australians' domination of the local teams, the English public showed unprecedented levels of interest in the cricket. Record gate takings were registered at most venues, even when rain affected the matches, and the record attendance for a Test match in England was broken twice, in the <a href="Second%20Test%2C%201948%20Ashes%20series">Second Test</a> at Lord's and the <a href="Fourth%20Test%2C%201948%20Ashes%20series">Fourth Test</a> at <a href="Headingley%20Stadium">Headingley</a>. The 158,000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain a record for a Test on English soil. As a result, Australia made £82,671 from the tour, resulting in a profit of £54,172. The popularity of the team meant that they were inundated with invitations for social appointments with government officials and members of the royal family, and they had to juggle a plethora of off-field engagements, with 103 days of scheduled cricket in the space of 144 days. As a result, Johnson was flooded with phone calls and letters, which he had to attend to by himself, as he was the only administrator among the touring party. Bradman later said he was worried that Johnson's tireless work would cause health problems because he "worked like a slave day and night" and that "it was the tribute to a bulldog determination to see the job through". The journalist <a href="Andy%20Flanagan">Andy Flanagan</a> said that Johnson was "'on the ball' every minute of the waking day, and it would be safe to say half the night too."

Johnson was again praised by Wisden in its report on the 1948 tour. "Indebtedness for the smooth running of the tour and general harmony of the team was due largely to the manager, Mr Keith Johnson, hard-working and always genial," it said. "Paying tribute to the loyalty of the players, Mr Johnson said there had not been a discordant note in the party throughout the tour." Flanagan labelled Johnson as "conscientious, reserved, dignified, extraordinarily industrious and scrupulously trustworthy". He went on to say that "No organization, no body corporate, no individual could ever hope to have a more loyal, a more devoted, or a more conscientious officer...Although to the world in general all the praise and glory for the unequalled triumph the tour proved to be goes to Sir Donald Bradman, only those who travelled with the team will ever have a proper conception of the part played in that triumph by Keith Johnson." Bradman said that Johnson "created friends and goodwill everywhere both for himself and the team, and no side could have wished for a better Manager". On the journey back to Australia, the players presented Johnson with a silver Georgian salver, with their signatures engraved on the memento.

In a "farewell message" to England quoted in Wisden, Johnson said that the "most lasting memory" would be the team's visit to <a href="Balmoral%20Castle">Balmoral Castle</a>. Johnson said "We felt we were going into an Englishman's home and into his family heart". "It was difficult to believe that we were being entertained by Royalty. My personal wish would be for everybody in the Empire to spend an hour or so with the King and Queen. It would do them a tremendous amount of good."

Johnson's claim of tour harmony and player loyalty in 1948 was thrown into a different light by events less than four years later. The opening batsman <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a>—a core member of the 1948 team—was seeking a return to Test cricket. Barnes was known for being a somewhat eccentric self-promoter. During the 1948 tour, Barnes organised a multitude of business deals while not playing cricket, and avoided paying customs <a href="Duty%20%28economics%29">duties</a> on the enormous amount of goods he acquired in Britain by disembarking at Melbourne instead of Sydney.

Barnes then made himself unavailable for first-class cricket, preferring to pursue business interests instead, and ridiculed the fee paid for the 1949–50 tour of South Africa. He wrote a column for Sydney's "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph%20%28Sydney%29">The Daily Telegraph</a>", titled "Like It or Lump It", in which he often lampooned the administration of the game.

However, in 1951–52, Barnes made a return to cricket, and sought selection in the national team to play the West Indies during the 1951–52 Australian season. Australia had been unable to find a reliable opener to accompany Barnes's former partner <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a>. Australia's batsmen struggled in the first two Tests, and before the Third Test, Barnes scored 107 against Victoria, putting on 210 in partnership with Morris for New South Wales. "<a href="The%20Sporting%20Globe">The Sporting Globe</a>" in Melbourne had presciently predicted that the board would object if the selectors chose Barnes.

Barnes was duly selected for the Third Test by a panel of three, chaired by his former captain Bradman, but the choice was vetoed by the Australian Board of Control "for reasons outside of cricket". Bradman was one of four board members to support Barnes's selection, while 10 objected, including Johnson.

The matches took place and Barnes did not play. He was unable to find out why he had been excluded and was resigned to making an appearance before the board at its next meeting in September 1952 to ask for an explanation.

In the meantime, the team was not announced at the scheduled time due to the delay caused by the veto. Journalists deduced the story and Barnes became a "<a href="cause%20c%C3%A9l%C3%A8bre">cause célèbre</a>" for many weeks, missing all the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship regarding Barnes's behaviour was deposited in the NSWCA library. It accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by cupping his hands over his eyes and showing dissent by implying that they were blind.

Barnes continued to score heavily, and during one match, he crossed paths with Johnson, who reportedly apologised to him for the exclusion from the team. However, Johnson advised Barnes to "keep quiet and say nothing" and added that "You will come out of it all right, you will be a certainty for the 1953 trip [to England]".

On 24 April 1952, a letter appeared in Sydney's "Daily Mirror" from Jacob Raith, a baker from Stanmore in Sydney, in response to a letter from Barnes's friend Stacy Atkin, which condemned the board for vetoing Barnes's selection. Raith's letter said that the board must have had good reason to exclude Barnes.

The Board of Control had previously granted itself the power to exclude a player from the national team "on grounds other than cricket ability" following the poor behaviour of some members of the 1912 team that toured England. Instead, Barnes sued Raith for libel and engaged a top Sydney lawyer, <a href="Jack%20Shand">Jack Shand</a>—described by Haigh as "the foremost trial lawyer of his day"— to represent him, with the aim of uncovering the reasons for his exclusion. Bradman felt that Raith's letter was a premeditated set-up to give Barnes a pretext to instigate a trial. The libel trial, held in August 1952, was a sensation, and Johnson, still a member of the board, was the central figure. According to Haigh, "it was effectively the Board, not Raith, in the dock".

It emerged very quickly during the trial that Raith had no particular knowledge of the workings of the board. A series of administrators came forward to say that Barnes had reportedly misbehaved on the 1948 tour, even though Johnson's official report as manager had made no mention of any disharmony. <a href="Aubrey%20Oxlade">Aubrey Oxlade</a>, the chairman of the board and one of the four board members who voted to ratify Barnes's selection, said that the batsman's indiscretions were "childish things" and "not serious at all". Later, <a href="Frank%20Cush">Frank Cush</a>, another board member who had supported Barnes's inclusion, replied "none at all" when asked if there were any legitimate reasons for excluding Barnes. Selector <a href="Chappie%20Dwyer">Chappie Dwyer</a> said "I have a very high opinion of him as a cricketer ... and I have no objection to him as a man".

Johnson was called as a witness, and, under questioning from Shand, a different story came out. Johnson agreed that his written report of the 1948 tour had said that the team had behaved "in a manner befitting worthy representatives of Australia" and that "on and off the field their conduct was exemplary". However, in a verbal report, Johnson said he had drawn the board's attention to various misdemeanours by Barnes that, in his opinion, were sufficiently serious to warrant the player's exclusion from future Australian Test sides. Johnson said that Barnes had shown a "general reluctance for anything savouring of authority". The misdeeds included taking pictures as the Australian team was presented to the royal family on the playing arena during the Test match at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>, asking permission to travel alone in England (Barnes' family was living in Scotland at the time), and "abducting" <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">twelfth man</a> <a href="Ernie%20Toshack">Ernie Toshack</a> to play tennis during the match at Northampton on a court "300 yards from the pavilion". Under cross-examination, Johnson said that Barnes's taking pictures of the royal family at Lord's was the most serious of these misdemeanours. He admitted he had not known that Barnes had received permission from the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">MCC</a> and the royal family's protocol chief to take the photos. Shand also established that Barnes had then shown the films to raise money for various charities. He further showed that Barnes had not agitated when reminded of the policy against players meeting with family members on tour. However, Johnson believed that the cumulative effect of the misdeeds "warranted omission from the team" and he saw no problem in the fact that his verbal advice to the board recommending Barnes' exclusion was at odds with the written report on the 1948 tour. Under pressure from Shand, Johnson admitted that "I don't always write what I think". According to Haigh, "Shand effortlessly twisted him [Johnson] inside out".


Shand had nearly reduced Johnson to tears, having previously caused a senior police officer to cry during the hearing of a royal commission the year before. A colleague of Shand's recalled his "capacity of insinuation in tone which could annoy and bring a witness into antagonism". Shand then asked Johnson about a hypothetical case of Barnes being selected in the future. Johnson evaded the matter of whether he would select the player until Shand asked him to assume that "Barnes is in the best possible form and he is the best cricketer in Australia", to which Johnson replied that he would not.

On the trial's second day, soon after Barnes had taken to the witness stand, Raith's counsel withdrew his client's defence. It had been his task, he said, to prove a plea that the allegation in Raith's letter was true, and that Barnes had not been excluded capriciously. Counsel remarked that "seldom in the history of libel actions has such a plea failed so completely and utterly." The case ended at that point; Barnes was vindicated, and Raith's counsel issued him with a public apology. According to fellow administrator <a href="Alan%20Barnes%20%28cricket%20administrator%29">Alan Barnes</a>, Johnson was a "wide-open type of bloke" who was vulnerable to manoeuvring. Colleagues advised Johnson to hire a lawyer before the case started, but he refused, saying that the libel case was merely a sporting matter, not a legal one.

After the libel trial, Johnson resigned from the board on 9 February 1953, and played no further part in cricket administration in Australia. He also resigned from the NSWCA and withdrew his candidature for the manager's position for the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201953">1953 tour of England</a>. Philip Derriman wrote in his history of the NSWCA that Johnson "may be said to have been a victim of that affair no less than Barnes". Johnson wrote to the Australian Board of Control, ostensibly tendering his resignation on the grounds of difficulties in travelling to meetings, and thanking the other members for their "courtesy, cooperation and help". He was not mentioned in the board minutes again until his death was noted almost two decades later.

Johnson retained the support of many of the players: six Victorian members of the 1948 team, including <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a>, <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a> and <a href="Neil%20Harvey">Neil Harvey</a>, wrote to the "<a href="Herald%20Sun">Herald</a>" newspaper in Melbourne expressing their "confidence, respect and affection" for the tour manager. Derriman described Johnson as a "considerate, patient, inoffensive man for whom nothing was too much trouble. As a cricket official, he was efficient and dedicated." Johnson was appointed a <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Member of the Order of the British Empire</a> for services to cricket in the 1964 <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a>, and died in 1972 after collapsing when rising to make a speech at a charity lunch in Sydney.

In the <a href="Card%20%28sports%29">undercard</a>, <a href="Kurt%20Angle">Kurt Angle</a> defeated <a href="Paul%20Wight">The Big Show</a> and <a href="John%20Cena">John Cena</a> in a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Basic%20non-elimination%20matches">Triple Threat match</a> to earn a title match for the WWE Championship at <a href="WrestleMania%20XX">WrestleMania XX</a>. Furthermore, <a href="Chavo%20Guerrero%2C%20Jr.">Chavo Guerrero</a> defeated <a href="Rey%20Mysterio%2C%20Jr.">Rey Mysterio</a>.

No Way Out grossed over <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>450,000 ticket sales from an attendance of approximately 11,000 and received 350,000 pay-per-view buys, and was instrumental in helping WWE increase its pay-per-view revenue by $11.9 million compared to the previous year. Like the event, the DVD received favorable reviews.

The event consisted of eight <a href="professional%20wrestling%20match">professional wrestling match</a>es with wrestlers involved in pre-existing <a href="Screenplay">scripted</a> feuds, and <a href="Narrative%20thread">storylines</a>. Wrestlers were portrayed as either <a href="Heel%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">villains</a> or <a href="Face%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">fan favorites</a> as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. All wrestlers belonged to the <a href="SmackDown%20%28WWE%20brand%29">SmackDown!</a> brand – a <a href="WWE%20Brand%20Extension">storyline division</a> in which WWE assigned its employees to a different program, the other being <a href="Raw%20%28WWE%20brand%29">Raw</a>.

After winning a 15-man <a href="Battle%20royal%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">battle royal</a> (a match in which participants are eliminated until one person remains as the winner) on the January 29, 2004 episode of "SmackDown!", <a href="Eddie%20Guerrero">Eddie Guerrero</a> earned the right to challenge for the <a href="WWE%20Championship">WWE Championship</a> at No Way Out against the champion, <a href="Brock%20Lesnar">Brock Lesnar</a> in a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Variations%20of%20singles%20matches">standard wrestling match</a>, also known as a singles match.<ref name="SD1/29a"></ref><ref name="SD1/29b"></ref> Outside the <a href="Narrative%20thread">storyline</a> with Guerrero, Lesnar was involved in a <a href="Feud%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">staged rivalry</a> with <a href="Bill%20Goldberg">Goldberg</a>, a member of the "Raw" program. The feud between Lesnar and Goldberg began at the <a href="Royal%20Rumble%20%282004%29">Royal Rumble</a>, WWE's previous pay-per-view event which involved both brands. Lesnar interfered in the Royal Rumble match, a 30-man battle royal, attacking and eliminating Goldberg from the match. On the week of January 26, 2004, Lesnar and Goldberg conducted <a href="Glossary%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23Promo">promotional in-ring segments</a> on respective episodes of "Raw" and "SmackDown!", in which they insulted each other.<ref name="1/29"></ref> The following week on an episode of "Raw", as a result of the rivalry extending between the two programs, <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20authority%20figures%23General%20Managers">General Manager</a> <a href="Stone%20Cold%20Steve%20Austin">Steve Austin</a> gave Goldberg the option of attending No Way Out by giving him a front-row ticket. That Thursday on "SmackDown!", the storyline between Guerrero and Lesnar was enhanced when they began a brawl after an in-ring interview segment.<ref name="2/5a"></ref><ref name="2/5b"></ref>

On the February 5, 2004 episode of "SmackDown!", the <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20authority%20figures%23General%20Managers%202">General Manager</a> <a href="Paul%20Heyman">Paul Heyman</a> scheduled a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Basic%20non-elimination%20matches">Triple Threat match</a> between <a href="Paul%20Wight">The Big Show</a>, <a href="Kurt%20Angle">Kurt Angle</a> and <a href="John%20Cena">John Cena</a> for No Way Out. The winner of that match would face the WWE Champion at <a href="WrestleMania%20XX">WrestleMania XX</a> for the title. The rivalry continued to develop the following week, when Angle was scheduled to team with Guerrero to face The Big Show and Lesnar, though the latter was portrayed as being unconscious backstage. Cena then replaced Angle in the match and defeated the opposition with Guerrero.<ref name="SD2/12a"></ref><ref name="SD2/12b"></ref>

In February 2004, <a href="WWE%20Cruiserweight%20Championship">WWE Cruiserweight Champion</a> <a href="Rey%20Mysterio%2C%20Jr.">Rey Mysterio</a> produced "Crossing Borders", which was No Way Out's official theme song. In this storyline, <a href="Chavo%20Guerrero%2C%20Jr.">Chavo Guerrero</a> became jealous of the attention Mysterio garnered as a result of recording the song. Therefore, Heyman promoted a match between the two at No Way Out for the WWE Cruiserweight title during the February 5, 2004 episode of "SmackDown!". The following week on "SmackDown!", Mysterio was accompanied by <a href="Jorge%20P%C3%A1ez">Jorge Páez</a>, a <a href="Professional%20boxing">professional boxer</a> and childhood friend of Mysterio who appeared in his "Crossing Borders" <a href="music%20video">music video</a>, to his match against <a href="Yoshihiro%20Tajiri">Tajiri</a>. Mysterio defeated Tajiri but was attacked by Guerrero and <a href="Chavo%20Guerrero%2C%20Sr.">Chavo Guerrero, Sr.</a> after the match until Paez intervened and helped Mysterio.

Before the event began and aired <a href="Live%20television">live</a> on pay-per-view, Tajiri, <a href="Ryan%20Sakoda">Sakoda</a> and <a href="James%20Yun">Akio</a> defeated <a href="%C3%9Altimo%20Drag%C3%B3n">Último Dragón</a>, <a href="Billy%20Kidman">Billy Kidman</a>, and <a href="Paul%20London">Paul London</a> in a 6-Man Tag Team Match on "<a href="WWE%20Heat">Sunday Night Heat</a>.

After "Sunday Night Heat", the pay-per-view began with a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Handicap%20match">handicap match</a> - a tag team match in which a team of two wrestlers face a team of three. WWE Tag Team Champions <a href="Rikishi%20%28wrestler%29">Rikishi</a> and <a href="Scotty%202%20Hotty">Scotty 2 Hotty</a> defended their titles against <a href="The%20Basham%20Brothers">The Basham Brothers</a> (<a href="Doug%20Basham">Doug Basham</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Hollie">Danny Basham</a>) and <a href="Linda%20Miles">Shaniqua</a>. During the match Hotty attempted a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Chop%20drop">worm</a> on Shaniqua, but Shaniqua countered by <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Clothesline">clotheslining</a> Hotty. The challengers had the advantage until Hotty clotheslined the Bashams, causing them to flip over the top ring rope and into ringside. Afterwards, Rikishi delivered a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20throws%23Samoan%20drop">Samoan drop</a>. Rikishi then <a href="Pin%20%28professional%20wrestling%29%23Cover">covered</a> Shaniqua to retain the championships.

Next was a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Variations%20of%20singles%20matches">Singles match</a>, in which <a href="Jamie%20Noble">Jamie Noble</a> was blindfolded as he faced his storyline girlfriend <a href="Nidia%20Guenard">Nidia</a>. Nidia would take advantage of Noble's inability to see by performing antics that caused him to fall. Eventually, Noble was able to apply the <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20holds%23Guillotine%20choke">guillotine choke</a> on Nidia. Noble won the match after he forced her to <a href="Professional%20wrestling%23Submission">submit</a> with this move.

The third contest was a tag team match, in which <a href="The%20World%27s%20Greatest%20Tag%20Team">The World's Greatest Tag Team</a> (<a href="Shelton%20Benjamin">Shelton Benjamin</a> and <a href="Charlie%20Haas">Charlie Haas</a>) faced the <a href="Acolytes%20Protection%20Agency">APA</a> (<a href="John%20Layfield">Bradshaw</a> and <a href="Ron%20Simmons">Faarooq</a>). At one point, Bradshaw performed a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Clothesline">Clothesline from Hell</a> on Haas. Benjamin then delivered a <a href="superkick">superkick</a> to Bradshaw and pinned him to gain the win for his team. After the match, Goldberg was seen arriving at the arena and being escorted to his seat by arena security. In the ring, General Manager Paul Heyman gave a promotional in-ring segment on how "SmackDown!" was the better program over "Raw". Lesnar would come down to the ring to promote his match and to insult Goldberg. As part of the storyline, Goldberg immediately jumped over the barricade into the ring, where Lesnar performed a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Spear">spear</a> on Goldberg however he recuperated and delivered a <a href="Powerslam%23Suplex%20powerslam">Jackhammer</a> to Lesnar. Goldberg was then escorted out of the arena by security.

This altercation was followed by a match between <a href="Bob%20Holly">Hardcore Holly</a> and <a href="Terry%20Gerin">Rhyno</a>. Before the match began, Holly and Rhyno brawled on the entrance ramp, before they entered the ring. Once there, Holly executed a <a href="Suplex%23Superplex">superplex</a>, though, as they recuperated, Rhyno delivered a Gore that caused Holly to roll out of the ring. Afterwards, Holly delivered an <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20throws%23Alabama%20slam">Alabama slam</a> for the pinfall.

In the fifth match <a href="Rey%20Mysterio">Rey Mysterio</a> (managed by <a href="Jorge%20Paez">Jorge Paez</a>), defended his <a href="WWE%20Cruiserweight%20Championship%20%281991-2007%29">WWE Cruiserweight Championship</a> against <a href="Chavo%20Guerrero%20Jr">Chavo Guerrero</a> (managed by his father <a href="Chavo%20Guerrero%2C%20Sr.">Chavo Guerrero, Sr.</a>) During the fight, Mysterio performed a 619 on Guerrero, leading to an attack by Paez on Guerrero, Sr. The referee ordered Paez backstage. Both fighters wrestled inconclusively until Mysterio delivered a second 619. During the second sequence of the move, Guerrero <a href="Pin%20%28professional%20wrestling%29%23Roll-up">grabbed Mysterio's legs</a> and achieved a position with his shoulders spread so as to win both a pinfall and the WWE Cruiserweight title.

The following match was the triple threat match between <a href="WWE%20United%20States%20Championship">United States Champion</a> <a href="Big%20Show">Big Show</a>, <a href="John%20Cena">John Cena</a> and <a href="Kurt%20Angle">Kurt Angle</a>, with the winner facing the <a href="WWE%20Championship">WWE Champion</a> at <a href="WrestleMania%20XX">WrestleMania XX</a>. For the duration of the match, The Big Show, who stood at and weighed , used his body size to his advantage as he <a href="glossary%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23Squash">squashed</a>, or easily and quickly performed moves on, Cena and Angle. Thereafter, Cena delivered an "<a href="Professional%20wrestling%20throws%23Fireman%27s%20carry%20takeover">FU</a>", while Angle threw Big Show out of the ring with an Angle Slam. Angle then applied an <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20holds%23Ankle%20lock">ankle lock</a> on Cena, forcing him to submit. As a result, Angle won a WWE Championship match at WrestleMania XX.

The main event featured <a href="Brock%20Lesnar">Brock Lesnar</a> defending the <a href="WWE%20Championship">WWE Championship</a> against <a href="Eddie%20Guerrero">Eddie Guerrero</a>. The build up to the match had highlighted the confidence and physical dominance of the champion against the technical skill, intelligence and resilience of the challenger; controversially, Guerrero's real-life issues with and recovery from drug addiction were referred to, both as a sign of the challenger's demons, and his resilience. As predicted by the build-up, Lesnar used his size advantage over Guerrero throughout the match. As Lesnar attempted an "<a href="Facebuster%23Fireman%27s%20carry%20facebuster">F-5</a>", he knocked down the <a href="Referee%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">referee</a>. Lesnar then attempted to take advantage of the referee's state, as he went to retrieve the WWE title belt to hit Guerrero. Meanwhile, Goldberg came down into the ring and delivered a spear to Lesnar. Because the referee was incapacitated, Guerrero could not be <a href="Professional%20wrestling%23Disqualification">disqualified</a> for Goldberg's interference. As Goldberg retreated, Guerrero countered Lesnar's 2nd F5 into a <a href="DDT%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">DDT</a> on the title belt while the referee regained consciousness. Guerrero kicked the belt out of the ring to prevent the referee from seeing it and performed his <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20aerial%20techniques%23Frog%20splash">Frog splash</a> to pin Lesnar and win the WWE Championship from him.

At WrestleMania XX, WWE Champion Eddie Guerrero defeated challenger Kurt Angle via pinfall and retained his title. <a href="John%20Layfield">John "Bradshaw" Layfield</a>, portraying a new <a href="Glossary%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23Gimmick">character</a> after the semi-retirement of his tag team partner Faarooq,<ref name="SD3/18"></ref> challenged Guerrero for the <a href="WWE%20Championship">WWE Championship</a> and defeated him at <a href="The%20Great%20American%20Bash%20%282004%29">The Great American Bash</a> to win the title. Guerrero failed to recapture the title from Layfield in a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Cages">steel cage match</a> on "SmackDown!". After Guerrero's <a href="Eddie%20Guerrero%23Death">death</a> in November 2005, WWE held <a href="Eddie%20Guerrero%23Death">Tribute Shows</a> on "Raw" and "SmackDown!" During these programs, No Way Out was the main highlight of Guerrero's career, as it was where he won his only World Championship. John Cena began a rivalry with The Big Show over his <a href="WWE%20United%20States%20Championship">WWE United States Championship</a> and, at WrestleMania XX, Cena defeated Show to win the title. Goldberg and Lesnar continued their rivalry, leading to a match promoted at WrestleMania XX, in which Goldberg defeated Lesnar. After their match, Goldberg and Lesnar left the company, although Lesnar would make his return in April 2012 and Goldberg made his return in October 2016.

Rey Mysterio and Chavo Guerrero's storyline over the WWE Cruiserweight Championship also continued, culminating in a battle royal match at WrestleMania XX involving other wrestlers. Guerrero last eliminated Mysterio to retain his title in this match. After the <a href="2004%20WWE%20Draft%20Lottery">Draft Lottery</a>, a mock <a href="Draft%20%28sports%29">sports draft lottery</a> in which wrestlers switched programs, <a href="Rico%20Constantino">Rico</a> was drafted to SmackDown!, while Shelton Benjamin was drafted to Raw, in the process splitting up The World's Greatest Tag Team. Afterward, Haas and Rico won the WWE Tag Team Championship from Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty on "SmackDown!"

The <a href="Cow%20Palace">Cow Palace</a> arena usually can accommodate 13,000, but the capacity was reduced for No Way Out 2004. This event grossed over <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>450,000 from an approximate attendance of 11,000 which was the maximum allowed. It also received 350,000 pay-per-view buys. No Way Out helped World Wrestling Entertainment earn $43.7 million in revenue from pay-per-view events versus $31.8 million the previous year; <a href="Linda%20McMahon">Linda McMahon</a>, then <a href="Chief%20executive%20officer">CEO</a> of WWE, confirmed this statement on June 21, 2004 in a quarterly financial report. The event received mostly positive reviews. <a href="Canadian%20Online%20Explorer">Canadian Online Explorer</a>'s professional wrestling section described the event as ""Smackdown!" us our money's worth last night but they also set up what's probably going to be the best match at Wrestlemania." Kevin Sowers from PWTorch described the main event between Eddie Guerrero and Brock Lesnar as "one to remember for a long time." The event was released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> on March 16, 2004. After its release, the DVD received a rating of 8.5 out of 10 points by <a href="IGN">IGN</a>.

Over the Rainbow (Connie Talbot album)

Over the Rainbow is the debut album of the <a href="child%20singer">child singer</a> <a href="Connie%20Talbot">Connie Talbot</a>, and was released 26 November 2007 by Rainbow Recording Company. Talbot, who had entered the public eye after her appearance on <a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent%20%28series%201%29">the first series</a> of "<a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent">Britain's Got Talent</a>" at age six, signed with Rainbow, an independent label, after briefly recording with <a href="Sony%20BMG">Sony BMG</a>. "Over the Rainbow" consists entirely of <a href="cover%20%28music%29">covers</a> of <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> and <a href="Christmas%20music">Christmas</a> songs, and was recorded primarily in a spare room in the house of Talbot's aunt, in an attempt not to interrupt Talbot's childhood by disrupting her regular activities. Although public appearances were initially kept to a minimum, Talbot did make appearances to promote the album, and performed in public several times after the British release.

"Over the Rainbow" received poor reviews. Though praising Talbot's voice, critics noted a lack of depth in the performances, and questioned the appropriateness of releasing and rating work by such a young artist. The album peaked at number 35 on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>. Despite its poor chart performance, additional copies of the album had to be pressed after sales were higher than expected. Talbot later toured Asia in support of the album; "Over the Rainbow" achieved more success on Asian charts, reaching number one in Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong.

"Over the Rainbow" was rereleased on 18 June 2008 with an updated track list, replacing some of the Christmas-themed tracks of the original with more general covers. The first single from the album, a cover of <a href="Bob%20Marley">Bob Marley</a>'s "<a href="Three%20Little%20Birds">Three Little Birds</a>," was released in June 2008, and a music video for the song was shot in Jamaica. On 14 October, the album was released in the US, appearing on several "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" charts. Talbot visited the US to promote the album, appearing on national television.

<a href="Connie%20Talbot">Connie Talbot</a> entered the public eye appearing, aged six, on <a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent%20%28series%201%29">the first series</a> of the <a href="reality%20television">reality</a> programme "<a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent">Britain's Got Talent</a>", reaching the final. After briefly recording with <a href="Sony%20BMG">Sony BMG</a>, Talbot was signed to Rainbow Recording Company, an offshoot of the label Rhythm Riders made specifically for her. To produce "Over the Rainbow", Talbot worked with <a href="John%20Arnison">John Arnison</a>, then-manager to <a href="Gabrielle%20%28singer%29">Gabrielle</a> and <a href="Billy%20Ocean">Billy Ocean</a>, and <a href="Marc%20Marot">Marc Marot</a>, a former managing director of <a href="Island%20Records">Island Records</a>. It was produced and mixed by <a href="Simon%20Hill%20%28musician%29">Simon Hill</a> and <a href="Rob%20May">Rob May</a>. A recording schedule was worked out so that Talbot could continue with her normal school activities while recording the album in her aunt Vicky's spare bedroom, which her mother described as "a better solution" than the one offered by Sony BMG, "which has not robbed her of her childhood". Talbot said that "it was just amazing that we could do it in my auntie's house". Arnison and Marot asked the Talbot family to "write down a list of the songs that Connie would sing at her birthday party" to help choose the track listing, and then "thought long and hard" about including more adult songs on the album. Talbot herself insisted that they should.

The final version of "Over the Rainbow" was recorded at <a href="Olympic%20Studios">Olympic Studios</a>, on 12 October 2007. Arnison described the recording process by saying that Talbot "hadn't sung nursery rhymes; she'd always sung classic tracks. So it was actually quite an easy task to make the record". The album was released on 26 November 2007, with an initial pressing of 50,000 copies. However, an additional 120,000 had to be created after the album sold out in a matter of days.

"Over the Rainbow" was re-released on 18 June 2008, with the new version being made available for pre-order in May. The re-release featured three new tracks to replace the Christmas-themed songs on the original album. The new tracks were made available from Talbot's official website so that those who bought the original need not buy the re-release. Talbot's cover of <a href="Bob%20Marley">Bob Marley</a>'s "<a href="Three%20Little%20Birds">Three Little Birds</a>" was released as a single on 10 June 2008, and a music video was shot in <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> to for the release. "Over the Rainbow" was released in the US on 14 October, and Talbot travelled to the country with her family to publicise it. Talbot's cover of "<a href="I%20Will%20Always%20Love%20You">I Will Always Love You</a>" was released as a single in the US on 7 April, along with a newly recorded version of "<a href="You%20Raise%20Me%20Up">You Raise Me Up</a>".

Although Arnison claimed he did not "want to put [Talbot] through the promotional grind which most artists go through because she is too young", Talbot made several public appearances after the release of "Over the Rainbow". These included headlining the <a href="Great%20Bridge%2C%20West%20Midlands">Great Bridge</a> Christmas and Winter Festival, which local police threatened to cancel unless crowds clamouring to reach the tent in which Talbot was performing could be brought under control. At the event, on 7 December 2007, Talbot was quoted as saying "I love it here, it's brilliant, really fun", but she had to be ushered off-stage by the police. Talbot performed publicly in Walsall's <a href="HMV">HMV</a> store, and in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>'s <a href="Centenary%20Square">Centenary Square</a>. TV appearances included slots on <a href="GMTV">GMTV</a> and "<a href="5%20News">5 News</a>", both on the day of the album's release.

In April and May 2008, Talbot toured Asia to promote "Over the Rainbow". Asian journalists attributed her success in the region to her videos on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>, with writers for the "<a href="Sun.Star">Sun.Star</a>" noting that her most-viewed video had been watched over 14 million times, and Bernard Koh, of "<a href="The%20Straits%20Times">The Straits Times</a>", saying that videos of Talbot's performances had been watched over 30 million times. The tour made stops in South Korea, <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, Hong Kong and Singapore, and Talbot and her family returned to England in late May.

News that "Over the Rainbow" was to be released in the US resulted in Talbot receiving attention from American press sources including <a href="Fox%20Business%20Network">Fox Business Network</a> and <a href="MarketWatch">MarketWatch</a>. Kerri Mason, writing for <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a>, described Talbot's videos as "<a href="viral%20video">viral</a>", and added that she had been watched on YouTube over 46 million times. Talbot travelled to the US for a promotional tour to coincide with the release, where she performed on "<a href="The%20Ellen%20DeGeneres%20Show">The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>" and appeared as a guest on "<a href="The%20Oprah%20Winfrey%20Show">The Oprah Winfrey Show</a>". She made appearances in Los Angeles, <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, New York City and Washington D.C. Following the television appearances, sales of the album were boosted in the US. Talbot again travelled to the US to promote her single "I Will Always Love You" in April 2009, returning again in May. Appearances included a performance on "<a href="Good%20Day%20New%20York">Good Day New York</a>" on <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox Broadcasting Company</a>'s <a href="WNYW">WNYW</a>.

"Over the Rainbow" received negative reviews from music critics. Sharon Mawer, of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, praised Talbot, saying that she "can sing, for a seven-year-old, and most of the notes (if not all of them) are in the right order and sung to the right pitch; the timing is fine too". However, she argued that the album had "no feeling, no emotion, no realization of what each song is about". Mawer ultimately gave "Over the Rainbow" a rating of two out of five stars. Nick Levine, writing for <a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>, said in a review of the album that Talbot had a "sweet, pure voice", but that there is "no nuance or depth to her performance". Though awarding the album two out of five, he said that "there's something inherently wrong about awarding a star rating to a seven-year-old", and that "the decidedly adult concept of musical merit should have nothing to do with [her music]".

Reviewers writing in the British newspaper the "Harlow Star" also commented on Talbot's age, saying that "there's no doubt she's a sweet little girl with a nice voice", but asking whether there is "something inherently wrong with thrusting a child into the limelight at such a young age". Rashvin Bedi, writing for Malaysian newspaper "<a href="The%20Star%20%28Malaysia%29">The Star</a>", praised the album, saying that "Connie sings with ease and manages the high notes admirably", but asked whether "people would buy an album of the same songs sung by a 20-year-old".

The album entered in the British album charts at 35 on 8 December 2007, but was at the bottom of the charts by Christmas, despite having been tipped as a potential Christmas number one. It remained in the charts for five weeks, peaking at 35. However, the album was certified <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry%23Sales%20certificates">gold</a> in Britain in early December, with Talbot being presented a gold disc by <a href="Phillip%20Schofield">Phillip Schofield</a> on daytime television programme "<a href="This%20Morning%20%28TV%20series%29">This Morning</a>".

Following Talbot's tour of Asia, it was reported that the album had reached number one on the charts in Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, as well as reaching number three in Singapore.
