Joseph Grimaldi

Joseph Grimaldi (18 December 1778 – 31 May 1837) was an English actor, comedian and dancer, who became the most popular English entertainer of the <a href="Regency%20era">Regency era</a>. In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of <a href="Harlequinade%23Clown">Clown</a> in the <a href="harlequinade">harlequinade</a> that formed part of British <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a>s, notably at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a> and the <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells">Sadler's Wells</a> and <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Covent Garden</a> theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that the harlequinade role of Clown became known as "Joey", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's <a href="Clown%23Whiteface">whiteface</a> make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns. Grimaldi originated catchphrases such as "Here we are again!", which continue to feature in modern pantomimes.

Born in London to an entertainer father, Grimaldi began to perform as a child, making his stage debut at Drury Lane in 1780. He became successful at the Sadler's Wells Theatre the following year; his first major role was as Little Clown in the pantomime "The Triumph of Mirth; or, Harlequin's Wedding" in 1781, in which he starred alongside his father. After a brief schooling, he appeared in various low-budget productions and became a sought-after child performer. He took leading parts in "Valentine and Orson" (1794) and "The Talisman; or, Harlequin Made Happy" (1796), the latter of which brought him wider recognition.

Towards the end of the 1790s, Grimaldi starred in a pantomime version of "<a href="Robinson%20Crusoe%23Stage%20and%20film">Robinson Crusoe</a>", which confirmed his credentials as a key pantomime performer. Many productions followed, but his career at Drury Lane was becoming turbulent, and he left the theatre in 1806. In his new association with the Covent Garden theatre, he appeared at the end of the same year in <a href="Thomas%20John%20Dibdin">Thomas John Dibdin</a>'s "Harlequin and <a href="Mother%20Goose">Mother Goose</a>; or, The Golden Egg", which included perhaps his best known portrayal of Clown. Grimaldi's residencies at Covent Garden and Sadler's Wells ran simultaneously, and he became known as London's leading Clown and comic entertainer, enjoying many successes at both theatres. His popularity in London led to a demand for him to appear in provincial theatres throughout England, where he commanded large fees.

Grimaldi's association with Sadler's Wells came to an end in 1820, chiefly as a result of his deteriorating relationship with the theatre's management. After numerous injuries over the years from his energetic clowning, his health was also declining rapidly, and he retired in 1823. He appeared occasionally on stage for a few years thereafter, but his performances were restricted by his worsening physical disabilities. In his last years, Grimaldi lived in relative obscurity and became a depressed, impoverished alcoholic. He outlived both his wife and his actor son, <a href="J.%20S.%20Grimaldi">Joseph Samuel</a>, dying at home in <a href="Islington">Islington</a> in 1837, aged 58.

Grimaldi was born in <a href="Clare%20Market">Clare Market</a>, in <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>, London, into a family of dancers and comic performers. His great-grandfather, John Baptist Grimaldi, was a dentist by trade and an amateur performer, who in the 1730s moved from Italy to England. There he performed the role of <a href="Harlequinade%23Pantaloon">Pantaloon</a> opposite <a href="John%20Rich%20%28producer%29">John Rich</a>'s <a href="Harlequinade%23Harlequin">Harlequin</a>. John Baptist's son, Grimaldi's paternal grandfather, Giovanni Battista Grimaldi, began performing at an early age and spent much of his career in Italy and France. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, Giovanni was held in the Paris <a href="Bastille">Bastille</a> as the result of a scandalous performance. After his release, Giovanni moved to London in 1742, where John Baptist introduced him to John Rich; Giovanni then defrauded Rich and fled to the continent, where he later died.

Grimaldi's father, Joseph Giuseppe Grimaldi (c. 1713–1788), an actor and dancer (known professionally as Giuseppe or "the Signor"), also made his way to London in around 1760. His first London appearance was at the <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Theatre">King's Theatre</a>. He was later engaged by <a href="David%20Garrick">David Garrick</a> to play Pantaloon in <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a>s at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a>, earning high praise, and eventually became the <a href="ballet%20master">ballet master</a> there. Grimaldi's mother, Rebecca Brooker, was born in <a href="Holborn">Holborn</a> in 1764. She was apprenticed to Giuseppe Grimaldi in 1773 as a dancer and public speaker, and she became his mistress shortly afterwards, even though she was under 14 and he was about 60.

Grimaldi's father was a serial philanderer who had at least ten children with three different women. In 1778, he divided his time between two London addresses occupied by his mistresses, Brooker and Anne Perry. Both women gave birth that year, Perry to a daughter named Henrietta and Brooker to Joseph. Although jubilant at the birth of his first son, Giuseppe Grimaldi spent little time with Brooker, living mostly with Perry, and probably maintaining other mistresses as well. Brooker raised her son alone for the first few years in Clare Market, a <a href="slum">slum</a> area of west London. In about 1780, Brooker gave birth to a second son, John Baptiste. Keen to set up an acting dynasty, Giuseppe left Perry and his daughter and moved with Brooker and his two sons to Little Russell Street, <a href="High%20Holborn">High Holborn</a>. Giuseppe, who often displayed eccentric and obsessive behaviour, was a strict disciplinarian and often beat his children for disobeying his orders. A fascination with death consumed his later life; he would feign death in front of his children, so as to gauge their reactions, and he insisted on his eldest daughter, Mary, decapitating him after his death because of his fear of being buried alive, a task which earned her £5 extra in her inheritance.

From the age of two, Grimaldi was taught to act the characters in the <a href="harlequinade">harlequinade</a> by his father. Although he and his younger brother John Baptiste both displayed acting talent, Joseph was groomed for the London stage. He made his stage debut at the <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells%20Theatre">Sadler's Wells Theatre</a> in late 1780, when Giuseppe took him on stage for his "first bow and first tumble". On 16 April 1781, <a href="Richard%20Brinsley%20Sheridan">Richard Brinsley Sheridan</a>, the manager of Drury Lane, cast both Giuseppe and Grimaldi in the pantomime "The Wizard of the Silver Rocks; or, Harlequin's Release". Sheridan employed dozens of children, including Grimaldi, as extras at Drury Lane.

On <a href="Boxing%20Day">Boxing Day</a> 1781, Grimaldi took the part of Little Clown in the pantomime "The Triumph of Mirth; or, Harlequin's Wedding" at Drury Lane. It was a success for him personally, and the pantomime enjoyed an extended run until March 1782. As a result of his performance, he received further work offers from the management and became an established juvenile performer at Drury Lane. At the same time, he was a prolific performer at Sadler's Wells where he played a host of minor roles, including monkeys, imps, fairies and demons. The Drury Lane season ran every year from September to late spring, with Sadler's Wells playing from 15 April to the second week in October. Though the two theatres staged similar productions, they appealed to different audiences: Drury Lane to the wealthy classes of society and Sadler's Wells to the boisterous working class. Although Grimaldi's stage career was flourishing, Giuseppe enrolled him at Mr Ford's Academy, a boarding school in <a href="Putney">Putney</a>, which educated the children of theatrical performers. Although Grimaldi struggled with reading and writing, he showed a talent for art, as evidenced by some of his drawings that survive in the Harvard Theatre Collection.
Their success on the London stage allowed the Grimaldis to enjoy an affluent lifestyle in contrast to other working-class families living in Clare Market and Holborn. By the age of six, Grimaldi was considered a prominent stage performer by the press, with one critic from the "Gazetteer" commenting that "the infant son of Grimaldi performs in an astonishing manner". One evening, Grimaldi was playing the part of a monkey and was led onto the stage by his father, who had attached a chain to Grimaldi's waist. Giuseppe swung his young son around his head "with the utmost velocity", when the chain snapped, causing young Grimaldi to land in the orchestra pit. From 1789 Grimaldi would appear alongside his siblings in an act entitled "The Three Young Grimaldis".

Grimaldi's father suffered ill health for many years and died of <a href="dropsy">dropsy</a> in 1788. As a result, at age 9, Grimaldi became the family's principal breadwinner. Sheridan paid him an above-average wage of £1 a week at Drury Lane, and allowed his mother to work at Drury Lane as a dancer. However, the proprietors of Sadler's Wells were less supportive, cutting Grimaldi's pay from 15 <a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">shilling</a>s to 3 shillings a week, at which level it remained for the next three years. The loss of Giuseppe's income and Joseph's reduced summertime earnings meant the Grimaldis could no longer afford to keep the house in Holborn. They moved to the slum district of <a href="St%20Giles%2C%20London">St. Giles</a>, where they took lodgings with a furrier in Great Wild Street. Grimaldi's brother, John Baptiste, illegally signed on as a cabin boy aboard a frigate in 1788, when he was nine, using a false identity. Grimaldi saw him only once more in his life.
<a href="John%20Philip%20Kemble">John Philip Kemble</a> took over the producer's (director's) duties at Drury Lane later in 1788 when Sheridan was promoted to chief treasurer. Sheridan often employed Grimaldi in minor roles in Kemble's productions and continued to allow him to work concurrently at Sadler's Wells. Grimaldi took an interest in the design and construction of stage scenery and would often help to design sets. His stage performances over the next two years did not garner him the kind of success he had experienced under the management of his father, and the role of pre-eminent <a href="Harlequinade%23Clown">Clown</a> in London productions soon fell to Jean-Baptiste Dubois, a versatile French acrobat, horseman, singer and <a href="Strongman%20%28strength%20athlete%29">strongman</a>, with a formidable repertoire of comic tricks. Grimaldi worked as Dubois' assistant, although in later life he denied that he had been the Frenchman's student.

In 1791 the Drury Lane Theatre was demolished, and Grimaldi was loaned to the <a href="Haymarket%20Theatre">Haymarket Theatre</a>, where he appeared, briefly, in the opera "<a href="Cymon">Cymon</a>", which starred the <a href="tenor">tenor</a> <a href="Michael%20Kelly%20%28tenor%29">Michael Kelly</a>. On 21 April 1794, the new Drury Lane theatre opened, and Grimaldi, now 15 years old, resumed his place as one of the principal juvenile performers. The same year, he played his first major part since his father's death; as the dwarf in "Valentine and Orson". Two years later, at Sadler's Wells, he played the role of Hag Morad in the <a href="Thomas%20John%20Dibdin">Thomas John Dibdin</a> Christmas pantomime "The Talisman; or, Harlequin Made Happy". The pantomime was a success, and Grimaldi received rave reviews. The Drury Lane management were eager to capitalise on his success, and later that year he was cast in "Lodoiska", a Parisian hit adapted for the London stage by Kemble. Grimaldi played Camasin, a role that required the acrobatic and sword-fighting skills that he had learned as a child. He won wider admiration as <a href="Harlequinade%23Pierrot">Pierrot</a> in the 1796 Christmas pantomime of "<a href="Robinson%20Crusoe%23Stage%20and%20film">Robinson Crusoe</a>" at Drury Lane.

Grimaldi met his future wife, Maria Hughes in 1796. The eldest daughter of the proprietor of the Sadler's Wells theatre, Richard Hughes, Maria was introduced to Grimaldi by his mother, Rebecca Brooker, and a romance soon blossomed. They married on 11 May 1799 and moved to 37 Penton Street, <a href="Pentonville">Pentonville</a>. Later that year, Grimaldi appeared in a succession of shows including "<a href="A%20Trip%20to%20Scarborough">A Trip to Scarborough</a>" (as a countryman) and "<a href="Rule%20a%20Wife%20and%20Have%20a%20Wife">Rule a Wife and Have a Wife</a>" (as a maid). The roles he took in these productions were eccentric and usually reserved for <a href="Low%20comedy">low comedians</a>. Despite this, he was praised for his characterisations and was deemed a player of legitimate adult roles at Drury Lane, which qualified him to become a member of the prestigious <a href="Drury%20Lane%20Theatrical%20Fund">Drury Lane Theatrical Fund</a>.

In 1798, Drury Lane suspended its tradition of staging an annual Christmas pantomime, which meant that Grimaldi had to seek work elsewhere during the festive period. The following year, with the help of his father-in-law, he joined the company at <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells%20Theatre">Sadler's Wells</a>, where he played roles in several <a href="Charles%20Dibdin%20%28the%20younger%29">Charles Dibdin</a> plays. Grimaldi made a big impression, especially in Dibdin's Easter 1800 pantomime, "Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World", based on <a href="Robert%20Paltock">Robert Paltock</a>'s 1751 novel. For this elaborate production, which featured two Clowns (Dubois and Grimaldi), Dibdin introduced new costume designs. Clown's costume was "garishly colourful ... patterned with large diamonds and circles, and fringed with tassels and ruffs," instead of the tatty servant's outfit that had been used for a century. The production was a hit, and the new costume design was copied by others in London. Despite Dubois' "endless bag of tricks [and] vast array of skills", his performance appeared artificial, in contrast to Grimaldi, who was better able to "draw the audience into believing the essential comedic qualities" of Clown.

At Drury Lane later in 1800, he starred as an officer in "The Wheel of Fortune" by <a href="Richard%20Cumberland%20%28dramatist%29">Richard Cumberland</a>, a Jewish pedlar in "The Indian", as Clown in "Robinson Crusoe", and as the Second Gravedigger in "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>", alongside John Philip Kemble. Grimaldi's wife Maria and his unborn child died during childbirth on 18 October 1800. To cope with his grief, Grimaldi would often perform two shows a night; one at Sadler's Wells and the other at Drury Lane.
With the Christmas season approaching, and the success of "Peter Wilkins" still a topic of conversation within theatrical circles, Kemble decided to stage the first Drury Lane pantomime in three years, "Harlequin Amulet; or, The Magick of Mona", with Grimaldi as <a href="Pulcinella">Punch</a> and then as Clown, instead of Dubois. In this production, <a href="Harlequin">Harlequin</a> became "romantic and mercurial, instead of mischievous", leaving Grimaldi's Clown as the "undisputed agent" of chaos. The pantomime was a great success, running for thirty-three performances and having a second Drury Lane season at Easter 1801; as a result, Grimaldi became recognised as one of London's leading Clowns. Grimaldi originated the catchphrase "Here we are again!", which is still used in pantomime. He also was known for the mischievous catchphrase "Shall I?", which prompted audience members to respond "Yes!"

Grimaldi and Dubois appeared together again later that spring at Sadler's Wells in Dibdin's "Harlequin Alchemist", which set up a mock duel between the two Clowns, with the audience deciding who could pull the most hideous face. Grimaldi consistently won. In the next piece, "Harlequin Benedick; or, The Ghost of Mother Shipton". Dubois was relegated to the role of Pierrot, while Grimaldi played Clown. Grimaldi's mother was in the cast, appearing as the Butcher's Wife. He then appeared in another Dibdin play, "The Great Devil". During the run, he accidentally injured himself on stage by shooting himself in the foot and was confined to bed for five weeks. His mother became so concerned at her son's fragile and still grief-stricken state that she employed a dancer at Drury Lane, Mary Bristow, to care for him full-time during those weeks. They formed a close friendship, which resulted in a loving relationship, and they married on 24 December 1801.
After a falling-out with Kemble at Drury Lane, Grimaldi was dismissed and began appearing at the nearby <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Theatre Royal, Covent Garden</a>. He also took up an engagement at his father-in-law's theatre in <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>. There was no Christmas 1801 or Easter 1802 pantomime at Drury Lane, and Kemble noticed a reduction in his theatre's audiences. Grimaldi began to appear in provincial theatres, with the first appearance being in <a href="Rochester%2C%20Kent">Rochester, Kent</a>, in 1801. In March 1802, he returned to Kent where he performed in pantomime, earning £300 for two days work. His dismissal from Drury Lane was short-lived, and he was reinstated within a few months in a revival of "Harlequin Amulet".

Sadler's Wells closed for refurbishment at the end of its 1801 season and re-opened on 19 April 1802; Grimaldi returned to take a major role in the Easter pantomime, for which he designed the look of his recurring Clown character "Joey". He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s. Later in 1802, Dubois left the Sadler's Wells company, making Grimaldi the sole resident Clown. Grimaldi starred in "St. George, Champion of England" opposite his friend <a href="Jack%20Bologna">Jack Bologna</a>. This was followed by "Ko and Zoa; or, the Belle Savage". A critic from "The Times" remarked that the pair's death scene together was "truely affecting". Bologna and Grimaldi's on-stage partnership had by now become the most popular on the British stage; the "<a href="Morning%20Chronicle">Morning Chronicle</a>" thought they "stood unrivalled" compared to other acts within the harlequinade.

On 21 November 1802, his wife Mary bore Grimaldi his only child, a son, <a href="J.%20S.%20Grimaldi">Joseph Samuel</a>, whom they called "JS". Grimaldi introduced his young son to the eccentric atmosphere at both Drury Lane and Sadler's Wells from the age of 18 months. Although eager to have his son follow him onto the stage, Grimaldi felt that it was more important for the boy to have an education and eventually enrolled him at Mr Ford's Academy.
Grimaldi returned to Drury Lane late in 1802 and starred in a production of "Bluebeard", followed by the Christmas pantomime "Love and Magic". In 1803 Grimaldi's contract at Sadler's Wells was extended for another three years. He starred as Rufo the Robber in "Red Riding Hood", as Sir John Bull in "New Broom" and Aminadab in <a href="Susanna%20Centlivre">Susanna Centlivre</a>'s "<a href="A%20Bold%20Stroke%20for%20a%20Wife">A Bold Stroke for a Wife</a>". The <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> had started, and the new proprietors of Sadler's Wells and Drury Lane looked to Grimaldi to satisfy audiences eager for comic relief. "Cinderella; or, the Little Glass Slipper" was presented at Drury Lane on 3 January 1804. Grimaldi played the part of Pedro, a servant to Cinderella's sisters. The production was a major success for the theatre, enhanced by Michael Kelly's musical score; however Grimaldi and the critics grew concerned that the theatre was underusing his talents and that he was miscast in the role.

The Sadler's Wells season commenced at Easter 1805, and Grimaldi and Jack Bologna enjoyed a successful period. Drury Lane staged the opera "Lodoiska", in which Grimaldi, his mother and his wife all had starring roles. After this he was asked to choreograph <a href="John%20Tobin%20%28dramatist%29">John Tobin</a>'s play, "The Honey Moon", at Drury Lane on short notice. He accepted on the proviso that his wages be increased for the show's entire run and not just until a new dancing instructor was found. The Drury Lane management agreed to pay Grimaldi £2 more per week. A few weeks into his new assignment, management appointed <a href="James%20Harvey%20D%27Egville">James D'Egville</a> as the new ballet master. D'Egville's debut production was "Terpsichore's Return", in which Grimaldi played Pan, a role which he considered to be one of his best assignments to date. That October, however, the theatre reduced his wages. The extra £2 that he had been promised had been deducted from his salary when "Terpsichore" closed, and he approached Thomas Dibdin for advice. Dibdin advised him to leave Drury Lane and to take up a residency at the nearby Covent Garden Theatre. Grimaldi wrote to <a href="Thomas%20Harris%20%28theatre%20manager%29">Thomas Harris</a>, the manager of the Covent Garden Theatre, hoping to persuade him to stage Christmas pantomimes. Harris was already a supporter of the shows and had employed the writing talents of both Charles Dibdin and his co-writer <a href="Charles%20Farley">Charles Farley</a>. Grimaldi met with Harris and obtained a contract. Before joining that theatre, however, he had to satisfy prior commitments at Drury Lane, appearing in the poorly received "Harlequin's Fireside".

In 1806, Grimaldi bought a second home, a cottage in <a href="Finchley">Finchley</a>, to which he retired between seasons. He was engaged to appear at <a href="Astley%27s%20Theatre">Astley's Theatre</a> in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, in a play by Thomas Dibdin and his brother Charles. The Dibdins leased the theatre, but it was badly in need of repair. As a result audiences were small, and the show's box-office takings suffered. Grimaldi donated his salary to help pay for the renovation of the theatre. The Dibdin company, with Grimaldi, transferred to the nearby Crow Street Theatre where they performed a <a href="benefit%20concert">benefit concert</a> in aid of Astley's. After two more plays, the company moved back to London.

"Harlequin and the Forty Virgins" opened the Easter season at Sadler's Wells and lasted the entire season. Grimaldi sang "Me and my Neddy", which proved very successful for both him and the theatre. Amid great expectations, he appeared at the Covent Garden Theatre on 9 October 1806 playing Orson opposite Charles Farley's Valentine in Thomas Dibdin's "Valentine and Orson". Grimaldi, who considered the role of Orson to be the most physically and mentally demanding of his career, nevertheless performed the part with enthusiasm on tour in the provinces.

Perhaps the best-known of Grimaldi's pantomimes was Thomas Dibdin's "Harlequin and <a href="Mother%20Goose">Mother Goose</a>; or, The Golden Egg", which opened on 29 December 1806 at the Covent Garden Theatre. As in most pantomimes, he played a dual role, in this case first as "Bugle", a wealthy but abrasive eccentric womaniser, and after the transformation to the harlequinade, as Clown. "Mother Goose" was a runaway success with its London audiences and earned an extraordinary profit of £20,000. It completed a run of 111 performances over a two-year residency, a record for any London theatre production at the time. Grimaldi, however, considered the performance to be one of the worst of his career and became depressed. Critics thought differently, attributing the pantomime's success to Grimaldi's performance. It prompted one critic from "European Magazine" to write: "We have not for several years witnessed a Pantomime more attractive than this: whether we consider the variety and ingenuity of the mechanical devices [or] the whim, humour, and agility of the Harlequin, Clown and Pantaloon". Kemble stated that Grimaldi had "proved himself [as] the great master of his art", while the actress <a href="Dorothea%20Jordan">Mrs Jordan</a> called him "a genius ... yet unapproached". The production regularly played to packed audiences.
In September 1808, a fire at the Covent Garden theatre destroyed much of the "Mother Goose" scenery; the production transferred to the Haymarket Theatre where it completed its run. While Kemble and Harris raised funds and renovated Covent Garden, Grimaldi made provincial appearances in Manchester and Liverpool. The Covent Garden theatre re-opened in December 1809 with a revival of "Mother Goose". In an attempt to recover the costs incurred by the rebuilding, Kemble raised the theatre's seat prices, causing audiences to <a href="OP%20Riots">protest violently</a> for more than two months, and the management was forced to reinstate the old prices. Grimaldi's 1809–10 productions included "Don Juan", in which he appeared as <a href="Scaramouche">Scaramouche</a>, and "Castles in the Air", as Clown. Later in 1810, he appeared in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> in a benefit performance in aid of his sister-in-law. The following year, Grimaldi sang "Tippitywitchet" for the first time at Sadler's Wells in Charles Dibdin's pantomime "Bang up, or, Harlequin Prime"; it became one of his most popular songs.

By 1812, despite Grimaldi's success as a performer, he was close to <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> as a result of his wife's extravagant spending, a number of thefts by his accountant and the cost of maintaining both an idyllic country lifestyle and his son JS's private education. The strain on Grimaldi's finances caused him to accept as many provincial engagements as he could. That year, he travelled to <a href="Cheltenham">Cheltenham</a> and appeared again as Scaramouche in a revival of "Don Juan". In nearby <a href="Gloucester">Gloucester</a> he met the poet <a href="Lord%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>, on whose poem the play was based, at a dinner party. Byron was in awe at meeting the famous Clown, stating that he felt "great and unbounded satisfaction in becoming acquainted with a man of such rare and profound talents". Grimaldi returned to London to star as Queen Ronabellyana with much success in the Covent Garden Christmas pantomime, "Harlequin and the Red Dwarf; or, The Adamant Rock". After this, he increasingly played "dame" roles.
Sadler's Wells opened its season in April 1814 with Grimaldi appearing in, amongst others, "Kaloc; or, The Pirate Slave". That year he played the title role in "Robinson Crusoe" at Sadler's Wells, with his young son, JS, making his stage debut as <a href="Man%20Friday">Man Friday</a>. Other pantomimes followed at Sadler's Wells that year, including "The Talking Bird", in which he played Clown, and he also played Clown in productions at the Surrey Theatre and Covent Garden – a challenging schedule. Later in 1814, he played the title role in a revival of "Don Juan" at Sadler's Wells, with JS in his second role as Scaramouche. The receipts at the box-office were unusually large and confirmed, in Grimaldi's mind, that his son was capable of sustaining his own career. Grimaldi suffered two setbacks towards the end of the year, becoming housebound for a few months due to illness and learning of the death of his friend, mentor and former father-in-law, Richard Hughes, in December. In early 1815, Grimaldi and his son played father and son Clowns in "Harlequin and Fortunio; or, Shing-Moo and Thun-Ton".

During 1815, the relationship between Grimaldi and Thomas Dibdin became strained. Dibdin, as manager at Sadler's Wells, denied Grimaldi's request for a month's leave to tour the provincial theatres. Dibdin was annoyed at the tolerant attitude Grimaldi displayed in his position as the Chief Judge and Treasurer of the Sadler's Wells Court of Rectitude, a body set up to regulate the behaviour of performers. Grimaldi briefly left Sadler's Wells in 1815 to conduct a tour of the northern provincial theatres. Alongside Jack Bologna, he staged fifty-six shows during the summer months and earned £1,743, a much higher amount than he earned at Sadler's Wells. Dibdin was struggling, and after the tour Grimaldi used the problems at Sadler's Wells to negotiate a lucrative contract. Dibdin agreed to a salary increase but bristled at Grimaldi's other demands and eventually gave the position of resident Clown to the little-known Signor Paulo.

In 1815, Grimaldi played Clown in "Harlequin and the Sylph of the Oak; or, The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green" at Covent Garden, followed by the Christmas pantomime "Robinson Crusoe; or, The Bold Buccaneer", in which he played Friday to Charles Farley's title character. Grimaldi conducted a remunerative but gruelling tour to Scotland, Manchester and Liverpool in 1818. He sustained bruising and strains from two falls, the second of which left him briefly unable to walk. He and Mary moved to 56 <a href="Exmouth%20Market">Exmouth Market</a>, <a href="Islington">Islington</a>, where he recovered from his injuries before going on tour with his son.
At Easter 1819, in "The Talking Bird, or, Perizade Columbine", he introduced perhaps his best known song "Hot Codlins", an audience participation song about a seller of roasted apples who gets drunk on gin while working the streets of London. Songs about trades were popular on the stage in the 1800s. Grimaldi sought inspiration for the character of the apple seller by walking around the streets of London and observing real-life tradespeople.

Despite Signor Paulo's success at Sadler's Wells, Richard Hughes's widow Lucy, who was a majority shareholder at the theatre, pleaded with Grimaldi to return. He agreed on the conditions that he was sold an eighth share in the theatre, remained the resident Clown and received a salary of 12 <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a> a week. She agreed to his terms, and he took the part of Grimaldicat in the 1818 Easter pantomime "The Marquis De Carabas; or, Puss in Boots". The show was a disaster and closed after one night. Grimaldi was booed off the stage after an impromptu joke (eating a prop mouse) upset the audience and caused two female audience members to fight in the auditorium. The audience was also angry at Grimaldi's weak performance; later he felt that this marked the beginning of his career's decline. Dibdin left Sadler's Wells that year; his fortunes changed rapidly for the worse, and he spent time in a <a href="debtors%27%20prison">debtors' prison</a>. Grimaldi's debut as a theatre proprietor was also a failure. Although Jack Bologna, Mary, JS and Bologna's wife Louisa were all cast in Grimaldi's only commissioned pantomime, "The Fates; or, Harlequin's Holy Day", he had underestimated the amount of work required to run a theatre, and the strain of management hastened the already rapid deterioration in his health.

The shares in Sadler's Wells were sold, with Grimaldi's going to <a href="Daniel%20Egerton">Daniel Egerton</a>. Egerton wanted to keep Grimaldi on the payroll but proposed loaning him to other theatres. Grimaldi refused a contract on these terms and instead appeared alongside JS in a few engagements in Ireland. During the Easter season of 1820, Grimaldi appeared at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, in "Harlequin and Cinderella; or, the Little Glass Slipper". Grimaldi played the wife of the lead character Baron Pomposini; the role was probably an early example of a pantomime dame. In the latter months of 1820, Grimaldi's health worsened, and he suffered frequent emotional breakdowns, <a href="gastric">gastric</a> <a href="spasm">spasm</a>s, breathlessness and severe <a href="rheumatoid">rheumatoid</a> pain. These ailments did not affect his desire to perform. That September he appeared at Covent Garden, as Kasrac in "Aladdin" followed by the Christmas pantomime "Harlequin and Friar Bacon"; the pantomime was particularly successful.

In May 1821, Grimaldi collapsed after a performance of "Undine; or, the Spirit of the Waters". Doctors diagnosed him as suffering from "premature old age". JS took over his father's role and completed the remainder of the show's run. Now acting as an official <a href="understudy">understudy</a>, JS filled many of his father's other theatrical engagements, including a rerun of "Harlequin and Mother Bunch; or, the Yellow Dwarf", in which he caused a scandal by threatening and verbally abusing a heckler in the audience. In the early 1820s, Grimaldi made a brief recovery and held a six-week engagement at the <a href="The%20Old%20Vic">Coburg Theatre</a> where he appeared as Clown in "Salmagundi; or, the Clown's Dish of All Sorts"; a pantomime which ran for a week before being replaced by "Disputes in China; or, Harlequin and the Hong Merchants". Both productions were successful, but Grimaldi was taken ill half way through the latter's run.

In 1822, Grimaldi travelled to Cheltenham, in poor health, to fulfil an engagement as Clown by another actor in "Harlequin and the Ogress; or, the Sleeping Beauty in the Wood". Despite the rehearsals being cut short due to Grimaldi's rapidly deteriorating health, critics praised his performances.

Grimaldi retired from the stage in 1823 as a result of ill health. The years of extreme physical exertion his clowning had involved had taken a toll on his joints, and he suffered from a respiratory condition that often left him breathless. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" noted in 1813:
Although officially retired, Grimaldi still received half of his former small salary from Drury Lane until 1824. Soon after the fee stopped, Grimaldi fell into poverty after a number of ill-conceived business ventures and because he had entrusted management of his provincial earnings to people who cheated him. Despite his disabilities, he offered his services as a cameo performer in Christmas pantomimes. Along with Bologna, in 1827 he re-appeared briefly at Sadler's Wells where he gave some acting instruction to the <a href="mime%20artist">mime artist</a> <a href="William%20Payne%20%28pantomimist%29">William Payne</a>, the future father of the <a href="Payne%20Brothers">Payne Brothers</a>. He also started working for <a href="Richard%20Brinsley%20Peake">Richard Brinsley Peake</a>, <a href="namesake">namesake</a> of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who was the <a href="dramaturge">dramaturge</a> at the <a href="Lyceum%20Theatre%2C%20London">English Opera House</a>. Peake hired Grimaldi to star in "Monkey Island" alongside his son JS. However, Grimaldi's health deteriorated further and he was forced to quit before the show opened; his scene was cut. The early end to his career, worries about money, and the uncertainty over his son's future made him increasingly depressed. To make light of it, he would often joke about his condition: "I make you laugh at night but am Grim-all-day". In 1828, two "farewell" benefit performances were held for him. In the first, he appeared as Hock the German soldier and a drunken sailor in Thomas Dibdin's melodrama "The Sixes; or, The Fiends" at Sadler's Wells to an audience of 2,000 people. Unable to stand for long periods of time, he sang a duet with JS and finished the evening with a scene from "Mother Goose". His last farewell benefit performance on 27 June 1828 was at Drury Lane. Between 1828 and 1836, Grimaldi relied on charity benefits to replace his lost income.
The relationship between Grimaldi and his son first became strained during the early 1820s. JS, who had made a career of emulating his father's act, received favourable notices as Clown, but his success was constantly overshadowed by that of his father. He became resentful of his father and publicly shunned any association with him. JS became an alcoholic and was increasingly unreliable. In 1823, he became estranged from his parents, who saw their son only occasionally over the next four years, as JS went out of his way to avoid them. They communicated only through letters, with Grimaldi often sending his son notes begging for money. JS once replied: "At present I am in difficulties; but as long as I have a shilling you shall have half". However, there is no record of him ever sending money to his father. JS finally returned home in 1827, when the Grimaldis were awakened one night to discover their son standing in the street, feverish, emaciated and dishevelled.

After appearing in a few Christmas pantomimes and benefits for his father, JS fell into unemployment and was incarcerated in a debtors' prison for a time; his alcoholism also further worsened. In 1832, Grimaldi, Mary and their son moved to <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a>, but JS often abused his parents' hospitality by bringing home prostitutes and fighting in the house with his alcoholic friends. He moved out later that year and died at his lodgings on 11 December 1832, aged 30. With Grimaldi almost crippled, and Mary having suffered a stroke days before JS's death, they made a suicide pact. They took some poison, but the only result was a long bout of stomach cramps. Dismayed at their failure, they abandoned the idea of suicide.

Mary died in 1834, and Grimaldi moved to 33 Southampton Street, Islington, where he spent the last few years of his life alone as a depressed alcoholic. On 31 May 1837 he complained of a tightening of the chest but recuperated enough to attend his local public house, The Marquis of Cornwallis, where he spent a convivial evening entertaining fellow patrons and drinking to excess. He returned home that evening and was found dead in bed by his housekeeper the following morning. The coroner recorded that he had "died by the visitation of God". Grimaldi was buried in St. James's Churchyard, Pentonville, on 5 June 1837. The burial site and the area around it was later named <a href="Joseph%20Grimaldi%20Park">Joseph Grimaldi Park</a>.

After Grimaldi's death, <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> was invited by <a href="Richard%20Bentley%20%28publisher%29">Richard Bentley</a> to edit and improve Thomas Egerton Wilks's clumsily written life of Grimaldi, which had been based on the clown's own notes. As a child, Dickens saw Grimaldi perform at the Star Theatre, Rochester, in 1820. The "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20Joseph%20Grimaldi">Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi</a>" sold well, to Dickens's surprise.

Grimaldi's fame was established primarily by his numerous successes as Clown in pantomimes. His Clown satirised many aspects of contemporary British life, and made comic mockery of absurdities in fashion. Grimaldi quickly became the most famous Clown in London, gradually transforming the Clown character from a pratfalling country bumpkin into the most important character in the harlequinade, more important even than Harlequin. He expanded the role of Clown to include a range of comic impersonations, from the rival suitor, to household cook or nurse. Grimaldi's popularity changed the balance of the evening's entertainment, so that the first, relatively serious, section of the pantomime soon dwindled to "little more than a pretext for determining the characters who were to be transformed into those of the harlequinade." He became so dominant in the harlequinade that later Clowns were known as "Joey", and the term, as well as his make-up design, were later generalised to other types of clowns.

A contributor to "<a href="Bentley%27s%20Miscellany">Bentley's Miscellany</a>" wrote in 1846: "To those who never saw him, description is fruitless; to those who have, no praise comes up to their appreciation of him. We therefore shake our heads and say 'Ah! You should have seen Grimaldi!'" Another writer commented that his performances elevated his role by "acute observation upon the foibles and absurdities of society. ... He is the finest practical satyrist that ever existed. ... He was so extravagantly natural, that [no one was] ashamed to laugh till tears coursed down their cheeks at Joe and his comicalities." The British dramatist <a href="James%20Planch%C3%A9">James Planché</a> worried, in a rhymed couplet, that Grimaldi's death meant the end of a genre: "Pantomime's best days are fled; Grimaldi, Barnes, Bologna dead!"

Grimaldi became "easily the most popular English entertainer of his day". The <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> and the actor <a href="Simon%20Callow">Simon Callow</a> have both concluded that no other Clown achieved Grimaldi's level of fame. <a href="Richard%20Findlater">Richard Findlater</a>, author of a 1955 Grimaldi biography, commented: "Here is Joey the Clown, the first of 10,000 Joeys who took their name from him; here is the genius of English fun, in the holiday splendour of his reign at Sadler's Wells and Covent Garden ... during his lifetime [Grimaldi] was generally acclaimed as the funniest and best-loved man in the British theatre." A later biographer, Andrew McConnell Stott, wrote that "Joey had been the first great experiment in comic persona, and by shifting the emphasis of clowning from tricks and pratfalls to characterisation, satire and a full sense of personhood, he had established himself as the spiritual father of all those later comedians whose humour stems first and foremost from a strong sense of identity."

Grimaldi is remembered today in an annual memorial service on the first Sunday in February at <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Church%2C%20Dalston">Holy Trinity Church</a> in <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Hackney">Hackney</a>. The service, which has been held since the 1940s, attracts hundreds of clown performers from all over the world who attend the service in full clown costume. In 2010 a coffin-shaped musical memorial dedicated to Grimaldi, made of musical floor tiles, was installed in Joseph Grimaldi Park. The bronze tiles are tuned so that when danced upon it is possible to play "Hot Codlins".

Pod (The Breeders album)

Pod is the debut album by American <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="the%20Breeders">the Breeders</a>, released by <a href="4AD">4AD</a> records in May 1990. <a href="Audio%20engineer">Engineered</a> by <a href="Steve%20Albini">Steve Albini</a>, it features band leader <a href="Kim%20Deal">Kim Deal</a> on vocals and guitar, <a href="Josephine%20Wiggs">Josephine Wiggs</a> on bass, <a href="Britt%20Walford">Britt Walford</a> on drums, and <a href="Tanya%20Donelly">Tanya Donelly</a> on guitar. Albini's production prioritized sound over technical accomplishment; the final <a href="Take%23Music%20recording">takes</a> favor the band's spontaneous live "in studio" performances.

The Breeders formed in 1988 when Deal, bass player for <a href="Pixies%20%28band%29">the Pixies</a>, befriended Tanya Donelly of <a href="Throwing%20Muses">Throwing Muses</a> during a European tour. They recorded a <a href="country%20music">country</a>-infused <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demo</a> in 1989, leading to 4AD co-founder <a href="Ivo%20Watts-Russell">Ivo Watts-Russell</a> funding of an album, "Pod", recorded that year at the Palladium studio in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Due in part to Deal's work with the Pixies, the album was widely anticipated, particularly in Europe. It became a critical and popular success, reaching number 22 in the UK. Critics praised its dark, sexualized lyrics, and compared it favorably to the Pixies. <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>'s <a href="Kurt%20Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a> said it was one of his favorite records, and "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" ranked it number 81 on its list of the best albums of the 1990s. The cover art was designed by <a href="Vaughan%20Oliver">Vaughan Oliver</a>, and portrays a man performing a fertility dance while wearing a belt of eels.

In 1988, <a href="Kim%20Deal">Kim Deal</a> of <a href="Pixies%20%28band%29">the Pixies</a> became friends with <a href="Tanya%20Donelly">Tanya Donelly</a> of <a href="Throwing%20Muses">Throwing Muses</a> when their respective bands undertook a joint tour of Europe. Deal and Donelly spent time together playing guitar, drinking beer and sharing musical ideas. They often went clubbing together in the bands' hometown of Boston. While attending a <a href="The%20Sugarcubes">Sugarcubes</a> concert, the two drunkenly decided to write and record dance songs. Their first attempt to work together was based around the idea of an "organic dance band" consisting of Deal on bass, Donelly on guitar, and two drummers. They recorded Donelly's "Rise" with Throwing Muses' <a href="David%20Narcizo">David Narcizo</a>, and planned more originals, as well as a <a href="Cover%20version">cover</a> of <a href="Rufus%20%28band%29">Rufus and Chaka Khan</a>'s "<a href="Tell%20Me%20Something%20Good">Tell Me Something Good</a>".

A year and a half passed without the pair recording new material. During this time, they decided their attempt at dance music was not working, and resolved to repurpose their songs for a different genre. Deal became more serious about her work with Donnelly when the Pixies' <a href="Black%20Francis">Black Francis</a> announced he was undertaking a solo tour. She decided that if he could be active outside of the Pixies, then she could too.

Some journalists have speculated that one of Deal's motivations for forming a new band with Donelly was her diminishing role and lack of creative outlet in the Pixies. Deal has often denied this as a reason, but in one interview complained angrily of Francis’ singing almost all of the songs, saying that if she could not sing in the Pixies, she would sing in another band instead. Pixies' guitarist <a href="Joey%20Santiago">Joey Santiago</a> recalls Deal having a strong desire to contribute songs to the group to express her creativity, but eventually resigning herself to accepting Francis as the band's sole singer and songwriter. Francis has recounted that Deal once presented some songs for consideration to the group, but consensus among other members was that the compositions were too different from the sound of the Pixies' repertoire.

Because the Pixies and Throwing Muses were signed to different American record labels, Deal and Donelly could not both be principal songwriters for their joint project. They focused on Deal's compositions for what would become "Pod", intending to use Donelly's songs for a subsequent album. After "Pod"s release, Deal and Donelly recorded a demo of the latter's songs in preparation for the Breeders' second album. Donelly left the group in 1991, and used her compositions for her new band, <a href="Belly%20%28band%29">Belly</a>. Before parting, she contributed guitar and vocals to the Breeders' 1992 "<a href="Safari%20%28EP%29">Safari</a>" EP, although none of her compositions appear on the record.

In 1989 the pair recorded a <a href="country%20music">country music</a>-influenced <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demo</a> with violinist <a href="Carrie%20Bradley">Carrie Bradley</a> and bassist Ray Holiday. <a href="Paul%20Q.%20Kolderie">Paul Kolderie</a> engineered several of the songs, but Deal found his production "too clean" and employed Joe Harvard of <a href="Fort%20Apache%20Studios">Fort Apache Studios</a> to remix. Deal called the project "the Breeders", a name she and her sister <a href="Kelley%20Deal">Kelley</a> had used when performing as teenagers. The name comes from a slang term used in the LGBT community to refer to straight people, which Kim found amusing. <a href="Ivo%20Watts-Russell">Ivo Watts-Russell</a>, co-founder of the Pixies' and Throwing Muses' UK label <a href="4AD">4AD</a>, was enthusiastic about the demo and Deal's potential as a songwriter, and gave the band an advance of $11,000 to record an album.

Although Deal played bass with the Pixies, she changed to guitar for the Breeders, finding it an easier instrument to manage while singing, and so recruited <a href="Josephine%20Wiggs">Josephine Wiggs</a> of <a href="the%20Perfect%20Disaster">the Perfect Disaster</a> on bass. Deal asked <a href="Steve%20Albini">Steve Albini</a>, who had worked on the Pixies' "<a href="Surfer%20Rosa">Surfer Rosa</a>", to engineer the album. Deal thought it would be fun to form an all-female band, "[like] <a href="the%20Bangles">the Bangles</a> from Hell". She wanted Kelley to be the Breeders' drummer, but Kelley could not get time away from her job as a <a href="Program%20analysis">program analyst</a>. As an alternative, Albini suggested they try <a href="Slint">Slint</a>'s <a href="Britt%20Walford">Britt Walford</a>, who used the pseudonym Shannon Daughton for "Pod" because he did not want his contribution to the album to overshadow his role in Slint. Deal, Wiggs, and Walford rehearsed for a week at Wiggs' house in <a href="Bedfordshire">Bedfordshire</a>, England, before joining Donelly in London for further rehearsals.

"Pod" was recorded in January 1990 at Palladium studio, in Edinburgh, Scotland, which had a recording studio on the first floor and bedrooms on the second. During the sessions, the band sometimes wore pajamas, and more than once went to a local pub without changing. Although 4AD booked the studio for two weeks, the band completed their recording in a single week. To utilize the remaining time, the label hired a television crew to film a music video, and the band recorded a session for <a href="John%20Peel">John Peel</a>'s show on <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a>.

Albini—who has worked on thousands of recordings including albums by <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>, <a href="Page%20and%20Plant">Page and Plant</a>, and <a href="PJ%20Harvey">PJ Harvey</a>—describes his role as more technical than artistic, and prefers to be described as an engineer rather than producer. He has a preference for analogue recording techniques, and is noted for his careful placement of microphones in the studio to achieve a nuanced "roomy" sound. Further, in Albini's ethical approach to recording and to the mechanics of the music industry, he makes a point of not attempting to influence the band's song arrangements. He is known for his vocal and dim view of the music industry, and the press often depicts him as not easy to work with. He has also sometimes had a reputation for being <a href="Misogyny">misogynist</a>, in part from the name of his former band <a href="Rapeman">Rapeman</a>.

Despite his reputation, Donelly recalls being especially comfortable working with Albini, whom she found "sweet". Wiggs and Donelly have both commented that although Albini often downplays his degree of influence on an album's quality, for "Pod" his contributions were considerable. Donelly has praised Albini for the input that he gave the band prior to recording. This included convincing the band to reduce the number of vocal harmonies and give more prominence to Deal's vocals. Donelly believes the removal of harmonies made the performances "more effective and sadder and ... focused". Albini paid attention to capturing strong live performances in the studio. His main concern was achieving the best sound, rather than seeking the best technical performances.

Albini had a policy of never doing more than two <a href="Take%23Music%20recording">takes</a> of each song. This led to confrontations with Donelly, who remembers: "For all the fights we had with him in the studio, for all the times I'd stomp upstairs in my pajamas screaming that I couldn't live with such-and-such a guitar part, the next morning I realized he was usually right." Deal also often fought with Albini. Wiggs was struck with how quickly Albini and the other musicians resolved issues through short, intense arguments, an ability she attributed to their being American. Albini saw Walford's drumming as an integral part of the band's sound. Then 19 years old, Walford was a confident and "hard-hitting" drummer who typically played one of his drums behind the beat. Song tempos were faster than Wiggs had expected, which arose in part because Deal lacked the <a href="Vocal%20pedagogy%23Breathing%20and%20breath%20support">breath control</a> to sing her lines in a slower manner.

"Pod" has sparse instrumentation. Music critic <a href="Colin%20Larkin%20%28writer%29">Colin Larkin</a> likened the album to the Pixies for its threatening melodies and loud, resounding guitars. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" Karen Schoemer also found similarities to the Pixies, citing "Pod"s "angular melodies, shattered tempos and screeching dynamics", but felt the album nonetheless had its own identity distinct from Deal's previous band. Unlike the demo, the album does not have a country-influenced sound.

Other writers have noted the album's sinister, sexual and youthful feel. Matt LeMay of "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" wrote that Deal's singing is spooky, and evokes a <a href="Siren%20%28mythology%29">mythical siren</a> or a young girl hiding a weapon. "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>"s Ted Mico compared the tone of the songs to the innocent-looking girl in "<a href="Poltergeist%20%281982%20film%29">Poltergeist</a>" who dribbles blood. Albini said that "there was a simultaneous charm to Kim's presentation to her music that's both childlike and giddy and also completely mature and kind of dirty ... [it had a] sort of girlish fascination with things that were pretty but it was also kind of horny. That was a juxtaposition that, at the time, was unusual. You didn't get a lot of knowing winks from female artists at the time."

Deal has said that many of the songs are sexual in nature. The slow-paced opening track "Glorious", describes an adult who has vague but pleasant memories of being molested as a child by an aunt. It and the next song, "Doe", were co-written by Ray Halliday. "Doe" concerns a schizophrenic teenage couple losing their grip of reality after taking <a href="Chlorpromazine">Thorazine</a>; in a delusional state they plan to burn down their town. LeMay described this track as possessing a beautiful, gripping quality, while "<a href="NME">NME</a>"s Steve Lamacq cited it as an example of using reduced instrumentation to good effect ("stripped down but punchy").

Larkin believes that the band's cover of <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>' "<a href="Happiness%20Is%20a%20Warm%20Gun">Happiness Is a Warm Gun</a>" achieves a friction that the original only hints at, and Lamacq commented on its tight sound and prominent drum part. The Breeders recorded the song at the suggestion of Watts-Russell. "Oh!" has—according to writer Martin Aston—a slow tempo, restrained drumming, a sad violin performance by Carrie Bradley, and unexpectedly raw singing by Deal. She had planned to use the title "The Insect Song" because its lyrics tell the story of one insect encouraging others, hoping they do not get stepped on.

Deal has said that "Hellbound" described a fetus that survives an abortion, and that the song is "kinda like a heavy metal hymnal, 'We're all hellbound." She cited the line "It lives, despite the knives internal" as containing the most embarrassing lyrics she has written. Before recording, the other band members teased her about the line, but since she could not think of a better alternative, she kept the phrase but mumbled the line to make the words harder to understand. For Sasha Alcott, writing for the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>", the song contains elements of "fierce head-banging <a href="Sing-along">sing-a-long</a>" as well as gentle whimsy. About "When I Was a Painter", the next track, Lamacq was struck by Deal's gruff vocals and praised its stop-start guitar riff. Critic <a href="Rob%20Sheffield">Rob Sheffield</a> named the song as a highlight of the album in the "<a href="Spin%20Alternative%20Record%20Guide">Spin Alternative Record Guide</a>", and Piers Clifton interpreted it as being about strange or otherwise unsatisfying sex.

Side 2 of the <a href="LP%20record">LP</a> version starts with "Fortunately Gone", which Lamacq described as an appealing pop-flavored opening for the album's second half. Deal had originally practiced the song with Kelley several years previously. The lyrics concern a woman who has died but continues to obsessively watch over her lover, not able to give him up, even after death. "Iris" was interpreted by Larkin and critic Wif Stenger as being about menstruation. In a 1990 interview, Deal said the song related to something "like a pea pod flowering and then getting ripe and stinky", and connected it to the <a href="Surrealism">Surrealists</a>' "associat[ing] women with fish". The writer <a href="Simon%20Reynolds">Simon Reynolds</a> described Deal's wolfish, staccato delivery of the repeated word "Oh!", as well as the "little gashes of gruelling, groiny feedback".

A recurring sexual dream of Walford's inspired the lyrics of "Opened". The track features a buoyant rhythm and was described by Stenger as exhilaratingly bringing the listener somewhere between reality and the supernatural. "Only in 3s", which Deal wrote with Donelly, is about a "<a href="m%C3%A9nage%20%C3%A0%20trois">ménage à trois</a>" sexual relationship. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Heather Phares characterized the recording as "sensual" and said that it was more benign and friendly-sounding than the Pixies.

"Lime House" was described in a "Billboard" review as feeling "avant-garage". The song concerns <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> spending long and comfortable hours in an <a href="opium%20den">opium den</a>. Wiggs co-wrote and played <a href="Flamenco%20guitar">Spanish guitar</a> on the final track, "Metal Man". The song contains harmonies between her and Deal; Wiggs' spoken vocals were compared by Stenger to those of the group <a href="Wire%20%28band%29">Wire</a> and by Reynolds to the vocal style of <a href="Sonic%20Youth">Sonic Youth</a>'s <a href="Kim%20Gordon">Kim Gordon</a>. Aston likened the melody to the Pixies' "<a href="Cactus%20%28Pixies%20song%29">Cactus</a>".

"Pod" was released in the UK on May 29, 1990 by 4AD. Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' "<a href="Bossanova%20%28Pixies%20album%29">Bossanova</a>" two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums. Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed "Pod" to <a href="Rough%20Trade%20Records">Rough Trade America</a>. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of "Pod" in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.

The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in "Melody Maker", and number 73 in the Netherlands. "Pod" sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it "never sold [anything]" compared to their next album, "<a href="Last%20Splash">Last Splash</a>" (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.

Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word "pod" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer <a href="Vaughan%20Oliver">Vaughan Oliver</a> and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long <a href="Exposure%20%28photography%29">exposure</a> to achieve the blurring and other visual effects.

The album was generally well received. Several music critics favorably compared the album to Deal's work with the Pixies, among which were William Van Meter, Rob Sheffield, and Steve Kandell of "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>". Kandell and Sheffield mentioned tracks including "Fortunately Gone" as superior to songs by that group. Kandell noted "Pod" appealed to fans of the Pixies' "<a href="Gigantic%20%28song%29">Gigantic</a>", which was written and sung by Deal. In AllMusic, Heather Phares described "Pod" as a "vibrantly creative debut" that was better than the Pixies' 1990 album "Bossanova", and argued that the Pixies should have recorded more of Deal's compositions.

"The Rough Guide to Rock"s Piers Clifton and "Melody Maker"s Simon Reynolds viewed "Pod" as lacking energy in comparison to the Pixies' work. To Clifton, it was "plodding", while Reynolds felt it sounded "inhibited, moribund, stilted" and "never [let] it rip like the Pixies". Reynolds added that "Whenever a song gathers momentum or thrust, [the Breeders] throw in a weird bit, a gear change or an abrupt stop. They seem unhappy with the idea of simple rock exuberance." Steve Taylor of "The A to X of Alternative Music" also found "Pod" inferior to music of the Pixies, but was impressed with Deal's ability to move from bass to guitar.

Some reviews found "Pod" under-developed or insubstantial. Jon Dolan in "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" likened it to a poorly-constructed building. <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" described it unfavorably as more "art project" than the work of a band, and <a href="Greg%20Sandow">Greg Sandow</a> in "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" felt the lyrics were sometimes forced.

Wif Stenger of "Trouser Press" called the first side "a bit shaky" but considered side 2 to be "damn near perfect". "NME"s <a href="Steve%20Lamacq">Steve Lamacq</a> described the album as "a tight-ish piece of tantalising rock", and said that listeners who found it too minimalist would soon warm to it. Karen Schoemer of "The New York Times" praised "Pod"s intelligence and originality.

Nirvana singer <a href="Kurt%20Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a> often described "Pod" as one of his favorite albums. He listed it as his seventh and then third favorite album in his private <a href="Journals%20%28Cobain%29">journals</a>, and said it was his number-one favorite album in a 1992 "Melody Maker" article, in which he said: "The way they structure [the songs is] totally unique, very atmospheric." Cobain had wished to work with Steve Albini since first listening to his band <a href="Big%20Black">Big Black</a> in the 1980s. Cobain's special admiration of "Pod" and "Surfer Rosa"—as well as his desire for a similar drum sound, a "natural, powerful sound produced with canny microphone placement rather than phony sounding effects boxes", that he found reminiscent of <a href="Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>'s "<a href="Rocks%20%28Aerosmith%20album%29">Rocks</a>"—then led him to select Albini as the producer of Nirvana's third studio album, "<a href="In%20Utero%20%28album%29">In Utero</a>". "Pod" also influenced <a href="Courtney%20Love">Courtney Love</a>'s songwriting on "<a href="Live%20Through%20This">Live Through This</a>", the second album by her band <a href="Hole%20%28band%29">Hole</a>. In 2018 critic <a href="Amanda%20Petrusich">Amanda Petrusich</a> noted the enduring influence of "Pod" on contemporary indie rock musicians <a href="Courtney%20Barnett">Courtney Barnett</a>, <a href="Lucy%20Dacus">Lucy Dacus</a>, and <a href="Julien%20Baker">Julien Baker</a>.

In 2007 Albini said he felt "Pod" was among the best albums he had engineered; a 2015 article in "<a href="Stereogum">Stereogum</a>" ranked it as Albini's eighth best album. Donelly described it as the "truest" of her albums and said that "it really feels exactly the way it was when we were doing it." Wiggs has spoken of her ongoing fondness for "Pod", and recalls that everyone in the making of the album was dedicated and attentive. In 2003 "Pitchfork" placed the album as the 81st best of the 1990s. It was ranked number 463 in "NME"s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list (2013) and included in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"s 1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die (2007). Separate articles in both publications have ranked the Breeders' version of "Happiness Is a Warm Gun" among the best covers of a Beatles song.

Sea mink

The sea mink ("Neovison macrodon") is a <a href="list%20of%20recently%20extinct%20mammals">recently extinct</a> species of <a href="mink">mink</a> that lived on the eastern coast of North America in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Mustelidae">Mustelidae</a>, the largest family in the <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> <a href="Carnivora">Carnivora</a>. It was most closely related to the <a href="American%20mink">American mink</a> ("Neovison vison"), with debate about whether or not the sea mink should be considered a subspecies of the American mink (making it "Neovison vison macrodon") or a species of its own. The main justification for a separate species designation is the size difference between the two minks, but other distinctions have been made, such as its redder fur. The only known remains are fragments unearthed in Native American <a href="shell%20midden">shell midden</a>s. Its actual size is speculative, based largely on tooth-remains.

The sea mink was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> in 1903, after its <a href="extinction">extinction</a>; information regarding its external appearance and habits stem from speculation and from accounts made by <a href="fur%20trade">fur trade</a>rs and Native Americans. It may have exhibited behavior similar to the American mink, in that it probably maintained <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">home ranges</a>, was <a href="polygynandrous">polygynandrous</a>, and had a similar diet, though more seaward-oriented. It was probably found on the <a href="New%20England">New England</a> coast and the <a href="The%20Maritimes">Maritime Provinces</a>, though its range may have stretched further south during the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a>. Conversely, its range may have been restricted solely to the New England coast, specifically the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Maine">Gulf of Maine</a>, or just to nearby islands. The largest of the minks, the sea mink was more desirable to fur traders and became extinct in the late 19th or early 20th century.

The sea mink was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> as "Lutreola macrodon", <a href="Speciation">distinct</a> from the American mink, by , a medical doctor and <a href="ornithologist">ornithologist</a>, in 1903 after it became <a href="extinct">extinct</a>. Prentiss based his description on skull fragments recovered from Native American <a href="shell%20midden">shell midden</a>s in <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. Most sea mink remains, nearly all of them skull fragments, have come from shell middens, but a complete specimen has never been found.

Debate has occurred regarding whether the sea mink was its own <a href="species">species</a>, or a subspecies of the <a href="American%20mink">American mink</a>. Those who argue that the sea mink was a subspecies often refer to it as "Neovison vison macrodon". A study in 1911 by <a href="Frederic%20Brewster%20Loomis">Frederic Brewster Loomis</a>, an American <a href="paleontologist">paleontologist</a>, concluded that the differences between the American mink and the sea mink were too minute to justify the latter's classification as a separate species, and he named it "Lutreola vison antiquus". A study conducted in 2000 by Mead et al. refuted Loomis by claiming that the size range for the largest sea mink specimen was beyond that of the American mink, thereby making it a separate species. But a 2001 study by Graham concluded that this size difference was insufficient evidence to classify the sea mink as its own species and that it should be considered a subspecies. Graham supposed that the size difference was caused by environmental factors. Furthermore, Graham reported that Mead assumed the smaller mink specimens to be the American mink, and the larger mink specimens outside the range of the American mink to be sea minks; this may have been a case of <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> wherein all specimens were sea minks, the larger being male and the smaller being female. A 2007 study compared the dental makeup of the sea mink to the American mink, and concluded that they were distinct enough to be considered separate species.

The taxonomy of minks was revised in 2000, resulting in the formation of a new <a href="genus">genus</a>, "<a href="Neovison">Neovison</a>", which includes only the sea mink and the American mink. Formerly, both minks were classified in the genus "<a href="Mustela">Mustela</a>". The species name "macrodon" translates to "large teeth". According to Richard Manville, a naturalist who maintains that the sea mink is not its own species, its closest relative is the common mink ("N. v. mink"), which also inhabits the New England area.

<a href="Fur%20trade">Fur trade</a>rs who hunted it gave the sea mink various names, including water marten, red otter, and fisher cat. Possibly the first description of this species was made by Sir <a href="Humphrey%20Gilbert">Humphrey Gilbert</a>
in the late 1500s as "a fish like a <a href="greyhound">greyhound</a>", which was a reference to its affinity for the sea and its body shape and gait, which were apparently similar to that of a greyhound. It is possible that the <a href="fisher%20%28animal%29">fisher</a> ("Pekania pennanti") got its name from being mistakenly identified as the sea mink, which was also known as the fisher by fur traders. The <a href="Abnaki">Abnaki</a> Indians referred to it as the "mousebeysoo", which means "wet thing". It was named "sea mink" because it was always found near the coast by fur traders, and subsequently the American mink was often referred to as the "wood mink".

The sea mink was a <a href="marine%20mammal">marine mammal</a> that lived around the rocky coasts of New England and the southernmost <a href="The%20Maritimes">Maritime Provinces</a> until hunted to extinction in the late 19th century. Most sea mink remains are unearthed on the coast of Maine. Though it is speculated that they at one point inhabited <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> and <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>, they were commonly trapped along the coast of the <a href="Bay%20of%20Fundy">Bay of Fundy</a> (in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Maine">Gulf of Maine</a>), and it is said that they formerly existed on the southwestern coast of <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>. There were reports of unusually large mink furs being collected from Nova Scotia regularly. The bones of a specimen unearthed in <a href="Middleboro%2C%20Massachusetts">Middleboro, Massachusetts</a>, were <a href="radio-carbon%20dating">dated</a> to be around 4,300±300 years old, from salt water. The sea mink may have reached that area by traveling up rivers, or may have been brought there by Native Americans. The latter is most likely as no other mink remains have been discovered between <a href="Casco%20Bay">Casco Bay</a> in Maine and southeastern <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. Sea mink bones have been unearthed in Canada, although these may have been carried there by Native Americans from the Gulf of Maine. The rugged shorelines of the <a href="Down%20East">Down East</a> region of Maine may have represented a northernmost barrier in their range. Mead concluded that only American minks inhabited the mainland and that sea minks were restricted to islands off the coast. If this is the case, then all remains found on the mainland were carried there. Graham challenged that hypothesis, stating that it is unlikely that all sea mink specimens originate from one population.

During the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a>, ending 12,000 years ago, the sea mink's range may have extended south of the Gulf of Maine. It may have even evolved there, as Maine at that time would have been covered in glaciers, although the oldest known specimen only dates back to around 5,000 years; this could be due to the rising sea levels—older sea mink remains may be submerged underwater. Alternately, the sea mink may have evolved after the last glacial period and filled a new <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>.

Since the sea mink has only been described by fragmentary remains, its appearance and behaviors are not well-documented. Its relatives, as well as descriptions by fur traders and Native Americans, give a general idea of this animal's appearance and its ecological roles. Accounts from Native Americans in the New England/Atlantic Canadian regions reported that the sea mink had a fatter body than the American mink. The sea mink produced a distinctive fishy odor, and had fur that was said to be coarser and redder than that of the American mink. It is thought that <a href="naturalist">naturalist</a> <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Joseph Banks</a> encountered this animal in 1776 in the <a href="Strait%20of%20Belle%20Isle">Strait of Belle Isle</a>, and he described it as being slightly larger than a fox, having long legs, and a tail that was long and tapered towards the end, similar to a greyhound.

The sea mink was the largest of the minks. As only fragmentary skeletal remains of the sea mink exist, most of its external measurements are speculative and rely only on dental measurements. In 1929, <a href="Ernest%20Thompson%20Seton">Ernest Thompson Seton</a>, a wildlife artist, concluded that the probable dimensions for this animal are from head to tail, with the tail being long. A possible mounted sea mink specimen collected in 1894 in Connecticut measured from head to tail and the tail was in length; a 1996 study found this to be either a large American mink or possibly a <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrid</a>. The specimen was described as having coarse fur that was reddish-tan in color, though much of it was likely faded from age. It was darkest at the tail and the hind limbs, with a white patch between the forearms. There were also white spots on the left forearm and the groin region.
The <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type specimen</a> was collected by Prentiss and <a href="Frederick%20W.%20True">Frederick True</a>, a biologist, in 1897 in <a href="Brooklin%2C%20Maine">Brooklin, Maine</a>, the remains of which consist of a <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a>, parts of the <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a>, and the <a href="palate">palate</a>. The teeth are all present on the right side of the palate, and the left side consists of the incisors and one premolar. Other than a chipped canine, all the teeth are in good condition. The specimen is apparently larger than the Alaskan mink, as the average distance between the last incisor to the first molar is in the Alaskan mink, whereas that distance is in the type specimen. The nasal bone has an abrupter ascension, and the <a href="carnassial">carnassial</a> teeth make a more acute angle with the gums than those of the common mink.

These minks were large and heavily built, with a low <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a> and short, wide <a href="postorbital%20process">postorbital process</a>es (<a href="process%20%28anatomy%29">projections</a> on the <a href="frontal%20bone">frontal bone</a> behind the <a href="eye%20socket">eye socket</a>s). In fact, the most notable characteristic of the skull was its size, in that it was clearly larger than that of other mink species, having a wide <a href="rostrum%20%28anatomy%29">rostrum</a>, large <a href="anterior%20nares">nostril openings</a>, large <a href="antorbital%20fenestra">antorbital fenestra</a>e (openings in the skull in front of the eye socket), and large teeth. Their large size was probably in response to their coastal environment, as the largest extant subspecies of American mink, the Alaskan mink ("N. v. nesolestes"), inhabits the <a href="Alexander%20Archipelago">Alexander Archipelago</a> in Alaska, an area with a <a href="habitat">habitat</a> similar to the Gulf of Maine. Mead, concluding that the mink was restricted to nearshore islands, suggested that the large size was due to <a href="insular%20gigantism">insular gigantism</a>. Since almost all members of the subfamily <a href="Mustelinae">Mustelinae</a> exhibit sexual dimorphism, male sea minks were probably larger than female sea minks. The sea mink's wider carnassial teeth and blunter carnassial blades suggest that they crushed hard shells more often than did the teeth of the American mink.

As marine mammal species often play a large part in their ecosystems, it is possible that the sea mink was an important <a href="intertidal%20zone">intertidal</a> predator. It may have been similar in diet to the American mink, and may have consumed seabirds, seabird eggs, and hard-bodied marine invertebrates, though in greater proportions. Fur traders reported that sea mink dens had two entrances, and were made in the rocks piled up by the <a href="Breaking%20wave">waves</a>. Remains of <a href="Longhorn%20sculpin">toad sculpin</a>s and <a href="ocean%20pout">ocean pout</a> were the most common around their dens, and <a href="garden%20banded%20snail">garden banded snail</a>s were also reported to have been part of their diet. Their seafood-oriented diet may have increased their size. According to fur traders, the sea mink was <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a> and resided in caves and rock crevices during the day. Due to the overlap of American mink and sea mink ranges, it is possible that they hybridized with each other. Although not a truly marine species, being confined to coastal waters, the sea mink was unusually aquatic compared to other members of <a href="Musteloidea">Musteloidea</a>, being, next to <a href="otter">otter</a>s, the most aquatic member of the <a href="taxon">taxon</a>.

Like other minks, individual sea minks may have maintained <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">home ranges</a>, and, since the males were larger and required more food, males would have had larger territorial claims. Likewise, their larger size may have allowed the males to target larger prey than the females, and they may have had to defend females during mating seasons. Like other weasels, the sea mink was probably <a href="polygynandrous">polygynandrous</a>, with both sexes mating with multiple individuals.

The sea mink was pursued by fur traders due to its large size; this made it more desirable than other mink species further inland. The unregulated trade eventually led to its extinction, which is thought to have occurred between 1860 and 1920. The sea mink was seldom sighted after 1860. The last two recorded kills of a sea mink were made in Maine in 1880 near <a href="Jonesport%2C%20Maine">Jonesport, Maine</a>, and <a href="Campobello%20Island%2C%20New%20Brunswick">Campobello Island, New Brunswick</a> in 1894, although the 1894 kill is speculated to be of large American minks. Fur traders made traps to catch sea minks and also pursued them with dogs, although they were rarely trapped. If a sea mink escaped into a small hole on the rocky ledges, it was dug out by hunters using shovels and crowbars. If it was out of reach of the hunters, it was shot and then retrieved using an iron rod with a screw on the far end. If it was hiding, it was smoked out and suffocated. The minks' nocturnal behavior may have been caused from pressure by fur traders who hunted them in daylight.

Since the remains of brain cases found in shell middens are broken and many of the bones found exhibit cut marks, it is assumed that the sea mink was hunted by Native Americans for food, and possibly for exchange and ceremonial purposes. One study looking at the remains in shell middens in <a href="Penobscot%20Bay">Penobscot Bay</a> reported that sea mink craniums were intact, more so than that of other animals found, implying that they were specifically placed there. Males were more often collected than females.

Archie MacLaren

Archibald Campbell MacLaren (1 December 1871 – 17 November 1944) was an English <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er who captained the <a href="English%20cricket%20team">England cricket team</a> at various times between 1898 and 1909. A right-handed <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29">batsman</a>, he played 35 <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> for England, as captain in 22 of those games, and led the team to defeat in four <a href="The%20Ashes">Ashes</a> series against Australia. An <a href="Amateur%20status%20in%20first-class%20cricket">amateur</a>, MacLaren played <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> for <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a>, captaining that county for most of his career. As a batsman, MacLaren was one of the leading cricketers of his time and had a reputation as a fast-scoring stylist. In 1895, he scored 424 runs in an <a href="Innings%23Cricket">innings</a> against <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a> which was the highest individual score in first-class cricket until 1923 and remained a record in English cricket until 1994. Opinions were divided over his captaincy. He was a deep thinker on the game and critics believed him to be tactically advanced, but his pessimism, clashes with the selectors and inability to get the best out of his players led most commentators to rate him a poor leader.

After attending <a href="Public%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">public school</a>, MacLaren played intermittently for Lancashire until 1899 as he tried to establish a career outside the sport. Even so, he was appointed county captain in 1894 and was chosen frequently to play for England. An appointment as Lancashire's assistant secretary allowed him to play more regularly from 1900. He first captained England in 1898 as a stand-in, but became captain in his own right in 1899. Under his leadership, England lost to Australia in three consecutive series—1899, 1901–02 and 1902. MacLaren was involved in controversies throughout all three defeats, and was replaced as captain in 1905, although he remained in the team. Business interests kept him out of the game for the following years, but he was invited to lead England once more in 1909. Defeat in that series ended his Test career, and the following year he ceased playing regular first-class cricket. He played occasionally until 1922–23, and had some late successes: in 1921, a team selected and captained by MacLaren defeated a previously unbeaten Australian team, and on his final first-class appearance during a 1922–23 <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> tour of New Zealand, he scored 200 runs.

MacLaren had many jobs as he attempted to find ways to support his cricket, family and lifestyle. At various times, he worked as a teacher, a journalist and a cricket coach. For many years, he was employed as Lancashire's assistant secretary but such were his financial worries that he often had to ask for cash advances from the committee, with which he had a stormy relationship. He worked for several years as private secretary to <a href="K.%20S.%20Ranjitsinhji">K. S. Ranjitsinhji</a> and he became involved in his employer's financial scandals. Many of MacLaren's later business ventures were failures, and only when his wife came into an inheritance did he and his family live in comfort. Throughout his life, MacLaren was involved in many disagreements and was never popular with teammates. However, he was a hero to the cricket writer <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a>, who wrote prolifically on him. MacLaren died in 1944, aged 72.

MacLaren was born on 1 December 1871 in <a href="Whalley%20Range%2C%20Manchester">Whalley Range</a>, a fairly prosperous district of <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, the second of seven sons to James MacLaren and Emily Carver. His father, a cotton merchant and cricket enthusiast, served as honorary treasurer to <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">the Lancashire team</a> from 1881 until his death in 1900. MacLaren senior encouraged his sons to play cricket. With the aim of improving their ability in the game, MacLaren senior sent Archie and his older brother <a href="James%20MacLaren%20%28cricketer%29">James</a> to <a href="Elstree%20School">Elstree</a>, a school well-regarded for its coaching.

MacLaren's cricket instruction was supplemented during the holidays at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford Cricket Ground</a>, where his father paid professional cricketers to <a href="Bowling%20%28cricket%29">bowl</a> at him. He was soon selected for the school's cricket team, scored his first <a href="Century%20%28cricket%29">century</a>, and was the captain by his final year. From Elstree, MacLaren went to <a href="Harrow%20School">Harrow School</a> in 1886 where he joined James; <a href="Geoffrey%20MacLaren">Geoffrey</a>, their younger brother, followed them but financial difficulties prevented any other family members attending the school. MacLaren had little success in intra-school cricket during his first year there but in 1887, success in trial games resulted in his promotion to the school <a href="First%2011">first eleven</a>. A century in an early match ensured his selection for the important fixture against <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a> at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>. Although an inexperienced Harrow team was easily defeated, MacLaren top-scored in both <a href="Innings%23Cricket">innings</a> with scores of 55 and 67, and in praising his batting, critics suggested he had a bright future. He came top of the school <a href="Batting%20average%23Cricket">batting averages</a> for the 1887 season.

Wet weather in the following two years affected playing conditions, making the <a href="cricket%20pitch">cricket pitch</a>es slow-paced and difficult to bat on. With little experience of such conditions, MacLaren had a succession of failures. His technique, based at the time on playing <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Forward%20and%20back">forward at the ball</a>, was unsuited to wet pitches and it was only late in 1889 that he made the required technical adjustments and learned to play off the back foot (i.e. stepping backwards to play a shot). During 1890, his final year at Harrow, he captained the team and had his most successful season, scoring over 500 <a href="Run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> at an average of 42.54. In the match against Eton at Lord's, MacLaren once more succeeded when others struggled, and he scored 76 on a difficult pitch. In his four years at Harrow, MacLaren was twice awarded the prize for the school's best batsman, and received awards for his fielding. MacLaren also played <a href="Association%20football">football</a> successfully: he captained his <a href="House%20system">House team</a> and played in the school first eleven in 1888 and 1889 before a knee injury forced him to miss the 1890 season. Unlike many of his fellow <a href="Amateur%20status%20in%20first-class%20cricket">amateur cricketers</a> in this period, MacLaren did not attend <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford</a> or <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge</a> Universities, where he would have played a high level of cricket; his father could not afford to send him or his brothers there. On leaving Harrow, MacLaren found employment with the <a href="District%20Bank">Manchester and Liverpool District Bank</a>.

Lancashire monitored MacLaren's progress during his time at Harrow. When his season there ended in 1890, he was selected to play for Lancashire in the <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a>. Making his <a href="First-class%20cricket">first-class</a> debut on 14 August 1890 in a match against <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a>, he scored 108 runs on a difficult pitch in a relatively fast time of two hours. Although less successful in the remaining games of the season, he finished fourth in the Lancashire averages with 140 runs at an average of 23.33. MacLaren's financial circumstances forced him to keep working at the District Bank, limiting the amount of cricket he played in 1891 and 1892.

When he did play for Lancashire, MacLaren was moderately successful. He led the county's batting averages in 1892 and in total scored 548 runs at 27.40. Of his two centuries, the second came when he <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Opening%20batsmen">opened the batting</a>. During the winter of 1892–93, MacLaren studied cotton manufacture in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>; when he returned home, he played more regularly for Lancashire. He scored consistently in 1893, totalling 831 runs at 25.18, had success in the high-profile match against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>, and led the team in the absence of the regular captain. As a result of his successes, he was selected to play for the North of England in a representative match against the <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australian</a> team who were touring England that year. He scored 66, sharing an <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Opening%20batsmen">opening partnership</a> of 121 in 80 minutes with his county colleague <a href="Albert%20Ward%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201865%29">Albert Ward</a>. Later in the season, he was chosen to play for the amateur "Gentlemen" team in the prestigious <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">Gentlemen v Players</a> match at Lord's.

Before the 1894 season, MacLaren resigned from the bank to play a whole season of cricket. Lancashire at the time were undergoing a period of transition, and the captaincy was unsettled: three men captained the county in the first part of the season. In the absence of other amateurs with county experience who could play regularly, MacLaren was appointed captain. "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" observed that MacLaren was young for the position, and largely unproven in cricket, but it supported the decision. After losing his first match in charge, the team improved in the latter part of the season to finish fourth in the Championship. MacLaren finished sixth in the Lancashire averages, and in total scored 1,105 runs at 25.69, but his batting had made little progress since his debut. However, his successful leadership of Lancashire led some press critics to suggest him as a future England captain. At the end of the season, he was a last-minute selection to tour Australia with a team led by <a href="Andrew%20Stoddart">Andrew Stoddart</a>.

Approached to organise a touring team by the Australian cricket authorities, Stoddart had been unable to persuade several leading batsmen to join his squad. Stoddart only took 13 men, of whom two were <a href="wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a>s (only one of whom could realistically play in each match) and one was a <a href="Lob%20bowling">lob bowler</a> who did not play any Test matches; this guaranteed MacLaren's selection for all the matches against Australia. Consequently, he retained his place even when his form was poor. In his first game, against <a href="South%20Australia%20cricket%20team">South Australia</a>, he scored 228, and hit another half-century in the build-up to the first Test. He made his international debut on 14 December 1894, scoring 4 and 20 as England won despite being asked to <a href="follow%20on">follow on</a>. England also won the next game, although MacLaren was <a href="caught">caught</a> from the opening delivery of the match, the first time anyone had been dismissed by the first ball of a Test. Australia took the third and fourth Tests to level the series. MacLaren had little personal success, and averaged only 12.50 in the series after four games.

By then, MacLaren was in financial difficulties. As an amateur, his expenses were covered by the tour organisers but he received no money for playing. To support him financially, the Lancashire committee had given him £100 before the tour. By the latter stages of the tour, his money was running out; most of it was probably spent betting on <a href="Horse%20racing">horse races</a>, and he sent Lancashire a request for further money. Just before the final Test, he received a £60 advance on his expenses for the upcoming English season. For the fifth Test, he dropped down from opening the batting, which he had done throughout the series, to batting at <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">number five</a>, and responded with his first Test century. Batting with greater caution than usual, he scored 120 before accidentally <a href="Hit%20wicket">standing on his own wicket</a>. England won the match to take the series 3–2, amid great public interest in England and Australia. MacLaren scored 240 runs at 26.67 in the Test series, finishing fourth in the English averages. He performed more effectively in the lesser matches, and following some final tour fixtures, he totalled 803 runs at 47.23 in all first-class games. On the six-week outward journey MacLaren met (Kathleen) Maud Power, an Australian socialite and the daughter of a horse racing official. They were married in 1898.

MacLaren returned home via Japan, missing the start of the 1895 cricket season. In his absence, he was named as a <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">"Young Batsman of the Year"</a> in "Wisden" for his performances in 1894. After playing two games for Lancashire, MacLaren accepted the offer of a teaching job in a <a href="Preparatory%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">preparatory school</a> in Harrow; although still Lancashire's captain, he missed several matches, to the disquiet of its supporters. The team's results were mixed in his absence, and he returned to play <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a> at <a href="Taunton%20Cricket%20Ground">Taunton</a>. On the first day of the three-day game, MacLaren scored 289 not out in 330 minutes. On the second day, he took his score to 424 before he was dismissed, surpassing the previous highest individual innings in first-class cricket, <a href="W.%20G.%20Grace">W. G. Grace</a>'s score of 344, made in 1876. MacLaren batted for 470 minutes in total and hit 62 <a href="Boundary%20%28cricket%29%23Scoring%20runs">fours</a> and a <a href="Boundary%20%28cricket%29%23Scoring%20runs">six</a>. This remained the highest score in first-class cricket until 1923 when <a href="Bill%20Ponsford">Bill Ponsford</a> scored 429 in Australia, and was the largest first-class innings in England until <a href="Brian%20Lara">Brian Lara</a> scored 501 in 1994. In total, Lancashire scored 801 runs and won the game by an innings. After a spell of lower scores, MacLaren played several big innings, including three consecutive centuries in the last three games of the season. He ended 1895 top of the national batting averages with 1,229 runs at 51.20. MacLaren was elected a life member of Lancashire in recognition of his achievements.

Teaching commitments left MacLaren unavailable for the start of the 1896 season, and his first appearance came in July. Although he had only batted once in the season, he was chosen to play in the second Test match of the summer between England and Australia, a selection made controversial by his lack of cricket. As the Test was played at Old Trafford, the England team was chosen by the Lancashire committee, who recognised that MacLaren would attract spectators as a local player. He was dismissed by the first ball he faced in the first innings, and scored 15 runs in the second as England were defeated. Shortly after the Test, he scored 226 against <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> to take Lancashire to a draw in a match they seemed likely to lose. This was enough for him to retain his place in the team for the final Test match, where he scored 20 and 6. He batted effectively for the rest of the season, finishing with 713 runs for Lancashire at 54.85. Critics praised his batting, but his absences may have prevented the team from winning the Championship; they finished second. In all first-class matches, he scored 922 runs at 36.88.

MacLaren's teaching duties meant that in 1897 he again missed the start of the cricket season, and he felt it necessary to resign as Lancashire's captain. When he began playing, he scored heavily, including another double century against Kent, and his runs helped Lancashire to win the County Championship: concentrating on aggressive batting, he scored faster than in previous years, and hit 974 runs at 51.26. At the end of the season, MacLaren was included in Stoddart's second Australian touring team. Despite high expectations of success, the Test series was lost 4–1. Although nominally captain, Stoddart played in only two Tests; he was grief-stricken after the death of his mother and disillusioned by the failures of his team. MacLaren, after an unproductive start to the tour, scored 142 and 100 against <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a> to become the first batsman to score two centuries in the same Australian first-class match. In the absence of Stoddart, he captained the England team in the first Test. He scored 109 in the first innings, batting more cautiously than usual, and 50 not out in the second as England won by nine wickets. His captaincy proved controversial when he refused to recall the Australian batsman <a href="Charlie%20McLeod">Charlie McLeod</a> to the wickets after he was dismissed; McLeod was out to a <a href="no-ball">no-ball</a> but, being deaf, did not hear the umpire's call and was run out when he left his <a href="Crease%20%28cricket%29">crease</a>. With Stoddart still absent, MacLaren was captain in the second Test. Australia won by an innings, and MacLaren was criticised in the Australian press for complaining about the pitch. Commentators also suggested that he underused the bowling of <a href="Ted%20Wainwright">Ted Wainwright</a>. Stoddart returned for the third and fourth Tests, both of which England lost by an innings. MacLaren scored 124 in the third game, but was mocked in the press after the fourth when he claimed that a fly in his eye caused him to be dismissed. When Stoddart withdrew from the final match, MacLaren once more assumed the leadership. He scored 65 in the first innings but could not prevent Australia winning again.

In all first-class matches, MacLaren scored 1,037 runs at 54.57; in the Test matches, he aggregated 488 runs at an average of 54.22. "Wisden" noted that MacLaren batted "magnificently" and commented: "Of all the English players the one who had the best cause to look back upon the trip with satisfaction was MacLaren." At the conclusion of the tour, on 17 March 1898, he married Power. The wedding attracted media attention and was well attended. The couple later had two sons.

MacLaren played little cricket in 1898, initially owing to his teaching commitments and the need to establish himself and his wife in a new home. After making his first appearance in July, he did not play again until August. He played nine first-class games, scoring 478 runs at 29.87, before his season was ended by <a href="neuralgia">neuralgia</a>. Despite his frequent absences—again he missed the first part of the season—Lancashire re-appointed MacLaren as joint captain for 1899. That summer, the Australians toured England and the first Test took place before MacLaren had played any cricket. For the second game, MacLaren replaced W. G. Grace as England captain; the other candidate for the leadership was <a href="Stanley%20Jackson">Stanley Jackson</a>, who was senior to MacLaren at Harrow and had preceded him into the England side, but MacLaren was favoured owing to his previous experience in the role with Lancashire and England.

Australia comfortably won the second Test, and on his first appearance of the season, MacLaren scored 4 runs opening the innings on the first day. In the second innings, he moved down the order to number six, but he came in to bat when England trailed heavily and had lost four wickets. He batted for around 150 minutes to score 88 not out. The "Wisden" match report stated: "There was ... some risk in playing MacLaren, who had not so far taken part in any first-class cricket during the season. In this case however, the [selection] committee had reason to congratulate themselves, MacLaren playing a magnificent second innings and making a great, though fruitless, effort to save the game ... Never has MacLaren played a greater innings." Afterwards, MacLaren scored a century in difficult batting conditions against Yorkshire. Jackson did not play in this game, and initially refused to play for England in the third Test; the press attributed this to jealousy of MacLaren and anger at being passed over for the captaincy. The third Test was <a href="Result%20%28cricket%29%23Draw">drawn</a> owing to poor weather, but England's revival continued in the next game, which was drawn with England in a dominant position. The final match was also drawn, but while England lost the series 1–0, critics believed the team had recovered from a poor start to the summer and held the ascendancy in the final three games. MacLaren's only score over fifty was that in the second Test, and he finished the series with 164 runs at 32.80. In all first-class cricket, he made 814 runs at 32.56, including two centuries against Yorkshire.

In late 1899, MacLaren joined a private cricket tour of America and Canada organised by the cricket-playing Indian prince <a href="Ranjitsinhji">Ranjitsinhji</a>. The following March, he was appointed as an assistant secretary at Lancashire. The position was a sinecure; his main role was to coach the first eleven which effectively meant that he was paid to play cricket, despite his amateur status. Surviving records do not indicate his salary, but some sources suggest he was paid comfortably more than Lancashire's leading professionals. In addition, MacLaren worked as a journalist for the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>", reporting on matches in which he played, a common practice at the time for amateurs. Resuming sole control over the Lancashire side, and freed from his teaching responsibilities, MacLaren played from the beginning of the 1900 season, planning meticulously in a bid to lead Lancashire to the County Championship. His batting form suffered initially, but the team dominated the start of the season. Commentators gave much of the credit to MacLaren's captaincy. However, he was severely criticised for conservative tactics in one game, when he was reluctant to attempt to force a win. In the latter stages of the season, MacLaren scored prolifically, making a succession of high scores at rapid pace. He ended the 1900 season with 1,554 runs at 36.13. During that season, the leading Lancashire bowler <a href="Arthur%20Mold">Arthur Mold</a> had been no-balled for <a href="Throwing%20%28cricket%29">throwing</a>, but MacLaren defended him in the press. At a meeting of county captains in December, MacLaren was the only representative to defend the legality of Mold's <a href="bowling%20action">bowling action</a>, and in 1901, Mold was again no-balled and his career was effectively over. MacLaren struggled with injury in 1901, and his batting form suffered. He frequently dropped low in the batting order, and it was late in the season before he began to score runs regularly. His captaincy was criticised after some tactical decisions which were either unconventional or unsuccessful, and he clashed with the Lancashire committee over the poor state of Old Trafford's pitch. In total, he scored 1,069 first-class runs at 31.44.
MacLaren was invited by the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a> to bring a team to Australia during the English winter of 1901–02. This was the last privately organised team to represent England at Test level in Australia, with subsequent ones playing under the colours of the MCC. Many leading players were unavailable—Yorkshire's <a href="Wilfred%20Rhodes">Wilfred Rhodes</a> and <a href="George%20Hirst">George Hirst</a> were not permitted to tour by their captain <a href="Martin%20Hawke%2C%207th%20Baron%20Hawke">Lord Hawke</a>. The team was judged to be weak, but contained several players at the beginning of their careers who went on to success at Test level. <a href="Sydney%20Barnes">Sydney Barnes</a> was chosen by MacLaren after playing only a handful of county matches. Barnes' success on his single appearance for Lancashire in 1901 convinced MacLaren of his worth, to the surprise and disparagement of commentators, most of whom had never seen him. Barnes began the tour well, but did not get on with his captain. During a storm on part of the sea journey, MacLaren, speculating on their chances of survival, commented to a team member: "If we go down, at least that bugger Barnes will go down with us." The team lost their first match and continued to struggle. MacLaren clashed with authorities in Melbourne over his right to choose an umpire, but he began to bat well at Sydney, where he scored 145 and 73 in a tour match.

In the first Test, MacLaren shared a century opening partnership with <a href="Tom%20Hayward">Tom Hayward</a> and scored 116 to become the first man to score four Test centuries. This was the last Test century by an England captain in Australia for 57 years. Barnes bowled with great success; <a href="Colin%20Blythe">Colin Blythe</a> and <a href="Len%20Braund">Len Braund</a>, like Barnes chosen by MacLaren and making their Test debuts, performed effectively and England won by an innings. The remaining four Tests were lost as the team suffered from a lack of effective bowlers. MacLaren severely overbowled Barnes, who took 13 wickets, in the second Test; the bowler was injured in the next game and took no further part on the tour. MacLaren was successful with the bat. He scored 92 in the fourth Test, made centuries in the two first-class games played in between the Test matches, and finished top of the batting averages. Critics judged that his team had performed well despite the heavy defeat, and his captaincy attracted praise. In addition, the team were considered to be the best fielding side to visit Australia. In the Test series, MacLaren scored 412 runs at 45.77, while in all first-class matches he hit 929 runs at 58.06.

Before the tour began, MacLaren resigned as Lancashire's captain and assistant secretary, owing to his concern for the health of his wife. Journalists speculated that MacLaren would join the <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a> team as assistant secretary, as he lived in that county, or even move to Australia. Lancashire selected a replacement captain, but when MacLaren returned to England, he re-committed to the club, stating the visit to Australia had improved the health of his wife, and he was reappointed.

MacLaren began the 1902 season well and, facing an <a href="The%20Ashes">Ashes</a> series against Australia, began planning for the Tests; he arranged to receive reports on prospective players from both sides. England dominated the first Test, scoring 376 and bowling Australia out for 36; rain prevented a result and also heavily curtailed the drawn second Test. The team for the third Test, played in Sheffield, was to be chosen from 12 players picked by the selectors, with the final place contested between <a href="William%20Lockwood%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Lockwood</a> and <a href="Schofield%20Haigh">Schofield Haigh</a>. However, on the morning of the match, MacLaren, with the approval of the selector Lord Hawke, summoned Barnes from Manchester to play instead of either. The move was unpopular with spectators—their favoured choice, Haigh, was a Yorkshire player—but Barnes took six wickets in the first innings, although injury reduced his effectiveness in the second innings. England were bowled out in poor light—MacLaren's biographer Michael Down suggests that part of the blame lies with him for not <a href="Cricket%23Influence%20of%20weather">appealing against the light</a>—and needed an unlikely 339 runs to win in their second innings. MacLaren changed the batting order, asking <a href="Gilbert%20Jessop">Gilbert Jessop</a> to open the batting. Jessop scored fifty, and MacLaren scored 63, but England lost by 143 runs.

Following the defeat, the England selectors made several changes for the fourth Test; both Barnes and Jessop were left out. MacLaren favoured Jessop's inclusion but the selectors considered him unreliable. Although Barnes was not fully fit, later commentators suggested the selectors omitted him because of MacLaren's actions at Sheffield. A further player was added to the squad in case the pitch was affected by rain before the match, but rather than choosing Haigh, the leading wet-pitch bowler in the country, Hawke insisted that Sussex's <a href="Fred%20Tate">Fred Tate</a> was included—critics have suggested that Hawke wanted to prevent Haigh's absence from the Yorkshire team, of which Hawke was captain, given the unlikeliness of the extra bowler being needed. According to the cricket writer <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a>, when MacLaren saw the list of players in the team, he responded: "My God, look what they've sent me". MacLaren was angry with Hawke, and when it rained before the match, included Tate in the final eleven at the expense of George Hirst, a leading all-rounder. Gibson suggests that Tate was only included by the selectors "because they thought MacLaren could not possibly pick him" and so he could not make any further late changes to the team; MacLaren, according to Gibson, in turn included Tate out of spite. Other writers have suggested that MacLaren, as a Lancastrian, preferred a Sussex player to a Yorkshire one.

Australia won the <a href="Toss%20%28cricket%29">toss</a>. The match began in damp conditions, and before the pitch began to dry, at which point it would become extremely difficult for batting, the Australian opening batsmen scored 135 in 90 minutes; Australia's total reached 173 for one wicket at lunch, and <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a> scored a century in that time. MacLaren was subsequently criticised for allowing Australia to score so quickly, but claimed that his carefully planned strategy was rendered obsolete when Trumper began to strike the ball out of the ground. MacLaren commented: "I couldn't very well have had a man fielding in the bloody practice ground, now could I?" The bowlers recovered the situation to some extent, and following a century from Jackson, England trailed by 37 runs after the first innings. In the second innings, Australia collapsed to the England bowlers, but Tate dropped a crucial catch while stationed by MacLaren at the edge of the field. MacLaren also received criticism for this, as Tate was unaccustomed to fielding on the boundary. Gibson notes that MacLaren "later spent much breath defending himself on this point"; although it is not clear how Tate came to be moved—a later interpretation is that MacLaren moved Tate there rather than ask an amateur player to cross the field for a few deliveries—most commentators agree that this was the turning point of the match. England were left needing 124 runs to win. MacLaren opened the batting, having batted at number four in the first innings, and tried to score quickly, but was caught from a big hit. According to Gibson, he returned to the dressing room in fury, throwing his bat across the room and saying that he had "thrown away the match and the bloody rubber [series]". Gibson suggests that the implication that only MacLaren could have guided England to victory must have had a demoralising effect on the remaining batsmen, and speculates that he felt guilty over the composition of a team that looked likely to lose. Gibson comments: "This does not say much for MacLaren as a captain. Indeed, it has always seemed to me a shocking performance, from the choice of the team to the chuck of the bat." Wickets continued to fall and Tate, the last batsman, was bowled when England needed four runs to win.

England won the final match by one wicket, but lost the series 2–1. While contemporary critics did not blame MacLaren, the cricket authorities were less happy. MacLaren believed that the choices of the selectors had made it impossible to win, and continued to write about the series for many years. He finished the series with 198 runs at 28.28, and ended the season with 1,254 first-class runs at 32.15.

MacLaren took a new job with a wine merchant which allowed him to complete a full season in 1903. Wet weather caused many difficult pitches for batting, and MacLaren was often the only Lancashire batsman able to cope with the conditions. His highest-profile success came when he captained the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's. When his team faced defeat on the final day on a difficult pitch, he scored 168 not out and shared a partnership of 309 with C. B. Fry in less than three hours. This innings was later praised as one of his finest. He ended the season with 1,886 runs at 42.86, and Lancashire finished fourth. However, his success with the bat was overshadowed by controversy over the England captaincy. MacLaren originally planned to tour Australia with another private team in the winter of 1903–04, but withdrew over his concerns that there was not enough strong bowling available. Frustrated with MacLaren, the cricket authorities in Melbourne asked the MCC, via <a href="Pelham%20Warner">Pelham Warner</a>, to organise their own team. MacLaren was not offered the captaincy—Warner was chosen in June 1903 when Jackson proved unavailable. Newspaper rumours suggested that Lord Hawke played a part in this decision, and that MacLaren's recent paid role for Lancashire counted against him. The press favoured MacLaren, and Warner was widely criticised; one journal noted that he was "condemned as an interloper and a nonentity". The cricket establishment was less sympathetic to MacLaren. After publicly vacillating over the summer, he eventually decided not to tour under Warner, whom he perceived to be his junior. The tour proved a great success for Warner, and his team won the Test series.

In 1904, MacLaren led Lancashire to victory in the County Championship, their only such success under his captaincy. Unusually for a Championship-winning team, the club relied heavily on batting rather than bowling. MacLaren played several big innings, scoring at a rapid pace, as his team began the season with a string of victories. Their form faded later in the season, but they remained unbeaten. In all first-class cricket, MacLaren scored 1,191 runs at 31.34. At some point during the season, he was asked by Ranjitsinhji, a close friend, to become his private secretary, and both men travelled to India during the winter of 1904–05. Ranjitsinhji at the time was pursuing his claim to the throne of <a href="Nawanagar%20State">Nawanagar</a>, and he remained in India when MacLaren returned to England for the 1905 cricket season.

The Australians toured England in 1905, but MacLaren was again passed over for the England captaincy; the team was captained by Jackson and won the series 2–0. MacLaren began the season well and played in the first Test. Australia led by 25 runs after the first innings, as England struggled to play the pace of <a href="Tibby%20Cotter">Albert Cotter</a>. According to a story later told by Neville Cardus, before the second innings he saw MacLaren muttering: "Cotter! I'll bloody Cotter him!". MacLaren attacked Cotter's bowling, and overcame the defensive bowling tactics used by Australia to slow down the game. He scored 140, his highest Test innings and only Test century in England. When Australia batted, <a href="Bernard%20Bosanquet%20%28cricketer%29">Bernard Bosanquet</a> took eight wickets to bowl England to a win; it was MacLaren's suggestion that Jackson persist with Bosanquet's bowling when it was initially unsuccessful. MacLaren scored 56 and 79 in the drawn second Test, but did not play in the third owing to injury. He played in the final two Tests but accomplished little. In the series, he scored 303 runs at 43.28. Jackson later wrote that MacLaren was an invaluable tactical aid during the series. Lancashire ended the season second in the Championship, and opened a testimonial fund for MacLaren which raised over £800 by the end of the season. He later clashed with committee members who were unhappy with his decision to use the money to buy a motor car. At the end of the season, MacLaren resigned the captaincy of Lancashire, but was persuaded to continue by the committee. In total during 1905, he scored 1,522 runs at an average of 35.39 in all first-class cricket.

A combination of injuries and work reduced the amount of cricket MacLaren played after 1905. He missed most of Lancashire's matches in June and July 1906. He returned against Middlesex at Lord's in August, but was involved in mild controversy when he declined to put Middlesex's batsmen under pressure when chasing a small but challenging total to win the game; this may have arisen from his dislike of Lord's and the figures in authority there. MacLaren ended the 1906 season with 599 runs at 20.65. In the winter of 1906–07, MacLaren returned to India to work for Ranjitsinhji. In January 1907, he wrote to Lancashire to inform them of his reduced availability for 1907; even so, the committee retained him as captain. In February, Ranjitsinhji was named as the new ruler of Nawanagar. MacLaren attended his installation on 11 March—MacLaren and the politician <a href="Arthur%20Priestley">Arthur Priestley</a> were the only English attendees—and did not return to England until mid-June, although he informed Lancashire that his absence in India was to recover from an illness. He resumed the captaincy of Lancashire, and made a good start with scores of 47 and 92 in his second match, but his form faded. One match provoked a public row between MacLaren and Lord's. MacLaren captained Lancashire against Middlesex at Lord's in July; rain restricted play on the first day of the three-day game, and at the start of the second day, the umpires ruled that the waterlogged pitch remained unfit to play on. Some spectators came on to the pitch to look for themselves, then protested outside the pavilion. The incident was defused by the ground authorities, but the following day MacLaren told the press: "Owing to the pitch having been deliberately torn up by the public, I, as captain of the Lancashire eleven, cannot see my way to continue the game, the groundsman bearing me out that the wicket [pitch] could not be again put right." Lancashire would not play—although all decisions about fitness for play should have been made by the umpires, not MacLaren—and the match was drawn. The incident provoked discussion in the press, but most critics agreed that MacLaren was in the wrong. MacLaren subsequently scored his first century for two years, but he did little in the remainder of the season, at the end of which he again resigned the captaincy of Lancashire, conscious of his failing form and fitness. In all first-class cricket in 1907, he scored 829 runs at 26.74.

Much of MacLaren's time was now taken up working for Ranjitsinhji, who visited England between October 1907 and December 1908. MacLaren played just nine matches in 1908; Lancashire were eager for him to play, but he had little impact. His greatest success came for the Gentlemen against the Players at <a href="the%20Oval">the Oval</a>, when he shared a partnership of 141 with C. B. Fry. In total, he scored 428 runs at an average of 28.53. Meanwhile, Ranjitsinhji lived extravagantly in Sussex, running up huge bills and ignoring most attempts to make him pay. MacLaren was involved in several cases which resulted in either legal action or complaint to the <a href="India%20Office">India Office</a>. When an artist had to go to court to make Ranjitsinhji pay for work she had done, MacLaren's attempts to delay and obstruct her caused the India Office, in its adjudication, to describe him as Ranjitsinhji's "ridiculous private secretary". In October, MacLaren was taken to court himself over non-payment of rent. He had a house close to Ranjitsinhji's residence, and claimed in court that Ranjitsinhji rented the house on his behalf, and, as a ruling prince, could not be prosecuted. The magistrates disagreed, ruled MacLaren liable, and forced him to pay—although Ranjitsinhji probably paid for him.

In his biography of Ranjitsinhji, Simon Wilde suggests that MacLaren had to work very hard for his employer in this period, and found little time for cricket. In addition, his batting form was poor throughout, and he seemed to be in bad physical condition when he occasionally found time to play. Before Ranjitsinhji returned to India, MacLaren resigned as his secretary—although he went with him to India for a holiday. According to Wilde, the resignation was to allow MacLaren to play more regularly, but "he never really recovered his form". In summarising Ranjitsinhji's life at this time, Wilde suggests that his unreliability with money was quite calculated, and writes: "Many of his off-the-field exploits with A. C. MacLaren ... will probably never be known, but it seems clear that sometimes they were not averse to conducting themselves in the fashion of E. W. Hornung's fictional character <a href="A.%20J.%20Raffles">Raffles</a>, the cricketing burglar."

For the 1909 season, MacLaren worked to improve his fitness prior to that summer's Test series against Australia. Jackson was first choice to lead the England team, but when he was unavailable, MacLaren was appointed captain, to the approval of critics and the public. MacLaren began the season well for Lancashire, and as Australia struggled in their early tour matches, England began the Tests as favourites to win. England won the low-scoring first match; the press praised MacLaren's deployment of fielders.
In England's second innings <a href="Jack%20Hobbs">Jack Hobbs</a>, batting with Fry—whom MacLaren promoted to open the batting having done so himself in the first innings—scored the required runs to complete a ten-wicket win. Hobbs was making his first Test appearance in England, despite MacLaren's reluctance to include him in the team.

The England selectors made several changes to the team for the second Test. Colin Blythe, a crucial bowler to the team, withdrew before the game. Other players were left out whom most commentators believed should have played, and the bowling attack was packed with <a href="Fast%20bowling%23Categorisation%20of%20fast%20bowling">medium-paced bowlers</a> of a similar style. The report in "Wisden" suggested: "Never in the history of Test Matches in England has there been such blundering in the selection of an England eleven". The selectors later implied the controversial choices were at the behest of MacLaren, although other evidence suggests that MacLaren did not get the team he requested. England lost the game; MacLaren's reputation suffered and commentators began to blame him for the defeat. He offered his resignation, but the selectors retained him as captain and restored some of the players omitted from the second Test. When England lost the third Test after the batsmen failed, not helped by MacLaren's poor form, critics questioned his place in the team. MacLaren tried to excuse his position, suggesting in the press that he knew the team would struggle and played "in spite of my personal wishes". He also implied that the team's selection was out of his hands. When the fourth Test was rained off, England could not win the series and so Australia retained the Ashes.

The final match of the series was drawn, mainly because the pitch heavily favoured batting. MacLaren was involved in another selection controversy when the fast bowler <a href="Claude%20Buckenham">Claude Buckenham</a> was left out of the England team at his instigation. The "Wisden" match report described this decision as "so grave a blunder that it is difficult to find words in which to speak of it." The "Wisden" editor, <a href="Sydney%20Pardon">Sydney Pardon</a>, commented: "A fatal blunder was committed in leaving out Buckenham—a blunder for which it was generally understood that MacLaren was responsible. Experts occasionally do strange things and this was one of the strangest. The idea of letting England go into the field in fine weather, on a typical Oval wicket, with no fast bowler except Sharp touched the confines of lunacy." Further issues arose over MacLaren's handling of his bowlers, and "Wisden" suggested "MacLaren was sadly at fault in his management of the England bowling". <a href="Douglas%20Carr">Douglas Carr</a>, a 37-year-old, was called into the team after some success in preceding games and on the premise that the Australians would be unable to play his <a href="googly">googly</a>. After Carr had initial success, MacLaren kept him bowling for a long period until the player tired and was easily punished by the batsmen. In his only innings, MacLaren scored 12, and when the match ended, much of the blame for England's failures was apportioned to him. In the series, he scored 85 runs at 12.14. The Oval match was his final Test match; in 35 games he had scored 1,931 runs at 33.87. He ended the season with 613 runs at 19.77.

MacLaren played regularly for Lancashire at the start of 1910, but his poor form continued until midway through the season, when he scored centuries in successive matches. He played once more for Lancashire and once for the "Gentlemen of England" before withdrawing from first-class cricket for the season, in which he scored 345 runs at 26.53. This was effectively the end of his Lancashire career and he played only sporadically for the team afterwards. He continued to play cricket, including a tour of Argentina with the MCC in 1910–11. He also played for the team of the businessman <a href="Lionel%20Robinson">Lionel Robinson</a>, including some first-class games, over the following seasons. During the 1914 season, MacLaren attempted to return to the Lancashire team, possibly to boost the circulation of a magazine for which he was writing. He appeared in one county match, without success, although he continued to play in other first-class games for the MCC and other teams.

After MacLaren stopped playing regularly for Lancashire, he formed a business partnership with J. N. Pentelow, a cricket writer. Pentelow was the owner of "The World of Cricket", a cricket magazine, and in 1914 MacLaren joined him in an attempt to improve its circulation. MacLaren was officially known as the editor of the publication and Pentelow his assistant, but the latter did most of the work. Pentelow was already struggling to keep the magazine going, but matters worsened after MacLaren joined. Pentelow's debts increased and by the end of 1914, the business folded; although details are obscure, Down suggests that "MacLaren's characteristic unreliability with money left Pentelow very much in the lurch."

During the First World War, MacLaren joined the <a href="Royal%20Army%20Service%20Corps">Royal Army Service Corps</a> as a lieutenant and worked in the Manchester area recruiting men into the army. He was promoted to captain before leaving the Army on health grounds. After the war, he was employed as cricket manager for Lionel Robinson and wrote for various newspapers and cricket publications. MacLaren and his family lived for a time on Robinson's estate when their financial situation was poor. He advised Robinson on the best way to prepare cricket pitches and to organise matches which might bring about Robinson's greater acceptance in <a href="High%20society%20%28group%29">society</a>. As part of this process, MacLaren arranged for <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201921">the 1921 Australian touring team</a> to play at Robinson's cricket ground against a team selected and captained by MacLaren himself. The Australians struggled against MacLaren's team, but went on to dominate the Test matches against England; MacLaren insisted throughout the summer that the Australian team was not as strong as it appeared, and that younger English players should be chosen. Eastbourne Cricket Club invited him to captain a team named "An England XI" against the tourists following the conclusion of the Tests. He was dismissed by critics when he claimed that he could beat the Australian team; prior to the game, the Australians were undefeated on the tour and had won 22 of their 36 games. MacLaren planned meticulously for the match; he chose an all-amateur team, selecting spin bowlers noted for their reliability and excellent fielders. Although bowled out for 43 in their first innings, MacLaren's team came back strongly to win by 28 runs, the touring team's first defeat, although his batting contribution was slight.

Lancashire appointed MacLaren as coach for the 1922 season, to popular acclaim; he also captained the Lancashire second team. Even before he began work, his poor financial situation forced him to request two advances on his salary. As a coach, MacLaren was autocratic and demanding, but encouraged the players to think for themselves. He was unpopular with some players and clashed frequently with the Lancashire committee. During the winter of 1922–23, the MCC organised two cricket tours—a Test playing tour to South Africa and a tour to <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201922%E2%80%9323">Australia</a> and <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club%20cricket%20team%20in%20New%20Zealand%20in%201922%E2%80%9323">New Zealand</a> intended to give experience to young, promising cricketers. MacLaren was chosen to captain the latter team on account of his experience and his success with young cricketers during his win over the Australians in 1921. He was given a good reception by the crowds when he played and press reports praised his tactical awareness. The team was undefeated in matches in New Zealand. Against the full New Zealand team, MacLaren scored 200 not out in 264 minutes in his final first-class innings; the effort placed a strain on his knee and he was unable to play again on the tour. He ended his first-class career with 22,236 runs at an average of 34.15.

When the team returned to play more matches in Australia, MacLaren became involved in controversy for criticising the standards of play in New Zealand and for comments made in the press there. He also queried the first-class status of Bill Ponsford's record innings of 429, scored against <a href="Tasmania%20cricket%20team">Tasmania</a>. On the journey home, MacLaren sent a message to Lancashire asking for more money; the committee declined to send the sum and shortly afterwards terminated his contract as coach. Lancashire told the press that MacLaren's knee injury meant that he could not continue.

In the following years, MacLaren and his family struggled financially. His wife's family sometimes sent money, but MacLaren often spent extravagantly whenever he had funds. On one occasion, when paid for writing an article, he moved out of his accommodation into an expensive hotel, and threw a dinner party for his friends. He ran up many debts—including an unpaid champagne bill at Old Trafford Cricket Ground in 1923—and borrowed money from friends. He supplemented his wife's income through working as a journalist and a coach. Among other business ventures, he designed a cricket bat, showed specially shot cricket films, briefly owned a hotel and attempted to start a horse bloodstock agency. He continued to play club cricket and in 1924–25 he managed a privately organised tour of South Africa.

Shortly before the Second World War, MacLaren's wife inherited a large sum of money which enabled them to live in comfort. They bought an estate on which MacLaren had a house built, and the couple were able to live in the extravagant manner he had always wanted. Around this time, on a visit to America, MacLaren made a brief appearance in the Hollywood film <a href="The%20Four%20Feathers%20%281939%20film%29">"The Four Feathers"</a>, which starred his friend, former cricketer <a href="C.%20Aubrey%20Smith">C. Aubrey Smith</a>. In the 1940s, his health began to fail. He was hurt in a car crash and then contracted cancer. He died on 17 November 1944, aged 72; his wife died a few months later.

MacLaren's obituary in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" stated that he was "one of the outstanding opening batsmen of all time". As a batsman, he had a reputation for stylishness, but his technique was based on scoring runs safely. He always tried to seize the initiative in a game. Batting with his head slightly raised, he drew his bat back unusually far, which provided the power to his shots, and in particular his <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">drives</a>. He scored runs quickly, mainly through his ability to score from <a href="good%20length%20ball">good length ball</a>s. When playing a shot, he either stepped right forward or moved far back in the batting crease and having hit the ball, he followed through with the bat, often holding his pose for effect. These qualities, and his quick footwork, made him effective on difficult batting pitches. One of his most highly regarded shots was the <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Pull%20and%20hook">hook</a>. In later years, Cardus described the shot: "To see MacLaren hook a fast ball ... from the front of his face, was in those days an experience which thrilled me like heroic poetry; he didn't merely hook the ball, he dismissed it from his presence." Cardus, for whom MacLaren was a boyhood hero, wrote prolifically about him in later years; he called one such essay on MacLaren "The Noblest Roman", and judged him among the best of all batsmen. Gideon Haigh suggests: "If ever a cricketer was the creation of a single writer, it is MacLaren, the luminous majesty with which he is associated owed in very large degree to his youthful acolyte Neville Cardus." MacLaren was also a highly proficient fielder, initially in <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">the outfield</a> but later at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Catching%20positions">slip</a>.

Critics have looked less favourably on MacLaren as a captain. When he assumed the leadership of England, the press were reporting on the tactical performance of captains for the first time. MacLaren was among the first captains to study tactics. However, judgements on his effectiveness have varied greatly. For most of his career, he was regarded as an excellent captain. Contemporaries praised his tactical awareness; he planned minutely, and organised his fields extremely carefully to prevent batsmen scoring through blocking their favourite shots, a technique practically unheard of at the time. He liked to alter the batting order, a tactic which often divides critics, although it frequently succeeded for MacLaren. He was less successful in managing his team. Regarded as a pessimist, he openly showed disappointment at the composition of his sides, and became downcast when the course of the match was running against him. Some of those who played under him thought that his sides were unhappy ones which operated without joy and solely concentrated on winning. He encountered many difficulties over selection; he often promoted cricketers whom he considered to show potential and consequently railed against committees which did not provide him with the players he wanted. Down suggests that MacLaren was usually correct, being more experienced and a better judge than most of those who chose the teams. Peter Wynne-Thomas describes MacLaren's approach to selection as "unorthodox", and writes that while his ideas were sometimes successful, they failed badly at other times. Apart from his own failings, MacLaren had a reputation as an unlucky captain, both in terms of losing important players to injury and illness before vital games, and in the frequency with which he lost the toss before a match. Nor was MacLaren particularly popular; in later years, several people for whom he had been a hero changed their opinion once they met him.

In his history of the club, Peter Wynne-Thomas describes MacLaren as the dominant figure in Lancashire cricket from his debut until the First World War. Gibson accepts that MacLaren was tactically a good captain, but observes that in his 12 seasons as leader of a strong Lancashire team, he only once won the County Championship. In addition, as the appointed captain in four series against Australia, he was beaten in each one, something no other England captain has repeated. Gibson suggests that "the excuses begin to run thin, sieved through such a tale of failure." Gibson summarises that "England under MacLaren must have been a good side to watch, save for the passionate partisans, but an uncomfortable side in which to play ... Bad captain or no, with no doubt ... MacLaren was one of the most entrancing, one of the most glamorous—though that word had not come into fashion in his day—characters of his cricketing epoch."

Portman Road

Portman Road is a <a href="association%20football">football</a> stadium in <a href="Ipswich">Ipswich</a>, Suffolk, England, which has been the home ground of <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town F.C.</a> since 1884. The stadium has also hosted many England youth international matches, and one <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">senior England</a> <a href="Exhibition%20game%23Association%20football">friendly</a> international match, against <a href="Croatia%20national%20football%20team">Croatia</a> in 2003. It staged several other sporting events, including athletics meetings and international <a href="Field%20hockey">hockey</a> matches, musical concerts and Christian events.

The stadium underwent significant redevelopments in the early 2000s, which increased the capacity from 22,600 to a current figure of 30,311, making it the largest-capacity football ground in <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>. Its four stands have since been converted to <a href="All-seater%20stadium">all-seater</a>, following the recommendations of the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a>.

Ipswich played their early matches at <a href="Broomhill%20Park">Broomhill Park</a>, but in 1884, the club moved to Portman Road and have played there ever since. The ground was also used as a cricket pitch during the summer by the East Suffolk Cricket Club who had played there since 1855. The cricket club had erected a <a href="pavilion">pavilion</a>, the first fixed building at the ground. More substantial elements of ground development did not begin for a further 11 years, though Ipswich became one of the first clubs to implement the use of goal nets in 1890. At this time, Ipswich were an amateur side (the team became professional in 1936) and the first visit of a professional club came in 1892, when <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> played a Suffolk County Football Association team. This was followed six years later by a visit from <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, a game which was so popular that a temporary stand was erected in order to accommodate a crowd of around 5,000. In 1901, a tobacco processing plant was built along the south edge of the ground by the <a href="W.A.%20%26amp%3B%20A.C.%20Churchman">Churchman brothers</a>, a name which would later become synonymous with the south stand located there.

The first permanent stand, a wooden structure known affectionately as the "Chicken Run", was built on the Portman Road side of the ground in 1906. This structure was sold in 1971 to the local <a href="Motorcycle%20speedway">speedway</a> team, the <a href="Ipswich%20Witches">Ipswich Witches</a>, who installed it at <a href="Foxhall%20Stadium">Foxhall Stadium</a>. In 1914, the ground was commandeered by the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> for use as a training camp for the duration of the First World War. Control of Portman Road was not returned to the club until two years after the end of the war and significant work was required to repair damage to the ground caused by heavy machinery.
For a short period during the 1920s, Portman Road was host to a number of <a href="whippet">whippet</a> races in an attempt to increase revenue, and in 1928 a small stand was built on the west side of the ground. The football club turned professional in 1936 and the cricket club were forced to move out, so work began on the first bank of <a href="Bleacher">terracing</a> at the north end of the pitch. The following year, on the back of winning the Southern League, a similar terrace was built at the southern "Churchmans" end and 650 <a href="tip-up%20seat">tip-up seat</a>s, bought from <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, were installed. Portman Road was home to Ipswich Town's first <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a> match on 27 August 1938, a 4–2 victory against <a href="Southend%20United%20F.C.">Southend United</a> in <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Division Three (South)</a> witnessed by more than 19,000 spectators.

The Supporters' Association funded a number of improvements at Portman Road; in 1952, concrete terracing replaced the wooden terraces at the cost of £3,000 and another £3,000 was used to re-terrace the North Stand in 1954, bringing the capacity of the ground to approximately 29,000. In 1957, the association raised £30,500 towards the building of a new West Stand, increasing ground capacity to around 31,000. <a href="Floodlights%20%28sport%29">Floodlight</a>s were installed two years later; the result of £15,000 raised by the association. The floodlights were switched on by club president Lady Blanche Cobbold for the first floodlit match at the ground, a <a href="Exhibition%20game%23Association%20football">friendly</a> against Arsenal, in February 1960.

Television cameras made their debut at Portman Road in 1962 as <a href="Anglia%20Television">Anglia Television</a> arrived for "Match of the Week"; it was another six years before the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> televised a match at the ground, "<a href="Match%20of%20the%20Day">Match of the Day</a>" visiting Portman Road for the first time in 1968 to witness Ipswich's league fixture against <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a>. Meanwhile, ground development continued with roofing enhancements to the North Stand and an increase in capacity to 31,500 by 1963. Dressing rooms were constructed in 1965 and new turnstiles were introduced two years later, including a separate entrance for juveniles at the Churchmans end. In 1968 the club agreed to a new 99-year lease on the ground with owners <a href="Ipswich%20Borough%20Council">Ipswich Borough Council</a>.
The two-tier propped cantilever Portman Stand was built along the east side of the ground in place of the existing terraces in 1971, providing 3,500 additional seats and increasing the capacity of the ground to approximately 37,000. Advertising appeared around the perimeter of the ground in the same year, while the following year saw the construction of the "Centre Spot" restaurant underneath the Portman Stand. Additional seating was added to the Portman Stand in 1974 and the ground saw its record attendance of 38,010 the following year in an <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> tie against <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a>. Following success in the <a href="1978%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1978 FA Cup</a>, the club invested in 24 executive boxes in front of the Portman Stand and, as a result of the Safety of Sports Ground Act (1975), reduced the capacity in front by introducing seats, taking the overall capacity down to 34,600.
Plastic seats replaced wooden benches in the West Stand in 1980 and in the following year, the club announced a deal with electronics company <a href="Pioneer%20Corporation">Pioneer Corporation</a> with the stand expanded at a cost of around £1.3m, renamed as the "Pioneer Stand" and re-opened in 1983. However, the cost of building the stand meant the club had to sell players, and led to a decline in fortunes on the pitch. Safety barriers were removed from the North Stand in 1989 following the <a href="Hillsborough%20disaster">Hillsborough disaster</a> and following the recommendations of the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a>, the terraces in both the North and South stands were also converted to all-seating. The Pioneer Stand was renamed as the "Britannia Stand" following a new sponsorship deal with the <a href="Britannia%20Building%20Society">building society</a> in 1999, and in the following year a statue of <a href="Sir%20Alf%20Ramsey">Sir Alf Ramsey</a> was unveiled at the corner of Portman Road and Sir Alf Ramsey Way.

Success for Ipswich Town in promotion to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in 2000 led to further investment in the infrastructure, with the club spending around £22 million on redeveloping both the North and South stands. The complete renovation of the South Stand into a two-tier stand added 4,000 seats to the stadium. The subsequent demolition and reconstruction of a two-tier North Stand added a further 4,000 seats and brought the total capacity of the ground to more than 30,000. In 2001, local brewery <a href="Greene%20King">Greene King</a> took on the sponsorship of the updated South Stand and as such, the stand was renamed the "Greene King" stand until 2009, when the sponsorship deal ended and the name changed back to the original 'South Stand'.

Following the death of former manager <a href="Bobby%20Robson">Bobby Robson</a> in 2009, the club announced that the North Stand would be renamed as the "Sir Bobby Robson Stand". The official unveiling took place at half time during the league match hosting <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>, another of Robson's former clubs, on 26 September 2009. On 31 March 2012, the South Stand was renamed the "Sir Alf Ramsey Stand" in memory of Sir Alf Ramsey who guided Ipswich Town to the Old First Division title. The <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20season">season</a> was the 50th anniversary of Ipswich Town winning the old First Division title. On 10 July 2012, the Britannia Stand was renamed "East of England Co-operative Stand" following a sponsorship deal with the <a href="East%20of%20England%20Co-operative%20Society">East of England Co-operative Society</a>.

The pitch is surrounded by four <a href="All-seater%20stadium">all-seater</a> stands, the Sir Bobby Robson Stand, the Cobbold Stand, the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand and the East of England Co-operative Stand. All stands are covered and are multi-tiered.

The Cobbold Stand was constructed in 1971, and originally known as the Portman Stand. With two tiers and a <a href="cantilever">cantilever</a> roof, it is used to accommodate away fans, with an allocation of up to 3,000 seats per game and for family seating. It also contains a number of executive boxes as well as regular seating for home fans. The Sir Alf Ramsey Stand is a two-tiered stand which has a match-day capacity of approximately 7,000. It also houses the "Sir Bobby Robson Suite" restaurant and "Legends Bar". The tunnel, from which the players emerge onto the pitch from their dressing rooms, is unusually located in the corner of the stadium between the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand and the East of England Co-operative Stand.

The East of England Co-operative Stand, constructed in 1957, was updated to an all-seater stand in 1990 and currently has three tiers consisting of home fan seating and an additional family area. It also contains the directors' box, further executive boxes and the press area. Behind the stand is a full-size <a href="AstroTurf">AstroTurf</a> pitch which is often used on a casual basis by fans before home games. The Sir Bobby Robson Stand was completely rebuilt in 2001 and has a capacity of around 7,500. It is a two-tier cantilever stand which is divided into an adults-only lower tier "...traditionally for the 'hard core' Town fan..." and a mixed upper tier.
There are nine areas throughout the ground designated for disabled supporters, in the lower East of England Co-operative Stand, the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand and the Sir Bobby Robson Stand. These provide over 300 spaces to accommodate wheelchair users and ambulant disabled, together with their carers. The ground also provides 12 seats in the East of England Co-operative Stand for visually impaired spectators with commentary via individual radio headsets in each seat, provided by local radio station <a href="BBC%20Radio%20Suffolk">BBC Radio Suffolk</a>.

The former groundsman, Alan Ferguson, received a number of accolades, including both <a href="Premier%20League">Premiership</a> and <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Championship</a> Groundsman of the Year, and the pitch was voted the best in the Championship for three consecutive seasons in 2003, 2004 and 2005.

There are statues of Sir <a href="Alf%20Ramsey">Alf Ramsey</a> and Sir <a href="Bobby%20Robson">Bobby Robson</a>, both former <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a> and <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> managers, outside the ground. Nearby Portman's Walk was renamed "Sir Alf Ramsey Way" in 1999.

On 20 August 2003, Portman Road hosted its first and thus far only senior <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> fixture, a friendly against <a href="Croatia%20national%20football%20team">Croatia</a>, the match finishing 3–1 to England in front of 28,700 spectators. The stadium has been used by England youth teams on a number of occasions, the first on 24 November 1971, saw the England U23 team draw 1–1 with Switzerland. <a href="England%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">England U21s</a> drew in a UEFA European U21 Championship qualifying match there on 18 August 2006 against Moldova, in front of 13,556 spectators.

During the years when Ipswich were members of the <a href="Amateur%20Football%20Alliance">Amateur Football Alliance</a> (AFA), Portman Road was a regular venue for showpiece matches, staging <a href="AFA%20Senior%20Cup">AFA Senior Cup</a> Finals and matches against the <a href="Corinthian%20F.C.">Corinthians</a>. It also hosted two AFA international representative matches in 1909 and 1910, with an England XI beating teams representing Bohemia (10–1) and France (20–0).

In addition, a variety of other sports have been hosted at Portman Road, including athletics in 1927, an American football match in 1953, and several international hockey matches in the 1960s and 1970s.

The stadium has also hosted several music concerts, including performances by <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>, <a href="R.E.M.">R.E.M.</a>, <a href="Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>, <a href="Pink%20%28singer%29">Pink</a>, <a href="Neil%20Diamond">Neil Diamond</a>, <a href="Tina%20Turner">Tina Turner</a>, and <a href="Rod%20Stewart">Rod Stewart</a>, among others.

In March 2005, around 8,000 Christians attended a gathering at the stadium, the largest act of Christian worship in Suffolk, since American <a href="Evangelism">evangelist</a> <a href="Billy%20Graham">Billy Graham</a> used Portman Road on part of his "Mission England Tour" in 1984.

The highest attendance recorded at Portman Road is 38,010 for a match against <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> sixth round on 8 March 1975.

Brie Larson

Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers (born October 1, 1989), known professionally as Brie Larson, is an American actress and filmmaker. Noted for her supporting work in comedies when a teenager, she has since expanded to leading roles in independent dramas and film franchises, receiving <a href="List%20of%20awards%20and%20nominations%20received%20by%20Brie%20Larson">such accolades</a> as an <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> and a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe</a>.

Born in <a href="Sacramento%2C%20California">Sacramento, California</a>, Larson was homeschooled. At age six, she became the youngest student admitted to a training program at the <a href="American%20Conservatory%20Theater">American Conservatory Theater</a>. She soon relocated to Los Angeles and began her acting career in 1998 with a <a href="sketch%20comedy">comedy sketch</a> in "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show%20with%20Jay%20Leno">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a>". She appeared as a regular in the 2001 sitcom "<a href="Raising%20Dad">Raising Dad</a>" and briefly dabbled with a music career, releasing the album "<a href="Finally%20Out%20of%20P.E.">Finally Out of P.E.</a>" in 2005. Larson subsequently played supporting roles in the comedy films "<a href="Hoot%20%28film%29">Hoot</a>" (2006), "<a href="Scott%20Pilgrim%20vs.%20the%20World">Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</a>" (2010), and "<a href="21%20Jump%20Street%20%28film%29">21 Jump Street</a>" (2012), and appeared as a sardonic teenager in the television series "<a href="United%20States%20of%20Tara">United States of Tara</a>" (2009–2011). Her breakthrough came with a leading role in the acclaimed independent drama "<a href="Short%20Term%2012">Short Term 12</a>" (2013), and she continued to take on supporting parts in the romance "<a href="The%20Spectacular%20Now">The Spectacular Now</a>" (2013) and the comedy "<a href="Trainwreck%20%28film%29">Trainwreck</a>" (2015). For playing a kidnapping victim in the drama "<a href="Room%20%282015%20film%29">Room</a>" (2015), Larson won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a>. The 2017 adventure film "" marked her first big-budget release, following which she starred as the <a href="Carol%20Danvers">titular superhero</a> in the <a href="Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> film "<a href="Captain%20Marvel%20%28film%29">Captain Marvel</a>" (2019).

Larson has also co-written and co-directed two short films, including "The Arm" (2012), which received a special jury prize at the <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a>. She made her feature film directorial debut in 2017 with the independent comedy-drama "<a href="Unicorn%20Store">Unicorn Store</a>". A gender equality activist and an advocate for sexual assault survivors, Larson is vocal about social and political issues.

Larson was born Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers on October 1, 1989, in <a href="Sacramento%2C%20California">Sacramento, California</a>, to Heather and Sylvain Desaulniers. Her parents were <a href="homeopathy">homeopathic</a> chiropractors who ran a practice together, and they had another daughter, Milaine. Her father is <a href="French%20Canadian">French Canadian</a> and in her childhood, Larson spoke French as her first language. She was mostly <a href="homeschool">homeschool</a>ed, which she believed allowed her to explore innovative and abstract experiences. Describing her early life, Larson has said that she was "straight-laced and square"; she shared a close bond with her mother but was shy and suffered from social anxiety. During the summer, she would write and direct her own home movies in which she cast her cousins and filmed in her garage. At age six, she expressed interest in becoming an actress, later remarking that the "creative arts was just something that was always in me". That same year, she auditioned for a training program at the <a href="American%20Conservatory%20Theater">American Conservatory Theater</a> in San Francisco, where she became the youngest student admitted.

Larson experienced trauma when her parents divorced when she was seven. She had a dysfunctional relationship with her father; she has recalled, "As a kid I tried to understand him and understand the situation. But he didn't do himself any favors. I don't think he ever really wanted to be a parent." Soon after their split, Heather relocated to Los Angeles with her two daughters to fulfill Larson's acting ambition. They had limited financial means and lived in a small apartment near Hollywood studio lots at <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank</a>. Larson described her experience, "We had a crappy one-room apartment where the bed came out of the wall and we each had three articles of clothing." Even so, Larson has recounted fond memories of that period and has credited her mother for doing the best she could for them.

As her last name was difficult to pronounce, she adopted the stage name Larson from her Swedish great-grandmother and an <a href="American%20Girl">American Girl</a> doll named <a href="Kirsten%20Larson">Kirsten Larson</a> that she received as a child. Her first job was performing a commercial parody for <a href="Barbie">Barbie</a>, named "Malibu Mudslide Barbie", in a 1998 episode of "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show%20with%20Jay%20Leno">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a>". She subsequently took on guest roles in several television series, including "<a href="Touched%20by%20an%20Angel">Touched by an Angel</a>" and "<a href="Popular%20%28TV%20series%29">Popular</a>". In 2000, she was cast in the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> sitcom "Schimmel", which was canceled before airing when its star, <a href="Robert%20Schimmel">Robert Schimmel</a>, was diagnosed with cancer.

Larson's first major role came as Emily, the younger daughter of <a href="Bob%20Saget">Bob Saget</a>'s character, in <a href="the%20WB">the WB</a> sitcom "<a href="Raising%20Dad">Raising Dad</a>", which aired for one season during the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20United%20States%20network%20television%20schedule">2001–02 television schedule</a>. Hal Boedeker of "<a href="Orlando%20Sentinel">Orlando Sentinel</a>" criticized the program and wrote that its cast members were "merrily joking through the show". She was next hired for the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> sitcom "<a href="Hope%20%26amp%3B%20Faith">Hope & Faith</a>", but she and some other cast members were replaced after an unaired <a href="television%20pilot">pilot</a>. In 2003, she starred alongside <a href="Beverley%20Mitchell">Beverley Mitchell</a> in the <a href="Disney%20Channel">Disney Channel</a> movie "<a href="Right%20on%20Track">Right on Track</a>", based on the junior <a href="drag%20race">drag race</a> star sisters <a href="Erica%20Enders-Stevens">Erica</a> and <a href="Courtney%20Enders">Courtney Enders</a>, and played minor roles in the 2004 comedies "<a href="Sleepover%20%28film%29">Sleepover</a>" and "<a href="13%20Going%20on%2030">13 Going on 30</a>".

Larson developed an interest in music at age 11 when she learned to play the guitar. A music executive encouraged her to write her own songs, and she began self-recording and uploading tracks to her own website. After failing to get cast as <a href="Wendy%20Darling">Wendy Darling</a> in the 2003 film "<a href="Peter%20Pan%20%282003%20film%29">Peter Pan</a>", a heartbroken Larson penned and recorded a song named "Invisible Girl", which received airplay on <a href="KIIS-FM">KIIS-FM</a>. She soon signed a recording deal with <a href="Tommy%20Mottola">Tommy Mottola</a> of <a href="Casablanca%20Records">Casablanca Records</a>; she and <a href="Lindsay%20Lohan">Lindsay Lohan</a> were the only artists signed by the label at that time. In 2005, she released the album "<a href="Finally%20Out%20of%20P.E.">Finally Out of P.E.</a>", in which she also co-wrote songs with other songwriters, including <a href="Blair%20Daly">Blair Daly</a>, <a href="Pam%20Sheyne">Pam Sheyne</a>, <a href="Lindy%20Robbins">Lindy Robbins</a>, and <a href="Skylar%20Grey">Holly Brook</a>. She named it after a gym teacher she disliked and has said that the songs she wrote were mostly about failed job opportunities. One of her <a href="single%20%28music%29">singles</a>, "She Said", was featured in the <a href="MTV">MTV</a> series "<a href="Total%20Request%20Live">Total Request Live</a>", was listed by "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" in their weekly listings of the most-played videos in the channel, and peaked at number 31 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot Single Sales</a>. Larson went on tour with <a href="Jesse%20McCartney">Jesse McCartney</a> for "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29%23Teen%20People">Teen People</a>"s "Rock in Shop" mall concerts, opened for him during his <a href="Beautiful%20Soul%20%28Jesse%20McCartney%20album%29">Beautiful Soul</a> tour, and also performed in New York City at the <a href="Macy%27s%20Thanksgiving%20Day%20Parade">Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade</a>. Even so, the album was not a success, selling only 3,500 copies. Larson later admitted to being disillusioned with her music career, saying, "I wanted to write all my own songs, and [the recording company] were afraid of that. I wanted to wear sneakers and play my guitar—they wanted heels and wind blown hair."

In 2006, Larson was cast alongside <a href="Logan%20Lerman">Logan Lerman</a> and <a href="Cody%20Linley">Cody Linley</a> in the comedy film "<a href="Hoot%20%28film%29">Hoot</a>", about young vigilantes trying to save a group of owls. It received poor reviews, but Ruthe Stein of "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" was appreciative of Larson and Linley for bringing "a dash of Indiana Jones to their roles". She had a small part, the following year, in the <a href="Amber%20Heard">Amber Heard</a>-starring drama "<a href="Remember%20the%20Daze">Remember the Daze</a>", and she launched an arts and literature magazine, named "Bunnies and Traps", for which she wrote her own opinion columns and accepted submissions from other artists and writers. Larson has said that she frequently considered giving up acting at that time, as she found it difficult to find much work, blaming it on filmmakers' inability to typecast her. She was particularly discouraged when she lost out on key roles in the films "<a href="Thirteen%20%282003%20film%29">Thirteen</a>" (2003) and "<a href="Juno%20%28film%29">Juno</a>" (2007). To support herself, Larson worked as a club DJ.

In 2009, Larson began playing Kate Gregson, the sardonic teenage daughter of <a href="Toni%20Collette">Toni Collette</a>'s character, coping with her mother's <a href="dissociative%20identity%20disorder">dissociative identity disorder</a>, in the <a href="Showtime%20%28TV%20network%29">Showtime</a> comedy-drama series "<a href="United%20States%20of%20Tara">United States of Tara</a>". <a href="Portia%20Doubleday">Portia Doubleday</a> was initially cast in the role but was replaced with Larson after filming the pilot episode. Reviewing the first season for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", Alessandra Stanley took note of how well Larson played a "real teenager" and Tim Goodman of "San Francisco Chronicle" credited her for finding nuance in her role. Larson has said that her character's journey to find meaning in life mirrored that of her own, and she was upset when the show was canceled after three seasons in 2011. Also in 2009, she starred alongside <a href="Rooney%20Mara">Rooney Mara</a> in "<a href="Tanner%20Hall%20%28film%29">Tanner Hall</a>", a coming-of-age film about four girls in boarding school. Despite disliking the film, Betsy Sharkey of "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" commended Larson for providing "one of the film's funniest bits". In her two other film releases that year, she played a scatterbrained cheerleader in "<a href="House%20Broken%20%282009%20film%29">House Broken</a>" and a popular high schooler in "<a href="Just%20Peck">Just Peck</a>".

At the <a href="Williamstown%20Theatre%20Festival">Williamstown Theatre Festival</a> in 2010, Larson appeared in a stage production of <a href="Thornton%20Wilder">Thornton Wilder</a>'s play "<a href="Our%20Town">Our Town</a>". Directed by Nicholas Martin, it featured her in the role of Emily Webb, a precocious young girl. Reviewing the play for "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>", Louise Kennedy thought that the production had glossed over the play's darker themes and bemoaned the lack of tragic arc in Larson's character. In film, she featured in <a href="Noah%20Baumbach">Noah Baumbach</a>'s comedy-drama "<a href="Greenberg%20%28film%29">Greenberg</a>" and <a href="Edgar%20Wright">Edgar Wright</a>'s comedy "<a href="Scott%20Pilgrim%20vs.%20the%20World">Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</a>". A journalist for "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>" opined that these films helped raise her profile, and Larson has said that the latter film, in which she played a rock star named Envy, marked a turning point in her career. In it, Larson performed the song "Black Sheep" with the band <a href="Metric%20%28band%29">Metric</a>. Although it did not do well commercially, "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" has since developed a cult following. She next played the troubled daughter of a corrupt cop (played by <a href="Woody%20Harrelson">Woody Harrelson</a>) in the drama "<a href="Rampart%20%28film%29">Rampart</a>" (2011), an emotionally intense part she found herself unable to detach from. A confrontation scene between Harrelson and her proved upsetting for her; the director was surprised by how well it turned out and tweaked the script to further explore the father-daughter relationship.

In 2012, Larson expanded into filmmaking by co-writing and co-directing the short film "The Arm" with Jessie Ennis and <a href="Sarah%20Ramos">Sarah Ramos</a>. The film, about societal expectations in the near future, won a special jury prize at the <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a>. She featured as a seductive teenager in the critically panned drama "<a href="The%20Trouble%20with%20Bliss">The Trouble with Bliss</a>", after which she played Molly, a high school student, in "<a href="21%20Jump%20Street%20%28film%29">21 Jump Street</a>", an adaptation of the 1980s police procedural <a href="21%20Jump%20Street">television series</a>, co-starring <a href="Jonah%20Hill">Jonah Hill</a> and <a href="Channing%20Tatum">Channing Tatum</a>. Larson found her acting style to be more rigid than Hill's approach and was challenged by scenes that required her to improvise with him. Dana Stevens of "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>" labeled Larson "a find of major proportions", adding that "she's not only beautiful but funny, with a scratchy contralto voice, and unlike the usual female in a buddy movie, she comes across as a real person". With worldwide earnings of over $200 million, "21 Jump Street" proved to be Larson's most widely seen film to that point.

Following an appearance in the sitcom "<a href="Community%20%28TV%20series%29">Community</a>", Larson collaborated with Dustin Bowser to co-write and co-direct "Weighting" (2013), a short film about a strained relationship, which was screened at <a href="South%20by%20Southwest">South by Southwest</a>. Larson's breakthrough came in the same year when she starred in <a href="Destin%20Daniel%20Cretton">Destin Daniel Cretton</a>'s critically acclaimed independent drama "<a href="Short%20Term%2012">Short Term 12</a>", which marked the first leading role of her career. Set in a foster-care home for troubled teenagers, the film featured her as Grace, the emotionally distressed supervisor of the institution. To prepare, Larson interacted with staff in a children's home and watched online interviews of people with similar jobs. The film had a production budget of under $1 million, and she was pleased with its intimate and collaborative work environment. Larson's performance was acclaimed. <a href="Manohla%20Dargis">Manohla Dargis</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" found her "terrific" and "completely persuasive", and <a href="Ian%20Freer">Ian Freer</a> felt that she "builds into a whirling dervish of a performance, making Grace strong but scarred, damaged but compassionate". Jenny McCartney of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" predicted that it would "[mark] her out for a stellar career". Larson received a nomination for the <a href="Independent%20Spirit%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Lead">Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead</a>; she later remarked that the film prompted directors to offer her a wide variety of parts, but she turned down roles of the unidimensional love interest.

Also in 2013, Larson had supporting roles in two romantic dramas, "<a href="Don%20Jon">Don Jon</a>" and "<a href="The%20Spectacular%20Now">The Spectacular Now</a>". In the former, written and directed by <a href="Joseph%20Gordon-Levitt">Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a>, she played the sister of Don Jon (played by Gordon-Levitt). <a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a> of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" praised the film's exploration of sexual themes and considered Larson to be "terrific" in it. In "The Spectacular Now", starring <a href="Miles%20Teller">Miles Teller</a> and <a href="Shailene%20Woodley">Shailene Woodley</a>, she was cast as Cassidy, the ex-girlfriend of Teller's character. Larson was drawn to the project due to the realism she found in its depiction of high school experiences. Writing for "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" magazine, <a href="David%20Edelstein">David Edelstein</a> called upon viewers to admire "the shading and intelligence she brings to Cassidy". The 2014 crime drama "<a href="The%20Gambler%20%282014%20film%29">The Gambler</a>", based on the 1974 <a href="The%20Gambler%20%281974%20film%29">film of the same name</a>, featured Larson as a literature student who has an affair with her professor (played by <a href="Mark%20Wahlberg">Mark Wahlberg</a>), a gambling addict. The director <a href="Rupert%20Wyatt">Rupert Wyatt</a> felt that the role was underwritten and cast Larson to lend heft to it. Even so, Claudia Puig of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" wrote that the "talented Larson is given little to do, other than react".

Larson had three film releases in 2015. Her first appearance was in "<a href="Digging%20for%20Fire">Digging for Fire</a>", a largely improvised ensemble comedy-drama featuring <a href="Jake%20Johnson">Jake Johnson</a> in the lead role. Filming took place without a script and Larson made several on-set decisions regarding her character's choices, including the removal of a planned romantic subplot involving her and Johnson. She next played the sister of <a href="Amy%20Schumer">Amy Schumer</a>'s character in the comedy "<a href="Trainwreck%20%28film%29">Trainwreck</a>", which was loosely based on Schumer's own life. Larson modeled her role on Schumer's sister, who served as an associate producer on the film. Tim Grierson of "<a href="Screen%20International">Screen International</a>" labeled the film "a deft blend of laughs, romance and poignancy" and found Larson to be "lively, [but] slightly underused". "Trainwreck" earned over $140 million against a $35 million budget.

Larson next starred in "<a href="Room%20%282015%20film%29">Room</a>", a film adapted from the <a href="Room%20%28novel%29">novel of the same name</a> by <a href="Emma%20Donoghue">Emma Donoghue</a>. It featured her as Ma, a young woman held in captivity, who bears a child of rape. The role was physically and emotionally taxing for her, and she modeled it on her mother's struggle as a single parent. A large portion of the film was shot inside a 10 ft x 10 ft shed created in a studio, and Larson prepared herself by spending a month isolated in her apartment. She interacted with specialists on sexual abuse and researched the lack of nutrition that a person in captivity would suffer. To achieve the look, she stayed away from sunlight, modified her diet, and exercised extensively to lose weight. Larson collaborated closely with <a href="Jacob%20Tremblay">Jacob Tremblay</a>, who played her son, and spent time performing activities that mirrored those of their characters. "Room" received acclaim, particularly for Larson and Tremblay's work. "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>"s <a href="Kenneth%20Turan">Kenneth Turan</a> called her performance "astonishing", adding that the "reality and preternatural commitment she brings to Ma is piercingly honest from start to finish, as scaldingly emotional a performance as anyone could wish for". She won several awards, including the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a>, as well as a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Motion%20Picture%20%E2%80%93%20Drama">Golden Globe</a> and <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">BAFTA</a> in the same category.

Following the success of "Room", Larson played a leading role in "<a href="Free%20Fire">Free Fire</a>" (2016), an action-comedy about a shootout in a warehouse. She agreed to the project to bring attention to <a href="gun%20violence">gun violence</a>. Eric Kohn of <a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a> remarked on how different Larson's role was from that of "Room" and added that her "businesslike demeanor once again proves her ability to command a scene with a single glare". Commercially, the film failed to recoup its $7 million investment. She had filmed a part in <a href="Todd%20Solondz">Todd Solondz</a>'s comedy "<a href="Wiener-Dog%20%28film%29">Wiener-Dog</a>", but it was cut out when Solondz found her character inessential to the story. The following year, Larson starred in the second installment of the <a href="MonsterVerse">MonsterVerse</a> franchise, entitled "", co-starring <a href="Samuel%20L.%20Jackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a> and <a href="Tom%20Hiddleston">Tom Hiddleston</a>. Filmed in Vietnam, the film featured her as a photojournalist in the 1970s. It marked her first big-budget project, and though she was glad to play a role not defined by her looks, she bemoaned the lack of female co-stars. <a href="Ann%20Hornaday">Ann Hornaday</a> of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" praised the film's visual effects and thought that "Larson manages to hold her own with very little to do". "Kong: Skull Island" was a commercial success, earning over $566 million worldwide.

Later in 2017, Larson portrayed <a href="Jeannette%20Walls">Jeannette Walls</a> in "<a href="The%20Glass%20Castle%20%28film%29">The Glass Castle</a>", an adaptation of Walls' <a href="The%20Glass%20Castle">memoir</a>, which reunited her with Destin Daniel Cretton. It tells the story of a young woman's relationship with her dysfunctional and nonconformist parents (played by Woody Harrelson and <a href="Naomi%20Watts">Naomi Watts</a>). Larson was attracted to the complex depiction of a parent-child relationship and identified with its theme of forgiveness. She collaborated closely with Walls and her siblings and observed their mannerisms. <a href="Peter%20Bradshaw">Peter Bradshaw</a> of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" disliked the film's sentimentality but noted that "it is saved, just a little, by the robustness of Brie Larson's presence". Larson made her feature film directorial debut with the comedy-drama "<a href="Unicorn%20Store">Unicorn Store</a>", in which she also starred. She played a disillusioned art student who becomes fascinated with unicorns. Larson had unsuccessfully auditioned in 2012 to star in the film when <a href="Miguel%20Arteta">Miguel Arteta</a> was attached to direct. After the production was stalled, Larson was offered to direct and star in it. She was drawn towards the fanciful narrative and found a connection between her character's journey and her experience as a director. Peter Debruge of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" labeled it a "creative misfire" and found her "directing style [to be] entirely incompatible with whimsy". Larson's final appearance that year was in the India-set musical romance "<a href="Basmati%20Blues">Basmati Blues</a>", a project she had filmed back in 2013, which received criticism on social media for its <a href="White%20savior%20narrative%20in%20film">white savior narrative</a>.

After a year-long absence from the screen, Larson starred as <a href="Carol%20Danvers">Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel</a> in the <a href="Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> superhero film "<a href="Captain%20Marvel%20%28film%29">Captain Marvel</a>" (2019), which marked <a href="Marvel%20Studios">Marvel Studios</a>' first female-led film. Initially skeptical about taking on such a high-profile role, she agreed after viewing it as a platform to empower young women and found a connection with her character's flaws and humanity. In preparation, she underwent nine months of physical training in judo, boxing, and wrestling, and interacted with servicemen at the <a href="Nellis%20Air%20Force%20Base">Nellis Air Force Base</a>. <a href="Stephanie%20Zacharek">Stephanie Zacharek</a> of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" wrote that "Larson, a perceptive, low-key actor, carries the whole affair capably" and took note of how much she stood out in the film's quieter moments; David Sims of "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>" bemoaned the lack of depth in her role but commended the actress for effectively portraying her character's struggle for independence from authoritarian men. "Captain Marvel" earned over $760 million worldwide to emerge as Larson's highest-grossing release.

Larson will next reprise the role of Danvers in "", after which she will team with Destin Daniel Cretton for the third time in "<a href="Just%20Mercy">Just Mercy</a>", an adaptation of <a href="Bryan%20Stevenson">Bryan Stevenson</a>'s memoir of the same name, co-starring <a href="Michael%20B.%20Jordan">Michael B. Jordan</a>. She will serve as the producer and star as <a href="Victoria%20Woodhull">Victoria Woodhull</a>, the first female presidential candidate in American history, in an eponymous biopic produced by <a href="Amazon%20Studios">Amazon Studios</a>. Larson has also committed to star in an <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Inc.</a> drama series based on the life of <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</a> agent Amaryllis Fox, and in two films for <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a>: "Lady Business", about challenges faced by female entrepreneurs, and "I’m Thinking of Ending Things", based on <a href="Iain%20Reid">Iain Reid</a>'s debut novel of the same name.

Larson is a gender equality activist and an advocate for sexual assault survivors. She uses her celebrity to speak on political and social issues, saying, "I'd put it all on the line and be an activist for the rest of my life because it doesn't feel right to me to be quiet". Following a performance by <a href="Lady%20Gaga">Lady Gaga</a> at the <a href="88th%20Academy%20Awards">88th Academy Awards</a>, in which several survivors of sexual abuse appeared with the singer, Larson hugged all of them as they exited the stage. At the <a href="89th%20Academy%20Awards">following year's ceremony</a>, Larson presented <a href="Casey%20Affleck">Casey Affleck</a> with the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Best Actor Award</a>, but due to sexual harassment allegations against him in the past, she did not clap for him during a standing ovation from the audience; she later stated that her action spoke for itself. In 2018, she collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the <a href="Time%27s%20Up%20%28movement%29">Time's Up</a> initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination. In the same year, she became one of the first actors to incorporate an <a href="inclusion%20rider">inclusion rider</a> provision in her film and press tour contracts. Her reasoning for this, in which she complained about being interviewed mainly by white men, led to an attempt at <a href="review%20bombing">review bombing</a> "Captain Marvel" page on <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> with negative comments.

In 2014, Larson teamed with Alia Penner to launch Women of Cinefamily, a monthly program to bring attention to films directed by and starring women, for the non-profit cinematheque <a href="Cinefamily">Cinefamily</a>, in which Larson served as an advisory board member. Following allegations of sexual assault against two of the company's male executives, she issued a statement in support of the victims and asked for action to be taken against the men. Larson became a member of the <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> in 2016, and was later among the finalists for the organization's board of governors. In 2017, she was one of several celebrities to raise funds for the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20%26amp%3B%20Television%20Fund">Motion Picture & Television Fund</a>, a charity that offers assistance to elderly members of the industry, and co-hosted an event for the <a href="Women%20in%20Film%20and%20Television%20International">Women in Film</a> organization, during which she urged filmmakers to be vocal against the <a href="presidency%20of%20Donald%20Trump">presidency of Donald Trump</a>. She took part in the <a href="2017%20Women%27s%20March">Women's March on Washington</a> and criticized Trump's policies on <a href="Transgender%20rights%20in%20the%20United%20States">transgender rights</a>. At the <a href="Women%20in%20Film%20Crystal%20%2B%20Lucy%20Awards">Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards</a> in 2018, where she was honored, Larson bemoaned the lack of diversity among film reporters and called for better representation of minority voices in film criticism. She announced a 20 percent quota for underrepresented journalists at the Sundance and <a href="Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a>. In 2019, Larson served as a guest editor for "<a href="Stylist%20%28magazine%29">Stylist</a>" magazine, and used the platform to bring attention to diversity and social inclusion.

Larson is reticent to discuss her personal life and declines to answer questions in interviews that make her uncomfortable. When asked about her desire to be private, she has said that she fears being judged for her flaws and has added that the privacy allows her to play a wide variety of parts without being typecast. Larson began dating <a href="Alex%20Greenwald">Alex Greenwald</a>, a musician and lead singer of the band <a href="Phantom%20Planet">Phantom Planet</a>, in 2013, and they were engaged from 2016 to 2019. The couple cohabited in <a href="Hollywood%20Hills">Hollywood Hills</a>, Los Angeles. She had credited Greenwald for creating a <a href="safe%20space">safe space</a> for her and for empowering her to take risks in her work. Larson maintains an active <a href="social%20media">social media</a> presence and uses it as a platform to share opinions and uplifting posts written by herself.

Describing Larson's off-screen persona, Holly Millea of "<a href="Elle%20%28magazine%29">Elle</a>" wrote in 2016 that she "carries herself like an athlete, lean and solid, surefooted [and] yet her energy is warm and familial, literally embracing". Anne Helen Petersen of <a href="BuzzFeed">BuzzFeed</a> considers her to be "incredibly warm" and adds that she is "a serious nerd, with the endlessly tunneling knowledge of a homeschooler". Jennifer Dickison of "<a href="YOOX%20Net-a-Porter%20Group">Porter</a>" writes that Larson's "fully formed" personality made it difficult to categorize her into a conventional slot.

Larson has said that she is interested in films that illustrate the "human condition" and which "make people feel more connected to themselves [and] the rest of the world". She is drawn to parts that differ from her own personality and which involve themes of social activism. The journalist Fan Zhong of "<a href="W%20%28magazine%29">W</a>" has identified a theme of "sex appeal, inner torment, and a quick, playful wit" in her characters. Her "Room" director <a href="Lenny%20Abrahamson">Lenny Abrahamson</a> believes that her craft has "none of that showy intensity that sometimes gets all the attention" and has said that her "awareness of tougher lives" empowers her performances. Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed her in "Short Term 12" and "The Glass Castle", has praised her ability to improvise, saying, "I never know what's going to happen, and often "she" doesn't know what's going to happen." In 2016, Larson was featured by "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" in their <a href="Forbes%2030%20Under%2030">30 Under 30</a> list and was included by "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" magazine in their <a href="People%20%28magazine%29%23100%20Most%20Beautiful%20People">annual beauty list</a>. In 2018, she was named among the best American actors under 30 by <a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a>.

According to the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes and the box-office site <a href="Box%20Office%20Mojo">Box Office Mojo</a>, Larson's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful films are "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" (2010), "21 Jump Street" (2012), "Short Term 12" (2013), "Don Jon" (2013), "The Spectacular Now" (2013), "Trainwreck" (2015), "Room" (2015), "Kong: Skull Island" (2017), and "Captain Marvel" (2019). She has received an <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>, a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a>, a <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award">Screen Actors Guild Award</a>, and a <a href="British%20Academy%20Film%20Award">British Academy Film Award</a>, among other accolades, for her performance in "Room".

Arthur Gilligan

Arthur Edward Robert Gilligan (23 December 1894 – 5 September 1976) was an English <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a>er who captained <a href="England%20cricket%20team">the England cricket team</a> nine times in 1924 and 1925, winning four <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a>, losing four and drawing one. In first-class cricket, he played as an <a href="Amateur%20status%20in%20first-class%20cricket">amateur</a>, mainly for <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge University</a> and <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a>, and captained the latter team between 1922 and 1929. A <a href="Fast%20bowling%23Categorisation%20of%20fast%20bowling">fast bowler</a> and hard-hitting <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Lower%20order%20or%20tail">lower order</a> batsman, Gilligan completed the <a href="double%20%28cricket%29">double</a> in 1923 and was one of <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">"Wisden's"</a> <a href="Wisden%20Cricketer%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a> for 1924. When his playing career ended, he held several important positions in cricket, including that of England selector and president of the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC). A popular figure within cricket, he was widely regarded as sporting and friendly. During his playing days, Gilligan was a member of the <a href="British%20Fascists">British Fascists</a>. He came to the notice of the Australian secret service during the 1924–25 MCC tour, and it is possible he helped to establish small fascist groups in Australia. It is unknown how long he remained a member, but the organisation practically ceased to exist by 1926.

Gilligan played cricket for <a href="Dulwich%20College">Dulwich College</a> before the First World War, then for Cambridge, twice winning his <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">blue</a>. He briefly played <a href="County%20Championship">county cricket</a> for <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> but moved to Sussex in 1920. Following a slow start to his county career, he rapidly improved and in partnership with <a href="Maurice%20Tate">Maurice Tate</a> established a formidable bowling reputation. First playing for England in 1922, he was appointed Test captain in 1924. In the latter year, Gilligan was at the height of his form when he suffered a blow to his heart while batting. The strain affected his bowling, which was never again as effective, but he still captained England in Australia during the 1924–25 season. The series was lost, but both he and his team were popular and respected. In following years, he played less frequently; he resigned as Sussex captain in 1929 and retired three years later. He subsequently became a writer, journalist and cricket commentator while maintaining his connections with Sussex.

As a captain, Gilligan was well-liked by players and commentators, although many did not believe he was an effective tactician. Nevertheless, under his leadership, Sussex became an attractive, competitive team. He encouraged the search for young talent, and the players consequently discovered became the backbone of the club into the 1930s. As a fielder, he inspired his teams to become good fielding sides. In addition, as MCC captain of a team which toured India in 1926–27, he encouraged Indians to take responsibility for their own cricket board instead of allowing white Englishmen to run Indian cricket, and lobbied the MCC to bestow Test match status on the Indian team. As MCC president, he played a part in the <a href="D%27Oliveira%20affair">D'Oliveira affair</a> in 1968. He died in 1976, aged 81.

Gilligan was born in <a href="Denmark%20Hill">Denmark Hill</a>, an area of <a href="Camberwell">Camberwell</a> in London. He was the second of three sons, all of whom played first-class cricket, to Willie Austin Gilligan and Alice Eliza Kimpton. The family had a strong connection with Sussex; Gilligan followed <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex County Cricket Club</a> as a child, and later played club cricket there. After attending Fairfield School, he was educated at <a href="Dulwich%20College">Dulwich College</a> from 1906 until 1914 where he established a sporting reputation in athletics and cricket. In the latter sport, he played in the school <a href="first%20eleven">first eleven</a>, as did his brothers; in 1913, all three boys played in the team. Gilligan played in the eleven between 1911 and 1914 and captained the side in his final two years. In 1914, he came top of the school <a href="Batting%20average%23Cricket">batting</a> and <a href="Bowling%20average">bowling</a> averages. Selected to play representative schools cricket at <a href="Lord%27s%20Cricket%20Ground">Lord's Cricket Ground</a> in 1914, he took ten wickets in total and scored one fifty in the two matches. By the standards of school cricket, his pace was impressive, and <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> invited him to play for their second eleven during the school holidays of 1913 and 1914; his father was a member of that county's committee, and Gilligan qualified to play through his London birth.

In 1914, Gilligan entered <a href="Pembroke%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Pembroke College, Cambridge</a>, but his life at the university was interrupted by the First World War. He fought in France with the <a href="Lancashire%20Fusiliers">Lancashire Fusiliers</a> from 1915, serving as <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">Captain</a> in the 11th battalion. When the war ended, Gilligan returned to Pembroke and resumed his cricket career.

Following the war, Cambridge University suffered from a lack of quality bowling at the start of the 1919 cricket season. Consequently, Gilligan faced little competition for his place in the team and took 32 wickets at an average of under 27 in Cambridge matches, which critics considered a poor return. He made a bigger impression when, batting at <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Lower%20order%20or%20tail">number eleven in the order</a>, he scored 101 against Sussex and shared a last-wicket <a href="Partnership%20%28cricket%29">partnership</a> of 177 in 65 minutes with <a href="John%20Naumann">John Naumann</a>. A few days later, Gilligan won his <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">blue</a>—the awarding of the Cambridge "colours" to sportsmen—by appearing in the <a href="The%20University%20Match%20%28cricket%29">University Match</a> against <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford</a>. On the last day of the three-day match, he took five wickets for 16 runs in 57 <a href="Delivery%20%28cricket%29">deliveries</a> to finish with bowling figures of six for 52 (six wickets taken for 52 runs conceded). According to "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>", this was the best bowling performance in the University Match for many years, although Cambridge lost the match. Towards the end of the season, Gilligan played three first-class matches for Surrey and made a further appearance in a festival game, although he accomplished little with bat or ball. In all first-class games in 1919, he scored 231 runs at a batting average of 17.76 and took 35 wickets at 31.57. At the end of the season, he changed counties; his family connections in the area, and the presence of his brother <a href="Harold%20Gilligan">Harold</a> in the team, led him to register with Sussex.

Gilligan retained his position in the Cambridge team in 1920 and once more played against Oxford. In the University Match, he was ineffective with the ball as the damp conditions did not suit his style of bowling. At the end of the Cambridge term, Gilligan, playing as an <a href="Amateur%20status%20in%20first-class%20cricket">amateur</a>, made his Sussex debut. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" later commented that in 1920, Gilligan was "known as a fast but unreliable bowler, a dashing and vulnerable batsman and a mid-off without his equal in England". "Wisden" commented on his 1920 performance: "[He] remained stationary, doing nothing out of the common either as bowler or batsman for Cambridge, and proving a decidedly expensive bowler for Sussex". In all first-class cricket, he scored 624 runs at an average of 17.33 and took 81 wickets at 23.55. Subsequently, Gilligan left Cambridge and joined Gilbert Kimpton & Co., a general produce merchants in London in which his father was a senior partner.

Gilligan played for Sussex throughout the 1921 season and according to "Wisden" "made a distinct advance". His batting record was similar to the previous season, although he increased his number of wickets in the season to 90 at an average of 30.64. "Wisden" notes that his bowling was not statistically good, but that his biggest impact came in fielding, which was "brilliant in the extreme. He was described on all hands as the best mid-off in England." In 1922, Gilligan assumed the Sussex captaincy from <a href="Herbert%20Wilson%20%28Sussex%20cricketer%29">Herbert Wilson</a>. The team's results were not impressive, but "Wisden" said that the team were attractive to watch and excelled in fielding, in which Gilligan led by example. Gilligan later recalled that he received great support from <a href="George%20Cox%2C%20Sr.">George Cox</a>, the senior professional in the team. Personally, Gilligan had his best season to date with bat and ball; he scored 916 runs and took 135 wickets at an average of 18.75. Based on his good form, he was selected in the prestigious <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">Gentlemen v Players</a> match at Lord's. Appearing for the Gentlemen, a team of amateurs, his fielding in particular impressed commentators. He was selected in a further representative match, when he played for the "Rest of England" against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>, the <a href="County%20Championship">County Champions</a>. In the latter game, he took eight wickets in total. At the end of the season, Gilligan was included in the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) team to tour South Africa and play a Test series.

On the tour of South Africa, MCC were led by <a href="Frank%20Mann%20%28cricketer%29">Frank Mann</a>. Gilligan was appointed as vice-captain in preference to <a href="Percy%20Fender">Percy Fender</a>, who was much admired as a captain but not popular with the cricket authorities. Gilligan played in two of the five Tests, the first and last. His Test debut came on 23 December 1922 in a match which England lost. The team were more successful during his second appearance; he took six wickets in the match, and his batting at a crucial stage of the match—he scored 39 not out in the second innings—was vital in a victory which gave the series to England 2–1. In total, Gilligan took nine Test wickets at 22.37, and in all first-class games, captured 26 wickets at an average of 22.03.

During 1923, after returning to England, Gilligan had his best season in county cricket. He took 163 wickets at 17.50 and scored 1,183 runs at an average of 21.12 to complete the <a href="Double%20%28cricket%29">double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in a season</a> for the only time in his career. With <a href="Maurice%20Tate">Maurice Tate</a>, whose emergence as a pace bowler was encouraged by Gilligan, he established a bowling partnership which proved effective over the following two seasons. Gilligan scored two centuries and nine times took five or more wickets in an innings. As a result of his performances, he was named as one of "Wisden's" <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a>. The citation noted that he was now "among the leading amateur cricketers of the day", and was likely to play for England again. It concluded: "It is not claimed for Arthur Gilligan, by even his warmest admirers, that he can be classed among great fast bowlers, but he is a very good one, combining with the right temperament and tireless energy just the extra bit of pace that to many batsmen is so distasteful."

Following heavy losses to Australia in two Test series immediately following the war, the England selectors needed to appoint a new captain. Frank Mann led the team during the tour of South Africa, the team's only Tests between 1921 and 1924. According to the cricket writer <a href="Alan%20Gibson">Alan Gibson</a>, Mann was slightly too old to be a realistic candidate and his batting was not quite of the required standard. Other possibilities early in the season included Fender and <a href="Arthur%20Carr%20%28cricketer%29">Arthur Carr</a>. Instead, the selectors appointed Gilligan as captain for the 1924 series against South Africa, in an attempt to assess whether he possessed the playing ability to justify his selection in the role. Cricket journalist <a href="E.%20W.%20Swanton">E. W. Swanton</a> writes that Gilligan was the favoured candidate of the influential <a href="George%20Harris%2C%204th%20Baron%20Harris">Lord Harris</a>, which may have assisted his appointment. Gibson describes Gilligan at the time as "29 years old, an attractive, smiling personality". Gilligan began the season very well. He and Tate, in the weeks approaching the first Test, established a reputation as the best opening bowlers in the world. At the time, the best batting teams in England were Surrey and <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a>; in consecutive matches, Gilligan and Tate dismissed these sides for 53 and 41 respectively. In the latter game, Gilligan took eight for 25, and he and Tate bowled several county sides out for low scores. In the first Test match, on Gilligan's debut as England captain, the pair bowled South Africa out for 30 runs. Gilligan took six wickets for seven runs, and "Wisden" reported that "He bowled very fast and with any amount of fire. Three times during the innings he took a wicket immediately after sending down a no ball". When South Africa <a href="Follow-on">followed-on</a>, he took five for 83, to finish the game with 11 wickets. England won the second Test, like the first, <a href="Result%20%28cricket%29%23Statement%20of%20result">by an innings</a>; Gilligan took five wickets in the game, and by the end of June had 74 wickets in all first-class matches at an average of 15. At this stage, the press and public had great expectations of success for Gilligan and Tate on the forthcoming tour of Australia.

At the beginning of July, Gilligan played for the Gentlemen against the Players at <a href="the%20Oval">the Oval</a>. In the first innings, he was struck heavily over his heart by a delivery from <a href="Frederick%20Pearson%20%28cricketer%29">Frederick Pearson</a>; it was obvious that he was hurt, and he was out shortly afterwards. Although the Gentlemen v Players match at the Oval was less prestigious than its Lord's counterpart and generally mattered less to participants, Gilligan chose to bat the next day and scored a century batting at number 10. Even so, the Gentlemen lost the game by six wickets. Gilligan was never again as effective a cricketer, and he later conceded that batting in the second innings was a mistake. It is likely that the strain of the innings did as much harm as the original blow, although Gibson later wrote that Gilligan's subsequent long life suggests that he was not too badly hurt, and that it is unlikely too much damage was done. Nevertheless, Gibson concludes "there is no doubt that he was badly shaken up, and whatever the reason, the magic departed".

Gilligan played in the next Test match, without much success, and for the Gentlemen at Lord's. The effects of the injury then forced him to rest in the following weeks and he missed the fourth Test. When he returned for the final Test, he did not take any wickets and finished the Test series with 17 wickets at an average of 18.94, placing him second in the England bowling averages behind Tate. He batted just three times in the series, scoring 77 runs at 25.66. England won the series 3–0, and although South Africa had not proved to be a strong team, several England players—including Gilligan—had impressed commentators. Gilligan continued to take wickets in the latter stages of the season, but was less successful than before his injury. At the end of the season, he had 103 wickets at 19.36 and 864 runs at 21.07.

By mid-July, Gilligan had been named as captain of the MCC team to tour Australia at the end of the English cricket season, and was expected to be one of the leading bowlers. He had, however, faced some criticism of his captaincy. Two players in the England team during the South Africa series spoke out against his tactics: <a href="Cec%20Parkin">Cec Parkin</a> published a highly critical article in the press and never played for England again; <a href="George%20Macaulay">George Macaulay</a> clashed with Gilligan on the field during one Test. The consequent absence of both men from the tour substantially weakened the bowling strength of the team. Although Gilligan was generally popular for his cheerful and friendly approach, the press believed Fender to be the better captain. However, the cricket authorities at Lord's disapproved of Fender's unconventional tactics and approach. Journalists later revealed that, at some point in the season, the selectors had first asked Frank Mann to captain, but he was unable to accept the invitation.

Following his injury in 1924, Gilligan could no longer bowl fast and, as a player, had little influence on the 1924–25 tour of Australia; his performances were hampered by further injuries. His best bowling figures of four for 12 came in the opening match and his only century came in the second game; he passed fifty just once more on the tour. His leadership proved influential in one main respect. In previous series, Australia had been superior to England in the field, but according to Gibson, Gilligan "revolutionized the English fielding, a department in which they began to compare with Australia, for the first time since the war and possibly since the early 1900s. This had much effect on the England sides of the next few years". However an Australian newspaper estimated that England dropped 21 catches in the five Tests, which may have impacted on the series result; Australia won 4–1. Other aspects of Gilligan's leadership were less successful; his captaincy lacked tactical sophistication, and the Australian captain <a href="Herbie%20Collins">Herbie Collins</a> proved superior in this respect. According to Gibson, critics claimed that Gilligan "was too easygoing on the finer points of law". In addition, his inexperience led to defeat in one warm-up match that the MCC could have drawn, and commentators dismissed him as naive and easy-going on the field. However, he was immensely popular with the Australian public and well-liked by his team. Gibson, writing in 1979, noted that Gilligan "was, and is, one of the most popular captains England have sent to Australia". During the tour, Gilligan was the focus of a great deal of publicity. The periodical "Cricket" described him as "'one of the most jovial personalities imaginable", while former Australian Test captain <a href="Monty%20Noble">Monty Noble</a> wrote that Gilligan was the "type of man who, in the most unostentatious way, can do more than all the politicians and statesmen to cement the relations between the Homeland and the Dominions". His sportsmanship, including his grace and cheerfulness in defeat, made him, according to Noble, a perfect English gentleman and an "Empire builder".

After Australia won the first two Tests, Parkin, writing in England, once more criticised Gilligan's leadership in the press and provoked a minor controversy by suggesting that <a href="Jack%20Hobbs">Jack Hobbs</a> should assume the captaincy. The third Test was much closer, although England were severely hampered by injuries to three bowlers, including Gilligan himself. These injuries may have affected the outcome of the series. Australia won by the small margin of 11 runs, though Gilligan helped to take his team close to victory with a restrained innings of 31. England won the fourth Test, their first victory over Australia since the war, but lost the final game. Critics judged that the team played well and did not suffer disgrace, despite the result. Gibson notes that the tour "was successful in everything but victory, and this was sensed by the English public, who assembled in large numbers to welcome the side home". In the Test series, Gilligan took 10 wickets at an average of 51.90 and scored 64 runs at 9.14. Gibson judges that most of his wickets were good batsmen, and many bowlers had poor figures in a series that produced a large number of runs, so this record is not as poor as it appears. In all first-class games on tour, Gilligan took 28 wickets at 38.39 and scored 357 runs at 17.85. He did not play in any more Tests.

The MCC tour took place against a background of social disturbance in Australia. There were concerns within Australian society over the growing influence of communism and, according to the historian Andrew Moore, some commentators hoped that the tour would help to ease tension. It was expected that Gilligan's influence and popularity would further assist this process. However, during the tour, the Australian secret service were informed by the London authorities that Gilligan and the MCC tour manager <a href="Frederick%20Toone">Frederick Toone</a> were members of the <a href="British%20Fascists">British Fascists</a>. Although the organisation never achieved the same level of influence in Britain as the <a href="British%20Union%20of%20Fascists">British Union of Fascists</a>, which formed in 1932, the British Fascists were popular for a short time during the mid-1920s. The primary focus of the organisation was to oppose communism, but <a href="MI5">MI5</a> considered its threat serious enough to warrant placing leading members under surveillance. In addition, the <a href="Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office">British Foreign Office</a> were aware that the British Fascists had established some links overseas. Moore suggests that it is possible that Gilligan and Toone used the tour as an opportunity to establish links in Australia. The team visited many parts of Australia and attended many social events which presented an opportunity to discuss politics. Shortly after the tour's conclusion, the <a href="Commonwealth%20Police">Commonwealth Investigative Branch</a> uncovered evidence that the British Fascists had established chapters in several Australian cities, although they did not know how this had happened. Moore believes that "it may be totally coincidental that the Australian chapter of the British Fascists was established so soon after the MCC tour", but is more likely that Gilligan and Toone brought Fascist literature to Australia for distribution. However, Moore writes that "the British Fascists' Australian operations were small beer indeed" and of little consequence.

Gilligan gave further evidence of his political beliefs at the conclusion of the tour, when he wrote an article called "The Spirit of Fascism and Cricket Tours" for "The Bulletin", a publication of the British Fascists. He wrote: "'In ... cricket tours it is essential to work solely on the lines of Fascism, i.e. the team must be good friends and out for one thing, and one thing only, namely the good of the side, and not for any self-glory". Moore judges that the article was neither well written nor particularly persuasive, but notes that other writers at the time made the connection between sport, cricket, the ideology of the British Empire and Fascism.

There is no evidence to say how long Gilligan maintained his connection with the British Fascists after the tour, nor if he did so at all. By 1926, the organisation had split and faded from view.

A recurrence of the effects of his injury in 1924 restricted Gilligan's cricket in 1925. Appearing in fewer games and bowling far less frequently than in previous seasons, he scored 542 runs at 15.05 and took only eight wickets. He bowled in the first four games of the season, but in his remaining seventeen appearances played only as a batsman. In 1926, he was more successful and his performances helped Sussex to rise from thirteenth to tenth in the County Championship. Playing more games, he scored 1,037 runs at 30.50, the highest seasonal batting average of his career, and took 75 wickets at 20.74. That season, although no longer considered for a place in the England team himself, Gilligan joined the panel of Test selectors, and as a consequence missed some cricket for Sussex. He published a book on that summer's tour by Australia called "Collins's Men".

During the winter of 1926–27, with other candidates unavailable, Gilligan was chosen to captain an MCC team which toured India; the side was not fully representative and did not play Test matches. In first-class games, he scored three fifties and, bowling infrequently, took ten wickets on the tour. The team, the first to tour India under the colours of the MCC, was very successful. Gilligan left most of the day-to-day organisation to his vice-captain, <a href="Raleigh%20Chichester-Constable">Raleigh Chichester-Constable</a>, and did not take his speech-making duties particularly seriously. He nevertheless had several issues to deal with. One of his players, <a href="Jack%20Parsons%20%28cricketer%29">Jack Parsons</a>, refused for religious reasons to play in any matches in which play took place on a Sunday; Gilligan threatened to send him home but in the end he agreed to play on condition that he could leave early on a Sunday to attend religious services. Parsons was also openly critical of racial and social discrimination that he saw. Gilligan intervened at one point when his team's professionals were excluded from some invitations in <a href="Kolkata">Calcutta</a> and told their hosts that no-one would attend the functions if the professionals were not included. Both the sporting and social programmes for the tour were demanding, and Gilligan wanted to attend most functions for fear of offending the European or Indian hosts. The members of the team were left exhausted, necessitating the use of reinforcements to their number, including the occasional use of English cricketers who were coaching in India, and on several occasions, the <a href="Bhupinder%20Singh%20of%20Patiala">Maharajah of Patiala</a>, who was a member of the MCC and entitled to play.

The tour was originally conceived to encourage cricket-playing Europeans living in India. But as it was financed by the Maharajah of Patiala, the team played Indian sides, rather than the European sides envisaged by the tour's organisers. Gilligan, in contrast to many Englishmen, was happy to play Indian teams and actively encouraged Indians to organise their own cricket rather than leave it up to white Englishmen. According to the cricket writer <a href="Mihir%20Bose">Mihir Bose</a>, Gilligan, unlike others, "met Indians on terms of perfect equality". He successfully encouraged the Indians to form their own cricket board and promised to make a case with the Lord's authorities for India to become a Test playing team. He did so, and in 1929 India became a member of the <a href="International%20Cricket%20Conference">Imperial Cricket Conference</a>. Bose points out that Gilligan's positive attitude towards Indians, and that of the MCC when granting India Test status, was markedly different from that of most Englishmen. In terms of the advancement of Indian cricket, Bose writes that "Gilligan's influence was immense".

Gilligan continued to play for Sussex until 1932. In 1927, he scored 828 runs at 27.60, but did not bowl in the first half of the season and took just 29 wickets at 24.65. The following season, he scored 942 runs at 26.91, including his last first-class century, and took 76 wickets at 26.27. In 1929, his final season as captain, he played only 12 times; he did not score a fifty, averaged 7.22 with the bat and took four wickets. He was frequently affected by injury; his brother <a href="Harold%20Gilligan">Harold</a> captained Sussex in his absence and assumed the role full-time in 1930. Harold also took over as captain of an MCC team which toured New Zealand in the winter of 1929–30 when Gilligan withdrew owing to illness. Over the next three seasons, Gilligan appeared intermittently for Sussex and the MCC, but scored only one fifty and took just five wickets in total in that time. His last first-class appearance was for <a href="H.%20D.%20G.%20Leveson%20Gower">H. D. G. Leveson Gower</a>'s team against Oxford in 1932. He later played several charity games during the Second World War, including some for Sussex and for the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>. In all first-class cricket, Gilligan scored 9,140 runs at an average of 20.08 and took 868 wickets at 23.30. In 11 Test matches, he scored 209 runs at an average of 16.07 and took 36 wickets at 29.05, although 26 of these wickets came in the five Tests he played before his injury. As captain in nine Tests, he won four matches and lost four; the remaining game was drawn.

At the peak of his career, Gilligan was a fast bowler. He bowled with his arm quite low, but was very accurate; his usual strategy was to aim at the <a href="Stump%20%28cricket%29%23Part%20of%20the%20wicket">stumps</a> or to try to induce the batsmen to <a href="Edge%20%28cricket%29">edge</a> the ball to be caught in the <a href="Slip%20%28cricket%29">slips</a>. According to his "Wisden" obituary, he "regarded it as a cardinal sin to bowl short". Following his injury, he could not reach his former speed and was reduced to <a href="Fast%20bowling%23Categorisation%20of%20fast%20bowling">medium pace</a>. In this style, he continued to have some success at county level. His batting was based mainly around <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">driving the ball</a>. He batted low in the order, and tried to score quickly, particularly against fast bowling. Several of his centuries were scored against the most successful teams, and often in difficult situations. He excelled as a fielder; his "Wisden" obituary stated: "At mid-off he has had few rivals".

As a captain, Gilligan was not tactically sophisticated but was adept at inspiring his players. His Sussex teams were not consistent but became attractive to watch; under Gilligan's direction the team ranked among the best fielding sides in England. The <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Off%20and%20leg%20side%20fields">off side</a> fielders were nicknamed the "ring of iron". His "Wisden" obituary stated: "In two or three seasons by his insistence on fielding and on attacking cricket and by his own superb example he raised Sussex from being nothing in particular to one of the biggest draws in England." According to "The Times", Gilligan's captaincy laid the foundations for the county's relative success in the 1930s. In the official history of Sussex, writer Christopher Lee suggests: "The ten years from 1920 to the end of Gilligan's captaincy in 1930 saw the blooding of some of the most famous names in Sussex and England cricket. Gilligan himself was a mixture of amateur brilliance and professional thoroughness which inevitably brought about criticism."

Gilligan also extensively coached and lectured around the county, spending time in the English winters raising the team's profile. He encouraged the search for promising young cricketers, and most of the club's professional cricketers during its successful years in the 1930s were discovered during Gilligan's drive for new talent. Percy Fender believed that Gilligan allowed the team's professionals a greater say in Sussex's affairs than previously permitted. Fender wrote that Gilligan's teams enjoyed playing under him and that Gilligan was one of the most popular captains in county cricket. Cricket writer <a href="R.%20C.%20Robertson-Glasgow">R. C. Robertson-Glasgow</a> said: "With him there was no sharpnesses, no petty restraints, no mathematical cricket. He won or lost plumb straight". Swanton wrote that "Gilligan was essentially a friendly man, hail-fellow-well-met, and it is hard to think that in the world of sport he ever made an enemy."

Gilligan married his first wife, Cecilia Mary Matthews, in April 1921, but she successfully filed for divorce in October 1933 on the grounds of her husband's infidelity. He married again in 1934; he met his second wife, Katharine Margaret Fox, on a skiing trip.

Following his retirement from cricket, Gilligan began to work in journalism. He wrote several cricket books, including a history of Sussex cricket in 1932. He became one of the first radio cricket commentators, broadcasting in Australia on the 1932–33 Ashes series and covering subsequent visits of MCC teams to Australia for the <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Commission</a>. A popular and respected commentator, he established an on-air partnership with former Australian batman <a href="Vic%20Richardson">Vic Richardson</a>. In Gilligan's obituary, "Wisden" observed "Gilligan was, as may be imagined, a master of the diplomatic comment if any tiresome incident occurred". He was also a member of the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> radio commentary team for Tests between 1947 and 1954. In 1955, he wrote a book, "The Urn Returns", about the 1954–55 Ashes series, won by England. In England, he wrote about cricket for the "<a href="News%20Chronicle">News Chronicle</a>". During the Second World War, Gilligan served in the Royal Air Force as a welfare officer; he was commissioned a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> and rose to the rank of <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>.

When his cricket career ended, Gilligan maintained his connection with Sussex, of which he was later made an Honorary Life Member. He served as chairman, patron and president of the county, and assisted many local clubs in the area. He gained a good reputation as a speaker and lecturer, and also developed an interest in golf in later years: he was president of the English golf union in 1959, captain of the County Cricketers' Golfing Society from 1952 until 1972, and president of the latter organisation until his death.

An Honorary Life Member of the MCC, Gilligan served as MCC president from 1967 to 1968. During his tenure, the MCC was involved in <a href="D%27Oliveira%20affair">controversy</a> over the non-selection of <a href="Basil%20D%27Oliveira">Basil D'Oliveira</a> to tour South Africa. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira in the England team on the grounds of his colour. Gilligan, in his capacity as MCC president, was aware of this having seen a private letter which communicated the explicit threat from the South African prime minister <a href="B.%20J.%20Vorster">B. J. Vorster</a> that the forthcoming tour would be cancelled if D'Oliveira were selected. However, he and the others who saw the letter, <a href="Gubby%20Allen">G. O. B. Allen</a> and <a href="Billy%20Griffith">Billy Griffith</a>, respectively the MCC treasurer and secretary, kept this information to themselves. When the English selectors met to choose the team, Gilligan, Allen and Griffith were present to represent the MCC. A BBC programme in 2004 claimed that Gilligan pressured the selectors to leave out D'Oliveira, but D'Oliveira's biographer Peter Oborne suggests that Allen carried far more influence at the meeting. He writes of Gilligan's part in the affair: "It would be wrong to make too much of Gilligan's embarrassing past. Given that presidents are appointed for only a year, it was a very strong president indeed who could impose his personality on the permanent MCC secretariat of Griffith and Allen, and Gilligan was not a strong president." Initially D'Oliveira was left out of the team, but when a player withdrew with an injury, the selectors added him as a replacement; the South African government barred D'Oliveira from taking part and the MCC cancelled the tour.

In 1971, a stand named after Gilligan was opened at <a href="County%20Cricket%20Ground%2C%20Hove">Hove Cricket Ground</a>, but this was demolished in 2010 as part of a redevelopment. Gilligan died in <a href="Pulborough">Pulborough</a>, Sussex, on 5 September 1976, aged 81.

Percy Chapman

Arthur Percy Frank Chapman (3 September 1900 – 16 September 1961), usually known as Percy Chapman, was an English <a href="cricketer">cricketer</a> who captained the <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England cricket team</a> between 1926 and 1931. A left-handed batsman, he played 26 <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> for England, captaining the side in 17 of those games. Chapman was appointed captain for the final, decisive Test of the 1926 series against Australia; under his captaincy, England defeated Australia to win <a href="the%20Ashes">the Ashes</a> for the first time since 1912. An <a href="Amateur%20status%20in%20first-class%20cricket">amateur cricketer</a>, Chapman played <a href="Minor%20Counties%20Cricket%20Championship">Minor Counties</a> cricket for <a href="Berkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Berkshire</a> and <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> for <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge University</a> and <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a>. Never a reliable batsman, Chapman nevertheless had a respectable batting record. He could score runs very quickly and was popular with spectators. As a <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29">fielder</a>, contemporaries rated him extremely highly. Although opinions were divided on his tactical ability as a captain, most critics accepted he was an inspirational leader.

Born in <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading, Berkshire</a> and educated at <a href="Uppingham%20School">Uppingham School</a>, Chapman established a reputation as a talented school cricketer and was named one of "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden's</a>" schoolboy <a href="Wisden%20Cricketer%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a> in 1919. He went to <a href="Pembroke%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Pembroke College, Cambridge</a> and represented the University cricket team with great success; his fame reached a peak when he scored <a href="Century%20%28cricket%29">centuries</a> against <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a> and in the Gentlemen v Players match within the space of a week. Chapman made his Test debut in 1924, although he had yet to play <a href="County%20Championship">County Cricket</a>. Having qualified for Kent, he was the surprise choice to take over from <a href="Arthur%20Carr%20%28cricketer%29">Arthur Carr</a> as England captain in 1926. He achieved victory in his first nine matches in charge but lost two and drew six of his remaining games. Perceived tactical deficiencies and possibly growing concerns over his heavy drinking meant that Chapman was dropped from the team for the fifth Test against Australia in 1930. He captained England on one final tour in 1930–31, after which he never played another Test. After he assumed the Kent captaincy in 1931, his career and physique declined until he resigned the position in 1936; he retired altogether in 1939, by which time he was drinking heavily.

Chapman's fame as a cricketer made him a popular public figure; he and his wife, whom he married in 1925, were well known figures in <a href="High%20society%20%28group%29">fashionable society</a> and their appearances were followed closely in the press. Outside of cricket, he worked for a brewery. In his later years, Chapman increasingly suffered from the effects of alcoholism and was often seen drunk in public. He and his wife divorced in 1942; he spent his final years, mainly alone, suffering from depression, arthritis and a continued dependence on alcohol. Following a fall at his home and a subsequent operation, Chapman died in 1961, aged 61.

Chapman was born on 3 September 1900 in <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading, Berkshire</a>, the son of Frank Chapman, a schoolteacher, and his wife Bertha Finch. Chapman's father encouraged him to play cricket and coached him personally. Chapman was first educated at his father's preparatory school, Fritham House, and by the age of eight was in the school's <a href="first%20eleven">first eleven</a>. In September 1910, he joined <a href="Oakham%20School">Oakham School</a> and scored his first century, dominating the cricket and football teams. From 1914 to 1918, he attended <a href="Uppingham%20School">Uppingham School</a>. Although his academic performance was undistinguished, he soon established a cricketing reputation. By 1916, he was in the Uppingham first team; he achieved second place in the school's <a href="Batting%20average%23Cricket">batting averages</a>, bringing him to the attention of the wider public. Chapman improved his record in 1917, scoring 668 runs at an average of 111.33; he hit two fifties, two centuries and a double century in his last five innings.

In 1918, Chapman scored 472 runs at 52.44 and took 15 wickets; the following year, he captained the team, scored 637 runs at an average of 70.77 and took 40 wickets. As a consequence of his achievements, he was chosen as one of the <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a> for 1919 in "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>". In both 1918 and 1919 he was selected for prestigious school representative matches at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's Cricket Ground</a>; although his weak defensive play drew comment, he was regarded as one of the most promising cricketers of his generation when he left Uppingham in 1919.

In 1919, Chapman entered <a href="Pembroke%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Pembroke College, Cambridge</a>. He failed in two trial games, organised prior to the 1920 cricket season to inform the selection of the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge</a> team, and despite his reputation, was omitted from the University's opening first-class match against <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a>. But on the day of the match, a player withdrew from the Cambridge team and Chapman replaced him. Making his first-class debut on 15 May 1920, he scored 118 in a rapid innings and kept his place in the team for the remainder of the season. After a century and two fifties, he was selected for the <a href="The%20University%20Match%20%28cricket%29">University Match</a> against <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford</a>. Chapman scored 27 in this final game of the university season to aggregate 613 runs at an average of 40.86, second in the Cambridge batting averages. Unusually for someone in their first year of University cricket, he was subsequently selected for the prestigious <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">Gentlemen v Players</a> match at Lord's. Although not particularly successful with the bat, critics singled him out for his effective fielding. During August, he played second-class <a href="Minor%20counties%20of%20English%20and%20Welsh%20cricket">Minor Counties cricket</a> for <a href="Berkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Berkshire</a> as an <a href="Amateur%20status%20in%20first-class%20cricket">amateur</a> and headed the team's batting averages; he later appeared in three end-of-season first-class games at the <a href="Scarborough%20Festival">Scarborough Festival</a> where he scored 101 in a Gentlemen and Players game against a bowling attack containing three internationals. In all first-class matches in 1920, Chapman scored 873 runs at 39.68.
In 1921, Chapman averaged over 50 for the University and scored three centuries, although his growing reputation meant some critics felt he had underachieved. He once again played in the University match against Oxford, and for the Gentlemen against the Players, and impressed commentators. Some critics suggested he, along with other promising University players, should play for England; the Test side were in the middle of a series against Australia which was lost 3–0, in the course of which an unusually large number of players were selected. Chapman once more appeared for Berkshire in August, scoring 468 runs and taking 19 wickets. At the end of the season, he was selected by <a href="Archie%20MacLaren">Archie MacLaren</a> in a match at Eastbourne, playing for an all-amateur non-representative England team against the undefeated Australian touring team. In a match which became famous in later years, MacLaren's team became the first to defeat the tourists, although Chapman was not successful personally. Chapman finished the season with 954 runs at 39.75.

That winter, "<a href="The%20Cricketer">The Cricketer</a>" magazine named Chapman as a young cricketer of the year. However, at the beginning of the 1922 season, his form was so poor that critics suggested leaving him out of the University Match. He had scored 300 runs from 14 innings, but retained his place partially on the strength of his fielding. After Cambridge batted very slowly on the first day, Chapman attacked the bowling on the second morning to score 102 <a href="not%20out">not out</a>. Cambridge won easily, concluding Chapman's cricket at the university, but his innings impressed critics to the extent that he was again selected for the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. There, he scored 160 and shared century partnerships with <a href="Arthur%20Carr%20%28cricketer%29">Arthur Carr</a> and <a href="Frank%20Mann%20%28cricketer%29">Frank Mann</a>. Chapman earned praise for his aggression and his stroke-play on the <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Off%20and%20leg%20side%20fields">off side</a>. "The Times" described it as "one of the great innings in the history of the game". Shortly after this, <a href="Sydney%20Pardon">Sydney Pardon</a> wrote in "The Times": "In the cricket field the most interesting figure at the moment is, beyond all comparison, Mr. A. P. F. Chapman. A fortnight ago we were all lamenting his ill-success this season and wondering whether he would ever do justice to his great gifts and fulfil the hopes entertained of him in 1920. Most effectually he has put his critics to shame ... he is in such a position that if an England eleven had to meet Australia next week he would be picked at once with acclamation." Prior to this, only <a href="R.%20E.%20Foster">R. E. Foster</a> had scored centuries in both the University Match and the Gentlemen v Players match in the same year. Chapman ended his season by scoring 805 runs and taking 19 wickets for Berkshire, and playing in festival games. He aggregated 607 runs at 33.72 in first-class matches for the season.

Chapman was popular at Cambridge and enjoyed his time there. He took part in a variety of social engagements and became involved in other sports. These included <a href="fives">fives</a>, tennis, <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a>, golf and football. He captained Pembroke College at rugby and was close to playing for the full university side. Chapman continued to play rugby for Berkshire Wanderers until he was nearly 30 years old. Also for Pembroke, he played as <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a> in the football team and might have played for the university at <a href="Field%20hockey">hockey</a> had he taken the sport seriously. In later years, he also displayed proficiency at tennis, in which critics thought he could have reached a high standard if motivated to do so, and golf.

During the English winter of 1922–23, the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) selected a team to tour Australia and New Zealand. This side, captained by <a href="Archie%20MacLaren">Archie MacLaren</a> and composed mainly of amateurs, was not particularly strong and contained several players chosen for their social standing rather than cricketing ability. The team played four first-class games in Australia against state teams; the first was drawn and the others were lost. After scores of 75 and 58 against <a href="Western%20Australia%20cricket%20team">Western Australia</a>, Chapman played consecutive innings of 53, 73 and 69 against <a href="South%20Australia%20cricket%20team">South Australia</a> and <a href="Victoria%20cricket%20team">Victoria</a>, followed by 100 in the most eagerly awaited match of the tour against a strong <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a> side. The press and public praised his attacking batting and his fielding, although <a href="Frank%20Iredale">Frank Iredale</a>, a former Test cricketer, noticed some flaws in his technique. When the team moved on to New Zealand, after an uncertain start Chapman scored 533 runs at an average of 48.45, including two centuries. The tourists returned to Australia for the last leg of the tour; Chapman scored 91 against New South Wales and 134 in 142 minutes against South Australia. In all the Australian games, he totalled 782 runs at 65.16; in all the matches on tour he had 1,315 runs at an average of 57.15.

When Chapman returned to England, he began to work for a brewery based in Kent, H & G Symonds; his residence in that county allowed him to qualify for <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent County Cricket Club</a>. There were few opportunities for Chapman to appear in first-class cricket until he qualified. His cricket was mainly restricted to <a href="Club%20cricket">club level</a> in 1923, with some further games for Berkshire. In addition, he played 12 first-class games for a variety of teams; he was selected for the Gentlemen v Players matches at Lord's and <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>, scoring 83 in the latter game, and played in two trial matches for players on the verge of England selection, although no Tests were played that year. In total, he scored 615 first-class runs at 29.28.

The focus of attention during the 1924 season was selection of a team to contest <a href="the%20Ashes">the Ashes</a> during a Test-playing tour of Australia the following winter. Critics regarded Chapman as a certainty for the team. Continuing to play as an amateur, he made his first appearance for Kent in a non-Championship match, as he was still qualifying, and was very successful in early season club matches. That summer, England played South Africa in a Test series and Chapman was selected for a trial game before the first Test. He scored 64 not out and 43 for "The Rest", and following the withdrawal of a batsman owing to injury before the first Test, Chapman made his Test debut against South Africa on 14 June. He became one of the few cricketers to represent England while playing for a minor county rather than a team playing in the County Championship. Chapman batted once and scored eight runs; he drew praise from "Wisden" for an "amazing" catch on the last day as South Africa were heavily beaten. He retained his place for the second Test but did not bat: only four English batsmen were needed in the game which the home side won by an innings. Although selected for the third game, Chapman did not play owing to a motorbike accident. He was not seriously hurt but missed the remainder of the Test series and the Gentlemen v Players game at Lord's. Upon recovering, he returned to play for Berkshire without much success and played several festival games at the end of the season. By this stage, he had already been selected to tour Australia. In the final match of the season, he was selected for "The Rest" to play the County Champions, <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>. He scored 74 in 50 minutes and hit three <a href="Boundary%20%28cricket%29%23Scoring%20runs">sixes</a>, two of them from consecutive <a href="Delivery%20%28cricket%29">deliveries</a> from <a href="Wilfred%20Rhodes">Wilfred Rhodes</a>. This was his highest score of the season, in which he made 561 first-class runs at 31.16.

The MCC team to Australia was led by <a href="Arthur%20Gilligan">Arthur Gilligan</a>. In the opening matches, Chapman was cheered by the crowds who remembered his achievements on the last tour, but failed to make any significant scores. His first big innings came against Victoria; he made 72 runs out of 111 scored while he was batting and played a large part in a win for the MCC. Against <a href="Queensland%20cricket%20team">Queensland</a> in the following match, he scored 80 in 70 minutes and then hit 93 against a representative Australian XI. He was selected for the first four Tests of the five-match series. Batting aggressively, he made several substantial scores but only once passed fifty— in the third Test, he scored 58, his first Test <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23H">half century</a>. During the same Test, Gilligan strained a muscle while bowling and had to leave the field; Chapman took over as captain. England lost the first three matches, giving Australia an insurmountable lead in the series, but won the fourth. Chapman was left out of the side for the final Test. In the series, he scored 185 runs at an average of 30.83, and critics were divided as to his ability and effectiveness. The former Australian captain <a href="Monty%20Noble">Monty Noble</a> believed Chapman could be a good batsman if he curbed his aggression but "The Cricketer" considered his technique to be faulty. "Wisden" did not judge Chapman a complete failure and noted that he "made useful scores at times". In all first-class games, Chapman scored 625 runs at 34.72. Although Chapman had a mixed time on the cricket field, the tour was a success for him socially.

Now qualified to play county cricket for Kent, Chapman played only four times in the County Championship in 1925, preferring to establish himself in his new career in the brewery trade. Not sufficiently wealthy to play cricket full-time as an amateur, Chapman's business commitments frequently restricted his appearances on the cricket field. During his limited first-class appearances in 1925, he scored 207 runs at 25.87 and "Wisden" said that he "did nothing out of the common".

By the beginning of the 1926 season, Chapman was no longer the star of English cricket. Although still respected for his earlier achievements, he had a modest record in Test and first-class cricket. During the season, the Australians toured England for another Ashes series. Chapman did not play any early season games and his first match for Kent was against the touring side. He scored 51, his first first-class fifty since January 1925. A week later, he scored 159 in the County Championship, bringing him back into contention for an England place, then scored 89 in a Test trial match played against the Australians. Chapman's appearances for Kent were sporadic for the rest of the season, but he scored 629 runs in his nine County Championship games at an average of 57.18 to lead the Kent averages. He also scored a century for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's.

Early in the season, Arthur Carr was named as England captain for the start of the series; Carr was a popular choice and the only other serious contender at the time was <a href="Percy%20Fender">Percy Fender</a>. Chapman played in two of the three trial matches and was chosen for the first Test but did not bat in a match ruined by rain. The second Test was drawn but Chapman scored fifty. Australia dominated most of the third Test but England saved the game; Chapman scored 15 and 42 not out in the match. However, Carr's tactical approach during the match was heavily criticised and he dropped a crucial catch on the first morning. Chapman was omitted from the side for the fourth Test, but fielded as substitute when Carr became ill during the game.

As the first four matches of the series were drawn, the final Test, played at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>, was decisive. Aware that England had beaten Australia only once in 19 matches, the selectors made several changes to the team; Chapman, at the time fourth in the national batting averages, replaced Carr as captain. This decision was controversial; the press favoured Carr, particularly as Chapman was young, unproven as captain and not fully established in the team. When the match began on 14 August, Chapman won the toss and decided that England should bat first. When it was his turn to bat, he was given a good reception by the crowd. During his innings, "Wisden" noted, Chapman "hit out in vigorous fashion", but once he was dismissed for 49, the remaining batsmen were out quickly, leaving England with a disappointing total of 280. Australia replied with 302. On a <a href="Sticky%20wicket">pitch affected by rain</a>, England then scored 436, mainly because of a large partnership between opening batsmen <a href="Jack%20Hobbs">Jack Hobbs</a> and <a href="Herbert%20Sutcliffe">Herbert Sutcliffe</a>. Australia needed to score 415 to win, which was unlikely given the condition of the pitch. The team were bowled out for 125, and at least one of Chapman's tactical decisions resulted in Australia losing a wicket. "Wisden" reported that "not a catch was missed nor was a run given away, the whole England side rising gallantly to the occasion. Naturally a scene of tremendous enthusiasm occurred at the end, the crowd swarming in thousands in front of the pavilion, and loudly cheering the players, both English and Australian." The correspondent also commented "Chapman ... despite lack of experience in leading a first-class team in the field, turned out a very happy nomination for the post of captain, the young amateur, for the most part, managing his bowling with excellent judgement, and in two or three things he did, showing distinct imagination." Throughout the match, Chapman chose to follow his own tactics rather than rely on the veteran players in the team for advice. In the series, he scored 175 runs at 58.33.

Following the match, Chapman was lauded as a cricketing hero, and among those who sent congratulatory messages were <a href="George%20V">George V</a> and Prime Minister <a href="Stanley%20Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a>. In all first-class matches in the season, he scored 1,381 runs at an average of 51.14, the first time he had passed four figures in a season. In his history of the England cricket captaincy, Alan Gibson notes that the controversy over Chapman's appointment was soon forgotten following his success. He writes: "English cricket had a new hero who looked the part ... Every selector was a champion!"

In its summary of the 1927 season, "Wisden" named him as Kent's best batsman and noted an improvement in his defensive technique. Against Lancashire, who retained the County Championship, he scored 260 in three hours' batting, the highest score of his career. The Lancashire bowling attack included former Australian Test bowler <a href="Ted%20McDonald">Ted McDonald</a>, regarded as the fastest bowler in the world at the time and feared by most county batsmen. Many critics praised Chapman's innings as one of the best ever played. He was selected to lead the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's for the first time, and led representative sides in two of the three Test trials held that season; the press judged his captaincy to be good. He totalled 1,387 runs in first-class games at an average of 66.04, the highest aggregate and average of his career. The Kent captaincy became available at the end of the season, but Chapman was not appointed; according to Chapman's biographer, David Lemmon, he was probably approached but was unable to dedicate the necessary time to the position.

Chapman was unavailable for the Test series in South Africa in the winter of 1927–28, but was a certainty to lead the MCC team to Australia in 1928–29. The selectors wished him to play more regularly, so he played more often in 1928 than any other season. He began in good form, but was never as effective as in 1927. Although his captaincy continued to be highly regarded, there were concerns in the press over his increasing weight, although these were offset by his impressive fielding in that season's Tests. He captained England to a 3–0 series win over West Indies, who were playing their first Test matches, and scored one fifty. In total, he scored 967 first-class runs at 37.19.

As expected, Chapman was named as captain for the Australian tour. The MCC touring team was regarded as a strong one by commentators; the only controversy was the omission of <a href="Frank%20Woolley">Frank Woolley</a> which was not fully explained. Rumours in later years said that Chapman was responsible for leaving Woolley out as he was jealous of his county teammate, but Lemmon regards this as unlikely.

According to <a href="Douglas%20Jardine">Douglas Jardine</a>'s biographer, Christopher Douglas, "[Chapman] hardly put a foot wrong during the tour and, even though he gave Australia their biggest hiding to date, he was and probably remains ... one of the most popular English captains to tour Australia." From the opening games, England followed a strategy of accumulating large totals. For the first Test, to strengthen the team's batting, Chapman and the tour selection committee chose only three specialist bowlers; as the Tests were "timeless"—played to a finish with no time limit—he believed batting to be the key to victory. England batted first and scored 521; Chapman scored 50, but critics believed he should have batted more cautiously. When Australia began their innings, he held a catch from <a href="Bill%20Woodfull">Bill Woodfull</a> in the <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">gully</a> which several observers rated as among the best they had seen. Sydney Southerton, writing of the English fielding, said: "The high note was struck by Chapman himself at Brisbane when, with a catch that will be historic, he dismissed Woodfull ... It is my opinion that catch had a pronounced effect on the course of events in the three subsequent Tests  ... [Chapman's fielding] exercised a most restraining influence on the Australian batsmen." Australia were bowled out for 122; Chapman did not ask Australia to <a href="follow-on">follow-on</a> but batted again, to the crowd's displeasure, and his batsmen relentlessly built up the England lead. When Chapman became the first captain to <a href="Declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declare an innings closed</a> in a timeless Test match, Australia needed 742 to win. On a rain-affected pitch, Australia were bowled out for 66; England's win by 675 runs remains in 2016 the largest margin of victory by runs in Tests.

Chapman's team won the second Test comfortably after scoring 636 in their first innings, the highest team total in Tests at that time. In the third Test, England began the fourth innings requiring 332 to win on a rain-damaged pitch, a task critics believed impossible. A large opening partnership from Hobbs and Sutcliffe gave England a chance, and Hobbs sent a message to the England dressing room suggesting a tactical change in the batting order. But the team could not find Chapman, who according to Percy Fender, in attendance as a journalist, spent most of his time socialising with guests in the Ladies' Stand. Consequently, the team followed Hobbs' plan without the approval of the captain. England's batsmen took the total to within 14 of victory when the fourth wicket fell. Chapman came in and batted in an unusual way; after attempting some big shots, he played ultra-defensively, possibly in an attempt to allow <a href="Patsy%20Hendren">Patsy Hendren</a> to reach fifty runs before England won. Hendren was out soon after, then Chapman tried to hit a <a href="Boundary%20%28cricket%29%23Scoring%20runs">six</a> and was caught. The batsmen continued to play recklessly and a further wicket fell to a <a href="run%20out">run out</a>. Douglas describes the end of the match: "Meanwhile, [England batsman <a href="George%20Geary">George Geary</a>] was quite unruffled by the sudden upsets. He wound up for the next delivery and thumped it through mid-on for 4, bellowing, 'Dammit, we've done 'em!' It was an appropriate way for a side under Chapman to win the Ashes." England's victory in the third Test ensured the Ashes were retained, and the team also won the fourth Test to take a 4–0 lead in the series.

Up to this time, Chapman had enjoyed a harmonious relationship with the Australian crowds. However, in the match against Victoria which followed the fourth Test, the crowd barracked the MCC team when Chapman brought on <a href="Harold%20Larwood">Harold Larwood</a>, a fast bowler, to bowl against <a href="Bert%20Ironmonger">Bert Ironmonger</a>, the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Lower%20order%20or%20tail">number eleven</a>, a tactic regarded as unsporting. As the team returned to the pavilion, Chapman was insulted by members of the crowd in the midst of a minor scuffle. Possibly influenced by these events, he withdrew from the final Test; illness and his poor form may also have been factors. According to Lemmon, it was suggested in later years that Chapman did not play owing to his heavy drinking. In his absence, Australia won the fifth Test. After the fifth day of play and having played both his innings, Jardine left to catch a boat to India, for reasons which are unclear, and Chapman acted as his substitute in the field. Douglas notes that it looked like England "were trying to pull a fast one by picking their strongest batting side (which meant dropping Chapman) without weakening the fielding (since Chapman was Jardine's substitute)." The Australians agreed to the substitution on the condition that Chapman did not field near the batsmen.

In the Tests, Chapman scored 165 runs at 23.57, and in all first-class matches he reached 533 runs and averaged 33.31. Southerton summarised his performance: "Chapman himself began well in batting but in the later matches was too prone to lash out at the off ball and, as the tour progressed, the Australian bowlers discovered his weakness." On his captaincy, Southerton wrote: "Chapman captained the side uncommonly well, improving out of all knowledge as the tour progressed." Socially, Chapman enjoyed the tour; he attended many functions and events; <a href="Bill%20Ferguson%20%28cricket%20scorer%29">Bill Ferguson</a>, the team scorer, only saw him annoyed once on the tour: when his accustomed drink was not waiting for him at a lunch interval.

Following the end of the 1928–29 tour, Chapman did not return to England until July, midway through the cricket season; <a href="Jack%20White%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201891%29">Jack White</a> and Arthur Carr captained England in his absence. Chapman resumed playing for Kent shortly after his return home but appeared in only seven matches, with a top-score of 28. His season was curtailed when he fell awkwardly while fielding in a match against <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a> at the beginning of August. He also missed the two MCC tours that winter to New Zealand and West Indies, neither of which involved a full-strength team.

In 1930, Australia toured England once more. Before the Test series, Chapman was not a unanimous choice among press correspondents; several critics believed he should not be in the team on account of his rapidly increasing weight—former England captain <a href="Pelham%20Warner">Pelham Warner</a> suggested he needed to lose at least two <a href="Stone%20%28unit%29">stone</a>—and concern over his poor batting form. However, Chapman began the season well, impressing commentators with his batting, fielding and captaincy, and was named as England captain for the first Test match. In the first innings, he scored 52 in 65 minutes, and England won the match by 93 runs on the fourth day. The "Wisden" correspondent wrote: "Chapman, with his resources limited, managed his bowling well and himself fielded in dazzling fashion." This was Chapman's sixth successive victory over Australia and he had won all nine of the Tests in which he was captain. However, it was to be his last Test victory.

England lost the second Test by seven wickets, and Gibson describes the match as the "turning point in Chapman's fortunes". "Wisden" observed: "Briefly, the Englishmen lost a match, which, with a little discretion on the last day, they could probably have saved." England scored 425 in their first innings, but <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a> hit 254 runs and Australia reached 729 for six declared. When Chapman came in to bat in the second innings, England still trailed by 163 runs and had lost four wickets—a fifth fell soon after. He attacked the bowling immediately, and shared a large partnership with <a href="Gubby%20Allen">Gubby Allen</a>. When the latter was out, Chapman began to score even faster. He took England into the lead, hitting out at almost every delivery to reach his only Test century after 140 minutes' batting. "Wisden" commented: "It was about this time that, with a little care and thoughtfulness, England might have saved the game ... So far from devoting their energies to defence they continued hitting away, adding another 113 runs in an hour and a quarter afterwards but losing their last five wickets." Chapman was finally dismissed for 121, after batting for 155 minutes and striking 12 fours and 4 sixes. England were all out for 375, leaving Australia needing to score 72 runs to win. Although Chapman held a difficult catch from Bradman which was praised by commentators, Australia won comfortably. Chapman's century made him the first batsman to score centuries at Lord's in the University match, in the Gentlemen v Players game and for England in a Test match; only <a href="Martin%20Donnelly%20%28cricketer%29">Martin Donnelly</a> later performed a similar feat, though his Test century was scored for New Zealand. As the Gentlemen v Players match ceased in 1962, the feat will never be repeated.

In the immediate aftermath of the game, Chapman was praised for his batting; the team and selectors, rather than Chapman, were blamed for the defeat. However, his captaincy and tactics were later criticised, by Pelham Warner among others. In particular, his placement of fielders and his refusal to play defensively were questioned. Gibson notes that historians regard this match as a turning point in Test matches; afterwards, captains became more concerned to avoid defeat rather than follow Chapman's policy of playing entertaining, attacking cricket whatever the result. Chapman's unwillingness to play for a draw was in later years held up as "the last sporting gesture by an England captain".
In the third Test, Bradman made the highest individual score in a Test match by scoring 334 out of Australia's 566. Assisted by rain that shortened the available playing time, England drew the match. Chapman scored 45 in his only innings. The fourth Test match was also badly affected by rain which brought about another draw. Chapman now faced further criticism of his captaincy. His field placings were again queried; Warner noted that Chapman's tactics were poor and that he was slow to react to the opposition. According to cricket writer Leo McKinstry, the selectors lost faith in Chapman on account of his inconsistent, risky batting and his increased tactical shortcomings. However, McKinstry also writes that the selectors and other influential members of the cricketing establishment were privately concerned by Chapman's heavy drinking which they felt was affecting his leadership. There were also rumours that he was drunk during some sessions of the fourth Test. Following an extended meeting of the selectors, Chapman was left out of the side and replaced as captain by <a href="Bob%20Wyatt">Bob Wyatt</a>. The press were united in attacking the decision, praising Chapman's batting and captaincy while denigrating Wyatt's lack of experience. Gibson observes: "In 1930, despite the occasional criticisms, Chapman's position did not seem in any danger. He was still the popular, boyish, debonair hero. He had been having his most successful series with the bat, and as a close fieldsman England still did not contain his equal. He could not seriously be blamed because the English bowlers could not get Bradman out (though this was perhaps more apparent in retrospect than at the time). Wyatt, though nothing was known against him ... was a figure markedly lacking in glamour."

In the final Test, Bradman scored another century and England lost the match and series, although Wyatt played a substantial innings, and "Wisden" conceded Chapman could have made little difference except as a fielder. The two men remained friends during and after the controversy. In comparing circumstances of Chapman's appointment with those of his replacement by Wyatt, Gibson writes: "In 1926, England won: in 1930, England lost. That is why the echoes took so long to die down and why the selectors remained villains." He concludes that, even though Wyatt did relatively well, "It does seem, after all these years, an odd decision to have taken." In the series, Chapman scored 259 runs at 43.16. In all first-class cricket, he passed four figures for the final time, reaching 1,027 runs at an average of 29.34.

Already chosen as tour captain before the final 1930 Ashes Test, Chapman led an MCC team to a 1–0 series defeat in South Africa the following winter. Several first-choice players were not selected and the team suffered from injuries and illness. Chapman was popular with the crowds but made a poor start to the tour with the bat until he scored more substantially in the lead-up to the Test series. England lost the opening match of the series by 28 runs and the other four were drawn. Needing to win the final match to level the series, England were frustrated when the start of the match was delayed. Chapman won the toss and chose to bowl on a damp pitch which would have favoured his bowlers. However, the umpires discovered the <a href="Bail%20%28cricket%29">bails</a> were the wrong size and would not start the game until new ones could be made; in the 20 minutes which were lost, the pitch dried out and England lost much of the advantage of bowling first. Chapman made an official protest before leading his team onto the field. In the series, he scored 75 runs at 10.71, and 471 runs at 27.70 in all first-class games. "Wisden" observed that "without finding his full powers as a punishing hitter, Chapman occasionally batted well". Socially, the tour was more successful. Chapman was accompanied by his wife, and his parents joined the tour for a time. He took part in many social events and visited several whiskey firms which were associated with his employers in England.

Chapman played no further Test cricket; in 26 Tests, he scored 925 runs at an average of 28.90 and held 32 catches. He captained England in 17 matches, winning nine and losing two with the others drawn. Under him the team achieved seven consecutive victories, equalling the English record, which was not surpassed until 2004. His nine victories came in his first nine games as captain.

Although Chapman lost the England captaincy after the South African tour, he became official captain of Kent in 1931, having previously captained the side occasionally. "Wisden" commented that Chapman "exercised an invigorating influence" on the side. Before Chapman assumed the Kent captaincy, the county team was sharply divided along social lines and the amateur leadership was aloof from and often dismissive of the professional players. Members of the team felt that he improved the atmosphere within the side and made the game enjoyable. Critics and players thought that he was past his best by the time he became captain, and already affected by alcoholism, but Chapman was successful as leader. His fielding remained influential. However, his batting form was poor: in 1931, he scored 662 runs at an average of 18.38. Sections of the press thought he should remain England captain, but he was replaced as Test captain by Jardine, who was not a popular choice; the selectors chose Jardine to exercise more discipline on the team than Chapman had done. At the end of the season, Chapman toured Jamaica in a team captained by <a href="Lionel%20Tennyson%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Tennyson">Lord Tennyson</a> and scored 203 runs in first-class matches at 33.83.

Chapman began the 1932 season in good form and appeared fitter than he had for many seasons. There were further calls in the press for him to captain England. Jardine's captaincy in 1931 left critics unimpressed and C. Stewart Caine, the editor of "Wisden", wrote that "the impression appears to be widely entertained that Chapman, were he in [batting] form, would again be given charge of the [England] team." Christopher Douglas believes that the difference between Jardine and Chapman in captaincy style made it harder for the press to accept Jardine. He writes: "Chapman's was just the kind of daredevil approach that is remembered with affection and, even though it was barely a year since he had lost the leadership, his reign was being regarded through rose-coloured specs." However, it is unlikely that the selectors ever considered returning to him. During the season, Chapman scored 951 runs, averaged 29.71, and led Kent to third place in the County Championship for the second year in succession.

In 1933, he scored 834 runs but his average fell to 21.94 and he never again averaged over 23 in any season in which he played regularly. Owing to his increasing weight and lack of physical fitness, he found batting much harder. As his physique declined, he was unable to produce the same batting feats he had managed previously. In the field, although still catching effectively, his inability to chase the ball meant he fielded closer to the batsmen; he also took fewer catches. In both 1934 and 1935, he averaged around 22 with the bat and scored under 800 runs. In 1935, he scored his final first-class century, against Somerset, having not reached the landmark since 1931. Teammates and observers noticed that in the final years of his career, Chapman frequently left the field during matches, and they suspected he was drinking in the pavilion.

Chapman played infrequently in 1936, and the captaincy was shared between him and two others. He was reluctant to bat, to the extent of dropping down the batting order to avoid doing so, and his friends believed that his nerve had gone. At the end of the season, he announced that business commitments forced him to give up the captaincy. Over the following three seasons, Chapman played for Kent in three more matches: against the New Zealand touring side in 1937 and in two Championship games in 1938. He also captained a non-representative England XI in a festival game against the New Zealanders in 1937, batting at <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Lower%20order%20or%20tail">number ten in the order</a> and scoring 61. His remaining first-class matches were low-profile games against Oxford and Cambridge Universities; he played 13 games in his final three seasons. In his last first-class game, in 1939, he captained MCC against Oxford, scoring 12 and 0. In all first-class cricket, Chapman scored 16,309 runs in 394 matches at an average of 31.97, and held 356 catches. By the time his career ended, his weight had increased even further, and Lemmon believes that he had become an embarrassment to other cricketers. Subsequently, Chapman faded away without much comment.

Writer <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a> described Chapman as "the schoolboy's dream of the perfect captain of an England cricket eleven. He was tall, slim, always youthful, and pink and chubby of face. His left-handed batting mingled brilliance and grace ... His cricket was romantic in its vaunting energy but classic in shape." While batting, Chapman always tried to attack the bowling; although this meant he made mistakes which resulted in his dismissal, it meant that he could change the course of a game in a short time. Cricket writer <a href="R.%20C.%20Robertson-Glasgow">R. C. Robertson-Glasgow</a> described him as: "Tall, strong, and lithe, he was a left-handed hitter with orthodox defence, much of which was rendered unnecessary by a vast reach, and an ability to drive good-length balls over the head of mid-off, bowler, and mid-on. His cover-driving, too, was immensely strong." Gibson notes that Chapman's career batting figures were good, but that critics believed that, with his talent, he should have scored more runs. Gibson writes: "When Chapman was going well, he looked quite as good as Woolley [his Kent and England team-mate] at the other end, and in the mid-1920s there was no other English left-hander, possibly no other England batsman at all except Hobbs, of whom that could be said." His increased weight in the 1930s robbed him of confidence and slowed him down to the point where his batting declined. When batting, Chapman usually wore the <a href="Quidnuncs">Quidnuncs</a> cap.

Commentators claimed that Chapman was not a subtle captain and lacked tactical astuteness. Even so, his record is better than most others who led England during Chapman's career. Pelham Warner believed that Chapman started well, but that in the later stages of 1930, his tactical sense markedly deteriorated. On the other hand, several of Chapman's contemporaries believed him to be one of the best captains. <a href="Arthur%20Gilligan">Arthur Gilligan</a>, one of Chapman's predecessors, considered him to be a model for the role, and <a href="Bert%20Oldfield">Bert Oldfield</a>, who played against Chapman as Australia's <a href="wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a>, thought that Chapman possessed an "aptitude" for leadership. Chapman's teams were usually harmonious and his sympathetic handling of his players often brought out the best in them. Writing in 1943, Robertson-Glasgow said: "He knew his men as perhaps no other captain of modern times has known them." Cricket writer <a href="E.%20W.%20Swanton">E. W. Swanton</a> believes that Chapman's cavalier reputation was misleading in assessing his effectiveness, and that "underlying the boyish facade was both a shrewd cricket brain and the good sense to ask advice from those of greater experience."

Robertson-Glasgow described Chapman as among the greatest fielders of all time, and "The Times" observed that "at his best he had been one of the finest fielders ever to play for England". In his earlier years, he fielded in the <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">deep</a> but when he played for Kent and England, he was positioned closer to the batsmen—usually at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">gully or silly point</a>. "The Cricketer" commented that his "capacious hands made him a brilliant close-to-the-wicket fielder, and some of his catches were miraculous". In his youth, Chapman bowled quite regularly, but his negative experience bowling for Berkshire lessened his enthusiasm, and he did not take it seriously.

During May 1921, Chapman met Gertrude ("Beet" or "Beety") Lowry, the sister of <a href="Tom%20Lowry">Tom Lowry</a>, a cricketer from New Zealand who played for Cambridge and <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a> and went on to captain his country. The couple met again when Chapman toured New Zealand in 1922–23, and became engaged. At the end of the 1924–25 Australia tour, they married and returned to England together. The wedding was widely reported and until the end of the decade the couple were heavily involved in social events. They were popular guests at functions, and became notable figures in the fashionable <a href="High%20society%20%28group%29">society</a> of the upper classes. In 1923, Chapman joined a Kent brewery, H & G Symonds. His wife believed that his choice of a career working in the alcohol trade made his life difficult and contributed to his heavy drinking. The social duties associated with his job also contributed to his increased weight and failing fitness in the later part of his cricket career. Further problems arose through his fame; as he wanted to keep people happy, he drank frequently and attended many social functions. Cricket writer Ivo Tennant believes that Chapman's "taste for conviviality was his undoing". He always appeared happy, but Gibson observes "that is the way some men disguise their unhappiness", and Lemmon suggests that Chapman was seeking acceptance and felt lonely at heart. According to Lemmon, by the end of the Second World War, Chapman was largely living in the past, and that "mentally he was still in the happy days of University cricket."

E. W. Swanton observes that "from the war onwards [Chapman's] life went into a sad eclipse." In 1942, Chapman was divorced from his wife; according to Lemmon, "Beet had stood much, but there is a point for all relationships beyond which one must not go". She returned to live in New Zealand in 1946. After 1946, Chapman shared a house with the steward of West Hill Golf Club, Bernard Benson, and his health continued to deteriorate. He was frequently observed to be drunk in public, although his appearance and manners remained impeccable; the cricket establishment ignored him, regarding him as an embarrassment, particularly on the occasions he watched matches at Lord's. By the end of his life, he was unable to attend any cricket matches. In addition to his alcoholism, Chapman became increasingly isolated, suffering from loneliness and depression. By the 1950s, he had developed arthritis, probably as a result of his sporting activities. On one occasion in 1955, Chapman was invited to a dinner organised by Kent; he was later discovered in the car park on the bumper of a car in a distressed state and had to be assisted back inside.

In September 1961, Chapman fractured his knee when he fell at his home. He was taken to hospital for an operation but died on 16 September 1961. The newspapers reported that he had been ill for a long time; his former wife later commented that "he must have died a very sad man". Tributes focused on his successes as a cricketer and appealing personality. Summing up Chapman's life, Gibson writes: "But just as a good end can redeem a sad life, so a good life can redeem a sad end, and he had known his hours, his years of glory." Swanton concluded his obituary of Chapman in 1961: "The elderly and the middle-aged will recall him rather in his handsome sunlit youth, the epitome of all that was gay and fine in the game of cricket."

K-25

K-25 was the codename given by the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> to the program to produce <a href="enriched%20uranium">enriched uranium</a> for <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>s using the <a href="gaseous%20diffusion">gaseous diffusion</a> method. Originally the codename for the product, over time it came to refer to the project, the production facility located at the <a href="Clinton%20Engineer%20Works">Clinton Engineer Works</a> in <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>, the main gaseous diffusion building, and ultimately the site. When it was built in 1944, the four-story K-25 gaseous diffusion plant was the world's largest building, comprising over of floor space and a volume of .

Gaseous diffusion is based on <a href="Graham%27s%20law">Graham's law</a>, which states that the rate of <a href="effusion">effusion</a> of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its <a href="molecular%20mass">molecular mass</a>. The highly corrosive <a href="uranium%20hexafluoride">uranium hexafluoride</a> () was the only known compound of uranium sufficiently <a href="Volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatile</a> to be used in this process. Before this could be done, the Special Alloyed Materials (SAM) Laboratories at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> and the <a href="Kellex%20Corporation">Kellex Corporation</a> had to overcome formidable difficulties to develop a suitable barrier.

Construction of the K-25 facility was undertaken by <a href="J.%20A.%20Jones%20Construction">J. A. Jones Construction</a>. At the height of construction, over 25,000 workers were employed on the site. Gaseous diffusion was but one of three enrichment technologies used by the Manhattan Project. Slightly enriched product from the <a href="S-50%20%28Manhattan%20Project%29">S-50 thermal diffusion plant</a> was fed into the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. Its product in turn was fed into the <a href="calutron">Y-12 electromagnetic plant</a>. The enriched uranium was used in the <a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a> atomic bomb used in the <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombing of Hiroshima</a>. In 1946, the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant became capable of producing highly enriched product.

After the war, four more gaseous diffusion plants named K-27, K-29, K-31 and K-33 were added to the site. The K-25 site was renamed the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant in 1955. Production of enriched uranium ended in 1964, and gaseous diffusion finally ceased on the site on 27 August 1985. The Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant was renamed the Oak Ridge K-25 Site in 1989, and the East Tennessee Technology Park in 1996. Demolition of all five gaseous diffusion plants was completed in February 2017.

The discovery of the <a href="neutron">neutron</a> by <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a> in 1932, followed by that of <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a> in <a href="uranium">uranium</a> by the German chemists <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a> and <a href="Fritz%20Strassmann">Fritz Strassmann</a> in 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a> and <a href="Otto%20Frisch">Otto Frisch</a> soon after, opened up the possibility of a controlled <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a> with uranium. At the <a href="Pupin%20Laboratories">Pupin Laboratories</a> at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> and <a href="Leo%20Szilard">Leo Szilard</a> began exploring how this might be achieved. Fears that a <a href="German%20atomic%20bomb%20project">German atomic bomb project</a> would develop atomic weapons first, especially among scientists who were refugees from <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and other <a href="fascist">fascist</a> countries, were expressed in the <a href="Einstein-Szilard%20letter">Einstein-Szilard letter</a> to the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>, <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>. This prompted Roosevelt to initiate preliminary research in late 1939.

<a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> and <a href="John%20Archibald%20Wheeler">John Archibald Wheeler</a> applied the <a href="liquid%20drop%20model">liquid drop model</a> of the <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nucleus</a> to explain the mechanism of nuclear fission. As the experimental physicists studied fission, they uncovered puzzling results. <a href="George%20Placzek">George Placzek</a> asked Bohr why uranium seemed to fission with both fast and slow neutrons. Walking to a meeting with Wheeler, Bohr had an insight that the fission at low energies was due to the <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a> <a href="isotope">isotope</a>, while at high energies it was mainly due to the far more abundant <a href="uranium-238">uranium-238</a> isotope. The former makes up just 0.714 percent of the uranium atoms in natural uranium, about one in every 140; natural uranium is 99.28 percent uranium-238. There is also a tiny amount of <a href="uranium-234">uranium-234</a>, which accounts for just 0.006 percent.

At Columbia, <a href="John%20R.%20Dunning">John R. Dunning</a> believed that this was the case, but Fermi was not so sure. The only way to settle this was to obtain a sample of uranium 235 and test it. He got <a href="Alfred%20O.%20C.%20Nier">Alfred O. C. Nier</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a> to prepare samples of uranium enriched in uranium-234, 235 and 238 using a <a href="mass%20spectrometer">mass spectrometer</a>. These were ready in February 1940, and Dunning, <a href="Eugene%20T.%20Booth">Eugene T. Booth</a> and <a href="Aristid%20von%20Grosse">Aristid von Grosse</a> then carried out a series of experiments. They demonstrated that uranium-235 was indeed primarily responsible for fission with slow neutrons, but were unable to determine precise <a href="neutron%20capture">neutron capture</a> <a href="neutron%20cross%20section">cross sections</a> because their samples were not sufficiently enriched.

At the <a href="University%20of%20Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a> in Britain, the Australian physicist <a href="Mark%20Oliphant">Mark Oliphant</a> assigned two refugee physicists—Otto Frisch and <a href="Rudolf%20Peierls">Rudolf Peierls</a>—the task of investigating the feasibility of an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like <a href="radar">radar</a>. Their March 1940 <a href="Frisch%E2%80%93Peierls%20memorandum">Frisch–Peierls memorandum</a> indicated that the <a href="critical%20mass">critical mass</a> of uranium-235 was within an <a href="order%20of%20magnitude">order of magnitude</a> of , which was small enough to be carried by a <a href="bomber">bomber</a> of the day.

In April 1940, <a href="Jesse%20Beams">Jesse Beams</a>, <a href="Ross%20Gunn">Ross Gunn</a>, Fermi, Nier, <a href="Merle%20Tuve">Merle Tuve</a> and <a href="Harold%20Urey">Harold Urey</a> had a meeting at the <a href="American%20Physical%20Society">American Physical Society</a> in Washington, D.C. At the time, the prospect of building an atomic bomb seemed dim, and even creating a chain reaction would likely require enriched uranium. They therefore recommended that research be conducted with the aim of developing the means to separate kilogram amounts of uranium-235. At a lunch on 21 May 1940, <a href="George%20B.%20Kistiakowsky">George B. Kistiakowsky</a> suggested the possibility of using <a href="gaseous%20diffusion">gaseous diffusion</a>.

Gaseous diffusion is based on <a href="Graham%27s%20law">Graham's law</a>, which states that the rate of <a href="effusion">effusion</a> of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's <a href="molecular%20mass">molecular mass</a>. In a container with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A container wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a <a href="Diffuser%20%28thermodynamics%29">diffuser</a>.

Gaseous diffusion had been used to separate isotopes before. <a href="Francis%20William%20Aston">Francis William Aston</a> had used it to partially separate isotopes of <a href="neon">neon</a> in 1931, and <a href="Gustav%20Ludwig%20Hertz">Gustav Ludwig Hertz</a> had improved on the method to almost completely separate neon by running it through a series of stages. In the United States, <a href="William%20Draper%20Harkins">William D. Harkins</a> had used it to separate <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>. Kistiakowsky was familiar with the work of Charles G. Maier at the <a href="United%20States%20Bureau%20of%20Mines">Bureau of Mines</a>, who had also used the process to separate gases.

<a href="Uranium%20hexafluoride">Uranium hexafluoride</a> () was the only known compound of uranium sufficiently <a href="Volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatile</a> to be used in the gaseous diffusion process. Fortunately, <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a> consists of only a single isotope , so that the 1 percent difference in molecular weights between and is due solely to the difference in weights of the uranium isotopes. For these reasons, was the only choice as a <a href="Raw%20material">feedstock</a> for the gaseous diffusion process. Uranium hexafluoride, a solid at room temperature, <a href="Sublimation%20%28phase%20transition%29">sublimes</a> at at . Applying Graham's Law to uranium hexafluoride:

where:

Uranium hexafluoride is a highly <a href="corrosive%20substance">corrosive substance</a>. It is an <a href="oxidant">oxidant</a> and a <a href="Lewis%20acids%20and%20bases">Lewis acid</a> which is able to bind to <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a>. It reacts with water to form a solid compound, and is very difficult to handle on an industrial scale.

Booth, Dunning and von Grosse investigated the gaseous diffusion process. In 1941, they were joined by <a href="Francis%20G.%20Slack">Francis G. Slack</a> from <a href="Vanderbilt%20University">Vanderbilt University</a> and <a href="Willard%20F.%20Libby">Willard F. Libby</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California</a>. In July 1941, an <a href="Office%20of%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> (OSRD) contract was awarded to Columbia University to study gaseous diffusion. With the help of the mathematician Karl P. Cohen, they built a twelve-stage pilot gaseous diffusion plant at the Pupin Laboratories. Initial tests showed that the stages were not as efficient as the theory would suggest, and that they would need about 4,600 stages to enrich to 90 percent uranium-235.
A secret contract was awarded to <a href="KBR%20%28company%29">M. W. Kellogg</a> for engineering studies in July 1941. This included the design and construction of a ten-stage pilot gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December 1942, the <a href="Manhattan%20District">Manhattan District</a>, the US Army component of the Manhattan Project, as the effort to develop an atomic bomb became known, contracted Kellogg to design, build and operate a full-scale production plant. Unusually, the contract did not require any guarantees from Kellogg that it could actually accomplish this task. Because the scope of the project was not well defined, Kellogg and the Manhattan District agreed to defer any financial details to a later, <a href="cost-plus%20contract">cost-plus contract</a>, which was executed in April 1944. Kellogg was then paid $2.5 million.

For security reasons, the Army had Kellogg establish a wholly owned subsidiary, the <a href="Kellex%20Corporation">Kellex Corporation</a>, so that the gaseous diffusion project could be kept separate from other company work. "Kell" stood for "Kellogg" and "X" for secret. Kellex operated as a self-contained and autonomous entity. Percival C. Keith, Kellogg's vice president of engineering, was placed in charge of Kellex. He drew extensively on Kellogg to staff the new company, but also had to recruit staff from outside as well. Eventually, Kellex would have over 3,700 employees.

Dunning remained in charge at Columbia until 1 May 1943, when the Manhattan District took over the contract from OSRD. By this time Slack's group had nearly 50 members. His was the largest group, and it was working on the most challenging problem: the design of a suitable barrier through which the gas could diffuse. Another 30 scientists and technicians were working in five other groups. Henry A. Boorse was responsible for the pumps; Booth for the cascade test units. Libby handled chemistry, Nier analytical work and Hugh C. Paxton, engineering support. The Army reorganized the research effort at Columbia, which became the Special Alloyed Materials (SAM) Laboratories. Urey was put in charge, Dunning becoming head of one of its divisions. It would remain this way until 1 March 1945, when the SAM Laboratories were taken over by <a href="Union%20Carbide">Union Carbide</a>.

The expansion of the SAM Laboratories led to a search for more space. The Nash Garage Building at 3280 <a href="Broadway%20%28Manhattan%29">Broadway</a> was purchased by Columbia University. Originally an automobile dealership, it was just a few blocks from the campus. Major Benjamin K. Hough Jr. was the Manhattan District's Columbia Area engineer, and he moved his offices here too. Kellex was in the <a href="Woolworth%20Building">Woolworth Building</a> at 233 Broadway in <a href="Lower%20Manhattan">Lower Manhattan</a>. In January 1943, Lieutenant Colonel James C. Stowers was appointed New York Area Engineer, with responsibility for the entire K-25 Project. His small staff, initially of 20 military and civilian personnel, but which gradually grew to over 70, was co-located in the Woolworth Building. The Manhattan District had its offices nearby at <a href="270%20Broadway">270 Broadway</a> until it moved to <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>, in August 1943.

The code name "K-25" was a combination of the "K" from Kellex, and "25," a World War II-era code designation for uranium-235 (derived from element 92, <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a> 235). The term was first used in Kellex internal reports for the end product, enriched uranium, in March 1943. By April 1943, the term "K-25 plant" was being used for the plant that created it. That month, the term "K-25 Project" was applied to the entire project to develop <a href="uranium%20enrichment">uranium enrichment</a> using the gaseous diffusion process. When other "K-" buildings were added after the war, "K-25" became the name of the original, larger complex.

The highly corrosive nature of uranium hexafluoride threw up several technological challenges. Pipes and fittings that it came into contact with had to be made of, or <a href="Cladding%20%28metalworking%29">clad</a> with <a href="nickel">nickel</a>. This was fine for small objects, but impractical for the large diffusers, the tank-like containers that had to hold the gas under pressure. Nickel was a vital war material, and although the Manhattan Project could use its overriding priority to acquire it, making the diffusers out of solid nickel would deplete the national supply. The director of the Manhattan Project, <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves%20Jr.">Leslie R. Groves Jr.</a>, gave the contract to build the diffusers to <a href="Chrysler">Chrysler</a>. In turn, its president, <a href="K.%20T.%20Keller">K. T. Keller</a> assigned Carl Heussner, an expert in <a href="electroplating">electroplating</a>, the task of developing a process for electroplating such a large object. Senior Chrysler executives called this "Project X-100".

Electroplating used one-thousandth of the nickel of a solid nickel diffuser. The SAM laboratories had already attempted this and failed. Heussner experimented with a prototype in a building built within a building, and found that it could be done, so long as the series of pickling and scaling steps required were done without anything coming in contact with oxygen. Chrysler's entire factory at Lynch Road in Detroit was turned over to the manufacture of diffusers. The electroplating process required over of floor space, several thousand workers and a complicated air filtration system to ensure that the nickel was not contaminated. By the war's end, Chrysler had built and shipped over 3,500 diffusers.

The gaseous diffusion process required suitable pumps that had to meet stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage the pumps, but would contaminate the feed. They could not afford any leakage of uranium hexafluoride, especially if it was already enriched, or of oil, which would react with the uranium hexafluoride. They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, the SAM Laboratories chose to use <a href="centrifugal%20pump">centrifugal pump</a>s. They were aware that the desired <a href="compression%20ratio">compression ratio</a> of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high for this type of pump. For some purposes, a <a href="reciprocating%20pump">reciprocating pump</a> would suffice, and these were designed by Henry A. Boorse at the SAM Laboratories, while <a href="Ingersoll%20Rand">Ingersoll Rand</a> tackled the centrifugal pumps.

In early 1943, Ingersoll Rand pulled out. Keith approached the Clark Compressor Company and <a href="Worthington%20Pump%20and%20Machinery">Worthington Pump and Machinery</a> but they turned it down, saying that it could not be done. So Keith and Groves saw executives at <a href="Allis-Chalmers">Allis-Chalmers</a>, who agreed to build a new factory to produce the pumps, even though the pump design was still uncertain. The SAM Laboratories came up with a design, and <a href="Westinghouse%20Electric%20%281886%29">Westinghouse</a> built some prototypes that were successfully tested. Then <a href="Judson%20Swearingen">Judson Swearingen</a> at the <a href="Elliott%20Company">Elliott Company</a> came up with a revolutionary and promising design that was mechanically stable with seals that would contain the gas. This design was manufactured by Allis-Chalmers.

Difficulties with the diffusers and pumps paled into insignificance besides those with the <a href="semipermeable%20membrane">porous barrier</a>. To work, the gaseous diffusion process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging. It had to be extremely porous, but strong enough to handle the high pressures. And, like everything else, it had to resist corrosion from uranium hexafluoride. The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the <a href="Bell%20Telephone%20Laboratories">Bell Telephone Laboratories</a> experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the <a href="City%20College%20of%20New%20York">City College of New York</a> worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior decorator, who had developed a very fine metal mesh for use with a <a href="spray%20gun">spray gun</a>. Their design appeared too brittle and fragile for the proposed use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope that this could be overcome.
In 1943, Urey brought in <a href="Hugh%20Stott%20Taylor">Hugh S. Taylor</a> from <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> to look at the problem of a usable barrier. Libby made progress on understanding the chemistry of uranium hexafluoride, leading to ideas on how to prevent corrosion and plugging. Chemical researchers at the SAM Laboratories studied <a href="fluorocarbons">fluorocarbons</a>, which resisted corrosion, and could be used as lubricants and coolants in the gaseous diffusion plant. Despite this progress, the K-25 Project was in serious trouble without a suitable barrier, and by August 1943 it was facing cancellation. On 13 August Groves informed the Military Policy Committee, the senior committee that steered the Manhattan Project, that gaseous diffusion enrichment in excess of 50 percent was probably infeasible, and that the gaseous diffusion plant would be limited to producing product with a lower enrichment that could be fed into the <a href="calutron">calutron</a>s of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant. Urey therefore began preparations to mass-produce the Norris-Adler barrier, despite its problems.

Meanwhile, Union Carbide and Kellex had made researchers at the Bakelite Corporation, a subsidiary of Union Carbide, aware of Nix's unsuccessful efforts with powdered nickel barriers. To Frazier Groff and other researchers at Bakelite's laboratories in <a href="Bound%20Brook%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bound Brook, New Jersey</a>, it seemed that Nix was not taking advantage of the latest techniques, and they began their own development efforts. Both Bell and Bound Brook sent samples of their powdered nickel barriers to Taylor for evaluation, but he was unimpressed; neither had come up with a practical barrier. At Kellogg's laboratory in <a href="Jersey%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Jersey City, New Jersey</a>, Clarence A. Johnson, who was aware of the steps taken by the SAM laboratories to improve the Norris-Adler barrier, realized that they could also be taken with the Bakelite barrier. The result was a barrier better than either, although still short of what was required. At a meeting at Columbia with the Army in attendance on 20 October 1943, Keith proposed switching the development effort to the Johnson barrier. Urey balked at this, fearing that this would destroy morale at the SAM Laboratories. The issue was put to Groves at a meeting on 3 November 1943, and he decided to pursue development of both the Johnson and Norris-Adler barriers.

Groves summoned British help, in the form of <a href="Wallace%20Akers">Wallace Akers</a> and fifteen members of the British gaseous diffusion project, who would review the progress made thus far. Their verdict was that while the new barrier was potentially superior, Keith's undertaking to build a new facility to produce the new barrier in just four months, produce all the barriers required in another four and have the production facility up and running in just twelve "would be something of a miraculous achievement". On 16 January 1944, Groves ruled in favor of the Johnson barrier. Johnson built a pilot plant for the new process at the Nash Building. Taylor analyzed the sample barriers produced and pronounced only 5 percent of them to be of acceptable quality. Edward Mack Jr. created his own pilot plant at Schermerhorn Hall at Columbia, and Groves obtained of nickel from the <a href="International%20Nickel%20Company">International Nickel Company</a>. With plenty of nickel to work with, by April 1944, both pilot plants were producing barriers of acceptable quality 45 percent of the time.

The site chosen was at the <a href="Clinton%20Engineer%20Works">Clinton Engineer Works</a> in Tennessee. The area was inspected by representatives of the Manhattan District, Kellex and Union Carbide on 18 January 1943. Consideration was also given to sites near the <a href="Shasta%20Dam">Shasta Dam</a> in California and the <a href="Big%20Bend%20Country">Big Bend of the Columbia River</a> in Washington state. The lower humidity of these areas made them more suitable for a gaseous diffusion plant, but the Clinton Engineer Works site was immediately available and otherwise suitable. Groves decided on the site in April 1943.

Under the contract, Kellex had responsibility not just for the design and engineering of the K-25 plant, but for its construction as well. The prime construction contractor was <a href="J.%20A.%20Jones%20Construction">J. A. Jones Construction</a> from <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a>. It had impressed Groves with its work on several major Army construction projects, such as <a href="Camp%20Shelby%2C%20Mississippi">Camp Shelby, Mississippi</a>. There were over 60 subcontractors. Kellex engaged another construction company, Ford, Bacon & Davis, to build the fluorine and nitrogen facilities, and the conditioning plant. Construction work was initially the responsibility of Lieutenant Colonel Warren George, the Chief of the Construction Division of the Clinton Engineer Works. Major W. P. Cornelius became the construction officer responsible for K-25 works on 31 July 1943. He was answerable to Stowers back in Manhattan. He became Chief of the Construction Division on 1 March 1946. J. J. Allison was the resident engineer from Kellex, and Edwin L. Jones, the General Manager of J. A. Jones.

Construction began before completion of the design for the gaseous diffusion process. Due to the large amount of electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant. While the <a href="Tennessee%20Valley%20Authority">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost the gaseous diffusion plant weeks of work, and the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure. The Kellex engineers were also attracted to the idea of being able to generate the variable frequency current required by the gaseous diffusion process without complicated transformers.

A site was chosen for this on the western edge of the Clinton Engineer Works site where it could draw cold water from the <a href="Clinch%20River">Clinch River</a> and discharge warm water into <a href="Poplar%20Creek%20%28Tennessee%29">Poplar Creek</a> without affecting the inflow. Groves approved this location on 3 May 1943. Surveying began on the power plant site on 31 May 1943, and J. A. Jones started construction work the following day. Because the bedrock was below the surface, the power plant was supported on 40 concrete-filled caissons. Installation of the first boiler commenced in October 1943. Construction work was complete by late September. To prevent sabotage, the power plant was connected to the gaseous diffusion plant by an underground conduit. Despite this, there was one act of sabotage, in which a nail was driven through the electric cable. The culprit was never found, but was considered more likely to be a disgruntled employee than an Axis spy.

Electric power in the United States was generated at 60 Hertz; the power house was able to generate variable frequencies between 45 and 60 Hertz, and constant frequencies of 60 and 120 Hertz. This capability was not ultimately required, and all but one of the K-25 systems ran on a constant 60 Hertz, the exception using a constant 120 Hertz. The first coal-fired boiler was started on 7 April 1944, followed by the second on 14 July 1944 and the third on 2 November 1944. Each produced of steam an hour at a pressure of and a temperature of . To obtain the fourteen turbine generators needed, Groves had to use the Manhattan Project's priority to overrule <a href="Julius%20Albert%20Krug">Julius Albert Krug</a>, the director of the Office of War Utilities. The turbine generators had a combined output of 238,000 kilowatts. The power plant could also receive power from TVA. It was decommissioned in the 1960s and demolished in 1995.

A site for the K-25 facility was chosen near the high school of the now-abandoned town of <a href="Wheat%2C%20Tennessee">Wheat</a>. As the dimensions of the K-25 facility became more apparent, it was decided to move it to a larger site near Poplar Creek, closer to the power plant. This site was approved on 24 June 1943. Considerable work was required to prepare the site. Existing roads in the area were improved to take heavy traffic. A new road was built to connect the site to <a href="US%20Route%2070">US Route 70</a>, and another, long, to connect with <a href="Tennessee%20State%20Route%2061">Tennessee State Route 61</a>. An old ferry over the Clinch River was upgraded, and then replaced with a bridge in December 1943. A railroad spur was run from <a href="Blair%2C%20Tennessee">Blair, Tennessee</a>, to the K-25 site. Some of sidings were also provided. The first carload of freight traversed the line on 18 September 1943.
It was initially intended that the construction workers should live off-site, but the poor condition of the roads and a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting long and difficult, and in turn made it difficult to find and retain workers. Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The J. A. Jones camp for K-25 workers, known as Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. This required 8 dormitories, 17 barracks, 1,590 hutments, 1,153 trailers and 100 Victory Houses. A pumping station was built to supply drinking water from the Clinch River, along with a water treatment plant. Amenities included a school, eight cafeterias, a bakery, theater, three recreation halls, a warehouse and a cold storage plant. Ford, Bacon & Davis established a smaller camp for 2,100 people. Responsibility for the camps was transferred to the Roane-Anderson Company on 25 January 1946, and the school was transferred to district control in March 1946.

Work began on the main facility area on 20 October 1943. Although generally flat, some of soil and rock had to be excavated from areas up to high, and six major areas had to be filled in, to a maximum depth of . Normally buildings containing complicated heavy machinery would rest on concrete columns down to the bedrock, but this would have required thousands of columns of different length. To save time <a href="soil%20compaction">soil compaction</a> was used instead. Layers were laid down and compacted with sheepsfoot rollers in the areas that had to be filled in, and the footings were laid over compacted soil in the low-lying areas and the undisturbed soil in the areas that had been excavated. Activities overlapped, so concrete pouring began while <a href="grading%20%28engineering%29">grading</a> was still going on. <a href="Crane%20%28machine%29">Cranes</a> started lifting the steel frames into place on 19 January 1944.
Kellex's design for the main process building of K-25 called for a four-story U-shaped structure long containing 51 main process buildings and 3 purge cascade buildings. These were divided into nine sections. Within these were cells of six stages. The cells could be operated independently, or consecutively, within a section. Similarly, the sections could be operated separately or as part of a single cascade. When completed, there were 2,892 stages. The basement housed the auxiliary equipment, such as the transformers, switch gears, and air conditioning systems. The ground floor contained the cells. The third level contained the piping. The fourth floor was the operating floor, which contained the control room, and the hundreds of instrument panels. From here, the operators monitored the process. The first section was ready for test runs on 17 April 1944, although the barriers were not yet ready to be installed.

The main process building surpassed <a href="The%20Pentagon">The Pentagon</a> as the largest building in the world, with a floor area of , and an enclosed volume of . Construction required of concrete, and of gas pipes. Because uranium hexafluoride corrodes steel, and steel piping had to be coated in nickel, smaller pipes were made of copper or <a href="monel">monel</a>. The equipment operated under vacuum pressures, so plumbing had to be air tight. Special efforts were made to create as clean an environment as possible to areas where piping or fixtures were being installed. J. A. Jones established a special cleanliness unit on 18 April 1944. Buildings were completely sealed off, air was filtered, and all cleaning was with vacuum cleaners and mopping. Workers wore white lintless gloves. At the peak of construction activity in May 1945, 25,266 people were employed on the site.

Although by far the largest, the main process building (K-300) was but one of many that made up the facility. There was a conditioning building (K-1401), where piping and equipment were cleaned prior to installation. A feed purification building (K-101), was built to remove impurities from the uranium hexafluoride, but never operated as such because the suppliers provided feed good enough to be fed into the gaseous diffusion process. The three-storey surge and waste removal building (K-601) processed the "tail" stream of depleted uranium hexafluoride. The air conditioning building (K-1401) provided not cool air, but per minute of clean, dry air. The compressed air plant (K-1201) contained compressors. The nitrogen plant (K-1408) provided nitrogen gas that was used as a pump sealant and to protect equipment from moist air.
The fluorine generating plant (K-1300) generated, bottled and stored fluorine. It had not been in great demand before the war, and Kellex and the Manhattan District considered four different processes for large-scale production. A process developed by the <a href="Hooker%20Chemical%20Company">Hooker Chemical Company</a> was chosen. Due to the hazardous nature of fluorine, it was decided that shipping it across the United States was inadvisable, and that it should be manufactured on site at the Clinton Engineer Works. Two pump houses (K-801 and K-802) and two cooling towers (H-801 and H-802) provided of cooling water per day for the motors and compressors.

The administration building (K-1001) provided of office space. A laboratory building (K-1401) contained facilities for testing and analyzing feed and product. Five drum warehouses (K-1025-A to -E) had of floor space to store drums of uranium hexafluoride. Originally this was on the K-27 site. The buildings were moved on a truck to make way for K-27. There were also warehouses for general stores (K-1035), spare parts (K-1036) and equipment (K-1037). A cafeteria (K-1002) provided meal facilities, including a <a href="Racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States">segregated</a> lunch room for African Americans. There were three changing houses (K-1008-A, B and C), a dispensary (K-1003), an instrument repair building (K-1024), and a fire station (K-1021).

In mid-January 1945, Kellex proposed an extension to K-25 to allow product enrichment of up to 85 percent. Grove initially approved this, but later canceled it in favor of a 540-stage side feed unit, which became known as K-27, that could process a slightly enriched product. This could then be fed into K-25 or the <a href="calutrons">calutrons</a> at the <a href="Y-12%20National%20Security%20Complex">Y-12</a>. Kellex estimated that using the enriched feed from K-27 could lift the output from K-25 from 35 to 60 percent uranium-235. Construction started at K-27 on 3 April 1945, and was completed in December 1945. The construction work was expedited by making it "virtually a Chinese copy" of a section of K-25. By 31 December 1946, when the Manhattan Project ended, 110,048,961 man-hours of construction work had been performed at the K-25 site. The total cost, including that of K-27, was $479,589,999.

The preliminary specification for the K-25 plant in March 1943 called for it to produce a day of product that was 90 percent uranium-235. As the practical difficulties were realized, this target was reduced to 36 percent. On the other hand, the cascade design meant that construction did not need to be complete before the plant started operating. In August 1943, Kellex submitted a schedule that called for a capability to produce material enriched to 5 percent uranium-235 by 1 June 1945, 15 percent by 1 July 1945, and 36 percent by 23 August 1945. This schedule was revised in August 1944 to 0.9 percent by 1 January 1945, 5 percent by 10 June 1945, 15 percent by 1 August 1945, 23 percent by 13 September 1945, and 36 percent as soon as possible after that.

A meeting between the Manhattan District and Kellogg on 12 December 1942 recommended that the K-25 plant be operated by Union Carbide. This would be through a wholly owned subsidiary, Carbon and Carbide Chemicals. A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract was signed on 18 January 1943, setting the fee at $75,000 per month. This was later increased to $96,000 a month to operate both K-25 and K-27. Union Carbide did not wish to be the sole operator of the facility. Union Carbide suggested that the conditioning plant be built and operated by Ford, Bacon & Davis. The Manhattan District found this acceptable, and a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract was negotiated with a fee of $216,000 for services up to the end of June 1945. The contract was terminated early on 1 May 1945, when Union Carbide took over the plant. Ford, Bacon & Davis was therefore paid $202,000. The other exception was the fluorine plant. Hooker Chemical was asked to supervise its construction of the fluorine plant, and initially to operate it for a fixed fee of $24,500. The plant was turned over to Union Carbide on 1 February 1945.
Part of the K-300 complex was taken over by Union Carbide in August 1944, and was run as a pilot plant, training operators and developing procedures, using nitrogen instead of uranium hexafluoride until October 1944, and then <a href="perfluoroheptane">perfluoroheptane</a> until April 1945. The design of the gaseous diffusion plant allowed for it to be completed in sections, and for these to be put into operation while work continued on the others. J. A. Jones completed the first 60 stages by the end of 1944. Before each stage was accepted, it underwent tests by J. A. Jones, Carbide and Carbon and SAM Laboratories technicians to verify that the equipment was working and that there were no leaks. Between four and six hundred people devoted eight months to this testing. Perfluoroheptane was used as a test fluid until February 1945, when it was decided to use uranium hexafluoride despite its corrosive nature.

The Manhattan District engineer, Colonel <a href="Kenneth%20Nichols">Kenneth Nichols</a>, placed Major John J. Moran in charge of production at K-25.
Production commenced in February 1945, and the first product was shipped to the calutrons in March. By April, the gaseous diffusion plant was producing 1.1 percent product. It was then decided that instead of processing uranium hexafluoride feed from the Harshaw Chemical Company, the gaseous diffusion plant would take the product of the <a href="S-50%20%28Manhattan%20Project%29">S-50 thermal diffusion</a> plant, with an average enrichment of about 0.85 percent. Product enrichment continued to improve, as more stages came online and performed better than anticipated. In June product was being enriched to 7 percent; by September it was 23 percent. The S-50 plant ceased operation on 9 September, and Kellex transferred the last unit to Union Carbide on 11 September 1945. Highly enriched uranium was used in the <a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a> atomic bomb used in the <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">bombing of Hiroshima</a> on 6 August 1945.
With the end of the war in August 1945, the Manhattan Project's priority shifted from speed to economy and efficiency. The cascades were configurable, so they could produce a large amount of slightly enriched product by running them in parallel, or a small amount of highly enriched product through running them in series. By early 1946, with K-27 in operation, the facility was producing per day, enriched to 30 percent. The next step was to increase the enrichment further to 60 percent. This was achieved on 20 July 1946. This presented a problem, because Y-12 was not equipped to handle feed that was so highly enriched, but the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a> required 95 percent. For a time, product was mixed with feed to reduce the enrichment to 30 percent. Taking the concentration up to 95 percent raised safety concerns, as there was the risk of a <a href="criticality%20accident">criticality accident</a>.

After some deliberation, with opinions sought and obtained from Percival Keith, <a href="Norris%20Bradbury">Norris Bradbury</a>, <a href="Darol%20Froman">Darol Froman</a>, <a href="Elmer%20E.%20Kirkpatrick">Elmer E. Kirkpatrick</a>, Kenneth Nichols and <a href="Edward%20Teller">Edward Teller</a>, it was decided that this could be done safely if appropriate precautions were taken. On 28 November 1946, the K-25 plant began producing 94 percent product. At this point, they ran into a serious flaw in the gaseous diffusion concept: enrichment in uranium-235 also enriched the product in the unwanted and fairly useless uranium-234, making it difficult to raise the enrichment to 95 percent. On 6 December 1946, production was dropped back to a steady per day enriched to 93.7 percent uranium-235, along with 1.9 percent uranium-234. This was regarded as a satisfactory product by the Los Alamos Laboratory, so on 26 December 1946 enrichment activity at Y-12 was curtailed. The Manhattan Project ended a few days later. Responsibility for the K-25 facility then passed to the new <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> on 1 January 1947.

K-25 became a prototype for other gaseous diffusion facilities established in the early post-war years. The first of these was the K-27 completed in September 1945. It was followed by the K-29 in 1951, the K-31 in 1951 and the K-33 in 1954. Further gaseous diffusion facilities were built at <a href="Paducah%20Gaseous%20Diffusion%20Plant">Paducah, Kentucky</a> in 1952, and <a href="Portsmouth%20Gaseous%20Diffusion%20Plant">Portsmouth, Ohio</a> in 1954. The K-25 plant was renamed the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant in 1955. Today, uranium isotope separation is usually done by the more energy-efficient <a href="Zippe-type%20centrifuge">ultra centrifuge</a> process, developed in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Centrifuge cascades began operating at Oak Ridge in 1961. A gas centrifuge test facility (K-1210) opened in 1975, followed by a larger centrifuge plant demonstration facility (K-1220) in 1982. In response to an order from President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> to cut production of enriched uranium by 25 percent, K-25 and K-27 ceased production in 1964, but in 1969 K-25 began producing uranium enriched to 3 to 5 percent for use in <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s. <a href="Martin%20Marietta">Martin Marietta</a> Energy replaced Union Carbide as the operator in 1984. Gaseous diffusion finally ceased on 27 August 1985. The Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant was renamed the Oak Ridge K-25 Site in 1989, and the East Tennessee Technology Park in 1996. Production of enriched uranium ceased in Portsmouth in 2001, and at Paducah in 2013.
The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy">United States Department of Energy</a> (DOE) contracted with <a href="British%20Nuclear%20Fuels%20Ltd">British Nuclear Fuels Ltd</a> (BNFL) in 1997 to decontaminate and decommission the facilities. Its subsidiary Reactor Sites Management Company Limited (RSMC) was acquired by <a href="EnergySolutions">EnergySolutions</a> in June 2007. Initially K-29, K-31 and K-33 were to be retained for other uses, but it was subsequently decided to demolish them. <a href="Bechtel%20Jacobs">Bechtel Jacobs</a>, the environmental management contractor, assumed responsibility for the facility in July 2005. Demolition of K-29 began in January 2006, and was completed in August. Demolition of K-33 began in January 2011, and was completed ahead of schedule in September 2011. It was followed by the demolition of K-31, which began on 8 October 2014, and was completed on 26 June 2015.

Bechtel Jacobs was contracted to dismantle and demolish the K-25 facility in September 2008. The contract, valued at $1.48 billion, was made retrospective to October 2007, and ended in August 2011. Since then demolition work has been carried out by DOE's current environmental management contractor, URS | <a href="CH2M%20Hill">CH2M Hill</a> Oak Ridge (UCOR). Demolition of the K-25 facility was expected to be completed by July 2014. By 23 January 2013, demolition of the north and west wings was complete, with only a small portion of the east wing remaining (6 units out of 24 on the east wing). The final section of the east wing was brought down on 19 December 2013. The last debris was removed in 2014. Demolition of K-27, the last of the five gaseous diffusion facilities at Oak Ridge, commenced in February 2016. Dignitaries including <a href="US%20Senator">US Senator</a> <a href="Lamar%20Alexander">Lamar Alexander</a> and <a href="US%20Congressman">US Congressman</a> <a href="Chuck%20Fleischmann">Chuck Fleischmann</a> joined 1,500 workers to watch its final wall come down on 30 August 2016. Its demolition was completed on 28 February 2017.

Art Ross

Arthur Howey "Art" Ross (January 13, 1885 – August 5, 1964) was a Canadian professional <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> player and <a href="corporate%20officer">executive</a> from 1905 until 1954. Regarded as one of the best defenders of his era by his peers, he was one of the first to skate with the puck up the ice rather than pass it to a forward. He was on <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> championship teams twice in a playing career that lasted thirteen seasons; in <a href="1907%20ECAHA%20season%23Stanley%20Cup%20challenges">January 1907</a> with the <a href="Kenora%20Thistles">Kenora Thistles</a> and <a href="1908%20ECAHA%20season%23Stanley%20Cup%20challenges">1908</a> with the <a href="Montreal%20Wanderers">Montreal Wanderers</a>. Like other players of the time, Ross played for several different teams and leagues, and is most notable for his time with the Wanderers while they were members of the <a href="National%20Hockey%20Association">National Hockey Association</a> (NHA) and its successor, the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL). In 1911 he led one of the first organized player strikes over increased pay. When the Wanderers' home arena burned down in January 1918, the team ceased operations and Ross retired as a player.

After several years as an <a href="on-ice%20official">on-ice official</a>, he was named head coach of the <a href="Hamilton%20Tigers%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Hamilton Tigers</a> for one season. When the <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a> were formed in 1924, Ross was hired as <a href="List%20of%20Boston%20Bruins%20head%20coaches">the first coach</a> and general manager of the team. He would go on to coach the team on three separate occasions until 1945 and stayed as general manager until his retirement in 1954. Ross helped the Bruins finish first place in the league ten times and to win the Stanley Cup three times; Ross personally coached the team to two of those victories. After being hired by the Bruins, Ross, along with his wife and two sons, moved to a suburb of Boston, and became an American citizen in 1938. He died near Boston in 1964.

Outside of his association with the Bruins, Ross also helped to improve the game. He created a style of <a href="Puck%20%28sports%29">hockey puck</a> still used today, and advocated an improved style of goal nets, a change that lasted forty years. In 1947 Ross donated the <a href="Art%20Ross%20Trophy">Art Ross Trophy</a>, awarded to the leading scorer of the NHL regular season. Ross was inducted into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> in 1949.

Ross was born January 13, 1885, in <a href="Walden%2C%20Ontario">Naughton</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>. His father, Thomas Barnston Ross, was the head of a <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> trading post in the area. The ninth of ten children, Ross grew up speaking both English and <a href="Ojibwe%20language">Ojibwe</a>, a <a href="Aboriginal%20peoples%20in%20Canada">native Canadian</a> language. Ross moved to <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> in 1902 to play in organized hockey leagues, living in the affluent <a href="Westmount">Westmount</a> district. He played high school and junior hockey with <a href="Lester%20Patrick">Lester</a> and <a href="Frank%20Patrick%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Frank Patrick</a>, both of whom were later inducted into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a>. Ross and Lester had a financially successful <a href="ticket%20resale">ticket resale</a> business at the <a href="Montreal%20Arena">Montreal Arena</a>, buying tickets for thirty-five cents and selling them for up to a dollar.

The best hockey players on their high school team, Ross and the Patrick brothers were invited to play occasional games for local league teams in Montreal. Ross first played in an organized league in 1905, joining Montreal Westmount of the <a href="Canadian%20Amateur%20Hockey%20League">Canadian Amateur Hockey League</a> (CAHL), the top amateur league in Canada. He scored ten goals in eight games during the <a href="1905%20CAHL%20season">season</a>. His opponents regarded him as one of the best rushing defencemen. Most defenders at the time either shot the puck down the ice or passed to a forward; in contrast, Ross skated up the ice, taking the puck into the offensive zone. Later that year, wishing to pursue a career in banking, he moved to <a href="Brandon%2C%20Manitoba">Brandon, Manitoba</a>, where he joined the Brandon Elks of the <a href="Manitoba%20Hockey%20Association">Manitoba Hockey League</a>, the senior league in the province. In 1906, his first season, he scored six goals in seven games while he recorded six goals in ten games in 1907. Around this time, the <a href="Kenora%20Thistles">Kenora Thistles</a>, the Manitoba League champions, wanted to strengthen their team for the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> challenge against the <a href="Montreal%20Wanderers">Montreal Wanderers</a> in Montreal during <a href="1907%20ECAHA%20season%23Wanderers%20vs.%20Kenora%20at%20Montreal">January 1907</a>. They paid Ross <a href="Canadian%20dollar">$</a>1,000 to play both matches, a common practice at the time, and the Thistles won the Cup. While failing to score, Ross started many plays and proved an important part of the team. Although he played for the opposing team, he received a good reception from the Montreal crowd. Ross did not play for the Thistles when the two teams played for the Cup again in March, which the Wanderers won to take back the Cup.

The following year Ross moved back to Montreal. He joined the Wanderers, the team he had helped to defeat, who played in the <a href="Eastern%20Canada%20Amateur%20Hockey%20Association">Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association</a> (ECAHA), the successor league to the CAHL as the premier league in the country. He scored eight goals in ten games over the two-month season that lasted from January to March. He helped the team to finish first in the ECAHA and retain the Cup in 1908 with challenges from <a href="Ottawa%20Victorias">Ottawa</a>, <a href="Winnipeg%20Maple%20Leafs">Winnipeg</a> and <a href="Toronto%20%28OPHL%29">Toronto</a>. The Wanderers were Cup champions throughout these challenges, so Ross became the second player to win the Cup with different teams in consecutive years, after <a href="Jack%20Marshall%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Jack Marshall</a> in 1901 and 1902. In January 1908, he participated in the first <a href="all-star%20game">all-star game</a> in sports history, a benefit for the family of former Wanderer defender <a href="Hod%20Stuart">Hod Stuart</a>, who died the previous summer. Aside from his time with the Wanderers, Ross repeated his practice of playing for other teams who paid for his services in important matches. For the <a href="1909%20ECAHA%20season">1909 season</a> Ross demanded a salary of $1,600. Although he settled for $1,200, the average salary of hockey players at the time was $600. Ross received a cash bonus of $400 to play in a Stanley Cup challenge against a team from Edmonton in December 1908, in which the Wanderers won the two-game, total-goal series 13–10. He finished the season with two goals in nine games.

A new league, the <a href="Canadian%20Hockey%20Association%20%281909%E2%80%931910%29">Canadian Hockey Association</a> (CHA), was formed in late November 1909. One of the teams, the <a href="All-Montreal%20Hockey%20Club">All-Montreal Hockey Club</a>, hired Ross as a playing-manager, but the league only lasted to mid-January 1910 before disbanding. Ross, who scored four goals in four games in the CHA, then signed with the <a href="Haileybury%20Comets">Haileybury Comets</a> of the <a href="National%20Hockey%20Association">National Hockey Association</a> (NHA), a league formed in December 1909, which proved to be the stronger replacement to the ECAHA as the highest level of hockey in Canada. He received $2,700 to play in the <a href="1910%20NHA%20season">1910 season</a>, which lasted from January to March, playing twelve games for the team and finishing with six goals. Before the following season, the NHA imposed a <a href="salary%20cap">salary cap</a> of $5,000 per team. The players, including Ross, were unhappy as this would result in a pay decrease, and began looking to form their own league without a cap. Ross wrote to the "Montreal Herald", stating "all the players want is a fair deal ... The players are not trying to bulldoze the NHA, but we want to know where we get off at." The plans were abandoned when they realized all the suitable arenas would be unavailable as they were owned or leased by the NHA. Ross scored four goals in eleven games with the Wanderers, who finished fourth in the five team league. During a match against the <a href="Quebec%20Bulldogs">Quebec Bulldogs</a> on February 25, 1911, Ross knocked out <a href="Eddie%20Oatman">Eddie Oatman</a> in a fight, provoking a massive brawl between the two teams, which the police had to break up. The fight helped to increase the reputation Ross had as a tough player unwilling to back down from any opponent. The <a href="1912%E2%80%9313%20NHA%20season">following season</a> Ross had eleven goals in nineteen games as the Wanderers improved to second in the league.
Prior to the <a href="1913%E2%80%9314%20NHA%20season">1913–14 NHA season</a>, Ross refused to sign a contract for the Wanderers, requesting a salary increase. As one of the top players on the team, the Wanderers agreed to his demands of $1,500 for the forthcoming season, in which he finished with four goals and nine points in eighteen games. The <a href="1914%E2%80%9315%20NHA%20season">next season</a> Ross, again concerned with his salary, began negotiating with other players in the NHA to leave their teams and form a new league that would offer higher wages. These actions resulted in his suspension in November 1914 by <a href="Emmett%20Quinn">Emmett Quinn</a>, president of the NHA. Ross responded by declaring himself a free agent and claiming his contract with the Wanderers was no longer valid. Consequently, although having no technical power to do so, Quinn suspended Ross from all organized hockey. The proposed new league failed to materialize and Ross applied for reinstatement to the NHA, which was granted at a meeting of the team owners on December 18, 1914. The owners realized if they suspended Ross, they would also have to suspend all those he signed, hurting the league. However, Ross's actions led to his release by the Wanderers. At first he trained with the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>, then joined the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators%20%28original%29">Ottawa Senators</a>.

At the conclusion of the 1914–15 season, the Senators and Wanderers finished with identical records of fourteen wins and six losses. A two-game, total goal series was played to determine the NHA league champion who would contest the Stanley Cup with the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20Hockey%20Association">Pacific Coast Hockey Association</a> winner, the <a href="Vancouver%20Millionaires">Vancouver Millionaires</a>. Ross, who finished with three goals in sixteen games in the season, scored one goal in the first match against the Wanderers, a Senators 4–0 victory, and though Ottawa lost the second game 1–0, they won the series, 4–1. To help the Senators stop the Wanderers, who were known for their speed, Ross created a new system of defence. Termed "kitty bar the door", it required three defenders to align themselves across the ice 30 feet in front of the goaltender to stop offensive rushes. This style of defence would later be used in a modified version known as the <a href="neutral%20zone%20trap">neutral zone trap</a>, later used widely to stop opposition offensive chances.

The following year Ross, who had eight goals and eight assists in twenty-one games, was the second highest paid player on the team; his salary of $1,400 was $100 less than <a href="Frank%20Nighbor">Frank Nighbor</a> made. Even so, Ross left the team in 1916, returning to Montreal in order to look after his sporting-goods store, and rejoining the Wanderers. He scored six goals and had two assists in sixteen games for the team. 

The Wanderers, along with the Montreal Canadiens, <a href="Toronto%20Arenas">Toronto Arenas</a>, Quebec Bulldogs and Ottawa Senators dissolved the NHA and founded the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) in November 1917. Ross became coach of the Wanderers and played in the first game in NHL history on December 19, 1917, in which the Wanderers defeated the Toronto Arenas 10-9, in Montreal; Ross earned the league's first penalty during the game and also scored his first and only NHL goal. A fire on January 2, 1918, destroyed their home, the <a href="Montreal%20Arena">Montreal Arena</a>, and forced them to fold after four games. However, the NHL insisted the team continue to play, and recorded two additional scheduled matches as defaulted losses for the Wanderers, even though the matches were not played. With the Wanderers disbanded, Ross retired as a player. His NHL career yielded one goal in three games played.

Ross began his career as a hockey coach in the midst of his playing days, when at age 24 he led the <a href="McGill%20University">McGill University</a> <a href="Mcgill%20University%20Redmen">Redmen</a> to a 4–2–1 record during the 1910–11 season. Following his playing career, Ross became a NHL referee. He was hired to coach the <a href="Hamilton%20Tigers%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Hamilton Tigers</a> for the <a href="1922%E2%80%9323%20NHL%20season">1922–23 season</a>, and adopted new methods in training camp that emphasized physical fitness, including work off the ice. However, the Tigers finished with a record of six wins and eighteen losses, last in the NHL for the third successive year, and Ross did not return the next season. His next coaching appointment arose from meeting Boston grocery store magnate <a href="Charles%20Adams%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Charles Adams</a> during the <a href="1924%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1924 Stanley Cup Finals</a>. Before the <a href="1924%E2%80%9325%20NHL%20season">1924 season</a>, the NHL awarded Adams an <a href="expansion%20team">expansion team</a>. Adams' first move was to hire Ross as vice president, general manager, coach and scout. Adams instructed Ross to come up with a nickname portraying an untamed animal displaying speed, agility and cunning. With this in mind, Ross named the team the <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a>, after the Old English word for a bear. The team's nickname went perfectly with the original colours of brown and yellow, which were the same colours of Adams' grocery chain, First National Stores.

Ross utilized his many hockey connections throughout Canada and the United States to sign players. Even so, the team started poorly. Early in the first season the <a href="Varsity%20Blues%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">University of Toronto hockey team</a> was in Boston for matches against local universities. The team's manager, <a href="Conn%20Smythe">Conn Smythe</a>, who later owned and managed the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>, said that his team could easily defeat the Bruins—Ross's team had won only two of their first fifteen NHL games. This began a feud between Smythe and Ross which lasted for over 40 years, until Ross' death; while mostly confined to newspaper reports, they refused to speak to each other at NHL Board of Governor meetings. The Bruins finished their <a href="1924%E2%80%9325%20NHL%20season">first season</a> with six wins in thirty games, one of the worst records in the history of the league. Several records were set over the course of the season; the three home wins are tied for the second fewest ever, and an eleven-game losing streak from December 8, 1924, until February 17, 1925, set a record for longest losing streak, surpassed in 2004 and now second longest in history. With 17 wins in 36 games the <a href="1925%E2%80%9326%20NHL%20season">following season</a>, the team greatly improved, and finished one point out of a playoff spot.

In 1926 the <a href="Western%20Canada%20Hockey%20League">Western Hockey League</a>, the other top professional hockey league, was in decline. The Patrick brothers, who controlled the league, offered to sell the remaining five teams for $300,000. Ross realized the potential talent available and convinced Adams to pay the money. As a result, the Bruins acquired the rights to several future <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a> players, the most notable being defender <a href="Eddie%20Shore">Eddie Shore</a>. Ross signed goaltender <a href="Cecil%20%26quot%3BTiny%26quot%3B%20Thompson">Cecil "Tiny" Thompson</a> in 1928, who was with a team in <a href="Minneapolis%20Millers%20%28AHA%29">Minnesota</a>, despite never watching him play; <a href="Ralph%20%26quot%3BCooney%26quot%3B%20Weiland">Ralph "Cooney" Weiland</a> was also brought over from Minnesota. Ross acquired <a href="Cy%20Denneny">Cy Denneny</a> from Ottawa and made him a player-assistant-coach while he assumed the role of coach and team manager. On November 20, 1928, the Bruins moved to a new arena when the <a href="Boston%20Garden">Boston Garden</a> opened. The team played the Canadiens who won the match 1–0 in front of 16,000 fans. The players signed by Ross helped the Bruins to improve quickly, and they won the Stanley Cup in <a href="1929%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1929</a>. Denneny retired after the Cup win, Ross guiding the team to several league records in the <a href="1929%E2%80%9330%20NHL%20season">1929–30 season</a>. The team won 38 of 44 games for an .875 winning percentage, the highest in league history; the five losses tied a record for fewest ever, and the four road losses tied a record for second fewest. The Bruins also only finished one game in a tie, a record for fewest ties in a season since the NHL began recording the record in 1926. One of the longest winning streaks was also set during the season. From December 3, 1929, until January 9, 1930, the team won fourteen games in a row, a record that lasted until 1982 and now tied for third longest, as of October 2010. A home winning streak began the same day and lasted for twenty games, until March 18, 1930, which was tied for the longest of its kind in 1976. In <a href="1930%E2%80%9331%20NHL%20season">1930–31</a>, the Bruins again lost only one home game, which equalled their previous record.

On March 26, 1931, Ross substituted a sixth skater for goaltender <a href="Tiny%20Thompson">Tiny Thompson</a> in the final minute of play in a playoff game against the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>. Although the Bruins lost the game 1–0, Ross became the first coach to replace his goaltender with an <a href="extra%20attacker">extra attacker</a>, a tactic which became widespread practice in hockey. Stepping aside as coach in 1934 to focus on managing the team, Ross hired Frank Patrick as coach with a salary of $10,500, which was high for such a role. However rumours spread during the season that Patrick was drinking heavily and not being as strict with the players as Ross wanted. After the Bruins lost their playoff series with the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> in the 1936 playoffs, the result of an 8–1 score in the second game, a newspaper claimed that Patrick had been drinking the day of the game and had trouble controlling the team. Several days later, Ross relieved Patrick of his duties and once again assumed the role of coach.

Ross took over an improved team. He had recently signed three players, <a href="Milt%20Schmidt">Milt Schmidt</a>, <a href="Bobby%20Bauer">Bobby Bauer</a> and <a href="Woody%20Dumart">Woody Dumart</a>, who all grew up together in <a href="Kitchener%2C%20Ontario">Kitchener, Ontario</a>, and had them play on the same line, soon nicknamed the <a href="Kraut%20Line">Kraut Line</a> in reference to the German heritage of all three. Along with them, Ross had acquired a new goaltender in 1938, <a href="Frank%20Brimsek">Frank Brimsek</a>; after Brimsek earned six <a href="shutouts">shutouts</a> in his first eight games, the Bruins traded away Tiny Thompson to allow Brimsek to play. With these players the Bruins finished first in the league in <a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20NHL%20season">1937–38</a>; Ross was named as the second best coach in the league, selected for the end of season <a href="NHL%20All-Star%20Team">All-Star Second Team</a>. The <a href="1938%E2%80%9339%20NHL%20season">next season</a> the Bruins won 36 of 48 games, and won the Stanley Cup in the <a href="1939%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">playoffs</a>; Ross was named to the First All-Star Team as the best coach in the league for the season and the team only tied two games, which is tied for the second fewest in a season. He hired the recently retired Cooney Weiland to coach the Bruins for the <a href="1939%E2%80%9340%20NHL%20season">1939–40 NHL season</a>. The Bruins would win the Cup again in <a href="1941%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1941</a>, and tied their record of only four away losses all season. Ross once again took over as coach of the team before the <a href="1941%E2%80%9342%20NHL%20season">1941–42 season</a> began, as Weiland became coach of the <a href="Hershey%20Bears">Hershey Bears</a> of the <a href="American%20Hockey%20League">American Hockey League</a>, and led the team to 25 wins in 48 games, which was enough to earn third place in the league. By this time the Second World War had caused several Bruins players, including the entire Kraut Line and goaltender Brimsek, to enlist in their respective armed forces. The Bruins finished second in the NHL during the <a href="1942%E2%80%9343%20NHL%20season">1942–43 season</a> with 24 wins in 50 games and Ross was again named in the Second NHL All-Star Team as second best coach in the league. The Bruins missed the playoffs in <a href="1943%E2%80%9344%20NHL%20season">1943–44</a>, the first time in ten years they failed to qualify, but returned to the playoffs the next season, something they did for five straight years.

In 1949, Ross had signed <a href="Georges%20Boucher">Georges Boucher</a> as coach, but Boucher did not work well with Ross and team president <a href="Weston%20Adams">Weston Adams</a>. Looking to hire a new coach in the summer of 1950, Ross phoned <a href="Lynn%20Patrick">Lynn Patrick</a>, the son of Lester, who had just resigned from the New York Rangers after coaching the team to the <a href="1950%20Stanley%20Cup%20Final">Stanley Cup Final</a>. Lynn had moved his family back to <a href="Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia">Victoria, British Columbia</a>, where he grew up as a child, with the intention of coaching the Victoria Cougars, a team in the minor professional <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20Hockey%20League">Pacific Coast Hockey League</a>. Though reluctant to move back to the eastern United States, Lynn was hired by Ross after he was offered a salary of $12,000. He would coach the team for the next four seasons and become the second general manager of the Bruins when Ross retired at the end of October 1954.

Aside from his career in hockey, Ross was interested in improving the game. Prior to the start of the <a href="1927%E2%80%9328%20NHL%20season">1927–28 season</a>, the NHL adopted a new style of goal net created by Ross. With the back molded into a B-shape, it was better designed to catch pucks and the net was used until 1984, when a modified version was adopted. He also improved the design of the puck. Ross' design had <a href="bevel">bevel</a> edges, which prevented it bouncing too much, and used synthetic rubber, rather than the natural rubber previously in vogue. Along with <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a> coach <a href="Frank%20Boucher">Frank Boucher</a>, Ross helped to create the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20rink%23Lines">red line</a>, which was introduced to help speed up the game by removing the ability for defenders to pass the puck from the defensive to offensive zone; until 2006 it was against the rules of hockey to make a <a href="offside%20%28ice%20hockey%29">two line pass</a>. More scoring chances resulted as teams could not simply send the puck down the ice with impunity. In order to help tell the red line and blue lines apart on television, Ross suggested that the red line be striped.

Regarded throughout his playing career as one of the best defenders in hockey, Ross was named to the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> in 1949, selected for his playing career rather than his work as an executive. A ceremony for his induction was held prior to a Bruins game on December 2, 1949, where he was given his Hall of Fame scroll and a silver tray with the emblems of the six NHL teams on it. In 1975 he was inducted into the <a href="Canada%27s%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Canadian Sports Hall of Fame</a>. Along with his two sons he donated the <a href="Art%20Ross%20Trophy">Art Ross Trophy</a> to the NHL in 1947, to be awarded to the leading scorer in the league's regular season. In 1984 he was posthumously awarded the <a href="Lester%20Patrick%20Trophy">Lester Patrick Trophy</a> for service to hockey in the United States.

A descriptive biography entitled "Art Ross: The Hockey Legend who Built the Bruins" by Eric Zweig was published by <a href="Dundurn%20Press">Dundurn Press</a> in Sept 2015.

Ross also excelled in baseball, <a href="Canadian%20football">football</a>, <a href="lacrosse">lacrosse</a> and <a href="motorcycle%20racing">motorcycle racing</a>. Before he became a hockey executive, he had a career as a bank clerk and ran a sporting-goods store in Montreal. Ross had moved to <a href="Brandon%2C%20Manitoba">Brandon, Manitoba</a>, in 1905 at the advice of his parents so he could get a job with a bank, with a salary of $600 per year. He gave that career up when he began playing hockey professionally. He was married to Muriel, a native of Montreal, and had two sons, Art and John. During the Second World War, both sons served in the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a>. After the war Ross made his son Art the business manager for the Bruins. Ross was named coach and manager of the <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a> in 1924 and moved his family to <a href="Brookline%2C%20Massachusetts">Brookline, Massachusetts</a>, a suburb of Boston, after being hired. In 1928, he served as the traveling secretary of the <a href="Boston%20Braves%20%28baseball%29">Boston Braves</a> baseball team, which was owned by Bruins owner Charles Adams. He became a <a href="United%20States%20nationality%20law">naturalized American citizen</a> on April 22, 1938. On August 5, 1964, Ross died at a nursing home in <a href="Medford%2C%20Massachusetts">Medford, Massachusetts</a>, a suburb of Boston, at the age of 79. A sister, both his sons, and three grandchildren survived him.

Nathu La

Nathu La (<a href="Devanagari">Devanagari</a> नाथू ला; , <a href="IAST">IAST</a>: "Nāthū Lā", ) is a <a href="mountain%20pass">mountain pass</a> in the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> in <a href="East%20Sikkim%20district">East Sikkim district</a>. It connects the <a href="India">India</a>n <a href="States%20and%20territories%20of%20India">state</a> of <a href="Sikkim">Sikkim</a> with <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">China's</a> <a href="Tibet%20Autonomous%20Region">Tibet Autonomous Region</a>. The pass, at above <a href="mean%20sea%20level">mean sea level</a>, forms a part of an offshoot of the ancient <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a>. "Nathu" means "listening ears" and "La" means "pass" in <a href="Standard%20Tibetan">Tibetan</a>. On the Indian side, the pass is east of <a href="Gangtok">Gangtok</a>, the capital of Sikkim. Only citizens of India can visit the pass, and then only after obtaining a permit in Gangtok.

Nathu La is one of the three open trading border posts between China and India; the others are <a href="Shipkila">Shipkila</a> in <a href="Himachal%20Pradesh">Himachal Pradesh</a> and <a href="Lipu-Lekh%20pass">Lipulekh</a> (or Lipulech) at the trisection point of <a href="Uttarakhand">Uttarakhand</a>–India, <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a> and China. Sealed by India after the 1962 <a href="Sino-Indian%20War">Sino-Indian War</a>, Nathu La was re-opened in 2006 following numerous bilateral trade agreements. The opening of the pass shortens the travel distance to important <a href="Hinduism">Hindu</a> and <a href="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> sites in the region and was expected to bolster the economy of the region by playing a key role in the growing Sino-Indian trade. However, trade is limited to specific types of goods and to specific days of the week.
It is also one of the five officially agreed <a href="Border%20Personnel%20Meeting%20point">Border Personnel Meeting point</a>s between the <a href="Indian%20Army">Indian Army</a> and the <a href="People%27s%20Liberation%20Army">People's Liberation Army</a> of China for regular consultations and interactions between the two armies to improve relations.

Nathu La is located on the Old Silk Route, an offshoot of the historic <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a>. The Old Silk Route connects <a href="Lhasa">Lhasa</a> in <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a> to the plains of <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a> to the south. In 1815, trade volume increased after the <a href="British%20Empire">British</a> annexed territories belonging to the Sikkimese, <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>ese, and <a href="Bhutan">Bhutan</a>ese. The potential of Nathu La was realised in 1873, after the <a href="Darjeeling">Darjeeling</a> <a href="Deputy%20Commissioner">Deputy Commissioner</a> published a report on the strategic importance of mountain passes between Sikkim and Tibet. In December 1893, the <a href="Chogyal">Sikkimese monarchy</a> and Tibetan rulers signed an agreement to increase trade between the two nations. The agreement culminated in 1894 when the trade pass was opened.

Nathu La played a vital role in the 1903–1904 <a href="British%20expedition%20to%20Tibet">British expedition to Tibet</a>, which sought to prevent the Russian Empire from interfering in Tibetan affairs and thus gaining a foothold in the region. In 1904, Major <a href="Francis%20Younghusband">Francis Younghusband</a>, serving as the British Commissioner to Tibet, led a successful mission through Nathu La to capture Lhasa. This led to the setting up of trading posts at <a href="Gyantse">Gyantse</a> and <a href="Gartok">Gartok</a> in Tibet, and gave control of the surrounding <a href="Chumbi%20Valley">Chumbi Valley</a> to the British. The following November, China and Great Britain ratified an agreement approving trade between Sikkim and Tibet.

In 1947 and 1948, a popular vote for Sikkim to join newly independent India failed and <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20India">Indian Prime Minister</a> <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> agreed to a special protectorate status for Sikkim. Sikkim agreed to be a protectorate nation and Indian troops were allowed to man its borders, including Nathu La. During this period, more than 1,000 mules and 700 people were involved in cross-border trade through Nathu La. In 1949, when the Tibetan government expelled the Chinese living there, most of the displaced Chinese returned home through the Nathu La–Sikkim–Kolkata route.

The current Dalai Lama, <a href="Tenzin%20Gyatso">Tenzin Gyatso</a>, used this pass to travel to India for the 2,500th birthday celebration of <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>, which was held between November 1956 and February 1957. Later, on 1 September 1958, Nehru, his daughter <a href="Indira%20Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a>, and <a href="Palden%20Thondup%20Namgyal">Palden Thondup Namgyal</a> (son of—and internal affairs adviser to—<a href="Tashi%20Namgyal">Tashi Namgyal</a>, the <a href="Chogyal">Chogyal</a> of Sikkim) used this pass to travel to nearby Bhutan.

After the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a> took control of Tibet in 1950 and suppressed a Tibetan uprising in 1959, the passes into Sikkim became a conduit for refugees from Tibet. During the 1962 <a href="Sino-Indian%20War">Sino-Indian War</a>, Nathu La witnessed skirmishes between soldiers of the two countries. Shortly thereafter, the passage was sealed and remained closed for more than four decades. Between 7 and 13 September 1967, China's <a href="People%27s%20Liberation%20Army">People's Liberation Army</a> and the <a href="Indian%20Army">Indian Army</a> had six-day <a href="Nathu%20La%20and%20Cho%20La%20incidents">"border skirmishes"</a>, including the exchange of heavy artillery fire. In 1975, Sikkim acceded to India and Nathu La became part of Indian territory. China, however, refused to acknowledge the accession at that time.
In 2003, with the thawing of <a href="Sino-Indian%20relations">Sino-Indian relations</a>, Indian Prime Minister <a href="Atal%20Bihari%20Vajpayee">Atal Bihari Vajpayee</a>'s visit to China led to the resumption of talks on opening the border. Later in 2004, the Indian Defence Minister's visit to China led to the formal opening of the pass. The opening, originally scheduled for 2 October 2005, was postponed due to last-minute infrastructure problems on the Chinese side. Finally, after a decade of talks, Nathu La was opened on 6 July 2006. The date of the reopening, which also formally recognised Tibet as part of China by India and Sikkim's accession to India, coincided with the birthday of the reigning Dalai Lama. In the years before the reopening, the only person permitted to cross the barbed-wire frontier had been a Chinese postman with an Indian military escort, who would hand over mail to his Indian counterpart in a building at the border.

The opening of the pass was marked by a ceremony on the <a href="India">India</a>n side that was attended by officials from both countries. A delegation of 100 traders from India and 100 Tibetans crossed the border to respective trading towns. Despite heavy rain and chilly winds, the ceremony was marked by the attendance of many officials, locals, and international and local media. The barbed wire fence between India and China was replaced by a 10 m (30 ft) wide stone-walled passageway. It was also decided to mark the year 2006 as the year of Sino-Indian friendship.

The pass is east of <a href="Gangtok">Gangtok</a>, the capital of Sikkim and from <a href="Lhasa">Lhasa</a>, the capital of Tibet. In the winter, the pass is blocked by heavy snowfall. Because there is no meteorological centre in Nathu La, systematic measurements of meteorological data (such as temperature and rainfall) are not available for the region. However, it is known that in the higher reaches of the Himalayas around the region, summer temperature never exceeds 15 °C (59 °F).

Nathu La has moderately shallow, excessively drained, coarse, and loamy soil on a steep slope (30–50%) with gravelly loamy surface, moderate erosion, and moderate stoniness. It has several sinking zones and parts of it are prone to <a href="landslide">landslide</a>s. To preserve the fragile environment of Nathu La on the Indian side, the <a href="government%20of%20India">government of India</a> regulates the flow of tourists. Road maintenance is entrusted to <a href="Border%20Roads%20Organisation">Border Roads Organisation</a>, a wing of the Indian Army. On the Chinese side the pass leads to the <a href="Chumbi%20Valley">Chumbi Valley</a> of the <a href="Tibetan%20Plateau">Tibetan Plateau</a>.

Because of the steep elevation increase around the pass, the vegetation graduates from <a href="sub-tropical">sub-tropical</a> forest at its base, to a temperate region, to a wet and dry <a href="alpine%20climate">alpine climate</a>, and finally to cold <a href="tundra">tundra</a> desert devoid of vegetation. Around Nathu La and the Tibetan side, the region has little vegetation besides scattered shrubs. Major species found in the region include dwarf <a href="rhododendron">rhododendron</a>s ("Rhododendron anthopogon", "R. setosum") and <a href="juniper">juniper</a>s. The meadows include the genera "<a href="Poa">Poa</a>", "<a href="Meconopsis">Meconopsis</a>", "<a href="Pedicularis">Pedicularis</a>", "<a href="Primula">Primula</a>", and "<a href="Aconitum">Aconitum</a>". The region has a four-month growing season during which grasses, <a href="sedges">sedges</a>, and <a href="medicinal%20herb">medicinal herb</a>s grow abundantly and support a host of insects, wild and domestic herbivores, larks, and finches. The nearby <a href="Kyongnosla%20Alpine%20Sanctuary">Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary</a> has rare, endangered <a href="Spathoglottis">ground orchida</a> and rhododendrons interspersed among tall junipers and <a href="silver%20fir">silver fir</a>s.

There are no permanent human settlements in the region, though it has a large number of defence personnel who man the borders on both sides. A small number of nomadic Tibetan graziers or "Dokpas" herd yak, sheep and <a href="pashmina">pashmina</a>-type goats in the region. There has been intense grazing pressure due to domestic and wild herbivores on the land. Yaks are found in these parts, and in many hamlets they serve as <a href="pack%20animal">beasts of burden</a>. The region around Nathu La contains many endangered species, including <a href="Goa%20%28antelope%29">Tibetan gazelle</a>, <a href="snow%20leopard">snow leopard</a>, <a href="Tibetan%20wolf">Tibetan wolf</a>, <a href="Tibetan%20snowcock">Tibetan snowcock</a>, <a href="lammergeier">lammergeier</a>, <a href="raven">raven</a>, <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>, and <a href="ruddy%20shelduck">ruddy shelduck</a>. <a href="Dhole">Feral dog</a>s are considered a major hazard in this region. The presence of <a href="landmine">landmine</a>s in the area causes casualties among yak, <a href="argali">nayan</a>, <a href="kiang">kiang</a>, and Tibetan wolf.

The avifauna consists of various types of <a href="Laughingthrush">laughing thrushes</a>, which live in shrubs and on the forest floor. The <a href="blue%20whistling-thrush">blue whistling-thrush</a>, <a href="redstart">redstart</a>s, and <a href="forktail">forktail</a>s are found near waterfalls and hill-streams. The mixed hunting species present in the region include <a href="warbler">warbler</a>s, <a href="Old%20World%20babbler">tit-babbler</a>s, <a href="treecreeper">treecreeper</a>s, <a href="white-eye">white-eye</a>s, <a href="wren">wren</a>s, and <a href="Rosefinch">rose finches</a>. <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">Raptors</a> such as <a href="black%20eagle">black eagle</a>, <a href="black-winged%20kite">black-winged kite</a> and <a href="kestrel">kestrel</a>s; and <a href="pheasant">pheasant</a>s such as <a href="monals">monals</a> and <a href="blood%20pheasant">blood pheasant</a> are also found.

Up until 1962, before the pass was sealed, goods such as pens, watches, cereals, cotton cloth, edible oils, soaps, building materials, and dismantled scooters and four-wheelers were exported to Tibet through the pass on mule-back. Two hundred mules, each carrying about of load, were used to ferry goods from Gangtok to Lhasa, which used to take 20–25 days. Upon return, silk, raw wool, musk pods, medicinal plants, country liquor, precious stones, gold, and silverware were imported into India. Most of the trade in those days was carried out by the <a href="Marwaris">Marwari community</a>, which owned 95% of the 200 authorised firms.

Since July 2006, trading is open Mondays through Thursdays. Exports from India exempted from duty include agricultural implements, blankets, copper products, clothes, cycles, coffee, tea, barley, rice, wheat, flour, dry fruits, vegetables, vegetable oil, tobacco, snuff, spices, shoes, kerosene oil, stationery, utensils, milk processed products, canned food, dyes, and local herbs. Chinese exports to India exempted from duty include goat skin, sheep skin, wool, raw silk, yak tail, yak hair, china clay, borax, butter, common salt, horses, goats, and sheep. Restrictions are placed on traders, with permits only given to those who were Sikkimese citizens before the kingdom merged with India in 1975.

There were fears among some traders in India that Indian goods would find a limited outlet in Tibet, while China would have access to a ready market in Sikkim and West Bengal. The reopening of the pass was expected to stimulate the economy of the region and bolster Indo-Chinese trade, but this has not happened. Figures released by the Tibet Autonomous Regional Bureau of Commerce show that in the 51 days of trading in 2006, only US$186,250 worth of trade passed through Nathu La.
On the Indian side, only citizens of India can visit the pass on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays, after obtaining permits one day in advance in Gangtok. The pass is particularly useful for pilgrims visiting monasteries in Sikkim such as <a href="Rumtek%20Monastery">Rumtek</a>, one of the holiest shrines in Buddhism. For Hindus, the pass reduces the journey time to <a href="Lake%20Manasarovar">Lake Manasarovar</a> from fifteen days to two days.

A major concern of the Indian government is the trafficking of wildlife products such as tiger and leopard skins and bones, bear gall bladders, otter pelts, and <a href="shahtoosh">shahtoosh</a> wool into India. The Indian government has undertaken a program to sensitise the police and other law enforcement agencies in the area. Most of such illicit trade currently takes place via Nepal.

On the Tibetan side two highways — from <a href="Kangmar%20County">Kangmar</a> to <a href="Yadong">Yadong</a> and from Yadong to Nathu La — were listed in the 2006 construction plans. Plans are also underway to extend the <a href="Qinghai-Tibet%20Railway">Qinghai-Tibet Railway</a> to <a href="Yadong">Yadong</a> over the next decade.

The nearest railheads are <a href="New%20Jalpaiguri">New Jalpaiguri</a> (<a href="Siliguri">Siliguri</a>) in India and <a href="Xigaz%C3%AA">Xigazê</a> in China.

The Chinese government is planning to extend its rail service to <a href="Yadong">Yadong</a>, a few kilometers (miles) from Nathu La. In addition, the Government of India is planning an extension of rail services from <a href="Sevoke">Sevoke</a> in <a href="Darjeeling%20district">Darjeeling district</a> to Sikkim's capital <a href="Gangtok">Gangtok</a>, from Nathu La.

Montague Druitt

Montague John Druitt (15 August 1857 – early December 1888) was one of the <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper%20suspects">suspects</a> in the <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a> murders that took place in London between August and November 1888.

He came from an upper-middle class English background, and studied at <a href="Winchester%20College">Winchester College</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>. After graduating, he was employed as an assistant schoolmaster at a <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a> and pursued a parallel career in the law, qualifying as a <a href="barrister">barrister</a> in 1885. His main interest outside work was <a href="cricket">cricket</a>, which he played with many leading players of the time, including <a href="George%20Harris%2C%204th%20Baron%20Harris">Lord Harris</a> and <a href="Francis%20Lacey">Francis Lacey</a>.

In November 1888, he lost his post at the school for reasons that remain unclear. One month later his body was discovered drowned in the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>. His death, which was found to be a suicide, roughly coincided with the end of the murders attributed to Jack the Ripper. Private suggestions in the 1890s that he could have committed the crimes became public knowledge in the 1960s, and led to the publication of books that proposed him as the murderer. The evidence against him was entirely <a href="Circumstantial%20evidence">circumstantial</a>, however, and many writers from the 1970s onwards have rejected him as a likely suspect.

Druitt was born in <a href="Wimborne%20Minster">Wimborne Minster</a>, <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>, <a href="England">England</a>. He was the second son and third child of prominent local surgeon William Druitt, and his wife Ann ("née" Harvey). William Druitt was a <a href="justice%20of%20the%20peace">justice of the peace</a>, a governor of <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%27s%20School%2C%20Wimborne%20Minster">the local grammar school</a>, and a regular worshipper at the local <a href="Church%20of%20England">Anglican</a> church, <a href="Wimborne%20Minster%20%28church%29">the Minster</a>. Six weeks after his birth, Montague Druitt was christened at the Minster by his maternal great-uncle, Reverend William Mayo. The Druitts lived at Westfield House, which was the largest house in the town, and set in its own grounds with stables and servants' cottages. Druitt had six brothers and sisters, including an elder brother William who entered the law, and a younger brother Edward who joined the <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a>.

Druitt was educated at Winchester College, where he won a scholarship at the age of 13, and excelled at sports, especially cricket and <a href="fives">fives</a>. He was active in the school's debating society, an interest that might have spawned his desire to become a barrister. In debates, he spoke in favour of French <a href="republicanism">republicanism</a>, compulsory military service, and the resignation of <a href="Benjamin%20Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a>, and against the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, the influence of <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a>, and the conduct of the government in the <a href="Tichborne%20case">Tichborne case</a>. He defended <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a> as "a bulwark of <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a>", and condemned the execution of King <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> as "a most dastardly murder that will always attach to England's fair name as a blot". In a light-hearted debate, he spoke against the proposition that bondage to fashion is a social evil.

In his final year at Winchester, 1875–76, he was Prefect of Chapel, treasurer of the debating society, school fives champion, and opening bowler for the cricket team. In June 1876, he played cricket for the school team against <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a>, which won the match with a team including cricketing luminaries <a href="Ivo%20Bligh%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Darnley">Ivo Bligh</a> and <a href="Kynaston%20Studd">Kynaston Studd</a>, as well as a future <a href="Principal%20Private%20Secretary">Principal Private Secretary</a> at the <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> <a href="Evelyn%20Ruggles-Brise">Evelyn Ruggles-Brise</a>. Druitt bowled out Studd for four. With a glowing academic record, he was awarded a Winchester Scholarship to <a href="New%20College%2C%20Oxford">New College, Oxford</a>.

At New College, he was popular with his peers, and was elected Steward of the Junior Common Room by them. He played cricket and <a href="rugby%20union">rugby</a> for the college team, and was the winner of both double and single fives at the university in 1877. In a seniors' cricket match in 1880, he bowled out <a href="William%20Patterson%20%28Kent%20cricketer%29">William Patterson</a>, who later captained <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent County Cricket Club</a>.

Druitt gained a second class in <a href="Classical%20Moderations">Classical Moderations</a> in 1878 and graduated with a third class Bachelor of Arts degree in "<a href="Literae%20Humaniores">Literae Humaniores</a>" (Classics) in 1880. His youngest brother, Arthur, entered New College in 1882, just as Druitt was following in his eldest brother William's footsteps by embarking on a career in law.

On 17 May 1882, two years after graduation, Druitt was admitted to the <a href="Inner%20Temple">Inner Temple</a>, one of the qualifying bodies for English <a href="barrister">barrister</a>s. His father had promised him a legacy of £500 (equivalent to £ today), and Druitt paid his membership fees with a loan from his father secured against the inheritance. He was <a href="called%20to%20the%20bar">called to the bar</a> on 29 April 1885, and set up a practice as a barrister and <a href="special%20pleader">special pleader</a>.

Druitt's father died suddenly from a heart attack in September 1885, leaving an estate valued at £16,579 (equivalent to £ today). In a <a href="Codicil%20%28will%29">codicil</a>, Druitt senior instructed his executors to deduct the money he had advanced to his son from the legacy of £500. Montague received very little money, if any, from his father's will, although he did receive some of his father's personal possessions. Most of Dr Druitt's estate went to his wife Ann, three unmarried daughters (Georgiana, Edith and Ethel), and eldest son William.

Druitt rented legal chambers at 9 King's Bench Walk in the Inner Temple. In the late <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a> only the wealthy could afford legal action, and only one in eight qualified barristers was able to make a living from the law. While some of Druitt's biographers claim his practice did not flourish, others suppose that it provided him with a relatively substantial income on the basis of his costly lease of chambers and the value of his estate at death. He is listed in the Law List of 1886 as active in the <a href="Circuit%20Court%23England%20and%20Wales">Western Circuit</a> and <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a> <a href="Quarter%20Sessions">Sessions</a>, and for 1887 in the Western Circuit and <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> and <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> <a href="Assizes%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">Assizes</a>.

To supplement his income and help pay for his legal training, Druitt worked as an assistant schoolmaster at George Valentine's <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a>, 9 Eliot Place, <a href="Blackheath%2C%20London">Blackheath, London</a>, from 1880. The school had a long and distinguished history; <a href="Benjamin%20Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> had been a pupil there in the 1810s, and boys from the school had been playmates of a younger son of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, <a href="Prince%20Arthur%2C%20Duke%20of%20Connaught">Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught</a>, who as a boy in the 1860s had lived nearby at <a href="Greenwich%20Park">Greenwich Park</a>. Druitt's post came with accommodation in Eliot Place, and the long school holidays gave him time to study the law and to pursue his interest in cricket.

In Dorset, Druitt played for the Kingston Park Cricket Club, and the <a href="Dorset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Dorset County Cricket Club</a>. He was particularly noted for his skill as a <a href="bowling%20%28cricket%29">bowler</a>. In 1882 and 1883, he toured the <a href="West%20Country">West Country</a> with a gentleman's touring team called the <a href="Incogniti">Incogniti</a>. One of Druitt's fellow local players was <a href="Francis%20Lacey">Francis Lacey</a>, the first man knighted for services to cricket. Druitt played for another wandering team, the Butterflies, on 14 June 1883, when they drew against his "alma mater" Winchester College. The team included <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a>ers <a href="A.%20J.%20Webbe">A. J. Webbe</a>, <a href="James%20Crowdy%20%28cricketer%29">J. G. Crowdy</a>, <a href="John%20Frederick%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201846%29">John Frederick</a> and <a href="Charles%20Seymour%20%28cricketer%29">Charles Seymour</a>.

While working at Blackheath, Druitt joined the local cricket club, Blackheath Morden, and became the club's treasurer. It was a well-connected club: the President was politician <a href="Charles%20Mills%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hillingdon">Sir Charles Mills</a> and one of its players was <a href="Stanley%20Christopherson">Stanley Christopherson</a>, who later became President of the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a>. After the merger of the club with other local sports associations to form the <a href="Rectory%20Field">Blackheath Cricket, Football and Lawn Tennis Company</a>, Druitt took on the additional roles of company secretary and director.

The inaugural game of the new club was played against <a href="George%20Gibbons%20Hearne">George Gibbons Hearne</a>'s Eleven, which included many members of the famous cricketing <a href="Hearne%20family">Hearne family</a>. Hearne's team won by 21 runs. On 5 June 1886, in a match between Blackheath and a gentleman's touring team called the Band of Brothers, led by <a href="George%20Harris%2C%204th%20Baron%20Harris">Lord Harris</a>, Druitt bowled Harris for 14 and took three other wickets. Blackheath won by 178 runs. Two weeks later, he dismissed England batsman <a href="John%20Shuter">John Shuter</a>, who was playing for <a href="Bexley%20Cricket%20Club">Bexley Cricket Club</a>, for a <a href="Duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a>, and Blackheath won the game by 114 runs. The following year, Shuter returned to Blackheath with a <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey County side</a> that included <a href="Walter%20Read">Walter Read</a>, <a href="William%20Lockwood%20%28cricketer%29">William Lockwood</a>, and <a href="Bobby%20Abel">Bobby Abel</a>, whom Druitt bowled out for 56. Surrey won by 147 runs.

On 26 May 1884, Druitt was elected to the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) on the recommendation of his fellow Butterflies player Charles Seymour, who proposed him, and noted fielder <a href="Vernon%20Royle">Vernon Royle</a>, who seconded his nomination. One of the minor matches he played for MCC was with England bowler <a href="William%20Attewell">William Attewell</a> against <a href="Harrow%20School">Harrow School</a> on 10 June 1886. The MCC won by 57 runs. Druitt also played against MCC for Blackheath: on 23 July 1887, he bowled out <a href="Dick%20Pougher">Dick Pougher</a> for 28 runs, but he only made 5 runs before bowled out by <a href="Arnold%20Fothergill">Arnold Fothergill</a> with a ball caught by Pougher. The MCC won by 52 runs.

In June 1888, Lord Harris played twice for Blackheath with Druitt and Stanley Christopherson; Blackheath won both matches easily, but Druitt was out of form and contributed neither runs nor wickets in either match. In August 1888, Druitt played for the Gentlemen of <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> against the <a href="Parsees%20cricket%20team">Parsees cricket team</a> during <a href="Parsee%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201888">their tour of England</a>, and took five wickets in the visitors' first innings. Nevertheless, the Parsees won. On 8 September 1888, the Blackheath Club played against the Christopherson brothers. Druitt was bowled out by Stanley Christopherson, who was playing with his brothers instead of for Blackheath, and in reply Druitt bowled out Christopherson. Blackheath won by 22 runs.

In addition to cricket, Druitt also played <a href="field%20hockey">field hockey</a>.

On Friday 30 November 1888, Druitt was dismissed from his post at the Blackheath boys' school. The reason for his dismissal is unclear. One newspaper, quoting his brother William's inquest testimony, reported that he was dismissed because he "had got into serious trouble", but did not specify any further. In early December 1888, he disappeared, and on 21 December 1888 the Blackheath Cricket Club's minute book records that he was removed as treasurer and secretary in the belief that he had "gone abroad".

On 31 December 1888, his body was found floating in the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>, off <a href="John%20I.%20Thornycroft%20%26amp%3B%20Company">Thornycroft's</a> torpedo works, <a href="Chiswick">Chiswick</a>, by a waterman named Henry Winslade. Stones in Druitt's pockets had kept his body submerged for about a month. He was in possession of a return train ticket to <a href="Hammersmith%20tube%20station%20%28Piccadilly%20and%20District%20lines%29">Hammersmith</a> dated 1 December, a silver watch, a cheque for £50 and £16 in gold (equivalent to £ and £ today). It is not known why he should have carried such a large amount of money, but it could have been a final payment from the school.

Some modern authors suggest that Druitt was dismissed because he was a homosexual or <a href="pederast">pederast</a> and that may have driven him to suicide. One speculation is that the money found on his body was going to be used for payment to a blackmailer. Others, however, think that there is no evidence of homosexuality and that his suicide was instead precipitated by a hereditary psychiatric illness. His mother suffered from depression and was institutionalised from July 1888. She died in an asylum in Chiswick in 1890. His maternal grandmother committed suicide while insane, his aunt attempted suicide, and his eldest sister committed suicide in old age. A note written by Druitt and addressed to his brother William, who was a solicitor in Bournemouth, was found in Druitt's room in Blackheath. It read, "Since Friday I felt that I was going to be like mother, and the best thing for me was to die."

As was usual in the district, the inquest was held at the Lamb Tap <a href="public%20house">public house</a>, Chiswick, by the coroner Dr Thomas Bramah Diplock, on 2 January 1889. The coroner's jury concluded that Druitt had committed suicide by drowning while in an unsound state of mind. He was buried in Wimborne cemetery the next day. At probate, his estate was valued at £2,600 (equivalent to £ today).

It is not known why Druitt committed suicide in Chiswick. One suggested link is that one of his University friends, Thomas Seymour Tuke of the <a href="Tuke%20family">Tuke family</a>, lived there. Tuke was a psychiatric doctor with whom Druitt played cricket, and Druitt's mother was committed to Tuke's asylum in 1890. Another suggestion is that Druitt knew Harry Wilson, whose house, "The Osiers", lay between Hammersmith station and Thornycroft's wharf, where Druitt's body was found.

On 31 August 1888, <a href="Mary%20Ann%20Nichols">Mary Ann Nichols</a> was found murdered in the impoverished <a href="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</a> district in the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End of London</a>, with her throat slashed. During September, three more women (<a href="Annie%20Chapman">Annie Chapman</a> on the 8th, and <a href="Elizabeth%20Stride">Elizabeth Stride</a> and <a href="Catherine%20Eddowes">Catherine Eddowes</a> on the 30th) were found dead with their throats cut. On 9 November 1888, the body of <a href="Mary%20Jane%20Kelly">Mary Jane Kelly</a> was discovered. Her throat had been severed down to the spine. In four of the cases the bodies were mutilated after death. The similarities between the crimes led to the supposition that they were committed by the same assailant, who was given the nickname "<a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a>". Despite an extensive police investigation into the five murders, the Ripper was never identified and the crimes remain unsolved.

Shortly after Kelly's murder, stories that the Ripper had drowned in the Thames began to circulate. In February 1891, the MP for <a href="West%20Dorset%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">West Dorset</a>, <a href="Henry%20Richard%20Farquharson">Henry Richard Farquharson</a>, announced that Jack the Ripper was "the son of a surgeon" who had committed suicide on the night of the last murder. Although Farquharson did not name his suspect, the description resembles Druitt. Farquharson lived from the Druitt family and was part of the same social class. The Victorian journalist <a href="George%20R.%20Sims">George R. Sims</a> noted in his memoirs, "The Mysteries of Modern London" (1906): "[the Ripper's] body was found in the Thames after it had been in the river for about a month". Similar comments were made by <a href="John%20Moylan">Sir John Moylan</a>, Assistant Under-Secretary of the Home Office: "[the Ripper] escaped justice by committing suicide at the end of 1888" and Sir <a href="Basil%20Thomson">Basil Thomson</a>, made Assistant Commissioner of the CID in 1913: "[the Ripper was] an insane Russian doctor [who] escaped arrest by committing suicide in the Thames at the end of 1888". Neither Moylan nor Thomson was involved in the Ripper investigation.
Assistant <a href="Chief%20Constable">Chief Constable</a> Sir <a href="Melville%20Macnaghten">Melville Macnaghten</a> named Druitt as a suspect in the case in a private handwritten memorandum of 23 February 1894. Macnaghten highlighted the coincidence between Druitt's disappearance and death shortly after the last of the five murders on 9 November 1888, and claimed to have unspecified "private information" that left "little doubt" Druitt's own family believed him to have been the murderer. Macnaghten's memo was eventually discovered in his personal papers by his daughter, <a href="Henry%20McLaren%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Aberconway%23Family">Lady Aberconway</a>, who showed them to British broadcaster <a href="Dan%20Farson">Dan Farson</a>. A slightly different abridged copy of the memo found in the Metropolitan Police archive was released to the public in 1966. Farson first revealed Druitt's initials "MJD" in a television programme in November 1959.

In 1961, Farson investigated a claim by an Australian that Montague's cousin, Lionel Druitt, had published a pamphlet in Australia entitled "The East End Murderer — I knew him", but the claim has never been substantiated. Journalist Tom Cullen revealed Druitt's full name in his 1965 book "Autumn of Terror", which was followed by Farson's 1972 book "Jack the Ripper". Before the discovery of Macnaghten's memo, books on the Ripper case, such as those written by <a href="Leonard%20Matters">Leonard Matters</a> and <a href="Donald%20McCormick">Donald McCormick</a>, poured scorn on stories that the Ripper had drowned in the Thames because they could not find a suicide that matched the description of the culprit. Cullen and Farson, however, supposed that Druitt was the Ripper on the basis of the Macnaghten memorandum, the near coincidence between Druitt's death and the end of the murders, the closeness of Whitechapel to Druitt's rooms in the Inner Temple, the insanity that was acknowledged by the inquest verdict of "unsound mind", and the possibility that Druitt had absorbed the rudimentary anatomical skill supposedly shown by the Ripper through observing his father at work.

Since the publication of Cullen's and Farson's books, other Ripper authors have argued that their theories are based solely on flawed circumstantial evidence, and have attempted to provide Druitt with alibis for the times of the murders. On 1 September, the day after the murder of Nichols, Druitt was in Dorset playing cricket. On the day of Chapman's murder, he played cricket in Blackheath, and the day after the murders of Stride and Eddowes, he was in the West Country defending a client in a court case. While writers Andrew Spallek and Tom Cullen argue that Druitt had the time and opportunity to travel by train between London and his cricket and legal engagements, or use his city chambers as a base from which to commit the murders, others dismiss that as "improbable". Many experts believe that the killer was local to Whitechapel, whereas Druitt lived miles away on the other side of the River Thames. His chambers were within walking distance of Whitechapel, and his regular rail journey would almost certainly have brought him to <a href="Cannon%20Street%20station">Cannon Street station</a>, a few minutes' walk from the East End. It seems unlikely, however, that he could have travelled the distance in blood-stained clothes unnoticed, and a clue discovered during the investigation into the murder of Catherine Eddowes (<a href="Goulston%20Street%20graffito">a piece of her blood-stained clothing</a>) indicates that the murderer travelled north-east from where she was murdered, whereas Druitt's chambers, and the railway station, were to the south-west.

Macnaghten incorrectly described Druitt as a 41-year-old doctor, and cited allegations that he "was sexually insane" without specifying the source or details of the allegations. Macnaghten did not join the force until 1889, after the murder of Kelly and the death of Druitt, and was not involved in the investigation directly. Macnaghten's memorandum named two other suspects (<a href="Aaron%20Kosminski">"Kosminski"</a> and <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper%20suspects%23Michael%20Ostrog">Michael Ostrog</a>) and was written to refute allegations against a fourth, <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper%20suspects%23Thomas%20Hayne%20Cutbush">Thomas Cutbush</a>. The three Macnaghten suspects — Druitt, Kosminski and Ostrog — also match the descriptions of three unnamed suspects in Major <a href="Arthur%20Griffiths%20%28author%29">Arthur Griffiths'</a> "Mysteries of Police and Crime" (1898); Griffiths was Inspector of Prisons at the time of the Ripper murders.

Inspector <a href="Frederick%20Abberline">Frederick Abberline</a>, who was the leading investigative officer in the case, appeared to dismiss Druitt as a suspect on the basis that the only evidence against him was the coincidental timing of his suicide shortly after the fifth murder. Other officials involved in the Ripper case, <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Police%20of%20the%20Metropolis">Metropolitan Police Commissioner</a> <a href="James%20Monro">James Monro</a> and pathologist <a href="Thomas%20Bond%20%28British%20physician%29">Thomas Bond</a>, believed that the murder of <a href="Alice%20McKenzie">Alice McKenzie</a> on 17 July 1889, seven months after Druitt's death, was committed by the same culprit as the earlier murders. The inclusion of McKenzie among the Ripper's victims was contested by Abberline and Macnaghten among others, but if she was one of his victims, then Druitt clearly could not be the Ripper. Another murder occasionally included among the Ripper cases is that of <a href="Martha%20Tabram">Martha Tabram</a>, who was viciously stabbed to death on 7 August 1888. Her death coincided with the middle of Bournemouth Cricket Week, 4–11 August, in which Druitt was heavily involved, and was during the school holidays which Druitt spent in Dorset. In the words of one of his biographers, "It scarcely left time for a 200-mile round dash to fit in a murder."

Druitt was a favoured suspect in the Jack the Ripper crimes throughout the 1960s, until the advent of theories in the 1970s that the murders were not the work of a single serial killer but the result of a conspiracy involving the <a href="British%20Royal%20Family">British royal family</a> and <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a>. These theories, widely condemned as ridiculous, implicate <a href="Prince%20Albert%20Victor%2C%20Duke%20of%20Clarence%20and%20Avondale">Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale</a>, his tutor <a href="James%20Kenneth%20Stephen">James Stephen</a>, and their doctor <a href="Sir%20William%20Gull%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir William Gull</a> to varying degrees. One version of the conspiracy promoted by <a href="Stephen%20Knight%20%28author%29">Stephen Knight</a> in his 1976 book "" supposed that Druitt was a scapegoat, chosen by officialdom to take the blame for the murders. Martin Howells and <a href="Keith%20Skinner">Keith Skinner</a> followed the same line in their 1987 book "The Ripper Legacy", which was panned by one critic as being based on "no evidence whatever".

The theories attempted to link Druitt with Clarence, Gull and Stephen through a network of mutual acquaintances and possible connections. <a href="Reginald%20Acland">Reginald Acland</a>, the brother of Gull's son-in-law, had legal chambers in King's Bench Walk near Druitt's, as did Harry Stephen, who was James Stephen's brother. Harry Stephen was good friends with Harry Wilson, who had a house in Chiswick, "The Osiers", near to where Druitt's body was found. Wilson and James Stephen were close friends of Clarence, and were both members of an exclusive society called the <a href="Cambridge%20Apostles">Cambridge Apostles</a>. As a schoolboy, Druitt had played cricket against two of Wilson's friends, <a href="Kynaston%20Studd">Kynaston Studd</a> and Henry Goodhart, who was also one of the Apostles. Another potential connection between Druitt and Wilson is through John Henry Lonsdale. Lonsdale's name and Blackheath address are written in a diary belonging to Wilson now in the possession of <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>. Lonsdale's address is a few yards from the school at which Druitt worked and lived, and Lonsdale had been a barrister and had also rented legal chambers in King's Bench Walk. In 1887, Lonsdale entered the church and was assigned as curate to Wimborne Minster, where the Druitt family worshiped. Lonsdale and Macnaghten were classmates at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton</a>, and so theorists argue that Lonsdale might have been in a position to provide "private information" to Macnaghten regarding Druitt. The connections between the Apostles and Druitt led to the suggestion that he was part of the same social set. Druitt, his mother, and his sister Georgiana, were invited to a ball in honour of Clarence at the home of <a href="Ivor%20Guest%2C%201st%20Baron%20Wimborne">Lord Wimborne</a> on 17 December 1888, although they did not attend because by that time Montague was dead, his mother was in an asylum, and his sister was expecting her second child. Clarence, Stephen, Wilson, Studd, and Goodhart are suggested to have been homosexual, although this is contested by historians. John Wilding's 1993 book "Jack the Ripper Revealed" used the connections between Druitt and Stephen to propose that they committed the crimes together, but reviewers considered it an "imaginative tale ... most questionable", an "exercise in ingenuity rather than ... fact", and "lack[ing] evidential support".

In his 2005 and 2006 biographies of Druitt, D. J. Leighton concluded that Druitt was innocent, but repeated some of Knight's and Wilding's discredited claims. Leighton suggested that Druitt could have been murdered, either out of greed by his elder brother William or, as previously suggested by Howells and Skinner, out of fear of exposure by Harry Wilson's homosexual cronies. The propensity of theorists to associate Ripper suspects with homosexuality has led scholars to assume that such notions are based on <a href="homophobia">homophobia</a> rather than evidence.

The accusations against Clarence, Stephen, Gull and Druitt also draw on cultural perceptions of a decadent ruling class, and depict a high-born murderer or murderers preying on lower-class victims. Because Druitt and the other upper-middle-class and aristocratic Ripper suspects were wealthy, there is more biographical material on them than on the residents of the <a href="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</a> slums. Consequently, it is easier for writers to construct solutions based on a wealthy culprit rather than one involving a Whitechapel resident. There is no direct evidence against Druitt, and since the 1970s, the number of <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper%20suspects">Jack the Ripper suspects</a> has continued to grow, with the result that there are now over 100 different theories about the Ripper's identity.

In fiction, Druitt is depicted as the murderer in the musical "Jack the Ripper" by <a href="Ron%20Pember">Ron Pember</a> and Denis de Marne. In <a href="John%20Gardner%20%28British%20writer%29">John Gardner's</a> <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> story "The Return of Moriarty", <a href="Professor%20Moriarty">Professor Moriarty</a>'s criminal exploits are hampered by increased police activity as a result of the Jack the Ripper murders. He discovers that Druitt is the murderer and so fakes his suicide in the hope that the police will lose interest once the murders cease. In <a href="Alan%20Moore">Alan Moore</a>'s graphic novel "<a href="From%20Hell">From Hell</a>", Druitt is portrayed as a patsy for the royal family, made to look guilty of the Ripper murders in order to protect the real killer, Sir William Gull.

William Henry Bury

William Henry Bury (25 May 1859 – 24 April 1889) was suspected of being the notorious <a href="serial%20killer">serial killer</a> "<a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a>". He was <a href="hanging">hanged</a> for the murder of his wife Ellen in 1889, and was the <a href="Capital%20punishment%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">last person executed</a> in <a href="Dundee">Dundee</a>, Scotland.

Bury was orphaned at an early age and was educated at a charitable school in the <a href="English%20Midlands">English Midlands</a>. After a few years in regular employment, he fell into financial difficulty, was dismissed for theft, and became a street peddler. In 1887 he moved to <a href="London">London</a>, where he married Ellen Elliot, who was probably a prostitute. During their stormy marriage, which lasted just over a year, they faced increasing financial hardship. In January 1889, they moved to Dundee. The following month, Bury <a href="strangulation%20%28domestic%20violence%29">strangled</a> his wife with a rope, stabbed her dead body with a penknife, and hid the corpse in a box in their room. A few days later, he presented himself to the local police and was arrested for her murder. Tried and convicted, he was sentenced to death by hanging. Shortly before his execution, he confessed to the crime. Although Bury's guilt was not in doubt, Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty and "<a href="The%20Courier%20%28Dundee%29">The Dundee Courier</a>" printed an editorial the day after his execution decrying the "judicial butcheries" of capital punishment.

Bury killed his wife shortly after the height of the London <a href="Whitechapel%20murders">Whitechapel murders</a>, which were attributed to the unidentified serial killer "Jack the Ripper". Bury's previous abode near <a href="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</a> and similarities between the Ripper's crimes and Bury's led the press, as well as executioner <a href="James%20Berry%20%28executioner%29">James Berry</a>, to suggest that Bury was the Ripper. Bury protested his innocence in the Ripper crimes, and the police discounted him as a suspect. Later authors have built on the earlier accusations, but the idea that Bury was the Ripper is not widely accepted.

William Bury was born in <a href="Stourbridge">Stourbridge</a>, <a href="Worcestershire%20%28historic%29">Worcestershire</a>, the youngest of four children of Henry Bury and his wife Mary Jane (née Henley). He was orphaned in infancy. His father, who worked for a local fishmonger called Joscelyne, died in a horse and cart accident in <a href="Halesowen">Halesowen</a> on 10 April 1860. While on an incline, he fell beneath the wheels of his fish cart and was killed when the horse bolted and pulled the cart over his prone body. William's mother may have been suffering from <a href="post-natal%20depression">post-natal depression</a> at the time of her husband's death and was committed to the <a href="Powick%20Hospital">Worcester County Pauper and Lunatic Asylum</a> on 7 May 1860 suffering from <a href="melancholia">melancholia</a>. She remained there until her death aged 33 on 30 March 1864.

William's eldest sibling, Elizabeth Ann, died at the age of seven during an <a href="epilepsy">epileptic fit</a> on 7 September 1859, which may have contributed to Mary Jane's depression. The other two children, Joseph Henry and Mary Jane, both died before 1889. William was raised initially in <a href="Dudley">Dudley</a> by his maternal uncle, Edward Henley, and by 1871 he was enrolled at the <a href="Old%20Swinford%20Hospital">Blue Coat charity school</a> in Stourbridge.

At the age of sixteen, he found work as a <a href="factor%20%28agent%29">factor</a>'s clerk in a warehouse at Horseley Fields, <a href="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a>, until the early 1880s when he left the warehouse after failing to repay a loan. He then worked for a lock manufacturer called Osborne in Lord Street, Wolverhampton, until he was dismissed for theft in either 1884 or 1885. For the next few years, his whereabouts are not known for certain, but he appears to have lived an unsettled life in the <a href="English%20Midlands">English Midlands</a> and <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>. In 1887, he was making a living as a <a href="peddler">hawker</a>, selling small items such as pencils and key rings on the streets of Snow Hill, <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>.

In October 1887, Bury arrived in <a href="Bow%2C%20London">Bow, London</a>, and found work selling <a href="sawdust">sawdust</a> for James Martin, who appears to have run a brothel at 80 Quickett Street, Bow. Initially, Bury lived in the stable, but later moved into the house. There, he met Ellen Elliot, who was employed by Martin as a servant and probably a prostitute.

Ellen was born on 24 October 1856 in <a href="Walworth%2C%20London">Walworth, London</a>, at the Bricklayer's Arms <a href="public%20house">public house</a> run by her father, George Elliot. In adult life, she worked as a needlewoman and in a <a href="jute">jute</a> processing factory. In 1883, she had an illegitimate daughter, also called Ellen, who died in <a href="Poplar%2C%20London">Poplar</a> <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a> in December 1885. Within a year of the death of her daughter, she began working for Martin. In March 1888, Ellen and William left Martin's employ and moved to a furnished room at 3 Swaton Road, Bow, where they lived together until their marriage on Easter Monday, 2 April 1888, at <a href="Bromley%23Landmarks">Bromley Parish Church</a>. Martin later said he had dismissed William because of unpaid debts.

Martin and the landlady at 3 Swaton Road, Elizabeth Haynes, described Bury as a violent drunk. On 7 April 1888, Haynes caught Bury kneeling on his bride of five days threatening to cut her throat with a knife. Haynes subsequently evicted them, and Ellen sold one of six £100 shares in a railway company that she had inherited from a maiden aunt, Margaret Barren, to pay William's debt to Martin. William was re-employed by Martin, and the couple moved to 11 Blackthorn Street, close to Swaton Road. According to Martin, William was then suffering from <a href="venereal%20disease">venereal disease</a>. In June, Ellen sold the remaining shares, and in August they moved to 3 Spanby Road, adjacent to where William stabled his horse. With the money from the shares, the couple had a week's holiday in Wolverhampton with a drinking friend of William's and Ellen bought new jewellery. William continued to assault his wife throughout the latter half of 1888. By the first week of December, Ellen's windfall was nearly spent, and William sold his horse and cart. In January the following year, he told his landlord at 3 Spanby Road that he was thinking of emigrating to <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, Australia, and asked him to make two wooden crates for the journey. Instead, William and Ellen moved to <a href="Dundee">Dundee</a> in Scotland. Ellen was not keen to go and only did so after William lied that he had obtained a position in a jute factory there.

The Burys travelled north as second-class passengers on the steamer "Cambria". They arrived at Dundee on the evening of 20 January 1889, and the following morning they rented a room above a bar at 43 Union Street. The Burys stayed for only eight days before they moved on 29 January to a squat at 113 Prince's Street, a basement flat under a shop. William had obtained the key under false pretences by telling the <a href="letting%20agent">letting agent</a>s that he was a viewer interested in renting the property. Meanwhile, Ellen found a job as a cleaner at a local mill, but she quit after a day. William continued to drink heavily, often with a decorator called David Walker, who was re-painting the public house frequented by William.

On Monday 4 February, William bought some rope at the local grocer's shop, and spent the rest of the day observing cases at the <a href="Sheriff%20Court">Sheriff Court</a> from the public gallery. He was later reported to have listened attentively to the proceedings. On 7 February, he attended the court sessions again. On 10 February, he visited his acquaintance, Walker, who lent him a newspaper that featured a woman's suicide by hanging. Walker asked Bury to look up any news of <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a>, at which Bury threw down the newspaper with a fright. That evening, he walked into the Dundee Central Police Station on Bell Street and reported his wife's suicide to Lieutenant James Parr. He said they had been drinking heavily the night before her death, and he had woken in the morning to find his wife's body on the floor with a rope around her neck. Bury had not summoned a doctor, but had instead cut the body and concealed it in one of the packing cases brought from London. Bury told Parr that his actions were now preying on his mind, and he was afraid that he would be arrested and accused of being Jack the Ripper.

Parr took Bury upstairs to see Lieutenant David Lamb, the head of the detective department. Parr told Lamb, "This man has a wonderful story to tell you." Bury retold his story to Lamb, but omitted the reference to Jack the Ripper, and added that he had stabbed his wife's body once. Bury was searched, and a small knife, bankbook and his house key were confiscated pending inquiries. Lamb and Detective Constable Peter Campbell proceeded to the Burys' dingy flat, where they discovered the mutilated remains of Ellen stuffed into the wooden box Bury had commissioned in London.

Lamb returned to the police station and charged William with Ellen's murder. Ellen's jewellery, found in William's pockets, was confiscated. A preliminary search of the premises revealed chalk graffiti on the rear door of the flat, which read "Jack Ripper is at the back of this door", and on the stairwell leading up from the rear of the property, which read "Jack Ripper is in this seller ". The press and the police thought they had been written by a local boy before the tragedy, but the writer was never identified. A more extensive search the following morning found blood-stained clothing in the crate that had contained the body, and the remains of more clothing and some of Ellen's personal effects burned in the fireplace. The flat was bereft of furniture, indicating that it may have been burnt on the fire, either for heat or to destroy evidence. A large penknife was found with human flesh and blood upon it, and the rope that William had bought on the morning of 4 February was found with strands of Ellen's hair caught in the fibres.

Ellen's body was examined by five physicians: police surgeon Charles Templeman, his colleague Alexander Stalker, Edinburgh surgeon <a href="Henry%20Littlejohn%20%28surgeon%20born%201826%29">Henry Littlejohn</a> and two local doctors, David Lennox and William Kinnear. They concluded that Ellen had been strangled from behind. Her right leg was broken in two places so it could be crammed into the crate. Incisions, made by the penknife, ran downwards along her abdomen and had been made "within at most ten minutes of the time of death" according to Templeman, Stalker and Littlejohn. Lennox disagreed and thought the wounds were made later on the basis that when he examined the body the wound was not everted, but Templeman and Stalker said the wound was everted when they examined the body. Littlejohn explained that as Lennox made his examination three days after the others, the shape of the wounds could have changed, to which Lennox agreed.

Chief Constable Dewar sent a telegraph detailing the circumstances of the crime to the London <a href="Metropolitan%20Police">Metropolitan Police</a>, which was investigating the crimes attributed to Jack the Ripper. Detectives from London did not consider Bury a realistic suspect in their investigation into the Ripper murders, but Inspector <a href="Frederick%20Abberline">Frederick Abberline</a> did interview witnesses in Whitechapel connected to Bury, including William's former employer James Martin and landlords Elizabeth Haynes and William Smith. According to the executioner <a href="James%20Berry%20%28executioner%29">James Berry</a> and crime reporter Norman Hastings, <a href="Scotland%20Yard">Scotland Yard</a> sent two detectives to interview Bury, but there is no surviving record of the visit in the police archive.

On 18 March 1889, Bury was arraigned for the murder of his wife; he entered a plea of not guilty. The trial was seen before <a href="George%20Young%2C%20Lord%20Young">Lord Young</a> in the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justiciary">High Court of Justiciary</a> on 28 March. Bury's defence team comprised <a href="solicitor">solicitor</a> David Tweedie and <a href="advocate">advocate</a> William Hay; the prosecution was led by <a href="Faculty%20of%20Advocates">advocate depute</a> Dugald or Dill McKechnie. The hearing lasted 13 hours. The prosecution witnesses included Ellen's sister Margaret Corney, William's former employer James Martin, the Burys' London landlady Elizabeth Haynes, William's drinking partner David Walker, Lieutenant Lamb and Drs Templeman and Littlejohn. After a break for supper, Hay presented the defence case, which was heavily dependent on Dr Lennox's testimony that Ellen had strangled herself. At 10:05 p.m., Lord Young finished his summation, and the jury of 15 men retired to consider their verdict. After 25 minutes, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty with a <a href="Pardon%23United%20Kingdom">recommendation for mercy</a>. Lord Young asked the jury why they recommended mercy, and one of them replied that the medical evidence was contradictory, referring to Lennox's testimony. Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty, and the jury may have been trying to avoid passing a death sentence. Young told the jury to retire and reconsider their verdict until they were decided by the evidence one way or another. At 10:40 p.m., they returned with a unanimous verdict of guilty. Lord Young passed the mandatory sentence for murder: death by <a href="hanging">hanging</a>.

On 1 April, Bury's solicitor, David Tweedie, petitioned the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Scotland">Secretary of State for Scotland</a>, <a href="Schomberg%20Kerr%2C%209th%20Marquess%20of%20Lothian">Lord Lothian</a>, for clemency. Tweedie argued that the sentence should be <a href="commutation%20%28law%29">commuted</a> to life imprisonment on the grounds of the conflicting medical evidence and the jury's initial reservations. Tweedie further argued that Bury could have inherited insanity from his mother, who had died in a lunatic asylum. A clergyman whom Bury had befriended, Edward John Gough, minister of <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Dundee">St Paul's Episcopalian Church in Dundee</a>, also wrote to Lothian asking for a reprieve. The Secretary of State refused to intervene in the normal course of the law, and Bury was hanged on 24 April by executioner James Berry. The following day, "<a href="The%20Courier%20%28Dundee%29">The Dundee Courier</a>" printed an editorial lambasting capital punishment:

It was the last execution held in Dundee.

A few days before the execution, Bury confessed to Reverend Gough that he had killed Ellen. At the urging of Gough, William wrote a confession on 22 April 1889, which he asked to be withheld until after he was dead. William claimed that he had strangled Ellen without premeditation on the night of 4 February 1889 during a drunken row over money, and that he had tried to dismember the body for disposal the next day but was too squeamish to continue. The latter part of this confession does not match the expert testimony of the physicians, who said that the incisions were made "within at most ten minutes of the time of death" rather than the next day. William stated he had stuffed Ellen's body into the crate as part of a later plan for disposal, but instead concocted the suicide story when he realised that Ellen's absence would be noted.

Traditionally, five murders (known as the "canonical five") are attributed to the notorious serial killer "Jack the Ripper", who terrorised <a href="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</a> in the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End of London</a> between August and November 1888. Authorities are not agreed on the exact number of the Ripper's victims, and at least eleven <a href="Whitechapel%20murders">Whitechapel murders</a> between April 1888 and February 1891 were included in the same extensive police investigation. All the crimes remain unsolved.

Claims that Bury could have been the Ripper began to appear in newspapers shortly after Bury's arrest. Like Bury, the Ripper had inflicted abdominal wounds on his victims immediately after their deaths, and Bury lived in Bow, near Whitechapel, from October 1887 to January 1889, which placed him fairly near the Whitechapel murders at the appropriate time. The "Dundee Advertiser" of 12 February claimed that the Burys' "neighbours were startled and alarmed at the idea that one whom in their terror they associated with the Whitechapel tragedies had been living in their midst." "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" of the same day connected Bury directly to the atrocities and reported the theory that William had murdered Ellen to prevent her from revealing his guilt, a story picked up and repeated by "The Dundee Courier" the following day. "The Courier" alleged that Bury admitted to Lieutenant Parr that he was Jack the Ripper, but Parr's version of the story says only that Bury said he was afraid he would be arrested as Jack the Ripper. Bury denied any connection, despite making a full confession to his wife's murder. Nevertheless, the executioner James Berry promoted the idea that Bury was the Ripper. Berry did not include Bury or the Ripper in his memoirs, "My Experiences as an Executioner", but Ernest A. Parr, a journalist in the Suffolk town of <a href="Newmarket%2C%20Suffolk">Newmarket</a>, wrote to the Secretary of State for Scotland on 28 March 1908 that Berry "told me explicitly that Bury was known to have been Jack the Ripper".

In the 1920s, Norman Hastings built on Berry's hypothesis proposing Bury as the Ripper, and 100 years after the Ripper murders William Beadle and Dundee librarian Euan Macpherson published books and articles popularising Bury as a Ripper suspect. They highlighted that the canonical five Whitechapel murders ended in November 1888, which roughly coincided with Bury's departure from Whitechapel. There was graffiti at Bury's Dundee flat that implied that Jack the Ripper lived there, and Macpherson supposed this was written by Bury as a form of confession. William took Ellen's rings, and the Ripper is believed to have taken rings from victim <a href="Annie%20Chapman">Annie Chapman</a>. Bury was persistently violent to his wife, threatened her with a knife, and cut open her abdomen after death in a manner not dissimilar to the Whitechapel murderer. In a conversation with her neighbours, Marjory Smith, who ran the shop above the Burys' Prince's Street flat in Dundee, asked them "What sort of work was this you Whitechapel folk have been about, letting Jack the Ripper kill so many people?" Bury did not answer her, but Ellen replied "Jack the Ripper is quiet now." She reportedly told another neighbour, "Jack the Ripper is taking a rest." Beadle and Macpherson argued that Ellen's comments might indicate that she had knowledge of the Ripper's whereabouts.

Others contend that Bury only imitated the Ripper, citing differences between their crimes. Ellen Bury was strangled with a rope and sustained comparatively few knife wounds compared to the Ripper's victims, whose throats were cut prior to sustaining deep abdominal slashes. Ellen Bury's throat was not cut, and only relatively shallow cuts were made to her abdomen. The identity of the Whitechapel murderer is unknown, and over <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper%20suspects">one hundred suspects</a>, in addition to Bury, have been proposed. While some Ripper writers consider Bury a more likely culprit than many of the other suspects, other writers dismiss the theory because, "as happens all too frequently in this field, the theorizing appears to have a few disturbing leaps of logic as well as mere anecdotes used as evidence."

La Peau de chagrin

La Peau de chagrin (, "The Skin of Sorrow" or "The Wild Ass's Skin") is an <a href="1831%20in%20literature">1831</a> <a href="novel">novel</a> by <a href="French%20people">French</a> novelist and playwright <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20de%20Balzac">Honoré de Balzac</a> (1799–1850). Set in early 19th-century <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, it tells the story of a young man who finds a magic piece of <a href="shagreen">shagreen</a> that fulfills his every desire. For each wish granted, however, the skin shrinks and consumes a portion of his physical energy. "La Peau de chagrin" belongs to the "Études philosophiques" group of Balzac's <a href="novel%20sequence">sequence of novels</a>, "<a href="La%20Com%C3%A9die%20humaine">La Comédie humaine</a>".

Before the book was completed, Balzac created excitement about it by publishing a series of articles and story fragments in several Parisian journals. Although he was five months late in delivering the manuscript, he succeeded in generating sufficient interest that the novel sold out instantly upon its publication. A second edition, which included a series of twelve other "philosophical tales", was released one month later.

Although the novel uses <a href="fantastic">fantastic</a> elements, its main focus is a <a href="realism%20%28arts%29">realistic</a> portrayal of the excesses of <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeois</a> <a href="economic%20materialism">materialism</a>. Balzac's renowned attention to detail is used to describe a gambling house, an antique shop, a royal banquet, and other locales. He also includes details from his own life as a struggling writer, placing the main character in a home similar to the one he occupied at the start of his literary career. The central theme of "La Peau de chagrin" is the conflict between desire and longevity. The magic skin represents the owner's life-force, which is depleted through every expression of will, especially when it is employed for the acquisition of power. Ignoring a caution from the shopkeeper who offers him the skin, the protagonist greedily surrounds himself with wealth, only to find himself miserable and decrepit at the story's end.

"La Peau de chagrin" firmly established Balzac as a writer of significance in France. His social circle widened significantly, and he was sought eagerly by publishers for future projects. The book served as the catalyst for a series of letters he exchanged with a Polish baroness named <a href="Ewelina%20Ha%C5%84ska">Ewelina Hańska</a>, who later became his wife. It also inspired <a href="Giselher%20Klebe">Giselher Klebe</a>'s opera "<a href="Die%20t%C3%B6dlichen%20W%C3%BCnsche">Die tödlichen Wünsche</a>".

In 1830 <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20de%20Balzac">Honoré de Balzac</a> had only begun to achieve recognition as a writer. Although his parents had persuaded him to make his profession the law, he announced in 1819 that he wanted to become an author. His mother was distraught, but she and his father agreed to give him a small income, on the condition that he dedicate himself to writing, and deliver to them half of his gross income from any published work. After moving into a tiny room near the <a href="Biblioth%C3%A8que%20de%20l%27Arsenal">Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal</a> in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, Balzac wrote for one year, without success. Frustrated, he moved back to his family in the suburb of <a href="Villeparisis">Villeparisis</a> and borrowed money from his parents to pursue his literary ambitions further. He spent the next several years writing simple <a href="potboiler">potboiler</a> novels, which he published under a variety of <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a>s. He shared some of his income from these with his parents, but by 1828 he still owed them 50,000 <a href="franc">franc</a>s.

He published for the first time under his own name in 1829. "<a href="Les%20Chouans">Les Chouans</a>", a novel about royalist forces in <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>, did not succeed commercially, but it made Balzac known in literary circles. He achieved a major success later the same year when he published "<a href="La%20Physiologie%20du%20mariage">La Physiologie du mariage</a>", a treatise on the institution of marriage. Bolstered by its popularity, he added to his fame by publishing a variety of short stories and essays in the magazines "<a href="Revue%20de%20Paris">Revue de Paris</a>", "<a href="La%20Caricature%20%281830%E2%80%931843%29">La Caricature</a>", and "La Mode". He thus made connections in the publishing industry that later helped him to obtain reviews of his novels.

At the time, French literary appetites for <a href="fantastic">fantastic</a> stories had been whetted by the 1829 translation of German writer <a href="E.%20T.%20A.%20Hoffmann">E. T. A. Hoffmann</a>'s collection "Fantastic Tales"; the <a href="gothic%20fiction">gothic fiction</a> of England's <a href="Ann%20Radcliffe">Ann Radcliffe</a>; and French author <a href="Jules%20Janin">Jules Janin</a>'s 1829 novel "L'Âne Mort et la Femme Guillotinée" ("The Dead Donkey and the Guillotined Woman"). Although he planned a novel in the same tradition, Balzac disliked the term "fantastic", referring to it once as "the vulgar program of a genre in its first flush of newness, to be sure, but already too much worn by the mere abuse of the word".

The politics and culture of France, meanwhile, were in upheaval. After reigning for six controversial years, King <a href="Charles%20X%20of%20France">Charles X</a> was forced to abdicate during the <a href="July%20Revolution">July Revolution</a> of 1830. He was replaced by <a href="Louis-Philippe%20of%20France">Louis-Philippe</a>, who named himself "King of the French" (rather than the usual "King of France") in an attempt to distance himself from the "<a href="Ancien%20R%C3%A9gime">Ancien Régime</a>". The July Monarchy brought an entrenchment of <a href="bourgeois">bourgeois</a> attitudes, in which Balzac saw disorganization and weak leadership.

The title "La Peau de chagrin" first appeared in print on 9 December 1830, as a passing mention in an article Balzac wrote for "La Caricature" under the pseudonym Alfred Coudreux. His scrapbook includes the following note, probably written at the same time: "L'invention d'une peau qui représente la vie. Conte oriental." ("The invention of a skin that represents life. <a href="Orient">Orient</a>al story.") One week later, he published a story fragment called "Le Dernier Napoléon" in "La Caricature", under the name "Henri B...". In it, a young man loses his last <a href="Napoleon%20%28coin%29">Napoleon</a> coin at a Parisian gambling house, then continues to the <a href="Pont%20Royal">Pont Royal</a> to drown himself. During this early stage, Balzac did not think much of the project. He referred to it as "a piece of thorough nonsense in the literary sense, but in which [the author] has sought to introduce certain of the situations in this hard life through which men of genius have passed before achieving anything". Before long, though, his opinion of the story improved.

By January 1831 Balzac had generated enough interest in his idea to secure a contract with publishers Charles Gosselin and Urbain Canel. They agreed on 750 copies of an <a href="Octavo%20%28book%29">octavo</a> edition, with a fee of 1,125 <a href="French%20franc">francs</a> paid to the author upon receipt of the manuscript – by mid-February. Balzac delivered the novel in July.

During the intervening months, however, he provided glimpses of his erratic progress. Two additional fragments appeared in May, part of a scheme to promote the book before its publication. "Une Débauche", published in the "Revue des deux mondes", describes an orgiastic feast that features constant bantering and discussion from its bourgeois participants. The other fragment, "Le Suicide d'un poète", was printed in the "Revue de Paris"; it concerns the difficulties of a would-be poet as he tries to compensate for his lack of funds. Although the three fragments were not connected into a coherent narrative, Balzac was excerpting characters and scenes from his novel-in-progress.

The novel's delayed publication was a result of Balzac's active social life. He spent many nights dining at the homes of friends, including novelist <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Sue">Eugène Sue</a> and his mistress <a href="Olympe%20P%C3%A9lissier">Olympe Pélissier</a>, as well as the <a href="feminism">feminist</a> writer <a href="George%20Sand">George Sand</a> and her lover <a href="Jules%20Sandeau">Jules Sandeau</a>. Balzac and Pélissier had a brief affair, and she became the first lover with whom he appeared in public. Eventually he removed himself from Paris by staying with friends in the suburbs, where he committed himself to finishing the work. In late spring he allowed Sand to read a nearly-finished manuscript; she enjoyed it and predicted it would do well.

Finally, in August 1831, "La Peau de chagrin: Conte philosophique" was published in two volumes. It was a commercial success, and Balzac used his connections in the world of Parisian periodicals to have it reviewed widely. The book sold quickly, and by the end of the month another contract had been signed: Balzac would receive 4,000 francs to publish 1,200 additional copies. This second edition included a series of twelve other stories with fantastic elements, and was released under the title "Romans et contes philosophiques" ("Philosophical Novels and Stories"). A third edition, rearranged to fill four volumes, appeared in March 1833.

"La Peau de chagrin" consists of three sections: "Le Talisman" ("The Talisman"), "La Femme sans cœur" ("The Woman without a Heart"), and "L'Agonie" ("The Agony"). The first edition contained a Preface and a "Moralité", which were excised from subsequent versions. A two-page Epilogue appears at the end of the final section.

"Le Talisman" begins with the plot of "Le Dernier Napoléon": A young man named Raphaël de Valentin wagers his last coin and loses, then proceeds to the river <a href="Seine">Seine</a> to drown himself. On the way, however, he decides to enter an unusual shop and finds it filled with curiosities from around the world. The elderly shopkeeper leads him to a piece of <a href="shagreen">shagreen</a> hanging on the wall. It is inscribed with "Oriental" writing; the old man calls it "<a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>", but it is imprecise <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>. The skin promises to fulfill any wish of its owner, shrinking slightly upon the fulfillment of each desire. The shopkeeper is willing to let Valentin take it without charge, but urges him not to accept the offer. Valentin waves away the shopkeeper's warnings and takes the skin, wishing for a royal <a href="banquet">banquet</a>, filled with wine, women, and friends. He is immediately met by acquaintances who invite him to such an event; they spend hours eating, drinking, and talking.

Part two, "La Femme sans cœur", is narrated as a <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashback</a> from Valentin's point of view. He complains to his friend Émile about his early days as a scholar, living in poverty with an elderly landlord and her daughter Pauline, while trying fruitlessly to win the heart of a beautiful but aloof woman named Foedora. Along the way he is tutored by an older man named <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20de%20Rastignac">Eugène de Rastignac</a>, who encourages him to immerse himself in the world of high society. Benefiting from the kindness of his landladies, Valentin maneuvers his way into Foedora's circle of friends. Unable to win her affection, however, he becomes the miserable and destitute man found at the start of "Le Talisman".

"L'Agonie" begins several years after the feast of parts one and two. Valentin, having used the talisman to secure a large income, finds both the skin and his health dwindling. He tries to break the curse by getting rid of the skin, but fails. The situation causes him to panic, horrified that further desires will hasten the end of his life. He organizes his home to avoid the possibility of wishing for anything: his servant, Jonathan, arranges food, clothing, and visitors with precise regularity. Events beyond his control cause him to wish for various things, however, and the skin continues to recede. Desperate, the sickly Valentin tries to find some way of stretching the skin, and takes a trip to the <a href="spa%20town">spa town</a> of <a href="Aix-les-Bains">Aix-les-Bains</a> in the hope of recovering his vitality.

With the skin no larger than a <a href="Vinca">periwinkle</a> leaf, he is visited by Pauline in his room; she expresses her love for him. When she learns the truth about the shagreen and her role in Raphaël's demise, she is horrified. Raphaël cannot control his desire for her and she rushes into an adjoining room to escape him and so save his life. He pounds on the door and declares both his love and his desire to die in her arms. She, meanwhile, is trying to kill herself to free him from his desire. He breaks down the door, they consummate their love in a fiery moment of passion, and he dies.

Although he preferred the term "philosophical", Balzac's novel is based upon a <a href="fantastic">fantastic</a> premise. The skin grants a world of possibility to Valentin, and he uses it to satisfy many desires. Pressured into a <a href="duel">duel</a>, for example, he explains how he need neither avoid his opponent's gunshot nor aim his own weapon; the outcome is inevitable. He fires without care, and kills the other man instantly. Elsewhere, the <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a> qualities of the skin are demonstrated when it resists the efforts of a <a href="chemist">chemist</a> and a <a href="physicist">physicist</a> to stretch it.

This inclusion of the fantastic, however, is mostly a framework by which the author discusses <a href="human%20nature">human nature</a> and <a href="society">society</a>. One critic suggests that "the story would be much the same without it". Balzac had used supernatural elements in the potboiler novels he published under "<a href="pen%20name">noms de plume</a>", but their presence in "Peau de chagrin" signaled a turning point in his approach to the use of <a href="symbol">symbol</a>ism. Whereas he had used fantastic objects and events in earlier works, they were mostly simple plot points or uncomplicated devices for suspense. With "La Peau de chagrin", on the other hand, the talisman represents Valentin's soul; at the same time, his demise is symbolic of a greater social decline. Balzac's real foci in the 1831 novel are the power of human desire and the nature of society after the July Revolution. French writer and critic <a href="F%C3%A9licien%20Marceau">Félicien Marceau</a> even suggests that the symbolism in the novel allows a purer analysis than the individual <a href="case%20study">case studies</a> of other Balzac novels; by removing the analysis to an abstract level, it becomes less complicated by variations of individual personality. As an <a href="everyman">everyman</a>, Valentin displays the essential characteristics of human nature, not a particular person's approach to the dilemma offered by the skin.

In his Preface to the novel's first edition, Balzac meditates on the usefulness of fantastic elements: "[Writers] invent the true, by analogy, or they "see" the object to be described, whether the object comes to them or they go toward the object ... Have men the power to bring the universe into their brain, or is their brain a talisman with which they abolish the laws of time and space?" Critics agree that Balzac's goal in "La Peau de chagrin" was the former.

The novel is widely cited as an important early example of the <a href="realism%20%28arts%29">realism</a> for which Balzac became famous. Descriptions of Paris are one example: the novel is filled with actual locations, including the <a href="Palais%20Royal">Palais Royal</a> and the <a href="Notre%20Dame%20de%20Paris">Notre Dame Cathedral</a>. The narration and characters <a href="allusion">allude</a> repeatedly to art and culture, from <a href="Gioachino%20Rossini">Gioachino Rossini</a>'s opera "<a href="Tancredi">Tancredi</a>" to the statue of <a href="Venus%20de%20Milo">Venus de Milo</a>.

The book's third paragraph contains a long description of the process and purpose behind the ritual in <a href="gambling">gambling</a> houses whereby "the law despoils you of your hat at the outset." The atmosphere of the establishment is described in precise detail, from the faces of the players to the "greasy" wallpaper and the tablecloth "worn by the friction of gold". The emphasis on money evoked in the first pages – and its contrast with the decrepit surroundings – mirrors the novel's themes of social organization and <a href="economic%20materialism">economic materialism</a>.

The confluence of realist detail with symbolic meaning continues when Valentin enters the <a href="antique">antique</a> shop; the store represents the planet itself. As he wanders about, he tours the world through the relics of its various epochs: "Every land of earth seemed to have contributed some stray fragment of its learning, some example of its art." The shop contains a painting of <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>; a <a href="Moors">Moorish</a> <a href="yataghan">yataghan</a>; an idol of the <a href="Tartars">Tartars</a>; portraits of <a href="Dutch%20%28ethnic%20group%29">Dutch</a> <a href="burgomaster">burgomaster</a>s; a bust of <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a>; an <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>ian <a href="mummy">mummy</a>; an <a href="Etruscan%20civilization">Etruscan</a> vase; a <a href="Chinese%20dragon">Chinese dragon</a>; and hundreds of other objects. The panorama of human activity reaches a moral <a href="wikt%3Afork%20in%20the%20road">fork in the road</a> when the shopkeeper leads Valentin to <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>'s portrait of <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus Christ</a>. It does not deter him from his goal, however; only when he finds the skin does Valentin decide to abort his suicidal mission. In doing so, he demonstrates humanity favoring <a href="Id%2C%20ego%20and%20super-ego%23Ego">ego</a> over divine salvation.

At the start of the novel, Balzac includes an image from <a href="Laurence%20Sterne">Laurence Sterne</a>'s 1759 novel "<a href="The%20Life%20and%20Opinions%20of%20Tristram%20Shandy%2C%20Gentleman">Tristram Shandy</a>": a curvy line drawn in the air by a character seeking to express the freedom enjoyed "whilst a man is free". Balzac never explained his purpose behind the use of the symbol, and its significance to "La Peau de chagrin" is the subject of debate. In his comprehensive review of "La Comédie humaine", Herbert J. Hunt connects the "serpentine squiggle" to the "sinuous design" of Balzac's novel. Critic Martin Kanes, however, suggests that the image symbolizes the impossibility of language to express an idea fully. This dilemma, he proposes, is directly related to the conflict between will and knowledge indicated by the shopkeeper at the start of the novel.

Balzac mined his own life for details in the first parts of "La Peau de Chagrin", and he likely modeled the protagonist Raphaël de Valentin on himself. Details recounted by Valentin of his impoverished living quarters are <a href="autobiography">autobiographical</a> allusions to Balzac's earliest days as an author: "Nothing could be uglier than this garret, awaiting its scholar, with its dingy yellow walls and odor of poverty. The roofing fell in a steep slope, and the sky was visible through chinks in the tiles. There was room for a bed, a table, and a few chairs, and beneath the highest point of the roof my piano could stand." Although they allow for a degree of embellishment, biographers and critics agree that Balzac was drawing from his own experience.

Other parts of the story also derive from the author's life: Balzac once attended a feast held by the Marquis de Las Marismas, who planned to launch a newspaper – the same situation in which Valentin finds himself after expressing his first wish to the talisman. Later, Valentin visits the opera armed with a powerful set of <a href="opera%20glasses">glasses</a> that allow him to observe every flaw in the women on stage (to guard against desire). These may also have been drawn from Balzac's experience, as he once wrote in a letter about a set of "divine" opera glasses he ordered from the <a href="Paris%20Observatory">Paris Observatory</a>.

More significant is the connection between the women in the novel and the women in Balzac's life. Some critics have noted important similarities between Valentin's efforts to win the heart of Foedora and Balzac's infatuation with <a href="Olympe%20P%C3%A9lissier">Olympe Pélissier</a>. A scene in which Valentin hides in Foedora's bedroom to watch her undress is said to come from a similar situation wherein Balzac secretly observed Pélissier. It's probable that Pélissier was not the model for Foedora, however, since she accepted Balzac's advances and wrote him friendly letters; Foedora, by contrast, declares herself outside the reach of any interested lover. Critics agree that the "Woman without a Heart" described in the novel is a composite of other women Balzac knew. The character of Pauline, meanwhile, was likely influenced by another of Balzac's mistresses, Laure de Berny.

At the start of the book, the shopkeeper discusses with Valentin "the great secret of human life". They consist of three words, which Balzac renders in capital letters: VOULOIR ("to will"), POUVOIR ("to be able"), and SAVOIR ("to know"). Will, he explains, consumes us; power (or, in one translation, "to have your will") destroys us; and knowledge soothes us. These three concepts form the philosophical foundation of the novel.

The talisman connects these precepts to the theory of <a href="vitalism">vitalism</a>; it physically represents the life force of its owner, and is reduced with each exercise of the will. The shopkeeper tries to warn Valentin that the wisest path lies not in exercising his will or securing power, but in developing the mind. "What is folly", he asks Valentin, "if not an excess of will and power?" Overcome with the possibilities offered by the skin, however, the young man throws caution to the wind and embraces his desire. Upon grabbing the talisman, he declares: "I want to live with excess." Only when his life force is nearly depleted does he recognize his mistake: "It suddenly struck him that the possession of power, no matter how enormous, did not bring with it the knowledge of how to use it ... [he] had had everything in his power, and he had done nothing."

The will, Balzac cautions, is a destructive force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a <a href="foil%20%28literature%29">foil</a> for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development as an alternative to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret – lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him – underscores the irony of his misery at the end of the book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.

The novel extrapolates Balzac's analysis of desire from the individual to society; he feared that the world, like Valentin, was losing its way due to material excess and misguided priorities. In the gambling house, the orgiastic feast, the antique shop, and the discussions with men of science, Balzac examines this dilemma in various contexts. The lust for social status to which Valentin is led by Rastignac is emblematic of this excess; the gorgeous but unattainable Foedora symbolizes the pleasures offered by high society.

Science offers no <a href="Panacea%20%28medicine%29">panacea</a>. In one scene, a group of doctors offer a range of quickly formulated opinions as to the cause of Valentin's feebleness. In another, a physicist and a chemist admit defeat after employing a range of tactics designed to stretch the skin. All of these scientific approaches lack an understanding of the true crisis, and are therefore doomed to fail. Although it is only shown in glimpses – the image of Christ, for example, painted by Valentin's <a href="namesake">namesake</a>, the Renaissance artist <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a> – Balzac wished to remind readers that <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> offered the potential to temper deadly excess. After failing in their efforts to stretch the skin, the chemist declares: "I believe in the devil"; "And I in God", replies the physicist.

The corruption of excess is related to social disorganization in a description at the start of the final section. Physically feeble though living in absolute luxury, Raphaël de Valentin is described as retaining in his eyes "an extraordinary intelligence" with which he is able to see "everything at once":That expression was painful to see ... It was the inscrutable glance of helplessness that must perforce consign its desires to the depths of its own heart; or of a miser enjoying in imagination all the pleasures that his money could procure for him, while he declines to lessen his hoard; the look of a bound Prometheus, of the fallen Napoleon of 1815, when he learned at the Elysee the strategical blunder that his enemies had made, and asked for twenty-four hours of command in vain ...

The novel sold out immediately after going on sale, and was reviewed in every major Parisian newspaper and magazine. In some cases Balzac wrote the reviews himself; using the name "Comte Alex de B—", he announced that the book proved he had achieved "the stature of genius". Independent reviews were less sweeping, but also very positive. Poet <a href="%C3%89mile%20Deschamps">Émile Deschamps</a> praised the rhythm of the novel, and the religious commentator <a href="Charles%20Forbes%20Ren%C3%A9%20de%20Montalembert">Charles Forbes René de Montalembert</a> indicated approvingly that it highlighted the need for more spirituality in society as a whole. Although some critics chastised Balzac for reveling in negativity, others felt it simply reflected the condition of French society. German writer <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a> declared it a shining example of the "incurable corruption of the French nation". Critics argue about whether Goethe's comments were praise for the novel or not.

This storm of publicity caused a flurry of activity as readers around France scrambled to obtain the novel. Balzac's friend and "La Caricature" editor <a href="Charles%20Philipon">Charles Philipon</a> wrote to the author one week after publication: "there is no getting hold of "La Peau de chagrin". <a href="Jean%20Ignace%20Isidore%20G%C3%A9rard">Grandville</a> had to stop everything to read it, because the librarian sent round every half-hour to ask if he had finished." Friends near and far wrote to Balzac indicating their similar difficulties in locating copies. The second edition was released one month later, and it was followed by parodies and derivative works from other writers. Balzac's friend <a href="Th%C3%A9ophile%20Gautier">Théophile Gautier</a> included a comical homage in his 1833 story collection "Les Jeunes-France" when, during a recreation of the feast from Balzac's novel, a character says: "This is the point at which I'm supposed to pour wine down my waistcoat ... It says so in black and white on page 171 of "La Peau de chagrin" ... And this is where I have to toss a 100-<a href="Sou%20%28coin%29">sou</a> coin in the air to see whether or not there's a God."

The novel established Balzac as a prominent figure in the world of French literature. Publishers fought among themselves to publish his future work, and he became a mainstay on the list of invitation for social functions around Paris. Balzac took pride in his novel's success, and declared to the editor of the journal "L'Avenir" that "Elle est donc le "point de départ" de mon ouvrage" ("This is the "point of departure" for my body of work"). Consistently popular even after his death, "La Peau de chagrin" was republished nineteen times between 1850 and 1880.

When he developed his scheme for organizing all of his novels and stories into a single <a href="novel%20sequence">sequence</a> called "<a href="La%20Com%C3%A9die%20humaine">La Comédie humaine</a>", Balzac placed "La Peau de chagrin" at the start of the section called "Études philosophiques" ("Philosophical Studies"). Like the other works in this category – including the similarly autobiographical "<a href="Louis%20Lambert%20%28novel%29">Louis Lambert</a>" (1832) – it deals with philosophy and the supernatural. But it also provides a bridge to the realism of the "Études des mœurs" ("Study of Manners"), where the majority of his novels were located.

The popularity of the novel extended to <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, where a <a href="baron">baron</a>ess named <a href="Ewelina%20Ha%C5%84ska">Ewelina Hańska</a> read about Balzac's novels in newspapers she received from Paris. Intrigued, she ordered copies of his work, and she read them with her cousins and friends around <a href="Volhynia">Volhynia</a>. They were impressed by the understanding he showed toward women in "La Physiologie du mariage", but felt that "La Peau de chagrin" portrayed them in a cruel and unforgiving light. Hańska wrote a letter to Balzac, signed it as "L'Étrangère" ("The Stranger"), and mailed it from <a href="Odessa">Odessa</a> on 28 February 1832.

With no return address, Balzac was left to reply in the "Gazette de France", with the hope that she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its philosophical concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way, and feel that if I were to actually set eyes upon you, I should instantly exclaim, 'That is he!'"

Eventually she revealed herself to him, and they began a correspondence that lasted for fifteen years. Although she remained faithful to her husband Wacław, Mme. Hańska and Balzac enjoyed an emotional intimacy through their letters. When the baron died in 1841, the French author began to pursue the relationship outside the written page. They wed in the town of <a href="Berdychiv">Berdychiv</a> on 14 March 1850, five months before he died.

Because it was among the first novels he released under his own name, Balzac did not use characters in "La Peau de chagrin" from previous works. He did, however, introduce several individuals who resurfaced in later stories. Most significant of these is <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20de%20Rastignac">Eugène de Rastignac</a>, the older gentleman who tutors Valentin in the vicious ways of high society. Thirty pages into the writing of his 1834 novel "<a href="Le%20P%C3%A8re%20Goriot">Le Père Goriot</a>", Balzac suddenly crossed out the name he had been using for a character – Massiac – and used Rastignac instead. The relationship between teacher and student in "La Peau de chagrin" is mirrored in "Le Père Goriot", when the young Rastignac is guided in the ways of social "<a href="realpolitik">realpolitik</a>" by the incognito criminal <a href="Vautrin">Vautrin</a>.

Balzac used the character Foedora in three other stories, but eventually wrote her out of them after deciding on other models for social femininity. In later editions of "La Peau de chagrin", he changed the text to name one of the bankers "Taillefer", whom he had introduced in "<a href="L%27Auberge%20rouge%20%28short%20story%29">L'Auberge rouge</a>" (1831). He also used the name Horace Bianchon for one of the doctors, thus connecting the book to the famous physician who appears in thirty-one stories in "La Comédie humaine". So vividly had the doctor been rendered that Balzac himself called out for Bianchon while lying on his deathbed.

The use of recurring characters lends Balzac's work a cohesion and atmosphere unlike any other series of novels. It enables a depth of <a href="characterization">characterization</a> that goes beyond simple narration or dialogue. "When the characters reappear", notes the critic Samuel Rogers, "they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see." Although the complexity of these characters' lives inevitably led Balzac to make errors of chronology and consistency, the mistakes are considered minor in the overall scope of the project. Readers are more often troubled by the sheer number of people in Balzac's world, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> said that he never tried to read Balzac, because he "did not know where to begin".

Balzac's novel was adapted for the <a href="libretto">libretto</a> of <a href="Giselher%20Klebe">Giselher Klebe</a>'s 1959 opera "<a href="Die%20t%C3%B6dlichen%20W%C3%BCnsche">Die tödlichen Wünsche</a>" ("The Deadly Wishes"). 1977–1978 the German composer <a href="Fritz%20Gei%C3%9Fler">Fritz Geißler</a> composed "Das Chagrinleder" after a libretto by <a href="G%C3%BCnther%20Deicke">Günther Deicke</a>. In 1989–1990 the Russian composer <a href="Yuri%20Khanon">Yuri Khanon</a> wrote the <a href="ballet">ballet</a> "L’Os de chagrin" ("<a href="The%20Shagreen%20Bone">The Shagreen Bone</a>"), based on Balzac's text, which included an <a href="opera">opera</a>-<a href="Entr%27acte">interlude</a> of the same name. In 1992 a <a href="Biographical%20film">biographic</a> <a href="pseudo-documentary">pseudo-documentary</a> in the form of an opera-film based on his opera "L'os de Chagrin" () was released.

The novel has also been cited as a possible influence on <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> for his 1890 novel "<a href="The%20Picture%20of%20Dorian%20Gray">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a>", although this hypothesis is rejected by most scholars. The protagonist, Dorian Gray, acquires a magical portrait that ages while he remains forever youthful.

Russian literature specialist Priscilla Meyer maintains in her book How the Russians Read the French, that both La Peau de Chagrin and Pere Goriot were extensively paralleled, subverted and inverted, by Dostoevsky in Crime and Punishment.

In 1960 Croatian animator <a href="Vladimir%20Kristl">Vladimir Kristl</a> made an animated short entitled "Šagrenska koža" ("The Piece of Shagreen Leather") inspired by Balzac's novel.

Toward the end of his life, Austrian <a href="psychoanalyst">psychoanalyst</a> <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> felt a special connection to Balzac's novel, since he believed that his world was shrinking like Valentin's talisman. Diagnosed with a fatal <a href="tumor">tumor</a>, Freud resolved to commit <a href="suicide">suicide</a>. After re-reading "La Peau de chagrin", he said to his doctor: "This was the proper book for me to read; it deals with shrinking and starvation." The next day, his doctor administered a lethal dose of <a href="morphine">morphine</a>, and Freud died.

In 2011 French director <a href="Marianne%20Badrichani">Marianne Badrichani</a> staged an <a href="http%3A//peauchagrin.blogspot.com">adaptation of "La Peau de Chagrin"</a> in London's <a href="Holland%20Park">Holland Park</a>.

Yesterday's Enterprise

"Yesterday's Enterprise" is the 63rd episode of the American <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> television series "". It is the 15th episode of the , first airing in syndication in the week of February 19, 1990. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of the <a href="United%20Federation%20of%20Planets">Federation</a> starship "<a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701-D%29">Enterprise</a>". In the story, the ship's crew must decide whether to send the time-traveling <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701-C%29">"Enterprise"-C</a> back through a temporal rift to its certain destruction, to prevent damaging changes to their <a href="Timestream%23Science%20fiction">timeline</a>.

The plot for "Yesterday's Enterprise" was based on the merging of two story ideas—one featured the crew of the time-traveling "Enterprise"-C and the other the return of <a href="Denise%20Crosby">Denise Crosby</a>, whose character had been killed in the series' first season. Trent Christopher Ganino and <a href="Eric%20A.%20Stillwell">Eric A. Stillwell</a> rewrote the merged story to feature the character of <a href="Guinan%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Guinan</a> more prominently. To complete the episode in time for <a href="Nielsen%20ratings%23Sweeps">sweeps</a>, the final script was finished by a team of five writers.

Filming of the episode lasted a week, with some elements of the script ultimately not included due to time constraints. In syndication, "Yesterday's Enterprise" outperformed most of the third season's episodes with a 13.1 <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a>, the third-highest number for the series at the time. The episode is cited as a favorite by crew members and reviewers, and is widely regarded as one of the best episodes of the series.

The <a href="starship">starship</a> encounters a rift in <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a> while on a routine mission. As they monitor the anomaly, the heavily damaged <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701-C%29">USS "Enterprise"-C</a>, a ship believed to have been destroyed more than two decades earlier, emerges. Instantly, the "Enterprise"-D undergoes a sudden and radical change from its current timeline: it is now a warship, and the <a href="United%20Federation%20of%20Planets">United Federation of Planets</a> is at war with the <a href="Klingon">Klingon</a>s. Neither <a href="Worf">Worf</a> nor <a href="Deanna%20Troi">Counselor Troi</a> are seen or referred to, and <a href="Tasha%20Yar">Tasha Yar</a> – who was killed years before – is now running the tactical station. None of the crew notice the change, but <a href="Guinan%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Guinan</a> senses that reality has shifted, and has a meeting with <a href="Jean-Luc%20Picard">Captain Picard</a> to discuss her concerns. She senses that there are supposed to be children on the ship, which of course is completely impractical on a warship. She suggests that the "Enterprise"-C does not belong in their time and must return to the past. Picard, who knows that this would be a suicide mission, refuses to give such an order based on Guinan's intuition alone.

Captain Rachel Garrett of the "Enterprise"-C and her crew learn they have traveled into the future. Garrett explains that they were responding to a distress call from the Klingon outpost on Narendra III, and were attacked by <a href="Romulan">Romulan</a> starships. While his crew works to repair the "Enterprise"-C and tend to the crew's injuries, Picard and his command staff discuss whether or not the ship should return to the past. <a href="William%20Riker">Commander Riker</a> argues that their deaths would be meaningless, but <a href="Data%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Data</a> suggests that it would be considered an <a href="honour">honorable</a> act by the Klingons. Picard discusses the situation with Garrett, who tells him that her crew will serve the Federation in the present. Picard quietly reveals to her that the Federation is on the verge of defeat and the presence of one ship will make no difference, but if the "Enterprise"-C were to return to the past they might prevent the war from ever starting. Garrett agrees and announces to her crew that they will return through the anomaly; at that moment, the two ships are ambushed by a <a href="Klingon%20starships%23Bird%20of%20Prey%20classes">Klingon Bird of Prey</a>. Garrett is killed, and her helmsman, Richard Castillo, takes command.

During the repair efforts, Yar becomes close to Castillo, but is unnerved by tense interactions with Guinan. Guinan reveals to Yar that she knows Yar dies a meaningless death in the other timeline, and that the two should never have met. Based on her discussion with Guinan, Yar requests a transfer to the "Enterprise"-C, which is granted by Picard. As the "Enterprise"-C prepares to return through the anomaly, three Klingon battlecruisers attack. With the anomaly becoming unstable, Picard orders the "Enterprise"-D to cover the "Enterprise"-C's withdrawal. The "Enterprise"-D suffers major crew losses under the Klingon barrage, including the death of Commander Riker, forcing Picard to man the tactical station himself. With the "Enterprise"-D on the brink of destruction, the "Enterprise"-C traverses the anomaly, triggering the return of "Enterprise"-D's original timeline. In the restored timeline, Guinan – the only one subtly aware of what has transpired – asks <a href="Geordi%20La%20Forge">Geordi La Forge</a> to tell her more about Yar.

At the beginning of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" third season, <a href="Michael%20Piller">Michael Piller</a> became the head writer for the series. Among the changes he implemented was the opening of the story submission process to non-professional and unrepresented writers. Despite <a href="Paramount%20Television">Paramount Television</a>'s resistance to the change, "The Next Generation" became the first show produced in Hollywood to allow such writers to submit their scripts. The studio received more than 5,000 scripts in a year.

Among the scripts submitted by freelance or aspiring writers was one by Trent Christopher Ganino. Ganino's <a href="spec%20script">speculative script</a>, submitted to the office of pre-production associate Eric A. Stillwell in April 1989, was titled "Yesterday's Enterprise". The story involved the "Enterprise"-D's response to a crisis in the Golecian sector and an encounter with "Enterprise"-C, which had been destroyed 18 years earlier. The crew of the "Enterprise"-C is in awe of the newer ship's technology, and Picard is confronted with whether to reveal to his guests their ultimate fate. An "Enterprise"-C ensign accidentally discovers the fate of his vessel and panics, requiring Worf and Riker to capture him after he attempts to escape. When Golecian warships attack, Picard defends the "Enterprise"-C using the same maneuver that caused the vessel's destruction in the past. The ensign goes back to his ship, which returns to the past and its certain destruction.

Due to the backlog of scripts, the processing of draft submissions could take anywhere from weeks to a year. Ganino's script was "logged" on May 2 and first read later that month by Richard Manning, a co-producer on the writing staff. Manning commented that the draft was "not horrible, not particularly "original", but good in spots, lousy in others". This review was enough to keep the script in circulation.

Executive story editor Melinda Snodgrass read Ganino's speculative script for "Yesterday's Enterprise" in June and attached a post-it note declaring the story an "interesting idea". A "coverage" of the script, which outlined the plot and provided creative feedback, was written in August. This analysis called the script a "good effort by an unrepresented writer", and considered the script's weak characterization and plot issues correctable. The main issue was whether the producers wanted to do a show with time travel.
Meanwhile, Ganino and Stillwell struck up a friendship and began to develop ideas for other episodes. <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> had distributed a memo that said the return of <a href="Leonard%20Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a> as <a href="Spock">Spock</a> would be unlikely due to financial considerations, and suggested that a reasonable alternative would be to feature <a href="Mark%20Lenard">Mark Lenard</a>, who played Spock's father <a href="Sarek">Sarek</a>. During the same period, Stillwell met Denise Crosby – who played Tasha Yar in the series' first season – at a 1989 fan convention in San Jose. Over dinner, Crosby admitted she missed being part of the series and suggested that Stillwell write a script to bring back her character, who was killed off in the episode "<a href="Skin%20of%20Evil">Skin of Evil</a>". Ganino and Stillwell began to work on script ideas that would involve both Yar and Sarek.

Ganino and Stillwell were particular fans of two episodes from the original "" series, "" and "<a href="The%20City%20on%20the%20Edge%20of%20Forever">The City on the Edge of Forever</a>", and wanted to combine elements from them for a "Next Generation" episode. They came up with a story involving a team of <a href="Vulcan%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Vulcans</a> investigating the <a href="Guardian%20of%20Forever">Guardian of Forever</a>. In the past, the founder of modern Vulcan logic, <a href="Surak">Surak</a>, is killed, causing massive changes to the timeline. The Romulans and Vulcans joined forces to attack the Federation, Worf is no longer a crewmember on the "Enterprise", and Tasha Yar remains alive. Sarek and the Vulcans by the Guardian are the only people not affected by the timeline change and, in the end, Sarek returns to the past to take Surak's place, restoring the timeline.

After Ganino and Stilwell pitched him the new script, Piller suggested to producer <a href="Rick%20Berman">Rick Berman</a> that the story, not the script, be purchased. In a meeting, Piller told Ganino that he wanted to make changes to the story, which included the addition of Tasha Yar. Fearing that what they considered a better story would be lost if the changes were made to "Yesterday's Enterprise", Stillwell talked to Piller and pitched their Guardian of Forever story. While intrigued by elements of the story, Piller felt the use of the Guardian was a "gimmick" and wanted "The Next Generation" to stand on its own. Instead, Piller suggested that they merge the two stories, with Stillwell and Ganino sharing writing credit. Piller suggested that the "Enterprise" crew would immediately undergo a transformation due to the presence of the older "Enterprise", and that Guinan would be integral to the realization that something was wrong. Ganino and Stillwell were given two weeks to complete their new story.

Ganino and Stillwell completed their new combined story in about a week. The writers spent hours each day at Stillwell's apartment working over every detail; they felt pressured to write a story Piller would find acceptable, as they wanted to have the opportunity to write the teleplay. The story treatment was turned in on October 10. Piller immediately decided to purchase the story and distributed the treatment to the writing staff while he discussed changes. Piller felt that Data's romantic feelings for Tasha Yar were over the top, and that an alien probe which served as a central part of the story was a cheat in terms of resolving Picard's dilemma. The writer wanted Ganino and Stillwell to enhance Guinan's role and to find another character arc for Tasha Yar. A revised treatment was submitted on October 29, incorporating Piller's changes. The writers were not involved in development of the teleplay. They were each paid the <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%2C%20West">Writers Guild</a> minimum of $2400.

The production of the episode, originally scheduled for January 1990, was moved to December 1989 to accommodate the filming availability of Crosby and <a href="Whoopi%20Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>, who played Guinan. The task of writing and polishing the new treatment in half the time fell upon writer <a href="Ronald%20D.%20Moore">Ronald D. Moore</a>, who submitted his first draft on November 9. Moore's script removed the alien probe and made the alternate universe militaristic, with the Federation and the Klingons at war. Some characters, such as Troi, appeared only briefly at the beginning of the episode to allow more screen time for the guest characters. The <a href="beat%20%28filmmaking%29">beat sheet</a> for the episode, which detailed characters and scenes, was distributed on November 27.

Due to time constraints, a team of writers was assigned to write the teleplay. In addition to the story credit to Ganino and Stillwell, Moore, <a href="Ira%20Steven%20Behr">Ira Steven Behr</a>, Hans Beimler and Richard Manning would work on the teleplay, and Piller would provide the finishing touches. Because the Writers Guild would not allow more than three staff writers to appear in the credits (four after a special waiver was granted), Piller agreed to not feature his name in the credits. A partial first draft was submitted on November 30 so that preproduction for the episode could commence. The altered timeline provided a chance to show the "Enterprise" crew in a much more dramatic and human light than would be allowable in a normal episode. Behr explained that since the original timeline was to be restored, the writers had the freedom to include more action. "Even though it was an alternate universe, [Moore] and I got all excited because we realized we were going to kill everyone on screen", he said. <a href="Michael%20Okuda">Michael Okuda</a> and <a href="Rick%20Sternbach">Rick Sternbach</a> submitted technical memos regarding the type of anomaly that might drag the "Enterprise"-C through time, and suggested interstellar, super-dense <a href="string%20theory">strings</a> as a possibility. The first draft teleplay was completed by December 4, and a preproduction meeting was held the same day. Given the scale of the story, various departments argued over costs and what items could be cut to reduce the budget. The final draft was finished and submitted on December 8.

The studio decided to increase the episode's budget, which at that time was estimated by "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Daily Variety</a>" as $1.2 million per episode. This gave the production departments more leeway. One reason for the increase was that "Yesterday's Enterprise" would air during February <a href="Nielsen%20ratings%23Sweeps">sweeps</a>, an important time for the studio to attract solid ratings. As "The Next Generation" was <a href="Paramount%20Domestic%20Television">syndicated directly</a> by the studio, the episode's performance would affect advertising revenue for the future.
The script called for the creation of the "Enterprise"-C. In the first season, illustrator <a href="Andrew%20Probert">Andrew Probert</a> – who had designed the "Enterprise"-D – was interested in a display of the design lineage of the ship from <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">James T. Kirk</a>'s "<a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701%29">Enterprise</a>" to "The Next Generation"s much larger ship, which was realized as a wall relief in the conference lounge behind the command bridge. Like most others, Probert assumed that the "Enterprise"-B was an "Excelsior"-class vessel and reasoned that the "C" would share design elements with its "Excelsior"-class predecessor and its "Galaxy"-class successor, Picard's ship. During this lineage project, Probert also produced a small color sketch of his version of "Enterprise"-C, but he left at the end of the season and his absence meant that no one knew what the drawing was intended to be.

When Rick Sternbach took over Probert's duties, he believed the sketch was a rejected concept for the "Enterprise"-D, but the ship's design stayed with him. When he learned about the ship requirement for "Yesterday's Enterprise", he followed a thought process similar to Probert and built off the old sketch. Probert's version had a highly curved engineering hull reminiscent of a sailing ship, but Sternbach was worried that a design with so many compound curves would prove difficult to fabricate in the available time, so he made the hull entirely circular. A set of orthographic views was created and sent to <a href="Greg%20Jein">Greg Jein</a>, who fabricated the shooting model, which cost more than $10,000 to produce. The model was modified to appear as various "Ambassador"-class starships in later "Next Generation" episodes, with its saucer and nacelles spaced apart to create a larger ship.

The production crew took several steps to differentiate the alternate universe from the original one. In addition to the absence of a counselor, a "military log" was substituted for a captain's log and a "combat date" was used rather than stardate. The expanded budget allowed the bridge to be entirely redressed, something that would normally be infeasible. Steps replaced ramps on the bridge, and the captain's chair was elevated and made more throne-like. Longer, spartan tables were also substituted for the usual decor in the Ten-Forward lounge. While enlisted crew aboard the darker "Enterprise" wore variations of the Season 1–2 uniforms, the senior officers wore slightly modified versions of the uniforms introduced in Season 3. The "Enterprise"-C officers wore costumes from earlier "Star Trek" feature films due to the expense and time-consuming nature of creating more than a half-dozen or so new uniforms for the episode. Costume designer <a href="Robert%20Blackman">Robert Blackman</a>'s solution to change their appearance was to remove the turtleneck collars underneath the red tunics, as well as the belts, although the rear belt loop remained.

Filming began on Monday, December 11, 1989, and lasted for seven days. The episode was directed by <a href="David%20Carson%20%28director%29">David Carson</a>, who had only filmed one other "Next Generation" episode before "Yesterday's Enterprise". Carson felt that his relative lack of experience helped because he had no preconceptions about how episodes should be directed. Since much of the episode took place in the darker alternate universe, Carson wanted to emphasize the toll that decades of war had taken on the crew and the bridge. "Picard really looked tired and worn and like a battle-weary commander, and that's what we wanted the bridge to look like—a battle weary bridge. I had lots of thoughts about making it as strong as possible using a lot of low lights, a lot of dark blues, making it very much more moody", he said. To heighten the impact of the physical set changes, Carson took a different approach to how he constructed shots. "It was my intention to make it as much like a <a href="submarine">submarine</a> as possible and to use low-angle lighting; basically, to do everything the opposite way that the "Enterprise" was normally shot." The cameras were equipped with longer lenses than usual in order to reduce the depth of the scenes and provide a grittier feel. The use of low angles forced the lighting to be modified to prevent the scene from, in Carson's words, looking "like a hotel lobby".

Two new roles – Garrett and Castillo – needed to be filled for the production. The actors selected were both "Star Trek" fans. <a href="Christopher%20McDonald">Christopher McDonald</a> was picked for Castillo. "What impressed me about [McDonald]", Carson remembers, "was that he wasn't just your romantic leading man; he was actually a very impressive actor." <a href="Tricia%20O%27Neil">Tricia O'Neil</a> was cast for similar reasons; the actress was not the normal "Star Trek" commander type. Carson was also pleased to work with Crosby and Goldberg. The main cast enjoyed the opportunity to play their characters differently. The unusual degree of friction between characters provoked some concern with the producers. Berman, for example, was afraid that the episode was pushing the alternate timeline too far.

Ganino and Stillwell visited the set frequently during filming. Members of the main cast approached Stillwell with questions about the nature of the altered universe, trying to determine if they were still playing the same characters. Goldberg asked Ganino about changing a piece of dialogue on set, but since Ganino was not the author of the teleplay, he deferred to Stillwell, who in turn notified the production office. When Berman found out that Ganino and Stillwell were on set and talking to the actors, he banned them from setting foot on the sets again.

Many planned elements were never filmed, due to production time constraints. Moore had hoped for an extended battle scene in which Data would be electrocuted, and <a href="Wesley%20Crusher">Wesley Crusher</a> blown up in an explosion. Production of the episode ended on December 19.

"Yesterday's Enterprise" was first broadcast the week of February 19, 1990. Because "The Next Generation" aired in syndication, "Yesterday's Enterprise" did not air on a specific day or time slot. The episode received a 13.1 <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> for the time period from February 19 to March 4 – the third highest rating for the series, and the highest for the entire season. While the season had averaged 9,817,000 households, "Yesterday's Enterprise" was viewed by 12,070,000 households.

The episode has been well received by reviewers. <a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a> ranked it No. 7 on its list of the ten best "Star Trek" episodes for the magazine's celebration of the franchise's 30th anniversary. In a retrospective review, Zack Handlen of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" praised the episode for quickly establishing the premise and stakes, as well as turning Tasha Yar's death into one of the episode's "strongest emotional beats ... Tasha's determination to die with meaning by the end of [the episode] transforms her from a misstep into something more noble and sad." In contrast, <a href="Tor%20Books">Tor Books</a>' <a href="Keith%20DeCandido">Keith DeCandido</a> wrote that while the guest stars were excellent, Tasha Yar's return for a "TV death" is the episode's major flaw: "It is, in short, a scripted death, and you can see the marionette strings", he wrote. Film critic Jordan Hoffman wrote that the episode is "heavy, <a href="Philip%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BK.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>-ian stuff that actually takes some thought to follow and ... all victories come at a cost", and that it is a fan favorite episode for good reason. Likewise, "Den of Geek" reviewer James Hunt praised the episode for finding the human stakes in the story, elevating it above standard science fiction time travel stories.

Critic Marc Bernardin described the episode as "Star Trek"s "smartest time-travel experiment" and a fan favorite. The "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" listed "The Next Generation"s time-shifting episodes, including "Yesterday's Enterprise", as one of the twenty best elements of the show. Fans attending the Star Trek 50th Anniversary convention in 2015 voted "Yesterday's Enterprise" the fifth-best episode of the franchise. The episode ranked first in "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"s list of top 10 "Star Trek: The Next Generation" episodes. Screenwriters <a href="John%20Logan%20%28writer%29">John Logan</a> and <a href="Roberto%20Orci">Roberto Orci</a>, writers for the film "" (2002) and the reboot "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%29">Star Trek</a>" (2009), respectively, cite "Yesterday's Enterprise" as one of their favorite episodes and influences.

The first home media release of "Yesterday's Enterprise" was on <a href="VHS">VHS</a> cassette, appearing on July 11, 1995, in the United States and Canada. "Yesterday's Enterprise" was also included as one of four episodes (along with "" and "") in a DVD collection entitled "The Best of "Star Trek: The Next Generation"". The episode was later included on the "Star Trek: The Next Generation" season three <a href="DVD">DVD</a> box set, released in the United States on September 3, 2002. The first <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> release was in the United States on April 30, 2013.

Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri

Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri is a 1996 <a href="Tactical%20shooter">tactical</a> <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> video game developed and published by <a href="Looking%20Glass%20Studios">Looking Glass Technologies</a>. Set in a <a href="science%20fiction">science-fictional</a> depiction of the 24th century, the game follows a faction of humans who colonize the <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a> star system to escape from the Hegemony, a <a href="Totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> Earth government. The player assumes the role of Nikola ap Io, the leader of an Alpha Centauri military unit, and undertakes missions against pirates and the Hegemony.

"Terra Nova" has been cited as one of the first squad-oriented games with <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional</a> (3D) graphics; the player is often assisted by <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificially intelligent</a> teammates who may be given tactical commands. Conceived by Looking Glass after the completion of their first game, "", "Terra Nova" was subject to a long and difficult development process, caused in part by the production of its <a href="Full%20motion%20video%20based%20game">full motion video</a> <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s. The game's TED engine can render 3D outdoor environments and simulate physics; the latter enables such effects as <a href="procedural%20animation">procedural animation</a>.

"Terra Nova"s critical reception was highly positive. Reviewers praised its tactical elements, and several compared it to the 1995 video game "". However, reception of its graphics was mixed, and many noted the game's steep system requirements. Despite critical acclaim and sales in excess of 100,000 units, the game was a commercial failure: it did not recoup its development costs. While it was intended to be the first in a series, its low sales led the company to cancel plans for a sequel.

As a <a href="tactical%20shooter">tactical</a> <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a>, "Terra Nova" focuses on combat and takes place from a <a href="First%20person%20%28video%20games%29">character's eye view</a> in a <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional</a> (3D) graphical environment. The protagonist wears <a href="powered%20exoskeleton">powered battle armor</a> (PBA) that features lock-on targeting, jumpjets for limited flight, infrared and zoomed vision, and a rechargeable <a href="Force%20shield">energy shield</a> that protects against attacks. The player uses a <a href="point-and-click">freely movable mouse cursor</a> to aim weapons and manipulate the <a href="HUD%20%28video%20gaming%29">heads-up display</a> (HUD) interface. As with Looking Glass Technologies' earlier game "<a href="System%20Shock">System Shock</a>", the HUD contains three "Multi-Function Displays" (MFDs). These screens may be configured to display tactical information, such as squad command menus, maps and weapon statistics.

The player is usually accompanied by up to three <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificially intelligent</a> squadmates, who may be given tactical orders such as holding a position, taking cover or rushing enemies. Squadmates may be commanded as a group or individually; for example, one half of a squad may be used to distract enemies while the other half attacks an objective. Each squad member specializes in weapons, reconnaissance, repairs, demolitions or electronics. Those in the latter four categories may be given special commands, such as repairing a teammate's armor or setting explosive charges. During missions, squad members radio in enemy sightings and status assessments.

The game takes place in 37 missions. Each begins with a briefing that describes such details as objectives, squad size and enemies. Objectives range from rescues and assaults to reconnaissance photography. Additional missions—whose contents may be selected by the player—are available through the game's "Random Scenario Builder". Before undertaking missions, the player outfits the squad and protagonist with PBA suits and equipment. The three types of PBA—Scout, Standard and Heavy—vary in ability; for example, the Scout armor is fast and light, while the Heavy armor is slow and powerful. Each may be fitted with weapons and an "Auxiliary Suit Function" (ASF); the latter ranges from increased jumpjet power to deployable automatic turrets. Only a small amount of equipment is available at the outset, but more becomes accessible as the game progresses. Between missions, the player may read e-mails, news and military files, and a "library" that details the game's setting.

"Terra Nova" is set in a <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>al depiction of the year 2327 and takes place in the <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a> star system. The setting's early inspirations were the novels "<a href="Starship%20Troopers">Starship Troopers</a>" and "<a href="The%20Forever%20War">The Forever War</a>", and "<a href="PC%20Gamer%23PC%20Gamer%20UK">PC Gamer UK</a>" compared it to that of the 1986 <a href="action%20film">action film</a> "<a href="Aliens%20%28film%29">Aliens</a>". Over two hundred years before the beginning of the game, Earth is subsumed by a <a href="world%20government">world government</a> called the Hegemony, whose "Publicanism" philosophy "<a href="PC%20Zone">PC Zone</a>" summarized as "communism without the economic restrictions". The Hegemony annexes colonies throughout the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>, but the inhabitants of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>'s moons reach an agreement that allows them to relocate to Alpha Centauri, where they settle on the Earth-like NewHope and the frozen Thatcher planets. The settlers divide into twelve "Clans"—each with a military "Strike Force" to defend against bandits—and create the Centauri Council to govern the system. Trade is established with the Hegemony. As the game begins, an elite Strike Force called Strike Force Centauri is formed in response to increasing pirate activity.

The protagonist of "Terra Nova" is Nikola ap Io, the squad leader of Strike Force Centauri. His older brother, Brandt ap Io, is one of his subordinates, and the two share a mutual animosity. Other members of the squad include Sarah Walker, the daughter of a Centauri Council member; Ernest Schuyler, who is known for his sense of humor; and the frank and abrasive Simon Ashford. Each member was given a personality so that the player would form connections with the squad. Commander Arlen MacPherson assumes overall charge of the squad, and he has regular dealings with Hegemony ambassador Creon Pentheus. Live-action <a href="Full%20motion%20video%20based%20game">full-motion video</a> <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s depicting character interaction occasionally play between missions.

As the game begins, pirates steal a shipment of highly destructive "Petrovsk grenades". A reconnaissance mission by Nikola identifies the grenades at a heavily defended pirate base, and they are recovered en route to a transport ship. Without the grenades, the base is assaulted by Strike Force Centauri, and Hegemony equipment is found there. When MacPherson confronts Pentheus about the incident, he denies involvement. Proof of the Hegemony's intentions is later found at a Thatcher smuggling base, and Pentheus declares war on the Centauri colonies. Now knowing the pirates are funded by the Hegemony, MacPherson suspects that a previous information leak was in fact the work of a Hegemony spy; Nikola questions Brandt, who responds with indignance. After a series of missions against the Hegemony, Nikola's aircraft is ambushed and shot down, and he is captured by Pentheus. During this time, Pentheus tells him that a traitor within Strike Force Centauri is responsible for the ambush. The squad rescues Nikola, but Schuyler is killed in the assault. At his funeral, Ashford accuses Nikola as the traitor.

It soon becomes clear that MacPherson is being poisoned. Nikola believes that Brandt is responsible, because of his recent disappearances, but is proven wrong. After MacPherson dies, Sarah Walker takes his place as commander of Strike Force Centauri. Walker sends Nikola, disguised as a pirate, on an espionage mission to discover the traitor's identity. Nikola finds information that incriminates Ashford, who, when confronted, boasts of his actions and leaps to his death from a docking bay. The squad continues the war, and the Hegemony is eventually forced to gather its remaining forces at a base on Thatcher. The squad destroys the facility by detonating a highly explosive fuel tank inside it. Following its defeat, the Hegemony denies involvement in the war, declares Pentheus a rogue agent and appoints a new ambassador to the system. While angered by the announcement, Strike Force Centauri celebrates its victory as the game ends.

"Terra Nova" was conceived in 1992, around the time that Looking Glass Technologies' first game, "", was completed. Company co-founder <a href="Paul%20Neurath">Paul Neurath</a> wrote a <a href="Game%20design%20document">design document</a> for a tactical, squad-based game with a science fiction setting, and he helped the team initiate its development. Artist Robb Waters created concept art. It was originally titled "Freefall", because of the way the soldiers enter combat by dropping from aircraft. Development was initially led by a newly hired programmer who envisioned the game as an exact simulation, in which every element was as realistic as possible. Programmer Dan Schmidt created the game's artificial intelligence, and he attempted to make squadmates intelligently follow orders and provide assistance, instead of merely "staying out of your way". Schmidt hired <a href="Eric%20Brosius">Eric Brosius</a> and <a href="Terri%20Brosius">Terri Brosius</a>, then-members of the band <a href="Tribe%20%28band%29">Tribe</a>, to compose the game's music, which was called "orchestrally flavored" by the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>". As with their 1995 video game "<a href="Flight%20Unlimited">Flight Unlimited</a>", Looking Glass Technologies self-published "Terra Nova".

The game began production alongside the company's second project, "", and remained in development after that game's 1993 release. It then continued through the creation of their titles "<a href="System%20Shock">System Shock</a>" (released in 1994) and "Flight Unlimited". The game was subject to numerous delays, which Schmidt later attributed to its lack of a set deadline. He stated that the team was "trying to go with the same philosophy" as the company's earlier games, in that they would "develop the systems and the game would come out of it". However, the team's development priorities regularly changed, and the programmer who led the project left several years into production. According to Schmidt, his departure meant that "there was no-one left who was psyched about making this really [realistic] simulation". Despite this fact, the team continued using the idea, even though serious difficulties were involved in achieving it. Schmidt said that the game's development status was uncertain after the programmer left, and that he inherited the role of lead programmer around that time merely because the position had to be filled. He later assumed the role of project leader. In January 1995, Looking Glass showed "Terra Nova" alongside "Flight Unlimited" at the Winter <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a>, under their "Immersive Reality" marketing label.

In the team's original plan, "Terra Nova" consisted of missions that were bookended by simplistic cutscenes, akin to those of the 1990 <a href="Origin%20Systems">Origin Systems</a> video game "<a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28video%20game%29">Wing Commander</a>". However, in 1994, Origin released "", which features live-action <a href="Full%20motion%20video%20based%20game">full-motion video</a> (FMV) cutscenes. This pressured Looking Glass into incorporating FMV into "Terra Nova". Schmidt later said, "Lots of A-list games were including more and more FMV, and it was felt by management that if "Terra Nova" didn't have any, it would look second-rate." The decision to include it came when the game was already overdue, and a large portion of the game's funding was redirected toward cutscene production. A scriptwriter from outside the company was hired to write the cutscenes; because of the interplay between the cutscenes and missions, the script underwent numerous rewrites. The game's delays and large budget resulted in the removal of a planned online multiplayer component, and the FMV cutscenes, which were expensive to produce, increased the number of sales needed to recoup development costs. A patch was planned to release post-launch in September 1996 and add the online multiplayer functionality, but it did not materialize. Schmidt called the cutscenes a "giant distraction" for the team and himself as project leader: he later described them as "cheesier than most" of those from the period and noted that "I wince a lot looking back on [them]". Schmidt believed that they were likely an error from a business standpoint, as they further increased the game's budget and production length, but ultimately did not increase sales.

Roughly a year before its release, the team concluded that "Terra Nova"s realistic, simulation-style gameplay was not enjoyable. However, Schmidt said that the game's already lengthy development meant that it had to be released; otherwise, he believed that it would be canceled, or that its high cost would bankrupt the company. As a result, the game was completely redesigned to be "much more <a href="Arcade%20game">arcadey</a>" only a few months before release. Schmidt said that, in the new game, "you were going around blowing people up" and "your enemies have brackets on them showing their health and it's very bright and glowy and green". He believed that these elements drastically increased the game's enjoyability. He summarized, "Six months before it shipped the game wasn't fun at all and we actually ended up shipping something that was at least somewhat enjoyable to play". After previously being slated to launch in the second quarter of 1995, the game was released on March 5, 1996; by this time, its graphical technology had been surpassed by other video games, according to Schmidt. Lead programmer Art Min later expressed dissatisfaction with the game: he believed that, while the team coalesced at the end of development, they shipped the game too soon because of "an overexcited VP of Product Development".

Unlike Looking Glass' previous first-person games—"Ultima Underworld", "Ultima Underworld II" and "System Shock"—"Terra Nova" takes place in outdoor environments. The game's engine, named TED, supports weather conditions, day and night environments, real-time water reflections and moving clouds, among other effects. Most of the work on the outdoor renderer was done by programmer Eric Twietmeyer; however, contemporary computers were not powerful enough to display fully three-dimensional (3D) outdoor environments. The problem was solved by programmer James Fleming: the game's engine renders and <a href="Texture%20mapping">applies textures</a> to foreground objects in full 3D graphics, but—according to "<a href="PC%20Gamer%20US">PC Gamer US</a>"—it displays a "<a href="bitmap">bitmap</a>ped background in the distance" to provide the "illusion of detail". As with "Flight Unlimited" and the CD-ROM release of "System Shock", "Terra Nova" was designed to support <a href="head-mounted%20display">head-mounted display</a>s. The game features <a href="QSound">QSound</a> technology. Describing QSound's effect before the game's release, Suzanne Kantra Kirschner of "<a href="Popular%20Science">Popular Science</a>" wrote that "you'll hear the rustle of leaves from the right speaker a split second before you hear it in the left[,] signaling you that the enemy is approaching from the right".

The game's characters are <a href="procedural%20animation">procedurally animated</a> via simulated physics models and <a href="inverse%20kinematics">inverse kinematics</a> (IK)—a system designed by programmer <a href="Seamus%20Blackley">Seamus Blackley</a>. Basic physics are used to move character models through the environment, and the models are animated by the IK system in accordance with this movement. Designer Richard Wyckoff later compared the character physics to those of a marble, and Schmidt described the technique as akin to putting each character in a <a href="hamster%20ball">hamster ball</a>. The system's imperfect nature can result in animation glitches. A more realistic simulation of <a href="bipedalism">bipedal</a> movement was originally planned, but it was simplified before release because of coding difficulties. Schmidt later said that the original method "almost always worked", but that "every thirty minutes someone would put their foot down slightly wrong ... and then go flying off across the map". A physics model is also used to simulate weapon recoil, the arc of projectiles and the gravity of each planet; for example, projectiles travel farther in low gravity environments.

Although "Terra Nova" sold more than 100,000 units, it was a commercial failure because it did not recoup its development costs. Designer Tim Stellmach later characterized its performance as "a disaster". Despite this, the game was acclaimed by critics, and several publications drew comparisons to the 1995 video game "".

"<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" compared the game favorably to "System Shock" due to its balanced combination of action and strategy, stating that in just two years Looking Glass "has metamorphosed from one of the industry's secret technology powerhouses to a hugely respected developer in its own right." John Payne of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" wrote, "Depending on your point of view, "Terra Nova" is either a stripped-down "Mechwarrior" or a souped-up "<a href="Doom%20%28series%29">Doom</a>"." However, he stated that it was enjoyable regardless of which perspective was taken. While he described the game's animation as "fluid", he found its graphics in general to be "fairly blocky, even at a distance". He finished his review by stating that the game "requires more practice than action fans are used to" but provides "a nice payoff". "<a href="Next%20Generation%20Magazine">Next Generation Magazine</a>" wrote, "Looking Glass has always been known for breaking the barriers of conventional gameplay, and it has done it again with "Terra Nova"". The magazine considered the game to be "an all around stunning effort".

"<a href="The%20Sunday%20Star-Times">The Sunday Star-Times</a>" Peter Eley found the game to be extremely complex, and he noted the originality of its "real-time, full motion and 3D combat simulation". He called its sound and music "stunning" but found that its graphics "aren't as crisp as some other games", and he described performance issues. Lee Perkins of "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" also found the game's performance and graphics lacking, but he said, "In spite of its visual shortcomings, "Terra Nova" has the same level of inherent player appeal as "System Shock"". He concluded that the game's "tactical demands ... are probably its strongest point", and that it "isn't quite up in the "Mechwarrior 2" league, [but] it's making some very loud noises with avid mech-combat fans". "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Strategy Plus</a>" Tim Royal offered similar praise for its strategic elements; however, like the other two, he noted the game's performance issues, and he called its graphics "above average, but not mind-boggling". He finished, "I ... won't say it beats "System Shock". It doesn't. ... But "Terra Nova" offers a wonderful variety of terrain, mission types, and scenarios".

William Wong of "<a href="Computer%20Shopper%20%28US%20magazine%29">Computer Shopper</a>" called it "a great game that is backed by good graphics and sound, and will keep you going for hours"; he also praised its cutscenes. He concluded, "If the [upcoming] multiplayer pack is as good as the standalone version, "Terra Nova" could be a strike force to be reckoned with." "<a href="PC%20Gamer%23PC%20Gamer%20UK">PC Gamer UK</a>"s James Flynn praised the game's graphics, sense of realism, and free-form missions; about the latter, he wrote, "There's no right or wrong way to complete any of the missions in "Terra Nova", and this is one of its strongest assets." He noted that it was "virtually impossible to recommend" the game to those with lower-end computers, but he believed that it was also "impossible to condemn Looking Glass for programming the game this way, because it feels so real, and its authenticity is what makes it so much fun". Daniel Jevons of "Maximum" approved of the graphics but disliked the focus on long-range combat and the use of the mouse to move a crosshair rather than the entire viewpoint. However, he concluded that the game "has a degree of depth that most robot combat games lack, the plot is strangely involving and despite the initial control difficulties, with perseverance most competent gamers will soon be stomping around the battlefields". Michael E. Ryan of "<a href="PC%20Magazine">PC Magazine</a>" praised the game's artificial intelligence and called its graphical quality "spectacular", but found its movement controls to be "awkward". He concluded, ""Terra Nova" is an exceptional game that combines frenetic, fast-paced action with real-time squad-level tactics. It doesn't get much better than this".

"Terra Nova" was named the 15th best computer game ever by "PC Gamer UK" in 1997. The editors called it "exactly the kind of dynamic, risk-taking, intelligent game we've been asking for". In 2000, "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Strategy Plus</a>" named it one of the "10 Best Sci-Fi Simulations" of all time.

"<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" has cited "Terra Nova" as one of the first 3D games with squad-oriented gameplay. <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>'s Bill Hiles said that the game "preceded the 'tactical squad-based, first-person shooter' action genre by a full two years", and that "In 1996, ..."Terra Nova" didn't feel like any other game out there". Hiles called "<a href="Tribes%202">Tribes 2</a>" "a spiritual descendent of "Terra Nova" if there ever was one". Project leader Dan Schmidt later said that he had "a bit of a negative experience overall because the thing dragged on forever", but he noted that "there are people who regard it highly so it can't have been that terrible". The 1998 video game "" features a <a href="procedural%20animation">procedural animation</a> system very similar to the one used in "Terra Nova".

While Schmidt said before the game's release that the team wanted to develop "a whole series of games that take place in the "Terra Nova" world", the game's poor sales made the creation of a sequel "impractical", according to Paul Neurath. As the game's publisher, Looking Glass took on the full burden of its commercial underperformance, which contributed to the company's bankruptcy and closure in May 2000. Neurath later said, "If we could do "Terra Nova" over, I would have dumped the cinematics and done online team play instead. Who knows, maybe then the "Tribes II" and "Halo" teams would be talking about the influence of "Terra Nova" on their games".

Myst V: End of Ages

Myst V: End of Ages is a 2005 <a href="adventure%20game">adventure video game</a>, the fifth installment in the "<a href="Myst%20%28series%29">Myst</a>" series. The game was developed by <a href="Cyan%20Worlds">Cyan Worlds</a>, published by <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>, and released for Macintosh and Windows PC platforms on September 20, 2005. As in previous games in the series, "End of Ages"s gameplay consists of navigating worlds known as "Ages" via the use of special books and items which act as portals. On each Age, the player solves puzzles and discovers story clues hidden in the Ages or written down in diaries and journals. The player's actions in the game decide the fate of the ancient D'ni civilization.

In a departure from previous titles in the "Myst" series, "End of Ages" replaces pre-rendered environments with worlds rendered in <a href="Real-time%20computer%20graphics">real-time 3D graphics</a>, allowing players to freely navigate the Ages. The faces of actors were digitally mapped onto three-dimensional character models to preserve realism. Cyan paid attention to making the game more accessible to new players by the addition of multiple methods of navigation and an in-game camera. "Myst" creator <a href="Rand%20Miller">Rand Miller</a> decided to give players the ability to decide the fates of the game's characters as a gift to "Myst" fans.

"End of Ages" was positively received upon release. Despite complaints such as lessened interactivity compared to previous games and poorer graphics, publications including "<a href="Macworld">Macworld</a>", "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>", and "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" judged the game a fitting end to the series. After "End of Ages"s release, Cyan abruptly announced the end of software development and the layoff of most of its staff, but was able to rehire much of the development team a few weeks later. Including "End of Ages"s sales, the "Myst" franchise had sold more than 12 million copies by November 2007.

"Myst V: End of Ages" is an <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a> taking place in the <a href="first-person%20narrative">first person</a>. Players travel across several worlds known as "Ages", solving puzzles and gathering story clues by reading books or observing the 
environment. "End of Ages" offers players three navigation modes to explore. The first, "Classic mode", uses the same controls used in "<a href="Myst">Myst</a>" and "<a href="Riven">Riven</a>"; Ages are divided into locations of interest, or nodes, and the player's view is fixed at every node. Players advance to other nodes by clicking on portions of the screen. The "Classic Plus" mode uses the control scheme of "" and ""; movement is still node-based but players can rotate their view 360 degrees in any direction. The final navigation mode, known as "Free Look" or "Advanced" mode, allows players to navigate and observe the Ages freely like "". The <a href="Arrow%20keys%23WASD%20keys">WASD</a> keyboard keys are used for walking forward, backward, and sideways, while the mouse changes the player's point of view.

A new game mechanic to the series is the use of a slate found on all the Ages. These slates can be carved using the mouse to create shapes and symbols. The use of the slate is necessary to communicate with a shadowy race of creatures known as the Bahro. The Bahro understand certain symbols drawn on the slate and will respond to them; the creatures also retrieve the slate and return it to its original space if the player drops it. Slate symbols can cause environmental changes such as rain or increased wind, which may be necessary for solving puzzles. The slate cannot be carried everywhere due to its size. For example, the player will have to leave the slate behind if they want to climb a ladder.

"End of Ages" has several features designed to help players complete puzzles. To recall clues or important items, players can use a camera feature to take screenshots, which are then placed in a journal the player can access at any time. Player interactions with other characters are similarly recalled via another journal; everything a character tells the player is stored and can be viewed at any time. Journal pages are narrated by the voice of the character, and missing pages of the journal appear translucent in menus.

"End of Ages" takes place in the present day, sometime after the events of "", and begins as the player responds to a letter from <a href="Characters%20of%20Myst%23Atrus%20and%20Catherine">Atrus</a>. Atrus is a writer of special volumes called linking books, which serve as portals or links to worlds known as Ages. A linking book to the Age of Myst, the setting of the original game, lies sealed in the ruins of the ancient D'ni civilization. The D'ni had the ability to craft linking books, but their society crumbled from within; Atrus and his family have been trying to restore the D'ni people and created an Age for the survivors to live on, known as Releeshahn (introduced in "Exile"). Atrus by this period is an old man, mourning the deaths of his sons <a href="Characters%20of%20Myst%23Sirrus%20and%20Achenar">Sirrus and Achenar</a> in "Revelation", and the death of his wife <a href="Characters%20of%20Myst%23Atrus%20and%20Catherine">Catherine</a> in the period after. In his letter, Atrus expresses concern that his daughter, <a href="Characters%20of%20Myst%23Yeesha">Yeesha</a>, may be lost as well.

The player starts in Atrus' old study on K'veer, an island near the ruins of the main D'ni city; in the antechamber outside the study, there is a strange tablet locked in place on an altar. Yeesha links in and explains that legends state that in order to fully restore D'ni, someone known as the Grower must utilize the tablet. The artifact has the ability to fully control a mysterious enslaved race known as the Bahro. As Yeesha made the wrong decision upon unlocking the tablet, she can no longer use it; Yeesha instead charges the player with uncovering the tablet's power. After leaving Yeesha, the player meets a man named <a href="Characters%20of%20Myst%23Esher">Esher</a> near "the Great Shaft", connecting D'ni to the surface (as detailed in ""). Esher is a survivor of the fall of D'ni and tells the player that Yeesha cannot be trusted, warning the player not to give her the Tablet. Throughout the Great Shaft, the player collects twelve fragments of Yeesha's journal. The writings appear to confirm Esher's warnings, as the narration seemingly indicates that Yeesha has descended into madness, believing herself to be the Grower.

At the urging of both Yeesha and Esher, the player travels across four Ages, collecting four slates that unlock the tablet's power. Esher occasionally appears in the Ages to offer his counsel, or reveal the histories of his people and the worlds the player explores. Once all four slates are collected, Esher requests that the player bring the tablet to him in the now-unlocked Age of Myst. The player is then returned to K'veer, where they have four possible choices. Travelling to Myst without the tablet will cause Esher to angrily abandon the player with no way out. If Esher is given the tablet, he will explain he wishes to use the tablet for domination, and will also leave the player trapped. If the player gives the tablet to Yeesha, the tablet simply slips through her hands and disappears into the ground; she walks away, disappointed, leaving the player trapped in D'ni. The only good ending involves giving the Bahro the tablet, ending their enslavement. Arriving at Releeshahn, the new home Age of the D'ni, Yeesha and Atrus thank the player and speak of a new chapter for the D'ni people; Esher is handed over to the Bahro to be punished for his crimes. The game ends on a visit to Releeshahn.

<a href="Robyn%20Miller">Robyn</a> and <a href="Rand%20Miller">Rand Miller</a>, "Myst"s creators, had initially decided against creating sequels to 1997's "<a href="Riven">Riven</a>". However, the publishing rights to the series later transferred to <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>, who commissioned two sequels: "" and "". "Myst V: End of Ages" was officially announced at the 2005 <a href="MacWorld%20Expo">MacWorld Expo</a> by "Myst" and "Riven"s developer, <a href="Cyan%20Worlds">Cyan Worlds</a>. In the announcement, Cyan stated that the game would be the final installment in the series.

Whereas most previous "Myst" titles had forgone 3D graphics rendered in real-time in favor of interactive prerendered environments, Rand Miller decided that technology had advanced to the point that "End of Ages" could use real-time graphics without sacrificing player immersion. "Over the years the "Myst" games have become increasingly sophisticated, culminating in "Myst V", where we offer striking graphics that players can walk smoothly through," Miller stated in an interview. Miller emphasized that the goal of the game remained for players to become immersed in "Myst"s alternate worlds.

A focus in development was to make "End of Ages" more accessible than previous "Myst" games, which had often stymied uninitiated players with their puzzles. Learning from the control scheme used in another real-time "Myst" game (a remake of the original entitled "<a href="realMyst">realMyst</a>"), Cyan decided to develop multiple control methods to allow new players to quickly learn the controls, as well as provide a familiar interface for franchise veterans. Esher's experiences with the player's quest allowed a hint system to be built into the story. Miller wanted to make a significant change from previous games in the series, in that the player's actions decide the fate of the characters. When asked about the ending, Miller explained, "The future of civilization is down to this point, and the choices you make determine where it goes."

"Myst" games had typically used <a href="chroma%20key">chroma key</a> to insert footage of actors into digital backgrounds. The models of "End of Ages"s characters were instead computer-generated, but Cyan did not want to lose the warmth and feeling provided by using a live actor. Instead Cyan developed a device mounted to the actors' faces that captured video of the actors while they spoke their lines. The video was then manipulated and used as a facial texture that was mapped onto the 3D characters, and the facial movement was also <a href="Facial%20motion%20capture">tracked and used to animate</a> the faces of the characters in-game. <a href="Motion%20capture">Motion capture</a> of the body was also used to ensure lifelike movement. Cyan staff were worried that the audio synching for animation would not be finished in time for the E3 unveiling of the game, but were happy with the end results. Critical reaction to game previews and impressions at E3 was highly positive. Miller was relieved, stating that when the mostly <a href="shooter%20game">shooter game</a>-dominated showcase declared that "End of Ages" might be the best game in the series, "That feels good".

Composer <a href="Tim%20Larkin">Tim Larkin</a>, a sound designer and audio director at Cyan who had previously worked on "<a href="realMyst">realMyst</a>" and "", was given the task of developing "Myst V"s musical score. Larkin stated that whereas earlier "Myst" games had been constrained by technological limitations, the available technology allowed "End of Ages" to have a more dynamic environment, with the music changing with various timings of different sound effects. <a href="Surround%20sound">Surround sound</a> provided a more realistic and immersive gameplay experience. A major challenge in writing the music was that the score had to be flexible enough to match the non-linear gameplay events. "Games are totally interactive experiences," Larkin explained. "You don't guide a player through, since you can't count on being at a certain place at a certain time. I can't write cue music to get the player to do this, this and then this. One player might hear the cue and run the other way!" Larkin had to step away from what he had learned as a jazz composer and musician writing pieces with a definite beginning and end, instead creating music with "less arc" and structure. Larkin admitted that some "Myst" fans would have preferred a musical style similar to Robyn Miller's scores for "Myst" and "Riven", but replied by saying that change happens and players would find something to like in the new music if they kept an open mind.

Due to a tight budget, Larkin was unable to hire an orchestra to perform the music; all the instruments in the soundtrack aside from Larkin's own trumpet playing are sampled instruments. Larkin used a variety of synthesizers, samplers, and computers to create the score, working at his home studio and Cyan's offices. Larkin found that the biggest challenge with the score was finishing it on time for the game to ship. The soundtrack was released in CD format on October 25, 2005.
<a href="Cyan%20Worlds">Cyan Worlds</a> is no longer using <a href="Havok%20%28software%29">Havok</a> (because Havok does not have a Mac-compatible library, the reason why could not be ported to the Mac) but is instead using an open-source cross-platform physics library called <a href="Open%20Dynamics%20Engine">Open Dynamics Engine</a> (ODE) to ensure Mac and PC compatibility.

"End of Ages" was packaged in two different retail versions for release in September 2005, to coincide with the 12th anniversary of the franchise's debut. A standard edition, containing only the game, was released for Windows-based PCs in a CD-ROM format. The limited edition contained the original soundtrack, a collector's <a href="lithograph">lithograph</a>, strategy guide, and a bonus DVD with a "making of" retrospective on the "Myst" franchise. The video was made by <a href="GameTap">GameTap</a>, a subsidiary of <a href="Turner%20Broadcasting%20System">Turner Broadcasting System</a>; the behind-the-scenes feature was the first game-related documentary developed by Turner. The limited edition was shipped on hybrid Mac OS X/Windows DVDs, with Macintosh conversion provided by Quebec-based developer Beenox; this was the only commercial option for Macintosh players.

Shortly before "End of Ages" was released, Cyan announced the layoff of most of the staff and that the company would be ceasing software development. The reason for the sudden closure was a failure to gain financial backing for a new project after "End of Ages"s development. Part of the blame for the company's financial troubles were placed on the commercial disappointment of "". The company was, according to <a href="Rand%20Miller">Rand Miller</a>, "able to pull a rabbit out of a hat" and rehire "almost all" the employees a few weeks later after backing for a new project was secured. With the release of "End of Ages", Cyan stated that their next game would have nothing to do with the "Myst" series. While pitching an unnamed online game to publishers, Cyan produced "" with online content site Fanista.

Overall, "End of Ages" was well received by critics. The game was judged a fitting end to the series, and in combination with the other games in the series sold more than 12 million copies by November 2007. It placed sixth for the week of October 9 on <a href="The%20NPD%20Group">NPD Techworld</a>'s sales rankings.

As with previous games, the visuals of "End of Ages" were widely praised. The switch to real-time rendering was generally seen as a positive step. The game's music was lauded; GameSpot's review noted the use of music in "End of Ages" was sparse, but the little audio present set the proper tone for different Ages. A few reviewers, such as <a href="Charles%20Herold">Charles Herold</a> of the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>", felt that the graphics fell short of what was possible, especially compared to the prerendered visuals of "Myst IV: Revelation". While <a href="Greg%20Kasavin">Greg Kasavin</a> of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> felt that though the visuals were on par with previous games, "End of Ages" was missing several elements which made "Myst IV" more immersive; only important, story-driving items could be interacted with, for example, and the player makes no sounds or footsteps in the game.

The characters of "Myst", occasionally ridiculed in previous games, were well received in "End of Ages". Publications such as <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> and <a href="IGN">IGN</a> praised the voice acting and the switch to character models; Jaun Castro of IGN stated that though the player could not interact directly with the characters, the rendered characters wound up "feeling more genuine and real" than in previous games, speaking with genuine conviction and animation. Special praise was given to David Ogden Stiers for bringing Esher to life. A dissenting opinion was presented by reviewer Mark Saltzman, who thought that players might become bored by the "overly dramatic" character dialogue.

Critics warmly received the addition of the slate and its related puzzles. Oliver Clare of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> called the slate system a welcome addition to the "Myst" formula, although he felt that the recognition of symbols was occasionally too precise. Paul Presley of "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" felt that the slate concept could have been explored further, while GameSpot enjoyed the environmental effects created by the slates. "End of Ages" won several awards upon release, including IGN's "editor's choice". Larkin's music was nominated under the "Best Interactive Score" category at the 2006 Game Audio Network Guild Awards, and won the 2006 Game Industry News award for best soundtrack. It was a nominee for <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s 2005 "Best Adventure Game" award and IGN's prize for the year's top computer adventure game, but lost both categories to "<a href="Fahrenheit%20%282005%20video%20game%29">Fahrenheit</a>".

Operation Barras

Operation Barras was a <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> operation that took place in <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a> on 10 September 2000, during the late stages of that nation's <a href="Sierra%20Leone%20Civil%20War">civil war</a>. The operation aimed to release five British soldiers of the <a href="Royal%20Irish%20Regiment%20%281992%29">Royal Irish Regiment</a> and their <a href="Sierra%20Leone%20Army">Sierra Leone Army</a> liaison officer, who were being held by a militia group known as the "<a href="West%20Side%20Boys">West Side Boys</a>". The soldiers were part of a patrol that was returning from a visit to <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>ian <a href="United%20Nations%20peacekeeping">peacekeepers</a> attached to the <a href="United%20Nations%20Mission%20in%20Sierra%20Leone">United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone</a> (UNAMSIL) at <a href="Masiaka">Masiaka</a> on 25 August 2000 when they turned off the main road and down a track towards the village of <a href="Magbeni">Magbeni</a>. There the patrol was overwhelmed by a large number of heavily armed rebels, taken prisoner, and transported to Gberi Bana on the opposite side of <a href="Rokel%20River">Rokel Creek</a>.

The British Army negotiated the release of six men, but were unable to gain the freedom of their <a href="Sierra%20Leone%20Army">Sierra Leone Army</a> liaison officer and the other men before the West Side Boys' demands became increasingly unrealistic. Negotiators concluded that these were delaying tactics rather than an effort to resolve the crisis; by 9 September, the soldiers had been held for over a fortnight. Fearing that the soldiers would be killed or moved to a location from which it would be more difficult to extract them, the British government authorised an assault on the West Side Boys' base, to take place at dawn the following day, 10 September.

The ground operation was conducted by D Squadron, 22 Regiment <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a>—who assaulted Gberi Bana in a bid to extract the Royal Irish—and elements of <a href="1st%20Battalion%2C%20Parachute%20Regiment">1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment</a> (1 PARA), who launched a diversionary assault on Magbeni. The operation freed the five soldiers as well as twenty-one Sierra Leonean civilians who had been held prisoner by the West Side Boys. At least twenty-five West Side Boys were killed in the assault, as was one British soldier, while eighteen West Side Boys—including the gang's leader, Foday Kallay—were taken prisoner and later transferred to the custody of the <a href="Sierra%20Leone%20Police">Sierra Leone Police</a>. Many West Side Boys fled the area during the assault, and over 300 surrendered to UNAMSIL forces within a fortnight.

The operation restored confidence in the British forces operating in Sierra Leone, which had been undermined by the capture of the Royal Irish patrol. After the operation, the British government increased its support of UNAMSIL and its efforts to bring the civil war to an end, both politically, through the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a>, and through the provision of staff officers to support UNAMSIL. The successful use of 1 PARA in Operation Barras influenced the creation of the <a href="Special%20Forces%20Support%20Group">Special Forces Support Group</a>—a permanent unit, initially built around 1 PARA, whose role is to act as a force multiplier for British special forces on large or complex operations.

<a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a> is a former <a href="History%20of%20Sierra%20Leone%23Colonial%20era%20%281808%E2%80%931961%29">British colony</a> in <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>, close to the equator, with an area of —similar in size to South Carolina or Scotland. By 2000, the country had been consumed by <a href="Sierra%20Leone%20Civil%20War">a civil war</a> which had begun in 1991. The <a href="West%20Side%20Boys">West Side Boys</a> were a militia group who had been involved in the civil war. They were initially loyal to the <a href="Revolutionary%20United%20Front">Revolutionary United Front</a> (RUF), the rebel army opposing the government; they later fought for the government, against the RUF, and were involved in at least one operation directed by British officers in exchange for weapons and medical supplies. But the West Side Boys refused to integrate into the reconstituted Sierra Leone Army and began operating as bandits from the abandoned villages of <a href="Magbeni">Magbeni</a> and Gberi Bana, on opposite sides of <a href="Rokel%20River">Rokel Creek</a>.

British forces were deployed to Sierra Leone in May 2000, initially for a non-combatant evacuation operation under the codename <a href="Operation%20Palliser">Operation Palliser</a>, in which they were tasked with evacuating foreign nationals—particularly those from the United Kingdom, other <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> countries, and others for whom the British government had accepted consular responsibility. As part of the mission, British forces secured Sierra Leone's main airport, Lungi. Having secured Freetown and Lungi, and evacuated the foreign nationals who wished to leave, the initial forces left and were replaced by a "Short Term Training Team" (STTT), whose mission was to train and rebuild the Sierra Leone Army. The STTT was initially formed from a detachment from 2nd Battalion, The <a href="Royal%20Anglian%20Regiment">Royal Anglian Regiment</a>, who were replaced in July 2000 by 1st Battalion, <a href="Royal%20Irish%20Regiment%20%281992%29">The Royal Irish Regiment</a> (1 R IRISH).

The <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> (SAS) is a corps of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> and part of the United Kingdom's <a href="special%20forces">special forces</a>. It consists of three regiments, of which two are drawn from the <a href="Territorial%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a> and one regular regiment—22 Regiment, which was involved in Operation Barras. The SAS was formed by Colonel <a href="David%20Stirling">David Stirling</a> in Africa in 1941, at the height of the Second World War's <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North African Campaign</a>. Its original role was to penetrate enemy lines and strike at airfields and supply lines deep in enemy territory, first in North Africa and later around the Mediterranean and in occupied Europe. Stirling established the principle of using small teams—having realised that small, well-trained teams could sometimes prove much more effective than a unit of hundreds of soldiers. The SAS first entered the public eye after Operation Nimrod, the operation to end the <a href="Iranian%20Embassy%20siege">Iranian Embassy siege</a> in 1980.

The <a href="1st%20Battalion%2C%20Parachute%20Regiment">1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment</a> (1 PARA) is part of the British Army's infantry and, as in the SAS, applicants must undergo an additional level of scrutiny in order to be accepted. Unlike in the SAS, new recruits to the army can apply to join the Parachute Regiment directly from the <a href="Infantry%20Training%20Centre%20%28British%20Army%29">Infantry Training Centre</a> at Catterick in Yorkshire (in the case of soldiers) or the <a href="Royal%20Military%20Academy%2C%20Sandhurst">Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst</a> (for officers). The regiment, whose personnel are commonly known as "paras", specialises in parachute and other types of airborne insertion, and has close ties to the SAS, providing more of its personnel than any other regiment.

On 25 August 2000, a patrol led by Major Allan Marshall consisting of 11 men from the 1 R IRISH & an official from the <a href="Republic%20of%20Sierra%20Leone%20Armed%20Forces">Sierra Leone Army</a> acting as interpreter, Lieutenant Musa Bangura, left their base in <a href="Waterloo%2C%20Sierra%20Leone">Waterloo</a> to visit Jordanian peacekeepers attached to the <a href="United%20Nations%20Mission%20in%20Sierra%20Leone">United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone</a> (UNAMSIL) and based at <a href="Masiaka">Masiaka</a>. Over lunch, they were informed that the West Side Boys had begun to disarm, despite their initial reluctance, and Marshall decided to take the patrol to investigate en route back to their base. The patrol turned off the main road onto a dirt track that led to the village of Magbeni, where the West Side Boys were based. As they approached the base, they were surrounded by a large group of West Side Boys, who used an anti-aircraft gun mounted on a <a href="Bedford%20MK">Bedford truck</a> to block the patrol's route. Marshall dismounted his vehicle, then resisted an attempt to grab his rifle and was beaten. He and the rest of the patrol were then forced into canoes at the bank of Rokel Creak and transported to Gberi Bana, a village on the other side of the river, just upstream from the point of the initial confrontation.

British forces in Sierra Leone were operating on the authority of the Sierra Leone government, but President <a href="Ahmad%20Kabbah">Ahmad Kabbah</a> allowed British forces to negotiate for the soldiers' release themselves, as his government lacked the requisite expertise. The negotiations were led by Lieutenant Colonel Simon Fordham, commanding officer of 1 R IRISH, who was assisted by a small team which included hostage negotiators from the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police">Metropolitan Police</a>. The West Side Boys would not allow negotiators any closer to the village of Magbeni than the end of the track from the main road, so Fordham met there with the self-styled "Brigadier" Foday Kallay, the gang's leader, to negotiate for the soldiers' release. On 29 August, Fordham demanded proof that the captive soldiers were still alive, and Kallay brought with him to that day's meeting the two officers from the group—Marshall, the company commander, and Captain Flaherty, the regimental signals officer. During the meeting, Flaherty shook hands with Fordham and covertly passed him a sketch map of Gberi Bana which detailed the layout of the village and the building in which the soldiers were being held.

Two days later, on 31 August, five of the eleven hostages were released in exchange for a satellite telephone and medical supplies. The OC of the captured soldiers had originally decided to release the youngest first, but this was changed to the married men last minute. However, out of the married men the West Side Boys wanted two of them to remain due to their signals experience. The released soldiers included the Sergeant Major, two corporals and two <a href="Private_%28rank%29%23United_Kingdom">ranger</a>s. The West Side Boys told the British negotiators that the remaining captured soldiers which included the OC, a Captain, a Sergeant, a Lance Corporal and two Rangers that they would not be released until the gang's remaining demands were met. The released soldiers were flown for debriefing to <a href="RFA%20Sir%20Percivale">RFA "Sir Percivale"</a>, of the <a href="Royal%20Fleet%20Auxiliary">Royal Fleet Auxiliary</a>, off the coast.

After the release of the soldiers, the West Side Boys' spokesman, the self-styled "Colonel Cambodia", used the satellite telephone to contact the <a href="British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> (BBC) for a lengthy interview in which they outlined a series of demands, including a re-negotiation of the <a href="Lom%C3%A9%20Peace%20Accord">Lomé Peace Accord</a> and the release of prisoners held by the Sierra Leone authorities. The BBC had prior warning from the Foreign Office that the interview would take place. "Colonel Cambodia" quickly depleted the batteries in the telephone, but his call to the BBC enabled specialists from the <a href="Royal%20Corps%20of%20Signals">Royal Corps of Signals</a> to determine the exact position of the telephone.

The West Side Boys were unstable, possibly due to prolonged use of cannabis and cocaine, and their behaviour during the crisis was erratic. After their release, the five soldiers described an incident in which Kallay, dissatisfied with their explanation, conducted a mock execution in which he threatened to shoot the soldiers unless they told him why they had entered the West Side Boys' territory. The gang's drug habits also posed a problem for the British negotiators as the cannabis caused them to forget previous discussions and the cocaine made them distrustful.

During the negotiations, the relatives of several of the West Side Boys were brought to the gang's camp to ask them to release the British soldiers. The gang responded that they had nothing against the soldiers, but that holding them had brought attention to their demands—which now included immunity from prosecution, safe passage to the UK to take up university courses, and guaranteed acceptance to the re-formed Sierra Leone Army.

Around the time that the five soldiers were released, two negotiators from the SAS joined Fordham's negotiating team. One of them joined Fordham in several meetings with the West Side Boys, posing as a Royal Irish major in order to provide reconnaissance and gather intelligence in case an assault was required. Shortly after the patrol's capture Surgeon Lieutenant Jon Carty RN, the medical officer on board <a href="HMS%20Argyll%20%28F231%29">HMS "Argyll"</a>—which was operating off the coast—was brought ashore to assess the soldiers, should they be freed, or to provide immediate care in the event of an assault resulting in casualties. "Argyll" also served as a temporary base for two Army Air Corps <a href="Westland%20Lynx">Lynx attack helicopters</a> from <a href="No.%20657%20Squadron%20AAC">No. 657 Squadron</a> which had been flown to Sierra Leone to support any direct action.
As planning for a potential military operation to release the captive soldiers progressed, it became clear that, given the number of West Side Boys and their separation between two locations (Gberi Bana as well as the village of Magbeni; see below), the operation could not be conducted by special forces alone. Thus, the headquarters of 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment (1 PARA) was ordered to assemble an enhanced company group, which would support special forces if such an operation was launched. The battalion's commanding officer selected A Company, led by Major Matthew Lowe, which had been on exercise in Jamaica at the time of the initial British deployment to Sierra Leone. Several members of A Company were new recruits who had only completed basic training two weeks prior. Lowe decided that replacing them with more experienced soldiers would risk undermining the cohesion and morale of the company, but several specialist units from elsewhere in 1 PARA were attached to A Company to bring the company group up to the required strength, including a signals group, snipers, heavy machine gun sections, and a mortar section. The additional firepower was included to maximise the options available to the planners, given that the West Side Boys had a numerical advantage and that additional resources would not be immediately available should the operation run into difficulties.

On 31 August, the company group was ordered to move to <a href="South%20Cerney">South Cerney</a> in Gloucestershire, under the cover story that they were conducting a "readiness to move" exercise. It was only at this point, and after all mobile telephones had been confiscated to ensure operational security, that the entire company was briefed on the operation that was being planned. With the operation becoming more likely to be launched, Lowe and his planning group flew to <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a>, Senegal, on 3 September to continue planning and to study intelligence gathered from SAS patrols operating near the West Side Boys' camp. The British government feared that deployment of forces to Sierra Leone might precipitate an adverse reaction by the West Side Boys against the captive soldiers. They calculated that it would take 14 hours to launch an assault from the United Kingdom should it be required in an emergency, so the remainder of the company group was also moved to Dakar in order to reduce the response time. In order to further reduce the response time, political authority to launch the assault in an emergency was delegated to the British High Commissioner in Freetown, <a href="Alan%20Jones%20%28diplomat%29">Alan Jones</a>, while the military decision was delegated to Brigadier <a href="David%20Richards%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">David Richards</a>, commander of British forces in Sierra Leone. Two days later, a pair of SAS observation teams (one on each side of Rokel Creek) were inserted near the villages by assault boats manned by the <a href="Special%20Boat%20Service">Special Boat Service</a> (SBS)—the Royal Navy's special forces unit. They began monitoring the West Side Boys' movements and gathering intelligence, such as details of weapons, as well as identifying viable landing sites for helicopters.

With the progression of the plans, the enhanced A Company was tasked with planning for an assault on the village of Magbeni, to the south of Rokel Creek, while the SAS would aim to release the captive Royal Irish soldiers by assaulting Gberi Bana, on the north bank. The Magbeni assault had several purposes: to neutralise weapons in the village which could disrupt the SAS operation, to distract the West Side Boys in Magbeni and prevent them from crossing Rokel Creek to interfere with the operation in Gberi Bana, to defeat the West Side Boys and destroy their military capabilities, and to recover the Royal Irish patrol's vehicles.

Several methods of insertion were considered, both for the paras and the special forces personnel, including an overland approach using four-wheel drive vehicles, and a water-borne insertion using the same method by which the SAS observation teams had arrived at their position. The planning group decided that the overland approach would not allow troops to enter the village undetected, largely due to the West Side Boys' roadblocks on the road into the village, and that insertion from Rokel Creek was not feasible for large numbers of troops due to the sandbanks and powerful currents in the river. Thus, it was decided that the insertions would be made from three Royal Air Force <a href="Boeing%20Chinook%20%28UK%20variants%29">Chinook</a> helicopters from <a href="No.%207%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 7 Squadron</a>, which had been in Sierra Leone since the beginning of Operation Palliser.

By 5 September, the British media was openly speculating on the possibility that an operation would be launched to free the remaining soldiers, having picked up on 1 PARA's heightened readiness. The following day, the media was reporting that British forces had arrived in Sierra Leone "as a contingency". The British special forces kept a low profile, as was traditional, and the media interest surrounding 1 PARA allowed D Squadron, 22 SAS to enter Sierra Leone unnoticed.

The enhanced A Company group—approximately 130 troops in total—arrived in the country in several groups and joined the SAS, who had already established a base in <a href="Hastings%2C%20Sierra%20Leone">Hastings</a>, a village 30 miles (50 kilometres) south of Freetown, where several of the paras recognised former colleagues among the troopers from D Squadron. At Hastings, the paras focused on live firing exercises and rehearsed various scenarios in a scale replica of Magbeni which had been constructed at the camp. As well as learning the layout of the village and refining battle technique, the rehearsals allowed the soldiers to acclimatise to the tropical heat, and led commanders to the decision that the paras would go into battle with minimal equipment to reduce the risk of heat exhaustion—excluding weapons and ammunition, they would carry only water and field dressings. Some officers feared that the weight of body armour would increase the risk of heat exhaustion, but commanders hoped that the cooler temperatures of the early morning (when the operation was planned to be launched) would mitigate the effects of the weight, and decided to order its use.

A day after the arrival of the paras, <a href="Director%20Special%20Forces">Director Special Forces</a> (DSF), Brigadier <a href="John%20Holmes%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">John Holmes</a>, arrived in Freetown with a headquarters staff which included the commanding officer of 22 SAS and the officer commanding D Squadron, as well as three personnel from the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>'s <a href="Tactical%20Communications%20Wing%20RAF">Tactical Communications Wing</a>. Holmes based himself at Seaview House, the British military headquarters in Freetown, near the British High Commission. From there, his staff established contact with the SAS observation teams on either side of Rokel Creek and with <a href="Cabinet%20Office%20Briefing%20Room">COBRA</a>, the British government's emergency committee in London. The DSF, who usually attends COBRA meetings during crises which may require the use of special forces, was represented by his chief of staff and by Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Tim%20Collins%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Tim Collins</a>, operations officer at Headquarters Special Forces.

On 9 September, "Colonel Cambodia" stated that the remaining six members of the Royal Irish patrol, who had now been held for over a fortnight, would be released only after a new government was formed in Sierra Leone. The negotiators concluded that the West Side Boys' increasingly unrealistic demands were stalling tactics rather than a serious attempt to conclude the crisis. At around the same time, the SAS teams near the West Side Boys' base reported that they had seen no sign of the captive soldiers during the four days they had been in position. There were also concerns that the West Side Boys might move further inland, and either kill the soldiers or move them to a location from which it would be more difficult for British forces to extract them. The combination of these factors led COBRA to order an assault.

The operation was to commence at first light the next day, 10 September. The intervening time was spent securing the political and legal basis for the raid. Final approval was gained from Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Kabbah, and British Prime Minister <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a>, while the <a href="Army%20Legal%20Corps">Army Legal Corps</a> secured approval from the Sierra Leonean Police. Fordham, who had been leading the negotiations, telephoned the West Side Boys and was able to establish that the captive soldiers were alive, and the final orders were issued in the evening of 9 September.

The two villages were to be assaulted simultaneously—Gberi Bana, where the Royal Irish were held, by the SAS and Magbeni by the paras. In addition to the remaining Royal Irish soldiers, the SAS were also tasked with extracting Lieutenant Musa Bangura—the patrol's SLA liaison, whose extraction was given the same priority as that of the Royal Irish—and a group of Sierra Leonean civilians who were being held by the West Side Boys.

The task force left Hastings—approximately 15 minutes' flying time from the West Side Boys' camp—at approximately 06:15. Downstream from the villages—approximately 15 minutes' flying time, just out of the West Side Boys' visual and hearing range, the helicopters went into a holding pattern to allow the SAS observation teams time to get into position to prevent the West Side Boys from attacking any of the captives before the extraction teams were on the ground. Once the observation teams were in position, the helicopters proceeded up the line of Rokel Creek, the Chinooks flying low enough that the downdraft tore off the corrugated iron roofs of several huts in the villages, including the roof of the building in which the Royal Irish were being held. As the helicopters approached, the SAS observation team at Gberi Bana engaged West Side Boys in the vicinity of the captives to prevent any gang members from attempting to kill them before the area was secured. Upon their arrival, the two Lynx attack helicopters strafed the villages to make the landing zones as safe as possible for the Chinooks and destroy the heavy weapons that had been identified by the SAS observation teams.

After the first sweep by the attack helicopters, two Chinooks carried the SAS to Gberi Bana. The troopers <a href="fast-roping">fast-roped</a> into the village and immediately came under fire from the West Side Boys. Early on in the confrontation, the British operation sustained its first casualty—a round entered Trooper Bradley Tinnion's flank, leaving him seriously injured. He was dragged back to the helicopter and flown to the medical team aboard the RFA "Sir Percivale", dying despite intensive resuscitation attempts on board. The SAS proceeded to clear the village, engaging those West Side Boys who offered resistance and capturing those who surrendered, including Foday Kallay.

The SAS located the captive British soldiers from the latter's shouts of "British Army, British Army!", though Bangura had been held separately and proved more difficult to locate. He was found in a squalid open pit, which had been used by the West Side Boys as a lavatory, and had been starved and beaten during his captivity, and thus had to be carried to the helicopter. Less than 20 minutes after the arrival of the SAS, the remaining members of the Royal Irish patrol, including Bangura, had been evacuated from the area.

As the SAS operation concluded, the Chinooks ferried prisoners and bodies from Gberi Bana to the Jordanian battalion of UNAMSIL. From there, the bodies would be identified and buried, and those prisoners identified as West Side Boys would be handed over to the Sierra Leonean Police. Operation Barras also freed 22 Sierra Leonean civilians who had been held captive by the West Side Boys—the men were used as servants and put through crude military training by the West Side Boys, possibly with the intention of forcing them to fight in the future, while the women were used as sex slaves. Planners had been concerned that West Side Boys might try to conceal themselves among the civilians and so the civilians were also restrained and taken to the Jordanian peacekeepers' base to be identified. A 23rd civilian was caught in the crossfire and killed during the assault.

The third Chinook carried half of the enhanced A Company group from 1 PARA to Magbeni. The helicopter hovered low above the landing zone that had been identified by the second SAS observation team and the paras jumped from the rear ramp. The observation team had warned that the ground was wet but had been unable to determine the depth of the water, so the paras were surprised to find themselves jumping into a chest-deep swamp. The majority of the first group immediately waded through the swamp to get to the nearby tree line and from there to the village, but a small party tasked with securing the landing zone had to wait in the swamp for the Chinook to pick up the remaining members of the company group and return to insert them at the landing zone.

The returning Chinook, carrying the remainder of the A Company group including second-in-command (2IC) Captain Danny Matthews, came under fire from a heavy machine gun in Magbeni, which was promptly strafed by one of the 657 Squadron Lynx helicopters until it ceased firing. The soldiers in Matthews' helicopter exited and joined the first half of the company group on the ground. As the company group moved forward, an explosion—possibly a mortar fired by the British fire support group—injured seven men, including company commander Major Matthew Lowe, one of the platoon commanders, a signaller, and two of Lowe's headquarters staff. Another signaller radioed in a casualty report, and one of the Chinooks en route to Gberi Bana to extract the Royal Irish (who had just been freed by the SAS) landed on the track through the village. The casualties were loaded onto the helicopter, which then picked up the Royal Irish and flew to RFA "Sir Percivale" where all 13 men were assessed by medics.

The operation continued under the leadership of Matthews, the company 2IC, who had taken command almost immediately after the company commander was wounded. Under his command, each of the platoons assaulted a different cluster of buildings to which they had been assigned during training on the replica village at Hastings. The West Side Boys' ammunition store was found and secured and, once the rest of the buildings had been cleared, the paras took up defensive positions to block any potential counter-attack and patrols went into the immediate jungle in search of any West Side Boys hiding in the bushes. The village was completely secure by 08:00 and the paras secured the approaches with <a href="M18%20Claymore%20mine">Claymore mines</a> and mortars positioned to prevent a counter-attack, while a detachment destroyed the remaining vehicles and heavy weapons including the Bedford lorry which had blocked the Royal Irish patrol. The paras also recovered the Royal Irish patrol's <a href="Snatch%20Land%20Rover">Land Rovers</a>, which were slung under the Chinooks and removed. The last British soldiers left the area at approximately 14:00.

The remaining members of the captured patrol were flown to RFA "Sir Percivale". Fordham visited the men shortly after the operation and stated "they looked remarkably well considering the ordeal they had been through" and described them as being "physically and mentally exhausted". After medical checks, the soldiers, who had been held for 17 days, were allowed to telephone their families and then rejoined their battalion in Freetown. The paras were flown to RFA "Argus", where they spent the night before being flown back to the United Kingdom the next day. D Squadron, 22 SAS also left Sierra Leone the day after the operation, along with Director Special Forces and his headquarters staff.

One British soldier, Bradley Tinnion, was killed in the operation. Another twelve soldiers were injured, one seriously. The British <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a> (MoD) did not officially acknowledge the involvement of special forces, issuing a press release which made no mention of the SAS, but when it was made public that Brad Tinnion was a <a href="Lance%20Bombardier">Lance Bombardier</a> originally from <a href="29%20Commando%20Regiment%20Royal%20Artillery">29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery</a>, it became clear to experts that Tinnion had been serving with special forces. Operation Barras was Tinnion's first operational deployment as an SAS trooper.

Also confirmed to have died in the operation were 25 West Side Boys, although the true figure is probably far higher. The gang's resistance was stronger than had been expected and there was speculation that more bodies lay undiscovered in the jungle. Several other West Side Boys were captured, while others fled into the jungle. Many of those who fled later surrendered to Jordanian peacekeepers. The Jordanians had received 30 by the end of the day, and 371—including 57 children—had surrendered within a fortnight of Operation Barras, to which Julius Spencer, Sierra Leone's Minister for Information, declared that the West Side boys were "finished as a military threat". Some of those who surrendered went on to volunteer for the new Sierra Leone Army and those who were accepted went into the British-run training programme. Kallay, the gang's leader, recorded a message for broadcast on Sierra Leonean radio urging the remaining West Side Boys to surrender to UNAMSIL. He also identified the bodies of West Side Boys killed in Magbeni and Gberi Bana, which were subsequently buried in a mass grave.

The morning of the operation, General Sir <a href="Charles%20Guthrie%2C%20Baron%20Guthrie%20of%20Craigiebank">Charles Guthrie</a>, <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the Defence Staff</a> (CDS)—the professional head of the British Armed Forces—was coincidentally due to appear on "<a href="Breakfast%20with%20Frost">Breakfast with Frost</a>", a Sunday morning political television programme hosted by <a href="David%20Frost">Sir David Frost</a>. The first public knowledge of Operation Barras came from Guthrie's interview with Frost, which took place while the operation was still concluding. Guthrie told Frost "[W]e didn't want to have to assault, because it's a very difficult operation, there are big risks in it but we have done it [...] because our negotiations were getting nowhere. The hostages had been there for three weeks, they [the West Side Boys] were threatening to kill them, or they were threatening to move them to other parts of Sierra Leone and once they'd done that we'd never be able to recover [the soldiers] with ease, which I hope we've done this morning". The MoD issued a press release with more details later in the day.
Several decorations were awarded to the personnel who took part in Operation Barras, including two <a href="Conspicuous%20Gallantry%20Cross">Conspicuous Gallantry Cross</a>es, five <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>es (one of which was awarded to Matthews, who took command of the operation in Magbeni after the officer commanding was injured), and five <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>es. Holmes (Director Special Forces) was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his part in the operation. Tinnion received a posthumous <a href="Mention%20in%20Despatches">Mention in Despatches</a>.

Marshall was later transferred to another regiment at his own request, while two of the soldiers on the patrol subsequently left the army and another two transferred to "<a href="Royal_Irish_Regiment_%281992%29%23Northern_Ireland_Resident_Battalions_.28Home_Service.29">Home Service</a>" units (those based permanently in Northern Ireland).

The capture of the Royal Irish patrol had undermined the confidence of the Sierra Leonean population in the British operation, which they hoped would help to bring an end to the country's civil war, and embarrassed the British government, which had been critical of similar previous incidents involving UNAMSIL personnel. Operation Barras restored confidence in the British forces, prompting military historian William Fowler to call the operation "a necessarily spectacular endorsement of the rule of law and the elected government of Sierra Leone".

The British media struck a celebratory note at the success of Operation Barras, but some suggested that Marshall had erred in diverting the patrol off the main road to visit the West Side Boys. Both Marshall and Bangura—the patrol's Sierra Leone Army liaison—were adamant that the patrol had been asked by the Jordanian peacekeepers serving with UNAMSIL to, in Bangura's words, "take a closer look". However, the commander of UNAMSIL—General <a href="Mohamed%20Garba">Mohamed Garba</a> of Nigeria—initially denied that the Royal Irish had met the Jordanians and both UNAMSIL HQ and the Jordanian commanding officer denied that the patrol were asked to investigate the West Side Boys' camp. An investigation into the capture of the patrol was launched by <a href="Commander%20Field%20Army">Land Command</a> and a senior officer was despatched to Freetown to debrief the members of the patrol. The report was critical of Marshall, stating that he "made an error of professional judgement in diverting from a planned and authorised journey to make an unauthorised visit to the village of Magbeni."

The risks of Operation Barras were acknowledged by the MoD and by officers involved in the planning and the assault. It was described by an SAS soldier as "not a clinical, black balaclava, <a href="Iranian%20Embassy%20siege">Princes Gate</a> type operation. It was a very grubby, green operation with lots of potential for things to go wrong". Richard Connaughton observed in the journal "Small Wars & Insurgencies" that the operation showed that Tony Blair's government was not averse to the possibility of casualties where they felt the cause was just. <a href="Geoff%20Hoon">Geoff Hoon</a>, British <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Defence">Secretary of State for Defence</a>, summed up the effect of the operation at a press conference, stating that "[Operation Barras] sends a number of powerful messages. Firstly, it is a yet further demonstration of the refusal of successive British governments to do deals with terrorists and hostage takers. Secondly, we hope the West Side Group [sic] and other rebel units in Sierra Leone will now [...] accept the rule of law and the authority of the democratically elected government of Sierra Leone. Thirdly, we hope all those who may in future consider taking similar actions against UK armed forces will think carefully about the possible consequences and realise there is nothing to be gained by such action". Andrew M. Dorman of <a href="King%27s%20College%20London">King's College London</a> suggested that the fate of the wider British operation in Sierra Leone depended heavily on the success or failure of Operation Barras and that, had the British forces been defeated, the United Kingdom would have been forced to withdraw all its forces from Sierra Leone. Dorman also suggests that a defeat would have "raised questions" regarding Tony Blair's policy of using armed force for humanitarian intervention.

The success of Operation Barras was a factor in the decision to form the <a href="Special%20Forces%20Support%20Group">Special Forces Support Group</a> (SFSG), a permanent unit whose role is to act as a force multiplier for British special forces on large or complex operations. The SFSG was formed in 2006 from an infantry battalion—originally 1 PARA, which was the first battalion to serve in the role—with supporting elements from the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> and <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force%20Regiment">Royal Air Force Regiment</a>. The SFSG went on to support special forces operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The capture of the Royal Irish patrol and the effectiveness of the operation to free them prompted the British government to increase its support of UNAMSIL, both politically and through the provision of staff officers to assist UNAMSIL's operational headquarters (though not with a significant contribution of peacekeepers, despite considerable lobbying). The British also applied political pressure through the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a> on the <a href="Revolutionary%20United%20Front">Revolutionary United Front</a> (RUF)—the second main party to the civil war after the government—and on Sierra Leone's neighbour <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>, which had provided support to the RUF. The new approach, combined with a larger and more powerful UNAMSIL, hastened the demobilisation of the RUF and thus the end of the Sierra Leone Civil War.

Carolwood Pacific Railroad

The Carolwood Pacific Railroad (CPRR) was a -inch () gauge <a href="ridable%20miniature%20railroad">ridable miniature railroad</a> run by <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a> in the backyard of his home in the <a href="Holmby%20Hills%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Holmby Hills</a> neighborhood of <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles, California</a>. It featured the "Lilly Belle", a 1:8-<a href="rail%20transport%20modelling%20scales">scale</a> <a href="live%20steam">live steam</a> <a href="locomotive">locomotive</a> named after Disney's wife, <a href="Lillian%20Disney">Lillian Disney</a>, and built by the <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Studios%20%28Burbank%29">Walt Disney Studios'</a> <a href="machine%20shop">machine shop</a>. The locomotive made its first test run on December 24, 1949. It pulled a set of freight cars, as well as a <a href="caboose">caboose</a> that was almost entirely built by Disney himself. It was Disney's lifelong fascination with trains, as well as his interest in <a href="miniature%20models">miniature models</a>, that led to the creation of the CPRR. The railroad, which became operational in 1950, was long and encircled his house. The <a href="backyard%20railroad">backyard railroad</a> attracted visitors to Disney's home; he invited them to ride and occasionally drive his miniature train. In 1953, after an accident occurred in which a guest was injured, the CPRR was closed to the public.

The Carolwood Pacific Railroad inspired Disney to include railroad attractions in the design for the <a href="Disneyland">Disneyland</a> theme park in <a href="Anaheim%2C%20California">Anaheim, California</a>. <a href="Rail%20transport%20in%20Walt%20Disney%20Parks%20and%20Resorts">Railroad attractions in Disney theme parks</a> around the world are now commonplace. The barn structure that was used as the railroad's control center is now at the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Live%20Steamers%20Railroad%20Museum">Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum</a> in Los Angeles' <a href="Griffith%20Park">Griffith Park</a>. The "Lilly Belle", some of the freight cars, and the caboose are now on display at the <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Family%20Museum">Walt Disney Family Museum</a> in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, California.

<a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a>, the owner of the Carolwood Pacific Railroad, was a <a href="rail%20enthusiast">rail enthusiast</a>. As a young boy, he wanted to become a <a href="train%20engineer">train engineer</a> like his father's cousin, Mike Martin, who drove <a href="main%20line%20%28railway%29">main-line</a> trains on the <a href="Atchison%2C%20Topeka%20and%20Santa%20Fe%20Railway">Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway</a>. <a href="Elias%20Disney">Disney's father</a> worked as part of a track installation crew for the <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railroad">Union Pacific Railroad</a>. As a teenager, Disney worked as a <a href="news%20butcher">news butcher</a> on the <a href="Missouri%20Pacific%20Railway">Missouri Pacific Railway</a>, where he sold newspapers, candy, cigars, and other products on trains. He sometimes climbed over the <a href="tender%20%28rail%29">tender</a> and into the locomotive's <a href="cab%20%28locomotive%29">cab</a> while the train was in motion. After he bribed the engineer and <a href="Fireman%20%28steam%20engine%29">fireman</a> with <a href="chewing%20tobacco">chewing tobacco</a>, they showed him how to operate the locomotive. 

Disney renewed his interest in trains after injuries forced him to stop playing <a href="polo">polo</a>. Seeking a calmer recreational activity, he purchased several <a href="Lionel%20Corporation">Lionel</a> train sets in late 1947. By 1948, his interest in model trains was evolving into an interest in larger, ridable miniature trains after observing the trains and backyard railroad layouts of several hobbyists. These hobbyists included Disney animator <a href="Ollie%20Johnston">Ollie Johnston</a>, who had a ridable miniature railroad, as well as Disney animator <a href="Ward%20Kimball">Ward Kimball</a>, who owned the full-size, <a href="narrow-gauge%20railway">narrow-gauge</a> <a href="Grizzly%20Flats%20Railroad">Grizzly Flats Railroad</a>. 

On June 1, 1949, Disney purchased of vacant land in the Holmby Hills area of Los Angeles. The property consisted of a bluff, which was in size, and a level shelf of land behind it, which Disney named "Yensid Valley". The word "Yensid" is "Disney" spelled backwards. Disney purchased this land to build a new family home with an elaborate backyard railroad behind it. Plans for the railroad's layout included of -inch () gauge track with eleven <a href="railroad%20switch">switches</a>, as well as <a href="ruling%20gradient">gradients</a>, <a href="overpass">overpass</a>es, a <a href="trestle">trestle</a>, and an <a href="embankment%20%28transportation%29">elevated dirt berm</a>. The layout would completely surround the house. Disney's wife, Lillian Disney, objected to the plan that part of the layout be built in an area where she intended to plant a flower garden. As a compromise, Disney had an <a href="Reverse%20curve">S-curve</a> <a href="tunnel">tunnel</a> built underneath the spot where the garden was eventually planted. Aided by a Walt Disney Studios attorney, Disney had a <a href="tongue-in-cheek">tongue-in-cheek</a> legal contract written to establish his right to own and operate the railroad's <a href="right%20of%20way">right of way</a>. He and his wife signed the contract and their two daughters witnessed it. Disney named his railroad "Carolwood Pacific Railroad" (CPRR) in reference to his address at 355 Carolwood Drive. The railroad eventually cost $50,000, split evenly between its layout and <a href="rolling%20stock">rolling stock</a>.
The railroad featured the "Lilly Belle", a 1:8-scale live steam locomotive named after Disney's wife and built by the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop team led by <a href="Roger%20E.%20Broggie">Roger E. Broggie</a>. The locomotive's design, chosen by Disney after seeing a smaller locomotive model with the same design at the home of rail historian <a href="Gerald%20M.%20Best">Gerald M. Best</a>, was based directly on copies of the <a href="blueprint">blueprint</a>s for the <a href="Central%20Pacific%20173">Central Pacific No. 173</a>, a <a href="4-4-0">4-4-0</a> <a href="steam%20locomotive">steam locomotive</a> rebuilt by the <a href="Central%20Pacific%20Railroad">Central Pacific Railroad</a> in 1872. The initials for the Carolwood Pacific Railroad, "CPRR", matched the initials for the Central Pacific Railroad, one of the railroads that helped complete the <a href="First%20Transcontinental%20Railroad">First Transcontinental Railroad</a> in 1869. Under Broggie's guidance, Disney helped build several parts for the "Lilly Belle", including its <a href="smokestack">smokestack</a> and <a href="headlamp">headlamp</a>. Most of the <a href="machining">machining</a> was done by Broggie's machine shop team, and the wooden cab was built by Disney personally. On December 24, 1949, the "Lilly Belle" and its tender were first test run on a small loop of track during the studio's Christmas party in front of the staff. The tender could carry up to of water and of coal crushed to scale-sized lumps to fuel the locomotive. Disney ran the "Lilly Belle" on the Carolwood Pacific Railroad for the first time on May 7, 1950.

The CPRR's train cars consisted of six <a href="casting%20%28metalworking%29">cast-metal</a>, <a href="wood-grain">wood-grain</a>-patterned <a href="gondola%20%28rail%29">gondolas</a> made by the studio's machine shop. There were also two <a href="boxcar">boxcar</a>s, two <a href="stock%20car%20%28rail%29">stock cars</a>, a <a href="flatcar">flatcar</a>, and a <a href="caboose">caboose</a> made of wood from the studio's prop shop. Disney's fascination with miniature models was apparent from the level of detail he applied to the miniature interior of the caboose, which included a calendar hung on the wall, a broom, and a working <a href="potbelly%20stove">potbelly stove</a>. Except for its frame and <a href="bogie">trucks</a>, Disney built the entire caboose himself. All of the train cars, except for the caboose, were stored in the CPRR's tunnel when not in use.

The CPRR's caboose was stored in a special barn where Disney monitored and controlled the CPRR's track. The barn's design was based on a set piece for the 1949 Disney film "<a href="So%20Dear%20to%20My%20Heart">So Dear to My Heart</a>", and it brought back Disney's childhood memories of a similar barn on his family farm in <a href="Marceline%2C%20Missouri">Marceline, Missouri</a>. The barn had a <a href="centralized%20traffic%20control">centralized traffic control</a> board, which had several lights designed to indicate the presence of trains along the railroad's route. The CPRR's switches could also be electrically controlled from this board.

Articles about the CPRR appeared in several magazines, including the September 1951 issue of <a href="Look%20%28American%20magazine%29">"Look" magazine</a>. These articles attracted visitors interested in the CPRR to the home of Disney, who invited them to ride and occasionally drive his miniature train. With a <a href="tractive%20effort">tractive effort</a> of more than , the "Lilly Belle" could pull a train with up to 12 adult passengers. Due to its lack of <a href="railway%20brake">brakes</a>, the locomotive was set in reverse if it ever needed to stop quickly. In early 1953, a visitor drove the "Lilly Belle" too fast along a curve, causing it to <a href="derailment">derail</a>. As a result, the "Lilly Belle" fell on its side, broke its <a href="train%20whistle">whistle</a>, and released a jet of steam across the ground. A five-year-old girl ran through the steam jet, which left minor burns on her legs. As a result of this incident, Disney, fearing the possibility of future accidents, closed down the CPRR and stored the locomotive in the studio's machine shop. Disney removed the Carolwood Pacific Railroad's track in 1964.

Walt Disney credited the Carolwood Pacific Railroad with inspiring the creation of <a href="Disneyland">Disneyland</a> in <a href="Anaheim%2C%20California">Anaheim, California</a>. In one early concept for the park, the CPRR was included as an attraction, in which its train would carry passengers past miniature towns and settings. The <a href="Casey%20Jr.%20Circus%20Train">Casey Jr. Circus Train</a>, a different ridable miniature railroad that travels past miniature scenes of animated Disney films, is one of Disneyland's original attractions. Another early design for the park included a narrow-gauge steam railroad encircling it, a feature which was retained in the park's final design. Disneyland, and the <a href="Disneyland%20Railroad">Disneyland Railroad</a> encircling the park, opened on July 17, 1955. The Disneyland Railroad's No. 1 locomotive, the "C.K. Holliday", bears a strong resemblance to the CPRR's "Lilly Belle", since their designs were based on the same blueprints. There are also steam railroads in the <a href="Magic%20Kingdom">Magic Kingdom</a> at <a href="Walt%20Disney%20World">Walt Disney World</a> near <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando, Florida</a>; <a href="Tokyo%20Disneyland">Tokyo Disneyland</a> in Japan; and <a href="Disneyland%20Park%20%28Paris%29">Disneyland Park</a> near <a href="Paris">Paris</a>.

Copies of the blueprints for the CPRR's Lilly Belle were sold to model railroad hobbyists through a company named "Walt Disney Miniature Railroad", formed by Disney in 1950 as a legally separate entity from Walt Disney Productions. After that company evolved into Walt Disney, Inc., in 1952 and had its name changed to <a href="Retlaw%20Enterprises">WED Enterprises</a> in 1953, it developed rides and attractions for Disneyland and later Walt Disney World. In 1965, Walt Disney Productions purchased WED Enterprises, and in 1986 changed its name to <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Imagineering">Walt Disney Imagineering</a>. According to <a href="Los%20Angeles%20%28magazine%29">"Los Angeles" magazine</a>, the CPRR's barn has been referred to as the "birthplace of Imagineering".

As well as inspiring rail attractions at Disney theme parks, the CPRR became the inspiration for the 1951 Disney animated short film "Out of Scale", in which <a href="Donald%20Duck">Donald Duck</a> is portrayed running a ridable miniature railroad in his backyard. The train of the CPRR also appeared in several Disney television specials in the 1950s.

In 1965, Walt Disney donated of the Carolwood Pacific Railroad's track, as well as the railroad's trestle, to the Los Angeles Live Steamers, a group of miniature steam train enthusiasts. Disney was a charter member of that group. The completion of the CPRR's track installation at the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum in Los Angeles' <a href="Griffith%20Park">Griffith Park</a> was celebrated on October 22, 1966, and the route utilizing that track became known as the "Disney Loop". This event occurred a few weeks before Disney's death on December 15, 1966. In 1968, Lillian Disney donated the rest of the CPRR's track to the Los Angeles Live Steamers. The original CPRR track on the Disney Loop has since been removed and replaced with newer, more durable track.

After Lillian Disney died in 1997, the Disney residence, including the area where the CPRR was located, was put up for sale. Mexican investor Gabriel Brener, who bought the property in 1998, demolished the original house due to issues with <a href="lead%20paint">lead paint</a>, lead piping, <a href="asbestos">asbestos</a>, and a weak <a href="foundation%20%28engineering%29">foundation</a>. The CPRR's tunnel was still in place in 2013. In 2014, the property was sold to an unknown buyer.

In 1999, Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn, the CPRR's former control center, was relocated to the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum. <a href="Morgan%20%26quot%3BBill%26quot%3B%20Evans">Morgan "Bill" Evans</a>, the original landscaper of the Disney residence and several Disney theme parks, arranged for Walt Disney Imagineering to provide a landscaping plan for the barn's new site. On July 19, 1999, <a href="Diane%20Disney%20Miller">Diane Disney Miller</a>, Disney's daughter, participated in the rededication ceremony for the barn.

Since 2009, the CPRR's "Lilly Belle", some of the freight cars, and the caboose have been on display at the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco, California. There are also two pieces of CPRR rolling stock on display inside the Carolwood Pacific Railroad Room in the Boulder Ridge Villas at <a href="Disney%27s%20Wilderness%20Lodge">Disney's Wilderness Lodge</a> within Walt Disney World.

Ferugliotheriidae

Ferugliotheriidae is one of three known <a href="family%20%28biology%29">families</a> in the <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> <a href="Gondwanatheria">Gondwanatheria</a>, an enigmatic group of <a href="extinction">extinct</a> <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s. Gondwanatheres have been classified as a group of uncertain affinities or as members of <a href="Multituberculata">Multituberculata</a>, a major extinct mammalian order. The best-known representative of Ferugliotheriidae is the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Ferugliotherium">Ferugliotherium</a>" from the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> epoch in <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. A second genus, "<a href="Trapalcotherium">Trapalcotherium</a>", is known from a single tooth, a first lower <a href="wikt%3Amolariform">molariform</a> (<a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a>-like tooth), from a different Late Cretaceous Argentinean locality. Another genus known from a single tooth (in this case, a fourth lower <a href="premolar">premolar</a>), "<a href="Argentodites">Argentodites</a>", was first described as an unrelated multituberculate, but later identified as possibly related to "Ferugliotherium". Finally, a single tooth from the <a href="Paleogene">Paleogene</a> of <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, <a href="LACM%20149371">LACM 149371</a>, perhaps a last upper molariform, and a recent specimen from <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, may represent related animals.

Ferugliotheriids are known from isolated, low-crowned (<a href="brachydont">brachydont</a>) teeth and possibly a fragment of a lower jaw. "Ferugliotherium" is estimated to have weighed 70 g (2.5 oz). The <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s are long and <a href="wikt%3Aprocumbent">procumbent</a> and contain a band of <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a> on only part of the tooth. The jaw fragment contains a long tooth socket for the incisor and bears a bladelike fourth lower premolar, resembling those of multituberculates. The premolar of "Argentodites" is similar. Two upper premolars also resemble multituberculate teeth, but whether these premolars are referable to Ferugliotheriidae is controversial. Molariforms are rectangular and brachydont and consist of longitudinal rows of <a href="cusp%20%28dentistry%29">cusps</a>, connected by transverse crests and separated by transverse furrows. Lower molariforms have two cusp rows, and the single known putative upper molariform has three. Low-crowned and bladelike teeth as seen in ferugliotheriids may have been evolutionary precursors of the high-crowned (<a href="hypsodont">hypsodont</a>) teeth of the other gondwanathere family, <a href="Sudamericidae">Sudamericidae</a>.

Most ferugliotheriids come from the Late Cretaceous epoch (<a href="Campanian">Campanian</a>–<a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> ages, 84–66 million years ago, or mya) of Argentina, where they may have lived in a <a href="marsh">marsh</a>y or seashore environment. They coexisted with mammals such as <a href="dryolestoid">dryolestoid</a>s and a variety of other animals, including dinosaurs. Ferugliotheriids may have been <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>s or <a href="omnivore">omnivore</a>s.

The first member of the family Ferugliotheriidae to be discovered, "<a href="Ferugliotherium%20windhauseni">Ferugliotherium windhauseni</a>", was named in 1986 by Argentinean paleontologist <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20F.%20Bonaparte">José F. Bonaparte</a> on the basis of a tooth from the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> <a href="Los%20Alamitos%20Formation">Los Alamitos Formation</a> of Argentina. Bonaparte placed "Ferugliotherium" as the only member of the new family Ferugliotheriidae, which he tentatively assigned to the order <a href="Multituberculata">Multituberculata</a>, a large group of extinct mammals (distinct from both <a href="monotreme">monotreme</a>s and <a href="theria">theria</a>ns, the two major groups of living mammals) that was particularly widespread in the northern continents (<a href="Laurasia">Laurasia</a>), but had never previously been found in the south (<a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>). In 1990, Bonaparte named another species, "Vucetichia gracilis", from Los Alamitos. He placed it in the family Gondwanatheriidae, together with "<a href="Gondwanatherium">Gondwanatherium</a>", another Los Alamitos mammal, within the order <a href="Gondwanatheria">Gondwanatheria</a>, which also contained the family <a href="Sudamericidae">Sudamericidae</a>, then with the single genus "<a href="Sudamerica">Sudamerica</a>". Bonaparte considered the gondwanatheres to be probably most closely related to the <a href="xenarthra">xenarthra</a>ns (sloths, armadillos, and anteaters) within a group called <a href="Paratheria%20%28mammals%29">Paratheria</a>.

Also in 1990, Bonaparte merged the family Gondwanatheriidae into Sudamericidae and, together with <a href="David%20Krause">David Krause</a>, redefined Gondwanatheria as a multituberculate suborder that included both Ferugliotheriidae and Sudamericidae, thus rejecting a relationship between gondwanatheres and xenarthrans. Krause, Bonaparte, and <a href="Zofia%20Kielan-Jaworowska">Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska</a> redescribed "Ferugliotherium" in 1992 and suggested that the teeth that "Vucetichia" was based on may have been worn specimens of "Ferugliotherium". They placed "Ferugliotherium" among multituberculates and suggested that it may be part of the suborder <a href="Plagiaulacoidea">Plagiaulacoidea</a>. The following year, Krause confirmed that "Vucetichia gracilis" is a <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> of "Ferugliotherium windhauseni". Together with Bonaparte, he also proposed to classify gondwanatheres as a superfamily (Gondwanatherioidea) within Plagiaulacoidea, including the families Ferugliotheriidae and Sudamericidae. In 1996, Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte tentatively identified a lower jaw fragment with a multituberculate-like fourth lower <a href="premolar">premolar</a> (p4) from Los Alamitos as "Ferugliotherium". On the basis of the morphological features of the jaw fragment, they argued that gondwanatheres are not closely related to any other multituberculate group, and consequently placed them in a suborder of their own, Gondwanatheria.

In 1999, Rosendo Pascual and colleagues described a lower jaw of "Sudamerica", which had previously only been known from isolated teeth. This jaw fragment showed that "Sudamerica" had four molariform teeth on each side of the lower jaws, more than any multituberculate, and consequently they removed gondwanatheres from Multituberculata and regarded their affinities as uncertain. As a consequence, Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues excluded Gondwanatheria from multituberculates, but identified the jaw fragment and a few upper premolars of "Ferugliotherium" as indeterminate multituberculates in a 2001 paper and a 2004 book. However, in 2009 Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck identified these <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s as "Ferugliotherium" and argued in favor of a close relationship between gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotheriidae) and multituberculates.

In the 2000s, additional members of Ferugliotheriidae were described. In 2004, Francisco Goin and colleagues described a single enigmatic tooth from the <a href="Paleogene">Paleogene</a> of Peru, <a href="LACM%20149371">LACM 149371</a>; their best estimate was that it represented a member of Ferugliotheriidae. On the basis of a single p4, Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues named "<a href="Argentodites%20coloniensis">Argentodites coloniensis</a>", from the Late Cretaceous <a href="La%20Colonia%20Formation">La Colonia Formation</a> of Argentina, in 2007 as a multituberculate, possibly referable to the suborder <a href="Cimolodonta">Cimolodonta</a>. Gurovich and Beck argued, however, that the p4 of "Argentodites" did not differ materially from that in the jaw they allocated to "Ferugliotherium", and that "Argentodites" was based on a specimen of either "Ferugliotherium" or a closely related animal. Guillermo Rougier and colleagues described mammals from the <a href="Allen%20Formation">Allen Formation</a>, a third Argentinean formation of similar age, in 2009, including a new ferugliotheriid, "<a href="Trapalcotherium%20matuastensis">Trapalcotherium matuastensis</a>". They also regarded "Argentodites" as a likely relative of "Ferugliotherium" and suggested that Ferugliotheriidae are either multituberculates or closely related to them.

Ferugliotheriids are known from a few dozen isolated teeth and a questionably allocated jaw fragment. Most fossils are referred to "Ferugliotherium"; "Trapalcotherium" and "Argentodites" were each described on the basis of a single tooth. Their precise <a href="dental%20formula">dental formula</a> is unknown, but <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s, premolars, and molariform teeth have been identified. Gurovich suggested that "Ferugliotherium" had one incisor (possibly two in the upper jaw), no <a href="canine%20%28tooth%29">canines</a>, one or two premolars, and two molars on each side of the lower and upper jaws.

Unlike the very high-crowned (<a href="hypsodont">hypsodont</a>) sudamericids, ferugliotheriid teeth were low-crowned (<a href="brachydont">brachydont</a>). Furthermore, sudamericid molariforms tend to be larger and are supported by one large root, but the smaller ferugliotheriids have at least two roots under their molariforms. "Ferugliotherium" is estimated to have weighed 70 g (2.5 oz).

The incisors, known only from "Ferugliotherium", are procumbent and long. Three lower and four upper incisors are known. As is usual in mammals with similarly shaped (<a href="wikt%3Agliriform">gliriform</a>) incisors, the lower incisors are more laterally compressed, are less curved, form a greater angle between the front side and the wear facet at the tip, and are less elliptical in shape than the uppers. The <a href="dental%20enamel">enamel</a> band is restricted to the side that faces the lips in both the lower and upper incisors (the lower side in the lowers and the upper side in the uppers).

The specimen MACN Pv-RN 975, first described by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996, may be a jaw fragment of "Ferugliotherium", although it has also been identified as an unrelated multituberculate. The fossil preserves a bladelike premolar, identified as the fourth premolar, and the piece of the jawbone below it. A <a href="diastema%20%28dentistry%29">diastema</a> (gap) is present between the premolar and the incisor that would have been located in front of it. The <a href="dental%20alveolus">alveolus</a> (socket) of the lower incisor extends all the way through the fossil. The p4 bears eight ridges on both sides of the longitudinal crest and is supported by two roots at the front and back. The p4 assigned to "Argentodites" also has eight ridges on both sides, which descend from <a href="cusp%20%28dentistry%29">cusps</a> on the upper margin, and roots at the front and back. According to Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues, it differs from that of MACN Pv-RN 975 in its rounded, as opposed to angular shape. However, Gurovich and Beck attribute this difference to the fact that the latter has undergone much more <a href="tooth%20wear">wear</a>.

Two fossils have been interpreted as isolated lower premolars of "Ferugliotherium", but neither is still regarded as such. Two other teeth have been identified as upper premolars of "Ferugliotherium"; as with the jaw fragment, they may also represent an indeterminate multituberculate. One of the two preserves two longitudinal rows of cusps, of which one contains four and the other at least two cusps. The other is more poorly preserved, but may represent the same tooth position. These teeth resemble multituberculate upper premolars.

Four putative first lower molariforms (mf1s) of "Ferugliotherium" are known, and the only known tooth of "Trapalcotherium" is also thought to be an mf1. "Ferugliotherium" mf1s are roughly rectangular, with rounded corners, and bear two longitudinal rows of cusps. There are four cusps in the lingual row (on the side of the tongue) and three in the labial row (the side of the lips). The cusps are connected to cusps in the other row by transverse ridges and separated from cusps in their own rows by three transverse furrows. Two heavily worn "Ferugliotherium" mf1s were originally identified as upper molars of "Vucetichia gracilis" by Bonaparte in 1990. One of the two preserves the roots; at the front and back, there were two roots, fused at their bases. The mf1 of "Trapalcotherium" differs only in some details; among others, the cusps are less distinct from the crests. The sole mf2 of "Ferugliotherium" is the <a href="holotype">holotype</a>. It bears two rows of two cusps. The cusps in the front and back pairs are connected by a broad ridge and the two pairs are separated by a deep furrow. Transverse ridges between the cusps similar to those seen in ferugliotheriids are not known in any multituberculate. On the other hand, overall patterns of cusps and ridges are essentially similar among "Ferugliotherium", "Gondwanatherium", and "Sudamerica", indicating that the three are closely related.

One "Ferugliotherium" tooth is thought to be a first upper molariform (MF1). It is almost rectangular and bears three longitudinal rows of cusps. There are five cusps in the middle row, which is oriented obliquely, four cusps in one of the rows on the side of the tooth, and two or three in the other row on the side. As in the lower molariforms, the cusps are connected by transverse ridges and separated by furrows. LACM 149371, the enigmatic possibly ferugliotheriid tooth from Peru, is a triangular tooth bearing six or seven cusps, which are connected by crests and surround two deep fossae (basins) and a third shallower fossa.

With its low-crowned teeth, "Ferugliotherium" may have been an insectivore or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as "<a href="Mesodma">Mesodma</a>", which is thought to have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. The wear on "Ferugliotherium" teeth suggests that the animal may have eaten some plant material. The high-crowned sudamericids are thought to have been herbivores feeding on abrasive vegetation, although their precise diet is not known. In the evolutionary history of gondwanatheres, hypsodont teeth are thought to have evolved from brachydont precursors. Gurovich hypothesizes that the anterior molariforms of sudamericids may have evolved from bladelike premolars as seen in "Ferugliotherium".

Fossils of Argentinean ferugliotheriids come from the <a href="Los%20Alamitos%20Formation">Los Alamitos</a> ("Ferugliotherium"), <a href="La%20Colonia%20Formation">La Colonia</a> ("Ferugliotherium" and "Argentodites"), and <a href="Allen%20Formation">Allen Formation</a>s ("Trapalcotherium"). All three are approximately the same age, dating to the <a href="Campanian">Campanian</a> (84–71 mya) or more likely the <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> (71–66 mya), but the La Colonia Formation is perhaps a little younger. The Los Alamitos and Allen Formations may have been deposited in a marshy environments, and the depositional environment of the La Colonia Formations may have been an <a href="estuary">estuary</a>, <a href="tidal%20flat">tidal flat</a>, or <a href="coastal%20plain">coastal plain</a>.

In each of the three formations, the mammalian fauna is dominated by the archaic group <a href="Dryolestoidea">Dryolestoidea</a>; the Los Alamitos Formation has also produced the sudamericid "Gondwanatherium". Only seven mammalian teeth have been found in the Allen Formation. All three also contain remains of numerous other animals, including dinosaurs, amphibians, and fish.

The <a href="Santa%20Rosa%20local%20fauna">Santa Rosa</a> fossil site, where LACM 149371 was found, is in the <a href="Ucayali%20Region">Ucayali Region</a> of Peru. The Santa Rosa fauna also contains fossils of various unique species of <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a>s and <a href="hystricognath">hystricognath</a> rodents, a possible bat, and some <a href="notoungulate">notoungulate</a>s (a unique extinct group of South American ungulates). The age of this fauna is unclear, and estimates range from near the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>–<a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> boundary (~35 mya) to the late Oligocene (~25 mya). The Santa Rosa mammals may have lived in a <a href="savanna">savanna</a> habitat that contained rivers.

More recently, a specimen has been found in the <a href="Cerro%20del%20Pueblo%20Formation">Cerro del Pueblo Formation</a> of <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, bearing several similarities to "<a href="Ferugliotherium">Ferugliotherium</a>". If a ferugliotheriid, this would extend the clade's range into the <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> of <a href="North%20America">North America</a>.

The range of the Ferugliotheriidae is overall more limited, both in extent and time, than that of Sudamericidae; sudamericids have been recorded from the Late Cretaceous to Miocene of Argentina, the Late Cretaceous of Madagascar and India, the <a href="Middle%20Eocene">Middle Eocene</a> of Antarctica, and perhaps the Cretaceous of Tanzania (<a href="TNM%2002067">TNM 02067</a>, tentatively referred to Sudamericidae). Nevertheless, ferugliotheriids may be the only gondwanatheres to have had a presence in the <a href="northern%20hemisphere">northern hemisphere</a>.

Belle Vue Zoological Gardens

Belle Vue Zoological Gardens was a large <a href="zoo">zoo</a>, <a href="amusement%20park">amusement park</a>, exhibition hall complex and <a href="Motorcycle%20speedway">speedway</a> stadium in <a href="Belle%20Vue%2C%20Manchester">Belle Vue, Manchester</a>, England, opened in 1836. The brainchild of John Jennison, the gardens were initially intended to be an entertainment for the genteel <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a>es, with formal gardens and dancing on open-air platforms during the summer, but they soon became one of the most popular attractions in <a href="Northern%20England">Northern England</a>. Before moving to Belle Vue, Jennison, a part-time gardener, had run a small aviary at his home, the beginnings of the zoo that over the years grew to become the third-largest in the United Kingdom.

Jennison set out a small amusements area in Belle Vue during the 1870s, which was expanded in the early 20th century to become what was advertised as the "showground of the world". Popular rides included the Bobs <a href="roller%20coaster">roller coaster</a> and the Scenic Railway. Other entertainments included grand firework displays from 1852 and an annual Christmas circus from 1922. Music and dancing were popular attractions in Belle Vue's various ballrooms. The Kings Hall, opened in 1910, housed <a href="The%20Hall%C3%A9">the Hallé Orchestra</a> for several years and hosted concerts by artists such as <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href="The%20Who">The Who</a>, <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>, <a href="Leonard%20Cohen">Leonard Cohen</a>, <a href="Johnny%20Cash">Johnny Cash</a> and <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>.

Catering for visitors at Belle Vue was on an industrial scale, ranging from the late 19th century hot water rooms, which accommodated up to 3,000 diners each, providing crockery and hot water for those who brought their own picnics, to more upmarket themed restaurants. Belle Vue became a part of the caterer and hotelier <a href="Charles%20Forte%2C%20Baron%20Forte">Charles Forte</a>'s business empire towards the end of its life in the 1960s. Although he made some improvements to the zoo, Forte's interests lay in developing the gardens' dining and exhibition facilities. The Kings Hall was then the largest exhibition space outside London, but competition from the <a href="G-Mex">G-Mex</a> exhibition and conference centre in <a href="Manchester%20city%20centre">central Manchester</a> led directly to its closure in 1987.

At its peak Belle Vue occupied and attracted more than two million visitors a year, up to 250,000 of whom visited over the <a href="Easter">Easter</a> weekend. The zoo closed in September 1977 after its owners decided they could no longer afford its losses of £100,000 a year. The amusement park remained open on summer weekends until 1980. The land was sold in 1982, and the site finally cleared in 1987. All that remains of Belle Vue today is a <a href="Belle%20Vue%20Stadium">greyhound racing stadium</a> and a <a href="snooker">snooker</a> hall built in the stadium's car park.

Belle Vue Zoological Gardens was the brainchild of <a href="entrepreneur">entrepreneur</a> and part-time gardener John Jennison. He opened the grounds around his home in <a href="Adswood">Adswood</a>, <a href="Stockport">Stockport</a> to the public in 1826, from where he and his wife Maria sold fruit and vegetables. He called his establishment Strawberry Gardens, later Jennison's Gardens. Manchester's increasing urban population encouraged the development of a thriving leisure industry, and public parks were popular. In 1828 or '29 Jennison purchased an adjacent of land on which he and his wife built an <a href="aviary">aviary</a>, to which they charged admission; its first occupant was a captured <a href="thrush%20%28bird%29">thrush</a>. Jennison turned his home into a <a href="Pub">public house</a>, the Adam and Eve, which he and his wife ran together.
In 1835 Jennison was approached by businessman George Gill, who suggested that he lease Belle Vue – a public house in of open land between Kirkmanshulme Lane and <a href="A57%20road">Hyde Road</a> – as a more suitable site for his aviary. Jennison took out a <a href="Mortgage%20loan">mortgage</a> of £300 to pay off the £80 mortgage on the Strawberry Gardens and spent the remainder on a trial six-month lease of the Belle Vue property, in June 1836. In December Jennison signed a 99-year lease at a rent of £135 per annum. For an extra £100 a year he leased additional land to extend the western boundary to Redgate Lane, close to <a href="A6%20road%20%28England%29">Stockport Road</a>, where he made a second entrance. To finance further expansion Jennison re-mortgaged the site for £800.

Except for their belongings, which fitted on a handcart, all the Jennisons took with them to Belle Vue was two or three birdcages containing <a href="parrot">parrot</a>s and other assorted birds. At its opening in 1836, Belle Vue contained an Italian Garden, lakes, mazes and hothouses, as well as the aviary. The family decided that their zoological collection had to be expanded as a matter of priority, and by 1839 elephants, lions, and other exotic African animals had been added. Many other attractions were subsequently added, including a racecourse in 1847. The gardens were an immediate success, but the neighbouring St James's Church was offended that they were open on Sundays, and asked Jennison to close while services were being conducted; he "politely but firmly refused".

Admission to the gardens, which were open until 9 pm during the summer, was by subscription ticket priced at 10 <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s for a family and 5 shillings for an individual, beyond the means of most workers. Concerts of "genteel music" were staged, and there was dancing to various bands on a large open-air wooden platform. Initially, the only public transport to Belle Vue was by horse-drawn <a href="Bus">omnibus</a> from what is now <a href="Piccadilly%20Gardens">Piccadilly</a>, in central Manchester, but the last departure time of 6:00 pm coincided with the end of most workers' shifts. The first railway station was opened near Belle Vue in 1842, allowing workers easier access to the gardens and their attractions, and by 1848 complaints began to appear in the press that "roughs" in coarse attire were embarrassing <a href="middle%20class">middle-class</a> ladies on the dancing platform by attempting to dance with them. There were also complaints about <a href="working%20class">working-class</a> men dancing together, and increasing resentment from working-class patrons about Belle Vue's "forbidding dress requirements, its restricted opening hours, [and] its unwelcoming admission price". In the words of historian David Mayer, Jennison was facing a crisis: "either keep Belle Vue Gardens an exclusive, class-specific, genteel preserve for the <a href="gentry">gentry</a> and the middle class – who would arrive and depart in their own carriages through the Hyde Road gate – or open the gardens to a popular crowd who would arrive by train at the Stockport Road (<a href="Longsight">Longsight</a>) gate". For a time, Jennison sent carriages to the railway station to collect the <a href="first%20class%20travel">first-class</a> passengers, but he also abandoned the idea of subscription tickets, settling instead on a general admission price of 4d, rising to 6d in 1851.

Although the gardens thrived in their early years, by 1842 Jennison was in financial difficulties, and on 13 December <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> proceedings were initiated. Jennison's problems were caused by his failure to sell the Strawberry Gardens property, competition from the recently opened <a href="Manchester%20Zoological%20Gardens">Manchester Zoological Gardens</a>, and the <a href="Manchester%20and%20Birmingham%20Railway">Manchester and Birmingham Railway</a> track cutting through the land Jennison had leased in December 1836, restricting access to the gardens. Jennison twice tried unsuccessfully to sell Belle Vue, after which his creditors allowed him time to make a success of the gardens; by the end of the 1843 season Jennison was able to repay his debts. The railway that had been a thorn in his side eventually proved to be an asset when <a href="Longsight%20railway%20station">Longsight railway station</a> was re-sited closer to Belle Vue in 1842, making it easier for visitors to reach the gardens.

An additional of farmland at the western end of the site was incorporated into the gardens in 1843. One of the ponds was enlarged to form a boating lake, which later became the Firework Lake. An island was created in the middle of the lake, which housed a natural history museum. In 1858 another were leased, in the triangle between Kirkmanshulme Lane and Hyde Road, from which clay was extracted to make bricks for the gardens' buildings. The result of the excavations was a large hole that Jennison filled with water, creating the Great Lake in 1858. Two paddle steamers, the "Little Eastern" and the "Little Britain", each capable of accommodating 100 passengers, offered trips around the lake for <a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">1d</a> (). By 1905 Belle Vue consisted of of walled gardens, with an additional outside its walls.

During the First World War the gardens were used by the <a href="Manchester%20Regiment">Manchester Regiment</a> for drilling, and a munitions factory complete with railway sidings was built.

At the start of the Second World War the gardens were closed at noon following <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain%23Declaration%20of%20war">Neville Chamberlain's radio broadcast</a> announcing that Britain was at war with <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a> on Sunday, 3 September 1939, forcing the cancellation of an "open rehearsal" by the Gorton Philharmonic Orchestra. The nation's armed forces immediately <a href="wikt%3Asequester">sequestered</a> the Exhibition Hall, the restaurants and most of the top floor of the administrative offices. They also took over the sports ground to use as a <a href="barrage%20balloon">barrage balloon</a> base, and dug several <a href="air-raid%20shelter">air-raid shelter</a>s. The gardens were allowed to re-open on 15 September 1939, and remained open throughout the rest of war, although parts of the site were requisitioned by Manchester Corporation and converted into <a href="Allotment%20%28gardening%29">allotments</a>.

Although the Second World War forced the cancellation of many events, and made it difficult to feed all the zoo's animals, it was nevertheless very lucrative for the gardens. Profits steadily increased, and the company made several compensation claims for the requisitioning of its facilities. It was granted £4,000 in 1941 () and £7,242 in 1942 (); in gratitude for the latter, the company presented the <a href="Civil%20Defence%20Service">Civil Defence Service</a> with a new mobile canteen.

The Jennisons had been considering setting up a <a href="limited%20company">limited company</a> to administer the gardens since 1895. Most were in agreement except for Richard, John Jennison Snr's youngest son. After his death in 1919, the remaining family members created John Jennison & Co Ltd with a capital of £253,000 (), comprising investments and loans totalling £63,000 (). George Jennison became chairman, secretary, treasurer and joint managing director with John Jennison Jnr, John Jennison Snr's great-grandson. John, William, Angelo and Richard Jennison Jnr were appointed to the board of directors which was reported to be a "very happy board with few meetings and an entire absence of quarrels".

On 27 November 1924 the Jennisons agreed to sell Belle Vue for £250,000 () to Harry George Skipp, but he was acting as an intermediary, and on 6 March 1925 a further contract was signed by the Jennisons, Skipp and a new company called Belle Vue (Manchester) Ltd. The agreement was for the new company to take over from 1 January 1925, but the transfer did not take place until 28 March. Under the new managing director, <a href="John%20Henry%20Iles">John Henry Iles</a>, the gardens expanded to include what became a world-famous <a href="amusement%20park">amusement park</a>.

Belle Vue enjoyed a brief post-war boom between the end of the Second World War and the early 1950s. During the early 1960s, it could still attract 150,000 visitors on <a href="Easter%20Monday">Easter Monday</a>, but by the end of the decade that figure had dropped to about 30,000, as the competition from rival amusement parks increased. Sir Leslie Joseph and <a href="Charles%20Forte%2C%20Baron%20Forte">Charles Forte</a> bought Belle Vue in 1956, but by 1963 Forte was in sole control. Although he made some improvements to the zoo, Forte's interests lay in developing the gardens' dining and exhibition facilities. Fire became an "ever present hazard" during Belle Vue's later years. The most devastating occurred in 1958 and destroyed many buildings, including the Coronation Ballroom. Although the zoo was spared, the fire almost reached the lion house, distressing one of the older lionesses so much that she had to be shot. Vandalism and theft also became serious and recurring problems; intruders killed 38 of the zoo's birds, including 9 penguins, in 1960.

Belle Vue was the first privately financed zoo in England, and grew to become the third-largest in the UK. Jennison's original idea was that the gardens should be primarily a botanical excursion, but it became clear that the public was interested in the animals as an attraction in their own right. The initial collection had consisted of domestic birds and a few exotic parrots, but Jennison probably also acquired those animals that could not be sold after the Manchester Zoological Gardens closed in 1842. By 1856, the Jennisons had added <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a>s, <a href="Rhinoceros">rhinos</a>, <a href="lion">lion</a>s, <a href="bear">bear</a>s and <a href="gazelle">gazelle</a>s.

In 1871 the zoo acquired four <a href="giraffe">giraffe</a>s; the following year an elephant, Maharajah, was bought for £680 from Wombwell's Menagerie No.1 in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. The plan to transport Maharajah from Edinburgh to Manchester by train was abandoned after the elephant destroyed the railway compartment in which he was to travel. It was therefore decided that Maharajah and his trainer, Lorenzo Lawrence, should walk to Manchester, a journey they completed in 10 days with little incident. Lorenzo became the zoo's head elephant keeper, and stayed at Belle Vue for more than 40 years. Maharajah provided elephant rides to the public for ten years, until his death from <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> in 1882. His skeleton was preserved and added to the gardens' natural history museum. When the museum was decommissioned in 1941, the skeleton, along with other exhibits, was transferred to the <a href="Manchester%20Museum">Manchester Museum</a>.
In 1893 a <a href="Common%20chimpanzee">chimpanzee</a> was purchased from another of Wombwell's Travelling Menageries in London. The four-year-old chimpanzee, Consul, was dressed in a <a href="smoking%20jacket">smoking jacket</a> and cap and puffed on a <a href="Smoking%20pipe%20%28tobacco%29">cob pipe</a>; he frequently accompanied James Jennison to business meetings. Consul proved to be exceptionally popular, and after his death on 24 November 1894, the Jennisons immediately obtained a replacement, Consul II, who played a violin while riding a tricycle around the gardens, later graduating to a bicycle.

Food for the animals became difficult to obtain during the First World War, but for the most part the gardens carried on as usual. Following the declaration of peace, several monkeys originally destined for government experiments with <a href="Chemical%20warfare">poison gas</a> were acquired, as was a <a href="Hippopotamus">hippo</a>, a <a href="dromedary">dromedary</a> and a <a href="zebra">zebra</a>. In 1921 and 1922 the zoo obtained two animals who became great favourites. Lil, an <a href="Indian%20elephant">Indian elephant</a>, arrived in 1921 accompanied by her <a href="British%20Malaya">British Malaya</a>n handler, Phil Fernandez. Phil and Lil provided entertainment, advertising, and elephant rides for 35 years. Frank, a <a href="brown%20bear">brown bear</a>, arrived in 1922. By the time of his death, 40 years later, he was known as the "Father of the Zoo".

Open-air cages installed in the Monkey House resulted in a dramatic improvement in the life expectancy of its residents, but the potential for expansion and improvement after the First World War was limited by the post-war economy. Rising labour costs and minimal profits resulted in the gardens' increasing dilapidation. The zoo began to be neglected after the sale of Belle Vue in 1925, but it was rejuvenated by the appointment of Gerald Iles as zoo superintendent in 1933. A new Gibbon Cage and Monkey Mountain were created and the Reptile House was extended.

In 1925, a display at the zoo was entitled "Cannibals" and featured black Africans depicted as savages.

On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the animal keepers were issued with rifles to deal with any dangerous animals who might escape if the gardens were bombed. A night shift was introduced to watch over the animals 24 hours a day. A list of dangerous animals that was drawn up included 13 lions, 6 tigers, 2 leopards, 1 cheetah, 2 <a href="Tiglon">tigons</a>, 3 other small cats and several bears. Although the zoo's administrators succeeded in convincing the local authorities that any danger from the animals was minimal, primarily because the perimeter walls were so high, the keepers were replaced in their sharp-shooting role by soldiers who patrolled the grounds armed with <a href="Thompson%20submachine%20gun">tommy guns</a>.

Stocks were increased by animals transferred from other zoos that had been forced to close. Initially the zoo was given favourable food rationing quotas, but certain foods became unavailable and the price of others increased dramatically. Bananas were impossible to obtain and the supply of fish was problematic. As a result, the keepers were forced to experiment. The <a href="Sea%20lion">sealions</a> became casualties of the food shortage when their keepers attempted to feed them strips of beef soaked in <a href="cod%20liver%20oil">cod liver oil</a>. Although they seemed to thrive on this diet, their digestive systems were unable to cope with the unusual food, and they eventually died of stomach ulcers. The lions' new diet was green-coloured horsemeat, and the monkeys were fed on boiled potatoes. The <a href="bird-of-paradise">birds-of-paradise</a> (lack of <a href="millet">millet</a>), and the <a href="penguin">penguin</a>s (lack of fish), were unable to adapt to their make-do diet and also succumbed. Vegetables were not in short supply however, as the garden staff grew lettuce, cabbage and carrots in the kitchen gardens.

Wartime interruptions in the supply of gas for heating resulted in the deaths of all the zoo's tropical fish and several other animals, including a lioness called Pearl and her litter of cubs. Although Manchester was heavily bombed during the <a href="Manchester%20Blitz">Blitz</a>, the gardens sustained only minor damage. The Scenic Railway was hit by an <a href="Incendiary%20device">incendiary bomb</a> and the Reptile House was damaged by shell splinters from <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">ack-ack guns</a>, which also caused the death of a bull <a href="bison">bison</a>.

Iles remained as superintendent until 1957, and proved to be a good publicist for the zoo, taking part in radio and television programmes such as "<a href="Children%27s%20Hour">Children's Hour</a>". A new attraction was introduced in 1963, a <a href="chimpanzees%27%20tea%20party">chimps' tea party</a>, which proved to be very popular. The zoo's last superintendent, Peter Grayson, took over in 1971, but by then the owners of Belle Vue had lost interest in the zoo, and closure seemed imminent.

News that Belle Vue Zoological Gardens would close on 11 September 1977 was announced on BBC Radio at 10:00 am on 4 August 1977. The 24 keepers were informed an hour before the news report went on air. The reason given was that the company could no longer afford to cover losses of about £100,000 per year. Shortly before the closure, a number of non-poisonous reptiles were stolen from the Reptile House, only one of which, a <a href="Pythonidae">python</a>, was recovered.

A 15-year-old elephant, Ellie May, had acquired an undeserved reputation for being dangerous, which made her extremely difficult to sell. Her food costs became difficult to justify, but Grayson refused to have her put down. Although he left the zoo in January 1978, Grayson returned frequently to care for Ellie May, the last animal left at the zoo. Eventually <a href="Diergaarde%20Blijdorp">Rotterdam Zoo</a> agreed to take her, and plans were made to transport the elephant to the Netherlands. Ellie May refused to budge however, and overnight developed <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a>. Grayson and veterinary surgeon, <a href="David%20Taylor%20%28veterinarian%29">David Taylor</a>, felt that she would not recover, and decided to call in a marksman to <a href="euthanasia">euthanise</a> her.

Public reaction to the zoo's closure was one of "relative indifference", with only a few minor protests. The doors remained open to visitors at a discounted admission price until early November, a little beyond the official closing date, by which time most of the animals had been sold for an estimated £100,000.

Under the Jennisons, the main priorities for Belle Vue were the zoological and botanical gardens; amusements were provided merely as a distraction. The Jennisons laid out formal gardens in various styles between 1836 and 1898, including mazes, grottoes, an Italian garden, "billiard-table lawns" and constructed Tropical Plant Houses. There were also exotic constructions like the Indian temple and grotto, designed by George Danson, Belle Vue's scenic artist. Built to resemble a ruined temple, it housed snakes and crocodiles as well as flowers. At the end of the 19th century, ""the resort relied almost entirely for its attraction on its delightful gardens"", but by 1931 the formalism had entirely disappeared. The gardens were also used to stage large political rallies for a wide spectrum of opinion, such as the "Great Liberal Demonstration" of 1924, at which <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">Lloyd George</a> addressed a crowd of 50,000, the first political meeting at which loudspeakers were used. The <a href="British%20Union%20of%20Fascists">British Union of Fascists</a>, popularly known as the <a href="Blackshirts">Blackshirts</a>, also held a meeting there, in September 1934. One contemporary commentator observed that "perhaps the Ku Klux Klan will be found in session there one day, for Belle Vue is nothing if not <a href="wikt%3Acatholic">catholic</a>".

The Jennisons set out a small amusements area near the main entrance to the gardens in Hyde Road during the 1870s. comprising steam-driven attractions such as the Ocean Wave, installed in 1894, which simulated a storm at sea.

John Henry Iles, who took over control of Belle Vue in 1925, believed that expansion of the rides and the fun aspect of the park was the way forward, and added attractions such as <a href="Bumper%20cars">dodgems</a>, the Caterpillar, the <a href="Dark%20ride">Ghost Train</a>, Jack & Jill, and the Flying Sea Planes. The Scenic Railway, purchased in 1925 but not fully operational until two years later, proved to be one of Belle Vue's most popular rides, and remained in use until 1975.

The Bobs <a href="Roller%20coaster">rollercoaster</a> was arguably the most popular ride of all, so named because it cost a <a href="shilling">shilling</a> for admission. It had an drop at a 45 degree angle, down which the cars travelled at . It was built by <a href="Harry%20Traver">Harry Traver</a> and designed by Fredrick Church, who had to develop a series of engineering innovations to make the ride possible. The Bobs' distinctive white-painted wooden superstructure became an imposing element of the Belle Vue skyline.

During the 1960s and 1970s "Professor" Len Tomlinson operated one of the UK's last <a href="flea%20circus">flea circus</a>es in a small booth on the amusement park. The attraction consisted of harnessed <a href="human%20flea">human flea</a>s racing chariots at the rate of an inch every few seconds, pulling a garden roller, riding a tricycle and "fencing fleas" scrabbling at pins stuck in pieces of cork in a semblance of a sword fight. The flea circus closed down in the late 1970s as improvements in domestic living conditions made human fleas more difficult to obtain.

When the zoo closed in 1977, it was announced that the gardens and amusement park would be expanded with "new active leisure pursuits". By 1978 the site had been renamed Belle Vue Leisure Park, and the Tropical River House had been converted to a <a href="skateboard">skateboard</a> arena in an attempt to cash in on the new craze from America. The arena turned out to be poor investment however, as there was virtually no demand after the first few months. The 1977 closure of the <a href="Battersea%20Park">London Festival Gardens</a> in <a href="Battersea">Battersea</a>, London, allowed Belle Vue the opportunity to buy their Jetstream ride, which opened the following year.

Other attractions that closed at about the same time as the zoo included the boating on Firework Lake, and the <a href="Ridable%20miniature%20railway">miniature railway</a>. In 1979 the amusement park was leased to the main concessionaire, Alf Wadbrooke, although by then it was only open at weekends during the summer season. The long-promised restoration of the Scenic Railway had not happened and the Water Chute had closed. In August 1980, Wadbrooke was given notice to close down the park by 26 October 1980 and to have all his equipment removed by February 1981.

In 1853 Belle Vue staged the first British open <a href="Brass%20band%20%28British%20style%29">brass band championships</a>. Attended by a crowd of more than 16,000, it was the first of what became an annual event until 1981. A revival occurred in the popularity of brass band contests during the 1970s; competitions between local bands could attract crowds of up to 5,000.

Belle Vue contained several ballrooms, the first of which was constructed in 1851, above a hotel at the <a href="Longsight">Longsight</a> entrance to the gardens. A larger structure, the Music Hall, was built in 1856, underneath the firework viewing stand, capable of accommodating 10,000 people on its of dance floor. A wooden open-air dancing platform was opened in 1852, and by 1855 had been extended to cover an area of . Throughout the summer, music was provided by bands such as the Belle Vue Military, the Belle Vue Quadrille and the Cheetham Hill Brass Band. Open-air dancing continued until the 1940s, but by then the attraction had lost its appeal, and the platform was converted to a roller skating rink. It was destroyed by fire in 1958. The same fire destroyed the Coronation Ballroom, which was replaced by a "huge ballroom complex" known as the New Elizabethan Ballroom in 1959. With room for 4,000 dancers on its two floors, and the largest <a href="Wurlitzer">Wurlitzer</a> organ in Europe (installed in 1967), it was described as being "unsurpassed in Great Britain for size, comfort and elegance". Many well-known bands of the time regularly played for the dancers, including <a href="Geraldo%20%28bandleader%29">Geraldo and his Orchestra</a> and the <a href="Joe%20Loss">Joe Loss Orchestra</a>. During the 1960s and 1970s the ballroom also hosted discothèques, such as <a href="Jimmy%20Savile">Jimmy Savile</a>'s Top Ten Club.

Opened in 1910 the Kings Hall was a converted <a href="Teahouse">teahouse or tea room</a>, enlarged in 1928 and reconstructed as a "saucer like arena" capable of seating 7,000 people. The name "Kings" was chosen in reference to the two kings who reigned during the six-week period of its construction: <a href="George%20V">George V</a> and <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>. The hall was designed to stage "Demonstrations, Exhibitions, Social Gatherings, etc", and was a popular concert venue until the 1970s, with appearances by artists such <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href="The%20Who">The Who</a>, <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a> and <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>. The Kings Hall became home to the <a href="The%20Hall%C3%A9">Hallé Orchestra</a> in 1942, when its previous base, the <a href="Free%20Trade%20Hall">Free Trade Hall</a>, was damaged by bombing during the <a href="Manchester%20Blitz">Manchester Blitz</a>; the orchestra continued to perform concerts at Belle Vue for more than 30 years.

From 1961 until 1966, <a href="Bingo%20%28Commonwealth%29">bingo</a> sessions were held in the hall. Able to accommodate up to 3,500 players, it was advertised as the "largest bingo club in the world". Many exhibitions were also held in the hall, which with its of floor space was one of the largest venues outside London. It was split into three separate halls in 1956, to allow three exhibitions to be run simultaneously.

The last piece of live music played in the hall, on 14 February 1982, was a performance by the Glossop School Band, who were taking part in the North West Amateur Brass Band Championship in front of a crowd of 1,700. The hall had been sold 18 months earlier to a development company, Espley Tyas Development Group, and was by then scheduled for demolition to allow the site to be redeveloped. News of the sale had triggered the formation of local action groups, who organised a petition signed by 50,000 people in an unsuccessful effort to save the hall. The exhibition halls were sold to Mullet Ltd. in 1983, but competition from the newly opened <a href="G-Mex">G-Mex</a> exhibition and conference centre in central Manchester led directly to their closure. The site was sold to the British Car Auction Group in 1987, and the buildings demolished to make way for a large car auction centre.

The gates were opened to visitors between 10:00 am and 10:30 pm. Kiosks around the gardens sold snacks and ice cream, made in Belle Vue's own ice cream factory. Families were catered for at lunchtimes by the hot-water rooms, each of which could accommodate up to 3,000 diners, providing hot water for drinks and crockery for visitors who brought their own picnics. The price was 2d per person, according to the 1892 guide book, and cakes and jams made in the gardens' bakery and on-site kitchens were also available, at extra cost. ""One shilling tea rooms"", close to the hot water rooms, offered lunchtime deals such as a pot of tea, bread and butter, green salad and fruit cake for a shilling. The more expensive restaurants tended to open during the evening. Alcohol was available in the many licensed premises in the gardens, including, until its closure in 1928, beer produced in Belle Vue's on-site brewery. Many <a href="Pub">public houses</a> were also opened in the area immediately surrounding the gardens.

Licensed hotels were built at each of the three entrances to the gardens. The Longsight Hotel, built in 1851 and demolished in 1985, was a part of the entrance. The Lake Hotel, built in 1876, had facilities for the free stabling of horses belonging to Belle Vue's visitors. It was extended in 1929 and then again in 1960, when a concert room was added, offering late-night entertainment. After its closure in the 1980s, the hotel was demolished. The Hyde Road Hotel and Restaurant at the main entrance, originally known as Belle Vue House, was renamed the Palm Court Restaurant in 1942, and then Caesar's Palace in 1969. It housed a cabaret bar and a restaurant, which was converted to an amusement arcade in 1976 when it was once again renamed, to Jennison's Ale House. The building was closed after a partial collapse in 1980.

After a trip to London to visit <a href="The%20Great%20Exhibition">The Great Exhibition</a> of 1851, Jennison's ideas for Belle Vue became more ambitious. He decided to implement large, scheduled "fantastic" firework displays employing a scenic artist, George Danson, to design and create a canvas backdrop. The displays took place on an island in the middle of the Firework Lake, which also housed a small natural history museum. In keeping with Jennison's desire for self-sufficiency, the fireworks were made on-site at Belle Vue.

The first display took place on 2 May 1852, designed by "Signor Pietro". The theme for the early displays was "battle enactment", which proved to be popular with the paying public and resulted in Belle Vue becoming an all-day entertainment venue. The firework displays incorporated real people and real weapons, some of which, 1866-vintage Snyder rifles, were issued to members of the local <a href="Home%20Guard%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Home Guard</a> during the Second World War. The first display, a re-enactment of the <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Algiers%20%281816%29">Bombardment of Algiers</a> involving 25 men, 300 rockets, 25 "large shells", and 50 <a href="Roman%20candle%20%28firework%29">Roman candles</a>, was watched by 18,000 spectators.

The displays continued throughout the First World War, except that the use of rockets was prohibited under the <a href="Defence%20of%20the%20Realm%20Act%201914">Defence of the Realm Act</a>. Reflecting contemporary events, the theme for the 1915 display was "The Battle of the Marne"; in 1916 it was "The War in Flanders", during which one spectator got so caught up in the action that he waded across the lake to join in with the "fighting". Anticipating the outbreak of the Second World War, the theme for the 1933 display was "Air Raid on London".

The last grand firework display took place in 1956, on the theme of <a href="Robin%20Hood">Robin Hood</a> and His Merrie Men.

The first Belle Vue Circus took place in 1922, but it was not considered a success. The next was staged in 1929, after the company negotiated a deal with the <a href="Blackpool%20Tower">Blackpool Tower Company</a> to provide acts and equipment for what subsequently became a regular Christmas event held in the Kings Hall. One of the first arrivals from <a href="Blackpool">Blackpool</a> was <a href="Ringmaster%20%28circus%29">ringmaster</a> <a href="George%20Claude%20Lockhart">George Lockhart</a>, known as "the prince of ringmasters". Lockhart became synonymous with the Belle Vue Circus, and his face was used on many advertising posters. Zoo superintendent Gerald Iles included some of the zoo's animals in the circus, in a feature called Noah's Ark.

For the 1967–68 season, to celebrate his 39th consecutive year, the circus was temporarily renamed the "George Lockhart Celebration Circus". Lockhart was the ringmaster for 43 years, until his retirement in 1970 at the age of 90. His replacement, Danish-born Nelly Jane, held the job for two years before being replaced by <a href="Norman%20Barrett%20%28ringmaster%29">Norman Barrett</a>, the last ringmaster. Another of the circus stalwarts was resident band leader and Belle Vue's musical director Fred Bonelli, who started his career as a trumpet player for <a href="Ringling%20Bros.%20and%20Barnum%20%26amp%3B%20Bailey%20Circus">Barnum and Bailey's</a> circus band, and led various Belle Vue circus bands for 40 years.

Many of the acts featured animals, such as Eugene Weidmann's mixed group of tigers and bears, Thorson Kohrmann and his Farmyard Friends, Willi Mullen's Caucasian Cavalry & Ponies, Miss Wendy's Performing Pigeons and Harry Belli's Horse Riding Tigerto say nothing of the Dog! As well as the animal acts there was the usual collection of acrobats, strongmen and clowns, two of whom, <a href="Robert%20George%20John%20Francis%20Fossett">Jacko the Clown</a> and his partner <a href="William%20Alfred%20Merchant">"Little Billy" Merchant</a>, performed at Belle Vue for thirty years.

The last circus to take place in the Kings Hall before its sale was in 1981. For a few years afterwards the circus continued in the car park, then in a marquee on wasteland directly opposite the gardens' main gates on Hyde Road.

Sporting events became a permanent feature at Belle Vue after an athletics stadium was built in 1887.

Greyhound racing was introduced to Belle Vue in 1926, in the UK's first purpose-built <a href="Belle%20Vue%20Stadium">greyhound stadium</a>, constructed at a cost of £22,000. It was built on land leased by Belle Vue to the <a href="Greyhound%20Racing%20Association">Greyhound Racing Association</a> (GRA), a company chaired by Sir <a href="William%20Gentle">William Gentle</a>, who was also the chairman of Belle Vue (Manchester) Ltd. The site was sold to the GRA in 1937, with the proviso that it had to be used for greyhound racing.

One of the activities that became synonymous with Belle Vue was <a href="motorcycle%20speedway">speedway</a> (known at the time as <a href="dirt%20track%20racing">dirt track racing</a>), which was introduced on 28 July 1928 in the recently built greyhound racing arena. The sport proved to be very popular, and the decision was taken to convert the 1887 athletics ground into a speedway stadium, which opened on 23 March 1929. It was at the time the largest purpose-built speedway stadium in the country, possibly in the world. Eventually it became the first home of the <a href="Belle%20Vue%20Aces">Belle Vue Aces</a>, but it was also used for many other events, such as football, cricket, rugby league (<a href="Broughton%20Rangers">Belle Vue Rangers</a>), baseball, <a href="stock%20car%20racing">stock car racing</a> and tennis. The stadium had covered accommodation for 40,000 spectators. As the speedway bikes ran on wood alcohol (known as dope), they were unaffected by fuel rationing during the Second World War and racing was able to continue, although many other attractions in the gardens were forced to close.

Belle Vue sold the stadium in 1982, but speedway continued there until 1987; the final event was a <a href="Stock%20car%20racing">stock car</a> race, held on 14 November 1987, shortly before the stadium was demolished after having been sold to the British Car Auction Group. The Belle Vue Aces returned to their first home, the greyhound stadium, where they had begun in 1929.

From the late 1920s until the outbreak of the Second World War, Belle Vue was "the boxing Mecca of Europe". Bouts were held in the Kings Hall, and although popularity declined in the years following the war, Belle Vue staged a televised world championship fight in 1964 between <a href="Terry%20Downes">Terry Downes</a> and <a href="Willie%20Pastrano">Willie Pastrano</a>.

The first wrestling contest took place in the Kings Hall on 15 December 1930, and proved to be a popular attraction. Except for a break during the Second World War, events continued to be held until 1981, watched by up to 5,000 spectators. Popular performers included <a href="Jack%20Pye">Jack Pye</a>, <a href="Shirley%20Crabtree">Big Daddy</a>, and <a href="Martin%20Ruane">Giant Haystacks</a>.

The speedway stadium became the home of <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a> club, <a href="Broughton%20Rangers">Broughton Rangers</a>, who recruited international players including <a href="Frank%20Whitcombe">Frank Whitcombe</a> (who also worked in the zoo as a <a href="zookeeper">zookeeper</a>), <a href="Billy%20Stott">Billy Stott</a>, and <a href="James%20Cumberbatch">James Cumberbatch</a>. When the club was taken over by Belle Vue in 1933 Broughton were given a 21-year lease for use of the stadium, at a rent to be based on attendances. The first Anglo-Australian <a href="Test%20match%20%28rugby%20league%29">Test match</a> of the <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20Kangaroo%20tour%20of%20Great%20Britain">1933–34 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain</a> was played at Belle Vue, with the home side's victory attracting approximately 34,000 spectators.

Games were suspended during the Second World War, and on their resumption in 1945 the club was renamed Belle Vue Rangers. Belle Vue declined to renew the lease when it expired in 1955 as the arrangement was proving to be a "financial burden", and the team was disbanded.

After a fire at <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City's</a> <a href="Hyde%20Road%20Football%20Stadium">Hyde Road</a> ground in 1920, the club considered a move to the Belle Vue athletics stadium, but it was deemed too small. At the behest of Belle Vue director John Henry Iles and John Ayrton, <a href="Manchester%20Central%20F.C.">Manchester Central</a>, was formed, and played its home matches at the speedway stadium. One of Manchester Central's first matches at Belle Vue was a visit by <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> holders <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> in September 1928. The club attempted unsuccessfully to join <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> in 1930 and in 1931; with momentum lost, the club faded, and folded in 1934.

 In 1963 the Top Lake, formerly known as the Great Lake, was filled in and a 32-lane <a href="ten-pin%20bowling">ten-pin bowling</a> alley built on its site, just behind the Lake Hotel. Known as the Belle Vue Granada Bowl, it opened in 1965, advertised as "the north's leading luxury centre". In 1983, after the rest of Belle Vue had closed, it was sold to First Leisure Group, and bowling continued for a time. A snooker club was built in a corner of the car park in 1985. All that remained of Belle Vue as of 2010 is the greyhound stadium and the snooker club; the original gardens and amusement park are now an industrial and residential area. A road in the housing estate, Lockhart Close, was named after circus ringmaster George Lockhart.

In the aftermath of Manchester's failed <a href="Regional%20casino">supercasino</a> bid in 2008, local groups began to lobby for the construction of a "linear park" in the area, building on "the legacy of Belle Vue". It would have comprised a new zoo, deer park and amusement park.

Burning Rangers

Development began shortly after the release of "<a href="Christmas%20Nights">Christmas Nights</a>" in November 1996. Producer <a href="Yuji%20Naka">Yuji Naka</a> wanted to create a game which involved saving people rather than killing them. Sonic Team chose to connect the game with <a href="firefighting">firefighting</a> as they thought it was an effective way of having players identify with heroism. "Burning Rangers" received mostly positive reviews. Critics unanimously commended the game's soundtrack and audio, with the voice navigation system receiving particular praise. The response to the <a href="video%20game%20graphics">graphics</a> was mixed, with some critics asserting that it had the best visuals on the Saturn, although it was noted for its poor <a href="Collision%20detection%23Video%20games">collision detection</a> and occasional glitching. The game was among the final five Saturn games released in America.

"Burning Rangers" is a <a href="third-person%20shooter">third-person shooter</a> game in which players complete missions involving extinguishing fires and rescuing civilians. The game is set in a futuristic society in which fire is the only danger, and stars an elite group of <a href="firefighter">firefighter</a>s, the Burning Rangers. The player <a href="player%20character">assumes control</a> of one of two apprentice rangers, and completes tasks across the game's four <a href="level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a>. The primary objective is to transport stranded civilians from burning buildings, by collecting energy crystals dropped from extinguished fires. A minimum of five crystals are needed to transport a civilian to safety; the player receives an energy shield if they use ten. The crystals function similarly to <a href="Rings%20%28Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%29">rings</a> in "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" games: possessing at least one crystal allows a player to survive damage from an enemy or fire. Being hit once scatters the player's crystals and renders them vulnerable to death.

The game's four stages take place in a <a href="power%20plant">power plant</a>, <a href="underwater%20habitat">underwater habitat</a>, <a href="space%20station">space station</a> and <a href="spaceship">spaceship</a> in <a href="weightlessness">zero gravity</a>, respectively. Every level is an interior space, and consists of multi-storey rooms and corridors divided by interlocking <a href="elevator">lifts</a> and doors. The player is equipped with a <a href="jet%20pack">jet pack</a> to reach higher areas and perform acrobatic manoeuvres such as backflips and rolls. They can also swim and dive underwater. Robots attack the player with shooting flames should they come into contact. Each stage ends with a <a href="boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss battle</a>, ranging from fire-breathing flowers to robotic fish.

Since there is no in-game map, the player character relies on a voice navigation system to find their way. The mission controller gives the player directions depending on their location, which can be repeated at any time. At the end of each stage, the player receives a rank based on their score and success at putting out fires, with "S" the highest and "D" the lowest. Once the game is completed, a random generator mode is unlocked which mixes up the order of corridors in the game's four stages, with a potential total of 3,125 unique routes.

Burning Rangers takes place on a futuristic Earth where the only threat to human life is from fires. To this end a team of highly specialised fire-fighters called Burning Rangers are dispatched to emergency incidents to fight fires and rescue people in danger. The player is given the choice of two playable characters to play as; Shou Amabane or Tillis. The selected character is first taken through a tutorial stage where they are introduced to the other members of the team, Chris Parton, Reed Phoenix, Big Landman and the non-selected playable character, before being taken on missions. During the final mission, the Rangers are introduced to Ilia Klein, a girl placed in suspended animation and sent into space after contracting an incurable disease. Ilia informs the Rangers her ship is set to crash into Earth causing complete devastation, so the Rangers devise a plan to stop the ship and rescue Ilia. In the end credit scenes, it is revealed that Shou and Tillis become fully fledged Rangers, and Ilia is cured of her disease and settles into her new life on Earth as a member of the Burning Rangers.

Development of "Burning Rangers" started around November 1996, after the release of Sonic Team's previous game "<a href="Christmas%20Nights">Christmas Nights</a>" (a Christmas-themed demo for "<a href="Nights%20into%20Dreams...">Nights into Dreams...</a>"). The concept originated with the idea of rescuing people as opposed to killing them, which was an element that producer <a href="Yuji%20Naka">Yuji Naka</a> felt was too common in contemporary video games. The development team of 31 (out of Sonic Team's staff of about 50) was directed by <a href="Naoto%20Ohshima">Naoto Ohshima</a>, the director and lead designer <a href="Takao%20Miyoshi">Takao Miyoshi</a>. The rest of the team consisted of three game planners, six <a href="game%20programming">programmers</a>, eighteen <a href="video%20game%20design">designers</a>, and two sound producers, most of whom had worked on "Nights into Dreams...".

The team chose to centre the game on <a href="firefighter">firefighter</a>s as they felt that fire was the most appropriate way to create fear and tension. In a retrospective interview, Ohshima said that many of the things done by firefighters—along with rescuing people—were "the very essence of a Sonic Team game", and that they recognised that a firefighter was a hero with whom people could identify. The team wanted to make a game with a rescue theme as Naka thought there were few games based on that concept. According to Takeo Miyoshi, "Our first inspiration came from the <a href="pyrotechnics">explosion</a> and building destruction scenes of Hollywood movies. We just wanted to describe the heroism of lifesaving in that loud, explosive type of setting." The developers wanted to design a future that was "clean and beautiful", with <a href="sustainable%20energy">sustainable energy</a>, but where disasters still could occur, and only heroes could protect people from them. The designers envisioned that a futuristic firefighter would be acrobatic and dexterous to reach places where people were trapped.

Although the target audience of "Burning Rangers" was people who enjoyed <a href="action%20game">action game</a>s, the developers also wanted to attract fans of other Sonic Team games. Ohshima stressed that he was aiming at a wider audience and not the type of person who only played "Sonic the Hedgehog", adding that "players should recognise the Sonic Team touch immediately" with "Burning Rangers". The working title was "Firefighter", but it was dropped as the team wanted a "cooler" sounding name. Naka felt that "burning" had a "go for it!" connotation in Japanese, and fit with the disaster-rescue theme. He was initially unsure about having "ranger" in the title as he felt that a ranger referred to <a href="park%20ranger">park ranger</a>s in western culture. The team thought that the image of a "ranger" also brought to mind the "<a href="Power%20Rangers">Power Rangers</a>" franchise, and after consulting speakers of other languages, "Burning Rangers" was chosen as the game's name.

During the early stages of development, some members of Sonic Team visited Hong Kong shortly before the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20handover">transfer of British sovereignty</a>, in hopes of finding inspiration for the game's stages. Some staff also travelled to <a href="Universal%20Studios%20Hollywood">Universal Studios</a> in California to experience the <a href="Backdraft%20%28attraction%29">Backdraft</a> attraction to learn how to generate a similar sensation in the game. The team also visited a special firefighting event in Tokyo where they witnessed robots putting out fires, and were surprised to see how it compared to their image of the game's futuristic setting. Naka recalled that the robot had special <a href="thermographic%20camera">infrared sensors</a> and a camera which could see through fires, and was impressed by their techniques. According to Naka, the team did not ask for advice from professional firefighters during development, partly due to the concern that their game would not be well received, as Naka thought they would have said that real firefighting "wasn't that simple". At the <a href="Tokyo%20Games%20Show">Tokyo Games Show</a>, a real firefighter, however, did comment that the character's costumes were too thin. Naka reflected that if they had made any of game elements highly realistic, the contrast between those elements and the clearly fictional elements would have been exaggerated.

The game uses the same <a href="game%20engine">engine</a> as "Nights into Dreams...". When Sonic Team developed "Nights into Dreams...", they were new to programming for the Sega Saturn, and when the engine was re-used for "Burning Rangers" they were able to make it faster and more capable. To design the stages and environments, Miyoshi outlined the corridors first, then placed fires in them before adding light effects to simulate the appearance of fire. Miyoshi thought that the team had over-reached in designing the game's detailed stages, saying: "everyone in the team wanted to put so much into the game that we only completed about half of what we wanted to do." Naka said that although they designed only four stages, they ensured that the player's experience would increase progressively throughout the game because each stage was very large. The developers initially used <a href="motion%20capture">motion capture</a> technology to capture data for poses and animation, but Naka soon discovered that it was impossible to get the results the team wanted, as it was unfeasible for people to perform the special motions they needed. The developers resorted to creating the animation by hand, and only used the motion capture data for the player characters' walking animations.

There were many difficulties in developing the game's voice navigation system, as no verbal dialogue had featured in a Sonic Team game before. Naka asserted the team had rethought all ideas of what should be included in the game during development, and the idea of not including any on-screen maps but rather relying on a voice navigation system was "there from the start". The team tested different forms of navigation systems and picked the best. Although they acknowledged that having a voice navigation system would make the use of <a href="background%20music">background music</a> impossible, they realised that it would help create a dramatic atmosphere. Miyoshi thought that the sound effects of fire and walls creaking alone would be enough to produce immersion.

The team originally wanted to record the game in six languages, but found the volume of work too difficult, reverting to English and Japanese instead. Before selecting <a href="voice%20acting">voice actors</a>, Miyoshi designed the characters and built up a mental image of what they would sound like. Sonic Team hired several voice actors who had appeared in American television programmes. According to Miyoshi, all audio work was re-written several times throughout development; he considered it to have "evolved" alongside the team's production of the game itself.

Designing the game's fire effects proved to be difficult due to the Saturn's <a href="rendering%20%28computer%20graphics%29">rendering</a> limitations. Miyoshi explained that during testing stages, the team spent a lot of time checking how well they would be able to create fires, which was a pivotal aspect of the game. In the first test <a href="ROM%20image">ROM</a> they produced, Miyoshi discovered that they were able to achieve "some quite beautiful" fire effects by disguising blocky <a href="sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a> with various degrees of transparency and lighting effects. At the time, few games used polygons in 3D spaces for acrobatic and exploration-orientated gameplay.

"Burning Rangers" animated cutscenes were produced by <a href="TMS%20Entertainment">TMS Entertainment</a>, who had also produced the "<a href="Virtua%20Fighter%20%28anime%29">Virtua Fighter</a>" <a href="anime">anime</a> and the "Man of the Year" short on "<a href="Sonic%20Jam">Sonic Jam</a>" for Sega, as well as cinematic feature films such as <a href="Akira%20%281988%20film%29">"Akira"</a> and "." The company has produced content for Sega since it was subsidised as TMS-Kyokuchi. The game's anime cutscenes were made with digital animation instead of <a href="cel%20shading">cel shading</a>, as it was easier to develop for CDs. According to Miyoshi, the entire development of the game spanned around a year and a half, although the programming took less than a year.

The game was among the final five Saturn games released in America. Each of the main developers reflected on what they were proudest of: Naka expressed relief that Sonic Team were able to "get a good overall balance" for the game, whereas Miyoshi thought that the voice navigation system was the strongest aspect. Main programmer Takuya Matsumoto was delighted to see it released before the Saturn's discontinuation, saying "the fact that we've been able to push the Saturn this far is enough for me to die happy". "Burning Rangers" was released exactly nine months before the Japanese release of Sega's next console, the <a href="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a>. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Levi Buchanan characterized the release as an example of the Saturn's "ignominious send-off", writing that "sunset Saturn games like "<a href="Panzer%20Dragoon%20Saga">Panzer Dragoon Saga</a>" and "Burning Rangers" demanded far better launches. The way these games were slipped into retail with zero fanfare and low circulation was insulting to both hard-working developers and Sega fans."

Reviewers praised "Burning Rangers"' colourful lighting effects, but criticised its <a href="Collision%20detection%23Video%20games">collision detection</a> and occasional graphical glitching. Lee Nutter of the British "<a href="Sega%20Saturn%20Magazine">Sega Saturn Magazine</a>" enjoyed the detailed characters and described the lighting effects as excellent, although he, along with <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Levi Buchanan, noticed that the visuals had minor problems. Sonia Herranz from "<a href="Hobby%20Consolas">Hobby Consolas</a>" and Ed Lomas from "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" commended the character's designs, colourful lighting and detailed visuals, though Lomas declared that the graphics "[did] often look a mess".

The game's poor collision detection was unanimously criticised by reviewers, and Colin Williamson of <a href="AllGame">AllGame</a> also felt that the game's prominent polygon errors were a problem, though he appreciated the attractive lighting effects. Some critics compared the game's visuals to those of "Nights into Dreams...". Ryan MacDonald commented that it had a similar look and feel to that game's 3D environment, and that "Burning Rangers" polygonal graphics were "some of the best [he had] ever seen". Mike Weigand from "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" considered that the majority of the game featured "drab" stage designs, and in a retrospective review "<a href="GMR%20%28magazine%29">GMR</a>"s Dave Smith thought that the game "looks like hell" and had not aged as well as "Nights into Dreams...", and that its engine could not handle a free-roaming environment without harming its visuals. Weigand felt the game's 3D environment was a mix of both "<a href="Tomb%20Raider%20%281996%20video%20game%29">Tomb Raider</a>" and "Nights into Dreams...".

The soundtrack and sound effects received praise, though reviewers recognised that the game lacked music to create tension. Buchanan appreciated that the game contained a few tracks of "excellent" Sega-style music, with his favourite being the theme song. Although Williamson, Weigand, and Nutter noted the lack of in-game music, they lauded the vocal tracks, voice samples, and sound clues. Most reviewers questioned the quality of the dialogue. Weigand felt it was "lame", and Smith said the game contained "some of the worst voice acting ever produced by human lungs". Herranz had difficulty understanding crucial dialogue since the audio was only recorded in English, although she admitted that the voice guidance system was an innovative element. Williamson praised Sega's decision to produce full voiced dialogue as opposed to subtitling original Japanese dialogue, and also praised its "good-to-excellent" English voice acting, though it was "no Shakespeare".

Reviewers had mixed opinions on the control scheme and use of the Saturn 3D controller. Nutter noted that the controls were a mix of those featured in "Tomb Raider" and "Nights into Dreams...", praising the use of the <a href="analog%20stick">analogue stick</a> to perform complex manoeuvres. A reviewer from the Japanese "Sega Saturn Magazine" felt the game was more comfortable with an <a href="gamepad">analogue pad</a> as opposed to the default Saturn controller, and Williamson similarly thought the control scheme was "great" when used with an analogue pad. In contrast, Weigand criticised the lack of a custom configuration and described the controls as "squirrelly", even with the analogue controller. A couple of reviewers criticised the game's short length and lack of difficulty. Nutter suggested that accomplished players would have it "clocked" in a couple of days and felt it did not take much effort to complete the four levels, whilst Buchanan said it was "too short for its own good", a problem made worse by its enjoyable gameplay.

Icelandic Phallological Museum

The Icelandic Phallological Museum (), located in <a href="Reykjav%C3%ADk">Reykjavík</a>, Iceland, houses the world's largest display of <a href="penis">penis</a>es and penile parts. The collection of 280 specimens from 93 species of animals includes 55 penises taken from <a href="whales">whales</a>, 36 from <a href="Pinniped">seals</a> and 118 from <a href="Terrestrial%20animal">land mammal</a>s, allegedly including <a href="Hulduf%C3%B3lk">Huldufólk</a> (Icelandic elves) and <a href="troll">troll</a>s. In July 2011, the museum obtained its first <a href="human%20penis">human penis</a>, one of four promised by would-be donors. Its detachment from the donor's body did not go according to plan and it was reduced to a greyish-brown shriveled mass that was pickled in a jar of <a href="formaldehyde">formalin</a>. The museum continues to search for "a younger and a bigger and better one."

Founded in 1997 by since-then retired teacher Sigurður Hjartarson and now run by his son Hjörtur Gísli Sigurðsson, the museum grew out of an interest in penises that began during Sigurður's childhood when he was given a cattle whip made from a bull's penis. He obtained the organs of Icelandic animals from sources around the country, with acquisitions ranging from the front tip of a <a href="blue%20whale%20penis">blue whale penis</a> to the <a href="baculum">baculum</a> of a <a href="hamster">hamster</a>, which can only be seen with a magnifying glass. The museum claims that its collection includes the penises of elves and trolls, though, as Icelandic folklore portrays such creatures as being invisible, they cannot be seen. The collection also features phallic art and crafts such as lampshades made from the scrotums of bulls.

The museum has become a popular tourist attraction with thousands of visitors a year and has received international media attention, including a Canadian documentary film called "The Final Member", which covers the museum's quest to obtain a human penis. According to its mission statement, the museum aims to enable "individuals to undertake serious study into the field of phallology in an organized, scientific fashion."

The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's <a href="Hamrahlid%20College">Hamrahlid College</a> for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's <a href="pizzle">pizzle</a>, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him <a href="whale%20penis">whale penis</a>es as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.

The organs of farm animals came from <a href="slaughterhouse">slaughterhouse</a>s, while fishermen supplied those of <a href="pinniped">pinniped</a>s and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from <a href="Whaling%20in%20Iceland">commercial whaling stations</a>, although this source dried up after the <a href="International%20Whaling%20Commission">International Whaling Commission</a> implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a> shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on <a href="drift%20ice">drift ice</a> off the <a href="Westfjords">Westfjords</a>.

Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: "Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'" According to Sigurður, "Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one."
The collection was at first housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job. He decided, more as a hobby than a job, to put it on public display in Reykjavík and was awarded a grant from the city council of <a href="Icelandic%20kr%C3%B3na">ISK</a> 200,000 to support the opening of a museum in August 1997. By 2003, it was attracting 5,200 visitors a year, of which 4,200 were from abroad. He put the museum up for sale in 2003, but also offered it to the city of Reykjavík as a gift. However, he was unsuccessful in obtaining financial support from the state or city. When he retired in 2004, he could no longer afford the rent on the museum's premises.
After his retirement, he moved along with his collection to <a href="H%C3%BAsav%C3%ADk">Húsavík</a>, a fishing village with a population of about 2,200 people located northeast of the capital. The museum was housed in a small building, formerly a restaurant, that was marked with a giant wooden penis and a stone phallus standing outside on the street. The village's inhabitants were at first skeptical of the new arrival, but came to accept it when they were persuaded that there was nothing pornographic about the museum.

In 2012 he handed over the collection to his son, Hjörtur Gísli Sigurðsson (described by "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>" as "the world's only hereditary penis-museum operator"). It was relocated from Húsavík to Reykjavík's main shopping street at <a href="Laugavegur%20%28Reykjav%C3%ADk%29">Laugavegur</a> 116. Its former location in Húsavík is now home to <a href="The%20Exploration%20Museum">The Exploration Museum</a>. An offer from a wealthy German to buy the museum for ISK 30 million (US $232,000 / €186,000) and a proposal to move it to the United Kingdom were both turned down, as Hjörtur insists that "the museum has to be in Iceland." He intends to continue acquiring new penises because you can "always get a better, newer one ... a bigger size or better shape, you know?"

According to <a href="University%20of%20Iceland">University of Iceland</a> <a href="anthropologist">anthropologist</a> Sigurjón Baldur Hafsteinsson, Icelanders' tolerance of the museum is an indicator of how Icelandic society has changed since the 1990s, when a newly elected <a href="neoliberalism">neoliberal</a> government fostered a more open outlook on entertainment, creativity and tourism that has "enabled new ideas to emerge publicly". He has documented the significance of the museum's role in Icelandic culture in a book, "Phallological museum".

According to the museum's website, the collection comprises 280 specimens from 93 species of animals. They range from some of the largest to some of the smallest penises in the animal world. Its largest exhibit is a portion of a blue whale's penis measuring long and weighing , which "Iceland Review" has dubbed "a real Moby Dick". The specimen is just the tip, as the entire organ, when intact, would have been about long and weighed about . The baculum of a hamster, only long, is the smallest item in the collection and needs a magnifying glass to be viewed. Sigurður has described the collection as the product of "37 years of collecting penises. Somebody had to do it."

The museum also has a "folklore section" exhibiting mythological penises; its online catalogue lists specimens taken from elves, trolls, <a href="kelpie">kelpie</a>s, and "The Nasty Ghost of <a href="Sn%C3%A6fellsj%C3%B6kull">Snæfell</a>". Sigurður says that the elf's penis, which the museum's catalogue describes as "unusually big and old", is among his favourites. It cannot be seen, as Icelandic folklore holds that elves and trolls are invisible. The folkloric penises also include those of a <a href="merman">merman</a>, a one-legged, one-armed and one-eyed monster called a Beach-Murmurer, an Enriching Beach Mouse (said to draw "money from the sea to enrich her owner"), and an <a href="Yule%20Lads">Icelandic Christmas Lad</a> found dead at the foot of a mountain in 1985 and whose penis was presented to the museum by a former mayor of Reykjavík.

The museum's website states that it enables "individuals to undertake serious study into the field of phallology in an organized, scientific fashion", giving due prominence to a field that until now has only been "a borderline field of study in other academic disciplines such as history, art, psychology, literature and other artistic fields like music and ballet." The museum aims to collect penis specimens from every <a href="List%20of%20mammals%20of%20Iceland">mammal in Iceland</a>. It also exhibits phallic artwork and penis-related objects or "phallobilia" such as lampshades made from the <a href="scrotum">scrotum</a>s of bulls. Other exhibits range "from an 18th-century engraving depicting the circumcision of Christ to a 20th-century plastic penis pacifier." Most of the collection has been donated, and the only purchase to date has been an <a href="penis%23elephants">elephant's penis</a> measuring nearly long. The penises are either preserved in <a href="formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a> and displayed in jars or are dried and hung or mounted on the walls of the museum.
Sigurður has used a variety of techniques to preserve the penises, including preservation in formaldehyde, pickling, drying, stuffing and salting. One particularly large penis taken from a bull has been converted into a walking stick. Many of the museum's exhibits are illuminated by lamps made by Sigurður from rams' testicles. Sigurður has also carved wooden phalluses, which can be found adorning various objects around the museum, and has a bow tie decorated with images of phalluses that he wears on special occasions.

Josh Schonwald of <a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a> described his impressions of the museum when he visited in 1998:

The museum is open every day and by July 2011 was attracting up to 11,000 visitors annually. Sixty percent of the museum's visitors are reported to be women, though according to the authors of the "Rough Guide to Iceland", mentioning the museum "causes the staff at the tourist office to blush with embarrassment." The museum's guest book includes comments such as, "I've never seen so many penises–and I went to boarding school!" (from a New Zealand visitor), "They're bigger in the USA," (from someone from Wisconsin) and "Is there a vagina museum?" On this point, Sigurður has said, "I'm only collecting the male organ. Somebody else has to do the other job. I'd be interested in how they would preserve it. I think vaginas are better alive." (There used to be a pop-up museum called "Museum of Vaginal Imagination" in Rotterdam in the Netherlands.)

For many years, the museum sought to obtain a human penis. Sigurður was able to obtain human testicles and a foreskin from two separate donors; the foreskin was donated by Iceland's National Hospital after an emergency <a href="circumcision">circumcision</a> operation. The museum also contains sculptures of 15 penises based on the <a href="Iceland%20national%20handball%20team">Iceland national handball team</a>. As the team had <a href="Handball%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20tournament">won the silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games</a>, the penises were made from a silvered material. Sigurður claims that although they are not displayed in the same order as the individuals shown in the photograph that accompanies them, "their wives would recognise them." According to "Slate", these sculptures were created by Sigurður's daughter, Þorgerður Sigurðardóttir, and were based on her own experience rather than any knowledge of the team. The team's goalkeeper denies that the sculptures are casts.

The museum has so far received pledges from four men—an Icelander, a German, an American and a Briton—to donate their penises. Canadian film-maker Zach Math comments that the American, Tom Mitchell, "is an ordinary guy but he has this quirk where he thinks of his penis as a separate entity from his body—Elmo. He has this dream that he wants it to be the most famous penis in the world." According to Sigurður, Mitchell "wanted to have his penis cut off even during his lifetime and then visit the museum." Mitchell sent a cast of his penis to serve as a substitute in the meantime, along with photographs of it dressed up as <a href="Santa%20Claus">Santa Claus</a> and <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. The donor also tattooed his penis with the <a href="Flag%20of%20the%20United%20States">Stars and Stripes</a> to make it look more appealing. He says that "I've always thought it'd be really cool for my penis to be the first true penis celebrity" and has made it the star of its own comic book, "Elmo: Adventures of a Superhero Penis".

The Icelandic donor was a 95-year-old man from nearby <a href="Akureyri">Akureyri</a> who was said to have been a womaniser in his youth and wanted to donate his penis to the museum to ensure his "eternal fame". Sigurður said that, even at the age of 95, the donor remained active, "both vertically and horizontally". However, the donor was said to be concerned that "his penis is shrinking as he gets older and he is worried it might not make a proper exhibit." His penis was given priority over those of the non-Icelandic donors in accordance with the museum's mission to display the organs of <a href="List%20of%20mammals%20of%20Iceland">Icelandic mammals</a>. Removing and preserving it was not an easy proposition, as Sigurður explained: "The donor and the doctors are in agreement, it must be taken while the body is warm. Then bleed it and pump it up. If it cools you can't do anything, so [the donor] is eager to have it taken warm and treated to be preserved with dignity."

In January 2011, the Icelandic donor died and his penis was surgically removed so that it could be added to the museum's collection. The <a href="penectomy">penectomy</a> was not entirely successful and left the penis "a greyish-brown, shrivelled mass". According to Sigurður, "I should have stretched it and sewn it at the back to keep it in more or less a normal position". Instead, it "went directly into the formaldehyde". Although disappointed with the results, Sigurður expressed confidence that "I will get a younger and a bigger and better one soon." Visitors' most common reaction to the preserved human penis is "that it's very old, you know, a bit shrunken, and the male members ["sic"] say 'oh, I hope mine will not look like this when I get old. Sigurður has considered donating his own penis to the museum when he dies but said that it depends on his wife: "If she dies first, my specimen would go in here. If I die first, well I can't say. She might say no."

American writer and actor <a href="Jonah%20Falcon">Jonah Falcon</a>, known for his impressively sized penis, was invited by the museum via "The Huffington Post" to donate his member after his death. It was announced in May 2014 that Falcon had accepted the proposal, suggesting a display alongside a sperm whale to be called "<a href="Jonah%20and%20the%20Whale">Jonah and the whale</a>", after the biblical story.

The museum is the subject of "The Final Member", a film by Canadian documentarians Zach Math and Jonah Bekhor. It profiles Sigurður and his quest to obtain a human penis for the museum, telling the story of the American and Icelandic donors and examining the quasi-taboo nature of the museum's collection. Bekhor says: "I wouldn't say it's a <a href="Rorschach%20test">Rorschach test</a>, but depending on how you react to it really says a lot about what your relationship is with that element of the human anatomy. It's a really interesting phenomenon and we're really curious to see how audiences respond." The film premiered on 1 May 2012 at the <a href="Hot%20Docs%20Canadian%20International%20Documentary%20Festival">Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival</a>.

The United States Naval Reserve (Women's Reserve), better known as the WAVES (for Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service), was the women's branch of the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Reserve">United States Naval Reserve</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. It was established on July 21, 1942 by the <a href="77th%20United%20States%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> and signed into law by President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> on July 30. This authorized the <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> to accept women into the Naval Reserve as commissioned officers and at the enlisted level, effective for the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20the%20United%20States%20during%20World%20War%20II">duration of the war</a> plus six months. The purpose of the law was to release officers and men for sea duty and replace them with women in shore establishments. <a href="Mildred%20H.%20McAfee">Mildred H. McAfee</a>, on leave as president of <a href="Wellesley%20College">Wellesley College</a>, became the first director of the WAVES. She was commissioned a <a href="lieutenant%20commander%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant commander</a> on August 3, 1942, and later promoted to <a href="commander%20%28United%20States%29">commander</a> and then to <a href="captain%20%28naval%29">captain</a>.

The notion of women serving in the Navy was not widely supported in the Congress or by the Navy, even though some of the lawmakers and naval personnel did support the need for uniformed women during World War II. Public Law 689, allowing women to serve in the Navy, was due in large measure to the efforts of the Navy's Women's Advisory Council, <a href="Margaret%20Chung">Margaret Chung,</a> and <a href="Eleanor%20Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a>, the <a href="First%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States">First Lady of the United States</a>.

To be eligible for <a href="Officer%20candidate%20school%23United%20States">officer candidate school</a>, women had to be aged 20 to 49 and possess a college degree or have two years of college and two years of equivalent professional or business experience. Volunteers at the enlisted level had to be aged 20 to 35 and possess a high school or a business diploma, or have equivalent experience. The WAVES were primarily white, but 72 <a href="African-American">African-American</a> women eventually served. The Navy's training of most WAVE officer candidates took place at <a href="Smith%20College">Smith College</a>, <a href="Northampton%2C%20Massachusetts">Northampton, Massachusetts</a>. Specialized training for officers was conducted on several college campuses and naval facilities. Most enlisted members received recruit training at <a href="Hunter%20College">Hunter College</a>, in the Bronx, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. After recruit training, some women attended specialized training courses on college campuses and at naval facilities.

The WAVES served at 900 stations in the United States. The <a href="territory%20of%20Hawaii">territory of Hawaii</a> was the only overseas station where their staff was assigned. Many female officers entered fields previously held by men, such as medicine and engineering. Enlisted women served in jobs from clerical to parachute riggers. Many women experienced workplace hostility from their male counterparts. The Navy's lack of clear-cut policies, early on, was the source of many of the difficulties. The WAVES' peak strength was 86,291 members. Upon demobilization of the officer and enlisted members, <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="James%20Forrestal">James Forrestal</a>, <a href="Fleet%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Fleet Admiral</a> <a href="Ernest%20King">Ernest King</a>, and Fleet Admiral <a href="Chester%20Nimitz">Chester Nimitz</a> all commended the WAVES for their contributions to the war effort.

In May 1941, Representative <a href="Edith%20Nourse%20Rogers">Edith Nourse Rogers</a> of <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> introduced a bill in the U.S. Congress to establish a <a href="Women%27s%20Army%20Corps">Women's Army Auxiliary Corps</a> (WAAC). As auxiliaries, women would serve with the Army rather than in it, and would be denied the benefits of their male counterparts. Opposition delayed the passage of the bill until May 1942. At the same time, the U.S. Navy's <a href="Bureau%20of%20Aeronautics">Bureau of Aeronautics</a> felt the Navy would eventually need women in uniform and had asked the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Naval%20Personnel">Bureau of Naval Personnel</a>, headed by <a href="Rear%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> Chester W. Nimitz, to propose legislation as it had done <a href="American%20women%20in%20World%20War%20I">during World War I</a>, authorizing women to serve in the Navy under the <a href="Yeoman%20%28F%29">Yeoman (F)</a> classification. Nimitz was not considered an advocate for bringing women into the Navy, and the head of the U.S. Naval Reserve expressed the view that the <a href="United%20States%20federal%20civil%20service">Civil Service</a> would be able to supply any extra personnel that might be needed.

On December 9, 1941, Representative Rogers telephoned Nimitz and asked him whether the Navy was interested in some sort of women's auxiliary corps. In her book "Lady in the Navy", <a href="Joy%20Bright%20Hancock">Joy Bright Hancock</a> quotes his reply: "I advised Mrs. Rogers that at the present time I saw no great need for such a bill". Nevertheless, within days Nimitz was in touch with all <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Navy">Navy Department</a> bureaus asking them to assess their needs for an equivalent to the WAAC. With few exceptions, the responses were negative, but Congressional inquiries about the Navy's plan for women continued to increase.
On January 2, 1942, the Bureau of Naval Personnel, in an about-face, recommended to <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="Frank%20Knox">Frank Knox</a> that Congress be asked to authorize a women's organization. The following month, Knox recommended a women's branch as part of the Naval Reserve. The director of the <a href="Bureau%20of%20the%20Budget">Bureau of the Budget</a> opposed his idea, but would agree to legislation similar to the WAAC bill – where women were with, but not in, the Navy. This was unacceptable to Knox. The Bureau of Aeronautics continued to believe there was a place for women in the Navy, and appealed to an influential friend of naval aviation named Margaret Chung. A San Francisco physician and surgeon, Chung was known to have had an interest in naval aviation. Many of her naval friends referred to themselves as sons of Mom Chung. In "Crossed Currents", the authors describe how Chung used her influence:

The Maas House bill was identical to the Knox proposal, which would make a women's branch part of the Naval Reserve. At the same time, Senator <a href="Raymond%20E.%20Willis">Raymond E. Willis</a> of <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> introduced a similar bill in the Senate. On April 16, 1942, the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">House Naval Affairs Committee</a> reported favorably on the Maas bill. It was passed by the House the same day and sent to the Senate. The <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">Senate Naval Affairs Committee</a> was opposed to the bill, especially its chairman – Senator <a href="David%20I.%20Walsh">David I. Walsh</a> of Massachusetts. He did not want women in the Navy because it "would tend to break-up American homes and would be a step backwards in the progress of civilization". The Senate committee eventually proposed a naval version of the WAAC, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved it, but Knox asked the president to reconsider.

By mid-1942, it was apparent to the Navy that women would eventually be allowed to serve. The quandary for the organization was how to administer a women's program while fashioning it to their own liking. The Navy asked women educators for assistance, first contacting <a href="Virginia%20C.%20Gildersleeve">Virginia C. Gildersleeve</a>, dean of <a href="Barnard%20College">Barnard College</a>. She suggested that Barnard professor <a href="Elizabeth%20Reynard">Elizabeth Reynard</a> become a special assistant to Rear Admiral <a href="Randall%20Jacobs">Randall Jacobs</a>, Chief of Naval Personnel. Reynard was well known for her academic work on women in the workplace. She quickly formed the Women's Advisory Council to meet with Navy officials. Gildersleeve became the chairperson, and because of her efforts several prominent women agreed to serve on the council. They included:

The council knew the success of the program would depend on the woman chosen to lead it. A prospective candidate would need to possess proven managerial skills, command respect, and have an ability to get along with others. Their recommendation was <a href="Mildred%20H.%20McAfee">Mildred H. McAfee</a>, president of Wellesley College, as the future director. The Navy agreed. McAfee was an experienced and respected academician, whose background would provide a measure of credibility to the idea of women serving in the Navy. The task of convincing McAfee to accept and persuading the Wellesley Board of Trustees to release her was difficult, but eventually she was freed.

Reynard, who was later commissioned a lieutenant in the WAVES and rose to <a href="commander%20%28United%20States%29">commander</a>, was tasked with selecting a name:

On May 25, 1942, the Senate Naval Affairs Committee recommended to the president that the legislation to create a women's reserve for the U.S. Navy should parallel that of the original WAAC legislation, which decreed that women would serve with the Army rather than in it. The president called on Knox to reconsider his position, but Knox stood his ground. Advisory Council members Gildersleeve and Elliott each took it on themselves to write to the <a href="First%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States">First Lady</a>, <a href="Eleanor%20Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a>, explaining their objections to the WAAC legislation. Roosevelt showed Elliott's letter to her husband, the president, and she sent Gildersleeve's letter on to the <a href="Undersecretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Undersecretary of the Navy</a>, <a href="James%20V.%20Forrestal">James V. Forrestal</a>, a former naval aviator. Within days Forrestal replied, saying that Secretary Knox had asked the president to reconsider. On June 16, Knox informed Rear Admiral Jacobs that the president had given him authority to proceed with a women's reserve.

Days later, Knox informed Senator Walsh of the president's decision, and on June 24 the Senate Naval Affairs Committee reported favorably on the bill. By July 21, the bill had passed both houses of Congress and been sent to the president, who signed it on July 30 as Public Law 689. This created the women's branch of the Navy reserve, as amended under Title V of the U.S. Naval Reserve Act of 1938. Less than a year later, on July 1, 1943, Congress refashioned the WAAC into the Women's Army Corps (WAC), which provided its members with similar military status as the WAVES.

The law was enacted to free up officers and men for duty at sea and to replace them with WAVES at shore stations on the home front. Women could now serve in the Navy as an officer or at an enlisted level, with a rank or rate consistent with that of the regular Navy. Volunteers could only serve for the duration of the war plus six months, and only in the continental United States. They were prohibited from boarding <a href="naval%20ship">naval ship</a>s or <a href="naval%20aviation">combat aircraft</a>, and were without command authority, except within the women's branch.

McAfee became the first director of the WAVES. She was commissioned a lieutenant commander on August 3, 1942 and was the first woman officer in the U.S. Naval Reserve. She was later promoted to the rank of captain. In "More Than a Uniform", <a href="Winifred%20Quick%20Collins">Winifred Quick Collins</a> (a former WAVE officer) described Director McAfee as a born diplomat, handling difficult matters with finesse. She added that McAfee played an important role in the development of policies such as how the women would be treated compared to the men with respect to assignments they would take, as well as their housing conditions, supervision, and discipline standards.

In establishing the office of the director, the Bureau of Personnel did not define the responsibilities of the office, nor establish clear lines of authority. The bureau told McAfee "that she was to 'run' the women's reserve, and she was to go directly to the Chief of Naval Personnel for answers to her questions", but the decision was not made known to the operating divisions of the bureau." No planning had been done in anticipation of the Women's Reserve Act. For guidance, McAfee turned to Joy Bright Hancock, a Navy Yeoman (F) during World War I, and a career writer and editor for the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics. Hancock was asked to examine the procedures employed by the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force%20Women%27s%20Division">Women's Division of the Royal Canadian Air Force</a>, which had a complement of 6,000 members. Many of her findings were later used by the WAVES.

By September 1942, another 108 women were commissioned as officers in the WAVES, selected for their educational and business backgrounds. They were drawn to the program by the Advisory Council and McAfee's reputation. Four of these women would later become the directors of the WAVES and the director of the <a href="SPARS">SPARS</a> (U.S. Coast Guard Women's Reserve). The new officers began their work routine with no grasp of Navy traditions, or training in the service's operating methods, which resulted in some difficulties. On September 16, the Bureau of Personnel issued a memorandum for the organization of the Women's Reserve, specifying that the director would administer the program, set policies, and coordinate work within the bureau's operating divisions. Soon, McAfee was able to bring together a capable staff, building a sound internal organization.

The WAVES officers were first assigned to recruiting stations in U.S. naval districts; later they were joined by enlisted personnel with recruiter training. The primary sources of publicity used were radio, newspapers, posters, brochures, and personal contacts. The focus of their advertising campaign was patriotism and the need for women to free up men for overseas duty. McAfee demanded good taste in all advertising, determined to cast the WAVES in a ladylike fashion. She said, "Advertising must appeal to conservative parents, schools, and churches as well as to the young women themselves." At the end of 1942, there were 770 officers and 3,109 enlisted women in the WAVES. By July 3, 1945, their ranks had risen to 86,291, which included 8,475 officers, 73,816 enlisted, and about 4,000 in training.

The age requirement for officer candidates was 20 to 49. They had to possess a college degree, or have two years of college and two years of equivalent professional or business experience. The age requirement for enlisted personnel was 20 to 35. They had to possess a high school or a business diploma, or have equivalent experience. U.S. citizenship was required in all cases. The WAVES were primarily white (and middle class) and they represented every state in the country. The greatest numbers of WAVES came from <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, Massachusetts, and <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>.

The legislation that established the WAVES was silent with respect to race, but Knox said that black WAVES would be enlisted "over his dead body". After Knox's death in April 1944, his successor Forrestal moved to reform the <a href="Racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States%20Armed%20Forces%23United%20States%20Navy">Navy's racial policies</a>, and on July 28 he submitted to the president a proposal to accept WAVES on an integrated basis. Aware that 1944 was an election year, Forrestal tried to compromise by offering segregated living quarters and mess facilities, but Roosevelt decided to hold it up until after the <a href="1944%20United%20States%20elections">election on November 7</a>. The Republican candidate, <a href="Thomas%20E.%20Dewey">Thomas E. Dewey</a>, criticized the administration for discriminating against African-American women during a speech in Chicago. On October 19, 1944, Roosevelt instructed the Navy to accept African-American women into the WAVES.

The first African-American WAVES officers were Lieutenant Harriet Ida Pickens and Ensign Frances Wills, who were commissioned on December 21, 1944. The recruitment of African-American women began the following week. The plan for segregated quarters was impractical, because each recruit company contained 250 women and there were insufficient recruits to form an entire African-American company. McAfee appealed to Forrestal and he dropped the segregation requirement. By July 1945, some 72 African-American WAVES had undergone recruit training. While training was integrated, African-American WAVES experienced some restrictions, such as specialty assignments and living accommodations, which were segregated on some bases. Those who stayed in the WAVES after the war were employed without discrimination, but only five remained by August 1946.

The WAVES' uniforms were designed by the New York fashion house of <a href="Mainbocher">Mainbocher</a>; their services were secured (without cost) through the efforts of Josephine Forrestal, a former fashion editor at <a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">"Vogue"</a> and the wife of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. The winter uniform was made from navy blue wool, worn with a white shirt and dark blue tie. The jacket was single-breasted and unbelted, with a six-gored skirt. Included were black <a href="Oxford%20shoe">Oxford shoe</a>s and cap and plain black pumps, a brimmed hat, black gloves, black leather purse, and rain and winter coats. The summer uniform was similar to the winter uniform but lighter in weight, made of white material, and worn with white shoes. Later, a gray-and-white-striped <a href="seersucker">seersucker</a> work uniform for summer was added, and slacks and dungarees could be worn when appropriate.

The Navy chose Smith College at Northampton, Massachusetts as the training site for WAVE officers. The facility offered much of what the Navy needed, and a college setting provided an appropriate training environment. Smith was nicknamed USS Northampton, although the official name of the training station was the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Reserve%20Midshipmen%27s%20School">United States Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School</a>. Captain Herbert W. Underwood was recalled to active duty on August 13, 1942, and appointed commanding officer of the School. Underwood had a distinguished naval career and received the <a href="Navy%20Cross">Navy Cross</a> during World War I. In "Lady in the Navy", Joy Bright Hancock described Underwood as intelligent, enthusiastic, and good humored, and serious of purpose.

Underwood and his staff quickly developed the curriculum that would hasten the transformation of civilian women into naval officers. The curriculum included: organization; personnel; naval history and law; ships and aircraft; naval communications and correspondence. There would be two months of intensive training. This was too short a period to produce a fully trained naval officer, but the objective was to prepare the candidates with a basic understanding of the naval environment, while stressing administrative policy. It was the type of work that most officers would eventually be doing. The curriculum did not change much over the life of the training program.

Following their training, the midshipmen were commissioned as <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">ensigns</a> in the women's branch of the U.S. Naval Reserve and in the Women's branch of the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve (<a href="SPARS">SPARS</a>), or as <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a>s in the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20Women%27s%20Reserve">United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve</a>. The midshipmen included 203 SPARS and 295 women of the Marine Corps Women's Reserve.
The school closed in December 1944, after accepting 10,181 women and graduating 9,477 of them. Many of these commissioned officers were sent to specialized schools for training in communications, supply, the Japanese language, meteorology, and engineering. The courses of study were held on the college campuses of <a href="Mount%20Holyoke%20College">Mount Holyoke College</a>; <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>; the <a href="University%20of%20Colorado">University of Colorado</a>; the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>; the <a href="University%20of%20California">University of California</a>; and the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>. The <a href="Bureau%20of%20Ordnance">Bureau of Ordnance</a> also opened its schools to WAVE officers, where some of them studied <a href="aviation%20ordnance">aviation ordnance</a>. Other officers attended the Naval Air Technical Training Command Schools in <a href="Corpus%20Christi%2C%20Texas">Corpus Christi, Texas</a>, and <a href="Hollywood%2C%20Florida">Hollywood, Florida</a>, to train as <a href="air%20navigation">air navigation</a> instructions. Unlike the training on the college campuses, the training offered at these facilities was coeducational.

The Navy selected the campuses of <a href="Oklahoma%20A%26amp%3BM%20College">Oklahoma A&M College</a>, <a href="Indiana%20University%20Bloomington">Indiana University</a>, and the <a href="University%20of%20Wisconsin">University of Wisconsin</a> for both recruit and specialized training of enlisted WAVES. The training for the initial groups of enlisted women began on October 9, 1942. It soon became clear that these arrangements were unsuitable for recruit training, because of dispersed training facilities, inexperienced instructors, and the lack of "esprit de corps". As a result, the Navy decided to establish one recruit training center on the campus of the <a href="Iowa%20State%20Teachers%20College">Iowa State Teachers College</a>.

Captain Randall Davis was named commanding officer of the center. He arrived on December 1, 1942, two weeks before the first class of 1,050 enlisted recruits were to start their five weeks of basic training. The training routine began weekday mornings with classes and drill, and repeated in the afternoon. Free time in the evening, followed by study or instruction until <a href="Taps">Taps</a>. Saturday morning was the Captain's Inspection, with free time the rest of the day. On Sunday, church services and free time until evening, then study hours until Taps.

On December 30, 1942, the Navy announced that recruits in training and all future recruits would be trained at Hunter College in <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a>, New York City. Hunter College was chosen because of its space, location, ease of transportation, and the willingness of the college to make its facilities available. Captain William F. Amsden, also a recipient of the Navy Cross in World War I, was named the commanding officer. On February 8, 1943, the college was commissioned the U.S. Naval Training Center, the Bronx, and became known as USS Hunter. Nine days later, approximately 2,000 recruits began their six weeks of training.
The boot camp training objectives for the women were intended to be similar to those of the men. The range of instruction included: Navy ranks and rate; ships and aircraft of the fleet; naval traditions and customs; naval history; and emphasis on physical fitness. Between February 17, 1943 and October 10, 1945, some 80,936 WAVES, 1,844 SPARS, and 3,190 women Marines completed the training course. The SPARS and Marine reservists used the Navy's training center until the summer of 1943, at which time they established their own training centers.

Of the graduating classes at Hunter, 83% went on to specialized schools to train as yeomen, radio operators, storekeepers, and cooks and bakers. The enlisted WAVES trained at <a href="Georgia%20State%20College%20for%20Women">Georgia State College for Women</a> in Milledgeville, Burdett College in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, and <a href="Miami%20University">Miami University</a> in <a href="Oxford%2C%20Ohio">Oxford, Ohio</a>. The Bureaus of Aeronautics and Medicine opened their doors to the enlisted WAVES. The training in aeronautics took place at naval air stations and training centers; the training for medical technicians was held at the National Medical and <a href="Naval%20Station%20Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> Training Centers. These facilities were also coeducational.

The WAVES served in 900 shore stations in the continental United States. Initially, they were prohibited from serving on ships or outside of the country. In September 1944, the Congress amended the law by allowing the WAVES to volunteer for service in the territories of <a href="Territory%20of%20Alaska">Alaska</a> and Hawaii. Hawaii was the only overseas station staffed with the WAVES on a permanent basis. The officers were employed in such professions as doctors, attorneys, engineers, mathematicians, and chaplains. One WAVE mathematician, <a href="Grace%20Hopper">Grace Hopper</a>, was assigned to Harvard University to work on the computation project with the <a href="Harvard%20Mark%20I">Mark I computer</a>. Elsa Gardner became the only female nautical engineer in the entire U.S. Navy. Most enlisted WAVES worked in jobs traditionally performed by women, such as clerical work, health care, or storekeeping. A few took over jobs typically held by men, in occupations like aviation machinists, aviation metalsmiths, parachute riggers, control tower operators, radio operators, yeomen, or statisticians.

The WAVES practiced their professions and applied their skills at many naval bureaus and stations in the United States. The Washington, D.C. area had the largest complement of WAVES; some 20,000 women made up 55 percent of the Navy's personnel. The WAVES were responsible for 75 percent of the encoding and decoding of messages in the <a href="Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations%23Office%20of%20the%20Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Office of Naval Operations</a>. In the Bureau of Naval Personnel, the women made up 70 percent of the staff. In Postal Affairs, they handled 80 percent of the Navy's mail service. About 13,000 WAVES served in the <a href="Hospital%20corpsman">Navy Hospital Corps</a>, working in naval hospitals, stations, and dispensaries. The Bureau of Aeronautics utilized 23,000 women in Washington D.C. and around the country. The Navy used 100 WAVES as weather forecasters at naval air stations. The Bureau of Aeronautics trained and assigned them to work in gunnery instruction, navigation, and traffic control. The Bureau of Ordnance used them primarily as mathematicians and technicians. Other bureaus utilized the WAVES on a much smaller scale. By the end of the war, 18% of the naval personnel assigned to shore stations were WAVES.

The mission of the WAVES was to replace the men in shore stations for sea duty, which led to some hostility from those who did not wish to be released. Sometimes the hostility was tacit, other times it was out in the open. In "Crossed Currents", Ebbert and Hall recount a situation where a male officer upon greeting the WAVES officer about to work for him, told her that she was not wanted. When she asked him where her group was to be quartered, he told her that it was her problem. It was not always hostile behavior that was experienced; sometimes the women were assigned roles to which they were not physically suited. Ebbert and Hall provide an example where "...two husky enlisted men reasoned that if the women sent to replace them could not do the job, then the men could keep those jobs and avoid being sent to sea. They told the women, 'get those truck tires stowed properly in the loft, and then went off to lunch, sure the women could barely lift the tires. But they returned to find the tires stowed properly. The women had rigged a pulley." In other cases, due to the contradictory attitudes of their male superiors, the women were underutilized in relation to their training, and often were only tasked out of dire need. Conversely, once the commanding officers found that they had women who proved they could properly replace the men who were not available, their prejudices were often set aside.

Many young women joined the WAVES out of patriotism or family tradition. Others were motivated by adventure, professional development, or the experience of life in the military or on college campuses.

Seven WAVE officers and 62 enlisted women died during the war. Many WAVES were acknowledged for their contributions to the country. The <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Medal%20%28US%20Navy%29">Distinguished Service Medal</a> was awarded to Captain McAfee for her efforts as Director of the WAVES, and Commander Reynard received a letter of commendation from the Secretary of the Navy for her work in developing the WAVES training program. Two of the WAVES received the <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a>, three the <a href="Bronze%20Star">Bronze Star</a>, eighteen the Secretary of the Navy's letter of commendation, and one, the <a href="Army%20Commendation%20Medal">Army Commendation Medal</a>. Almost all of the WAVES looked upon their service as beneficial and many said they would serve again under the same situation.

At the end of the war, the Navy established five separation centers for the demobilization of the WAVES and for the Navy nurses. These were located in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis</a>, San Francisco, <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, and New York. The separation process began on October 1, 1945, and within a month about 9,000 of the WAVES had been separated. By the end of 1946, almost 21,000 more had been discharged. It soon became apparent that more centers were needed, and ten more were opened. By September 1946, the demobilization of the WAVES was all but complete. Most women spent two or three days at the separation centers before being discharged to get physical exams, orientation on rights as veterans, final settlement of pay, and then the price of a ticket home. At the time, it was not clear whether the demobilization meant phasing the women out of the military services altogether.

Although a small contingent of WAVES was retained to help with the Navy's over-all demobilization plan, many of these women had volunteered to remain on active duty. At that point, Vice Admiral <a href="Louis%20Denfeld">Louis Denfeld</a>, chief of the Bureau of Personnel, announced, "Our plan is to keep a WAVE component in the Naval Reserve. Further, if <a href="80th%20United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> approves, we will seek to retain on active duty a reasonable number of WAVES who wish to do so and who may be needed in certain specialties ..." On July 30, 1948, the <a href="Women%27s%20Armed%20Services%20Integration%20Act">Women's Armed Services Integration Act</a> (Public Law 625) was signed into law by President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>, allowing the women to serve in the regular Army or Navy on a permanent basis. The wartime prohibition of women serving in any unit having a combat mission was carried over into the 1948 Act. While the legislation was an extraordinary advancement for women, it effectively kept them from being integrated into the mainstream of the military for more than a quarter of a century. Though the WAVES no longer existed, the obsolete acronym continued in popular and official usage until the 1970s.

With the demobilization, the WAVES received accolades from senior personnel. Secretary of the Navy Forrestal wrote, "Your conduct, discharge of military responsibilities, and skillful work are in the highest tradition of the naval service." Fleet Admiral King said, "The Navy has learned to appreciate the women ... for their discipline, their skill, and their contribution to high morale ... Our greatest tribute to these women is the request for more WAVES". Fleet Admiral Nimitz added that "they have demonstrated qualities of competence, energy and loyalty". Ebbert and Hall contend that the WAVES' accomplishments helped to secure a place for the women in the regular Navy.

Elizabeth Ender and Betty St. Clair wrote "WAVES of the Navy" in 1943. It was written to harmonize with "<a href="Anchors%20Aweigh">Anchors Aweigh</a>".

Fantastic (magazine)

Fantastic was an American <a href="digest%20size">digest-size</a> <a href="fantasy%20fiction%20magazine">fantasy</a> and <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a>, published from 1952 to 1980. It was founded by the publishing company <a href="Ziff%20Davis">Ziff Davis</a> as a fantasy companion to "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>". Early sales were good, and the company quickly decided to switch "Amazing" from <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp</a> format to digest, and to cease publication of their other science fiction pulp, "<a href="Fantastic%20Adventures">Fantastic Adventures</a>". Within a few years sales fell, and <a href="Howard%20Browne">Howard Browne</a>, the editor, was forced to switch the focus to science fiction rather than fantasy. Browne lost interest in the magazine as a result and the magazine generally ran poor-quality fiction in the mid-1950s, under Browne and his successor, <a href="Paul%20W.%20Fairman">Paul W. Fairman</a>.

At the end of the 1950s, <a href="Cele%20Goldsmith">Cele Goldsmith</a> took over as editor of both "Fantastic" and "Amazing Stories", and quickly invigorated the magazines, bringing in many new writers and making them, in the words of one science fiction historian, the "best-looking and brightest" magazines in the field. Goldsmith helped to nurture the early careers of writers such as <a href="Roger%20Zelazny">Roger Zelazny</a> and <a href="Ursula%20K.%20Le%20Guin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>, but was unable to increase circulation, and in 1965 the magazines were sold to <a href="Sol%20Cohen">Sol Cohen</a>, who hired Joseph Wrzos as editor and switched to a <a href="reprint">reprint</a>-only policy. This was financially successful, but brought Cohen into conflict with the newly formed <a href="Science%20Fiction%20Writers%20of%20America">Science Fiction Writers of America</a>. After a turbulent period at the end of the 1960s, <a href="Ted%20White%20%28author%29">Ted White</a> became editor and the reprints were phased out.

White worked hard to make the magazine successful, introducing artwork from artists who had made their names in comics, and working with new authors such as Gordon Eklund. His budget for fiction was low, but he was occasionally able to find good stories from well-known writers that had been rejected by other markets. Circulation continued to decline, however, and in 1978, Cohen sold out his half of the business to his partner, Arthur Bernhard. White resigned shortly afterwards, and was replaced by <a href="Elinor%20Mavor">Elinor Mavor</a>, but within two years Bernhard decided to close down "Fantastic", merging it with "Amazing Stories", which had always enjoyed a slightly higher circulation.

In 1938, <a href="Ziff%20Davis">Ziff Davis</a>, a Chicago-based publisher looking to expand into the <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> market, acquired "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>". The number of science fiction magazines grew quickly, and several new titles appeared over the next few years, among them "<a href="Fantastic%20Adventures">Fantastic Adventures</a>", which was launched by Ziff Davis in 1939 as a companion to "Amazing". Under the editorship of <a href="Raymond%20Palmer">Raymond Palmer</a>, the magazines were reasonably successful but published poor-quality work; when <a href="Howard%20Browne">Howard Browne</a> took over as editor of "Amazing" in January 1950, he decided to try to move the magazine upmarket. Ziff Davis agreed to back the new magazine, and Browne put together a sample copy, but, when the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> broke out, Ziff Davis cut their budgets and the project was abandoned. Browne did not give up, and in 1952 received the go-ahead to try a new magazine instead, focused on high-quality fantasy, a genre which had recently become more popular. The first issue of "Fantastic", dated Summer 1952, appeared on March 21 of that year.

Sales were very good, and Ziff Davis was sufficiently impressed after only two issues to move the magazine from a quarterly to a bimonthly schedule, and to switch "Amazing" from pulp format to digest-size to match "Fantastic". Shortly afterwards the decision was taken to eliminate "<a href="Fantastic%20Adventures">Fantastic Adventures</a>": the March 1953 issue was the last, and the May–June 1953 issue of "Fantastic" added a mention of "Fantastic Adventures" to the masthead, though this ceased with the following issue. Payment started at two cents per word for all rights, but could go up to ten cents at the editor's discretion; this put "Fantastic" in the second echelon of magazines, behind titles such as "Astounding" and "Galaxy". The experiment with quality fiction did not last. Circulation dropped, which led to budget cuts, and in turn the quality of the fiction fell. Browne had wanted to separate "Fantastic" from "Amazing"s pulp roots, but now found he had to print more science fiction (sf) and less fantasy in order to attract "Amazing"s readers to its sister magazine. "Fantastic"s poor results were probably a consequence of an overloaded sf-magazine market: far more magazines appeared in the early 1950s than the market was able to support. Ziff Davis sales staff were able to help sell "Fantastic" and "Amazing" along with the technical magazines that it published, and the availability of a national sales network, even though it was not focused solely on "Fantastic", undoubtedly helped the magazine to survive.

In May 1956, Browne left Ziff Davis to become a screenwriter. <a href="Paul%20W.%20Fairman">Paul W. Fairman</a> took over as editor of both "Fantastic" and "Amazing". In 1957, <a href="Bernard%20George%20Davis">Bernard Davis</a> left Ziff Davis; it had been Davis who had suggested the acquisition of "Amazing" in 1939, and he had stayed involved with the sf magazines throughout the time he spent there. With his departure "Amazing" and "Fantastic" stagnated; they were still issued monthly, but drew no attention from the management of Ziff Davis.

In November 1955, Ziff Davis hired an assistant, <a href="Cele%20Goldsmith">Cele Goldsmith</a>, who began by helping with two new magazines under development, "Dream World" and "Pen Pals". She also read the <a href="slush%20pile">slush pile</a>s for all the magazines, and was quickly given more responsibility. In 1957, she was made managing editor of both "Amazing" and "Fantastic", doing administrative chores and reading unsolicited manuscripts. At the end of 1958, she became editor, replacing Fairman, who had left to become managing editor of "<a href="Ellery%20Queen%27s%20Mystery%20Magazine">Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine</a>". Goldsmith—who became Cele Lalli when she married in 1964—stayed as editor for six and a half years.

Circulation dropped for both "Amazing" and "Fantastic": in 1964, "Fantastic" had a paid circulation of only 27,000. In 1965, <a href="Sol%20Cohen">Sol Cohen</a>, who at that time was "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction">Galaxy</a>"s publisher, set up his own publishing company, Ultimate Publishing, and bought both "Amazing" and "Fantastic" from Ziff Davis. Cohen had decided to make the magazines as profitable as possible by filling them only with reprints. This was possible because Ziff Davis had acquired second serial rights for all stories they had published, and since Cohen had bought the backfile of stories he was able to reprint them using these rights. Using reprints in this way saved Cohen about a year between the two magazines. Lalli decided that she did not want to work for Cohen, and stayed with Ziff Davis. Her last issue was June 1965. Cohen replaced Lalli with Joseph Wrzos, who used the name "Joseph Ross" on the magazines. Cohen had met Wrzos at the "Galaxy" offices not long before; Wrzos was teaching English full-time, but had worked for <a href="Gnome%20Press">Gnome Press</a> as an assistant editor in 1953–1954.

Cohen also launched a series of reprint magazines, drawing from the backfile of both "Amazing" and "Fantastic", again using the second serial rights he had acquired from Ziff Davis. The first reprint magazine was "<a href="Great%20Science%20Fiction%20%28magazine%29">Great Science Fiction</a>"; the first issue, titled "Great Science Fiction from Amazing", appeared in August 1965. By early 1967 this had been joined by "<a href="The%20Most%20Thrilling%20Science%20Fiction%20Ever%20Told">The Most Thrilling Science Fiction Ever Told</a>" and "<a href="Science%20Fiction%20Classics">Science Fiction Classics</a>". These increased the workload on Wrzos, though Cohen made the selection of stories, and Wrzos found himself able to work on "Fantastic" and "Amazing" only part-time. Cohen hired Herb Lehrman to help with the other magazines.

Although Cohen felt that his deal with Ziff Davis gave him the reprint rights he needed, the newly formed <a href="Science%20Fiction%20and%20Fantasy%20Writers%20of%20America">Science Fiction Writers of America</a> (SFWA) received complaints about Cohen's refusal to pay anything for the reprints. He was also reportedly not responding to requests for reassignment of copyright. SFWA organized a boycott of Cohen's magazines; after a year Cohen agreed to pay a flat fee for the reprints, and in August 1967 he agreed to a graduated scale of payments, and the boycott was withdrawn.

Like his immediate predecessors, White took the job on condition that the reprints would be phased out. It was some time before this was achieved: there was at least one reprinted story in every issue until the end of 1971. The February 1972 issue contained some artwork reprinted from 1939, and after that the reprints ceased.

"Fantastic"s circulation was about 37,000 when White took over; only about 4 percent of this was subscription sales. Cohen's wife filled the subscriptions from their garage, and according to White, Cohen regarded this as a burden, and never tried to increase the subscription base. Despite White's efforts, "Fantastic"s circulation fell, from almost 37,000 when he took over as editor to less than 24,000 in the summer of 1975. Cohen was rumored to be interested in selling both "Fantastic" and "Amazing"; among other possibilities, both <a href="Roger%20Elwood">Roger Elwood</a>, at that time an active science fiction anthology editor, and <a href="Edward%20Ferman">Edward Ferman</a>, the editor of "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction</a>", approached Cohen with a view to acquiring the titles. Nothing came of it, however, and White was not aware of the possible sales. He was working at a low salary, with unpaid help from friends to read unsolicited submissions—at one point he introduced a 25-cent reading fee for manuscripts from unpublished writers; the fee would be refunded if White bought the story. White sometimes found himself at odds with Cohen's business partner, Arthur Bernhard, due to their different political views. White's unhappiness with his working conditions culminated in his resignation after Cohen refused his proposal to publish "Fantastic" as a <a href="slick%20magazine">slick magazine</a>, with larger pages and higher quality paper. White commented in an article in "<a href="Science%20Fiction%20Review">Science Fiction Review</a>" that he had brought to the magazines "a lot of energy and enthusiasm and a great many ideas for their improvement ...Well, I have put into effect nearly every idea which I was allowed to follow through on ... and have spent most of my energy and enthusiasm." Cohen was able to persuade him to stay for another year; in the event White stayed for another three.

White was unable to completely halt the slide in circulation, though it rose a little in 1977. That year Cohen lost $15,000 on the magazines, and decided to sell. He spent some time looking for a new publisher—editor <a href="Roy%20Torgeson">Roy Torgeson</a> was one of those interested—but on September 15, 1978, he sold his half of the business to Arthur Bernhard, his partner. White renewed his suggestions for improving the format of the magazine: he wanted to make "Fantastic" the same size as "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>", and believed he could avoid the mistakes that had been made by other sf magazines that had tried that approach. White also proposed an increase in the budget and asked for a raise. Bernhard not only turned down White's ideas, but also stopped paying him: White responded by resigning. His last official day as editor was November 9; the last issue of "Fantastic" under his control was the January 1979 issue. He returned all submissions to their authors, saying that he had been told to do so by Bernhard; Bernhard denied this.

Bernhard brought in <a href="Elinor%20Mavor">Elinor Mavor</a> to edit both "Amazing" and "Fantastic". Mavor had previously edited "Bill of Fare", a restaurant trade journal, and was a long-time science fiction reader, but she had little knowledge of the history of the magazines. She was unaware, for example, that she was not the first woman to edit them, and so adopted a male pseudonym—"Omar Gohagen"—for a while. She suggested a campaign to increase circulation, and went so far as to gather information about costs while on a trip to New York in 1979. Bernhard decided instead to merge the two magazines. Circulation was continuing to drop; the figures for the last two years are not available, but sf historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a> estimates that "Fantastic"'s paid circulation may have been as low as 13,000. Bernhard felt that since "Fantastic" had never been profitable, whereas "Amazing" had made money, it was best to keep "Amazing". Until the March 1985 issue, "Amazing" included a mention of "Fantastic" on the spine and on the contents page. In 1999, the fiction magazine formerly known as "<a href="Pirate%20Writings">Pirate Writings</a>" revived the "Fantastic" title and Cele Goldsmith-era logotype for several issues, ultimately unsuccessfully, though this was not intended as a continuation of the original magazine.

In August 2014, <a href="Warren%20Lapine">Warren Lapine</a>, former editor of "Absolute Magnitude", "Realms of Fantasy", and "Weird Tales", revived the "Fantastic" logotype of "Fantastic Stories of the Imagination" as a free webzine.

The first issue of "Fantastic" was impressive, with a cover that sf historian Mike Ashley has described as "one of the most captivating of all first issues"; the painting, by Barye Phillips and <a href="Leo%20Summers">Leo Summers</a>, illustrated <a href="Kris%20Neville">Kris Neville</a>'s "The Opal Necklace". The fiction included some stories by well known names; in particular, <a href="Raymond%20Chandler">Raymond Chandler</a>'s "Professor Bingo's Snuff" would have caught readers' eyes—the story had appeared the year before in "<a href="Park%20East%20%28magazine%29">Park East</a>" magazine, but would have been new to most readers. It was a short mystery in which the fantasy element was invisibility, achieved by magical snuff. <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> and <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> also contributed stories, and the issue led with "Six and Ten Are Johnny", by <a href="Walter%20M.%20Miller">Walter M. Miller</a>. The rear cover reprinted <a href="Pierre%20Roy%20%28painter%29">Pierre Roy</a>'s painting "Danger on the Stairs", which depicted a snake on a staircase; it was an odd choice, but subsequent back covers were more natural fits for a fantasy magazine. The quality of the fiction continued to be high for the first year; sf historian Mike Ashley comments that almost every story in the first seven issues was of high quality, and historian David Kyle regards it as an "outstandingly successful experiment". Science fiction bibliographer <a href="Donald%20H.%20Tuck">Donald Tuck</a> dissents, however, regarding the first few years as containing "little of note", and <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a> wrote a contemporary review of the second issue which found it lacking: Blish dismissed three of the seven stories in the Fall 1952 issue as being essentially crime stories written for the sf market, and commented that of the remaining four, only two were "reasonably competent and craftsmanlike".

Other well-known writers appeared in the early issues, including <a href="Shirley%20Jackson">Shirley Jackson</a>, <a href="B.%20Traven">B. Traven</a>, <a href="Truman%20Capote">Truman Capote</a> and <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>. <a href="Mickey%20Spillane">Mickey Spillane</a> had written a story called "The Woman With Green Skin", but had been unable to sell it; Browne offered to buy it on condition that he had permission to rewrite it as he wished. This was agreed and Browne scrapped Spillane's text completely, writing a new story called "The Veiled Woman" and publishing it as by Spillane in the November–December 1952 issue. The issue sold so well it was reprinted, with over 300,000 copies sold.

The emphasis was on fantasy, and much of it was "slick" fantasy—the sort of genre fiction that the upmarket slick magazines, such as "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Evening%20Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>", were willing to buy. Some science fiction appeared as well in the first couple of years, including Isaac Asimov's "Sally", which portrays a world in which cars have been given robotic brains and are intelligent. In 1955 it was decided to move the focus from fantasy to sf: in Browne's words, "Stories of straight fantasy were largely eliminated and straight science-fiction substituted, cover subject matter became of a scientific nature, the words "science fiction" appeared under the title, interior artwork was tightened up to replace the loose, 'arty' kind of drawing we had been using." Sales rose 17% within two issues. Browne was uninterested in science fiction, however, and the quality of the fiction soon dropped, with a small stable of writers producing much of "Fantastic"s fiction under house names over the next couple of years. By the start of 1956 the fiction in "Fantastic" was, in the opinion of sf historian Mike Ashley, "[in] a trough of hack predictability", but there was some inventiveness evident from newer writers such as <a href="Robert%20Silverberg">Robert Silverberg</a>, <a href="Harlan%20Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a> and <a href="Randall%20Garrett">Randall Garrett</a>.

Although Browne had been unable to make "Fantastic" successful by specializing in fantasy, he was still interested in the fantasy genre, and experimented in the December 1955 issue with the theme of wish fulfilment. He dropped the words "Science Fiction" from the cover, and published five stories, all of which dealt with male fantasies in one form or another. The cover showed a man walking through a wall to find a woman undressing; the art was by Ed Valigursky and illustrated Paul Fairman's "All Walls Were Mist". Reader reaction, according to Browne, was almost entirely favorable, and he continued to publish occasional stories on the wish-fulfilment theme. The experiment was repeated with the October 1956 issue, which again ran without "Science Fiction" on the cover, and contained stories on the theme of "Incredible Powers". Once again the cover illustrated a male fantasy: this time it showed a man materializing in a bath house where women were showering. Browne had left Ziff Davis by the time this issue appeared, but Browne's plans for a magazine around these themes were well advanced, and Fairman, who by this time was editing both "Fantastic" and "Amazing", was given "Dream World" to edit as well. It ran for three quarterly issues, starting in February 1957, but proved too narrow a market to succeed.

Fairman devoted the July 1958 issue of "Fantastic" to the Shaver Mystery—a lurid set of beliefs propounded by <a href="Richard%20Sharpe%20Shaver">Richard Shaver</a> in the late 1940s that told of "detrimental robots", or "deros", who were behind many of the disasters that befell humanity. Most of these stories had run in "Amazing", though the editor at that time, Ray Palmer, had been forced to drop Shaver by Ziff Davis when the stories began to attract ridicule in the press. "Fantastic" readers were no kinder, complaining vigorously.

When Goldsmith took over as editor, there was some concern at Ziff Davis that she might not be able to handle the job. A consultant, Norman Lobsenz, was brought in to help her; Lobsenz's title was "editorial director", but in fact Goldsmith made the story selections. Lobsenz provided blurbs and editorials, read the stories Goldsmith bought, and met with Goldsmith every week or so. Goldsmith was not a long-time sf reader, and knew little about the field; she simply looked for good quality fiction and bought what she liked. In Mike Ashley's words, "the result, between 1961 and 1964, was the two most exciting and original magazines in the field". New writers whose first story appeared in "Fantastic" during this period included <a href="Phyllis%20Gotlieb">Phyllis Gotlieb</a>, <a href="Larry%20Eisenberg">Larry Eisenberg</a>, <a href="Ursula%20K.%20Le%20Guin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>, <a href="Thomas%20M.%20Disch">Thomas M. Disch</a>, and <a href="Piers%20Anthony">Piers Anthony</a>. The November 1959 issue was dedicated to <a href="Fritz%20Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a>; it included "Lean Times in Lankhmar", one of Leiber's <a href="Fafhrd%20and%20the%20Gray%20Mouser">Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser</a> stories. Goldsmith published another half-dozen stories in the series over the next six years, along with other similar (and sometimes imitative) fiction such as early work by Michael Moorcock, and John Jakes' early stories of Brak the Barbarian. This helped to invigorate the nascent <a href="sword%20and%20sorcery">sword and sorcery</a> subgenre. Goldsmith obtained an early story by <a href="Cordwainer%20Smith">Cordwainer Smith</a>, "The Fife of Bodidharma", which ran in the June 1959 issue, but shortly thereafter Pohl at "Galaxy" reached an agreement to get first refusal on all Smith's work.

During the early 1960s Goldsmith managed to make "Fantastic" and "Amazing", in the words of Mike Ashley, "the best-looking and brightest" magazines around. This applied both to the covers, where Goldsmith used artists such as <a href="Alex%20Schomburg">Alex Schomburg</a> and Leo Summers, and the content. Ashley also describes Fantastic as the "premier fantasy magazine" during Goldsmith's tenure—at that time the only other magazine focused specifically on fantasy fiction was the British "<a href="Science%20Fantasy%20%28magazine%29">Science Fantasy</a>".

Goldsmith's tastes were too diverse for "Fantastic" to be limited to genre fantasy, however, and her willingness to buy fiction she liked, regardless of genre expectations, allowed many new writers to flourish on the pages of both "Amazing" and "Fantastic". Writers such as Ursula K. Le Guin, <a href="Roger%20Zelazny">Roger Zelazny</a> and Thomas M. Disch sold regularly to her at the start of their careers Le Guin later commented that Goldsmith was "as enterprising and perceptive an editor as the science fiction magazines ever had". Not all Goldsmith's choices were universally popular with the magazine's subscribers: she regularly published fiction by <a href="David%20R.%20Bunch">David R. Bunch</a>, for example, to mixed reviews from the readership.

Wrzos persuaded Cohen that both "Amazing" and "Fantastic" should carry a new story in every issue, rather than running nothing but reprints; Goldsmith had left a backlog of unpublished stories, and Wrzos was able to stretch these out for some time. One such story was Fritz Leiber's "Stardock", another Fafhrd and Gray Mouser story, which appeared in the September 1965 issue; it was subsequently nominated for a <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Short%20Story">Hugo Award</a>. The reprints were well received by the fans, because Wrzos was able to find good quality stories that were unavailable except in the original magazines, meaning that to many of "Fantastic's" readers they were fresh material. Wrzos also reprinted "The People of the Black Circle", a <a href="Robert%20E.%20Howard">Robert E. Howard</a> story from "<a href="Weird%20Tales">Weird Tales</a>", in 1967, when Howard's <a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian">Conan</a> stories were becoming popular.

In addition to the backlog of new stories from the Ziff Davis era, Wrzos was able to acquire some new material. He was especially glad to acquire "For a Breath I Tarry", by Roger Zelazny; however, he had to wait for Cohen's approval for his acquisitions. Cohen, perhaps uncertain because of the story's originality, delayed until it appeared in the British magazine "New Worlds" before agreeing to publish it. Wrzos commented years later that he would "never forgive him [Cohen] his timidity at that time". Wrzos bought <a href="Doris%20Piserchia">Doris Piserchia</a>'s first story, "Rocket to Gehenna", and was the first editor to acquire a story by Dean Koontz. He had to work with Koontz to improve it, and the delay this caused, in addition to the slow publishing schedule for new material, meant that Koontz appeared in print with "Soft Come the Dragons", in the August 1967 "Fantasy & Science Fiction", before "A Darkness in My Soul" appeared in the January 1968 "Fantastic".

After Wrzos's departure, Harrison and Malzberg had little opportunity to reshape the magazine as between them they only took responsibility for a handful of issues before Ted White took over. However, Harrison did print <a href="James%20Tiptree%2C%20Jr.">James Tiptree</a>'s first sale, "Fault", in the August 1968 issue; again the slow schedule meant that this was not Tiptree's first appearance in print. Harrison added a science column by <a href="Leon%20Stover">Leon Stover</a>, but was unable to change Cohen's position on the reprints, and so could not print much new fiction. When Malzberg took over from Harrison he published <a href="John%20Sladek">John Sladek</a>, Thomas M. Disch, and <a href="James%20Sallis">James Sallis</a>, all of whom were associated with <a href="New%20Wave%20science%20fiction">New Wave science fiction</a>, but his tenure was too short for him to have a significant impact on the magazine.

White was only able to offer his writers one cent per word, which was substantially lower than the leading magazines in the field—"<a href="Analog%20Science%20Fiction%20and%20Fact">Analog Science Fiction and Fact</a>" paid five cents, and "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction">Galaxy</a>" and "Fantasy & Science Fiction" paid three. Most stories would only be submitted to White once the higher-paying markets had rejected them, but among the rejects White was sometimes able to find experimental material that he liked. For example, <a href="Piers%20Anthony">Piers Anthony</a> had been unable to sell an early fantasy novel, "Hasan"; White saw a review of the manuscript and promptly acquired it for "Fantastic", where it was serialized starting in the December 1969 issue. White also took care to establish relationships with newer writers. White bought <a href="Gordon%20Eklund">Gordon Eklund</a>'s first story, "Dear Aunt Annie", it appeared in the April 1970 issue and was nominated for a <a href="Nebula%20award">Nebula award</a>. Eklund was unwilling to become a full-time writer, despite this success, because of the financial risks, so White agreed to buy anything Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed it was a good story. The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in "Amazing" and "Fantastic" over the next few years. In addition to experimental work, White was able to obtain material by some of the leading sf writers of the day, including <a href="Brian%20Aldiss">Brian Aldiss</a> and <a href="John%20Brunner%20%28novelist%29">John Brunner</a>. White also acquired some early work by writers who became better known in other fields: <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> sold two stories in the early 1970s to "Fantastic"; the first, "After the Last Mass", appeared in the February 1972 issue; and in 1975 White bought <a href="Ian%20McEwan">Ian McEwan</a>'s second story, "Solid Geometry". It was included in "<a href="First%20Love%2C%20Last%20Rites">First Love, Last Rites</a>", McEwan's first short story collection, which won the <a href="Somerset%20Maugham%20Award">Somerset Maugham Award</a> in 1976.

White had been an active science fiction fan before he became professionally involved in the field, and although he estimated that only 1 in 30 readers were active sf fans, he tried to use this fan base to help by urging the readership to give him feedback and to help with distribution by checking local newsstands for the magazines. White wanted to introduce established artists from outside the sf field, such as <a href="Jeff%20Jones%20%28artist%29">Jeff Jones</a>, <a href="Vaughn%20Bod%C3%A9">Vaughn Bodé</a>, and Steve Hickman; however, the company was saddled with cheap artwork acquired from European magazines to be used for the cover and he was instructed to make use of them. He commissioned a comic strip from Vaughn Bodé, but was outbid by <a href="Judy-Lynn%20del%20Rey">Judy-Lynn Benjamin</a> at "Galaxy"; he subsequently told his readers that he'd signed up Bodé again for interior artwork, but this never materialized. Instead a four-page comic strip by <a href="Jay%20Kinney">Jay Kinney</a> appeared in December 1970; a second strip, by <a href="Art%20Spiegelman">Art Spiegelman</a>, was planned, but never published. Eventually White was allowed to commission original cover art; he published early work by <a href="Mike%20Hinge">Mike Hinge</a>, and <a href="Mike%20Kaluta">Mike Kaluta</a> made his first professional sale to "Fantastic". He tried to hire Hinge as art director, but this fell through and White filled the role himself, sometimes using the pseudonym "J. Edwards".

Because of poor distribution, "Fantastic" was never able to benefit from the increasing popularity of the <a href="fantastic%20literature">fantasy genre</a>, though White was able to publish several stories by well-known writers in the field, including a <a href="sword%20and%20sorcery">sword and sorcery</a> novella by <a href="Dean%20R.%20Koontz">Dean R. Koontz</a>, which appeared in the October 1970 issue, and an <a href="Elric">Elric</a> story by <a href="Michael%20Moorcock">Michael Moorcock</a> in February 1972. A revival of Robert E. Howard's character Conan, in stories by <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a> and <a href="Lin%20Carter">Lin Carter</a>, was successful at increasing sales; the first of these stories appeared in August 1972, and White reported that sales of that issue were higher than for any other issue of "Amazing" or "Fantastic" that year. Each Conan story, according to White, increased sales of that issue by 10,000 copies. White also published several of Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories, and added "Sword and Sorcery" to the cover in 1975. In the same year a companion magazine, "Sword & Sorcery Annual", was launched, but the first issue was the only one to appear.

The quality of the magazine remained high even as the financial stress was mounting in the late 1970s. White acquired cover artwork by <a href="Stephen%20Fabian">Stephen Fabian</a> and <a href="Douglas%20Beekman">Douglas Beekman</a>, and stories by some of the new generation of sf writers, such as <a href="George%20R.%20R.%20Martin">George R. R. Martin</a> and <a href="Charles%20Sheffield">Charles Sheffield</a>. White departed in November 1978, but the first issue of "Fantastic" under Elinor Mavor's editorial control was April 1979. Because White had returned unsold stories she had very little to work with and was forced to fill the magazine with reprints. This led to renewed conflict with the sf community, which she did her best to defuse. At a convention in 1979 she met <a href="Harlan%20Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a>, who complained about the reprint policy; she explained that it was temporary and was able to get him to agree to contribute stories, publishing two pieces by him in "Amazing" over the next three years. The January 1980 issue of "Fantastic" (Mavor's fourth issue) was the last to contain reprinted stories. Once the reprints had been phased out, Mavor was able to find new writers to work with, including <a href="Brad%20Linaweaver">Brad Linaweaver</a> and <a href="John%20E.%20Stith">John E. Stith</a>, both of whom sold their first stories to "Fantastic". The last year of "Fantastic" showed "a steady improvement in content", according to Mike Ashley, who cites in particular "Daemon", a serialized graphic story, illustrated by Stephen Fabian. However, at the end of 1980 "Fantastic"s independent existence ceased, and it was merged with "Amazing".

The list below gives the person who was acting as editor. In some cases, such as at the start of Cele Goldsmith's stint, the official editor was not the same person; details are given above.

The title changed multiple times, and was frequently inconsistently given between the cover, spine, indicia, and masthead.
The following table shows which issues appeared from which publisher.

A British edition published by Thorpe & Porter ran for eight bimonthly issues from December 1953 to February 1955; the issues were not dated on the cover. These correspond to the US issues from September/October 1953 to December 1954, and were numbered volume 1, numbers 1 through 8.

"Fantastic" was digest-sized throughout its life. The page count began at 160 but dropped to 144 with the September/October 1953 issue, and then again to 128 pages with the very next issue, November/December 1953. The July 1960 issue had 144 pages, but apart from that one issue the page count stayed at 128 until September 1965, when it increased to 160. In January 1968 it went back down to 144 pages, and it dropped to 128 pages from February 1971 through the end of its run. The first issue was priced at 35 cents; thereafter the price went up as follows: 50 cents in May 1963, 60 cents in December 1969, 75 cents in July 1974, $1.00 in October 1975, $1.25 in April 1978, and finally $1.50 from April 1979 until the last issue.

Three anthologies of stories from "Fantastic" have been published. Note that "Time Untamed" contains stories that were published in "Fantastic" during its reprint years, but which did not necessarily first appear there.

Sydney Riot of 1879

The Sydney Riot of 1879 was an instance of <a href="civil%20disorder">civil disorder</a> that occurred at an early international <a href="cricket">cricket</a> match. It took place on 8 February 1879 at what is now the <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a> (at the time known as the Association Ground), during a match between <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a>, captained by <a href="Dave%20Gregory%20%28cricketer%29">Dave Gregory</a>, and a touring <a href="English%20cricket%20team">English team</a>, captained by <a href="Robert%20Harris%2C%204th%20Baron%20Harris">Lord Harris</a>.

The riot was sparked by a controversial umpiring decision, when star Australian batsman <a href="Billy%20Murdoch">Billy Murdoch</a> was <a href="Dismissal%20%28cricket%29">given out</a> by <a href="George%20Coulthard">George Coulthard</a>, a <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victorian</a> employed by the Englishmen. The dismissal caused an uproar among the spectators, many of whom surged onto the <a href="cricket%20pitch">pitch</a> and assaulted Coulthard and some English players. It was alleged that <a href="gambling">illegal gamblers</a> in the New South Wales pavilion, who had bet heavily on the home side, encouraged the riot because the tourists were in a dominant position and looked set to win. Another theory given to explain the anger was that of <a href="Intercolonial%20cricket%20in%20Australia">intercolonial rivalry</a>, that the New South Wales crowd objected to what they perceived to be a slight from a Victorian umpire.

The <a href="Pitch%20invasion%23Cricket">pitch invasion</a> occurred while Gregory halted the match by not sending out a replacement for Murdoch. The New South Wales skipper called on Lord Harris to remove umpire Coulthard, whom he considered to be inept or biased, but his English counterpart declined. The other umpire, <a href="Edmund%20Barton">Edmund Barton</a>, defended Coulthard and Lord Harris, saying that the decision against Murdoch was correct and that the English had conducted themselves appropriately. Eventually, Gregory agreed to resume the match without the removal of Coulthard. However, the crowd continued to disrupt proceedings, and play was abandoned for the day. Upon resumption after the Sunday rest day, Lord Harris's men won convincingly by an <a href="innings">innings</a>.

In the immediate aftermath of the riot, the England team cancelled the remaining games they were scheduled to play in Sydney. The incident also caused much press comment in England and Australia. In Australia, the newspapers were united in condemning the unrest, viewing the chaos as a national humiliation and a public relations disaster. An <a href="open%20letter">open letter</a> by Lord Harris about the incident was later published in English newspapers, and caused fresh outrage in New South Wales when it was reprinted by the Australian newspapers. A defensive letter written in response by the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Cricket%20Association">New South Wales Cricket Association</a> further damaged relations. The affair led to a breakdown of goodwill that threatened the future of <a href="English%20cricket%20team">Anglo</a>-<a href="Australian%20cricket%20team">Australian</a> cricket relations. However, friction between the cricketing authorities finally eased when Lord Harris agreed to lead an England <a href="representative%20side">representative side</a> at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> in London against the touring Australians in 1880; this match became the fourth-ever Test and cemented the tradition of Anglo-Australian <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a>.

England cricket tours to Australia started in 1861, and while successful, were still in their infancy in 1879, despite the first Test match having been played in 1877. The teams were of variable quality; while promoters sought the best cricketers, they still had to agree to terms. In addition, many could not afford the time for the long boat trip, the tour itself, and the return voyage—the journey itself often took up to two months. Aside from a <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201868">tour by an Australian Aboriginal team in 1868</a>, the <a href="Dave%20Gregory%20%28cricketer%29">Dave Gregory</a>-led campaign in 1878 was the first major Australian tour to England. The tour was generally regarded as a success; a highlight was the Australians' famous victory over a very strong <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> outfit, which included <a href="W.%20G.%20Grace">W. G. Grace</a>, the dominant cricketer of the 19th century, in less than four hours.

Keen to make the most of this success, the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a>—the <a href="Cricket%20Australia">Australian Board of Control for International Cricket</a> was not created until 1905—invited <a href="Lord%20Harris">Lord Harris</a>, an eminent amateur cricketer of the time, to lead a team to Australia. The team was originally meant to be entirely amateur, but two professional <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> bowlers, <a href="George%20Ulyett">George Ulyett</a> and <a href="Tom%20Emmett">Tom Emmett</a>, joined the tour team after two <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> players had to withdraw due to a bereavement. The main distinction between amateurs and professionals was social status, and although amateurs were not paid for playing, they did receive generous "expenses" which usually exceeded anything they would have been paid as professionals. Despite the presence of two professionals in the team, the Englishmen were described as "Gentlemen", a euphemism for amateurs. Now that Ulyett and Emmett were in the team, they did a large part of the bowling, and commentators felt that Harris had overworked them.

At the time, English cricket was dominated by amateurs. Generally educated in public schools such as <a href="Harrow%20School">Harrow</a> and <a href="Eton%20College">Eton</a>, and universities such as <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford</a> and <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge</a>, to them, sport was, in a large part, a social leisure pursuit. In contrast, the Australians were regarded by the social standards of the 19th century as coarse, rowdy and uncultured. The likes of bushranger <a href="Ned%20Kelly">Ned Kelly</a> heightened perceptions that Australia had a bandit culture. Violence, heckling and abusive chanting among drunken spectators and gamblers at sporting grounds were commonplace in 19th century Australia, and the prevalence of betting was seen as a major cause of crowd unrest. There were many instances of concerning player behaviour during the 1878 tour of England, and Gregory's men were considered to be unrefined and raucous.

Cheating was a regular occurrence in 19th-century Australian cricket, and the inter-colonial rivalry was strong—the modern states of Australia were separate colonies until their <a href="federation%20of%20Australia">federation</a> in 1901. As in real life, the sporting rivalry was at its most bitter between the two most populous and politically powerful colonies, <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>. The endless dispute between the colonies over whether Sydney or <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> would be the capital of Australia eventually forced the compromise that saw the construction of <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> midway between the two cities. With regards to sport, cricket administrators from both colonies sought to undermine their cross-border counterparts. On the field, matches were dominated by tit-for-tat <a href="throwing%20%28cricket%29">throwing</a> wars. Both colonies sought to stack their teams with players who either had borderline—and sometimes flagrantly—illegal bowling actions to use physical intimidation as a means of negating opposition batsmen. Gregory, whose action was regarded as highly dubious, was prominent in his New South Wales team pursuing a policy of condoning illegal bowling. It was amidst a background of inter-colonial rancour and a belligerent Australian sports culture that the riot broke out.

Soon after Gregory's 1878 Australian team returned home, Lord Harris's Englishmen arrived. Australia won the first match, played at the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a>, by 10 <a href="wicket">wicket</a>s. The match was later recognised as the third <a href="Test%20cricket">Test match</a> in history. New South Wales paceman <a href="Fred%20Spofforth">Fred Spofforth</a>—nicknamed "The Demon" because of his ferocious pace—took 13 wickets in the match, including the first ever Test <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a>. The next tour match was against <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a> and started on 24 January at the Association Ground in Sydney. New South Wales won by five wickets, despite the absence of Spofforth—who withdrew from the home side after spraining his wrist the night before the start of the match— and Gregory, who had been dropped for missing a training session and failing to provide an explanation for his absence.

The third tour match and the second game between the English XI (led by Lord Harris) and New South Wales—captained by Gregory—commenced on Friday 7 February at the Association Ground. It was usual for each side to select one of the two umpires for a match. The English selected 22-year-old <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victorian</a> <a href="George%20Coulthard">George Coulthard</a>, upon a recommendation from the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a>. As well as being a star <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">footballer</a> for <a href="Carlton%20Football%20Club">Carlton</a>, Coulthard was a ground-bowler employed by Melbourne, but was yet to make his <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a>ing debut. Coulthard accompanied Harris's men from Melbourne following the Test. New South Wales selected <a href="Edmund%20Barton">Edmund Barton</a>, who later became the first <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a>.

As both Gregory and Spofforth were playing for the hosts, bookmakers were offering attractive odds against an English win, and New South Wales were heavily backed, having won the previous match with an even weaker side. "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" condemned the "impunity with which open betting was transacted in the pavilion", in defiance of the prominent notices indicating that gambling was banned.

Lord Harris won the <a href="toss%20%28cricket%29">toss</a> and chose to bat. At about 12:10 pm in front of approximately 4,000 spectators, <a href="A%20N%20Hornby">A N Hornby</a> and <a href="A.%20P.%20Lucas">A. P. Lucas</a> opened the England innings. They put on 125 for the first wicket before Spofforth bowled Lucas for 51 and Hornby soon after for 67. Hornby had given a chance during his innings but Lucas did not. Ulyett and Harris steadied the innings after the two quick wickets and added 85; Ulyett made 55 before falling victim to a running, diving catch, and Harris made 41. During his innings, Harris edged a ball to wicket-keeper Murdoch, but Coulthard ruled him <a href="not%20out">not out</a>; this was noticed by the journalists present and reported the following day. Spofforth cut up the wicket with his feet so badly that it became very difficult to play, and <a href="Edwin%20Evans%20%28cricketer%29">Edwin Evans</a>, bowling from the other end, pitched nearly every ball into the marks. The loss of Ulyett and Harris in quick succession triggered a sudden collapse as England lost 7/34 to be all out for 267. Evans took 5/62 and Spofforth 5/93. The English batsmen were productive against the bowling of <a href="Edwin%20Tindall">Edwin Tindall</a>, taking 79 runs from his 27 <a href="Over%20%28cricket%29">over</a>s without losing a wicket. At <a href="Stumps%23End%20of%20the%20day.27s%20play">stumps</a> on the first day, New South Wales were 2/53, with wicket-keeper and opening batsman <a href="Billy%20Murdoch">Billy Murdoch</a> on 28 and <a href="Hugh%20Massie">Hugh Massie</a> on three.

The match recommenced at noon the next day, Saturday 8 February. Ten thousand were in attendance, and New South Wales started well. Murdoch and Massie took the score to 107 before the latter fell, and the hosts reached 3/130 at lunch, without losing another wicket. However, wickets tumbled through the afternoon, none of the incoming batsmen passed single figures and New South Wales were all out for 177, a deficit of 90 runs. <a href="Tom%20Emmett">Tom Emmett</a> took the last seven wickets to end with 8/47. Murdoch batted through the innings for 82 not out, making him the hero in the eyes of the locals. He hit 11 fours, and "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a>" called his effort a "grand innings". The prevailing rule of the time required New South Wales to <a href="follow-on">follow-on</a> (i.e. to bat again) as they were more than 80 runs in arrears. New South Wales started their second innings around 4 o'clock. Then, when the New South Wales second innings score was 19, the opening partnership between Murdoch and <a href="Alick%20Bannerman">Alick Bannerman</a> ended when the former was adjudged <a href="run%20out">run out</a> by Coulthard for 10.

Many in the crowd disagreed with the decision and took exception to it being made by an umpire employed by the Englishmen. That Coulthard was a Victorian added to the emotions of the crowd, who thought along intercolonial lines. The <a href="The%20Evening%20News%20%28Sydney%29">"Sydney Evening News"</a> propagated rumours that Coulthard had placed a large bet on an English victory, something that the umpire and Lord Harris later denied. Loud hooting came from the pavilion, especially the section where the gamblers, who had overwhelmingly backed a New South Wales victory, were situated. It was reported that well-known gamblers were prominent in inciting the other members of the crowd, amid loud chants of "not out" and "Go back [to the playing field], Murdoch". Gregory was later accused of trying to fan the dispute and encourage the crowd to gain an advantage for his team. The crowd was already suspicious of Coulthard's competence and impartiality; the "<a href="Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">Sydney Morning Herald</a>" commented in that morning's edition, "The decision [to give Lord Harris not out on the first day] was admittedly a mistake".

The pavilion stood at an angle to the <a href="Crease%20%28cricket%29">crease</a>, so the members were not in an ideal position to see how accurate the decision was. The uproar continued as it became obvious that no batsman was coming out to replace Murdoch, so Harris walked towards the pavilion and met Gregory at the gate, at which point Gregory asked Harris to change his umpire. Harris refused, as the English team considered the decision to be fair and correct. Lord Harris later said that his two fielders in the <a href="fielding%20%28cricket%29">point and cover positions</a>, being side on to the crease, had a good view of the incident, and that they agreed with Coulthard's judgement. Barton said that Coulthard's decision was correct, and that the Englishmen were justified in standing by their nominated umpire.
It was while Harris was remonstrating with Gregory that "<a href="larrikin">larrikin</a>s" in the crowd surged onto the pitch. A young <a href="Banjo%20Paterson">Banjo Paterson</a>, who later went on to write the iconic Australian <a href="bush%20ballad">bush ballad</a> "<a href="Waltzing%20Matilda">Waltzing Matilda</a>", was among the pitch invaders. Of the 10,000 spectators, up to 2,000 "participated in the disorder". Coulthard was jostled and Lord Harris, who had returned to the field to support Coulthard, was struck by a whip or stick but was not hurt. Hornby, a keen amateur boxer who had been offered the English captaincy before stepping aside for Harris, grabbed his captain's assailant and "conveyed his prisoner to the pavilion in triumph"; it was later said that he had caught the wrong man. Hornby was also attacked and almost lost the shirt off his back. Emmett and Ulyett each took a stump for protection and escorted Lord Harris off, assisted by some members. In the meantime, the crowd anger grew and there was mounting fear that the riot would intensify, due to speculation that the crowd would try to free Hornby's captive. However, there was only jostling as the players were evacuated into the pavilion, and the injuries were limited to minor cuts and bruises. An English naval captain who was at the ground had his top hat pulled over his eyes and was verbally abused by some spectators. After 30 minutes, the field was cleared.

When the ground was finally cleared Gregory insisted, according to Harris, that Coulthard be replaced. When Harris would not agree, Gregory said, "Then the game is at an end". Harris asked Barton whether he could claim the match on a forfeit. Barton replied "I will give it to you in two minutes if the batsmen don't return". Harris then asked Barton to speak with Gregory to ascertain his intentions. When Barton came out he announced that <a href="Alick%20Bannerman">Alick Bannerman</a> and <a href="Nat%20Thomson">Nat Thomson</a> would resume the New South Wales innings. They walked onto the arena and reached the stumps, but before they could receive a ball, the crowd again invaded the pitch, and remained there until the scheduled end of play. According to "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Mail">The Sydney Mail</a>" approximately 90 minutes' play had been lost. Lord Harris maintained his position on the ground, standing "erect" with "moustache bristling" among the spectators, fearful that his leaving the arena would lead to a forfeit.

Sunday was a rest day, so the match resumed on Monday, 10 February. As it was a working day, the crowd was much smaller. Rain had fallen and the sun had baked the playing surface into a <a href="sticky%20wicket">sticky wicket</a>, which caused erratic behaviour. <a href="Nat%20Thomson">Nat Thomson</a> was out for a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a> without addition to the overnight total, and a collapse ensued. New South Wales made only 49 in their second innings; Bannerman top-scored with 20 while six of his colleagues failed to score, while Emmett and Ulyett took four and five wickets respectively, including four wickets in four balls for the latter. England thus won by an innings and 41 runs.

There were widespread allegations by the media and English players that the riot was started by bookmakers, or at least encouraged by the widespread betting that was known to be occurring at the match. <a href="Vernon%20Royle">Vernon Royle</a>, a member of the English team, wrote in his diary that "It was a most disgraceful affair and took its origin from some of the 'better' [gambling] class in the Pavilion".

The Australian press and cricket officials immediately condemned the riot, which dominated the front pages of the local newspapers, even though the infamous <a href="bushranger">bushranger</a> <a href="Ned%20Kelly">Ned Kelly</a> and his gang had raided <a href="Jerilderie">Jerilderie</a> on the same weekend. The local media were united in their disgust at the scenes of tumult, fearing a public relations disaster would erupt in England. The "<a href="Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">Sydney Morning Herald</a>" called the riot "a national humiliation", and that it "would remain a blot upon the colony for some years to come". They accused those involved in gambling of inciting "larrikins" and "roughs" to storm the field and attack the Englishmen. However, they also suggested that some of the blame should be put on one of the English professionals, who "made use of a grossly insulting remark to the crowd about their being nothing but 'sons of <a href="convicts%20in%20Australia">convicts</a>'". Barton defended the Englishmen and Coulthard, saying that none had done anything wrong. He claimed that Emmett and Ulyett were incapable of insulting the Australians in such a way.

"<a href="The%20Australasian">The Australasian</a>" claimed that three policemen at the ground idled and allowed the rioters to attack the Englishmen. They said that the riot "forever made the match memorable in the annals of New South Wales cricket", and lamented the fact that "rowdyism became rampant for the rest of the afternoon". The paper asked the question "What will they say in England?" "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a>" condemned the unrest as a "deplorably disgraceful affair" and described the spectators as a "rough and excited mob". <a href="Richard%20Driver">Richard Driver</a> of the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Cricket%20Association">New South Wales Cricket Association</a> (NSWCA) issued a statement of regret for what had happened to the tourists.

The NSWCA appealed to Lord Harris, and in reply he said he did not blame them or the cricketers of Sydney in any way, but said that "it [the riot] was an occurrence it was impossible he could forget".
On 11 February, one day after the conclusion of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed in the press, and it appeared in full in "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot.

Lord Harris referred to the crowd as a "howling mob" and said "I have seen no reason as yet to change my opinion of Coulthard's qualities, or to regret his engagement, in which opinion I am joined by the whole team". He further added that "Beyond slyly kicking me once or twice the mob behaved very well, their one cry being, 'Change your umpire'. And now for the cause of this disturbance, not unexpected, I may say, by us, for we have heard accounts of former matches played by English teams." Harris further accused a New South Wales parliamentarian of assisting the gamblers in the inciting the unrest, although he did not name the accusee. He said

He further accused the Australian public of being bad losers, claiming that they were sparing in their applause upon his team's victory, and were unable to appreciate skills shown by an opposing team. He summed up his feelings

The NSWCA were outraged by Lord Harris's letter and convened a special meeting to consider their response and subsequently had their honorary secretary, Mr J.M. Gibson, write to "The Daily Telegraph" in reply. Gibson argued that "the misconduct of those who took possession of the wickets has been exaggerated" and that Lord Harris's account was "universally regarded here as both inaccurate and ungenerous." The letter said that "We cannot allow a libel upon the people of New South Wales so utterly unfounded as this to pass without challenge". It went on to accuse Harris of omitting certain facts in his account, which according to the NSWCA, depicted Australia and the cricket authorities in a poor light. These included an accusation that Harris had failed to note that the NSWCA and the media had immediately and strongly condemned the disturbance and treatment of the English visitors. Gibson also criticised Lord Harris for claiming that Coulthard was "competent", while "admitting 'he had made two mistakes in our innings'", especially as Coulthard's not out ruling against Lord Harris "was openly admitted by his lordship to be a mistake" that favoured the Englishmen. The letter further denied the claim that those who incited the riot were associated with the NSWCA and accused Harris of inflammatory conduct during the disorder.

Spofforth, Australia's leading bowler, commented on the incident in an 1891 cricket magazine interview, but put a different slant on the cause. He thought that the English team were victims of intercolonial rivalry between New South Wales and Victoria:

Immediately after the game, Lord Harris led his men from Sydney, cancelling the planned return match against a representative Australian side that would have become the fourth-ever Test match. The England team returned to Melbourne where two further matches were played against Victoria on 21–25 February and 7–10 March. At the farewell banquet hosted by the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a>, Harris spoke publicly for the first time about the riot. He was critical of the way his team had been treated by a portion of the New South Wales press, which had "unintentionally", he trusted, "but with questionable courtesy", described them "as if they were strolling actors, rather than as a party of gentlemen." However, the speech was otherwise regarded as reconciliatory.
The NSWCA pressed charges against two men who were charged with "having participated in the disorder". Their President <a href="Richard%20Driver">Richard Driver</a>, who appeared for the prosecution, told the court that "the inmates of the Pavilion who had initiated the disturbance, including a well-known bookmaker of Victoria who was at the time ejected, had had their fees of membership returned to them, and they would never again be admitted to the ground". The "Sydney Morning Herald" reported that the two men "expressed regret for what had occurred, and pleaded guilty" and "the Bench fined them 40 shillings, and to pay 21 shillings professional costs of the court". Despite initial cynicism from journalists, the NSWCA announced a crackdown on betting on cricket matches, and it was reported that over the next 10 years, gambling at cricket matches in Sydney mainly died out.

In 1880, an Australian side captained by <a href="Billy%20Murdoch">Billy Murdoch</a> toured England. The tourists had difficulty finding good opponents; most county sides turned them down, although <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> played two unofficial matches against them. There was a lot of bad will, exacerbated by the Australians' arrival in England at short notice, to some extent unexpectedly. This was heightened by an English perception that the Australians came frequently to maximise their profits; at the time, professionalism was frowned upon. In his autobiography Lord Harris wrote, "They asked no-one's goodwill in the matter, and it was felt this was a discourteous way of bursting in on our arrangements; and the result was they played scarcely any counties and were not generally recognised ... We felt we had to make a protest against too frequent visits". Harris initially shunned the team and tried to avoid correspondence and meetings with them. An attempt to arrange a game against an English XI for the Cricketers' Fund was turned down, and public advertisements in the newspapers were shunned. <a href="W.G.%20Grace">W.G. Grace</a> was sympathetic to the Australians and felt that they were not to blame for the riot. He attempted to arrange a game for them at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>, but was rebuffed by the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a>, who gave the excuse that the ground was not available.

Despite it being Murdoch's wicket that started the riot, the English public were more sympathetic towards him than Gregory, and although the Australians played against weak opposition, including many XVIIIs, they attracted large crowds, leading the counties to regret their decision to snub them. Eventually the secretary of <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a>, <a href="C.%20W.%20Alcock">C. W. Alcock</a> asked Lord Harris to put together a representative side to play the Australians, while Grace acted as a mediator. Luckily for the Australians, Lord Harris had a personal rapport with their captain Murdoch and leading player Spofforth, especially as they shared his antipathy towards throwing. An agreement was reached, and although Lord Harris was generous in agreeing to lead the side, three cricketers who played in the infamous Sydney game—Hornby, Emmett and Ulyett—refused to play. Harris assembled a strong team, which included the <a href="Grace%20family">three Grace brothers</a> and Australia, who had not faced strong opposition and were without star bowler <a href="Fred%20Spofforth">Fred Spofforth</a>, went down by five wickets in front of 45,000 spectators. This game, later recognised as the <a href="History%20of%20Test%20cricket%20%28to%201883%29%23The%20tours%20of%201878%2C%201878%E2%80%9379%20and%201880">fourth Test in history and the first to be played in England</a>, is more important than its result, as the custom of cricket tours between England and Australia was cemented. Overall, the tour was a financial success and an effective exercise in mending relations; the team were received by the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London">Lord Mayor of London</a> at the end of the tour and were given gifts. Profits were healthy and public awareness of the bilateral cricketing relationship increased.

Introduction to general relativity

General relativity is a <a href="scientific%20theory">theory</a> of <a href="gravitation">gravitation</a> that was developed by <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational effect between masses results from their warping of <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a>.

By the beginning of the 20th century, <a href="Newton%27s%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation">Newton's law of universal gravitation</a> had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses. In Newton's model, gravity is the result of an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was troubled by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.

Experiments and observations show that Einstein's description of gravitation accounts for several effects that are unexplained by Newton's law, such as minute anomalies in the <a href="orbit">orbit</a>s of <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a> and other <a href="planet">planet</a>s. General relativity also predicts novel effects of gravity, such as <a href="gravitational%20wave">gravitational wave</a>s, <a href="gravitational%20lens">gravitational lens</a>ing and an effect of gravity on time known as <a href="gravitational%20time%20dilation">gravitational time dilation</a>. Many of these predictions have been confirmed by experiment or observation, <a href="Gravitational%20wave%20observation">most recently gravitational waves</a>.

General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern <a href="astrophysics">astrophysics</a>. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s, regions of space where the gravitational effect is strong enough that even light cannot escape. Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense <a href="radiation">radiation</a> emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as <a href="Active%20galactic%20nucleus">active galactic nuclei</a> or <a href="microquasar">microquasar</a>s). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a> model of <a href="Physical%20cosmology">cosmology</a>.

Although general relativity is not the only relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest such theory that is consistent with the experimental data. Nevertheless, a number of open questions remain, the most fundamental of which is how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of <a href="Introduction%20to%20quantum%20mechanics">quantum physics</a> to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of <a href="quantum%20gravity">quantum gravity</a>.

In September 1905, <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> published his theory of <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a>, which reconciles <a href="Newton%27s%20laws%20of%20motion">Newton's laws of motion</a> with <a href="Classical%20electromagnetism">electrodynamics</a> (the interaction between objects with <a href="electric%20charge">electric charge</a>). Special relativity introduced a new framework for all of physics by proposing new concepts of <a href="space">space</a> and time. Some then-accepted physical theories were inconsistent with that framework; a key example was Newton's theory of <a href="Gravitation">gravity</a>, which describes the mutual attraction experienced by bodies due to their mass.

Several physicists, including Einstein, searched for a theory that would reconcile Newton's law of gravity and special relativity. Only Einstein's theory proved to be consistent with experiments and observations. To understand the theory's basic ideas, it is instructive to follow Einstein's thinking between 1907 and 1915, from his simple <a href="thought%20experiment">thought experiment</a> involving an observer in free fall to his fully geometric theory of gravity.

A person in a <a href="Free%20fall">free-falling</a> elevator experiences <a href="weightlessness">weightlessness</a>; objects either float motionless or drift at constant speed. Since everything in the elevator is falling together, no gravitational effect can be observed. In this way, the experiences of an observer in free fall are indistinguishable from those of an observer in deep space, far from any significant source of gravity. Such observers are the privileged ("inertial") observers Einstein described in his theory of <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a>: observers for whom <a href="light">light</a> travels along straight lines at constant speed.

Einstein hypothesized that the similar experiences of weightless observers and inertial observers in special relativity represented a fundamental property of gravity, and he made this the cornerstone of his theory of general relativity, formalized in his <a href="equivalence%20principle">equivalence principle</a>. Roughly speaking, the principle states that a person in a free-falling elevator cannot tell that they are in free fall. Every experiment in such a free-falling environment has the same results as it would for an observer at rest or moving uniformly in deep space, far from all sources of gravity.

Most effects of gravity vanish in free fall, but effects that seem the same as those of gravity can be "produced" by an <a href="Acceleration">accelerated</a> frame of reference. An observer in a closed room cannot tell which of the following is true:

Conversely, any effect observed in an accelerated reference frame should also be observed in a gravitational field of corresponding strength. This principle allowed Einstein to predict several novel effects of gravity in 1907, as explained in the <a href="%23Physical%20consequences">next section</a>.

An observer in an accelerated reference frame must introduce what physicists call <a href="fictitious%20force">fictitious force</a>s to account for the acceleration experienced by himself and objects around him. One example, the force pressing the driver of an accelerating car into his or her seat, has already been mentioned; another is the force you can feel pulling your arms up and out if you attempt to spin around like a top. Einstein's master insight was that the constant, familiar pull of the Earth's gravitational field is fundamentally the same as these fictitious forces. The apparent magnitude of the fictitious forces always appears to be proportional to the mass of any object on which they act – for instance, the driver's seat exerts just enough force to accelerate the driver at the same rate as the car. By analogy, Einstein proposed that an object in a gravitational field should feel a gravitational force proportional to its mass, as embodied in <a href="Newton%27s%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation">Newton's law of gravitation</a>.

In 1907, Einstein was still eight years away from completing the general theory of relativity. Nonetheless, he was able to make a number of novel, testable predictions that were based on his starting point for developing his new theory: the equivalence principle.

The first new effect is the <a href="Gravitational%20redshift">gravitational frequency shift</a> of light. Consider two observers aboard an accelerating rocket-ship. Aboard such a ship, there is a natural concept of "up" and "down": the direction in which the ship accelerates is "up", and unattached objects accelerate in the opposite direction, falling "downward". Assume that one of the observers is "higher up" than the other. When the lower observer sends a light signal to the higher observer, the acceleration causes the light to be <a href="Redshift">red-shifted</a>, as may be calculated from <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a>; the second observer will measure a lower <a href="frequency">frequency</a> for the light than the first. Conversely, light sent from the higher observer to the lower is <a href="Blueshift">blue-shifted</a>, that is, shifted towards higher frequencies. Einstein argued that such frequency shifts must also be observed in a gravitational field. This is illustrated in the figure at left, which shows a light wave that is gradually red-shifted as it works its way upwards against the gravitational acceleration. This effect has been confirmed experimentally, as described <a href="%23Experiments">below</a>.

This gravitational frequency shift corresponds to a <a href="gravitational%20time%20dilation">gravitational time dilation</a>: Since the "higher" observer measures the same light wave to have a lower frequency than the "lower" observer, time must be passing faster for the higher observer. Thus, time runs more slowly for observers who are lower in a gravitational field.

It is important to stress that, for each observer, there are no observable changes of the flow of time for events or processes that are at rest in his or her reference frame. Five-minute-eggs as timed by each observer's clock have the same consistency; as one year passes on each clock, each observer ages by that amount; each clock, in short, is in perfect agreement with all processes happening in its immediate vicinity. It is only when the clocks are compared between separate observers that one can notice that time runs more slowly for the lower observer than for the higher. This effect is minute, but it too has been confirmed experimentally in multiple experiments, as described <a href="%23Experiments">below</a>.

In a similar way, Einstein predicted the <a href="Tests%20of%20general%20relativity%23Deflection%20of%20light%20by%20the%20Sun">gravitational deflection of light</a>: in a gravitational field, light is deflected downward. Quantitatively, his results were off by a factor of two; the correct derivation requires a more complete formulation of the theory of general relativity, not just the equivalence principle.

The equivalence between gravitational and inertial effects does not constitute a complete theory of gravity. When it comes to explaining gravity near our own location on the Earth's surface, noting that our reference frame is not in free fall, so that <a href="fictitious%20force">fictitious force</a>s are to be expected, provides a suitable explanation. But a freely falling reference frame on one side of the Earth cannot explain why the people on the opposite side of the Earth experience a gravitational pull in the opposite direction.

A more basic manifestation of the same effect involves two bodies that are falling side by side towards the Earth. In a reference frame that is in free fall alongside these bodies, they appear to hover weightlessly – but not exactly so. These bodies are not falling in precisely the same direction, but towards a single point in space: namely, the Earth's <a href="Center%20of%20mass">center of gravity</a>. Consequently, there is a component of each body's motion towards the other (see the figure). In a small environment such as a freely falling lift, this relative acceleration is minuscule, while for <a href="skydiver">skydiver</a>s on opposite sides of the Earth, the effect is large. Such differences in force are also responsible for the <a href="tide">tide</a>s in the Earth's oceans, so the term "<a href="tidal%20effect">tidal effect</a>" is used for this phenomenon.

The equivalence between inertia and gravity cannot explain tidal effects – it cannot explain variations in the gravitational field. For that, a theory is needed which describes the way that matter (such as the large mass of the Earth) affects the inertial environment around it.

In exploring the equivalence of gravity and acceleration as well as the role of tidal forces, Einstein discovered several analogies with the <a href="geometry">geometry</a> of <a href="surface%20%28mathematics%29">surface</a>s. An example is the transition from an inertial reference frame (in which free particles coast along straight paths at constant speeds) to a rotating reference frame (in which extra terms corresponding to <a href="fictitious%20force">fictitious force</a>s have to be introduced in order to explain particle motion): this is analogous to the transition from a <a href="Cartesian%20coordinate%20system">Cartesian</a> <a href="coordinate%20system">coordinate system</a> (in which the coordinate lines are straight lines) to a <a href="Curvilinear%20coordinates">curved coordinate system</a> (where coordinate lines need not be straight).

A deeper analogy relates tidal forces with a property of surfaces called "<a href="curvature">curvature</a>". For gravitational fields, the absence or presence of tidal forces determines whether or not the influence of gravity can be eliminated by choosing a freely falling reference frame. Similarly, the absence or presence of curvature determines whether or not a surface is <a href="Isometry">equivalent</a> to a <a href="Plane%20%28mathematics%29">plane</a>. In the summer of 1912, inspired by these analogies, Einstein searched for a geometric formulation of gravity.

The elementary objects of <a href="geometry">geometry</a> – <a href="Point%20%28geometry%29">point</a>s, <a href="Line%20%28mathematics%29">line</a>s, <a href="triangle">triangle</a>s – are traditionally defined in three-dimensional <a href="space">space</a> or on two-dimensional <a href="surface%20%28mathematics%29">surface</a>s. In 1907, <a href="Hermann%20Minkowski">Hermann Minkowski</a>, Einstein's former mathematics professor at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic, introduced a geometric formulation of Einstein's <a href="special%20theory%20of%20relativity">special theory of relativity</a> where the geometry included not only <a href="space">space</a> but also time. The basic entity of this new geometry is four-<a href="dimension">dimension</a>al <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a>. The orbits of moving bodies are <a href="World%20line">curves in spacetime</a>; the orbits of bodies moving at constant speed without changing direction correspond to straight lines.

For surfaces, the generalization from the geometry of a plane – a flat surface – to that of a general curved surface had been described in the early 19th century by <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>. This description had in turn been generalized to higher-dimensional spaces in a mathematical formalism introduced by <a href="Bernhard%20Riemann">Bernhard Riemann</a> in the 1850s. With the help of <a href="Riemannian%20geometry">Riemannian geometry</a>, Einstein formulated a geometric description of gravity in which Minkowski's spacetime is replaced by distorted, curved spacetime, just as curved surfaces are a generalization of ordinary plane surfaces. Embedding Diagrams are used to illustrate curved spacetime in educational contexts.

After he had realized the validity of this geometric analogy, it took Einstein a further three years to find the missing cornerstone of his theory: the equations describing how <a href="matter">matter</a> influences spacetime's curvature. Having formulated what are now known as <a href="Einstein%27s%20equations">Einstein's equations</a> (or, more precisely, his field equations of gravity), he presented his new theory of gravity at several sessions of the <a href="Prussian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Prussian Academy of Sciences</a> in late 1915, culminating in his final presentation on November 25, 1915.

Paraphrasing <a href="John%20Archibald%20Wheeler">John Wheeler</a>, Einstein's geometric theory of gravity can be summarized thus: "spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve". What this means is addressed in the following three sections, which explore the motion of so-called test particles, examine which properties of matter serve as a source for gravity, and, finally, introduce Einstein's equations, which relate these matter properties to the curvature of spacetime.

In order to map a body's gravitational influence, it is useful to think about what physicists call probe or <a href="test%20particle">test particle</a>s: particles that are influenced by gravity, but are so small and light that we can neglect their own gravitational effect. In the absence of gravity and other external forces, a test particle moves along a straight line at a constant speed. In the language of <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a>, this is equivalent to saying that such test particles move along straight <a href="world%20lines">world lines</a> in spacetime. In the presence of gravity, spacetime is <a href="non-Euclidean">non-Euclidean</a>, or <a href="Curvature">curved</a>, and in curved spacetime straight world lines may not exist. Instead, test particles move along lines called <a href="geodesic">geodesic</a>s, which are "as straight as possible", that is, they follow the shortest path between starting and ending points, taking the curvature into consideration.

A simple analogy is the following: In <a href="geodesy">geodesy</a>, the science of measuring Earth's size and shape, a geodesic (from Greek "geo", Earth, and "daiein", to divide) is the shortest route between two points on the Earth's surface. Approximately, such a route is a <a href="Circle%20segment">segment</a> of a <a href="great%20circle">great circle</a>, such as a <a href="line%20of%20longitude">line of longitude</a> or the <a href="equator">equator</a>. These paths are certainly not straight, simply because they must follow the curvature of the Earth's surface. But they are as straight as is possible subject to this constraint.

The properties of geodesics differ from those of straight lines. For example, on a plane, parallel lines never meet, but this is not so for geodesics on the surface of the Earth: for example, lines of longitude are parallel at the equator, but intersect at the poles. Analogously, the world lines of test particles in free fall are <a href="Geodesic%20%28general%20relativity%29">spacetime geodesic</a>s, the straightest possible lines in spacetime. But still there are crucial differences between them and the truly straight lines that can be traced out in the gravity-free spacetime of special relativity. In special relativity, parallel geodesics remain parallel. In a gravitational field with tidal effects, this will not, in general, be the case. If, for example, two bodies are initially at rest relative to each other, but are then dropped in the Earth's gravitational field, they will move towards each other as they fall towards the Earth's center.

Compared with planets and other astronomical bodies, the objects of everyday life (people, cars, houses, even mountains) have little mass. Where such objects are concerned, the laws governing the behavior of test particles are sufficient to describe what happens. Notably, in order to deflect a test particle from its geodesic path, an external force must be applied. A chair someone is sitting on applies an external upwards force preventing the person from <a href="freefall">falling freely</a> towards <a href="Travel%20to%20the%20Earth%27s%20center">the center of the Earth</a> and thus following a geodesic, which they would otherwise be doing without matter in between them and the center of the Earth. In this way, general relativity explains the daily experience of gravity on the surface of the Earth "not" as the downwards pull of a gravitational force, but as the upwards push of external forces. These forces deflect all bodies resting on the Earth's surface from the geodesics they would otherwise follow. For matter objects whose own gravitational influence cannot be neglected, the laws of motion are somewhat more complicated than for test particles, although it remains true that spacetime tells matter how to move.

In <a href="Law%20of%20universal%20gravitation">Newton's description of gravity</a>, the gravitational force is caused by matter. More precisely, it is caused by a specific property of material objects: their <a href="mass">mass</a>. In Einstein's theory and related <a href="theories%20of%20gravitation">theories of gravitation</a>, curvature at every point in spacetime is also caused by whatever matter is present. Here, too, mass is a key property in determining the gravitational influence of matter. But in a relativistic theory of gravity, mass cannot be the only source of gravity. Relativity links mass with energy, and energy with momentum.

The equivalence between mass and <a href="energy">energy</a>, as expressed by the formula <a href="Mass%E2%80%93energy%20equivalence">"E" = "mc"</a>, is the most famous consequence of special relativity. In relativity, mass and energy are two different ways of describing one physical quantity. If a physical system has energy, it also has the corresponding mass, and vice versa. In particular, all properties of a body that are associated with energy, such as its <a href="temperature">temperature</a> or the <a href="binding%20energy">binding energy</a> of systems such as <a href="Atomic%20nucleus">nuclei</a> or <a href="molecule">molecule</a>s, contribute to that body's mass, and hence act as sources of gravity.

In special relativity, energy is closely connected to <a href="momentum">momentum</a>. Just as space and time are, in that theory, different aspects of a more comprehensive entity called spacetime, energy and momentum are merely different aspects of a unified, four-dimensional quantity that physicists call <a href="four-momentum">four-momentum</a>. In consequence, if energy is a source of gravity, momentum must be a source as well. The same is true for quantities that are directly related to energy and momentum, namely internal <a href="pressure">pressure</a> and <a href="Tension%20%28physics%29">tension</a>. Taken together, in general relativity it is mass, energy, momentum, pressure and tension that serve as sources of gravity: they are how matter tells spacetime how to curve. In the theory's mathematical formulation, all these quantities are but aspects of a more general physical quantity called the <a href="Stress%E2%80%93energy%20tensor">energy–momentum tensor</a>.

<a href="Einstein%27s%20equations">Einstein's equations</a> are the centerpiece of general relativity. They provide a precise formulation of the relationship between spacetime geometry and the properties of matter, using the language of mathematics. More concretely, they are formulated using the concepts of <a href="Riemannian%20geometry">Riemannian geometry</a>, in which the geometric properties of a space (or a spacetime) are described by a quantity called a <a href="Riemannian%20metric">metric</a>. The metric encodes the information needed to compute the fundamental geometric notions of distance and angle in a curved space (or spacetime).

A spherical surface like that of the Earth provides a simple example. The location of any point on the surface can be described by two coordinates: the geographic <a href="latitude">latitude</a> and <a href="longitude">longitude</a>. Unlike the Cartesian coordinates of the plane, coordinate differences are not the same as distances on the surface, as shown in the diagram on the right: for someone at the equator, moving 30 degrees of longitude westward (magenta line) corresponds to a distance of roughly . On the other hand, someone at a latitude of 55 degrees, moving 30 degrees of longitude westward (blue line) covers a distance of merely . Coordinates therefore do not provide enough information to describe the geometry of a spherical surface, or indeed the geometry of any more complicated space or spacetime. That information is precisely what is encoded in the metric, which is a function defined at each point of the surface (or space, or spacetime) and relates coordinate differences to differences in distance. All other quantities that are of interest in geometry, such as the length of any given curve, or the angle at which two curves meet, can be computed from this metric function.

The metric function and its rate of change from point to point can be used to define a geometrical quantity called the <a href="Riemann%20curvature%20tensor">Riemann curvature tensor</a>, which describes exactly how the space or spacetime is curved at each point. In general relativity, the metric and the Riemann curvature tensor are quantities defined at each point in spacetime. As has already been mentioned, the matter content of the spacetime defines another quantity, the <a href="Stress%E2%80%93energy%20tensor">energy–momentum tensor</a> T, and the principle that "spacetime tells matter how to move, and matter tells spacetime how to curve" means that these quantities must be related to each other. Einstein formulated this relation by using the Riemann curvature tensor and the metric to define another geometrical quantity G, now called the <a href="Einstein%20tensor">Einstein tensor</a>, which describes some aspects of the way spacetime is curved. "Einstein's equation" then states that

i.e., up to a constant multiple, the quantity G (which measures curvature) is equated with the quantity T (which measures matter content). Here, "G" is the <a href="gravitational%20constant">gravitational constant</a> of Newtonian gravity, and "c" is the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a> from special relativity.

This equation is often referred to in the plural as "Einstein's equations", since the quantities G and T are each determined by several functions of the coordinates of spacetime, and the equations equate each of these component functions. <a href="Exact%20solutions%20of%20Einstein%27s%20field%20equations">A solution of these equations</a> describes a particular geometry of <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a>; for example, the <a href="Schwarzschild%20metric">Schwarzschild solution</a> describes the geometry around a spherical, non-rotating mass such as a <a href="star">star</a> or a <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>, whereas the <a href="Kerr%20metric">Kerr solution</a> describes a rotating black hole. Still other solutions can describe a <a href="gravitational%20wave">gravitational wave</a> or, in the case of the <a href="Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker%20metric">Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker solution</a>, an expanding universe. The simplest solution is the uncurved <a href="Minkowski%20spacetime">Minkowski spacetime</a>, the spacetime described by special relativity.

No scientific theory is <a href="Apodicticity">apodictically true</a>; each is a model that must be checked by experiment. <a href="Newton%27s%20law%20of%20gravity">Newton's law of gravity</a> was accepted because it accounted for the motion of planets and moons in the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> with considerable accuracy. As the precision of experimental measurements gradually improved, some discrepancies with Newton's predictions were observed, and these were accounted for in the general theory of relativity. Similarly, the predictions of general relativity must also be checked with experiment, and Einstein himself devised three tests now known as the classical tests of the theory:

Of these tests, only the perihelion advance of Mercury was known prior to Einstein's final publication of general relativity in 1916. The subsequent experimental confirmation of his other predictions, especially the first measurements of the deflection of light by the sun in 1919, catapulted Einstein to international stardom. These three experiments justified adopting general relativity over Newton's theory and, incidentally, over a number of <a href="alternatives%20to%20general%20relativity">alternatives to general relativity</a> that had been proposed.

Further tests of general relativity include precision measurements of the <a href="Shapiro%20effect">Shapiro effect</a> or gravitational time delay for light, most recently in 2002 by the <a href="Cassini-Huygens">Cassini</a> space probe. One set of tests focuses on effects predicted by general relativity for the behavior of <a href="gyroscopes">gyroscopes</a> travelling through space. One of these effects, <a href="geodetic%20effect">geodetic precession</a>, has been tested with the <a href="Lunar%20Laser%20Ranging%20Experiment">Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment</a> (high-precision measurements of the orbit of the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>). Another, which is related to rotating masses, is called <a href="frame-dragging">frame-dragging</a>. The geodetic and frame-dragging effects were both tested by the <a href="Gravity%20Probe%20B">Gravity Probe B</a> satellite experiment launched in 2004, with results confirming relativity to within 0.5% and 15%, respectively, as of December 2008.

By cosmic standards, gravity throughout the solar system is weak. Since the differences between the predictions of Einstein's and Newton's theories are most pronounced when gravity is strong, physicists have long been interested in testing various relativistic effects in a setting with comparatively strong gravitational fields. This has become possible thanks to precision observations of <a href="binary%20pulsar">binary pulsar</a>s. In such a star system, two highly compact <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>s orbit each other. At least one of them is a <a href="pulsar">pulsar</a> – an astronomical object that emits a tight beam of radiowaves. These beams strike the Earth at very regular intervals, similarly to the way that the rotating beam of a lighthouse means that an observer sees the lighthouse blink, and can be observed as a highly regular series of pulses. General relativity predicts specific deviations from the regularity of these radio pulses. For instance, at times when the radio waves pass close to the other neutron star, they should be deflected by the star's gravitational field. The observed pulse patterns are impressively close to those predicted by general relativity.

One particular set of observations is related to eminently useful practical applications, namely to <a href="satellite%20navigation%20system">satellite navigation system</a>s such as the <a href="Global%20Positioning%20System">Global Positioning System</a> that are used both for precise <a href="navigation">positioning</a> and <a href="timekeeping">timekeeping</a>. Such systems rely on two sets of <a href="atomic%20clocks">atomic clocks</a>: clocks aboard satellites orbiting the Earth, and reference clocks stationed on the Earth's surface. General relativity predicts that these two sets of clocks should tick at slightly different rates, due to their different motions (an effect already predicted by special relativity) and their different positions within the Earth's gravitational field. In order to ensure the system's accuracy, the satellite clocks are either slowed down by a relativistic factor, or that same factor is made part of the evaluation algorithm. In turn, tests of the system's accuracy (especially the very thorough measurements that are part of the definition of <a href="UTC">universal coordinated time</a>) are testament to the validity of the relativistic predictions.

A number of other tests have probed the validity of various versions of the <a href="equivalence%20principle">equivalence principle</a>; strictly speaking, all measurements of gravitational time dilation are tests of the <a href="Weak%20equivalence%20principle">weak version of that principle</a>, not of general relativity itself. So far, general relativity has passed all observational tests.

Models based on general relativity play an important role in <a href="astrophysics">astrophysics</a>; the success of these models is further testament to the theory's validity.

Since light is deflected in a gravitational field, it is possible for the light of a distant object to reach an observer along two or more paths. For instance, light of a very distant object such as a <a href="quasar">quasar</a> can pass along one side of a massive <a href="galaxy">galaxy</a> and be deflected slightly so as to reach an observer on Earth, while light
passing along the opposite side of that same galaxy is deflected as well, reaching the same observer from a slightly different direction. As a result, that particular observer will see one astronomical object in two different places in the night sky. This kind of focussing is well-known when it comes to <a href="optical%20lens">optical lens</a>es, and hence the corresponding gravitational effect is called <a href="gravitational%20lensing">gravitational lensing</a>.

<a href="Observational%20astronomy">Observational astronomy</a> uses lensing effects as an important tool to infer properties of the lensing object. Even in cases where that object is not directly visible, the shape of a lensed image provides information about the <a href="mass">mass</a> distribution responsible for the light deflection. In particular, gravitational lensing provides one way to measure the distribution of <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a>, which does not give off light and can be observed only by its gravitational effects. One particularly interesting application are large-scale observations, where the lensing masses are spread out over a significant fraction of the observable universe, and can be used to obtain information about the large-scale properties and evolution of our cosmos.

<a href="Gravitational%20wave">Gravitational wave</a>s, a direct consequence of Einstein's theory, are distortions of geometry that propagate at the speed of light, and can be thought of as ripples in spacetime. They should not be confused with the <a href="gravity%20wave">gravity wave</a>s of <a href="fluid%20dynamics">fluid dynamics</a>, which are a different concept.

In February 2016, the Advanced <a href="LIGO">LIGO</a> team announced that they had directly <a href="Gravitational%20wave%20observation">observed gravitational waves</a> from a <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a> merger.

Indirectly, the effect of gravitational waves had been detected in observations of specific binary stars. Such pairs of stars <a href="orbit">orbit</a> each other and, as they do so, gradually lose energy by emitting gravitational waves. For ordinary stars like the Sun, this energy loss would be too small to be detectable, but this energy loss was observed in 1974 in a <a href="binary%20pulsar">binary pulsar</a> called <a href="PSR1913%2B16">PSR1913+16</a>. In such a system, one of the orbiting stars is a pulsar. This has two consequences: a pulsar is an extremely dense object known as a <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>, for which gravitational wave emission is much stronger than for ordinary stars. Also, a pulsar emits a narrow beam of <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> from its magnetic poles. As the pulsar rotates, its beam sweeps over the Earth, where it is seen as a regular series of radio pulses, just as a ship at sea observes regular flashes of light from the rotating light in a lighthouse. This regular pattern of radio pulses functions as a highly accurate "clock". It can be used to time the double star's orbital period, and it reacts sensitively to distortions of spacetime in its immediate neighborhood.

The discoverers of PSR1913+16, <a href="Russell%20Alan%20Hulse">Russell Hulse</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Hooton%20Taylor%2C%20Jr.">Joseph Taylor</a>, were awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1993. Since then, several other binary pulsars have been found. The most useful are those in which both stars are pulsars, since they provide accurate tests of general relativity.

Currently, a number of land-based <a href="gravitational%20wave%20detector">gravitational wave detector</a>s are in operation, and a mission to launch a space-based detector, <a href="Laser%20Interferometer%20Space%20Antenna">LISA</a>, is currently under development, with a precursor mission (<a href="LISA%20Pathfinder">LISA Pathfinder</a>) which was launched in 2015. Gravitational wave observations can be used to obtain information about compact objects such as <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>s and <a href="black%20holes">black holes</a>, and also to probe the state of the early <a href="universe">universe</a> fractions of a second after the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a>.

When mass is concentrated into a sufficiently <a href="Hoop%20conjecture">compact</a> region of space, general relativity predicts the formation of a <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a> – a region of space with a gravitational effect so strong that not even light can escape. Certain types of black holes are thought to be the final state in the <a href="Stellar%20evolution">evolution</a> of massive <a href="star">star</a>s. On the other hand, <a href="supermassive%20black%20hole">supermassive black hole</a>s with the mass of <a href="million">million</a>s or <a href="1000000000%20%28number%29">billions</a> of <a href="Sun">Sun</a>s are assumed to reside in the cores of most <a href="galaxy">galaxies</a>, and they play a key role in current models of how galaxies have formed over the past billions of years.

Matter falling onto a compact object is one of the most efficient mechanisms for releasing <a href="energy">energy</a> in the form of <a href="radiation">radiation</a>, and matter falling onto black holes is thought to be responsible for some of the brightest astronomical phenomena imaginable. Notable examples of great interest to astronomers are <a href="quasars">quasars</a> and other types of <a href="Active%20galactic%20nucleus">active galactic nuclei</a>. Under the right conditions, falling matter accumulating around a black hole can lead to the formation of <a href="Relativistic%20jet">jet</a>s, in which focused beams of matter are flung away into space at speeds near <a href="Lightspeed">that of light</a>.

There are several properties that make black holes most promising sources of gravitational waves. One reason is that black holes are the most compact objects that can orbit each other as part of a binary system; as a result, the gravitational waves emitted by such a system are especially strong. Another reason follows from what are called <a href="No-hair%20theorem">black-hole uniqueness theorems</a>: over time, black holes retain only a minimal set of distinguishing features (these theorems have become known as "no-hair" theorems), regardless of the starting geometric shape. For instance, in the long term, the collapse of a hypothetical matter cube will not result in a cube-shaped black hole. Instead, the resulting black hole will be indistinguishable from a black hole formed by the collapse of a spherical mass. In its transition to a spherical shape, the black hole formed by the collapse of a more complicated shape will emit gravitational waves.

One of the most important aspects of general relativity is that it can be applied to the <a href="universe">universe</a> as a whole. A key point is that, on large scales, our universe appears to be constructed along very simple lines: all current observations suggest that, on average, the structure of the cosmos should be approximately the same, regardless of an observer's location or direction of observation: the universe is approximately <a href="Homogeneity%20%28physics%29">homogeneous</a> and <a href="isotropic">isotropic</a>. Such comparatively simple universes can be described by simple solutions of Einstein's equations. The current <a href="Physical%20cosmology">cosmological models</a> of the universe are obtained by combining these simple solutions to general relativity with theories describing the properties of the universe's <a href="matter">matter</a> content, namely <a href="thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a>, <a href="Nuclear%20physics">nuclear-</a> and <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a>. According to these models, our present universe emerged from an extremely dense high-temperature state – the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a> – roughly 14 <a href="1000000000%20%28number%29">billion</a> <a href="year">year</a>s ago and has been <a href="Cosmic%20expansion">expanding</a> ever since.

Einstein's equations can be generalized by adding a term called the <a href="cosmological%20constant">cosmological constant</a>. When this term is present, <a href="Vacuum">empty space</a> itself acts as a source of attractive (or, less commonly, repulsive) gravity. Einstein originally introduced this term in his pioneering 1917 paper on cosmology, with a very specific motivation: contemporary cosmological thought held the universe to be static, and the additional term was required for constructing static model universes within the framework of general relativity. When it became apparent that the universe is not static, but expanding, Einstein was quick to discard this additional term. Since the end of the 1990s, however, astronomical evidence indicating an <a href="Aceleration">accelerating</a> expansion consistent with a cosmological constant – or, equivalently, with a particular and ubiquitous kind of <a href="dark%20energy">dark energy</a> – has steadily been accumulating.

General relativity is very successful in providing a framework for accurate models which describe an impressive array of physical phenomena. On the other hand, there are many interesting open questions, and in particular, the theory as a whole is almost certainly incomplete.

In contrast to all other modern theories of <a href="fundamental%20interaction">fundamental interaction</a>s, general relativity is a <a href="Classical%20physics">classical</a> theory: it does not include the effects of <a href="Introduction%20to%20quantum%20mechanics">quantum physics</a>. The quest for a quantum version of general relativity addresses one of the most fundamental <a href="List%20of%20unsolved%20problems%20in%20physics">open questions</a> in physics. While there are promising candidates for such a theory of <a href="quantum%20gravity">quantum gravity</a>, notably <a href="string%20theory">string theory</a> and <a href="loop%20quantum%20gravity">loop quantum gravity</a>, there is at present no consistent and complete theory. It has long been hoped that a theory of quantum gravity would also eliminate another problematic feature of general relativity: the presence of <a href="Spacetime%20singularity">spacetime singularities</a>. These singularities are boundaries ("sharp edges") of spacetime at which geometry becomes ill-defined, with the consequence that general relativity itself loses its predictive power. Furthermore, there are so-called <a href="Penrose-Hawking%20singularity%20theorems">singularity theorems</a> which predict that such singularities "must" exist within the universe if the laws of general relativity were to hold without any quantum modifications. The best-known examples are the singularities associated with the model universes that describe black holes and the <a href="Big%20bang">beginning of the universe</a>.

Other attempts to modify general relativity have been made in the context of <a href="cosmology">cosmology</a>. In the modern cosmological models, most energy in the universe is in forms that have never been detected directly, namely <a href="dark%20energy">dark energy</a> and <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a>. There have been several controversial proposals to remove the need for these enigmatic forms of matter and energy, by modifying the laws governing gravity and the dynamics of <a href="cosmic%20expansion">cosmic expansion</a>, for example <a href="modified%20Newtonian%20dynamics">modified Newtonian dynamics</a>.

Beyond the challenges of quantum effects and cosmology, research on general relativity is rich with possibilities for further exploration: mathematical relativists explore the nature of singularities and the fundamental properties of Einstein's equations, and ever more comprehensive computer simulations of specific spacetimes (such as those describing merging black holes) are run.
More than ninety years after the theory was first published, research is more active than ever.

Alodia

Alodia, also known as Alwa (<a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>: , "Aroua"; , " 'Alwa"), was a <a href="medieval">medieval</a> <a href="Nubians">Nubian</a> kingdom in what is now Central and Southern <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a>. Its capital was the city of <a href="Soba%20%28city%29">Soba</a>, located near modern-day <a href="Khartoum">Khartoum</a> at the confluence of the <a href="Blue%20Nile">Blue</a> and <a href="White%20Nile">White Nile</a> rivers.

Founded sometime after the ancient <a href="kingdom%20of%20Kush">kingdom of Kush</a> fell, in around 350 AD, Alodia is first mentioned in historical records in 569. It was the last of the three Nubian kingdoms to convert to <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> in 580 following <a href="Nobadia">Nobadia</a> and <a href="Makuria">Makuria</a>. It possibly reached its peak during the 9th–12th centuries when records show that it controlled much of central and southern Sudan. It exceeded its northern neighbor, Makuria, with which it maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity. Being a large, multicultural state, Alodia was administrated by a powerful king and provincial governors appointed by him. The capital Soba, described as a town of "extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens", prospered as a trading hub. Goods arrived from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Literacy in both <a href="Nubian%20languages">Nubian</a> and <a href="Medieval%20Greek">Greek</a> flourished.

From the 12th, and especially the 13th century, Alodia was declining, possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. In the 14th century the country might have been ravaged by the <a href="plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a>, while <a href="Arab">Arab</a> tribes began to migrate into the <a href="Nile%23In%20Sudan">Upper Nile valley</a>. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the <a href="Funj">Funj</a>. This likely marked the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the <a href="kingdom%20of%20Fazughli">kingdom of Fazughli</a> within the <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>n-Sudanese borderlands. After the destruction of Soba, the Funj established the <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Sennar">Sultanate of Sennar</a>, ushering in a period of <a href="Islamization">Islamization</a> and <a href="Arabization">Arabization</a>.

Alodia is by far the least studied of the three medieval <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>n kingdoms, hence evidence is very slim. What is known about it comes mostly from a handful of medieval Arabic historians. The most important of these are the <a href="Geography%20and%20cartography%20in%20medieval%20Islam">Islamic geographers</a> <a href="Ya%27qubi">al-Yaqubi</a> (9th century), <a href="Ibn%20Hawqal">Ibn Hawqal</a> and <a href="Ibn%20Sulaym%20al-Aswani">al-Aswani</a> (10th century), who both visited the country, and the <a href="Copts">Copt</a> <a href="Abu%20al-Makarim">Abu al-Makarim</a> (12th century). The events around the Christianization of the kingdom in the 6th century were described by the contemporary <a href="bishop">bishop</a> <a href="John%20of%20Ephesus">John of Ephesus</a>; various post-medieval Sudanese sources address its fall. Al-Aswani noted that he interacted with a <a href="Nubians">Nubian</a> historian who was "well-acquainted with the country of Alwa", but no medieval Nubian <a href="Historiography">historiographical</a> work has yet been discovered.

While many Alodian sites are known, only the capital <a href="Soba%20%28city%29">Soba</a> has been extensively excavated. Parts of this site were unearthed in the early 1950s, further excavations taking place in the 1980s and 1990s. A new multidisciplinary research project is scheduled to start in late 2019. Soba is approximately in size and is covered with numerous mounds of brick rubble previously belonging to monumental structures. Discoveries made so far include several churches, a palace, cemeteries and numerous small finds.

Alodia was located in Nubia, a region which, in the <a href="middle%20ages">middle ages</a>, extended from <a href="Aswan">Aswan</a> in southern <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> to an undetermined point south of the confuence of the <a href="White%20Nile">White</a> and <a href="Blue%20Nile">Blue Nile</a> rivers. The heartland of the kingdom was the <a href="Al%20Jazirah%20%28state%29">Gezira</a>, a fertile plain bounded by the White Nile in the west and the Blue Nile in the east. In contrast to the White Nile Valley, the Blue Nile Valley is rich in known Alodian archaeological sites, among them Soba. The extent of the Alodian influence to the south is unclear, although it is likely that it bordered the <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>n highlands. The southernmost known Alodian sites are in the proximity of <a href="Sennar">Sennar</a>.

To the west of the White Nile, Ibn Hawqal differentiated between Al-Jeblien, which was controlled by <a href="Makuria">Makuria</a> and probably corresponded with northern <a href="Kordofan">Kordofan</a>, and the Alodian-controlled Al-Ahdin, which has been identified with the <a href="Nuba%20Mountains">Nuba Mountains</a>, and perhaps extended as far south as <a href="Jebel%20al%20Liri">Jebel al Liri</a>, near the modern border to <a href="South%20Sudan">South Sudan</a>. Nubian connections with <a href="Darfur">Darfur</a> have been suggested, but evidence is lacking.

The northern region of Alodia probably extended from the confluence of the two Niles downstream to <a href="Abu%20Hamad">Abu Hamad</a> near <a href="Mograt%20Island">Mograt Island</a>. Abu Hamad likely constituted the northernmost outpost of the Alodian province known as al-Abwab ("the gates"), although some scholars also suggest a more southerly location, nearer the <a href="Atbara%20River">Atbara River</a>. No evidence for a major Alodian settlement has been discovered north of the confluence of the two Niles, although several forts have been recorded there.

Lying between the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> and the Atbara was the <a href="Butana">Butana</a>, grassland suitable for <a href="pastoralism">livestock</a>. Along the Atbara and the adjacent <a href="Mareb%20River">Gash Delta</a> (near <a href="Kassala">Kassala</a>) many Christian sites have been noted. According to Ibn Hawqal, a vassal king loyal to Alodia governed the region around the Gash Delta. The accounts of both Ibn Hawqal and al-Aswani suggest that Alodia also controlled the <a href="Eastern%20desert">desert</a> along the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a> coast.

The name Alodia might be of considerable antiquity, perhaps appearing first as "Alut" on a <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kush">Kushite</a> <a href="stela">stela</a> from the late 4th century BC. It appeared again as "Alwa" on a list of Kushite towns by the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> author <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> (1st century AD), said to be located south of <a href="Meroe">Meroe</a>. Another town named "Alwa" is mentioned in a 4th-century <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Aksum">Aksumite</a> inscription, this time located near the confluence of the Nile and the Atbara rivers.
By the early 4th century the kingdom of Kush, which used to control much of Sudan's riverbanks, was in decline, and Nubians (speakers of <a href="Nubian%20languages">Nubian languages</a>) began to settle in the Nile Valley. They originally lived west of the Nile, but changes in the climate forced them eastward, resulting in conflicts with Kush from at least the 1st-century BC. In the mid-4th century the Nubians occupied most of the area once controlled by Kush, while it was limited to the northern reaches of the Butana. An Aksumite inscription mentions how the warlike Nubians also threatened the borders of the Aksumite kingdom north of the <a href="Tekez%C3%A9%20River">Tekeze River</a>, resulting in an Aksumite expedition. It describes a Nubian defeat by Aksumite forces and a subsequent march to the confluence of the Nile and Atbara. There the Aksumites plundered several Kushite towns, including Alwa.

Archaeological evidence suggests the kingdom of Kush ceased to exist in the middle of the 4th century. It is not known whether the Aksumite expeditions played a direct role in its fall. It seems likely that the Aksumite presence in Nubia was short-lived. Eventually, the region saw the development of regional centres whose ruling elites were buried in large <a href="tumulus">tumuli</a>. Such tumuli, within what would become Alodia, are known from <a href="El-Hobagi">El-Hobagi</a>, <a href="Jebel%20Qisi">Jebel Qisi</a> and perhaps <a href="Jebel%20Aulia%20Dam">Jebel Aulia</a>. The excavated tumuli of El-Hobagi are known to date to the late 4th century, and contained an assortment of weaponry imitating Kushite royal funerary rituals. Meanwhile, many Kushite temples and settlements, including the former capital Meroe, seem to have been largely abandoned. The Kushites themselves were absorbed into the Nubians and their <a href="Meroitic%20language">language</a> was replaced by Nubian.

How the kingdom of Alodia came into being is unknown. Its formation was completed by the mid-6th century, when it is said to have existed alongside the other Nubian kingdoms of <a href="Nobadia">Nobadia</a> and Makuria in the north. Soba, which by the 6th century had developed into a major urban center, served as its capital. In 569 the kingdom of Alodia was mentioned for the first time, being described by John of Ephesus as a kingdom on the cusp of <a href="Christianization">Christianization</a>. Independently of John of Ephesus, the kingdom's existence is also verified by a late 6th century <a href="Medieval%20Greek">Greek</a> document from <a href="Byzantine%20Egypt">Byzantine Egypt</a>, describing the sale of an Alodian slave girl.

John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the <a href="Coptic%20Orthodox%20Church%20of%20Alexandria">Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria</a>. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in <a href="Musawwarat%20es-Sufra">Musawwarat es-Sufra</a>, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.

Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Egypt">conquered Egypt</a> from the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent <a href="Islam">Muslim</a> invasions, one in <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Dongola">641/642</a> and another in <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Dongola">652</a>. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the "<a href="Baqt">Baqt</a>", a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of <a href="Aydhab">Aydhab</a> and <a href="Badi%2C%20Sudan">Badi</a> in the 7th century and <a href="Suakin">Suakin</a>, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the <a href="Beja%20people">Beja</a> throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century.

Based on the archaeological evidence it has been suggested that Alodia's capital Soba underwent its peak development between the 9th and 12th centuries. In the 9th century, Alodia was, albeit briefly, described for the first time by the Arab historian al-Yaqubi. In his short account, Alodia is said to be the stronger of the two Nubian kingdoms, being a country requiring a three-month journey to cross. He also recorded that Muslims would occasionally travel there.

A century later, in the mid-10th century, Alodia was visited by traveler and historian Ibn Hawqal, resulting in the most comprehensive known account of the kingdom. He described the geography and people of Alodia in considerable detail, giving the impression of a large, polyethnic state. He also noted its prosperity, having an "uninterrupted chain of villages and a continuous strip of cultivated lands". When Ibn Hawqal arrived, the ruling king was named Eusebius, who was, upon his death, succeeded by his nephew Stephanos. Another Alodian king from this period was David, who is known from a tombstone in Soba. His rule was initially dated to 999–1015, but based on <a href="paleography">paleographical</a> grounds it is now dated more broadly, to the 9th or 10th centuries.

Ibn Hawqal's report describing Alodia's geography was largely confirmed by al-Aswani, a <a href="Fatimids">Fatimid</a> ambassador sent to Makuria, who went on to travel to Alodia. In a similar manner to al-Yaqubi's description of 100 years before, Alodia was noted as being more powerful than Makuria, more extensive and having a larger army. The capital Soba was a prosperous town with "fine buildings, and extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens", while also having a large Muslim quarter.

Abu al-Makarim (12th century) was the last historian to refer to Alodia in detail. It was still described as a large, Christian kingdom housing around 400 churches. A particularly large and finely constructed one was said to be located in Soba, called the "Church of Manbali". Two Alodian kings, Basil and Paul, are mentioned in 12th century Arabic letters from <a href="Qasr%20Ibrim">Qasr Ibrim</a>.

There is evidence that at certain periods there were close relations between the Alodian and the Makurian royal families. It is possible that the throne frequently passed to a king whose father was of the royal family of the other state. Nubiologist <a href="W%C5%82odzimierz%20Godlewski">Włodzimierz Godlewski</a> states that it was under the Makurian king <a href="Merkurios%20of%20Makuria">Merkurios</a> (early 8th century) that the two kingdoms began to approach each other. In 943 <a href="Al-Masudi">al Masudi</a> wrote that the Makurian king ruled over Alodia, while Ibn Hawqal wrote that it was the other way around. The 11th century saw the appearance of a new royal crown in Makurian art; it has been suggested that this derived from the Alodian court. King <a href="Moses%20George%20of%20Makuria">Mouses Georgios</a>, who is known to have ruled in Makuria in the second half of the 12th century, most likely ruled both kingdoms via a <a href="personal%20union">personal union</a>. Considering that in his royal title ("king of the Arouades and Makuritai") Alodia is mentioned before Makuria, he might have initially been an Alodian king. 

Archaeological evidence from Soba suggests a decline of the town, and therefore possibly the Alodian kingdom, from the 12th century. By 1300 the decline of Alodia was well advanced. No pottery or glassware postdating the 13th century has been identified at Soba. Two churches were apparently destroyed during the 13th century, although they were rebuilt shortly afterwards. It has been suggested that Alodia was under attack by an African, possibly <a href="Nilotes">Nilotic</a>, people called Damadim who originated from the border region of modern Sudan and South Sudan, along the <a href="Bahr%20el%20Ghazal%20River">Bahr el Ghazal River</a>. According to geographer <a href="Ibn%20Sa%27id%20al-Maghribi">Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi</a>, they attacked Nubia in 1220. Soba may have been conquered at this time, suffering occupation and destruction. In the late 13th century, another invasion by an unspecified people from the south occurred. In the same period poet <a href="al-Harrani%20%28poet%29">al-Harrani</a> wrote that Alodia's capital was now called Waylula, described as "very large" and "built on the west bank of the Nile". In the early 14th century geographer <a href="Al-Dimashqi%20%28geographer%29">Shamsaddin al-Dimashqi</a> wrote that the capital was a place named Kusha, located far from the Nile, where water had to be obtained from wells.

Economic factors also seem to have played a part in Alodia's decline. From the 10th to 12th centuries the <a href="East%20Africa">East Africa</a>n coast saw the rise of new trading cities such as <a href="Kilwa">Kilwa</a>. These were direct mercantile competitors since they exported similar goods to Nubia. A period of severe droughts occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa between 1150 and 1500 would have affected the Nubian economy as well. <a href="Paleoethnobotany">Archeobotanical</a> evidence from Soba suggests the town suffered from <a href="overgrazing">overgrazing</a> and overcultivation.

By 1276 al-Abwab, previously described as the northernmost Alodian province, was recorded as an <a href="Kingdom%20of%20al-Abwab">independent splinter kingdom</a> ruling over vast territories. The precise circumstances of its secession and its relations with Alodia thereafter remain unknown. Based on pottery finds it has been suggested that al-Abwab continued to thrive until the 15th and perhaps even the 16th century. In 1286 a <a href="Mamluk%20Sultanate%20%28Cairo%29">Mamluke</a> prince sent messengers to several rulers in central Sudan. It is not clear if they were still subject to the king in Soba or if they were independent, implying a fragmentation of Alodia into multiple petty states by the late 13th century. In 1317 a Mamluk expedition pursued Arab brigands as far south as Kassala in Taka (one of the regions which received a Mamluk messenger in 1286), marching through al-Abwab and Makuria on their return.

During the 14th and 15th centuries much of what is now Sudan was overrun by <a href="Arab">Arab</a> tribes. They perhaps profited from the <a href="Plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a> which might have ravaged Nubia in the mid-14th century killing many sedentary Nubians, but not affecting the nomadic Arabs. They would have then intermixed with the remaining local population, gradually taking control over land and people, greatly benefiting from their large population in spreading their culture. The first recorded Arab migration to Nubia dates to 1324. It was the disintegration of Makuria in the late 14th century that, according to archaeologist <a href="William%20Y.%20Adams">William Y. Adams</a>, caused the "flood gates" to "burst wide open". Many, initially coming from Egypt, followed the course of the Nile until they reached <a href="Al%20Dabbah">Al Dabbah</a>. Here they headed west to migrate along the <a href="Wadi%20Al-Malik">Wadi Al-Malik</a> to reach Darfur or Kordofan. Alodia, in particular the Butana and the Gezira, was the target of those Arabs who had lived among the Beja in the Eastern Desert for centuries.

Initially, the kingdom was able to exercise authority over some of the newly arrived Arab groups, forcing them to pay tribute. The situation grew increasingly precarious as more Arabs arrived. By the second half of the 15th century, Arabs had settled in the entire central Sudanese Nile valley, except for the area around Soba, which was all that was left of Alodia's domain. In 1474 it was recorded that Arabs founded the town of <a href="Arbaji">Arbaji</a> on the Blue Nile, which would quickly develop into an important centre of commerce and Islamic learning. In around 1500 the Nubians were recorded to be in a state of total political fragmentation, as they had no king, but 150 independent lordships centered around castles on both sides of the Nile. Archaeology attests that Soba was largely ruined by this time.

It is unclear if the kingdom of Alodia was destroyed by the Arabs under <a href="Abdallah%20Jammah">Abdallah Jammah</a> or by the <a href="Funj">Funj</a>, an African group from the south led by their king <a href="Amara%20Dunqas">Amara Dunqas</a>. Most modern scholars agree now that it fell due to the Arabs.

Abdallah Jammah ("Abdallah the gatherer"), the eponymous ancestor of the Sudanese <a href="Abdallabi%20tribe">Abdallab tribe</a>, was a <a href="Rufa%27a%20Arabs">Rufa'a</a> Arab who, according to Sudanese traditions, settled in the Nile Valley after coming from the east. He consolidated his power and established his capital at <a href="Qerri">Qerri</a>, just north of the confluence of the two Niles. In the late 15th century he gathered the Arab tribes to act against the Alodian "tyranny", as it is called, which has been interpreted as having a religious-economic motive. The Muslim Arabs no longer accepted the rule of, nor taxation by, a Christian ruler. Under Abdallah's leadership Alodia and its capital Soba were destroyed, resulting in rich booty such as a "bejeweled crown" and a "famous necklace of pearls and rubies".

According to another tradition recorded in old documents from <a href="Shendi">Shendi</a>, Soba was destroyed by Abdallah Jammah in 1509 having already been attacked in 1474. The idea of uniting the Arabs against Alodia is said to have already been on the mind of an <a href="emir">emir</a> who lived between 1439 and 1459. To this end, he migrated from <a href="Barah%2C%20Sudan">Bara</a> in Kordofan to a mountain near <a href="Ed%20Dueim">Ed Dueim</a> on the White Nile. Under his grandson, called Emir Humaydan, the White Nile was crossed. There he met other Arab tribes and attacked Alodia. The king of Alodia was killed, but the "patriarch", probably the <a href="archbishop">archbishop</a> of Soba, managed to flee. He soon returned to Soba. A puppet king was crowned and an army of Nubians, Beja and <a href="Ethiopian%20Empire">Abyssinians</a> was assembled to fight "for the sake of religion". Meanwhile, the Arab alliance was about to fracture, but Abdallah Jammah reunited them, while also allying with the Funj king Amara Dunqas. Together they finally defeated and killed the patriarch, razing Soba afterwards and enslaving its population.

The "<a href="Funj%20Chronicle">Funj Chronicle</a>", a multi-authored history of the <a href="Funj%20Sultanate">Funj Sultanate</a> compiled in the 19th century, ascribes the destruction of Alodia to King Amara Dunqas; he was also allied with Abdallah Jammah. This attack is dated to the <a href="Hijri%20year">9th century after the Hijra</a> ( 1396–1494). Afterwards, Soba is said to have served as the capital of the Funj until the foundation of Sennar in 1504. The "<a href="Tabaqat%20Dayfallah">Tabaqat Dayfallah</a>", a history of <a href="Sufism">Sufism</a> in Sudan ( 1700), briefly mentions that the Funj attacked and defeated the "kingdom of the Nuba" in 1504–1505.

Historian <a href="Jay%20Spaulding">Jay Spaulding</a> proposes that the fall of Soba was not necessarily the end of Alodia. According to the <a href="Judaism">Jewish</a> traveler <a href="David%20Reubeni">David Reubeni</a>, who visited the country in 1523, there was still a "kingdom of Soba" on the eastern bank of the Blue Nile, although he explicitly noted Soba itself was in ruins. This matches the oral traditions from the Upper Blue Nile, which claim that Alodia survived Soba's fall and still existed along the Blue Nile. It had gradually retreated to the mountains of <a href="Fazughli">Fazughli</a> in the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands, forming the <a href="kingdom%20of%20Fazughli">kingdom of Fazughli</a>. Recent excavations in western Ethiopia seem to confirm the theory of an Alodian migration. The Funj eventually conquered Fazughli in 1685 and its population, known as <a href="Hamaj">Hamaj</a>, became a fundamental part of Sennar, eventually <a href="Hamaj%20Regency">seizing power</a> in 1761–1762. As recently as 1930 Hamaj villagers in the southern Gezira would swear by "Soba the home of my grandfathers and grandmothers which can make the stone float and the cotton ball sink".
In 1504–1505 the Funj founded the Funj sultanate, incorporating Abdallah Jammah's domain, which, according to some traditions, happened after a battle where Amara Dunqas defeated him. The Funj maintained some medieval Nubian customs like the wearing of crowns with features resembling <a href="bovinae">bovine</a> horns, called "taqiya umm qarnein", the shaving of the head of a king upon his coronation, and, according to Jay Spaulding, the custom of raising princes separately from their mothers, under strict confinement.

The aftermath of Alodia's fall saw extensive <a href="Arabization">Arabization</a>, with the Nubians embracing the tribal system of the Arab migrants. Those living along the Nile between al Dabbah in the north and the confluence of the two Niles in the south were subsumed into the <a href="Ja%27alin%20tribe">Ja'alin tribe</a>. To the east, west and south of the Ja'alin the country was now dominated by tribes claiming a <a href="Juhaynah">Juhaynah</a> ancestry. In the area around Soba, the tribal Abdallab identity prevailed. The Nubian language was spoken in central Sudan until the 19th century, when it was replaced by <a href="Sudanese%20Arabic">Arabic</a>. Sudanse Arabic preserved many words of Nubian origin, and Nubian place names can be found as far south as the <a href="Blue%20Nile%20%28state%29">Blue Nile state</a>.
The fate of Christianity in the region remains largely unknown. The church institutions would have collapsed together with the fall of the kingdom, resulting in the decline of the Christian faith and the rise of Islam in its stead. <a href="Islamization">Islamized</a> groups from northern Nubia began to proselytize the Gezira. As early as 1523 King Amara Dunqas, who was initially a Pagan or nominal Christian, was recorded to be Muslim. Nevertheless, in the 16th century large portions of the Nubians still regarded themselves as Christians. A traveler who visited Nubia around 1500 confirms this, while also saying that the Nubians were so lacking in Christian instruction they had no knowledge of the faith. In 1520 Nubian ambassadors reached Ethiopia and petitioned the Emperor for priests. They claimed that no more priests could reach Nubia because of the wars between Muslims, leading to a decline of Christianity in their land. In the first half of the 17th century, a prophecy made by the Sudanese Sheikh Idris Wad al-Arbab mentioned a church in the Nuba Mountains. As late as the early 1770s there was said to be a Christian princedom in the Ethiopian-Sudanese border area, called Shaira. <a href="Apotropaic%20magic">Apotropaic rituals</a> stemming from Christian practices outlived the conversion to Islam. As late as the 20th century several practices of undoubtedly Christian origin were "common, though of course not universal, in <a href="Omdurman">Omdurman</a>, the Gezira and Kordofan", usually revolving around the application of crosses on humans and objects.

Soba, which remained inhabited until at least the early 17th century, served, among many other ruined Alodian sites, as a steady supply of <a href="Brick%23Fired%20brick">bricks</a> and stones for nearby <a href="Qubba">Qubba shrines</a>, dedicated to Sufi holy men. During the early 19th century many of the remaining bricks in Soba were plundered for the construction of <a href="Khartoum">Khartoum</a>, the new capital of <a href="Turkish%20Sudan">Turkish Sudan</a>.

While information about Alodia's government is sparse, it was likely similar to <a href="Makuria%23Government">that of Makuria</a>. The head of state was the king who, according to al-Aswani, reigned as an <a href="Absolute%20monarchy">absolute monarch</a>. He was recorded to be able to enslave any of his subjects at will, who would not oppose his decision, but prostrated themselves before him. As in Makuria, succession to the Alodian throne was <a href="Matrilineal%20succession">matrilineal</a>: it was the son of the king's sister, not his son who succeeded to the throne. There might be evidence a mobile royal encampment existed, although the translation of the original source, Abu al-Makarim, is not certain. Similar mobile courts are known to have existed in the early Funj sultanate, Ethiopia and <a href="Darfur%20Sultanate">Darfur</a>.

The kingdom was divided into several provinces under the sovereignty of Soba. It seems delegates of the king governed these provinces. Al-Aswani stated that the governor of the northern al-Abwab province was appointed by the king. This was similar to what Ibn Hawqal recorded for the Gash Delta region, which was ruled by an appointed Arabophone (Arabic speaker). In 1286, Mamluk emissaries were sent to several rulers in central Sudan. It is unclear whether those rulers were actually independent, or if they remained subordinate to the king of Alodia. If the latter was the case, this would provide an understanding of the kingdom's territorial organization. The "<a href="Sahib">Sahib</a>" of al-Abwab seems certain to have been independent. Apart from al-Abwab, the following regions are mentioned: Al-Anag (possibly Fazughli); Ari; Barah; Befal; Danfou; Kedru (possibly after Kadero, a village north of Khartoum); Kersa (the Gezira); and Taka (the region around the Gash Delta).

State and church were intertwined in Alodia, with the Alodian kings probably serving as its patrons. Coptic documents observed by <a href="Johann%20Michael%20Vansleb">Johann Michael Vansleb</a> during the later 17th century list the following bishoprics in the Alodian kingdom: Arodias, Borra, Gargara, Martin, Banazi, and Menkesa. Arodias might have referred to the bishopric in Soba. The bishops were dependent on the patriarch of Alexandria.

Alodia may have had a standing army, in which cavalry likely projected force and symbolized royal authority deep into the provinces. Because of their speed, horses were also important for communication, providing a rapid courier service between the capital and the provinces. Aside from horses, boats also played a central role in transportation infrastructure.

While Alodia was polyethnic, and hence polylingual, it was essentially a Nubian state whose majority spoke a Nubian language. Based on the limited extant evidence, the Alodian Nubian language, although closely related, appears to have been distinct from the <a href="Old%20Nobiin">Old Nobiin</a> language of northern Nubia. In the 1830s it was said a Nubian language was still being spoken as far south as <a href="Berber%2C%20Sudan">Berber</a> near the junction of the Nile and the Atbara. It was supposedly similar to <a href="Kenzi%20language">Kenzi</a> but with many differences. The Alodian language was written in a variant of the <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek alphabet</a>, as was the case in Makuria, although it had five or six additional letters unknown to the Old Nobiin alphabet.
Although Greek, a prestigious sacral language, was used, it does not appear to have been spoken. An example of the use of Greek in Alodia is the tombstone of King David from Soba, where it is written with quite correct grammar. Al-Aswani noted that books were written in Greek and then translated into Nubian. The Christian <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a> was also in Greek. <a href="Coptic%20language">Coptic</a> was probably used to communicate with the Patriarch of Alexandria, but written Coptic remains are very sparse.

Apart from Nubian, a multitude of languages were spoken throughout the kingdom. In the Nuba mountains several <a href="Kordofanian%20languages">Kordofanian languages</a> occurred together with <a href="Hill%20Nubian%20language">Hill Nubian</a> dialects. Upstream along the Blue Nile Eastern Sudanic languages like <a href="Berta%20language">Berta</a> or <a href="Gumuz%20language">Gumuz</a> were spoken. In the eastern territories lived the Beja, who spoke their own <a href="Cushitic%20languages">Cushitic</a> <a href="Beja%20language">language</a>, as did the <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic</a> Arabs and the <a href="Tigre%20people">Tigre</a>.

The existence of 400 churches has been recorded throughout the kingdom; most have yet to be located. Only seven have been identified so far, given the simple names of church "A", "B", "C", "E", the "Mound C" church in Soba, the church in Saqadi and the temple-church in Musawwarat as-Sufra. Churches "A"–"C" as well as the "Mound C" church were <a href="basilica">basilica</a>s comparable to the largest Makurian churches. The Saqadi church was an insertion into a pre-existing structure. Church "E" and the church of Musawwarat es-Sufra were "normal" churches. Thus, the known Alodian houses of worship can be categorized into three classes.

On "Mound B" in Soba lay the standalone complex of the three churches "A", "B" and "C". Churches "A" and "B", both probably built in the mid-9th century, were large buildings, the first measuring and the second . Church "C" was much smaller and built after the other two churches, probably after 900. The three churches had many similarities, including having a <a href="narthex">narthex</a>, wide entrances on the main east-west axis and a <a href="pulpit">pulpit</a> along the north side of the <a href="nave">nave</a>. Differences are evident in the thickness of the bricks used. Church "C" lacked outer <a href="aisle">aisle</a>s. It seems probable that the complex was the ecclesiastical center of Soba, if not the entire kingdom.

Church "E", on a natural mount, was in size (and like all red brick structures in Soba heavily robbed). Its layout was unusual, such as its L-shaped narthex. The roof was supported by wooden beams resting on stone <a href="pedestal">pedestal</a>s. The internal walls used to be covered by painted whitewashed mud; the external walls were rendered in white lime mortar.

The "Mound C" church, perhaps the oldest of the churches of Soba, was around in length. It was the only Alodian church known to have incorporated stone columns. Very little remains of it and its walls, probably made of red bricks, have completely disappeared. Five <a href="Capital%20%28architecture%29">capitals</a> have been noted, belonging to a style that appeared in Nubia at the turn of the 8th century.

The church of Musawwarat es-Sufra, called "Temple III A", was initially a pagan temple but was converted into a church, probably soon after the royal conversion in 580. It was rectangular and slightly skewed, being in size. It was divided into one large and three small rooms. The roof, of an indeterminate shape, was supported by wooden beams. Despite originally being a Kushite temple it still bears similarities to purpose-built churches, for example having an entrance on both the north and south sides.

The southernmost known Nubian church was in Saqadi, a red brick building inserted into a pre-existing building of unknown nature. It had a nave, where two L-shaped walls projected, and at least two <a href="Aisle%23Church%20architecture">aisles</a> with rectangular brick piers between, as well as a range of possibly three rooms across the western end, which was a typically Nubian arrangement.

Nubian church architecture was greatly influenced by that of Egypt, <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>. The constellation of the "Mound B" complex might reflect Byzantine influences. The relations between the church architecture of Makuria and Alodia remain uncertain. What seems clear is that Alodian churches lacked eastern entrances and <a href="tribune%20%28architecture%29">tribunes</a>, features characteristic for churches in northern Nubia. Furthermore, Alodian churches used more wood. Similarities with medieval Ethiopian church architecture are harder to find, only a few details matching.
In medieval Nubia pottery and its decoration were appreciated as an art form. Until the 7th century, the most common pottery type found at Soba was the so-called "Red Ware". These <a href="potter%27s%20wheel">wheel-made</a> hemispherical bowls were made of red or orange <a href="slip%20%28ceramics%29">slip</a> and painted with separated motifs such as boxes with inner cross-hatchings, stylized floral motifs or crosses. The outlines of the motifs were drawn in black while the interiors were white. In their design, they are a direct continuation of Kushite styles, with possible influences from Aksumite Ethiopia. Due to their relative rarity, it has been suggested that they were imported, although they bear similarities to the pottery type, known as "<a href="Soba%20Ware">Soba Ware</a>", that succeeded them.

"Soba Ware" was a type of wheel-made pottery with a distinctive decoration very different from that found in the rest of Nubia. The shape of the pottery was diverse, as was the repertoire of painted decoration. One of the most distinctive features was the use of faces as painted decoration. They were simplified, if not geometric, in form and with big round eyes. This style is foreign to Makuria and Egypt, but bears a resemblance to paintings and manuscripts from Ethiopia. It is possible the potters copied these motifs from local church murals. Also unique was the application of animal-shaped bosses (<a href="protome">protome</a>s). <a href="Ceramic%20glaze">Glazed</a> vessels were also produced, copying <a href="Persia">Persia</a>n <a href="aquamanile">aquamanile</a>s without reaching their quality. Beginning in the 9th century, "Soba Ware" was increasingly replaced by fine ware imported from Makuria.

Alodia was in the <a href="Sahel">savannah belt</a>, giving it an economic advantage over its northern neighbor Makuria. According to al-Aswani the "provisions of the country of Alwa and their king" came from Kersa, which has been identified with the Gezira. North of the confluence of the two Niles agriculture was limited to farms along the river watered by devices like the <a href="shadoof">shadoof</a> or the more sophisticated <a href="sakia">sakia</a>. In contrast, the farmers of the Gezira profited from sufficient rainfall to make rainfall cultivation the economic mainstay.
Archaeological records have provided insight into the types of food grown and consumed in Alodia. At Soba, the primary cereal was <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a>, although <a href="barley">barley</a> and <a href="millet">millet</a> were also known to be consumed. Al-Aswani noted that sorghum was used to make <a href="beer">beer</a> and said that <a href="vineyard">vineyard</a>s were quite rare in Alodia compared to Makuria. There is archaeological evidence of grapes. According to al-Idrisi, <a href="onion">onion</a>s, <a href="horseradish">horseradish</a>, <a href="cucumber">cucumber</a>s, <a href="watermelon">watermelon</a>s and <a href="rapeseed">rapeseed</a> were also cultivated, but none were found at Soba. Instead, <a href="Common%20fig">figs</a>, <a href="acacia">acacia fruits</a>, <a href="Hyphaene%20thebaica">doum palm fruits</a> and <a href="date%20%28fruit%29">dates</a> have been identified.

Sedentary farmers formed one part of Alodia's agriculture, the other consisted of nomads practicing animal husbandry. The relationship between these two groups was symbiotic, resulting in an exchange of goods. Al-Aswani wrote that <a href="beef">beef</a> was plentiful in Alodia, which he attributed to the bountiful grazing land. Archaeological evidence from Soba attests to the relevance <a href="cattle">cattle</a> had there, as most animal bones are attributed to that species, followed by those of <a href="sheep">sheep</a> and <a href="goat">goat</a>s. <a href="Domesticated%20chicken">Chicken</a>s were probably also bred at Soba, although available archaeological proof is very limited, probably due to the fragile nature of bird bones. No remains of <a href="Domestic%20pig">pigs</a> have been identified. Camel remains have been noted, but none bore signs of butchery. Fishing and hunting made only minor contributions to the overall diet of Soba.

Trade was an important source of income for Alodia. Soba served as a trading hub with north-south and east-west trade routes; goods arrived in the kingdom from Makuria, the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, western Africa, <a href="India">India</a> and <a href="China">China</a>. Trade with Makuria probably ran through the <a href="Bayuda%20Desert">Bayuda Desert</a>, following <a href="Wadi%20Abu%20Dom">Wadi Abu Dom</a> or <a href="Wadi%20Muqaddam">Wadi Muqaddam</a>, while another route went from near Abu Hamad to <a href="Korosko">Korosko</a> in <a href="Lower%20Nubia">Lower Nubia</a>. A route going east originated around Berber near the confluence of the Nile and the Atbara, terminating in Badi, Suakin and <a href="Dahlak%20archipelago">Dahlak</a>. Merchant <a href="Benjamin%20of%20Tudela">Benjamin of Tudela</a> mentions a route heading west, going from Alodia to <a href="Zwila">Zuwila</a> in <a href="Fezzan">Fezzan</a>. Archaeological evidence for trade with Ethiopia is virtually absent, although trading relations are suggested by other evidence. Trading with the outside world was handled predominantly by Arab merchants. Muslim merchants were recorded as having traversed Nubia, some living in a district in Soba.

Exports from Alodia likely included raw materials such as <a href="gold">gold</a>, <a href="ivory">ivory</a>, <a href="salt">salt</a> and other tropical products, as well as hides. According to an oral tradition Arab merchants came to Alodia to sell silk and textiles, receiving beads, elephant teeth and leather in return. At Soba silk and flax have been found, both probably originating from Egypt. Most of the glass found there was also imported. Benjamin of Tudela claimed merchants traveling from Alodia to Zuwila carried hides, wheat, fruits, legumes and salt, while carrying gold and precious stones on their return. 
Slaves are commonly assumed to have been exported by medieval Nubia. Adams postulates that Alodia was a specialized slave-trading state that exploited the pagan populations to the west and south. Evidence for a regulated slave trade is very limited. It is only from the 16th century, after the fall of the Christian kingdoms, that such evidence begins to appear.

Ellen Cicely Wilkinson (8 October 1891 – 6 February 1947) was a British <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> politician who served as <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Education">Minister of Education</a> from July 1945 until her death. Earlier in her career, as the <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> (MP) for <a href="Jarrow%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Jarrow</a>, she became a national figure when she played a prominent role in the 1936 <a href="Jarrow%20March">Jarrow March</a> of the town's unemployed to London to petition for the right to work. Although unsuccessful at that time, the March provided an iconic image for the 1930s and helped to form post-Second World War attitudes to unemployment and social justice.

Wilkinson was born into a poor though ambitious <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> family and she embraced <a href="socialism">socialism</a> at an early age. After graduating from the <a href="Victoria%20University%20of%20Manchester">University of Manchester</a>, she worked for a <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">women's suffrage</a> organisation and later as a trade union officer. Inspired by the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> of 1917, Wilkinson joined the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">British Communist Party</a>, and preached <a href="revolutionary%20socialism">revolutionary socialism</a> while seeking constitutional routes to political power through the Labour Party. She was elected Labour MP for <a href="Middlesbrough%20East%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Middlesbrough East</a> in 1924, and supported the <a href="1926%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20strike">1926 General Strike</a>. In the 1929–31 Labour government, she served as <a href="Parliamentary%20Private%20Secretary">Parliamentary Private Secretary</a> to the junior <a href="Department%20of%20Health%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Health Minister</a>. Following her defeat at Middlesbrough in 1931, Wilkinson became a prolific journalist and writer, before returning to parliament as Jarrow's MP in 1935. She was a strong advocate for the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Republican government</a> in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, and made several visits to the battle zones.

During the Second World War, Wilkinson served in <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Churchill</a>'s <a href="Churchill%20war%20ministry">wartime coalition</a> as a <a href="Parliamentary%20Secretary">junior minister</a>, mainly at the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Home%20Security">Ministry of Home Security</a> where she worked under <a href="Herbert%20Morrison">Herbert Morrison</a>. She supported Morrison's attempts to replace <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a> as the Labour Party's leader; nevertheless, when he formed his postwar government, Attlee appointed Wilkinson as <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Education">Minister of Education</a>. By this time, her health was poor, a legacy of years of overwork. She saw her main task in office as the implementation of the wartime coalition's <a href="Education%20Act%201944">1944 Education Act</a>, rather than the more radical introduction of <a href="Comprehensive%20school%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">comprehensive schools</a> favoured by many in the Labour Party. Much of her energy was applied to organising the raising of the school-leaving age from 14 to 15. During the exceptionally cold weather of <a href="Winter%20of%201946%E2%80%9347%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">early 1947</a>, she succumbed to a bronchial disease, and died after an overdose of medication, which the coroner at her inquest declared was accidental.

Ellen Wilkinson was born on 8 October 1891, at 41 Coral Street in the Manchester district of <a href="Chorlton-on-Medlock">Chorlton-on-Medlock</a>. She was the third child and second daughter of Richard Wilkinson, a cotton worker who became an insurance agent, and his wife, Ellen, née Wood. Richard Wilkinson was a pillar of his local <a href="Methodism">Wesleyan Methodist</a> church, and combined a strong sense of social justice with forthright views on self-help; rather than espousing working-class solidarity his view, according to Ellen, was: "I have pulled myself out of the gutter, why can't they?" Entirely self-educated, he ensured that his children received the best schooling available, encouraged them to read widely, and inculcated strong Christian principles.

At the age of six Ellen began attending what she described as "a filthy elementary school with the five classes in one room". A series of childhood illnesses kept her at home for two years, but she used the time learning to read. On her return to school she made rapid progress, and at the age of 11 won a scholarship to Ardwick Higher Elementary Grade School. Outspoken and often rebellious, after two years she transferred to Stretford Road Secondary School for Girls, an experience she later remembered as "horrid and unmanageable". She made up for the school's shortcomings by reading, with her father's encouragement, the works of <a href="Ernst%20Haeckel">Haeckel</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Henry%20Huxley">Thomas Huxley</a> and <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Darwin</a>.

Teaching was one of the few careers then open to educated working-class girls, and in 1906 Ellen won a bursary of £25 that enabled her to begin her training. For half the week she attended the Manchester Day Training College, and during the other half taught at Oswald Road Elementary School. Her classroom approach—she sought to interest her pupils, rather than impose learning by rote—led to frequent clashes with her superiors, and convinced her that her future did not lie in teaching. At the college, where she was encouraged to read more widely and to engage with the issues of the day, she discovered socialism through the works of <a href="Robert%20Blatchford">Robert Blatchford</a>. By this time she was impatient with religion; socialism provided a timely and attractive substitute. At 16 she joined the Longsight branch of the <a href="Independent%20Labour%20Party">Independent Labour Party</a> (ILP), and at one of her first branch meetings encountered <a href="Katherine%20Glasier">Katherine Bruce Glasier</a>, whose crusading brand of socialism made a deep impact. Thirty years later Wilkinson told her colleague <a href="George%20Middleton%20%28British%20politician%29">George Middleton</a> that Glasier had "brought me into the Socialist movement ... It always makes me humble to think of her indomitable courage". After meeting the suffragist <a href="Hannah%20Mitchell">Hannah Mitchell</a>, Wilkinson took up the cause of <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">women's suffrage</a>, the major women's rights issue of the day. Although initially engaged in everyday tasks such as distributing leaflets and putting up posters, she made a considerable impression on Mitchell, who later remembered her as "brilliant and gifted".

Determined to carve a career for herself outside teaching, in 1910 Wilkinson sat for and won the Jones Open History Scholarship, which gave her a place at <a href="Victoria%20University%20of%20Manchester">Manchester University</a>. There, she found many opportunities to extend her political activities. She joined the university's branch of the <a href="Fabian%20Society">Fabian Society</a>, and eventually became its joint secretary. She continued her suffragist work by joining the Manchester Society for Women's Suffrage, where she impressed <a href="Margaret%20Ashton">Margaret Ashton</a>, the first woman member of Manchester City Council, by her efforts in the North Manchester and Gorton constituencies. Through these and other campaigning activities Wilkinson met many of the contemporary leaders of the radical left—the veteran campaigner <a href="Charlotte%20Despard">Charlotte Despard</a>, the ILP leader <a href="William%20Crawford%20Anderson">William Crawford Anderson</a>, and <a href="Beatrice%20Webb">Beatrice</a> and <a href="Sidney%20Webb">Sidney Webb</a> among others. She also came under the influence of <a href="Walton%20Newbold">Walton Newbold</a>, an older student who later became the United Kingdom's first Communist MP. The two were briefly engaged, and although this was soon broken off, they remained close political associates for many years.

In her final year at university Wilkinson was co-opted to the executive committee of the University Socialist Federation (USF), an inter-institutional organisation formed to bring together socialist-minded students from all over the country. This brought her new contacts, who would typically meet at Fabian summer schools to hear lectures by ILP leaders such as <a href="Ramsay%20MacDonald">Ramsay MacDonald</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Henderson">Arthur Henderson</a>, and trade union activists such as <a href="Ben%20Tillett">Ben Tillett</a> and <a href="Margaret%20Bondfield">Margaret Bondfield</a>. Amid these distractions she continued to study hard, and won several prizes. In the summer of 1913 she sat her finals and was awarded her BA degree—not the <a href="British%20undergraduate%20degree%20classification">First Class</a> honours that her tutors had predicted, but an Upper Second. Wilkinson rationalised thus: "I deliberately sacrificed my First ... to devote my spare time to a strike raging in Manchester".

On leaving university in June 1913, Wilkinson became a paid worker for the <a href="National%20Union%20of%20Women%27s%20Suffrage%20Societies">National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies</a> (NUWSS). She helped to organise the Suffrage Pilgrimage of July 1913, when more than 50,000 women marched from all over the country to a mass rally in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park, London</a>. She began to develop a fuller understanding of the mechanics of politics and campaigning, and became an accomplished speaker, able to hold her own even in the most hostile public meetings.

When the First World War began in August 1914, Wilkinson, like many in the Labour movement, condemned it as an imperialist exercise that would result in the deaths of millions of workers. Nevertheless, she took the role of honorary secretary of the Manchester branch of the <a href="Women%27s%20Emergency%20Corps">Women's Emergency Corps</a> (WEC), a body which found suitable war work for women volunteers. With the advent of war the NUWSS became divided between pro-war and pro-peace factions. They ultimately separated, the peacemongers (including Wilkinson's Manchester branch) eventually aligning themselves with the <a href="Women%27s%20International%20League%20for%20Peace%20and%20Freedom">Women's International League for Peace and Freedom</a> (WIL). With little suffrage activity to organise, Wilkinson looked for another job, and in July 1915 was appointed as a national organiser for the <a href="Amalgamated%20Union%20of%20Co-operative%20Employees">Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees</a> (AUCE), with particular responsibility for the recruitment of women into the union. In this post she fought for equal pay for equal work, and for the rights of unskilled and lower-paid workers when these interests conflicted with those of the higher-paid craft unions. She organized a series of strikes to attain these goals with notable successes in Carlisle, Coatbridge, Glasgow and Grangemouth. 
She was less successful in managing a lengthy dispute at the Longsight print works in Manchester, in the summer of 1918, where opponents described her tactics as "unreasonable guerrilla warfare". As a result of her actions Wilkinson briefly lost her job at the union, only to be swiftly reinstated after protests by members and after apologising for her role in the strike. From 1918 she served as her union's nominee on several Trade Boards—national consultative bodies which attempted to set minimum wage rates for low-paid workers. In 1921 AUCE amalgamated with the National Union of Warehouse and General Workers to form the <a href="National%20Union%20of%20Distributive%20and%20Allied%20Workers">National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers</a> (NUDAW).

Wilkinson's work for the union brought new alliances, and useful new friendships—including one with <a href="John%20Jagger">John Jagger</a>, the union's future president. She remained an active Fabian, and after the Fabian Research Department became the Labour Research Department in 1917, served on the new body's executive committee. Through these connections she became a member of the <a href="Guild%20socialism">National Guilds League</a> (NGL), an organisation that promoted industrial democracy, workers' control and producer associations in a national system of guilds. She maintained her connection with the WIL, whose 1919 conference adopted a non-pacifist stance that justified armed struggle as a means of defeating capitalism. After visiting Ireland for the WIL in 1920 she became an outspoken critic of the British government's actions there, in particular its use of the "<a href="Black%20and%20Tans">Black and Tans</a>" as a paramilitary force. She gave evidence about the conduct of British forces in Ireland at the Congressional Committee of Investigation in Washington in December of that year. She called for an immediate truce and the release of republican prisoners.

Along with many others in the Labour movement, Wilkinson's attitudes were radicalised by the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> of 1917. She saw communism as the shape of the future, and when the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">Communist Party of Great Britain</a> (CPGB) was formed in the summer of 1920, Wilkinson was one of a group of ILP members with <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a> leanings who became founder members. For the next few years the CPGB was the main focus of her political activity, although she kept her membership in the Labour Party, which at the time accepted dual CPGB/Labour memberships.

In 1921 Wilkinson attended the Red International of Labour Unions Congress and the Second Congress of Communist Women in Moscow, where she met several Russian communist leaders, including the Defence Minister <a href="Leon%20Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>, and <a href="Nadezhda%20Krupskaya">Nadezhda Krupskaya</a>, the educationist who was <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Lenin</a>'s wife; Wilkinson considered Krupskaya's speech the best at the Congress. The main outcome of the gathering was the foundation of the <a href="Profintern">Red International of Labour Unions</a>, often known as the "Profintern". The aim of this organisation was to seek revolutionary change through industrial action, leading to the overthrow of world capitalism. At home, although she failed to persuade her union, NUDAW, to affiliate to the Profintern, Wilkinson continued to promote Russian achievements, especially its emancipation of women workers. In November 1922, at a meeting celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Russian Revolution, Wilkinson said that the Russian people could look forward with hope, and asked whether the same could be said of the people condemned to live their lives in the slums of Manchester. However, Wilkinson found herself increasingly at odds with communists in Manchester, over the party's industrial and wider international strategies.

Wilkinson was an early and lifetime supporter of the <a href="National%20Council%20of%20Labour%20Colleges">National Council of Labour Colleges</a>, established in 1921 with NUDAW backing with the aim of educating working-class students in working-class principles. She became a NUDAW-sponsored parliamentary candidate, and in 1923, while still a CPGB member, sought nomination as the Labour Party's parliamentary candidate for the <a href="Manchester%20Gorton%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Gorton</a> constituency. She was unsuccessful, but in November 1923 the Gorton ward elected her to <a href="Manchester%20City%20Council">Manchester City Council</a>; Hannah Mitchell, her co-worker in prewar suffrage campaigns, was a fellow councillor. In her short council career—she served only until 1926—Wilkinson's main areas of concern were unemployment, housing, child welfare and education.

When the prime minister, <a href="Stanley%20Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a>, called a <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201923">general election</a> for December 1923, Wilkinson was adopted as Labour's parliamentary candidate for <a href="Ashton-under-Lyne%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Ashton-under-Lyne</a>. She made no secret of her Communist affiliations, stating that "we shall have only one class in this country, the working class". In a three-way contest she came third, behind the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> and the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> candidate. The general election resulted in a <a href="hung%20parliament">hung parliament</a>, and a <a href="First%20MacDonald%20ministry">minority Labour government</a> under Ramsay MacDonald took office. During its short term in power, the Labour Party proscribed the Communist Party and outlawed dual membership. Faced with a choice, Wilkinson left the CPGB, citing the party's "exclusive and dictatorial methods which make impossible the formation of a real left wing among the progressives of the Trade Unions and the Labour Party". After this, she was selected as Labour's candidate for the constituency of <a href="Middlesbrough%20East%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Middlesbrough East</a>.

On 8 October 1924 MacDonald's Labour government resigned, after losing a confidence vote in the House of Commons. The latter stages of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201924">ensuing general election</a> were dominated by the controversy surrounding the <a href="Zinoviev%20letter">Zinoviev letter</a>, which generated a "Red Scare" shortly before polling day and contributed to a massive Conservative victory. Labour's representation in the House of Commons fell to 152, against the Conservatives' 415; Wilkinson was the only woman elected in the Labour ranks, winning Middlesbrough East with a majority of 927 over her Conservative opponent.

Wilkinson's arrival in the House of Commons attracted considerable press comment, much of it related to her bright red hair and the vivid colours of her clothing. She informed MPs: "I happen to represent in this House one of the heaviest iron and steel producing areas in the world—I know I do not look like it, but I do". The "Woman's Leader" described her as a "vigorous, uncompromising feminist and an exceedingly tenacious, forcible and hard-headed politician". As an unofficial spokesperson for women's rights, Wilkinson achieved one of her first parliamentary victories in 1925, when she persuaded the government to correct anomalies affecting widows in its Pensions Bill. She combined with <a href="Nancy%20Astor%2C%20Viscountess%20Astor">Lady Astor</a> from the Conservative benches, in March 1926, to attack the government's proposed decrease in expenditure on women's training centres. Wilkinson's <a href="ODNB">ODNB</a> biographer, Brian Harrison, acknowledges that while "women's issues" were often to the fore in her speeches, she was primarily a socialist rather than a feminist, and if forced to decide between them would have chosen the former.

During the nine days' duration of the May 1926 <a href="1926%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20strike">General Strike</a>, Wilkinson toured the country to press the strikers' case at meetings and rallies. She was devastated when the <a href="Trades%20Union%20Congress">Trades Union Congress</a> called off the strike. Early in June she joined <a href="George%20Lansbury">George Lansbury</a> and other leading Labour and union figures on the platform at an <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Albert Hall</a> rally which raised around £1,200 for the benefit of the miners, who continued on strike despite the TUC decision. Wilkinson's reflections on the strike were recorded in "A Workers' History of the Great Strike" (1927), which she co-authored with <a href="Raymond%20Postgate">Raymond Postgate</a> and <a href="Frank%20Horrabin">Frank Horrabin</a>, and in a semi-autobiographical novel, "<a href="Clash%20%28novel%29">Clash</a>", which she published in 1929. She also visited the United States in August 1926 to raise financial support for the miners, provoking criticism from the Conservative prime minister Baldwin who denied that the lockout was causing hardship.

Throughout her career Wilkinson was an opponent of imperialism. In February 1927 she attended the Founding Congress of the <a href="League%20Against%20Imperialism">League Against Imperialism</a> in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, where she met and befriended the Indian nationalist leader <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>. In 1927 she was elected to the Labour Party's National Executive, which gave her a voice in the formulation of party policy. Her advance was noted with approval by Beatrice Webb, who saw in her a future candidate for high office—ahead of more senior Labour women such as Margaret Bondfield and <a href="Susan%20Lawrence">Susan Lawrence</a>. A tireless campaigner for women's equality, she challenged the caricature of voteless younger women as 'flappers'. On 29 March 1928 Wilkinson voted in the House of Commons for the bill that became the <a href="Representation%20of%20the%20People%20%28Equal%20Franchise%29%20Act%201928">Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928</a>, granting the vote to all women aged 21 or over. During the debate she said: "[W]e are doing at last a great act of justice to the women of the country ... just as we have [previously] opened the door to the older women, tonight we are opening it to those who are just entering on the threshold of life and in whose hands is the new life of the future country that we are going to build".

In May 1929 Baldwin called a <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201929">general election</a>. As a member of Labour's National Executive, Wilkinson helped to draft her party's manifesto, although her preference for a list of specific policy proposals was overruled in favour of a lengthy statement of ideals and objectives. In Middlesbrough she was re-elected with an increased majority over her Conservative and Liberal opponents. Overall, Labour emerged from the election as the largest party, with 288 members (nine of whom were women), while the Conservatives and Liberals won 260 and 59 respectively. MacDonald formed his <a href="Second%20MacDonald%20ministry">second minority administration</a>, and included two women in ministerial posts: Margaret Bondfield as <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Employment">Minister of Labour</a> and <a href="Susan%20Lawrence">Susan Lawrence</a> as <a href="Parliamentary%20Secretary">Parliamentary Secretary</a> (junior minister) at the <a href="Department%20of%20Health%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Health</a>. Wilkinson was not given office, but was made Lawrence's <a href="Parliamentary%20Private%20Secretary">Parliamentary Private Secretary</a> (PPS), an indication that she was marked down for future promotion.

Almost from its inception the second MacDonald administration was overwhelmed by the twin crises of rising unemployment and the world trade recession that followed the financial crash in the latter part of 1929. The Labour Party was divided; the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor</a>, <a href="Philip%20Snowden%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Snowden">Philip Snowden</a>, favoured a strict curb on public expenditure, while others, including Wilkinson, believed that the problem was not over-production, but under-consumption. The solution, she argued, lay in increasing, not squeezing, the spending power of the poorest in society. On the issue of unemployment, Wilkinson supported <a href="Oswald%20Mosley">Oswald Mosley</a>'s "Memorandum", a plan for <a href="economic%20reconstruction">economic reconstruction</a> and public works that was rejected by the government on the grounds of cost; Mosley resigned from the government in protest.

With Wilkinson's assistance, the <a href="Mental%20Treatment%20Act%201930">Mental Treatment Act 1930</a> received the <a href="Royal%20Assent">Royal Assent</a> on 30 June 1930. In the same year she co-sponsored a bill to limit shopworkers' hours to 48 a week, and poured scorn on Conservatives opposing the measure who seemed, she said, to think that all shop work was carried out in the "soothing atmosphere" and "exquisite scents" of <a href="Jermyn%20Street">Jermyn Street</a> and <a href="Bond%20Street">Bond Street</a>. The bill was referred to a parliamentary committee, but got no further. As the parliament progressed, it became increasingly difficult to promote social legislation in the face of the mounting financial crisis and the use by the Conservative-dominated <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> of its statutory delaying powers.

The divisions in the Labour Party became more acute during 1931, as the government struggled to meet the <a href="May%20Report">May Report</a>'s recommended expenditure cuts of £97 million, the majority (£67 million) to be found from reductions in unemployment costs. On 23 August 1931 the government collapsed. To implement the required cuts, MacDonald and a small number of Labour MPs formed a <a href="National%20Government%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Government</a> with the Conservatives and Liberals, while the bulk of the Labour Party, including Wilkinson, went into opposition. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201931">general election</a> that followed in October the Labour Party was utterly routed, retaining only 52 of its parliamentary seats. In Middlesbrough East Wilkinson's vote was nearly the same as her 1929 total, but against a single candidate representing the National Government she was defeated by over 6,000 votes.

Wilkinson rationalised Labour's defeat in a "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" article, arguing that the party had lost because it was "not socialist enough", a theme she built on in numerous radical newspaper and journal articles. In a less serious vein she published "Peep at Politicians", a collection of humorous pen-portraits of parliamentary colleagues and opponents. She wrote that <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> was "cheerfully indifferent as to whether any new [ideas] he acquires match the collection he already possesses", and described <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a> as "too fastidious for intrigue, and too modest for over-ambition". Her second novel, "The Division Bell Mystery", set in the House of Commons, was published in 1932; Paula Bartley, Wilkinson's biographer, acknowledges that Wilkinson was not a first-class novelist, but "the autobiographical topicality of [her] books made them very appealing".

In 1932 Wilkinson was invited by the India League to join a small delegation, to report on conditions in India. During the three-month visit she met <a href="Mahatma%20Gandhi">Gandhi</a>, then in prison, and became convinced that his co-operation was essential to any prospect of peace in the subcontinent. On her return home she delivered her conclusions in an uncompromising report, "The Condition of India", published in 1934. She visited Germany shortly after <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler</a> came to power in 1933, and published a pamphlet, "The Terror in Germany", that documented early incidents of <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> outrage. She collaborated with a refugee from Hitler's Germany, <a href="Edward%20Conze">Edward Conze</a>, to produce a major book, "Why Fascism?", which condemned the Labour Party's gradualism and focus upon parliament as well as the failure of communist strategy, arguing for the need for grassroots workers' unity and revolution to check the threat of fascism across Europe. Meanwhile, her parliamentary prospects had been revived by her selection as Labour candidate for <a href="Jarrow%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Jarrow</a>, a <a href="Tyneside">Tyneside</a> shipbuilding town. Jarrow had been devastated early in the 1930s by the run-down and closure of <a href="Palmers%20Shipbuilding%20and%20Iron%20Company">Palmers</a> shipyard, the town's main source of employment. Early in 1934 Wilkinson led a deputation of Jarrow's unemployed to meet the prime minister, MacDonald, in his nearby <a href="Seaham%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Seaham</a> constituency, and received sympathy but no positive action. She was unimpressed by the government's <a href="Special%20Areas%20Act%201934">Special Areas Act</a>, passed late in 1934 and designed to assist distressed areas such as Jarrow; she thought the legislation provided inadequate funding, and benefited employers more than workers.

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201935">November 1935 general election</a> the National Government, led by Baldwin since MacDonald's retirement earlier that year, won convincingly, although Labour increased its House of Commons representation to 158. Wilkinson was returned at Jarrow with a majority of 2,350. Although the poverty in the town was acute, there were hopes that its chronic unemployment would shortly be alleviated by the erection of a large steelworks on the derelict shipyard site. However, the scheme was opposed by the steelmasters represented by the <a href="British%20Iron%20and%20Steel%20Federation">British Iron and Steel Federation</a> (BISF), who thought that any increase in steel production should be handled by expanding their existing facilities. On 30 June 1936 Wilkinson asked <a href="Walter%20Runciman%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Runciman%20of%20Doxford">Walter Runciman</a>, the responsible minister, "to induce the Iron and Steel Federation to pursue a less selfish policy than it is pursuing at present". Her request was ignored, and the matter delayed indefinitely by the appointment of a committee to consider the general development of the iron and steel industry—a committee, a "<a href="The%20Times">Times</a>" letter-writer noted, dominated by BISF members. A deputation from Jarrow's town council met Runciman to protest against the decision, but were told that "Jarrow must find its own salvation."

According to Wilkinson, Runciman's dismissive phrase "kindled the town". Under the general leadership of its chairman, David Riley, the town council began preparations for a demonstration in the form of a march to London to present a petition to the government. Marches of the unemployed, generally termed "hunger marches", had been taking place since the early 1920s, often under the auspices of the communist-led <a href="National%20Unemployed%20Workers%27%20Movement">National Unemployed Workers' Movement</a>. This political dimension had associated such marches in the public mind with far-left propaganda. The Jarrow council determined to organise its march free of political connotations, and with the backing of every section of the town. This did not prevent <a href="Hensley%20Henson">Hensley Henson</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>, from denouncing it as "revolutionary mob pressure" and condemning the action of <a href="James%20Gordon%20%28bishop%20of%20Jarrow%29">James Gordon</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Jarrow">Bishop of Jarrow</a>, who gave the march his blessing. Even within the Labour Party, Wilkinson found the leadership's attitude lukewarm, fearful of possible association with revolutionary socialism.

On 5 October 1936 a selected group of 200 set out from Jarrow Town Hall on the 282-mile march, aiming to reach London by 30 October for the start of the new session of parliament. Wilkinson did not march all the way, but joined whenever her various commitments allowed. At that year's Labour Party conference, held in Edinburgh, she hoped to rouse enthusiasm but instead heard herself condemned for "sending hungry and ill-clad men across the country". This negative attitude was mirrored by some of the local parties on the route of the march; in such areas, Wilkinson recorded with irony, the Conservatives and Liberals saw to the marchers' needs. On 31 October the marchers reached London, but Baldwin refused to see them. On 4 November, Wilkinson presented the town's petition to the House of Commons. Signed by 11,000 citizens of Jarrow, it concluded: "The town cannot be left derelict, and therefore your Petitioners humbly pray that His Majesty's Government and this honourable House should realise the urgent need that work should be provided for the town without further delay." In the brief discussion that followed, Runciman opined that "the unemployment position at Jarrow, while still far from satisfactory, has improved during recent months". In reply a Labour backbencher commented that "the Government's complacency is regarded throughout the country as an affront to the national conscience".

The marchers returned to Jarrow by train, to find their unemployment benefit reduced because they had been "unavailable for work" had any vacancies arisen. The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart suggest that the success of the Jarrow march lay in the future; it "helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s", and thus paved the way to social reform. According to Vernon, it planted the idea of social justice into the minds of the middle classes. "Ironically and tragically," Vernon says, "it was not peaceful crusading, but the impetus of rearmament which brought industrial activity back to Jarrow". In 1939 Wilkinson published an account of Jarrow's travails in her final book, "The Town that was Murdered". "Jarrow's plight", she wrote, "is not a local problem. It is the symptom of a national evil".

In November 1934, as a representative of the Relief Committee for the Victims of Fascism, Wilkinson visited the northern Spanish province of <a href="Asturias">Asturias</a> to report on the crushing of the <a href="Asturian%20miners%27%20strike%20of%201934">Oviedo miners' uprising</a>. She was forcibly ejected from the country. Despite being banned from Germany as an undesirable, Wilkinson continued to visit the country covertly, and as a correspondent for the "Sunday Referee" was the first to report Hitler's intention to <a href="Remilitarization%20of%20the%20Rhineland">march into the Rhineland</a>, in March 1936. Spain, however, came to occupy a special place in her opposition to the spread of fascism. When a section of the Spanish army under <a href="Francisco%20Franco">General Franco</a> attacked the elected <a href="Popular%20Front%20%28Spain%29">Popular Front</a> coalition government to precipitate the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, Wilkinson set up the Spanish Medical Aid Committee and the <a href="National%20Joint%20Committee%20for%20Spanish%20Relief">National Joint Committee for Spanish Relief</a>. She later argued in parliament against the British government's non-intervention policies which, she insisted, "worked on the side of General Franco". She returned to Spain in April 1937 as a member of an all-women delegation led by the <a href="Katharine%20Stewart-Murray%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Atholl">Duchess of Atholl</a>, and afterwards wrote of feeling "a helpless, choking rage", as she witnessed the effects of aerial bombing on undefended villages. On a further visit, in December 1937, she was accompanied by Attlee, now leader of the Labour Party, and <a href="Philip%20Noel-Baker">Philip Noel-Baker</a>, a fellow Labour MP. Having observed the near-starvation of schoolchildren in Madrid, on her return to Britain she set up a "Milk for Spain" fund, together with other humanitarian initiatives.

Although she had long broken her formal ties with the British Communist Party, Wilkinson retained strong links with other communist organisations at home and abroad. Her association with leading communists such as <a href="Willi%20M%C3%BCnzenberg">Willi Münzenberg</a> and <a href="Otto%20Katz">Otto Katz</a> is revealed in British intelligence files held on her. However, she was not prepared to risk losing her parliamentary seat, and thus kept her rebellious behaviour within bounds. In 1937 Wilkinson was one of a group of Labour figures—<a href="Aneurin%20Bevan">Aneurin Bevan</a>, <a href="Harold%20Laski">Harold Laski</a> and <a href="Stafford%20Cripps">Stafford Cripps</a> were others—who founded the left-wing magazine "<a href="Tribune%20%28magazine%29">Tribune</a>"; in the first issue she wrote of the need to fight unemployment, poverty, malnutrition and inadequate housing. Mindful of the dependence of many low-income families on credit, she introduced a bill to regulate <a href="Hire%20purchase">hire purchase agreements</a>, at the time a subject of frequent abuse, and with all-party support she secured the passage of the Hire Purchase Act 1938.

Wilkinson was a strong opponent of the National Government's <a href="appeasement">appeasement</a> policies towards the European dictators. In the House of Commons on 6 October 1938 she condemned the actions of the prime minister, <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a>, in signing the <a href="Munich%20Agreement">Munich Agreement</a>: "Only by throwing away practically everything for which this country cared and stood could he rescue us from the results of his own policy". On 24 August 1939, as parliament considered the recently signed <a href="Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop%20Pact">Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact</a>, Wilkinson attacked Chamberlain's failure to ally with Russia in a common front against Hitler. "Time after time", she told the Commons, "we have had the prime minister ... putting the narrow interests of his class and of the rich, before the national interest".

Wilkinson supported Britain's declaration of war on Germany, on 3 September 1939, although she was critical of Chamberlain's conduct of the war. In May 1940, when <a href="Churchill%20war%20ministry">Churchill's all-party coalition</a> replaced Chamberlain's National Government, Wilkinson was appointed Parliamentary Secretary at the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Pensions%20and%20National%20Insurance%23Ministry%20of%20Pensions">Ministry of Pensions</a>. In October 1940 she transferred to the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Home%20Security">Ministry of Home Security</a>, as one of <a href="Herbert%20Morrison">Herbert Morrison</a>'s three Parliamentary Secretaries, with responsibilities for air raid shelters and <a href="Civil%20defense">civil defence</a>. When aerial bombardment of British cities began in the summer of 1940, many Londoners used <a href="London%20Underground">Underground</a> stations as improvised shelters, often living there for days in conditions of increasing squalor. By the end of 1941 Wilkinson had supervised the distribution of more than half a million indoor <a href="Air-raid%20shelter%23Morrison%20shelter">"Morrison shelters"</a>—reinforced steel tables with wire mesh sides, under which a family could sleep at home. Dubbed the "shelter queen" by the press, Wilkinson toured the bombed cities frequently, to share hardships and raise morale. More controversially, she approved the conscription of women into the <a href="Auxiliary%20Fire%20Service">Auxiliary Fire Service</a> for fire-watching duty, a policy that provoked considerable opposition from women, who felt that their domestic duties were a sufficient burden. Even Wilkinson's own union, NUDAW, disapproved of the measure, but Wilkinson stood firm.

The discipline of working in a ministerial post, together with the influence of Morrison and her alienation from communism, turned Wilkinson away from many of her former left-wing stances. She supported Morrison's decision in January 1941 to suppress the communist newspaper "<a href="Morning%20Star%20%28British%20newspaper%29">The Daily Worker</a>" on the grounds of its anti-British propaganda, and voted for the wartime legislation that banned strikes in key industries. Now accepted within the mainstream of the Labour Party, she served on several key policy committees, and in June 1943 became vice-chairman of the party's National Executive. She succeeded to the chair when the incumbent, <a href="George%20Ridley%20%28Labour%20politician%29">George Ridley</a>, died in January 1944. In the <a href="1945%20New%20Year%20Honours">1945 New Year Honours</a> she was appointed a <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Counsellor</a>, only the third woman (after <a href="Margaret%20Bondfield">Margaret Bondfield</a> and <a href="Nancy%20Astor%2C%20Viscountess%20Astor">Lady Astor</a>) to receive this honour. In April 1945 she was part of a parliamentary delegation that travelled to San Francisco to begin work on the establishment of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>.

Wilkinson had formed a close relationship with Morrison, personally and politically, before and during their wartime ministerial association. She thought that he, rather than the sedate Attlee, should be leading the Labour Party, and had promoted his leadership credentials in 1935 and 1939. In 1945, Morrison informed Attlee that he intended to seek the leadership "in the interests of party unity". In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201945">general election held in July 1945</a> Labour won a landslide victory, with 393 seats against the Conservatives' 213. This did not prevent Wilkinson and others from continuing to press for a change of leader, but Attlee forestalled further action by quickly accepting <a href="George%20VI">the king's</a> invitation to form a government. He showed no resentment towards either Morrison or Wilkinson; the former was appointed <a href="Lord%20President%20of%20the%20Council">Lord President of the Council</a> and deputy prime minister, while Wilkinson was made <a href="Department%20for%20Education">Minister of Education</a>, with a seat in the cabinet. <a href="Emmanuel%20Shinwell">Emmanuel Shinwell</a>, who became <a href="Minister%20of%20Fuel%20and%20Power">Minister of Fuel and Power</a>, later commented that "it is not bad tactics to make one's enemies one's servants".

Wilkinson was the second woman, after Margaret Bondfield, to achieve a place in the British cabinet. As Minister of Education she saw as her main task the implementation of the <a href="Education%20Act%201944">1944 Education Act</a> passed by the wartime coalition. This Act provided universal free secondary education, and raised the minimum school leaving age from 14 to 15 with effect from 1947. All children would take an examination—the <a href="Eleven%20plus%20exam">"11-plus"</a>—which would determine whether their secondary education would be in a grammar (academic), technical or "modern" school. Many in the Labour Party saw this tripartite arrangement as perpetuating elitism, and wanted a more radical scheme based on what later became known as the "<a href="Comprehensive%20school">comprehensive</a>" system. This envisaged large schools under a single roof, each with a range of appropriate courses of study for different levels of ability, and flexible movement between courses as children's aptitudes changed. Wilkinson believed, however, that such a major reconstruction was unachievable at that time, and limited herself to more attainable reforms. Her cautious attitude disappointed and angered some of the Labour left wing and teacher' representatives, who considered that a great opportunity to incorporate socialist principles into education had been missed. Wilkinson, however, was persuaded to the view that selection at 11 would allow all those with higher IQs, irrespective of class background, to obtain a grammar school education.
Wilkinson made her first priority the raising of the school leaving age. This required the recruitment and training of thousands of extra teachers, and creating classroom space for almost 400,000 extra children. Under the Emergency Training Scheme (ETS), ex-servicemen and women were given grants to train as teachers on an accelerated one-year programme; more than 37,000 had been or were being trained by the end of 1946. The rapid expansion of school premises was achieved by the erection of temporary huts—some of which became long-term features of schools. Wilkinson was determined that the higher leaving age be implemented by 1 April 1947—the date set by the 1944 Act—and in the face of parliamentary scepticism insisted that her plans were on track. Final cabinet approval to honour the April date was given on 16 January 1947.

Other reforms during Wilkinson's tenure as minister included free school milk, improvements in the school meals service, an increase in university scholarships, and an expansion in the provision of part-time adult education through <a href="Community%20college%23United%20Kingdom%20%28excluding%20Scotland%29">county colleges</a>. In October 1945 she went to Germany to report on how the destroyed German education system could best be reactivated. She was astonished by the speed with which, five months after its defeat, the country's schools and universities were reopening. Other trips included visits to Gibraltar, Malta and Czechoslovakia. In November 1945 she chaired an international conference in London that led to the establishment, a year later, of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Educational%2C%20Scientific%20and%20Cultural%20Organisation">United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation</a> (UNESCO). In one of her final speeches in parliament, on 22 November 1946, she emphasised that UNESCO stood for "standards of value ... putting aside the idea that only practical things matter". She prophesied that the organisation "will do great things", and urged the government to give it its full backing.

Wilkinson suffered for most of her life from <a href="bronchial%20asthma">bronchial asthma</a>, which she aggravated over the years by heavy smoking and overwork. She had often been ill during the war, and had collapsed during a visit to <a href="Prague">Prague</a> in 1946. On 25 January 1947 she attended the opening of the <a href="Bristol%20Old%20Vic%20Theatre%20School">Bristol Old Vic Theatre School</a>. The winter of 1946–47 was exceptionally cold, and the ceremony was held out of doors. Shortly afterwards, Wilkinson developed pneumonia; on 3 February she was found in her London flat in a coma, and on 6 February 1947 she died in <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Hospital%2C%20London">St Mary's Hospital, Paddington</a>. At the inquest the coroner gave the cause of death as "heart failure following <a href="emphysema">emphysema</a>, with acute <a href="bronchitis">bronchitis</a> and <a href="bronchial%20pneumonia">bronchial pneumonia</a>, accelerated by barbiturate poisoning". Wilkinson had been taking a combination of drugs for several months, to combat both her asthma and insomnia; the coroner believed she had inadvertently taken an overdose of barbiturates. With no evidence to indicate that the overdose was deliberate, he recorded a verdict of accidental death. Despite this, speculation that Wilkinson had committed suicide has persisted, the reasons cited being the failure of her personal relationship with Herbert Morrison and her likely fate in a rumoured cabinet reshuffle. In their 1973 biography of Morrison, Bernard Donoughue and G. W. Jones suggest that, given Wilkinson's poor health, the burdens of her ministerial office became too much for her. However, the lack of conclusive evidence divides historians about Wilkinson's intention to take her own life.

Wilkinson's short stature and distinctive red hair, combined with her uncompromising politics, gave rise to popular nicknames such as the "Fiery Particle" and "Red Ellen". With her bright, fashionable clothes and her forceful manner, she was easily noticeable—an obituarist wrote that "wherever there was a row going on in support of some good or even fairly good cause, that rebellious redhead was sure to be seen bobbing about in the heart of the tumult". In her later career, ambition and pragmatism led her to temper her earlier Marxism and militancy and work within mainstream Labour Party policy; she came to believe that parliamentary democracy offered a better route to social progress than any alternative. Yet, Vernon says, "she never lost her resolute independence of thought, and sought power not for self glory but to succour the weak of the world".
In a tribute published when Wilkinson's death was announced, the former Conservative MP <a href="Thelma%20Cazalet-Keir">Thelma Cazalet-Keir</a> summed up her personality: "Ellen Wilkinson was as far removed from being a bore as it is possible for any human being to be. Whatever she did, wherever she went, she created an atmosphere of excitement and interest ... and not just because of her red hair and green dress".

In the course of her career Wilkinson contributed to reforms in numerous policy areas: women's equal suffrage, women civil servants' equal pay, provision of air raid shelters for city dwellers, and protection of hire purchase borrowers' rights. The historian <a href="David%20Kynaston">David Kynaston</a> cites as her greatest practical achievement her success in meeting the timetable for the raising of the school leaving age; her successor as education minister, <a href="George%20Tomlinson">George Tomlinson</a>, recorded how hard she had fought to avoid postponement of the reform, and expressed his sorrow that she died before the set date. Wilkinson was sometimes criticised for extending her efforts too widely; a local newspaper, the "North Mail", complained in May 1937 that "Miss Wilkinson is working for too many causes to do justice to Jarrow". Nevertheless, her book "The Town that was Murdered" brought to public notice the plight of Jarrow and the broader consequences of unbridled capitalism on working-class communities; the book, Harrison observes, "educated the nation".

Wilkinson never married, although she enjoyed numerous close friendships with men. Apart from her early engagement to Walton Newbold, she was close to John Jagger for many years, and in the early 1930s enjoyed a brief romantic attachment with Frank Horrabin. Her long association with Morrison began in her early Fabian days; Morrison was very reticent about this friendship, choosing not to mention Wilkinson in his 1960 autobiography despite their close political association. Vernon says that the relationship almost certainly became "more than platonic", but as Wilkinson's private papers were destroyed after her death, and Morrison maintained silence over the matter, the full nature and extent of their friendship remains unknown.
On 25 January 1941 Wilkinson received the freedom of the town of Jarrow, and in May 1946 was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Manchester. Her name has been commemorated in <a href="The%20Ellen%20Wilkinson%20School%20for%20Girls">The Ellen Wilkinson School for Girls</a> in <a href="Ealing">Ealing</a>, West London, in the Ellen Wilkinson Primary School and Children's Centre in <a href="Newham">Newham</a>, East London, and in the Ellen Wilkinson Estate, a 1950s Felling Urban District Council housing project at Wardley, once part of her Jarrow constituency now in Gateshead Metropolitan Borough. In addition, the <a href="Ellen%20Wilkinson%20High%20School">Ellen Wilkinson High School</a> in Ardwick, which incorporated Wilkinson's old school, bore her name for some years before its closure in 2000. The Ellen Wilkinson Building in the University of Manchester's campus houses parts of the <a href="https%3A//www.seed.manchester.ac.uk/education/">Manchester Institute of Education</a> and other departments. A blue plaque records the site of Wilkinson's birthplace at 41 Coral Street, and another, in the main quadrangle of the old university buildings, records Wilkinson's attendance there in 1910 to 1913. In October 2015 Wilkinson was shortlisted by a Manchester town hall panel as one of six candidates to be the subject of the city's first female statue in over a century. In October 2016 Wilkinson was chosen in a public vote to become the first female statue in <a href="Middlesbrough">Middlesbrough</a>. Her name and image and those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters are etched on the <a href="plinth">plinth</a> of the <a href="statue%20of%20Millicent%20Fawcett">statue of Millicent Fawcett</a> in <a href="Parliament%20Square">Parliament Square</a>, London that was unveiled in April 2018.

Silent Alarm

Silent Alarm is the debut studio album by British <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a> band <a href="Bloc%20Party">Bloc Party</a>. Recorded in Copenhagen and London in mid-2004 with <a href="Record%20producer">producer</a> <a href="Paul%20Epworth">Paul Epworth</a>, it was released in February 2005 on <a href="Wichita%20Recordings">Wichita Recordings</a>. The record peaked at number three on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">United Kingdom Albums Chart</a>. In the United States, it entered the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> at number 114 and the <a href="Independent%20Albums">"Billboard" Top Independent Albums</a> at number seven. The <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">double A-side</a> "<a href="So%20Here%20We%20Are/Positive%20Tension">So Here We Are/Positive Tension</a>", "<a href="Banquet%20%28song%29">Banquet</a>", and "<a href="Pioneers%20%28song%29">Pioneers</a>" were released as <a href="Single%20%28music%29">singles</a>. "Silent Alarm" went on to achieve worldwide sales of over one million copies.

Bloc Party aimed to create an album that appealed to followers of different musical genres. Building on the arrangements in their <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demo</a> songs recorded in 2004, the band members moulded tracks largely through live takes during the "Silent Alarm" studio sessions. The compositional focus was on rhythm and the drum and bass parts, while lyricist <a href="Kele%20Okereke">Kele Okereke</a>'s writing examined the feelings and hopes of young adults, including views on global politics. Following the album's completion, Bloc Party embarked on promotional tours before its release.

"Silent Alarm" garnered widespread critical acclaim with praise often centered on its fast <a href="tempo">tempo</a> and passionate delivery. Later in 2005, it was <a href="remix">remix</a>ed as "<a href="Silent%20Alarm%20Remixed">Silent Alarm Remixed</a>" and was re-released with bonus tracks to coincide with Bloc Party's worldwide touring schedule. The album has received accolades throughout the music industry since its release.

In 2003, Bloc Party consisted of guitarists Kele Okereke and <a href="Russell%20Lissack">Russell Lissack</a>, and bassist <a href="Gordon%20Moakes">Gordon Moakes</a>. After drummer Matt Tong auditioned and joined the trio, the band members' songwriting evolved and they started crafting tracks for "Silent Alarm". Discussing the first demo "<a href="She%27s%20Hearing%20Voices">She's Hearing Voices</a>", Okereke has stated that it "was really just a drum beat, which was something we couldn't do before because we relied on writing songs only with guitars". Self-recorded in a small, hired space in <a href="Acton%2C%20London">Acton, London</a>, the song was followed by the May 2004 double A-side single, "<a href="Banquet/Staying%20Fat">Banquet/Staying Fat</a>", produced by Paul Epworth. "<a href="Bloc%20Party%20%28EP%29">Bloc Party EP</a>" was subsequently released by <a href="Moshi%20Moshi%20Records">Moshi Moshi Records</a> in the UK, containing all three previous songs and new material.

Following exposure with British magazines and newspapers and a successful performance on <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a>, Bloc Party received a contract offer from <a href="Parlophone">Parlophone</a>. The band members declined the opportunity because they did not want to work for a major record label and instead signed a recording contract with East London <a href="Independent%20record%20label">indie label</a> Wichita Recordings, chosen because it did not want to stamp its agenda on the conception of records. Frontman and chief writer Okereke wanted "Silent Alarm" to emphasise the importance of finding pleasure in small mundane things, because "those are the sort of things that can be incredibly touching". The album was born out of "a nagging youthful urgency" and the realisation that responsibility has to be taken for the first time as a young adult. Before recording started, Okereke attended singing lessons to open up his voice.

In June 2004, Bloc Party convened at Deltalab Studios in Copenhagen to make "Silent Alarm" with Paul Epworth. The band had already written demo songs to record, but Okereke has noted that "it is a creative process and you have to let yourself be inspired while you're in the studio as well". The Deltalab set-up posed problems, because it included bare <a href="Power%20cord">mains cable</a>s and dated, malfunctioning equipment from the 1960s and 1970s. Bloc Party took three sessions to get acquainted with Epworth's methodology. The producer has called the recording time a "growing process" because Okereke was not wholly comfortable singing in front of people, especially after <a href="tonsil">tonsil</a> problems. Although the band members had preliminary ideas about a track's rhythm, they did not know how songs were going to start or end. Okereke often asked Tong to play something on the drums, which inspired him to mould a track by adding guitar <a href="Chord%20%28music%29">chords</a> to the beat.
Bloc Party's priority when recording "Silent Alarm" was "to give the music more depth, sonically speaking" rather than focus on making a <a href="Dance-punk">punk funk</a> record. The band believed that 21st-century rock music could only survive if people started "mixing styles that aren't supposed to be together". Okereke has suggested that forward-thinking bands reach a plateau and start to question the boundaries of their medium; this leads to experimentation with elements from other genres. Bloc Party set out to explore the idea of merging different styles in the debut album, rather than in later work. "Silent Alarm" was crafted to appeal to <a href="Rhythm%20and%20blues">R&B</a>, <a href="Electro%20%28music%29">electro</a>, and <a href="Pop%20music">pop</a> fans, on top of the band's core indie rock fanbase. Okereke wanted the album to sound "very rich and full".

Preferring live recording takes for better sound authenticity, Epworth's style separated the band's elements by accentuating the <a href="bass%20%28sound%29">bass</a> and by allowing the guitarists space to improvise. The producer meticulously tuned and retuned the components of the <a href="drum%20kit">drum kit</a> for a specific sound and used <a href="ribbon%20microphone">ribbon</a> or <a href="Microphone">condenser microphones</a> lined up in an equidistant formation. According to Lissack, the basic idea was to emulate the "optimum audio representation" of songs heard in a club environment by adding guitar lines on top of boosted drum and bass tracks. Epworth advised Bloc Party to shape <a href="Dynamics%20%28music%29">dynamics</a> "a bit more subtly". As the sessions progressed, the band members started experimenting with <a href="Distortion%20%28music%29">distortion pedals</a> to add to their "chiming, clean guitar sound", although they did not listen to the producer about song structure. In the end, 15 tracks were recorded in 22 days in Copenhagen, while the vocal <a href="overdubbing">overdubbing</a> was subsequently done at London locations. Throughout the studio sessions, Okereke focused closely on the nuances of songs by often amending "microscopics".

Epworth's bass-oriented production was key to creating a universally appealing album and was also used as a musical background to the lyrics. Okereke has explained that the songs were crafted to balance dark lyrics with uplifting melodies. He called the final version of "Silent Alarm" "<a href="technicolour">technicolour</a>" due to its stylistic choices and indicated that Bloc Party achieved the aim of making the songs sound "better and bigger" when they were recorded in the studio. Moakes later pointed out that the band members were relative novices when they entered the recording sessions, and that for the most part they only did what they were advised; this is an additional reason why the album is disjunct and not focused on any particular musical style.

Many of the arrangements on "Silent Alarm" are strongly percussive. The leading song, "Like Eating Glass", was inspired by a remix of <a href="The%20Smiths">The Smiths</a>' "<a href="There%20Is%20a%20Light%20That%20Never%20Goes%20Out">There Is a Light That Never Goes Out</a>" Okereke heard in 2002. Its drum track was deliberately <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> louder than usual to add emphasis to the album's opening. "Helicopter" has a quick tempo of 171 <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a>, while "Positive Tension" begins with a solitary <a href="bassline">bassline</a> and builds up pace, first with a rhythmic drumming pattern, and then with a <a href="guitar%20solo">guitar solo</a> towards its conclusion. "Banquet" involves <a href="lead%20guitar">lead guitar</a> and <a href="rhythm%20guitar">rhythm guitar</a> playing in <a href="syncopation">syncopation</a>, while "Blue Light" has a slower tempo and a <a href="dynamics%20%28music%29">crescendo</a> towards the end. During the studio sessions, the "Bloc Party" EP version of "She's Hearing Voices" was reworked to include <a href="reverberation">reverberation</a> and <a href="Stereophonic%20sound">stereo</a> separation of the instrumental parts. "This Modern Love" begins minimally with <a href="Panning%20%28audio%29">panned</a> vocals before the rhythm section enters the mix and the song intensifies.

The second half of "Silent Alarm" includes more studio effects. "Pioneers" opens with a series of delayed <a href="guitar%20harmonic">guitar harmonic</a>s, while "Price of Gas" is driven by a marching-like sound created by Moakes walking in the studio with planks of wood strapped to his feet. "So Here We Are" is the only track on the album to not include vocal overdubbing. The song contains layered audio tracks of guitar and is followed by "Luno", which begins with 32 <a href="Bar%20%28music%29">bars</a> of bass guitar and drums. "Plans" has a slower tempo and uses a <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a> and effects such as <a href="flanging">flanging</a> during the chorus. The final track, "Compliments", incorporates an <a href="electronic%20drum">electronic drum</a> kit and the use of reverberation.

"Silent Alarm" does not contain a solitary lyrical centre and simply observes people's lives. Okereke wanted to leave individual listeners space to make their own conclusions, but has admitted that the record "operates in the realm of cultural politics". Much of the songwriting is inspired by the style of <a href="confessional%20poetry">confessional poetry</a> authors like <a href="Anne%20Sexton">Anne Sexton</a> and musicians <a href="Thom%20Yorke">Thom Yorke</a> and <a href="Bj%C3%B6rk">Björk</a>. In general, "Silent Alarm" tries to make clear an <a href="existentialism">existential</a> pointlessness in life. With hindsight, Okereke noted themes of "helplessness and weariness" because of the album's focus on how he was feeling between the ages of 18 and 20. Professor <a href="John%20Sutherland%20%28author%29">John Sutherland</a> has pointed out literary elements, often similar to <a href="Sylvia%20Plath">Sylvia Plath</a>'s work, in the lyricist's writing. Discussing the opening track "Like Eating Glass", he explained, "It strikes me that whoever did the lyrics must have read some of her work. It has the same rather jagged, surprising imagery. It could sit fairly comfortably in a poetry anthology." The recurring line "We've got crosses on our eyes" is inspired by cartoon characters who have crosses on their eyes when they die. Okereke tried to convey the feelings in a failing relationship, "of being completely disorientated", using childhood metaphors.

According to Heather Phares of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, "Pioneers" and "Price of Gas" exemplify the political undercurrent on "Silent Alarm", the latter including the explicit chant "War / War / War / War". "Helicopter" focuses in equal measure on America's "<a href="Red%20states%20and%20blue%20states">red states</a>" and on UK <a href="apathy">apathy</a> and "the people queueing for the <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a> by [Okereke's] house". "Positive Tension" concerns boredom and its dangers, focusing on how it "can lead you into dark places", while "Banquet" details "how sex is about power, submission, domination and real rapacious desire". The lyrics in the chorus of "She's Hearing Voices", "Red pill / Blue pill / <a href="Propofol">Milk of amnesia</a>", are in reference to the medications a friend of Okereke's took to relieve the symptoms of <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>. The lyricist has described the moment in "This Modern Love" when the backing vocals enter the mix before the second chorus as "perfect", because it evokes the idea of "two people on the telephone, who can't touch each other, and as the song and the conversation progress, everything amplifies".

"<a href="Bloc%20Party%20%28EP%29">Bloc Party EP</a>" was distributed in America in September 2004 by <a href="Dim%20Mak%20Records">Dim Mak Records</a>, while the band performed several gigs at the end of the year in the US and Canada. The release of "Silent Alarm" was preceded by the marketing of "<a href="Little%20Thoughts%20EP">Little Thoughts EP</a>" in Japan in December 2004, containing previous UK singles "<a href="Little%20Thoughts/Tulips">Little Thoughts/Tulips</a>" and "<a href="Helicopter%20%28Bloc%20Party%20song%29">Helicopter</a>" and new material. Bloc Party commenced UK promotional touring in January 2005 by performing during the <a href="NME%20Awards%20Tour">"NME" Awards Tour</a>. "<a href="Tulips%20%28song%29">Tulips</a>" was released from "Little Thoughts EP" in the US on 25 January. The first single from "Silent Alarm", "<a href="So%20Here%20We%20Are/Positive%20Tension">So Here We Are/Positive Tension</a>", was released on 31 January and peaked at number five on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>, the band's second highest peaking release on the chart (behind 2007's "<a href="The%20Prayer%20%28Bloc%20Party%20song%29">The Prayer</a>" which reached number 4). Between 31 January and 4 February, Bloc Party performed after autograph signing sessions in UK <a href="HMV">HMV</a> stores. The band achieved exposure largely because of word-of-mouth and favourable press reviews.

"Silent Alarm" was released on 2 and 14 February 2005, in Japan and Europe respectively. Chosen because the album has a sense of disquiet, the name comes from an article in "<a href="New%20Scientist">New Scientist</a>" about an early detection system for earthquakes in Japan, while the <a href="Album%20cover">cover art</a> is based on a bare winter landscape by <a href="Freelancer">freelance</a> photographer Ness Sherry. Bloc Party followed the album's release with a short European promotional tour in early March 2005. Between 17 March and 9 April, the band undertook a first headlining US tour to coincide with the American release of "Silent Alarm" through <a href="Vice%20%28magazine%29%23Record%20label">Vice Records</a> on 22 March. The US marketing was geared to establish a long-term fan base among "tastemakers and early-adopter rock enthusiasts", rather than a short-term emphasis on radio play. At the time, Okereke stated, "All I’m concerned about is playing live shows here to people who want to see us."

"Silent Alarm" entered the UK Albums Chart and the <a href="Irish%20Albums%20Chart">Irish Albums Chart</a> at number three, selling 61,737 copies during the first week in the former country. The album achieved <a href="gold%20album">gold</a> certification within 24 hours of its European release. 350,000 copies were shipped worldwide by the first week of March 2005; 20,000 were sent to America, double the record labels' January forecast. In the US, the record entered the "Billboard" 200 at number 114 and the "Billboard" Top Independent Albums at number seven. With little radio support, it became the best-selling release in Vice's history as a label. 123,000 copies of "Silent Alarm" were sold in the US by the end of July 2005. The record was listed at number 75 in the end-of-year UK Album Chart and was certified <a href="platinum%20record">platinum</a> by the <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">British Phonographic Industry</a> after more than 500,000 copies were sold in the UK during 2005. According to <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a>, 280,000 copies of the album were sold in the US by January 2007. By August 2012 it had sold 379,000 copies in the United States. At least 88,800 copies were sold in France. More than one million copies have been sold worldwide.

"Silent Alarm" received critical acclaim from critics; aggregating website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> reports a <a href="standard%20score">normalised</a> rating of 82 out of 100 based on 32 reviews which indicates "universal acclaim". <a href="Drowned%20in%20Sound">Drowned in Sound</a>'s Gen Williams described the album as "mature and expansive" and wrote that "the autonomy, creativity and sheer, elastic beauty that spans this debut more than justifies the rapidly accelerating hype". Andrew Romano of "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" similarly noted that it "lives up to the hype". Summing the record up as "dance rock, but highly caffeinated", Barry Walters of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" explained that the tracks are emotive and rhythmic in equal measure, while Nick Southall of <a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus</a> thought that every song is "full of thrilling ideas and inspired moments". Johnny Davis of "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" labelled "Silent Alarm" "an arty, confident and exhilarating debut", while Joshua Glazer of "<a href="URB%20%28magazine%29">URB</a>" compared Bloc Party to "every legendary band ever who followed an EP with an even better album and on into greatness". "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"s <a href="Alexis%20Petridis">Alexis Petridis</a> was less receptive and commented that the "reedy vocals and lyrical evocations of suburban ennui ... induce a worrying ennui of their own". Heather Phares of AllMusic stated that the record is not perfect, but praised its "passion and polish".

Romano and Glazer compared "Silent Alarm" to <a href="U2">U2</a>'s early work, while Walters claimed that it distills "twenty-five years of spiky British rock, from <a href="The%20Cure">The Cure</a> to <a href="Blur%20%28band%29">Blur</a> to hot Scots <a href="Franz%20Ferdinand%20%28band%29">Franz Ferdinand</a>". "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>"s Nitsuh Abebe noted particular similarities between "Banquet" and Franz Ferdinand's second single "<a href="Take%20Me%20Out%20%28song%29">Take Me Out</a>", calling both songs "wonderfully tight and energetic—the same kind of spiffy half-dancing rock". Phares suggested that Bloc Party are more comfortable with lyrical proclamations than their contemporaries Franz Ferdinand or <a href="The%20Futureheads">The Futureheads</a>, while Imran Ahmed of "NME" concluded, ""Silent Alarm" is no "<a href="Franz%20Ferdinand%20%28album%29">Franz Ferdinand</a>". In fact, listen to it with the words 'popular' and 'arty' in mind and its spirit is closer to the <a href="Manic%20Street%20Preachers">Manic Street Preachers</a>' "<a href="The%20Holy%20Bible%20%28album%29">The Holy Bible</a>"."

By the end of April 2005, "Silent Alarm" had charted in eighteen countries on four continents. Bloc Party toured in <a href="Japan">Japan</a> with <a href="The%20Rakes">The Rakes</a> at the start of May and completed a headlining tour of the <a href="United%20States">US</a> in June. The band members played their first concerts in Australia in July and spent the whole of August on the European festivals circuit. The remix album "Silent Alarm Remixed" was released on 29 August 2005 following Bloc Party's headlining slots at the <a href="Reading%20and%20Leeds%20Festivals">Reading and Leeds Festivals</a> on 26–28 August. The record includes reworked versions of all original tracks by artists such as <a href="Ladytron">Ladytron</a>, <a href="Death%20From%20Above%201979">Death From Above 1979</a>, and <a href="Nick%20Zinner">Nick Zinner</a> from <a href="Yeah%20Yeah%20Yeahs">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a>.

In September 2005, the band members embarked on their second major worldwide tour of the year; they played several gigs in North America between 8 and 24 September. Another headlining UK tour during the whole of October coincided with the release of new single "<a href="Two%20More%20Years%20%28song%29">Two More Years</a>". "Silent Alarm" was re-released in the UK on 17 October 2005 with "Little Thoughts" and "Two More Years" as bonus tracks. It contained a bonus DVD, "God Bless Bloc Party", which included Bloc Party's two June performances and backstage footage at <a href="El%20Rey%20Theatre">El Rey Theatre</a>, Los Angeles. Dan McIntosh of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> stated that the concert documentary shows the band "can consistently pull off its material live", but concluded that it focuses on Bloc Party "much too intently, far too soon".

In March 2018, the band announced they would play the album in full for the first time. The tour would take place in October and November and would travel to Amsterdam, Paris, Berlin, Brussels, Dublin plus dates in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. A subsequent live recording would also be available.
"Silent Alarm" was shortlisted for the 2005 <a href="Mercury%20Music%20Prize">Mercury Music Prize</a>, but was beaten by <a href="Antony%20and%20the%20Johnsons">Antony and the Johnsons</a>' second album "<a href="I%20Am%20a%20Bird%20Now">I Am a Bird Now</a>". It was also nominated for the 2005 <a href="Shortlist%20Music%20Prize">Shortlist Music Prize</a>, but lost to <a href="Sufjan%20Stevens">Sufjan Stevens</a>' fifth album "<a href="Illinois%20%28Sufjan%20Stevens%20album%29">Illinois</a>". The record was named Album of the Year for 2005 by "NME" ahead of <a href="Arcade%20Fire">Arcade Fire</a>'s debut album "<a href="Funeral%20%28album%29">Funeral</a>", by "Intro" in Germany, and by "Rumore" in Italy. "URB" included "Silent Alarm" in its unnumbered shortlist of the best records of 2005. It figured highly in other end-of-year best album lists: at number two by "<a href="Hot%20Press">Hot Press</a>" and by Stylus, at number four by Drowned in Sound, at number six by "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>", at number seven by Metacritic's chief editor, and at number nine by "<a href="The%20Denver%20Post">The Denver Post</a>". "Silent Alarm" earned Bloc Party several nominations, including Best Alternative Act at the 2005 <a href="MTV%20Europe%20Music%20Awards">MTV Europe Music Awards</a>, Best British Band at the 2006 <a href="NME%20Awards">"NME" Awards</a>, and Artist of the Year at the 2006 <a href="PLUG%20Awards">PLUG Awards</a>. The record itself won Indie Rock Album of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards. It was also nominated as Best Album at the 2006 "NME" Awards, and as Album of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards.

In 2006, "NME" placed "Silent Alarm" at number 55 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever!, while Drowned in Sound ranked it at number three in its list of the editorial staff's 66 favourite albums of 2000–2006.

Born into a naval family, Kinkaid was ranked in the lower half of his class on his graduation from the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> in June 1908. His early commissioned service was spent aboard <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s. In 1913, he began instruction in ordnance engineering and served in that field for many years. He saw action during the <a href="1916%20United%20States%20occupation%20of%20the%20Dominican%20Republic">1916 United States occupation of the Dominican Republic</a>.

Thomas Cassin Kinkaid was born in <a href="Hanover%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Hanover, New Hampshire</a>, on 3 April 1888, the second child and only son of Thomas Wright Kinkaid, a naval officer, and his wife Virginia Lee née Cassin. At the time, Thomas Wright Kinkaid was on leave from the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> and employed at the <a href="New%20Hampshire%20College%20of%20Agriculture%20and%20the%20Mechanic%20Arts">New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts</a>. When Thomas was only a year old, his father was posted to , and the family moved to <a href="Sitka%2C%20Alaska">Sitka, Alaska</a>, where a third child, Dorothy, was born in 1890. Over the next few years the family successively moved to <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>; <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>; <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a> and <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Washington%2C%20D.C.">Georgetown, Washington, D.C.</a>

Thomas attended <a href="Duke%20Ellington%20School%20of%20the%20Arts">Western High School</a> for three years before entering a <a href="U.S.%20Naval%20Academy">U.S. Naval Academy</a> preparatory school. He sought and secured an appointment to Annapolis from <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, and was asked to take the admission examination. The Navy was undergoing a period of expansion, and the intake of midshipmen was double that of two years earlier. Of the 350 who took the examination, 283 were admitted. The class was the largest since the Academy had opened in 1845.

Kinkaid was admitted to Annapolis as a <a href="midshipman">midshipman</a> in July 1904. His instructors included four future <a href="Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Chiefs of Naval Operations</a>: <a href="William%20S.%20Benson">William S. Benson</a>, <a href="William%20V.%20Pratt">William V. Pratt</a>, <a href="William%20D.%20Leahy">William D. Leahy</a> and <a href="Ernest%20J.%20King">Ernest J. King</a>. In 1905 he took an instructional cruise on . He also spent six weeks on , his only experience of a warship under sail. In subsequent years, his training cruises were on and which, while much newer, were by this time also obsolete. He participated in sports, particularly in <a href="Rowing%20%28sport%29">rowing</a>, earning a seat in the Academy's eight-oar <a href="racing%20shell">racing shell</a>. He graduated on 5 June 1908, ranked 136th in his class of 201.

Kinkaid's first posting was to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> where he joined the crew of the <a href="battleship">battleship</a> , part of the <a href="Great%20White%20Fleet">Great White Fleet</a>. During the next year, he circumnavigated the globe with the fleet, visiting <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> and <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. The fleet returned to its <a href="home%20port">home port</a> of Norfolk, Virginia in February 1909. In 1910, Kinkaid took his examinations for the rank of <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">ensign</a> but failed <a href="navigation">navigation</a>. While his classmates were promoted in June 1910, Kinkaid remained a midshipman, pending the result of a makeup examination in December 1910. In July, he developed <a href="pleurisy">pleurisy</a> and was hospitalized in <a href="New%20York%2C%20New%20York">New York, New York</a> before being sent to Annapolis to recuperate. At the time his father was in charge of the Naval Engineering Experiment Station there, which allowed Kinkaid to stay with his parents while studying for his navigation examination. In October, he was posted to the battleship whose skipper, <a href="Commander%20%28United%20States%29">Commander</a> <a href="William%20Sims">William Sims</a>, an Annapolis classmate of his father's, encouraged Kinkaid's early interest in gunnery. Kinkaid passed his navigation examination on 7 December and was promoted to ensign on 14 February 1911, backdated to 6 June 1910. While still at Annapolis, Kinkaid met Helen Sherburne Ross (1892-1980), the daughter of a Philadelphia businessman. The two were married on 24 April 1911 in the Silver Chapel of <a href="St.%20Mark%27s%20Episcopal%20Church%20%28Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania%29">St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Philadelphia</a> in a ceremony attended by a small number of guests. Their marriage produced no children. They enjoyed playing <a href="contract%20bridge">contract bridge</a> and <a href="golf">golf</a>, and Helen was the women's golf champion for the <a href="District%20of%20Columbia">District of Columbia</a> in 1921 and 1922.

In 1913, Kinkaid, now a <a href="lieutenant%20%28junior%20grade%29">lieutenant (junior grade)</a>, commenced a course in ordnance at the Naval Academy Postgraduate School. This consisted of four months of classroom instruction followed by tours with the leading naval ordnance manufacturers, and concluded with a tour of duty at the <a href="Indian%20Head%20Naval%20Proving%20Ground">Indian Head Naval Proving Ground</a>. Students had to commit to remain in the Navy for at least eight years. After completing the four months in the classroom at Annapolis, Kinkaid commenced a three-month assignment at <a href="Midvale%20Steel">Midvale Steel</a>, but this was interrupted after two months by the <a href="United%20States%20occupation%20of%20Veracruz">United States occupation of Veracruz</a>. Kinkaid was ordered to report to the <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a> for duty in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, during which the ship participated in the <a href="1916%20United%20States%20occupation%20of%20the%20Dominican%20Republic">1916 United States occupation of the Dominican Republic</a>. Kinkaid came under fire for the first time when the ship was fired upon from ashore. "Machias" replied with its <a href="M1895%20Colt-Browning%20machine%20gun">machine guns</a>. When one jammed, Kinkaid exposed himself to fire to assist in clearing the weapon. He fired it in response to gunfire against the ship. "Machias" returned home in December, and in February Kinkaid resumed his ordnance studies and went to <a href="Bausch%20%26amp%3B%20Lomb">Bausch & Lomb</a> in <a href="Rochester%2C%20New%20York">Rochester, New York</a>, where he studied the manufacture of spotting and <a href="fire%20control%20system">fire control system</a>s. In March he reported to the <a href="Washington%20Navy%20Yard">Washington Navy Yard</a>, where he wrote a pamphlet on fire control. He also created a design for a <a href="human%20torpedo">human torpedo</a>, but the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Ordnance">Bureau of Ordnance</a> decided that his concept was unsound. He completed his ordnance studies with tours at <a href="Bethlehem%20Steel">Bethlehem Steel</a>, the Indian Head Naval Proving Ground and the <a href="Sperry%20Gyroscope%20Company">Sperry Gyroscope Company</a> in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>.

In July 1916, Kinkaid reported to , the navy's newest battleship, as a gunfire spotter. He was promoted to <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in January 1917. In November 1917, he was ordered to supervise the delivery of a newly developed <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a> from the <a href="Norfolk%20Navy%20Yard">Norfolk Navy Yard</a> to the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>. On reaching <a href="London">London</a>, Kinkaid reported to Sims, now a <a href="Vice%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">vice admiral</a>, who then ordered Kinkaid to deliver secret documents to <a href="Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Admiral</a> William S. Benson at a meeting with <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied</a> naval leaders in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. Afterwards, Kinkaid returned to the United Kingdom and tested the rangefinder at on <a href="Whale%20Island%2C%20Hampshire">Whale Island, Hampshire</a>. He visited optical works in London, <a href="York">York</a> and <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> to study the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>'s rangefinders, and the Grand Fleet at its anchorages. On returning to the United States in January 1918, he visited Sperry Gyroscope and Ford Instruments to consult with them on fire control systems. Promoted to <a href="Lieutenant%20commander%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant commander</a> in February 1918, he was posted to "Pennsylvania"s <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>, . In May 1919, "Arizona" was sent to cover the <a href="Occupation%20of%20%C4%B0zmir">Greek occupation of Smyrna</a>. For his services from September 1918 to July 1919, Kinkaid was recommended for the <a href="Navy%20Distinguished%20Service%20Medal">Navy Distinguished Service Medal</a>, but it was not awarded.

Following the normal pattern of alternating assignments afloat and ashore, Kinkaid was posted to a shore billet as the Chief of the Supply Section of the Bureau of Ordnance in Washington D.C. During this time he published two articles in the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Institute">United States Naval Institute</a> magazine "<a href="Proceedings%20%28magazine%29">Proceedings</a>". The first, on the "Probability and Accuracy of Gun Fire", was a technical article arguing for more rather than bigger guns on battleships and cruisers. The <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Conference">Washington Naval Conference</a> would prevent these ideas from being put into practice, by restricting the number and size of warships and their guns. The second, entitled "Naval Corps, Specialization and Efficiency", argued for increasing the specializations of line officers rather than creating separate corps of specialists, a more controversial topic at a time when <a href="naval%20aviator">naval aviator</a>s were agitating for the creation of a new specialist branch of their own.

In 1922, Kinkaid became Assistant Chief of Staff to the Commander U.S. Naval Detachment in <a href="Turkey">Turkish</a> Waters, Rear Admiral <a href="Mark%20L.%20Bristol">Mark L. Bristol</a>. This tour saw the end of the Greek occupation of Smyrna. The ratification of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Lausanne">Treaty of Lausanne</a> by Turkey resulted in a draw-down of U.S. naval forces in the region, reducing Bristol's post to a primarily diplomatic one. In 1924, Kinkaid, whose father had died in August 1920, requested a posting back to the United States owing to his mother's ill-health. The ship taking him back, the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> , had to sail by way of <a href="Iran">Iran</a> in order to collect the body of Vice Consul <a href="Robert%20Imbrie">Robert Imbrie</a>, who had been killed by an angry mob in <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a>.
Kinkaid received his first command, the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> , on 11 November 1924. Since its home port was the <a href="Philadelphia%20Navy%20Yard">Philadelphia Navy Yard</a> and ships' captains did not have to spend their nights on board, Kinkaid was able to live with Helen at her parents' residence in Philadelphia. In July 1925, he was assigned to the <a href="Naval%20Gun%20Factory">Naval Gun Factory</a>. He was promoted to commander in June 1926. For the next two years, he served as Fleet Gunnery Officer and Aide to the <a href="Commander%20in%20Chief%2C%20U.S.%20Fleet">Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet</a>, Admiral <a href="Henry%20A.%20Wiley">Henry A. Wiley</a>. In 1929 and 1930, Kinkaid attended the <a href="Naval%20War%20College">Naval War College</a>. This was followed by duty on the <a href="General%20Board%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Navy">Navy General Board</a>. He was then seconded to the <a href="State%20Department">State Department</a> as a Naval Advisor at the <a href="Geneva%20Disarmament%20Conference">Geneva Disarmament Conference</a>.

Kinkaid next became <a href="Executive%20Officer">Executive Officer</a> of , one of the navy's newest battleships, in February 1933. By coincidence the ship was at anchor in <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach, California</a> when the <a href="1933%20Long%20Beach%20earthquake">1933 Long Beach earthquake</a> struck. Over the next few days thousands of sailors and marines participated in relief activities. Kinkaid convinced the captain to allow homeless families of crew members to stay on the ship, and erected tarpaulins on the quayside to create family areas. He sent medical and relief supplies ashore from "Colorado".

In 1934, he returned to Washington for a tour of duty with the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Navigation">Bureau of Navigation</a>, in charge of the Officers' Detail Section. During this time, Kinkaid came up for promotion to <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%29">captain</a>. Classmates including <a href="Richmond%20K.%20Turner">Richmond K. Turner</a> and <a href="Willis%20A.%20Lee">Willis A. Lee</a> were selected in January 1935, but Kinkaid was passed over for promotion. However, with the help of strong <a href="United%20States%20Navy%23Commissioned%20officer">fitness reports</a> from his superiors, Rear Admirals William D. Leahy and <a href="Adolphus%20Andrews">Adolphus Andrews</a>, he was selected in January 1936 and, after passing the required physical and professional examinations, was promoted on 11 January 1937. Kinkaid was then given his second seagoing command, the heavy cruiser . He assumed command from Captain <a href="Henry%20K.%20Hewitt">Henry K. Hewitt</a> on 7 June 1937.

Kinkaid hoped his next assignment would be that of <a href="naval%20attach%C3%A9">naval attaché</a> to London, but that job went to Captain <a href="Alan%20G.%20Kirk">Alan G. Kirk</a>. Kinkaid was offered and accepted the post in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> instead. He took up his posting there in November 1938. In 1939, he was also accredited with the American embassy in <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>. Kinkaid reported that Italy was unprepared for war. Only in May 1940 did he warn that Italy was mobilizing. Soon after, he learned from Count <a href="Galeazzo%20Ciano">Galeazzo Ciano</a> that Italy would declare war on France and Britain between 10 and 15 June 1940. He provided accurate reports on the damage inflicted by the British in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Taranto">Battle of Taranto</a>. He returned to the U.S. in March 1941.

Kinkaid now faced the prospect of selection to rear admiral. He knew that captains normally required a certain amount of seagoing command experience to be considered, but because his tour of duty on "Indianapolis" had been cut short in order to take up the post in Rome, he did not have enough months, and it was unlikely that a billet as captain of a battleship or cruiser would come up in sufficient time before the next round of selections. He discussed the matter with head of the Officers' Detail Section at the Bureau of Navigation, Captain <a href="Arthur%20S.%20Carpender">Arthur S. Carpender</a>, an Annapolis classmate who had himself recently been selected for flag rank. Carpender came up with a solution: he recommended Kinkaid for command of a destroyer squadron. This was a seagoing command, although Kinkaid was somewhat senior for it. Good fitness reports as commander of Destroyer Squadron 8, based in Philadelphia, resulted in Kinkaid's promotion to rear admiral in August 1941, despite having no more than two years' worth of total command experience. He became the last of his class to be promoted to flag rank before the United States entered the war. No one ranking lower in the class was promoted to flag rank before retirement.

Kinkaid was ordered to relieve Rear Admiral <a href="Frank%20J.%20Fletcher">Frank J. Fletcher</a> as commander of Cruiser Division 6, consisting of the heavy cruisers , "Minneapolis" and "San Francisco". This was part of the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">U.S. Pacific Fleet</a>, based at <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>. He did not reach his new command until after the Japanese <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, which brought the U.S. into the war. When he reached Hawaii, Kinkaid stayed with his brother-in-law, the <a href="Commander%20in%20Chief">Commander in Chief</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Fleet">U.S. Fleet</a>, Admiral <a href="Husband%20E.%20Kimmel">Husband E. Kimmel</a>, who was married to Kinkaid's sister Dorothy. Kinkaid accompanied Fletcher as an observer during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wake%20Island">attempt to relieve Wake Island</a>, and did not formally assume command of the division until 29 December 1941.

The traditional job of cruisers was scouting and screening, but with the loss of most of the battleships at Pearl Harbor these roles largely passed to the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s, while the cruisers' main mission became defending the carriers against air attack. Kinkaid's cruisers formed part of Rear Admiral <a href="Aubrey%20W.%20Fitch">Aubrey W. Fitch</a>'s <a href="Task%20Force%2011">Task Force 11</a>, which was built around the carrier . Task Force 11 rendezvoused with Fletcher's <a href="Task%20Force%2017">Task Force 17</a>, built around the carrier , on 1 May 1942. Kinkaid then became commander of the Task Group 17.2, the screening cruisers and destroyers of both carriers. Carrier warfare was in its infancy, and at this stage American carriers neither embarked adequate numbers of fighters, nor skillfully employed what they had. When Task Force 17 was attacked three days later in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Coral%20Sea">Battle of the Coral Sea</a>, the burden of defending the Task Force fell on Kinkaid's gunners. Their task was complicated by the radical maneuvering of the carriers under attack, which made it impossible for the screen to keep station. Despite the gunners' best efforts, both carriers were hit, and "Lexington" caught fire and sank. For his part in the battle, Kinkaid was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.

Kinkaid was detached with the cruisers "Astoria", "Minneapolis" and "New Orleans", and four destroyers on 11 May 1942 and sailed for <a href="Noum%C3%A9a">Nouméa</a>, while Fletcher took the rest of Task Force 17 to <a href="Tongatapu">Tongatapu</a>. Kinkaid then headed north to join the Vice Admiral <a href="William%20F.%20Halsey">William F. Halsey</a>'s <a href="Task%20Force%2016">Task Force 16</a>. Kinkaid's force became part of its screen which was under the command of Rear Admiral <a href="Raymond%20A.%20Spruance">Raymond A. Spruance</a>. Shortly after Task Force 16 returned to Pearl Harbor, Halsey was hospitalized with a severe case of <a href="dermatitis">dermatitis</a> and, on his recommendation, was replaced as commander of Task Force 16 by Spruance. Kinkaid then became commander of the screen, also known as Task Group 16.2. He was one of only four American flag officers present during the subsequent <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a>. However, he saw little action, as Task Force 16 did not come under attack.

After the battle, Spruance became chief of staff to Admiral <a href="Chester%20W.%20Nimitz">Chester W. Nimitz</a>, the Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPAC) and <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20Areas%20%28command%29">Pacific Ocean Areas</a> (CINCPOA). In Halsey's continued absence, Kinkaid became commander of Task Force 16, built around the carrier , although he was not an <a href="aviator">aviator</a>, and his experience with carriers had been restricted to commanding their screens at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway. In early July Kinkaid was briefed by Nimitz about plans for a <a href="Solomon%20Islands%20campaign">landing in the Solomon Islands</a>, codenamed <a href="Operation%20Watchtower">Operation Watchtower</a>. For this operation, Kinkaid's Task Force 16 would be one of three carrier task forces under Fletcher's overall command. To protect his <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, "Enterprise", Kinkaid had the battleship , heavy cruiser , antiaircraft cruiser , and five destroyers. The addition of the new battleship and its twenty <a href="5%26quot%3B/38%20caliber%20gun">/38 caliber dual-purpose guns</a> greatly strengthened Task Force 16's antiaircraft defenses.
The American landing on Guadalcanal evoked a furious reaction from the Japanese, who sent their fleet to reinforce the Japanese garrison on Guadalcanal. Fletcher's carriers had the mission of protecting the sea lanes to the Solomons.The two carrier forces clashed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Eastern%20Solomons">Battle of the Eastern Solomons</a>. Kinkaid disposed his carrier task force in a circular formation, with "Enterprise" at the center, the cruisers at 10 and 2 o'clock and the battleship aft at 6 o'clock. This proved to be a mistake. With a top speed of , the battleship fell behind the carrier when the latter accelerated to while under attack, depriving itself of the protection of the battleship's guns. "Enterprise" came under direct attack by Japanese fighters, taking three bomb hits that killed 74 of its crew. Extraordinary efforts permitted the carrier to continue operating aircraft, but it was forced to return to Pearl Harbor for repairs. In his report after the battle, Kinkaid recommended that the number of fighters carried by each carrier be further increased. For his part in the battle, he was awarded his second Distinguished Service Medal.

Task Force 16 returned to the South Pacific in October 1942, just in time to take part in the decisive action of the campaign, the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Santa%20Cruz%20Islands">Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands</a>, when the Japanese Army and Navy made an all-out effort to recapture the airfield of Guadalcanal. In addition to "Enterprise", Kinkaid's force included the battleship "South Dakota", heavy cruiser "Portland", anti-aircraft cruiser "San Juan", and eight destroyers. Fortunately, both "Enterprise" and "South Dakota" had been fitted with the new <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm">Bofors 40 mm</a> <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft gun</a>s. In the three early carrier battles, Kinkaid had been a subordinate commander. This time he was in overall command, in charge of Task Force 61, which included both his own Task Force 16 and Rear Admiral <a href="George%20D.%20Murray">George D. Murray</a>'s Task Force 17, built around the aircraft carrier . The battle unfolded badly. "Hornet" was sunk, and "Enterprise", "South Dakota" and "San Juan" were severely damaged. Aviators like Murray and <a href="John%20H.%20Towers">John H. Towers</a> blamed Kinkaid, as a non-aviator, for the loss of "Hornet". It became a black mark on Kinkaid's record. The Japanese had won another tactical victory, but Kinkaid's carriers had gained the Americans precious time to prepare and reinforce.

On 4 January 1943, Kinkaid became Commander of the North Pacific Force (COMNORPACFOR) following the failure of his predecessor, Rear Admiral <a href="Robert%20A.%20Theobald">Robert A. Theobald</a>, to work harmoniously with the <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a>. Command relationships in the North Pacific were complicated. Naval forces came under Fletcher's <a href="Northwestern%20Sea%20Frontier">Northwestern Sea Frontier</a>. The troops in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, including <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="William%20O.%20Butler">William O. Butler</a>'s <a href="Eleventh%20Air%20Force">Eleventh Air Force</a>, were commanded by <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Simon%20B.%20Buckner%2C%20Jr.">Simon B. Buckner, Jr.</a>, who was answerable to the head of the <a href="Western%20Defense%20Command">Western Defense Command</a>, <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="John%20L.%20DeWitt">John L. DeWitt</a>. Kinkaid's command was responsible for coordinating these forces and <a href="Aleutian%20Islands%20Campaign">retaking the Aleutian Islands</a> captured by the Japanese. He found the Army eager to cooperate, but encountered more difficulty with Rear Admiral <a href="Francis%20W.%20Rockwell%20%28admiral%29">Francis W. Rockwell</a>, the commander of the <a href="Amphibious%20Force%2C%20Pacific%20Fleet">Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet</a>, and later the <a href="IX%20Amphibious%20Force">IX Amphibious Force</a>. Rockwell was an Academy classmate of Kinkaid's, who was senior to him in rank, and convinced that he would both plan and command the amphibious phase of the operation rather than Kinkaid.

The War Department's original plan was to attack the main force on <a href="Kiska">Kiska</a> Island, but it took Kinkaid's suggestion to bypass Kiska in favor of an assault on the less heavily defended <a href="Attu%20Island">Attu Island</a>. Kinkaid moved his headquarters to Adak to be with those of Buckner and Butler, and at Buckner's suggestion established a joint mess where their two staffs ate meals together. However, the amphibious planning was done in <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> by Rockwell and his <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marine Corps</a> advisor, Brigadier General <a href="Holland%20M.%20Smith">Holland M. Smith</a>. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Attu">Battle of Attu</a> was only the third American amphibious operation of the war, and was carried through to a costly success under difficult conditions. The slow rate of progress ashore caused Kinkaid to relieve the Army commander, Major General <a href="Albert%20E.%20Brown">Albert E. Brown</a> and replace him with Major General <a href="Eugene%20M.%20Landrum">Eugene M. Landrum</a>. In June 1943 Kinkaid was promoted to vice admiral, thereby removing any lingering doubts about who was in charge, and awarded his third Distinguished Service Medal. He now prepared <a href="Operation%20Cottage">Operation Cottage</a>, the much larger invasion of Kiska. This was carried out as planned, but the invaders found that the Japanese had already evacuated the islands. In September 1943, Kinkaid was replaced by Vice Admiral Frank Fletcher.

In November 1943, Kinkaid replaced Carpender as Commander Allied Naval Forces, <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">Southwest Pacific Area</a>, and the <a href="Seventh%20Fleet">Seventh Fleet</a>, known as "MacArthur's Navy". <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> had twice requested Carpender's relief, and Kinkaid's record working with the Army in Alaska made him a logical choice. Australian newspapers hailed the appointment of a "fighting admiral", but neither MacArthur nor the Australian government had been consulted about the appointment, which was made by the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest King. This was a violation of the international agreement that had established the Southwest Pacific Area. The <a href="Navy%20Department">Navy Department</a> then announced that the replacement of Carpender with Kinkaid was merely a proposal, and MacArthur and the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a>, <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a>, were asked if Kinkaid was acceptable. They agreed that he was. In his new role, Kinkaid had two masters. As commander of the Seventh Fleet, he was answerable to King, but as Commander Allied Naval Forces, Kinkaid was answerable to MacArthur. Operations were conducted on the basis of "mutual cooperation" rather than "<a href="unity%20of%20command">unity of command</a>", and relations between the Army and Navy were not good. Kinkaid was not the most senior naval officer in the theater, for the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>'s <a href="Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Admiral</a> Sir <a href="Guy%20Royle">Guy Royle</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Navy">Royal Netherlands Navy</a>'s Admiral <a href="Conrad%20Emil%20Lambert%20Helfrich">Conrad Helfrich</a> were both senior to him.
Despite the unpromising relationship with the army, Kinkaid's most troublesome subordinate was a U.S. Navy officer, as had been the case with Rockwell in the Aleutians. This time, the subordinate was Rear Admiral <a href="Ralph%20W.%20Christie">Ralph W. Christie</a>, the commander of Task Force 71, the Seventh Fleet's submarines. Christie commonly greeted a returning submarine at the pier and awarded decorations on the spot. This practice bypassed military and naval award boards, and annoyed Kinkaid because confirmation of sinkings was accomplished by <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a>, and news of awards given so quickly could constitute a security breach. Kinkaid gave Christie and his other subordinates orders forbidding pierside awards, and the award of army medals to navy personnel. In June 1944, Christie accompanied a war patrol on Commander <a href="Samuel%20David%20Dealey">Samuel D. Dealey</a>'s submarine . Afterward, Christie met with MacArthur and related the events of the war patrol to the general, who decided to award Dealey the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a> and Christie the <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a>. When "Harder" was lost with Dealey and all hands on its next patrol, Christie recommended Dealey for the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a>. Kinkaid turned down the recommendation on the grounds that Dealey had already received the Distinguished Service Cross for the same patrol. Angered, Christie sent a dispatch to Kinkaid in an easily decipherable low-order code that criticized him and urged him to reconsider. Upset by both Christie's attitude and his losses, which included Dealey and Kinkaid's nephew, Lieutenant Commander <a href="Manning%20Kimmel">Manning Kimmel</a> on in July 1944, Kinkaid requested Christie's relief. On 30 December 1944, Christie was replaced by Captain <a href="James%20Fife%20Jr.">James Fife Jr.</a>

Other forces under Kinkaid's command included the cruisers of Task Force 74 under Rear Admiral <a href="Victor%20Crutchley">Victor Crutchley</a>, Task Force 75 under <a href="Russell%20S.%20Berkey">Russell S. Berkey</a>, and Task Force 76, the <a href="VII%20Amphibious%20Force">VII Amphibious Force</a>, under Rear Admiral <a href="Daniel%20E.%20Barbey">Daniel E. Barbey</a>. The main role of the Seventh Fleet was supporting MacArthur's drive along the northern coast of <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> with a series of 38 amphibious operations, usually directed by Barbey. Kinkaid accompanied MacArthur for the <a href="Admiralty%20Islands%20campaign">landing in the Admiralty Islands</a>, where the two men came ashore a few hours after the assault troops. With 215 vessels involved, <a href="Operations%20Reckless%20and%20Persecution">Operations Reckless and Persecution</a> in April 1944 together constituted the largest operation in New Guinea waters. It was followed in quick succession by four more operations, at <a href="Battle%20of%20Wakde">Wakde</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Biak">Biak</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Noemfoor">Noemfor</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Sansapor">Sansapor</a>.

For MacArthur's long-awaited return to the Philippines in October 1944, the Seventh Fleet was massively reinforced by Nimitz's Pacific Fleet. Kinkaid commanded the assault personally, with Barbey's VII Amphibious Force as Task Force 78, joined by Vice Admiral <a href="Theodore%20S.%20Wilkinson">Theodore S. Wilkinson</a>'s <a href="III%20Amphibious%20Force">III Amphibious Force</a> from the Pacific Fleet as Task Force 79. Kinkaid was also given Rear Admiral <a href="Jesse%20B.%20Oldendorf">Jesse B. Oldendorf</a>'s Task Force 77.2, a bombardment force built around six old battleships that had survived the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Rear Admiral <a href="Thomas%20L.%20Sprague">Thomas L. Sprague</a>'s Task Force 77.4, a force of <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a>s. However, Vice Admiral <a href="Marc%20Mitscher">Marc Mitscher</a>'s Task Force 38, the covering force of the fast carriers and battleships, remained part of Admiral Halsey's <a href="United%20States%20Third%20Fleet">Third Fleet</a>, which was not under MacArthur or Kinkaid's command.
Halsey's orders, which gave priority to the destruction of the Japanese fleet, led to the most controversial episode of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>. Four Japanese task forces converged on Kinkaid's forces in Leyte Gulf: a carrier task force under Vice Admiral <a href="Jisabur%C5%8D%20Ozawa">Jisaburō Ozawa</a>, from the north; a force under Vice Admiral <a href="Takeo%20Kurita">Takeo Kurita</a> through the <a href="Sibuyan%20Sea">Sibuyan Sea</a>; and two task forces commanded by Vice Admirals <a href="Sh%C5%8Dji%20Nishimura">Shōji Nishimura</a> and <a href="Kiyohide%20Shima">Kiyohide Shima</a>, which approached via the <a href="Surigao%20Strait">Surigao Strait</a>. Carrier aircraft from Task Force 38 engaged Kurita in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Sibuyan%20Sea">Battle of the Sibuyan Sea</a>, and forced him to withdraw. In a controversial decision, Halsey concluded that Kurita was no longer a threat and headed north after Ozawa's force but, due to a misunderstanding, Kinkaid believed that Halsey was still guarding the <a href="San%20Bernardino%20Strait">San Bernardino Strait</a>. Kinkaid deployed all available Seventh Fleet vessels in the Surigao Strait under Oldendorf facing Nishimura and Shima.

In the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Surigao%20Strait">Battle of the Surigao Strait</a> that night, Kinkaid engaged the Japanese with his <a href="PT%20boat">PT boat</a>s and Oldendorf's destroyers, cruisers and battleships. Oldendorf was able to "<a href="cross%20the%20T">cross the T</a>" of the enemy fleet. It was the last occasion in history where battleships fought each other. Of Nishimura's two battleships and five lesser ships, only the destroyer survived; Kinkaid's PT force lost only "PT-493", with 3 killed and 20 wounded. In Oldendorf's task force, only the destroyer was hit, mostly by <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a>. Total Allied casualties were 39 men killed and 114 wounded.

However, the victory was marred when Kurita's force doubled back and engaged Sprague's escort carriers in the <a href="Battle%20off%20Samar">Battle off Samar</a> the next day. Oldendorf's force headed back but Kurita withdrew after sinking an escort carrier, two destroyers and a <a href="destroyer%20escort">destroyer escort</a>. After the war, Halsey defended his actions in his memoirs. Kinkaid's position was that: 

Following the demise of Japanese naval power in the region, Kinkaid's Seventh Fleet supported the land campaigns in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> and the <a href="Borneo%20campaign%20%281945%29">Borneo</a>. Kinkaid was promoted to admiral on 3 April 1945. After the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> ended in August 1945, the Seventh Fleet assisted in landing troops in <a href="Korea">Korea</a> and northern <a href="China">China</a> to occupy these areas and repatriate Allied prisoners of war. Kinkaid elected not to land troops at <a href="Chefoo">Chefoo</a> as originally instructed because the city was in the hands of the Communist <a href="Eighth%20Route%20Army">Eighth Route Army</a>; <a href="Tsingtao">Tsingtao</a> was substituted instead. He was awarded the <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a> by the theater commander in China, Lieutenant General <a href="Albert%20C.%20Wedemeyer">Albert C. Wedemeyer</a>, and the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Sacred%20Tripod">Grand Cordon of the Order of Precious Tripod</a> by the Chinese government.

Kinkaid returned to the United States to replace Vice Admiral <a href="Herbert%20F.%20Leary">Herbert F.

He served on a board chaired by <a href="Fleet%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Fleet Admiral</a> Halsey which also included Admirals Spruance, Towers and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher, whose task was to nominate 50 of the 215 serving rear admirals for early retirement. Kinkaid was soon facing this fate himself, when the <a href="House%20Armed%20Services%20Committee">House Armed Services Committee</a> sought to reduce the number of <a href="four-star%20rank">four-star rank</a> officers in 1947. Kinkaid was one of three admirals, the others being Spruance and Hewitt, who would have to retire or be reduced in rank to rear admiral. After some lobbying, this was averted, and they were permitted to remain in the grade until 1 July 1950, past Kinkaid's retirement age. Retirement ceremonies, including a parade through <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, were held on 28 April 1950 and Kinkaid formally retired two days later.

In December 1946, it was announced that Halsey, Spruance and Turner had been awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Medal%20%28U.S.%20Army%29">Army Distinguished Service Medal</a>. A message soon arrived from MacArthur stating that he could not see why Kinkaid should not merit the same award, which had been recommended by Krueger during the war. The medal was duly presented by General <a href="Courtney%20Hodges">Courtney Hodges</a> in a ceremony on <a href="Governors%20Island">Governors Island</a> on 10 April 1947. The Australian government chose to honor Kinkaid with an honorary <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a>, which was presented by the ambassador at a ceremony at the embassy in Washington on <a href="Australia%20Day">Australia Day</a>, 26 January 1948. Kinkaid had already been created Grand Officer of the <a href="Order%20of%20Orange-Nassau">Order of Orange-Nassau</a> by Queen <a href="Wilhelmina%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Wilhelmina of the Netherlands</a> in 1944. In March 1948, he was made a Grand Officer of the <a href="Order%20of%20Leopold%20%28Belgium%29">Order of Leopold</a> and presented with the <a href="Croix%20de%20guerre">Croix de guerre</a> with Palm in a ceremony at the Belgian embassy in Washington, D.C.

He served as the naval representative with the <a href="National%20Security%20Training%20Commission">National Security Training Commission</a> from 1951 until it was abolished in 1957, and with the <a href="American%20Battle%20Monuments%20Commission">American Battle Monuments Commission</a> for fifteen years, beginning in 1953.

John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk

John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">KG</a>, <a href="Earl%20Marshal">Earl Marshal</a> (12 September 14156 November 1461) was a fifteenth-century English <a href="magnate">magnate</a> who, despite having a relatively short political career, played a significant role in the early years of the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>. Mowbray was born in 1415, the only son and heir of <a href="John%20de%20Mowbray%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">John de Mowbray, 2nd Duke of Norfolk</a>, and <a href="Katherine%20Neville%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Norfolk">Katherine Neville</a>. He inherited his titles upon his father's death in 1432. As a <a href="Minor%20%28law%29">minor</a> he became a <a href="Ward%20%28law%29">ward</a> of King <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">Henry VI</a> and was placed under the protection of <a href="Humphrey%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester</a>, alongside whom Mowbray would later campaign in France. He seems to have had an unruly and rebellious youth. Although the details of his misconducts are unknown, they were severe enough for the King to place strictures upon him and separate him from his followers. Mowbray's early career was spent in the military, where he held the wartime office of Earl Marshal. Later he led the defence of England's possessions in <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> during the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>. He fought in Calais in 1436, and during 1437–38 served as <a href="Lord%20Warden%20of%20the%20Marches">warden of the east march</a> on the <a href="Anglo-Scottish%20border">Anglo-Scottish border</a>, before returning to Calais.

Mowbray's marriage to Eleanor Bourchier in the early 1430s drew him into the highly partisan and complex politics of <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>, and he became the bitter rival of <a href="William%20de%20la%20Pole%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Suffolk">William de la Pole, Earl (later Duke) of Suffolk</a>. Mowbray prosecuted his feuds with vigour, often taking the law into his own hands. This often violent approach drew the disapproving attention of <a href="the%20Crown">the Crown</a>, and he was bound over for massive sums and imprisoned twice in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>. His enemies, particularly de la Pole, also resorted to violent tactics. As a result, local gentry looked to Mowbray for leadership, but often in vain; De la Pole was a powerful local force and favourite of the King, while Mowbray was neither.

As law and order collapsed in eastern England, national politics became increasingly <a href="Political%20faction">factional</a>, with popular revolts against the King's councillors. <a href="Richard%20of%20York%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20York">Richard, Duke of York</a>, who by the 1450s felt excluded from government, grew belligerent. He rebelled twice, and both times Mowbray defended King Henry. Eventually Mowbray drifted towards York, with whom he shared an enmity towards de la Pole. For much of the decade, Mowbray was able to evade direct involvement in the fractious political climate, and aligned with York early in 1460 until York's death later that year. In April 1461, Mowbray was instrumental in <a href="Edward%20IV%20of%20England">Edward</a>'s victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Towton">Battle of Towton</a>, bringing reinforcements late in the combat. He was rewarded by the new regime but did not live to enjoy it. He died in November 1461, and was succeeded as <a href="Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Duke of Norfolk</a> by his only son, <a href="John%20de%20Mowbray%2C%204th%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">John</a>.

John Mowbray was the only son of <a href="John%20de%20Mowbray%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">John de Mowbray, 2nd Duke of Norfolk</a>, and his wife <a href="Katherine%20Neville%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Norfolk">Katherine Neville</a>, who was a daughter of <a href="Ralph%20Neville%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Westmorland">Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland</a>, a powerful <a href="magnate">magnate</a> in <a href="northern%20England">northern England</a>. The younger Mowbray was born on 12 September 1415 while his father was in France campaigning with <a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">Henry V</a>. Mowbray was seventeen at his father's death and still legally a <a href="Minor%20%28law%29">minor</a>. During his minority, his estates were granted by <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">Henry VI</a> to <a href="Humphrey%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester</a> for a <a href="Farm%20%28revenue%20leasing%29">farm</a> of 2000 <a href="Mark%20%28currency%29">marks</a> (approximately <a href="%C2%A3">£</a>1,667). Until his majority, the Mowbray lands were administered by the English <a href="exchequer">exchequer</a> to the benefit of the crown, at a time when the government was in dire need of cash, due to the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>. Mowbray's <a href="Ward%20%28law%29">wardship</a>, and the right to <a href="Arranged%20marriage">arrange his marriage</a>, was sold to <a href="Anne%20of%20Gloucester">Anne of Gloucester, Countess of Stafford</a> for £2,000. By March 1434, Anne had arranged for Mowbray's marriage to her daughter <a href="Eleanor%20Bourchier">Eleanor Bourchier</a>.
As a young adult, Mowbray appears to have been raucous and troublesome, and surrounded himself with equally unruly followers. This seems to have drawn the King's attention: Mowbray had only recently—with the other lords—sworn an oath in parliament not to recruit or welcome villains and wrong-doers into his affinity, nor to maintain them. He was summoned before the King and his council. Mowbray was instructed in how to conduct himself henceforth, and a precise regimen was imposed upon him. Exactly which aspects of Mowbray's behaviour were viewed as problematic is unknown, but since it resulted in unprecedented council-imposed restrictions upon him, his conduct must have been viewed as "abnormal". The ordinances not only dictated the time he should go to bed at night and rise in the morning, The conditions addressed his demeanour; his unruly followers were dismissed, to be replaced with those deemed suitable by Henry VI. Their stated role was to turn Mowbray towards "good reule and good governaunce," and they were not just to guide Mowbray but to report any disobedience of the council's instructions back to that body.

On his father's death in 1432, Mowbray inherited the office of <a href="Earl%20Marshal">Earl Marshal</a>, but not yet his father's lands or titles. Mowbray's father lacked full control of his estates, as they were <a href="Encumbrance">encumbered</a> by two Mowbray <a href="dowager">dowager</a>s, Mowbray's mother Katherine, and his sister-in-law, Constance Holland. They each held a third of the inheritance as their <a href="dower">dower</a>. Constance died in 1437, but Mowbray's mother survived until around 1483. Because of this, the historian Rowena Archer—who made one of the few full-length studies of the Mowbray family—described Mowbray as inheriting a "hopeless" and "onerous" legacy. It also had political consequences for the future. As he never held much property in the counties where his inheritance was (only holding, for example, seven of the twenty-six manors held by the Mowbrays in Norfolk and Suffolk), his influence was thus restricted there.
Immediately after his father's death, Mowbray made claim to the earldom of Arundel, setting him against <a href="John%20FitzAlan%2C%2014th%20Earl%20of%20Arundel">John, Lord Maltravers</a>, who had also made claim. This was an old dispute. Mowbray's father and <a href="Thomas%20de%20Mowbray%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">grandfather</a> had also sought the earldom, blocking <a href="John%20FitzAlan%2C%2013th%20Earl%20of%20Arundel">Maltravers' father</a>'s claim. Mowbray based his right through his grandmother <a href="Elizabeth%20Fitzalan%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Norfolk">Elizabeth Fitzalan, Duchess of Norfolk</a>; Maltravers through his great-grandfather <a href="Richard%20FitzAlan%2C%2011th%20Earl%20of%20Arundel">Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel</a>. In July 1433 Mowbray presented a petition to <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament</a> (receiving special permission to attend as a minor). Mowbray—"in a rather remarkable decision," says Archer—lost the case. Maltravers, though, died in May 1435 and so was never summoned to parliament under his new title.

Mowbray's ancestors had been largely <a href="The%20Midlands">Midlands</a> magnates based around <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a> estates. Even his father—after he became duke of Norfolk and inheritited his mother's East Anglian dower lands—was often an absentee lord. Mowbray's father was thus never able to establish a sizeable (or "particularly coherent") regional following there, and this was the situation Mowbray inherited.

In August 1436 Mowbray accompanied the Duke of Gloucester on a campaign to relieve <a href="Siege%20of%20Calais%20%281436%29">Calais</a>, then under siege by <a href="Philip%20the%20Good">Philip the Good</a>, <a href="Duke%20of%20Burgundy">Duke of Burgundy</a>. The expedition, in which Mowbray provided a contingent, was "one of the largest English armies assembled during the fifteenth century." The campaign was a success, and Burgundy was forced to withdraw. On 13 September that year, Mowbray received <a href="Livery%23Sue%20one.27s%20livery">livery</a> of his inheritance, and immediately began a busy period devoted to royal service. In 1437, possibly because of Gloucester's <a href="patronage">patronage</a>, Mowbray was appointed <a href="Warden%20of%20the%20Eastern%20March">Warden of the Eastern March</a> for a one-year term. He had little experience of the north of England, yet was paid wartime wages of £5,000 to campaign against the Scots.

Mowbray returned to Calais and <a href="Gu%C3%AEnes">Guînes</a> in 1438, leading an expedition to strengthen their defenses as Burgundy still presented a threat. Although he shortly after returned to England, in June 1439 he was again back in Calais, at <a href="Oye-Plage">Oye</a>, escorting <a href="John%20Kemp">Archbishop John Kemp</a>'s diplomatic mission to the <a href="peace%20conference">peace conference</a>. Possibly Mowbray disapproved of royal foreign policy, which was then aimed at making peace with the French.

For much of the 1430s, Mowbray had problems in <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>, where the bulk of his estates now lay. <a href="William%20de%20la%20Pole%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Suffolk">William de la Pole</a> become increasingly powerful, both at court and in the region, and was Mowbray's biggest rival. Mowbray had enough political clout in the 1430s to control <a href="Parliamentary%20representation%20by%20historic%20counties">parliamentary representation</a> in Suffolk, but the local importance of the duke weakened his grasp. Mowbray clashed with de la Pole, and committed many illegalities doing so. These included damaging property of rivals, assaults, false allegations of outlawry (with confiscation of goods), and even murder.

For Mowbray, East Anglia as the locus of his landed authority was forced upon him since this was where the majority of his estates were located: much of his Lincolnshire inheritance was held by his mother as dower. He was then a newcomer to political society in the region, and had to share influence with others. By the time of his majority, de la Pole—with his links to central government and the King—was an established power in the region. He hindered Mowbray's attempts at regional domination for over a decade, leading to a feud that stretched from the moment Mowbray became Duke of Norfolk to the murder of de la Pole in 1450. The feud was often violent, and lead to fighting between their followers. In 1435, <a href="Robert%20Wingfield">Robert Wingfield</a>, Mowbray's steward of Framlingham, led a group of Mowbray retainers who murdered James Andrew, one of de la Pole's men. When local aldermen attempted to arrest Wingfield's party, the latter rained arrow fire upon the aldermen, but Mowbray secured royal pardons for those responsible.

By 1440, de la Pole was a royal favourite. He instigated Mowbray's imprisonment on at least two occasions: in 1440 and in 1448. The first saw him <a href="Binding%20over">bound over</a> for the significant amount of £10,000, and confined to living within the royal Household, preventing him from returning to seek revenge in East Anglia. Likewise, apart from an appointment to <a href="Royal%20Commission">commissions</a> of <a href="oyer%20and%20terminer">oyer and terminer</a> in <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a> in 1443 (after the suppression of <a href="Gladman%27s%20Insurrection">Gladman's Insurrection</a>), he received no other significant offices or patronage from the crown. A recent biographer of Mowbray's, the historian Colin Richmond, has described this as Mowbray's "eclipse". Richmond suggests that soon after his last imprisonment in 1449, Mowbray undertook a <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> to Rome; a licence for him to do so had been granted three years earlier.

De la Pole fought back with what one contemporary labelled "greet hevyng an shoving." He was successful in doing so. Within a couple of years, Mowbray could not protect his retainers as he had previously done. A Paston letter tells how Robert Wingfield, who was involved in a bitter dispute with one Robert Lyston, "procured and exited the wurthi prince the Duke of Norffolk to putte oute ageyn the seid Robert Lyston" from the latter's Suffolk manors. Lyston, with de la Pole's support, repeatedly sued Wingfield until in 1441 Wingfield was imprisoned in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>. In 1440, Mowbray was able to influence the <a href="Exchequer%20of%20Pleas">Exchequer</a> to quash Wingfield's fines; but Mowbray's success was fleeting. Mowbray was more successful in his support of <a href="Sir%20John%20Fastolf">John Fastolf</a>—in one of the latter's many lawsuits 1441, and was able to impose an advantageous settlement (for Fastolf) in <a href="Court%20of%20Chancery">Chancery</a>. Generally, though, says <a href="Helen%20Castor">Helen Castor</a>, Mowbray's influence "proved woefully inadequate" to protect and defend his retainers and tenants to the degree they could reasonably expect from their lord. It was his supporters' misfortune, one historian has said, that "Norfolk's power never matched the status attributed to him".

Mowbray's personal and political situation did not improve over the following decade. Between 1440 and 1441 he was imprisoned in the Tower following a dispute with <a href="John%20Heydon%20%28died%201479%29">John Heydon</a>, who was close to de la Pole. Mowbray was bound over on 2 July 1440 for the "enormous" sum of 10,000 marks, had to reside in the King's household, while swearing no further  harm to Heydon.

In 1443 Mowbray and Wingfield fell out over <a href="Hoo%2C%20Suffolk">Hoo</a> manor. Wingfield had received Hoo from Mowbray's father, but Mowbray wanted it returned. The dispute fell into violence; <a href="R.%20L.%20Storey">R. L. Storey</a> described Mowbray's "methods of argument" as exceptionally belligerent. According to Storey the duke "brought a force of men, with cannon and other siege engines, battered Wingfield's house at Letheringham, forced an entry, ransacked the building and removed valuables amounting to nearly £5,000."

Wingfield deserted Mowbray in light of the continuing attacks over Hoo, and offered a <a href="Bounty%20%28reward%29">bounty</a> of 500 marks for the head of a Mowbray retainer. In November 1443 Mowbray was bound over for £2,000 to keep the peace with Wingfield and instructed to appear before the royal council the following April. The council ordered them to seek <a href="arbitration">arbitration</a>. This found against Mowbray, who had to pay Wingfield 3,500 marks as compensation for the damage the duke caused to Letheringham. He also had to recompense Wingfield for Hoo before he could get it back. It was presumably as part of these proceedings that Mowbray suffered his second bout of imprisonment in the Tower, which commenced on 28 August 1444; he was released six days later.

In June 1446 Henry Howard, one of Mowbray's father's retainer, was murdered. He was visiting his sister-in-law (and Mowbray's aunt), Margaret Mowbray, at the time, as her house was only five miles (8.0 km) away. Howard's killers appear to have been retainers of <a href="John%20Scrope%2C%204th%20Baron%20Scrope%20of%20Masham">John, Baron Scrope of Masham</a>; who may have actively abetted the killing.  On 18 June 1446 Mowbray oversaw the <a href="presentment">presentment</a> of an <a href="Ipswich">Ipswich</a> jury to examine the murder, but the case stalled. Scrope petitioned the King on the basis that Mowbray's proceedings were "inaccurate and inherently malicious," and as a result, the King ordered that proceedings against Scrope's men cease. At least five of the thirteen jurors were Mowbray retainers. This may have been the only occasion on which Mowbray personally sat on a local King's Bench commission as the hearing <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20peace">J.P</a>.

The arbitration did not resolve their feud, and in 1447 Wingfield returned to the attack. Along with another ex-Mowbray retainer, <a href="William%20Brandon%20%28died%201491%29">William Brandon</a>, he assaulted, robbed and threatened Mowbray's staff. Mowbray—as Justice of the Peace for Suffolk—ordered him to keep the <a href="Peace%20%28law%29">King's peace</a> but was ignored. Wingfield was then committed to <a href="Melton%2C%20Suffolk">Melton</a> <a href="gaol">gaol</a>, but three hours later Brandon broke him out of prison. Mowbray successfully applied to <a href="Chancery%20%28medieval%20office%29">Chancery</a> for <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a> ordering Brandon and Wingfield to not come within 7 <a href="mile">mile</a>s (11 <a href="Kilometre">km</a>) of Mowbray. This order too was ignored, and they stayed at Letheringham (only five miles from Mowbray's castle at <a href="Framlingham%20Castle">Framlingham</a>), and started breaking into Mowbray's retainers' houses in the area. Mowbray requested that a commission of oyer and terminer be organised to investigate Wingfield and Brandon, which was issued in late December 1447.

By the early 1450s Mowbray believed that East Anglia was his to rule, and described himself as the "princypall rewle and governance throw all this schir" (i.e. that his was the "principal rule and governance through all this shire"). In the late 1440s, <a href="John%20de%20Vere%2C%2012th%20Earl%20of%20Oxford">John de Vere, the Earl of Oxford</a>, another enemy of de la Pole, sought Mowbray's "good Lordship". In 1451 Mowbray and de Vere collaborated in the county of Suffolk while investigating suspected participatants in <a href="Jack%20Cade%27s%20Rebellion">Jack Cade's Rebellion</a>, which had broken out the previous year. The region continued to experience disorder, and Mowbray's men were responsible for much of it. The unrest included the destruction of properties belonging to <a href="Alice%20Chaucer%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Suffolk">Alice Chaucer, Duchess of Suffolk</a>. The Duke of Suffolk himself fell from power and was murdered in April 1450. In the following years, Mowbray's <a href="Affinity%20%28medieval%29">affinity</a>, according to Richmond, committed "one outrage after another [and] the duke was either unable to control them, or chose not to do so". Mowbray used any means to defeat his opponents, including charging them with <a href="outlaw">outlaw</a>ry in another county without their knowledge, and then seizing their goods as <a href="Forfeiture%20%28law%29">forfeited</a> to himself. 
Mowbray also forced the <a href="gaoler">gaoler</a> of <a href="Bury%20St%20Edmunds">Bury St Edmunds</a> to release a man charged with murder into Mowbray's custody. According to the gaoler's later report, he had done so but only out of "fear and terror" of the Duke of Norfolk. Mowbray spent much of the early 1450s hunting down de la Pole's affinity.

The removal of de la Pole did not advance Mowbray's power in East Anglia. He still had rivals in the region with wealth and court connections. The Earl of Oxford in particular wished to extend his landholdings from Essex into Suffolk, while <a href="Lord%20Scales">Lord Scales</a> had been granted the remnants of de la Pole's affinity by <a href="Margaret%20of%20Anjou">Queen Margaret</a>. It was this lack of political connections (specifically, his exclusion from the King's council) that lead to his defeat against de la Pole. Mowbray was unsuccessful in influencing local commissions and in nominating parliamentary candidates for shire elections. In any case, the county of Norfolk already possessed a strong and relatively independent layer of wealthy gentry, including the Pastons, the <a href="Howard%20family">Howards</a> and those around <a href="John%20Fastolf">John Fastolf</a>. They were eager to augment their positions at the expense of a neighbour, even if a lord.

During the 1450s, English politics become increasingly partisan and factional, with intermittent rises in violence and local disorder. Jack Cade's rebellion in 1450—directly aimed at royal favourites like de la Pole—explicitly named Mowbray as one of the King's "natural counsellors" necessary to reform the realm. Even so, Mowbray was part of a major royal army which eventually defeated the rebels.

During the next crisis—the near-rebellion of <a href="Richard%20of%20York%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20York">Richard of York</a> in Autumn 1450—Mowbray took York's side against the new royal favourite, <a href="Edmund%20Beaufort%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset</a>. York canvassed Mowbray for support, as he was one of the few nobles openly critical of the court. For the former, this was a logical alliance as Mowbray was as bitter an enemy of Somerset as York was. Mowbray gathered his forces at Ipswich on 8 November (having ordered <a href="John%20Paston%20%28died%201466%29">John Paston</a> to meet him there "with as many clenly people as ye may get"), and may have travelled into London with York, who had also recruited locally. Thus, when he arrived for the parliament it was with a large, heavily armed force. Mowbray was appointed, with the Duke of York and <a href="Thomas%20de%20Courtenay%2C%205th/13th%20Earl%20of%20Devon">Earl of Devon</a>, to maintain law and order in the City of London for the duration of the parliament, though his retinue caused as much trouble as it prevented. On 1 December, they joined with York's force and attacked Somerset's house in <a href="Blackfriars%2C%20London">Blackfriars</a>. The battle lead to the beleaguered duke seeking refuge in the Tower of London in <a href="protective%20custody">for his own protection</a>. Two days later the King and his magnates rode through London with up to 10,000 men; Mowbray rode ahead with a force of 3,000. The display was carefully designed to quell any remnants of support for Cade's rebels.
Mowbray's alliance with York was intermittent. York again rebelled in 1452, confronting a royal army at <a href="Dartford">Dartford</a> when Mowbray was with the King. For his service he received £200 and a gold cup. York may have abandoned the alliance because of his objection to Mowbray's violent behaviour in East Anglia at a time when York was presenting himself as a candidate of law and order. Mowbray's campaign against Somerset, meanwhile, continued unabated. In 1453, with the King incapacitated and York <a href="Protector%20%28title%29">protector</a>, Mowbray presented charges against Somerset in <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">parliament</a>, attacking his failure to prevent the loss of the "two so noble Duchies of Normandy and Guyenne" in France. Somerset was imprisoned in the Tower for the next year. In April 1454, Mowbray was asked to join the York's regency <a href="Curia%20regis">council</a>, and although he swore to York's government, claimed to be too ill to attend.

The King recovered his health early in 1455 and the protectorate came to an end. Somerset was released from the Tower and as a result, according to historian <a href="Ralph%20A.%20Griffiths">Ralph Griffiths</a>, Mowbray may have ("quite rightly" he says) feared for his own safety.

Following the collapse of the 1454–55 protectorate, the Yorkist lords retreated to their estates, and Mowbray distanced himself from factional politics. An uneasy peace existed between the court and the Yorkists until April 1455, when the King summoned a Great Council to meet at <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a> the following month. The Duke of York feared that the purpose of this council was to destroy him; several chroniclers of the day suggest that Somerset was poisoning the King's mind against York. The duke and his Neville allies proceeded to raise an army from their northern estates. The King and a small force left London on 20 May; the Yorkists approached from the north with a speed calculated to surprise. In a <a href="pre-emptive%20strike">pre-emptive strike</a>, York and his allies intercepted the King at the <a href="first%20Battle%20of%20St%20Albans">first Battle of St Albans</a>. Mowbray managed to avoid involvement in the fighting, even though, as Earl Marshal, his <a href="herald">herald</a>s were used during negotiations between the two camps. It is uncertain at what point Mowbray joined the battle, or if he even reached the King in time to take part. The fighting lasted only a short time, and though there were very few fatalities among the soldiery, the <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Earl of Northumberland</a>, the Duke of Somerset and <a href="Thomas%20Clifford%2C%208th%20Baron%20de%20Clifford">Lord Clifford</a> were killed. They were not the only three of the King's most loyal supporters, but Percy and Somerset at least were bitter enemies of the Nevilles and York.

After the battle, Mowbray threatened to hang the <a href="Standard-bearer">Royal Standard bearer</a>, <a href="Philip%20Wentworth">Sir Philip Wentworth</a>, on hearing that Wentworth "cast it down and fled" the battlefield. Whatever part, if any, Mowbray played in the fighting, by now contemporaries viewed him as being sympathetic to York. It is likely that Mowbray was deliberately vacillating. He did not attend York's victory parliament in 1455, and might have gone on pilgrimage: he is known to have walked to <a href="Walsingham%20Priory">Walsingham</a> in 1456, and over the next two years may have travelled to <a href="Amiens%20Cathedral">Amiens</a>, Rome or even <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>.

After four years' peace, civil war resumed in September 1459 when the Yorkist <a href="Richard%20Neville%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">Earl of Salisbury</a> fought off a royal ambush at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Blore%20Heath">Battle of Blore Heath</a>. Salisbury won that battle but was defeated soon after with the Duke of York at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ludford%20Bridge">Battle of Ludford</a>. The Yorkists escaped into exile. Mowbray had taken neither side, but with the Yorkists exiled, when <a href="Parliament%20of%20Devils">a parliament</a> was called at <a href="Coventry">Coventry</a>, Mowbray attended. Here the Yorkists were <a href="Attainder">attainted</a>, and on 11 December 1459 Mowbray took an oath of loyalty to keep Henry VI on the throne. He received several royal commissions in the final months of <a href="House%20of%20Lancaster">Lancastrian</a> rule.

The Nevilles and Earl of March spent their exile in Calais, while York and his other son, <a href="Edmund%2C%20Earl%20of%20Rutland">Edmund, Earl of Rutland</a>, retired to <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>. The Nevilles returned to England in June 1460. They were admitted into London, where they could plan an assault on the King's army, then based in Northampton. On 10 July the Yorkist army under Warwick and March defeated the royalist army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Northampton%20%281460%29">Battle of Northampton</a>, and once again the King was captured. <a href="Colin%20Richmond">Colin Richmond</a> describes Mowbray as "more likely to have observed from a safe distance than participated" in it.

York returned from exile in October 1460, and much to the frustration of his allies, made claim to the throne. Mowbray's reaction is uncertain as the chroniclers omit mention of him, but some historians note how Mowbray sided with them during the Yorkists' return from exile. The exact cause of his change of loyalty is unknown. Colin Richmond argues that the Lancastrian defeat at Northampton in June 1460 was fundamental, and Mowbray lost friends and colleagues. It is possible that King Henry's capture there encouraged him to desert the King. <a href="Christine%20Carpenter%20%28historian%29">Christine Carpenter</a> puts it down almost solely to Mowbray's failure to improve his position in Norfolk under Henry, while Castor points to the October 1460 Yorkist parliament being the turning point for Mowbray: possibly he believed that the attempted settlement contained in the <a href="Act%20of%20Accord">Act of Accord</a> was the best possible outcome.

The King and Queen still had the support of much of the nobility and withdrew to the north to commence a campaign of ravaging York and the Nevilles' estates. This forced York, Salisbury and Rutland to move north on 9 December to suppress the Lancastrians. Mowbray remained in London with Salisbury's and York's sons, the Earls of <a href="Richard%20Neville%2C%2016th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Warwick</a> and March. York and Salisbury's expedition ended in disaster. Choosing to engage a Lancastrian army outside the duke's castle at <a href="Sandal%20Castle">Sandal</a>, the Yorkists were crushed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wakefield">Battle of Wakefield</a> on 30 December. York Rutland and Salisbury, died in or soon after the battle. The Queen's army made its way south towards London. Mowbray, Warwick and his brother <a href="John%20Neville%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Montagu">John Neville, Lord Montagu</a>, marched north to intercept the approaching Lancastrians. Mowbray brought King Henry with them. The armies clashed on 17 February 1461 outside St Albans, where the Yorkists <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20St%20Albans">were defeated</a>. Mowbray and Warwick abandoned the King to his wife and her supporters, and retreated to London before the victorious Lancastrian army could reach the city.

The Lancastrian army marched on London, but were refused entry. On 3 March 1461 Mowbray attended a <a href="Great%20council%20of%20peers">great council</a> at <a href="Baynard%27s%20Castle">Baynard's Castle</a>, organised small group of Yorkist loyalists, and agreed to offer <a href="Edward%20IV%20of%20England">Edward, Earl of March</a> the throne. The following day—indicating the urgency for resolution felt by the Yorkists by this stage— Mowbray was sent to East Anglia to "prepare for the war on the party of King Edward". The Lancastrian army had returned to the north where, on 29 March 1461, York and Lancaster met at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Towton">Battle of Towton</a>. It was to be one of the longest and bloodiest battles fought on British soil, and "fought in bitter Yorkshire weather and no less bitter spirit", according to historian <a href="Charles%20Ross%20%28historian%29">Charles Ross</a>. On Mowbray's advice, Edward followed the Lancastrian army north with a new army.

Mowbray seems to have recruited successfully; one of the <a href="Paston%20Letters">Paston letters</a> mentions that "every town hath waged and sent forth." He left East Anglia via <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> on 17 March 1461, where Sir John Howard, his cousin and retainer, and his forces joined Mowbray's. Mowbray's army may have constituted elements of the Yorkist <a href="rearguard">rearguard</a>, as such not part of the main army, and were intending to join with it later. He was still not with Warwick's and March's <a href="council%20of%20war">council of war</a> at <a href="Doncaster">Doncaster</a> in late March. There are different explanations for the delay. He may have faced difficulty in <a href="Muster%20%28military%29">mustering</a> troops; the army recently raised to fight at St Albans had been dispersed and this would require re-mustering. It is likely that—since he died only a few months later—Mowbray was too ill to keep up with the main Yorkist force.

At <a href="Pontefract">Pontefract</a> Mowbray transferred command to Howard, knowing that time was of the essence for the Yorkists and while he was with them, his soldiers could only march as quickly as he could. If Mowbray was ill, then it is unlikely that he fought personally; Boardman observed that "a sick man would never have survived such a strength-sapping ordeal, especially a noble in armour-plate." If his contingent was tasked with bringing up Yorkist artillery, which would have further slowed them down and they may have abandoned armoury en route to increase their speed.

Mowbray arrived late but at a crucial point of the battle. His prolonged absence after a day's bitter fighting must have been a worry for the Yorkists, especially as they may have thought him up to a day's march away. Mowbray's absence presented an acute problem for them; <a href="Philip%20A.%20Haigh">Philip A. Haigh</a> describes them, by four o'clock in the afternoon, as doomed without him. There must have been much messaging between Edward and Mowbray throughout the day, but <a href="Battle%20Fatigue">battle fatigue</a> had almost certainly set in on both sides by the time Mowbray's troops arrived on the eastern edge of the
battlefield. A contemporary chronicler described the situation thus

Mowbray launched a decisive attack on the Lancastrian <a href="Flanking%20maneuver">flank</a>, turning them left. His arrival both reinvigorated the Yorkist army and crushed Lancastrian morale with his surprise attack and led rapidly to a Lancastrian <a href="rout">rout</a> to give the victory to Edward IV.

<a href="Earls%20Marshal">Earls Marshal</a>s played an important role in coronations. Like his predecessors, as Earl Marshal Mowbray officiated the coronation of Edward IV on 28 June 1461. Within two months he received several lucrative offices. Public order was a problem from the beginning of the King's reign, and East Anglia was no exception. Mobs rampaged during that year's parliamentary elections. Norfolk may have encouraged this; he is certainly a candidate for ordering the murder of <a href="coroner">coroner</a> <a href="Thomas%20Denys%20%28d.1461%29">Thomas Denys</a> that August.

Even though Mowbray supported the Yorkist regime, he met with strong opposition from the East Anglian <a href="gentry">gentry</a> in the first year of the reign. This was despite the support of the King, and the backing of John Howard in the shires. Howard was by now one of Mowbray's senior retainers —described as Mowbray's "right well-beloved cousin and servant"— and <a href="Sheriff">Sheriff</a> of Norfolk. By November, however, he had been arrested by the new Yorkist regime.

Mowbray did not live long enough to benefit from the Yorkist victory. He died on 6 November 1461, aged 45, and was buried at <a href="Thetford%20Priory">Thetford Priory</a>. He was succeeded by his only son, <a href="John%20de%20Mowbray%2C%204th%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">John</a>. His mother, Katherine Duchess of Norfolk lived until 1484. She had already taken two more husbands during Mowbray's lifetime, and took another after his death.

Mowbray married Eleanor Bourchier, daughter of <a href="William%20Bourchier%2C%20Count%20of%20Eu">William Bourchier, Count of Eu</a>, and Anne of Gloucester, Countess of Buckingham. Eleanor was the sister of his successor as <a href="Justice%20in%20Eyre">Justice in Eyre</a>, <a href="Henry%20Bourchier%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Essex">Henry Bourchier</a>. The couple appears to have shared a close bond: while travelling in 1451, Mowbray supposedly dispensed with his retinue to enjoy, according to Colin Richmond, "a private <a href="wikt%3Atryst">tryst</a>" with his wife. The couple had one child, also <a href="John%20Mowbray%2C%204th%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">John</a>, who in 1448 married <a href="Elizabeth%20Talbot%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Norfolk">Elizabeth</a>, daughter of <a href="John%20Talbot%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Shrewsbury">John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury</a>. The son was seventeen when his father died in 1461, and inherited the estate four years later.

Ralph Griffiths has suggested that when Archbishop John Kemp died in 1453, it may have been in part because of the bullying and threats he had been subjected to, most "notably by Norfolk himself". One modern historian has attributed much of Suffolk's success in the region, which antagonised Mowbray, to Mowbray's "crass incompetence" and that he was "ineffectual" in assisting those who expected to rely on the protection of a lord of his stature. <a href="J.%20R.%20Lander">J. R. Lander</a> described Mowbray as a "disreputable thug", while Richmond concludes that he was "cavalier with the rights of others to a safe life and a secure livelihood". Richmond writes that while "many medieval aristocrats were irresponsible men ... Mowbray's individuality lay in the thoroughness of his irresponsibility." In contrast, <a href="Michael%20Hicks%20%28historian%29">Michael Hicks</a> believes that honour was clearly important to Mowbray, as his pursuit of Somerset (for that duke's abject performance in France) shows. Likewise, as Earl Marshal, he must have possessed a firm understanding of <a href="chivalry">chivalry</a> and its application, as it was fundamental to the office.

Mowbray, as "Duke of Norfolk", is a minor figure in the play "<a href="King%20Henry%20VI%2C%20Part%203">King Henry VI, Part 3</a>" by <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>. He appears in act I, scene i, and act II, scene ii as a supporter of the Duke of York; the first time just after the Battle of St Albans, and is portrayed "conspicuously associated with opposition." This is ahistorical, as Mowbray was still loyal to King Henry at this point. His second appearance in the play is at the Battle of Towton. The play has been adapted for the screen several times. In the 1960 <a href="BBC">BBC</a> TV serial "<a href="An%20Age%20of%20Kings">An Age of Kings</a>", the character appears in the episode "" portrayed by <a href="Jeffry%20Wickham">Jeffry Wickham</a>. In 1965 the BBC again adapted the history plays for television, this time based on the 1963 theatre production "<a href="The%20Wars%20of%20the%20Roses%20%28adaptation%29">The Wars of the Roses</a>". Mowbray appears in the episode "<a href="The%20Wars%20of%20the%20Roses%20%28adaptation%29%23Edward%20IV">Edward IV</a>" portrayed by <a href="David%20Hargreaves%20%28actor%29">David Hargreaves</a>.

In the <a href="Elizabethan%20theatre">Elizabethan</a> play "<a href="The%20Merry%20Devil%20of%20Edmonton">The Merry Devil of Edmonton</a>", Mowbray does not appear as a character on stage, but the comical figure Blague repeatedly claims that: "I serve the good Duke of Norfolk." Exactly what period the play is set is the subject debate among scholars. Suggestions range from the reign of <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">King Henry VI</a> (1421–1471) to the 1580s (in <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth I's</a> reign). The 20th-century Shakespeare scholar <a href="W.%20W.%20Greg">W. W. Greg</a> places it in the reign of Henry VI, basing his conclusion in part on <a href="Thomas%20Fuller">Thomas Fuller</a>'s posthumously published "History of the Worthies of England" (1662). If this is the case then the "Duke of Norfolk" referred to in the play would be Mowbray. According to J. M. Bromley, the play evokes "the similarities between poaching and treason", and the anonymous author deliberately links this Duke of Norfolk to both. Rudolph Fiehler noted how Blague's service to the duke was very much based upon the unsavoury characteristics of "cowardice, poaching and thievery". It has further been suggested that his comic catchphrase was deliberately intended to invoke <a href="Sir%20John%20Falstaff">Sir John Falstaff</a>, one of Shakespeare's best known characters, for the audience. In Shakespeare's "<a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%202">Henry IV, Part 2</a>", <a href="Robert%20Shallow">Justice Shallow</a> refers to Falstaff as having once been a <a href="page%20%28servant%29">page</a> to "Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk", Mowbray's grandfather. Falstaff is commonly considered to be a fictional representation of either Sir <a href="John%20Oldcastle">John Oldcastle</a> or Sir <a href="John%20Fastolf">John Fastolf</a>—or possibly an amalgamation of the two—both of whom are variously associated with Mowbray.
